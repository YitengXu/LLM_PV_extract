The reaction mechanism involved thermal homolytic cleavage to give fullerene radicals, oxidation of the radicals to generate fullerene cations, and then demethylative cyclization in which the fullerene cationic centers interact with an aromatic group or the oxygen atoms of methoxy groups to produce the cyclized products. The obtained cyclo[60]fullerene derivatives were used in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells and showed moderate power conversion efficiency and respectable open-circuit voltage.
Introduction
The fullerene cation,1–6 which is reactive and has the ability to participate in rearrangements, is of great interest and can serve as a versatile platform for the functionalization of fullerene. Rearrangement of intricately designed fullerene derivative cations has provided a number of functionalized fullerenes that are difficult to synthesize by other methods.3 For example, 1,2-dihydromethano[60]fullerene7 was synthesized in a nearly quantitative yield by using a γ-silyl fullerene cation.4a A series of non-cyclic 1,2-diorgano[60]fullerene derivatives have been synthesized in good to excellent yield through an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reaction of an arylsilylmethyl[60]fullerene cation derived from the oxidation of a single-bonded organo[60]fullerene dimer or mono(organo)[60]fullerene anion.4b
However, generation of fullerene cation has been considered difficult because of the electronegative nature of the fullerene moiety. Thus, the scope of substrates and applications is currently limited. In this work, we employed a concise and efficient method to generate fullerene cations by oxidation of fullerene dimers.4 We report here cyclization reactions employing this method to synthesize oxygen-containing 5- and 7-membered cyclo[60]fullerene derivatives by using Cu(II) halides or iodine as an oxidant as well as additives for particular cases. The key step in these reactions is demethylation of the methoxy group in the addend, which is mediated by the fullerene cation (Fig. 1), to give cyclized products. Reaction mechanisms for three kinds of fullerene cation-mediated cyclization reactions and the key intermediates for these reactions are discussed. Some of the fullerene derivatives obtained in this work have low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels because of the electronegativity of the oxygen atoms connected directly to the fullerene core. The mechanistic findings and compounds obtained in this study will expand fullerene chemistry and the selection of materials in organic solar cell (OSC) research.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of cyclo[60]fullerene derivatives
We have reported that an electron-rich aryl substituent on a silicon atom undergoes the intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reaction to produce an aryl-migrated product.4b We therefore hypothesized that intramolecular cyclization will proceed when the fullerene cation contains an electron-donating alkoxy group. Fullerene derivative dimer 1a with an ortho-methoxy group on the phenyl group was used for the initial investigation (Table 1). According to our previous results,4b 1,2-(alkyl)(aryl)fullerene 2 was selectivity generated by heating dimer 1a together with 2.0 equiv. of CuBr2 in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution (entry 1). We attempted to use CuF2 and CuI as oxidants instead of CuBr2, but the reaction did not proceed (entries 2 and 3). Considering that the fullerene cation is unstable, we tried using additives to stabilize the fullerene cation. Acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), and methanol (2.0 vol% to ODCB; entries 4–6) were used. Only the addition of acetonitrile promoted the cyclization reaction to afford the cyclized product 3a (entry 4). However, the yield of 3a could not be improved by increasing the amount of acetonitrile. One possibility is that the demethylation step does not proceed readily. We therefore tried using iodine as both the oxidant and demethylation reagent. The cyclized fullerene derivative 3a was obtained as the main product in good to excellent yield (entries 7 and 8). We also synthesized a 4-n-butoxyl-substituted cyclo[60]fullerene compound (3b; structure is shown in Fig. S11†) in 75% yield with the aim of improving the solubility for photovoltaic investigations.

We propose an oxidation-promoted cyclization reaction mechanism (Scheme 1). Upon heating, the single-bonded fullerene dimer is converted into two fullerene radicals via homolytic bond cleavage, which are oxidized by the oxidant (CuBr2 or I2) to afford the fullerene cation and halide anion. Then, the aryl group migrates from the silicon atom onto the fullerene carbon, generating a silyl cation. When bromide is present, it coordinates to and stabilizes the silyl cation. Then, methanolysis gives the methoxysilylmethyl derivative 2. When iodine is used as the oxidant, it does not sufficiently stabilize the silyl cation (acetonitrile also has a destabilizing effect by displacing the bromide on the silicon atom), and hence, the silyl cation cleaves the C–O bond of the methoxy group through the formation of an oxonium cation next to the silicon atom (Si-onium intermediate) to give the 7-membered cyclized product 3a.8
 Scheme 1  Proposed reaction mechanism of I2-promoted cyclization to produce 3a. 
There are two possibilities for the interaction between the fullerene cation and the addend (Scheme 2). One is fullerene cation–π interaction, and the other is interaction between the fullerene cation and a lone pair of the methoxy group oxygen atom. The latter route would produce another 7-membered ring product 3a′ with demethylation via an onium cation intermediate. At first, we could not distinguish between the two possible structures by 1H and 13C NMR. Ultimately, we determined that the product was 3a not 3a′ by 2D HMQC and HMBC measurements, which showed a correlation between the sp3-carbon atom of fullerene (C(C60)–Ar) and the hydrogen atom of the phenyl group (ortho-position of the C60–Ar bond). Thus, we can conclude that the 5-membered fullerene cation–π interaction is favored over the 7-membered fullerene–oxygen intermediate.

We previously examined the generation of fullerene cations with an isopropoxy group on the silicon atom by oxidation of the fullerene radical, which is derived from the homolytic cleavage of the fullerene dimer 1b. When CuCl2 was used as the oxidant, the reaction proceeded to give dihydromethanofullerene (C61H2, 4) in 98% yield (Scheme 2).4a,c The reaction in the presence of methanol as an additive (3.0 vol% to ODCB) afforded 4 in 9% yield and a new product (5) in 91% yield (Scheme 3). Characterization of 5 by UV-vis, MS, and NMR indicated the structure of a 5-membered cyclofullerene derivative. This is explained by a lone pair of the oxygen atom on the silicon atom interacting with the fullerene cation to form a 5-membered ring oxonium intermediate (Scheme 4a), which finally gives the cyclized product through demethylation by halide. Here, we consider a similar key intermediate, Si-oxonium cation, in this reaction to promote the demethylation by halide. The difference in reactivity between the reactions with and without methanol might be explained in part by exchange of alkoxy groups from the isopropoxy group to the methoxy group on the silicon atom in the presence of methanol. Through this exchange reaction, halide can easily access the methyl group. Another possible reaction mechanism is the formation of a methoxy fullerene intermediate by the reaction of the fullerene cation and methanol (Scheme 4b). However, this reaction mechanism does not involve an oxonium intermediate. Based on the reaction mechanism for the formation of the 7-membered ring product 3a, we surmise that the reaction mechanism for 5 is the one shown in Scheme 4a. We examined the reaction in the presence of H2O instead of MeOH, but the reaction gave only compound 4. Only methanol promoted this cyclization to afford compound 5.

We further investigated this cyclization reaction by using the aryl[60]fullerene dimer, which does not contain a silicon atom. CuBr2 was used as the oxidant. Dihydrobenzofurano[60]fullerene derivative 6 was obtained in 89% yield (Scheme 5). Dihydrobenzofurano[60]fullerene was first reported by Taylor et al., who connected the oxygen atom to the fullerene core through the reaction of C60Cl6 and phenols in the presence of KOH (Scheme 6).9 However, the yield of benzofurano[60]fullerene was only 23% by this protocol. Itami et al. reported the synthesis of dihydrobenzofurano[60]fullerene derivatives by a trifluoromethanesulfonic acid-catalyzed reaction of aziridinofullerene (Scheme 6).10

 Scheme 6  Synthesis of reported dihydrobenzofurano[60]fullerene derivatives. 
The proposed mechanism is shown in Scheme 7. First, heating of the fullerene dimer 1c produces the fullerene radical. In the presence of CuBr2, the fullerene radical is oxidized to generate the fullerene cation and bromide. The bromide then acts as a demethylation reagent and promotes the subsequent cyclization reaction to afford dihydrobenzofurano[60]fullerene 6. This reaction is the simplest of the above-mentioned reactions. With this simple substrate, no fullerene cation–π interaction, migration, or cyclization to C61H2 (4) can occur. In this case, the fullerene cation can interact with an oxygen lone pair, leading to cyclization.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis spectra of 3, 5, and 6 showed typical spectral patterns for 1,2-adducts of [60]fullerene, with extended light absorption up to 750 nm and small maxima around 700 nm (Fig. S20–S24†). The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 3a exhibited a reversible one-electron reduction wave at 1.21 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in ODCB (Fig. S25†). LUMO and HOMO levels, estimated from the reduction potential in the CV and optical onset in the UV-vis spectrum, were −3.59 and −5.50 eV, respectively (Table 2). Compound 5 also exhibited a reversible one-electron reduction wave in ODCB. Interestingly, this compound containing an sp3 carbon(C60)–oxygen bond was found to have a lower-lying LUMO level (−3.62 eV) compared with PCBM (−3.61 eV) as estimated from CV data in the same solvent (Table 2). This is because of the slightly higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom compared with the carbon atom. Thus, relative to the sp3 carbon atom, the oxygen atom can act as an electron-withdrawing group. This feature is opposite to having high-lying LUMO levels in ortho-methoxyphenyl-bearing fullerene derivatives, where the ortho-methoxyphenyl group has a through-space/through-bond electron-donating character.11,12

Furthermore, 6 showed the lowest LUMO level (−3.67 eV; CV shown in Fig. 2a) among PCBM and the compounds examined in this study. The LUMO level of 6 lies 0.06 eV below that of PCBM, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the phenoxy moiety relative to the sp3 carbon atom of C60. In previous studies, fullerene electron acceptors with high LUMO levels have been eagerly sought to achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC) in OSCs.4,13,14 However, fullerene derivatives with low LUMO levels have also recently started to attract interest5b,15 because these compounds will be necessary to achieve electron transfer from electron donors composed of deep-HOMO (deep-LUMO) low-bandgap polymers and from near-infrared light-absorbing materials.

Compounds 5 and 6 showed redox behavior with an irreversible reduction for the second electron (Fig. 2b). This is attributed to fullerene carbon–oxygen bond cleavage by the two-electron reduction process, as we previously found in a C70–O(oxazolino) compound, where the oxygen atom of the oxazolino moiety attaches to a carbon atom in the belt (equatorial) region of C70.16 That C70 derivative underwent C–O bond cleavage in the first reduction step. This provided a new strategy to achieve high VOC with suppressing back electron transfer through stabilization of the reduced state (fullerene radical anions) by energetically stabilizing the cleaved state of the C–O bond.16 In 5 and 6, this C(fullerene)–O bond cleavage behavior was seen in the second reduction step. Thus, there will be no VOC-increasing effect for the present compounds, if only one-electron reduction occurs in OSCs.
Fabrication of organic solar cells and photovoltaic properties
We fabricated bulk-heterojunction OSCs by using 3a, 3b, and 5, as well as the open-1,2-(aryl)(alkyl)fullerene 2 as a reference compound. Unfortunately, 6 had low solubility because of its small methyl substituent, and we could not fabricate a device. We prepared the devices with the following architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al, employing 3a as an electron acceptor and P3HT as an electron donor in the active layer for optimization. Under the optimized conditions, the donor and acceptor ratio was 5:4 in a 10 mg mL−1 ODCB solution (versus P3HT) with annealing at 80 °C for 10 min after spin-coating of the active layer, and the PCE was 1.74% (Table 3) with an unexpectedly high VOC of 0.71 V (Fig. 3). The reason why 3a gave high VOC remains unclear, but we speculate that the work function of the aluminum electrode was changed by vertical separation of the fullerene acceptors to the surface of the active layer due to the surface energy of the Si–O moieties and Si–O bond cleavage by calcium hole blockers. Further investigation of this point will be necessary. We also optimized for fabrication of a P3HT:3b device, and found similar optimal conditions (D:A ratio = 5:4, 10 mg (donor)/mL active layer solution concentration, 60 °C thermal annealing). The PCE reached 1.85%. VOC varied from 0.62 to 0.66 V as the annealing temperature was changed from non-annealing to 150 °C (Fig. 4). Reference compound 2 showed a typical VOC value (0.63 V) with similar PCE (1.77%). At the least, we can conclude that the obtained VOC for the 3a and 3b devices was higher than that for the P3HT:PCBM device (usually 0.58–0.60 V), because of 3's higher LUMO level.

We failed to fabricate the device using P3HT and 5, because of 5's high crystallinity giving large aggregates in thin films. Thus, we changed from the polymer donor P3HT to a crystalline small-molecule donor, namely, a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative DPP(TBFu)2.17,18 The active layers were spin-coated with 10 mg mL−1 solutions in CHCl3 with donor/acceptor ratios of 5:4, 5:3, and 5:2. After spin-coating of the active layer, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) with CH2Cl2 was applied for 30 to 120 s to crystallize DPP(TBFu)2 (Table S1†). A donor/acceptor ratio of 5:3 and SVA time of 30 s were found to be optimal, and a PCE of 2.12% was obtained (Fig. 5). To obtain morphological information, atomic force microscopy was performed (Fig. S29†). The optimized film was found to have a flatter surface (Rq = 1.77 nm) than the others. Notably, the optimized device showed slightly higher VOC (0.90 V) compared with the devices using PC61BM (0.89 V) and PC71BM (0.89 V) with DPP(TBFu)2 in our previous report,18 even though the LUMO level of 5 is slightly lower than that of PC61BM. However, the difference was very small and could be the result of optimization. Thus, we cannot discuss further the VOC-increasing effect of the C–O bond cleavage in 5, but we can conclude that 3 and 5 give moderate PCEs in polymer and small-molecule OSCs, respectively, with respectable VOC values.

Concluding remarks
Because fullerenes are electron acceptors, most fullerene modification reactions rely on generating fullerene anion intermediates. In particular, many reactions begin with nucleophilic attack on fullerene. Examples include nucleophilic addition of organolithium,19 organocopper,20 or Grignard reagents,21 as well as 1,3-dipolar additions involving attack by an anion, such as the synthesis of PCBM,22 the Prato reaction,23 and the Bingel–Hirsch reaction.24 Moreover, there are reactions that proceed without the formation of a charged intermediate, such as the Diels–Alder reaction,25 where the fullerene serves as the dienophile (electrophile) and its LUMO participates in the reaction. On the other hand, there are few fullerene modification reactions using fullerene cation intermediates. We have so far reported the formation of hydrofullerene cation (HC60+), fullerene radical cation (C60˙+), and alkylfullerene cation (RC60+; R = silylmethyl, etc.) by using AlCl3, FeCl3, and CuCl2, respectively. As for the latter copper-mediated reactions, we have demonstrated the formation of 3-membered rings (cyclopropanation) to give C61H2 (2) and migration of aryl groups to obtain rare 1-aryl-2-alkylfullerenes. In this paper, we reported 5- and 7-membered ring formation by employing fullerene–π and fullerene–oxygen interactions for the first time. These reactions could also be achieved by using I2 to generate iodide (I−), which cannot strongly bond with the silyl cation (R3Si+), and additives such as acetonitrile and methanol to promote cyclization. In addition, we demonstrated the use of arylfullerene cation (ArC60+) for the first time, which could also serve as an intermediate for cyclization when the aryl group had a 2-methoxy group. All cyclization reactions reported in this paper involved demethylation of the methoxy group to produce cyclo[60]fullerene derivatives. The demethylation reactions were promoted by the formation of a Si-onium cation intermediate or another onium cation intermediate connected to the aromatic group. These new findings will expand fullerene chemistry utilizing fullerene cation intermediates, and will provide useful tools for the modification of fullerene to obtain new fullerene derivatives and fullerene-based electron-accepting materials.
The fullerene derivatives synthesized in this study were oxygen-containing cyclized products with higher (3a and 3b) or lower (5 and 6) LUMO levels than PCBM. In particular, 5 and 6 have a fullerene (sp3 C)–oxygen bond, enabling a strong electron-accepting feature with a low-lying LUMO level because of the electronegativity of the oxygen atom relative to the sp3 carbon atom. This provides a rather rare class of fullerene electron acceptors for use in thin-film OSCs, and these compounds potentially fit with the low-lying LUMO levels of near-infrared light-absorbing low bandgap materials, which are now being developed.
Experimental
Materials were purchased from Tokyo Kasei (TCI) Co., Sigma-Aldrich Inc., and other commercial suppliers and used after appropriate purification before use. Anhydrous solvents (stabilizer-free) were purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical and purified by a solvent purification system (GlassContour) equipped with columns of activated alumina and supported copper catalyst (Q-5) prior to use. All reactions dealing with air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under nitrogen or argon. All reactions were monitored by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, column, Cosmosil-Buckyprep, 4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque; flow rate, 2.0 mL min−1; eluent, toluene/isopropanol (7/3); detector, Shimadzu SPD-M10 Avp). NMR spectra were measured on a JEOL ECA-600 spectrometer reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane. Routine and high-resolution mass spectra were acquired on JEOL JMS-T100LC (AccuTOF), Bruker microTOF II, Bruker solariX 9.4T, and Bruker ultraflexTOF/TOF spectrometers. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-670 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a HOKUTO DENKO HZ-5000 voltammetric analyser. All CV measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under argon gas, equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The solvent with the supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under 1 Sun AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (EMS-35AAA, Ushio Spax Inc.), which was calibrated using a silicon diode (BS-520BK, Bunkoukeiki).

A 10 mg mL−1 solution of DPP(TBFu)2:5 in CHCl3 (vs. DPP(TBFu)2) was prepared with a 5:3 w/w donor/acceptor ratio. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h and then filtered. The films were prepared by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The devices were solvent vapor annealed using CH2Cl2 for 30 s.
Finally, the substrates were transferred into a vacuum chamber. All devices were deposited with Ca (20 nm for the P3HT devices) or LiF (0.6 nm for the DPP(TBFu)2 devices) and then Al (80 nm). The active area (0.04 cm2) was defined by the geometric overlap between Al and ITO and photo-masks.
