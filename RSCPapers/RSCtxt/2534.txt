    , Accepted 30th December 2020First published on 3rd January 2021AbstractThe electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable chemicals and fuels using clean energy resources is a promising and effective route to support energy storage and reduce the large CO2 concentration to avoid climate change. Among the presently adopted CO2 conversion technologies, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to valuable feedstock is presently a concern of critical research effort as a technology that can concurrently enable CO2 reduction and the storage of renewable energy. The ECR performance and economic viability are greatly influenced by the intrinsic characteristics of the catalyst employed. Many techniques have been practiced to improve the catalytic performance of heterogeneous catalysts by administering their morphology, size, crystal facets, grain boundaries, and surface defects and their integration with other synergistic constituents to fabricate nanomaterials. Presently, the fabrication of nanomaterials at the atomic level is an effective and strong technique to address the particular issues of catalytic performance and durability in ECR, by comprehending the structure–performance relationship of the nanomaterials.

1. Introduction
1.1 Closing the carbon loop
Natural resources including natural gas, coal, and petroleum are being consumed unprecedentedly to meet the global energy demand of the continuously increasing population. At present, 82% of the energy need is fulfilled by the daily consumption of 10 B cubic meters of natural gas, 20 M tonnes of coal, and 10 M tonnes of petroleum.1 They collectively discharge 30 B tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere2 and 2% of this carbon dioxide is consumed by plants and absorbed into the seawater, causing the acidification of seawater. Before industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 280 ppm; it became 390 ppm at the end of the last decade, and is projected to be 570 ppm before 2100.3,4 Certainly, these high anthropogenic CO2 discharges have resulted in the present harmful climate changes, which have detrimental impacts on the environment and are also a serious threat to the society and the next generation.5,6
Hence, the transmutation of this notorious gas into useful products such as liquid fuels and chemicals is assumed to be the core concern of the research community. The objective is to address the environmental issues as well as to reduce the continuous consumption of fossil fuels. The consumption of CO2 by transmuting it to novel feedstock is not only a sustainable approach towards green fuel production but it can also effectively close the carbon cycle. The impediments in conventional approaches have hindered the development of different novel approaches such as solar thermochemical, plasma-chemical, electrochemical, biochemical, and photochemical, which are used with or without catalysts.
1.2 Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR)
Addressing the global emissions of carbon dioxide, electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising route to convert CO2 into useful chemicals and fuels (Fig. 1a).7,8 The electrochemical CO2 reduction thermodynamically progresses through a proton-coupled multi-electron transfer mechanism in an electrochemical cell (typical H-type cells) provided with an aqueous electrolyte, which produces low carbon products such as carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, formic acid, methanol, and ethanol.
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemicals and fuels produced through electrochemical CO2 reduction using renewable energy resources, (b) flow diagram describing the methodology of the present review. 
The electrochemical cell is comprised of a cathode (catalyst-loaded working electrode), a reference electrode, and an anode (counter electrode to balance the charge). A membrane is used to separate the cathode and anode in order to avoid re-oxidation of the ECR products and to balance the charge. The electrolyte operates as a medium to transport the charges and to dissolve carbon dioxide. ECR occurs over the solid catalyst surface and generally includes three important steps: (1) adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface; (2) charge transfer to disintegrate the CO bond to form the C–O or C–H bond; (3) product desorption from the catalyst surface. Some parameters to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance are given below.
1. Faradaic efficiency (FE): the percent of electrons consumed for producing a certain product.
2. Current density (CD): the total current divided by the area of the working electrodes.
3. Onset potential: the lowest potential at which the products are generated.
4. Turnover frequency: the number of molecules formed per active site per unit time, indicating the intrinsic activity of the catalysts.
5. Tafel slope: to investigate the reaction kinetics of ECR.
The ECR process is highly beneficial compared to other approaches with respect to the operating conditions (pressure and temperature) and applications, such as the decarbonization of the processing industries, reducing the large CO2 concentration, storage of renewable electric power in fuels, and carbon-neutral economy. Moreover, compared to other CO2 conversion technologies, electrochemical CO2 conversion has various benefits: (1) the formation of hydrocarbons simply from renewable electricity, carbon dioxide, and water can be accomplished; (2) the transmutation systems are scalable, on-demand, highly efficient, and compact; (3) the mechanism is easier and precise to administer by simply monitoring the reaction temperatures and electrode potentials; (4) the operation can use clean energy means such as tidal, geothermal, wind, and solar plus additional electricity obtained from hydroelectric and nuclear sources,8 as given in Table 1. By using this technology, carbon-neutral electricity means can be employed for the electroreduction of CO2 so as to produce useful chemicals and fuels, therefore closing the carbon cycle and mitigating CO2 emissions. A comparison of the different CO2 technologies indicating their advantages and disadvantages is given in Table 1.

Albeit CO2 reduction into different alcohols and hydrocarbon is more thermodynamically supported over HER, the functioning of electrode materials is greatly obstructed by lethargic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) reaction kinetics and superior overpotentials. The similar reduction potentials to produce the aforementioned reduction products is another hindrance related to the reaction's poor selectivity.
Presently, many approaches have been employed to enhance the ECR catalytic performances of metallic electrocatalysts by administering their crystal facets, grain boundaries, surface defects, and more importantly, the morphology and size,9–12 as discussed in Section 3. Although, few research studies have reported the generation of nanostructured electrocatalysts and carbon-derived heterogeneous catalysts used in ECR for the selective formation of HCOOH and CO, more comprehensive reviews elucidating the latest technological developments entailing metal-derived catalysts for the selective production of useful chemicals other than HCOOH and CO are yet to be produced.
In the first part of this review, we present the characterization techniques, factors affecting the catalytic performance of nanomaterials, and then discuss the recent technological advancements of the metal-derived nanomaterials being used in ECR for the selective production of HCOOH, CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons, offering a deep understanding of the mechanistic comprehension of selective reduction reactions based on several types of metallic nanostructured electrocatalysts. The second part of the present review throws light on the different commonly-adopted fabrication methods to present useful guidance for the fabrication of several metal-derived nanostructures (NSs), specifically supporting different heterogeneous reduction reactions. At the end, the prospects and challenges of nanomaterials performances and their fabrication methods have been discussed and possible future directions have been speculated. The methodology adopted in this review has been shown in Fig. 1b.
2. Characterization methods for material structure and properties
It is widely known that efficient and robust electrocatalysts are highly crucial for the practical applications of electrochemical CO2 reduction systems. However, the development of efficient catalytic systems is obstructed by the sparse knowledge on the reaction pathways, active surface structures, and the early degradation of the catalysts, and therefore requires characterizations of CO2RR under operating conditions. The in situ or operando characterization of catalysts uses different analytical tools to study their compositional, morphological, structural, physical, and chemical properties in the presence of reactants and electrolytes. Presently, the reconstructions of active surfaces and structural changes during ECR are widely monitored through advanced operando tools. For nanomaterials including chalcogenides, oxides, alloys, and metals, metal atoms over the surface with a low-coordination environment at the corners, steps, edges, and apices operate as the active surfaces for CO2RR.13,14 An extensively adopted technique to improve the catalytic activity of nanomaterials is to increase the selectivity of the active surfaces by administering the nanomaterial compositions, crystal phases, structures, and shapes.15,16 Hence, it is imperative to establish several operando techniques to investigate the atom arrangements and determine the active phases in nanomaterials in order to develop such electrocatalysts that have excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Different operando techniques are enlisted in Table 2 to obtain an understanding of their working capability and the applicable catalyst type.

3. Factors affecting the catalytic performance of metal-based nanomaterials
3.1 Size effect
The particle size greatly impacts the catalytic activities since as the particle size reduces, the ratio of the surface to the bulk atoms increases. Reducing the size of a particle increases its surface curvature, decreases the surface coordination of the atoms, and as a result, the number of low-coordinated sites increase. It is widely accepted that the binding energy of a transition metal is affected by the coordination number of the binding surface. The binding energy will be stronger when the coordination number is small.17,18 Furthermore, a large number of low-coordinated sites constitute a complex structure and generally enhance the catalysts' reactivities. For instance, the reactivity of Au and Cu NPs for hydrogen production was enhanced dramatically when the size of the nanoparticles was reduced due to the increasing population of under-coordinated site atoms.19,20 Hence, small size nanoparticles (NPs) will inhibit the CO2 reduction reaction by enhanced hydrogen generation.
Recently, Jeon et al. investigated the size-dependent selectivity and activity of zinc NPs for ECR. They found outstanding activity and selectivity towards CO formation when the NPs size was between 3–5 nm, whereas NPs size above 5 nm exhibited an obvious decrease and their performance was similar to bulk-like catalytic characteristics. We may conclude that the size-controlling approach can assist in developing more efficient catalytic systems so as to achieve the selective production of certain chemicals through electrochemical CO2 reduction.
3.2 Morphology
Experimental and computational studies have demonstrated that the catalyst surface morphology can facilitate CO2 electroreduction to CO since the crucial step in CO2 conversion to produce carbon monoxide is the discharge of CO from the surface of the catalyst.21–23 Hence, appropriate morphology control will help in the discharge of carbon monoxide. The modification of the nanomaterial morphology directly alters the exposed facets and surface area of the particular material, which subsequently influences the population of the exposed active surfaces. Morphology control can also alter the local conditions of the nanocatalysts, identifying their catalytic performances to some extent. Some previous studies have displayed that transforming catalysts into needle-like thin rods can maintain the CO2 concentration in the electrolyte close to the catalyst surface, therefore efficiently facilitating CO2 reduction. For instance, a study reported that nanoneedles of gold outstandingly helped the kinetics of CO2 conversion compared to nanoparticles of gold due to the field-induced reagent concentration.24 The sharp gold corners formed strong electric fields, inducing the alkali cations in the vicinity of the catalysts and yielding a high concentration of carbon dioxide around the reaction surfaces, which improved the CO2 reduction and suppressed the HER operation. Many research studies25–27 have revealed that administering the catalyst morphology can yield powerful electric fields or unveil more active surfaces to improve the catalytic activities. The objective of morphology control is to influence the local environment in the vicinity of the catalyst or unveil more active surfaces to enhance the reaction activities.
3.3 Surface engineering
It is quite important to study and improve the catalyst surface since the ECR proceeds over the catalyst surface. The surface engineering of electrocatalysts can be carried out through exposed crystal facets, surface defects, and/or surface doping. Owing to under-coordinated atoms present over the catalyst surface, it is convenient to improve with metals and non-metals. The integration of several elements can facilitate the binding energies of the reaction intermediates, therefore influencing the reaction potentials and selectivities.28 For instance, the catalytic activities of pure carbon are considerably poor towards CO2 reduction, while doping it with single atoms can remarkably reduce CO2 adsorption to improve the CO2 reduction. The induction of defects can significantly increase the adsorption of intermediates and reactants, and can also earn a number of vacancies in the form of adsorption sites that are highly useful for CO2 reduction. The crystal facets uncovered over the catalyst surface can tune the reaction activity and selectivity, and crystal facets having a small activation barrier and elevated adsorption energy greatly facilitate the electrocatalytic reactions. The crystal facets can be effectively energized by administering the quantity of surfactants employed in the fabrication process. As evidenced by different research reports,28–30 the surface engineering of different catalysts can tune the binding energies of the reaction intermediates and can also facilitate the disintegration of scaling interaction between identically adsorbed intermediates and decrease the overpotential. The prime objective of surface defects is to offer more empty spaces as the adsorption sites and improve the CO2 adsorption. The catalytic reaction is directly impacted by the uncovered crystal facets and further, they can also identify the atoms' arrangement over the catalyst surface. Hence, unveiling more active crystal surfaces can efficiently improve CO2 reduction.
3.4 Grain boundaries
It has been shown that catalytically energized surfaces can be stabilized using grain boundaries (GBs).31,32 Feng et al. fabricated Au NPs over carbon nanotubes using the vapor deposition method to study the relationship between the catalytic activity and GBs.33 They showed that surface area-normalized CO2 reduction activity is linearly correlated with the GBs density over the Au carbon nanotubes, indicating that GBs modification is a strong technique to tune the catalytic performance of different NPs. Mariano et al.34 employed scanning electrochemical cell microscopy and electrochemical calculations with a submicrometer resolution to demonstrate that the GB surface defects in Au electrodes were more energized compared to the grain surfaces for ECR. The catalytic impression of the GB was equivalent to its dislocation strain field, offering a route for the broader utilization of the GB effects in heterogeneous catalysis. More significant research studies are needed to comprehend the underlying principle related to the GBs and to use it to develop efficient catalytic systems for the reduction of CO2 into useful products.
4. Different types of metal-derived electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction
4.1 Single metal electrocatalysts
The metal groups produce many types of products under different CO2RR conditions (Table 3). The superior selectivity and activity of Ag, Au, and Pd-based materials make them an excellent option for CO2 electrocatalysis. DFT-based research investigations have disclosed that the weak interaction of silver and gold with *CO promotes the desorption of carbon monoxide, which is produced on their surfaces and therefore, the activation of CO2 is the rate-limiting phase. On the other hand, on Pd-electrodes, the energy impediments of *CO and *COOH are comparatively lower and CO desorption restricts the reaction rate because of a strong interaction between Pd and *CO.35,36 Several studies have shown that the overall performance of ECR using metal-based catalysts is highly affected by their grain boundaries, morphology, size, crystal facets, and surface defects,9–11,37 as discussed in the previous section. For example, a study38 demonstrated a prominent shape-dependent ECR to produce CO using triangular nanoplates of silver. In comparison with bulk silver and same-sized silver nanoparticles (Fig. 2a–c), the nanoplates showed a superior current density (CD) and comparatively high energy efficiency (EE) and faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.7% and 96.8%, respectively. Moreover, the excellence of silver nanoplates as an electrocatalyst was further confirmed when CO began to be detected at an extremely low overpotential (96 mV). DFT investigations showed that shape control design assisted in achieving the comparatively increased catalytic selectively and activity over the low value of overpotential. Furthermore, high catalytic stability was ascertained over a week with a trivial reduction in the CO FE (96% at −0.85 V vs. RHE) and CD (1.25 mA cm−2), as indicated in Fig. 2d. They contemplated that the produced electrocatalysts, comprising of Ag (100), needed low energy to begin the rate-determining step than Ag (111). Although Ag (55) supported *COOH production, their powerful association with succeeding *CO intermediates reduced the desorption rate of carbon monoxide. The particular structure of silver nanoplates not only contributed the best possible edge/corner proportion but also dominated over the Ag (100) facet, where it needed low energy to begin the rate-determining step. This research investigation revealed an attractive route to regulate the catalytic selectivity and activity for ECR by generating edge sites and the best possible facet via shape-control integration.

In another study, direct current potential amperometry was used to produce Au electrodes using different morphologies (particles, rods, and needles), further regulated by HAuCl4 concentration and applied potential.24 Employing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 10 mV s−1 in 0.5 M KHCO3, the results showed an explicit cathodic peak −0.5 and −0.3 V versus RHE when ERC using Au needles were performed; however, Au rods and particles did not display any cathodic peak. The variation in the activity of CO2 reduction among Au particles, rods, and needles was more obvious at low values of overpotentials. Over 8 hours, Au needles demonstrated 90% faradaic efficiency for CO formation and superior current density (jtotal = 7 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V). On the other hand, Au rods exhibited meager current density (0.1 mA cm−2) and low selectivity (3%) for CO production. Au particles also did not show very high current density (less than 0.05 mA cm−2) and exclusively produced H2. An outline of FE and CD for ECR has been provided in Fig. 3a–c. Near −0.3 V versus RHE, no observable CO2 reduction was found for the Au rods. It was shown that the energies of activation reduced quickly from 70 kJ mol−1 (gold particles) to 20 kJ mol−1 (gold needles), demonstrating that the gold needles' morphology was thermodynamically more supportive in the electroreduction of CO2.

As electrocatalysts, palladium nanoparticles have demonstrated promising characteristics, while how several Pd surfaces influence their performance in ECR to produce syngas has not been completely comprehended. Chen et al.40 synthesized Pd octahedral particles (Pd-Oct-P) and nano-sized cubes controlled by the facets of Pd (111) and Pd (100) (Fig. 4a–d). They found that Pd-Oct-P exhibited outstanding CO selectivity (more than 90%) at −0.7 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4e) and appropriate activity compared to Pd particles and cubes. Furthermore, Pd-Oct-P showed an excellent CO current density of 40 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V compared to other Pd catalysts (Fig. 4f). Octahedral Pd particles in an electrochemical cell demonstrated that 5.47 A CO current was attained at 3.3 V, relating to CO current density of about 220 mA cm−2. DFT calculations showed that the decreased binding energies of HOCO and CO intermediates on PdH (111) are crucial factors to conceive superior faradaic efficiency and current densities in order to produce CO from CO2. Although Ag-, Au-, and Pd-based catalysts exhibit excellent performance in CO2 reduction to produce useful chemicals, their commercial-scale utilization is strongly obstructed by their scarcity and cost. Therefore, it is of extreme importance to explore and develop inexpensive, earth-abundant materials having suitable catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity.

Cu, Sn, Bi, and Zn-based catalysts including CdS, WSe2, and MoSe2 electrocatalysts have demonstrated encouraging performances in ECR.9,10 Similar to Ag, Au, and Pd, the catalytic efficiency of these non-noble metals can be effectively increased by administering their morphology, size, and crystal facets.41–44 For example, Strasser et al.45 presented a study describing the impact of particle size on catalytic CO2 reduction. They prepared Cu-derived NPs in the range of 2–15 nanometers and investigated their catalytic selectivity and activity as compared to bulk Cu in the course of ECR. An outstanding increase in the selectivity and activity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide was detected with reducing particle size, particularly, nanoparticles having a size less than 5 nm (Fig. 5). Nanoscale surfaces of Cu particles significantly suppressed the hydrocarbon selectivity. Moreover, the ratio of low-coordinated surfaces was significantly enhanced when the particle size was reduced. These low ratios having strong associations with *H and *CO regulated the hydrogen evolution reaction and carbon dioxide-carbon monoxide route while decreasing the movements of *H and *CO intermediates.

Few studies have shown that the alteration in surfaces can increase the catalytic activity of a particular catalyst because of variations in its surface structure and electronic arrangement.
To determine the electrocatalytic activity, Xie et al.46 studied the influence of amino acids and their offshoots (DL-tyrosine, DL-arginine, DL-leucine, DL-tryptophan, DL-leucine, and glycine) on the electrocatalytic activity of copper nanowire-coated electrode. It was observed that the modification of amino acids assisted in suppressing the HER along with fostering the ECR to form different hydrocarbons. At 1.9 V vs. silver/silver chloride, the glycine-coated electrode demonstrated the maximum faradaic efficiency (34%) for C2+ chemicals, which was nearly double as compared to undeveloped copper nanowires (Fig. 6).

Theoretical analysis showed that the formation of hydrogen bond between –NH3+ and CHO* helped achieve CHO* stabilization over Cu (110) surfaces for extra dimerization, which in turn contributed to the higher selectivity of the glycine-coated electrode for CO2 transmutation (Fig. 7). Wang et al. reported a study in which a Zn porous network was developed using electrodeposition (ED), which showed superior activity for the reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide.47 It achieved 80% faradaic efficiency for carbon monoxide at −1.1 V vs. RHE. They also developed two more Zn porous networks (ED Zn-2 and ED Zn-3) by altering the electrodeposition parameters and presented a comparison of their electrocatalytic activities in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a–c shows that all the networks have similar structures having interconnected nanoparticles but the particle size of ED Zn is smaller than the other two networks and the average particle size is 30 nm, 50 nm, and 70 nm. Compared to other networks, ED Zn (comprised of the smallest particles) exhibited a high catalytic activity, which was ascribed to its peculiar porous arrangement having more active sites. More under-coordinated surfaces become exposed when the size of the nanoparticles is reduced.48 Hence, superior catalytic activity was detected for the ED Zn electrocatalyst having a size of 30 nm (the smallest size as compared to the others), indicating that the modification of the surface morphology of a particular catalyst increases its catalytic activity in ECR.

It is worth-mentioning transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which belong to the group of two-dimensional-coated materials having a chemically-interesting structure and are commercially important. Owing to the peculiar structure characteristics and promising features (such as mechanical, electronic, optical, thermal, catalytical, and energy storage), much attention has been paid to them.49,50 They have the common chemical formula of MX2, where X is a chalcogen and M belongs to groups IV–VII B. These TMDs have shown excellent catalytic properties in ECR.
4.2 Alloyed electrocatalysts
Many research investigations have reported that the electrocatalytic activities of single metals can be efficiently improved by integrating them with several other metals and their offshoots.51–55,60,61,63 The synergistic effects obtained from the integration of different metals change the basic electronic arrangement with the shift of the d-band and the surface defects, discerning the required energy level for the activation of carbon dioxide, including the binding energy for the radical components, which is beneficial for accomplishing superior catalytic operation. For example, consider CO2 reduction employing the gold-copper alloy.62 The gold surface assisted the CO2 catalysis to produce carbon monoxide, which enhanced the concentration of CO in the vicinity of the gold-copper alloy, yielding more CO on the copper surface, which was further transmuted to C2+ products.
The special characteristics of carbon-containing nanoparticles such as greater surface area, mechanical strength, superior electrical conductivity, and chemical inertness make them highly important substances to support metal-based catalysts.63–67 The integration of carbon with metal NPs significantly improves the overall catalytic performance of CO2 reduction while moderating the metallic loading, e.g., SnO2–graphene, Au–carbon nanotube, Sn/graphene, and Ni–graphene.33,68–71 Moreover, single atoms, particularly nitrogen (N) over carbon structures, produce extra-active surfaces for reduction reactions.
Hence, combining single atoms with N-doped carbon (which are known as metal-nitrogen-carbon and indicated as MNC) is regarded as an efficient approach to improve the overall operation of ECR (Fig. 9). The catalytic performance of MNC electrocatalysts in ECR is ascribed to the collaborative outcome of different factors incorporating nitrogen functionalities, metal type, and carbon arrangements.72
 Fig. 9  Representation of metals that can be used in MNC and their reduced products (reproduced from ref. 72 with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
MNCs are presently regarded as an outstanding alternative of metallic catalysts since they enable the selective formation of CO from CO2 electroreduction at very low overpotentials, achieving ≈220 mA cm−2 CO current densities in aqueous electrolytes. The nitrogen atom in an MNC material is contained by the carbon structure, generating many chemical functionalities such as pyridinic, graphitic, and pyrrolic nitrogen, which are further coordinated with metal atoms, producing catalytically efficient single sites of MNx complexes. The MNC materials are promising candidates for ECR because they not only show superior catalytic activities but also their preparation mechanism is relatively facile and requires low-cost precursors. Hence, they are regarded as excellent electrocatalysts for commercial-scale use and can also be deployed in several technological applications.73 MNC materials are generally fabricated through the heat treatment of blends of carbon, metal salts, and N-consisting of precursor complexes, e.g., polyaniline, cyanimide, ethylenediamine, ammonia, and phenanthroline. Nitrogen atoms in pyrolysis are embedded on the carbon structure, creating numerous chemical functionalities and the forming materials are generally analyzed through several techniques in order to study their composition, morphologies, and structures. However, it is difficult to comprehend the relationship between the catalytic performance and the structure of MNC materials due to the non-uniformed distribution of several functionalities; also, many sites participate in the reduction process. Moreover, other than the types of sites, the carbon microstructure strongly influences the CO2 transport towards active surfaces, thus influencing the overall CO2RR process. The catalytic activities of MNC materials in CO2RR are also influenced by the reaction conditions, composition, and structure of the reduced products.
Hao et al.74 studied the trends in CO2 reduction to CO employing MNC incorporating electrocatalytically active M–Nx moieties (M = Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Co). The catalytic activities of these elements were found to be strongly determined by the types of metal central points, keeping different interaction energies to *COOH, *CO, and H*. The electrodes of Ni–NC and Fe–NC exhibited superior selectivities for CO formation, having higher faradaic efficiencies of 85% and 65%, respectively, whereas Co–NC showed quite poor activity, producing hydrogen as the main product (H2 FE 80%) (Fig. 10). It should be noted that the selectivities of metallic iron and nickel are quite different from two single facet electrocatalysts and apparently, the former produces hydrogen as the main product. The authors observed that Ni– and Cu–Nx had weak binding to the hydrogen intermediate, which restricted their activities for hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas the activity of Co–Nx was thermodynamically anchored by its strong interaction with hydrogen intermediate, which in turn reduced its CO selectivity. The actual poor catalytic ability of Cu–NC for CO production was attributed to the instability of Cu–Nx at higher overpotentials (more than 0.6 V vs. RHE), eliciting the sudden conversion of Cu2+/Cu+ to copper NPs. Furthermore, Mn– and Fe–NC, having powerful binding to CO intermediate, enabled them to produce methane. Another study discussed a novel route to tailor the ECR characteristics of the alloyed carbons via the doping of suitable secondary heteroatoms. An efficient approach was developed by Li et al. to tune the catalytic reduction of CO2 using N-doped-C by employing a single sulphur atom and the combined doping of nitrogen and sulphur atoms.75 Electrochemical investigations demonstrated that layers of combined doped NS-carbon displayed high selectivity and activity for CO formation at significantly low values of overpotentials compared to that of single doped nitrogen.

It was elucidated that the sulphur atoms acted in two ways to promote the reduction of carbon dioxide.
Firstly, it assisted the production of extra dopants of pyridinic nitrogen as extremely active cites for CO2RR; secondly, it prompted the natural reactivity of graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen by reducing the energy barrier for the production of *COOH intermediate. The synergistic effects of doping sulphur atoms helped accomplish 2.63 mA cm−2 current density and 92% CO FE at an extremely low overpotential of 490 mV on NS–carbon (Fig. 11), making it an outstanding carbon electrocatalyst. The metal center and its coordination state significantly alter its electronic arrangement, leading the improvement of the catalytic activity of MNC NPs.

5. Important products obtained from the reduction of metal-based materials
5.1 Formic acid
Formic acid/formate obtained from the reduction of carbon dioxide is n extensively accepted energy bearer and perfectly convenient for energy storage integrated with other intermittent renewable energy resources (hydro, wind, and solar). Formates exhibit superior energy density compared to Li-ion batteries and conventional fuel cells.39 Many catalytic systems incorporating metal, their oxides and chalcogenides, carbon NMs and their compounds have been employed to produce formates through the electroreduction of CO2.35
For instance, Zhao et al. proposed the selective and efficient formation of formates via CO2 electroreduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 using SnO2 bulk, SnO2 porous-hollow-fiber (PHF), and Sn/SnO2 porous-hollow-fiber (PHF).76 The synthesis of Sn/SnO2 (PHF) consisted of two steps: firstly, SnO2 PHF was produced employing electrospinning, and secondly, a facile electroreduction in 5% hydrogen at 500 °C was conducted to yield Sn/SnO2 (PHF). As per their results, the electrocatalyst Sn/SnO2 PHF demonstrated a high current density (CD) compared to the other two catalysts (Fig. 12), indicating superior catalytic activity for CO2 reduction. At −1.6 V (vs. SCE), the CD of the SnO2 bulk and SnO2 PHF were 3.62 and 10.8 mA cm−2, respectively, whereas, that for Sn/SnO2 PHF was 28 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of the former two catalysts. In Fig. 12, it can be seen that Sn/SnO2 PHF displayed the highest FE (82%) compared to the other two samples.
 Fig. 12  TEM and SEM images of (a, c, e) SnO2 PHF and (b, d, f) Sn/SnO2 PHF electrocatalysts (reproduced from ref. 76 with permission from Elsevier). 
The special porous-hollow-fiber arrangement developed by NPs (12 nm) demonstrated superior activity compared to bulk SnO2, elucidating that the particles with reduced size in association with grain boundaries assisted in achieving the good ECR performance. Furthermore, the integration of the two following facts overall supported the catalytic activity and consequently increased the formate selectivity: (1) the cross-sectional grain boundaries were exposed after reduction and (2) the reduced length Sn/SnO2 PHF promoted the mass transport.
Owing to high conductivity, chemical stability, and surface area, porous carbon NPs based on metal–organic framework (MOF) exhibit viability in several energy conversion and storage instruments. MOF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) is being extensively used as the main ingredient to load the catalysts in order to impede the accumulation of NPs and to ensure good interaction between NPC and the electrocatalysts. Based on this, a novel structure of Bi NPs inserted in MOF-based nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Bi@NPC) was developed and a comparison of NPC, Bi NPs, and Bi@NPC was presented in.77 The results demonstrated that Bi@NPC with a special structure contributed towards superior adsorption and sharp CO2RR kinetics, achieving a great catalytic operation.
Bi@NPC enabled the production of formate in 0.1 M KHCO3, achieving a FE of 92% and CD of 14.4 mA cm−2 over −1.5 V vs. SCE, whereas Bi NPs accomplished an FE of 86% and CD of 2.6 mA cm−2 (Fig. 13a–c). The Bi@NPC catalyst was found to be highly durable for an ECR operation of twenty hours. From Fig. 13c, it can be seen that NPC had a great capacity for CO2 adsorption, indicating that a more active surface was provided by the MOF-based NPC arrangement. Owing to the great Lewis basicity, the N2 doping of C significantly promoted the site adsorption of carbon dioxide. It was considered that carbon dioxide was quickly adsorbed on the active sites of Bi@NPC and this improved absorbability adjusted the extra materials to maintain the successive reduction reaction. As a result, Bi with extremely fine construction on NPC effectively catalyzed the conversion of carbon dioxide into formate. A summary of several formate-producing metallic electrocatalysts has been incorporated in Table 4.

5.2 Carbon monoxide
From an economical perspective, carbon monoxide is an extremely useful product because it does not only have high energy density but also saves the segregation cost in the formation process. The electrochemical formation of CO is considered to be a cost-efficient objective in the commercial carbon trade. CO is also an important feedstock for the production of several valuable fuels, organic substances, and pharmaceutical products. Many catalytic systems have been developed to successfully synthesize CO from the electroreduction of carbon dioxide.
Zn possesses appropriate intermediate energy of adsorption and, therefore, is considered to be a promising candidate for CO2 electroreduction into CO. For instance, Jiao et al. reported small structured Zn-dendrite capable of electroreducing CO2 into CO in sodium bicarbonate aqueous electrolyte and electrodeposition was used to effectively synthesize the metallic Zn-dendrite materials. Fig. 14a portrays that the Zn-dendrite demonstrated two times higher current density compared to Zn-bulk, which was attributed to the large surface areas that could be expected for an ultrafine structured Zn-dendrite. Furthermore, three times higher selectivity for CO was detected for the Zn-dendrite at relatively low potentials of 0.9–1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 14b). As shown in Fig. 14c, the current density delivered by the Zn-dendrite and the Zn-bulk was 14 mA cm−2 and 2.8 mA cm−2, respectively, and 80% CO FE was accomplished by the Zn-dendrite over −1.1 V vs. RHE, thus suppressing the HER.

Pd belongs to the noble metal group and is capable of producing carbon monoxide. A research study analyzing the impact of Pd electrocatalysts having sizes between 2.4 nm to 10.3 nm on Pd/C black compounds on the CO2RR performance was presented by Gao et al.89 At −0.9 V versus RHE, the CO FE of Pd NPs was enhanced from 5.8 to a maximum of 91%, showing an eighteen-fold enhancement in the CO current density as the Pd NPs size varied between 10.3 nm and 3.7 nm (Fig. 15). For *COOH and the adsorption of CO2, the Gibbs-free-energy on the edges and corners of small-sized NPs were observed to be low compared to the terrace sites of large-sized NPs, confirming that the production of CO from CO2 electroreduction was more supported over the edges and corners, while H* formation was not altered for all the three surfaces. The authors suggested that the reduction in the particle size will help to expose more edge sites and vertices, which plays a certain role in promoting the adsorption of *COOH intermediates on the Pd surface and the generation of CO.

The impediments of solid-state catalysts in further enhancing the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction can be overwhelmed by constructing molecular electrocatalysts capable of producing useful products from CO2 conversion.45 The molecular electrocatalysts contain sites of atomically scattered transition atoms and metal–organic-framework and the covalent-organic-frameworks (COFs)-derived catalysts that can be carefully administered compared to the solid catalysts. Zhong et al.90 prepared a bimetallic-centered MOF catalyst (PcCu-O8-Zn/CNT) through the solvo-thermal approach for CO2RR having ZnO4 and CuN4 as the linkage and the ligand, whereas CNT indicates carbon nano-tubes and Pc indicates phthalocyanine. The electrochemical analysis (Fig. 16a and b) indicated that the developed electrocatalyst demonstrated superior catalytic activity (88%) for CO production, outstanding stability (10 hours), and turnover frequency (0.4 s−1); hydrogen and carbon monoxide were produced with 99% faradaic efficiency. The changing of the metal centers (Zn and Cu) and potential helped to tune the syngas compositions, accompanied by several molar proportions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (Fig. 16c). Moreover, CuN4 complexes functioned as a synergetic constituent in promoting protonation and hydrogen formation accompanying CO2RR and ZnO4 compounds displayed outstanding catalytic activity for CO production. Hence, bimetallic active surfaces assisted the synergistic effect for ECR.

5.3 Alcohols
An outline of metal-derived catalysts producing alcohols have been incorporated in Table 6. Gong et al. carried out ECR through a potentiostatic approach by electrodepositing Cu2O over a copper foil in 3 M C3H6O3 and 0.4 M CuSO4 at −0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl. Employing e-beam, Cu NPs were subsequently accumulated over Cu2O.57 The performance of the obtained Cu/Cu2O electrocatalyst was studied in CO2-saturated electrolyte of 0.1 M potassium bicarbonate, employing a mass loading (0.89–4.5 μg cm−2) of different sized (1.5–8.6 nm) Cu NPs. The results showed that Cu NPs, having a diameter of ≈3.4 nm, exhibited high catalytic performance by producing methanol as the main product, achieving 54% FE at 0.75 versus RHE (Fig. 19). It was indicated that H* adsorption increased on Cu and Cu2O by Cu/Cu2O, whereas unsaturated coordinated Cu atoms reduced the CO* adsorption, which contributed to higher methanol formation (Fig. 17).

The doping of single atoms into TMDCs configurations for enhancing their activity for CO2RR is of practical interest for alcohol production. Using solvo-thermal technique, several bimetallic chalcogenides (BMC) such as Mo-doped Bi, Cu, and Ag having different molar proportions were produced and analyzed in.110 It was found that superior catalytic activity was possessed by BMCs of Mo–Bi for the production of methanol with 12 mA cm−2 CD and 71.2% FE over 0.7 V versus SHE in the [Bmim]BF4 MeCN electrolyte (Fig. 18). The exceptional selective production of methanol using BMCs of Mo–Bi was due to the immediate formation of [Bmim-CO2]+ compound through H2 bonding, which regulated the decline of the reaction energy barrier, and the combined influence of Mo and Bi, whereby Bi promoted the formation of CO and Mo-anchored H* production, integrated with the produced CO, and  radical's stabilization on Bi-facets with the help of an ionic liquid.

Munir et al. studied ECR using Cu–ZnO, Cu–Cu2O–ZnO, Cu-TO, and Cu–Cu2O electrodes fabricated through electrodeposition.111 At −1.7 V, superior faradaic efficiency was demonstrated by Cu–ZnO (97%), producing methanol as the main product along with formate, acetone, and n-propanol, while Cu–Cu2O–ZnO exhibited the selective formation of methanol. The authors believed that chemical characteristics of Cu–Zn significantly influenced the formation of C3 products and the high FE production of these chemicals was found to be linked with quick C–C–C binding at the copper-zinc interface. The theoretical investigations revealed that C–C binding was more supported by the CuO facets instead of Cu2O. Furthermore, the morphological and elemental properties of the cathodic material manifested that CH3OH production appears to progress through oxygen association of carbon dioxide to the Cu–Cu2O face with (100) surfaces, whereas C-coordination was anchored on Cu-TO having (111) open facets, yielding CuO sites. After ECR, the presence of ZnO nano-flowers on the Cu–ZnO catalyst was due to these mechanisms that lead to acetone and propanol, incorporating a chemical reaction similar to the transfer of electron.
5.4 Hydrocarbons
The development of highly effective catalytic systems also requires comprehending the dynamic structural variations of electrocatalysts in the course of ECR, which still lacks more research investigations. Chang et al. studied a system incorporating Cu-NWs with different amounts of Ag-modifications (Cu40Ag60, Cu68Ag32, and Cu89Ag11) as a catalyst for CO2 electroreduction in an H-type cell.122 Among other synthesized catalysts, Cu68Ag32 NWs demonstrated superior catalytic activity and selectivity for methane, achieving 60% FE at −1.17 V versus RHE, which is three times greater compared to that of Cu-NWs and Ag-NWs produced carbon monoxide with 56% FE (Fig. 19). Their results illustrated that some dynamic structural variations from the separation stage to alloy formation were observed during CO2RR. The inter-diffusion driven by dynamic re-oxidation was found to support the combination of CuAg, which decreased the metallic Cu re-oxidation and introduced suitable tensile strain accompanied by the d-band, which consolidated the *CHO interaction for the reduction and subsequently restricted unwanted HER, resulting in outstanding selective production of methane. Hoang et al. prepared bimetallic CuAg NW alloys (Fig. 20a–c) using an electrodeposition technique having diamino-triazole for the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons.123 The induction of an appropriate amount of silver onto copper material regulated the surface strain with the production of Cu2O and silver assisted in the production of extra CO, which was further processed on nearby Cu faces to produce ethylene. The electrocatalytic activity of CuAg NWs was analyzed employing an electrolyzer using potassium hydroxide, delivering a 60% FE and 300 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V versus RHE for ethylene production. Moreover, Cu and Ag in CuAg-poly catalysts that did not have DAT were completely separated, while those in CuAg NWs catalysts were uniformly mixed. Fig. 20d and e display that low current density and faradaic efficiency were demonstrated by CuAg-poly catalysts for hydrocarbons production compared to CuAg-NWs and Cu-wire. It was attributed to the small size of CuAg-NWs and Cu-wire particles because their non-porous surfaces, which contributed to edges with under-coordinated atoms that were found to be highly active for the formation of C2 products. The presence of edges promoted the adsorption of C1 species and supported their dimerization to produce C2 hydrocarbons.

Mostly, metallic catalysts generate C1 products such as CO and HCOO−; however, the formation of several C2 hydrocarbons can only be accomplished using copper-based electrocatalysts.124 The morphological influence of copper mesoporous catalysts having homogenously controlled pore characteristics and fabricated using thermal deposition on the selective formation of C2 chemicals, particularly ethane or ethylene, was presented by Yang et al.125 Cu meshes incorporating mesopores of different sizes were synthesized employing a sputtering process over anodized Al2O3. All the electrodes displayed the same catalytic performance from −0.5 to −2.0 V (Fig. 21a). The 30/40 nm and 30/70 nm catalyst displayed the highest FE of (38%) for ethylene and (38%) for ethane, respectively. On the other hand, the FE of methane was maximum when polycrystalline Cu was used (Fig. 21b). The authors proposed that morphology-derived reaction kinetics affected both the flow field and local pH, tuning the C–C bonding reaction and increasing the retention duration. An outline of metal-derived catalysts producing different hydrocarbons have been incorporated in Table 7.

6. Nanostructures controlling techniques
It is widely accepted that catalysts having different nanostructures (NS) exhibit disparate performances in CO2RR. Hence, the development of synthetic approaches to design suitable nanocrystals structures can significantly increase the catalytic activities. Keeping in view the interaction between structure and performance, it can be considered that each CO2RR requires a catalyst with certain characteristics such as optimal size, morphology, and structure. Consequently, it is crucial to synthesize an electrocatalyst having an appropriate configuration. The establishment of an appropriate synthetic approach to fabricate suitable catalysts is highly supportive to explain the impact of the structure on the ECR performance and determining an efficient structure. In the next sections, we have described different commonly-adopted synthetic approaches to fabricate various kinds of nanostructures (NS), especially those configurations that are generally analyzed in catalytic operations.
6.1 Seed-moderated growth (SMG)
This seeding approach is a conventional technique in crystal development to either circumvent impulsive nucleation or to detach nucleation from crystal development (Fig. 22). This seeding approach has been widely utilized to produce different metal NPs having outstanding monodispersity in the early 90s. Different researchers have established seed-mediated growth (SMG) technique into a definitive and flexible technique to administer the shape profiles of silver and gold nanocrystals (NC).140,141 The SMG technique is a model illustration of nucleation processes involving two parts: the formation of the seed NPs and their successive development into growth solutions having metal precursors, shape-directing, and reducing reagents.142 The addition of already formed seeds to a growth solution can assist the effective separation of NC growth and nucleation as different production steps. The metal reduction activation energy over the already formed seeds is usually low compared to the homogenous nucleation of seed grains in solution; hence, it only permits the autocatalytic development of metal atoms over the already present seeds. For example, infinitesimally small rods of silver could be prepared by including small silver grains to a growth solution having AgNO3, ascorbic acid, and HAuCl4. The production of Au+ from Au3+ reduction was caused by ascorbic acid and finally, the nanorods were formed by seed addition, which reduced Au+ to Au0.143 The SMG technique is a highly effective and flexible approach to produce metal nanostructures (NS) with manageable shapes and sizes. It is distinctly beneficial as it permits a thoughtful structure by way of sensibly selecting seed NPs and ornately influencing the crystal development. Put differently, it is quite feasible in SMG to optimize the operation of NC development, keeping the seed production unaffected. Hence, a long-range of growth conditions incorporating low temperatures, aqueous solution, and reducing agents can be chosen to enable the separation of the factors that influence the growth and nucleation of metal NC with different shape profiles and have a good comprehension of their working process.
 Fig. 22  Seed-moderated growth (reproduced from ref. 139 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry). 
The SMG technique is a typical production pathway to produce nanodendrites (NDs) that have been widely studied in terms of catalytic reactions since the structure produces more lattice stress, atoms, and surface area. Yeo et al. reported a new synthetic technique for platinum NDs through Au-SMG in a nanosphere, which was operated as a small reactor, offering a highly suitable reaction environment for the development of Pt NCs.144 Pt was placed and developed on Ag NCs seeds in the nanosphere. Pt NDs over Au NCs were produced when Au@h-SiO2, L-ascorbic acid, and Au@h-SiO2 were continuously stirred (Fig. 23). Pt over Au-NDs demonstrated higher catalytic activity compared to commonly available Pt black electrocatalysts. The final NS shape was affected by the shape of the seeds, the successive development process through kinetics and thermodynamics, and the kinetic control of deposition and diffusion rates of the metal.145,146 For instance, Wang et al.147 presented a convenient and simple technique to produce Pt-octahedral islands having adaptive densities and sizes over Pd NS by administering the deposition rates of platinum over palladium seeds. Surface diffusion influenced the process when the reductant concentration was lower, inducing the formation of the flat surface over a metal substrate.
 Fig. 23  Production of Pt-derived NDs and hybrid NCs (reproduced from ref. 144 with permission from the Wiley-VCH). 
Contrary to this, the diffusion rate became lower compared to the deposition rate when the reductant concentration was increased, enabling Pt to support deposition on metal corners, thus producing Pt octahedral over Pd cubic seeds. The authors concluded that Pt NS, having a smaller octahedral island over the Pd seed, demonstrated superior catalytic activity than that of commercially available platinum because the Pt (111) exposed surfaces displayed outstanding performance. Many aspects can be optimized to customize the NC morphology in SMG and the seed surface conditions and its structure strongly influences the developed NSs. As discussed above, metal atoms tend to accumulate over those sites which have comparatively higher surface energies. Kinetic control strongly dominates the reduction reaction when the reduction rates are increased by enhancing the temperature by employing a reductant having a high reduction capacity. On the other hand, the absence of the above-mentioned parameters results in the dominance of thermodynamic control. The consideration of suitable synthetic parameters leads to the required structural configurations.
6.2 Continuous growth
The continuous growth method (Fig. 24) incorporates two general approaches, namely, thermal and coreduction-decomposition reduction and has two steps in which the reduction and continuous addition of both the metal precursors derived from the nucleus and metal ions to the nucleus are conducted.
 Fig. 24  Continuous growth method (reproduced from ref. 139 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry). 
A type of continuous growth, thermal-decomposition reduction, is also a strong route for the fabrication of mixed NCs by the production of metal-surfactant compounds that can disintegrate at comparable temperature values and get reduced using a reductant, producing an alloy. This method incorporates the sharp disintegration of metal precursors into An+ and A0 under mild reaction conditions. For example, Lanza et al.148 fabricated intermetallic NCs and palladium-tin alloys through the thermal decomposition of Sn(IV) and Pd(II) precursor complexes in C18H35NH2. Two metals having coordinating complexes and rational ambient temperature were produced by C18H35NH2. When the decomposition temperature of metal-C18H35NH2 compounds was enhanced, they got disintegrated and were reduced to produce an alloy. Furthermore, it is also an effective approach to generate a core–shell configuration that requires more than one metal precursor having dissimilar decomposition temperature values. Metal precursors accompanied by small values of decomposition temperature primarily produce the core and other metal gets disintegrated, which develops over the core to produce the shell with an increase in the reaction time and temperature.149
The facile operation mechanism has made coreduction a promising technique for metal-derived NPs and the reduction reagent, solvent, and reaction precursors can be easily mixed in coreduction. Furthermore, both heterogeneous configuration and the metal alloy can be synthesized through coreduction. The alloy is superiorly produced when the binding energies between the metal M and N are higher compared to M–M and N–N and a core–shell configuration is obtained when one metal is reduced and consequently, the other grows over the surface. Several research studies have reported the synthesis of metal-derived NPs (core–shell configuration, concave structures, nanoplates, and nanosheets) through the coreduction pathway.150–153 Concave shaped NCs (in comparison with NPs having small-index edges) demonstrate increased catalytic activities since many atoms or bends having under-coordination numbers are spread over the surface, possessing superior activity. Although, facets with superior indexes quickly disappear in the fabrication process because of their increased surface energy, which could be greatly altered by the interaction of organic species and therefore stabilize the crystal faces with high indexes. For instance, Jia et al. described a simple wet-chemical pathway using C19H42ClN and C4H11N, synthesized ERD + PtCu3 NCs accompanied by extremely slim, higher energy (110) facet nanosheets.152 The authors proposed that C4H11N adsorption over the PtCu3 sites was found to be very crucial for the production of several NSs and ERD + PtCu3 NCs displayed higher catalytic performances in the oxidation reaction of formic acid.
Other than concave configurations, several other NSs can be fabricated through coreduction since there are a number of adaptable elements such as reaction time, ligands, precursors, capping agents, and reductants, which can affect the final structure. A research group154 showed that palladium-rhodium NCs possessing suitable morphologies and compositions with nanotruncated, nanoicosahedra, and nanocubes could be fabricated via a simple hydrothermal route. Halide anions assisted in controlling the shapes and PVP acted as a capping agent and reductant. The palladium–rhodium NCs were obtained since the greater Pd(II)/Pd potential compared to Br ions and Rh(III)/Rh effectively supported selective adsorption over (100). The developed catalysts exhibited different catalytic activities in reduction reactions and NSs with (100) facets were better as compared to others. From some perspectives, it is hard to synthesize metal-derived alloys by way of coreduction pathway since the precursors of few metals have comparatively lower potentials, such as Ni, Co, and Fe, and two metals become conducive to produce irregular configurations instead of the uniform structure.
6.3 Underpotential deposition (UPD)
Although the above-mentioned two approaches have numerous benefits, these methods cannot be effectively exercised to control many developing atomic layers over the substrate. UPD is an excellent approach to form a metal layer or film over another substrate, achieving the required amount of layers and it can also effectively administer the shape and sizes of NCs. Generally, it is challenging to fabricate an alloyed NS utilizing a reductant when the magnitudes of redox potentials of the alloyed metals are greatly different. However, through UPD, a single layer can be formed from non-noble metal over the noble-metal surface even if the potential has a great value compared to equilibrium potential.155 Using UPD, a self-expiring quick electrodeposition mechanism for the careful development of platinum single layer films using potassium tetrachloroplatinate-sodium chloride electrolyte was reported by Liu et al.156 Li et al. presented a deposition mechanism to fabricate a single layer platinum coating over a vast area of nickel substrate employing a buffer covering of silver/gold.157 It was observed that Pt single layer deposition mechanism was undoubtedly self-ending for complete single layer platinum and further deposition over the Pt surface was avoided by H2, which was accumulated over the surface. The catalytic performance of the fabricated electrocatalysts was nearly equal to that of the Pt sheets due to the greater surface areas.
Excepting the growth of metal film or monolayer, UPD is a promising approach to fabricate well-defined structures. Silver+, a cationic supplement, is typically used in the fabrication of gold NSs and the structure-determining effects of silver+ are ascribed to the underpotential deposition of silver over the surfaces of the gold particles.158–160 Similar to the capping reagent, silver+ has the capability of reduction and deposition over the gold surface, hence affecting the shape profiles of gold nanoparticles. Personick et al. presented the morphological control of gold NPs employing UPD.161 At first, a quick reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) carried out by sodium borohydride in cetyltrimethylammonium chloride yielded gold seeds that were added in the growth solutions, in which H2Asc, HAuCl4, HCl, and AgNO3 were sequentially added. Gold NCs with different shape profiles were obtained when different proportions of silver+/gold3+ were employed (Fig. 25).
 Fig. 25  Different synthesized nanocrystals (a–d) obtained from varying proportions of silver and gold (reproduced from ref. 161 with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
It was observed that the surface-energy faces were found to be the highly active areas for gold deposition and their stabilization required more silver coverage. The scenario of UPD happened since H2Asc could not efficiently reduce silver+ when SMG was utilized. The gold seeds supported the reduction reactions at less negative potential compared to the Nernst potential.155,161 UPD enables the convenient reduction of metals and facilitates more opportunities for the controlled fabrication of metal NCs.
6.4 Galvanic replacement method (GRM)
It is a strong technique to fabricate different shape types such as dendrimers, nanoporous configurations, nanoframe, and concave shape profiles (Fig. 26). In the operation of GRM, the metal (M) acts as a reductant and a sacrificial element that gets dissolved in the solution; concurrently, other metal (N) ion having less negative potentials are reduced139,162,163 and the final shape profile is influenced by the element structure of metal (M). There is a significant dissimilarity in the redox reactivities over the surfaces of the elements, hence directing the decomposition location and reduction rate of the other connected material. The fabrication of homogeneous structures requires insightful consideration of the precursor types and the lattice difference between the both metals.
 Fig. 26  Galvanic replacement method (reproduced from ref. 139 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry). 
When the reduction and subsequent deposition of metal (M) are carried out by the disintegration of metal (N), the synergistic effects of modeling and deposition can provide different benefits, inclusive of changing the distribution of the elements over the surface and enabling the production of a more concaved configuration. Many research investigations have reported the fabrication of different shapes of metal-derived (nano-dendrites, Au-derived hollow crystals, Pt–Pd, and Pt–Cu) NCs using GRM.164–167 Qin et al. presented many studies, indicating that the final shapes of nanostructures can be greatly tuned by the capping agents.168,169 They prepared different concave sided Ag-based NCs using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, H2Asc, and NaOH, and CTAC was replaced by PVP to obtain the core–shell structures. The addition of CTAC to the solution led the chlorine ions to particularly connect to the Ag NCs (100) surfaces, yielding the disintegration of silver atoms occurring from the nearby faces. At the same time, AgCl2− and AuCl4− present in the reduction solution get reduced and are subsequently deposited over the Ag NCs corners and edges, having great surface energy. When PVP acted as a capping agent, (111) facets were bound to PVP and, hence, Ag atoms' disintegration occurred over the facets, yielding the nanocrystals of the Ag@Au core–shell.
GRM can be employed to fabricate several shapes including amorphous configurations and it is mostly utilized to synthesize hollow or porous nanostructures.170 The as-fabricated elements carving or retaining during the fabrication process significantly influences the shape control. The reduction of the disintegrated metal ions strongly depends on reducing the proficiency of the ligand and the reductant present in the vicinity of metal ions, leading to changeable elements.
6.5 Other NC fabrication methods
The assembly method involves the organization of small blocks into well-arranged configurations under the influence of dynamic and thermodynamic constraints. This method is associated with thermodynamic balance controlled by reducing the overall free energy of the operational setup. Typically, small-sized particles are inclined to produce three-dimensional channels and NCs having high porosity characteristics via continuous assembly operation since the high volume to surface area ratio of small-sized particles often produces superior surface energy.171 Moreover, nanodendrites made up of PdBi, AuAg, PtNi, PtCo, and PtRh and nanoparticles derived from metals can be fabricated using the self-assembly of metal-derived nanoparticles.172,173
Template-assisted fabrication facilitates the synthesis of nanoporous and nanoframes and provides an efficient route to control the morphologies of different kinds of nanomaterials,174 involving soft (polymer aggregates, gas bubbles, supramolecular micelles, and emulsion droplets) or stiff (zeolites, alumina membranes, and mesoporous silica) templates.175 Although many porous metals-derived NCs can be synthesized using stiff templates, it suffers two major drawbacks: template production and the required metal nanocrystals are withdrawn with the template; however, soft templates prevent such issues since they have been generated using self-assembly and can be easily taken out.176
Selective etching is also a strong approach to produce high aspect ratio concave-shaped NSs from the arranged metal films employing base, air, and acid as the etchants.177 It is categorized into two classes: dry and wet etching. An etchant is provided from the vapor state in dry etching. Typical dry etching methods involve chemical-assisted ion beam etching, reactive-ion etching, and inductively coupled plasma etching. In wet etching, the etchant is provided from the liquid state and can be conducted in an aqueous container such as a beaker.178 Normally, conveniently oxidized metals can also easily get etched such as nickel and copper.179 Similar to GRM, etching can also be administered over several specific sites and facets to produce different shape configurations.
6.6 Remarks
Different common fabrication approaches for administering the structure of the metal-derived nanostructures have been discussed in the above sections. Several factors such as temperature, reaction time, capping agents, ligands, and precursors can be tuned to alter the structural configurations of the nanocrystals. The interaction of the metals' surface structure (size, shape, and composition), their suitable configurations, and catalytic activities were mainly discussed in the above sections. Table 8 provides a summary of different structures (Fig. 27) fabricated through the above-mentioned techniques along with the developed catalysts. Concave NSs are generally fabricated through SMG and selective etching while NPs and nano-polyhedrons having exposed sites can be efficiently generated by SMG, UPD + GRM, and continuous growth method. Extremely thin nanowires and dendrites can be obtained using the assembly method, whereas oxidative etching and template-assisted approaches are extensively used to produce nanoframes and nanoporous configurations. In addition, with respect to the catalytic performance, surface structure and activity have a very close relationship and it can be inferred that each catalytic reaction needs a highly suitable surface configuration. The fabrication of a chiseled structure can assist in comprehending the activity–structure interaction and this can also help in the finding of a possible high surface configuration of NCs, producing a high density of the most active surface for the catalysts. Hence, it is crucial to establish an optimal fabrication approach to produce chiseled NCs shape.

7. Conclusion and future perspective
Much attention has been paid to the electrocatalytic transmutation of CO2 into useful products because it can be possibly integrated with the supply of renewable electricity anchored by sporadic sources (hydro, wind, and solar). The intrinsic characteristics of cathodic material strongly influence the overall performance of ECR. The high catalytic performance of Ag, Pd, and Au-based materials have made them outstanding electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. However, their elevated costs and shortage are big hindrances in using them for commercial-scale CO2RR. Therefore, the development of novel catalytic systems that are inexpensive, highly accessible, and possess suitable reduction properties is the urgent need of the hour. Many approaches have been reported to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity of metal-derived catalysts by administering their morphology, grain boundaries, size, crystal surfaces, and edge defects. As an alternative, the production of metallic alloys is highly beneficial for accomplishing increased catalytic efficiencies.
In the first part of the present study, the characterization methods for material structure and properties, factors affecting the catalytic performance of nanomaterials, and recent technological progress of metal nanomaterials and their derivatives to improve the overall performance of ECR into value-added products, e.g., HCOOH, CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons, have been illustrated. Although DFT calculations have explored the mechanistic comprehension of the selective CO2RR, which strongly depends upon the intermediate's binding energies accompanied by nanostructured electrocatalysts, still, comprehensive research investigations to understand the reaction process haven't yet been completely explored for many commonly-adopted systems. For these, research studies incorporating Operando, Infrared, Raman, and in situ, vibrational spectroscopy, and in situ approaches which are important research areas, should be more ascertained. The details of electronic arrangement and local reaction conditions of particular components of interest can be obtained using X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopies. Correspondingly, Infrared, Raman, and vibrational spectroscopy can more explicitly explain multi-layer configuration, catalyst composition, and the identification of associated intermediates. X-ray diffraction and in situ electron-microscopy can help study the structural details of a group or a particle. It is worth mentioning that the implementation and investigation based on the above-mentioned methods can successfully address the many issues of this research area. Therefore, the development of de novo catalytic systems integrated with novel methods (like machine learning) will not only reduce the amount of time required to perform CO2RR experimentation but also disclose encouraging compositions of the electrocatalyst.
To date, much attention has been devoted to increasing the catalyst's faradaic efficiencies for the selective production of HCOOH, CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the catalyst durability at higher current densities (≈100 mA cm−2) is crucial for industrial-scale up, which is still a basic understanding of ECR in traditional H-type reactor arrangements that have demonstrated several impediments. Therefore, systematic research studies are required, showing the feasibility of metal-based nanomaterials used in industrial-scale electrochemical reactors, achieving outstanding efficiency and high selectivity for ECR.
The activities of mono sites confined by catalysts have acquired great attention. Nonetheless, simultaneous catalysis containing a number of functional facets (not possessed by mono sites) should be further ascertained to acquire reaction prospects. Although early research studies have reported concept validation using the fusion of silver, gold, and copper, more developments on catalytic materials can enhance the efficiency and selectivity for generating intricate useful products. It is highly advantageous to moderately load the metal nanomaterials without altering their electrocatalytic characteristics and maintaining the low cost for commercial-scale utilization. Carbon-derived nanomaterials have been found to be highly supportive substrates to support metallic electrocatalysts since they have a significantly higher surface area, chemical inertness, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity. A number of active surfaces for catalytic operations can be produced using nitrogen-doped-carbon NSs. The addition of single metal atoms into N-doped-C, known as MNC, has demonstrated enhanced catalytic activities for ECR, particularly in the selective formation of carbon monoxide, achieving FE of 90%, which is nearly equal to that of noble metal-derived nanomaterials. Nevertheless, there are very few studies on the influence of combined-doping single atoms for ECR with respect to metal-single-atom-C catalyst. To reduce the operational costs, cheap biomass-derived precursors can potentially change traditional nitrogen and carbon doping metals for the fabrication of MNC catalysts, reducing the carbon footmarks relevant to waste production. It is a promising approach to transform electrocatalysts into gas-diffusion electrodes having their own range of limitations. In this direction, the integration of engineering contemplations with nanostructured electrocatalysts can help devise novel systems operating at significantly lower rates and producing large volumes of valuable chemicals. In the context of techno-economy, CO2-producing sources must be carefully analyzed, indicating whether direct capture technologies or point source exhausts are adequate. The industrial-level integration of CO2 capture and its electrochemical transmutation can also create a major difference entailing efficiency increase and cost reduction.
As discussed above, the electrocatalysts used in CO2RR generally suffer from low selectivity, stability, and activity; therefore, the efficient development of metal-derived NSs is very crucial for the performance enhancement of ECR. The second part of this review focuses on the commonly adopted fabrication methods to produce metal-derived NSs yielding outstanding catalytic efficiencies. For instance, nano-polyhedrons entailing facets with unsaturated coordination and high indexes can be fabricated using seed-mediated growth, continuous growth, underpotential development, and galvanic replacement method. Core–shell and dendritic NSs are normally fabricated through seed-mediated and assembly methods. Similarly, etching and GRM can be employed to synthesize concaved shaped NSs, nanopores, and nano-frames, which possess a plethora of specific surfaces. Besides the fabrication method, catalysts designing also requires to carefully monitor several other factors such as temperature, reaction time, reductants, capping agents, and importantly, precursors, and these factors can strongly impact the development direction, nucleation, and reduction rates, leading to shape control. There are numerous challenges and impediments in the development of nanostructures using the above-mentioned fabricated methods. Hence, it is mandatory that comprehensive research investigations improving the fabrication methods in terms of performance, cost, synthesis steps, and exposed sites of fabricated NSs should be exploited. Furthermore, DFT calculations and in situ analysis should be used to study the reaction operation to elucidate the relationship between the structure and activities, consequently supporting the design of catalysts with required properties. The utilization of big data, machine learning, and computer science in the optimization of catalytic systems can enable the cost-effective development of fabrication methods. The improvement in calculation techniques, characterization methods, and fabrication approaches will surely help to fabricate highly selective, stable, durable, and active electrocatalysts.
