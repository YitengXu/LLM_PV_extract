    , Accepted 23rd July 2020First published on 23rd July 2020AbstractPhotocatalytic water splitting, as an artificial photosynthesis process for producing clean hydrogen energy, has recently attracted extensive attention due to its bright prospects for solving the shortage of fossil energy and environmental crisis. However, it is still challenging to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting because of the unsuitable electronic structure and the strong dependence on the noble metal co-catalysts to date. The development of photocatalytic water splitting is therefore immensely urgent to enlarge the uptake of photocatalysts by exploring novel compounds. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal SiAs2 (penta-SiAs2) photocatalyst suitable for water splitting based on first-principles calculations. Using a hybrid functional, we demonstrate the bandgap of 2D penta-SiAs2 to be 2.35 eV, and its band-edges perfectly stride the redox potential of water. Most importantly, this material possesses both highly desirable carrier mobilities and strong light absorption in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) regions, which are superior to those of most previously reported 2D materials. Furthermore, the free energies suggest that hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are feasible with penta-SiAs2. These extraordinary characteristics make penta-SiAs2 a promising 2D material for photocatalytic water splitting and provide a possible route for the future experiment scheme.
1. Introduction
Owing to the shortage of fossil energy and severe environmental pollution, developing efficient solutions to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources is urgently needed.1,2 Meanwhile, solar energy and water, as the most abundant natural resources on the earth, have not been efficiently utilized in solving the energy crisis. Fortunately, photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as an artificial photosynthesis process that utilizes the photocatalytic reaction in photochemical cells to trigger the sunlight-driven reaction splitting water into H2 and O2 and realizes the conversion from solar energy to clean hydrogen energy.3–5 Currently, numerous semiconductors including CdS,6 TiO2,7 and BiVO48 have been extensively studied both experimentally and computationally for exploring their potential applications in photocatalytic water splitting.6,9–11 Although photocatalysts for water splitting have drawn tremendous attention, there are still some roadblocks to the improvement of solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency: (1) a vast number of current photocatalysts such as metallic oxides can only absorb short-wavelength ultraviolet light and thus present poor utilization efficiency for sunlight because of their excessive innate optical band gap.12 (2) Some of the conventional photocatalysts have unsuitable band edge positions, which make them applicable only for water reduction or oxidation, which is not favorable for an overall water splitting reaction. (3) Bulk photocatalysts usually lack active sites for photocatalytic reactions. To overcome these shortcomings, noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pt, and Ni are usually used as co-catalysts to contribute sufficient active sites to hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs),7 but they can induce hydrogen and oxygen to be re-catalyzed to water. What is worse is that noble metals are not economic for scale-up industrial applications. To this end, it is immensely significant to explore novel photocatalysts without noble-metal co-catalysts for overall water splitting.
Recently, the atomic-level thickness and large surface area13–16 of 2D materials are beneficial to the generation of carriers on the surface and separation of photogenerated carriers.17,18 Typically, in comparison to their 3D counterparts, 2D materials present extremely numerous active sites, high carrier mobility, and controllable interface, which offer a large number of advantages for catalysts, electronics, optoelectronics, etc.19–29 Among them, penta-type materials have been developed as a series of novel 2D materials. For instance, Yang et al. reported a novel 2D material, penta-Pt2N4, with a large direct band gap, high carrier mobility and high Young's modulus, suggesting numerous potential applications in nanoelectronics.30 Xiao et al. found that penta-graphene shows desirable electrochemical performance and it may be a potential candidate for Li/Na-ion battery anodes.31 However, bulk pyrite-SiAs2 has been synthesized under high pressure and validated as a semiconductor decades ago.32,33 Meanwhile, this type of pyrite structure can form a 2D penta structure after cleaving the plane, but 2D penta-SiAs2 has not yet been explored.
Herein, we report a novel 2D photocatalytic material, penta-SiAs2, for overall water splitting based on density functional theory (DFT). The calculated band structure demonstrates that penta-SiAs2 shows an indirect band gap of 2.35 eV. Remarkably, penta-SiAs2 possesses pronounced electron and hole mobilities of up to 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 and light absorption of up to 105 cm−1, which are superior to those of current 2D photocatalysts. By aligning the band edges, penta-SiAs2 encompasses efficient redox potentials for overall water splitting. Furthermore, the calculated free energy suggests that it is energetically feasible for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of penta-SiAs2. Hence, 2D penta-SiAs2 is competitive for the next-generation photocatalysis water splitting applications.
2. Computational method
Our DFT calculations were performed by plane-wave methods implemented using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package code.34 The projector-augmented-wave pseudopotentials were employed to describe the ion–electron interactions.35 The exchange and correlation interactions were treated using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals. In order to obtain more elaborate electronic and optical properties, a HSE06 functional was implemented in this work.36 In addition, the plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV, and a vacuum layer of 20 Å in the Z-axis direction was set to eliminate the interaction between adjacent layers. The crystal lattices were optimized with a convergence criterion of 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV for residual force and energy, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled by using Monkhorst–Pack (MP) grids of 15 × 15 × 1 and 17 × 17 × 1 for geometry optimization and electronic property calculations, respectively. The phonon dispersion curves were simulated by means of a linear response method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package code.37 Moreover, the dynamical stability of penta-SiAs2 with a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell was included by carrying out ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using the Dmol3 package in Materials Studio software.38 The Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA) software was imposed to visualize the models and generate POSCAR files,39 as well as the VASPKIT code was used to process the result data.40
Orientational Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are calculated from the elastic constants using the following equations:41 (1) (2)where c and s denote cosθ and sinθ, respectively.
High carrier mobility is an important factor for efficient photocatalytic materials. The effective mass of electrons and holes can be fitted using the following formula: (3)For obtaining the phonon-limited carrier mobility of a penta-SiAs2 monolayer, deformation potential (DP) theory was adopted and can be expressed as follows:42 (4)where C2D is the elastic modulus along the transport direction, m* is the effective mass, and E1 is the deformation potential constant that is fitted with band edge positions under strain along the transport direction.
The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is an essential criterion to judge whether the reactions can proceed spontaneously in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions for water splitting. According to the second law of thermodynamics, ΔG can be displayed as follows: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEzpe − TΔS(5)where ΔE represents the computed energy difference, ΔEzpe represents the zero-point energy difference and ΔS is the entropy difference between the states after and before adsorbing the corresponding group, respectively. T is the system temperature and is set to 298.15 K in this work.
3. Results and discussion
Silicon diarsenide (SiAs2) has been fabricated, and it shows a pyrite-type structure with a Pa3 space group (see in Fig. 1(a)). We obtained its 2D counterpart by cleaving the horizontal plane and relaxed its structure, and finally a penta-SiAs2 monolayer was gained. The optimized lattice constants of the penta-SiAs2 monolayer are a = b = 5.03 Å, the vertical spacing δ between the upper and bottom As layers is 3.067 Å, bond lengths are l1 = 2.508 and l2 = l3 = 2.308, and bond angles are θ1 = 95.755°, θ2 = 102.63°, and θ3 = 113.750° respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The unit structure of 2D penta-SiAs2 presents a five-membered ring. Specifically, each Si atom is coordinated to four As atoms and each As atom forms two Si–As bonds and one As–As bond with neighbor atoms, as marked inside the red circle. As looking down along the c-axis, the geometry of the monolayer is similar to the previously proposed penta-graphene43 and penta-GeP2.44 In Fig. S1 (ESI†), the electron localization function (ELF) map illustrates the covalent interactions in penta-SiAs2, suggesting robust chemical bonding in the monolayer sheet.

In addition to the geometry structure, dynamic stability is also crucial for 2D materials. The computed phonon dispersion curve shows that there is no imaginary mode in the spectrum given in Fig. 1(c). Note that the highest vibration frequency of the penta-SiAs2 monolayer is 443 cm−1, which is almost equal to that of some existing and predicted 2D materials such as phosphorene (450 cm−1),45 penta- and O-GeP2 (430 and 500 cm−1)44 and GeP3 monolayer (480 cm−1).46 As the highest frequency mode of phonon spectra is linearly related to the Debye temperature, such a considerably high vibration frequency reflects the thermodynamic robustness in the penta-SiAs2 monolayer.
The mechanical stability is also a necessary term for confirming the stability of 2D crystals. According to the Born criteria, elastic energy is related to the corresponding elastic constants and could be determined using the following equation: (6)The calculated elastic constants of penta-SiAs2 monolayer are C11 = C22 = 65.6 N m−1, C12 = 28.4 N m−1 and C44 = 15.2 N m−1, respectively, indicating that monolayer penta-SiAs2 completely conforms the mechanical stability criterion for orthorhombic crystals (C11 > 0, C22 > 0, C44 > 0, C11C22 > C122).47 Furthermore, orientation-dependent Young's moduli (Y(θ)) and Poisson's ratio (ν(θ)) of penta-SiAs2 are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The drawings reveal that both Y(θ) and ν(θ) within the penta-SiAs2 sheet are anisotropic. Young's modulus range from 45.8 N m−1 to 53.9 N m−1, suggesting the robust mechanical strength in penta-SiAs2. Meanwhile, Poisson's ratio is computed with a range from 0.418 to 0.498, reflecting the flexibility of penta-SiAs2 monolayer as a polymer. Such anisotropic and flexible properties could ascribe to the special arrangement of As and Si atoms in the penta-type sheet and can also introduce some intriguing applications in photocatalysis applications.
The average formation energy (EFor) is defined as EFor = (Ebulk-SiAs2 − Epenta-SiAs2)/N where Ebulk-SiAs2 and Epenta-SiAs2 are the energy of the bulk and monolayer unit cell. The calculated formation energy of 2D penta-SiAs2 relative to bulked SiAs2 is 75 meV per atom and smaller than the threshold formation value of 200 meV per atom.48 Thus, it is feasible to extract monolayer penta-SiAs2 from its bulk counterpart. Subsequently, we estimated the thermal stability of the penta-SiAs2 monolayer via performing AIMD calculations. The temperature is kept at 300 K to assess the stability of a 3 × 3 supercell under the perturbation of room temperature. We can obviously see from Fig. S3 (ESI†) that the entire structure is almost unchanged after 2 ps annealing, and just has a slight offset as seen from the top side. That is to say, 2D penta-SiAs2 has excellent thermodynamic stability.
After ascertaining the structure and stability of 2D penta-SiAs2, we calculated its electronic properties by analyzing the band structure, density of states (DOS) and partial charge density. As depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the electronic properties of penta-SiAs2 were calculated as an indirect semiconductor with 1.61 eV under GGA-PBE functionals. Specifically, the conduction band minimum (CBM) lies between the M and Γ points in the Brillouin zone (Fig. 2(a)), whereas the valence band maximum (VBM) locates at the X point. As the PBE functional usually give a narrow band gap of semiconductors compared with its real value, the more accurate Herd–Scuseria–Emzerh of hybrid (HSE06) functional was utilized to convince the results of the band structure in Fig. 2(b). Remarkably, the penta-SiAs2 monolayer presents an indirect band gap of 2.35 eV with the HSE06 functional (Fig. 2(b)), indicating efficient light harvest performances under the consideration of thermodynamics and kinetics losses and restraints for the combination of photo-excited charge carriers. By analyzing the projective density of states (PDOS), it could be clearly viewed that the VBM is mainly coming from the p-orbitals of the As and Si elements, while the CBM is contributed by the orbital hybridization of p-orbitals of As and s-orbitals of Si. Additionally, the band structure of bilayer and trilayer penta-SiAs2 presents indirect band gaps of 1.98 eV and 1.42 eV with the HSE06 functional (shown in Fig. S5, ESI†), which are smaller than that of its monolayer counterpart due to the prominent quantum confinement effect in two-dimensional systems. To give clear visualization of orbital contributions, the analysis of partial charge density is given in Fig. 2(d and e). The partial charge density suggests that the CBM and VBM localize in the p-orbital of the As element and the s-orbital of the Si element. The partial wave functions also describe the orbital overlap between the adjacent atoms in the penta-SiAS2 monolayer. Specifically, the CBM is dominated by σ*4s bond consisting of the As atom, and σ bond formed by p-orbits of As and Si atoms, whereas VBM is mainly localized in the σ bond coming from pz states of As atoms.

Efficient charge migration and separation are also crucial for the photocatalysis water splitting reactions. Herein we adopt the deformation potential (DP) theory to calculate carrier mobilities of penta-SiAS2.42 Owing to the same atomic arrangement of penta-SiAS2 in the x and y directions (see in Fig. 1(b)), basic parameters for calculating carrier mobility are also coincident with each other for the x and y directions. Thus, only carrier mobilities of one direction need to be taken into account here. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), by stretching the lattice in the x (or y) direction, the in-plane stiffness is computed to be 65.6 N m−1, as given in Table 1, suggesting the considerable mechanical robustness. Through fitting the CB and VB with parabolic curves, the effective masses of electrons and holes are computed as light as 0.076 m0 and 0.086 m0, respectively. Moreover, the deformation potential constants (E1) are proposed by linearly fitting the positions of VBM and CBM under uniaxial tensile and compressive strain. We found that the E1 of electrons is 2.82, while the E1 of holes is 1.24 that is about half that of electrons. As a result, the carrier mobilities are calculated according to the former obtained parameters based on eqn (4). Remarkably, the obtained electron mobility and hole mobility are 2.085 × 104 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 8.422 × 104 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of 2D MoS2,49 arsenene50 and GeP2 monolayer.44 Note that the distinctive difference between the mobility of electrons and holes means that the penta-SiAs2 monolayer facilitates electron–hole separation.

Besides the desirable electronic properties, light absorption is an important factor for solar applications. In principle, the solar spectrum reaching the earth is mainly in the range from 150 to 4000 nm. It is notable that the visible light wavelength is between 380 and 760 nm, accounting for about 48% of the solar radiation. Meanwhile, ultraviolet can provide stronger photon energy to solar conversion, but is scarce because it accounted only for about 5% in solar spectrum. Infrared radiation is abundant on the earth but its weak photon energy cannot be efficient for striding band edges since that a sizable band gap (>1.23 eV) is requested for water splitting. Thus, we further studied the light harvesting performance of monolayer and bilayer penta-SiAs2 to evaluate whether this material is favorable for photocatalysis. Here, we calculated the optical absorption coefficient of penta-SiAs2 by the HSE06 method, which is expressed as follows: (7)where ω represents the light wavelength. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption coefficients being parallel to the 2D surface and/or being perpendicular to the 2D surface are already calculated. Specifically, the absorption coefficients of monolayer penta-SiAs2 reach the order of 105 cm−1 in the visible region and 106 cm−1 in the UV region, which is comparable to the absorption coefficient of organic perovskites, GeP3 monolayers and CaP3 monolayers.46,51,52 Moreover, the bilayer shows more pronounced optical absorption than that of the monolayer, particularly in the visible and UV range of the solar spectrum. The outstanding optical properties in the wide wavelength range from visible and ultraviolet suggest that 2D SiAs2 has great potential as an efficient optical absorber in photocatalysis applications.

Suitable band-edge alignment that straddles the water redox potential is crucial for photocatalytic water splitting, that is, the CBM should be higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV) and the VBM should be lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV). By calculating the vacuum level (in Fig. S7, ESI†) and Fermi level in the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential with the HSE06 functional, we carefully aligned the band edges relative to the vacuum level in Fig. 4. The band edges of monolayer and bilayer penta-SiAs2 both straddle the water reduction and oxidation potentials at pH = 0, which means satisfactory thermodynamic stability of few-layer penta-SiAs2 in the water splitting process. In particular, the potential of photogenerated electrons (Ue) between the CBM and the potential of hydrogen reduction potential were calculated to be 0.88 V for monolayer penta-SiAs2, 0.29 V for bilayer penta-SiAs2, 0.19 V for trilayer penta-SiAs2, and the potentials of photogenerated holes (Uh) between the VBM and the potential of the hydrogen reduction potential were calculated to be 1.47 V, 1.69 V, and 1.24 V for monolayer, bilayer and trilayer penta-SiAs2, respectively. Accordingly, penta-SiAs2 meets the condition of band aligning for photocatalytic water splitting, and the layer number of penta-SiAs2 is effectively capable of tuning the band edge.

Given that the strain engineering is an effective approach to modulate the electronic performance of 2D systems owing to the redistribution of spatial charge, we explore the effects of strain on the band edge positions of penta-SiAs2 monolayer by conducting uniaxial and biaxial strain in the range from −6% to +6%. By means of relaxing atomic positions with each uniaxial and biaxial strain, we finally obtain the corresponding CBM and VBM positions from the relaxed configurations by absolute locations of vacuum level and Fermi level. Fig. 5 shows the modulation of band gap of monolayer penta-SiAs2 under uniaxial and biaxial strain. Under extremely acidic conditions with pH = 0 and neutral conditions with PH = 7, the band edges of penta-SiAs2 still straddle the redox potential of water splitting under slight strain except the −6% biaxial compressive strain. Although the position of VBM is above the oxidation potential of water splitting under a biaxial tension of −6% in an acidic environment, this material is normally stretched slightly from −4% to +6%. Hence, monolayer penta-SiAs2 conforms to the prerequisite for overall water splitting under normal slight strain.

To explore how the water redox and hydrogen production occurs over the penta-SiAs2 monolayer, we investigated the corresponding reaction coordinate paths of water splitting. First, H, OH and H2O get adsorbed over 2D penta-SiAs2. We define the configurations whose adsorbing molecule is far away from penta-SiAs2 as the initial state, and the optimized equilibrium configuration as the final state. As displayed in Fig. S8(a) (ESI†), the energy differences between the initial and final states for single H, OH, and H2O molecules are −2.37 eV, −1.46 eV and −0.26 eV, respectively. The negative values mean that these molecules will be adsorbed spontaneously over 2D penta-SiAs2 with the thermodynamic driving force. Meanwhile, the reaction energy of water decomposition on the penta-SiAs2 sheet was assessed to be 2.484 eV (from −0.26 to 2.226 eV), which is slightly large than that of water decomposition on the TiO2 surface but acceptable.53 Additionally, we also assess the thermodynamics of the hydrogen evolution reaction that is decisive for the release of H2. As given in Fig. S8(b) (ESI†), it is shown that the adsorption of two hydrogen radicals, which are far away each other, is a thermodynamic spontaneous process with a negative energy of −1.77 eV. Further studies about the formation of hydrogen molecules on the penta-SiAS2 surface clearly show that it is an exothermic reaction with a negative value of −2.09 eV relative to the initial H-adsorbed structure. Finally, the computed adsorption energy difference between the adsorbed H2 system and the released H2 system is −0.07 eV (from −2.09 to −2.02 eV), which resembles that of the GeSe54 and InSe monolayers,55 suggesting that generated H2 could be easily released from penta-SiAs2.
To explore the driving force of photocatalytic water splitting reactions over penta-SiAs2, we calculated the free energy of HERs and OERs, as shown in Fig. 6. Generally, the HER of water splitting in acidic solutions can be expressed as: (8)where * represents the adsorption site. As depicted in Fig. 6(a), the free energy of adsorbed H was calculated to be 0.72 eV, which is lower than that of the PtSe256 and Cu2ZnSnS457 monolayers and comparable to that of Janus WSSe.58 Although it is not a near-zero value, the external potential of 0.88 eV supplied by photoexcited electrons induces a free energy of −0.16 eV, which tends to spontaneously trigger the HER. Meanwhile, the four-electron oxidation steps of the OER can be written as: (9)where OH*, O*, and OOH* are the adsorbed OH, O and OOH groups, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the free energies of each step are 1.15 eV, 1.39 eV, 1.45 eV and 0.94 eV with the absence of external voltage. We also evaluate the reaction free energy of OERs under the external electric field generated by light. With an external voltage of 1.47 V supplied by the photoexcited holes according to the calculated Uh, the reaction pathway of the OER shows a reaction process with the decrease in energy under light, which means the oxidation evolution half-reaction of water splitting is spontaneous on the penta-SiAs2 monolayer. These results of HERs and OERs make penta-SiAs2 a photocatalyst for over-all water splitting.

The blue lines denote the free energy of HERs and OERs under the external voltage supplied by photoexcited carriers. 
4. Conclusion
In summary, we thoroughly investigated the photocatalytic performance of novel 2D penta-SiAs2 as an efficient photocatalyst based on first-principles calculations. By calculating the vibrational phonon spectrum, AIMD and elastic constants, we demonstrated that penta-SiAs2 has satisfactory stabilities. The calculated results indicated that penta-SiAs2 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 2.35 eV. Remarkably, band alignments suggested that penta-SiAs2 possesses efficient redox potentials for overall water splitting. Most importantly, the carrier mobilities and solar light absorption of penta-SiAs2 are up to 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 105 cm−1, respectively, making it desirable for solar light harvest. Moreover, the free energy of HERs and OERs suggest that it is energetically feasible for water splitting on the surface of penta-SiAs2. These desirable properties make penta-SiAs2 a promising photocatalyst for water splitting and also provide a guideline to prepare an efficient photocatalyst.
