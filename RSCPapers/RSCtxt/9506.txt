, Accepted 28th June 2016First published on 19th July 2016AbstractThree ullazine-based organic sensitizers (QD1, QD2 and QD3) have been designed, synthesized, and characterized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Ullazine possesses some attractive properties, such as a planar π-system to promote intensely the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between ullazine donor units and cyanoacrylic acid or carboxylic acid acceptor units. The tuning of π-spacers and anchoring groups led to variation of the photovoltaic performances. The DSSC based on QD1 with a cyanoacrylic acid and ethylene, obtained a PCE of 5.28%, which was higher than that of QD2 with a carboxylic acid and phenylethylene, and QD3 with a carboxylic acid and thiophene ethylene. The absorption spectra of QD2 and QD3 with the increasing of the length of the π-spacers are blue-shifted compared to that of QD1. The absorbed amount of QD1 was the highest of all, contributing to the highest Jsc of 12.28 mA cm−2. The different Voc values, in the order of QD1 (0.65 V) > QD2 (0.60 V) > QD3 (0.53 V), are caused by the charge recombination rates at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and the electron lifetimes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention since the pioneering report in 1991.1 As a promising alternative to the conventional silicon based solar cells, DSSCs are endowed with transparency, flexibility, low production cost, ease of synthesis and comparatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and so on.2–6 The visible light collection ability of the sensitizers has great influence on the PCEs of DSSCs. In general, sensitizers can be metal complexes such as ruthenium and zinc or metal free organic dyes.7–10 Ru-complexes have dominated the DSSCs market, with a power conversion efficiency higher than 11% to date.11,12 A dye based on zinc-porphyrin, SM315 reported by Grätzel et al., gave a record-high PCE of 13.0%.13 However, ruthenium is rare and expensive. Besides, its molar extinction coefficient is rather low. Meanwhile, metal-free organic dyes have emerged as competitive alternatives in virtue of relatively low cost, ease of structural tailor, high molar extinction coefficients, governing absorption wavelength and environment-friendly properties.14–17 Therefore, recent years have witnessed the strong emergence of research on metal-free organic dyes. Most of the metal-free organic dyes consist of a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) framework with relatively high PCEs. These D–π–A systems exhibited generous and strong absorption in the visible region, good stability and excellent performances. In 2015, the DSSC based on co-photosensitized with a carboxy-anchor organic dye LEG4 reported by Minoru Hanaya et al., exhibited a PCE of over 14% under one sun illumination, which can effectively enhance the electron injection from the light-excited dyes to the TiO2 electrodes.18 In addition, the DSSC based on C275 with an N-annulated indenoperylene electron donor, triple bond as the π-spacer, benzothiadiazolylbenzoic electron-acceptor, achieved a PCE of 12.5% under irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G sunlight.19 However, in order to achieve the purpose of commercial and industrial applications, it still has tremendous work to do.
Ullazine was first reported in 1983,20,21 and was first used to develop organic dyes for DSSCs with PCE as high as 8.4%.22 In addition, ullazine possesses some attractive properties, such as a planar π-system to promote intense ICT, both strong donating and electron-accepting properties, and structural tunability.22 In this study, three new based on ullazine-dyes (QD1–QD3) have been designed, synthesized and characterized. According to the relevant literature, the DSSC based on ullazine with hexyl side chains, a cyanoacrylic acid and ethylene gave a good photovoltaic performance.22 Therefore, we designed and synthesized QD1 with 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains, a cyanoacrylic acid and ethylene which could provide steric hindrance and increase intermolecular distances so that it could reduce dye aggregation availably.23 In QD2 and QD3, we introduced phenylethylene and thiophene ethylene respectively as π-spacers. Compared with benzene, the thiophene can offer more effective conjugation and lower the energy of the charge transfer transition.24 As for electron acceptors namely anchoring groups, QD1 with a strong electron withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid could pull the electron from the donor, narrowing the band gap through the mixing of donor–acceptor orbitals, which promoted absorption in the longer wavelength region and was considered to be facilitate electron injection into TiO2, just like several D–π–A molecules.25–27 In QD2 and QD3, we chose a weak acceptor carboxylic acid. On account of gaining further insight into π-spacers and anchoring groups especially, we have taken up this work aiming at studying the effect of the π-spacers and anchoring groups on the photovoltaic performances. Meanwhile, the photophysical, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performances of this system have been investigated in details.
Experimental section
Materials
All the chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Chem Greatwall Chemical Company (Wuhan, China) and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried and distilled over sodium and benzophenone. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was dried over and distilled from CaH2 under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Phosphorus oxychloride and 1,2-dichloroethane were atmospheric distillation. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (200–300 mesh). All the other solvents and chemicals used in this work were analytical grade and used without further purification. Methyl-4-((diethoxyphosphoryl)methyl)benzoate (12) and methyl-5-((diethoxyphosphoryl)methyl)thiophene-2-carboxylate (17) were synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literatures.28
Instruments and characterizations
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 400 instrument. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on Bruker Autoflex III. Elemental analysis were measured on an Elementar Vario EL III. UV-Visible spectra of the dyes in diluted solutions and on TiO2 thin-films were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode configuration and an electrochemistry workstation. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode; the counter electrode was a Pt electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as reference electrode. Tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) 0.1 M was used as supporting electrolyte in nitrogen-purged anhydrous CHCl3. Ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used for potential calibration.29
Fabrication and characterization of DSSC devices
Fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO) was cleaned, immersed in aqueous 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed with water and ethanol, sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 suspension was prepared from P25 (Degussa AG, Germany) and 1 wt% magnesium acetate solution according to the reported literature.30,31 Then the paste was deposited onto the FTO glass by blade coating. Subsequently, a 3 μm thick 200 nm particle sized TiO2 scattering layer was deposited again by blade coating. The TiO2-coated FTO glass was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, then treated with TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Finally, it was calcined at 450 °C for 30 min again. After cooling to room temperature, it was immersed into 0.5 mmol L−1 dye solution with or without chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (0.5 mM) for 12 h in the dark, in THF:ethanol = 1:4, which is the optimal condition. The sensitized electrode was rinsed with ethanol, and then dried. A drop of electrolyte was deposited onto the surface of the electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode was clipped onto the top of the TiO2 electrode to assemble a DSSC to measure their photovoltaic performances. The electrolyte comprised 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile and the efficient irradiated area of the cell was 0.2 cm2. The current density voltage (J–V) curves were measured by a Keithley 2602 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 standard AM 1.5G spectrum using a Sol 3A Oriel solar simulator. The incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC is calculated from short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the intensity of the incident light (Pin) in line with the following equation:  
The measurement of monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cell was also detected with a Zolix DCS300PA data acquisition system.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The detailed synthetic routes are provided in Scheme 1. The compound 3 and 7 were synthesized via Sonogashira reaction.32 The compound 9 was synthesized by Vilsmeier reaction. The compound 13 and 18 were gained by Witting–Honor reaction.33 The target dye QD1 was synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine. In all reactions, the synthesis of compound 7 is the most difficult, which requires strict feeding sequence and rigorous vacuum. The target dyes QD2 and QD3 were synthesized by ester in alkaline conditions of hydrolysis reactions. The structures of the dyes QD1, QD2 and QD3 were verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis.
Photophysical properties
The photophysical properties of the QD1, QD2 and QD3 dyes were investigated by UV-Vis absorption spectra in diluted (10−5 M) chloroform solution in Fig. 1(a), and the corresponding data were shown in Table 1. The shorter wavelength absorption peaks at ca. 300 nm in ultraviolet region, aroused from π–π* transitions.34 The longer wavelength absorption bands at ca. 400–600 nm could be assigned to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between ullazine donor units and the cyanoacrylic acid or the carboxylic acid acceptor units. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) of QD1, QD2 and QD3 appeared at 530, 480 and 490 nm, and the corresponding molar extinction coefficients (ε) were 2.42 × 104, 3.18 × 104, 2.34 × 104 M−1 cm−1 respectively. Compared with QD1, the ICT absorption peaks of QD2 and QD3 displayed blue-shifts of 50 and 40 nm, respectively. Maybe they were caused by the introducing of double bond, benzene, and thiophene as π-spacers, and a weak acceptor carboxylic acid as anchoring groups. In addition, the cyanoacrylic acid has stronger electron withdrawing ability than the carboxylic acid, which could effectively pull electron from the donor unit, narrow the band gap. The electron delocalization of QD1 was better than that of QD2 and QD3, which led to a higher ICT absorption peak. The thiophene in QD3 can provide more effective conjugation and lower the energy of the charge transfer transition compared with the benzene in QD2 which contributed to a higher ICT absorption peak.35 As above, the absorption onset of QD1 is broadened to 680 nm, in comparison with QD2 (570 nm) and QD3 (609 nm).

Besides, the absorption behavior of these three dyes on TiO2 films was depicted in Fig. 1(b). Remarkably, the absorption spectra of the films were broadened in comparison with their absorptions in solution, which was beneficial to light utilization. The maximum absorption peaks of three dyes were observed to slight blue-shift by 10, 10 and 29 nm compared with those of solution spectrum respectively, due to the formation of H-aggregation on TiO2 films.36,37
Electrochemical properties
To investigate the molecular energy levels, CV was performed in CHCl3 with 0.1 M TBAP as a supporting electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 2, the oxidation potentials (Eox) of QD1, QD2, and QD3 corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), were found to be 1.02, 0.82 and 0.79 V, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which were calibrated by addition of 0.63 V to the potential (vs. SCE) vs. Fc/Fc+ by CV. All of them were more positive than the redox couple (I−/I3−, 0.42 V, Fig. 2(b)), ensuring that the oxidized dyes formed after the injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, and then accepted the electrons from I− ions thermodynamically. So there was a sufficient driving force for the dye regeneration to efficiently compete with the recapture of the injected electrons by the dye cation radical.38 The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) values are 2.07, 2.30 and 2.21 eV, determined from the intersection of the normalized absorption and the emission spectra (λint) in Fig. 2(c). The reduction potentials (Ered vs. NHE), corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), were −1.05, −1.48 and −1.42 eV for QD1, QD2 and QD3, respectively, calculated by Eox − E0–0. Distinctly, the LUMO levels of the three dyes were more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (about −0.5 V vs. NHE), indicative of thermodynamic feasibility for electron injection from the excited dyes into the TiO2 electrode. The Egap between the conduction band and the Ered (vs. NHE) of QD1, QD2 and QD3 are 0.55, 0.98 and 0.92 eV, respectively. Theoretically, an energy gap of 0.2 eV is necessary for efficient electron injection. Therefore, the three dyes were considered to have proper electronic energy levels as promising sensitizers in DSSCs.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
In order to gain more insight into the molecular geometries and electronic distribution of the three dyes, the optimized structures of three dyes were calculated geometrically using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The optimized structures with torsion angles and electron densities of HOMOs and LUMOs of the dyes are shown in Table 3. In the optimized structures, the torsion angles between the ullazine donor and the acceptor, the acceptor and the π spacer, the donor and π spacer were similar, all of which were very small. It demonstrated that all of them possessed good planarity. In dye system, the planar structure could enhance the aromatic character of the heterocyclic atom, increasing the degree of electronic resonance between donor and acceptor moieties in the dye molecules and facilitating the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. However, it increased the stacking of the dye molecules, resulting in more dye aggregation and electron recombination.39

As indicated from Table 3, the HOMO values of the three dyes were of π-character, and the LUMO values of the three dyes are of π*-character.27 Besides, the HOMO value of QD1 was delocalized over the entire molecule, the HOMO values of QD2 and QD3 were delocalized over the donor units and π-spacers. The LUMO values of all of the three dyes are delocalized over the entire molecules. Hence, the electronic transitions originates from π–π* excitations and intramolecular charge transfer. The results indicated that the electrons of QD1 might be easily transferred from the donor to the acceptor than that of QD2 and QD3.
Photovoltaic properties of the DSSC devices
The photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of DSSCs and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra based on QD1, QD2 and QD3 are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, and the detailed results are summarized in Table 4. As we all know, CDCA can work as an anti-aggregation compound to improve the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, we studied the performance in the DSSC devices with CDCA as the co-adsorbents. From the Table 4, the photovoltaic performances of the three dyes have all been improved when added the CDCA. As we can see from Fig. 4, the IPCE value of QD1 was in the wavelength range of 300–750 nm, with the maximum IPCE value of 80% at 520 nm; the IPCE of QD2 was in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm, with the maximum IPCE value of 20% at 466 nm; the IPCE of QD3 was in the wavelength range of 300–655 nm, with the maximum IPCE value of 19% at 464 nm. The IPCE value of QD1 over 60% was in the wavelength range from 451 to 606 nm, while the IPCE values of QD2 and QD3 over the entire wavelength range did not exceed 30% and 20%, respectively. In addition, the IPCE value and the Jsc of QD1 were consistent with the absorption spectrum in solution and on TiO2 film. The absorbed amounts (Γ) of the three dyes on TiO2 films were shown in Table 1. The Γ values of three dyes (QD1, QD2, QD3) were 5.02 × 10−8, 3.61 × 10−8, 3.61 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively. It suggested that QD1 had the best light-harvesting ability on TiO2 film contributing to a high Jsc. The cells based on QD1, QD2, QD3 gave a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.28, 3.82, 2.98 mA cm−2. Obviously, the Jsc of QD1-based device was the highest of all, which was in good accordance with the Jsc variation in J–V measurements, absorption spectra and the absorbed amounts. As for Voc, they were in the order of QD1 > QD2 > QD3, which may cause by the difference of charge recombination rate at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In a word, QD1, QD2 and QD3 yielded a moderate power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.28%, 1.30% and 1.05% respectively.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies
To illustrate the difference in Voc and investigate the interfacial charge transfer process, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were performed in the dark. Usually, the Nyquist plot of the dye has two semicircles, the small semicircle (Rce, in high frequency) is related to the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the big semicircle (Rrec, in intermediate frequency) is attributed to the charge transfer at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.40 As we can see from the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 5, all of them had only one semicircle, which was assigned to the charge transfer at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.41 The charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface was not observed because of the quick redox reaction of I− at the platinum counter electrode.42 Maybe the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode, was too small compared with that at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.41 The Rrec was estimated by the large semicircle width, and a large Rrec meant a small dark current and a low charge recombination rate. The Rrec values for QD1, QD2 and QD3 were estimated to 89 Ω, 64 Ω and 44 Ω, respectively. Apparently, the Rrec of QD1 was the largest, which could effectively suppress the charge recombination between injected electron and electron acceptor in the electrolyte, contributing to a higher Voc.43 Besides, a big Rrec was beneficial to improve charge generation and transport, contributing to a higher Jsc.44 When the donor of the three dyes were the same, the electron withdrawing of the acceptor of QD1 was the strongest, the π-spacer of QD1 was the shortest, so the charge transport of QD1 were the more effective. Therefore, the DSSC based on QD1 had the highest Jsc. These results were in accord with that of Voc and Jsc shown in Table 4.
 Fig. 5  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on QD1, QD2 and QD3 measured in the dark. 
The Bode plots for the DSSCs based on QD1, QD2 and QD3 are shown in Fig. 6 with only one semicircle, which is located at intermediate frequency correspond to the large semicircle. The peaks represented the charge transfer at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, whose reciprocal of the peak frequency was regarded as the electron lifetime. As we can see from Fig. 6, the electron lifetimes of the three dyes were in the order of QD1 > QD2 > QD3, which was in consistent with the Voc. The longer the electron lifetime, the smaller of the electron recombination and the dark current, which contributed to a higher Voc.45 From the Table 3, we found that the planarity of QD2 and QD3 were better than that of QD1, which might caused more dye aggregation and electron recombination. Evidently, this was consistent with our test results and the Nyquist plots.

Conclusions
A series of new organic dyes QD1, QD2 and QD3 containing the ullazine unit has been designed and synthesized. The acceptors as well as the anchoring groups were cyanoacrylic acid in QD1, carboxylic acid in QD2 and QD3. The π-spacers were ethylene in QD1, phenylethylene in QD2 and thiophene ethylene in QD3. When the donor unit of the three dyes were same, the DSSCs based on QD1 showed the highest Jsc (12.28 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.65 V) due to the strongest electron acceptor, the shortest π-spacer, which result in more effective charge transport than that of QD2 and QD3. It was worth mentioning that the absorption spectrum of QD1 was red-shifted than that of QD2 and QD3, the IPCE value of QD1 and the absorbed amounts were the highest of all. The order of the Voc was QD1 > QD2 > QD3, which was consistent with the EIS Nyquist plots and the EIS Bode plots. This was caused by the different charge recombination rates at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and the electron lifetimes. Among the three dyes, the QD1-based cell showed the highest η of 5.28%.
