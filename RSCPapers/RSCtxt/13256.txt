    , Accepted 21st October 2016First published on 2nd November 2016AbstractTandem architectures using organic/inorganic hybrid semiconductors are a promising strategy to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction (SJ) solar cells as already demonstrated in III–V compound semiconductors. Here, we present a highly-efficient dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)/silicon (Si) monolithic tandem cell by utilizing PEDOT:FTS as an interfacial catalytic layer, which has higher transparency and lower charge-transfer resistance compared to conventional Pt. In addition, the amount of dye adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles is fine-tuned for precise current matching between the two sub-cells. Based on these rational approaches, the DSSC/Si tandem cell exhibited a much higher power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% compared to the stand-alone SJ devices of DSSCs (−11.4%) or Si (−12.3%) cells. The PCE of the best tandem cell is 18.1%. To the best of our knowledge, our tandem cell has a record-high PCE among all tandem cells involving DSSCs and also the highest improvement of PCE among all tandem cells based on dissimilar photovoltaic materials. The 2-terminal DSSC/Si tandem solar cells exhibit a high Voc value of 1.36 V. The DSSC/Si tandem solar cells are externally connected to a Pt electro-catalyst for use as water splitting cells. Solar-to-hydrogen conversion was accomplished at 0.65 V vs. Pt bias. We expect that a tandem architecture based on organic–inorganic hybrid materials can provide a promising way to realize low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices for solar cells and hydrogen generation.

Broader context
The Si photovoltaics industry is one of the most promising energy industries. There is a method to add inexpensive top solar cells to crystalline silicon (c-Si) bottom solar cells to overcome the theoretical efficiency. The advantages of dye sensitized materials include their adjustable band gap and easy synthesis process. In this work, we fabricated a 2-terminal DSSC/Si tandem solar cell by developing an ITO/PEDOT:FTS tunnel junction that facilitates carrier charge recombination between the DSSC and c-Si sub-cells. In addition, there are also consequences for water splitting due to this low-cost method.

Introduction
Tandem solar cells, dual or more sub-cells with complementary absorption characteristics stacked in series, are one of the most promising strategies to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction (SJ) devices1,2 by diminishing the inherent energy loss of SJ solar cells, i.e., thermalization loss of high-energy photons and the transmission loss of low energy photons. Tandem solar cells are realized in two main approaches, mechanically-stacked four-terminal tandems and monolithic two-terminal ones. From the viewpoint of fabrication, the four-terminal mechanical tandem solar cell is less challenging because the top and bottom sub-cells are fabricated independently and then mechanically stacked on top of each other.3–5
In a monolithic two-terminal tandem solar cell, the top cell is fabricated directly on top of the bottom cell. This architecture has several advantages such as a simple device structure, fewer fabrication steps and transparent conducting electrodes, leading to lower manufacturing costs and less parasitic light absorption.
However, the two-terminal tandem solar cell requires strict material choices and processes for better compatibility, such that both top and bottom-cell fabrication processes and materials have to be adapted for monolithic tandem integration.6,7 Specifically, both sub-cells should be optimized to produce similar current levels, otherwise the tandem current will be limited by the sub-cell with the lower current. In addition, the top cell processing has to be carried out at a sufficiently low temperature as not to damage the bottom cell. Finally, the typically opaque back electrode of the stand-alone top cell has to be replaced by a conductive layer with high transparency8,9 throughout the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Monolithic solar cells based on III–V compound semiconductors10 such as InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs have been demonstrated to possess over 37% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Several other photovoltaic materials, including various polymers, amorphous Si11,12 and CIGS13 have also been exploited for the fabrication of monolithic tandem solar cells.
In addition to tandem solar cells based on similar types of materials, significantly dissimilar photovoltaic materials have also been explored in the design of tandem solar cell architectures.6,7 For example, tandem solar cells fabricated with a-Si and polymers have been demonstrated to show enhanced voltage and power conversion efficiency compared to conventional SJ solar cells. Also, a tandem architecture of a DSSC with GaAs or a polymer is reported to show high voltages of 1.8 V14 and 1.36 V,15 respectively. Recently, Barber et al.16 suggested the possibility of a tandem architecture consisting of a DSSC and Si having a PCE exceeding ∼20%. Indeed, such a combination of DSSCs with Si appears to be an ideal combination due to the optical bandgaps of DSSCs (1.7 eV) and Si (1.12 eV), making them suitable for use as top and bottom cells, respectively. DSSCs can offer a high degree of flexibility in order to tune the optical transmittance to be passed on to the bottom Si cell for optimal current matching by simply controlling the amount of dye adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticulate thin film. In addition, from the viewpoint of manufacturing costs, the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell would be a competitive option, given the advantage of the economic viability of DSSCs prepared by solution processes.
One of the major issues in the fabrication of efficient DSSC/Si tandem cells is controlling the electrical and optical characteristics of the interface between the liquid electrolyte used in the DSSC and the Si cell. Typically, a Pt-based catalytic layer is deposited on the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer, such as Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO). The role of the Pt catalytic layer is effectively to reduce the over-potential for the reduction of redox ions by the photoelectrons coming from the bottom cell. However, the existence of the Pt catalytic layer inevitably introduces parasitic resistance of the Pt/TCO Schottky contact and decreases the optical transmittance, which should lead to a decrease in the photocurrent from the bottom cell17,18 and to a photocurrent mismatch in the tandem solar cell.19
In this article, we report a highly-efficient two-terminal DSSC/Si monolithic tandem cell formed by adjusting the electrochemical and optical properties of a PEDOT interfacial catalytic layer and optimizing the amount of dye adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles for precise current matching between the two sub-cells. Based on this rational scheme, the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell with a PEDOT interlayer exhibited a much higher PCE of 17.2% compared to the corresponding SJ devices of DSSCs (∼11.4%) or Si (∼12.3%) cells. The present tandem cell is externally connected to a Pt electro-catalyst for use as a water splitting cell, leading to solar-to-hydrogen conversion taking place at 0.65 V vs. Pt bias.
Results and discussion
Concept and design of a DSSC/Si tandem solar cell
A schematic description of the DSSC/silicon tandem solar cell is presented in Fig. 1. The top DSSC and bottom Si cell were optimized individually for the best tandem device. For the top DSSC, a FTO substrate was coated with mesoporous TiO2 films with porphyrin dye (SGT-021) as a photoelectrode, in which the thickness of the photoelectrode was optimized for balanced solar light absorption between the top and bottom cells for the optimization of the tandem cell. Next, for the catalytic layer in the counter electrode, the conventional Pt layer was replaced by a highly transparent PEDOT:FTS film, which is better than a Pt layer in terms of device efficiency as well as transparency. The DSSC/Si tandem solar cell consists of alternating light absorption layers of porphyrin dye (SGT-021) and c-Si layers, which have band edges near 800 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. The fabrication process of the tandem solar cell is described in Experimental section. When solar light is incident to the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell, the dye-coated TiO2 photoelectrode in the top sub-cell mainly absorbs short-wavelength photons up to around 800 nm. Because of the semi-transparency of the dye-coated TiO2 photoelectrode, the liquid electrolyte, and the catalytic layer in the counter electrode, the transmitted short-wavelength photons and the longer wavelength component of the solar light are absorbed by the bottom Si solar cell.

Fabrication and optimization of the Si bottom cell

Fig. 2a shows the schematic structure of the bottom silicon solar cell for the DSSC/Si tandem cell. Typically, micro-pyramidal surface texturing is used in the fabrication of commercial Si solar cells for anti-reflection effects.20,21 However, as a bottom cell in the DSSC/Si tandem cell, we utilized a Si wafer with a planar top surface to prevent the leakage of electrolyte solution from the top DSSC.

(c) Energy band diagrams of the top silver grid and the middle silver grid of single junction solar cells. (d) J–V curves of the top silver grid and the middle silver grid of single junction solar cells. 
The front surface of the Si wafer is coated with a phosphorous spin-on-dopant (SOD)22 for an n-type emitter by spin coating and 2 μm-thick Al is deposited on the back surface for a P+ back surface field (BSF) by e-beam evaporation, which is co-fired using rapid-thermal annealing at 950 °C for 1 min.23,24
The emitter surface is then passivated by an 80 nm-thick SiNx thin film deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).25Fig. 2b shows the J–V characteristics of silicon solar cells after the subsequent formation of the n-type emitter, SiNx passivation and BSF layers (Table 1). On top of the SiNx passivation layer, an ITO thin film is deposited using sputtering as a recombination layer, in which electrons generated from the bottom Si cell recombine with holes from the top DSSC. For the ITO layer to be electrically connected with the emitter, we form grid patterns on the SiNx passivation layer by photo-lithography followed by dry etching. However, because the ITO/n-type Si interface is known to be a Schottky contact with an energy barrier of ∼0.65 eV26–28 we inserted a 300 nm-thick Ag ohmic contact layer in order to reduce the energy barrier down to ∼0.15 eV (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2d shows the J–V characteristics of the Si solar cells with Ag grid patterns between the n-type Si and ITO compared to the solar cell with Ag grid patterns on top of the ITO (Table 2).

The efficiency of our Si cells is 12–12.5%, which is lower than those of commercial c-Si cells in part due to consideration for the tandem design; no micro-pyramidal surface texturing for light trapping is applied because a planar front surface facilitates the construction of the top DSSC. Other reasons for the lower efficiency include: full-area formation of a BSF layer provides only moderate passivation effects; exclusive annealing furnaces for the emitter and BSF formations are needed to fabricate more efficient Si cells, because n- and p-type doping of Si is critically influenced even by trace amounts of impurities in the furnaces.
Fabrication and optimization of the DSSC top cell
Typical cobalt electrolyte and porphyrin dye-based DSSCs could achieve their best PCE with a 5 μm-thick TiO2 film thickness with semi-transparent characteristics, which means that this type of DSSC is an ideal top photovoltaic for efficient solar light harvesting from a bottom-Si solar cell.29 Before fabrication of the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell, the performances of the top DSSC and the bottom c-Si solar cell were evaluated independently. The DSSC performance as a function of TiO2 film thickness was measured under simulated solar illumination conditions (1 Sun, 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the performance of the bottom c-Si devices was evaluated under the condition of 1 Sun illumination filtered by the top DSSC (Fig. S2, ESI†). The tables of Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show the numerical parameters of the J–V curves. Current matching for the prevention of charge carrier loss in the tandem device was observed when approximately 4 μm-thick TiO2 was coated with SGT-021 dye.30,31
To transmit more photons from solar light to the bottom c-Si solar cell after the light having been filtered by the top DSSC, optimization of the catalytic layer is critical from the view point of efficiency and transparency of the DSSC. In this study, a PEDOT:FTS conductive polymer was selected to replace Pt as the counter electrode because of its tunable catalytic activity via controlling the amount of retardant during the synthesis (see Experimental section). Investigation of the effectiveness of the film thickness of PEDOT:FTS on cobalt-electrolyte oxidation and reduction was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and through the generation of Tafel-polarization curves for the symmetrical dummy-cells. 100 nm-thick PEDOT:FTS presented the best performance (Fig. S3, ESI†). A 100 nm-thick film showed enough transmittance for use in a tandem device. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values of the 100 nm PEDOT:FTS layer exhibited the lowest Rct in the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple. From the Tafel-polarization curves, the slope of a tangent to the 100 nm thick PEDOT:FTS dummy-cell line showed the highest exchange current density (J0). We compared the catalytic activity of the 100 nm-thick PEDOT:FTS film with that of Pt using EIS of symmetrical dummy-cells as shown in Fig. 3a. The EIS parameters obtained by fitting the data are listed in Table 3. The Rct value of the Pt dummy-cell was high, 4.88 Ω cm2, which is much larger than that of PEDOT (1.22 Ω cm2) in the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple, while serial resistance (Rs) was similar for both the symmetrical dummy-cells. Tafel-polarization curves of the 100 nm-thick PEDOT:FTS film and the Pt dummy-cells are shown in Fig. 3b. The plots show current density as a function of potential for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple, in which the slope of a tangent to the conductive polymer dummy-cell curve showed a higher J0. This result is in accordance with the EIS observations. Fig. 3c displays the total transmittance of the PEDOT and Pt layers on glass substrates. The 100 nm-thick PEDOT layer exhibited higher transmittance in the wavelength range of 300 to 1000 nm in comparison with the conventional Pt layer. Also, there are transmittance and photo images of the different thickness of PEDOT:FTS layers on glass substrates (Fig. S3, ESI†). As the amount of retardant increased, the PEDOT layer formed a thinner and rougher layer on the glass substrate, leading to an increase in transmittance of the PEDOT layer.

The morphology of the PEDOT layers depends on the amount of retardant, as shown in Fig. S4 (see ESI†). Fig. 3d shows the J–V characteristics of DSSCs with PEDOT and Pt counter electrodes (CEs). The numerical parameters can be found in Table 4. The DSSC with the PEDOT CE exhibited higher Jsc (16.78 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.903 V) values than those of the Pt CE (Fig. S5, ESI†). This result indicates that the PEDOT layer is more suitable than the Pt layer for application as an interlayer of the tandem solar cell due to its better catalytic activity and electrical and optical properties.

Fabrication and performance of the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell

Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics of the external and internal DSSC/Si tandem solar cells. Table 5 shows the numerical parameters of the J–V curves. The external tandem solar cell shows a PCE of 15.4% with a Voc of 1.34 V, a Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.0%. The measured Voc of the external tandem cell (1.34 V) was in good agreement with the sum of the individual Voc values for the DSSC and Si solar cells (1.43 V). The value of Jsc for the external tandem device (17.1 mA cm−2) was slightly higher than that of the DSSC (16.78 mA cm−2). On the other hand, a Voc of 1.36 V and Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 of the internal tandem device results in a PCE of 17.2%. This result means that the ITO layer on top of the Si solar cell can relay electrons from the Si solar cell into the DSSC through the PEDOT:FTS catalytic layer which can act as an excellent interlayer for connecting the top and bottom solar cells with minimized series and charge transfer resistances. In addition, solar light absorption by the bottom Si solar cell in an internal tandem device should be higher than that of an external device due to elimination of the TCO glass as a CE. The J–V characteristics and performance data of the DSSC/Si internal tandem solar cell with a Pt interlayer is shown for comparison (Fig. S6, ESI†). The values of Jsc (15.21 mA cm−2) and FF (66.95%) were much lower than those of the tandem device with the PEDOT:FTS interlayer. To investigate the reproducibility of DSSC/Si internal tandem solar cells, 65 independent devices were fabricated using the aforementioned procedure and characterized. The PCE histograms for the 65 samples are presented in Fig. S7 (see ESI†). The best cell showed a PCE of 18.1%. Also, the energy level diagram of the 2-terminal tandem solar cell is included to more clearly understand the whole circuit in Fig. S8 (see ESI†).

The EQE of the DSSC, Si cell and Si cell covered by the DSSC are shown in Fig. 4b. The wide bandgap DSSC (1.76 eV) exhibited high quantum efficiency from 300 to 800 nm, with a maximum EQE of 70% at about 455 and 674 nm.
In the case of the Si solar cell, the maximum EQE is 90% at ∼600 nm, and the EQE is over 80% from 500 to 800 nm. The maximum EQE of the Si solar cell covered by the DSSC is ∼75% at ∼800 nm. The absorption of the Si solar cell varies with the varying wavelength absorption of the top cell. DSSCs and Si solar cells are suitable for high efficiency dual-junction tandem solar cells which require bottom cell Eg energies of 1.1 eV and 1.7 eV for an ideal two terminal tandem solar cell under the conditions of current-matching.32 Accurate EQE measurement for tandem cells is quite difficult and close attention was paid in order to get reasonable data.33

Fig. 4c shows the PCE of tandem cells involving a DSSC as a top or bottom cell published so far.14,17,34,35 In Table 6 the PCEs of the top, bottom and tandem cells are summarized along with the efficiency improvement and interlayer materials used in those publications. Our internal tandem cell has the highest PCE among all DSSC-based tandem cells. More importantly, the efficiency improvement of our tandem cell is also the highest, which means that the tandem pair of DSSC and Si cell is perfectly loss-less due to the use of a high-transparency and low-resistance PEDOT interlayer and due to excellent current matching. We also compare the efficiencies and efficiency improvements of all the different tandem cells based on dissimilar photovoltaic materials (Fig. 4d and Table 7) and find that our tandem cell still has the highest efficiency improvement.6,13,36

Solar water splitting by the DSSC/Si tandem solar cell for hydrogen production

Fig. 5a shows the polarization curves of water oxidation plotted against potential for the tandem cell Pt-series, with a pristine Pt catalyst as a reference. The required potential for water oxidation in the tandem cell Pt-series under light illumination (AM 1.5G) was significantly reduced to 0.68 V from the original value of 1.62 V for electrolysis without the assistance of a solar cell in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and achieved an approximate saturated current density starting from 1.26 V vs. Pt. The negative (∼0.94 V) shift for water oxidation is consistent with the Voc of the tandem cell, indicating that the chemical energy from water splitting, to some extent, is efficiently shared by a series connected solar cell in a circuit upon light illumination. The water splitting efficiency, as a function of the theoretical electron number calculated on the basis of its photocurrent density at 0.65 V vs. Pt bias, is shown in Fig. 5b. Note that water splitting could not proceed in the absence of a solar cell. The chromatogram measurement results show that the values of the gases produced from the tandem cell Pt-series almost overlap with the theoretical values, suggesting approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency.

Experimental
Synthesis of PEDOT:FTS
PEDOT thin films were fabricated on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO)/glass substrates by a pre-solution polymerization process. The monomer solution was prepared by dissolving 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and pyridine, as a retardant, in ethanol. An oxidant solution was separately prepared by dissolving ferric p-toluene sulfonate (FTS) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as a matrix polymer in 1-butanol. The monomer and oxidant solutions were then mixed together to form a homogeneous solution. To obtain different conditions of PEDOT layers on FTO/glass substrates, with different optical features and distinct electrochemical properties, the amount of retardant was modified by varying the concentration from 1.4 mM to 2.8 mM. After coating the mixed solution on the FTO/glass substrate, polymerization was performed at 70 °C for 20 min, followed by washing with ethanol and drying.
Device characterization
The transmittance of the PEDOT films was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453).
Fabrication of a symmetrical dummy-cell
Symmetrical dummy-cells were fabricated from two identical PEDOT/FTO or Pt/FTO sheets separated by 20 μm-thick Surlyn (Solaronix, Switzerland) tape, which served as a sealant and spacer, leaving a 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 active area. The sheet edges were coated on an ultrasonic soldering system (USS-9200, MBR Electronics) to improve the electrical contacts. The cell was filled with an electrolyte solution of 0.22 M Co(bpy)3(BCN4)2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3(BCN4)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.8 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile through a hole in one of the FTO supports, which was finally closed by a Surlyn seal. Co-complexes were synthesized following a previously published procedure.33
Electrochemical analysis
All electrochemical measurements were conducted on a VersaSTAT3 (Version 1.31, AMETEK) connected to a potentiostat under dark conditions at room temperature. The EIS spectra were acquired in the frequency range of 106 to 10−1 Hz at 0 V (open circuit voltage), and the AC modulation amplitude was 10 mV. EIS data was processed using Zplot/Zview2 software.
Fabrication of Si solar cells
Monocrystalline, p-type silicon wafers grown by the Czochralski process were used in the fabrication of solar cells. The wafers have a resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm with a diameter of 4 inches and a thickness of 500 μm. The wafers were cleaned using the RCA cleaning procedure and native oxide was removed by buffered oxide etchant (BOE) solution for 1 min. First, 2 μm-thick Al is deposited on the back side using an electron-beam evaporator for a p+-BSF layer and a phosphorous SOD solution (Filmtronics Inc. model P507) is coated on the front side by a spin-coater at 3000 rpm for 40 s for a n-type emitter. And then this wafer is co-fired to simultaneously form the n-type emitter and p+ BSF layers by using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process at 933 °C in an N2 ambient atmosphere for 2 min 30 s. After emitter and BSF formation, the wafer is immersed in a HF solution for 3 min for the removal of the phosphorous silicate (PSG) layer. A 2 μm-thick Al film is deposited again on the back side of the wafer to form a bottom electrode by using an electron-beam evaporator.
A 70 nm SiNx layer was grown on the emitter surface using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process (temperature of 400 °C, pressure of 1500 mTorr, 220 sccm of SiH4 gas and 50 sccm of NH3 gas at 60 W plasma power).37 To form the top electrode, a photoresist (AZ 5214E) was spin-coated onto the SiNx passivation layer at 5000 rpm and was patterned by a contact aligner (MIDAS 5000), followed by a reactive ion etching (RIE) process to remove the SiNx layer. Subsequently, a Ti/Ag (20/200 nm) ohmic contact was deposited on the top electrode using an electron-beam evaporator. Finally, the ITO recombination layer (50 nm thickness) was grown on top of the SiNx and Ti/Ag ohmic contact by a RF magnetron sputter at room temperature and a sputtering power of 120 W.
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs and the tandem solar cell
The FTO/glass substrates were cleaned in acetone and ethanol using an ultra-sonicator. The FTO/glass substrates were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with ethanol. A TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NRT) was screen-printed onto the FTO/glass and then dried at 120 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air.
The thickness of the TiO2 layer was measured using an Alpha-step 250 surface profilometer (Tencor Instruments, San Jose, CA). A paste for the scattering layer containing 500 nm anatase TiO2 particles (ENB Korea, STP-500N) was deposited by screen printing and then dried for 2 h at 100 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The resulting TiO2 photoanode was immersed in a THF/ethanol (v/v, 2/1) solution containing 0.3 mM SGT-021 dye and 0.3 mM HC-A coadsorbent and incubated at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode was assembled with a PEDOT CE or Pt CE using Surlyn (20 μm thick, Du-Pont) as a spacer to produce a sandwich-type cell. The electrolyte solution was introduced through a drilled hole in the CE via vacuum backfilling. The hole was sealed with a cover glass using Surlyn.38 The detailed fabrication procedure for the tandem solar cell is included in Fig. S9 (see ESI†).

Broader context
The Si photovoltaics industry is one of the most promising energy industries. There is a method to add inexpensive top solar cells to crystalline silicon (c-Si) bottom solar cells to overcome the theoretical efficiency. The advantages of dye sensitized materials include their adjustable band gap and easy synthesis process. In this work, we fabricated a 2-terminal DSSC/Si tandem solar cell by developing an ITO/PEDOT:FTS tunnel junction that facilitates carrier charge recombination between the DSSC and c-Si sub-cells. In addition, there are also consequences for water splitting due to this low-cost method.
