    , Accepted 19th March 2018First published on 20th March 2018AbstractUnlike fullerene derivatives, current nonfullerene n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) electron acceptors can rarely work efficiently with different band-gap polymer donors in polymer solar cells (PSCs). To address this issue, we designed and synthesized a new n-OS electron acceptor, namely m-MeIC, which is proved to be effective with different band-gap polymer donors including wide band-gap J71, medium band-gap PBDB-T and low band-gap PCE-10. Photovoltaic devices based on J71:m-MeIC and PBDB-T:m-MeIC achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 12.08% and 10.93%, respectively. The difference in PCEs between the devices based on J71 and PBDB-T is mainly ascribed to the gap of the open circuit voltage. It should be mentioned that the J71-based device exhibited an energy loss of 0.62 eV, which is significantly lower than the most reported energy loss. For the low band-gap polymer donor PCE-10, the device also showed a relatively high PCE of 8.34%. The different device performances are analyzed in depth from charge transport and collection, to recombination loss mechanism and morphology of blend films. This work reveals that the new n-type organic semiconductor is very promising as a universal nonfullerene acceptor, pairing with different band-gap polymer donors.
Introduction
In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to develop n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors to match the high-performance polymer donors for polymer solar cells (PSCs),1–31 and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs of over 13% have been achieved based on polymer donors and n-OS acceptors.32–36 Despite the rapid development of n-OS acceptors, few studies have involved the compatibility of n-OS acceptors with different band-gap polymer donors.37–39 Unlike the traditional fullerene acceptors such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) that match well with different band-gap polymer donors,40–43 n-OS acceptors have rarely been reported to be applicable to different band-gap polymer donors.37–39
In terms of the energy bandgap (Eg), the polymer donors can be divided into three kinds of bandgap, which are wide-bandgap (WBG, Eg > 1.8 eV), moderate-bandgap (MBG, Eg 1.6–1.8 eV) and low-bandgap (LBG, Eg < 1.6 eV).44–46 A number of WBG, MBG and LBG copolymers, such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexylthio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-butyloctyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBT1-EH, Eg = 1.84 eV), poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-nonyltridecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-C9C13, Eg = 1.65 eV) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th, or PCE-10, Eg = 1.58 eV),42,47 show high PCEs of over 10% when they blend with fullerene acceptors. For the n-OS-based PSCs, it is difficult for an acceptor to be effective with three different kinds of bandgap polymer donors. In this context, developing new n-OS acceptors that can work efficiently with multiple bandgap polymers is of great significance.
Recently, our group developed an ITCPTC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopentane-1,3-dione[c]thiophen))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) system that has shown great potential towards high photovoltaic performance PSCs.48 In this work, we designed and synthesized a new ladder-type acceptor of m-MeIC (Fig. 1b) with 6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) as a central core unit and methylated thiophene-fused ending groups (Me-CPTCN) as end-capping units, which makes high performance PSCs when it is paired with three different band-gap polymer donors, J71 (1.96 eV), PBDB-T (1.78 eV) and PCE-10 (1.58 eV) (Fig. 1a).20,47,49 The devices based on the donors J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10 all exhibited high PCEs of 12.08, 10.93 and 8.34%, respectively. For the wide band-gap donor J71, the highest PCE can be ascribed to the high open circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC), which is consistent with the deepest HOMO energy level of J71 and more complementary absorption. It should be mentioned that the J71-based device exhibited an energy loss of 0.62 eV, which is significantly lower than the most reported energy loss in PSCs. These results indicate that even for multiple different band-gap polymer donors, rational design of new n-OS acceptors can lead to further improvement of PSC performance, and also shine a light on the choice of different band-gap polymer donors for high performance PSCs.

 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme of m-MeIC. 
The new n-OS acceptor m-MeIC was synthesized through a facile Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the methylated CPTCN and m-ITCHO in 82% yield (Scheme 1). The solubility of m-MeIC is quite good in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† m-MeIC displays vibronic peaks at about 628 and 682 nm in chloroform solution, which can be attributed to the vibronic bands associated with the (0–0) and (0–1) transitions, respectively. Besides, m-MeIC shows wide and strong absorption spectra from 500 nm to 750 nm with a maximum extinction coefficient of 2.08 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 682 nm. From solution to film, the red shift of 41 nm is mainly ascribed to stronger intermolecular π–π stacking. Meanwhile, m-MeIC film exhibits an absorption onset of 805 nm (Eoptg = 1.54 eV). Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electronic energy levels of m-MeIC (Fig. S1b in ESI†). The experimental HOMO and LUMO energy levels of m-MeIC were determined from the CV to be −3.90 and −5.54 eV, respectively, which is in agreement with the theoretical calculated energy levels of m-MeIC (Fig. S2 in ESI†). m-MeIC shows small dihedral angles between IDTT and two Me-CPTCN units, which facilitate a high electron mobility.
J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10 showed strong fluorescence emission, but the PL emissions were effectively quenched by m-MeIC, indicating efficient electron transfer from the three donors to m-MeIC. The color of the polymers in chloroform solution displayed an obvious difference from red to sky-blue (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1d, J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10 films exhibited an absorption onset at 633, 696 and 785 nm, respectively, and their corresponding Eoptg are 1.96, 1.78, 1.58 eV.
Wide Eg J71, medium Eg PBDB-T and low Eg PCE-10 were chosen to assess the photovoltaic properties of the new acceptor m-MeIC. PSCs with the structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/polymer donors:m-MeIC/PDINO (perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide)/Al were constructed and evaluated (Fig. 2a), where PDINO is an effective electron transporting layer developed by our group.50 The optimum device processing conditions are shown in Table 1, including thermal annealing temperature and solvent additives. The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices are summarized in Table 1.

The best device based on J71:m-MeIC achieved a PCE as high as 12.08% with a VOC of 0.922 V, a JSC of 18.56 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.6%. It should be mentioned that the J71-based device exhibited an energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC) of 0.62 eV (where the Eoptg is the lowest value between the donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials), which is significantly lower than the most reported Eloss in the literature.51–53 As a fact, the larger the VOC, the smaller the corresponding Eloss. The Eloss of the device based on J71:m-MeIC (0.62 eV) is the lowest among the three devices (0.69 eV for the PBDB-T-based device and 0.74 eV for the PCE-10-based device), which is mainly ascribed to the deepest HOMO level of J71. In comparison with the J71-based device, the device based on PBDB-T exhibited a lower PCE of 10.93% with a VOC of 0.847 V, a JSC of 18.11 mA cm−2, and a similar FF of 71.3%. The slightly lower PCE for the device based on PBDB-T:m-MeIC mainly resulted from the lower VOC due to the higher HOMO level value of PBDB-T than that of J71. For the device based on the low band-gap PCE-10 as donor and m-MeIC as acceptor, a low VOC of 0.798 V, a low JSC of 16.51 mA cm−2, and a low FF of 63.3% were obtained, thereby leading to the relatively lower PCE of 8.34%. Coincidence of absorption between PCE-10 and m-MeIC in the wavelength range 500–800 nm should be the reason for the low JSC. The poor FF could mainly result from unfavorable morphology. Though the PCE of 8.34% for the PCE-10-based device is lower relative to the wide band-gap J71 and medium band-gap PBDB-T-based devices, 8.34% is a rather high value for the device based on PCE-10:acceptors (the Eg of acceptor is close at 1.58 eV, as shown in Table S1†).
Although a previous report has demonstrated that using an n-OS acceptor to construct PSCs with five different donors, respectively, achieved a maximum PCE of 11.03%, an unsatisfactory PCE of 5.24% with the low band-gap polymer donor of PCE-10 was obtained.38 Another antecedent report has also employed an n-OS acceptor to realize bulk heterojunction devices with a wide band-gap polymer donor PDBT-T1 and a narrow band-gap polymer donor PTB7-Th, achieving PCEs of 9.6% and 8.7%, respectively.39 The present PCEs of the m-MeIC-based PSCs with J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10 as donor were 12.08%, 10.93% and 8.34%, respectively, which reflects the universality of the acceptor m-MeIC for the different band-gap polymer donors. The universality of m-MeIC for the three different band-gap polymer donors can be mainly ascribed to its appropriate energy levels for these three donors to achieve a driving force of exciton dissociation, strong absorption and high electron mobility. What is more, the acceptor m-MeIC shows good morphology compatibility with the three donors to achieve favorable phase separation, good charge transport, high JSC, and high FF.
In order to confirm the accuracy of the JSC, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices were also obtained (Fig. 3b). The spectra of all the devices cover the 300–800 nm range. In comparison with devices based on J71 and PBDB-T, the PCE-10-based device exhibited a lower photocurrent response from 400 to 600 nm mainly due to the weak absorbance of PCE-10 in the absorption range. It should be mentioned that the device based on PBDB-T:m-MeIC showed a strong photoresponse with a maximum value of 82% at 690 nm, which is higher than that of most reported PSCs. The JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are 17.94, 17.65 and 16.13 mA cm−2 for the devices based on J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10, respectively, which are consistent with those from direct J–V measurements within 4% mismatch.
To understand the main mechanism of charge recombination in the PSCs, the light-intensity (P) dependence of JSC was measured. In principle, the relationship between P and JSC follows the formula JSC ∝ PS, where the power-law exponent (S) reflects the degree of bimolecular recombination.54,55 As shown in Fig. 3c, the slopes S for J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10-based devices are 0.96, 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. The same slopes for the devices based on J71 and PBDB-T could be a reason for their similar FF (70.6% for the J71-based device and 71.3% for the PBDB-T-based device). However, the smaller slope for the PCE-10-based device indicated that more bimolecular recombination occurred in the PCE-10-based device, supporting its lower FF.
To gain deeper insight into the processes of charge collection and exciton dissociation in PSCs, the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was also investigated. Generally, the value of Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JD and JL are the current densities under the conditions of dark and illumination, respectively. The term Veff follows the formula Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias.56,57 As can be seen from Fig. 3d, Jph values for the three devices are saturated (Jsat) at Veff = 2.0 V, indicating that charge recombination in these devices is minimized at a higher voltage because of the large internal electric field. The Jsat values of the PSCs based on J71:m-MeIC, PBDB-T:m-MeIC and PCE-10:m-MeIC were found to be 19.62, 19.18 and 17.69 mA cm−2, respectively. Under maximal power output and short circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios were calculated to be 0.811/0.946, 0.826/0.944 and 0.748/0.932 for the devices based on J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10, respectively. The lower charge collection efficiency and exciton dissociation efficiency for PCE-10:m-MeIC could be a reason for the poorer JSC and FF. Furthermore, the PCE-10-based device exhibited a smaller shunt resistance (0.67 KΩ cm2) and larger series resistance (9.9 Ω cm2) than the other two devices (Table 1), indicating a poorer ohmic contact was formed for the PCE-10-based device.
In addition to the charge recombination and exciton dissociation, charge carrier mobility plays an important role in the JSC and FF of PSCs. The electron and hole mobilities (μe/μh) were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The structures of the electron and hole-only devices are ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, respectively. In comparison with the device based on PCE-10, the devices based on J71 and PBDB-T showed higher electron and hole mobilities and more balanced μe/μh (Table S2 and Fig. S4†), which is consistent with the resulting larger JSC and FF induced by less bimolecular recombination, and improved charge extraction.
Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was employed to investigate the molecular orientation and packing of J71:m-MeIC, PBDB-T:m-MeIC and PCE-10:m-MeIC. The 2D GIXD patterns and the corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane line-cut profiles of the blend films are shown in Fig. 4. The three blends all showed strong π–π (010) stacking peaks with q ≈ 1.75 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction and lamellar (100) diffraction peaks with q ≈ 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane direction. The π–π stacking of the three blend films in the out-of-plane direction is stronger than that in the in-plane direction, indicating a predominant “face-on” molecular orientation relative to the electrode substrates, which contributes to the charge transport between the cathode and anode of PSCs.

In order to gain further insight into the effect of morphology on the device efficiency, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized to investigate the surface morphologies of the active layers (Fig. 5). In the AFM height images, the blend films of J71:m-MeIC and PBDB-T:m-MeIC exhibited smooth and uniform surface morphologies with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.07 and 1.14 nm, respectively. The close RMS could be a reason for the similar FF values in the J71 and PBDB-T-based devices. For the PCE-10:m-MeIC blend film, a smaller RMS value of 0.88 nm is observed, which is detrimental for the contact between the active layer and cathode interface. As can be seen from the AFM phase images (Fig. 5b, e and h), all the blend films displayed well-distributed nanofibrillar structures around several tens of nanometers in size. Notably, the domain size of the PCE-10:m-MeIC blend film is found to be smaller, compared to the other two blend films. The TEM results also furnished more direct evidence to sustain the different device performances of J71, PBDB-T and PCE-10. In the TEM images, the J71:m-MeIC film was shown in quite a clear image with a large area of tens of nanometers showing flower-type white domains, while the PCE-10-based blend film displayed defined phase separation. The larger domain size of the J71:m-MeIC film may be beneficial for charge extraction and suppression of the bimolecular recombination, thus achieving a higher FF relative to the blends of PCE-10:m-MeIC.18 Compared with the films of J71:m-MeIC and PCE-10:m-MeIC, the bi-continuous interpenetrating networks of the PBDB-T:m-MeIC blends may facilitate efficient exciton dissociation, diffusion, and charge transport, which contributes to achieving the highest FF among the three blends.58,59 These differences in morphology are responsible for the improved exciton dissociation efficiency and less bimolecular recombination for the PSCs based on J71:m-MeIC and PBDB-T:m-MeIC. These results match well with the higher JSC and FF for the devices of J71 and PBDB-T relative to those of the PCE10:m-MeIC-based devices.

In summary, the narrow Eg n-OS electron acceptor m-MeIC was developed. The suitability of the acceptor m-MeIC for different band-gap donors, including wide band-gap J71, medium band-gap PBDB-T and low band-gap PCE-10, was investigated in PSCs. Photovoltaic devices based on J71:m-MeIC, PBDB-T:m-MeIC and PCE-10:m-MeIC achieved PCEs of 12.08, 10.93 and 8.34%, respectively. For the wide band-gap J71, the largest PCE can be ascribed to the highest VOC and JSC, which is consistent with the deepest HOMO energy level of J71 and more complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor. For the low band-gap PCE-10 based device, the relatively low PCE could result from the less balanced μe/μh, poorer exciton dissociation efficiency, more bimolecular recombination and unfavourable morphology. However, the PCE of 8.34% is still quite a high value compared to the devices based on PCE-10:acceptors (the Eg of acceptor is close at 1.58 eV). These results indicate that even for different band-gap polymer donors, rational design and synthesis of new n-OS acceptors can lead to further improvement in the PSCs performance. Also, these results shine a light on the choice of the different band-gap polymer donors for high performance PSCs.
Experimental section
m-ITCHO and CPTCN-Me were synthesized according to the literature.21,36
Synthesis of m-MeIC
m-ITCHO (200 mg, 0.19 mmol), CPTCN-Me (170 mg, 0.8 mmol), chloroform (30 mL), and pyridine (1 mL) were added to a two-necked round-bottomed flask. The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min and then refluxed for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL) and filtered. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:2) as an eluent, yielding a dark blue solid (253 mg, 92%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ [ppm]: 8.76 (s, 2H), 8.13 (s, 2H), 8.19 (s, 2H),7.62 (s, 2H), 7.23–7.19 (m, 8H), 7.11 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 7.02 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 2.77 (s, 6H), 2.59 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 1.65–1.53 (m, 8H), 1.29–1.19 (m, 24H), 0.85–0.80 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ [ppm]: 182.10, 156.01, 155.30, 152.70, 147.41, 147.15, 144.62, 143.79, 142.18, 141.74, 139.55, 138.97, 137.06, 136.98, 136.65, 129.52, 128.74, 127.64, 124.80, 118.54, 114.49, 67.07, 63.77, 36.09, 31.76, 31.47, 29.11, 22.66, 14.15, 13.51.

Device fabrication and characterization
The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited through spin-coating on precleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron PVP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 2000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layer of polymer donors and m-MeIC was spin-coated from its chloroform solution onto the PEDOT:PSS layer under a spin-coating rate of 3000 rpm. The thickness of the active layers is ca. ∼100 nm. Then a methanol solution of PDINO at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 was deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to afford a PDINO cathode buffer layer with a thickness of ca. 10 nm. Finally, a top Al electrode was deposited under vacuum onto the cathode buffer layer at a pressure of ca. 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. All film thickness was measured by the Alpha-Step D-500 surface profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured in a glovebox on a computer-controlled Keithley 2450 Source-Measure Unit. Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (model, Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The input photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. An optical microscope (Olympus BX51) was used to define the active area (4.5 mm2) of the device. Masks made using laser beam cutting technology to have a well-defined area of 2.2 mm2 were attached to define the effective area for accurate measurement. All the masked and unmasked tests gave consistent results with relative errors within 0.5%. All the device measurements were undertaken in a nitrogen glovebox (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm). For the J–V measurement, the voltage step and delay time were 10 mV and 1 ms, respectively. The scan started from −1.5 V to 1.5 V.
