    , Accepted 14th April 2016First published on 15th April 2016AbstractWhile TiO2 nanotube arrays cosensitized with CdS and PbS quantum dots can achieve water splitting under visible light excitation, the use of quantum dots is limited by the relatively slow interfacial hole transfer rate and low internal quantum efficiencies in the visible region. Al2O3 overcoating by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can drastically enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays. 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer can achieve a good balance between surface coverage and charge transfer resistance. The resulting maximum photocurrent density of 5.19 mA cm-2 under simulated solar illumination shows a 52 times improvement over the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays, and more significantly, a 60% enhancement over bare quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency can reach the record value of 83% at 350 nm and remain above 30% up to 450 nm. A systematic examination of the role of the ALD Al2O3 overlayer indicates that surface recombination passivation, catalytic improvement in interfacial charge transfer kinetics, and chemical stabilization might synergistically enhance the photoelectrochemical performance in the visible region. These results provide a physical insight into the facile surface treatment, which could be applied to develop and optimize high-performance photoelectrodes for artificial photosynthesis.
Introduction
Since Honda and Fujishima demonstrated water photoelectrolysis using TiO2 in 1972, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received considerable attention as one of the most attractive approaches for the efficient conversion of solar energy into hydrogen, a storable chemical energy.1–3 The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is mainly determined by efficient light absorption, charge transport within semiconductor materials, and charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.4,5
The highly-ordered, vertically oriented n-type TiO2 nanotube arrays, achieved by Ti anodization, have been shown to be promising structures for water photoelectrolysis.6 The nanotube array structure enables the conductive electrolyte to permeate the entire internal and external array surfaces, providing facile pathways for electron transport by diffusion to the electrical contact along the length of the tubes. TiO2 nanotubes can also facilitate efficient minority carrier transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface because the hole just needs to diffuse across half of the wall thickness of the nanotubes. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is poor in the visible region due to its too wide band gap.
Recently, sensitization of TiO2 nanotube arrays with narrow band gap semiconductor quantum dots, such as CdS, CdSe, and PbS constituting core/shell architecture, has been considered as an important strategy to enhance the PEC performance of TiO2 under visible light excitation.7–9 This core/shell architecture possesses a hierarchical shell with a large specific surface area,10–13 which could provide abundant reactive sites. Due to the size quantization effect, these semiconductor quantum dots have a tunable band gap and band edge, allowing their light absorption properties to be tuned across the entire visible region of solar radiation.14 However, the use of quantum dots is limited by significant challenges, including (a) a slower interfacial hole transfer rate compared to electron injection into TiO2, and (b) low internal quantum efficiencies in the visible region. Challenge (a) results in photochemical instability due to hole-induced anodic corrosion.15 Challenge (b) is a consequence of both slow hole transfer kinetics relative to the rates of surface-mediated electron–hole recombination and the inefficient delivery of photogenerated holes to the electrode/solution interface (due to the recombination of electrons and holes within the photoelectrode). Although an improved incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of TiO2 nanotube arrays has been demonstrated by quantum dot sensitization, apparent enhancement occurs only under irradiation below 400 nm and the reported IPCE values in the visible region are usually still lower than 20%.16,17
Surface modification using metal oxides by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an easy and feasible method to inhibit surface-mediated charge recombination and/or accelerate hole kinetics of the photoelectrode. Given its self-limited growth mechanism, the ALD technique offers a wide range of capabilities to deposit and modify materials at the nanoscale.18 For PEC water splitting, this technique has been employed with Al2O3/Fe2O3,19 Al2O3/WO3,20 TiO2/TiO2 nanowire arrays,21 TiO2/Fe2O3,22 and TiO2/Cu2O23 (ALD oxide/bare electrode), showing promising results. In addition, the ALD technique has also been successfully employed to improve the solar cell performance, including both Si solar cells and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, mostly due to the excellent surface passivation and light reflection properties.24–26 For quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, the effects of ALD layers have been found to be sensitive to the configuration, specifically, whether the ALD layer was deposited before or after the quantum dots.27 Although the ALD surface treatment has been researched on a large scale, to our knowledge, an appreciable PEC performance using a conformal Al2O3 coating on the surface of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array photoanodes has not yet been reported. This is the motive behind for examining the role of the Al2O3 overlayer deposited by ALD during the PEC water splitting process.
The effects of the ALD surface treatment may include reducing charge recombination at surface states, increasing the reaction kinetics, and protecting the semiconductor from chemical corrosion. However, according to previous studies, the ALD layer does not have the same effects in all cases.19,20,28 The different effects of ALD coating on PEC water splitting might not necessarily be indicative of contradictory findings because of the differences in fabrication methods of the photoelectrode and the resulting morphology, in deposited materials and their crystal phases, and in pH values, etc. In other words, the role of ALD coating is not yet fully understood. However, it can be agreed that ALD surface treatment can favorably influence water photoelectrolysis.
Herein we report the enhanced PEC water splitting performance of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with the Al2O3 overlayer deposited by ALD. Co-sensitization of CdS and PbS quantum dots successfully increases the photoresponse of the TiO2 nanotube array photoanode in the visible light region. Conformal overcoating of Al2O3 onto the quantum dot-sensitized photoanode further drastically improves the PEC performance. The IPCE increases to 83% at around 350 nm, remaining above 30% up to 450 nm and above 20% up to 500 nm, which is the record result for quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotubular structures. And the anodic corrosion of the photoanode is significantly inhibited. The systematic examination of the role of ALD Al2O3 overlayers reveals their multiple effects. These include surface recombination passivation, catalytic improvement in interfacial charge transfer kinetics, and chemical stabilization, all of which may synergistically enhance the PEC performance in the visible region.
Experimental
Preparation of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays
Prior to anodic oxidation, chemical polishing on Ti foils (0.2 mm thick, 99.4 wt%) was conducted in order to obtain a well-defined one-dimensional nanotube structure. Afterwards, the Ti foils were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, alcohol and deionized water in sequence. Anodization was then performed in a two-electrode system at room temperature, with a Ti foil as the working electrode and a stainless steel foil as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was 0.27 M NH4F consisting of mixtures of deionized water and glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) with a volumetric ratio of 1:1. Our previous studies suggested that the PEC performance strongly depended on the microstructure of the photoelectrodes, and clarified the influence of the experimental conditions on the geometric structure of the TNTAs.29,30 Accordingly, the Ti foil was biased at 25 V for 5 h. The as-prepared samples were annealed under ambient conditions at 450 °C for 3 h and 45 min with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to convert amorphous structures to the crystalline phase.
PbS and CdS quantum dots were assembled onto crystallized TiO2 nanotube arrays through a simple sonication-assisted successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. Firstly, the TiO2 nanotube array film was soaked in a Pb(NO3)2 methanol solution (0.02 M) for 2 min, sonicated for 15 s, and then rinsed with methanol. Secondly, it was dipped into 0.02 M Na2S solution (consisting of a mixture of deionized water and methanol with a volumetric ratio of 1:1) for another 2 min, sonicated for 15 s, and then rinsed with methanol. The two procedures were termed as one deposition cycle of quantum dots and repeated 5 times. Immediately, the above sample was then sensitized with CdS quantum dots. The precursors were Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution (0.05 M) and 0.05 M Na2S solution. The procedures of CdS sensitization were the same as those of PbS and also repeated 5 times, and the electrode with 5 cycles of PbS and 5 cycles of CdS exhibits the best synergy effect.31
ALD Al2O3 overlayer deposition
The Al2O3 overlayer was deposited by the ALD method on the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrode prepared above. The ALD process was carried out in a homemade hot-wall flow-type ALD reactor. The Al2O3 overlayer was deposited by sequential exposure of the bare photoelectrode to trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O separated by a purge of nitrogen. One ALD cycle of Al2O3 deposition consisted of a 0.02 s pulse of TMA, 8 s exposure to TMA, 20 s purge with nitrogen followed by 0.05 s pulse of H2O, 8 s exposure to H2O, and eventually 20 s purge with nitrogen. The deposition temperature was 150 °C. To find the optimum thickness, we chose varying ALD cycles: 3, 30 and 100. The Al2O3 thickness on the photoelectrodes was measured from the high-resolution TEM images. The thickness of the Al2O3 overlayer of 30 ALD cycles was 1.5 nm.
Physical characterization
The optical properties of the photoelectrodes were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance and absorption spectroscopy using a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750S). The crystal structure of the sample was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and detailed microstructure of the photoelectrodes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100). Compositional analysis was performed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) coupled with FESEM. The surface chemical composition and states of the photoelectrodes were analyzed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAD 250XI) with a monochromatic Al Kα excitation source. The binding energy of the C1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as the reference.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrents of the photoelectrodes were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium) in a standard three-electrode configuration with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and the photoelectrode as the working electrode with an active area of about 1.82 cm2. Unless specified, the electrolyte is a mixed aqueous solution of 0.2 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S with a volumetric ratio of 1:1 (pH 12.2). All potentials were referenced to the SCE (E0 = 0.24 V vs. NHE) unless specified.
Current density–voltage plots were generated by linearly sweeping the potential with a sweeping rate of 10 mV s−1, and the light source was a 500 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5 filter (Aulight CEL-S500), calibrated to one sun solar (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The IPCE was evaluated using a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C) equipped with monochrome filters to generate different wavelengths. An optical power meter was used to measure the incident light intensity. Here, the IPCE was calculated from the photocurrents measured at 0 V vs. SCE according to the following equation. IPCE = (1240 × Iph)/(P × λ)(1)where P is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity (mW m−2), λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident light, and Iph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at open circuit potential under illumination conditions, with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequencies varying between 0.1 Hz and 100 KHz. The obtained impedance spectrum was fitted to the electrical analogue by means of Z-view software. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution in the dark. All the measurements were carried out under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Highly-ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays are co-sensitized using PbS and CdS quantum dots by a sonication-assisted successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The investigation of the influence of quantum-dot deposition order and cycles suggests that TiO2 nanotube arrays sensitized by 5 cycles of PbS and then 5 cycles of CdS possess the superior visible-light photoconversion efficiency due to the synergistic effect of these quantum dots. The ALD coating of an amorphous Al2O3 overlayer onto the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays further enhances the PEC performance. In this work, we concentrate on the approach of ALD surface treatment and systematically investigate its effects.
A series of SEM images depict the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with various ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer (Fig. 1a–d). Fig. 1a shows that TiO2 nanotube arrays are well-defined and highly-ordered, with a typical length of about 1.7 μm, an inner diameter of about 120 nm, and a nanotube wall thickness of about 25 nm. The quantum dots cannot be observed in the SEM images due to their even distribution without aggregation and their small size which is beyond the limit of SEM resolution. As the ALD cycle increases, the inner diameters of TiO2 nanotubes decrease and the nanotubes become more compact (Fig. 1a–d), indicating conformal Al2O3 deposition along the high aspect ratio nanotubes.
 Fig. 1  (a–d) SEM images of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with various ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer: (a) 0 cycles, (b) 3 cycles, (c) 30 cycles, and (d) 100 cycles. The inset in (a) is a cross-sectional view of the well-aligned quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays without the Al2O3 overlayer. High-resolution TEM images of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes (e) with 0 cycles and (f) with 30 cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer, while the insets are the corresponding low-resolution TEM images which indicate the uniform distribution of quantum dots. 
TEM images in Fig. 1e and f show the uniform distribution of quantum dots on TiO2 nanotubes with an average size of about 8 nm. Furthermore, Fig. 1f shows a representative high-resolution TEM image of the 1.5 nm Al2O3 layer overcoating on the surface of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes. This thin overlayer is highly uniform, smooth and conformal, suggesting that the Al2O3 shell is amorphous. The EDS results indicate the existence of the Ti, Al, O, Cd, Pb and S in the Al2O3 coated photoelectrode (Fig. S1, ESI†). And the atomic percentages suggest the formation of TiO2, Al2O3, CdS and PbS in the photoelectrode (Table S1, ESI†), which is confirmed by XPS measurements given later. Polycrystalline XRD measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†) could not find any alumina crystalline phase on the photoelectrode with 30 ALD cycles of Al2O3, which further supports the argument that it is amorphous.
XRD patterns can only show a weak signature from CdS for the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays. However, the high-resolution TEM images clearly indicate the existence of crystalline quantum dots. The calculated lattice fringe spacings of 3.297 Å and 2.977 Å in Fig. 1e correspond to the (111) plane of cubic phase CdS (JCPDS No. 89-0440) and the (200) plane of cubic phase PbS (JCPDS No. 05-0592), respectively. While the lattice spacings of 1.891 Å in Fig. 1e and 3.581 Å in Fig. 1f are assigned to the (200) plane and the (101) plane of anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272), respectively, which is in good agreement with the XRD patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†). All these results thus indicate that the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer is well coated on the crystalline photoelectrode of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays, and confirm that ALD is a powerful technique for creating highly conformal layers on nanostructured electrodes.
The introduction of the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer on the photoelectrode can apparently enhance its PEC performance. Fig. 2a displays the linear sweep voltammograms. The current densities of all samples in the dark are negligible. Under simulated solar illumination, the photocurrent of pure TiO2 nanotube arrays is as low as 0.1 mA cm−2 at −0.25 V vs. SCE due to its wide band gap. Quantum dot deposition can obviously boost the PEC performance under visible light excitation, which can then be further enhanced by ALD modification of the Al2O3 overlayer. The photocurrent density of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays increases to 3.19 mA cm−2 at −0.25 V vs. SCE, an enhancement of nearly 31 times. After ALD coating of 30 cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer, the photocurrent density reaches a maximum value of 5.19 mA cm−2, nearly 52 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays and 1.6 times higher than that of the bare quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays at −0.25 V vs. SCE, respectively. Furthermore, the largest photocurrent density in this study is higher than that of the bare and hydrogen treated PbS and CdS co-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode in the latest reports.31–34 On the other hand, the enhancement of photocurrent density by ALD surface treatment is found to be strongly related to the thickness of the Al2O3 overlayer. The photocurrent density increases with increasing ALD cycles from 3 to 30. When the ALD cycles increase beyond 40 (not displayed here), the photocurrent density begins to decay and decreases to 3.42 mA cm−2 at −0.25 V vs. SCE for 100 ALD cycles. This may be due to Al2O3 exceeding the thickness limit for electron tunneling (∼2 nm), leading to charge transfer across the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface being blocked.28,35
 Fig. 2  (a) Linear sweep voltammograms measured from pure TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs, black), and quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with various ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer: 0 cycles (blue), 3 cycles (green), 30 cycles (red) and 100 cycles (magenta) under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. (b) Photoconversion efficiency derived from the linear sweep voltammograms. (c) Transient photoresponse by chopped light (light on/light off) of the prepared photoanodes at a 0 V vs. SCE, the light source is an 80 mW cm−2 (dominant wavelength: 565 ± 112 nm) white LED lamp. 
It is noteworthy that the onset potential of the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with various cycles of Al2O3 layers is −1.02 V vs. SCE in all cases except a slight difference for that with 100 ALD cycles (−0.98 V vs. SCE), suggesting that the conduction band edge (photocurrent onset potential) remains fixed (pinned) upon alumina deposition.36 This result is in agreement with the findings in Al2O3/WO3,20 but opposite to those in the Al2O3/Fe2O3 films modified by the similar ALD method where the onset potential of Fe2O3 was drastically changed in the presence of alumina.19 This suggests that the effect of Al2O3 passivation is highly dependent on the parent materials and also on the surface coverage achieved.37
To quantitatively analyze the efficiency of the photoelectrode, the photoconversion efficiency is calculated from the linear sweep voltammogram.38 As shown in Fig. 2b, after ALD overcoating of 30 cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer, the efficiency reaches 3.35% at −0.53 V vs. SCE, corresponding to 48 fold and 1.7 fold enhancement compared to the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays (0.07% at −0.61 V vs. SCE) and the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays (1.97% at −0.53 V vs. SCE), respectively. In comparison, the enhancements achieved herein are higher than those of the previously reported photoanodes, such as the triple TiO2/CdS/Co–Pi hybrid photoanode39 and the CdS sensitized branched TiO2 nanoarray photoanode.40 And the photoconversion efficiency is much higher than those of similar photoanodes in the recent reports.41,42
Additionally, the photoresponses of these samples at 0 V vs. SCE over time were inspected by the I–t plots in Fig. 2c. Upon illumination of a chopped LED lamp light with 80 mW cm−2, the photocurrents are prompt to emerge except that of the TNTAs. The result demonstrates that photogenerated electrons transport very fast from QDs to TNTAs, thus retarding the combination of photo-induced carriers. Also, the photocurrents are fairly steady after five on–off cycles of illumination.

Fig. 3 illustrates the UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays, quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays without Al2O3 deposition and with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer. The absorption onset of the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays is located at about 380 nm, which well corresponds to the band gap energy of TiO2 (3.2 eV) in the anatase phase, while the broad peak between 400 and 700 nm may be attributed to the subband gap states of the TiO2 nanotube arrays due to the special nanotube structure43 or the incorporated fluorine in the TiO2 film.44 Cosensitization of PbS and CdS quantum dots on TiO2 nanotubes enables the absorption in the visible region, which is of significance in PEC applications driven by visible light. More importantly, within experimental uncertainty, TiO2 nanotube arrays with and without the ALD Al2O3 overlayer have identical absorption spectra. Thus the differences in PEC performance (Fig. 2) cannot be ascribed to differences in light harvesting.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs, black), quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with 0 cycles (blue) and 30 cycles (red) of the Al2O3 overlayer. 
The improved PEC performance by the Al2O3 overcoating can also be confirmed by the IPCE measurement (Fig. 4). It is conducted to investigate the contribution of specific wavelengths of light to the photocurrent density, providing a reliable method to characterize the wavelength dependent photoresponse. It can be seen that the IPCE values are apparently enhanced over the entire wavelength range for all the Al2O3 modified photoelectrodes. Above 380 nm, the IPCE values of the pure TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrode fall to zero, consistent with the observation of the optical absorption properties (Fig. 3). Quantum dot co-sensitization can improve the IPCE under visible light excitation. The ALD Al2O3 overlayer on the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays can further increase the IPCE values, and the enhancement varies with the ALD cycles, which is similar to the results of linear sweep voltammograms (Fig. 2). For the photoelectrode with 30 ALD cycles of Al2O3, IPCE reaches the maximum value of 83% at 350 nm excitation, remaining above 30% up to 450 nm and above 20% up to 500 nm, which are better than those reported so far on similar quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotubular structures.16,17,45
 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra of pure TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs, black) and quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with various ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer: 0 cycles (blue), 3 cycles (green), 30 cycles (red) and 100 cycles (magenta). The measurement was conducted at 0 V vs. SCE. 
The PEC performance enhancement by Al2O3 modification may be ascribed to the following reasons: (a) enhanced light absorption from Al2O3 deposition, (b) increased carrier density by surface recombination passivation, and (c) catalytic improvement to facilitate charge transfer.46 Optical absorption experiments discussed above help to rule out the possibility of (a). In the rest of the discussion on the effects of Al2O3 overcoating, for clarity, only the results of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with 0 ALD cycles (that is, without Al2O3 deposition) and with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer are highlighted.
Passivation of surface states by ALD conformal overlayer has been shown to lead to better charge separation, less surface charge recombination, and hence a cathodic shift of the turn on potential of photoanodes and increase of photocurrent density.47 At the surface of TiO2 nanotubes prepared by chemical anodization, Ti3+ interstitials octahedrally coordinated to O, forming Ti–O dangling bonds, accounting for the surface trap sites, which cause the prominent electron–hole recombination loss and the low PEC efficiency.48 Al2O3 overlayer coating on the tubular structures by ALD has been demonstrated to provide chemical passivation at the interface and reduce the defect-related recombination.28 Similar findings have also been obtained in our investigations (Fig. S3, ESI†). Upon Al2O3 deposition, the photocurrent density of TiO2 nanotube arrays is enhanced and there is a slight cathodic shift of the onset potential. These can be ascribed to the reduction of the surface recombination by surface passivation with no significant change in the optical absorption property (Fig. S4, ESI†). Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated the presence of trap states on the CdS quantum dot surface and found that the rate of the electron transfer into the CdS surface states is faster than that of the electron transfer from CdS into TiO2.49 That is to say, the trapping rate in surface states of CdS QDs is faster than the injection rate from CdS into TiO2, causing unfavorable recombination between the trapped electrons and the hole carriers at the surface of CdS QDs. The remarkable enhancement of the PEC performance, as shown in Fig. 2 and 4, by the Al2O3 layer on the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays demonstrates that the ALD conformal overlayer can effectively passivate these surface traps and reduce the photogenerated electron–hole recombination at the surface.
The increase of charge carrier density (i.e., electrons) by Al2O3 passivation of surface states can also be supported by Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S5, ESI†). From the inverse slopes of the plots, the density of charge carriers ND is calculated to be 1.47 × 1020 and 6.40 × 1020 cm−3 for the photoanode without Al2O3 deposition and with 30 cycles of Al2O3, respectively. Indeed, the carrier density does appear to increase after Al2O3 deposition, which confirms a lower density of surface states along with reduced recombination due to the chemical passivation effect of Al2O3 overcoating. The flat band potential, VFB, can also be extracted as −0.65 and −0.60 V vs. SCE for the photoanodes without Al2O3 deposition and with 30 cycles of Al2O3, respectively. These values obtained from the Mott–Schottky plots are broadly consistent with those reported for similar structures.17,50 However, the VFB difference is so small that we cannot draw direct conclusions regarding the effect of Al2O3 deposition on carrier transfer from the modification of the flat band potential.
Additionally, we can obtain an estimate for the width of the space charge layer, WSC, from the following equation.51 WSC = [2ε0εs(V − VFB)/(qND)]1/2(2)here, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εs is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, V is the applied potential, and q is the electronic charge. For simplicity, εs is set as 48 for anatase TiO2.52 At 0 V vs. SCE, for the photoelectrodes with 0 cycles and 30 cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer, the values of WSC obtained using eqn (2) are 4.8 nm and 2.2 nm, respectively. The calculated values of WSC at the applied biases in our PEC measurement are less than half of the wall thickness of TiO2 nanotubes (25 nm), verifying the feasibility of eqn (2). For the similar values of VFB, a shorter space charge layer indicates a higher degree of band bending near the surface as a result of Al2O3 coating, which should lead to more effective collection of charge carriers (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Next, we use EIS to further study the charge transfer characteristics of the photoelectrodes with and without Al2O3 coating quantitatively. The results are presented in Fig. 5 in the form of Nyquist plots. The small dots in the plot represent the experimental data, and the solid lines represent the result of fitting these experimental data to the equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset. We selected the Randles–Ershler model, in which Rs is the electrolyte resistance, CPE is the capacitance phase element for the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface.53 Upon fitting with the equivalent circuit model in Fig. 5, the results in ESI,† Table S2 shows a smaller Rct (from 207.8 to 145.0 Ω) and a larger CPE (from 1.9 × 10−3 to 2.4 × 10−3 F) after Al2O3 deposition. The smaller value of Rct and the larger value of CPE represent improved charge transport characteristics, making a favorable environment for the hole output from the electrode to the electrolyte and charge separation in PEC reactions.53,54 Our result is different from the significant reduction of the charge transfer resistance when electrocatalysts, such as Co–Pi or Co3O4,55,56 were applied on the photoanode. However, the apparent change in Rct means that the beneficial influence of Al2O3 deposition on the oxidation kinetics should not be overlooked. Thus modification with the Al2O3 overlayer not only facilitates the photogenerated hole transfer but also helps to release those accumulated on the surface of the photoelectrode to the electrolyte, which accounts for the remarkable PEC enhancement.
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots of quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays without Al2O3 deposition (blue squares) and with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer (red triangles). The measurement was conducted under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) at an open circuit potential. The inset shows an equivalent circuit for the photoanodes. 
The effects of Al2O3 overcoating for catalytic improvement to facilitate charge transfer might come from the so-called field-effect passivation and the surface charge effect. In addition to the chemical passivation effect, a strong field-effect passivation of the ALD Al2O3 layer has been demonstrated to play an important role in the crystalline Si passivation mechanism.24,57 Chemical passivation reduces the interfacial state density, while field-effect passivation shields the minority carrier from the semiconductor interface by a built-in electric field. The built-in electric field is attributed to the presence of the fixed negative charge density in Al2O3 which is originated from the intrinsic (Al vacancies and O interstitials) and extrinsic (H interstitials) defects.58 The concentration of these defects is sensitive to ALD deposition temperature and postdeposition annealing temperature which would greatly influence the passivation effect.28 Our experiments about the effect of postdeposition thermal treatment on the photocurrent shows that annealing at 400 °C results in a greater decline of the photocurrent density for the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with 30 cycles of Al2O3 than that without Al2O3 coating (Fig. S7, ESI†). Given a similar variation of the quantum dots after annealing, we may ascribe the serious decrease in the photoanode with the Al2O3 overlayer to the weaker effect of the field-effect passivation. On the other hand, the surface charge effect was proposed to explain the reduced charge recombination, which was induced by the charge fixed on the surface of the passivation layer.59,60 Given that the point of zero charge of the water–Al2O3 interface is known to be pH ∼6.7,61 the Al2O3 layer deposited on our photoanode is likely to be negatively charged under our experimental conditions (pH 12.2 in the mixed aqueous solution of Na2SO3 and Na2S). We speculate that this may induce a similar effect to suppress charge recombination existing beneath the Al2O3 photoelectrode interface. However, further investigations should be performed to prove this possibility.

Fig. 6 shows a schematic of the multiple effects in the presence of the Al2O3 layer. When the photoanode is illuminated, the photogenerated holes present in the valence band will efficiently transport from the bulk to the interface between the quantum dot and the ALD layer under the effects of built-in electric fields. Such fields originate not only from the heterojunction between TiO2 and quantum dots, but also from the presence of the fixed negative charges in the Al2O3 layer (field-effect passivation) and/or on the Al2O3 surface (surface charge effect). These also repel the photogenerated electrons into the bulk, and effectively suppress the electrons from being captured by the surface states. In combination with the effect of chemical passivation by the Al2O3 overlayer, the charge carrier density increases and the recombination is significantly reduced. The unpaired electrons can migrate to the cathode along the nanotubes to participate in the water reduction reaction to generate hydrogen.
 Fig. 6  Energy band diagram of the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrode with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer, where CB and VB are the conduction band and the valence band, respectively. Schematic of charge transport processes is also depicted as the electrode is illuminated. 
The photochemical stability of the photoanodes, especially for chalcogenide quantum dots inclining to self-corrosion, is another shared concern. Time-dependent photocurrent density of the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrodes without Al2O3 deposition and with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer was measured at 0 V vs. SCE (Fig. S8, ESI†).
The photocurrent quickly decays in the first five minutes. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Ai et al., but it has not been explained in detail.39 The reason for this sharp decrease is not clear at the moment but it may be related to the accumulation of charge carriers near the photoanode/electrolyte interface and/or the relatively slow oxidation kinetics.20,51 During continuous illumination from 300 to 7200 s, 80% of the initial photocurrent density can be maintained for the photoanode with the Al2O3 overlayer, while there is as little as 45% photocurrent density left for the bare photoanode. The results indicate that a protective Al2O3 overlayer by ALD can effectively retard quantum dots from degradation. According to previous reports, however, the Al2O3 overlayer deposited by ALD does not have the same protective effect on the stability in all cases due to its amphoteric nature. For instance, long time stability has been demonstrated to be more than 5000 s for anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays with a 2.6 nm amorphous Al2O3 shell,28 and 12 h for the Si photocathode protected by a 2.3 nm Al2O3 layer.60 However, the Fe2O3 electrode covered by an ALD Al2O3 layer only displayed stable behavior for about 30 min.19 The difference may come from the variations of the geometric and crystal structures of the Al2O3 layer, applied potential, electrolyte composition, pH values, etc.
XPS analysis is also applied to reveal the variation of surface composition before and after the PEC test (Fig. 7). “Before PEC test” refers to the as-prepared photoanodes. And “after PEC test” refers to the long term exposure (ca. 2 h) in the mixed aqueous solution of Na2SO3 and Na2S under various applied potentials during PEC measurement. Several findings can be obtained by carefully examining the XPS spectra of the bare quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays and that with 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer before and after the PEC test. (1) The XPS peaks at 411.7 and 404.9 eV (Fig. 7b) correspond to the Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 states.17,62 A close inspection finds that these two peaks shift to 411.5 and 404.7 eV, respectively, for the photoanode with Al2O3 deposition before the PEC test. The shift in binding energies by about 0.2 eV can be attributed to the strong interactions between CdS quantum dots and the Al2O3 overlayer.15 And the recovery of the peak positions after the PEC test might suggest the partial absence of the coating layer. (2) Fig. 7c displays that there are two chemically distinct species in the spectra which are in accord with the S 2p states.62,63 The peak at about 161 eV is for sulfide, while the peak at 168.1 eV is assigned to sulfur in sulfate which is originated from sulfide on the surface oxidized with the humid environment. The peak at 168.1 eV cannot be observed on the photoanode with the ALD overlayer before the PEC test, clarifying that the surface S species exists as sulfide, and a similar observation is also reported.10 The disappearance of the peak at 168.1 eV confirms the uniform coverage of the Al2O3 overlayer isolating quantum dots from outer ambient conditions, while its reoccurrence after the PEC test also suggests the partial dissolution of the Al2O3 overlayer. (3) The XPS peak of the Al 2p state at 74.4 eV became weak after the PEC test as shown in Fig. 7d. It can be attributed to the alkaline electrolyte partly dissolving the thin Al2O3 layer. This is supported by the high-resolution TEM image of the photoanode with the Al2O3 overlayer after the PEC test (Fig. S9, ESI†), where the Al2O3 layer is discrete and thin so that the signal of Al 2p is difficult to detect.
 Fig. 7  (a) XPS survey scan for quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays with 0 cycles (blue) and 30 cycles (red) of the Al2O3 overlayer before the PEC test over a large energy range at low resolution. High-resolution XPS spectra of the photoanode with 0 cycles (blue) and 30 cycles (red) of the Al2O3 overlayer before (solid lines) and after (dashed lines) the PEC test: (b) Cd 3d, (c) S 2p, and (d) Al 2p. 
Quantitative analysis of the XPS spectra can give the atomic concentration of various elements present in the photoanodes before and after the PEC test. For the photoanode without the Al2O3 layer, the atomic concentration ratio of Cd to S decreases from 0.73 to 0.67 after the PEC test, resulting from cadmium leakage due to oxidation of sulfide ions. This corresponds to the apparent decay of photocurrent density in the bare photoanode (Fig. S8, ESI†). However, for the photoanode with the Al2O3 overlayer, the change in the atomic concentration ratio before and after the PEC test is quite small (0.68 and 0.66 before and after the PEC test, respectively). These results indicate that the Al2O3 overlayer deposited by ALD can act as a protective layer to effectively retard the photocorrosion of chalcogenide quantum dots. Despite the slow dissolution in the harsh alkaline electrolyte, the Al2O3 overlayer was sufficiently stable for characterization to scrutinize the working mechanism for the remarkable enhancement of the PEC properties. In terms of higher photochemical stability, future work is required to optimize the overlayer by either combining the Al2O3 coating with other oxide layers by ALD, or integrating electrochemical cocatalysts onto the passivation layer.
Conclusions
Conformal Al2O3 overcoating by an ALD technique has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the PEC performance of the quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays under visible light excitation. 30 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 overlayer are optimal to balance surface coverage and resistance to charge transfer. This leads to the maximum photocurrent density of 5.19 mA cm−2 under simulated solar illumination and the record IPCE values of 83% at a wavelength of 350 nm and more than 30% up to 450 nm. While the optical absorptivity remains essentially unchanged, the Al2O3 overlayer not only reduces surface state recombination by chemical passivation, but also improves charge transport efficiency in the bulk and transfer kinetics across the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Such catalytic improvement to facilitate charge transfer might come from the field-effect passivation induced by the negative charge in the Al2O3 layer as well as the surface charge effect due to the negative charge fixed on the Al2O3 surface in the alkaline electrolyte. In addition to this, the Al2O3 overlayer deposited via ALD has been shown to act as a protective layer to effectively retard the photocorrosion of chalcogenide quantum dots. Based on the insight gained from this study, the simple treatment of photoelectrodes using the thin ALD overlayer is expected to be used as guidelines for the development and optimization of high-performance photoelectrode materials for practical solar water splitting.
