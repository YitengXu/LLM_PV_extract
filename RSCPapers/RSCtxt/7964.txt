    , Accepted 18th October 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractWe present a facile synthesis method to make a new ladder-type heptacyclic dithienobenzofluorene (DTBF) framework, where the central 2,7-fluorene unit is covalently fastened with two external thiophenes via two CC bridges. A dieneyne-containing precursor undergoes DBU-induced double benzannulation to regiospecifically introduce two solubilizing 2-octyldodecyl side chains at 5,10-positions of DTBF. The rigid and coplanar Br-DTBF monomer with sufficient solubility was copolymerized with 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Sn-DTFBT) and 5,10-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (Sn-DTNT) via Stille coupling to furnish two donor–acceptor copolymers, PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT, respectively. Their thermal, optical, electrochemical, molecular stacking and photovoltaic properties are investigated. PDTBFNT has a higher molecular weight, smaller optical and electrochemical band gaps, and stronger solid-state packing than PDTBFFBT. DFT calculations were carried out to gain insight into the electronic and structural properties of DTBF and its derivatives. Bulk heterojunction solar devices with the ITO/ZnO/polymers:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag configuration were fabricated. By adding 5 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as an additive, PDTBFNT:PC71BM and PDTBFFBT:PC71BM devices achieved the power conversion efficiencies of 5.22% and 2.68%, respectively. The superior efficiency of PDTBFNT over PDTBFFBT is attributed to the better LUMO energy alignment between PDTBFNT and PC71BM and the face-on π-stacking of PDTBFNT in the active layer. Moreover, PDTBFNT exhibited a higher field-effect transistor hole mobility of 1.90 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 than PDTBFFBT with a value of 3.96 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
The field of organic optoelectronics has been advanced drastically by the expansion of p-type and n-type semiconductor libraries.1 In particular, polymer solar cells (PSCs) benefit substantially from the development of p-type conjugated polymers.2 It has been documented that enhancing the planarity of polyaromatic systems is advantageous to π-electron delocalization, which can further extend the effective conjugation length and reduce the optical band gap to allow for capturing more photons of the solar spectrum.3 Moreover, the increase of structural rigidity can lower the rotational disorder and diminish the reorganization energy, thus improving the intrinsic charge mobility.4 The tricyclic 2,7-fluorene unit is a useful electron-rich building block for preparing various p-type polymers due to its deep-lying HOMO energy levels and good hole-transporting properties to achieve high open-circuit voltages (Voc) and short circuit currents (Jsc).5 Therefore, embedding a fluorene motif into a ladder-type π-conjugated framework would be an attractive and promising molecular design for developing new semiconductors.6 For example, based on a 2,7-dithienylfluorene skeleton, we recently develop a synthetic method to fasten the central fluorene and two external thiophenes by two sp3–carbon bridges, forming a heptacyclic ladder-type structure called dithienocyclopentafluorene (DTCF, Scheme 1).6c,d The solar cell device incorporating a poly(dithienocyclopentafluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PDTCFBT) polymer has shown better performance than that of its open-chain counterpart.6c,d,7 Despite the fact that the conjugated backbones are highly planar, the two geminal side chains on the tetrahedron sp3-hybridized carbons will stick out of the conjugated plane and thus inevitably impose certain steric hindrance to suppress intermolecular interactions. To circumvent this steric deficiency of sp3-hybridized bridges, it is of interest to covalently fasten the central fluorene and two outer thiophene rings by sp2–sp2 CC ethylene bridges with concomitant formation of two embedded benzene rings, resulting in a new heptacyclic ladder-type structure denoted as dithienobenzofluorene (DTBF) (Scheme 1). Forming benzene rings is also advantageous to lower the HOMO energy level of DTBF for obtaining higher Voc. Nevertheless, introducing aliphatic side chains on the sp2–sp2 CC moieties of this highly planarized DTBF is imperative to ensure solubility but synthetically challenging. In this research, we first successfully synthesized a DTBF with two 2-octyldodecyl chains regiospecifically at its 5,10 positions. The key step to construct the DTBF is via double base-induced benzannulation of a dieneyne-based precursor.8 5,6-Difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) has been used extensively as an electron acceptor to construct conjugated polymers for applications in organic optoelectronics.8e,9 Naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) NT, an emerging electron acceptor, has also led to high-performance p-type polymers in PSCs.10 Consequently, the brominated DTBF monomer was copolymerized with 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Sn-DTFBT) and 5,10-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (Sn-DTNT) via Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling to afford two donor–acceptor copolymers, PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT, respectively. The thermal, optical, electrochemical, photovoltaic, and stacking properties and DFT calculations of PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT are investigated and compared. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar device using the PDTBFNT:PC71BM blend exhibited a decent efficiency of 5%, validating the promising capabilities of DTBF in the field of PSCs.

Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of Br-DTBF, PDTBFFBT, and PDTBFNT
The synthetic route of the monomer Br-DTBF is depicted in Scheme 2. Stille coupling of 3,6-dibromo-2,7-diiodo-9,9-dioctylfluorene (1) regioselectively occurred at the 2,7-positions to afford 2. 3 was obtained by palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of 2 with 4-octyl-1-tetradecyne. 1,8-Diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU)-induced benzannulation of 3 led to the formation of DTBF with the two benzene rings embedded between the outer thiophenes and the central fluorene. This reaction involves isomerization of the propargyl moiety to an allene group followed by intramolecular 6π-electrocyclization/aromatization.8 Bromination of DTBF by typical N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) failed to afford Br-DTBF, whereas lithiating DTBF followed by quenching with 1,2-dibromotetrachloroethane successfully generated Br-DTBF. As shown in Scheme 3, Br-DTBF was then copolymerized with the Sn-DTFBT and Sn-DTNT monomers to form PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT, respectively.

Thermal properties and molecular weights
As determined by thermogravimetric analysis, thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT are estimated to be 382 °C and 325 °C, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that no detectable thermal transition was found for both polymers, indicating their amorphous character in the scanning temperature between 80 and 280 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) determined by gel permeation chromatography were 7.8 K g mol−1 and 1.2 for PDTBFFBT, and 14.3 K g mol−1 and 3.4 for PDTBFNT.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in CHCl3 and thin film are shown in Fig. 2 and the results are summarized in Table 1. PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT exhibit two major absorption bands in the solution and solid states. Based on the computational results (see Theoretical calculations), the longer wavelengths at 522 nm and 626 nm for PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich and the electron-deficient segments. The optical band gap of PDTBFNT is smaller than that of PDTBFFBT, indicating that the accepting strength of NT is stronger than that of FBT, which is consistent with other studies.11 The aggregation-induced red-shift in thin film is much more pronounced for PDTBFFBT than PDTBFNT.

Electrochemical properties
Thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties and determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the polymers (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The LUMO energy levels of PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT are determined to be −3.17 and −3.67 eV, respectively. It has been proposed that the energy required for exciton dissociation in organic materials is around 0.3 eV.2a The LUMO energy level of PDTBFNT is 0.33 eV higher than that of the PC71BM (−4.0 eV) acceptor, which is suitable for energetically favorable electron transfer. On the other hand, the much higher-lying LUMO energy level of PDTBFFBT may be detrimental to exciton dissociation, resulting in poor short-circuit current (Jsc). Both PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT possess low-lying HOMO energy levels which are beneficial for attaining good ambient stability and higher Voc (Table 1).

Theoretical calculations
It is envisioned that the alternation of the bridging linker from the tetrahedron carbon in DTCF to the ethylene unit in DTBT would change the molecular geometry and the intermolecular stacking. Quantum-chemical calculations with the Gaussian09 suite employing the B3LYP density functional in combination with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set were then employed to investigate the structural difference between DTCF and DTBF. The aliphatic side chains in DTCF and DTBF are all simplified due to the insignificant influence on the geometry of the conjugated system. The optimized geometries of DTCF and DTBF suggest that both molecules possess a high degree of planarity (Fig. 4). The most noticeable geometrical dissimilarity between DTCF and DTBF lies in the molecular curvature which can be quantified by the angle between two axes along the two outer thiophenes as shown in Fig. 4. DTBF and DTCF have angles of 68° and 154°, respectively, meaning that DTBF has a more curved backbone. The different molecular curvature and geometrical shapes can be used to modulate the molecular properties of the resultant conjugated polymers. Furthermore, with the intention of gaining insight into the electronic structures of PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT, dimeric models of 2-DTBFFBT and 2-DTBFNT are adopted and geometry-optimized under the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The side-chain substituents are simplified in order to reduce the computational time. The optimized geometries of 2-DTBFFBT and 2-DTBFNT are depicted in Fig. 5. Both model compounds exhibit quasi-planar and quasi-linear conjugated backbones. Time-dependent density functional calculations (TD-MPW1PW91/6-311G(d,p)) are then carried out by using the optimized geometries with solvation in chloroform by applying the polarizable continuum model. The results are summarized in Table 2 and the calculated HOMO and LUMO electron-density distributions are illustrated in Fig. 6. Although the deviation exists between the experimental observables and theoretical estimates, a qualitative agreement can be perceived. For instance, the computation results suggest that 2-DTBFFBT and 2-DTBFNT have comparable HOMO energy levels but the LUMO of 2-DTBFFBT is higher than that of 2-DTBFNT, which is consistent with the electrochemical results. The electron density of the HOMO is distributed along the central conjugated backbone of 2-DTBFFBT and 2-DTBFNT, while the electron density of the LUMO is primarily localized in the electron-deficient FBT and NT regions (Fig. 6). The lowest energy singlet electronic transitions for 2-DTBFFBT and 2-DTBFNT are visualized through electron density difference maps.12 As illustrated in Fig. 7, both transitions are attributed to intramolecular charge separation between the donor (DTBF) and the acceptor (FBT or BT) after photo-excitation.

The inverted device with the PDTBFFBT:PC71BM blend exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 1.09 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 31.8%, delivering a low PCE of 0.28%. On the other hand, the device with PDTBFNT:PC71BM exhibited a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 7.85 mA cm−2, and an FF of 46.4%, delivering a PCE of 3.35%. By adding 5 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as an additive, the PDTBFNT:PC71BM-based device showed an improved PCE of 5.22% and the PCE of the PDTBFFBT:PC71BM-based device also increased to 2.68%. The performance enhancement is mainly attributed to the greater Jsc and the higher FF, implying that the use of DPE optimizes the morphology for better charge-carrier transportation.13 Moreover, the much lower Jsc of the PDTBFFBT:PC71BM device might derive from unfavorable intermolecular charge transfer due to the higher-lying LUMO energy level of PDTBFFBT. It is worth mentioning that both polymers exhibited high Voc values up to ca. 0.90 V as a result of their low-lying HOMO energy levels.
GIXS measurements
The molecular stacking of the PDTBFFBT:PC71BM and PDTBFNT:PC71BM blends on the ZnO-coated ITO glass substrates was investigated by grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS). The thin films are prepared based on the optimized conditions used in the photovoltaic measurements. The 2-D GIXS images are illustrated in Fig. 9 and their corresponding 1-D diffraction patterns are plotted in Fig. 10. The peak at the scattering vector q = 1.33 Å−1 is assigned to the isotropically oriented fullerene clusters. The PDTBFFBT:PC71BM and PDTBFNT:PC71BM blends exhibited (h00) signals assigned to a lamellar spacing (dl) of ca. 24 Å and 20 Å, respectively, corresponding to the side-chain interdigitation of the polymer. The PDTBFNT:PC71BM film exhibited an out-of-plane diffraction peak (face-on) at qz = 1.75 Å−1 corresponding to the π-stacking with a distance (dπ) of ca. 3.58 Å. Nevertheless, the PDTBFFBT:PC71BM blend does not exhibit such a diffraction peak. The face-on alignment of conjugated polymers is beneficial for vertical charge transport in solar cell devices, which contributes to the better efficiency of the PDTBFNT-based device.10c,14

Transistor characterization
Organic field-effect transistor (OFET) mobilities of PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT were measured by the devices using a bottom-gate/top-contact configuration with evaporated gold source/drain electrodes (40 nm in thickness). SiO2 as a gate dielectric in the OFET devices was modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The output and transfer plots of the devices exhibited typical p-type OFET characteristics (Fig. 11). The hole mobility of the PDTBFFBT device is 3.96 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on–off ratio of 1.25 × 103, while that of the PDTBFNT device is 1.90 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on–off ratio of 2.22 × 105. (Table 4).

Conclusions
A facile synthetic route was designed to make a new ladder-type heptacyclic dithienobenzofluorene (DTBF) framework, where the central 2,7-fluorene unit is covalently rigidified with two outer thiophenes by two sp2–sp2 CC bridges. The DTBF framework with two 2-octyldodecyl groups at its 5,10-positions was constructed through DBU-induced double benzannulation of a dieneyne-containing precursor 3. In comparison with the sp3-carbon bridged dithienocyclopentafluorene (DTCF) analogue, the ethylene-bridged DTBF possesses less steric hindrance and a more curved conjugated backbone. The rigid and coplanar Br-DTBF monomer was copolymerized with Sn-DTFBT and Sn-DTNTvia Stille coupling to produce two donor–acceptor copolymers, PDTBFFBT and PDTBFNT, respectively. PDTBFNT has a smaller optical band gap than PDTBFFBT, indicating that the accepting strength of NT is stronger than that of FBT. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the ITO/ZnO/polymers:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag configuration were fabricated and examined under a simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. By adding 5 vol% DPE as an additive, the efficiencies of PDTBFNT-based and PDTBFFBT-based devices were improved to 5.22% and 2.68%, respectively. The superior efficiency of PDTBFNT over PDTBFFBT mainly comes from the higher Jsc and FF which are attributed to the better LUMO energy alignment between PDTBFNT and PC71BM, as well as the face-on π-stacking of PDTBFNT for efficient vertical charge transport within the PDTBFNT:PC71BM blend. Moreover, PDTBFNT achieved a higher hole mobility of 1.90 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is envisaged that DTBF can be utilized as a useful building block to construct new semiconducting materials for organic optoelectronics.
