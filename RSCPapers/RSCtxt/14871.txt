    , Accepted 1st April 2023First published on 3rd April 2023AbstractFor nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cell (OSC), a small HOMO offset favors the high open-circuit voltage (Voc), while a large one facilitates the charge separation. To simultaneously achieve efficient charge separation and low voltage loss in OSCs, we synthesized four 10,11-dihydrodiindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT)-based NFAs, namely S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F, and S2-N2F, by modifying the end groups and side chains and obtaining tunable HOMO offsets of 0, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06 eV, respectively, when blended with PBDB-T. S1-N1F:PBDB-T-based OSCs with a HOMO offset of 0 eV show the lowest short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) values, resulting in an unsatisfactory power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.94%, due to insufficient driving force for effective charge separation. Regardless of near zero HOMO offset (0.03 eV), S1-N2F:PBDB-T-based OSCs give the highest PCE of 13.59% with a high Voc of 0.94 V along with a comparable FF up to 74.30%. S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs give moderate PCEs of 10.35 and 11.59% with Jsc values of 17.07 and 17.82 mA cm−2, and FF values of 62.14 and 70.33%, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements indicate that S2-N1F and S2-N2F with large HOMO offsets have faster interfacial hole transfer and charge recombination processes. This study demonstrates that high-performance OSCs can be achieved by blending the donor and acceptor with a near zero HOMO offset, which can provide valuable experience for designing highperformance NFAs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered one of the most attractive photovoltaic technologies owing to their potential advantages, such as low cost and flexibility.1–8 In the past few years, owing to the innovations in photoactive materials, a comprehensive understanding of the working mechanism and the development of device engineering, OSCs have achieved significant progress, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased rapidly.9–16,65 In particular, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged as promising alternatives to fullerene derivatives and accelerated the development of the OSC field.17–23 Unlike the fullerene acceptors, the optical and electronic properties, molecular packing, film morphology, and the energy loss of A–D–A-type NFAs in the blend films could be easily tuned by modifying their chemical structures, including fused-ring extension, side-chain engineering, end-group engineering, and asymmetric-configuration construction.24–39 Resulting from extensively exploring novel A–D–A-type NFAs, PCEs higher than 18% for binary and 19% for ternary devices have been achieved.40–44
A major advantage of NFAs is that they require relatively small energy offsets to drive the charge separation. As shown in Fig. 1a, at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, an extra driving force is needed to split exciton, form a charge-transfer (CT) state and finally separate the Coulombically bonded electron–hole pair into free charges. The driving force can be simplified as the energy level offsets between the donor and acceptor, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level offset and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level offset.45 Because of the highly absorptive properties of NFAs, the excitons generated by NFAs can also be separated at donor/acceptor interfaces via hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor, thus contributing to the overall charge generation. Generally, it is observed that a small HOMO offset favors a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), while a large one can better facilitate charge separation.46,47 Therefore, simultaneously achieving efficient charge separation and low voltage loss is highly required to further improve the PCE. Additionally, it has been reported for OSCs that both short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) have reached over 80% and 90% of Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limits, respectively, while the Voc is still below 80% of the SQ limit.28,48 Therefore, balancing the trade-off between Voc and Jsc, simultaneously, to improve FF is still facing great challenges.

Historically, it is empirically believed that sufficient frontier molecular orbital energy level offsets between donor and acceptor materials (including the HOMO and LUMO offsets) are typically ≥0.3 eV to ensure fast and efficient charge separation in fullerene-based OSCs.49–54 Encouragingly, recent reports have shown that a few NFA-based OSCs with near-zero HOMO energy offsets can still maintain efficient hole transfer and achieve considerable photovoltaic performance. For example, Li et al. reported that J71:ITIC-based devices possessing a HOMO offset of 0.11 eV could afford a PCE of 11.4%.55 Yan et al. reported that PffBT2T-TT:O-IDTBR-based devices with a HOMO offset of 0.09 eV could achieve a PCE of 10.4%.56 Zhu et al. reported that PTB7-Th:BDTI-2F-based OSCs could obtain a PCE of 9.11% with a HOMO offset of 0.01 eV.57 Recently, Li et al. showed that a high PCE of 16.32% is achieved for PTQ11: TPT10-based devices with a HOMO offset of 0 eV.58 Chen et al. demonstrated that PM6:BTP-H2-based devices with a HOMO offset of 0.04 eV provide a high PCE of 18.5%.41 These studies revealed that efficient charge separation, hole transfer and low voltage loss can be achieved in OSCs even with a HOMO offset of approximately 0 eV. However, there are still very few reports on how a small driving force can effectively perform charge separation, obtain a high Voc, and ensure high photovoltaic performance. Achieving continuously tunable HOMO offsets is highly valuable for further understanding the charge transfer process and collection in OSCs and for providing a valid methodology to further improve device performance.
Consequently, we synthesized four 10,11-dihydrodiindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT)-based NFAs, namely S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F, which contain various side chains and end-groups. Fine-tuning the degree of fluorination at the end groups can regulate energy levels. Moreover, branched alkyl side chains are introduced to the central DIDT core unit because they can slightly downshift the HOMO energy levels and up-shift the LUMO energy levels. The side-chain configuration discernibly alters the aggregation state of NFAs, which changes the intermolecular electronic coupling and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO.59,60 Photophysical and electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performances of the four acceptors are extensively examined. As expected and confirmed by both CV and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, increased HOMO offsets of 0, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.06 eV are observed when S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are blended with PBDB-T, respectively. S1-N1F:PBDB-T-based OSCs with a HOMO offset of 0 eV show the lowest Jsc and FF values, resulting in an unsatisfactory PCE of 7.94% owing to an insufficient driving force for effective charge separation. Regardless of near zero HOMO offset (0.03 eV), S1-N2F:PBDB-T-based OSCs give the highest PCE of 13.59% with a high Voc of 0.94 V along with a comparable FF up to 74.30%. Owing to the high LUMO levels of S2-N1F and S2-N2F, their devices can provide high Voc of 0.98 and 0.93 V, respectively. However, only moderate Jsc of 17.07 and 17.82 mA cm−2 and FF values of 62.14 and 70.33% are obtained, resulting in moderate PCEs of 10.35 and 11.59% for S2-N1F and S2-N2F-based OSCs, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements indicate that S2-N1F:PBDB-T- and S2-N2F:PBDB-T-based OSCs with large HOMO offsets have faster interfacial hole transfer processes and charge recombination. Hence, modulating the energy offset and intermolecular interaction is feasible to simultaneously achieve efficient charge separation and low voltage loss in OSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of PBDB-T and acceptors used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The synthesis of four acceptors (S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F) is outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 1 is prepared according to the literature procedure.34 Compounds 2a and 2b are synthesized in yields of 52% and 48% by reacting compound 1 with 1-bromooctane and 2-ethylhexyl bromide, respectively. Compounds 3a and 3b are obtained with the bromination of 2a and 2b in yields of 80% and 78%, respectively. Stille coupling of trimethyl(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)stannane with compounds 3a and 3b affords compounds 4a and 4b, respectively, in a yield of approximately 50%. Then, compounds 4a and 4b are converted to the dialdehyde compounds 5a and 5b in yields of 95% and 87%, respectively, via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of 5a and 5b with two end-groups (2-(7-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1ylidene) malononitrile and 2-(6,7-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1ylidene) malononitrile) affords S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F in yields of 75%, 79%, 68% and 70%, respectively. Chemical structures of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. All these acceptors are readily dissolved in various organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature, meeting the prerequisite for solution processing. Solubilities of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F in chloroform solutions are determined to be 60, 55, 69 and 64 mg mL−1, respectively, by following an established method (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the results are presented in Table 1. It can be observed that acceptors S2-N1F and S2-N2F with branched alkyl chains in the central D unit have slightly better solubilities than acceptors S1-N1F and S1-N2F with linear alkyl chains.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are shown in Fig. 1c and d, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. In dilute chloroform solutions, these four acceptors exhibit similar absorption profiles with a peak at approximately 725 nm. The maximum absorption coefficients (ε) of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are 1.45 × 105, 1.71 × 105, 1.51 × 105 and 1.41 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. When going from solutions to films, the four acceptors exhibit redshifted and broadened absorption, and the film absorption spectra of S1-N1F and S2-N1F are almost superimposed with the main absorption peak located at around 755 nm. Compared with S1-N1F and S2-N1F with the mono fluorinated terminal group, the absorption maxima of S1-N2F and S2-N2F with two difluorinated terminal groups are redshifted by approximately 13 and 17 nm, respectively. The maximum absorption coefficients (ε) of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F as films are 8.95 × 104, 9.34 × 104, 9.12 × 104 and 9.33 × 104 cm−1, respectively. The higher absorption coefficient is beneficial for enhancing light harvesting. The absorption onsets (λonset) of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are 802, 826, 813 and 830 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps (Egopt) of 1.55, 1.50, 1.53 and 1.49 eV, respectively, according to the following equation: Egopt = 1240/λonset. These results suggest that changing the four alkyl side chains in the central D unit from linear to branched can slightly decrease the Egopt of the acceptor film.59,61 Additionally, the fluorination of the end group can also tune the optical properties well.
Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements can determine the oxidation and reduction onset potentials of these acceptors (Fig. S1, ESI†). As summarized in Table 2, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F films are calculated to be −3.83/−5.34, −3.87/−5.37, −3.81/−5.38 and −3.86/−5.40 eV, respectively. It has been reported that side chains can influence molecular packing and thus change the energy levels of acceptors. Replacing branched chains with linear chains can increase π–π interactions and reduce the π–π stacking distance, which can produce a stronger intermolecular electronic coupling, resulting in a narrower band gap.59–61 Here, we find that changing four linear alkyl side chains in the central D unit into branched ones can slightly lower the HOMO energy levels, lift the LUMO energy levels and obtain a larger band gap. Moreover, the introduction of more fluorine atoms can further lower LUMO and HOMO energy levels due to their electron-withdrawing properties. The HOMO offsets between PBDB-T and the four acceptors (S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F) measured by CV are 0, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.06 eV, respectively (Fig. 1e). The HOMO levels are also determined by UPS measurements, and similar small HOMO offsets from 0 to 0.08 eV are obtained (Fig. S1, ESI†). Obviously, the introduction of branched side chains at the central D unit and the fluorination of the end group can slightly increase the HOMO offset to provide a sufficient driving force for charge separation.

Density functional theory (DFT)
The chemical geometry and frontier orbital energy levels of these acceptors (denoted by S-N1F and S-N2F) are investigated by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups for simplification. According to the calculated results, S-N1F and S-N2F could be locked in an energy-preferred planar conformation through the intramolecular noncovalent S/O interaction (Fig. S4, ESI†). The distances between the sulfur atom at the thiophene unit and oxygen atom at the alkyloxy side chain are calculated to be 2.70 Å for the four acceptors, which is obviously shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur and oxygen (3.25 Å). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the HOMO electrons of S-N1F and S-N2F are well distributed over the whole backbone, while the LUMO electrons are mainly located on the electron-withdrawing end groups. Moreover, the trend of the DFT-calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels for S-N1F and S-N2F agrees well with the experimental data measured using the CV and UPS methods. In the preferential configuration, the dihedral angles between the π bridge and the D unit in the S-N1F and S-N2F molecules are measured to be only 0.3° and 0.2°, respectively. Such a planar structure is beneficial for achieving a lower reorganization energy of acceptors, which is beneficial for charge transport.
Photovoltaic properties
OSCs are made with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. Medium band gap-conjugated polymer PBDB-T is chosen as the donor, which possesses a complementary absorption with the acceptors. The OSCs are carefully optimized by varying the thermal annealing temperature (see Tables S1–S4, ESI†). The optimizing process is described in the Supporting Information. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a, and a summary of the optimized photovoltaic parameters of solar devices is depicted in Table 2. The optimal OSCs based on these four acceptors are fabricated using a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 with 5.8 mg mL−1 PBDB-T in o-dichlorobenzene solutions without any additive. All OSCs show high Voc (0.96, 0.94, 0.98 and 0.93 V for S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F, respectively), which agrees with the small HOMO offsets between the donor polymer and the acceptors. The PCEs of the optimized devices based on S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are 7.94%, 13.59%, 10.35% and 11.59%, respectively. Owing to the HOMO offset of 0 eV between S1-N1F and PBDB-T, S1-N1F-based OSCs show the smallest short circuit current density (Jsc) and FF value, resulting in an unsatisfactory PCE of 7.94%. As for S1-N2F and PBDB-T with the HOMO offset of 0.03 eV, the PCE of OSCs is significantly improved to 13.59% with a higher Jsc of 19.51 mA cm−2 and an excellent FF of 74.30%, which is the highest Voc values among FF over 74%-based single-junction OSCs (PCE >13%) (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that the S1-N2F-based OSCs can simultaneously achieve efficient charge separation and low voltage loss. S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs with larger HOMO offsets provide only moderate Jsc values of 17.07 and 17.82 mA cm−2 and FF values of 62.14 and 70.33%, respectively. To verify the Jsc obtained using the J–V method, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 2b, all devices exhibit a broad photovoltaic response spanning from 300 to 900 nm, which is quite consistent with the UV-vis absorption range of the corresponding blend films (Fig. S3, ESI†). The maximum EQE responses are 62%, 77%, 71% and 70% for S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs, respectively. The higher EQE value suggests that photon harvesting and photoelectric conversion are more efficient in S1-N2F-based OSCs than in the other devices. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves match well with the measured Jsc values with errors less than 5%.

Device energy loss
The energy losses (Eloss) of OSCs are investigated by electroluminescence (EL) and highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) measurement. The detailed energy loss data are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). Here, Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3, and detailed calculations and classifications are shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 3a and the Supporting Information. The energy bandgap (Eg) is calculated by the intersection of normalized UV-vis absorption and the photoluminescence spectra of acceptor films (Fig. S7, ESI†). The Eg values of S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs are determined to be 1.59, 1.55, 1.56 and 1.53 eV, respectively. Compared to the S1-N1F- and S1-N2F-based OSCs, the S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs show slightly lower energy loss Eloss (0.63 and 0.61eV vs. 0.58 and 0.60 eV, respectively). As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, there is a negligible difference in the inevitable energy loss (ΔE1) of the four devices. The S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs exhibit lower non-ideal radiative decay values (ΔE2) of 0.10 and 0.11 eV than those of the S1-N1F- and S1-N2F-based ones (0.14 and 0.12 eV), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, the electroluminescent external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) values are 1.02 × 10−4, 7.33 × 10−5, 1.25 × 10−4 and 5.99 × 10−5, respectively. The calculated nonradiative recombination values (ΔE3) of the S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs are 0.23, 0.24, 0.22 and 0.25 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the nonradiative recombination values obtained by Eloss calculation (ΔE3cal). The solar cell with a large ΔHOMO suffers a higher ΔE3. It has been suggested that increasing the energy of CT states or reducing the energetic difference between CT and singlet states benefits the reduction of non-radiative recombination loss. In the small HOMO offset system, the energetic differences between the CT and singlet states of the acceptors are smaller, which is more conducive to reduce ΔE3.46,47 In addition, lower HOMO offsets can reduce the energy difference between the locally excited state (LE) and the CT states that can increase the radiative rate to improve EQEEL of devices and achieve a reduced ΔE3.62 These four OSCs with flat HOMO offsets exhibit low non-radiative voltage losses, so the devices exhibit high Voc surpassing 0.90 eV.

Transport and recombination of charge carriers
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were investigated to understand the charge transfer process of the active layer. The fluorescence spectra of neat small-molecule acceptor and blend films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The neat S1-N1F film displays a weak PL intensity from 700 to 1100 nm. In comparison, the neat S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F films exhibit much stronger PL intensity. The PL spectra of these acceptors in dilute solutions are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). There is no significant difference in PL intensity among the four molecules in solutions. Compared with the PL spectra of these molecules in films, the S1-N1F film shows a much weaker PL intensity than the S2-N1F film. This difference may be caused by the strong intermolecular interaction and close π–π stacking of S1-N1F, which can result in fluorescence quenching due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect.66 As for the blend films, the PL intensities of the blended PBDB-T:S1-N2F/S2-N1F/S2-N2F films are significantly reduced. The PL quenching values at ∼860 nm of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are 75%, 90%, 86% and 87%, respectively, which reveals that the emission of S1-N2F is more efficiently quenched by PBDB-T, indicating efficient charge transfer between the polymer donor and acceptors. These PL quenching results can partially explain why the Jsc and FF values of S1-N2F-based solar cells are higher than those of the other three devices.
In light of the relatively high PL quenching efficiency, it seems that a small ΔHOMO (<0.1eV) may still allow for efficient hole transfers from acceptor to donor. To further investigate the hole-transfer dynamics, we carried out femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4 and Fig. S9 (ESI†). An excitation wavelength of 800 nm was selected here to excite only acceptors without exciting donors in the D:A blends to explore the hole-transfer process from the acceptor to PBDB-T. The color plot of TA spectra for PBDB-T:S1-N1F, PBDB-T:S1-N2F, PBDB-T:S2-N1F and PBDB-T:S2-N2F blend films after 800 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 4a–d, and a few representative TA spectra at various delay times are displayed in Fig. 4e–h. As shown in Fig. 4e–h, the bleach peaks at 660–850 nm appear in both neat acceptor films (Fig. S9, ESI†) and blend films, corresponding to the ground-state bleach (GSB) of the absorption transition in acceptor due to photoexcitation. With the decay of the acceptor bleach peak at 660–850 nm, a few clear bleach peaks at 550–660 nm appear in the TA spectrum of blend films, which matches very well with the absorption features of PBDB-T film (Fig. S9, ESI†). As indicated in Fig. 4e and f (PBDB-T:S1-N1F and PBDB-T:S1-N2F), the negative signals at 640 nm rise and near 750 nm decay with time are accompanied by a red shift. However, as shown in Fig. 4g and h, for PBDB-T:S2-N1F and PBDB-T:S2-N2F blend films, the two negative signals change more rapidly with time along with a more remarkable red shift.

By comparing the GSB signal probed at 640 nm, hole transfer dynamics can be studied by fitting it to a biexponential function. The charge transfer lifetimes are derived to be τ1 = 1.97 ± 0.34 ps and τ2 = 117.58 ± 4.83 ps in PBDB-T:S1-N1F; τ1 = 1.61 ± 0.24 ps and τ2 = 34.99 ± 3.92 ps in PBDB-T: S1-N2F; τ1 = 1.19 ± 0.30 ps and τ2 = 13.55 ± 1.52 ps in PBDB-T: S2-N1F; and τ1 = 0.92 ± 0.08 ps and τ2 = 12.81 ± 0.48 ps in PBDB-T: S2-N2F. The fast component τ1 is commonly assigned to the dissociation of the acceptor exciton formed at the D:A interface, while the second component τ2 is attributed to the diffusion-limited dissociation of bulk excitons. The fitting results indicate that the hole transport process becomes faster with an increase in the HOMO offset.
Moreover, the kinetic traces at selected wavelengths are acquired to quantitatively evaluate the hole-transfer dynamics (Fig. 4i–l). As shown in Fig. 4j, the bleach decay process of photoexcited S1-N2F (GSB signal probe at 750 nm) agrees well with the rising process of the PBDB-T (GSB signal probe at 630 nm), confirming photoexcited hole transfer from S1-N2F to PBDB-T, despite the near-zero HOMO offset. The negative GSB signal in PBDB-T increases with a time of ∼105 ps, corresponding to the hole transfer progress.46 Given that a suppressed charge recombination can be reflected by the increase in charge separated state lifetime,48,63 we further explored charge carrier dynamics based on the TA decays in timescales probed at 750 nm (Fig. S10, ESI†), which mainly undergo charge recombination process.47 A clear trend is observed in which the OSCs under a near-zero HOMO offset are associated with a longer charge recombination process. As shown in Fig. 4k and l, both PBDB-T:S2-N1F and PBDB-T:S2-N2F blend films with larger HOMO offsets show faster hole transfer of ∼65 ps and ∼60 ps, respectively. Interestingly, although PBDB-T:S2-N1F and PBDB-T:S2-N2F blend films have faster interfacial hole transfer processes, faster charge recombination might occur, which can lead to poorer solar cell performances.46,64 For PBDB-T:S1-N1F blend film with 0 eV HOMO offset, however, it shows a continuous increase in hole population in the donor, suggesting much slower hole transfer (Fig. 4i). The hole transfer process (∼300 ps) in PBDB-T:S1-N1F blend film is approximately three times slower than those in other blend films. Therefore, the poor photovoltaic performance of PBDB-T:S1-N1F-based devices can be attributed to an insufficient driving force for hole transfer. The comparison of photoinduced hole transfer clearly shows that a slightly positive HOMO offset is sufficient for fast and efficient hole transfer, which can well explain why S1-N2F-based devices with a 0.03 eV HOMO offset show an optimal PCE of 13.59% and a high Voc of 0.94 V.
To further investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics of OSCs, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) is measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. Here, Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD denote the current densities in light and dark, respectively. Veff is defined as V0–V, where V denotes the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage when JL = JD. The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) could be calculated from the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively, where Jsat refers to the saturation current at a high Veff. For S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based OSCs, the corresponding values of Pdiss are calculated to be 88.4%, 94.1%, 91.4%, and 92.2%, respectively. A similar trend can also be found in Pcoll, which is 80.7%, 85.2%, 82.2%, and 82.9%, respectively. The S1-N2F-based device has the highest Pdiss and Pcoll values among these acceptor-based cells, indicating that it has effective charge separation, transportation and collection in the active layer, which is in accordance with its highest EQE response and PCE. However, the S1-N1F-based device with the HOMO offset of 0 eV is unable to achieve more effective charge separation, transportation and collection. Additionally, the charge recombination of S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based devices is investigated by measuring Jsc under various light intensities (Plight). The relationship of Jsc and Plight follows the equation Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is used to evaluate the degree of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 5b, the α values are 0.87, 0.96, 0.92 and 0.90 for S1-N1F-, S1-N2F-, S2-N1F- and S2-N2F-based devices, respectively. The α value is closer to unity for S1-N2F-based devices, demonstrating that bimolecular recombination can be well suppressed.

The hole-only and electron-only mobilities of the optimal PBDB-T:acceptor blend films are measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only and electron-only devices are fabricated using the reported methods. The results are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 5c-d. Devices based on S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F exhibit hole mobilities (μh) of 1.38 × 10−4, 1.65 × 10−4, 1.62 × 10−4 and 1.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s −1, respectively; a similar trend is observed for the corresponding electron mobilities (μe) of 9.54 × 10−5, 1.40 × 10−4, 1.16 × 10−4 and 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s −1, respectively. Among the four acceptors, the S1-N2F-based device has the highest μh and μe, and the μh/μe value is only 1.18. The high and balanced charge mobilities of the S1-N2F-based devices are consistent with the high Jsc and FF values. Compared with the other devices, the S1-N1F-based devices show the lowest and unbalanced mobilities (μh/μe = 1.45), which results in low Jsc and FF.
Morphological properties
To determine the relationships of molecular structures, active layer morphology, and photovoltaic performance based on PBDB-T:acceptors, atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging are performed. The results of TEM are summarized in Fig. S12 (ESI†). All the blend films show uniform nano morphologies without large scale phase separation. As shown in Fig. 6, the blend films of PBDB-T:S1-N1F and PBDB-T:S1-N2F exhibit root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 2.90 and 3.95 nm, respectively. Slightly smaller RMS roughness values of 1.23 and 2.00 nm are observed in the blend films based on PBDB-T:S2-N1F and PBDB-T:S2-N2F, which can originate from slight solubilities for S2-N1F and S2-N2F than acceptors S1-N1F and S1-N2F with linear alkyl chains. To obtain the miscibility of active layers, we carry out the contact angle test and calculate the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) (Fig. 7 and Table S6, S7, ESI†). The χ values of S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F are 0.81, 0.84, 0.59 and 0.68, respectively. S1-N1F and S1-N2F possess slightly higher χ values than the other two small molecular acceptors S2-N1F and S2-N2F; they have poorer miscibility with PBDB-T, which is consistent with AFM results.

Conclusions
We synthesized four 10,11-dihydrodiindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT)-based SMAs, namely S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F. Increased HOMO offsets of 0, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.06 eV are observed when blending S1-N1F, S1-N2F, S2-N1F and S2-N2F with PBDB-T, respectively. Among these four acceptors, S1-N1F:PBDB-T-based OSCs with a HOMO offset of 0 eV show the lowest Jsc and FF values, resulting in an unsatisfactory PCE of 7.94% owing to the insufficient driving force for effective charge separation. Regardless of a near zero HOMO offset (0.03 eV), S1-N2F:PBDB-T-based OSCs show the highest PCE of 13.59% with a high Voc of 0.94 V along with a comparable FF up to 74.30%, which is the highest Voc value among single-junction OSCs with an FF over 74%. For S2-N1F-and S2-N2F-based OSCs, only moderate Jsc values of 17.07 and 17.82 mA cm−2 and FF values of 62.14 and 70.33% are achieved, resulting in low PCEs of 10.35 and 11.59%, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements indicate that a 0.03 eV HOMO offset is enough for efficient charge transfer, while a larger HOMO offset has a faster interfacial hole transfer process and faster charge recombination. This study not only provides the validity of high-performance OSCs operating well at a near zero HOMO offset but also gives insight into the charge dynamics of these blends to gain deeper understanding for further improving the performance of OSCs.
