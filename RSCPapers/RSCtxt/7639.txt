, Accepted 27th April 2015First published on 27th April 2015AbstractInstead of using a metal grid line as the top electrode for Si nanocone/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, herein we utilize a fully covered thin layer of transparent MoO3/Ag/ZnS to efficiently collect photo-generated charge carriers without sacrificing photon absorption. Vertical silicon nanocone (SiNC) arrays with short cone lengths are prepared by a metal-assisted chemical etching technique. Such a unique structure favors the subsequent infiltration of PEDOT:PSS into the nanocone array. In addition to decent antireflection and light trapping properties, which can be attributed to the nanostructure array, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid solar cells reaches 5.12% upon optimizing the length of the nanocone and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer. This paper not only provides an elaborate investigation on Si-based hybrid solar cells, but also gives a universal methodology for the preparation of transparent electrodes for other categories of photoelectric devices.
Introduction
Recently, it has been demonstrated that organic/inorganic hybrid photovoltaic devices show merit for meeting the urgent requirements of developing solar cells with cost advantages, environmental friendliness and high efficiencies.1–5 One of the most promising candidates is a Si-based hybrid solar cell, and high energy conversion efficiencies of over 5% are usually reported for it.6–9 In particular, Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid devices have attracted substantial attention because of their low-cost processing and high efficiencies.10–15 The conventional pathway to fabricate the devices is by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS on a planar Si substrate; however, such a morphology is disadvantageous for the further improvement of conversion efficiencies due to the low light absorption coefficient and short charge carrier diffusion length of Si.16 Therefore, the transformation of the planar Si into a one dimensional (1D) Si nanostructure array is highly required. With this strategy, anti-reflection and scattering effects could be introduced to the system, which could greatly enhance the corresponding light absorption efficiency.10,17–22 Moreover, the nanostructuralized architecture could also promote the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and reduce the corresponding possibility of recombination.23 Though there are a few reports on Si 1D nanostructure arrays/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, elaborate studies on optimizing the 1D nanostructure geometrical parameters and thickness of PEDOT:PSS for improving the overall efficiency are scarce due to the difficulty of infiltrating PEDOT:PSS into the nanostructure array.
Most Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells employ a metal grid line as the top electrode on the light-incident side. However, this design leads to a dilemma for researchers. A low coverage by the metal grid could reduce the efficiency of photo-generated charge collection. If the coverage is high, light absorption by the active layer could be deteriorated.24 To address this issue, we introduce a transparent top electrode on SiNC array/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells. The electrode consisting of a tri-layer of MoO3/Ag/ZnS could also be applied to other photoelectronic devices. After optimizing the length of the nanocone and the thickness of the polymer, the hybrid solar cell with an overall structure of Al/n-SiNC/PEDOT:PSS/MoO3/Ag/ZnS exhibits a PCE of 5.12% with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 24.21 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.4 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.53.
Experimental section
1. Materials
The phosphorus (P) doped n-type Si (100) wafers with a thickness of 200 μm, a resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm2 and a doping density of 5 × 1014 to 5 × 1015 cm−3 from Shanghai Jing Ji Electronic Technology Company were used. Acetone, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) were purchased from Beijing chemical industry. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS 1000) was obtained from Heraeus. Fluorosurfactant Capstone® FS-31 was purchased from DuPont™. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), silver (Ag) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) were purchased from China New Metal Materials Technology Company. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
2. Preparation of n-type SiNC arrays
The SiNC arrays were fabricated by a metal-assisted chemical etching. First, the Si wafers were cleaned by acetone and deionized water for 10 min each, then immersed in a piranha solution composed of H2SO4 and H2O2 (7:3, v/v) for 50 min, thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and soaked in 5% HF solution for 5 min to remove the native oxide on the surface. Second, the Si wafers were immersed in an etchant consisting of 4.6 M HF and 0.02 M AgNO3. The length of the SiNCs could be effectively controlled by adjusting the etching time. Third, the SiNCs were treated with HNO3 (30%) to remove Ag nanoparticles, rinsed with deionized water (DI) and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Finally, the SiNCs were immediately transferred into a nitrogen glove box with O2 < 0.1 ppm and H2O < 0.1 ppm.
3. Fabrication of SiNCs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells
All the fabrication procedures were carried out in a nitrogen glove box. An aluminium (Al) rear electrode with 100 nm thickness was deposited on the back side of the SiNCs by thermal evaporation. To improve the conductivity and quality of PEDOT:PSS layer, 5% DMSO and 0.1% FS-31 were blended with the PEDOT:PSS solution. Then, the solution was spin-coated onto the SiNCs at different speeds. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 140 °C for 20 min to remove the residual water in PEDOT:PSS. The transparent electrode was made by the following steps. A 7 nm thick MoO3 layer was first deposited on the surface of SiNC/PEDOT:PSS layers at a rate of 0.2–0.3 Å s−1. Then, a 17 nm thick Ag layer was thermally deposited on the MoO3 layer at a rate of 0.5–0.7 Å s−1. Finally, a 7 nm thick ZnS layer was deposited on the Ag layer at a rate of 0.2–0.4 Å s−1.
4. Characterization
The morphology of SiNCs coated with and without electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; NanoSEM650, Nova™). The reflection spectrum was obtained at room temperature using a fiber-optic spectrometer (Avaspec-2048, AvantesBV™) equipped with an integrating sphere. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a Zolix SCS100. The current density–voltage (J–V) characterizations were carried out using a Keithley 2450 source meter with 1 sun air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination.
Result and discussion
A photograph of a real device studied in this paper is given in Fig. 1a, in which the active area can be estimated to be 0.04 cm2 by the ruler underneath. Fig. 1b shows the schematic structure of the SiNC/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, where an ordered heterojunction structure is particularly presented. In comparison with a bulk heterojunction structure, this homogeneously distributed architecture has great advantages. As shown in Fig. 1c, the built-in electric field in the ordered heterojunction structure supplies a driving force to separate the photo-generated charge carriers, with excited holes being transferred to the polymer and electrons being conducted to the electrode through SiNCs directly. However, for the bulk heterojunction structure, the conduction of the electrons in the discretely distributed inorganic nanoparticles is not easy and the electrons can only be collected by the electrode through an inefficient hopping procedure between the nanoparticles, as displayed in Fig. 1d. In our system, an Al rear electrode is employed to collect electrons and PEDOT:PSS with a high conductivity is utilized to form a Schottky junction with SiNC arrays. Herein, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is transparent and helpful for the absorption of incident light by SiNCs. To improve the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS, we have added 5% DMSO and 0.1% FS-31 into the PEDOT:PSS solution, and the final film becomes superior to the undoped film, as reported by Chi et al.25

To optimize the performance of the hybrid solar cells, the SiNCs were purposely fabricated with various lengths using a metal-assisted chemical etching technique with etching times of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 min. Fig. 2a presents the reflectance spectra of the Si/PEDOT:PSS Schottky junction with different lengths of SiNCs. The planar Si exhibits an average reflectance of more than 20% over a wavelength range from 380 to 1050 nm, while the SiNCs show a reflectance of 10–20% in this region. It should be noted that with an increase in nanocone length, the reflectance shows a decaying tendency, indicative of a light-harvesting capability induced by the long nanocone arrays.

(b) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the hybrid solar cells with the different lengths of SiNCs. (c) IPCE spectra of the hybrid solar cells with the different lengths of SiNCs. 
However, this does not mean that the long nanocone array usually results in high energy conversion efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the solar cell with 3 min etched nanocone array presents the best JSC, FF, and PCE. To make the results comparable, the spin-coating speed of PEDOT:PSS for these samples was fixed at 2000 rpm. The highest PCE of the 3 min etched sample is 4.42% and its JSC is increased to 22.48 mA cm−2 when the planar architecture is transformed to nanocone arrays. We attribute the large improvement to the antireflective effect of the SiNC structure. However, compared with the VOC of planar Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, the VOC of the SiNC/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells decreases from 0.44 V to 0.41 V. The main reason is that the nanoscale texturing results in a high density of surface states on the nanostructure, and therefore the recombination rates of charge carriers are increased. Moreover, with the increase in the length of SiNCs, the JSC and FF decrease possibly due to the difficulty of infiltrating the polymer into the long SiNC arrays, which leaves a large area of SiNC uncovered by the polymer. Fig. 2c shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices with different nanocone lengths. With the increase of the cone lengths, the spectra become broader, suggesting that this improvement is caused by the enhancement in the absorption, which is induced by the antireflective effect of the nanocone arrays. By comparing the IPCE values, it is clearly observed that the sample with a 3 min etching time presents the highest values, which is in good agreement with the J–V analysis.

Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the reflectance spectra of the 3 min etched SiNCs with 2000 rpm spin-coated PEDOT:PSS before and after the fabrication of the transparent electrode. Although the device exhibits an increase in the reflectance and indicates a decreased absorption by the active layer, after the deposition of the transparent electrode, a pronounced JSC of 22.48 mA cm−2 can be still attained, demonstrating the feasibility of this particular transparent electrode. To show the advantage of the transparent electrode, we also present the reflectance spectrum of a device with a non-transparent electrode, which was made by an Ag grid line. The area of the metal grid line takes up half of the total active area to efficiently collect the charge carriers. By comparison of these spectra, it can be concluded that the device with a transparent electrode is superior over that with a non-transparent electrode for improving the light absorption of the active layer.

To further investigate the optimized structure, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed. Fig. 4(a)–(e) display the 20° tilted side-view and cross-sectional SEM images of SiNCs with different etching times. With the increase in etching time from 1 to 9 min, the average diameter, depth and spacing of each sample are enhanced from 28 to 40 nm, from 27 to 130 nm and from 35 to 82 nm, respectively. Though the morphology of the nanocones is not uniform probably because of the low doping density of the Si wafer, such non-uniformity, within a certain range, is also of merit because it makes use of the advantages of nanocones with different depths. The longer depth is beneficial for light harvesting, whereas the shorter depth is beneficial for reducing the surface states and the transport length of the charge carriers. An SEM image of SiNCs coated with PEDOT:PSS and a transparent electrode is shown in Fig. 4f, where we could clearly observe a continuous film over the SiNC/PEDOT:PSS layer. This film is the optically transparent layer of MoO3/Ag/ZnS. The contact of all these layers appears to be satisfactory.

(f) 20°-tilted side-view and cross-sectional SEM image of SiNC/PEDOT:PSS layer coated with a transparent electrode. (g)–(i) 20°-tilted side-view of the SiNCs coated with PEDOT:PSS with spinning speeds of 1000, 5000 and 7000 rpm, respectively. All the scale bars are 100 nm. 
On the other hand, the absorption by PEDOT:PSS also causes inefficient utilization of the incident light. However, the polymer layer cannot be very thin; otherwise, the collection efficiency of the charge carriers could be negatively impacted. To investigate this more deeply, the thickness of PEDOT:PSS on the morphologically optimized SiNC structure was optimized. Fig. 4(g)–(i) exhibit the representative SEM images of SiNCs/PEDOT:PSS with different polymer spin-coating rates. Though it is not easy to discern the Si from PEDOT:PSS due to the similarity of the backgrounds of these two materials, the thicknesses of the polymer were estimated to be 17 nm (1000 rpm), 10 nm (5000 rpm) and 6 nm (7000 rpm) by subtracting the average thickness of the SiNCs from the average thickness of the SiNCs/PEDOT:PSS sample. Obviously, a faster spin-coating rate results in a thinner polymer. In addition, the fast spin-coating also makes the polymer layer compact, which could facilitate the transport of the photo-generated carriers. However, the rate should not be very high (such as 7000 rpm) because the 6 nm ultrathin layer is not continuous, which could deteriorate the conduction of the charge carriers.
Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the solar cells with different PEDOT:PSS thicknesses, which were controlled by the rate of spin-coating. The details in the performance parameters are also given in Table 2. All these results indicate that the device prepared with a spinning speed of 5000 rpm exhibits the best performance. The highest PCE achieved is 5.12% with JSC and FF both higher than the other samples. To support this observation, the according IPCE spectra are displayed in Fig. 5b. Consistent with the J–V performance, the sample prepared by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm presents the highest IPCE value among these devices, which is close to 70%.
