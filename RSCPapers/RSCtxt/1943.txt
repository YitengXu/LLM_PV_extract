    , Accepted 13th February 2015First published on 16th February 2015AbstractA tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoplate array is fabricated directly on the FTO/glass substrate and used as a platinum (Pt) nanoscale supporter for a highly efficient and low Pt-consumption counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). A Pt/WO3 composite structure, with Pt nanoparticles having a diameter of 2–3 nm, increases the electrochemical catalytic activity in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide. Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency is increased from less than 1% for WO3 CE and 8.1% for Pt CE, respectively, to 8.9% for Pt/WO3 CE. Moreover, the use of Pt/WO3 CE can dramatically reduce the consumption of scarce Pt material, with a relatively low Pt-loading of ∼2 μg cm−2, while maintaining a much better performance. The excellent performance of Pt/WO3 CE is attributed to the efficient electron injection and transport via WO3 supporters, as well as the nanostructure array morphology of WO3 for deposition of fine Pt nanoparticles. This work provides an approach for developing highly catalytic and low-cost Pt based CEs, which also has implications for the development of Pt/WO3 nanoplate arrays for other applications.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been rapidly developed in recent years for their unique advantages including low-cost, high energy conversion efficiency and simple production procedure.1–3 A counter electrode (CE), catalyzing the reduction of triiodide, is one of the important components in the DSC. Despite the increasing studies on alternative CEs, such as carbonaceous nanomaterials,4 transition metal sulfides/nitrides,5 polymers, and their composites,6,7 the most commonly used and efficient CE is still platinum (Pt) CE which exhibits high catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. As Pt is scarce and expensive, reducing the usage of Pt in CE is crucial for lowering the cost of DSCs. Increasing the catalytic activity of Pt CE while maintaining low Pt-loading is of great importance for highly efficient and low-cost DSCs.
The catalytic activity of Pt CE is determined by the catalytic surface area confined by the total surface area of Pt nanoparticles. Recent studies also demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Pt CE and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding DSC can be improved by optimizing the morphology of Pt.8–10 However, Pt nanoparticles tend to agglomerate due to the fast diffusion and coalescence of metal atoms on the substrate surface even when the thickness of the Pt film is thin.11,12 The dispersion of Pt inside the nanoscale supporters will reduce its agglomeration, thus increasing the effective electrocatalytic area due to the large specific surface area of supporters, which thereby leads to high catalytic activity. Therefore, a few attempts were made using carbonous nanomaterials or some metal compounds (e.g. TiO2) as nanoscale supporters.13–15 Nevertheless, the supporters fabricated from powder (such as graphene) face challenges in adhesion with the underneath fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrates and thus in the long term stability. Ordered nanostructures directly growing on FTO substrates will avoid this problem and retain the advantages of nanoscale supporters, and offer the distinct advantage of ready integration into a device architecture for electronic, electrochemical catalytic and optical applications. Thus, they have the potential to be more suitable for constructing composite CEs with Pt for highly efficient DSCs.
Moreover, to reduce Pt-loading, the nominal thickness of Pt needs to be as thin as possible. Studies show that a nominal Pt thickness of 1–3 nm is more efficient than thicker Pt films.16 With such a low Pt-loading, Pt nanoparticles are inconsequential, and in Pt/supporter CE, the electrons need to be injected and transported via the supporter from FTO to inconsecutive Pt nanoparticles. Therefore, the electronic properties of the supporter, though rarely considered, will also play important roles in determining the catalytic performance of composite CEs.
Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a versatile material, and has attracted considerable attention due to its applications in electrochromic, photocatalytic, and gas sensing materials.17,18 In addition, WO3 is an n-type semiconductor with inherently good electron transport properties, and its conduction band can provide sufficient potential for electron injection from FTO and to Pt since it is located at approximately 0.3 eV versus NHE.19,20 Hence, WO3 is probably able to mediate electron injection and transport from FTO to Pt. However, unlike TiO2, the direct growth of WO3 nanostructure arrays on the FTO/glass using a facile hydrothermal method is hard to be achieved due to the uneven deposition of WO3 on the FTO/glass.20–22 The fabrication procedures generally employ a WO3 seed layer which introduces grain boundaries.21 Therefore, it is considered to be important to control the growth of vertically nanostructured WO3 arrays directly on FTO/glass substrates to accelerate electron transport between FTO and WO3.
Hence, in this work, a procedure for the direct growth of the WO3 nanostructure array was proposed using the hydrothermal method. Then the as-prepared WO3 nanoplate array was opted to be incorporated with Pt as highly efficient CE for DSCs. As expected, a DSC using WO3 nanoplate array supported Pt as CE shows obviously higher efficiency than that using pristine Pt CE. The factors for improvement have been investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of WO3 on FTO glass
In a typical synthesis, 0.231 g of sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O) was dissolved in 15 ml de-ionized water. 5 ml HCl (3 mol L−1) aqueous solution was added to the above solution and stirred, and then a yellow precipitate gradually formed in the solution. Different amounts of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) were added to the above solution to control the thickness of the WO3 film on FTO. Then 1.260 g of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) was added to the mixed solution followed by stirring for 30 min. After stirring, the mixed solution was diluted to 40 ml with de-ionized water and subsequently transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. FTO/glass substrates, which were previously cleaned and treated with ozone, were placed in the autoclave with the FTO side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 180 °C for 8 h. After cooling down to room temperature, FTO/glass substrates covered by the WO3 film were taken out and rinsed with de-ionized water, followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.2. Fabrication of counter electrode and DSCs
Pt and Pt/WO3 CEs were fabricated by sputtering Pt on pristine and WO3 coated FTO/glass substrates, respectively. The sputtering was conducted using a DC sputtering system (Quorum Q150TS) with a sputtering current of 10 mA, a working gas (Ar, 99.999%) pressure of 0.01 mbar, a target to substrate working distance of 54 mm and a period of 20–60 seconds without substrate heating (corresponding to a nominal thickness of 1–3 nm and a Pt-loading of 2–6 μg cm−2). A TiO2 mesoporous layer and a scattering layer were prepared by doctor-blading of TiO2 nanoparticle (P25) slurry and TiO2 microsphere (200 nm in diameter) slurry subsequently on FTO/glass substrates, respectively. All of the TiO2 films were post-treated with TiCl4. After calcination, TiO2 films were immersed in 0.3 mmol l−1 ethanol solution of N719 dye for 24 hours. DSCs were fabricated by assembling dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes with as-fabricated CEs using a 30 μm thick Surlyn I−/I3− electrolyte with acetonitrile as the solvent. Symmetric cells for electrochemical measurements were fabricated by assembling two identical CEs together using 30 μm thick Surlyn.
2.3. Characterization
The structure and morphology of the materials were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 200F), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent 5500). Current density–voltage curves of DSCs were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5G irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (XES-301S+EL-100). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out using the electrochemical workstation (CHI660D), performed on symmetric cells. The frequency range varied from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
FTO/glass substrates were primarily treated with ozone to form a uniform hydrophilic surface by homogeneous nucleation of WO3 molecules from an aqueous solution in the initial step. The formation of WO3 from a tungstate ion solution using concentrated acid can be explained by the following equations:23Na2WO4 + 2H+ → H2WO4 + 2Na+H2WO4 → WO3 + H2O
It was observed that the yellow precipitate of H2WO4 generated from 0.231 g Na2WO4·2H2O could not be dissolved totally without the presence of oxalic acid (H2C2O4). Hence, different amounts of H2C2O4 (0–0.630 g) were added to the reaction solution to control the concentration of H2WO4, and the generation rate of WO3. SEM images of as-prepared WO3 on FTO are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the presence of H2C2O4 in the reaction solution is critical to the growth of WO3 nanostructure arrays. By increasing the concentration of H2C2O4, different nanostructures, including nanobelts, novel hierarchical flower-like structures constructed by nanobelts and nanowires, and plate-like nanostructures, can be obtained on FTO/glass substrates. It is found that these WO3 films exhibit good adhesion with FTO/glass substrates as evidenced by conventional tape tests, which is beneficial for the long-term stability of the related DSCs. These WO3/FTO/glass samples with different WO3 morphologies are supposed to possess different properties. In the present case, WO3 nanostructure arrays are used as Pt supporters and electron transport material, the plate-like WO3 nanostructure array (shown in Fig. 1d and 1i, defined as the WO3 nanoplate array) with a direct transport path, facilitated by its plate-like structure and vertical growth on FTO, is more suitable and is opted to be incorporated with Pt as counter electrodes (CEs).

To achieve a high surface area, a porous layer of the WO3 nanoplate array was prepared by decreasing the concentration of the reactants. An SEM image of the as-prepared WO3 is shown in Fig. 2a. WO3 still exhibits a plate-like structure with nanoscale structures on its surface, and the WO3 array grows vertically to the FTO/glass substrate. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared WO3 product show that it is consisted of WO3 and WO3·0.33H2O (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). WO3 exhibits a monoclinic structure (JCPDS no. 431035) while WO3·0.33H2O is an orthorhombic-type structure (JCPDS no. 350270). The TEM image of the WO3 nanoplate shown in Fig. 2b indicates that the WO3 nanoplate is composed of multi-layers of WO3 sheets which provide a large surface area for Pt deposition.

After sputtering a spot of Pt, the surface of WO3 is decorated by Pt nanoparticles. To achieve a low Pt consumption, the sputtering period of Pt is controlled to 20 s (corresponding to a nominal thickness of 1 nm and a low Pt-loading of ∼2 μg cm−2). The SEM image of the Pt/WO3 electrode was also characterized, which exhibited a similar morphology to the pristine WO3 electrode and is not shown here. Fig. 2c shows the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of Pt/WO3. The lattice spacings of WO3 nanoplate are around 0.384 and 0.370 nm, which are extremely close to the values of (002) and (200) lattice spacing, respectively, according to JCPDS card no. 431035. The lattice spacing of Pt nanoparticles is around 0.234 nm, which corresponds to its (111) lattice spacing. It also shows that Pt nanoparticles, 2–3 nm in diameter, distribute discretely on the WO3 surface. Therefore, they are hard to identify in SEM images. The Pt nanoparticles directly deposited on FTO/glass substrates have also been characterized by HRTEM and shown in Fig. 2d. It can be seen that the morphology of the Pt nanoparticles is not regular and the size is also larger than that on the WO3 nanoplate, which is probably due to the coalescing of the Pt nanoparticles on the FTO surface. This observation is similar to a previous report which revealed that Pt particles begin to coalesce when the nominal thickness of Pt is more than 0.75 nm measured using the TEM technique.11 For further evaluating the impact of WO3 supporter on the morphology of Pt, a larger amount of Pt (3 nm) was also deposited on FTO and WO3 nanoplate supporters. HRTEM images (Fig. S2†) clearly reveal the coalescing of Pt nanoparticles on the FTO surface, whereas on the WO3 surface, the Pt nanoparticles are distributed discretely with diameters in the range of 2–5 nm. In addition, AFM and Kelvin potential force microscopy (KPFM) (Fig. S3†) were also employed, which also indicate that Pt nanoparticles distribute heterogeneously on the FTO surface even in the case of a Pt film with 1 nm nominal thickness.
The small size of Pt nanoparticles in Pt/WO3 CE is probably due to the increased deposition area for Pt on the WO3 surface, which avoids the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles and benefit for deposition of fine Pt nanoparticles. In a DSC, the oxidized site (I3−) of the redox couple captures two electrons from CE and is reduced to 3I−. As the catalytic surface is confined by the total surface area of Pt nanoparticles, the catalytic surface in Pt/WO3 CE is increased due to the formation of fine Pt nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the porous WO3 film helps in the diffusion of the I−/I3− redox couple. Therefore, the use of Pt/WO3 CE has potential to improve the photovoltaic performance of the related DSC.
The photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of the DSCs using different CEs are shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic parameters including the short circuit current density (JSC), the open circuit voltage (VOC), the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are extracted from the J–V curves and summarized with the standard deviations (J–V curves with error bars are shown in Fig. S4†) in Table 1. As expected, the JSC is obviously higher for DSC using Pt/WO3 CE (17.9 mA cm−2) than that using Pt CE (15.9 mA cm−2) with the same consumption of Pt (with a nominal thickness of 1 nm). The FF and VOC are similar in these two kinds of DSCs, as shown in Table 1. As a result, the PCE is increased from 8.1% for Pt CE to 8.9% for Pt/WO3 CE. The calculated standard deviations of the PCE from these two kinds of DSCs are around 0.1%, indicating that the significant difference (0.8%) in PCE of DSCs with or without the WO3 supporter is due to the intrinsic kinetics rather than experimental errors. It is demonstrated that Pt (1 nm)/WO3 CE is also more efficient than the best performing Pt/FTO CE with an optimized Pt thickness (as shown in Fig. S5a†). When the nominal thickness of Pt is increased to an optimized value of 3 nm (sputtered for 60 s), JSC and PCE are only slightly higher over those of DSC using 1 nm thick Pt CE. Pt/WO3 CE is the most efficient, despite the much lower Pt-loading in Pt/WO3 CE (sputtered for 20 s). The improvement in cell performance agrees with the formation of fine and discrete Pt nanoparticles on the WO3 nanoplate surface. Therefore, the use of the WO3 nanoplate array as a Pt support is efficient in enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSC and reducing the consumption of scarce Pt material, demonstrating the high potential of Pt/WO3 CE for its use in highly efficient and low-cost DSCs.

In addition, it has also been proven that a WO3 array is critical for efficiency improvement. WO3 nanoparticles have also been used as Pt supporters, but the related DSCs present no improvements in the photovoltaic performance even with a relatively thin WO3 nanoparticle film (<400 nm) (Fig. S5b†). The efficacy difference of a WO3 nanoplate array and nanoparticle film in improving the performance of DSCs is related to their different electrical properties and will be discussed in the later part. Besides, it is found that the DSC using pristine WO3 generally yields a low FF less than 10% and a PCE less than 1% (Fig. S5b†), indicating the poor catalytic activity of WO3 for triiodide reduction. Moreover, the impact of the WO3 on the stability of the DSCs has also been investigated at elevated temperatures (as shown in Fig. S6†). It is observed that the loss of PCE due to high temperature ageing is similar in DSCs using Pt CE and Pt/WO3 CE, implying that the introduction of WO3 into the CE has not caused additional degradation processes.
It is obvious that the higher JSC using WO3/Pt CE is responsible for the higher efficiency. As the DSCs have universal photoanodes but different CEs, the photo-generated current (Iph) from these DSCs shall have less difference. Hence, the difference in JSC is mainly caused by the series resistance of the device, and a larger JSC corresponds to a lower series resistance. In a DSC, with the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 4a, the series resistance is composed of the series resistance at the FTO/electrode contact and in the electrode (RS), the charge transfer resistance at an electrolyte–CE interface (Rct2), and the Nernst diffusion impedance of the redox couple in the electrolyte (ZN).24

To study the kinetics in determining the difference of the series resistance between the DSCs, symmetric cells, with the equivalent circuit (shown in Fig. 4b inset) containing all the elements in the series resistance,25,26 were fabricated with two identical CEs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out and the Nyquist plots from different CEs are shown in Fig. 4b. The values of RS and Rct2 from Pt and Pt/WO3 CEs were obtained by fitting the experimental spectra with an equivalent circuit using Zview software, and are listed with the standard deviations in Table 1. It is obvious that RS is smaller in Pt/WO3 CE (4.53 ± 0.17 Ω cm2) than in Pt CE (5.22 ± 0.06 Ω cm2), indicating good contact between Pt/WO3 CE and FTO due to the direct growth of WO3 on FTO and the excellent electron transport in WO3 nanoplate arrays. Rct2, which associates with the catalytic properties of a CE, is also lower in Pt/WO3 CE (0.77 ± 0.01 Ω cm2) than in Pt CE (0.90 ± 0.02 Ω cm2). Since the Rct2 varies inversely with the catalytic activity, a lower Rct2 in Pt/WO3 CE indicates a higher catalytic activity of Pt/WO3 CE for I3− reduction.
Tafel polarization measurement is also a powerful method to characterize the electrochemical properties. Fig. 4c shows the Tafel plots of the symmetric cells similar to the ones used in EIS measurements, which describe the dependence of electrical current density (J) on electrode potential. The exchange current density (J0), which is directly related to the catalytic activity of the electrode, can be calculated from the intersection of the linear anodic and cathodic curves.27 The relationship between the J0 and Rct2 follows the equation below:  where the R, T, F and N are the gas constant, the temperature, the Faraday's constant, and the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3−, respectively. Consistent with the EIS results, J0 is obviously higher in Pt/WO3 (9.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2) than in Pt CE (6.7 ± 0.1 mA cm−2), indicating that the catalytic activity of Pt/WO3 is superior to that of Pt CE.
As WO3 on its own exhibits poor catalytic activity for I3− reduction, in the absence of variations in catalytic sites, the increased catalytic activity with the use of Pt/WO3 CE results from the modification of Pt nanoparticles and the electrode by the introduction of WO3 nanoplate arrays.
A schematic illustration for the reduction process of I3− in Pt/WO3 CE is depicted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a displays the schematic structure of Pt/WO3 CE on FTO, in which Pt nanoparticles are dispersed discretely, inner WO3 nanoplate arrays, due to the low Pt-loading. When the electrons generated from the photoanode are transported from the out circuit to the FTO film, they are injected into Pt/WO3 CE and transported via WO3 nanoplates before they are captured by I3− with the assistance of the Pt catalyst. The direct growth of WO3 on FTO improves the interface contact, which makes the electron transfer from FTO to WO3 very efficient. Moreover, the inherent good electron transport property of WO3 and the direct electron transport path through the WO3 nanoplate enable the fast electron transport through WO3 nanoplate arrays. In contrast, in the film composed of WO3 nanoparticles, the physical contact at the FTO–WO3 interface and at the boundaries between WO3 nanoparticles retard electron transport and increase the recombination, thereby, the DSC using Pt/WO3 nanoparticles yields a low current density even under conditions of a much thinner WO3 nanoparticle film (<400 nm) than the WO3 nanoplate film (∼600 nm). The efficient electron transfer in Pt/WO3 nanoplate arrays is expected to be responsible for the low RS in EIS measurements. Meanwhile, I3− diffuses into the porous WO3 nanoplate array from the electrolyte. As the I3− reaches the surface of Pt nanoparticles, it captures two electrons and is reduced to 3I− (as shown in Fig. 5b). The increased surface area due to fine Pt nanoparticles and the facilitated diffusion of I−/I3− redox sites in the porous WO3 nanoplate array increase the effective catalytic surface area, thus reducing Rct2. Furthermore, from the energy level of Pt/WO3 CE shown in Fig. 5c, it can be seen that electron injection is energetically favorable both from FTO to WO3 and from WO3 to Pt. It is worth noting that the electronic properties of the supporter play a critical role under conditions of low Pt-loading. In the case of nanomaterials with a higher Fermi level than the work function of FTO, they are not able to form the Ohmic contact at the FTO/nanomaterial interface, which hinders the electron injection from FTO to Pt. In fact, it is reported that in the Pt/TiO2/ITO electrode, the activity of the CEs decreases with increasing TiO2 thickness to more than 25 nm,14 which can be ascribed to the energy level mismatch between TiO2 (n-type with a conduction band at ∼4.2 eV19) and ITO (with a work function of ∼4.7 eV).

Hence, the excellent performance of DSC using Pt/WO3 CE is attributed to the efficient electron injection and transport in CE/FTO, excellent energy level matching of Pt, WO3 and FTO nanostructure array morphology of WO3 as well as better contact between WO3 and FTO electrodes. It can be speculated that other nanostructures, possessing these properties, can also be employed as ideal Pt supporters.
Furthermore, the obtained novel WO3 nanostructure arrays and their composites with Pt are also ready to be used in other fields, such as electrochromic, hydrogen sensing, hydrogen evolution and other photoelectrochemical applications.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a WO3 nanoplate array is fabricated and used as a Pt supporter for counter electrodes in DSCs. It is demonstrated that Pt/WO3 counter electrodes possess high electrochemical catalytic activity in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide to iodide, resulting in high short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency of the related DSCs. The suitable energy level and the n-type property of WO3 are crucial, which favor efficient electron transfer from FTO to Pt. In addition, the large surface area of the WO3 nanoplate array also allows a lower consumption of the expensive Pt material. Therefore, using the Pt/WO3 nanoplate array may foster the development of highly efficient DSCs. The results have also tremendous implications for future development of the highly catalytic and low-cost Pt based CEs.
