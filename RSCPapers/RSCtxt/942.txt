    , Accepted 30th January 2008First published on 8th February 2008AbstractThis work demonstrates the feasibility of sol–gel entrapment in targeting novel photobioreactors. Photosynthetic cyanobacterial strains of the genus Synechococcus,PCC 6301, PCC 7002 and PCC 7418, were immobilised in mesoporous silica matrices via the acidification of aqueous colloidal silica precursors at ambient temperature. The conditions of immobilisation were studied. The gels were kept hydrated by the addition of media appropriate to the cyanobacteria strain isolated within the matrix and maintained under a light source. Scanning electronic microscopy, confocal microscopy and fluorometry studies revealed the preservation of photosynthetic pigments post-immobilisation. Structural and textural properties of the gels were established through 29Si MASNMR and N2 physisorption respectively.
Introduction
Evolutionary pressures typically force natural systems to become highly optimised, sophisticated and efficient. Nature continues to inspire Man to profit from such smart design. Owing to its ability to convert solar energy into chemical energy, photosynthesis is one example of a natural system scientists are keen to exploit.

        Cyanobacteria are classified as photosynthetic prokaryotes, employing the same reaction as plants to synthesise bio-organic compounds such as sucrose, starch and cellulose. The conversion of carbon dioxide into secondary metabolites not only provides a potential food and energy source but also yields the chance to minimise CO2 levels, a pollutant that is being pumped into the atmosphere at an alarming rate as our love of power continues to grow. Hence these primary producers have the ability to assimilate CO2 and provide us with a novel, reusable carbon source to replace the rapidly depleting fossil fuels.1 A perfect solution to the impending environmental catastrophe?
Furthermore, certain metabolites of microalgae are a source of expensive biochemical and pharmaceutical products2–4 and as such research is ongoing to find ways in which these metabolites can be harvested and used efficiently.
A by-product of this conversion is oxygen. It appears that Man's very existence on Earth is a direct result of the photosynthesis carried out by the ancestors of cyanobacteria. Thus, it is photosynthetic organisms that play a primordial role in biosphere research for the inhabitation of oxygen deprived atmospheres, such as the Moon or Mars.5
In addition, certain strains of cyanobacteria are capable of metabolising noxious nitrogenous6,7 and phosphorous7,8 compounds and absorbing heavy metal ions9–12 from solutions. Hence these versatile photosynthetic organisms could also play a vital role in decontaminating some of the world's pollution hotspots.
In general, biomolecules and live cells are fragile. To exploit their properties and physiological functions researchers are turning towards encapsulating materials which can both protect and preserve a light sensitive molecule or a single celled organism say, by immobilising it within a host material from which it cannot escape. Bioencapsulation is therefore an innovative sector, which is rapidly progressing from its infancy into many widespread applications such as biocatalysts,13 bioreactors,5,14 biosensors15,16 and bioartificial organs.17
In the literature several examples can be found of cyanobacterial strains immobilised within organic matrices with diverse applications. Examples include the design of a whole cell biosensor, created by the immobilisation of Synechocystis PCC 6803 in “washed agar” on a microtiter plate, capable of monitoring aquatic systems for nitrate concentration.18PCC 6803 has also been immobilised in poly(vinyl alcohol), for use as a biosensor, to detect pollutants such as HgCl2 and Diuron.19 Finally the entrapment within polysulfone and epoxy resin beads of non-viable biomass obtained from Phormidium laminosum has been suggested as a possible technology to aid effluent and industrial wastewater processing due to its capability to biosorb various heavy metals.9
However organic polymers have serious drawbacks. For instance, they have limited thermal stabilities and mechanical strengths. One of the most common immobilisation techniques involves encapsulation within alginate biopolymer beads. However in the literature there is evidence of its inadequacies: it has been revealed that the beads can rupture as the cells within them grow and divide or that there is a need for reduced phosphate levels to prevent calcium chelation and subsequent degradation of the gel.20,21 Even with chemical or physical cross-linking networks, organic polymers perform poorly when compared to inorganic materials such as silica. For this reason researchers are looking towards inorganic materials, which are often more robust and resilient to external conditions than organic based materials. Several examples of biological molecules and even whole cells encapsulated within silica, which continue to retain their activity after immobilisation, can be found in the literature. Such examples include animal cells,22,23antibodies,24,25 bacteria,26–28 particularly E. coli,29–33 enzymes,34,35 fungi,36 photosynthetic pigments,37,38plant cells,14,39proteins40 and yeasts.13 Furthermore the ability of the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, embedded within modified sol–gel silica layers, to continue producing the secondary metabolite astaxanthin has recently been reported.41
Porous silica materials impart a mechanical rigidity and a chemical stability which offers excellent protection to the biological components entrapped inside. Silica is also non-toxic and biologically inert;42,43 in fact some bacteria even create their own silica structures.44–46 Most importantly, silica is optically transparent allowing light energy to penetrate,47 and its porosity will allow the easy diffusion of compounds, crucial for the photosynthetic reaction and thus metabolism to continue. However, in order to make use of these benefits, the porous silica materials must be synthesised under mild conditions. Hence this work is dependent on the preparation of amorphous silica gels through the use of chimie douce. The viability of cyanobacteria entrapped within such matrices will rely on the reagents used in the preparation of these gels, as elaborated upon in the results and discussion below.
By the symbiosis of nature and the inanimate world, it has been envisaged that the immobilisation of cyanobacteria within porous silica gels could provide us with a versatile biocomposite material. Previous studies have focussed predominately on immobilising components of photosynthetic material such as photosynthetic pigments48 and light transducing proteins49 or even whole plant cells in silica materials.39 It has been foreseen that these smart biomaterials, capable of performing photosynthetic processes, could be employed in the design of efficient photobioreactors which can harness solar radiation and convert it into useful forms of energy such as biomass or even produce fine chemicals which are otherwise expensive to synthesise. These biomaterials would also possess a second advantage in that they fix carbon. As the photosynthetic reaction reduces carbon dioxide into various hydrocarbons, these silica hybrid materials could act as a carbon sink thereby absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere to help mitigate global warming. In spite of this there are problems with longevity and stability. The isolation of photosynthetic material from an organism comes at a price. Biological systems have evolved into highly organised multi-component structures which work efficiently in unison to perform complex processes with simple elegance. Unsurprisingly problems arise when one extracts part of the photosynthetic system. In isolation pigments such as chlorophyll are extremely photosensitive and thus the stability of in vitro photosynthetic material during encapsulation in a host structure is of great concern. This study however emphasises the potential of immobilising an entire living organism within a silica matrix thus removing the problems of stability of the photosensitive material as the unicellular cyanobacteria would be left intact prior to undergoing encapsulation.
Experimental

          Cyanobacteria cultivation
Axenic strains of Synechococcus sp. PCC‡ 6301, PCC‡ 7002 and PCC‡ 7418 were obtained from the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). The tolerance of each strain towards sodium varies; with PCC 6301 originating from fresh water, PCC 7002 from brackish/sea water and finally PCC 7418 was isolated from a hyper-saline lake.
The liquid stock cultures were maintained at ambient temperature under fluorescent strip lighting and transferred into fresh media on a monthly basis. No changes were made to the generic media used for cultivation as found on the Institut Pasteur website. PCC 6301 is grown in BG-11, PCC 7002 in 1 : 1 BG-11 : ASN-III with 1 μg dm−3 vitamin B12 and PCC 7418 in 1 : 1 ASN III : 4× Turks Islands Salts.

          Cyanobacteria immobilisation

Method A. 

Silica gels were synthesised using a method adapted from the literature.33,42 Colloidal silica, LUDOX HS-40 (Aldrich), and an aqueous solution of sodium silicate (assay 25.5–28.5%, 10× dilution, Merck) were added to culture tubes in equal volumes. Glycerol (pharmaceutical grade, Merck) was introduced into the mixture, prior to the addition of cyanobacteria, to prevent osmotic shock from the build up of sodium ions. One strain of cyanobacteria, either PCC 6301, PCC 7002 or PCC 7418, was added to the silicate precursor mix in a ratio of 1 : 1 by volume with respect to the sodium silicate solution. After the inoculation of cyanobacteria, the precursors were acidified to ca. pH 8 with HCl (3 M), then shaken and left to gel in the culture tubes. Gelation typically occurred within a few minutes at room temperature.


Method B. 
Immobilisations were also achieved by harvesting the cyanobacteria through centrifugation then re-suspending in glycerol and LUDOX prior to adding the sodium silicate solution and the HCl. This prevents further dilution of the pre-gel mixture by discarding the supernatant, i.e. the medium of the cyanobacteria culture. It also allows for an increase in the number of cells present within the gel as the volume of cyanobacteria centrifuged can be increased. Typically 5 cm3 of culture were centrifuged per cm3 of LUDOX.
3 mL of aqueous based medium, corresponding to the strain immobilised, was added on top of the gels, which penetrated the porous network providing nutrients to the immobilised cyanobacteria. The culture tubes were left to age under the same fluorescent lighting as the growing strains, with the lids left slightly open to prevent the build up of gases within the tube. Four blank gels were also made to analyse the effects of glycerol on the structural and textural properties of the gels. Water was added to some precursors to represent the volume contribution of the algae in media. The constituent parts and preparation details of all the gels can be found in Tables 1 and 2.

Characterisation techniques

Scanning electron microscopy was performed on a Philips XL 20 to obtain images of the cyanobacteria in liquid culture and of PCC 7002 immobilised within silica gel. Cover slips were immersed in 0.4 cm3 poly-(L-lysine) to create a film surface for the cyanobacteria to adhere to. 0.5 cm3 of cyanobacteria were added and then the cover slips were centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 rpm. The cyanobacteria were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol and subsequently subjected to critical point drying with liquid carbon dioxide before sputter coating with gold.
The autofluorescence of photosynthetic pigments within phototrophic organisms can be exploited with confocal microscopy to identify whether the cyanobacteria are still viable. A Leica TCS NT/SP1 was employed to obtain images of both free and immobilised cyanobacteria. The excitation wavelength was set at 488 nm, ensuring an intense fluorescent signal was emitted by the chlorophyll molecules in the red region of the visible spectrum. The region of detection was between 650–750 nm.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were performed at −196 °C using a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000. The samples were first dried at 60 °C to obtain a powder, ground and degassed at 60 °C overnight prior to undertaking the measurements.
Specific surface area was calculated using the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) equations50 and the porosity was characterised by the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method51 to determine the average pore diameter and the pore size distributions.
Solid state 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MASNMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer.

Fluorometry
spectra of free cyanobacteria, media, silica gels and hybrid gels were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS-45 Luminescence spectrometer over the range 400–725 nm with excitation at 375 nm.
Results and discussion
Cytotoxicity investigations
Following an aqueous pathway in targeting silica gel has prevented the release of cytotoxic alcohols which are formed during the hydrolysis of silicon alkoxides, commonly used as silicon precursors in earlier immobilisations.30,52,53 Prior to embarking on immobilisation experiments biocompatibility tests were carried out on possible reagents and intermediates. Using either TMOS or TEOS as starting precursors was immediately ruled out as the alcohol by-products formed would have been detrimental to the viability of the cyanobacteria. Addition of either MeOH or EtOH to each strain resulted in the sudden death of the cyanobacteria, with a visible colour change from green to yellow as a direct result of the denaturing of the photosynthetic pigments. Conversely, as each medium employed to cultivate the cyanobacteria contained varying amounts of sodium, the presence of sodium, from both the sodium silicate solution and from the stabiliser within the colloidal LUDOX, posed little problem with regards to osmotic stress.

Glycerol was added to protect the cyanobacteria during gelation as a previous study by Livage et al.33 detailed that better results were achieved with the incorporation of this additive in the immobilisation of E. coli. Using glycerol could minimise the number of cells that undergo membrane lysis which in turn could lead to total degradation. In fact cyanobacteria found in hyper-saline environments, such as strain PCC 7418, accumulate organic solutes such as glucosylglycerol, glycinebetaine and proline, in response to increased salinity. These act to maintain an osmotic balance and prevent the internal build up of toxic salts owing to the difference between intracellular and extracellular salt concentrations.54 In the formation of the silica gel sodium chloride is released which in turn alters the salt concentration surrounding the cyanobacteria. In order to prevent the net movement of water across the cell membrane towards the hyper-saline solution, the osmotic pressure of the cells must decrease which may cause the cells to burst. Work by Ben-Amotz and Avron found that increasing the concentration of NaCl in an external medium caused an increase in the production of internal glycerol in the halophilic alga Dunaliella parva.55 This may suggest that glycerol can aid osmoregulation and the maintenance of a suitable osmotic pressure within the cells yielding the immobilisation of a greater proportion of intact cells within the silica gel. So, in summary, whilst aliphatic alcohols such as MeOH and EtOH kill the cyanobacteria due to their ability to dissolve the phospholipids and fatty acids within the cell wall, more biocompatible alcohols like glycerol actually work to preserve the cell.
Preliminary experiments showed that without the addition of glycerol, the immobilisation of PCC 7418 was not possible. The inoculation of this cyanobacterium and its medium into the precursor mixture caused a destabilisation of the silica sol due to the elevated salinity of the medium and subsequently, immediate precipitation of the silica was observed.
The colloidal silica, LUDOX, is added to strengthen the resulting gels42 which would otherwise be fragile due to the necessity to dilute the sodium silicate to allow more time to carry out the procedure before gelation.
Structural characterisation
In order to analyse the true structural properties of the hybrid gels and to understand the effect of pore structure on the viability of cyanobacteria during the immobilisation, several blank gels were prepared without cyanobacteria. The presence of cyanobacteria within the voids alters the porosity characteristics of the gel owing to their cell size (μm scale) with respect to the size of the pores of a blank gel (nm scale).
The silica gels display mesoporosity confirmed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption data, see Fig. 1a and b. The datasets correspond to type IV isotherms under the IUPAC classification system, whereby a hysteresis loop is generated by capillary condensation processes within the mesopores.
 Fig. 1  (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of silica gels synthesised from sodium silicate and LUDOX HS-40 (compositions to be found in Table 1) where gels C and D are synthesised in the presence of glycerol. The upper image shows the pore size distribution curves, calculated using the BJH method, for all gels. (b) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of silica gels synthesised from sodium silicate and LUDOX HS-40 with cyanobacteria immobilised within the pores. The upper image shows the pore size distribution curves, calculated using the BJH method, for all gels. 
From the data given in Table 1, it can be seen that the addition of glycerol drastically reduces both the surface area and the pore volumes of the materials, whilst the pore diameters increase slightly. Glycerol may remain within the pore network even after degassing which would result in a lowering of the calculated surface area and pore volumes. Without glycerol, the gels remain green for weeks rather than months which suggests it slows the rate of degradation of the photosynthetic pigments within the cells. So in terms of preservation, glycerol may play an important role in prolonging the existence of live cyanobacteria within the gels. By reducing the amount of glycerol in the reaction, or adding the glycerol to the medium after gelation has occurred, the number of closed pores could be minimised and the overall porosity increased without forfeiting the benefits of glycerol entirely.
Datasets were also collected on gels which had cyanobacteria immobilised within the porous network, see Fig 1b, to obtain a general idea of structural changes to these gels. The silica gel forms around the cyanobacteriain situ, thus creating bigger voids within the gel itself not present in the blank samples. However, as the cyanobacteria would not survive the processing requirements (heat treatment at 60 °C) and the use of liquid nitrogen in data acquisition, there could be slight deviations from the true values. The cyanobacteria could disintegrate leaving an empty space which would contribute to the overall pore volume.
The cyanobacteria were harvested through centrifugation and the gels were synthesised with glycerol thus making them comparable to gel C. Increases in specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter can clearly be seen for every strain immobilised. This is as expected as the size of the cyanobacteria is far bigger than the pores. The cyanobacteria effectively act as a template around which the porous network is formed. Furthermore the immobilisation of the biggest strain, PCC 7418, results in the biggest pore volume thus suggesting that the size of the cyanobacteria is a significant factor in the increase in porosity.
These results are an approximation to the porosimetry of the gels as the measurements can only be collected on pre-dried powders using this method. In reality, the gels remain wet through immersion in aqueous media, needed to sustain the cyanobacteria. Evaporation of the water within the pores can lead to the formation of menisci which in turn can cause the gel network to crack. This cracking arises from unequal capillary pressures as a result of inhomogeneous pore radii, thereby altering the textural properties of the gel.
The 29Si MAS NMR spectra for the blank gels, see Fig. 2a, all possess a peak at −111 ppm, which is assigned to the Q4 peak for silica, thus highlighting the high proportion of quaternary SiO4 units within the gels. The shoulder of this peak at −101 ppm is the characteristic peak for SiO3(OH) units suggesting some Q3 units are also present within the gel. Finally, for gel D one can determine a peak at around −90 ppm, highlighting a negligible amount of SiO2(OH)2viz. Q2 units. For the other samples such a peak cannot be distinguished from the baseline. Thus, even though the gels remain wet a high proportion of the silicic acid formed in situ has undergone complete condensation. The datasets obtained on gels with cyanobacteria immobilised within the porous network mirror the results of the blank gels, see Fig. 2b, with each spectra clearly showing a major peak at −111 pm (Q4) and also a smaller one at −101 ppm (Q3), thus there is no alteration to the bonding within the silica network compared to the blank gels. In terms of immobilisation these results are very promising. It is beneficial to have the complete condensation of the silanol bonds to ensure that on aging there is no further contraction of the material or shearing strain, which would compress and further constrict the cells entrapped within the gel. Conversely the presence of terminal OH groups on the surface of the silica presents an aqueous-like environment which is advantageous to the viability of the cyanobacteria.

          Cyanobacteria characterisation

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to gain a better insight into the size and morphology of the cyanobacteria. The first SEM image, Fig. 3a, shows both unicellular PCC 6301 cyanobacteria and also some aggregates. It is assumed the large smooth particle is a crystal of one of the chemicals used in the fixing process. In contrast the aggregates in Fig. 3b (PCC 7002) arise from the centrifuging step in the fixing process. Some of the cyanobacteria can be seen adopting short filaments of 3 to 4 cells in length, whilst some are definitively unicellular. Fluctuations in temperature may account for the presence of both unicellular and filamentous chains.
 Fig. 3  
Scanning electron microscopy images of (a) free PCC 6301, (b) free PCC 7002, (c) free PCC 7418 and (d) PCC 7002 immobilised within porous silica gel. 
From Fig. 3c one sees conclusively that PCC 7418 is larger than the other two strains. Again the cyanobacteria are rod shaped. This particular strain has a rough surface in contrast to the others. The images highlight the presence of flagellae which appear to link cyanobacteria together, though this may just be coincidence. The other thing of note is the low population density in contrast to the other strains. This is consistent with the growth rate of this cyanobacterium. Compared to PCC 6301 and PCC 7002, these cyanobacteria are slow to cultivate.
The SEM results for the immobilised cyanobacteria were inconclusive and the necessity to dehydrate the cells in alcohol changed the nature of the gel as can be seen here in Fig. 3d. No cyanobacteria are visible due to the technical limit of the SEM; this technique is surface specific and does not probe the bulk of the sample.
In order to verify the viability of cyanobacteria immobilised within the silica gel, the fluorescence of the photosynthetic pigments was exploited. With conventional light microscopy, it was difficult to identify the cyanobacteria inside the silica gel thus confocal microscopy was employed to gain better information and imaging as it is able to eliminate out-of-focus information via the use of a pinhole, minimising background haze. This is especially useful for samples thicker than the focal plane. Moreover, the photosynthetic pigments within the cyanobacterium fluoresce and thus can be excited at particular wavelengths to help identify the structure.
As expected, the population density is higher in the free cyanobacteria than in the immobilised cyanobacteria as can be seen in images a(I)–c(I) in Fig. 4. All the images in Fig. 4a–c(II–IV), show that the cyanobacteria are successfully immobilised within silica gel, since the natural fluorescence from the cyanobacteria can easily be identified. Fig. 4a(III)–c(III), highlights how the immobilised cyanobacteria can survive for at least 2 weeks within the silica gel. If the cyanobacteria had died then the cellular material, namely the photosynthetic pigments, would no longer fluoresce.

During immobilisation, the concentration of cyanobacteria is diluted when the silica precursors are added. Thus in order to increase the concentration of cyanobacteria immobilised within the silica gel, each strain was centrifuged, the supernatant (media) decanted and the cyanobacteria re-suspended directly in a LUDOX and glycerol mix (method B). Gels formed in this way were analysed after one week (see image IV for each strain in Fig. 4). The images reveal the presence of more fluorescing cells thus validating the increase in concentration of cyanobacteria. With an augmented concentration of cyanobacteria a more productive biomaterial can be produced, which in theory should have a greater photosynthetic activity per gram of gel than an identical material that encapsulates less cells within the same volume.
There are also some other key features. Fig. 4b(I) is in agreement with the SEM data showing a high population count for the fast growing culture of PCC 7002. It also shows that in this strain, the daughter cells have a tendency to remain attached, resulting in the observation of two cells joined together in all of the immobilisation images. The SEM images also displayed longer filamentous chains.

Fig. 4c clearly shows that PCC 7418 is the largest of the three strains. The two week old gel also shows that parts of the cell do not fluoresce, resulting in a large black circle in the middle, thus suggesting the photosynthetic pigments have begun to decompose or that they simply are not found throughout the entire cell.

Fluorescence spectroscopy studies have yielded insight into the integrity of the photosynthetic structure of the cyanobacteria and thus their viability post-immobilisation to work as individual photobioreactors within their host gel.
The bands in the range of 600–700 nm are attributed to photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a56 which can be clearly identified in both the free cyanobacteria and the cyanobacteria immobilised in the silica gel, see Fig. 5. This suggests that the photosynthetic pigments are not destroyed during the immobilisation procedure and provides evidence of their survival after encapsulation. The media exhibit little fluorescence as the compounds within the media are not optically active in this region. The silica gel, run as a control, does not fluoresce between 600–700 nm, thus confirming these bands are indeed pigment bands. The broad intense band seen between 400–500 nm is also due to photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophyll a, zeaxanthin and β-carotene, which can be present in Synechococcus type algae. The spectra also show that there is a minor contribution from the silica at these wavelengths; hence it is better to focus on the bands at lower energy.

          Cyanobacteria immobilised within silica gel have been envisaged as potential photobioreactors for their ability to produce secondary metabolites, oxygen and even hydrogen through a photosynthetic pathway. In this way, natural photosynthetic processes of cyanobacteria can be exploited in pursuit of clean energy technologies, supplying Man with alternative energy and chemical resources for the twenty-first century.1
These preliminary results show the feasibility of entrapping cyanobacteria in porous silica gels. Normally silica gel is transparent; however when the cyanobacteria are encapsulated within the matrix, the gel takes on a green hue arising from the photosynthetic pigments contained within the individual cyanobacteria. This green hue gradually fades over time but in certain cases a faint green coloration remains ten weeks after immobilisation. Studies are currently in progress monitoring the viability of these immobilised cyanobacteria over time.
The preservation of the cyanobacteria relies on the gels being immersed in media for two reasons. Firstly it is necessary to provide the same inorganic nutrients required when cultivating in liquid medium and secondly to avoid the gels ageing. Contraction of the porous network could restrict the cyanobacteria further, placing them under increased stress. In turn, this could affect transport across the cell membrane and thus the physiological function of the cell. One aspect that needs to be considered is the concentrations of the nutrients added to the media as when neutralising sodium silicate (reaction 1), sodium chloride is liberated and in the polymerisation process (reaction 2), water is liberated, thus changing the concentrations of the media which are added after gelation, as seen in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Neutralisation and polycondensation reactions forming silica gel network. 
Owing to the confines of the silica materials, the cyanobacteria cannot divide and grow as they would in suspension, ca. every twelve hours, but remain within the voids that are created around them during polymerisation. Cells could be able to divide once, post-immobilisation; however the growth of these daughter cells would be extremely restricted. Hence it is likely only first and second generation cyanobacteria would be present in the gel; further studies are now required to look within the gels to get a more conclusive answer. Furthermore the cyanobacteria are physically trapped within the gels due to size limitations and cannot escape. The cyanobacteria strains used are between 1–5 μm in length whereas the mean diameters of the pores of the gel are on a nanometric scale and are subsequently much smaller. It has been suggested that the dispersion of bacteria in a silica gel support could facilitate the study of communication between bacteria, known as quorum sensing, as this depends on the population density and proximity to other cells.57
Conclusions
The present results show the real possibility of immobilising cyanobacteria within porous silica networks, with the vision of designing novel photobioreactors with important biotechnological applications.

NMR studies have shown how the gels underwent almost complete condensation, with the predominant silica species coming from SiO4 units within the gels. This highlights that further polymerisation would be minimal thus the pore volume should not contract much further. Any subsequent narrowing of the pores would be detrimental to the viability of the cells. The presence of SiO3(OH) species, albeit negligible in comparison to SiO4, arises from surface silanols. This confers an aqueous-like environment to the gels which facilitates both the survival of the cells and the percolation of the aqueous media into the porous network. The presence of media also helps to stop the aging process of the gels. Normally with the sol–gel process as the gel ages, the liquid phase of the gel evaporates. By immersing the gels in the media, evaporation and thus subsequent shrinkage arising from aging processes can be avoided which serves to prolong the life and activity of the cyanobacteria within the gel. Furthermore the presence of a porous network throughout the gel would allow the media to bring nutrients to the cells embedded deep within the material. Thus porous materials are critical to the immobilisation process.
The gels were homogeneous in colour suggesting the algae were evenly distributed throughout the bulk of the gel. In terms of survival, the immobilisation of PCC 6301 and PCC 7002 resulted in gels that remained green, hence confirming the presence of photosynthetic apparatus, for several months. This was not true for PCC 7418, the hyper-saline strain. Gels containing this strain rapidly lost colour over a fortnight. Work is currently being carried out to monitor their survival, such as the deterioration of photosynthetic pigments over time and the bioactivity of the gels, with the view to improving the efficiency of the hybrid material.
