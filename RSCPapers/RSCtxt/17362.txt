    , Accepted 19th May 2015First published on 21st May 2015AbstractA highly enhanced activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting was achieved by fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) and Co3O4 decorated hierarchical ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays via a facile stepwise synthesis strategy. The ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW composite exhibits an increased photocurrent density (1.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 2.7 times larger than that of the pristine ZnO NWs) and improved incident photon to current conversion efficiency (52.5% at 340 nm, 5.1 times higher than that of the pristine ZnO NWs) as a photoanode under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. This enhancement is attributed to the specific heterogeneous ternary architecture, which results in promoted electron–hole charge separation and transfer, decreased water oxidation overpotential as well as increased reaction rates of water splitting by decorating ZnO NWs with CNTs and Co3O4.
Introduction
Since steadily worsening environmental pollution and energy shortages have raised awareness of a potential global crisis, the development of both pollution-free technologies for environmental remediation and alternative clean energy supplies has become an urgent task in the past decade.1–5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting appears to be a promising way to capture and store solar energy as well as to produce renewable clean energy by simulating the natural photocatalysis process.6–9 Between the two half reactions of water splitting, water oxidation reactions possess a specific status. Because it is not only the half reaction of water splitting, but also the anodic reaction of liquid phase reduction of CO2, which would dominate the total activities. In this regard, it is still a challenging target to prepare photoanodes using cost-effective semiconductor materials with high energy conversion efficiency.
Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been studied extensively for over two decades because of their promising electronic, photonic, thermal, electrochemical and mechanical properties.10,11 It is possible to achieve a large-scale implementation of solar-to-fuel energy conversion by taking advantage of nanowire materials, such as large surface area, reduced electrochemical overpotential, enhanced light absorption and improved charge collection. In particular, ZnO nanowires with tunable alignment and morphology have been attracting a great deal of attention due to their prospective electronic and optical properties. Additionally, the typical electron mobility in ZnO is 10–100 times higher than that in TiO2, so the electrical resistance is much lower and the electron-transfer efficiency is higher than that of TiO2.12–18 Despite the great efforts that have been reported for the synthesis and application of ZnO NW arrays, there are still some drawbacks accompanied by ZnO photocatalysts, such as the photocorrosion induced by photogenerated holes and the slow interfacial kinetics for water splitting.19–21 Thus, it is highly desirable to improve the photogenerated charge separation and accelerate the reaction rates of water oxidation. The integration of photo-absorbing substrates with effective charge conductor materials appears to be a favorable way to overcome these disadvantages and enhance the efficiency of PEC water splitting. A hierarchical nanostructure would benefit the PEC water splitting by reducing the external power consumption, depressing the photogenerated charge recombination and facilitating the interface charge transfer.22–26 The use of Co3O4 results in efficient O2 evolution and long durability against chemical- and photo-corrosion, and it has been widely employed as a low cost catalyst or cocatalyst for robust water oxidation in electrochemical and PEC water splitting.27–31 Besides, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electrical and optical properties that make them an ideal candidate for charge separation, transport, and collection in photovoltaics due to their conspicuous merits in improving the photoconversion efficiency.32–34
Herein, we report a facile design and fabrication of hierarchical nanowire arrays based on CNTs and Co3O4 decorated ZnO via a stepwise preparation process including chemical soaking and electrosynthesis methods. Different amounts of CNTs and Co3O4 have been loaded on the ZnO NWs array substrate by finely controlling the concentration of CNT aqueous solutions as well as the electrodeposition time inside the cobalt precursor electrolyte. The ternary nanostructured CNT–ZnO–CO3O4 NW arrays demonstrated obviously enhanced PEC water splitting performance, i.e. enhanced photocurrent density (1.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and stability, compared with the binary CNT–ZnO, Co3O4–ZnO NW and the pristine ZnO NW arrays. This is attributed to the successful charge separation within the hierarchical nanostructures, increased total conductivity induced by the loaded CNTs and the excellent water oxidation behavior of decorated Co3O4 as cocatalysts. By introducing CNTs into the ZnO NW arrays to fabricate the interlaced structure and increase the total conductivity, the electron–hole separation from ZnO to CNTs has been highly strengthened. Meanwhile, by integration of efficient holes transferred from ZnO to Co3O4, a superior PEC water splitting performance was achieved. This work provides a method for simple fabrication of hierarchical CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays as efficient photoanode materials to improve the PEC water splitting performance by facilitating the photogenerated charge separation and transfer efficiency.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process of ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW array composites on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, a layer of ZnO seeds was distributed on the FTO substrate. The ZnO NWs were prepared via a hydrothermal process by referring the method reported in the literature.15 Then, the obtained ZnO NWs were soaked in CNT aqueous solution to form the interlaced structure with ZnO NWs. The CNT powders were treated with a 3:1 H2SO4/HNO3 mixture for functionalization and better dispersion in water before use.35 The as-prepared CNT–ZnO NWs were decorated with cobalt precursors via an electrosynthesis route and subsequently annealed in air. Finally, the ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NWs arrays were obtained.

The crystal structures and microstructures of the prepared ZnO NWs were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 2. The ZnO NWs were vertically aligned on the FTO substrate with an average diameter of ∼90 nm. The length of the ZnO NWs is about 2 μm as in the cross-sectional view shown in the inset of Fig. 2C. Fig. 2D exhibits the XRD patterns of the FTO substrate and ZnO/FTO, respectively. The main peak at the 2θ value of 35.1° can be indexed to the (002) crystal phase, which confirms the preferential anisotropic growth along the [001] direction of FTO. This anisotropic growth is further identified using the HRTEM image in Fig. 2B. The microscopic morphologies of ZnO NWs prepared under different hydrothermal synthesis conditions are shown in Fig. S1.† Different concentrations of CNT aqueous solution were adopted for integrating with ZnO NWs in order to optimize the amount of CNTs. The SEM images (Fig. S2†) finely confirm that ZnO NWs and CNTs interlaced with one another. Time-dependent experiments were carried out to study the formation process of Co3O4 on the hierarchical NW arrays. Fig. 3 exhibits the SEM images of the ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW arrays with different electrosynthesis times. When the deposition time was 10 s, only a small amount of subunits of Co3O4 nanoflakes were loaded on the surface of ZnO NWs (Fig. 3A and B). As the electrodeposition time was prolonged gradually, the Co3O4 nanoflakes grew bigger and denser (30 s: Fig. 3C and D; 50 s: Fig. 3E and F). After the electrosynthesis duration is extended to 70 s, the ZnO NWs are fully wrapped with the Co3O4 nanoflakes (Fig. S3†). In particular, the nanostructure has changed into core–shell nanoarrays. UV-vis absorption spectra of the ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW arrays with various electrodeposition durations are shown in Fig. S4.† The spectra exhibit similar absorption properties with intense absorption edges. With the deposition time increasing, some absorption peaks appear in the visible light region due to the visible light response of Co3O4.36

The detailed microscopic morphology and nanostructural information of the ternary CNT–ZnO–CO3O4 NW arrays were further investigated by HRTEM, EDX and XPS as shown in Fig. 4. The TEM image shows the specific nanoflake-like Co3O4 decorated ZnO NWs morphology (Fig. 4A), which is in good accordance with the SEM results. ZnO NWs and Co3O4 nanoflakes can be clearly distinguished in the HRTEM image (Fig. 4B), and it also indicates a finely contacted interface. The corresponding EDX mapping analysis (Fig. 4C) confirms that zinc is located in the central part of the NWs while cobalt is homogeneously distributed around the NWs. In order to confirm the phase state of cobalt oxide, the ternary NW array sample is characterized by XPS analysis (Fig. 4D). The Co 2p XPS spectra show two major peaks with binding energy values at 795.1 and 780.1 eV, corresponding to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 spin–orbit peaks of the Co3O4 phase, respectively. The Co 2p peaks can be decomposed to Co3+ and Co2+ oxidation states, with Co3+ presenting a more dominant state. The weak satellite structure is ascribed to a shake-up related to the Co2+ component of the structure.37 It is clearly detected in the spectrum that a satellite peak at 790.3 eV is about 9 eV higher than the position of the main peak of Co 2p3/2. This is associated with the typical assignment of cobalt oxidation states in Co3O4.38 Thus, it can be deduced that the electrodeposited cobalt precursors have successfully been converted into Co3O4 after annealing in air.

The photoelectrocatalytic performances of the pristine ZnO NWs, binary CNT–ZnO NWs, Co3O4–ZnO NWs and the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays as photoanodes were investigated in PEC water splitting under AM 1.5G light. All the current–voltage results were recorded in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) aqueous solution in the potential region from −0.2 V to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The pristine ZnO NWs were synthesized in various concentrations of zinc nitrite solutions during the hydrothermal process to optimize the preparation conditions of ZnO NWs. The corresponding photocurrent densities are shown in Fig. S5.† The best PEC performance was observed for the ZnO NWs prepared in 0.06 M zinc nitrite aqueous solution, where the current density exceeded 0.7 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V (approximate to 1.23 V vs. RHE). It is mainly attributed to the better growth of crystal and the space alignment in this 0.06 M zinc nitrite solution. Thus, the ZnO NWs used in the following study are all synthesized under these conditions. The PEC performances of the binary CNT–ZnO NWs synthesized indifferent concentrations of CNT aqueous solutions are shown in Fig. S6.† The samples prepared in 0.25 mg mL−1 and 0.50 mg mL−1 CNT aqueous solutions show an obvious enhancement of photocurrent densities, especially in the potential region of 0.0 V to 0.6 V. It can be deduced that the CNTs interlaced with the ZnO NWs increase the total conductivity of the binary CNT–ZnO NW arrays. However, with the concentration of CNT aqueous solution increased to 1.00 mg mL−1, the photocurrent density decreases dramatically. This is mainly because of the fact that too many CNTs loaded on the ZnO NWs block the light as shown in Fig. S2G and S2F.† As the sample prepared in 0.25 mg mL−1 CNT aqueous solution exhibited the best PEC performance, this 0.25 mg mL−1 CNT aqueous solution was adopted for the following synthesis of the ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW arrays. The binary Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW arrays were also synthesized as contrast samples. Their morphology exhibits the same growth tendency as the ternary NW arrays. By increasing the deposition time of the cobalt precursor, the Co3O4 nanoflakes grow more densely as shown in Fig. S7.† The corresponding PEC performances are shown in Fig. S8.† The photocurrent densities show a pronounced enhancement compared with the pristine ZnO NWs. Co3O4–ZnO (30 s) exhibits the best activity, where the current density increases to ca. 1.3 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V under illumination.
The hierarchical CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 nanoarrays were subsequently investigated as photoanodes, which exhibit promising photoelectrocatalytic activities for PEC water splitting as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5A shows the comparison between the pristine ZnO NWs, binary CNT–ZnO NWs and Co3O4–ZnO NWs. Both the dark and light current densities enhanced remarkably and the photocurrent density of CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 nanoarrays increased significantly in the potential region from −0.2 V to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photoelectric response of CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 nanoarray photoanode starts at a more negative onset potential, and the photocurrent density roaringly increases to 1.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V under illumination. It is about 2.7 times larger than that of pristine ZnO NWs as well as 1.9 times and 1.5 times larger than the binary CNT–ZnO NWs and Co3O4–ZnO NWs at 0.6 V, respectively. These results indicate that the PEC performance for water splitting was definitely enhanced by decorating the ZnO NWs with CNTs and Co3O4 to form the hierarchical nanostructure. Additionally, the cathodic shift of the onset potential suggests decreased charge recombination and a reduced overpotential in the ternary nanoarray photoanode.9,19

In order to further investigate the effect of the Co3O4 decorated on the CNT–ZnO NWs, the photocurrent densities of the ternary composites with various cobalt precursor deposition times were determined during repeated ON–OFF illumination cycles. As shown in Fig. 5B, a steady and prompt photoresponse can be observed. The measured photocurrents are greatly affected by the loading amount of Co3O4. The ternary nanoarray photoanode reaches the maximum activity when the cobalt precursor deposition time is 30 s. With the deposition time exceeding this suitable level, the photocurrent decreases significantly. A dense wrapping up of the Co3O4 nanoflakes seems to have hindered the light absorption. Moreover, the densely loaded Co3O4 resulted in more contact of Co3O4 with CNTs, which increased the recombination between the electrons in CNTs and the holes in Co3O4, so that the charge transfer efficiency within the composite decreased obviously. Thus, the loading of Co3O4 should be controlled to an optimal amount, not only to fully realize its ability as a cocatalyst for water oxidation but also to avoid its contact with CNTs as well as the corresponding charge recombination. The transient photocurrents of the samples were examined during the light ON–OFF cycling at 0.6 V as shown in Fig. 5C. All of the samples exhibit prompt and reproducible photocurrent responses upon each illumination. It further confirms that the photogenerated charges have promptly transferred from ZnO NWs to the loaded CNTs and Co3O4. Thus, this ternary hierarchical nanostructure effectively enhances the optical pathway and assists the charge separation. When comparing the photocurrent density of our photoanode with those of the commonly reported ZnO,19,39–42 TiO2,43–46 Fe2O3,47–49 WO3 (ref. 50 and 51) based photoelectrodes in the literature (usually around 1 mA cm−2 at ∼1.2 V vs. RHE), the results of this work exhibit a superior PEC activity. This can be attributed to the facilitated charge transfer and increased water splitting reaction rates by the formation of ternary CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO NW array composite nanostructures.
The Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was evaluated at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the pristine ZnO NWs, binary CNT–ZnO NWs, Co3O4–ZnO NWs and the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays, in order to understand the interplay between the photoactivity and light absorption as shown in Fig. 5D. IPCE can be expressed as IPCE = 1240 jp(λ)/λEλ(λ), where jp(λ) is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the incident light wavelength (nm) and Eλ(λ) is the incident monochromatic light power density (mW cm−2) at a specific wavelength. The photocurrent responses of the binary and ternary NW arrays exhibit almost the same features as the absorption spectrum of pristine ZnO NWs, suggesting that the observed photocurrent is mainly based on the band gap transition of ZnO. The ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays exhibit a significant enhancement of photoactivity. It shows the highest IPCE value of 52.5% at 340 nm, which is 5.1 times higher than that of the pristine ZnO NWs as well as 2.1 times and 1.4 times higher than those of the binary CNT–ZnO NWs and Co3O4–ZnO NWs, respectively.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to further confirm the advantage of the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NWs in improving the charge transfer (Fig. S9†). A smaller size of the semicircular arc diameter indicates a more effective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pair and a faster interfacial charge transfer to the electron donor–acceptor.52,53 The charge separation and transfer abilities are in the order of CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NWs > CNT–ZnO NWs > Co3O4–ZnO NWs > ZnO NWs. Both the decorated CNTs and Co3O4 have exhibited an effective ability to improve the charge transfer. Although using oxygen-containing groups to functionalize CNTs would reduce the length and conductivity of the CNTs,54,55 the charge transfer resistance has been effectively reduced by loading CNTs on ZnO NWs. Fig. 6 illustrates a supposed schematic model of the charge transfer pathway in the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays under illumination. CNTs facilitate the charge separation and transfer by increasing the conductivity of the nanoarrays in a macroscopic aspect. From a microscopic point of view, since not each ZnO nanowire possesses the same conductivity, only the high-conductivity nanowire could timely transfer the photogenerated electron to the FTO substrate before recombination. After interlacing the ZnO NWs with CNTs, the CNTs bridge the low-conductivity nanowire, the high-conductivity nanowire and the FTO substrate together. Thus, the electron generated in the low-conductivity nanowire could also be timely transferred to the FTO substrate through CNTs and the high-conductivity nanowire immediately under bias. On the other hand, Co3O4, as an effective water oxidation cocatalyst,27,28,56 could further promote the charge separation and transfer from ZnO to Co3O4. Thus the recombination of photogenerated hole–electron pairs has been decreased. Moreover, the chemical stability of CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NWs has also been improved due to the promoted hole transfer from ZnO to Co3O4, which can prevent ZnO from photo-corrosion. As shown in Fig. S10,† the photocurrent response is almost identical over 30 cycles. In addition, Co3O4 is also an effective material for decreasing the water oxidation overpotential and increasing the reaction rates of water splitting. It is usually associated with the mechanism involving the electrochemical steps of Co(II) → Co(III) and Co(III) → Co(IV).56,57 Therefore, accounting for the synergistic cooperation of CNTs and Co3O4 in charge separation, the hierarchical construction of ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW array composites demonstrates an efficient way for water splitting as a photoanode.

Conclusions
In summary, hierarchically CNT and Co3O4 decorated ZnO nanowire arrays with ternary heteroassembled nanostructures have been successfully fabricated via a facile stepwise synthesis process. In detail, CNTs were interlaced with ZnO NWs to improve the conductivity and Co3O4 was loaded on ZnO as a water oxidation cocatalyst. ZnO NWs serve as the main photosensitizer while CNTs could act as cocatalysts to further promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons, meanwhile Co3O4 could synergistically transfer the holes from ZnO. Therefore, the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays exhibit a significantly enhanced activity in PEC water splitting compared with the pristine ZnO NWs, binary CNT–ZnO NWs and Co3O4–ZnO NWs as photoanodes under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. This can be attributed to the effectively improved photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the markedly accelerated water splitting reaction rates due to the specific ternary architecture. In addition, this facile hierarchical synthesis strategy could be extended to the fabrication of other semiconductor heterogeneous assemblies to achieve sustainable and affordable solar energy conversion.
Experimental
Preparation

(I) Fabrication of ZnO NWs. 
ZnO NWs were prepared by a facile hydrothermal synthesis process by referring to the previous report.15 Briefly, 100 mL of a 0.06 M solution of zinc acetate in absolute ethanol was prepared by ultrasonic agitation as seed solution. The seed solution was spin-coated onto the pre-treated FTO substrate, and then annealed at 350 °C for 30 min to yield a layer of ZnO seeds. The seeded substrates were suspended vertically in a Teflon vessel, and then sealed in an autoclave and heated to 110 °C for 24 h for nanowire growth. The concentration of the reagent solution varies from 0.04 M to 0.07 M zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) aqueous solution to optimize the preparation conditions. Finally, the nanowire substrate was removed from the autoclave, washed thoroughly with distilled water, dried in air and annealed at 300 °C for 3 h in air.


(II) Fabrication of CNT–ZnO NWs. 
The binary CNT–ZnO NWs were obtained by soaking the as-prepared ZnO NWs in CNT aqueous solution (concentration of 0.25 mg mL−1, 0.50 mg mL−1 and 1.00 mg mL−1). The CNT powders (multi-walled, 40–70 nm, Wako) were treated with a 3:1 H2SO4/HNO3 mixture for functionalization and better dispersion in water before use.35 The ZnO/FTO substrates were immersed in the CNT aqueous solution for 30 s, dried in air and annealed at 300 °C for 3 h in air.


(III) Fabrication of CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NWs. 
The as-obtained CNTs–ZnO/FTO substrates were subsequently used as the working electrode and placed in an electrochemical cell which was assembled with a three-electrode configuration, by using platinum as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The electrodeposition of cobalt precursors was carried out by galvanostatic deposition at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 in 0.15 M Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution. Finally, the resulting nanowire arrays were withdrawn, rinsed with distilled water and annealed at 300 °C for 3 h in air. Co3O4–ZnO NWs were synthesized in the same way without decorating the CNTs.

Characterization
The crystal structure of ZnO NWs was determined with an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Powder, PANalytical B.V., Netherlands) with Cu-Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy images were recorded with a HITACHI S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy images were recorded with a field emission transmission electron microscope (2100F, JEOL Co., Japan) operating at 200 kV, combined with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) for the determination of metal composition. The diffuse reflection spectra were measured with an integrating sphere equipped UV-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu Co., Japan) using BaSO4 as the reference and the optical absorptions were converted from the reflection spectra according to the Kubelka–Munk equation. Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed in a type Theta probe (Thermo Fisher Co., USA) using monochromatized Al Kα at hν = 1486.6 eV and the peak positions were internally referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.
Photoelectrochemical experiments
The PEC activity measurements were performed with a CHI electrochemical analyser (ALS/CH model 650A) using a standard three-electrode mode with 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) solution as the electrolyte using Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and a Pt sheet as the counter electrode. The pristine ZnO NW, binary CNT–ZnO NW, Co3O4–ZnO NW and the ternary CNT–ZnO–Co3O4 NW arrays were fabricated respectively as photoanodes. The simulated sunlight was obtained using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (WXS-80C-3 AM 1.5G) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a voltage scan speed of 10 mV s−1 and the light was chopped manually at regular intervals. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated from chronoamperometry measurements using a motorized monochromator (M10; Jasco Corp.). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under similar conditions as described above for the photoelectrochemical tests. The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was 5 mV and the frequency range examined was 100 kHz to 1 Hz.
