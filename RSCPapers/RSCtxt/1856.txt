    , Accepted 12th April 2021First published on 14th April 2021AbstractEfficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) play a crucial role in electrochemical water splitting, which is one of the most promising approaches for alleviating the problem of the energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, it is still challenging to develop highly efficient, stable and platinum-free HER electrocatalysts. Herein, a sulfur-doped ruthenium (Ru–S) catalyst via a one-step solvothermal synthesis procedure is presented. Remarkably, the as-prepared Ru–S-2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of only 10 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is better than that of Pt (25 mV), and much more superior than those of the commercially available Ru (105 mV) and commercially available 20% Pt/C catalyst (43 mV) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. In addition, the Ru–S-2/C catalyst with a low ruthenium content only requires 40 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the Ru–S-2 catalyst shows a smaller Tafel slope, a larger exchange current density and a better durability than the reference materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the appropriate adsorption and dissociation energies of the water molecules on the Ru–S surface could be responsible for the excellent electrocatalytic performances observed.
Introduction
Hydrogen has been widely considered as a promising alternative energy source because of it is light-weight, has a high energy density, produces carbon-free emissions and is non-toxic.1–3 Global demand for pure hydrogen is growing quickly and about 70 Mt per year of dedicated hydrogen is produced today, with 76% from natural gas and almost all the rest from coal. As a consequence, this is responsible for 830 Mt of CO2 per year and particulates or sulfur oxides, which significantly pollute the ecological environment.4 Notably, these emissions can be avoided by using water electrocatalysis to produce hydrogen powered by surplus clean electricity, which is supplied using renewable energy such as solar and wind.
Nevertheless, electrochemical water splitting consists of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which greatly depend on potent catalysts to meet the demands of a low energy consumption and low cost.2,5 Catalyzing the conversion of H2O in alkaline media usually involves three steps: H2O + e− + * → H* + OH− (Volmer reaction)(1) H2O + e− + H* → H2 + * + OH− (Heyrovsky reaction)(2) 2H* → H2 (Tafel reaction)(3)
Although Pt-based catalysts have a high efficiency for the HER in acidic media, the results are relatively disappointing under alkaline conditions, and OER catalysts composed of oxides maintain a high efficiency in alkaline media.6,7 Furthermore, the high cost of proton exchange membranes and noble metal Pt impede their large-scale applications.8,9 In addition, under alkaline conditions, Pt-based catalysts possess orders of magnitude lower HER electron-transfer kinetics than those under acidic conditions.7,9,10 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop excellent catalysts for the HER in non-acidic media to fulfill perfect overall water splitting.
Recently, non-platinum noble metals, such as ruthenium,11 rhodium,12,13 iridium,14,15 and palladium,16,17 have been developed for the HER owing to their remarkable performance. Ru as the cheapest platinum-group metal and only 1/25 price of Pt, exhibits splendid activities for alkaline HER by employing different strategies to facilitate water dissociation, such as Ru–N–C,9 Ru/CQDs,11 Ru/C3N4/C,18 RuAu,19 RuSi,20 Ru@GnP,21 Ru@C2N,22 and RuP2@NPC.23 These catalysts show an improved HER performance by promoting water dissociation because this step is sluggish in alkaline media. Recent reports about state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts including Ni-BDT-A,24 CoMoSx,25 and Pt3Ni/NiS,26 have demonstrated that the introduction of sulfur markedly boosts the alkaline HER activity, which is ascribed to the formation of Sadδ−-hydrated cation (K+(H2O)x) networks in the double layer through Coulomb interactions between the surface anionic sulfur species and the hydrated cation, which could promote the dissociation of water to enhance the generation of an adsorbed hydrogen intermediate.25,27
Herein, we report a novel Ru-based nanocatalyst with chalcogen doping (Ru–X, X = S, Se, Te) to boost the performance of Ru in alkaline conditions using ruthenium trichloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O) and thioacetamide as a Ru and S precursor, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent. It is worth noting that DMF is not only a versatile solvent, but also a mild reducing agent for the preparation of silver, gold, and platinum nanoparticles.28–30 Therefore, neat DMF was used to fabricate a series of S-doped ruthenium catalysts in this study via solvothermal treatment, and this is a facile, one-step synthetic method without high-temperature calcination. Notably, the as-prepared S-doped ruthenium catalysts show a superior activity towards pure metal Pt and a three-fold higher activity than that of the commercially available 20% Pt/C in alkaline media, as well as an excellent stability. In addition, a remarkable HER activity can be obtained in acidic media as well. This finding suggests that the S-doped ruthenium catalyst is a potential candidate for HER applications in the water splitting process.
Results and discussion
The preparation of the S-doped ruthenium (Ru–S) catalysts was carried out using a facile solvothermal treatment (see Scheme S1†). The crystalline structures and phase purity of the as-prepared samples were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as shown in Fig. 1a and S1.† All diffraction peaks can be readily ascribed to the hexagonal phase of the metastable metallic Ru (JCPDS No. 89-4903). Furthermore, there were no excess diffraction peaks, indicating that the synthesized samples have a high purity crystalline phase and the sulfur was well doped into the lattice of ruthenium.31 In addition, we can conclude that the appropriate introduction of sulfur can improve the degree of crystallization of the as-prepared catalysts by comparing the S-doped samples with the Ru–S-0 sample. The morphologies of the obtained series of samples were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are shown in Fig. S2.† Interestingly, there is proof that the particle size of the catalysts decreases dramatically with the increase in sulfur doping, which was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Fig. 1b and S3†). It seems to be a rule that the particle size becomes smaller with the increasing doping of sulfur. The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1c) showed that the lattice fringes of the Ru–S-2 sample displayed expected interplanar spacings of 0.214 nm, which matched well with the (002) planes of the hexagonal Ru phase. The (102), (201), and (103) crystal facets, which were found in the XRD spectra, were confirmed using the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1d). The particle size distribution of the as-prepared Ru–S-2 catalyst obtained from the HRTEM is shown in Fig. S4,† and the average diameter is ≈8.3 nm. Atomic-resolution high-angle (HAADF-STEM) EDX line scan (Fig. 1e and f) and elemental mapping (Fig. 1g) revealed uniform spatial distributions of Ru, S, and O over the marked detection range of the constructed hybrid material. The EDS spectrum disclosed that the Ru content in the Ru–S-2 catalyst is ≈96.5 wt% (Fig. S5†), while the results of the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) analysis under air conditions showed that the total Ru weight content is 95.8 wt% (Fig. S6a†). This demonstrated that Ru–S-2 is mainly composed of ruthenium nanocrystals with a small number of hetero-atoms (sulfur) that are doped into the lattice to some extent. Furthermore, the Ru content in Ru–S-2/C is only 29.1 wt% (Fig. S6b†), as determined from TGA.

(g) HAADF-STEM image of the Ru–S-2 sample and the corresponding elemental mapping images of Ru, S, O. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the elemental composition and chemical states of the obtained samples. Fig. 2a clearly shows that the as-prepared Ru–S-2 catalyst consists of Ru, S and O elements. The high-resolution XPS Ru 3d spectrum (Fig. 2b), can be deconvoluted into two doublets, the first doublet (280.5 eV and 284.7 eV) is assigned to Ru0 3d5/2 and Ru0 3d3/2, and the other doublet (281.2 eV and 285.5 eV) is attributed to Ru4+ 3d5/2 and Ru4+ 3d3/2, respectively. The results suggest that the metallic Ru and +4 oxidation state Ru species co-exist in the Ru–S-2 sample. This conclusion was further demonstrated by the deconvolution spectra of Ru0 and Ru4+ 3p (see Fig. S7a†), which manifests the position of the splitting peaks at 462.8 eV (3p3/2 of Ru0) and 464.6 eV (3p3/2 of Ru4+), the rest of the components come from the Ru 3p1/2 photoelectrons.32,33 The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 2c) displayed a series of peaks at 162.4, 163.5, 163.9 and 165.0 eV, which can be ascribed to S2− 2p3/2, S2− 2p1/2, S22− 2p3/2 and S22− 2p1/2 in the sulfides, respectively, and the existence of S22− implies that part of the sulfur formed the sulfur bridge.34 Meanwhile, an obvious broad peak at around 170 eV was observed, indicating an SOx species on the catalyst surface, and it is most likely produced upon exposure of the catalyst to air.35,36 Thus, S may form compounds with Ru, modifying the electronic structure of the metallic Ru. Moreover, it is a typical function of sulfur to tend to form more active Ru–S dangling bonds to strengthen the OH−/H2O adsorption for HER activity, thereby facilitating the HER.37 In addition, the catalysts with different sulfur contents can be easily seen in Fig. S7b,† and the optimal sample Ru–S-2 possessed the highest sulfur content. In the high-resolution XPS O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2d), the four peaks at 530.6, 531.5, 532.2 and 533.5 eV are identified as Ru–O, S–O, CO and H2O, respectively.22,38 The existence of CO could be due to the solvothermal system residue, while H2O results from the surface adsorption of the catalyst.

The electrochemical HER performances of the sulfur-doped Ru catalysts with different S contents (labeled as Ru–S-0–Ru–S-3) were evaluated in N2-saturated alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH) without iR-correction. As shown in Fig. 3a, the optimal Ru–S-2 catalyst has the lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (donated as η10) among the series of samples, and the overpotential values follow the order: Ru–S-0 (114 mV) > Ru–S-3 (50 mV) > Ru–S-1 (45 mV) > Ru–S-2 (10 mV). The obtained Ru–S-0 sample without S doping exhibits the highest overpotential, while the S-doped sample of Ru–S-2 shows the lowest overpotential among the tested samples, thus demonstrating the significant effect of sulfur doping on the HER activity. Commercially available Ru powder, 20% Pt/C catalyst, synthesized Ru–S-2/C and pure metal Pt were also measured for comparison under identical conditions. From Fig. 3b, it can be clearly seen that the overpotential of the optimal Ru–S-2 catalyst is lower than Pt (25 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, while it was 105 mV for the Ru powder. In order to decrease the content of Ru in the as-prepared catalysts, carbon black was introduced as the base. It is worth noting that the Ru–S-2/C (40 mV) catalyst, with a lower Ru content, also has an excellent electrochemical performance comparable to the commercially available 20% Pt/C (43 mV). In addition, the value of η10 of Ru–S-2 catalyst was the lowest among the reported alkaline HER catalysts (see Table S1†). Furthermore, when the operating current density was increased to 100 mA cm−2, the difference in the overpotential between the Ru–S-2 and Pt/C catalyst soared to 96 mV, revealing outstanding electrocatalytic activities at a high current density. Nevertheless, the overpotential of the Ru–S-0 catalyst, without sulfur doping at 10 mA cm−2, was 114 mV, significantly inferior to all S-doped samples in this investigation, clearly demonstrating that the introduction of sulfur can boost the electrocatalytic activities prominently in an alkaline solution. The Tafel slope, one of the most important parameters, should be taken into consideration if the catalysts are applied practically. As seen from Fig. 3c, the Ru–S-2 sample possessed the lowest Tafel slope of 53 mV dec−1 among all of the tested catalysts, and the Tafel slopes were 122 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-0, 73 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-1, 75 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-3, 66 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-2/C, and 56 mV dec−1 for Pt and 103 mV dec−1 for Ru powder, revealing that Ru–S-2 exhibits superior HER kinetics.11,39 Meanwhile, the value of the Tafel slope suggests that the Ru–S-2 samples follow the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism for the hydrogen evolution route in alkaline media.21,40,41

In addition, we carried out a detailed evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the S-doped ruthenium catalysts under acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4). Interestingly, the electrochemicalactivity shows a similar trend to the results obtained for alkaline electrolytes. As displayed in Fig. S8,† Ru–S-2 exhibits a slightly higher overpotential of 54 mV compared to that of 20% Pt/C (37 mV), nevertheless, this was only a quarter of that obtained using the commercially available Ru powder (204 mV). In addition, it only took 95 mV for the Ru–S-2/C catalyst with a low-noble metal content to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2, exhibiting an excellent activity in acidic media. The overpotential value of Ru–S-2 was also the lowest among the catalysts included in the recent reports listed in Table S2.† Meanwhile the Tafel slope was 117 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-0, 93 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-1, 72 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-2, 91 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-3, 110 mV dec−1 for Ru–S-2/C, 35 mV dec−1 for Pt/C and 134 mV dec−1 for commercially available Ru powder, respectively. The large difference in the Tafel slope between the Ru-based catalyst and Pt/C in this study could be ascribed to the different reaction pathways, in that Pt/C follows a Volmer–Tafel mechanism while Ru–S-2 follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky path.42–45 Moreover, our Ru–S-2 catalyst exhibits quite an apparent electrocatalytic activity for HER under neutral conditions (Fig. S9†), and only a small overpotential of 71 mV is required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen production. Both of these show great tolerance for Ru–S-2 in different pH solutions during the electrolysis process.
By extrapolating the Tafel plots to intersect the x-axis, the exchange current density (j0) was obtained. The corresponding η0 and j0 for each catalyst are listed using the histogram (Fig. 3d), and the exchange current density follows the trend: Ru powder (0.09 mA cm−2) < Ru–S-0 (2.03 mA cm−2) < Ru–S-3 (2.16 mA cm−2) < Ru–S-1 (2.67 mA cm−2) < Ru–S-2/C (2.96 mA cm−2) < Pt/C (3.76 mA cm−2) < Ru–S-2 (6.65 mA cm−2). It is worth noting that the value of j0 for Ru–S-2 is about 2 and 73 times higher than that of the Pt and Ru powders, respectively, indicating the favorable intrinsic electrochemical activity of the Ru–S-2 catalyst, including the fast electron transfer rate, HER kinetics, and the large active surface area, to which j0 is proportional,46 this is consistent with the results of the following electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) measurements.
To gain a better understanding of the enhancement mechanism, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the samples was performed. The ECSA values of the studied materials were estimated using the cyclic voltammetry curve within a voltage window of 0.25 to 0.35 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) was used to evaluate the ECSA, as they are proportional (Fig. 3e and Table S3†). As displayed in Fig. S10,† Ru–S-2 possessed the highest value of Cdl (37.41 mF cm−2) and ESCA (197 cm2) among all of the tested catalysts, suggesting that sulfur doping indeed enhances the active surface areas. EIS measurements were performed at −100 mV (vs. RHE) in alkaline media. As seen from Fig. 3f, Nyquist plots show that all samples display a quasi-semicircle, in which the diameter represents the corresponding charge-transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct value of Ru–S-2 (6.4 Ω) is the lowest among the measured catalysts, and the commercially available Pt/C and Ru powders possess values of 10.9 and 40.4 Ω, respectively, in good agreement with the results of the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and exchange current density. It was observed that sulfur doping boosts the HER by improving the interfacial electronic transfer kinetics and charge transfer capacity.
The operational stability of the Ru–S-2 and Pt/C catalysts was evaluated using long-term cycles and chronopotentiometric (CP) tests in 1.0 M KOH solution. From Fig. 4a, it can be seen that the η10 value of Ru–S-2 only increased by 5 mV after 10000 cycles. The inset plot in Fig. 4a shows the chronopotentiometry curves of the Ru–S-2 and Pt/C catalysts at a constant cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2. The overpotential of the Ru–S-2 catalyst only increased by 20 mV, while Pt/C increased by 61 mV after a 12 h CP test. Furthermore, we evaluated the stability of the Ru–S-2 catalyst after it had been exposed to ambient air for one month. The result revealed (Fig. 4b) that the η10 increased by only 11 mV and the curves were almost consistent with the freshly prepared sample at a high current density. These results exhibit the excellent stability of the Ru–S-2 catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, a price activity comparison of the different catalysts was carried out at an applied potential of −0.2 V. It was revealed that both Ru–S-2 and Ru–S-2/C have significantly higher price activity than commercially available Pt/C (Fig. 4c). Additionally, ruthenium catalysts doped with other chalcogen species were also investigated for HER in alkaline electrolytes. A series of selenium-doped and tellurium-doped ruthenium catalysts were synthesized and the electrochemical results are shown in Fig. 4d. All ruthenium catalysts doped with an appropriate amount of chalcogen species manifested a higher HER activity (η10 is only 32 mV for Ru–Se and 23 mV for Ru–Te) compared to that of Pt/C, indicating that chalcogen plays a crucial role in steering water dissociation.

(b) HER polarization curves for the Ru–S-2 catalyst (fresh and after one month) in 1.0 M KOH. (c) Price activity comparison of the various studied catalysts. (d) HER polarization curves of ruthenium catalysts doped with different chalcogen species. 
In addition to the high activity, Ru–S-2 enables a good catalytic and structural stability during the HER process (Fig. S11†). The Ru–S-2 catalyst maintains the original crystalline structure and morphology after 12 h of electrocatalysis for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution. The XPS spectra of Ru 3p and the S 2p of the Ru–S-2 catalyst after the durability tests are shown in Fig. S12.† The S 2p spectrum after the stability test confirmed the considerable change in the form of the sulfur element in Ru–S-2. The electrocatalysis for HER carried out in an air environment obviously increases the amount of SOx species on the catalyst surface, which causes the deterioration of the HER activity after the stability tests.
Previous studies24–26 have reported that the presence of hydrated alkali metal cations (Cn+–(H2O)x) close to the catalyst interfaces could affect the orientation of water by assembling into a metal–Sadδ−–Cn+–(H2O)x construction to enhance the water dissociation, followed by the adsorption of Had intermediates on vicinal metal atoms, finally recombining to form H2. To prove this hypothesis experimentally, Ru–S–K+–(H2O)x networks were applied to our system and the HER electrochemical performance of Ru–S-2 at pH 14 with different concentrations of K+ was explored. As revealed in Fig. S13,† the HER activity of Ru–S-2 increased upon the addition of K+, highlighted at a high current density. This result confirms that alkali metal cations, such as K+, play a significant role in alkaline HER.
To unravel the origins of the superior catalytic performance of the S-doped Ru catalysts for alkaline HER, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to compute the electronic structure. Four chemical structural models were constructed and optimized to investigate the adsorption and dissociation of H2O on the different surfaces or sites (Fig. 5a–d), and charge density difference (CDD) owing to the adsorption to different sites of Ru–S for the H2O molecule. One can see clearly that the water molecule tends to be adsorbed on the top site of the metal surface. The adsorption energy of the H2O close to the sulfur site of the Ru–S surface is −0.52 eV, which is much lower than that on the pure Pt (111) surface (−0.22 eV) or on the Ru site of the pure Ru (001) surface (−0.40 eV), and the Ru–S surface (−0.41 eV) (Table S4†), indicating that the H2O molecule is much more strongly adsorbed close to the sulfur site of the Ru–S surface.

(e) and (f) Show the isosurfaces of the transferred charges upon adsorption of the Ru site and close to the S site of the Ru–S surface. The green and yellow contours represent the electron deletion and accumulation, respectively. The isovalue was set to 0.002 e Å−3. (g) The Gibbs free energies for the HER reaction for the formation of H* on pure Pt (111), pure Ru (001), Ru and close to the S site of the Ru–S catalyst surface. 
Furthermore, Bader charge analyses indicate that the water molecule transfers 0.035 and 0.049 electrons to the Ru–S catalyst surfaces, and the doped sulfur atom obtained 0.551 and 0.529 electrons via further analyses while adsorbed onto the Ru site and close to the S site of Ru–S, respectively, which is also verified by the charge density difference calculations (Fig. 5e and f). The transfer of electrons from the H2O molecule and Ru atoms to the S atoms can promote the polarization of the surface charge, which helps strengthen the Ru–O and S–H interaction. This is in accordance with the distances of the weak interactions between the H2O and the metal surfaces. As a consequence, the Ru–O strong interaction facilitates the dissociation of the H2O molecule and the S–H interaction favors the capture of the dissociated H atom before recombining into H2. We also explored models containing the modification of the Ru (001) surface by insertion of Se and Te atoms for comparison. As given in Table S5,† only negligible structural differences were found between them, implying that the performance is improved for similar reasons.
As depicted in Fig. 5g, the formation energy of the H* species close to the S site of S-doped Ru is 0.32 eV, which is significantly lower than that on the Ru sites of the S-doped Ru (0.62 eV), pure Ru (0.66 eV) and Pt (0.83 eV). The lower formation energy of H* is responsible for the higher activity of the H2O dissociation on the electrocatalytic surface, and the dissociation energies are 3.47, 2.92, 2.50 and 2.38 eV for pure Pt, pure Ru, Ru site and close to the S site of the S-doped Ru, respectively. Therefore, the results of the DFT computational analysis indicates that the sulfur doping enhances the HER activity of ruthenium by affecting the distribution of charges on the catalyst surface, strengthening the adsorption of H2O molecules on the surface and reducing the dissociation energy of the H2O molecules, which is beneficial for forming the adsorbed H* intermediate to recombine into H2. All of the above described results are in agreement with our experimental measurements.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared cost-effective, easily available sulfur-doped ruthenium nanoparticles using a one-step solvothermal synthesis procedure as high-efficiency platinum-free electrocatalysts for the HER in extremely alkaline media. As a consequence, the surface S of the Ru–S catalyst can form Sadδ−–K+–H2O networks to strengthen the adsorption of water and induce water molecules to dissociate, thus leading to a significantly lower overpotential of 10 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, lower Tafel slopes of 53 mV dec−1 and a higher stability than those of the metal Pt and Pt/C. In particular, the performance of the as-synthesized Ru–S-2/C composite catalyst is also remarkable. Furthermore, the Ru–S-2 and Ru–S-2/C catalysts exhibit conspicuous HER properties in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS aqueous solutions, endowing our catalysts with promising properties for splitting water to generate hydrogen in both acidic and alkaline media. In the meantime, the result shows that sulfur doping can effectively downsize the ruthenium particles, thus drastically enlarging the ECSA, as well as the exchange current density. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the origin of the eminent electrocatalytic activity of Ru–S is the appropriate adsorption and dissociation energies of water molecules on the catalyst surface, as well as improving the ability for H atom capture and recombination. The promoting effect of the sulfur species could be extended to other chalcogens, such as Se and Te. This study provides a simple strategy to synthesize chalcogen-doped ruthenium catalysts and even chalcogen-doping of materials for future clean production techniques and applications.

Materials
Indium trichloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O), selenium powder (Se), thioacetamide, DMF, concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and platinous chloride (PtCl2) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Telluric acid dihydrate (H2TeO4·2H2O) was purchased from Aladdin Co. commercial 20% Pt/C was purchased from Aldrich. The commercial Ru power (99.99%) was bought from Aladdin. The water used in all experiments with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ was prepared using an ion exchange (MilliQ, Millipore) system. All reagents were used directly without further purification.

Preparation of the catalysts. 
For the synthesis of the Ru–S catalyst, RuCl3·xH2O (0.4 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL DMF and then 0, 25, 50, and 75 μmol of thioacetamide, as the sulfur source, was added under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 30 min, the well-mixed precursor solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for solvothermal reaction at 150 °C for 24 h. When the reaction had cooled down to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized water several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. Upon increasing the feeding amount of thioacetamide during the solvothermal treatment, the catalysts with different sulfur contents (the four representative feeding amounts of thioacetamide were 0, 25, 50, and 75 μmol) denoted as Ru–S-0, Ru–S-1, Ru–S-2 and Ru–S-3 were obtained.
The synthetic process for the Ru–S-2/C catalyst is almost exactly same as the method used for the Ru–S-2 catalyst, with only 80 mg of carbon black being added to the well-mixed precursor solution before being transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and stirred vigorously for another 30 min. The synthetic process for the Pt catalyst is as same as the method used for the Ru–S-2 catalyst, except platinous chloride (PtCl2) was employed as the platinum source and thioacetamide was not used. In addition, the Ru–Se and Ru–Te catalysts were fabricated and the procedures for the preparation of the selenium and tellurium modified ruthenium catalysts were the same as those for the preparation of the Ru–S-2 catalysts, except for using selenium powder and telluric acid dihydrate (H2TeO4·2H2O) in place of thioacetamide.


Characterization. 
Powder X-ray diffraction studies were performed using a Rigaku/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) with a 15 kW system. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) was operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. TEM, scanning transmission electron (STEM) micrographs, HRTEM, EDS analyses and elemental mapping were carried out using a FEI Talos F200X field emission high resolution transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XPS was implemented on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source of Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV, 150 W), and XPS spectra were fitted with the XPSPEAK41 software in the subsequent step. TGA was accomplished in air with 10 °C min−1 from the temperature of the environment up to 1000 °C on a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT Q600, TA, USA).


Electrochemical measurements. 
The electrochemical performance was tested using a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell system with a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China). The Pt wire and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and using 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1.0 M PBS aqueous solution as the electrolyte. A glassy carbon electrode (PINE, 5 mm diameter, 0.196 cm2) was used as the working electrode. To prepare the catalyst ink, 5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and 25 μL 5 wt% of Nafion solution, then ultrasonic treatment was continued for up to 30 min. Afterwards, we dropped 20 μL of well-dispersed ink onto the glassy carbon electrode, which was polished with Al2O3 powders in advance. All catalysts had the same mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2. The electrochemical performance toward the HER of the catalysts was analyzed using LSV with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in N2-saturated alkaline and acid solution with a speed of 1500 rpm at room temperature. The stabilities of the samples were investigated from −0.05 V to +0.05 V (E vs. RHE) at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 for 10000 potential cycles and an amperometric i–t curve for 12 h. The ECSA was evaluated using a CV method by obtaining the current density from 20 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 with a 20 mV s−1 rate of increase and the voltage window was from 0.25 to 0.35 V (E vs. RHE). EIS spectra were conducted with a 100 mV overpotential in a frequency range from 0.01 to 1000000 Hz with an AC voltage of 5 mV. All of the potentials were calibrated to a RHE scale according to the Nernst equation (Evs. RHE = Evs. Ag/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH) without any iR-correction. Commercially available Ru powders (99.9%, Aladdin) and commercially available Pt/C catalysts (20%, Aldrich) were employed as a reference to estimate the electrocatalytic performance.


DFT calculation. 
A system of a 6 × 6 slab with four layers was employed to model the Pt (111) or Ru (001) catalyst, with three top layers relaxed to the bulk positions during the geometry optimizing simulations. One of the Ru atoms in the first layer was replaced by an S atom to model the Ru–S catalyst. Molecules such as H2O, H and OH− were put in all possible absorption sites: the top site, the bridge site and the hollow site to secure the most stable one. Periodic DFT computations were performed by using a plane-wave method implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.47,48 The calculations were performed at the DFT level using a frozen-core all-electron projector augmented-wave (PAW) model with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functions.49,50 The force and energy convergence criterion was set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−4 eV, respectively. An energy cutoff of 500 eV for the plane-wave expansion of the wavefunctions was used in all calculations. Spin polarization is adopted in all the calculations. The Brillouin zone was integrated by using Monkhorst–Pack generated sets of k-points, and the 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was chosen for the surface system computations. The Bader charges and the charge-density differences (CDD) for H2O on different catalysts were explored.
