    , Accepted 3rd July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractNitrogen and fluorine co-doped graphite nanofibers (N/F–GNF) and their cumulative effect with Fe and Co have been developed as an alternative non-precious metal catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media. The synergistic effect between the doped hetero atoms and the co-ordinated Fe and Co towards ORR activity and durability of the catalyst is deeply investigated. A high ORR onset potential comparable with commercial Pt/C catalyst is observed with the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst, which indicates that this catalyst is a potential alternative to Pt/C. A fivefold increase in mass activity is achieved by the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst compared to the simple N/F–GNF catalyst, which endorses the significant role of transition metal atoms in enhancing ORR activity. The advanced Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst also exhibits complete tolerance to CH3OH and CO. The Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst also exhibits excellent durability towards the ORR with only a 10 mV negative shift in its half wave potential after a 10000 repeated potential cycling test, whereas in the case of a commercial Pt/C catalyst there was an ∼110 mV negative shift under similar environmental conditions. More stringent corrosive test cycles were also performed by maintaining the cell as high as 1.4 V with a later decrease to 0.6 V vs. RHE for 300 cycles, which showed the excellent durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst in comparison with the Pt/C catalyst. XPS analysis of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst presents the ORR active chemical states of N (pyridinic-N and graphitic-N) and F (semi-ionic-F) and the co-ordinated sites of Fe and Co species with the dopants. The excellent performance and durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is due to the synergistic effect between the hetero atoms dopants (N and F) and strong co-ordinating bonds of M–N–C, which protect the graphene layers around the metallic species and greatly mitigates the leaching of Co and Fe during the long term cycling test. The high activity and long term durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst make it a promising ORR electrocatalyst for the fuel cell cathode reaction.
Introduction
Depleting fossil fuel resources, increasing energy consumption and environmental issues demand the need of alternate and sustainable energy sources, such as solar and hydrogen, for portable and transportation applications.1 Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) with hydrogen as the energy carrier is the most promising energy conversion technology owing to their high energy efficiency and zero emission.2 The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode accounts for the major voltage drop in PEMFCs, which limits fuel cells in maximizing the power density.3,4 To date, Pt based metal catalysts are widely used in PEMFCs owing to their high exchange current density on the ORR.5,6 However, the high cost, limited reserves and poor durability of Pt particles, particularly in acidic media, hinder the wide application of PEMFCs.7,8 In addition, Pt nanoparticle agglomeration and detachment from the carbon support along with carbon corrosion are major limitations in the long run operation of a PEMFC. It is noteworthy that the aforesaid processes are strongly promoted at elevated potentials (>1 V) and fast potential-transients, especially during start-up/shut down cycles, and also during local H2-starvation events.9 Another limitation is that Pt based catalysts are prone to poisoning by the adsorption of reaction intermediates, which substantially limits their performance. Thus numerous efforts have been made to develop highly active and durable alternative non-precious metal catalysts based on low cost earth abundant materials such as transition metal oxides10–13 spinels14,15 and perovskites.16,17
However, most of the non-precious metal catalysts developed so far in the literature still underperform compared with the Pt catalyst benchmark. Efforts are being made to develop ORR metal-free catalysts for fuel cell applications. Heteroatoms, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), boron (B), sulphur (S) and fluorine (F), doped carbons owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR have advantages as alternate low cost cathode catalysts in PEMFC applications.18–22 Density functional theory calculations show that the electronegativity difference between a heteroatom and carbon, induces an atomic charge density and/or spin density distribution on adjacent carbon atoms, which favor O2 adsorption and its subsequent reduction.23–25 However, none of these heteroatom doped catalysts show ORR activity that is on par with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, especially in acidic media.
To further enhance the ORR activity of these heteroatom doped carbons, transition metals, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn), may be incorporated in these non-precious metal alternatives.26–34 It has been established that non-precious metal catalysts exhibit higher ORR activity and durability compared to Pt based catalysts in alkaline media; however, the performance of these catalysts in acidic media still needs to be developed.35,36 Thus, the development of active and durable metal impregnated heteroatom doped carbon materials for the ORR in acidic media is noteworthy to investigate. Heteroatom doped carbon also contributes to mitigating the leaching of metal particles in the catalysts by forming M–N–C bonds and enhance catalyst activity and durability.
Recently, we reported the synthesis of N and F co-doped graphite nanofibers (N–F/GNFs) and investigated the synergistic effect of N and F on the morphological and ORR behavior on the GNF surface.37 It was observed that the N–F/GNF catalyst undergoes structural transformation resulting in wrinkled graphene structures with many active open-edge sites that facilitate ORR activity. The developed catalyst is not affected by CH3OH or CO, and no degradation was observed after 20000 repeated potential cycles, which make it highly competitive as a metal-free electro-catalyst for the ORR. Further enhancement of catalytic activity and PEMFC performance of this catalyst may be obtained by inserting transition metals, such as Fe and Co, via suitable synthetic protocols and metal content optimization.
Herein, we investigate the cumulative effect of Fe and Co individually or in combination with the N–F/GNF support in the enhancement of ORR activity and durability in acidic media. It is found that simultaneous co-doping of Fe and Co in the N–F/GNF catalyst (Fe–Co/NF–GNF) results in better electrochemical features and further enhances the ORR behavior compared to the individual doped metal particles (Fe/NF–GNF or Co/NF–GNF). The Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst was subjected to 10000 repeated potential cycles and it displayed excellent stability in ORR activity. The stability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst was also established under more rigorous corrosive test cycles, i.e., keeping the cell at the higher potential of ∼1.4 V for 180 s and later dropping it to 0.6 V for 30 s vs. RHE for 300 cycles.38 The enhanced activity and durability of Fe–Co/NF–GNF is attributed to the cumulative affect between the heteroatoms and metal dopants toward the ORR. Unlike the Pt/C catalyst, the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst displayed selectivity towards the ORR in the presence of CH3OH and CO species. This provides new insights and understanding on the synthesis of more advanced non-precious metal catalysts for the efficient reduction of O2, which is useful in PEMFCs and metal–air batteries, with superior durability.
Experimental section
Materials
Graphite nanofibers (GNF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and ammonium fluoride (NH4F), melamine (C6H3N6), cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)3), ferric chloride (FeCl3) and perchloric acid (HClO4) were obtained from Acros Organics. Pt/C (40 wt% Pt on carbon) was obtained from Alfa Aesar, (Johnson Matthey Ltd). The de-ionized water (18.4 MΩ cm) used in the experiments was produced by a Millipore system.
Synthesis of Fe/NF–GNF, Co/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts
The nitrogen and fluorine doped GNF (N–F/GNF) catalyst was synthesized using a similar procedure to our earlier report described elsewhere.37 The N–F/GNF catalyst was synthesized by employing C6H3N6 and NH4F as the nitrogen and fluorine sources, respectively. The mass ratios of GNF to C6H3N6 for N/GNF and GNF to NH4F for F/GNF were optimized and they were found to be 1:20 and 1:15, respectively, based on their optimized ORR behavior. The optimized compositions were considered for the co-doping of N and F in GNF (N–F/GNF). For the synthesis of Fe and Co doped N–F/GNF, GNF was dispersed in 25 mL of H2O followed by the addition of the required amount of C6H3N6 (1:20), NH4F (1:15), FeCl3 and Co(NO3)2 with mass ratios of 5%, 10% and 15% in each case with magnetic stirring overnight to realize the Fe/NF–GNF and Co/NF–GNF catalysts. The resulting solution was dried for complete evaporation of water molecules. The subsequent solid mixture was then grounded to a fine powder and pyrolyzed at 900 °C under an N2 atmosphere for 1 h at a heating ramp of 3 °C min−1. For the synthesis of the Fe and Co co-doped catalyst (Fe–Co/NF–GNF), the total metal loading was optimized and maintained at 10 wt% by taking 5 wt% of each metal content and a similar process was followed. All the catalysts synthesized in this study were acid leached in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 12 h to remove the residual metallic species. After acid leaching, the catalysts were filtered, dried and evaluated for their electrochemical properties.
Physico-chemical characterization
The morphologies of the GNF and metal supported catalyst (Fe–Co/NF–GNF) were examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), Model: JEOL-2100. For these measurements, the samples were suspended in acetone with ultrasonic dispersion for 3 min. Subsequently, a drop of the suspension was deposited on a carbon-coated copper grid and allowed to dry prior to the TEM analysis. The morphological images of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts and mapping of the elements were studied using a high resolution scanning electron microscope (Model: FEI Quanta FEG 200). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250 XPS system) using a monochromated Al Kα source at 15 keV and a 150 W system was used to identify elements and their quantification.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical tests for the catalysts were performed on a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) apparatus, Bio-Logic Instruments, VSP/VMP 3B-20 at 25 °C. A glassy carbon disk (geometric area: 0.071 cm2) was used as the substrate. A catalyst ink was obtained by adding 5 mg catalyst and 10 wt% Nafion solution to 1 mL of water followed by ultra-sonication for 30 min. A 14 μL aliquot of the dispersed suspension was transferred onto the glassy carbon disk electrode to obtain a catalyst loading of 900 μg cm−2. For comparison, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was used. In the case of the Pt/C catalyst, a catalyst suspension was obtained by adding 2 mg of the catalyst to 500 μL of water followed by ultra-sonication for 30 min. A 3.5 μL aliquot of the dispersed suspension was transferred on to the glassy carbon disk to obtain a Pt loading of 20 μg cm−2. For the Pt/C catalyst the LSVs were recorded from the anodic scan to avoid the side effect of anion adsorption at the high potential region.39 Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.5 M HClO4 aqueous solution purged with N2 gas to remove dissolved O2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for ORR activity measurements were performed using an RDE in aqueous 0.5 M HClO4 saturated with O2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at different rotation speeds. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments with a GC disk of 5 mm in diameter and a Pt ring (Pine Instruments) were also performed to validate the percentage peroxide yield and electron transfer number during the ORR process. The disk electrode was scanned at a rate of 5 mV s−1 between 1–0 V, and the ring electrode potential was set to 1.440 V. All potentials are reported in terms of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale for convenience. To test the electrochemical stability of the catalysts, the CVs were repeated for 10000 potential cycles between 0 and 1 V vs. RHE and LSVs were recorded. To evaluate the stability of the catalyst support, a more stringent test method was employed by holding the catalyst at the higher potential of 1.4 V for 150 s and then decreasing the potential to 0.60 V for 30 s to complete a cycle. This process was repeated for 300 cycles and CV and LSV data were recorded for all the catalysts. The CH3OH tolerance and CO sensitivity of the catalysts were also assessed through LSV in O2 saturated 0.5 M HClO4 with 2 M CH3OH or CO (20 ppm) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The CO sensitivity test was performed by bubbling 20 ppm CO contained in N2 gas into the electrolyte solution at 0.1 V vs. RHE for 45 min. Before the CVs were recorded, the electrolyte was purged with pure N2 gas for 30 min to remove accumulated CO species in the electrolyte and again bubbled with O2 for saturation.
Results and discussion
The present study describes the impregnation of non-precious transition metals, such as Fe and Co, into the NF/GNF catalyst developed in our earlier study for further enhancement in ORR behavior, which is useful for PEFC applications.37Fig. 1 shows the TEM images for pristine GNF, N–F/GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts. It is found that co-doping of N and F in GNF induced unzipping of the GNF into wrinkled graphene sheets with many active open-edge sites (Fig. 1b). Such wrinkled open edged active sites have higher ORR activity than the basal plane sites. This ratifies the ease and facile method of synthesizing graphene materials compared to the most expensive and complicated synthesis processes such as chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge of graphite electrodes. To further enhance the ORR activity, Fe and Co metals were deposited individually or in combination in this doped graphene-like material (N–F/GNF). The HR-TEM images of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst are shown in Fig. 1c–f, wherein uniform deposition of Fe and Co particles deposited on the graphene layers are clearly observed. Clear lattice fringes are also seen in the inset of Fig. 1(e) and the d-spacing of 0.48 nm is attributed to the (1 1 1) plane of the Fe2O3 nanoparticle, which is one of the different phases of Fe species in the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst. This is also in correlation with the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the dark field TEM images also show bright spots representing the metallic Fe and Co particles. These Fe and Co nanoparticles were also analyzed by their elemental mapping, as shown in Fig. 1h–l. It is also observed that some of these Fe and Co nanoparticles are encapsulated and dispersed well over the graphene sheets (Fig. 1f). Because the metallic precursors are added along with heteroatom (N and F) doping in the GNF, the encapsulation of the metal particles occurs during the heat treatment process, while GNF undergoes conversion to graphene sheets under the N2 atmosphere.40,41 These results indicate that the Fe and Co nanoparticles are surrounded by graphene layers and hold tightly to the matrix. Such geometric confinement of metal nanoparticles in graphene layers enhances the interaction between metal particles and conductive doped graphene layers, thereby suppressing the dissolution and agglomeration of metal nanoparticles.42,43 Furthermore, due to the charge transfer between metallic clusters and graphene sheets, O2 adsorption and its subsequent reduction on the catalyst surface is accelerated.44Fig. 2 represents the high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) image and corresponding EDAX elemental mapping analysis of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst. A uniform distribution of Fe and Co species along with N and F is observed throughout the catalyst, which further confirms the co-doping of Fe and Co in the graphene matrix.

The chemical phases of Fe and Co species in all the catalysts were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, as shown in Fig. 3. It is found that both Fe and Co species exist in the mixed phases of oxides, carbides and nitrides in both the Fe/NF–GNF and Co/NF–GNF catalysts. For the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst, similar behavior, i.e., a mixture of oxides, carbides and nitrides of Fe and Co were obtained, which indicates that Fe and Co species exist independently, but not in the form of an alloy. Among these species, the appearance of carbide species further supports that the metal nanoparticles are encapsulated by the graphene layers, as observed from the TEM images (Fig. 1f). The existence of Fe and Co species in the form of nitrides is also supported by XPS analysis results of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst, which is discussed in a later section.
After affirming the successful doping of hetero atoms and transition metals individually or in combination, investigations on the electrochemical ORR activity for various compositions of Fe and Co doped catalysts were carried out to determine the optimum metal contents. It was found that the optimum loading for both Fe and Co was 10 wt% with respect to N–F/GNF, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a and b represent the CVs for the Co/NF–GNF and Fe/NF–GNF catalysts, respectively, wherein clear and well defined reduction peaks between 0.49 and 0.67 V vs. RHE are observed, which are attributed to the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen, and they could not be replicated after O2 was replaced by N2, thus indicating that the peaks are typical ORR peaks. It is noteworthy that the ORR reduction peaks shifted to a higher potential with the increased metal loadings and were found to be maximum at 10 wt% for both the Co and Fe doped catalysts. Fig. 4c and d show the LSV curves for the Co/NF–GNF and Fe/NF–GNF catalysts, respectively, representing the effect of metal loading on ORR activity. The ORR behavior for both catalysts are enhanced and are maximum for 10 wt% metal loading, which is in close agreement with the CV data (Fig. 4a and b). Further increase in the metal loading to 15 wt% has no statistical positive effect on the ORR behavior, which may be due to the lack of active M–N–C ORR centers and therefore this results in a reduction of ORR activity. The optimized metal loading of 10 wt% for both Co and Fe in the present study is also in agreement with many Fe and Co based catalysts in the literature.45–47 To investigate the cumulative effect, Fe and Co co-doping in the catalyst was performed by keeping the optimized metal loading of 10 wt%, i.e., by fixing the Co and Fe content at 5 wt% each in the catalyst. Fig. 4e and f compare the CV and LSV, respectively, of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst with the individually doped metal catalysts. It is observed that the ORR redox peak potential of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst appears at 0.68 V vs. RHE, which is the highest among all the catalysts studied here. It is also noteworthy to observe that the ORR onset potential of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is positively shifted by 140, 60, and 20 mV in comparison to the NF/GNF, Co/NF–GNF and Fe/NF–GNF catalysts, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4f and Table 2. The enhanced ORR activity of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is due to the formation of active M–N–C sites and the synergistic effect between the metallic species and the heteroatom dopants.

Cyclic voltammograms of (e) optimized NF/GNF, Co/NF–GNF (10 wt%), Fe/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in O2 saturated 0.5 M HClO4 and LSVs were recorded at 1600 rpm in O2 saturated 0.5 M HClO4. 

Fig. 5a shows the LSV comparison of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The half wave potential of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is lower by 60 mV in relation to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. However, the ORR activity of the synthesized Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is appreciable as a non-precious metal catalyst. This shows the potential application of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst towards the ORR due to the synergistic effect of hetero-atoms (N and F) with the supplemental activity of Fe and Co metals forming active centers. Furthermore, the tolerance of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst to CH3OH and CO was assessed by CV measurements, which are shown in Fig. 5b, and it was found that the catalyst did not show any response to the addition of CH3OH or CO to the system, and the normal characteristic of the O2 redox peak was retained. On the other hand, the Pt/C catalyst exhibits obvious methanol oxidation peaks (Fig. 5c) in the anodic region in the presence of methanol and a strong CO oxidation peak (Fig. 5d) in the presence of CO species, indicating the poisoning of the catalyst towards the methanol and CO species.

Furthermore, the Tafel behavior for the Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF, Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts are shown in Fig. 6a, and the Tafel slopes calculated for these catalysts were 93, 91 and 88 mV per decade, respectively, suggesting that Fe–Co/NF–GNF has relatively faster ORR kinetics compared to the others. To determine the kinetic current and mass activity of the catalysts developed in this study, the corresponding LSV curves were mass-transport corrected.48 The calculated ik values for the NF/GNF, Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts at 0.8 V vs. RHE were found to be −0.45, −0.87, −1.28, and −2.30 mA cm−2 and the corresponding mass activities are 4.52, 9.65, 14.24 and 25.62, respectively. The mass activity values increased up to 5 times after the co-deposition of Fe and Co in the NF/GNF catalyst, as shown in Fig. 6b. This gives a clear indication that the presence of transition metals, such as Co and Fe, creates more active ORR centers in the hybrid catalyst, which enhance the ORR reaction kinetics and activity and this opens up the possibility of cost effective alternate ORR electrocatalysts for the fuel cell cathode reaction.

The ORR polarization curves of the Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF, and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts show an increase in current density at higher rotation speeds of the electrode, as shown in Fig. 7a, c and e, respectively. This is due to the shortened diffusion distance between the electrode and electrolyte at high rotation speeds. The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots shown in (Fig. 7b, d and f), i.e., the plot of the inverse of current density (id−1) as a function of the inverse of the square root of the rotation rate (ω−1/2), are obtained from eqn (1) and (2) and are employed to calculate the number of electrons involved during the ORR process.49,50 id = Bω−1/2(1) B = 0.2nFCO2DO22/3ν−1/6(2)where id is the diffusion controlled current density, n is the number of electrons exchanged per O2 molecule, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), CO2 is the bulk oxygen concentration in the electrolyte (1.22 × 10−6 mol cm−3), DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of molecular oxygen (1.93 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.0913 cm2 s−1), ω is the rotations of the disk expressed in rpm (ω = 2πN, N is the linear rotation speed) and 0.2 is a constant used when ω is expressed in rpm. The good linearity of the K–L plots and near parallelism indicates first order reaction kinetics for all the catalysts. The number of electrons calculated from the slopes of the K–L plots for all the catalyst was found to be 4, which demonstrates a dominant 4 electron transfer process during the ORR.

To further verify the ORR catalytic pathways of the synthesized catalysts, rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were performed and the formation of peroxide species (HO2−) was monitored during the ORR process. The percentage peroxide yield and the number of electrons transferred (n) were calculated using eqn (3) and (4): (3) (4)where Id is disk current, Ir is ring current and N is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring.

Fig. 8 shows the comparative RRDE curves of the Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts and the calculated electron transfer number and HO2− generated during the ORR. The calculated peroxide yield for the Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts was found to be 8.35%, 3.57% and 0.44% and the average number of electrons was calculated to be 3.83, 3.92 and 3.99, respectively. Among the three catalysts, the Co/NF–GNF catalyst produced a higher yield of peroxide than the Fe/NF–GNF catalyst. In contrast, the co-existence of Fe and Co in the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst results in significantly less peroxide formation (<1%). This result clearly indicates the specific synergistic effect of Co and Fe for the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst in catalyzing the highly efficient ORR reaction by a dominant 4 electron pathway.

In general, the durability of metal catalysts is affected by the metal leaching out in an acidic environment and this is one of the major restrictions, which decrease PEFC performance. In the present study, the durability of the developed catalysts were also investigated by cycling the potential of the working electrodes between 0 and 1 V vs. RHE up to 10000 potential cycles in O2 saturated 0.5 M HClO4 electrolyte at 25 °C, as shown in Fig. 9(a, c and e). The stability of the catalysts towards ORR activity was also assessed by means of LSV before and after 10000 cycles and is presented in Fig. 9(b, d and f). For comparison, the commercial Pt/C catalyst was also examined under similar conditions. The half wave potentials of the Co/NF–GNF, Fe/NF–GNF and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts decreased by 30, 40 and 10 mV, respectively, after 10000 potential cycles. Similar negative shifts in the redox potentials of the catalysts are also observed in the respective CV curves. Only a 10 mV reduction in the half wave potential for the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst was obtained, which shows the highest durability among all the catalysts. This is exclusively credited to the synergistic effect of Co and Fe in the graphene network in enhancing the ORR behavior. However, after 10000 potential cycles, in similar conditions, a negative shift of 110 mV in the half wave potentials is observed for the commercial Pt/C catalyst along with a drastic reduction in the Pt electro chemical surface area (∼54%) from its initial value of 79 m2 g−1–43 m2 g−1 (Fig. 10a and b). The poor durability of Pt/C is attributed to Pt particle agglomeration and sintering, along with carbon corrosion. The highly stable and more graphitic structure of GNF and later transformation to graphene structures further enhance the corrosion resistance in acidic media for the GNF supported catalysts. In addition, the presence of electronegative elements such as F in the N doped carbon significantly enhances the durability of the metal supported catalyst.38,51

To further probe the catalyst stability, a more stringent corrosive test method was employed by holding the catalyst at 1.4 V for 150 s and then dropping the potential to 0.60 V for 30 s to complete a cycle.38,52 This process was repeated for 300 cycles for the Fe–Co/NF–GNF and Pt/C catalysts and their corresponding CV and LSV were recorded prior and after the cycle test (Fig. 10c–f). This testing protocol simulates the real operating conditions of fuel cells wherein sudden shoot up in the potential quite often occurs during the start-up and shut-down process of a PEMFC, which leads to severe carbon corrosion.53–58 After 300 cycles, a drastic ESA reduction of ∼65% is observed for the commercial Pt/C catalyst along with a severe negative shift in the onset and half wave potentials (Fig. 10c and d). By contrast, the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst showed much improved electrochemical behavior after 300 potential cycling (Fig. 10e and f). The reduction in the ORR half-wave potential of the Pt/C and Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalysts was found to be 190 and 40 mV, respectively. The excellent durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst could be attributed to the stable N and F doped graphene support38 as well as the protecting graphene layers around the metallic species, which mitigates the leaching of Co and Fe during cycling. Possible Fe–N–C and Co–N–C covalent bonds also contribute the stability of the catalyst, which prevents the detachment of Fe and Co species from the graphene matrix.

Fig. 11a shows the XPS survey spectra of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst. The spectra shows clear peaks at 284, 399, 686, 726, and 784 eV for the elements C, N, F, Fe and Co, respectively, which confirms the co-existence of N and F heteroatoms and Fe, Co metal particles in the catalyst. The atomic percentage of the doped content of N and F were found be 11 and 1.1, respectively, based on our earlier study.37 All the peaks are deconvoluted to understand the chemical states of the elements and their interaction with each other. The carbon spectrum is deconvoluted into five peaks, corresponding to the different bonding configurations of carbon, as shown in Fig. 11b. The peaks located at 284.05, 284.7, 285.4, 286.5 and 289.7 eV correspond to sp3 carbon, sp2 carbon, –C–N, –C–O and –C–F bonding, respectively. The appearance of the –C–N and –C–F bonding configuration in the catalyst clearly confirms the doping of N and F in the carbon matrix.59,60 Similarly, the nitrogen spectra (Fig. 11c) are deconvoluted into two peaks at 398.06 and 400.08 eV, which are attributed to pyridinic-N and graphitic-N species, respectively. It is also noteworthy that a peak at 398.96 eV in the nitrogen spectra is observed, which corresponds to Fe/Co bonding to pyridinic-N as also observed in the literature.61–63 Pyridinic-N has a greater tendency to form a coordination bond with Fe and Co species, which in turn acts as an active site for the ORR.64 Most importantly, the strong coordination bond between Fe–N and Co–N enhances ORR activity and avoids leaching of the metallic species, which is responsible for the high durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst, as observed from the repeated potential cyclic test discussed above. Fig. 11d shows the deconvoluted spectra for F, which presents two distinguished peaks, one at 685.3 and the other at 687.1 eV corresponds to ionic –C–F and semi-ionic –C–F bonds, respectively, in the carbon matrix. It is also proposed in our earlier study that the semi-ionic C–F bond is more active towards the ORR, which polarizes the adjacent carbon atoms to a greater extent especially in the presence of N atoms. Therefore, the existence of semi-ionic –C–F bonds can assure this phenomenon and is the responsible factor for the enhanced activity of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst. Fig. 11e shows the Fe 2p deconvoluted spectra, which show two doublet peaks, one doublet at 711.8 and 713.7 eV, corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and the second doublet at 723.9 and 725.5 eV corresponds to Fe 2p1/2 species.65 Similarly, the Co 2p spectra (Fig. 11f) are also deconvoluted into two doublets, viz., the first at 797.6 and 789.9 eV and second at 781.7 and 788.2 eV.66 The Co peak at 781.7 eV is also attributed to the Co species co-ordinated with N.67 These findings indicate that the co-existence of Fe and Co in the catalysts synergistically contributes to the enhancement of ORR activity, which is observed from the LSV data.

Recently, much effort has been devoted to exploring the nature of the active ORR sites in non-precious metal catalysts.68 Several computational studies predict that Fe/Co–N sites are energetically favorable for catalyzing the ORR and are more stable under the potential range of 0–1.23 V vs. RHE.69–72 In this study, the high ORR activity and durability of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst is due to the synergistic chemical coupling effects between hetero atoms dopants and transition metal atoms co-ordinated with N and F species. The ORR performance of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst developed in this study is compared with the non-noble metal catalysts in acidic media available in the literature and is presented in Table 1. Among them, the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst shows the highest ORR onset potential.

The nature of the ORR active sites in M–N–C catalysts is still not well understood in the view point of whether the transition metals acts as ORR active centers or they simply assist in fixing N into the carbon lattice.73,74 However, several reports suggest that metal particles in the M–N–C catalyst act as ORR active sites owing to the lower performance of metal-free catalysts.75,76 Very recently, A. Zitolo et al. also confirmed using Mössbauer spectra and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra that the enhancement of ORR activity of graphene based M–N–C catalysts is due to the presence of metal particles.77 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also predict that the ORR pathway of transition metal based catalysts depends on the level of M–N–C co-ordination chemistry.78–81 The Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst shows enhanced ORR activity due to the synergistic effect between Fe and Co species. Especially, in the Fe and Co co-doped catalyst, the additional transfer of d-electrons of cobalt to the π-system of the carbon basal plane can modify the local M–N–C electronic structure, thus leading to the favorable adsorption of oxygen molecules and its subsequent reduction.82 This significant effect is not found in the individual Fe/NF–GNF or Co/NF–GNF catalysts and they show comparatively lower activities than the co-doped catalysts. This was also clearly confirmed via RRDE measurements (Fig. 8), wherein the percentage peroxide yield is considerably less for the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst compared to the other catalysts. In the light of this, the enhancement in ORR activity for the Fe–Co co-doped catalyst (Fe–Co/NF–GNF) observed in our study is attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe and Co towards ORR activity, the formation of M–N–C structures as evidence by XPS analysis and the protective host–guest metal carbides as supported by TEM analysis. Deeper investigation to understand the synergistic effect of Fe and Co in the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst using advanced techniques, such as Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies and DFT calculations, will be the future study of this work.

Conclusions
In the process of developing non-precious metallic catalysts for the ORR, a novel catalyst comprising co-doped Fe and Co in N–F/GNF was developed, and its physico-electrochemical characteristics along with durability in acidic media were thoroughly investigated. The developed Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst exhibited excellent ORR activity and extraordinary durability in comparison with a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst exhibited complete resistance to the methanol and CO species. XPS analysis of the Fe–Co/NF–GNF catalyst shows the strong co-ordination bond of Co and Fe with the N forming ORR active N–M–C complexes. These strong co-ordination bonds mitigate the leaching of Fe and Co species during the cycling process and ameliorate the ORR activity and durability in acidic medium.
