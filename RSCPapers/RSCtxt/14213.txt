    , Accepted 24th September 2019First published on 8th October 2019AbstractThe CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemicals and fuels is of both fundamental and practical significance, since it can lead to the more efficient storage of renewable energy and promote the carbon cycle. Here, the CO2RR to formate over N2-plasma-activated CoOx/ZrO2–graphite intercalation compounds was achieved with enhanced activity and selectivity, with a faradaic efficiency of 98.4% toward formate production and a current density of 8.2 mA cm−2 at −0.35 V vs. RHE. A combination of experimental data and DFT calculations revealed that an increased Co2+ content on the surface of the CoOx nanoclusters could reduce the energy barrier to the formation of *CO2δ−, which is the rate-determining step regarding the overpotential of the CO2RR to formate. The π–π* bonds between the graphite layers, possessing the peculiar electronic structure of ZrO2–graphite intercalation compounds, endowed the material with good electron transfer and fast carrier transport properties, and could help the formation of *OCHO to increase the selectivity for formate. This strategy provides a simple and efficient route to develop nanoclusters supported by graphite intercalation compounds for the CO2RR to formate, with high selectivity and efficiency.
1. Introduction
Currently, global warming and the energy crisis are two important issues, and they are both rooted in the utilization of fossil fuels accompanied by the release of the greenhouse gas CO2.1 The conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels through an electrochemical approach, powered by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, is viewed as an ideal pathway for both balancing CO2 in the atmosphere and promoting carbon cycling.2,3 However, several main challenges, including poor product selectivity, high overpotential and poor electrocatalyst durability, are seriously hampering the real application of this process; the thermodynamic stability of CO2 (CO, 806 kJ mol−1) and the competitive reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous solution also need to be considered.4 The electroreduction of CO2 into formate is more desirable, as this does not involve the complete dissociation of strong carbon–oxygen bonds.5 In the last few decades, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the performance of the CO2RR over metal catalysts, such as Cu,6,7 Ag,8 Sn,9 Pd10,11 and Bi.12,13 The selectivity for formate could reach ∼100% over Bi and Sn-based catalysts,14,15 while the overpotential was high (>0.6 V vs. RHE).
Recently, Co-based catalysts have been used for the catalytic conversion of CO2 into formate with low overpotentials. Gao et al. reported that ultrathin layers of Co3O4 showed a low overpotential for reducing CO2 into formate (0.24 V), while the faradaic efficiency remained around 60%.16 The special activity was connected not only to an increased number of surface sites, typical of low-dimensional systems, but also to the peculiar electronic structure of the ultrathin film, which endowed the material with good electron transfer and fast carrier transport properties and a low corrosion rate. Moreover, it was also reported that thin layers of partially oxidized cobalt exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward the CO2RR.17 In Table S4,† the prior research into different metal catalysts for CO2 reduction is summarized.18–33 Compared with other metals, lower overpotentials (∼0.3 V) for reducing CO2 to formate are observed with Co-based catalysts, but they show limited faradaic efficiency (<90%). Therefore, the aim of this study is to increase the selectivity for formate on Co-based catalysts with low overpotential, and to reveal the structural requirements to obtain high selectivity.
On the other hand, nanoclusters are proposed to enhance the active sites for CO2 electrocatalytic or photocatalytic reduction into valuable products owing to their favorable electronic and chemical properties.33–38 In particular, computational studies have suggested that the broken local spatial symmetry near nanoclusters can enhance the binding energy between the catalyst surface active site and the reaction intermediate. Nanoclusters in a Co catalyst are thus predicted to promote HCOOH formation, particularly in terms of selectivity and overpotential.
ZrO2 can serve as a provider of effective sites for the adsorption of CO2 and electron donors,39,40 and it has been widely applied in photocatalytic CO2 reactions.41,42 However, the inherently low electron conductivity of ZrO2 (the band gap energy (Eg) for bulk ZrO2 is 5.0 eV) greatly limits its electrocatalytic activity and applications in electrocatalysis. Previous reports have indicated that the catalytic activities of ZrO2 electrocatalysts can be further improved in the form of composites with samarium/europium,43 reduced graphene oxide, and graphite flakes.44,45 Yu et al. reported that 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), a promising biofuel, could be effectively produced from biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using a novel ZrO2-doped graphite electrode via a two-step method.46 Miao et al. reported for the first time the preparation of ZrO2 NPs anchored on N-doped carbon via a chelation reaction; they could serve as an outstanding electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO.47 However, there are π–π bonds between the graphite layers in carbon materials such as graphene nanosheets and graphite flakes48 that are not conducive to electron transfer and fast carrier transport. Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are formed through intercalation reactions, and slight increases are observed in the values of d100 and d110, suggesting that the π–π interactions that decrease the lengths of carbon–carbon bonds are partially disrupted. Thus, in this work, we envisaged inserting ZrO2 as an intercalator with electron-donating abilities to obtain graphite intercalation compounds (ZrO2–GICs), enhancing the conductivity of graphite and the adsorption of CO2; these were used as the catalyst supports for electrocatalysts.
In this work, through engineering the interactions between Co(OH)2 and the ZrO2–graphite intercalation compounds (ZrO2–GICs), Co(OH)2 could be deposited on the ZrO2–GIC surfaces. After treatment with N2-plasma, CoOx nanoclusters with partially non-stoichiometric cobalt oxide were formed on the ZrO2–GIC surfaces. These excellent CoOx nanocluster catalysts have high FEformate values at low overpotentials with considerable current density. Therefore, we provide an easily scalable alternative route for fabricating meso-sized structured nanocluster catalyst domains for transforming CO2 into formate; this elaborately designed catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity for turning CO2 into formate.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst synthesis
ZrO2-intercalated graphite compounds (ZrO2–GICs) were synthesized via a solid reaction process with purified flaky graphite (99.98 wt%, 100 μm) and ZrO2 (99.99 wt%, 0.2–0.4 μm). The molar ratio of ZrO2 to graphite was 0.05:3 and, after grinding in a mortar, the mixture was transferred to a tube furnace and reacted at 1100 °C for 1 h under vacuum at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1; the as-synthesized samples are collectively denoted as ZrO2–GICs. The remnant ZrO2 was removed via first washing with diluted H2SO4 solution (V(H2SO4):V(H2O) = 2:1), followed by rinsing with water, and finally drying in air at ambient temperature.
The preparation of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs and N2-plasma activation: 0.5 g of ZrO2–GICs was dispersed in 20 ml of deionized water (solution A). 8 ml of Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution (0.12 M) was added to solution A under stirring at room temperature (solution B). Then, 2 ml of NaOH aqueous solution (0.5 M) was slowly added to solution B under vigorous stirring, followed by aging for 12 h at room temperature. The precipitates were collected via centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C to obtain Co(OH)2/ZrO2–GICs. N2-plasma was applied to activate the resulting Co(OH)2/ZrO2–GICs via a plasma etcher (OPS Plasma, SY-DT02) under a N2 pressure of 400 mTorr and a power of 100 W for 2 min. The as-prepared catalyst was defined as CoOx/ZrO2–GICs.
For comparison, Co3O4/graphite was prepared via the same procedure using graphite instead of ZrO2–GICs, and CoOx/graphite was obtained after N2-plasma activation.
2.2 Characterization
The crystalline structures of the samples were examined using X-ray diffraction apparatus (Rigaku D/max-3C) equipped with a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.542 Å) radiation. The identity period Ic of the GICs was determined by referring to high purity silicon powder as an internal standard. For a given stage ‘n’ of ZrO2–GICs, the (00n + 2) peak is of maximum intensity. The ‘c’ axis repeat distance Ic is related to the stage number through the relationship:49Ic = (c − 1)C0 + dswhere ds = di + C0, which is the intercalant sandwich thickness, where di is the intercalant thickness and C0 is the interlayer distance of pure graphite. From Bragg's law we have2Icsinθ = lλ.
From these two equations, the angle 2θ at which the peak for a given stage should occur can be calculated, and the compounds are thus characterized with respect to stages.
The catalyst morphology was evaluated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200s G2, Thermo Scientific) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F, JEOL) combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data from the samples was analyzed using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD (Thermo ESCAlab250) instrument under ultra-high vacuum, with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at a power of 450 W (30 mA, 15 kV).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The CO2RR was conducted using a standard three-electrode system in a gastight two compartment electrochemical cell (separated by a piece of Nafion-212 membrane), with 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (298 K, pH = 6.8) as the electrolyte (Fig. S1†). All measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 302N). A Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared through coating a catalyst slurry onto a pre-polished glassy carbon disk electrode (GCE) 3.0 mm in diameter, followed by air drying to remove the solvent. In brief, the catalyst slurry was obtained through ultrasonicating a suspension of catalyst and Nafion solution (5 wt%, Dupont) in isopropanol.
After purging with high-purity Ar (99.999%) for 0.5 h to exclude any dissolved gases, the CO2RR was started with the influx of pure CO2 (99.99%, 20 ml min−1) for at least 0.5 h to obtain CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte (298 K). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were conducted with the continued influx of CO2 to evaluate the catalytic activities of the catalysts. Controlled potential electrolysis was performed via chronoamperometry methods. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were recorded over a frequency range of 1–105 Hz, at a potential of −0.35 V vs. RHE with an amplitude of 5 mV.
2.4 Product analysis
The liquid products were analyzed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker 500 UltraShield™), and the results are shown in Fig. S6.† The gas products were analyzed via online gas chromatography (GC, GC1100) every 30 min. CO and H2 were quantified TCD and FID with molecular sieve 13X and HayeSep Q columns, respectively. The reported faradaic efficiency (FE) and transformation frequency (TOF) values were calculated on the basis of the product distribution and the current values after 2 h of reaction at a constant potential (ESI†).
2.5 Density functional theory calculations
All calculations were performed using the DMol3 package. The DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSSP) method was employed to treat the relativistic effects of transition metals through introducing some degree of relativistic effective potential. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional and the long-range dispersion correction via Grimme's scheme were adopted to describe the exchange and correlation effects. Double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was chosen as the atomic orbital basis set. The Methfessel–Paxton (MP) method with a smearing width of 0.005 Ha was adopted for the transition metal surfaces.50
CoOx/ZrO2–GICs nanoclusters were described via a simplified model system, with a Co10O12 cluster deposited on a periodic 4 × 3 supercell containing a 6-layer graphite slab with two-atom-thick ZrO2, separated perpendicularly by a 20 Å vacuum in the z-direction. Co3O4 in Co3O4/graphite and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs was described by {311} Co3O4. The convergence tolerances of the energy, maximum force, and displacement were set to 1.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively, and a basis set cut-off of 4.4 Å was employed to ensure high-quality computational results. The reciprocal space was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid for geometry optimization, with the bottom two layers fixed in their bulk positions, while a 12 × 12 × 1 grid was used for electronic structure computations. The charge transfer and magnetic moment were determined according to the Hirshfeld method.
The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated according to the following equation:51Eads = Eadsorbate/substrate − Eadsorbate − Esubstratewhere Eadsorbate/substrate is the total energy of the adsorbate–substrate system in the equilibrium state, and Eadsorbate and Esubstrate are the total energies of the free adsorbate and substrate, respectively, including hydrocarbons, metal-oxide clusters and H atoms.
All thermodynamic properties were calculated via the following equation:ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔSwhere ΔE is the reaction energy change based on the total energies from DFT calculations, ΔZPE is the variation in zero point energy (ZPE) and ΔS is the change in entropy before and after the reaction. T is the temperature (298 K). The standard entropy values were cited from the literature.
3. Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the fabrication process of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs is shown in Fig. 1a. With ZrO2 intercalated in the layers of graphite, XRD studies showed that the peak intensity from graphite ({002}, JCPDS#26-1079) was significantly reduced compared with samples without ZrO2 intercalation (Fig. S2†). According to Bragg's law,49 ZrO2–GICs here is in stage 3. The intercalating species (ZrO2) exist in van der Waals galleries, and a peak from ZrO2 ({011}, JCPDS#50-1089) was detected in ZrO2–GICs. Within the same layer, intercalating atoms (ions) attracted each other, but in different layers, atoms (ions) repelled each other. The atoms (ions) packed into islands and formed ladders.52 The XRD patterns of Co3O4/graphite and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs reveal a cubic phase structure, with the peak position of 2θ = 36.68° assigned to the {311} diffraction of the cubic crystalline phase (JCPDS#43-1003). However, the peak from Co3O4 {311} was not detected in N2-plasma pretreated catalysts of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs (Fig. 1b) and CoOx/graphite (Fig. S2†), which indicated that cobalt oxide existed in an amorphous state (CoOx nanoclusters) or a highly dispersed state. This result showed that N2-plasma treatment could promote the formation of highly dispersed cobalt oxide on the surface of the ZrO2–GICs substrate.

SEM images show the uniform layers of the original graphite with densely packed sheets (Fig. 2a). After heat treatment at 1100 °C for 1 h under vacuum at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, the calcined graphite sheets (graphite itself) become randomly arranged, and the size of the sheets was reduced (Fig. 2a, inset). However, ZrO2–GICs displayed abundant flower-like structures (Fig. 2b), which could indicate that ZrO2 played a role in promoting the formation of the flower-like morphology rather than the heat treatment of graphite. The interlayer distance between the graphite sheets in ZrO2–GICs increased obviously to form a loose layered structure (Fig. 2c), resulting in an obvious volume increase for the intercalated graphite (Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 2d–f, the inner lattice spacings were 0.295 nm and 0.18 nm, belonging to the (011) and (112) planes of ZrO2, respectively, with a mean size of 8.4 nm. Based on the above structural characterization (XRD, SEM and TEM), an intercalation compound of ZrO2 and graphite was verified to have formed in the shape of ZrO2–GICs. However, it is also worth noting that cobalt oxide attached to the surface of ZrO2–GICs was not observed in Fig. 2d–f, which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S2†). Only cobalt oxide particles with a particle diameter of 0.5–1 nm were observed in the TEM magnified image (Fig. 2g). These results indicated that cobalt oxide exists in an amorphous state (CoOx meso-size nanoclusters with a particle diameter of 0.5–1 nm).53 The element mapping of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs is shown in Fig. 2h–k, further confirming that the CoOx nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on the surface of ZrO2–GICs, and quantification of the composition of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs was carried out via ICP (Table S1†). The particle size of cobalt oxide was diminished through N2-plasma treatment (100 W, 2 min), which was attributed to the ionized N2 formed at high voltage.54

Further information regarding the chemical states of the samples was obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs (Fig. S4†) displayed signals from C 1s, Co 2p, O 1s and Zr 3d. The high-resolution C 1s, Co 2p, O 1s and Zr 3d peaks are shown in Fig. 3a–d, respectively. The C 1s spectra in Fig. 3a exhibits three distinct binding energy peaks at 284.38 eV, 285.13 eV and 288.50 eV in Co3O4/graphite and CoOx/graphite, which are attributed to C–C, C–O and CO bonds, respectively.55 It is worth noting that π–π* bonds were detected in Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs, indicating that the electrons of ZrO2, an electron donor introduced in the graphite layers,56 could be transferred to graphite to excite the π–π bonds between the graphite layers to π–π* bonds.57 In Fig. 4b, the peaks at 181.9 and 184.3 eV belong to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively.58 In Fig. 3c, the peaks at 795.3 and 780.6 eV belong to Co2+, while the peaks at binding energies of 796.8 and 782.5 eV are ascribed to Co3+.59–61 The Co2+ and Co3+ content values of the different catalysts are shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the Co2+/Co3+ ratios of CoOx/graphite (0.67) and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs (0.69) are higher than those of Co3O4/graphite (0.48) and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs (0.51). The O 1s high-resolution spectra were deconvoluted into three typical peaks at 530.1 eV, 531.7 eV and 533.2 eV, indicating typical metal–oxygen bonds (Co–O or Zr–O), low-defect oxygen coordination (Co2+–O or Zr sub-oxides) and surface-chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) species (e.g., O2−, O2−, O− and OH−), respectively.62 Oxygen vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds were introduced at the surfaces of the CoOx clusters to create charge imbalance owing to the presence of an increased Co2+ content.

The LSV data showing the CO2RR performance at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 over different catalysts in CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution (0.1 M) are shown in Fig. 4a. The LSV curve of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs displays a cathodic current onset at approximately −0.26 V vs. RHE, demonstrating that the potential onset was mainly contributed to by Co2+ (unsaturated coordination) with oxygen vacancies from the CoOx cluster.63 It was impressive that the current density continuously increased and reached 14 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V, while the catalysts without ZrO2–GICs showed low current densities (<4.4 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V), indicating their sluggish catalytic natures.
The FE values for different CO2RR products and the formate partial current densities at various potentials are presented in Fig. 4b–e; the data were obtained from the CO2RR occurring for 2 h on Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite, Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs electrodes. The CoOx/ZrO2–GICs electrode could preferentially convert CO2 to formate, exhibiting high selectivity for formate, with FE values exceeding 57.3–98.4% from −0.25 to −0.45 V (vs. RHE). Importantly, the highest FE of formate was 98.4% with a current density of 8.2 mA cm−2 at −0.35 V vs. RHE, which was much higher than the Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs electrodes. This excellent performance could be attributed to synergistic effects from the increased number of surface sites (Co2+) on the surfaces of the CoOx meso-sized nanocluster systems and the peculiar electronic structure of the π–π* bonds in ZrO2–GICs, which endowed the material with good electron transfer and fast carrier transport properties. The oxygen vacancies formed on the surfaces of the CoOx nanoclusters could promote the superposition of the d orbital electrons of Co2+ with the p orbital electrons of CO2,32 which led to the formation of Co (two-coordinate cobalt oxide) *CO2, reducing the CO2 adsorption energy barrier. For example, CoOx/graphite (−0.34 V) and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs (−0.28 V) with CoOx clusters had a more positive potential onset for the formation of formate than Co3O4/graphite (−0.51 V) and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs (−0.4 V) with the Co3O4 bulk structure. The formate FEmax values of Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs (38.3%) and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs (98.4%) with the ZrO2–GICs intercalation compounds were significantly higher than those of Co3O4/graphite (17.7%) and CoOx/graphite (20.2%). Meanwhile, a maximum formate partial current density of 5.5 mA cm−2 for CoOx/ZrO2–GICs was achieved at −0.35 V, which was higher than the other three catalysts. Furthermore, the intrinsic performances of Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite, Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs were further evidenced from TOF calculations, through determining the amount of Co2+ present (Fig. 4f). At −0.35 V, the TOF of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs for the reaction was calculated to be 6.1 ± 0.2 s−1, which was 5.8, 3.8 and 2.6 times higher than the values for Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite and Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs, respectively, clearly revealing the high intrinsic activity of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs.
In addition, the stability of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs was measured at the optimum potential over an extended period of electrolysis. The testing was conducted at a potential of −0.35 V vs. RHE, where the highest FE of 95.6% for formate was observed, operating at a total current density of 7.6 mA cm−2 with only slight attenuation over 60 h, as shown in Fig. 5a. There was no significant change in the Co2+:Co3+ ratio of CoOx/ZrO2–GIC after applying a potential of −0.35 V vs. RHE over 2 h compared with before its application (Fig. S7 and Table S2†). Moreover, no reduction or oxidation peaks from Co oxidation states were found in the CV curves (Fig. S5†), which indicated that the CoOx clusters were not reduced into Co nanoparticles. The results revealed that the CO2RR selectivity remained high during long-term electrolysis in spite of the slight degradation in the FE, which may be caused by the accumulation of formate in the electrolyte.

(b) Electrochemical impedance spectra and (c) Tafel plots for formate from Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite, Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure the charge transport properties on the electrode surfaces.64 As shown in Fig. 5b, CoOx/ZrO2–GICs presented the smallest EIS arc radius, which corresponded to the lowest electric charge transfer resistance and, subsequently, a superior reaction rate over this catalyst electrode. That was why CoOx/ZrO2–GICs showed the highest activity for the electroreduction of CO2, which corresponds with the LSV results mentioned above.
As depicted in Fig. 5c, the Tafel slope values for formate on Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite, Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs and CoOx/ZrO2–GICs were 156, 143, 138, and 126 mV dec−1, respectively, close to a value of 118 mV dec−1 in the low overpotential range, which suggests that the CO2RR mechanism on these electrodes proceeds through an initial rate-determining step where one electron is transferred to form a surface absorbed *CO2δ− species on the electrode surface.65 Moreover, combined with the distinctions relating to the formate faradaic efficiencies, the results may indicate that the barrier to the generation of the *CO2δ− intermediate was lower than the barrier to the hydrogen evolution reaction, inhibiting the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction on CoOx/ZrO2–GICs.66
Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to obtain insight into the mechanistic pathway behind the remarkably high selectivity of the CO2RR for formate on these electrocatalysts. In general, there are distinct pathways for the formation of CO and HCOOH.67 Firstly, the adsorption of CO2 on the electrode surface is initiated via electron transfer, which results in the formation of *CO2δ−(R0, slow).68 Secondly, proton transfer leads to the formation of *COOH or *OCHO via the protonation of a C atom (Co–C interaction, (R1-1)) or an O atom (Co–O interaction, (R2-1)). Finally, a second proton-coupled electron transfer leads to the observed products of CO (R1-2) or HCOOH (R2-2).69 * + CO2 + e− → *CO2δ−(R0, slow) *CO2δ− + H+ → *COOH(R1-1, fast) *COOH + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O(R1-2, fast) *CO → * + CO(R1-3) *CO2δ− + H+ → *OCHO(R2-1, fast) *OCHO + H+ + e− → *HCOOH(R2-2, fast) *HCOOH → * + HCOOH(R2-3)
As shown in Fig. 6a, the energy profiles from CoOx/ZrO2–GICs show that the formation of *CO2δ− had a much lower energy barrier (0.46 eV) than *H (0.85 eV) during the first electron transfer. However, the first proton transfer was mildly exothermic for forming *COOH (−0.1 eV) and *OCHO (−0.01 eV). Moreover, the second proton-coupled electron transfer was also mildly exothermic for forming *CO (*COOH, −0.18 eV) and *HCOOH (*OCHO, −0.06 eV), which were finally released from the catalyst as the final products. As shown in Fig. 6b–d, the energy profiles based on {311} Co3O4/graphite, CoOx/graphite and {311} Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs show that the formation of *CO2δ− had a much higher energy barrier than *H, indicating that the formation of *H was the energetically most favorable pathway resulting in the HER. It is worth noting that CO2 needed less energy (0.46 eV) to form *CO2δ− on CoOx/ZrO2–GICs than on {311} Co3O4/graphite (0.92 eV), CoOx/graphite (0.80 eV) and {311} Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs (0.84 eV). Moreover, ZrO2 acted as an electron donor in ZrO2–GICs; electrons from ZrO2 are transferred to graphite to excite the π–π bonds between the graphite layers to π–π* bonds,70 which can decrease the formation energy barrier of *OCHO on Co2+, thereby improving the selectivity for formate. The formation of *OCHO (−0.1 eV) from *CO2δ− is more exothermic compared to *COOH (−0.01 eV) on CoOx/ZrO2–GICs and {311} Co3O4/ZrO2–GICs with π–π* bonds, but the result was opposite on {311} Co3O4/graphite and CoOx/graphite. The lower *CO2δ− and *OCHO formation free energies on the CoOx/ZrO2–GICs surface indicate that the pathway involving the *OCHO intermediate becoming HCOOH was more thermodynamically favorable than H2 or CO generation, demonstrating the high selectivity for formate generation during CO2 reduction. Moreover, the DFT results confirm the speculation that the highly dispersed amorphous CoOx clusters could promote a reduction in the energy barrier of the formation of *CO2δ−, which is the rate-determining step. Moreover, they also confirmed the speculation that the π–π* bonds can help with the formation of *OCHO to improve the selectivity for formate.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we prepared nanocluster CoOx/ZrO2–GICs via the N2-plasma treatment of Co(OH)2-supported ZrO2–GICs for the CO2RR. CoOx/ZrO2–GICs could catalyze the conversion of CO2 into formate with a FEformate value of 98.4% and a current density of 8.2 mA cm−2 at −0.35 V vs. RHE, illustrating improved kinetics and respectable durability (>60 h). N2-plasma treatment could promote the formation of CoOx clusters on the ZrO2–GICs substrate. The increased Co2+ content on the CoOx cluster surfaces could promote a reduction in the energy barrier for *CO2δ− formation, which is the rate-determining step deciding the overpotential of the CO2RR to formate. Moreover, the π–π* bonds could help the formation of *OCHO to increase the selectivity for formate. Therefore, the superior performance of CoOx/ZrO2–GICs resulted mainly from the synergistic effects of the high Co2+ content and the π–π* bonds. This study provides an alternative route to the highly efficient CO2RR to formate with high selectivity.
