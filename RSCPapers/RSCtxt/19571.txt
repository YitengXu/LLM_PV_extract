    , Accepted 28th May 2018First published on 30th May 2018AbstractThe past few years have witnessed the rapid development of all-inorganic metal halide perovskites in optoelectronics. However, the solution-processed perovskite nanocrystal film suffers from low carrier extraction and transport efficiencies because of a large number of grain boundaries. Here, we demonstrate that an enhanced photoresponse is obtained by constructing a perovskite/hole-conducting layer heterostructure photoconductor, resulting from the interfacial charge transfer from perovskite to conducting layer. Furthermore, we develop a trap-assisted charge transfer mechanism to explain the larger photocurrent of the CuSCN heterostructure photoconductor than that of the NiO heterostructure. A saturated photocurrent of 40 μA and a responsivity of 11 A W−1 at 1 V are obtained for the flexible CsPbBr3 nanosheet/CuSCN heterostructure. Excellent folding stability and long-term air-stability highlight the promising flexible photodetector applications.
Introduction
Recently, metal halide perovskites have attracted a wide range of research interest in the field of solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors because of their high charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length and high light absorptivity in the UV-vis range.1–6 Among them, the metal halide perovskite nanocrystals with different morphologies including 0D quantum dots (QDs), nanocubes (NCs), 1D nanowires (NWs) and 2D nanosheets (NSs) have shown their excellent luminous properties including a narrow photoluminescence (PL) emission line width and a high PL quantum yield (PLQY).7–9 At the same time, metal halide perovskite nanocrystals have also been employed to guarantee phase-stable CsPbI3 solar cells because nanocrystals with a large surface–volume ratio can suppress their yellow phase generation.10,11 Moreover, all-inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3 has shown a high mobility of 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1,12 and much improved air and thermal stabilities compared with its counterpart MAPbBr3,13 raising people's intense attention regarding highly stable optoelectrical devices with high performance.
For photodetector applications, Song et al. reported a flexible CsPbBr3 NS photodetector with a high responsivity of 0.25 A W−1 and a fast response speed of 0.019 ms.4 Our group reported a quantum-confined CsPbBr3 NS photodetector with an enhanced absorption cross section and a high carrier mobility of 77.9 cm2 V−1 s−1, and explored their exciton dissociation mechanism.5 Ultrahigh responsivity has been pursued to meet the requirement of ultrasensitive photodetection. A promising strategy is constructing a perovskite/conducting layer heterostructure, where light is efficiently absorbed by the perovskite layer while one kind of photogenerated carrier can be transferred into a conducting layer, and high gain can be obtained from one carrier that recirculates many times within the lifetimes of the opposite charges. Although ultrahigh responsivity has been obtained for graphene/perovskite heterostructures,14–16 the large dark current contributing to a high shot noise will set a high noise floor for photodetectors.17 Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials including MoS2,18 WS219 and WSe220,21 have also been reported as the conducting layers, but a high responsivity can only be achieved at a high applied voltage because atomically thin TMD has a low conductivity. Wide bandgap electron-transporting materials such as ZnO,22 TiO223 and PDPP3T24 and hole-conducting materials such as CuSCN25–28 and NiO29–32 have been widely demonstrated to have excellent carrier extraction ability in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, electron- or hole-conducting materials with high carrier conductivity and favorable band alignment are ideal conducting layers for constructing perovskite heterostructures. However, the charge transfer rates vary widely for various perovskite/conducting layer heterostructures, and effective evaluation of these heterostructures is generally lacking. Besides, flexible perovskite photodetectors have become a research hotspot recently owing to their potential applications in portable consumer electronics and wearable optoelectronics.33–35 Hence, once efficient heterostructures are confirmed to have superior performances, it is quite necessary to further evaluate their mechanical folding stability by constructing flexible devices.
In this work, CuSCN and NiO as efficient conducting layers were employed to extract the holes generated in the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer. We evaluated the photoresponse of CsPbBr3 NCs/CuSCN, CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN, CsPbBr3 NCs/NiO and CsPbBr3 NSs/NiO heterostructure photodetectors, and the corresponding charge transfer rates were calculated to distinguish various heterostructures, which were explained by a proposed mechanism of trap-assisted charge transfer at the heterostructure interface. Besides, both the perovskite film thickness and electrode gap width were studied for their effect on photoresponse performance. Finally, flexible photodetectors were fabricated to test the mechanical folding stability.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the schematic structure of the perovskite/hole-conducting layer heterostructure photodetector. A conducting layer was deposited under the perovskite film based on two factors. First, the bottom conducting layer can be employed as the transporting path of only one kind of carrier after the photogenerated carriers are separated at the interface of the heterostructure. Halide perovskite films have similar electron and hole mobilities.36 In contrast, CuSCN and NiO only have a high hole-conducting ability and electron–hole recombination can be prevented effectively in the conducting layer. Second, the perovskite nanocrystal film is sensitive to lots of solvents such as water, making it difficult to prepare the conducting layer by the solution-processed method, but the conducting layer film is quite environmentally stable. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the sizes of CsPbBr3 NCs are 10 nm, while CsPbBr3 NSs have a lateral dimension of 300 nm and a thickness of 3 nm. The CsPbBr3 NSs have a more obvious exciton absorption peak than the NCs, and the NSs have a dominant PL peak at 494 nm while the NCs have a PL peak at 515 nm, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which is attributed to the stronger quantum size effect for NSs than NCs. Besides, a small peak at 520 nm for the NSs results from a small amount of thick NSs without the quantum size effect. We can see the compact CsPbBr3 NC film deposited on the CuSCN film (Fig. 1b), and the NS film has a relatively high surface roughness because of the large lateral dimension of the NSs but it is still compact without any discontinuities (Fig. 1c). On the basis of cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 1d and e, we can confirm the typical thicknesses of the CsPbBr3 NC and NS films, which are used to determine the photoresponse performances of the heterostructure photodetectors with different perovskite layer thicknesses.

For heterostructure photodetectors, the bottom conducting layer plays a role in transporting one kind of carrier, and the top perovskite film as the photosensitive layer provides photogenerated carriers, so both the thickness and the interface of the two layers are crucial to obtain a large photocurrent. We compared the IV characteristics of CsPbBr3 NC and NS films in Fig. 2a. We can see a higher photocurrent for the NS film photodetector because the NS film has a higher mobility resulting from fewer nanocrystal boundaries. The photoresponse performances of heterostructure photoconductors are shown in Fig. 2b and c. First, the CuSCN film has a higher dark current of 0.3 μA at 1 V than the NiO film with a dark current of 0.03 nA at 10 V, indicating its higher conductivity. The CuSCN film also shows a small photoresponse under 365 nm irradiation while the NiO film does not show any photoresponse. Second, compared with only conducting layers or perovskite films, an enhanced dark current and photocurrent are observed for heterostructure photoconductors, indicating the charge injection from perovskite layer to conducting layer. At the same time, the CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN photodetector has a far higher photocurrent of 10 μA at 1 V than the CsPbBr3 NSs/NiO film with a photocurrent of 0.5 μA at 10 V. Similar results are found for the CsPbBr3 NC heterostructure, and the reason for the higher currents for CuSCN-based films will be discussed later. Fig. 2d summarizes the relationship between the photocurrent and thickness of the perovskite layer. Generally, the photocurrents increase linearly with increased perovskite thickness, which can be easily understood as an increased photogenerated carrier number. The on/off switching behaviors with multiple cycles in Fig. 2e and f demonstrate the good reproducibility of these heterostructure photoconductors. The rise and decay times are defined as 63% and 37% of the maximum photocurrent, respectively.37 The CuSCN heterostructure photoconductors have longer rise and decay times than that of NiO heterostructure photoconductors because the ohmic contact has a slower response speed than that of the Schottky contact. The Schottky barrier area has a strong local electric field under a large applied voltage, resulting in the fast separation of photon-generated carriers.37,38 As shown in Fig. 3, the CuSCN heterostructure has linear symmetrical IV curves, indicating the ohmic contact between the heterostructure film and Au electrodes. In contrast, the not obviously nonlinear IV curves of the NiO heterostructure result from the symmetry of the Schottky contact. Later, we will discuss the detailed heterostructure band structure. All together, the above results demonstrate that the photocurrent and on/off ratio of CsPbBr3 film photoconductors are improved by introducing a conducting layer, but significant differences between the two conducting layers are also observed. Another parameter, the electrode gap width, is also investigated in Fig. 3. The four pairs of electrodes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The photocurrents of the heterostructure photoconductors increase monotonously with the decreased electrode gap width, resulting from the higher carrier collection efficiency of the smaller gap width.

The Au electrode gap widths were 10 μm. The light illumination was 365 nm LED with an intensity of 11 mW cm−2. The applied bias voltages for CuSCN-based film photodetectors were 1 V, and they were 10 V for NiO-based film photodetectors. 
 Fig. 3  IV curves of (a) CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN and (b) CsPbBr3 NSs/NiO film photodetectors with various Au electrode gap widths. The thicknesses of CsPbBr3 NS films were 230 nm. The uniform perovskite film thickness can be guaranteed because four pairs of electrodes were fabricated on one chip. 
In order to understand the photoresponse mechanism of the heterostructure photoconductors, the transmittance and PL spectra were characterized. The CsPbBr3 NC-based films show an exciton absorption peak at 505 nm while that for the CsPbBr3 NS-based films is at 520 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite in accord with those of the NSs and NCs in solution in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Furthermore, the transmittance of the heterostructure films is lower than that of the perovskite films, resulting from the absorption of the conducting layer with a wide band gap. NiO-based heterostructure films have the lowest transmittance because high light scattering is observed for the NiO film, indicating its higher roughness than the CuSCN film, which is in accord with the AFM results in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The steady-state PL spectra in Fig. 4b provide powerful evidence for charge transfer at the heterostructure interface. The PL spectra of NS films have a dominant peak at 523 nm, and the disappearing short-wavelength PL peak in solution is a result of enhanced NS coupling.5 In addition, the PL intensities of CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN and CsPbBr3 NCs/CuSCN are quenched by nearly 99% and 95% respectively, which are far larger values than those of CsPbBr3 NSs/NiO (60%) and CsPbBr3 NCs/NiO (40%). The higher quenching efficiency for the CuSCN film than the NiO film is in accord with Subbiah et al.'s report.39 Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra in Fig. 4c were used to identify the charge transfer rate at the heterostructure interface. According to eqn (1), ket could be calculated based on the fitted PL decay parameters, which are summarized in Table 1. (1)where ket is the charge transfer rate, and τheterostructure and τsingle are the exciton lifetimes of the heterostructure film and single CsPbBr3 nanocrystal film, respectively. We can see the highest charge transfer rate of 3.52 ns−1 for the CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN heterostructure film, which is also far higher than our previous reported value of 0.15 ns−1 for the CsPbBr3 NS film.5 The highest charge transfer and PL quenching are powerful pieces of evidence to illustrate the most efficient charge transfer from the CsPbBr3 NS film to CuSCN film, which can also explain its maximum photocurrent in Fig. 2b. Fig. 4d describes the energy band structure of the formed heterostructures, and the energy band values come from ref. 40. The ideal energy bands of CuSCN and NiO are quite similar. The photogenerated excitons can be separated at the heterostructure interface, and holes can be transferred from the perovskite to the p-type conducting layer while electrons are confined in the perovskite layer. Then, high gain is obtained based on the fact that the holes can recirculate many times before recombination. Yan's group successfully fabricated perovskite photoconductor phototransistors with a higher gain based on a similar mechanism.41,42 However, there is a small difference between the CsPbBr3/CuSCN and CsPbBr3/NiO heterostructures because the uncertain number of defect states resulting from solution-processed films can cause a deviation from the ideal heterostructure. Here, we developed a mechanism of trap-assisted charge transfer at the heterostructure interface to explain this difference. CuSCN has little been reported with a trap energy level because the stoichiometric excess SCN− cannot be obtained easily for CuSCN without any halogen treatment.28 A SCN− acceptor level was only reported based on a weak trap PL peak intensity by Perera et al.43 The deep energy level will not trap photogenerated holes, resulting in a large photocurrent in perovskite/CuSCN heterostructure photoconductors. In contrast, the NiO nanocrystal film has been widely reported with Ni4+ as a shallow trap and Ni3+ as a deep trap. The injected holes can be trapped in the shallow trap and deep trap within 2.9 and 126 ps, respectively.44 Accordingly, when the majority of holes relax into a deep trap quickly, there are only a minority of progenerated holes to be extracted, which can explain the low photocurrent even in a high operating voltage. Under ideal conditions, the p-type semiconductor is thought to form an ohmic contact with the Au electrode. However, the changed contact type for NiO is related to the trap state at the interfaces.

Based on the optimized device parameters from rigid photodetectors, we fabricated the flexible CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN heterostructure photoconductor and evaluated its photoresponse performance and bending and air-storage stabilities. From the photoresponse linearity in Fig. 5a, we can observe an increased photocurrent with an increasing incidence intensity, and the saturated photocurrent of 40 μA is obtained. Interestingly, the responsivity almost remained constant at about 11 A W−1 with the incidence intensity increased from 1.4 to 64 mW cm−2, indicating its independence from the incidence intensity. A similar result was reported for the ZnO–Ag NW heterostructure photoconductor.45 The specific reason is unclear, but it may be related to the high charge transfer efficiency of the heterostructure. The specific detectivity D* is an important parameter to evaluate the noise level of photodetectors, which can be calculated by eqn (2) assuming the shot noise as the dominant noise.37,46 D* = R/(2qJd)1/2(2)where R is the responsivity, q is the electronic charge, and Jd is the dark current density. We estimate the D* of 1.8 × 1011 Jones, which is larger than that of the reported single CsPbBr3 NC photoconductor of 1.6 × 109 Jones.46 The linearity of 55 dB is small because a heterostructure photoconductor with a large dark current cannot respond to a low irradiance intensity. The performance comparison of the photoconductor detector is summarized in Table 2. Our heterostructure photoconductor has a smaller responsivity than the graphene/perovskite photoconductor but it is larger than those of single perovskite and perovskite heterostructures with MoS2, ZnO, Au and PDPP3T photoconductors. However, there is an opposite trend in terms of detectivity. The small detectivity of graphene/perovskite results from its relatively large dark current of several mA. Therefore, our perovskite heterostructure photoconductors show their significant advantage when both responsivity and detectivity are considered. The wavelength-dependent photocurrent and responsivity in Fig. 5b were used to evaluate the light detection capability at different wavelengths. We can observe that the highest photocurrent and responsivity are located at 470 nm illumination, which is different from the previously reported 525 nm for CsPbBr3 NSs.5 According to the trade-off theory, the carriers generated by absorbing higher energy photons have a larger probability of contributing to the photocurrent, but high energy light has a small photon number under a constant power, compromising the increase of photocurrent.50 For heterostructures, this trade-off is reached at a higher photon energy because of its higher charge transfer rate. Besides, the photocurrent and responsivity at 5 V are almost five times those at 1 V, indicating its good operating bias voltage linearity. The electrical stability under bending conditions and folding endurance are important factors for flexible photoelectronic devices. Fig. 5c shows that the photocurrent of the flexible photodetector remains almost unaffected when the flexible device undergoes a bending cycle (bent from 0° to 150° and then recovered to 0°), indicating the excellent electrical stability. Besides this, Fig. 5d displays that the flexible photodetector still retains 98% of the initial photocurrent even after 5000 bending cycles, and so a wonderful folding endurance results from the fact that the bending stress can be fully released through the CsPbBr3 NS films. Finally, the air storage stability was evaluated by monitoring photocurrent variation with days. We found a slightly decreased photocurrent after one week, and then it retains 95% of the initial value after two months (Fig. 5d), illustrating its superior long-term air stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a heterostructure photoconductor detector by employing the wide bandgap inorganic hole-conducting material CuSCN and NiO as the conducting layer and CsPbBr3 NSs and NCs as the photosensitive layer. Owing to the interfacial charge transfer from perovskite to conducting layer, the heterostructure photoconductors have an enhanced photocurrent. Surprisingly, the photocurrent of the CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN heterostructure photoconductor at 1 V is 200 times that of the CsPbBr3 NSs/NiO heterostructure at 10 V. This significant difference can be explained on the basis of the trap-assisted charge transfer mechanism, which is supported by a higher PL quenching efficiency of the CuSCN heterostructure. In addition, the photocurrents increase with the increased perovskite thickness and decreased electrode gap width. The flexible CsPbBr3 NSs/CuSCN heterostructure photodetector exhibits a saturated photocurrent of 40 μA and responsivity of 11 A W−1 at 1 V. Excellent electrical stability under bending conditions and folding endurance and superior long-term air storage stability are demonstrated, suggesting the promising flexible photodetector applications of the perovskite/conducting layer heterostructure photoconductor.
Experimental details
Fabrication of a conducting layer
Four pairs of parallel Au electrodes were prepared on a Si/SiO2 substrate by the photolithography technique as chips. The gap widths were 10, 20, 30 and 45 μm, and their lengths were 0.7 mm. Before the preparation of hole-conducting layers, the chips were cleaned carefully and treated with Ar-plasma to obtain the hydrophilic surface. Next, CuSCN films were prepared on the chips by spin-coating CuSCN di-n-propyl sulfide solution with a concentration of 19 mg mL−1 at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by a 120 °C annealing for 10 min. NiO films were prepared on the chips by spin-coating the NiO nanocrystal water solution with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by a 150 °C annealing for 30 min. The low annealing temperature allowed for the flexible photodetector application.
Fabrication of heterostructure photoconductor detector
Both CsPbBr3 NC and NS films were deposited on the hole-conducting layer CuSCN and NiO films to construct the heterostructure photoconductor detector. For the synthesis and purification methods of CsPbBr3 NCs and NSs, please refer to our previous reports.5 CsPbBr3 NC or NS hexane solutions with concentrations of 5 mg mL−1 were spin-coated on chips at 2000 rpm for 30 s followed by a 90 °C annealing for 10 min, and films with different thicknesses were achieved by repeated spin-coating. Flexible photodetectors were fabricated on patterned ITO/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, and the same technique parameters were used.
Characterization
Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was undertaken with a FEI Quatan 250 FEG, and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 operating at 200 kV. Optical transmittance data were acquired with a Jasco V-570 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded with a PTI QM 400 using a Xe lamp with an excitation wavelength of 345 nm, and TRPL spectra were acquired using a pulse white laser with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and frequency of 2 MHz. IV and time-dependent photoresponse measurements were recorded by a Keithley 2400 source meter. The samples were illuminated using 365 nm LED sources. The photoresponse linearity was obtained by changing the LED illumination intensity, and a standard photodetector (Thorlabs, PM-100A) was used to quantify the irradiance intensity. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10, Zolix), and the wavelength-dependent responsivity spectra were calculated from the expression responsivity = IPCE × λ/1240. Flexible photodetector measurements were conducted on a home-made bending machine with a frequency of 1 Hz. All photoresponse measurements were performed in air.
