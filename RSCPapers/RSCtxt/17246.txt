    , Accepted 11th December 2013First published on 12th December 2013AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells as “low-cost” alternatives to traditional silicon-based solar cells are promising for clean electricity generation. The key processes in practical devices, such as generation, collection, and recombination of charges that greatly affect the cell performance, occur at interfaces and are influenced by properties of the interfacial materials. In this article, we summarize recent progress of materials and technologies associated with the functionalization of interfaces to significantly improve DSCs' performance, emphasizing greatly the most important semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface where major energy conversion and charge transfer processes occur. Finally, the prospects of interfacial engineering for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells are highlighted in the outlook.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, photovoltaic technologies that directly convert clean and renewable solar energy into electrical power as solutions for the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems induced by using fossil fuels have advanced rapidly. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) fabricated inexpensively from environmentally friendly materials provide a promising technology for low-cost and potentially highly efficient solar energy conversion.1–7 A typical DSC consists of a dyed nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode based on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, a platinum (Pt) counter electrode, and an electrolyte solution containing an I3−/I− redox couple between the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 1. The main operation principles of DSCs are as follows: under light illumination, the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film are excited and the photo-generated electrons in the dyes are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, and then transport through the film to the TCO substrate. In the meantime, the dyes are regenerated by the reduction of oxidized dyes by I− ions from the electrolyte. The I− ions are then further regenerated at the counter electrode via the reduction of I3− ions. Finally the circuit is completed through the external load, as shown in Fig. 2. The regenerative processes in DSCs allow the generation of electricity from solar light without any permanent chemical transformation.

A very special feature of DSCs compared with other traditional solid-state junction solar cells is that the light absorption, electron transport, and hole transport processes are performed by different materials within the cell. For example, solar light is harvested by dyes, electrons are transferred within the TiO2 film, and the hole transport processes occur in the electrolyte. This enables us to develop a variety of component materials, with great consideration of the matching of energy-levels at interfaces. If the component materials are well-matched at interfaces, the DSC as a whole system will show superior functionality surpassing the sum of the properties of the individual component materials.2 As a matter of fact, some of the interfaces in DSCs play a crucial role in determining the cell performance. For example, charge separation, the most important photon-to-electricity conversion process, takes place at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, and dye regeneration, another very important process, also occurs at this interface. These two processes are favourable for the overall energy conversion. Concurrently, the recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 film with the oxidized dye or with I3− also occurs at this interface, which is unfavourable to the photon-to-electricity conversion. Thus, the cell performance would be greatly improved by efficiently propelling the favourable processes and suppressing the unfavourable energy loss by suitable modification of the interfaces in DSCs.
Since O’Regan and Grätzel reported their pioneering work in 1991,8 great effort has been paid to develop component materials for DSCs and investigate the underlying mechanisms.1,2,6,7 In recent years, much progress has been achieved and the efficiencies of about 12% for small area DSCs have been obtained under standard AM 1.5 under laboratory conditions.9–11 However, the improvement of conversion efficiency remains less remarkable compared with the large amount of research work devoted.2,5,7 For further improvement of the conversion efficiency and cell performance of DSCs, more efficient research work should be carried out as we have discussed elsewhere.5 In this article, with the purpose of illustrating more research pathways to improve the efficiency of DSCs efficiently, we summarize recent progress of the materials and technologies associated with interfacial engineering other than solely focusing on developing new component materials for DSCs. The discussion includes modification of the TCO/TiO2 interface and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface that significantly affect the final power conversion efficiency. Focus is emphasized on the most important interface, which is the semiconductor (TiO2)/dye/electrolyte interface. Engineering of this interface by surface coating of an ultrathin layer, uploading dyes with coadsorbers, and using additives in the electrolyte is reviewed in detail. We hope that great research attention will focus more on the interfacial engineering of DSCs to facilitate the future commercialization of this type of solar cell.
2. Modification of TCO/TiO2 interface
The interface of TCO/TiO2 plays an important role in the electron collection in DSCs. There are two competitive processes taking place at this interface: the transport of photo-generated electrons to the collecting electrode and the back reaction of collected electrons with oxidized species in the electrolyte. Effectively manipulating this interface to better facilitate electron transport and the repression of electron recombination could further improve the cell performance. Pre-treatment of the TCO substrate by forming a thin compact layer before printing the nanocrystalline TiO2 film was found to not only increase electron collection through improvement of adhesion between the TiO2 and the TCO substrate but also decrease electron recombination by effectively preventing contact between the collecting substrate and the electrolyte.12,13
Fabrication methods of the compact layer included sputter deposition,14–16 dip-coating,17,18 chemical vapour deposition,19 and spray pyrolysis.20 Hydrolyzing TiCl4 aqueous solution, in particular, has been widely utilized in recent research.15,20,21 The TiCl4 treatment of FTO conducting glass resulted in a significant decrease of the dark current, as shown in Fig. 3, indicating the effectiveness of TiCl4 treatment in reducing direct contact of I3− in the electrolyte with the exposed area of FTO.21 Water-soluble peroxotitanium acid (PTA) was also applied to the preparation of a transparent and compact thin layer of TiO2. The gradient layer formed at the FTO/TiO2 interface effectively prevented direct contact of the electrolytes with FTO and thus improved the JSC of the cell. Finally, the cell efficiency significantly improved from 4.2% to 5.6% in the presence of the compact layer.22 SnO2 thin films as the blocking layers at the FTO/TiO2 interface were also investigated.23 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed a clear difference in morphology after deposition of SnO2 onto the FTO substrate (Fig. 4a–c). The root mean square (rms) roughness of FTO with a 120 nm-thick SnO2 film showed an increase of about 15% compared with that of bare FTO, and the transmittance remained unchanged (Fig. 4d). The cell efficiency was improved by about 12.1% by coating a 120 nm-thick SnO2 compact layer onto the FTO substrate.

Recently, surface modification of FTO by graphene has been reported as a promising alternative method to the conventional hydrolyzing TiCl4 treatment.24 The surface functionalization of FTO by graphene was based on the fact that the work function of graphene (−4.4 eV vs. vacuum) is more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.2 eV vs. vacuum) and quite similar to that of FTO and thus allowing electron transfer from TiO2 to graphene but not in the reverse direction. The surface functionalization of FTO by graphene behaved as an extended collection electrode to enhance the electron collection efficiency and simultaneously improved the charge-transport rate in the current collector (Fig. 5). The efficiency of the cell was remarkably increased by using graphene to functionalize the interface of FTO/TiO2.

Especially, in solid state DSCs or quasi-solid state DSCs, the TCO/TiO2 interface plays an important role in the electron collection and recombination due to the relatively large pore size of the TiO2 film for a high viscosity electrolyte. Introduction of a submicrometer thick interfacial layer between the TCO substrate and a micron-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film is an effective way to enhance attachment and to suppress electron recombination. A mesoporous TiO2 interfacial layer templated by a poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM) graft copolymer was deposited with high uniformity and reproducibly applied in solid state DSCs.25–27 This interfacial layer with better adhesion on the TCO layer resulted in an enhancement of electron transfer and led to increases in all photovoltaic parameters like short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF).
3. Modification of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface
In a DSC, several very important processes occur at the interface between the dye uploaded TiO2 film and the electrolyte, including the favourable processes of electron injection from excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 and the regeneration of dyes, and the unfavourable process of the back reaction of injected electrons in the TiO2 film with I3− in the electrolyte or oxidized dyes. Increasing the adsorption amount of active dyes, arraying the dyes orderly, or stronger bonding between dyes and TiO2 will benefit the electron injection process and thus lead to an increase in the JSC of the DSCs. On the other hand, sufficient passivation of the uncovered surface of TiO2 can suppress the charge recombination process between electrons in the TiO2 with I3− in the electrolyte and result in the improvement of VOC. Therefore, effective modification of this interface can greatly improve the energy conversion efficiency of DSCs.
3.1. Surface coating
As one of the essential components of DSCs, the nanocrystalline TiO2 film with an interconnected mesoporous structure is responsible for the increase of the adsorption amount of dye molecules and the transport of electrons and diffusion of the electrolyte. Surface treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 film to form an extra thin layer is commonly used to improve the performance of DSCs. The effect of surface coating has been supposed to have several functions such as decreasing the surface trap states of the electrode,28 enhancing interparticle connections and facilitating electron transport in the electrode,29–31 increasing the surface area,32 enhancing dye attachment on the electrode surface,33 enhancing charge separation efficiency,34 and most importantly suppressing the electron recombination with oxide species in the electrolyte.35,36
One of the well-known surface coating methods is TiCl4 post-treatment of the TiO2 film, which is always carried out by means of chemical bath deposition.15,21 The freshly sintered TiO2 film was immersed into a TiCl4 solution for about 30 min at 70 °C, and after washing with demineralized water and drying, the film was sintered again. After TiCl4 treatment, a thin TiO2 layer was formed on the mesoporous TiO2 film surface. The TiCl4 treatment can improve the cell performance, especially through the enhancement of photocurrent. An increase in the photocurrent by 10%–30%, depending on the quality of the original TiO2 film, is noticeable.
Surface modification of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film using wider bandgap metal oxides or insulators is one of the most effective methods that are widely used to increase the VOC of the DSCs. The metal oxides form an extra thin film on the TiO2 surface serving as a blocking layer to suppress the backward electron transfer processes thereby increasing the VOC of the cell. Nevertheless, a big challenge of this method is that a thicker or inhomogeneous metal oxide film can potentially decrease the electron injection yield from the excited state of dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. Hence, a suitable choice of metal oxide materials and careful control of the deposition thickness are critical for the effective application of this method. A typical wide band gap oxide, MgO, was often employed to form a core–shell structured TiO2 or SnO2 photoanode. The MgO shell can retard the recombination of injected electrons in the semiconductor and holes in the electrolyte. For instance in a black dye sensitized solar cell, the VOC was increased from 0.70 V to 0.73 V and the conversion efficiency was improved from 10.4% to 10.8% by employing the MgO shell on the TiO2 film.37 A greater increase in cell performance due to surface coating of the MgO thin film was observed in SnO2 based DSCs than in TiO2 based DSCs with significant improvement of VOC as well as JSC in comparison to the uncoated cell. SnO2 based DSCs usually have a very low VOC of 0.32–0.37 V and efficiencies of about 1%. The VOC and efficiencies were increased to 0.65–0.70 V and about 6.5%, respectively, after coating the SnO2 with the MgO thin film.38 Ultrathin Al2O3 was frequently applied in SnO2 based DSCs, while the usage is less common in highly efficient DSCs based on TiO2. Al2O3 could repress the electron recombination with an increase of the thickness, however, the quantum efficiency for electron injection was decreased and led to lower JSC.39 In addition, other metal oxides like Nb2O540 and ZrO217 deposited on the TiO2 film were also investigated and the VOC of the cell was increased to a different extent.
Efficient surface passivation of the TiO2 film can also be obtained using carbonates. Electronic-insulating coating of CaCO3 on the TiO2 film was found to give longer electron lifetimes and increase both VOC and JSC.41 The significant increase in JSC was mainly attributed to the remarkable increase of dye adsorption resulting from the more basic surface of CaCO3 than TiO2, while the increase in VOC was attributed to the efficient suppression of charge recombination by the insulating coating of CaCO3. In situ passivation of the TiO2 films by adding CO2, Li2CO3, or K2CO3 to the electrolyte also leads to deposition of isolating carbonates on the dye uploaded TiO2 electrode and improved the solar cell performance.42
Besides the above mentioned methods, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method by which an ultrathin layer is grown by self-limiting on a surface at the atomic level has also been applied for passivation of the electrode surface of DSCs. Chandiran et al. deposited a highly insulating gallium oxide (Ga2O3, −2.95 eV vs. vacuum) by ALD on the surface of the TiO2 film as a tunnelling barrier layer (Fig. 6), which significantly reduced the electron recombination and led to a new record VOC of 1.1 V.43 The JSC and FF were also increased in the meantime, owing to a good balance between the electron injection and electron recombination processes. Another good example is the ALD TiO2 ultrathin layer on the surface of ZnO nanocrystallite aggregates acting as the photoanode for DSCs.44 The introduction of the TiO2 ultrathin layer improved the efficiency from 5.2% to 6.3% accompanied by the increase of both VOC and FF of the cell as a result of sufficient suppression of surface charge recombination without impairing the photocurrent density. Besides the increase of VOC, the ALD Al2O3 thin layer on the photoanode was also reported to improve the stability of the film under aqueous conditions.45 Both the stability and VOC of the cell improved with the increase of ALD cycles, however, with the cost of lowering electron injection yields. A balance between these effects should be considered to optimize the cell performance. Although in some cases the suppression of the electron injection process by the ultrathin layer could be controlled to a negligible extent, deposition of an ultrathin layer prior to dye adsorption is still a barrier for electron injection. Applying ALD layers after the dye adsorption becomes a good solution for this problem. An insulating and transparent layer of silica (SiO2) was successfully deposited on the TiO2 surface after dye uploading.46 The silica layer could grow only on the bare TiO2 surface and did not cover the dye molecules. DSCs incorporating these selective and self-aligned SiO2 thin coatings achieved a 36% increase in efficiency with respect to the uncoated cells.

3.2. Coadsorbent
Generally, coadsorbents in DSCs are referred to as the compounds that are added during the dye uploading process and adsorbed together with the dye on the surface of mesoporous semiconductors. Coadsorbents are typically transparent organic compounds with very low light absorption. Usually they are added in a much higher concentration in comparison with the dye sensitizer and bind weakly on the TiO2 surface so that the dye can replace them upon adsorption. They play an important role in organizing and orienting the adsorbed dye molecules by occupying spaces between dye molecules and diminishing aggregation between dye molecules and interaction between dye and the TiO2 surface.47,48 Organic acids containing carboxylate or phosphonate groups have been widely used as coadsorbents for DSCs. The structures of several typically used and newly developed coadsorbents are listed in Fig. 7. They are usually selected empirically to improve the VOC and/or JSC according to the different dyes used in DSCs. Although the mechanism is still not well understood, the reasons for their beneficial effect are generally ascribed as follows: (1) reduction of the aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 surface; (2) passivation of the TiO2 surface repressing injected electrons recombination with I3− in the electrolyte; (3) modulation of the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2 thereby affecting the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 film.
 Fig. 7  Several typically used and newly developed coadsorbents for DSCs. 
Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is frequently used as a coadsorbent for repressing dye aggregation in DSCs. From early 1993, DCA has been investigated as a coadsorbent for porphyrins and revealed that with increasing concentration of DCA in the dye solution, VOC of the cells was improved.48 Consequent studies showed that the coadsorption of DCA improved both photocurrent and photovoltage for many kinds of dye based DSCs. The dyes include ruthenium pyridyl, coumarin, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, naphthalocyanine, etc. The improvement of VOC was ascribed to the repression of electron recombination with I3− ions in the electrolyte. The increase of photocurrent might arise from the suppression of aggregation of dye molecules.49–51 Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is another important coadsorbent in DSCs, which is used mainly to prevent the formation of dye aggregates at a higher photocurrent.48,52–54 In some cases, the use of CDCA also led to a rise in the photovoltage, which could be ascribed to the negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge.55 It was also found that in some Ru–phthalocyanine based DSCs, the geometry of the attached dyes was affected by CDCA.56 These results suggested that the effect of CDCA on the performance of DSCs is more complex than we previously assumed, thus exhaustive studies based on different types of dyes are recommended.
Recently, substituted benzoic acid derivatives were also developed as alternatives to the conventional coadsorbents such as DCA or CDCA for organic dyes and Ru–pyridyl dyes. 4-{3,6-Bis[4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl]-9H-carbazol-9-yl}benzoic acid (HC-A)57 and 4-(bis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amino)benzoic acid (HC-Acid)58 were successfully adopted in NKX2677 dye sensitized solar cells. These hole-conducting acids as coadsorbents demonstrated multiple functions: harvesting short-wavelength light as a light absorbing dye, preventing the π–π stacked aggregates of the organic dyes, and hole-conduction. Another substituted benzoic acid derivative 3,4,5-tris(dodecyloxy) benzoic acid (DOBA) with three hydrocarbon chains was capable of forming a denser monolayer with the sensitizer dye and effectively prevented charge recombination.59 Moreover, DOBA induced a lower population of density-of-states (DOS) in the surface of TiO2, shifting the position of the conduction band toward negative values, and resulted in a higher VOC of the cell. In addition, other organic compounds with carboxylate as the anchoring group on TiO2 such as 4-guanidinobutyric acid (GBA),60,61 stearic acid (SA),61 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA),61 pivalic acid (PVA),62 hexadecylmalonic acid,63 1-decylphosphonic acid,64 ω-guanidinoalkyl acid,65 and citric acid66 were also investigated as coadsorbents for dye uploading and showed potential for use in high efficiency DSCs.
Phosphonate compounds that bind to the surface of TiO2 much stronger than aliphatic carboxylic acids have also been extensively investigated as coadsorbents in DSCs.67 One of the first representatives of this class of coadsorbents is dineohexyl phosphinic acid (DINHOP)68 which has double chain amphiphiles in the molecular structure, as shown in Fig. 6. The two neohexyl substituents attached to the phosphinic acid serve both as insulators and hydrophobic umbrellas protecting the TiO2 surface from being approached by water and the oxidized species of the electrolyte, e.g. triiodide ions. This effectively reduced the reaction rate of recombination of injected electrons in the conduction band with triiodide ions and resulted in an enhancement of the photovoltage of the DSC. The device with the mixed Z907 Na/DINHOP monolayer also showed outstanding stability under prolonged light soaking at 60 °C which is critical for outdoor applications of the DSCs, suggesting the potential of this kind of coadsorbent for the long term stability of DSCs. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) investigated the surface molecular structure of a p-dimethylaniline triphenylamine based organic dye, D29 coadsorbed with DINHOP, another phosphonate containing coadsorbent decylphosphonic acid (DPA), and CDCA on TiO2.69 The results clearly indicated that DPA bound more efficiently to the TiO2 surface in comparison to DINHOP. DPA and DINHOP molecules were found to exchange easily with D29 dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. Although the concentration of the D29 dye was significantly reduced in the presence of DPA and DINHOP coadsorbents, the JSC of the cells using both increased without reduction of VOC with respect to the system with no coadsorbents, implying a higher number of injecting dyes being present on the surface. Besides the application of alkyl substituted phosphinic acids, aryl-substituted phosphinic acids were also designed and investigated in ruthenium dye based DSCs. Diphenylphosphinic acid (DPPA) with two phenyls in the molecular structure was employed as a coadsorbent for the N719 dye and the total energy conversion efficiency was significantly improved.70 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) results illustrated that the increase of JSC came partly from the effects of the inhibited recombination. On the other hand, different ratios of N719 to DPPA in the DSCs were found to shift the TiO2 conduction band toward different directions, which in turn affected the JSC and VOC of the cells. Specifically, when the ratio of N719 to DPPA was 2:1 and 1:1 the conduction band of the TiO2 film was positively shifted, while it was negatively shifted when the ratio was 4:1. The different shift directions of the TiO2 conduction band were further confirmed by EIS analysis.
Recently, coadsorbents with multifunctions such as the increase of VOC and JSC accompanied by the improvement of the stability of the DSCs in the meantime have also been pursued. A multifunctional methoxy-terminated oligomeric poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain containing a carboxylic acid at one chain end (Mw: 2k) (mPEG-succinic acid) was employed as a coadsorbent for further improvement of efficiency as well as long-term stability. Besides the observed typical functions of common coadsorbents for effective suppression of electron recombination and negative shift of the band edge of TiO2, the novel oligomeric mPEG-succinic acid coadsorbent provided additional benefits because of its long chains and high oxygen content.71 The photovoltaic performance was further improved when oligomeric mPEG-succinic acid coadsorbents were used in the presence of common additives such as LiI, tBP, and GuSCN. Particularly, a significant increase in VOC in the presence of LiI is noted because of the effective trapping of Li+ ions within the EO units of the coadsorbents.
A surface-induced cross-linking polymerization of a reactive coadsorbent anchored to the TiO2 surface was attempted.72 A polymer layer encapsulating N719 sensitized TiO2 was successfully formed by in situ polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and the 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate cross-linker (HDDA) in a N719 and 3-(2-methyl-acryloylamino) propionic acid (MAP) co-sensitized DSC. The cell with polymer layer covered TiO2 yielded an 18% improvement in JSC at a 21% lower N719 coverage and an increase of 27 mV in VOC to yield a 24% improvement in conversion efficiency with respect to the cell without this treatment. This work also indicated that coadsorbents may induce changes in the dye adsorption states, particularly for the N719 dye, leading to the breakup of dye aggregates and yielded a higher concentration of dyes that were strongly bound to the surface. In the meantime, the porous network polymer layer over the N719-sensitized TiO2 particles was revealed to be not only acting as a robust hydrophobic layer but also retarding desorption of N719 dyes from the surface of the TiO2 electrode and thus affording high stability to the DSC.
To immobilize dyes on nanocrystalline TiO2 films, a strategy to encapsulate dye molecules by macromolecular structures was developed.73–75 The strategy was based on insulation of sensitizer dyes at the molecular level by a cyclodextrin (CD) cavity to limit the interactions between dye molecules or the TiO2 surface and dye molecules. The intermolecular energy transport and interfacial charge recombination were effectively controlled accompanied by enhanced chemical and photostability, redox reversibility, and improved fluorescence and electroluminescence efficiency.74 Choi et al. reported the encapsulation of organic dye JK-2 adsorbed onto TiO2 by a series of CDs (α-CD, β-CD, and γ-CD).75 A scheme of the encapsulated structure is shown in Fig. 8. The adsorbed amounts of JK-2 on TiO2 films were decreased when encapsulated in α-CD, β-CD, and γ-CD. However, the JK-2/β-CD cell showed an impressive increased photoresponse over the entire wavelength region. The JK-2/β-CD cell showed superior photovoltaic performance to the cells comprising JK-2 or JK-2/DCA. The JSC was increased from 14.2 mA cm−2 in the JK-2 cell to 15.3 mA cm−2 in the JK-2/DCA cell and the VOC value was increased by 30–60 mV relative to the JK-2 and JK-2/DCA based cells. The encapsulation of the JK-2 dye by macromolecular structured CDs at the interface efficiently retarded electron recombination and prevented dye aggregation.

3.3. Additives in the electrolyte
Using additives in the electrolyte of DSCs is a widely used strategy for optimization of the cell performance. The additives influence mainly on the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, such as to shift the conduction band of TiO2 films, to repress the electron recombination process, and to influence the electron injection process. In typical DSCs with I−/I3− as the redox couple, various additives have been introduced into the electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 9. One class of the very frequently used additives is nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds. Among these nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) has a great advantage for improvement of the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs by significantly increasing the VOC of DSCs.76–79 However, a decrease in JSC was always found to accompany with the increase of VOC. To eliminate the trade-off between VOC and JSC induced by TBP, several other kinds of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds were employed as additives instead of TBP, such as pyrazole derivatives, imidazole derivatives, triazole derivatives, tetrazole derivatives, pyridine derivatives, pyrimidine derivatives, pyrazine derivatives, 1,3,5-triazine derivatives, benzimidazole derivatives, and aminothiazole derivatives.80–82 Most of the nitrogen heterocyclic compounds could enhance the VOC, however, the trade-off between VOC and JSC still occurred.

If the decrease of JSC could be controlled while increasing VOC, the energy conversion efficiency of DSCs can be significantly improved up to about 15%.83 The mechanism of the TBP effect has been actively studied in recent years and still been hotly debated.77,78,84,85 The lack of direct observation and comprehensive investigation of the complex TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface under operation conditions makes the mechanism study difficult to reach agreement. Nevertheless, TBP negatively charging the film surface with the lone pair electrons of nitrogen resulting in an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band is generally accepted. This has been verified indirectly by in situ monitoring the variation of QFL in TiO2 films during I–V characteristics of the DSCs with TBP and without TBP.77,86 With this direct method, TBP induced shifts of QFL in TiO2 films under short circuit and open circuit conditions could be measured accurately and analyzed separately, which helped us to deduce the adsorption of additives and cations on the TiO2 surface under the two particular conditions.77 As examples, Li+ which was widely used in most of the highly efficient DSCs and TBA+ with much larger molecular size was selected as the counter cation. The nature of counter cations (Li+ or TBA+) in the electrolyte was revealed to influence the effect of TBP on the shifts of QFL. The relationship between TBP and the cations (Li+ or TBA+) for adsorption on the TiO2 films was proposed (Fig. 10) according to their influence on the QFLs of TiO2. Besides, spectral analyses and theoretical calculations revealed that TBP could also interact with the sensitizer dye or electrolyte and affect JSC of the cells.84,85 More direct observation of the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and deep understanding of the underlying mechanism are still highly recommended.

GuSCN is another important and frequently used additive in the I−/I3− electrolyte.87–91 GuSCN was firstly reported in a N3 dye based DSC. The addition of guanidinium could effectively screen the lateral Coulombic repulsion of the N3 anions and facilitate the self-assembly of monolayers of the N3 dye at the TiO2 interface. The VOC of the cell remarkably improved and a high conversion efficiency of 11% was achieved.92 In many cases, guanidinium cations were used partly instead of Li+ ions for preventing the intercalation of Li+ into the TiO2 crystal lattice. With addition of GuSCN in the electrolyte, the cell performance could be improved by increase in both JSC and VOC. Kopidakis et al. investigated the effect of GuSCN by the transient photovoltage method and discovered that the increase of VOC by GuSCN was a competitive result between a slower recombination and a positive shift in the TiO2 conduction band.90 Zhang et al. also observed this competitive effect of GuSCN in DSCs when they studied the influence of GuSCN on the photoelectron injection efficiency and interface dynamics of electron transport in DSCs.91 In addition, the state-of-the-art ionic liquid-based DSCs normally incorporated GSCN and N-alkylbenzimidazole additives together in the electrolytes.93,94 A synergistic effect of GuSCN and N-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs was observed, and the VOC and total conversion efficiency are further improved, mainly owing to a more efficient passivation of the recombination reaction at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.95 However, the GUSCN-contained electrolyte was found to degrade the photocurrent of DSCs with time.96 The urea-contained redox electrolyte was prepared instead of the GUSCN-contained electrolyte and no significant difference was observed in the cell performance compared to that of the GUSCN-contained cell. The cell with urea–electrolyte exhibited much higher stability that the initial efficiency (7.2%) was almost unchanged after keeping for 40 days (7.1%).96
In the typical I−/I3− redox couple based electrolyte, cations as the counter part of the I− resource have been found to affect many parameters that influence the solar cell performance, such as the energetics of the semiconductor and sensitizers, the strength of sensitizer attachment on the electrode surface, the dynamics of interfacial electron transfer, the charge separation efficiency, the charge transport rate, and even the rate of iodide oxidation.97,98 Variation of the type or concentration of cations, therefore, can lead to changes in the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface so as to affect the cell performance.
The effects of cations with different charge densities, such as lithium (Li+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and dimethylimidazolium (DMI+) on the cell performance were compared.99 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the investigated cells are shown in Fig. 11. The JSC gradually diminished in the order of Li+ < Na+ < K+ < DMI+ with decreasing cation charge densities. This decrease of JSC was found to be due to the reduced electron injection rates resulting from the different extent shift of the conduction band edge induced by the cation adsorption on the surface of TiO2 films. In contrast, the VOC is largely increased in the same order of Li+ < Na+ < K+ < DMI+, primarily benefiting from less downward shift of the conduction band edge by the low-charge-density cations. Wang et al. also investigated the effects of a series of iodide salt additives (Mn+: Li+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, etc.) on the kinetic processes and photovoltaic performance of DSCs in a low-volatility electrolyte system.100 The JSC increased approximately linearly with the charge/radius ratio of the cations up to 1.5 Å−1. Beyond this value, JSC only increased slightly with the increase of charge/radius ratio. The highest JSC was obtained with the use of an AlI3 based electrolyte. The increase of JSC with different cations could be explained by the increased electron injection and collection efficiencies in DSCs. In the cases of two different cations in the electrolyte, the values of VOC appeared to be determined by the cation with the higher concentration and the stronger adsorption tendency toward the surface of the TiO2 film.
 Fig. 11  A schematic drawing of interfacial energy level shifts by “potential-determining additives” at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface. The value of d1 or d1′ is the average distance between the electron in the LUMO and the interface of the dye/TiO2, and that of d2 or d2′ is the average distance between the electron in the LUMO and the hole in the HOMO of the photo-excited dye molecule.101 
4. Summary and outlook
Over the last two decades, great effort has been focused on optimization of the component materials of DSCs, including inorganic nanocrystalline semiconductors, sensitizer dyes, hole transport materials, and materials for the counter electrode. The cell efficiency has been increased from 7% to about 12% and other performances of the cells have also been improved greatly. To further improve the cell performance especially for higher efficiency, more research work should be carried out on the interfaces of the cells. It is prospective to achieve much higher efficiency and better cell performance by developing interfacial engineering technology accompanied by the component material exploration.
Primarily, understanding the interfacial mechanisms is crucial for directing the development of interfacial engineering technology and improving the properties of the interfaces. Currently, “coordinated shifts” of energy levels in both the TiO2 and adsorbed dyes have been found to be caused by “potential-determining additives” in high efficiency DSCs.101 The observation was beyond the conventional understanding under the assumption that the potential-determining additives only shift the energy level of TiO2. The energy level and the electron wavefunction of photo-excited dye molecules were redistributed by the influence of “potential-determining additives” (Fig. 11). This discovery provided deeper insight into the interfacial energy alignment of the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and will be helpful to future design of dyes and additives as well as interfacial treatments.
We noticed that there have been relatively few studies addressing the interfaces and still much potential for modification of the interfaces for higher efficiencies. For example, the conjunction between the TCO substrate and the mesoporous TiO2 film remains not tight enough for collection of all of the arrived electrons. Realizing “one-way” transport of electrons from the TiO2 film to the collecting substrate will greatly increase the photocurrent. For engineering the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, previous work focused majorly on repression of the electron back reactions, however, less work on controlling the dye attachment upon more efficient electron injection even though a lot of coadsorbents were used to suppress the dye aggregation. Arranging the dye on the TiO2 surface more neatly and anchoring the dye with stronger bonds will benefit the electron injection process and thus increase the photocurrent. As for the use of additives, the trade-off between VOC and JSC still widely exists in DSCs with many different kinds of additives. The solution of the trade-off problem also has much room for further improvement of the efficiency of DSCs. We expect that higher efficiency will be obtained after more research work on engineering the interfaces of DSCs. Moreover, in this article our attention was majorly focused on the typical I−/I3− electrolyte based DSCs, some of the materials or technology are also applicable for other kinds of DSCs such as Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte based DSCs, quasi-solid state DSCs, and all solid state DSCs.
