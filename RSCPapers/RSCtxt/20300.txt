    , Accepted 12th November 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractWe designed novel diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer based nanoparticles (DPP-IID-FA), which exhibited strong light absorption and excellent photothermal conversion in the NIR optical window, and displayed high biocompatibility and photostability. Furthermore, our nanoparticles could be efficiently uptaken by cancer cells and exhibited outstanding anticancer ability both in vitro and in vivo under NIR-II laser irradiation.
Cancer has become one of the major causes of human death worldwide in recent decades.1,2 Traditionally, comprehensive therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are widely applied in clinical treatment of different cancers.3 However, these traditional cancer therapies usually generate serious side effects.4 Therefore, it is necessary to exploit efficient and noninvasive cancer therapy approaches to overcome the drawbacks of traditional cancer therapy strategies. Photothermal therapy (PTT), an effective therapeutic method that involves spatiotemporal addressability, minimal invasiveness and high therapeutic efficacy, has received considerable attention recently.5–9 This method involves the conversion of light into heat to kill cancer cells. In the past few decades, there have been huge developments in the field of photothermal nano-agents for biomedical applications, such as noble metal nanomaterials,8,10–12 carbon nanomaterials and small molecule organic dyes.13 However, one key drawback of these photothermal nano-agents is that the absorption bands mostly lie within the traditional near-infrared region (NIR-I, 700–900 nm),14–16 which hinders the penetration depth and maximum permissible exposure (MPE) intensity for skin of excitation light, therefore significantly decreasing their therapeutic efficacy and potential use for further clinical applications.17–19 Hence, it is urgently needed to develop novel photothermal agents which could be activated by longer wavelength infrared light. Recently, photo-thermal conversion agents excited by light in the NIR-II bio-window (1000–1700 nm) have attracted much attention since such long wavelength light could realize improved tissue penetration depth and enhanced maximum permissible exposure to the laser.18,20–22 Organic semiconductor materials have attracted much attention in recent years due to their excellent physical properties and extensive applications.23–26 Semiconducting polymers are macromolecules characterized by a system of delocalized π-electrons by hopping, tunneling, and related mechanisms, which can generate intriguing and tunable optical, electrical and thermal properties. Owing to these splendid features, semiconducting polymers have been widely used in photonics, sensing, solar energy conversion, and biomedicine. In particular, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been utilized for photothermal cancer therapy,27–29 but currently the majority of SPNs only respond to light in the NIR-I region. Thus, it would be highly desirable to shift the wavelength of excitation light to the NIR-II bio-window. So far, some biocompatible conjugated polymer nanoparticles have been developed as NIR-II photothermal agents for PTT anticancer applications. However, the organic semiconductor materials excited in the NIR-II bio-window are still very limited, and need further exploration. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer (P(AcIID-DPP)), which exhibited strong light absorption from the NIR-I to NIR-II optical region and excellent photothermal conversion ability; then, polymer nanoparticles (DPP-IID-FA) were prepared via an emulsion method. Furthermore, extensive characterizations and studies have been conducted to demonstrate the strong photo-thermal conversion efficiency, high photostability, outstanding biocompatibility and excellent tumor ablation efficiency of our nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo.
The DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles were step-wisely prepared as presented in Fig. 1. Firstly, the P(AcIID-DPP) was successfully synthesized via a Stille cross-coupling reaction (Fig. S1, ESI†), which was certified by H-NMR (Fig. S2, ESI†). The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of P(AcIID-DPP) in diluted chloroform solutions (∼10−5 M) are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In chloroform solution, the P(AcIID-DPP) showed broad absorption from 600 to 1115 nm. Afterwards, the DPP-IID-FA NPs were prepared via an emulsion method. The obtained DPP-IID-FA NPs appeared sapphire in DI-water (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the olivary morphology (Fig. 2a). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed an average hydrodynamic size of 210 ± 15 nm, and this result was slightly different compared with the TEM result, most likely because the hydrodynamic diameter was measured under solution conditions (Fig. S4b, ESI†). No precipitation or obvious change in average diameter were observed for the DPP-IID-FA NPs after storage in DI-water, PBS, DMEM and FBS medium for 28 days (Fig. S5, ESI†), demonstrating their excellent dispersibility and stability in different solutions.

(d) Temperature changes of DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles under 1 W cm−2 laser irradiation for five on/off cycles (5 min of irradiation for each cycle). (e) Photothermal effect of DPP-IID-FA dispersion under 1064 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm−2), and the laser was turned off after irradiation for 15 min. (f) Plot of cooling time versus negative natural logarithm of the temperature driving force obtained from the cooling stage as shown in (e). 
From the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra, the DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles exhibit broad absorption from 600 to 1100 nm (Fig. 2b). To the best of our knowledge, the strong absorption in the NIR-II bio-window from 1000 to 1700 nm is very important for PTT applications since it could enhance the penetration depth of light; hence, we chose 1064 nm excitation for further investigation instead of the conventional 808 nm laser. To investigate the photothermal properties, the photothermal performance of the DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles was evaluated at different concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2c, the temperature of the DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles (20 μg mL−1) increased to 59.7 °C after 5 min irradiation, whereas the temperature of a control aqueous solution just increased to 29.1 °C. Meanwhile, the increase in temperature is correlated with the increase of the nanoparticles’ concentration (Fig. 2c). The photothermal stability and repeatability were also investigated via measuring the temperature change of DPP-IID-FA solution (20 μg mL−1) under repeated 1064 nm laser irradiation with 20 min intervals of on/off cycles. Interestingly, even after five cycles of heating and cooling, the DPP-IID-FA still kept the same temperature increasing ability, demonstrating that our as-prepared nanoparticles have excellent photostability, which can afford repeated photothermal hyperthermia (Fig. 2d).
Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency was also investigated. Fig. 2e shows the plot of cooling time versus negative natural logarithm of the temperature driving force obtained from the cooling stage, and the time constant for heat transfer of the system was determined to be τs = 207.8 s. Based on the reported method and obtained data shown in Fig. 2f, the photothermal conversion efficiency of our DPP-IID-FA NPs was determined to be 49.5%. Taken together, the high photothermal efficiency and good photothermal stability of our as-prepared DPP-IID-FA NPs make it a promising and highly effective photothermal agent for further biomedical applications.
Cell uptake is crucial for the cancer treatment process of nanoparticles. The cell internalization of DPP-IID-FA NPs with coumarin-6 (CU) labelling was studied in HeLa cells as a model. As expected, strong CU fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of DPP-IID/CU-FA incubated cells (Fig. 3a).
 Fig. 3  (a) CLSM images of HeLa cells without any treatment, or the HeLa cells incubated with DPP-IID-FA or DPP-IID for 6 h, or the HeLa cells pre-treated with FA for 2 h and then further incubated with DPP-IID-FA for 6 h. Scale bar = 20 μm. (b) In vitro cytotoxicity against HeLa cells: DPP-IID-FA, DPP-IID + laser, FA + DPP-IID-FA + laser and DPP-IID-FA + laser. (c) Fluorescence images of calcein AM (green, live cells) and propidium iodide (red, dead cells) co-stained HeLa cells (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n = 4) and (d) cell death mechanism evaluation through annexin V-FITC and PI staining: (1) control, (2) DPP-IID-FA, (3) laser only, (4) DPP-IID-FA + laser; (5) DPP-IID + laser and (6) DPP-IID-FA + HeLa pre-treated by FA + laser. (Laser = 1064 nm laser irradiation at a power density of 0.8 W cm−2 for 5 min). 
Meanwhile, the HeLa cells incubated with DPP-IID/CU-FA exhibited significantly higher fluorescence than that in FA pre-treated HeLa cells or the HeLa cells incubated with DPP-IID/CU without the FA targeting ligand (Fig. 3a). These results clearly indicated that our DPP-IID-FA possessed admirable specific targeting ability to facilitate cell uptake via receptor-mediated internalization, since the receptors of FA are highly expressed on the surface of HeLa cells.
Encouraged by the outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency and specific targeting ability, the photothermal therapy effect of DPP-IID-FA was further assessed by CCK-8 assay in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3b, the cell viability of HeLa cells incubated with different concentrations of DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles but without 1064 nm laser irradiation showed more than 95% cell viability even up to 40 μg mL−1, suggesting the excellent biocompatibility of our nanoparticles; while for the nanoparticle incubated cells with 1064 nm laser irradiation for 5 min, the cell viability was significantly decreased along with the increase of the nanoparticle concentration (less than 20% at 40 μg mL−1), suggesting the concentration dependent photo-thermal killing effects of our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles. In addition, HeLa cells incubated with DPP-IID-FA exhibited higher killing effect than that in FA pre-treated HeLa cells or the HeLa cells incubated with DPP-IID under 1064 nm laser irradiation (Fig. 3b), due to the enhanced cellular uptake mediated by the FA receptor. Taken together, these results clearly suggested that the as-prepared DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles possessed excellent photothermal therapy effect, specific targeting ability and inherent low cytotoxicity.
To further intuitively survey the cell killing effect of the as-prepared DPP-IID-FA under 1064 nm laser irradiation, the HeLa cells was treated as follows, only irradiation, only DPP-IID-FA NP incubation, DPP-IID-FA incubation + laser irradiation, DPP-IID incubation + laser irradiation and DPP-IID-FA incubation with FA pre-treatment + laser irradiation (laser irradiation at 0.8 W cm−2 for 5 min); afterwards, the cells were stained using a LIVE/DEAD® Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit, by which the live cells and dead cells could be clearly distinguished by the green and red fluorescence signals, and then observed under a microscope. As shown in Fig. 3c, HeLa cells treated with DPP-IID-FA + laser irradiation displayed significantly higher killing efficiency than any other groups. These results further suggested the extremely excellent cancer cell killing efficiency of our as-prepared DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles.
To investigate the anticancer mechanism, the HeLa cells were double-labelled with Annexin V-FITC (fluoresceine isothiocyanate) and PI (propidium iodide) for flow cytometry analysis. From the scatter plot in four quadrants which represent normal (lower left), necrosis (upper left), early apoptosis (lower right) and late apoptosis (upper right) (Fig. 3d), almost all cells were located in the viable region in the control group, irradiation only group, and DPP-IID-FA NPs only group. Furthermore, the apoptotic rates are increased up to 18.53% and 15.63% for the FA pre-treated and DPP-IID incubated cells under 1064 nm laser irradiation for 5 min, respectively. Obviously, the apoptosis rate induced by DPP-IID-FA with 1064 nm laser treatment was highest among all treatment groups, up to ∼54%. The enhanced apoptosis effect was consistent with its remarkable photothermal effect, which might be ascribed to the enhanced cellular uptake mediated by FA and the efficient temperature increase in cancer cells under 1064 nm laser irradiation.
Furthermore, the potential toxicology of DPP-IID-FA NPs in BALB/c mice was carefully investigated. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the blood biochemical indicators and pathological evaluation of major organs (H&E staining) suggested that our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles had excellent biosafety in vivo.
Inspired by the strong in vitro PTT cell killing ability and excellent biocompatibility, we then carried out animal experiments to investigate the in vivo antitumor efficiency of our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles. Firstly, ex vivo imaging analysis of the tumor and other major organs of the mice with intravenous injection of coumarin-6 labelled nanoparticles were performed to demonstrate the tumor accumulation ability of our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles in vivo; as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), although the coumarin-6 labelled nanoparticles also inevitably entered into the metabolic organs such as the liver, a considerable amount of our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles were significantly still accumulated in the tumor after 24 h of injection. Furthermore, the DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles were accumulated obviously more than the DPP-IID nanoparticles at the tumor site, due to the FA-mediated specific targeting ability.
Afterwards, in vivo photothermal imaging and therapy were further investigated on tumor xenografts in nude mice. As shown in Fig. S8a and b (ESI†), the mice injected with DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles presented an obvious temperature increase, and even reach 57.2 °C under l064 nm NIR laser irradiation for 10 min (1064 nm, 1 W cm−2), which was sufficient to thermally ablate the tumor, while the DPP-IID treated group only increased to 45.3 °C within 10 min laser irradiation. By contrast, the local temperature of the tumor was only increased to about 36.2 °C only with laser irradiation but without nanoparticle injection. These results demonstrated the excellent heat-producing ability and highly targeting accumulation potential of the as-prepared DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles, which might hold great promise to photothermally ablate tumors in vivo.
Then, the tumor size was measured every two days during the therapeutic process to assess the therapeutic efficiency. Notably, tumors on mice from the DPP-IID-FA injection + 1064 nm laser irradiation group were inhibited completely, without any recurrence in the observation period of 14 d (Fig. 4a). At the same time, the growth of tumors on mice from the DPP-IID injection + 1064 nm laser irradiation group showed a certain suppressive effect. In comparison, fast increase of the tumor volumes in the groups with saline injection, DPP-IID-FA injection but without 1064 nm laser irradiation, and only 1064 nm laser irradiation was observed during this 14 d period. Body weight fluctuation is a direct indicator of in vivo toxicity. In our current study, all mice showed no obvious body weight lose during the treatment process (Fig. 4b), indicating that these particles exhibited no obvious overall side effects on mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and Ki-67 antibody staining of tumor tissues were further conducted to investigate the mechanism of PTT after different treatments. As shown in Fig. 4d, there are no obvious changes in cell status of the control group, DPP-IID-FA group and 1064 nm laser irradiation alone group. Comparatively, H&E results showed a great number of dead cells in the tumor sections in the groups of DPP-IID and DPP-IID-FA with 1064 nm laser irradiation. In particular, the group of DPP-IID-FA with 1064 nm laser irradiation showed much higher cell necrosis in the tumor tissues (Fig. 4c) in comparison with other therapeutic groups. Ki-67 antibody staining is commonly used to detect the proliferative status of cancer cells, and the results are in good agreement with the H&E results, confirming the PTT therapeutic effects of our DPP-IID-FA.

In summary, we developed novel organic semiconductor nanoparticles with high absorption in the NIR window for PTT applications. The obtained DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles showed a uniformly distributed size around 200 nm, high colloidal and photostability, and excellent biocompatibility. Meanwhile, our DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles are able to quickly and efficiently transfer light to heat under NIR-II laser irradiation with an impressive light-to-heat conversion efficiency of 49.5%. Furthermore, the as-prepared DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles showed excellent targeting ability toward FA-receptor overexpressing cancer cells. Upon NIR-II laser irradiation, the DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles showed strong cancer cell killing ability and super therapeutic efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the as-prepared DPP-IID-FA nanoparticles might serve as an excellent novel PTT agent for anticancer applications in the NIR-II light region, and might provide valuable insights for further developing NIR-II organic semiconducting nanoparticle based PTT agents.
