    , Accepted 7th March 2018First published on 8th March 2018AbstractOur synthesized oligomer (OCACP) can convert the near-infrared (NIR) region of sunlight into visible light with assistance from ultraviolet (UV) light, and the mechanism includes UV quantum cutting and NIR two-photon absorption. Here, we report a high conversion rate (ΦF = 0.4108) for a wavelength-focusing photoluminescent OCACP with densely grafted 2-pyrazoline that was prepared by free-radical polymerization of 3-carbethoxy-5-acrylatecarbethoxy-2-pyrazoline, a chromophore with good fluorescence (ΦF = 0.0171). After polymerization, the densely grafted 2-pyrazoline significantly increased the interaction between the pyrazoline ring and formed a propeller shape, and the intramolecular pyrazoline ring rotations were physically restricted, which restrained the non-radiative pathway and accelerated the radiative pathway. These factors collectively contributed to the excellent fluorescence performance of OCACP. Additionally, OCACP achieved good-quality live-cell imaging with an enhancement in the fluorescence intensity through two-wavelength excitation of the cell rather than increasing the dye dosage or laser power and improved the visible portion of sunlight for more efficient use of solar energy.
Introduction
Directly increasing the spectral intensity of visible light from sunlight in the near-infrared (NIR) region has attracted attention as a method to improve the solar energy utilization ratio. The previously reported up-conversion (UC) materials have always been associated with the use of coherent light sources (lasers), which have notably stronger intensities than sunlight, and the NIR light from sunlight is difficult to convert. Recently, Baluschev et al. achieved an UC of sunlight using two or more active-component, metalated porphyrin macrocycles as sensitizers in a matrix of blue-emitting molecules with a high fluorescence quantum yield;1–4 however, their materials are complexes that heavily rely on metal ions. Here, our work mainly focuses on the simplification and mono-molecularization of multiple assembled UC luminescence systems in which the conjugated fluorophore in simple molecules fluoresces, such as down-conversion fluorescent materials. We suggest the UC of NIR light from the sun to visible light by UC photoluminescence (PL) in unalloyed organic molecular materials, and the conversion process is assisted by ultraviolet (UV) light. The UV and NIR regions of sunlight can be simultaneously converted to visible light, and the process is called wavelength focusing (WF). In addition, the photoluminescence integrated intensity (PLII) has a quadratic dependence on the intensity of the absorbed light, which indicates that the conversion mechanism includes UV quantum cutting and NIR two-photon absorption5 and that the visible portion of sunlight will significantly increase as the sunlight intensity increases, resulting in an enhancement in the solar energy efficiency.
The quantum yield of fluorescent materials indicates the efficiency of the fluorescence process.6 Thus, improving the quantum yield is important for most fluorescent materials. In recent years, 2-pyrazoline and its derivatives have been frequently used as fluorescence sensors and biological fluorescent dyes7–10 due to their considerable biological activities11–16 and their WF properties.17–22 To increase the quantum yield, attempts have been made to synthesize and elucidate the effects of the substituent on the absorption and fluorescence properties of pyrazoline derivatives, but the reported synthesis steps are usually tedious.8 Thus, we developed 3-carbethoxy-5-acrylatecarbethoxy-2-pyrazoline (CACP), which has a quantum yield of 0.0171 as measured by the Williams and Winfield method.23 After polymerization (Scheme 1), the quantum yield improved to 0.4108 under the optimized conditions. The obtained oligomer (OCACP) was well-defined and clearly characterized by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectra. The proposed polymerization mechanism with CACP was initiated by a radical initiator and ended with dehydrogen CACP. Additionally, compared to other reported pyrazoline derivatives, the oligomers (OCACPs) with densely grafted 2-pyrazoline have significantly increased interactions in the pyrazoline ring, which acts as a fluorophore. The fluorescence enhancement can also be attributed to a phenomenon similar to aggregation-induced emission;24i.e., the pyrazoline ring located in the side chain formed a propeller shape, and the pyrazoline ring intramolecular rotations were physically restricted. The restriction of the intramolecular rotations restrained the non-radiative pathway and accelerated the radiative pathway, and the fluorescence emission efficiency improved. Therefore, the novel polymer reveals a new pathway for the development of high quantum yield WF photoluminescence (WFPL) with simple molecules.

Results and discussion
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence properties
Our synthetic process for CACP and OCACPs was outlined in Scheme 1 (see ESI† for detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of OCACPs (Fig. 1a) were recorded in chloroform with a concentration of 0.03 mg mL−1 at room temperature. The absorption intensities of OCACPs were different from one another for the absorption bands in the range of 240–400 nm that were assigned to the π–π* and n–π* transitions localized on the pyrazoline ring system.25 As shown in Fig. 1b, there were two maximum excitation wavelengths for each sample, and the down-conversion (DC) and UC excitation wavelength for all OCACPs were approximately at 346 and 688 nm. We expected that the photofluorescence behaviors of these pyrazoline oligomers with the co-excitation by 346 + 688 nm dichromatic light would be totally different from that by monochromatic 346 nm or 688 nm light and measured their dual wavelength-stimulated fluorescence intensities on a RF-5301PC (Shimadzu) fluorescence spectrophotometer with the wavelengths of dichromatic light source being 346 + 688 nm (Fig. 1c), which was formed by the grating effect of monochromator. The light source spectra were recorded by a 45° reflection. The emission spectra of OCACPs with dichromatic light excitation were provided in Fig. 1d, the maximum emission wavelengths for all OCACPs were nearly the same because the fluorophore in each OCACP was the same. But the PL intensity for each OCACP was different, ranged from 191 (run 8) to 958 a.u. (run 5). Moreover, there was a significant enhancement in the emission intensity of OCACPs compared with that of CACP. The maximum enhancement was calculated using the molecular fluorescence emission efficiency (defined as I/N, which is the maximum emission intensity for a nitrogen atom of 1 mg mL−1), and OCACP (run 7) showed nearly a 68-fold increase at a concentration of 0.03 mg mL−1 (ESI,† Fig. S16). More than that the spectral intensity of visible region can be enhanced by OCACPs under continuous spectrum stimulation, chloroform and 0.03 mg mL−1 of OCACP (run 1) in chloroform were irradiated respectively by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) without filter, which was used to simulated sunlight, as shown in Fig. 1e, compared the emission spectra of OCACP solution (red line in Fig. 1e) with that of chloroform (black line in Fig. 1e), the intensity of region 355–425 nm and 592–802 nm was weakened, but the intensity of region 425–592 nm was enhanced, the results indicated that OCACP absorbed UV light (355–425 nm) and NIR light (592–802 nm), and emitted visible light (425–592 nm). Compared the integrated intensity of visible region (425–592 nm) of OCACP (run 1) with that of chloroform, the difference value (ESI,† Table S2) was increased distinctly with the power of light source (Fig. 1f).

WF conversion mechanism study
As shown in Fig. 1c, the dichromatic light had NIR frequency doubling (NIRFD, 346 nm) and NIR (688 nm) two regions, and the NIR region (640–740 nm) had an integrated intensity (25014) nearly equal to that of the NIRFD region (21826, 300–400 nm), Then, we used short-wave-pass (λ < 580 nm) and long-wave-pass (λ > 625 nm) filter to filter longer-wavelength or shorter-wavelength light of the dichromatic light, but the filtration of longer-wavelength light was hard, because of its strong penetration, so we used supfire UV03-365 flashlight as mono-wavelength irradiation light to stimulate OCACP (run 1), the source spectrum of supfire UV03-365 flashlight (the black line in Fig. 2a) had little wavelength doubling light and the emission spectrum of OCACP (the red line in Fig. 2a) was obtained, and the maximum emission wavelength of OCACP under dichromatic light and single 365 nm light stimulation was the same. At the other hand, when we used long-wave-pass (λ > 625 nm) filter to filter the shorter-wavelength (the black line in Fig. 2b) in dichromatic light excitation of RF-5301PC (Shimadzu) fluorescence spectrophotometer, the OCACP did not fluoresce under single 688 nm stimulation (the red line in Fig. 2b). The results indicated that OCACP can emit fluorescence under the irradiation of single UV light (365 nm) or 346 + 688 nm dichromatic light, but not the single 688 nm light. The π–π* fluorescence by dichromatic light irradiation was then investigated to distinguish it from the conventional single wavelength fluorescence.26

(b) The source spectrum (black line) of 688 nm irradiation of RF-5301PC (Shimadzu) fluorescence spectrophotometer with long-wave-pass (λ > 625 nm) filter, and slit width set at 1.5 for both monochromators; the emission spectra (red line) of OCACP (run 1) under 688 nm irradiation of RF-5301PC (Shimadzu) fluorescence spectrophotometer with long-wave-pass (λ > 625 nm) filter, and slit width set at 5.0 for both monochromators. 
To further research the WFPL mechanism, we adjusted slit width of dichromatic light excitation of RF-5301PC (Shimadzu) fluorescence spectrophotometer without filter and obtained a series of emission spectra of OCACP (run 1), and then we calculated the PLIIs (365–635 nm) of emission spectra and measured the excitation light intensity by a UVA light meter, Unexpectedly (ESI,† Table S3), The PLII was not linearly dependent on the intensity of the incident dichromatic light. If the fluorescence emitted process just related to UV light (single 346 nm), the PLII must be linearly dependent on the intensity of incident dichromatic light, i.e., the fluorescence emitted process was single-photon absorption. It seemed that the fluorescence emission process was not a classical single-photon conversion and such interesting process should be clearly understood. Then, we placed the signal receiver of UVA light meter in the sample cell to measure the power of the incident light of supfire UV03-365 flashlight and calculated the corresponding PLII (407–650 nm) of OCACP stimulated by different power of supfire UV03-365 flashlight (ESI,† Table S4), the PLII (407–650 nm) was determined to be linearly dependent on the intensity of the incident single UV light (365 nm, Fig. 3a), it meant that the fluorescence emission under single UV light irradiation was really a single-photon conversion process. Then we placed a solar panel in the sample cell to measure the current value of the optical induction, which was proportional to the intensity of incident dichromatic light, because the UVA light meter can only measure UV light around 365 nm (including 346 nm). The data was summarized in Table S3 (ESI†), the PLII (368–635 nm) was determined to be square dependent on the intensity of the incident dichromatic light (Fig. 3b). To further investigate the relationship between the intensity of incident dichromatic light and the corresponding PLII (368–635 nm), we used the signal receiver of a UVA light meter and a solar panel to respectively measure the power of 346 nm part and the intensity of 688 nm part of the incident dichromatic light, and the PLII (368–635 nm) was measured to be square dependent on the power of the 346 nm part (Fig. 3c) of incident dichromatic light and linearly dependent on the intensity of the 688 nm part of incident dichromatic light (Fig. 3d).

As Albota et al.27 reported, the two-photon transition was from the ground state (Eπ) to the lowest excited state (Eπ*), and for organic molecules, the lowest one-photon allowed excited state (Eπi, Fig. 4) existed between the ground state (Eπ) and the lowest excited state (Eπ*). In addition, the fact that OCACP (run 1) could emit fluorescence under 700 nm two-photon excitation (Fig. 5c) also proved the existence of the lowest one-photon allowed excited state (Eπi) for OCACP. The results of Fig. 3b and c indicated that for OCACP the electron transition from the ground state to the lowest excited state by dichromatic light was a two-photon absorption process and the UV part participated in the process by quantum cutting, and the maximum emission wavelength for OCACP (run 1) was 447 nm, indicating that the process was not just related to UV quantum cutting. On the other hand, for noncoherent light sources, single NIR photon can only stimulate the electron to jump from the π-orbital to the πi-orbital (π–πi transition) and not directly to the π*-orbital, which was supported by Fig. 3c. Thus, the energy for the electron to jump from the πi-orbital to the π*-orbital (πi–π* transition) must come from the quantum cutting of the incident NIRFD photon (Fig. 4). One NIRFD photon can be converted to two NIR photons by quantum cutting, and the generated NIR photon can cooperate with the incident NIR photon to allow the electron to transfer from the π-orbital to the π*-orbital (π–π* transition). Meanwhile, the two-photon mechanism also well explained the increased difference value between the integrated intensity of visible region (425–592 nm) of OCACP and that of chloroform (Fig. 1f).

Possible mechanism for high quantum yield
To explore the mechanism that resulted in the fluorescence enhancement and high quantum yield, we expected that the high quantum yield of the emitted fluorescence could also be attributed to the polymerization-induced and synergistic effect of the pyrazoline ring. We reported CEP-g-PVA21 with a 12.12% grafting ratio of 2-pyrazoline showed a fluorescence enhancement, but the low grafting ratio and poor solubility did not allow for optical studies. However, OCACPs with densely grafted 2-pyrazoline have a significantly increased interaction between the pyrazoline ring, which acts as a fluorophore, and the mechanism of the increased fluorescence is similar to that of aggregation-induced emission; i.e., the pyrazoline ring located in the side chain forms a propeller shape, and the intramolecular rotations of the pyrazoline ring are physically restricted. The restriction of the intramolecular rotations restrains the non-radiative pathway and accelerates the radiative pathway. As a result, the fluorescence emission efficiency improves.
Cell experiment
We conducted experiments with living cells to evaluate the in vivo fluorescent images obtained using the synthesized OCACP (run 1). As shown in Fig. 5, we observed strong fluorescence signals in the HeLa cells using single-photon excitation at 405 nm (Fig. 5b), two-photon laser excitation at 700 nm (Fig. 5c), and multi-photon laser excitation at 405 + 700 nm (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5e showed the overlaid image, which was overlaid with the bright-field image (Fig. 5a and d). Additionally, we clearly observed that the luminescence in Fig. 5d was brighter than that in Fig. 5b or c; the same phenomenon appeared in our previous reports,20,21 indicating that the WFPL of OCACP provided a simple method to enhance luminescence for cell imaging. This method is superior to increasing the dye dosage or laser power because it is less harmful to living cells. OCACP shows a low cytotoxicity (ESI,† Fig. S17), and it can be used for bioimaging, especially for multi-photon excitation under UV-vis and NIR light. Thus, OCACPs are great candidates for applications in fluorescence imaging and as probes.
Conclusions
In summary, OCACP free-radical polymerization of CACP results in a new linear chain N-hetero-macromolecule that exhibits a high quantum yield, WFPL and a significant fluorescence enhancement compared with that of CACP, and these enhancements come from the increased interaction between pyrazoline rings and the formation of a propeller shape. According to the analysis of the MALDI-TOF mass spectra and NMR spectrum, a CACP polymerization mechanism was proposed. A novel solar UC mechanism of simple molecules is first presented, and the participation of UV light quantum cutting allows for a successful UC process, which is supported by the quadratic dependence between the intensity of the incident light and the corresponding PLII. The advantage of OCACP in live-cell imaging is that high-quality images are conveniently achieved by its WFPL, which is also attractive for improving the solar energy utilization ratio.
