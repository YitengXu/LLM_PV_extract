    , Accepted 18th January 2016First published on 19th January 2016AbstractCocatalysts, when loaded onto a water splitting photocatalyst, accelerate the gas evolution reaction and improve the efficiency of the photocatalyst. In this paper, we report that the efficiency of the photocatalyst is enhanced using an amorphous cobalt oxide cocatalyst. The WO3 film, when loaded with amorphous or nanocrystalline Co3O4, shows an improvement of up to 40% in photocurrent generation and 34% in hydrogen gas evolution. The effect of cocatalyst crystallinity on performance was systematically studied, and we found that the photocurrent deteriorates with the conversion of the cocatalyst to a highly crystalline phase at an annealing temperature of 500 °C. The mechanism of this effect was studied in detail using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the enhancement effect produced by the amorphous cocatalyst is attributed to the large density of unsaturated catalytically active sites in the amorphous material.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting is an attractive process as it produces energy from a clean process starting from renewable raw materials and stores this energy in the form of hydrogen gas.1 The process involves (i) the absorption of photons and the generation of electron–hole pairs, (ii) the separation and migration of electron–hole pairs, and (iii) surface redox reaction via photogenerated electrons and holes. For water splitting, the surface redox reaction is a combination of two half-reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).2 Of the two half-reactions, the OER is more complex as it requires multiple interactions and the removal of four protons and electrons for oxygen to evolve.3 As such, much work has been focused on improving the solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency for photoanode catalysts.
Photoanode materials used for the OER are n-type semiconductors whose band bending at the surface drives minority holes to its surface. Among the various n-type semiconductors, tungsten oxide (WO3) has been widely studied due to its good stability in neutral to acidic solution,4 non-toxicity, good charge transport properties5 and high oxidation power of valence band holes (+3.1−3.2 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)).6 Its bandgap of 2.6–2.8 eV allows the absorption of the blue portion of the visible spectrum. While it has a theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of ca. 4.5%,5 such efficiency is rarely attained due to losses such as the recombination of charge carriers and kinetic loss.7 To reduce these losses, the photocatalyst can be loaded with cocatalysts which improve the efficiency of the water splitting process.
When loaded in an appropriate amount (typically <5%), cocatalysts help in accelerating the water splitting reaction using a photocatalyst. The deposited cocatalysts serve as reaction sites for the water splitting process and catalyse the reaction.8 They also promote the transportation of charges from the catalyst, and increase charge separation at the interface between the cocatalyst and the photocatalytic semiconductor.9 In addition, the cocatalyst improves the stability of the photoanodes by extracting photogenerated holes from the photoanodes, thus suppressing photocorrosion.10 For the HER, platinum (Pt) is usually considered as the best cocatalyst. A volcano relation has been established between the exchange current for H2 evolution and the bond strength of metal–hydrogen, and Pt sits at the peak of the volcano.11 In the case of the OER, a clear dominant cocatalyst is yet to be established. Several inorganic cocatalysts, such as IrOx,12 CoOx,10 Co3O4,13 NiOx,9,13 and RuO2,14 were found to enhance the photocatalytic reaction.
While it may be expected that highly crystalline cocatalysts would show good performance due to their favourable charge transport properties, some of the most effective cocatalysts that have been reported are amorphous materials such as MoS2,15 CoOx16 and Co–Pi.17,18 The effect of crystallinity on the performance of these cocatalysts, however, has not been systematically studied. In this work, we investigated the effect of the crystallinity of Co3O4 cocatalysts on the photocatalytic water splitting performance of the WO3 film. The cocatalyst and the WO3 photocatalyst film were deposited using the sol–gel process. Sol–gel deposition is a low-cost solution-based method, and offers distinct advantages such as large area film deposition and ease of control over the film's stoichiometry.19,20 Here, we will report the photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis and gas evolution performance of Co3O4/WO3 films. The superior photocurrent generation capability of amorphous cocatalysts compared to their crystalline counterparts will also be presented, together with a detailed mechanistic study of this effect based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of WO3 sol–gel precursor solution
The deposition of WO3 thin films was carried out by spin-coating WO3 sol–gel precursor solution onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass. The WO3 precursor solution was prepared by first adding 0.4 ml of acetylacetone into 5 ml of methanol, after which the solution mixture was slowly added into 0.5 g of WCl6 (Sigma Aldrich) before undergoing further dilution with 5 ml of methanol. 0.25 g of poly(ethylene glycol) (Sigma Aldrich, average molecular weight of 200) was then added to the solution to improve the film quality during spin-coating. The solution was allowed to age under constant stirring for 4 days before use. All of the above steps were carried out inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
2.2 Thin film deposition
Prior to the spin-coating process, the substrates were cleaned by sonication in ethanol for 5 min followed by oxygen plasma treatment using a Trion Sirus reactive ion etcher at 100 W for 2 min. The sol–gel solution was pre-filtered using a 0.45 μm PVDF Whatman syringe filter, and then spin-coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s. After each spin-coating cycle, the substrates were annealed at 300 °C for 2 min to convert the organic layer into oxide. The process was repeated for 20 cycles to obtain a WO3 film with a final thickness of about 1.4 μm. To obtain a crystalline WO3 film, the substrates were subjected to a final annealing step at 500 °C for 1 h.
Co3O4 was deposited on WO3 through sol–gel spin-coating. Its precursor solution is prepared by mixing 0.05 g of cobalt acetylacetonate into 10 ml of methanol with 0.1 ml of ethanolamine as a stabilizer. The precursor solution is stirred overnight before spin-coating onto the WO3 film using the same spin parameters as those for WO3. The cocatalyst solution was spin-coated for 1 cycle followed by annealing on a hotplate for 15 min. For comparison purposes, WO3 samples loaded with NiOx cocatalysts were also prepared; NiOx was deposited from a nickel acetate precursor solution of similar concentration.
2.3 Structural characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the deposited films were analysed using a Bruker D8 general area detector diffraction system (GADDS). The film morphology was characterized using an ESM-9000 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using VG Thermo ESCALab 220i-XL X-ray photoelectron spectrometer under monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The binding energies were charge corrected using an adventitious C 1s peak at 285.0 eV as a reference. UV-Vis absorbance studies were carried out using a Shimadzu 3101 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.
2.4 PEC measurements
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out in a 3-electrode configuration using the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the Pt counter electrode and the cocatalyst/WO3 film coated on FTO glass as the working electrode. A black tape was used to define the active area of 1 cm2 on the coated sample. The electrodes were immersed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution, with a pH of 5.84 as measured using a Hanna Instruments pH meter. The PEC measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT101 potentiostat. The light source used was an Oriel solar simulator using a 150 W Xenon arc lamp fitted with an AM 1.5 filter, with light intensity maintained at 100 mW cm−2. Using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were collected with an amplitude setting of 10 mV and frequency varying from 0.1 to 100000 Hz. The electrolyte used is 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and at a potential of 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
2.5 Gas evolution analysis
Photoelectrocatalytic water splitting gas evolution was characterized in a closed recirculating glass reactor filled with Ar gas. The same 3-electrode configuration and electrolyte solution was used for the gas evolution measurement. The electrodes were connected to a DY2100 series potentiostat (Digi-Ivy, Inc.), which was used to supply a constant voltage of 1 V across the reference and working electrodes. The samples were illuminated using a 150 W Xenon arc lamp fitted with an AM 1.5 filter at a light intensity of 50 mW cm−2. The amount of evolved gases was analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014 with a TCD detector and an MS-5A column, Ar carrier).
3. Results and discussion
XRD spectra of the deposited WO3 film on FTO glass and a thick Co3O4 film on the silicon substrate are shown in Fig. 1. The WO3 film shows distinct peaks at 2θ = 24.8°, 34.6°, and 50.3°, which match well with the data from JCPDS 01-083-0950 (monoclinic WO3 crystal structure). The crystalline Co3O4 film annealed at 500 °C shows a single crystalline phase with peaks consistent with the corresponding literature data in the JCPDS database (00-043-1003). Thus, the XRD data confirmed that the desired oxide materials have been obtained from the sol–gel process. In addition, the deposition of an ultra-thin layer of the Co3O4 cocatalyst film on WO3 did not result in any crystallinity change for the WO3 film (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the XRD spectra of the Co3O4 film at different annealing temperatures. From the XRD spectra, it can be seen that the Co3O4 film is completely amorphous at 200 °C, while a nano-crystalline phase starts to emerge at 300 and 400 °C. At 500 °C, a highly crystalline Co3O4 phase can be observed from the XRD pattern. Using the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of Co3O4 increases from 3.7 nm (at 400 °C) to 7.8 nm (at 500 °C).

The optical absorption properties of WO3 and Co3O4/WO3 films are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows that the WO3 film absorbs photons in the UV spectrum with its absorption edge at about 450 nm. With an ultra-thin layer of Co3O4, there is a very slight increase in absorbance at wavelengths up to around 600 nm. This is due to the smaller bandgap of Co3O4, previously reported to be 2.07 eV.21 From the absorbance data, a Tauc plot is generated for the WO3 film using the following equations: α = 2.302A/t(1) (αE)γ ∝ (E − Eg)(2)where α is the absorption coefficient, A is the film absorbance, E is the photon energy, Eg is the band gap and the exponential γ equals to 0.5 for the indirect band gap material. With the Tauc plot, the band gap of the deposited WO3 film is determined to be 2.6 eV which is similar to the reported studies in the literature.22

The morphology of the deposited WO3 and Co3O4/WO3 thin films can be observed from the SEM images shown in Fig. 4. The sol–gel deposited WO3 film shows a porous structure with some short interconnecting rods of WO3 particles connecting between different growth regions on the film. With an ultra-thin layer of Co3O4 deposited on top, little change in the film morphology is observed. A cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) shows only the WO3 layer (with a thickness of around 1.4 μm), while the Co3O4 layer is unobservable. Further analysis using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) could not detect any cobalt ions from the cocatalyst layer, and only tungsten and tin (from the FTO layer) ions showed up in the spectrum.

As XRD, SEM and EDX analysis could not detect the presence of the ultra-thin layer of the Co3O4 cocatalyst, further analysis was performed using XPS. Fig. 5 shows the XPS data for a Co3O4/WO3 thin film sample with the cocatalyst annealed to 350 °C. The Co 2p spectra consist of two main peaks at 797.1 and 781.2 eV, which correspond to Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 binding energies respectively and confirm the presence of Co on the surface. Our Co 2p3/2 binding energy value is slightly higher than the typically reported range of 780.0–780.9 eV.23,24 It is known that the 2 cobalt oxidation states present in Co3O4, namely Co3+ and Co2+, have binding energies of 780 and 782 eV respectively.24 Thus, the slightly higher binding energy observed for our sample may be indicative of a larger percentage of Co2+ ions. The other two peaks at 803.1 and 787.1 eV can be attributed to its shake up satellite peaks.25

To investigate the photocurrent generation capabilities of WO3 and Co3O4/WO3, linear sweep voltammetry was utilized under dark and light conditions using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Fig. 6 shows the PEC current–voltage curve of bare WO3 and Co3O4/WO3 films. Under dark conditions, all the deposited films show negligible current flowing through the system, as can be observed for WO3 films in the dark. Under AM 1.5 illumination, WO3 films show a measured photocurrent of 0.42 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This is comparable to WO3 films deposited using other synthetic methods26 but lower than nanostructured films with a high surface area.27 With a layer of the cocatalyst deposited, the WO3 films show an almost 40% increase in photocurrent generation. The results show that Co3O4 is effective in improving the photoactivity of the WO3 films. The amount of cocatalyst can be controlled by varying the cocatalyst thickness, which is determined by the number of spin-coated layers. A thicker cocatalyst layer, however, has a deteriorative effect as can be seen with 3 layers of Co3O4 films. The decrease in photocurrent is due to better coverage of the 3 layer coating which blocks the active sites in the WO3 films.28

Fig. 7 presents the change in photocurrent with annealing temperature of the cocatalyst. The photocurrent shows an initial increase with annealing temperature before deteriorating at an annealing temperature of more than 400 °C.

The deterioration in photocurrent may be attributed to the increasing crystallinity of the cocatalyst film at higher annealing temperatures. In order to verify if this effect is also observable for other cocatalysts, a similar study was performed on WO3 films loaded with NiOx. The same trend was observed for the NiOx cocatalyst, whereby amorphous or nanocrystalline cocatalysts annealed below 400 °C outperform highly crystalline cocatalysts annealed at higher temperatures (Fig. S4–S6 in the ESI†).
A systematic mechanistic study of the above-mentioned effects was performed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 8 shows the EIS data of the Co3O4 cocatalyst deposited on WO3 films under light illumination. The EIS Nyquist plot consists of 2 semi-circles, with the high frequency arc (first semicircle) corresponding to the fast charge transport through the WO3 and cocatalyst films (RBulk and CPEBulk) and the low frequency arc (second semicircle) corresponding to the slower interfacial charge transfer at the film–electrolyte interface (RCT and CPECT).29 Using the model in Fig. 8b for equivalent circuit fitting, the values for RBulk, CPEBulk, RCT, and CPECT are obtained and shown in Table 1.

(b) Equivalent circuit used for modelling the electrochemical cell. All capacitances are modelled using a constant phase element (CPE) to achieve a good fitting. RBulk and CPEBulk refer to the resistance and capacitance across the bulk semiconductor while RCT and CPECT correspond to the charge transfer interfacial layer between the electrode and the electrolyte.

At low cocatalyst annealing temperature (<400 °C), the value of the charge transfer resistance (RCT) is found to be lower for the cocatalyst/WO3 films compared to bare WO3. The lower RCT value shows that charge transfer is more efficient at the electrode/electrolyte interface with the incorporation of the cocatalysts, thus contributing to the enhanced photocurrent generated (Fig. 6 and 7). This indicates the good catalytic activity of the cocatalysts. In addition to the lower RCT value, the charge transfer capacitance (CPECT) value is also found to be higher than the bare WO3 film. The charge transfer capacitance is related to the surface states, and a higher capacitance value indicates a greater surface density of states.30 This finding is unsurprising, because amorphous materials are expected to have more unsaturated sites due to greater disorder in their structure.31 Due to these unsaturated sites, a greater amount of water molecules can be adsorbed onto the film's surface,32,33 thus resulting in an increase in catalytic activity and photocurrent. The increase in surface states is also known to pin the Fermi level of the photocatalyst, and results in an anodic shift in the onset potential.29 This offsets the cathodic shift normally observed upon the introduction of a cocatalyst, and may account for the reason why only a marginal shift in the onset potential has been observed (Fig. 6). Another noteworthy trend is the decrease of RBulk as the cocatalyst annealing temperature increases from 200 °C to 400 °C, which correlates nicely with the increasing trend of the photocurrent in this range of annealing temperatures (Fig. 7). This may be explained by enhanced charge transport properties, due to reduced charge recombination as a result of the larger crystallite size of the cocatalyst film (as deduced from XRD data, Fig. 2).
In comparison, the EIS data indicate a significant increase in both RCT and RBulk, and a huge decrease in the CPECT value for highly crystalline cocatalysts annealed at 500 °C, corresponding to a significant decrease in photocurrent (Fig. 7). The drop in CPECT is especially significant, from 126 μF to 5.15 μF when comparing cocatalysts annealed at 400 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The lower CPECT value shows that the highly crystalline cocatalyst has a lower density of surface states while the higher RCT indicates poorer charge transfer efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This corroborates with our earlier claim that highly crystalline cocatalysts exhibit a lower density of unsaturated surface sites that are catalytically active. In addition to the decrease in surface sites, the increase in the crystallite size for Co3O4, as calculated using Scherrer's equation, also contributes to the poorer charge transfer properties due to a decrease in the surface area.
On the other hand, the higher RBulk indicates inefficient charge transfer between the highly crystalline cocatalyst and the WO3 film. Indeed, the bulk resistance increases dramatically from 43 Ω to 351 Ω when comparing cocatalysts annealed at 400 °C and 500 °C. In order to understand this, we examined the band alignment between the WO3 and the cocatalyst. From Fig. 9, which shows the relative conduction and valance band edge positions of Co3O4 and WO3 as obtained from the literature,21,22 it can be seen that the Co3O4 cocatalyst forms an unfavourable Type I heterojunction with the WO3 film. This encourages the recombination of charge carriers upon charge transfer and can lead to high bulk resistance. It should be noted, however, that this is applicable only to highly crystalline materials that exhibit band transport and have well-defined energy bands. In contrast, charge transport in disordered amorphous semiconductors or nanocrystalline materials is typically described using a variable-range hopping model,34 and thus is less affected by the effect of the unfavourable band alignment. We believe that this is likely the reason for the increase in bulk resistance upon improvement in cocatalyst crystallinity. Thus, due to poorer charge transfer efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface and unfavourable energy band alignment of the cocatalysts with WO3, the formation of a crystalline cocatalyst film has a detrimental effect on the generated photocurrent.

Using amorphous Co3O4 annealed at 350 °C as the cocatalyst film, the H2 and O2 gas evolution rate from the water splitting process was measured. Fig. 10 shows the H2 and O2 gas evolution of WO3 and Co3O4/WO3 films as a function of time. A linear gas evolution curve is observed which indicates that the photocorrosion of Co3O4/WO3 did not take place. From the gradient of the gas evolution curve, the bare WO3 film shows a H2 evolution rate of 3.2 μmol h−1 and an O2 evolution rate of 1.5 μmol h−1. This corresponds to a H2:O2 ratio of 2.13 which is close to the stoichiometry ratio of water splitting. On the other hand, the Co3O4/WO3 film has a higher gas evolution rate with its H2 evolution rate at 34% higher than that of the WO3 film. The H2 and O2 evolution rate of the Co3O4/WO3 film is 4.3 μmol h−1 and 1.9 μmol h−1 respectively. From the amount of gas evolved and the measured photocurrent, the Faradaic efficiency of the reaction is calculated using eqn (3):35,36 Faradaic efficiency = (nH2)/(Q/zF)(3)where nH2 is the number of moles of hydrogen gas obtained, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1), Q is the total amount of charge passed through the cell, and z is the number of electrons transferred per hydrogen molecule (which is equal to 2). The total number of moles of hydrogen obtained from a 4 hour illumination period is 17.3 μmol at an average photocurrent of 0.256 mA. Thus, nH2 = 1.73 × 10−5 mol and Q = 0.256 mA × 4 × 3600 s = 3.69 C. Plugging the above values into the equation, we obtained a high Faradaic efficiency of 90.0% for the Co3O4/WO3 film. This is a typical value for water splitting with the PEC cell, and the less than unity efficiency can be explained by the back reaction occurring at the platinum counter electrode.37 The gas evolution analysis confirms that the higher photocurrent led to higher gas evolution.

4. Conclusions
The Co3O4 cocatalyst enhances the photocatalytic properties of WO3 at low annealing temperatures before the onset of crystallinity. The highest enhancement attained shows an increase of 40% in PEC properties and 34% in H2 gas evolution. The superior performance of Co3O4 is attributed to its excellent charge transfer properties, from the photocatalyst to the electrolyte, which is indicative of high catalytic activity. The enhancement indicates the beneficial effects of an amorphous cocatalyst in improving the efficiency of the photocatalytic water splitting process. At higher annealing temperatures, we conclude based on the EIS data that the reduction of unsaturated active surface sites as well as a mismatch of the band structure between the crystalline cocatalyst and the WO3 led to a deterioration of the generated photocurrent. These results help in explaining the superior catalytic performance of the amorphous cocatalyst, as well as in elucidating the role played by cocatalysts in the photocatalytic water splitting process.
