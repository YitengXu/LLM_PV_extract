    AbstractTo enhance the long stability of sulfur cathode for a high energy lithium–sulfur battery system, a sulfur–carbon sphere composite was prepared by encapsulating sulfur into micropores of carbon spheres by thermal treatment of a mixture of sublimed sulfur and carbon spheres. The elemental sulfur exists as a highly dispersed state inside the micropores of carbon spheres with a large surface area and a narrow pore distribution, based on the analyses of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), thermogravimetry (TG) and local element line-scanning. It is demonstrated from galvanostatic discharge–charge process, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) that the sulfur–carbon sphere composite has a large reversible capacity and an excellent high rate discharge capability as cathode materials. In particular, the sulfur–carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur presents a long electrochemical stability up to 500 cycles, based on the constrained electrochemical reaction inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres due to strong adsorption. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction constrained inside the micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhanced long stability of the sulfur cathode. The knowledge acquired in this study is important not only for the design of efficient new electrode materials, but also for understanding the effect of the micropores on the electrochemical cycle stability.

Broader context
Rechargeable batteries are the most efficient devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Among all the redox couples for rechargeable batteries, the lithium–sulfur couple has the potential to offer a practical energy density doubling the present commercial lithium-ion batteries due to the high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1. Moreover, sulfur has some advantages of the natural abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of the lithium–sulfur battery with organic electrolytes is highly limited on the basis of the low utilization and poor cycle life of the sulfur cathode, because of the highly insulating nature of sulfur and the high solubility of lithium polysulfides as intermediate products generated during the electrochemical reaction process. To reach the long stability of the sulfur cathode, we present a sulfur–carbon sphere composite, prepared by encapsulating sulfur into micropores of carbon spheres, which has a large reversible capacity, an excellent high rate discharge capability and an enhanced long electrochemical stability up to 500 cycles. The electrochemical reaction constrained inside the micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhanced long stability of the sulfur cathode.

Introduction
The development of high energy density rechargeable batteries becomes more and more important for clean and efficient energy storage and conversion technologies, such as modern communication devices, electric vehicles (EVs), and electrical storage from wind and solar power.1 As a representative of high energy batteries developed in the past, lithium ion batteries with intercalation compounds as cathode materials have achieved a specific energy density of 150–200 Wh kg−1, which is only one-third of the theoretical energy density of 568 Wh kg−1. It should be noted that it is difficult to upgrade the electrochemical reversible capacity of such transition metal intercalation compounds due to the heavy weight and the limited lithium intercalation (corresponding to one electron or less than one electron reactions). Therefore, it is essential to explore new cathodes with higher specific capacity to increase the energy density of battery system, based on light-weight elements and multi-electron reactions.2
Sulfur is a light-weight element as a cathode material which can react with metallic lithium to form Li2S with a two-electron reaction, leading to the high theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh g−1 and the high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1 in a lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery.3–6 Besides, sulfur has an advantage of natural abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness.3,7 Therefore, sulfur becomes a promising cathode material for the next generation of high energy density rechargeable batteries. The pioneering work by Rauh et al.3 showed that the energy density of 300 Wh kg−1 was possible using a standard Li/S cell design. The energy density of Li/S cells could be increased to 730 Wh kg−1 as presented by Yamin and Peled.6 Moreover, Kavan et al.8 reported that 175 mAh g−1 of the C(S) active material was available in the first discharge after attaching 29% sulfur to the special carbon materials. However, the actual challenge lies in obtaining the electrochemical cycle stability of sulfur cathode, which is the most important factor for practical rechargeable batteries. The problems of the sulfur cathode are mainly attributed to the highly electrical insulating nature of sulfur (5 × 10−30 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and the high solubility of lithium polysulfides as intermediate products generated during the electrochemical reduction process in organic electrolyte.3,9 More severely, the soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides can be reduced with the metal lithium anode in a parasitic reaction, accompanied by a shuttle mechanism.10 Meanwhile, the reduced lithium polysulfides can also diffuse back to the anode in the following oxidation process, leading to the serious lithium anode corrosion and the low coulombic efficiency. Moreover, further reduction of lithium polysulfides leads to the formation of insulated Li2S on the cathode surface. As a result, the poor cycle stability of the sulfur cathode is generally observed due to the solubility of lithium polysulfides in organic electrolyte and gradual aggregation of insulated Li2S on the cathode surface.6,11
In order to overcome the problems, several technological contributions were attempted, including the optimization of the organic electrolyte with introducing room temperature ionic liquid,12,13 the preparation of the sulfur-conductive polymer composites,14 and the fabrication of the sulfur–carbon composites.7,13,15–19 In particular, carbon materials are proved to be effective and facile candidates to improve the sulfur utilization and restrain the solubility of lithium polysulfides due to its excellent conductivity, large surface area, narrow pores, and low cost as conductive matrix and strong adsorbent agents. Furthermore, to meet commercial requirements in the future, the high tap density of carbon materials should be more favorable, instead of highly porous carbon or carbon black with a low density. Therefore, spherical carbon as an electrically conductive matrix is considered to the improvement of volume energy capacity of the sulfur cathode.
In this work, elemental sulfur was encapsulated into the narrow micropores of carbon spheres by thermal treatment of a mixture of sublimed sulfur and carbon spheres. It is believed that the electrochemical reaction of the sulfur cathode can be constrained inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres, and correspondingly long electrochemical stability of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite could be obtained.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization of carbon spheres and the sulfur–carbon sphere composite
Sucrose, the carbon source, was dissolved in 6 M sulfuric acid to form 5% sucrose solution, which was placed in round bottom flask and refluxed at 120 °C for 10 h. The resulting black suspension was filtered and washed by distilled water. The product was dried at 100 °C in air for 24 h, and then calcined at 1000 °C for 2 h with heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under flowing argon atmosphere. The prepared carbon spheres (0.05 g) were mixed with 0.25 g of the sublimed sulfur (Fuchen Chemical, Tianjin). The mixture was heated at 149 °C for 6 h in a sealed vessel filled with argon gas. At this temperature, the melt sulfur with the lowest viscosity (0.00709 Pa s)20 can easily diffuse into the micropores of carbon spheres. Then, the temperature was increased to and kept at 300 °C for 2 h to vaporize the superfluous sulfur on the outer surface of carbon spheres diffusing entirely into the pores. After cooling down to room temperature, the sulfur–carbon composite was obtained. The sulfur content in the composite, calculated by the mass change before and after the formation of the composite, is 42 wt%. The characterization of the carbon spheres and sulfur–carbon sphere composite was measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU D/Max-2500), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai 20, FEI Tecnai F20), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micromeritics ASAP2020). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was performed in Tecnai F20 using a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector, coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The carbon and sulfur line-scanning distribution of the sulfur/carbon composite was conducted by the local chemical analysis, performed by STEM-EDX with a HAADF detector.
Electrochemical measurement
The sulfur–carbon sphere composite was mixed with acetylene black and polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) in a weight ratio of 70:20:10, with ethanol as a dispersant. The paste was pressed into a film with a roller. The obtained film was cut into a disk of 0.5 cm2 in apparent area and approximately 2.5 mg in weight. The film disks were dried at 50 °C for 24 h before use. The half-cells were assembled in a glove box filled with high pure Ar. Lithium metal was used as the counter electrode and reference electrode. The separator was microporous polypropylene (Celgard 2300). The commercial electrolyte was 1M LiPF6 PC-EC-DEC (1:4:5, v/v/v), purchased from the Performance Materials Company (Ferro, Suzhou). The charge and discharge performance of the half-cells was tested with LAND CT-2001A instrument (Wuhan, China), and potential range was controlled between 1.0 and 3.0 V at ambient temperature. The specific capacity was calculated on the basis of the active sulfur material. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a Zahner IM6ex electrochemical workstation over frequency ranges from 100 kHz to 10 mHz. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was conducted with a CHI 600A electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Structure characterization
As shown in Fig. 1, carbon materials have a sphere-like morphology with a size range from 200 to 300 nm. A porous structure with small pore sizes can be observed in the TEM image (Fig. 1b). The developed porous structure is beneficial for the diffusion of the melted sulfur and the sulfur gas adsorption during thermal treatment process, and the access connection of the electrolyte throughout the porous structure of carbon spheres during cycling. The overall contact of carbon spheres with a partial graphite structure may ensure good electronic conductivity, and the micropores of carbon spheres as microporous reactors can restrict the dissolution of lithium polysulfides in organic electrolyte due to strong adsorption.

The specific surface area analysis of carbon spheres and sulfur–carbon spheres composite was performed by nitrogen BET adsorption measurements. The pore size distribution of carbon spheres was calculated by the Horvath–Kawazoe method. A Type I isotherm (a Langmuir-type isotherm) is shown in Fig. 2a, indicating the characteristic microporous structure of carbon spheres.21 The carbon spheres have a narrow micropore size distribution of about 0.7 nm, coincident with the observation in the HRTEM image, in which the micropore size is less than 1.5 nm (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, the large specific surface area of 843.5 m2 g−1 is dominated by the micropores, formed by carbonizing an aqueous solution of sucrose in the presence of sulfuric acid.22 At high-temperature, melt or amorphous state elemental sulfur is in a linear chain configuration.23 Therefore, the narrow micropores of carbon spheres can accommodate several S8 crown rings or/and short chains of elemental sulfur in the low-molecular forms,24,25 which can ensure a high dispersion of elemental sulfur inside the micropores. After loading 42 wt% sulfur into carbon spheres, the surface area of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite is sharply reduced to 6.5 m2 g−1. Apparently, the embedding of sulfur into the micropores of carbon spheres contributes to such a significant decrease of the surface area, due to a strong adsorption and retention of elemental sulfur in the micropores.25,26 It is also indicated from the BET result that the micropore volume is completely filled up when the sulfur loading is 42 wt%, similar to the result of mesoporous activated carbons.19 Although the micropores are filled with sulfur, open pore mouths of carbon sphere can be also observed from the TEM image (Fig. 1c). In particular, these two images (Fig. 1d and 1c) show an undistinguishable difference in the surface morphology because the sulfur exists inside the micropores,19 indicating further that the serious surface deposition and aggregation of sulfur with a particle size larger than 1.5 nm is negligible.19,24 The alternating elemental composition change of carbon and sulfur elements is also detected across a selected area of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite by the local chemical analysis performed by STEM-EDX (Fig. 1d and 1f), confirming the highly dispersed sulfur inside the narrow micropores. However, more loading of elemental sulfur in the low-molecular forms could lead to the pore-narrowing or full saturation of the micropore volume of carbon spheres,24,25 because the theoretical loading is 49.5 wt% sulfur based on the total pore volume of carbon spheres (0.474 cm3 g−1) and the density of elemental sulfur (2.07 g cm−3 for the alpha phase, at room temperature). As a result (as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1b†), the utilization of the active sulfur is much lower and there is no flat discharge plateau for the sulfur–carbon sphere composite with 51 wt% sulfur at the low current density of 40 mA g−1 due to the pore-narrowing and full saturation of the micropores, which prevent passage of solvated electrolyte molecules.24 Therefore, the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the sample with 42 wt% S were investigated in detail.

XRD patterns of the sublimed sulfur, carbon spheres and sulfur–carbon spheres composite are shown in Fig. 4. The sharp diffraction peaks denote that sulfur exists in a crystalline state, while the broad diffraction peak appears at about 24°, indicating the amorphous characteristic of carbon spheres. After encapsulating sulfur into the micropores of carbon spheres, the sharp diffraction peaks of bulk crystalline sulfur disappear entirely, further demonstrating that sulfur exists as a highly dispersed state with a low-molecular monolayered coverage inside the micropores of carbon spheres.17,25 Such a highly dispersed state may also result in the good electric conductivity of the composite cathode. Furthermore, in the case of carbon spheres treated with sulfuric acid, the possible existence of some sulfur groups on the carbon surface can be eliminated subsequently at the high calcination temperature of 1000 °C under argon atmosphere.27

Electrochemical performance
The typical discharge and charge curves of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur at the current density of 400 mA g−1 from the 1st to the 3rd cycle are presented in Fig. 5. The initial discharge capacity of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur is 1180 mAh g−1 at the current density of 400 mA g−1. After the initial cycle, the composite shows a good electrochemical reversibility with the reversible capacity of about 820 mAh g−1 in the 2nd cycle. At the low current density of 40 mA g−1, the larger initial discharge capacity of 1333 mAh g−1 (near 80% of the theoretical capacity) and reversible capacity of 1006 mAh g−1 are presented with good cycle stability (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 5  Typical discharge and charge curves of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur at the large current density of 400 mA g−1. 
The small pores of carbon spheres are capable of the transport of solvated electrolyte and lithium ions,28 which is essential to ensure the high reversible capacity of the sulfur cathode. Theoretically, there are two potential plateaus at about 2.4 V and 2.1 V (vs. Li+/Li, depending on the current density), respectively, corresponding to the two-step reaction of sulfur with lithium.10 However, the upper very shorter potential plateau (2.25 V, vs. Li+/Li) of the sulfur–carbon sphere composite almost disappears during the initial discharge process, while only the low potential plateau of about 1.8 V (vs. Li+/Li) is presented in the 2nd cycle at the current density of 400 mA g−1. The low potential plateau with the sulfur embedded the narrow pores of carbon spheres lies within the fact that the electrochemical reaction during the discharge process needs to overcome the absorbing energy, leading to such a discharge potential hysteresis. This phenomenon can be also observed previously in conductive polymer/sulfur composite materials and sulfur–carbon nano-composites,29,30 but is different from a higher potential plateau of the sulfur loaded on mesoporous carbon matrix with a weak adsorption capability of the soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides. It is also noted that the low-molecular forms of elemental sulfur with a highly dispersion state and a short chain configuration inside the narrow micropores are unstable due to their high energy state (low potential difference versus metallic lithium) as compared to large molecules of elemental sulfur with crown rings,25,31 on the other hand, which may also result in above discharge potential hysteresis. A more serious discharge potential hysteresis can be observed for the composite with 51 wt% sulfur due to the pore-narrowing and full saturation of the micropores, leading to a very low utilization of the active sulfur (Fig. S1†). Such a low utilization was also demonstrated previously for the S–C composites with higher sulfur loading, although their discharge potential plateau was higher due to a large coverage of the active sulfur on the mesoporous carbon.16,17 On the contrary, there is a very shorter upper potential plateau in the initial discharge process if a trace of sulfur covers the carbon sphere surface without overcoming the absorbing energy.30 Thus, it is suggested from the electrochemical result that almost all the sulfur can be loaded into the micropores of carbon spheres with only a trace of residual sulfur on the surface of carbon spheres. It is also found in cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 6) that the small cathodic peak potential at 2.4 V (vs. Li+/Li) disappears completely after the first cycle because of the dissolution of a trace of sulfur on the carbon sphere surface in electrolyte, further confirming that sulfur is almost loaded inside the micropores of carbon spheres. In addition, the cathodic peak potential at the second cycle is moved up to 1.82 V (vs Li+/Li) from 1.54 V (vs Li+/Li) in the first cycle, further confirming the obvious discharge potential change between the first and second cycle as shown in Fig. 5. This potential shifting is mainly attributed to the formation of the complexes with lower absorbing energy after the first cycle.30 In agreement with the good reversibility as shown in Fig. 5, the anodic peak current and potential are stable, confirming the stable existence of the low-molecular elemental sulfur and lithium polysulfides in the narrow micropores of carbon spheres in organic electrolyte, which is crucial for stabilizing the electrochemical cycle performance of the sulfur cathode.

As anticipated, the sulfur–carbon sphere composite represents an excellent cycle performance at different current densities as shown in Fig. 7. The reversible capacity at the low current density of 200 mA g−1 is 890 mAh g−1 after the initial discharge process. The large reversible capacity of 730 mAh g−1 is still obtained at the high current density of 1200 mA g−1, owing to the good electrical conductivity of carbon spheres as matrix to support the highly dispersed sulfur. Moreover, the discharge capacity can be recovered when the current density is decreased again from 1200 mA g−1 to 200 mA g−1, showing a great merit for an abuse tolerance of Li–S battery with varied current densities. The discharge-charge efficiency at the current density of 400 mA g−1 is almost identical to 100% except for the initial cycle (Fig. 7b). Significantly, the reversible capacity retention is over 80% at the current density of 400 mA g−1 after 500 cycles as presented in an inset of Fig. 7b. Therefore, it is promising from this result that the enhancement of the long electrochemical stability of the sulfur cathode can be achieved by encapsulating sulfur into the narrow micropores of carbon spheres.

The long cycle life of the composite at the current density of 400 mA g−1 is inserted in Fig. 6b. 
Although the solubility and mass loss of active materials have a great impact on the long stability of the sulfur cathode, the cycle performance of the sulfur cathode is also related to the interface reaction of the electrode due to a serious aggregation of insulated Li2S on the cathode surface during cycling.32 To get further insight into the interface charge-transfer resistance, electrochemical impedance spectra of the sulfur–carbon sphere after different cycles are measured and presented in Fig. 8. As inserted in Fig. 8, the spectra consist of two semicircles and a straight line in the low frequency region. The semicircle in the low frequency region is related to the interface charge-transfer process of the sulfur–carbon sphere cathode induced by the formation of an insulating layer of lithium sulfide (Li2S).9,33 The charge-transfer resistances (Rct) simulated from the equivalent circuits are 5.95, 9.50, 7.82 and 11.36 Ω after the 1st, 20th, 50th, and 100th cycles, respectively. Obviously, the charge-transfer resistances of the cathode are changed moderately during long cycling, as compared to the huge charge-transfer resistance (876.7 Ω) of the composite with 51 wt% sulfur (Fig. 9). Therefore, the formation of the insulating layer of Li2S on the surface of the composite with 42 wt% sulfur is negligible. In addition, the diffusion impedance (W1) tends to decrease slightly from 0.0116 Ω (1st cycle) to 0.0141 Ω (20th cycle), 0.0096 Ω (50th cycle) and 0.0041 Ω (100th cycle), which is much smaller than that (1.59 Ω) of the composite with 51 wt% sulfur (Fig. 9). Accordingly, it can be verified that the electrochemical reaction process can be constrained inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres without covering insulated Li2S on the surface of carbon spheres, while lithium ions freely diffuse in and out the micropores for the composite with 42 wt% sulfur.

The inset is the equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance spectrum. The simulated charge-transfer resistances (Rct) and the diffusion impedance (W1) are 876.7 Ω and 1.59 Ω, respectively. 
The electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode is influenced by many factors, including conductive matrix, binders, new electrolyte and modified lithium electrode.34 Apparently, the unique micro-porous structure of carbon spheres as conductive matrix is the key issue for improving the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode. Generally, the strong adsorption is governed by the dispersive physical interactions in the microporous network of carbon spheres.35 Narrow micropores (∼0.7 nm) are an important factor governing the gas storage and adsorption capability of sulfur-containing compounds on porous carbons, independent of surface area and total pore volume.36 Therefore, the high dispersion of elemental sulfur inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres is beneficial to the excellent high rate discharge capability of the sulfur cathode owing to the good electrical conductivity of carbon spheres. Importantly, the narrow micropores of carbon spheres can trap stably elemental sulfur and subsequent lithium polysulfides during cycling due to such a strong adsorption, avoiding the shuttle reaction, mass loss of the active materials and the formation of the thicker Li2S insulating layer on the composite surface. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction constrained only inside the narrow micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhancement of the long electrochemical stability of the sulfur cathode (Fig. 10). Further exploration and development of sulfur cathode composites would be helpful to fabricate high energy rechargeable battery system.37

Conclusions
In summary, after thermal treatment of a mixture of sublimed sulfur and carbon spheres, elemental sulfur was encapsulated into the narrow micropores of carbon spheres in the highly dispersed state. Once loading into carbon spheres, sulfur or lithium polysulfides are difficult to release from the narrow micropores. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction process of the sulfur cathode can be constrained inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres, resulting in the good reversibility and excellent high rate discharge capability of the composite. In particular, the sulfur–carbon spheres composite with 42 wt% sulfur presents the large reversible capacity of about 650 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at current density of 400 mA g−1. It is concluded that the long electrochemical stability of sulfur cathode can be enhanced significantly by encapsulating sulfur into narrow micropores of carbon spheres. The same strategy adapted in this study could be helpful to explore and develop new electrode materials with a poor electric conductivity or higher solubility of intermediate products generated during the electrochemical process in organic electrolyte, such as metal chlorides.

Broader context
Rechargeable batteries are the most efficient devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Among all the redox couples for rechargeable batteries, the lithium–sulfur couple has the potential to offer a practical energy density doubling the present commercial lithium-ion batteries due to the high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1. Moreover, sulfur has some advantages of the natural abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of the lithium–sulfur battery with organic electrolytes is highly limited on the basis of the low utilization and poor cycle life of the sulfur cathode, because of the highly insulating nature of sulfur and the high solubility of lithium polysulfides as intermediate products generated during the electrochemical reaction process. To reach the long stability of the sulfur cathode, we present a sulfur–carbon sphere composite, prepared by encapsulating sulfur into micropores of carbon spheres, which has a large reversible capacity, an excellent high rate discharge capability and an enhanced long electrochemical stability up to 500 cycles. The electrochemical reaction constrained inside the micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhanced long stability of the sulfur cathode.
