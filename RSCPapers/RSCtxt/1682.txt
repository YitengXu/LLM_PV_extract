    , Accepted 6th October 2016First published on 7th October 2016AbstractThe importance of conductive polymer electrodes with a balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity for flexible organic photovoltaic properties has been demonstrated. Highly transparent PEDOT:PSS anodes with controlled conductivity and surface properties were realized by insertion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a fluorosurfactant (Zonyl) as efficient additives and used for flexible organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) which are based on a bulk-heterojunction of polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We investigated the correlation between the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS electrodes and their influences on the surface morphology of the active materials (PTB7:PC71BM). When the device was prepared from the PEDOT:PSS layer functioning as an anode of OPV through an optimized ratio of 5 vol% of DMSO and 0.1 wt% of fluorosurfactant, the devices exhibited improved fill factor (FF) due to the enhanced coverage of PEDOT:PSS films. These results correlate with reduced photoluminescence and increased charge extraction as seen through Raman spectroscopy and electrical analysis, respectively. The conductive polymer electrode with the balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity can be a useful replacement for brittle electrodes such as those made of indium tin oxide (ITO) as they are more resistant to cracking and bending conditions, which will contribute to the long-term operation of flexible devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have attracted interest owing to the increasing importance of renewable energy technology.1,2 However, high-efficiency OPVs have mostly been fabricated with inflexible electrodes and substrates, such as indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO has been used as a transparent conductive electrode (TCE) in organic electronics because it has excellent optoelectronic properties: a transparency of 90% with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω cm−2.3 While OPVs have the potential to be flexible, low-cost, and large-area devices fabricated in a solution process,4–6 ITO has three representative disadvantages that disrupt the potential applications of flexible organic electronics. One of the disadvantages is that ITO is expensive because of a shortage of indium, so the use of ITO is not suitable for low-cost and large-area OPVs. Another is that it is impossible to form ITO films using a solution process, thus also making ITO unsuitable for construction of low-cost OPVs. The third disadvantage is that ITO is brittle,7 making for inflexible devices. A conducting polymer is a good alternative to the conventional TCE owing to several beneficial properties, therefore it has been studied recently.8,9
A conducting polymer is an attractive material for the formation of an electrode layer in OPVs, organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of its optical properties10 and low sheet resistances.11,12 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the promising conducting polymers; it has been extensively used for flexible devices because of its work function, optical transmittance, relatively high electrical conductivity, and the ability to form layers in a solution process.13,14 In spite of the remarkable properties of PEDOT:PSS, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is lower than that of ITO electrodes. In order to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, recent studies applied additives, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),15,16N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),17 and ethylene glycol (EG)18etc. PEDOT:PSS with 5 vol% DMSO had a conductivity of approximately 1000 S cm−1, since DMSO brought about a segregation of PEDOT grains by acting as a secondary dopant, leading to the formation of a better conducting pathway.19
In addition to the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, low adhesion of PEDOT:PSS has been a major issue, since it results in reduced mechanical flexibility, coverage, and conductivity.20 In order to ameliorate the adhesion of PEDOT:PSS, a fluorosurfactant (Zonyl) was added to PEDOT:PSS.21 The addition of Zonyl improved the adhesion of PEDOT:PSS to a substrate owing to its amphiphilic nature, and also improved its conductivity by rearranging PEDOT regions.20 However, the reasons for the alterations in mechanical properties and conductivity brought about by Zonyl remain unclear. Thus, more observation of the effects of Zonyl is needed for optimizing flexible electrodes.
In this research, we have successfully coated PEDOT:PSS TCEs with sheet resistance values of 42.8 Ω cm−2 and 61.1 Ω cm−2, respectively, by adding DMSO and Zonyl with controlled PEDOT:PSS thicknesses, and also maintaining a transparency comparable to that of the ITO. Then it was adapted to fabricate flexible OPV devices based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)22,23 bulk-heterojunction (BHJ). To clarify the effect of Zonyl, morphological and optical analyses of PEDOT:PSS film were conducted by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the charge generation and collection properties have been investigated by using photocurrent density characteristics. The flexible OPVs fabricated with the optimized PEDOT:PSS anode revealed improved stability of open circuit voltage (VOC) compared to the current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) after the bending test.
Experimental
Conductive flexible electrode
We used commercial PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS PH 1000) and controlled the conductivity of the flexible electrode.24 The PEDOT:PSS was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. 5% DMSO by volume ratio and different concentrations of Zonyl (Zonyl FSO fluorosurfactant, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the PEDOT:PSS solution. The solution was sonicated for 10 min to obtain a more homogenous solution and then it was spin-coated on a polycarbonate (PC) substrate. After that, the substrate was annealed in air for 10 min at 130 °C. To form multilayer films, the process was repeated after the annealing process ended. Finally, the thicknesses of 1-layer, 2-layer and 3-layer coated PEDOT:PSS are approximately 80 nm, 120 nm, and 140 nm, respectively.
Device Fabrication
OPVs based on the PTB7:PC71BM bulk heterojunctions were fabricated on PC/PEDOT:PSS substrates. PEDOT-PSS (AI4083), which is commonly used as a hole transporting material due to its suitability,25 was then spin-coated on the top of the PC/PEDOT:PSS substrates (thickness of ∼40 nm). The substrate was dried at 140 °C for 10 min in air. After annealing, an anode line was defined using a silver paste and then transferred to a glove box. To prepare the PTB7:PC71BM solution, PTB7:PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1.5 at a concentration of 25 mg ml−1 was added to chlorobenzene (CB) with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (3 vol%). After the active layer was formed on the PEDOT:PSS layer, a TiOx layer with ∼10 nm was then spin-coated onto the active layer for the electron transport layer. Subsequently, a metal cathode (Al) was deposited with a thickness of ∼100 nm under a pressure of 4.0 × 10−6 Torr, using a thermal evaporator.
Measurement and characterization
The sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS films was measured using four-point probes (FPP-400, Dasol eng., Korea). The surface morphology and roughness of the PEDOT:PSS films without and with Zonyl and the multilayer films were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Park NX10), using non-contact mode. The device electrical performance of the organic solar cells was measured using a solar simulator with Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and the current density–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured using ZIVE SP1. The total cell area was 0.15 cm2. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the solar cells were recorded after power calibration (ABET Technologies, Inc., LS150, USA) with a monochromator (DONGWOO OPTRON Co., Ltd, MonoRa-500i, Korea) in order to prove the short-circuit current of JSC related to the J–V curves. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Raman microscope (Xperam200 (Nanobase. inc)) using PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS PH 1000) without and with Zonyl/PEDOT:PSS (AI4083)/PTB7:PC71BM BHJ. The laser wavelength was 532 nm and the power was 2 mW for each device. The magnification of the objective lens was 40×. We calculated an average of ten datasets of Raman spectra in the same position for each sample. The Raman imaging results were obtained from 20 μm × 20 μm samples (1 pixel = 0.5 μm). UV-vis absorption spectra of the active layer were recorded (Biomate 3S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo scientific, USA).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the structure of the flexible device made from PTB7:PC71BM BHJ based on a highly transparent PEDOT:PSS anode with the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Zonyl. Recent studies have reported that DMSO and Zonyl improved the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS owing to the phase segregation of PEDOT:PSS, which seems to have an influence on its performance. The inset in Fig. 1b also shows the energy levels of each component material. We fabricated a PTB7:PC71BM BHJ device based on a glass/ITO substrate in order to compare the flexible device with the conductive polymer anode.

Previous research showed that DMSO improved the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS enormously when used at adequate concentrations. When using PEDOT:PSS in a flexible device, we have to confirm the effect of additives in detail. Fig. 2 shows the measured sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS films as a ratio of additives, DMSO (1, 5, and 10 vol%) and Zonyl (0, 0.1, and 0.2 wt%). The sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS decreased by insertion of DMSO which leads to the growth of conductive PEDOT grains and improved charge carrier mobility.19 1 vol% of DMSO was insufficient to show distinguished resistance reduction, while 5 vol% of DMSO decreased the sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS up to 210 Ω cm−2. However, when over 10 vol% was used, the PEDOT grains exhibited already maximized conduction and excess DMSO could give rise to the defect sites between the PEDOT and PSS region interfaces, which showed a sheet resistance of 421 Ω cm−2.19 Interestingly, a small amount of Zonyl decreased the resistance of PEDOT:PSS regardless of the DMSO concentration, and PEDOT:PSS with 0.2 wt% of Zonyl exhibited lower resistance than the other concentrations. Thus, the lowest sheet resistance of 61.8 Ω cm−2 was attained by adding 5 vol% of DMSO and 0.2 wt% of Zonyl together. Additionally, when Zonyl was over 0.2 wt%, the PEDOT:PSS was unsuitable for use as a TCE because of its high sheet resistance due to the main effect of insulating property.20 The resistance of PEDOT:PSS with 1 wt% of Zonyl was increased up to 153.1 Ω cm−2. Therefore, the addition of an adequate amount of Zonyl can enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, and then the optimized TCE will contribute to the enhanced performance of flexible devices.
 Fig. 2  The sheet resistance as DMSO (1, 5, and 10 vol%) and Zonyl (0, 0.1, and 0.2 wt%) concentrations varied. (Average values from 10 samples per condition.) 
The phase separation of PEDOT:PSS affects its conductivity to a large extent.19 The pristine PEDOT:PSS exists in a PEDOT core and a PSS shell structure.26 Since the charge is transferred through PEDOT rich grains, and not the PSS shell, the pristine PEDOT:PSS exhibits small PEDOT grains and shows low conductivity as shown in Fig. S1a.†21,27 Interestingly, when Zonyl was inserted into PEDOT:PSS this caused larger PEDOT grains and separated PSS from PEDOT, owing to the surfactant behavior of Zonyl due to which the perfluoroalkyl chains exhibit a non-sticking property and the hydroxyl chains interact with the PSS shell due to their affinity as shown in Fig. S1b.†28,29
In order to observe the phase separation of the PEDOT:PSS layer, we analyzed the AFM images of PEDOT:PSS layers with a fixed concentration of DMSO (5 vol%) and with various concentrations of Zonyl, as shown in Fig. 3. The phase segregation of PEDOT:PSS became more apparent as the concentration of Zonyl increased, and efficient pathways formed that allowed electrons to flow in the layer. Fig. 3 shows that a PEDOT:PSS layer without Zonyl had a smoother surface than did the one with nano-scale phase separation caused by Zonyl. The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer with 0.2 wt% Zonyl, which exhibited the large PEDOT-rich grains, was superior to that without Zonyl as shown in Fig. 2, 3e and f.21
 Fig. 3  Non-contact mode AFM 2D (left column) and 3D (right column) surface images of PEDOT:PSS films (a, b) without Zonyl and (c, d) with Zonyl 0.1 wt% and (e, f) 0.2 wt% (the inset shows the RMS value). All the samples were fabricated by using the PEDOT:PSS solution with 5 vol% DMSO. 
Meanwhile, other studies have not addressed the effect of Zonyl on the roughness of the active layer surface. Increased roughness contributes to a decrease in fill factor (FF).30 Considering the relationship between the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS and its morphology, it has become possible to fabricate much reproducible devices with improved efficiency and durability.

Fig. 4a and Table 1 show that a flexible device made with PTB7:PC71BM BHJ under optimized conditions, with the addition of 5 vol% DMSO and 0.1 wt% Zonyl, afforded 5.57% PCE, with a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 15.36 mA cm−2, and 50% FF, owing to the influence of morphology on the conductivity.9,31 The sheet resistance of the electrode contributed to the reduced PCE and significantly reduced the FF of the device. However, the device made with 0.1 wt% Zonyl had a higher FF compared to the other devices, which is attributable to its surface roughness. Furthermore, the device made without Zonyl exhibited a lower VOC, 0.68 V, compared to the devices made with Zonyl.

To investigate the difference of VOC as a function of Zonyl concentration, we conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. S2.† While the work function of PEDOT:PSS without Zonyl was revealed to be 4.94 eV, PEDOT:PSS with Zonyl of 1 wt% and 2 wt% exhibited 5.1 eV and 5.17 eV, respectively.32 And the deeper surface energy level of PEDOT:PSS with Zonyl resulted from the perfluoroalkyl chains of Zonyl which have great electron-withdrawing ability, and at this level formed an ohmic contact, which brought about enhanced VOC, compared to the PEDOT:PSS without Zonyl as shown in Fig. S2.†33,34 Fig. S2a† shows the scheme near the Fermi energy level of PEDOT:PSS from which the electronic structure of PEDOT:PSS is investigated. While the density of states near the Fermi-level of the PEDOT:PSS without Zonyl extend below the Fermi-level, which means the existence of the PSS shell, the states of PEDOT:PSS with Zonyl are more extended below the Fermi-level and reveal thicker PSS grains than that without Zonyl, which supports the scheme shown in Fig. S1.†35
Additionally, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) to confirm the effect of Zonyl on VOC in devices, as shown in Fig. S3.† According to the inset equation of Fig. S3,† the compensation voltage (V0) at Jph = 0 is proportional to the built-in potential (Vbi), which correlates with VOC.36 The device made with Zonyl exhibits a higher V0 (0.75 V), compared to the device without Zonyl (0.69 V), which results from the increased forward diffusion of photo-generated carriers in the device with Zonyl. Thus, the device made with Zonyl reveals superior Vbi and VOC to the device without Zonyl.
In order to further confirm the effect of Zonyl on the PEDOT:PSS electrode, Raman spectroscopy was done on the PTB7:PC71BM active layer. Fig. 5a–c show the Raman imaging results of integrated intensity in the range of 700–740 nm, which produces the strong fluorescence shown in Fig. 5d.37,38 It shows the single peak of the PTB7:PC71BM blend on the PEDOT:PSS anode with varying concentrations of Zonyl. The red color indicates a relatively low fluorescence intensity, whereas yellow indicates a relatively high fluorescence intensity. The Raman imaging results are coherent across the active layer (20 μm × 20 μm), which means that the PEDOT:PSS anode formed uniformly.
 Fig. 5  Raman imaging results of PTB7:PC71BM BHJ with PEDOT:PSS anodes (a) without, and (b) with 0.1%, and (c) 0.2% Zonyl. The red region indicates lower fluorescence and the yellow region indicates higher fluorescence, respectively. The Raman spectra of PTB7:PC71BM BHJ with a PEDOT:PSS anode as the Zonyl concentration increased. Black = without; red = 0.1%; and blue = 0.2%. The laser wavelength was 532 nm; the laser power was 2 mW. (The results from 10 samples were average calculated.) 
Interestingly, the higher the concentration of Zonyl, the stronger the fluorescence of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ, which is consistent with the single peak results shown in Fig. 5d. Since the fluorescence of the active layer leads to charge recombination, a higher concentration of Zonyl can result in reduced charge generation in the active layer, which may cause reduction in JSC and FF.39,40 Consequentially, since Zonyl improves conductivity but produces an active layer with a relatively rough morphology and reduced JSC and FF because of an increase in fluorescence, PEDOT:PSS fabricated with 0.1 wt% Zonyl serves as a better transparent electrode.
The sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS with the addition of DMSO and Zonyl was relatively enhanced (88.5 Ω cm−2) compared to the resistance of ITO (15 Ω cm−2). Since a lower resistance is needed than that in a single PEDOT:PSS layer, in order to obtain a PCE that is comparable to that of an ITO electrode, we fabricated a multilayer PEDOT:PSS anode by using a layer-by-layer spin-coating method with additives that modified the surface properties of PEDOT:PSS.20 A series of flexible devices with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer were fabricated in order to investigate the effect of the PEDOT:PSS multilayer on the photovoltaic performance. Fig. 4b and Table 2 show that the multilayer PEDOT:PSS devices exhibited obvious improvements in FF compared to single-layer devices. An increase in the sheet resistance of the electrodes (from 88.5 Ω cm−2 to 61.1 Ω cm−2) has a decisive effect on decreasing the FF (from 50% to 55%) (Fig. S4b†), which is related to the internal resistance of the device. However, when the number of PEDOT:PSS layers increased to 3 (∼140 nm), though the device then had the lowest resistance of 42.8 Ω cm−2, the FF of the device slightly decreased in comparison to that of the 2-layer (∼120 nm) device. The difference in FF between the devices with the different number of layers may originate from the morphology and coverage of PEDOT:PSS onto the substrate. We evaluated the morphology of the devices using AFM (Fig. S5†). In the AFM images (Fig. 3c, d and S2†), the 2-layer PEDOT:PSS film exhibits a smoother surface than does the single-layer film, which may lead to a well-defined next PTB7:PC71BM thin film and contribute to the uniform morphology. However, the 3-layer PEDOT:PSS film reveals a rough surface again, which brings about a slight decrease in FF. Thus, the FF of a device made with a PEDOT:PSS anode is decided by the combination of resistance and morphology of the PEDOT:PSS film. Furthermore, the JSC of the device made with PEDOT:PSS dwindled when the electrode became less transparent, as shown in Fig. S4a.† As a result, the device fabricated with a 2-layer PEDOT:PSS film was optimal. It exhibited an enhanced efficiency, 6.06%, while having a comparable IPCE value, as shown in Fig. 4c. Thus, the combination effects of sheet resistance, transparency, and morphology are important in the creation of highly efficient, flexible OPVs.

To compare the JSC of the device made with a PEDOT:PSS anode to that of an ITO-based device, we investigated the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of internal voltage (Vint) of the two devices. Jph was calculated as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Vint is calculated as Vint = VBI − Vappl, where VBI is the built-in voltage at which Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied voltage. Jph increases in proportion to voltage at low Jph, but Jph saturates at high Vint (2 V in this research), as shown in Fig. 6a.41,42 Thus, we can speculate that all carriers are collected at the electrodes in the saturated region. The saturated photocurrent (Jph,sat) of the device with a PEDOT:PSS anode (16.0 mA cm−2) is slightly higher that of the ITO-based device (15.7 mA cm−2), which is proportional to the carrier generation and related to light absorption. However, since a high Jph usually leads to an enhanced charge collection at low Vint (short-circuit condition), the device with a PEDOT:PSS anode has a slightly lower JSC than does the ITO-based device, but the two are comparable. The device with the PEDOT:PSS anode exhibited a JSC of 15.31 mA cm−2, which resulted from improved charge generation and transparency, as shown in Fig. S4a,† whereas the ITO-based device had a JSC of 15.59 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. S6.†

(b) Normalized value and the corresponding photograph of the mechanical bending test done on PTB7:PC71BM BHJ flexible OPVs with PEDOT:PSS anodes for 100 times in air without encapsulation. 

Fig. 6b shows the photovoltaic characteristics of the flexible OPV device with a PEDOT:PSS anode as a function of number of bends for 100 times without encapsulation. The PCE of the device with the optimized PEDOT:PSS anode decayed by 71% after 100 bending times with a radius of 6.5 mm and revealed great stability of open circuit voltage (VOC) compared to the reduction of the current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) which was caused by degradation of metal electrodes. Since the device with the controlled PEDOT:PSS anode exhibits remarkable flexibility, it can be used in the creation of promising flexible device applications.
Conclusions
We investigated an optimized conductive and transparent PEDOT:PSS electrode, which was developed with the use of additives, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a fluorosurfactant (Zonyl), and used it as an anode for OPVs based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Also, we studied the correlation between the bulk-heterojunction morphology of the PTB7:PC71BM and the electrical properties of the PEDOT:PSS polymer electrode. The device exhibited improved power conversion efficiency (6.06%) when the PEDOT:PSS layer was 2-layer coated (∼120 nm) when 5 vol% DMSO and 0.1 vol% Zonyl was used, because of the favorable surface of the electrode from the uniform coverage which contributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF). Such improvements correlate with decreased fluorescence and increased charge extraction in the devices, which was observed through Raman spectroscopy and electrical analysis, respectively. Moreover, the flexible OPVs with the balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS anode has an advantage of being able to bend mechanically, with 71% maintenance of PCE after 100 times bending test in air. The use of a conducting polymer based electrode can be a meaningful approach to replace brittle transparent conductive oxide (TCO) because of increased crack resistance and comparable electrical properties for the realization of flexible organic electronics.
