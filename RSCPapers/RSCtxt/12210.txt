    , Accepted 2nd August 2018First published on 2nd August 2018AbstractLead halide perovskites are a sensational class of optoelectronic materials, but they suffer from the problems of lead toxicity and poor thermal stability of organic–inorganic hybrid systems. Various lead-free metal halide double-perovskite (DP) systems are being explored as potential lead-free perovskites for optoelectronics. In these DPs, Pb2+ are replaced by equal proportions of monovalent and trivalent metal ions. In early 2018, colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) of Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) DPs were reported and, in quick succession, multiple research teams have reported the synthesis, stabilization of unusual phases, optical properties, and photocatalytic applications of DP NCs. Here, we provide the first review of DP NCs. We first summarize the progress made in this research field, and then discuss the potential future directions of DP NCs compared with their bulk counterparts.Vikash Kumar RaviVikash Kumar Ravi did his Bachelor of Science degree from Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) Mesra, Ranchi, India.

Materials beyond lead-halide perovskites
Good-quality semiconductors such as Si and GaAs with suitable bandgap hold record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.6% and 28.8%, respectively.1,2 However, the methodology for preparing good-quality Si and GaAs crystals is tedious and expensive. Conversely, easy and cost-effective solution-processed methods are employed for fabricating solar cells using molecular dyes, polymers, and quantum dots, but PCE obtained for such solar cells are typically <10 or <12%.3–5 In recent years, the advantage of low-cost solution-processed device fabrication and high PCE has been realized by developing lead halide-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. In a short time, starting from 3.8% PCE of perovskite solar cells reported in 2009,6 it has reached ∼23%.7 This success made us believe in the “defect-tolerance” of perovskites, whereby solution-processed perovskite exhibits efficient optoelectronic processes despite having reasonable defect density.8–10
Different research teams and industries are working together for commercialization of lead halides perovskite solar cells by employing different strategies for device fabrication, including tandem cells coupled with Si solar cells. Two major problems encountered in this process is poor thermal stability and the moisture stability of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites. Poor moisture stability also raises the issue of lead toxicity, which demands appropriate encapsulation of solar cells specified in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 standard.11 However, such encapsulation increases the cost of device fabrication. Also, there are strict rules regarding use of lead in some countries. Hence, discovery of a lead-free material whose electronic properties are comparable with that of lead halide perovskites would be a considerable step in commercialization.
Therefore, based on application requirements and scientific curiosity, research initiatives are being undertaken to explore new lead-free perovskite materials with promising optoelectronic properties. Table 1 shows that PCE of such lead-free solar cells is typically <3%. Sn-halide perovskites have shown promising PCE of 6.4%, but the cell degrades immediately upon exposure to ambient conditions. The major problem of replacing Pb2+ with Sn2+ or Ge2+ is the rapid oxidation of the divalent ions to tetravalent Sn4+ and Ge4+. This action destroys both the 3D ABX3 type of perovskite structure and defect tolerance because of the loss of outermost nS2 electrons.21,22 Various efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells by optimizing the film quality and device structure, adding reducing agents such as SnF2 (ref. 23) to suppress oxidation of Sn2+, and tuning the composition by adding other A or B site cations. Jokar et al.24 reported that adding as little as 1% ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDI2) can result in boosting the PCE of FASnI3 solar cells by up to 8.9% due to uniform, close-packed and pinhole-free layers and reduction of the crystal strain of FASnI3. Reports on solar cells of Sn-halide perovskite colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) are lacking but Liu et al.25 reported solar cells based on Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite NCs achieving a PCE of 2.9% using CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3 NCs. Other popular alternatives of Pb2+ are Tl+, Bi3+, and Sb3+, but in all cases the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite network of corner-shared octahedra are destroyed to maintain the charge neutrality of NCs.17,26–33 To achieve both charge neutrality and a 3D perovskite structure, Pb-free metal halide double perovskites (DPs) semiconductors have been proposed as alternative materials.34,35 As shown in Fig. 1a, the DP structures are obtained by transmuting two Pb2+ with one monovalent and one trivalent metal ion to form a general formula A2MIMIIIX6 (A = Cs+, MI = Cu+, Ag+, Na+; MIII = Bi3+, Sb3+, In3+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−). Among these combinations, Cs2AgBiX6 DPs are considered to be more probable candidates for optoelectronic applications because of possible bandgaps in the visible range and the possibility of defect-tolerance owing to the isoelectronic nature of Bi3+ with Pb2+. However, as shown in Table 1, the bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 is high with a low PCE of 2.43%. Nevertheless, a reasonably high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.98 eV is observed from Cs2AgBiBr6. Clearly, there are huge challenges to improve the PCE of DP solar cells and, in this regard, design of newer materials with narrower and direct bandgaps is the major requirement.

 Fig. 1  (a) Transformation of lead halide perovskites to halide DPs by replacement of two Pb2+ cations with M3+ and M+ cations each. (b) Summary of the aspects of DP NCs discussed here. 
One way of creating new materials is to synthesize NCs because they have been found to stabilize some crystal phases which otherwise do not become stabilized in their bulk form.36–39 At the beginning of 2018, synthesis of colloidal Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs was reported and, interestingly, Cs2AgBiI6 NCs with a lower bandgap of 1.75 eV (ref. 40 and 41) were obtained, which are thermodynamically unstable in bulk form. Compared with bulk Cs2AgBiX6, their nanocrystalline counterparts provide new chemical and physical insights and provide opportunities for applications other than solar cells. Here, we highlight newly found interesting aspects of colloidal DP NCs. As shown in Fig. 1b, we will discuss (i) insights on their synthesis and stability, (ii) developing new DP materials, (iii) electronic and optical properties, (iv) prospects for applications, and (v) conclusions and future outlook.
Colloidal synthesis of Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs
The synthetic strategy of colloidal halide DP NCs are based on two most commonly followed methods of synthesis of lead halide perovskites: (i) hot injection and (ii) re-crystallization. Creutz et al.40 synthesized colloidal Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) NCs for the first time by the rapid injection of tri-methylsilyl halide (TMS-X) into a hot solution made of Cs-acetate, Ag-acetate, Bi-acetate, oleic acid and oleylamine in 1-octadecene. This method of DP NCs synthesis requires careful stoichiometry engineering of precursors, ligand ratio, reaction time and temperature to have an impurity-free product. Furthermore, post-synthetic anion exchange of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs is carried out in toluene using TMS-iodide under an air-free environment to achieve different halide compositions. Synthetic strategies followed in the literature for the synthesis of DP NCs are summarized in Fig. 2. Also, Zhou et al.42 and Bekenstein et al.43 used different precursors (i.e. BiBr3, AgNO3 and Cs-oleate (molar ratio of 2:2:1) in 1-octadence along with a small amount of HBr) and Cs-oleate was injected at 200 °C to obtain colloidal Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs. Supposedly, HBr helps full ionization of Ag+ and thus helps in suppression of an impure product (i.e., AgBr). The resulting NCs were cubic with different mean sizes depending on the injection temperature of the precursor.
 Fig. 2  Schematic description of the methods to synthesize colloidal Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs: (a) hot injection (method-I). Representative TEM image of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs obtained using the hot-injection method with sizes ∼8 nm and ∼9.5 nm, respectively and (b) re-precipitation (method II). Representative TEM image of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs synthesized using the re-precipitation method with size ∼5 nm. TEM images of panel (a) is taken from ref. 37 (Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society) and ref. 39 (Copyright 2018, John Wiley and Sons). TEM image of panel (b) is taken from ref. 38 (Copyright 2018, John Wiley and Sons). 
In the second method, CsBr, BiBr3, and AgBr (molar ratio of 2:1:1) were dissolved in “good” solvent (i.e., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and then the mixture was added to a “bad solvent”/anti-solvent, isopropanol (with or without ligands) under vigorous stirring. It is then centrifuged to remove larger NCs and agglomerates.41 The resultant NCs were quasi-spherical with a mean size of 5 nm. Cs2AgBiX6 NCs having chloride, mixed chloride and bromide, mixed bromide and iodide, and iodide analogs were also synthesized using corresponding halide precursors.
The two synthetic methods yielded two shapes. It is difficult to decipher the exact reason for the observed shapes of DP NCs. However, similar differences in shapes under different reaction conditions have been observed for Pb-halide perovskites and other lead-free perovskite NCs.44–46 For NCs, the hypothesis is that during crystal growth, high-energy facets grow at a higher rate than low-energy facets. The different nature of interactions of organic ligands with different facets of NC surfaces influences the energetics of NC facets significantly under different conditions, resulting in a nanocrystal shape with minimum surface energy.47,48 Therefore, detailed understanding of the interactions of DP NC surfaces with their ligands is essential before attempting to understand the reasons behind stabilization of the different shapes of DPs under different reaction conditions. Similar studies49–51 on ligand interactions and shape control of CsPbX3 NCs have been carried out.
The synthesis of colloidal DP NCs has been started very recently and only Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs have been reported. There is enormous scope to prepare new-composition DP NCs, control the size and shape of NCs, prepare hetero-structures, as well as understand reaction kinetics and surface ligand binding.
Stability
Stability of metal halide perovskites is a major hurdle for practical applications. For example, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3 show impressive optoelectronic properties but exhibit poor thermal stability as they start to degrade at ∼80 °C.52 Compared with hybrid systems, all-inorganic CsPbI3 shows high thermal stability until ∼500 °C, but the optoelectronically active cubic phase is not stable <320 °C,53 hindering its application at room temperature.54,55 Swarnkar et al.56 stabilized the cubic phase of CsPbI3 by reducing the crystallite size to 3.4–12.5 nm.
Fortunately, some DPs such as Cs2AgBiBr6 easily form the optoelectronically active cubic phase at room temperature independent of the crystallite size, and are thermally stable until ∼550 °C.42 However, in Cs2AgBiX6 NCs, there is a new problem of reduction of Ag+ to Ag, which needs to be suppressed by designing appropriate reaction conditions. Excess oleylamine ligands on the surface and surrounding of NCs can act as reducing agents for conversion of Ag+ to Ag particles, which grow in size as the reaction time is increased.40,43 These Ag particles have been observed as high-contrast decorations in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images at the initial reaction time (Fig. 3a). If Ag particles come out of the NCs completely following reaction pathway (1), they leave behind two ternary compounds having a composition of CsxBiyBrz and degrade Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs completely (Fig. 3b). (1)

(b) TEM image showing Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs (blue circle) along with Ag particles (yellow circles) when Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs are decomposed completely by excess oleylamine. (c) Absorption spectra of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs (blue) after treatment of Cs2AgBiBr6 with PEt3 (violet) results in a new peak which overlaps with the peak of pure Cs3BiBr6 NCs (red). Panel (a) and (b) are adapted from ref. 40 (Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society). Panel (c) is adapted from ref. 37 (Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society). 
This problem of Ag+ reduction can be suppressed by removing unwanted excess oleylamine surface ligands by appropriate washing and making films from NCs. Such films are stable for ≥90 days if stored at ambient environment.43 Also, Cs2AgBiX6 NCs are stable in excess carboxylic acids and thiols ligands (unlike amine ligands).43 Hence, one can attempt to develop new synthetic strategies avoiding the use of amines as surface ligands to prevent the degradation of Cs2AgBiX6 NCs.
Interestingly, the reduction of Ag+ is not all bad. For example, the right-hand side of the reaction (1) shows formation of new products such as Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3BiBr6 NCs, which provide a new way to access different NCs by degradation of the Cs2AgBiBr6 DP NCs. Hence, one can design a new reaction pathway for purposeful degradation (removal of Ag+) of Cs2AgBiX6 NCs to yield Cs3BiX6 NCs and Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. For example, Ag+ can bind strongly to phosphines such as triethylphosphine (PEt3) (Fig. 3c) and can leech out Ag from the NC without losing NC structure (some degree of etching and reshaping is involved). Similarly, this methodology can be explored further for possible cation-exchange reactions in which Ag+ can be replaced with Cu+ to give new DP compositions which are otherwise hard to synthesize.
Despite the difference in compositions of Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs and CsPbX3 NCs that lead to the differences in reactivity/stability discussed above, both types of perovskite samples are ionic. Hence, dispersing both types of NCs in polar solvents such as dimethyl formamide and acetone causes rapid decomposition of the sample. Also, protonic solvents such as isobutanol can facilitate proton exchange between oleate and amine ligands, leading to detachment of ligands from the NC surface and eventual degradation of NCs. Mild polar solvents such as acetonitrile or non-protonic solvents such as ethyl acetate can be used to stabilize NCs.
Photophysical properties
The optical properties of semiconductor NCs are crucial to realize the suitability of the material for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications. Some of these relevant optical properties are optical bandgaps, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and lifetime, and ultrafast processes occurring in NCs. The photophysical properties of lead-based or lead-free halide perovskites NCs have shown certain differences with their bulk counterparts. For example, the quantum confinement effect and nearly 100% PLQY of CsPbX3 NCs,57–59 observation of band-edge (or excitonic) emission in systems such as Cs2Sb3I9 NCs30 and Cs2Bi3I9 NCs32 differ with their respective bulk counterparts. Therefore, understanding the photophysical properties of Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs in comparison with that of the respective bulk material is interesting.
The literature suggests similarities and differences between the photophysical properties of Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs prepared by method-I40 and method-II41 (see Fig. 2). Let us first discuss the results of NCs prepared by method-I. Fig. 4a and b shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of colloidal Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs at room temperature, and the respective photoluminescence (PL) spectra from films at 20 K.40 Cs2AgBiCl6 NCs exhibit a sharp absorption peak at 3.39 eV, and the peak is at 2.87 eV for Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs. Both samples show absorbance tails at lower energies, which have been attributed to the indirect bandgaps of these materials. Creutz et al.40 employed Tauc plots and estimated the indirect bandgaps of Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs to be 2.9 and 2.3 eV, respectively, which are similar to their bulk34,35 counterparts. Therefore, neither of the two NC samples show the signatures of a strong quantum confinement effect. Both samples shows sharp absorption peaks at higher energies compared with their indirect bandgap, and the absorption peaks have large extinction coefficients (∼15000 cm−1 M−1 with respect to Bi3+ concentration, or ∼3 × 107 cm−1 M−1 with respect to the NC concentration),40 suggesting that momentum is conserved during that transition. A weak PLQY (∼0.3) is observed at room temperature, which becomes more intense at 20 K. Both samples show broad emission (Fig. 4a and b) with a large Stoke's shift compared with their respective absorption spectra. At lower temperatures (82 K), a PL decay component with a long lifetime (∼1.4 μs) is observed for Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs, similar to the long lifetime exhibited by bulk samples.35

(c) Absorbance spectra of colloidal ligand-free Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs of size ∼5 nm compared with NCs when different concentrations of oleic acid (OA) are added. (d) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ligand-free Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs compared with NCs when 1% OA is added. Inset shows the dilute dispersion of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs in toluene. (e) Pseudo color transient absorption (TA) plot of colloidal Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs with 12% OA pumped at 350 nm and (f) corresponding TA spectra with delay times from 0.1 ns to 1 ns (average number of excitons per NCs, 〈N〉 ≈ 0.1). Panels (a and b) are adapted from ref. 37 (Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society). Panels (c–f) are adapted from ref. 38 (Copyright 2018, John Wiley and Sons). 
A comparison of Fig. 4b and c shows that the Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs synthesized using method-II also exhibit absorption spectra similar to that of method-I. However, unlike Creutz et al.,40 Bin et al.41 assigned the sharp absorption peak (Fig. 4c) at 440 nm (2.82 eV) as an exciton peak, and the absorption tail at lower energies involved mid-gap defect states originating from the surface defects of NCs. They showed that the absorbance of the tail part can be suppressed to some extent by passivating NC surfaces with oleic acid. However, a significant absorption tail remains even after surface passivation, possibly indicating the indirect-bandgap nature of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs, as inferred by Creutz et al. Interestingly, Bin et al. also showed a PL peak at 465 nm (Fig. 4d) for Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs, in addition to a broader PL peak at longer wavelengths.41 This peak at 465 nm was assigned to band-edge (or excitonic) emission, which is unprecedented for the corresponding bulk sample and also differs to the PL spectrum of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs prepared by method-I (Fig. 4b). It appears to us that the origin of PL from Cs2AgBiX6 NCs is controversial and further understanding is required. Also, PLQY of Cs2AgBiX6 NCs prepared by both methods is ≪1%, so one needs to carefully rule out a possible contribution to PL from molecular impurities,60 which are sometimes difficult to detect.
Femtosecond (fs) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been employed to understand the carrier dynamics in Pb-halide perovskite NCs.61–64 Likewise, Bin et al. reported the TA spectroscopy of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs (Fig. 4e and f).41 Ground state bleach (GSB) is seen at 443 nm and along with a broad photo-induced absorption (PIA) band centered at ∼520 nm. Strong PIA is also observed at wavelengths shorter than 420 nm. Dynamics of the recovery of GSB and decay of PIA bands are analyzed according to their assignment of excitonic absorption at ∼440 nm.
Overall, the optical properties DP NCs are not yet as impressive as those of lead-based perovskites. Improving the PL efficiency of these NCs will be major step for fundamental understanding and possible future applications.
Applications
Research on colloidal DP NCs has just begun. Presently, the major emphasis is on the synthesis of good-quality samples and understanding their fundamental properties. Therefore, in this sub-section, we highlight the prospect for future applications of DP NCs compared with the successful applications/properties of their bulk counterparts. Greul et al.20 reported solar cells having a PCE of 2.43% with a open voltage circuit (Voc) of 1.06 V using Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films (bulk). Similar solar cells have been reported by Pantaler et al.65 and Ning et al.66 using Cs2AgBiBr6 films. Fabrication of solar cells using DP NCs has not been reported. Synthesizing some of the proposed DPs with lower bandgaps (see the section on “Scope for new materials”) and less defect density should be the next step in advancement of these DP NCs in solar-cell applications. Importantly, we discuss the photocatalytic applications of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs that have been demonstrated.
Tang et al.67 recently used Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals (SCs) for X-ray detection having low detection limits, which is on par with X-ray detectors based on MAPbBr3 and outperforming commercial α-Se X-ray detectors.68–70 The success of Cs2AgBiBr6 as X-ray detectors relies on three properties: (i) high X-ray absorption coefficient (α), (ii) high value of product of carrier mobility (μ) and lifetime (τ), and (iii) wide bandgap yielding high resistivity, α ∝ Z4/E3 (where Z is the atomic number and E is the radiation energy). Cs2AgBiBr6 has heavy metals with an average Z value of 53.1, which is higher than that of MAPbI3 (Z = 48.9), MAPbBr3 (Z = 45.1) and α-Se (Z = 34). Therefore, Cs2AgBiBr6 has high α, attenuating 99% of the 50 keV X-ray photons with a small (1.18 mm) thickness of the material (Fig. 5a). Once the X-ray is absorbed and carriers are generated, then the detector performance relies largely on high μτ, such that the charge carriers can be collected before annihilation. Cs2AgBiBr6 has a large PL lifetime owing to their indirect bandgaps, and a reasonably high carrier mobility of 11.81 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be achieved from single crystals, yielding a high μτ. Finally, to have a better on/off ratio of the X-ray detector, the dark current should be less, which is achieved by a higher bandgap and suppressed ion migration in Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals to yield a high resistivity in the absence of X-rays. The major challenge for real-life applications will be to prepare good-quality solution-processed films of Cs2AgBiX6 with a μτ value comparable with that of the single crystal. The reported colloidal Cs2AgBiX6 NCs might play an important part in developing such solution-processed films.

Panel (b) is adapted from ref. 69 (Copyright 2018, Royal Society of Chemistry). Panel (c) is adapted from ref. 39 (Copyright 2018, John Wiley and Sons). 
A wide and indirect bandgap of Cs2AgBiX6 is a hindrance for using this material for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The bandgap of Cs2AgBiX6 DPs can be tuned by partial substitution or alloying Bi3+ with Sb3+ or In3+, but the nature of the bandgap remains indirect for the alloyed compositions as well.71 Complete substitution of Bi3+ with In3+ Cs2AgInCl6 DPs exhibit a direct but wide bandgap of 3.3 eV.72 However, other halide compositions such as Cs2AgInBr6 and Cs2AgInI6 DPs are expected to lower the bandgap, but such compositions are not stable. In such a scenario, doping these DPs can impart functionality in the visible region.73 Nandha et al.74 recently showed the first successful Mn doping in Cs2AgInCl6 DPs to yield reasonably bright orange emission (Fig. 5b). This is another direction that can be explored whereby doping of DP NCs can be employed to achieve new functionality. Careful design of such materials might be useful for LED applications.
Zhou et al.42 demonstrated the potential of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar fuels (CO and CH4). Being a greenhouse gas, CO2 reduction to fuels is attractive from the viewpoints of environmental and energy concerns. For good performance of a material for CO2 reduction, it must have appropriate energy-level alignment and be stable under prolonged light irradiation to have high activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction. Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs in ethyl acetate are used to achieve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO and CH4. After 6 h of constant irradiation (under AM 1.5 G, 150 mW cm−2), Cs2AgBiBr6 could evolve 14.1 μmol g−1 and 9.6 μmol g−1 of CO and CH4, respectively. There is no competing H2 side reaction, so the selectivity is 100%. Also, the rate of electron consumption is ∼105 μmol g−1, which is ∼19-times higher than if Cs2AgBiBr6 bulk samples are used for CO2 reduction, thus suggesting that the nanostructured particles are desirable for enhanced photocatalytic performance. The mechanism for the photoreduction of CO2 is shown is Fig. 5c.
Scope for new materials
As mentioned above, DPs with suitable bandgaps for solar-cell applications have not been prepared in the bulk phase. The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit75 or detailed balance limit gives the upper limit of the theoretical efficiency of a single-junction solar cells based on the electronic bandgap of the semiconductor material (Fig. 6a). This theoretical limit for popular bulk metal halide DP phases such as Cs2AgBiCl6, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgInCl6 is ∼6%, ∼16% and ∼2%, respectively, based on their bandgap values (Fig. 6a).76 These theoretical SQ efficiencies are very low and, of course, the experimental efficiencies of the solar cells are expected to be significantly lower than the SQ limit. In this regard, can NC synthesis provide new DP phases with desired bandgaps that is otherwise unstable in the bulk phase?

It is difficult to predict an answer to this question. However, interestingly, it has been shown in several systems that the surface chemistry and colloidal-synthesis approach can stabilize new crystallite phases which are otherwise unstable in the bulk form. One related and important example is stabilization of the cubic α-phase of CsPbI3 NCs at room temperature. In the bulk form, cubic CsPbI3 is unstable at room temperature and, therefore, solar cells cannot be made. This unusual stabilization of cubic CsPbI3 in the NC form has resulted in fabrication of efficient and relatively stable solar cells.56 To our delight, colloidal synthesis of Cs2AgBiI6 DP NCs has been reported,40,41 which could not be synthesized in the bulk form. Fig. 6b shows how the bandgap red-shifts systematically if the composition of Cs2AgBiX6 DP NCs is varied systematically from Cl to Br to I employing the synthetic method discussed in method-II (see Fig. 2). When method-I was employed for the synthesis of DP NCs, then Cs2AgBiI6 NCs can be obtained in two steps: first Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs are prepared, and then a post-anion synthetic anion-exchange method is employed to replace Br with I (Fig. 6c and d). The bandgap of Cs2AgBiI6 NCs is ∼1.75 eV,40 which suggests a theoretical SQ limit of solar-cell efficiency of ∼27%. Therefore, these newly developed Cs2AgBiI6 NCs are the most promising metal halide DPs for exploration of solar-cell properties.
There are possibilities of other DP systems as well, but the synthesis and application of these DPs have their own challenges. A2MIIIMIX6 DPs have been proposed to be classified broadly into four categories based on the combination of MIII and MI cations:77
(1) MIII = pnictogen metal (Bi3+ and Sb3+) and MI = alkali metal (Na+, K+).
(2) MIII = pnictogen metal (Bi3+ and Sb3+) and MI = post-transition metals (Tl+, In+).
(3) MIII = post-transition metal (In3+ and Ga3+) and MI = noble metals (Cu+, Ag+).
(4) MIII = pnictogen metals (Bi3+ and Sb3+) and MI = noble metals (Cu+, Ag+, Au+).
Pnictogen/alkali DPs are wide-bandgap semiconductors and thus not suitable for solar-cell applications.78,79 Pnictogen/post-transition DPs are more interesting because their electronic properties are similar to lead halide perovskites but they have toxicity problems due to Tl+, and In+ is unstable.80 Similarly, Au+-based DPs tend to undergo photoreduction,81 Cu+ does not form hexacoordinated complexes,82 and Sb3+-based DPs83 are unstable due to the small ionic radius of Sb3+. Whether some of these challenges of the synthesis of bulk DP phases be overcome by synthesizing their NCs merits further investigation.
Conclusions and future outlook
Research in DP NCs has just begun. Only one family of DP NCs, Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), has been prepared. Different methods of synthesis, anion exchange and stability-related issues have been addressed. There is plenty of scope to understand the reaction mechanism, surface chemistry, and point defects in these NCs.
The optical properties of Cs2AgBiX6 NCS are being investigated, with preliminary results41 suggesting band-edge or excitonic emissions unlike their bulk counterparts. However, we believe that the origin of PL must be understood further, along with an emphasis to enhance the PLQY. We expect more photophysical studies of DP NCs in the near future to provide better understanding of this system.
One of the most interesting research findings of DP NCs is the preparation of Cs2AgBiI6 NCs,40,41 which does not form in the bulk phase. The lower bandgap of Cs2AgBiI6 NCs can provide new opportunities for optoelectronic applications of metal halide DPs in the visible region. The major material design challenge for halide DPs is preparation of a material with low bandgap (∼1.5 eV). NC synthesis opens up a new approach to prepare such materials.
Only one application of DP NCs has been shown in terms of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.42 Relatively stable and environmentally benign metal halide compositions of DP NCs could be good candidates for such photocatalytic applications. For optoelectronic applications including solar cells, LEDs, and X-ray photodetectors, NCs can provide a solution-processed route for forming thin films of halide DPs, which is a challenge in the bulk form. In this regard, one must develop a suitable surface chemistry and film-fabrication strategies for NCs such that NCs in a film are electronically coupled with each other84 and thus provide an easier flow of charge carriers.
