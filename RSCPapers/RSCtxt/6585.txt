    , Accepted 13th April 2012First published on 17th April 2012AbstractIt is reported here that a wheat-like CdSe array on an ITO substrate has been developed by a simple electrochemical synthesis method. These samples were characterized by XRD, EDX and FESEM, whose results demonstrate that a high-purity, uniform hexagonal wheat-like CdSe array was obtained. Photoelectrochemical solar cells are constructed using the wheat-like CdSe array as the photoanode in a polysulphide electrolyte and their power output characteristics are studied. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photoelectrochemical solar cells based on the wheat-like CdSe array on an ITO substrate, which are prepared in electrolyte solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M) + Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) + H2SO4 (0.208 M), can reach a value of 1.15%.
Introduction
Quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor materials such as nanorods and nanowires have attracted great interest because of their potential applications in photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cells and application for photovoltaic cells,1–4 especially for II–VI semiconductors having a band gap energy in the visible range. CdSe is an important II–VI semiconductor solar material with an energy gap of 1.76 eV at room temperature.5 Moreover, for CdSe with a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, the (0001) facet has significantly higher surface energy than other facets, which leads to the formation of many one-dimensional nanostructures,6 although there is a slight difference in the surface energies of (110) and (100) facets.7 At present, CdSe one-dimensional semiconductor materials have been successfully synthesized by several methods, including electrodeposition,8–10 template-assisted solution chemical reaction,11 solution-liquid-solid (SLS) processes,12–14 metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)15 and catalyst-assisted syntheses of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS).16,17 These methods, especially the electrodeposition method, have achieved the controlled and designed synthesis of CdSe nanowires. It can be seen that electrochemistry is a powerful tool for making CdSe materials because the grain size can be adjusted by varying the electrochemical parameters such as bath composition, voltage, current, and temperature. Thus, tailored materials are in principle accessible by simple electrochemical procedures. For photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications, transparent conducting substrates such as indium tin oxide (ITO) are of special interest. Therefore, more and more researchers are concentrating on electrochemical deposition to fabricate patterned vertically aligned CdSe on an ITO substrate. For instance, vertically aligned CdSe nanorod arrays are fabricated on an ITO-coated glass substrate using porous aluminum oxide (PAO) as a hard template;18 they are electrodeposited directly onto the ITO substrate at the temperature of 147 °C;19 vertically aligned CdSe nanotubes have been demonstrated on ITO glass in large scale by using ZnO nanorod arrays as templates.20 Herein, it remains a great challenge to develop a simple, template-free and mild (at room temperature) electrochemical synthesis method for patterned vertically aligned CdSe semiconductor materials.
In this work, we developed a simple one-step, template-free electrochemical deposition method for wheat-like CdSe array in aqueous solution under suitable conditions. Their synthesis process is carefully studied and the photoelectrochemical properties were also investigated.
Experimental
Cadmium sulfate (3CdSO4·8H2O, 99.0%), sodium selenite (Na2SeO3, 98.0%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98.3%) were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. In a typical experiment, electrodeposition of the wheat-like CdSe array was carried out using a three-electrode system with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, an inert polished graphite plate as the counter electrode, and ITO substrate as the working electrode (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Experimental set-up diagram and schematic diagram of the wurtzite structure. The proposed electrodeposition process of the wheat-like CdSe rod shows one of the fastest growth direction of [0001] and the ±(0001) polar surfaces in the structure. The [0001] direction is parallel to the current direction, and the active (0001)-Cd polar surface induces the fastest growth along the [0001] direction of the wheat-like CdSe rod. 
Before performing the experiment, the ITO substrates had been cleaned by an ultrasonic cleaner for 20 min in isopropanol, acetone, anhydrous ethanol and double-distilled water respectively. The electrolyte contained 0.01 M CdSO4, 0.01 M Na2SeO3 and H2SO4 (with different molar concentrations) aqueous solution without any other additive or supporting electrolyte. The wheat-like CdSe array had grown at an applied potential of −0.76 V versus SCE for 40 min at room temperature. After deposition, these samples were rinsed with double-distilled water and dried with high-purity nitrogen in the air. Finally, fabricated wheat-like CdSe array samples were annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere, and then used for experimental tests.
Electrochemical studies were made by a potentiostat (CHI electrochemical workstation) with three electrodes. The crystal structure was identified by a X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-2500) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphology and microstructure of the products were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6700 F). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) of the wheat-like CdSe array was performed with an EDAX Genesis 2000 system (FEI Inc) installed on the XL 30 ESEM imaging instrument. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was taken on a Hitachi H-8100 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The CHI electrochemical workstation was used for PEC measurements at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in polysulphide electrolyte, which contains Na2S (0.25 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M). The light source is a 500 W xenon arc lamp (light intensity, 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G). A computer controlled potentiostat was used to control the potential and record the photocurrent generated.
Results and discussion
Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte solution. Fig. 1 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the reaction solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M), Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) and H2SO4 (0.208 M) at room temperature.
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammogram on ITO substrate in the electrolyte solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M) + Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) + H2SO4 (0.208 M); Scan rate = 100 mV s−1. Label A is the reduction peak of Cd2+ in the electrolyte solution on the ITO electrode. 
The cyclic voltammetry curve was first scanned in the cathodic direction because the Se4+ needed to be reduced to Se2−, which could react with Cd2+ in the electrolyte solution, and then electrodeposit the wheat-like CdSe array on the ITO substrate. The electrochemical reaction process can be simply expressed by the following equations: SeO32− + 6H+ + 4e− → Se + 3H2O(1) Se + 2e− → Se2−(2) Cd2+ + Se2− → CdSe(3) SeO32− + 6H+ + Cd2+ +6e− → CdSe + 3H2O(4)
When the potential scanned to negative potential direction, cathodic current began to increase gradually at about an applied potential of −0.40 V versus SCE. At the same time, a visible golden film appeared on the surface of working electrode (ITO) in our experiment. It should be attributed to the reduction of Se4+. The chemical reaction process is represented by eqn (1). The first peak at an applied potential of approximately −0.91 V (Label A) versus SCE is correlated with the bulk deposition of elemental Cd. The chemical reaction process can be represented by the following equation:Cd2+ + 2e− → Cd
In order to fabricate the wheat-like CdSe array, Se4+ must be reduced to Se2− to react with Cd2+, and then CdSe can be formed as a result of the electrostatic attraction on the ITO substrate in the electrolyte solution. The bath constituents, Cd and Se2−, have extremely different standard electrode potentials (E (Cd2+/Cd) = −0.40 V, E (Se/Se2−) = −0.11 V (versus NHE)), thus, the reduction potential of fabricating the wheat-like CdSe array should be greater than −0.91 V. Even though there is no reduction peak of Se2− in Fig. 1, it provides us with the option of deposition potential range. The cathodic peak (Label A) corresponds to the reduction of Cd2+ to elemental Cd at an applied potential of −0.91 V vs. SCE. If the potential became more negative, elemental Cd was deposited on the ITO substrate. If the deposition potential was closer to −0.40 V, the Se4+ would not be reduced to Se2− to react with Cd2+. In order to avoid the appearance of elemental Cd or Se, the negative potential limit was moved from −0.4 V to −0.91 V. vs. SCE. Through a large number of experiments, we found that the electrodeposition of the wheat-like CdSe array on ITO substrate was achieved by applying a constant potential of −0.76 V in our experiment. Therefore, the deposition of CdSe on ITO substrate was performed at a fixed potential of −0.76 V vs. SCE to promote the one-step reaction of SeO32− and Cd2+ shown in eqn (4).
The change of current with time is shown in Fig. 2 during the direct current potentiostatic electrodeposition at −0.76 V vs. SCE for 40 min. Inset of Fig. 2 shows the change of current within the first 20 s. It is observed that the cathodic current increases quickly at initial time and decreases gradually. The sudden increase in current and following gradual decrease correspond to the formation of CdSe nucleus and growth of wheat-like CdSe rod on the ITO substrate respectively. Although each sample was synthesized following the same procedures, unavoidably some minor variations in synthetic conditions and the isolation process caused some batches of nanocrystals to form wheat-like CdSe array while others did not. In all cases, the change of current follows a similar curve in the shape of the square root symbol and tends to be stable at about 1.0 mA after a few minutes.

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra taken from the wheat-like CdSe array (plot a) and the post-annealed wheat-like CdSe array (plot b), which are prepared in electrolyte solution that contained 0.01 M CdSO4, 0.01 M Na2SeO3 and 0.208 M sulfuric acid. The XRD data are indexed with the help of JCPDS file [File No. 08-0459]. The planes (100), (002), (110) and (112) are corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite structure. After being annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere, the crystallinity of the wheat-like CdSe is greatly enhanced, as suggested by the sharpening of the corresponding XRD peaks. Although intentional oxygen purging of the electrolyte solution before or during the electrodeposition process was not performed, diffraction peaks from oxide phases such as CdO or SeO2 have not been detected. The predominant (002) peaks suggest that the wheat-like CdSe array grow in the direction of their c-axis orientation normal to the ITO surface. In other words, the (0001) facet is the preferred direction in the growth. The chemical composition of the wheat-like CdSe array was determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Fig. 4 shows a typical EDX pattern. There are three prominent peaks: SeL at 1.38 keV, CdL at 3.14 and 3.3 keV. The Se/Cd atomic ratio determined by the relative peaks is 1.17:1, indicating that stoichiometric CdSe is formed.

Fig. 5 shows SEM images for the wheat-like CdSe array. Fig. 5(a) shows a poor wheat-like CdSe array, but there are still a lot of wheat-like CdSe rods that grow well. In Fig. 5(b), some CdSe microrods are mixed in the wheat-like CdSe array, and some of the CdSe rods tend to be of column shape from the top view. Fig. 5(c) is the cross-section of Fig. 5(b). The sample looks like a microrod array. And there are many grains on the side surface of microrods, which makes the sample look like ears of corns. The microrod length can reach up to 5 μm, and the diameter can reach up to 1 μm. Almost all the ends of CdSe microrods tend to be pointed. The pointed top of the microrod may be due to the surface tension effects, whereby the surface-to-volume ratio is minimized. A very large radius of curvature would have a very small energy, therefore, the point-topped microrod would be favorable. Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 5(e) are top and side view of the CdSe array with a well-ordered wheat-like architecture. The wheat-like CdSe rods are nearly straight and grow perpendicularly to the ITO substrate in Fig. 5(e). The length of the wheat-like CdSe rod can reach up to 10 μm, and the diameter can reach up to 2 μm. Fig. 5(f) shows a TEM image of a single wheat-like CdSe rod. The diameter of the wheat-like CdSe rod was approximately 300 nm. Fig. 5(g) shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the wheat-like CdSe rod, indicating that the wheat-like CdSe microrod has a wurtzite crystal structure. The distinct (002) spot suggests that the wheat-like CdSe rod's preferable growth direction is consistent with the description of the X-ray diffraction measurement. However, from the SAED pattern of the wheat-like CdSe rod, this is a polycrystalline material.

(d) Top and (e) side views of SEM images of large-scale wheat-like CdSe array, which is prepared in electrolyte solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M) + Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) + H2SO4 (0.208 M).

Herein, SEM images show that a more wheat-like CdSe array can be prepared in electrolyte solution containing 0.01 M CdSO4, 0.01 M Na2SeO3 and 0.208 M H2SO4. The sulfuric acid can prevent the two precursors (cadmium sulfate and sodium selenite) from the reaction from generating a milky precipitate in the electrolyte solution. As the molar concentration of sulfuric acid of the bath is increased from 0.115 M to 0.208 M, this leads to an increase in the H+ ions which could promote the one-step reaction of SeO32− and Cd2+ to grow wheat-like CdSe array successfully on the ITO substrate according to eqn (4). Using sulfuric acid as a ligand in the electrolyte solution influences the morphology of the sample, but this still needs further study.
The growth mechanism of the wheat-like CdSe rod can be explained as follows. In wurtzite, there is no plane of symmetry perpendicular to the [0001] direction, so the (0001) and the (000) facets are not equivalent.7 As the positively charged Cd-(0001) polar surface is chemically active and the negatively charged Se-(000) is relatively inert,21–23 this will provide a strong tendency to grow the wheat-like CdSe rods along [0001]. Moreover, in electrodeposition, the preferred growth not only depends on the crystallography but also on the electrochemical nucleation and growth kinetics. In the control of structural characteristics, nucleation, and growth kinetics, the [0001] direction that is parallel to the current direction will be the fastest growth direction among other facets in the CdSe nucleus growth process, and the wheat-like CdSe rod will grow longer along the [0001] direction (see Scheme 1). In the experiment, the elemental Se is first reduced and deposited on the ITO substrate, and then reacts with Cd2+ in the solution and grows fast along the single plane of (0001), which is consistent with the description of FESEM, SAED and X-ray diffraction measurements.
The growth results provide us with an opportunity to study the photon-to-charge conversion of the vertically aligned wheat-like CdSe array in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) setup. The sample was directly used as the photoanode in a PEC solar cell filled with polysulphide redox electrolyte; a platinum mesh was used as the counter electrode and a SCE was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte contains 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution, where Na2S acts as a hole scavenger and is oxidized into S22− to prevent the photocorrosion of CdSe.24 The chemical reaction process can be expressed as the following reaction: CdSe + 2H+ → Cd2+ + Se0.25 To ensure efficient hydrogen production at the cathode, Na2SO3 is added to reduce disulfides back to sulfides, S22− + SO32− → S2− + S2O32−.26–28 When the three electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte solution, the wheat-like CdSe array semiconductor electrode in contact with a redox couple behaves analogous to a metal junction Schottky interface, which is of great importance for liquid-junction photoelectrochemical solar cells. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of photoelectrochemical solar cells were measured under solar-simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Each CdSe photoelectrode of the photoelectrochemical solar cell had an effective electrode area of 0.36 cm2. Photoelectrochemical J–V characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 6. The potential at Jsc = 0 is denoted as Voc, representing the open-circuit voltage, and the current density at Voc = 0 is denoted as Jsc, representing the short-circuit current density. The open circuit voltage (Voc), the short circuit current density (Jsc), the fill factor [FF = (VmaxJmax)/(VocJsc)] and the effective area photoelectric conversion efficiency [η = (VocJsc FF)/(Pinput)] for the wheat-like CdSe array, which were prepared in electrolyte solution containing 0.01 M CdSO4, 0.01 M Na2SeO3 and H2SO4 (with different molar concentration), are given in Table 1.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent vs. potential plots were measured in 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The samples were deposited at −0.76 V vs. SCE for 40 min at room temperature with different H2SO4 molar concentration: (a) 0.115 M, in the dark, (b) 0.161 M, in the dark, (c) 0.208 M in the dark, (d) 0.161 M, under illumination, (e) 0.115 M, under illumination, and (f) 0.208 M, under illumination.

As shown in Table 1, the highest Jsc and η% values are obtained from the wheat-like CdSe array thin film photoelectrode which are prepared in the electrolyte solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M) + Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) + H2SO4 (0.208 M). As can be seen from Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 5(e) (prepared in the same electrolyte solution), the wheat-like CdSe array has a large light-receiving area. Conequently, when the sample is irradiated by the simulated solar light, it absorbs more light, and as a result, more electron-hole pairs would separate in the space charge region which is generated in the interface between the wheat-like CdSe rod and the polysulphide electrolyte. Electrons are concentrated into the center of the wheat-like CdSe rod to be transported, and holes are transferred to the polysulphide redox electrolyte solution (Fig. 7). Although the ITO/wheat-like CdSe array/polysulphide junction is an intricate system, it can be a benchmarking basis that achieves the purposes of power output characteristics. As seen from the results of energy conversion efficiency, there is still much room for improvement.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared the wheat-like CdSe array on an ITO conductive substrate by an electrochemical synthesis method at room temperature. In particular, the wheat-like CdSe rod array which are prepared in the electrolyte solution containing CdSO4 (0.01 M) + Na2SeO3 (0.01 M) + H2SO4 (0.208 M) grow regularly and also achieve a relatively higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. This work further demonstrates that electrodeposition directly onto the ITO substrate is a simple, feasible and efficient method to produce the wheat-like semiconductor CdSe array. Furthermore, it may provide a reference for the preparation of other wheat-like semiconductor arrays by electrochemical synthesis methods. From the results of the photoelectrochemical properties studies, the wheat-like CdSe array will have much more potential application in photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cells in the future. Our results might be of considerable interest to improve the efficiency of solar cells.

 	Scheme 1  Experimental set-up diagram and schematic diagram of the wurtzite structure. The proposed electrodeposition process of the wheat-like CdSe rod shows one of the fastest growth direction of [0001] and the ±(0001) polar surfaces in the structure. The [0001] direction is parallel to the current direction, and the active (0001)-Cd polar surface induces the fastest growth along the [0001] direction of the wheat-like CdSe rod.
