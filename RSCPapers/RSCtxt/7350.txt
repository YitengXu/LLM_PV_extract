The combination of plasmonic activity and chemical stability may allow for a variety of new applications.
Hybrid nanostructures of fullerenes, π-conjugated polymers, and metal nanoparticles (NPs) are a new class of nanomaterials in which organic and inorganic components are integrated and exhibit unique properties.1 There have been a number of recent reports that the power conversion efficiencies of solar photovoltaic devices based on π-conjugated polythiophene–fullerene composites were improved by incorporating plasmonically active metal NPs into the composites.1c–e Especially, the combination of fullerene, polythiophene, and metal NPs provides an exciting system to investigate the possibility of designing a plasmonic functionality in nanotubes (vide infra). The nanotubular structures are believed to play an important role as next-generation building blocks for electronic or photoelectronic devices, for chemical or biological sensors, and for energy harvesting, storage, and conversion.2 The nanotubes (NTs) exhibit the following advantages: (i) the nanotube geometry facilitates fast and long-distance electron transport, (ii) the light absorption and scattering can be remarkably enhanced, and (iii) the properties can be manipulated throughout a broad spectral range by controlling their inner diameter and tube wall thickness.3
Metal NPs, especially of silver and gold, have proven to be good candidates for applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)4,5 and plasmonics,6 of which chemical and biological sensing are the most promising. Most of these attractive applications are based on the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metal NPs, which are of interest for a variety of applications including molecular sensing, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and optical sensors due to the significant electromagnetic field enhancement near the metal surface and strong dependence of the resonance wavelength on the size, shape, and local dielectric environment of the metal nanostructures. Although significant progress has been made in the fabrication of nanostructured materials with SERS activities, the exact mechanism of SERS is still being discussed and debated.4,5
Recently, there has been great interest shown in the synthesis and property of fullerene based nanostructured materials.7 The nanostructured materials of fullerenes with various morphologies are yet to be explored for various applications. The development of a generalized method for the fabrication of fullerene-polythiophene nanotubes (NTs) and their metal NP hybrid NTs remains an important and challenging issue. Although only a few examples of the synthesis of fullerene NTs are known,8 the nanotube composite of fullerene and polythiophene (PT), and its metal hybrid NTs, i.e., SERS-active hybrid NTs have never been reported.
The hybridization of the fullerene C60-polythiophene NTs (2-C60-PT-NT, Fig. 1b) with metal NPs is envisaged to provide a valuable and multifaceted platform for the development of new plasmonic NTs. However, if C60 and noble metal NPs were to be dispersed into two solvent phases, they would more likely to be concentrated at the interface due to their strong tendency to form aggregates.9 In order to overcome this limitation, we have developed a new method for the fabrication of a C60/Ag or Au NPs/PT nanotube composite (Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT, Fig. 1b) via the template-based electrocopolymerization of terthiophene-linked C60 (2-C60, Fig. 1a) and terthiophene-modified silver or gold NPs (1-AgNP, 1-AuNP: Fig. 1a) without aggregation of the silver or gold NPs (Chart S1, ESI†).10 To our knowledge, this is the first example for the template-based electrocopolymerization of two different monomers such as the C60-thiophene and the thiophene-modified metal NPs. It has been known that polythiophene NTs are fabricated via template-based electropolymerization using one monomer such as thiophene.2b The novel hybrid nanotubes (2-C60-PT-NT, Ag-C60-PT-NT, and Au-C60-PT-NT) involve the following new aspects: (i) the template-based electropolymerization of 2-C60 produced the fullerene C60-polythiophene NTs (2-C60-PT-NT) which showed the reversible redox behaviour of the fullerene C60, and (ii) the plasmonic hybrid NTs (Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT) show a significant SERS compared to that of the NTs (2-C60-PT-NT, Fig. 1b) which were prepared from the template-based electropolymerization of 2-C60. It is worth pointing out that our approach to preparing a metal–polymer NT composite11 completely differs from all previous studies on the deposition of metal NPs onto the surface of polymer NTs12 (Chart S2, ESI†).10 This communication presents the novel plasmonic hybrid NTs of fullerene C60-PT-silver or gold NPs and their SERS effects. The nanotubular structure of fullerene and polythiophene is one of the ideal structures that can enhance the device performance by improving the charge-transport rate as well as increasing the surface area.

The terthienylthiol-stabilized silver or gold NPs (1-AgNP, 1-AuNP) were prepared via the reaction of AgBF4 or HAuCl4 with NaBH4 in the presence of terthiophene-alkylthiol (1: Fig. 1a) as the protective ligand.10 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of 1-AgNP and 1-AuNP indicated a particle size of 2.4 ± 0.4 nm for 1-AgNP and a particle size of 3.0 ± 1.2 nm for 1-AuNP (Fig. S1a,b and S3a,b; ESI†). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra revealed the presence of Ag and S for 1-AgNP and the presence of Au and S for 1-AuNP (Fig. S1c and S3c, ESI†). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of 1-AgNP displayed the Ag 3d binding energies at 368.1 (3d5/2) and 374.1 (3d3/2) eV, corresponding to the Ag0 state (Fig. S2, ESI†), and there were features at 164.1 eV due to S 2p, at 284.8 eV due to C 1s, and at 532.5 eV due to O 1s.10 The XPS spectrum of 1-AuNP showed the Au 4f binding energies at 84.0 (4f7/2) and 87.7 (4f5/2) eV, corresponding to the Au0 state (Fig. S4, ESI†). The UV-vis spectra of the 1-AgNP or 1-AuNP solution in CH2Cl2 exhibited an absorption due to the terthiophene at 350 nm and very weak plasmon resonance at ∼450 nm for 1-AgNP (Fig. S5a, ESI†),13 and the absorption at 350 nm and the surface plasmon of Au NPs at ∼520 nm for 1-AuNP (Fig. S5b, ESI†).
The template-based electropolymerization of 2-C60 (ref. 14) in a nanoporous alumina membrane (pore diameter of about 200–250 nm) gave the new C60-PT NT composite (2-C60-PT-NT).10 The NTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM, and EDX analysis. Fig. 2a shows the typical SEM image of the 2-C60-PT-NT nanotube arrays. It can be clearly seen that an ordered array of NTs with a uniform diameter is formed. The hollow nature of the tubes is also confirmed by a TEM image as shown in Fig. 2b. The outer diameter of the NTs is about 200 nm, retaining the size of the pores of the alumina membrane template, and the inner diameter of the NTs is about 125 nm. The elemental composition of 2-C60-PT-NT was confirmed by EDX analysis, which revealed the presence of C and S (Fig. 2c). The UV-vis spectrum of 2-C60-PT-NT in o-dichlorobenzene exhibited an absorption due to the 6,6-adduct15 of the C60 derivative at 440 nm and the absorption due to the π–π* transition of the PT conjugated chain at 480 nm (ref. 16) (Fig. 2d). The photoluminescence spectrum of 2-C60-PT-NT in o-dichlorobenzene indicated that the fluorescence of PT was quenched by C60 due to the electron transfer (Fig. S6, ESI†).17 The redox behaviour of 2-C60-PT-NT was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), because there are few reports on the electrochemical property of the fullerene C60 nanotube, e.g., the fullerene C60 nanotube indicated two irreversible redox peaks.18 In contrast, the cyclic voltammogram of 2-C60-PT-NT in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6-o-dichlorobenzene exhibited three reversible redox peaks corresponding to the C60 anionic species at E1/2 = −0.90, −1.25, and −1.79 V (vs. Ag/0.1 M AgNO3) (Fig. 2e). These results clearly indicate the fabrication of the C60-PT composite NTs. This is the first example for the synthesis of π-NTs consisting of C60 and PT.

We have succeeded in the fabrication of hybrid NTs (Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT, Fig. 1b) from the template-based electrocopolymerization of 2-C60 and 1-AgNP or 1-AuNP in a nanoporous alumina membrane (ca. 200–250 nm).10 No aggregation of the Ag NPs or Au NPs occurred during the electrocopolymerization of 2-C60 and 1-AgNP or 1-AuNP, although it was reported that the C60 fullerene mediates the aggregation of metal NPs.9 The SEM (Fig. 3a and 4a) and TEM (Fig. 3b and 4b)22 images of Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT show a tubular structure. The EDX spectra show the presence of C, O, S, and Ag for Ag-C60-PT-NT (Fig. 3c) and the presence of C, O, S, and Au for Au-C60-PT-NT (Fig. 4c). The UV-vis spectra of Ag-C60-PT-NT (Fig. 3d) and Au-C60-PT-NT (Fig. 4d) in CH2Cl2 show the broad absorption due to the surface plasmon of the Ag NPs or the Au NPs and the PT.19

We studied the potential of plasmonic NTs for Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman signal is typically very weak. When molecules are adsorbed onto the roughened surfaces or nanoparticles of Ag and Au, the Raman signal will be enhanced (i.e., SERS effect); thus it has been widely studied for applications regarding single molecule detection.4,5 Much less is known about the SERS effect based on the nanotube itself of polymer NTs containing metal NPs (Chart S3, ESI†). Accordingly, the Raman spectra were measured for 2-C60-PT-NT, Ag-C60-PT-NT, and Au-C60-PT-NT using a 532 nm laser source. The Raman spectrum of 2-C60-PT-NT exhibited a peak at 1460 cm−1 (Fig. 4e, blue line). In contrast to 2-C60-PT-NT, the SERS effect (Fig. 4e, purple line and red line) was significantly found in the silver NP or gold NP composite (Ag-C60-PT-NT, Au-C60-PT-NT). As shown in Fig. 4e purple and red lines, the Raman scattering peak at 1460 cm−1 of Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT is enhanced due to the electromagnetic field enhancement. This band can be mainly assigned to the Ag(2) mode for the Raman-active vibration mode of C60,20 because 1-Ag-PT-NT showed no enhancement of the Raman scattering for the PT as shown in the Fig. 4e green line.21 This is the first observation for the SERS effect based on the nanotube itself of hybrid NTs consisting C60, Ag NPs or Au NPs, and PT. We will compare the power conversion efficiency of the hybrid nanotubes (Ag-C60-PT-NT and Au-C60-PT-NT) with that of the polymer bulk heterojunction solar cell, poly(3-hexylthiophene)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester.1c–e
In summary, we have, for the first time, succeeded in the preparation of plasmonically active hybrid nanotubes consisting of fullerene C60, polythiophene, and Ag or Au NPs. In these hybrid NTs, the Ag NPs or Au NPs are confined as components of the wall thickness of the NTs. We believe that our methods offer an effective approach to fabricating the multifunctional NTs consisting of metal NPs. The multifunctional hybrid NTs consisting of fullerene C60, PT, and Ag NPs or Au NPs will become a new type of SERS substrate using NTs. We expect this research to be applicable in a broad range of applications such as plasmonic photocatalysis, photovoltaics, chemical and biological sensing based on SERS effects. A study involving the further characterization (i.e., SERS) of the new hybrid NTs and these applications is now underway.
