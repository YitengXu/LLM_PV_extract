    , Accepted 14th May 2020First published on 14th May 2020AbstractTransition metal carbides (TMCs), known to deliver extra capacity beyond the theoretical limit, are proposed as emerging high-capacity anodes for next-generation lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism for the extra lithium storage in TMCs has not been revealed clearly due to the electrochemical inertness of TMCs to Li in cycling. Here, for the first time, by employing in situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, we corroborate that the capacity enhancement of Fe3C anodes originates from the physiochemical evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and surface carbonaceous materials through three mechanisms: (i) Fe3C catalyzes the reversible conversion between esters and ethers to store extra lithium ions in the SEI; (ii) Fe and inorganic components embedded in the SEI form a reversible surface-conversion reaction of Fe + 3LiF ⇌ FeF3 + 3Li+ + 3e− to contribute additional capacity; and (iii) surficial carbon delivers capacity through surface capacitive effects and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes. With the extra lithium ion storage in the SEI and carbon, the C@Fe3C/Fe anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 808 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 1 A g−1. This study provides a fundamental basis for emerging high-capacity TMC anodes to be efficiently explored for next-generation LIBs.

Broader context
There is intensive interest in developing high-capacity and long-life lithium-ion batteries for applications in electric vehicles, electronic devices and large-scale power sources. Underlying these initiatives are strategies for designing upgraded electrode materials. Fe3C, an anode that delivers extra capacity beyond the theoretical limit, is arguably a promising candidate for next-generation energy conversion and storage applications due to its high electrical conductivity (∼106 S m−1), electrochemical stability and excellent rate capabilities. However, the prebiotic chemistry regarding the capacity enhancement of transition-metal carbide anodes still remains poorly understood due to their electrochemical inertness to Li in cycling. Herein, by revealing the structural and physiochemical evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) near a core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode in pre-designed electrolytes with various fluorine contents, we corroborate that both organic and inorganic ingredients of SEI undergo reversible conversions and contribute capacity enhancement through the catalysis of Fe3C. The surface capacitive effect and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes of carbonaceous materials are revealed to be non-negligible for the additional capacity. The findings offer fundamental insights into high-capacity catalysis-based anodes to realize safe, high-capacity next-generation energy storage devices.

Introduction
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have found extensive applications in a variety of applications, such as portable electronics, electric vehicles, solar/wind energy storage, and implantable medical devices, owing to the zero memory effect, reliable security, and long lifetime.1–8 High-capacity electrode materials are the key to developing high-energy-density LIBs. To date, the intercalation-type graphite anode still prevails in the applications of LIBs, while its relatively low theoretical capacity (372 mA h g−1), unqualified electronic conductivity (∼105 S m−1) and inferior rate performances fail to meet the growing demands of LIBs.9–12
Fe3C, a classical transition metal carbide (TMC), has been proposed as a potential next-generation anode material due to its high electrical conductivity (∼106 S m−1), electrochemical stability and excellent rate capability.13–15 In addition, its extreme hardness and thermal stability enable safe LIB operation under extreme conditions. In the Fe3C crystal, carbon atoms occupy the interstitial sites of close-packed Fe atoms, where the contracted d-band electrons near the Fermi level contribute excellent catalytic properties of Fe3C, reducing the reaction barrier in the electrochemical process. The catalytic activity, however, is proven to be of no substantial benefit to lithium storage since Fe3C stores 1/6 Li atoms per unit (theoretical capacity: ∼26 mA h g−1) in a complete lithiation process.15 Further evidence shows the absence of an observable shift in the characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of the Fe3C/Fe anode during the charge and discharge processes, demonstrating its electrochemical inertia to lithium.16 Nevertheless, extremely high capacities of Fe3C anodes have been experimentally observed. For instance, Zhang et al. synthesized a graphene/Fe–Fe3C nano-composite with a capacity of 607 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1.17 Liu et al. prepared nonstructural C/Fe–Fe3C anodes possessing a considerably increased capacity of 780 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.18 Nevertheless, the origin of such capacity enhancements has not been fully understood to date.15 Similar capacity enhancements have also been observed in most transition metal-based compounds (ESI,† Table S1). Theories have been proposed to trace the origin of the extra capacity: (1) Srinivasan et al. proposed that the grain boundaries of the metal–Li2O phase on the Fe2O3 anode stores extra lithium in reduction processes;19 (2) Zhang et al. reported that CoCO3 converted to Li2O and Li-intercalated LixC2 (x = 0, 1, 2);20 (3) Lu et al. proposed that each Mo atom additionally accommodated six Li+ after the complete reduction of MoS2.21 All the aforementioned theories involve “conversion” reactions of anode materials, leading to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) compounds (Li2O and Li2CO3) and transition metals. However, Fe3C and Fe are not involved in the conversion reactions due to their electrochemical inertness to Li. In particular, Fe is inevitably present in a Fe3C anode due to the eutectoid transformation of both Fe and Fe3C in the carbothermal reduction process.22 Although metallic Fe can be removed from the carbon-coated Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles by using HCl solutions, Fe3C is also dissolved, which decreases the energy density of the anode.23 Researchers believe that Fe3C catalyzes reversible formation and decomposition of SEI, thereby giving rise to extra capacity,16,24–26 but the specific conversion process in the SEI is rather ambiguous.
Here, we investigate the origin of the extra capacity by revealing the structural and physiochemical evolution of the SEI near a core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode coupled with pre-designed electrolytes of various fluorine contents. We find that the reversible conversion between esters and ethers in the SEI, as catalyzed by Fe3C, counts mainly for the additional lithium storage. This process is enabled by C@Fe3C with a well-tailored electron structure. The Fe atom also contributes capacity by transforming to FeF3 active sites through LiF intermediates with a surficial haloid conversion reaction in the SEI.27 Based on systematic in situ Raman and density functional theory (DFT) studies, it is verified that both organic and inorganic ingredients in the SEI undergo reversible conversion, thus giving rise to the extra capacity. Surface capacitive effects and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes of surface carbonaceous materials are not negligible for additional capacity. The findings offer a fundamental basis towards the understanding of the electrochemical mechanism of TMCs for high-capacity battery anodes.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the crystal structure of Fe3C features an octahedral framework. Each rhombic octahedron consists of six iron atoms, within which resides a carbon atom.28 The covalent electrons of the interstitial carbon atoms form strong covalent bonds with the 3d electrons of iron atoms.29 The octahedron is linked together with electron clouds between iron atoms (Fig. 1b), resulting in a conductivity that is one order of magnitude higher (∼106 S m−1) than that of conventional carbon materials (graphite: ∼105 S m−1). Core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles are synthesized with a Schlenk line and through a carbothermal reduction process (see Experimental section) (Fig. 1c). Fe(acac)3 is the iron precursor, and 1-octadecene (ODE) and oleic acid serve as a carbon source, solvent and surfactant, respectively. Fe3O4 colloid is first synthesized through pyrolysis and then reduced by carbon to form Fe in the carbothermal process. Carbon atoms then coordinate with Fe crystals to form Fe3C.30 The carbothermal process finally yields core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe.

(j) The energy barriers for dissociation of LiPF6 with and without Fe3C. 
As shown in Fig. 1d and e, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles are coated with carbon shells and embedded in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The elemental mapping images demonstrate the uniform dispersion of Fe3C in the carbon matrix (ESI,† Fig. S1). CNTs are prepared with the catalysis of Fe in the surrounding carbon matrix when the temperature is above 700 °C (Fig. 1d and e).31 The TEM analyses in Fig. 1e and f reveal that the Fe3C/Fe particles with an average size of ∼30 nm are encompassed with CNTs to form a core–shell architecture. According to the analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 1g and h, lattice fringes of 0.33 nm and 0.21 nm are assigned to the (0 2 0) plane of Fe3C and (1 1 0) plane of Fe, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns show that Fe3C nanoparticles own a high crystallinity (the inset in Fig. 1g). The interplanar spacing of the CNTs is 0.34 nm, corresponding to the (0 0 4) lattice plane (Fig. 1g).
The formation mechanism of the robust SEI near Fe3C is illustrated in Fig. 1i. In the initial process, the LiPF6 chemically decomposes to PF5 and LiF according to the following equation (eqn (1)): LiPF6 → LiF + PF5(1)at the anode/electrolyte interface.32 The strong Lewis acid (PF5) induces the polymerization of ethylene carbonate (EC) to generate polycarbonates (Fig. 1i).33 Then, the polycarbonate moieties in the SEI layer featuring high molecular weights serve as a binder to hold the organic and inorganic components and effectively protect the electrode surface, allowing for efficient transfer of Li+ ions at the anode/electrolyte interface. DFT calculations show that the decomposition energy barrier of LiPF6 on Fe3C is 0.26 eV (Fig. 1j), which is significantly lower than that of self-dissociation in the carbonate-based electrolyte (1.75 eV), indicating the formation of a reinforced SEI layer on the carbide anode.
Physical properties of core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles
The crystal structure of the synthesized C@Fe3C/Fe is confirmed with XRD, as shown in Fig. 2, confirming orthorhombic Fe3C (JCPDS #35-0772), cubic Fe (JCPDS #06-0696) and hexagonal CNT (JCPDS #26-1080) in C@Fe3C/Fe. The distinguished peaks at 44.7° and 65.1° are assigned to the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) planes of Fe. The peak at 26.6° is attributed to the (0 0 4) plane of carbon, and the prominent peaks at 37.6°, 43.7° and 54.4° are assigned to the (2 1 0), (1 0 2) and (2 3 0) planes of Fe3C. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) gas absorptiometry determines a mesoporous structure of the core–shell nanoparticles with a high specific area of 31.1 m2 g−1 (Fig. 2b and ESI,† Fig. S2), and the mesoporous structure is further demonstrated with HRTEM (ESI,† Fig. S3b). During cell operation, Fe3C can catalyze the electrolyte filled in the mesoporous structure of core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles (ESI,† Fig. S3a). The contents of the Fe element in the carbon matrix are further confirmed with thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) in the air from 25 °C to 900 °C. As shown in Fig. 2c, from ∼190 °C to 410 °C, the weight increases due to the formation of Fe2O3: 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3(2)As the temperature exceeds 410 °C, CNTs and carbon in Fe3C are combusted to CO2,17 leading to a dramatic weight loss. The mass contents of Fe3C and Fe are, therefore, calculated to be 17 wt% and 14 wt% (calculation details in the ESI†). Fig. 2d shows the Raman spectrum of C@Fe3C/Fe. The higher intensity of the G-band (1590 cm−1) as compared to that of the D-band (1310 cm−1) demonstrates the high crystallinity of carbon materials, as consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2a). The 2D peak is observed at 2700 cm−1, suggesting that the sample consists of inhomogeneous multilayer graphite layers.34 The weak peaks at 2943 cm−1 and 3227 cm−1 are attributed to the carbon overtones.

The bonding characteristics and elemental composition of C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles are further confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surficial iron oxides are observed. The peaks at 710.1 eV and 723.6 eV are attributed to Fe2+ of Fe3O4, the peaks at 712.2 eV and 732.1 eV are attributed to Fe3+ of Fe3O4, and the peaks at 711.1 eV and 727.5 eV are attributed to Fe3+ of Fe2O3, respectively.35–37 Satellite peaks are also observed at 714.5 eV and 717.9 eV, respectively. The Fe–C peak at 708.9 eV is attributed to Fe3C (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f shows that the peaks at 283.7 eV, 285.1 eV and 289.3 eV for C 1s correspond to C–C, CC and C–O bonds, respectively.38 The dominant Fe–C peak (283.4 eV) corresponds to Fe3C.
Core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode for high-performance batteries
As shown in Fig. 3a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is performed to analyze the electrochemical characteristics of the core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode with lithium as the counter-electrode. The weak peak starting from ∼1.8 V in the first lithiation process is attributed to the preliminary formation of the SEI layer with the decomposition of the electrolyte, whereas the lower peak at ∼0.65 V is attributed to the further reduction of SEI. The distinct redox peaks around 0.01–0.2 V during the reduction/oxidation processes are due to the Li+ insertion/extraction in the anodic carbon. In the reverse sweep, the broad peak at ∼1.75 V corresponds to the reversible oxidization reactions of partial SEI due to the catalysis of Fe3C.15,17 As shown in Fig. 3b, the peaks retain the well-defined configuration even with an increase in the scan rate from 0.2 mV to 1 mV, demonstrating the good reversibility of SEI. 1 M LiClO4, 1 M LiPF6 and 2 M LiPF6 electrolytes are employed to investigate how the electrolyte impacts the formation of SEI (Fig. 3c). The peak intensities of 2 M LiPF6 at 1.8 V (reduction process) and 2.7 V (oxidation process) are significantly enhanced compared with 1 M LiPF6. However, no peaks at 1.8 V and 2.7 V are observed for 1 M LiClO4, indicating that the F elements experience redox reactions in the SEI.

(i) Cycling performances and coulombic efficiencies of C@Fe3C/Fe anodes with 1 M LiFP6 with a current density of 2 A g−1. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to evaluate the interfacial resistance at the open-circuit state (Fig. 3d). The pristine cell with 1 M LiPF6 possesses a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct, the semicircle diameter at the high frequency), as compared with the cell with 1 M LiClO4, indicating that surface-fluoride active sites embedded in SEI lead to a reduced interfacial resistance and more pronounced electrochemical reaction kinetics of the cell. Cells after charge/discharge cycling are also tested (ESI,† Fig. S4) with various electrolytes, which demonstrates that 1 M LiPF6 leads to more pronounced electrochemical reaction kinetics and lowers the cell impedance after cycling. As shown in Fig. 3e, the rate capabilities of the C@Fe3C/Fe anode with different electrolytes are investigated. A higher concentration of fluorine in the electrolyte leads to a larger capacity. The cell with the fluorine-rich electrolyte (2 M LiPF6) possesses the highest rate capacities of 1177 mA h g−1, 1012 mA h g−1, 954 mA h g−1, 845 mA h g−1, 682 mA h g−1 and 521 mA h g−1 from 0.1 A g−1 to 2 A g−1. The discharge capacity recovers to 1195 mA h g−1 as the current density is reduced back to 0.1 A g−1 from 2 A g−1. The galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of C@Fe3C/Fe anodes are shown in Fig. 3f. The core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anodes maintain the voltage plateaus even at high C rates, demonstrating the kinetically efficient Li+ transferability at the anode/electrolyte interface and the well-retained catalytic activity of Fe3C in the SEI.
To quantify the capacity contribution of the total capacitive and diffusion processes, C@Fe3C/Fe anodes are investigated with CV curves at various scan rates and the results are calculated according to the following equation (eqn (3)): (3)where i(v) is the total current. k1v and  correspond to the surface and diffusion-controlled contributions, respectively.39 The values of k1 and k2 at fixed potentials are determined with the following reformulated equation (eqn (4)): (4)As shown in Fig. 3g, the capacitive contribution accounts for 86.85% in the total charge storage at 1 mV, implying that the electrochemical reactions primarily occur at the surface. The ratio of the surface-controlled contribution at different scan rates for C@Fe3C/Fe is illustrated in the ESI,† Fig. S5. As expected, the surface-controlled reaction kinetics gradually increases with the increase in scan rate, suggesting that a large capacitive contribution on the surface favors Li+ storage and gives rise to a high rate capacity.40,41
The advantage of surficial carbon enhanced catalysis in electrochemical reactions is further elucidated with cyclic performances, as depicted in Fig. 3h. The cell with 2 M LiPF6 possesses a higher initial capacity as compared with those based on 1 M LiPF6 and 1 M LiClO4 at the first ∼100 cycles, which is consistent with the rate performances due to the high-concentration fluorides. However, large polarization and low Li+ conductivity arising from the high-concentration lithium salt (fluoride) leads to rapid capacity decay with cycling (Fig. 3d).42 After 700 cycles, the cell with 1 M LiPF6 delivers 808 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, considerably above those of 2 M LiPF6 (455 mA h g−1) and 1 M LiClO4 (361 mA h g−1). In addition, the coulombic efficiency of a C@Fe3C/Fe anode with 1 M LiPF6 rapidly reaches up to ∼99% after the initial cycles. The capacity contribution of the surficial carbon during cycling is investigated by employing HCl to remove the Fe element, which is confirmed with XRD (ESI,† Fig. S3c). As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S6, surface carbon with 1 M LiPF6 delivers 121 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, accounting for ∼14% of the total capacity of the C@Fe3C/Fe anode. This result is consistent with the CV and current response analyses (Fig. 3g and ESI,† Fig. S5), implying that the surficial carbon contributes non-negligible capacity through the surface-controlled capacitive effect and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes.43,44 The catalysis of Fe3C is further elucidated by removing metallic Fe from the composite C@Fe3C/Fe anode. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S7a, the XRD result shows that the peaks of Fe at 44.7° and 65.1° vanish after the HCl treatment, demonstrating that the metallic Fe has been removed. The amorphous carbon peak appears because the removal of metallic Fe increases the relative intensity of carbon. The C/Fe3C anode possesses an increased capacity up to 500 mA h g−1 (ESI,† Fig. S7b), indicating that, in addition to the surface capacitive effect of surficial carbonaceous materials, Fe3C catalyzes the reversible conversion of SEI to account for most of the additional lithium storage.
Even at 2 A g−1, the cell based on the C@Fe3C/Fe anode in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte delivers a reversible discharge capacity up to 392 mA h g−1 with a 99% coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles (Fig. 3i), demonstrating the high stability of the core–shell architecture. To analyze the effects of electrolyte solvent, we add diethyl carbonate (DEC) to the 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte (using ethylene carbonate + dimethyl carbonate + ethyl methyl carbonate as the solvent, denoted as EC + DMC + EMC) for electrochemical tests. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S8a, the CV curves have the same redox peak for 1 M LiPF6/EC + DMC + EMC with and without DEC, indicating that the solvents do not affect the electrochemical properties of the core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode. However, the cell with 1 M LiPF6/EC + DMC + EMC + DEC electrolyte exhibits increased charge transfer resistance (Rct, the semicircle diameter at high frequency) and possesses a more rapid capacity decay after 400 cycles (ESI,† Fig. S8b and c).
Reaction mechanism of surface-fluoride active sites
To identify whether surficial iron oxides (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) participate in the redox reactions, the physiochemical evolution of SEI near the core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode is further identified with XPS spectra at various potential states. No peaks of iron oxides are observed after being charged to 3 V and discharged to 0.1 V, illustrating that surficial iron oxides do not participate in the catalytic reactions. Instead, LiF and Li2O peaks are detected (Fig. 4a–e and ESI,† Fig. S9). We propose that iron oxides are converted to Fe and Li2O in the first lithiation process (eqn (5) and (6)). Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− → 2Fe + 3Li2O(5) Fe3O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → 3Fe + 4Li2O(6)The deconvolution of Fe 1s reveals characteristic FeF3 (714.8 eV) and FeF2 (711.3 eV) peaks, verifying the formation of surface fluoride active sites. The proportion of LiF increases from 27.6% to 40.8% as the potential decreases from 3 V to 0.1 V (Fig. 4g), indicating that inorganic LiF participates in the electrochemical reactions. DFT simulations are performed to demonstrate the strong affinity between Fe and fluorides (LiF). As shown in Fig. 4c and f, electron density difference mapping analysis shows electron accumulations between Fe(1 0 0) and LiF, suggesting the electron transfer between Fe and F as well as the formation of Fe–F bonds. We propose a conversion reaction of LiF near the Fe nanoparticles in the charge process (eqn (7)),27 accompanied by the formation of FeF3 active sites which store additional capacity (Fig. 4h). As shown in Fig. 4i, in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms FeF3 at ∼300 cm−1 (red bands). FeF3 active sites experience periodic generation and consumption during charge and discharge reactions, delivering capacity as FeF3 recovers to Fe and LiF (eqn (8)). Charge reaction: Fe + 3LiF → LiFeF3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → FeF3 + 3Li+ + 3e−(7) Discharge reaction: FeF3 + 3Li+ + 3e− → LiFeF3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Fe + 3LiF(8)In addition, FeF3 can undergo a pseudocapacitive reaction and be converted to FeF2.45 The FeF2 peak detected in the Fe 2p spectra is thus attributed to:46 FeF3 + Li+ + e− ⇌ FeF2 + LiF(9)Based on such evidence, we believe that the reversible surficial conversion reaction of Fe + 3LiF ⇌ FeF3 + 3Li+ + 3e−(10)in the SEI contributes capacity beyond the theoretic limit for the C@Fe3C/Fe anode. To gain further evidence, we employ commercial FeF3 and Fe3C materials as electrodes without adding carbon additives in electrochemical tests. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S10a, the CV curves show that the cells based on C@Fe3C/Fe, Fe3C and FeF3 electrodes all possess redox peaks in the small voltage range of 0.6–0.8 V except the anodic peak of C@Fe3C/Fe at 0.2 V corresponding to the Li+ extraction from the anodic carbon. This confirms that FeF3 and Fe3C own electrochemical properties similar to those of C@Fe3C/Fe. The cells with commercial FeF3 and Fe3C deliver reversible capacities of 275 mA h g−1 and 103 mA h g−1 (ESI,† Fig. S10b), respectively. In addition, the discharge capacity of the cell based on commercial Fe3C increases with increasing cycle number, demonstrating that the catalytic activity substantially contributes to lithium storage because Fe3C can only store 1/6 Li atoms per unit (∼26 mA h g−1) in a complete lithiation process.

Evolution of SEI components under the catalysis of Fe3C to store extra Li
To further investigate the evolution of the SEI composition associated with the capacity increment during the electrochemical reactions, XPS is employed to investigate the different redox states. As shown in Fig. 5a, hydrocarbon/carbon–carbon bonds (284.4–285.1 eV, CH2–CH2O), polyether carbon (∼286.5 eV, CH2O), carbonyl groups (∼289.7 eV, CO3) and polycarbonates (292.9 eV, poly(CO3)) are observed in the C 1s spectrum at 0.1 V.47–49 The prominent carbonyl group originates from the decomposition of carbonate solvents. The observation of polycarbonates is due to the polymerization of EC solvents induced with LiPF6 decomposition, and the enriched polycarbonate moieties with high molecular weights serve as polymeric binders to integrate the SEI and intimately stick to the C@Fe3C/Fe anode.33 As the potential increases to 3 V, the surface organic components in the SEI layer remain unchanged but the proportion varies with the catalysis of Fe3C (ESI,† Fig. S11). The proportion of carbonyl compounds increases to 57.2% from 42.5% with a decreasing proportion of ether-based compounds from 13.8% to 10%, which is consistent with the results from Wohlfahrt–Mehrens.50 In addition, the variation tendency of hydrocarbon is similar to polyether, which decreases from 38% to 27.2%. However, the proportion of polycarbonate remains ∼5.6%, suggesting that polycarbonate stabilizes the SEI integrity in the electrochemical processes. The depth profiles of the XPS for the selected elements are illustrated in the ESI† Fig. S12. The concentrations of C and O at 0.1 V and 3 V decrease with increasing concentrations of Li and F from the outer layer to the inner layer of the SEI, indicating that organic compounds are close to the electrolyte solution and inorganic ingredients are rich in the inner SEI layer (ESI,† Fig. S12a and b). In addition, the concentrations of Li and F at 0.1 V are higher than those at 3 V, which is consistent with the electrochemical reaction mechanism of FeF3 active sites during the formation of LiF (0.1 V) at the electrode surface (Fig. 4h). As the etching time increases, the peak of Li carbides (283.2 eV, RLi) appears with the disappearance of polycarbonates (292.9 eV, poly(CO3)) at 0.1 V and 3 V,33 suggesting that Li carbides are stable in the SEI during the electrochemical reactions (ESI,† Fig. S12c and d). The evolution of ethers is also confirmed with in situ Raman analysis, as shown in Fig. 5c. The peaks of ether bonds (800 cm−1 and 1050 cm−1) exhibit periodic variations in the electrochemical reactions,51 which is consistent with the XPS results.

We propose that an important aspect of the aforementioned scenario is initiated with the reduction of ester carbonates (EC and DMC) to Li-containing species (e.g., CH3OLi, LiOCH2CH2OLi, CH3OC(O)OCH2CH2OLi) in the lithiation process near the core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode, as shown in Fig. 5d. These Li-containing species in the SEI are eventually polymerized to oligomers/polymers that contain ester and ether functional groups (LiOCH2CH2OC(O)OCH2CH2OCH2CH2OLi) under the catalysis of Fe3C, which causes an increased amount of ether, decreased amount of esters and accompanying lithium storage.51,52 Reversibly, the esters groups reconvert to ether groups through RLi and ROLi (R denotes the alkyl groups) intermediates in the delithiation processes accompanying the formation of Li2O.33 The unvaried polycarbonate ingredients, as a binder to hold the organic and inorganic components due to the high molecular weights, effectively protect the electrode surface (ESI,† Fig. S13a and b) and retain the integrity of the SEI with a thickness of 15 nm in the electrochemical reactions (ESI,† Fig. S13c), which is also confirmed through high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging (ESI,† Fig. S14a). Fe elemental mapping is performed on the cycled C@Fe3C/Fe anode and demonstrates the growth of SEI near the iron species (ESI,† Fig. S14b). However, a higher-concentration lithium salt (2 M LiFP6/EC + DMC + EMC) results in a more defective electrode surface and a thicker SEI layer (19 nm) (ESI,† Fig. S13d–f), which is consistent with the results from Li et al.53 A thicker SEI possesses a lower ionic conductivity and results in a more rapid capacity decay (Fig. 3h). For 1 M LiClO4/EC + DMC + EMC electrolyte, although the thickness of the SEI layer is the same as that based on 1 M LiFP6/EC + DMC + EMC electrolyte, agglomerated particles occur on the post-cycle anode, which prolongs the Li+ diffusion pathway and increases the charge transfer resistance (Fig. 3h and ESI,† Fig. S13g–i). As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S13j–l, the post-cycle anode based on 1 M LiPF6/EC + DMC + EMC + DEC electrolyte possesses a rougher and thicker SEI layer (16 nm), as compared with that based on the 1 M LiPF6/EC + DMC + EMC electrolyte, leading to the decrease in discharge capacity after 400 cycles (ESI,† Fig. S8b and c).
DFT calculations are performed to gain insights into the catalysis based on the core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe architecture. We construct the structure of C@Fe3C by combining an Fe3C crystal and carbon sheet, and the projected 3d-orbital density of states (PDOS) of C@Fe3C is shown in Fig. 5e (purple, dashed line). For comparison, the Fe 3d PDOS of the pristine Fe3C is also provided in Fig. 5e (red, solid line). As compared with Fe3C (ESI,† Fig. S15), the overlap of the projected density of states (PDOS) between the Fe3C d-state and carbon p-state (ESI,† Fig. S16) indicates that the Fe3C d-orbital and the carbon p-orbital share matched energy values, demonstrating that there is robust host–guest electronic interaction between the encased Fe3C and protective graphitic layers (ESI,† Fig. S17).54,55 Electron density difference maps are employed to analyze the electron transfer direction within C@Fe3C. The red and blue regions indicate a charge increase and decrease, respectively. As compared with pure carbon (ESI,† Fig. S18a), electric charges significantly increase (red region) in carbon after being incorporated with Fe3C (ESI,† Fig. S18b), indicating electron transfer from Fe3C to the outer layer of graphite. The electron transfer makes the carbon layer reactive to the SEI layer.56 The delocalization of the 3d electrons broadens the d-band and, thus, lowers the d-band center of Fe3C (Fig. 5e). The rate-determining step of catalysis is the bonding process between the adsorbate and the catalyst (C@Fe3C) surface. The low-lying d-band center indicates that the anti-bond formed with ether/ester and C@Fe3C is closer to the Fermi level,57 leading to more electrons in the anti-bonds, weakening the bond between intermediates and Fe3C, and releasing Fe3C to accelerate the catalytic reactions.
CH3CH2OCH2CH3 and CH3C(O)OCH2CH3 are taken to represent ether and ester groups, and the corresponding O 2p orbitals and C@Fe3C 3d orbitals are shown in Fig. 5f. The Fe 3d orbital and the O 2p orbital of ether/ester have a well-matched covering range near the Fermi level (Fig. 5f), indicating the efficient electron transfer between them to accelerate the catalytic reactions. As C@Fe3C interacts with ether and ester, the O 2p orbitals of the ether and ester and the Fe 3d orbital of C@Fe3C are simulated and shown in Fig. 5g and h, respectively. As the ether and ester adsorb on C@Fe3C, overlapped electron density maps for ether-C@Fe3C (Fig. 5g) and ester-C@Fe3C (Fig. 5h) adsorptions indicate the efficient electron transfer within ether-C@Fe3C and ester-C@Fe3C combinations. As compared with the pristine O 2p orbitals of ether and ester (d dots in Fig. 5f), both dominant O 2p orbital peaks of ether (d dot in Fig. 5g) and ester (d dots in Fig. 5h) shift towards lower values upon adsorption on C@Fe3C. This narrows the energy gap between the dominant Fe 3d peak of C@Fe3C (c dot) and the O 2p orbital of ether (d dot) from 2.7 eV to 1.7 eV (Fig. 5g), and also narrows the energy gap between the dominant Fe 3d peak of C@Fe3C (c dot) and the O 2p orbital of the ester (d dot) from 2.7 eV to 1.6 eV (Fig. 5h). Upon adsorption, the reduced energy gaps result in stronger repulsion of the lone pair electrons between ether and C@Fe3C and between ester and C@Fe3C,58 which weakens the Fe–O bonding, reduces the associated desorption barrier and facilitates the catalytic reactions of ether and ester with C@Fe3C.
XPS results in Fig. 4a and b show that metallic Fe is present at 3 V and 1 V, suggesting that Fe embedded in the SEI is not completely converted to FeF3 in the charge process. We fabricate Fe electrodes with commercial Fe powders to analyze the catalysis of Fe in the electrochemical reactions. Cubic Fe does not store capacity through alloying with Li because of their relatively high electronegativity difference (0.85) and unmatched valence state (+1 vs. +3) according to the Hume-Rothery rules.59 Experimental results illustrate that Fe–Li alloys do not form in the battery system.60 Additionally, the Fe–Li phase diagram fails to support the formation of Fe–Li alloys since Fe–Li alloys do not form below 1340 °C, a temperature at which Li vaporizes and Fe still remains solid.61 However, Fe can participate in the surface conversion reaction Fe + 3LiF ⇌ FeF3 + 3Li (eqn 10) to contribute capacity. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S19a, the charge/discharge profiles of Fe appear similar to those of Fe3C and C@Fe3C/Fe, indicating their similar electrochemical reactions. As the potential decreases to 0.01 V, the electrolyte is decomposed and the SEI forms on the Fe surface. Bonding processes between the adsorbate and the Fe are the rate-limiting step for catalysis. The unpaired electrons and empty orbitals in the 3d band of Fe activate the P–F bonds of LiPF6 and C–O groups of ether/ester molecules, which accelerates P–F bond breaking to form LiF (LiPF6 → LiF + PF5, eqn (1)) and enables the conversion between esters and ethers in the SEI to store capacity.15 Nevertheless, the d-band center of Fe is −0.92 eV,62 which is significantly higher than that of Fe3C (−1.78 eV) (Fig. 5e), leading to poor catalysis of the conversion between esters and ethers in the SEI and the reduced formation of LiF. This, in turn, inhibits the surface reversible conversion reactions of Fe (eqn (10)) for storing extra capacity. Fig. S19b (ESI†) shows that the cell based on the Fe electrode delivers a capacity of ∼28 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, accounting for ∼3.2% of the total capacity of the C@Fe3C/Fe anode. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the catalytic effect of Fe is negligible for the capacity of the C@Fe3C/Fe anode.
Conclusions
In summary, the origin of the capacity enhancement near the high-capacity C@Fe3C/Fe anode is revealed by directly characterizing the structural and physiochemical evolution of the SEI. Owing to the decreased d-band center of C@Fe3C, the surficial carbon enhances the catalytic reactions that facilitate the conversion between esters and ethers at the anode/electrolyte interface and contribute capacity. A haloid conversion reaction with resultant fluoride (FeF3) active sites in the SEI layer is demonstrated to deliver additional capacity with both experimental characterization and theoretical calculations. In addition, the surficial carbon delivers additional capacity through a surface-controlled capacitive effect and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes. Based on the proposed Li+-storage mechanism, the cell assembled with the C@Fe3C/Fe anode and 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte delivers a high capacity of 392 mA h g−1 with a 99% coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1.
Experimental section
Materials
Fe(acac)3, oleic acid and ODE were supplied by Aladdin (Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd). Fe, FeCl3·H2O, ethanol (99.7%) and n-hexane were purchased from Chron Chemicals (Chengdu Chron Chemicals Co., Ltd). Commercial FeF3 and Fe3C were supplied by Shanghai TITAN (Shanghai TITAN Technology Co., Ltd) and Bike Material (Shanghai Bike Material Technology Co., Ltd). All the chemical reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification.
Synthesis of core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe
Fe(acac)3 was used as the iron precursor and the mixture of ODE and oleic acid was chosen as the reaction solution. Core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles were prepared by dispersing 1.4 g Fe(acac)3 powders into a 23 mL mixed solution of ODE:oleic acid = 15:8 (by volume) in a Schlenk line under vacuum. The Schlenk line was pumped for 40 minutes before Ar gas was introduced. The solution was first heated at 120 °C for 2 h and then at 280 °C for 30 minutes under magnetic stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained solution was centrifuged and rinsed 4 times by using a mixture of ethanol:n-hexane in a volume ratio of 3:1, and then dried at 80 °C for 48 h in an oven. The powders were then sintered at 365 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace under the Ar atmosphere, and then the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and kept for 2 h. Finally, the composite was treated with 1 wt% HCl for 5 minutes and rinsed with deionized water to remove the impurities. The C@Fe3C anode was obtained by soaking the C@Fe3C/Fe composite in 5 wt% HCl for 25 minutes. Then the solution was centrifuged and rinsed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To obtain surficial carbon materials, C@Fe3C/Fe was added into 4 M HCl and 1 M FeCl3·H2O solution to be stirred at 60 °C for 24 h to remove Fe. Then the solution was centrifuged and rinsed with deionized water. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h, the carbon anode materials were obtained.
Characterization
The surface morphology of C@Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles was investigated with SEM (JSM-7100F, JEOL) operated at 5 kV. The elemental composition was identified with EDX. The lattice spacing was analyzed with HRTEM (FEI G20, USA). The crystalline structure of C@Fe3C/Fe was characterized with XRD (D/Max 2400, Rigaku) by using Cu Kα radiation. The chemical composition and bonding characteristics were investigated with XPS (Kratos XSAM 800, Al Kα radiation (144 W, 12 mA, 12 kV)). TGA (SDT 2960, USA) with a TG analyzer was performed in the temperature range from 25 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The Raman spectra of the samples were examined with a 785 nm laser (Renishaw). For the post-cycle C@Fe3C/Fe anodes, the cells were opened in an Ar-filled glove box and washed with DMC solvent to remove lithium salts and impurities. The SEI was etched through 4 kV argon ions with a sputtering rate of 0.2 nm s−1.
Electrochemical measurements
The anode slurry was fabricated by mixing C@Fe3C/Fe, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with a ratio of 8:1:1 with 2.5 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was then coated on copper foil and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The loading of C@Fe3C/Fe in each anode was ∼1.5 mg cm−2 with 12 mm diameter. Fe, Fe3C and FeF3 electrodes were obtained using the same method without adding the carbonaceous materials. For electrochemical measurements, 2032 coin-type cells were assembled with Celgard 2325 as separator and Li foil as the counter electrode. Three types of electrolytes were used to investigate the catalysis of C@Fe3C/Fe. For a fluorine-containing electrolyte, 1 M and 2 M LiPF6 were dissolved in EC:DMC:EMC = 1:1:1 (by volume). For a fluorine-free electrolyte, the electrolyte was 1 M LiClO4 in EC:DMC:EMC = 1:1:1 (by volume). To consider the effects of electrolyte solvent, 1 M LiPF6 was dissolved in EC:DMC:EMC:DEC = 30:15:20:35 (wt%). A Neware BTS-51 instrument was employed to perform the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at various current densities in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Li+/Li). CV and EIS characterization were analyzed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. CV analysis was taken at various scan rates from 0.2 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1 within the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 0.10 Hz to 1.0 MHz.

In situ Raman spectroscopy

In situ Raman spectroscopy was performed through Renishaw InVia Raman microscopy with a 785 nm laser. A 2 mm hole and a 5 mm hole were punched in the centers of a separator and Li foil for the assembly of the in situ cell with a quartz window for Raman observations. 60 μL electrolyte was used. The cell was firstly cycled three times at 0.2 A g−1 within the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. Then, the laser was directly illuminated on the surface of the C@Fe3C/Fe anode during the charge and discharge processes and the Raman signals were recorded simultaneously.
DFT calculations
Fe crystal possesses a cubic structure and a space group of Lm3m (a = 2.866 Å, b = 2.866 Å, c = 2.866 Å). Fe3C possesses an orthorhombic structure and a space group of Pnma (a = 5.091 Å, b = 6.743 Å, c = 4.526 Å). Fe(1 0 0) and Fe3C(0 0 1) crystal planes, as the stable plane,63,64 were built. For Fe3C, a seven-layer slab with a (2 × 2 × 1) supercell was used for surface geometry optimization within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function of generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as implemented with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). The top two layers of Fe3C lattice and the representative molecules (Fe, EC, LiPF6, graphite, ester and ether groups) were relaxed for the calculations. A 1 × 1 × 1 k-point grid and cut-off energy of 340 eV were chosen for the reciprocal space grid and the tolerance of the self-consistent field (SCF) was below 2 × 10−6. A maximum force tolerance of 0.05 eV Å−1, an energy tolerance of 2.0 × 10−5 eV per atom and a maximum displacement tolerance of 0.001 Å were employed for calculations. For Fe–LiF calculations, a four-layer slab with a (4 × 3 × 1) supercell of Fe crystal was used for surface geometry optimization with the GGA-PBE function. The top two layers of Fe lattice and LiF were relaxed for the calculations. The SCF value was below 2 × 10−6 eV per atom. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh k-points grid of 3 × 2 × 1 and a cutoff energy of 400 eV were used. An energy tolerance of 2.0 × 10−5 eV per atom, a maximum force tolerance of 0.03 eV Å−1 and a maximum displacement tolerance of 0.001 Å were used for all calculations. The energy barrier of the decomposition of LiFP6 was identified by securing the state between the reactant and the product.

Broader context
There is intensive interest in developing high-capacity and long-life lithium-ion batteries for applications in electric vehicles, electronic devices and large-scale power sources. Underlying these initiatives are strategies for designing upgraded electrode materials. Fe3C, an anode that delivers extra capacity beyond the theoretical limit, is arguably a promising candidate for next-generation energy conversion and storage applications due to its high electrical conductivity (∼106 S m−1), electrochemical stability and excellent rate capabilities. However, the prebiotic chemistry regarding the capacity enhancement of transition-metal carbide anodes still remains poorly understood due to their electrochemical inertness to Li in cycling. Herein, by revealing the structural and physiochemical evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) near a core–shell C@Fe3C/Fe anode in pre-designed electrolytes with various fluorine contents, we corroborate that both organic and inorganic ingredients of SEI undergo reversible conversions and contribute capacity enhancement through the catalysis of Fe3C. The surface capacitive effect and Li+ inter/deintercalation processes of carbonaceous materials are revealed to be non-negligible for the additional capacity. The findings offer fundamental insights into high-capacity catalysis-based anodes to realize safe, high-capacity next-generation energy storage devices.
