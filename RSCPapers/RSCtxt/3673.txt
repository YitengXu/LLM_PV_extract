    , Accepted 9th July 2014First published on 7th August 2014AbstractGold nanoparticles with varying sizes were prepared by the spray process under an electric field (DC voltages of 0 V and 1 kV applied to the nozzle) for studying their role in inverted organic solar cells (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag). The application of electric field during the spray process resulted in a smaller size (35 nm as compared to 70 nm without the electric field) of the nanoparticles with more uniform distribution. This gave rise to a difference in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect created by the gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), which then affected the solar cell performance. The photovoltaic performances of plasmonic inverted organic solar cells (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) using spray-deposited Au and ZnO layers (both at 1 kV) showed improved efficiency. Fast exciton quenching in the P3HT:PCBM layer was achieved by using a spray-deposited Au layer in between ITO and ZnO layers. The absorption spectra and internal power conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve showed that the Au nanoparticles provide significant plasmonic broadband light absorption enhancement which resulted in the enhancement of the JSC value. Maximum efficiency of 3.6% was achieved for the inverted organic solar cell (IOSC) with an exceptionally high short circuit current density of ∼15 mA cm−2 which is due to the additional photon absorption and the corresponding increase observed in the IPCE spectrum. The spray technique can be easily applied for the direct formation of Au nanoparticles in the fabrication of IOSC with improved performance over a large area.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted considerable attention due to their light weight, cost effectiveness and solution processibility.1–8 The inherent drawback of short lifetime in the conventional device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al) due to the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS and low work function of Al electrode has led to research towards the inverted organic solar cell (IOSC).9–11 In an IOSC, the charge collecting nature of the electrodes is reversed giving it a more stable structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag. ZnO is known to be a good electron transport layer used in organic solar cells.12–14 Plasmonic effects in solar cells have been explored due to increased light absorption in the polymer film from the scattering or near field enhancement caused by metallic nanoparticles. When these nanoparticles are irradiated by light, a localized enhanced electric field initiating from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is generated all around the metallic nanoparticles.15–17 This LSPR plays an important role in improving the device performance by enhancing the light absorption in the active layer and hence the photoelectric conversion efficiency of an organic solar cell.18–20 In plasmonic solar cells, metal nanoparticles (Ag or Au) can be incorporated into the carrier transport layer, into the active layer, on top of the active layer (P3HT:PCBM) or in between the carrier transport layer and active layer.21–26 The LSPR effect in thin film solar cells depends on different shapes and distribution of nanoparticles (NPs).27,28 There are many reported methods to exploit the LSPR effect either in an inorganic solar cell or in organic solar cell to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE).29–32 Since the efficiency of the organic solar cell is mainly limited by the absorption of photons in the wavelength range close to the HOMO–LUMO gap of the organic layer (and the subsequent collection of charges at the electrodes), an enhancement in the absorption region by the LSPR effect of metal NPs can play an important role in improving photovoltaic parameters.
There are many reported methods for fabricating Au NP films from pre-synthesized colloidal Au NPs (with or without ligands), such as sol gel, in situ preparation, immersion, atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma assisted physical vapour deposition (PAPVD), etc.33–35 There are also reports on direct formation of Au NPs on a glass substrate using ultrasonic spray technique and spray pyrolysis technique.36,37 We have used the spray technique due to its inherent advantages of low cost, large area coverage, easy thickness control, less material wastage and easy tunability of the deposited nanoparticles size. To the best of our knowledge we are reporting for the first time the use of electric field for size variation in the spray-formed Au NPs on an ITO substrate for application in the plasmonic IOSC(ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag). The electron transport layer (ZnO) is also deposited by the same technique. Thus, the reported technique of direct formation of Au NPs eliminates the requirement of NP formation separately and will reduce the complete device fabrication time. The effect of electric field on the optical and structural properties of the deposited Au nanoparticle films and their role on the IOSC performance are presented in this paper.
Experimental
The spray deposition set-up is described in detail in our earlier publication.38 The spray solution for Au NP formation is prepared by adding 0.3 mM auric acid (Molychem) in DI water and sonicating this solution for 5 min. Nitrogen gas is used as a carrier gas. The optimized deposition parameters are: substrate temperature −350 °C, solution flow rate – 1 ml min−1 and nozzle to substrate distance – 18 cm. The electric field is created by connecting a DC power supply (up to 1 kV) between the nozzle and a circular electrode placed 4 mm below the nozzle. The spray solution recipe and spray deposition parameters for the electron transport layer (ZnO) on the Au layer are described in our earlier publication.39
The spray-deposited films are characterized using a ZEISS EVO-50 model scanning electron microscope for the surface morphological study, a Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode to know the roughness, and a Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer for optical absorption studies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were done using an X-ray diffractometer (Phillips X'PERT PRO), having a CuKα incident beam (λ = 1.54 Å). A Dektak XT surface profiler was used to measure the thickness of the deposited films. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer (model: LS-55) having a xenon flash lamp as the source of excitation at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm. For the time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements the samples were excited using a 475 nm pulsed laser and the transient signal was recorded using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (PMA-C 192 N-M, Picoquant).
For the fabrication of plasmonic IOSC, we first cleaned the ITO substrate by sonication in soap solution, DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each. A film of Au nanoparticles with a thickness of ∼5 nm was deposited using the spray process on the cleaned ITO substrate. A ZnO film with a thickness of ∼30 nm was spray-deposited on the Au film. A blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (both from Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in 1,2–dichlorobenzene, at a weight ratio of 1:0.8, was used for the active layer deposition. The blend layer with a thickness of ∼150 nm was spin-coated (in air) on the spray-deposited ZnO layer. The deposited active layer was annealed at 140 °C for 15 min. The Ag electrode (100 nm) was deposited by using the thermal evaporation method at 1.0 × 10−5 Torr to obtain an effective device area of 0.09 cm2. J–V characteristics of these devices were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination using Oriel Sol 3A, a class AAA solar simulator, with a Keithley 2440 source meter. The simulator was calibrated using an NREL certified Si solar cell. Internal power conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these devices were recorded at room temperature using a SpeQuest quantum efficiency measurement system from RERA Solutions, The Netherlands.
Results and discussion
Morphological properties
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1(a) clearly shows the formation of Au nanoparticles by spraying the auric acid solution. The nanoparticles are randomly distributed with an average particle size of 70 nm. The shape of the spray-deposited nanoparticles is not uniform over the surface and there is also some agglomeration. On applying the DC voltage (1 kV) during the spray process the deposited nanoparticles are uniformly distributed with a reduced average size of 30 nm (Fig. 1(b)). The size reduction and uniformity of Au nanoparticles are as expected because on applying the DC voltage the electrostatically charged spray droplets will become finer with a more uniform size distribution.

The surface morphology of the spray-deposited ZnO layer on the Au layer is shown in Fig. 2. The large sized spray-deposited Au nanoparticles at applied voltage = 0 V are projecting out of the thin ZnO layer (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, there is a full coverage of smaller Au nanoparticles deposited at applied voltage = 1 kV by the ZnO film (Fig. 2(b)). All characteristics of the spray-deposited ZnO layer on an ITO substrate were already reported in our previous publication.39 The role of the size of Au nanoparticles and the coverage of the ZnO layer in the photovoltaic parameters of IOSCs will be discussed later.

The electric field effect on the surface morphology and roughness of spray-deposited layers can be seen in the two dimensional (2D) as well as three dimensional (3D) AFM topography images shown in Fig. 3. These AFM images are taken at the scale of 5 μm × 5 μm. The root mean square roughness (Rrms) of the spray-deposited ZnO layer on the AuNP layer is 24 nm which gets reduced to 10 nm on applying the voltage during the spray deposition of Au as well as ZnO layers due to the formation of finer droplets after applying DC voltage. These finer droplets spread in a corona cone giving rise to a smooth surface morphology over large area. As it can be seen from AFM images that the large sized Au NPs are projecting out of the spray-deposited ZnO layer leading to higher roughness. These large sized NPs (70 nm) will penetrate into the active layer used in the formation of the plasmonic inverted solar cell. The reduced roughness of the smaller nanoparticles is expected to enhance the IOSC performance by giving a better pathway to deposit the polymer layer as well as the SPR effect on the active layer, which will be discussed later.

Structural properties
The XRD spectra of spray-deposited Au nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4. The well-defined peak positions and their orientations are well matched with JCPDS card no. 089-3697. The crystallinity of the spray-deposited Au layer is enhanced on applying the voltage resulting in increased peak intensity. A good crystalline film should provide a better charge transport and extraction for improving the PCE of the device.

Optical properties
The normalized absorption spectra of a spray-deposited Au nanoparticle film are shown in Fig. 5. The SPR peak of the spray-deposited Au layer (0 V) is at λmax ∼ 570 nm with an SPR bandwidth (FWHM) of 100 nm and gets blue shifted towards λmax ∼ 533 nm with an SPR bandwidth of 50 nm on applying the voltage. These absorption peaks are well matched with the absorption peaks of the P3HT:PCBM film. The creation of finer droplets under the electric field is the reason for the change in the SPR band position and the reduction in FWHM. By creating a different electric field during the spray deposition one can change the size and distribution of NPs and accordingly tune the SPR band very easily.37 To confirm the contribution of the LSPR effects on both the spray-deposited Au nanoparticle films, we measured the absorption spectra of a spin-coated P3HT layer deposited on top of the ITO/Au/ZnO structure (Fig. 6). For reference, the absorption spectra of the spin-coated P3HT layer on top of spray-deposited ZnO layers (0 V and 1 kV) without the Au NP layer (only ITO/ZnO) is also taken.
 Fig. 5  UV-vis absorption spectra of the spray-deposited Au nanoparticle layer showing the shift due to the applied voltage. 
 Fig. 6  UV-vis absorption spectra of the spin-coated P3HT layer on the ITO/Au/ZnO structure. 
From the absorption spectra it can be seen that the absorption for P3HT deposited on ITO/Au (70 nm)/ZnO is higher and extended up to 1000 nm than that for the reference device (ITO/ZnO (0 V and 1 kV)), which is having an absorption up to 690 nm only. The absorption gets enhanced further till 1200 nm for the P3HT deposited on electric field assisted spray-deposited Au NPs as well as the ZnO layer (ITO/Au (35 nm)/ZnO). This increase is attributed to the LSPRs of Au NPs (size ∼70 nm) that penetrate into the active layer and Au NPs (size ∼35 nm) that touch the active layer. The absorption enhancement from 400 nm to 660 nm (absorption range of P3HT) will fully contribute to the improvement of the device performance.
Further enhancement in the range of 690−1200 nm may not play a major role in improving our device performance. But if it is applied for OPV devices fabricated using an active blend layer with a spectrally extended absorption range of 700–1200 nm, there can be a significant improvement in the performance. There are reports that for large sized nanoparticles the back scattering power dominates the forward scattering and this reduces the absorption in the active layer.40 The LSPR effect depends on the shape, distribution as well as the separation distance between the nanoparticles. The spray-deposited Au nanoparticles (0 V) have an irregular shape with agglomerated large sized NPs showing random distribution (Fig. 1(a)); therefore, the contribution of the LSPR effect to absorption enhancement is less due to the back scattering effect. Due to the reduced size and uniform distribution of the electric field assisted spray-deposited Au NPs, the contribution of the LSPR effect to absorption enhancement is higher.
Role of the spray-deposited Au nanoparticles on photovoltaic performance
To find out the role of spray-deposited Au nanoparticles two sets of devices were prepared: Device D1 (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) and Device D2 (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag). To further study the role of the electric field on the spray-deposited Au layer two more sets of devices were prepared by applying DC voltage (1 kV) during the spray deposition of the Au layer as well as ZnO layer: Device D3 (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) and Device D4 (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag).
The J–V characteristics of plasmonic IOSC (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) and IOSC (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) are shown in Fig. 7. Device D1 shows the power conversion efficiency of 2.3%. On introducing the spray-deposited Au nanoparticle (70 nm) layer between ITO and the spray-deposited ZnO layer (Device D2), the power conversion efficiency increases to 2.9% with improved JSC and FF values of 13.8 mA cm−2 and 39.0%, respectively (Table 1).

Device D4 using both the electric field assisted spray-deposited small Au nanoparticle (35 nm) layer and ZnO layer shows the highest efficiency of 3.6% with a remarkable increment in the JSC value (15.6 mA cm−2) which is mainly due to the LSPR effect of Au NPs enhancing the absorption in the active layer. An improvement is also seen in the VOC and FF values which increase from 0.54 V to 0.56 V and from 37.9% to 41.5%, respectively in comparison with Device D3 (PCE = 2.6%). The increment in VOC and FF values is due to improved film qualities by applying the electric field during deposition as discussed before.
The role of the LSPR effect in enhancing the absorption can be seen from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 8) which show the same trend of increment in JSC values for all the four IOSCs. As expected, the highest IPCE of 75% is obtained for the best Device D4 proving the effectiveness of the LSPR effect due to small size of the nanoparticles. The IPCE for the larger sized nanoparticles (70 nm) is of course lower. The small difference in the IPCE of the IOSCs using different ZnO layers can be attributed to the improvement in the ZnO layer prepared under the electric field. Thus, the combined effect of the LSPR due to small sized Au nanoparticles and improved ZnO layer properties causes improved performance in Device D4. The large sized Au nanoparticles (70 nm) used in Device D2 will project beyond the 30 nm ZnO layer and penetrate the P3HT:PCBM layer leading to reduced D/A interface area.41 This can also cause a difference in the IPCE spectra.

Effect of spray-deposited different sized Au NPs on the photoluminescence spectra
As described above, there is variation in photovoltaic parameters of plasmonic IOSC using different sizes of spray-deposited Au NPs. To further investigate these results and to know the LSPR effect on the exciton generation rate we performed the photoluminescence (PL) measurement. As the main contributor of light absorption and exciton generation in the active layer is the donor phase (P3HT), therefore we measured the PL spectra of a spin-coated P3HT film on the ITO/Au/ZnO film with different spray-deposited Au NPs (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  PL spectra of the spin-coated P3HT layer on different structures. 
There is an enhancement in the PL intensity after using the spray-deposited layer of Au NPs in between ITO and ZnO layers. This enhancement is due to the fact that an increment in the degree of light absorption as well as light excitation rate occurs due to the LSPR excitation.15 From PL spectra we can see that upon excitation of the LSPR there is an enhancement in light absorption and the number of photo-generated excitons in P3HT. Due to this the PL intensity is enhanced in comparison to P3HT spin-coated on ZnO without an Au layer. This increment is higher when using the electric field assisted spray-deposited Au NPs than that for spray-deposited Au NPs at applied voltage = 0 V. This difference is because the PL intensity mainly depends on changes in the light absorption, affecting the light excitation rate and exciton quenching at metal–organic interfaces. For spray-deposited Au NPs (applied voltage = 1 kV), there is an enhancement in the absorption of the P3HT film compared to that for the spray-deposited Au NPs at applied voltage = 0 V (Fig. 6) which contributes to the enhancement of the PL intensity. As the spray-deposited large size Au NPs (70 nm) will penetrate the 30 nm ZnO layer and enter into the P3HT layer, there is quenching at the metal–organic interface giving lower PL intensity. While the spray-deposited small sized Au NPs (35 nm) will reach the interface of the P3HT layer giving a higher PL intensity with a high exciton generation rate. This enhanced exciton generation rate will help in producing more JSC and increased PCE.
Time resolved photoluminescence: effect of Au NPs on exciton quenching
Time resolved PL measurements (Fig. 10) are performed to understand the coupling process between the plasmonic field and the photogenerated excitons within the active blend layer. TRPL provides information about the influence of the plasmonic effect on the photophysical process between the donor and acceptor phases, and hence the role of different NP sizes in terms of exciton lifetime (τ). The average exciton lifetime (τexciton) is calculated using the following equation:τexciton = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)where τ1 and τ2 are the two lifetime values with corresponding amplitudes A1 and A2 for a given transient curve.
 Fig. 10  Time-resolved PL spectra of the P3HT:PCBM layer spin-coated on different structures. 
For the spin-coated P3HT:PCBM film on a spray-deposited ZnO layer (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM) the values of two fitted exponential constants τ1 and τ2 are 34 ns and 2.90 ns, respectively; providing a corresponding exciton lifetime of 25 ns. After using the spray-deposited Au layer between the ITO and ZnO layer (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM), the values of two exponential constants τ1 and τ2 are 26 ns and 2.24 ns respectively, providing the τexciton value as 20 ns. By using the spray-deposited Au and ZnO layers under the effect of electric field (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM) the values of τ1 and τ2 are 15 ns and 1.70 ns, respectively with τexciton = 9 ns. These results suggest that by using a spray-deposited Au layer between ITO and ZnO layers the excitons are quenched faster in comparison to that without the Au layer. Further, the excitons are quenched much faster on using electric field assisted spray-deposited Au and ZnO layers (ITO/Au/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM). The use of spray-deposited Au layer (with an NP size of 35 nm) results in a greater absorption of light with enhanced exciton generation; however, when these excitons reach the P3HT:PCBM interface, the degree of charge carrier dissociation is also increased. This fast exciton dissociation plays an important role in improving the device performance.
Conclusions
Direct formation of different sizes of Au nanoparticles on an ITO substrate has been achieved using the spray process. This allows for the formation of Au nanoparticles directly on the ITO substrate for the plasmonic IOSC fabrication without including any post-deposition treatment. Uniform, smooth, well distributed and crystalline Au nanoparticles are deposited by applying DC voltage during the spray process. The UV-vis absorption range and exciton generation rate of the polymer are enhanced due to the LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles. The fast exciton quenching is achieved by using electric field assisted spray-deposited Au and ZnO layers in between ITO and P3HT:PCBM film. There are 17% and 26% increments in the JSC and PCE values of IOSC (Device D2) using the spray-deposited Au nanoparticle (70 nm) layer in between the ITO substrate and ZnO layer in comparison to IOSC (Device D1) without including the Au layer. Using electric field (applied voltage = 1 kV) assisted spray-deposited Au nanoparticles (35 nm) and ZnO layers (Device D4) the JSC and PCE show increments of 32% and 56%, respectively in comparison to IOSC (Device D1). The LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles in giving rise to these differences is clearly established and the role of the size difference in spray-deposited layers at applied voltage = 0 V and 1 kV has been demonstrated. The possibility of large area deposition as well as roll to roll deposition makes this spray technique suitable for plasmonic IOSC.
