    , Accepted 1st August 2017First published on 1st August 2017AbstractTwo regioregular narrow bandgap conjugated polymers with a D′–A–D–A repeat unit architecture, namely PIFCF and PSFCF, were designed and synthesized. Both polymers contain strictly organized fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) orientations and different solubilizing side chains for solution processing. Compared to the previously reported asymmetric pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) based regioregular polymer, namely PIPCP, PIFCF and PSFCF exhibit wider bandgaps, tighter π–π stacking, and improved hole mobilities. When incorporated into solar cells with fullerene acceptors, the Eloss = Eg − eVoc values of PIFCF and PSFCF devices are increased compared to solar cells based on PIPCP. Determination of Ect in these solar cells reveals that, relative to PIPCP, PIFCF solar cells lose more energy from Eg − Ect, and PSFCF solar cells lose more energy from both Eg − Ect and Ect − eVoc. The close structural relationship between PIPCP and PIFCF provides an excellent framework to establish molecular features that impact the relationship between Eg and Ect. Theoretical calculations predict that Eloss of PIFCF:PC61BM would be higher than in the case of PIPCP:PC61BM, due to greater Eg − Ect. These findings provide insight into the design of high performance, low voltage loss photovoltaic polymeric materials with desirable optoelectronic properties.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors based on conjugated polymers with regioregular molecular structures are attractive due to their ability to achieve a greater degree of interchain order, when compared to their less structurally precise counterparts.1,2 Studies of the widely investigated “classical” regioregular polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) have demonstrated how controlling the orientation of monomers in the backbone translates to desirable modifications in the degree of crystallinity, charge transport, and overall organization in the thin film.3–5 The asymmetry in P3HT arises due to the absence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the thiophene plane.
 Fig. 1  Asymmetric building blocks and polymer designs: (a) replacing PT with FBT; (b) replacing IDT with SiIDT. 
Recent work in the development of donor (electron rich)–acceptor (electron poor) (D–A) narrow bandgap conjugated polymers has demonstrated cases where controlling the orientation of asymmetric A units improves relevant optoelectronic properties.6–11 One case in point involves the pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) fragment, see Fig. 1, which exhibits a similar asymmetry to that of 3-hexylthiophene. Introducing PT in a controlled fashion can allow one to achieve exceptional hole mobilities.12 Müllen and collaborators also reported fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) based regioregular D–A polymers with enhanced solar cell power conversion efficiencies (PCE).13 More recently, our group reported on a donor polymer, PIPCP,14 see Fig. 1, with a regiochemically precise set of D′–A–D–A repeat units. Notably, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells using PIPCP exhibit a relatively high open circuit voltage (Voc) due to a low energy loss (here, Eloss is defined as Eg − eVoc), when compared against a wide range of polymers with similar optical gaps (Eg).15–28
Larger Eloss values due to exciton splitting driving force, charge transfer (CT) state binding energy, interfacial disorder, and recombination translate directly into lower PCEs.29,30 Compared to wide bandgap materials with high Voc values,31–35 narrow bandgap polymers facilitate light absorption up to near-IR energies, which can better match the solar radiation spectrum, leading to higher short-circuit current (Jsc) values. Narrow bandgap polymers with low Eloss therefore provide opportunities to maximize the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.15,19,36–41 Unfortunately, although PIPCP-based solar cells have a low Eloss, the system has been limited due to a low fill factor (FF). For high performance OPVs, materials optimization requires a better understanding of how the molecular features impact Eloss and FF.
In this contribution, we first describe the design of a new polymer structure related to PIPCP, namely PIFCF (Fig. 1), in which we switch the PT units in PIPCP to FBT units in PIFCF. Furthermore, we exchange the solubilizing side groups in the IDT unit in PIPCP and PIFCF to the less bulky SiIDT unit to make PSFCF. Both polymers serve as models to understand how subtle changes in molecular structure impact relevant optoelectronic properties and the resulting solar cell characteristics.42
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Preparation and characterization of FBT copolymers PIFCF and PSFCF
Relative to PT-based regioregular polymers, FBT-based analogs provide the opportunity to accentuate intermolecular and intramolecular arrangements via H⋯F hydrogen bonds43–45 and to avoid interfacial issues due to protonation of the pyridyl nitrogen atom in PT by acidic surfaces.46–48 It is also worth noting the difference between the reactivity of the dibromide precursors, namely 4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Br2FBT) and 4,7-dibromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (Br2PT). For Br2FBT, the Br meta to the fluorine substituent is more reactive toward transition metal-mediated cross coupling reactions.49 In the case of Br2PT, one finds that the Br adjacent to the pyridyl N is more reactive.12 As such, one finds opposite regioselectivity between Br2FBT and Br2PT. Like PIPCP, PIFCF and PSFCF are D′–A–D–A type copolymers; however, they contain FBT instead of PT for the A unit, which enables investigation of the aforementioned effects of the FBT substitution. For PSFCF, we further modified the solubilizing side groups on D′ relative to PIFCF: benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]bis(4,4′-dihexyl-4H-silolo[3,2-b]thiophene-2,2′-diyl) (SiIDT)49 was introduced as D′ because both the silicon bridge atom and the removal of bulky substituted phenyl groups was anticipated to improve polymer chain packing.50,51
As shown in Scheme 1, compound 1 was synthesized in 60% yield via the Stille cross-coupling reaction.52 The regioselectivity of 1 was confirmed by 1H–1H NOESY spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). PIFCF and PSFCF were obtained by polymerization of 1 with 2 and 1 with 3, respectively, using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 under conventional heating conditions. For PIFCF, after stirring at 110 °C for an hour, the mixture becomes viscous and difficult to stir. A similar protocol starting with 1 and 3 produced PSFCF. Interestingly, PSFCF showed higher solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature relative to PIFCF (Table 1). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and dispersities (Đ) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (PIFCF: Mn = 17 kDa, Đ = 1.8; PSFCF: Mn = 36 kDa, Đ = 1.6). We also intentionally synthesized a lower molecular weight batch of PSFCF (Mn = 18 kDa, Đ = 2.2). Both PIFCF and PSFCF show good thermal stability under nitrogen, with 5% weight-loss temperatures at 414 °C and 408 °C for PIFCF and PSFCF, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). No thermal transitions were observed for either material by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the range 30–300 °C (Fig. S5, ESI†).

2.2 UV-vis absorption
Optical absorption spectra of PIFCF and PSFCF, compared to PIPCP, are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, all polymers in solution display π–π* transition peaks around 400 nm while their lowest energy intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) optical transitions are in the 600–800 nm range. PIFCF displays ca. 70 nm blue-shifted absorption relative to PIPCP, consistent with FBT being a weaker acceptor relative to PT (and therefore having a smaller electron affinity (EA), i.e., higher-lying LUMO).46–48 The SiIDT-based polymer PSFCF exhibits a 20 nm blue shift in absorption compared to the IDT-based polymer. Thin film absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. Consistent with the solution measurements, PIFCF and PSFCF have a blue-shifted absorption compared to PIPCP. In the solid state, however, PSFCF film absorption is more red-shifted compared to PIFCF. This phenomenon suggests that PSFCF exhibits more intimate interchain contacts relative to PIFCF. As determined by the onset of film absorption, the Eg of PSFCF and PIFCF is 1.57 eV and 1.65 eV, respectively, as summarized in Table 1.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Thin-film cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†) were used to estimate the ionization potentials (IPs), using the oxidation onsets.53,54 The EAs were estimated by subtraction of Eg to the IP values (thus, neglecting the exciton binding energies, which can be expected to be similar for the three co-polymers). As summarized in Table 1, the PT-to-FBT substitution decreases the IP of PIFCF (i.e., to a first approximation, destabilizes the HOMO) to 5.20 eV, from 5.26 eV for PIPCP. Substitution of SiIDT unit decreases the PSFCF IP even more, up to 5.16 eV. Using the optical gaps, the EAs are estimated as 3.55 eV and 3.59 eV for PIFCF and PSFCF, respectively. Though there is still considerable debate over the applicability and accuracy of CV measurements, with considerations such as the film morphology and its impact on the polarization effects,55,56 as well as polymer/electrode contact and the accurate determination of the onset, the EA difference (0.20–0.24 eV) between the FBT–polymer analogues and PIPCP is significant enough to point at the influence of substituting PT to FBT. The CV measurements are also consistent with what has been concluded from the ICT peaks in the UV-vis measurement (i.e. PT is a stronger acceptor unit relative to FBT). Since achieving a small EA (donor)–EA (acceptor) offset is conducive to minimizing Eloss,15,39 the effect of destabilizing the LUMO energy levels of FBT analogues relative to PIPCP is expected to increase Eloss in fullerene-based devices.
2.4 GIWAXS and charge-carrier transport of neat polymer films
Hole mobilities of the polymers were calculated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model for hole-only devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au (see Fig. S9a, ESI†).57,58 The pristine PIFCF film (μ = 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) exhibits slightly improved hole mobility relative to PIPCP (μ = 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).14 PSFCF exhibits a much improved hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, when compared to PIPCP. Improving charge carrier mobilities has been shown to increase the FF in simulations and in solar cells devices,59,60 and may reflect a better intrachain and interchain electronic coupling in the solid state.50
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate relevant features for neat polymer films are provided in Fig. 3.61 Similar to PIPCP, the FBT-analogue polymers have a face-on orientation, with stronger reflection peaks in the out-of-plane direction at qz = 1.57 Å−1 and qz = 1.63 Å−1 for PIFCF and PSFCF, respectively, which corresponds to a “π–π stacking” distance of 4.00 Å and 3.80 Å. These distances indicate tighter intermolecular contacts relative to PIPCP (4.30 Å),14 in good correlation with the hole mobilities. These data suggest that changing the bulky sidechains on the IDT unit in PIPCP and PIFCF was effective at allowing tighter interchain packing. Crystal correlation lengths (CCL) were calculated from Gaussian fitting of the “lamellar” and π-stacking diffraction peaks.62 We note that the determination of CCL does not directly correspond to crystallite size due to contributions to peak broadening from disorder; however, correlations between CCL and the PCE of devices incorporating these donor polymers may provide insight useful for further molecular design improvements. The CCLs of π-stacking peaks (Table S1, ESI†) in the nominally out-of-plane direction were 1.5 nm for neat PIFCF and 2.6 nm for PSFCF, comparing to that of 1.2 nm for neat PIPCP, suggesting a higher degree of morphological order via the SiIDT substitution.

2.5 Photovoltaic characteristics of PIFCF and PSFCF
The photovoltaic properties of PIFCF and PSFCF are summarized in Table 2 and in the ESI.† PIFCF was blended both with PC61BM to allow for a direct comparison with previous work on PIPCP, and with PC71BM. Device optimization for these blends is summarized in the ESI,† including adjustments of solvents, additives, donor–acceptor blend ratio, and active layer thickness (see Table S2–S6, ESI†). Optimal efficiencies, summarized in Table 2, were achieved using inverted devices, with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag. Table 2 and Fig. 4 summarize the photovoltaic performance of PIFCF and PSFCF, compared to PIPCP. PIFCF:PC61BM blends at a ratio of 1:2 cast from chloroform without any thermal or additive treatment exhibit a best PCE of 2.9%. Fabricating devices with PIFCF:PC71BM shows little change in solar cell performance. Note that solvent additive treatment and thermal annealing have negligible impact on the photovoltaic performance of PIFCF blends (see Table S2, ESI†). In the case of PSFCF:PC71BM, the weight ratios were also optimized at 1:2. PSFCF:PC71BM blends cast from neat solvent without any treatment exhibited PCEs of ∼3.1% (see Table S3, ESI†). Further device optimization of PSFCF:PC71BM showed improvements upon introduction 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)48,63 as a solvent additive to the processing solvent, with a PCE of up to 8.0% (see Table S3 and S6, ESI†).

V
oc values of optimized PIFCF and PSFCF devices (0.83–0.84 V and 0.79 V, respectively) are significantly lower than PIPCP14,16 (0.89 V). From Table 2, one observes that the Jsc and FF of PIFCF-based solar cells are both low regardless of the fullerene, 7.9–9.3 mA cm−2 and 43–37%, respectively. However, PSFCF:PC71BM devices achieve improved FF (66%) compared to PIPCP:PC61BM (51%), and a relatively high Jsc of 15.4 mA cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4b. Note that there is no obvious molecular weight dependence on the PSC performance of PSFCF devices of different molecular weights (Table S5, ESI†). Both PIFCF and PSFCF solar cells show a broad EQE response from 300 to 800 nm; the Jsc values calculated from integrating the EQE are in agreement (±5%) with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements.
2.6 Charge transfer state and energy loss in PIFCF and PSFCF solar cells
The Eloss in PIPCP:PC61BM is among the lowest obtained for a polymer/fullerene solar cell blend system with PCE > 6%. The analysis on PIPCP:PC61BM revealed that the charge transfer state energy (Ect) and polymer singlet (S1) energy are very close, differing only by ≈50 meV, thereby reducing potential losses associated with formation of the charge transfer species.16 Note that the performance of PIPCP:PC71BM is similar to PIPCP:PC61BM, with a Voc of 0.86 ± 0.01 eV (ref. 14) and Eloss = 0.55 eV. However, as shown in Table 2, the Eloss values of both PIFCF and PSFCF solar cells are 0.82 eV and 0.78 eV, respectively, significantly higher than what was achieved with PIPCP (0.52 eV). In order to understand the increase in the Eloss values, we examined the different contributions that make up the value. Eloss can be split into two contributions: Eg − Ect can provide information about the energy losses due to energetic offsets for charge transfer, while Ect − eVoc is the result of potential losses due to charge recombination. To identify the source of the larger Eloss in the FBT polymers, we determined the Ect values by using Marcus theory equations for reduced absorption (eqn (1)) and reduced emission (eqn (2)), fit simultaneously to EQE and electroluminescence (EL) spectra collected from solar cell devices.64 (1) (2)in these equations: E is the photon energy; k is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the temperature. The fit parameters are: CT state energy, Ect; the reorganization energy, λ; and a factor proportional to the number of CT states and the square of their coupling matrix with the ground state, f. The CT state is identified in EQE and EL measurements as absorption or emission at sub-bandgap energies. In the case of most solar cell blends studied to date, the shape of the blend EQE spectrum resembles the spectra of the neat materials, and decreases sharply at energies below the bandgap of the neat materials. The CT state is identified in log-scale EQE spectra as a shoulder at low energies which deviates from the sharp decrease as seen from the neat material EQE spectra.65,66 The EQE, EL and the corresponding fits and fit parameters are shown in Fig. 5. For reference, the EQE spectra of the neat polymers and fullerenes are also provided in the figure. In general, we attribute photocurrent generation at energies that are below the bandgap of the polymer or fullerene as photocurrent generation from the CT state, with certain exceptions which will be discussed below. It is paramount that the fitting to obtain Ect is done on both the EQE and the EL, instead of only the EQE, in order to reduce the degrees of freedom in the fits, especially for the case of PIPCP and PIFCF solar cells. The Ect values obtained by this analysis are summarized in Table 3 and a general layout of Eloss is provided in Fig. 6.

The light-colored spectra are the normalized EQE response of the neat polymers or fullerenes. The obtained fit parameters are reported for each blend.

 Fig. 6  Breakdown of the Eloss = Eg − eVoc in PIPCP:PC61BM, PIFCF:PC61BM, PIFCF:PC71BM, and PSFCF:PC71BM. Eloss is broken into Eg − Ect (dark shaded area) and Ect − eVoc (light shaded area). We emphasize here the difficulty in accurately determining the Ect values in these blends, as is discussed in the main text. 
Examination of Fig. 5b reveals that PIFCF:PC61BM shows significant charge generation at energies below the EQE response of the neat polymer or fullerene, while the characteristic signature (shoulder to the EQE) of the CT state is absent. At energies below 1.7 eV, the EQE spectrum of the solar cell blend deviates from the shape of the EQE of neat PIFCF or PC61BM. This resembles the EQE of PIPCP:PC61BM (Fig. 5a), which also shows significant charge generation at sub-bandgap energies, and no obvious CT state shoulder in the EQE. A red-shift in the absorption, with no clear CT state shoulder, is not often observed for OPV systems.64 However, similar phenomenon was observed in PIPCP:PC61BM blends (Fig. 5a), in which case we speculate that the red-shifted absorption results from morphological reorganization upon blending with PC61BM, thus altering the absorption spectrum of PIPCP.16 The CT state absorption in PIPCP:PC61BM is hidden within the absorption of PIPCP since Eg and Ect are very close in energy for that blend. Similarly, it may be that PIFCF polymer chains undergo a morphological and energetic shift upon blending with PC61BM or PC71BM, resulting in the red-shifted absorption. Unlike PIPCP, however, the EQE of PIFCF is not indicative of a highly ordered system, as the absorption tail is very broad and does not follow an exponential dependence on photon energy.16 Therefore, it is probable that also in this case the CT sate absorption is buried within the absorption of PIFCF.
Such spectral broadening significantly complicates determination of Ect in PIFCF blends, as it is not possibly to confidently identify a feature of CT state absorption alone. Therefore, we must use the EL spectra of the corresponding devices to confine the fitting parameters. However, the EL spectra of PIFCF (and PSFCF) blends present additional difficulties for an accurate fit to determine the Ect. First, on the low-energy side, the EL spectra continue past the sensitivity limit of the Si detector used for these measurements. Second, the EL spectra are broadened towards high photon energies, indicating that the spectra may be composed of singlet emission in addition to CT state emission. In this case, only the low-energy side of the EL spectra would be relevant for determining the Ect. For these reasons, we focus our fits on the low-energy side of the EL spectra. The spectral ranges of the EQE and EL spectra where the fit was done were chosen such that the fit to the low-energy EL and EQE were both optimized. We proceed with the analysis to establish estimates for Ect values, while acknowledging these uncertainty in the fits.
The Eloss of PIFCF:PC61BM solar cells (0.81 eV) is much higher than the Eloss of PIPCP:PC61BM solar cells (0.52 eV). The reason the Eloss in PIFCF-based solar cells is greater lies in losses that can be attributed to charge-transfer losses, Eg − Ect = 0.30 eV, compared to Eg − Ect = 0.01 eV in PIPCP-based solar cells (see Table 3). The added loss due to Eg − Ect correlates well with the smaller EA (i.e., destabilized LUMO level) of PIFCF compared to PIPCP (3.55 vs. 3.79 eV, see Table 1), indicating of losses due to energetic offsets. The differences between Eg − Ect values of PIPCP and PIFCF solar cells are also evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as will be elaborated below. It is interesting to note that the Ect − eVoc of PIPCP- and PIFCF-based solar cells is low, at 0.51 eV for both.
In contrast to PIPCP and PIFCF, PSFCF-based solar cells show EQE spectra that track in shape to the EQE response of the neat polymer and exhibit a clear (albeit small) shoulder in the low energy regime, which is characteristic of CT state contribution to the EQE. This is similar to what has been observed for other OPV blends.65,66 Nonetheless, PSFCF solar cells also have a larger Eloss (0.78 eV) when compared to PIPCP solar cells (0.51 eV). The larger Eloss in PSFCF solar cells is a result of a larger Eg − Ect = 0.19 eV (charge transfer losses), as well as a larger Ect − eVoc = 0.59 eV (charge recombination losses). The EA of PSFCF (3.59 eV) is smaller compared to PIPCP (3.79 eV), correlating with the Eg − Ect differences. While there may be a larger-than-conventional uncertainty in the fits, given the unusual EQE and EL spectra of these blends, we wish to emphasize that the trends observed here are more dependent on the difference in Eg and eVoc values, as the Ect values are relatively close to each other (∼0.6 eV difference). Even if one were to ignore the difference in Ect values and treat them as within error of each other, the trend discussed above would still be the same.
Empirical observations have correlated Ect − eVoc = 0.6 ± 0.1 eV,28,64–67 describing bimolecular recombination losses. These recombination losses can be further split into radiative and non-radiative recombination losses.64 Non-radiative recombination has been identified as among the primary reasons that the Voc in OPV devices has remained limited,65 and until recently, little was understood about the nature of non-radiative recombination. However, a recent comprehensive study by Benduhn et al. has shown a clear correlation between Ect and the magnitude of voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination, suggesting that the nature of the non-radiative losses may lie in the C–C bonds, intrinsic to organic semiconductors.28 The losses due to Ect − eVoc in the systems studied here fit within the empirical trend observed for all other studied OPV systems.
As an aside, we point out that while it may be tempting to tie the results in Table 3 back to the superior PCE of PSFCF relative to PIFCF, it is evident that the electronic state energies alone cannot account for the difference in device performance. PSFCF-based solar cells have superior FF and Jsc values compared to PIFCF-based solar cells. As illustrated by Eg − Ect in Table 3, this is not due to a superior driving force for charge transfer in PSFCF. It is noted that PSFCF blend film has greater absorbance relative to the PIFCF blend film (see Fig. S7, ESI†), which would affect the Jsc. Furthermore, hole mobility measurements of polymer:PC71BM blend films show that PSFCF:PC71BM blend (μh = 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) exhibits a greater mobility relative to PIFCF:PC71BM blend (μh = 8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Hole and electron transport are more balanced in PSFCF:PC71BM (μe = 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than PIFCF:PC71BM (μe = 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (see Fig. S9b and c, ESI†). Our current thinking is that the key for the enhanced FF and Jsc may lie in the improved charge carrier mobility of PSFCF (which may improve extraction vs. bimolecular recombination59,60) or perhaps morphological details (see Fig. S11, ESI†) that may affect charge generation vs. geminate recombination, as well as transport.68 According to the chemical design, it is likely that the bulky phenyl groups connecting the solubilizing chains to the IDT units in PIFCF and PIPCP disrupt close π–π interchain packing, reducing favourable intermolecular interactions for charge transport.51,69,70 Consistent with this idea is that the π–π stacking distance, determined by GIWAXS measurements, is 3.8 Å in PSFCF and 4.0 Å in PIFCF neat films (Fig. 3), and 4.3 Å for PIPCP neat films (Fig. S10, ESI†).14
2.7 Time-dependent density functional theory calculations
The close structural relationship between PIPCP and PIFCF, together with the differences in Eg − Ect values, provides an interesting case study on how molecular-scale features impact the energies of relevant electronic states. A number of initial polymer–fullerene configurations for PIFCF and PC61BM were randomly generated by forming an interaction between the fullerene molecule and different locations on the polymer backbone fragment (Fig. S14, ESI†). These configurations were optimized at the ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) level. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out on the optimized geometries at the long-range corrected OT-PCM-ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) (ε = 3.5) level of theory.71–73 The calculations carried out for PIFCF are compared with the calculations previously performed on PIPCP and PC61BM.17Fig. 7 shows the calculated energies for S1 and Ect in PIPCP:PC61BM and PIFCF:PC61BM.
 Fig. 7  Calculations of S1 and Ect excitation energies for (a) PIPCP:PC61BM (adapted from ref. 17) and (b) PIFCF:PC61BM, at a range of different donor:acceptor configurations. The configurations are shown in the ESI, Fig. S14.† 
TD-DFT calculations predict on average that the difference between the S1 and Ect excitation energies in PIPCP and PC61BM is 27 meV, compared to an average difference of 234 meV for PIFCF and PC61BM. The differences in energies between S1 and Ect for the two donor:acceptor interactions (PIPCP:PC61BM vs. PIFCF:PC61BM) are in good agreement with the experimentally calculated Eg − Ect, and contribute to the explanation for the larger Eloss in PIFCF:fullerene solar cells.
We further note that calculations on PIPCP:PC61BM show that the electron in the excited Ect state is shared between PC61BM and PIPCP (while the hole remains on the polymer chain), and that at certain donor:acceptor configurations S1 even appears to be lower in energy than Ect.16 In contrast, such an energetic inversion of S1 and Ect is not observed for PIFCF:PC61BM, and similarly the calculations for Ect in this system show only marginal electron density on the polymer (Fig. S15, ESI†). The distribution of the electron density in the Ect over both fullerene and polymer chain is a consequence of the very small energetic offset Eg − Ect, which was characterized for that system both experimentally and by calculations, and of the strong electronic mixing between the two states.17
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we report on the synthesis and characterization of two narrow optical gap conjugated polymers PIFCF (IDT–FBT–CPDT–FBT) and PSFCF (SiIDT–FBT–CPDT–FBT) that were designed to probe how structural variations influence the energy losses in organic solar cells. Their structures are based on the previously reported PIPCP (IDT–PT–CPDT–PT). Regioregular control over the precise orientation of the FBT fragments relative to the backbone vector was achieved by chemical selectivity of metal-mediated cross coupling reactions. Compared to the PT-based regioregular PIPCP, the weaker ICT in the FBT-analog polymers resulted in blue-shifted absorption spectra and smaller EAs. When compared to PIPCP, which demonstrated Eloss = 0.52 eV, the Eloss loss in FBT-based analogs increased to 0.82 eV and 0.79 eV for PIFCF and PSFCF based solar cells, respectively. Determination of the Ect reveals that the greater Eloss in PIFCF solar cells is due to losses in Eg − Ect = 0.30 eV, while the loss from Ect − eVoc = 0.51 eV is as low as in PIPCP:PC61BM. This is not the case for PIFCF:PC61BM. PSFCF based solar cells lose energy from Eg − Ect = 0.19 eV, as well as Ect − eVoc = 0.59 eV. The losses due to Eg − Ect correlate well with the changes in the EA of the donor polymers: Eg − Ect = 0.3, 0.19, 0.01 eV, and EA = 3.55, 3.59, 3.79 eV, for PIFCF, PSFCF, and PIPCP, respectively. The losses due to charge recombination (Ect − eVoc) for the polymers studied here follow the empirical trend observed for organic solar cells, Ect − eVoc = 0.6 ± 0.1 eV. PIFCF and PIPCP are at the bottom of the distribution with Ect − eVoc = 0.51 eV, while PSFCF solar cells lose 0.58 eV to recombination losses. The greater loss due to Eg − Ect in PIFCF:PC61BM is supported by theoretical calculations, which predict that on average, the S1 − Ect in PIFCF:PC61BM is 234 meV, while similar calculations on PIPCP:PC61BM predict that S1 − Ect is only 27 meV for PIPCP:PC61BM. Depending on the molecular configuration between PIPCP and PC61BM, the calculations also found that the electron density of the CT state is shared between PC61BM and PIPCP.
Having available three structurally related regioregular donor polymers has therefore allowed us to dissect the different contributions to Eloss in OPV devices. Ect − eVoc is low and similar between PIPCP and PIFCF, which may indicate a particular relationship with the IDT–A–CPDT–A structural combination. That the Eg − Ect contribution to the loss is lower in PIPCP vs. PIFCF reflects the lower electron affinity of PIPCP. The lower electron affinity of PIPCP compared to PIFCF may also explain the greater degree of shared electron density between the fullerene and the PT unit in the backbone of PIPCP.

 	Fig. 5  EQE and EL spectra of (a) PIPCP:PC61BM, (b) PIFCF:PC61BM, (c) PSFCF:PC71BM, and (d) PIFCF:PC71BM devices. Dashed lines are the fit results using eqn (1) and (2), fit to the low-energy tail of the EQE and low-energy peak of the EL simultaneously. The light-colored spectra are the normalized EQE response of the neat polymers or fullerenes. The obtained fit parameters are reported for each blend.

 	Fig. 6  Breakdown of the Eloss = Eg − eVoc in PIPCP:PC61BM, PIFCF:PC61BM, PIFCF:PC71BM, and PSFCF:PC71BM. Eloss is broken into Eg − Ect (dark shaded area) and Ect − eVoc (light shaded area). We emphasize here the difficulty in accurately determining the Ect values in these blends, as is discussed in the main text.
