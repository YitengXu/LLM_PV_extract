    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractWe report a facile one-step chemical method to synthesize partially reduced TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs). The NaBH4 treatment introduces oxygen vacancies on the surface and interior of TiO2. Oxygen vacancy extends the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NTAs from the UV to visible light region, and enhances the electrical conductivity as well as charge transportation. Surface oxygen vacancies serve as charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites where the charge transfer to adsorbed species inhibits the surface charge recombination, whereas bulk oxygen vacancies tend to act as charge carrier traps where e–h recombination occurs. The optimally reduced TiO2 NTAs yield a photocurrent density of 0.73 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and a highest photoconversion efficiency of 1.31% at a rather low bias of 0.40 VRHE under a standard AM 1.5G solar illumination. Not only does the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum increase in the UV region, but photoactivity in visible light also emerged. Surface oxygen vacancies, serving as electron donors, cause a noticeable negative flatband shift and increase the donor density of TiO2 NTAs 2-fold. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra confirm the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface and interior of TiO2. Benefitting from the oxygen vacancy, a narrowed band gap of 2.46 eV and suitable localized states for hydrogen production are observed.
Introduction
Ever since 1971, when Honda and Fujishima discovered the photooxidation of water on titanium dioxide (TiO2),1 the photoactivation of TiO2 has been extensively investigated. To date, TiO2 has been widely applied in photocatalysis for environmental cleanup, solar cells, clean H2 energy production, antibacterial activity and more.2 As one of the most studied photocatalyst materials, TiO2 has many advantages: its abundance, low cost, low toxicity, superior photostability, and high intrinsic catalytic activity under UV illumination.3 However, the solar to hydrogen efficiency of TiO2 is substantially limited by its large band gap energy and electron–hole recombination.4 An enormous amount of research has been focused on enhancing visible light absorption. Metallic and nonmetallic elements doping TiO2 to generate donor or acceptor states in the band gap is a versatile approach to extend the optical absorption to the visible region.5,6 However, problems such as increased carrier recombination centers and decreased incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the UV light absorption region represent significant limitations for this strategy.6 Thereby, to further improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of TiO2 by a doping strategy, an important issue is to solve the diminution of IPCE in the UV region.
Oxygen vacancies (Ti3+) are known to be shallow donors with relatively low formation energy.7 It has been reported that oxygen vacancy plays a critical role in determining the surface and electronic properties of TiO2.8,9 Reduced TiO2 (TiO2−x), which contains Ti3+ or oxygen vacancy, has been demonstrated to exhibit visible light absorption.10,11 The introduced oxygen vacancy creates localized states in the band gap,8,10 which extends its optical absorption to the visible region. Nevertheless, the vacancy states localize at 0.75 to 1.18 eV below the conduction band minimum of rutile phase TiO2 (−0.29 eV), which is lower than the redox potential for hydrogen evolution. Therefore, it is important to develop visible-light responsive TiO2 with high performance for hydrogen production from water splitting. Moreover, the reported methods to produce reduced TiO2 are mainly focus on hydrogenation methods, chemical vapor deposition, and high energy particle (laser, electron or Ar+) bombardment.12,13 However, these strategies need harsh synthesic conditions or expensive facilities which limit their practical application. Furthermore, the surface Ti3+ is unstable in air or in electrolyte as it is easily oxidized by air or dissolved oxygen in water.14–16 Zuo et al.14 reported a combustion method to reduce Ti(IV) to Ti(III) by reducing gas (CO and NO). However, this inevitably introduces foreign species into the TiO2 lattice. Hence, developing a simple and economical strategy to synthesize a stable reduced TiO2 photocatalyst with suitable localized states is still a great challenge.
In addition to enhancing optical absorption, it is equally important to improve the morphology and electronic structure of TiO2 for effective separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers. Vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) prepared on Ti foil by electrochemical anodization are considered to be a very effective structure for PEC water splitting.17 The high surface area, high orientation, and uniform interfacial structure permit significant light absorption depths and enhance the charge separation by providing high electrode–electrolyte interface areas and shortening the minority charge carrier transport distance to the electrolyte.17,18
We hypothesize that reducing TiO2 nanostructures in a reducing reagent will substantially increase the density of oxygen vacancies (donor density) and, thereby, enhance the electrical conductivity as well as charge transportation. To prove this hypothesis, we have focused on NaBH4-treated nanotube arrays (denoted as reduced TiO2 NTAs). NaBH4, a common widely used reducing reagent was chosen because of its high reducing ability of reducing Ti(IV) to Ti(III). The reaction is as follows:NaBH4 + 8OH− → NaBO2 + 8e− + 6H2OTi4+ + e− → Ti3+
In comparison to previously widely adopted hydrogenation at high temperature, this chemical method can avoid the risk of explosion in the experimental procedure. In the present study, we report a facile one-step method to synthesize partially reduced TiO2 NTAs at room temperature, which exhibit high activation for PEC water splitting. The increased surface oxygen vacancy (donor density) decreases the surface recombination centers, enhances the electrical conductivity, and improves the charge transportation. To our knowledge, this is the first simple chemical method to produce one-dimensional reduced TiO2 nanostructures for PEC water splitting.
Experimental details
Fabrication of the reduced TiO2 NTAs on Ti substrate
Before anodization, the titanium foils (Aldrich 0.25 mm, 99.7%) were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol for 5 min each. The cleaned titanium foils were anodized at a constant potential of 80 V in an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O at 5 °C for 30 min in a two-electrode configuration with a graphite cathode. After anodic oxidation, the samples were rinsed with ethanol and water and dried in air. The resulting amorphous titania nanotube arrays were annealed at 450 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1 in air to crystallize the tube walls and improve their photocatalytic activity. Finally the annealed nanotube arrays were dipped in 0.1 M NaBH4 for different times at room temperature followed by rinsing with water and air drying.
Characterization
The morphologies were studied using a JEOL JSM 6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The phase of the samples was identified by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, RINT 2000; Rigaku Corp.) employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were obtained on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2500PC; Shimadzu Corp.). Raman spectra were obtained on a laser Raman spectrometer (NRS-1000, Jasco Corp.) with a backscattering configuration using an Ar+ laser (20 mW, 532 nm) as excitation source. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed in a Theta probe (Thermo Fisher) using monochromated Al Kα X-rays at hν = 1486.6 eV. Peak positions were internally referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) of the samples was recorded to confirm the presence of high spin Ti3+ as well as oxygen vacancy on a JES-FA200 Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer.
Photoelectrochemical activity measurement
PEC activity measurements were performed with a CHI electrochemical analyzer (ALS/CH model 650A) using a standard three-electrode mode with 1 M NaOH (pH = 13.9) solution as the electrolyte. The reduced TiO2 NTA photoanodes were used as working electrodes; a Pt sheet served as counter-electrode. An Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode (RE-1C; BAS Inc.) was used as the reference electrode. A 500 W Xe lamp (Optical ModuleX; Ushio Inc.) was used as the solar light source, and the incident light intensity at 300–800 nm was measured to be 0.6 W cm−2 using a spectroradiometer (USR-40; Ushio Inc.). The simulated sunlight was obtained by an AM 1.5 solar simulation (WXS-80C-3 AM 1.5G) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a voltage scan speed of 0.01 V s−1 and the light was chopped manually at regular intervals. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated from chronoamperometry measurements using a motorized monochrometer (M10; Jasco Corp.). The measured potential vs. the Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + EoAg/AgClwhere ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and EoAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at similar conditions as described above for photoelectrochemical tests. The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was 5 mV and the frequency range examined was 100 kHz to 1 Hz.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting
PEC water splitting was carried out in an Ar gas flow system. The amounts of evolved gases were determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Ar carrier). The light source was a 300 W Xe-lamp (Hayashi Tokei, Luminar Ace 210). A cutoff filter of 420 nm was employed for the visible-light irradiation. The light intensity (0.37 W cm−2) was measured by a spectroradiometer (Ushio, USR-40). The electrolytes were bubbled with N2 or Ar before measurements to remove dissolved O2.
Results and discussion
Morphology characterization
The FE-SEM image in Fig. 1A indicates that the TiO2 NTAs have an average length of ∼7 μm and inner pore diameter of approximately 100 nm. The presence of well-aligned NTs vertically oriented from the Ti foil substrate promotes directional charge transport due to the one-dimensional features of the tubes. Fig. 1B shows that the reduced TiO2 NTAs after NaBH4 treatment have kept their porous structure, indicating the NaBH4 treatment has not destroyed the nanostructure of TiO2 NTAs. Closer observation reveals that the reduced nanotubes in Fig. 1B clearly separate with each other and the wall gets thinner compared with the pristine nanotubes shown in Fig. 1A. This indicates that NaBH4 has indeed reacted with TiO2. According to a previous report, thinner walls benefit the charge transport in TiO2 NTAs.17,18 We can infer that the reduced TiO2 NTAs promise a high photocatalytic activity.

Photoelectrochemical properties
We have studied the photocurrents of reduced TiO2 NTA photoanodes as a function of NaBH4 treatment time, and then compared them to that of the pristine TiO2 NTAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, all of the reduced TiO2 NTAs have higher photoactivity than the pristine TiO2 NTAs. Significantly, a 3-fold enhanced photocurrent density for the 40 min NaBH4 treated sample is observed. Fig. 2B shows that the photocurrent densities of reduced TiO2 NTAs, obtained at a potential bias of 1.23 VRHE, increase gradually with the increase of the NaBH4 treatment time from 10 to 40 min. The 40 min treated sample yields a maximum photocurrent density of 5.64 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. The photocurrent density of reduced TiO2 NTAs decrease, as the NaBH4 treatment time is further increased above 40 min. Photocatalysis or PEC reactions primarily take place on the catalyst surface. The reaction efficiencies and related mechanisms would be greatly determined by surface properties, such as surface oxygen vacancy. If the surface interfacial electron transfer rate and photocurrent is large, the PEC performance is high. It is reported that surface oxygen vacancies serve as charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites where the charge transfer to adsorbed species can prevent e–h recombination, whereas bulk oxygen vacancies tend to act as charge carrier traps where e–h recombination occurs.19 A longer NaBH4 treatment would cause a high concentration of bulk oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and result in a reduced photocatalytic efficiency. Similar results are obtained on surface fluorinated-TiO2 nanoporous film.20

Fig. 3 shows that reduced TiO2 NTAs present higher photocurrents than pristine TiO2 NTAs. The photocurrent of 40 min reduced TiO2 NTAs reaches 0.732 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, while pristine TiO2 NTAs only contribute 0.193 mA cm−2. Moreover, the 60 min reduced TiO2 NTAs show an obvious decay following the initial fast increase of currents, suggesting a classical onset of recombination,21–23 while the pristine and short time reduced TiO2 NTAs do not show this character, confirming that inner oxygen vacancies serve as charge carrier traps where the electron–hole recombination occurs.

To investigate the effect of NaBH4 treatment on the PEC performance of TiO2 NTAs, Fig. 4A compares the linear sweeps of pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs prepared with different NaBH4 treatment time, in a potential range of 0 to 1.6 VRHE. As shown in Fig. 4A, upon illumination, the current gradually increases with increasing applied potential from 0 to 0.4 VRHE, indicating photogenerated hole–electron separation resulting from the electric field.24,25 At higher potentials (E > 0.4 VRHE), a saturation of the photoresponse is observed for all the samples. Beranek et al.26 ascribed this limit of photocurrent to the field distribution on the nanotubes. For a tube shaped n-type semiconductor, the majority carrier-depleted zones, the space-charge layers, are generated at both sides of the tube walls, while for compact layer film, the potential dependence is in line with the Gärtner model27 predicting Iph ∝ E0.5. In comparison to pristine TiO2 NTAs, the reduced TiO2 NTAs exhibit at least two times enhanced photocurrent over the entire potential window. It confirms that NaBH4 treatment is an effective method for enhancing the PEC performance of TiO2 NTAs. The onset potentials of all the reduced TiO2 NTAs shift negatively compared with that of the pristine TiO2 NTAs (from 0.16 VRHE to 0.08 VRHE). The shift in the onset potential might be due to either a lower band bending requirement for separating electrons and holes because of the material's likely possession of better charge–transport properties than pristine TiO2, or faster surface kinetics as a result of NaBH4 treatment.28 The more negative onset potentials on reduced TiO2 NTAs mean that the charge separation and transportation is more efficient. Fig. 4B is the corresponding light energy to chemical energy conversion (photoconversion) efficiency calculated using the following equation:9,29,30η = I(1.23 − V)/Jlightwhere V is the applied bias vs. RHE, I is the photocurrent density at the measured bias, and Jlight is the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The pristine TiO2 sample exhibits an optimal conversion efficiency of 0.32% at 0.48 VRHE. Significantly, the 40 min reduced TiO2 NTAs achieve the highest efficiency of 1.31% at 0.40 VRHE. Likewise, the 20 min and 60 min reduced TiO2 NTAs exhibit the optimal efficiency of 0.85% and 0.57% at a similar applied bias. NaBH4 treatment substantially enhances the photoconversion efficiency of TiO2 NTAs by improving the maximum photocurrent and shifts the onset potential negatively.

To understand the interplay between the photoactivity and light absorption of reduced pristine TiO2 NTAs, we have quantitatively investigated their photoactivity as a function of wavelength of incident light. In comparison to photocurrent density obtained under white light illumination, photocurrents as a function of the wavelength and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are much better parameters to characterize the photoconversion efficiency of different photoanodes because they are independent from the light sources and filters used in the measurement.9,31 IPCE can be expressed by the following equation:3,9IPCE(λ) = 1240jp(λ)/λEλ(λ)Where jp(λ) is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and Eλ(λ) is the incident light power density (mW cm−2) for each wavelength, λ (nm). Fig. 5A shows the measured photocurrent of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs as a function of the wavelength and Fig. 5B contains the corresponding IPCE spectra. Fig. 5 shows that the reduced TiO2 NTAs exhibit significantly enhanced photoactivity in the UV region. Particularly, the reduced TiO2 NTAs have the highest IPCE values of 68.7% at 330 nm, which is 2 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 NTAs. It indicates that the UV light was effectively used for PEC water splitting, in which the separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers are very efficient in the reduced TiO2 NTAs.9 Significantly, the IPCE values show a small peak at 460 nm (Fig. 5B, inset). This is direct evidence for a visible light photoresponse of reduced TiO2 NTAs. The enhanced visible light photoresponse is not at the expense of IPCE in UV region, which is not consistent with previous reports. These results described here confirm that the enhanced photocurrent in reduced TiO2 NTAs is mainly attributed to the improved IPCE in the UV region, while the newly developed visible light absorption also made a partial contribution.

To gain more in-depth understanding of the charge–transport properties of reduced and pristine TiO2 NTAs, we investigated the electron recombination kinetics of these two types of NTAs. The electron recombination kinetics was investigated by monitoring the transient Voc as a function of time upon turning off the illumination. Under open-circuit conditions, electrons accumulate within the nanostructure semiconductor films following solar light irradiation and shifting the apparent Fermi level to negative potentials. Once the illumination is stopped, the accumulated electrons are slowly discharged because they are scavenged by redox species in the electrolyte.32 The electron density in the conduction band decays sharply due to charge recombination, with the Voc decay rate directly determined by the recombination rate. Fig. 6A and Fig. S1† plot the Voc decay as a function of time measured based on the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTA anodes. It is evident that the reduced TiO2 NTA anode has a significantly slower Voc decay rate than that based on pristine TiO2 NTAs, suggesting slow recombination kinetics in reduced TiO2 NTAs. From the Voc decay rate, the lifetime of photogenerated electrons (τn), the average time that the photogenerated electrons exist before they recombine, can be calculated by the following expression:33–35τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and e is the elementary charge. The calculated τn is plotted in Fig. 6B as a function of Voc for the two types of anodes. It is observed that τn of the reduced TiO2 NTAs is longer than that of pristine TiO2 NTAs. The extended τn observed in reduced TiO2 NTAs compared to that observed in pristine TiO2 NTAs may be attributed to the surface defects, which act as adsorption sites benefiting the charge carrier transportation.

EIS provides a powerful method for the study of charge transfer and recombined processes at semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces.20,36,37 A typical Nyquist plot obtained at different potentials in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution for the illuminated pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs is shown in Fig. 7. After NaBH4 treatment, the light EIS arc of the electrode becomes smaller at the same potential. According to previous results,20,37 the smaller size of the semicircle arc diameter indicates a more effective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pair and/or a faster interfacial charge transfer to the electron donor–acceptor.

Additionally, the flatband potential (Efb) of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs was calculated using the following Mott–Schottky equation:38,391/C2 = (2/e0εε0Nd)(Eapp − Efd − KT/e0)Here, C is the differential capacitance of the Helmholtz layer, e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of TiO2 (ε = 10),26ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, Nd the donor density, and Eapp the applied bias at the electrode. Fig. 8A shows the Mott–Schottky plots for the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs at a frequency of 1 kHz. The Efb was estimated to be 0.45 and 0.38 VRHE for pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs, respectively. The exceptionally low Efb for reduced TiO2 NTAs indicates a very efficient charge separation and transportation. The negative shift of Efb upon NaBH4 reduction is reported here for the first time in aqueous solution. In fact, Fig. 4A has shown indirect evidence for that. According to the well-known Gärtner equation, where only the recombination of photocarriers in bulk phase is considered,39 the onset potential of photocurrent corresponds to the flatband potential. The donor density of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs was determined from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plots. All TiO2 samples show a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots, as expected for n-type semiconductor (Fig. 8A). Importantly, the reduced TiO2 NTAs show substantially smaller slopes of Mott–Schottky plot compared to the pristine TiO2 sample, suggesting an increase of donor densities. The donor densities were calculated from the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots using the equation:Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dEapp]−1
 Fig. 8  (A) Mott–Schottky plots of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs collected at a frequency of 1 kHz. (B) Measured parallel capacitance (Cp) versus the applied potential plot at 50 Hz for the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs. 
The calculated donor densities of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs are 8.93 × 1017 and 2.06 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. NaBH4 treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 NTAs 2-fold, by creating surface oxygen vacancies that serves as electron donors.7,9 The increased donor density enhances the electrical conductivity as well as charge transport in TiO2. Moreover, the increased donor density is expected to shift the Fermi level of TiO2 toward the conduction band.8,9 The upward shift of the Fermi level facilitates the charge separation at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, by increasing the degree of band bending at the TiO2 surface.9 The enhanced charge separation and transportation are the major reasons for the observed IPCE enhancement. Fig. 8B shows the parallel capacitance (Cp) plotted against the applied potential. As shown in Fig. 8B, one peak appears at 0.05 VRHE for pristine TiO2 NTAs. According to the previous conclusions, the different positions of the capacitance peak may involve diverse surface defects.20 This indicates that there is only one kind of surface defect on the pristine TiO2 NTAs, whereas for the reduced TiO2, the peak density decreases and a new peak at 0.2 VRHE emerges. This indicates that the reduction process decreases the original surface defects on TiO2 and even possibly gave rise to new surface defects.
To guarantee that the obtained photocurrent is due to water splitting, it is important to determine the amounts of evolved H2 and O2 for PEC water splitting. Fig. 9 shows PEC water splitting using a reduced TiO2 NTA film with 0.2 VAg/AgCl. The amount of H2 evolved is similar to the half of the amount of electrons passing through the outer circuit. This result indicates that the observed photocurrent is due to water splitting. It should be noted that no other byproducts except H2 and O2 were detected by the gas chromatography, which means there is no other reaction happened during the water splitting.

Optical properties

Fig. 10 shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the pristine and reduced TiO2 NTAs. The pristine TiO2 NTAs are only active under UV irradiation while the photoresponse of reduced TiO2 NTAs is effectively extended into the visible and near infrared regions. It is reported that the visible and infrared absorption is positively related to oxygen vacancy in TiO2. The inset shows that the band gap of the reduced and pristine TiO2 NTAs, estimated from the main absorption edge of the profile, are about 2.99 and 3.09 eV, respectively. This decrease in the band gap is consistent with the assumption that an electronic band is located just below the conduction band of pure TiO2.

We used Raman spectroscopy to examine surface structural changes in the TiO2 nanocrystals after the introduction of oxygen vacancy by NaBH4 treatment. The three polymorphs of TiO2 belong to different space groups: D4h (ref. 19) (I41/amd) for anatase, D2h (ref. 15) (pbca) for brookite and D4h (ref. 14) (P42/mnm) for rutile, which have distinctive characteristics in Raman spectra.13 The pristine TiO2 NTAs display three anatase Raman bonds at 396.9, 511.4 and 634.8 cm−1, whereas new small bands at 244.9 and 322.0 cm−1 emerge for the reduced TiO2 NTAs (Fig. 11). These two new Raman bands cannot be assigned to any of the three polymorphs of TiO2, which indicates that surface structural changes occur after NaBH4 treatment.

The PL spectra of anatase TiO2 materials are mainly attributed to three kinds of physical origins: self-trapped exciton, oxygen vacancy, and surface defect.40,41 Clearly, in comparison to the pristine TiO2 NTAs, the reduced TiO2 NTAs show four new bands at 420.4, 449.2, 464.4 and 495.0 nm (Fig. 12). The first two new bands are ascribed to surface defects and the latter two bands are associated with the oxygen vacancies forming at the surface of TiO2 NTAs.42,43 The emergence of surface oxygen vacancies is also supported by the results of Cp as discussed above. The proposed new surface oxygen vacancies and/or the shift in the positions of surface oxygen vacancies may act as the radiate recombination sites.

We examined the change of surface chemical bonding of TiO2 nanocrystals induced by NaBH4 treatment with XPS. Oxygen 1s XPS profiles shown in Fig. 13A are slightly shifted to lower energy after reduction process. The shift is in line with the transfer of electrons to the neighboring oxygen vacancies. We also observed a similar shift for Ti2p, as shown in Fig. 13B. This might suggest migration of electrons bound to oxygen and titanium ions towards oxygen vacancies, the latter serving as electron traps.44–46 The density of states (DOS) of the valence band (VB) of TiO2 nanocrystals was also measured by valence band XPS (Fig. 13C). The pristine TiO2 NTAs displayed typical valence band DOS characteristics of TiO2, with the edge of the maximum energy at ∼2.03 eV below the Fermi energy. Since the optical band gap of pristine TiO2 NTAs is 3.09 eV (Fig. 10 inset), the conduction band (CB) minimum would occur at −1.06 eV. On the other hand, the VB maximum energy of reduced TiO2 NTAs showed notable blue-shift to ∼1.50 eV and was followed by a band tail further toward ∼0.97 eV. Combined with the results from optical measurements that suggest a narrowed band gap, the CB minimum of the reduced TiO2 NTAs would occur at −1.49 eV. A schematic illustration of the DOS of reduced and pristine TiO2 NTAs is shown in Fig. 13D. Chen et al. reported that the surface disorder induces a substantial shift (2.18 eV) of the VB position for hydrogenated black TiO2 NPs,13 while Naldoni et al.47 recently prepared TiO2 NPs with crystalline and defective cores and disordered shells, which induces a remarkable band gap narrowing (1.85 eV). In our case, NaBH4 treatment is an effective method to introduce surface defect (oxygen vacancy) into TiO2 NTAs. The surface defect induces a band gap narrowing (2.46 eV) based on the already predicted slight VB tailing. Furthermore, oxygen vacancy introduce localized states at 0.75–1.18 eV below the CB minimum of TiO2.8,10 Electronic transitions from both tailed VB and oxygen vacancy localized states are responsible for the reduced TiO2 vis-NIR absorption. The energy positions of localized states are calculated as −0.74 to −0.31 eV, which contributed to the high performance for hydrogen production from water splitting.

To test for the presence of Ti3+, low temperature EPR spectra are recorded in Fig. 14. The reduced TiO2 NTAs give rise to a very strong EPR signal, while no signal is seen for the pristine TiO2 NTAs. In the EPR spectra of reduced TiO2 NTAs, there are three features: signals from electrons (Ti3+), holes and O2−, which are labeled as signals A, B and C, respectively. The sharp signal at g ≈ 1.985 is assigned to surface electron trapping sites in anatase TiO2,14,48 and is represented as signal A. The EPR signal with g value of 2.002 is due to surface hole trapping sites48 and is represented as signal B. The surface Ti3+ would tend to adsorb atmospheric O2, which could be reduced to O2− and shows EPR signal C at g-value of ∼2.03.49 Significant increases in signal A, B are obtained by increasing the NaBH4 treatment time from 20 min to 40 min. On further increase of the NaBH4 treatment time to 60 min, signals A and B decrease and signal C increases sharply, which means large amounts of surface Ti3+ are oxidized by adsorbed O2. Among the three reduced TiO2 NTAs, the 40 min sample shows the highest ratio of surface Ti3+ signal to superoxide (O2−) radical signal. This phenomenon indicates that NaBH4 treatment for short time reduces surface TiO2 into Ti3+ (oxygen vacancy). However, extended treatment will cause oxidation of surface oxygen vacancies. More surface oxygen vacancy results in better photoactivity. This is the reason that 40 min sample shows the highest photoactivity performance.

Stability and reproducibility
To test the stability of the samples, long time solar light illumination was performed. After 1 hour of solar light (AM 1.5G) illumination, the reduced TiO2 NTAs retain their 90% photocurrent. Stored in air for one month, the sample still retained 80% of its initial visible light absorbance response. The reproducibility was tested on five samples; the inter-assay relative standard deviation is 1.82%. These results indicate good stability and excellent reproducibility of the sample.
Conclusions
Through a simple one-step chemical method partially reduced TiO2 NTAs can be prepared. The PEC activity of the reduced TiO2 NTAs is dependent on the NaBH4 treatment time. The TiO2 NTAs with a partially reduced surface exhibit enhanced visible light absorption and increased IPCE in the UV and visible regions. NaBH4 treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 NTAs 2-fold, by creating surface oxygen vacancies that serves as electron donors. The introduced surface oxygen vacancies account for the negative-shifted flatband potential; decreased surface recombination centers and favorable charge transfer rate. Benefitting from the oxygen vacancy, a narrowed band gap of 2.46 eV and suitable localized states for hydrogen production are observed. The present study sheds light on the importance of surface oxygen vacancy for narrowing the band gap and for the development of a highly active photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.
