    , Accepted 1st November 2011First published on 14th November 2011AbstractUpconversion photochemistry occurring between palladium(II) octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP, 1) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA, 2) in toluene successfully sensitizes nanostructured WO3 photoanodes (Eg = 2.7 eV) to sub-bandgap non-coherent green photons at low power density.
One of the main barriers to the performance of single-junction solar cells exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit is their inability to harvest the complete solar spectrum, particularly at lower energies with respect to the bandgap.1 A potentially useful strategy towards realizing sub-bandgap photon capture and conversion in these devices lies in the phenomenon of regenerative photochemical upconversion based on sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), a process resulting in the frequency upconversion of light.2 In general terms, photon upconversion is facilitated by selective excitation of strongly absorbing sensitizer chromophores that internally convert to the long-lived lowest energy triplet excited state with high quantum efficiency. Dexter-type triplet–triplet energy transfer then occurs from the sensitizer to the acceptor, and finally between two excited acceptors (TTA), the latter producing the desired annihilation fluorescence. In the majority of recent cases, late transition metal-based sensitizers are used in tandem with a variety of organic-based triplet acceptors/annihilators in fluid solution,2 and the upconverted photons are easily visualized by the naked eye. As the quantum efficiencies of these processes have already been demonstrated to be substantial,2–5 exceeding the spin statistical limit of 11.1% likely due to recycling of excited states in the upconversion cycle,6 widespread device integration appears inevitable. While proof-of-principle photovoltaic device integration experiments have been demonstrated in rare-earths,7 the phenomenon of sensitized triplet fusion-based upconversion has not been shown to generate any current response in a photoanode to date.
The present experimental effort explores the concept of utilizing molecular upconversion phenomena to achieve photoaction from sub-bandgap photons in a prototypical photoelectrochemical cell. We postulated whether selected portions of the solar spectrum could be frequency shifted through upconversion to spectrally align with optical transitions within wide bandgap semiconductors, thereby achieving long wavelength light harvesting without chemical modification of the functional material. This is conceptually identical to employing upconversion phenomena to drive sub-bandgap responses from photovoltaics, with the advantage of detection sensitivity. Fig. 1 presents the strategy for integrating frequency upconversion into photoelectrochemical cells where oxidation takes place at a WO3 semiconductor photoanode (Eg = 2.7 eV)8 and hydrogen is produced at a dark Pt cathode in a standard 3-electrode arrangement.8–13 It is worth noting that the formation of peroxides at the anode is inevitable in the absence of an appropriate oxygen evolving catalyst due to the slow kinetics of water oxidation.8 The anode is photoactivated through the benchmark upconverting composition (PdOEP (1) and DPA (2) in toluene)14–17 contained inside a vacuum degassed optical cell that is placed near the working electrode. The optical output of a 300 W Xe lamp is passed through a water filter and two 500 nm long pass filters prior to entering a bifurcated fiber optic bundle, ultimately delivering long wavelength (divergent) excitation photons (λex > 500 nm) to the upconversion cell (from two sides) at a broadband power density of 32 mW cm−2. In the present instance, upconverted photons are being stochastically collected at the WO3 photoanode and no attempts were made to improve optical coupling.

Nanoscopic WO3 colloidal photoanodes of 10 μm thickness were deposited on FTO glass (1 cm2 active area) and used as the working electrode (1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte) in the experiment depicted in the photograph in Fig. 1. The electrode was biased to +0.9 V vs.Ag/AgCl, conditions enabling detection of stable and reproducible photocurrents arising from PdOEP/DPA upconversion pumping initiated with broadband non-coherent lamp excitation above 500 nm. It is important to note that most of the 32 mW cm−2 optical power density contained in this long-passed excitation is not absorbed by PdOEP so the present experiment is truly conservative with respect to what can be achieved with higher incident optical powers. Fig. 2a and 2b present the current/time plots and linear sweep voltammograms, respectively, obtained under modulated (on/off) long wavelength excitation directed at the upconversion optical cell after passing through the electrolyte solution (see Fig. 1). The isolated toluene solution contained in the optical cell is either degassed (red line) or aerated (black line), conditions enabling or nearly quantitatively quenching the upconversion process, respectively. Since the upconversion photochemistry relies exclusively on the efficient generation of the triplet excited states of both sensitizer and acceptor/annihilator, dissolved O2 strongly competes for these formed triplets. Clearly, the blue photons (λmax = 432 nm) generated from the upconversion process, presented as singlet DPA fluorescence, become randomly absorbed by the WO3 anode resulting in measurable photocurrents under quite modest non-coherent excitation conditions. The measured photoresponses are justifiably small (Fig. 2) given the fact that these proof-of-concept experiments rely exclusively on the stochastic collection of photons at the WO3 photoanode, which can be greatly improved upon in terms of geometric format, light delivery, and photon collection. Please note that removal of either chromophore from the composition completely ceased all sub-bandgap sensitization of the WO3 electrode. To further substantiate that the upconversion process is solely responsible for all generated photocurrent, sub-bandgap photoaction spectra were measured for the vacuum degassed composition from Fig. 2. In order to calculate the relative incident photoaction efficiency as a function of excitation wavelength,11,13,18 the photocurrent was measured in the same three electrode arrangement as described above, however, the excitation source was changed to a 450 W Xe lamp coupled to a monochromator, also equipped with appropriate long pass filters.
 Fig. 2  Shuttered current/time response of a WO3 photoanode biased to +0.9 V vs.Ag/AgCl (a) and linear sweep voltammetry of WO3 at 1 mV s−1 (b) in 1.0 M H2SO4 resulting from long wavelength excitation (λex > 500 nm, broadband power density of 32 mW cm−2) of a proximate optical cell containing a mixture of PdOEP (16 μM) and DPA (0.5 mM) in toluene. The red current response is obtained when the upconversion solution is deoxygenated and the black current (control) response occurs when upconversion is almost completely quenched by aerating the toluene. In all instances, the WO3 anode collects the upconverted photons stochastically and the measurements are adjusted to zero baseline for clarity. 

Fig. 3 (red data points) presents the normalized photoresponse from the WO3 anode measured as a function of excitation wavelength (±5 nm) between 500 and 570 nm. Clearly, the relative photocurrent response closely tracks the absorption profile of the PdOEP Q-band absorptions (Fig. 3, blue data points), illustrating that the sub-bandgap response is indeed resulting from the sensitization afforded by the PdOEP/DPA upconversion composition. To estimate the maximum absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) that can be achieved at 515 nm using PdOEP/DPA and a wide bandgap semiconductor electrode, the quantum yield of upconversion (ΦUC) based on two absorbed photons was measured to be ΦUC = 0.36 ± 0.01 under 350 mW cm−2Ar+ laser excitation at 514.5 nm, when A515nm = 0.09. Please note that ΦUC was measured in the strong annihilation regime where the largest possible upconversion yields will be produced.19 Presumably, if all upconverted photons are absorbed and converted into photocurrent with 50% efficiency (IPCE at bandgap) across the DPA emission profile, then APCE515nm = ½ × ΦUC × IPCEbandgap = 9%, representing modest sub-bandgap photoaction at this wavelength. This value can be readily translated across the entire width of the porphyrin Q-band region (∼60 nm), producing a net sensitized photocurrent over its absorption profile.
 Fig. 3  Sub-bandgap normalized photoaction response of a WO3 photoanode measured as a function of wavelength in 1.0 M H2SO4 at +0.9 V vs.Ag/AgCl forward bias. The photoaction (λex = 500–570 nm, 5 nm steps) is generated from selective excitation of an upconversion composition (16 μM PdOEP and 0.5 mM DPA) that is either degassed (red line) or aerated (black line), respectively, facilitating or quenching the photochemical upconversion process. The blue data points represent normalized PdOEP absorption values at selected wavelengths. 
In summary, sub-bandgap photoaction from a prototypical wide bandgap semiconductor in a photoelectrochemical cell has been demonstrated for the first time using the concept of photon upconversion. Specifically, nanostructured WO3 photoanodes (Eg = 2.7 eV) in aqueous solution were sensitized to non-coherent green light using the tandem benchmark composition of PdOEP and DPA dissolved under vacuum degassed toluene self-contained in a proximate optical cell. Shuttered light on/light off sub-bandgap photoresponses recorded when the optical cell was either degassed or aerated resulted in the observation of modulated photocurrent or dark current, respectively, demonstrating that upconversion photochemistry was indeed responsible for the generated photocurrent. The normalized photoaction response recorded for the operational composition illustrated that the long wavelength sensitization of the WO3 is intimately tied to the PdOEP Q-band absorptions above 500 nm. Although the current experiments simply intended to demonstrate proof-of-principle, we note that the quantum efficiency of the photocurrent response is strongly dependent on the spatial arrangement of the upconverting composition relative to the electrical device and significant optimization in the near future is envisioned. With improved optical coupling between elements, photon upconversion appears well positioned to assist with long wavelength light harvesting in next generation solar cell materials including dye-sensitized solar cells and organic bulk heterojunctions.
