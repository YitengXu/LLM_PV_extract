    , Accepted 6th March 2023First published on 7th March 2023AbstractTo broaden the application of cesium lead halide perovskites, doping technology has been widely proposed. In this study, we calculated a 12.5% concentration of a Sr-doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) perovskite via density functional theory. The results showed that the bandgap energy of the perovskite increased by 0.2–0.3 eV. The high symmetry points of the energy band changed from R to Γ after Sr doping because the Sr doping affected the initial distribution of atomic orbital hybridization. In addition, optical absorption spectra after doping showed an obvious blueshift, whereas the absorption coefficient of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 had the same magnitude as undoped CsPbX3. Moreover, the effective masses of electrons and holes changed within a small range (0.01–0.03 m0) after Sr doping. According to the findings of this study, the CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 perovskite is expected to become an ideal candidate material for designing photovoltaic and photoelectric devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+ or HC(NH2)2+; B = Pb2+; X = Cl−, Br−, or I−) have many potential applications in the photovoltaic and photoelectronic fields because of their excellent properties, such as a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length.1,2 However, their practical applications still face numerous challenges due to the toxicity of Pb2+ and the poor long-term stability because of the easy decomposition of organic cations under hot or humid conditions.3,4 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to resolve the stability and toxicity issues. To solve the problem of organic cation decomposition, substituting organic cations for Cs ions has been proposed.5 Since Protesesecu et al. synthesized all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I) luminescent nanocrystals (NCs),6 inorganic CsPbX3 NCs have piqued significant interest and have been widely developed in many high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),7,8 lasers,9 solar cells,10 and photodetectors.11 Cs ions replace organic cations, solving the problem of cation decomposition to a certain extent. However, stability remains a challenging hotspot. Thus, many researchers have proposed other methods, such as surface ligand modification12,13 and surface passivation.14 For example, CsPbCl3 (NC) surfaces were passivated using 3-mercaptopropionic acid, followed by solid-state ligand exchange with aromatic acid/amine.12 These methods have improved the stability of inorganic perovskites and also brought about different new properties.
As a powerful method, doping technology has been extensively applied to improve the stability of perovskites. In order to find out new low toxicity inorganic perovskites, researchers have made a lot of efforts. Elements similar to B-site lead ions which are less toxic and more environmentally friendly became promising substitutes for lead ions. Thus far, congener elements,15,16 rare earth elements,17 and transition elements18 have become ideal selections and have been doped into CsPbX3 to replace Pb at the B-site.19 The alkaline-earth metal Sr has been a competitive candidate because its ionic radius is almost identical to Pb2+. In addition, the Sr ion has a stable bivalent state and the SrX2 is non-toxic. Experimentally, the alkaline-earth metal Sr has been successfully doped into organic–inorganic perovskites. The CH3NH3SraPb1−aI3−xClx structure (a ≤ 0.05) synthesized by Xuxia Shai et al. can have a positive impact on material thermal stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE, ∼16.3%) for solar cell devices.20 And then the Sr element is considered for incorporation into pure inorganic perovskites. Arindam et al. successfully doped Sr into CsPbBr3, resulting in an approximately two-fold increase in the photocurrent density for CsPb0.95Sr0.05Br3 compared with pure CsPbBr3.21 The Sr doping can also greatly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the mixed materials.22 The red LEDs fabricated by Sr: CsPbI3 quantum dots exhibited high brightness (1250 cd m−2 at 9.2 V) and good operational stability (L50 > 2 h driven by 6 V).23 In addition to the experimental research results mentioned above, there are some theoretical studies on doped perovskites.24,25 The electronic and optical properties of the doped perovskites by different alkaline-earth elements have been studied by density functional theory (DFT). Rongjian Sa et al. investigated the structures and electronic properties of CsPb0.875B0.125I3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Cd, Hg, Ge, Sn, and Pb), and they found that the Sr doping would increase the lattice constant and decrease the formation energy.26 However, most theoretical studies only focused on the change of the bandgap of Sr-doped perovskites.27 Although some theoretical and experimental studies have been done on Sr-doped perovskite, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding on the influence of Sr doping on the band structures and photoelectric properties of the doped perovskite.
Herein, to explore the influence of Sr doping on inorganic perovskites, we theoretically investigated the band structures, the density of states (DOS), effective masses of electrons and holes, and the optical properties of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) based on DFT. At first, the stability properties were discussed by the tolerance factor and the formation energy. Then, the band structures, including lattice constants, bond lengths, and bandgap energies were discussed. Moreover, the optical properties of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) were computed, including absorption coefficient and reflectivity. Finally, changes in the effective masses of electrons and holes after Sr doping were investigated. The calculated results of this work provide theoretical guidance for further experimental studies on the electronic and optical properties of Sr-doped CsPbX3 perovskites.
2. Computational details
In this study, the plane wave pseudopotential method based on DFT was used.28 This calculation method is the all-electron-like projector augmented wave method and the exchange–correlation potential realized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).29 The generalized gradient approximation and (PBE) functions were used to calculate the crystal structure. The optimized crystal structure, energy band, state density, optical properties, and effective mass were obtained. The cut-off energy of the plane wave was set to 500 eV. All atoms were allowed to relax until the Hellmann–Feynman forces reached the convergence criterion of less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The convergence threshold of energy was set at 10−5 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme was used to sample k-points in the Brillouin zone. For the optimized structure, the meshes of 3 × 3 × 3 k-points were centered at the Γ-point in the Brillouin zone. For the calculation of electronic properties, the meshes of 6 × 6 × 6 k-points were adopted. Then, high energy band symmetric points were taken as X (0 0.5 0), R (0.5 0.5 0.5), M (0.5 0.5 0), Γ (0 0 0), and X (0 0.5 0) for CsPbX3 and X (0 0.5 0), R (0.5 0.5 0.5), M (0.5 0.5 0), Γ (0 0 0), R (0.5 0.5 0.5), and X (0 0.5 0) for CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3. A denser k-point grid of 10 × 10 × 10 was used for optical properties. All calculations were performed using PBE functionals. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect was also considered in the calculation of energy bands because Pb is a heavy metal element30,31 The bandgap energies of lead-based perovskites were underestimated by taking SOC into account. In addition, the crystal structures have been explained by the VESTA.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stability properties
According to the experimental studies, it is found that the Sr doping concentration is stable at the concentration of 10%.20,23 As a result, we constructed a doping system with a doping concentration of 12.5%, as shown in Fig. 1. The structural stability of halide perovskites can be predicted by the tolerance factor ,32 where RA, RB, and RX denote the ionic radii of Cs, Pb or Sr, and halogen X, respectively. When the tolerance coefficient is between 0.8 and 1.1, a perovskite structure can be formed. The ionic radii of Cs, Pb, Cl, Br, and I are 1.67, 1.19, 1.81, 1.96, and 2.20 Å, respectively. The ionic radius of the doping element Sr is 1.18 Å, which is comparable to the ionic radius of Pb. The tolerance factor of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 slightly increased compared with that of undoped CsPbX3, namely, 0.809, 0.818, and 0.823 for CsPb0.875Sr0.125I3, CsPb0.875Sr0.125Br3, and CsPb0.875Sr0.125Cl3, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The small change in the tolerance factor is because of the similar radii of Pb and Sr ions, indicating that perovskite structures can still be maintained after doping.

To judge the thermodynamic stability, we calculated the formation enthalpy (H) shown in Table S1 of the ESI.† With respect to the following chemical decomposition reaction: CsPbX3 = CsX + PbX2, the formation energy (ΔH) can be calculated as follows: ΔHf = E(CsPbX3) − [E(CsX) + E(PbX2)](1)
For the mixed structures, the formation energy was calculated by the following formula: ΔHf = E(CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3) − [E(CsX) + 0.875E(PbX2) + 0.125E(SrX2)](2)where E(CsX), E(PbX2), and E(SrX2) are the formation enthalpy of reactants. E(CsPbX3) is the formation enthalpy of the CsPbX3 undoped system. E(CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3) is the formation enthalpy of the CsPbX3 doped system.
The entropy contribution is only a few percent of the total formation energy since no gas-to-solid transitions are present. Thus, the entropy contribution to the total formation energy is neglected here. The negative ΔH listed in the Table 1 directly indicated that the decomposition reactions are endothermic, so a low concentration Sr doped perovskite structure can be synthesized. The doping of Sr led to a decrease in the absolute value of the formation energy, indicating that the ability becomes weak after doping. Experimental research also showed that the higher the doping concentration, the worse the device performance. The performance of photovoltaic devices based on MASraPb1−aI3−xClx deteriorated with the increase of Sr2+ concentration. As the Sr proportion increases, photocurrent, photo-voltage as well as PCE dramatically decreased.20
3.2. Crystal structure properties
The primitive cell of CsPbX3 is shown in Fig. 1(a). The optimized 2 × 2 × 2 supercells of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 are demonstrated in Fig. 1(b). The lattice constants before and after doping are shown in Table 1. The lattice constants of CsPbX3 were 6.375, 5.987, and 5.717 Å, which agree well with other studies, for example, 6.29, 5.874, and 5.61 Å.33,34 Comparing the lattice constants before and after 12.5% Sr doping, we found that the lattice constants increased by 0.027, 0.008, and 0.002 of the doped CsPb0.875Sr0.125I3, CsPb0.875Sr0.125Br3, and CsPb0.875Sr0.125Cl3 perovskites, respectively.
In addition, the Sr atom had a small influence on the bond length of B–X in CsPbX3. As shown in Table 1, the Pb–I bond length of CsPb0.875Sr0.125I3 decreased from 3.187 to 3.180 Å. The length of Sr–I (3.221 Å) is larger than that of Pb–I (3.180 Å) for CsPb0.875Sr0.125I3. In contrast, CsPb0.875Sr0.125Cl3 exhibits the opposite change trend. The Pb–Cl bond length increased from 2.858 to 2.860 after doping, and Sr–Cl (2.859 Å) is shorter than Pb–Cl (2.860 Å). The bond length changes before and after doping because strontium has a lower electronegativity than lead (0.95 versus 2.33).
To better understand the bonding interactions of the Sr–X and Pb–X bonds, we calculated the electron local function, as shown in Fig. 2. The electron localization function diagram shows the distribution of electrons in space and can distinguish the types of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. The electron localization function (ELF) is as follows:38 (3)where D(r) denotes the Pauli repulsed excess kinetic energy density, and D0(r) denotes the Thomas–Fermi kinetic energy density. ELF(r) = 1 means perfect localization (red). ELF(r) = 0.5 indicates homogeneous electron gaslike pair probability (green). ELF(r) close to 0 indicates that no electron density exists (blue). In Fig. 2, the value of ELF between Pb and X ranges from 0.5 to 0.6, showing that the Pb–I bond is covalent. The electron distribution around Sr was nearly spherical. The value of ELF between Sr and X ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 because of the loss of electrons, indicating that the Sr–I bond was ionic. Yanan Liang et al.'s calculation also reflected this phenomenon.39 This indicates that the ionicity of Sr–X bond in the perovskite is slightly strong compared to the corresponding Pb–I bond.

3.3. Electronic properties
According to the semiconductor theory, bandgap energy is a significant parameter for photoelectric and photovoltaic applications. In this study, bandgaps with and without SOC of all optimized structures are calculated and listed in Table 1. The bandgap energy of perovskites increased gradually with the atoms from I to Cl, that is, 1.462 eV (CsPbI3), 1.758 eV (CsPbBr3), and 2.179 eV (CsPbCl3). After doping Sr into CsPbX3, the bandgap increased by 0.2–0.3 eV compared with that before doping. The bandgap still showed an increasing trend from I to Cl after doping, namely, 1.695 eV (CsPb0.875Sr0.125I3), 2.020 eV (CsPb0.875Sr0.125Br3), and 2.456 eV (CsPb0.875Sr0.125Cl3). The bandgap of CsPbBr3 calculated by Yuce Hurriyet increased from 1.89 eV to 1.98 eV after 2% Sr-doping.40 The doping of Sr resulted in an increase of the bandgap value, which is not advantageous when it comes to solar cell applications. However, it also provides us with an method to increase the bandgap by controlling the Sr doping concentration, so as to be applied as luminescent materials in a large visible range.
According to the semiconductor theory, the band structures near the Fermi level are important to understand the physical properties of materials. Thus, we calculated the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) in the Brillouin zone. As is well known, the bandgap value with SOC is much smaller than the experimental value. According to Table 1, the variation trend of bandgap with SOC is consistent with that without SOC. Therefore, we only present the band structures without SOC in Fig. 3. Notably, after Sr is doped into the structure, the band structures maintained their direct band gaps, whereas the high symmetry points of the energy band changed from point R to Γ. As depicted in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† when SOC was considered, the variation trend of the band is similar to that without SOC. The change in the energy band means Sr doping affects the overlap of orbitals of different elements as well as the distribution of valence states in the Brillouin zone, thereby changing the high symmetry point.

To explore the electron orbital influence in the energy band, we calculated the total DOS and partial DOS (PDOS) of CsPbX3 perovskites before and after Sr doping. According to the DOS after doping, as shown in Fig. 4, the VB maximum (VBM) of the energy band is mainly contributed by the X-p (I-3p, Br-4p, Cl-5p) orbital and the Pb-6s orbital, whereas the CB minimum (CBM) is mainly contributed by the Pb-6p orbital. The Cs-6s orbital made little contribution to both VBM and CBM. The contribution of each element to the DOS before and after doping was almost the same, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 of ESI.† According to the calculation of PDOS, the contribution of low-concentration Sr contributes to the states in the top of the VB, so it results in a more extensive hybridization. Thus, the band gap energy increased.

3.4. Optical properties
Optical properties are essential parameters for fabricating photoelectronic and photovoltaic devices with excellent performances. Therefore, in this study, we also investigated the optical properties, including imaginary and real parts of complex dielectric functions, optical absorption coefficient, and the reflectivity of CsPbX3 and CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 perovskites. The frequency dependent absorption coefficient α(ω) and reflectivity R(ω) can be deduced from the complex dielectric function, and the formulas are as follows:41 (4) (5)where ω represents the photon frequency, and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) denote the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function, respectively.
The complex dielectric function describes the complete response of a material to disturbances caused by electromagnetic radiation. The imaginary part of this function (Fig. 5a), ε2(ω) is directly related to the band structure of the material and describes its absorptive behavior. The optical absorption coefficient is a crucial parameter which is related to the capability for absorbing light energy. Fig. 5(b) shows the absorption spectra in the range of 200–1000 nm. Based on Fig. 5(b), the light absorption edge of CsPbX3 after Sr doping shifts toward the short wavelength. The blueshift in optical spectrum exhibits a notable consistency with the increase of the bandgap energy. It is worthwhile that the absorption coefficients of perovskites before and after Sr doping are on the order of 105 in a wide range from visible to ultraviolet energy. The magnitude of the light absorption coefficient is equivalent to the previous calculation.26 A large absorption coefficient means strong luminous efficiency, which makes the doped perovskites to be likely used in light emitting devices, such as blue or purple LEDs and lasers.
 Fig. 5  Calculated real part of dielectric function (a), and absorption coefficient (b) of CsPbX3 and CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3. 
We also calculated the real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω). For ε1(ω), an important quantity is the zero-frequency limit, which is the electronic part of the static dielectric constant εeff, as shown in Table 2. Based on Fig. 6(a), εeff decreased with the halogen change from I to Cl, namely 5.93, 4.68, and 3.88 for CsPbX3 and 5.25, 4.21, and 3.59 for CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the frequency dependent reflectivity R(ω) slightly decreased in the visible light range after Sr doping. It is noted that R(0) also decreases with the change of cation from I to Cl. Similar relation was reported for other publications.42 Thus, we can consider the application of Pb/Sr mixed CsPbX3 perovskites in the whole visible light region.

3.5. Carrier transport properties
The effective mass m* of electrons (holes) are crucial for transporting electrons (holes). To clarify the transport properties, the effective mass of electrons (holes) in the CB (VB) before and after Sr doping was also investigated. The effective mass of electrons (holes) around the bottom of the CB (top of the VB) can be calculated using the following formula:43 (6)where ħ represents the reduced Planck constant, k represents the wave vector along with different directions, and E(k) denotes the energy dispersion relation function. Generally, the greater the dispersion at the bottom of the CB (the top of the VB), the smaller the effective mass of the electron (hole), and the more the conducivity to the diffusion of the electron (hole).
We have calculated the effective electron (hole) mass of CsPbX3 and CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 perovskites at the bottom of the CB (the top of the VB). To study the change in the effective mass, we chose the same direction for comparison. The paths were from high symmetric points to both sides, namely, R → X and R → M for CsPbX3, and Γ → M and Γ → R for CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3. Hence, we listed the paths, which are the effective masses of electrons (holes) in the R → X direction of CsPbX3 and Γ → M direction of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3, as listed in Table 2. The effective masses of electrons and holes changed in a small range (0.01–0.03 m0) when Sr was doped into CsPbX3. Moreover, the effective mass of electrons along the Γ → R direction significantly decreased after Sr doping, thereby improving the electron transport capacity along this path.
The exciton binding energy Eb can be explored via the electron and hole effective masses. The calculation formula for the exciton binding energy in the weak Mott–Wannier model is as follows: (7) (8)where εeff denotes the static dielectric function, and  and  denote the effective masses of electrons and holes, obtained by fitting the VBM and CBM, respectively. Our calculated εeff values of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, or Cl) were 5.93, 4.68, and 3.88 using the PBE method, which is consistent with a previous report.39 Meanwhile, the values of the doped CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = I, Br, or Cl) perovskites are 5.25, 4.21, and 3.59, respectively. Comparing the exciton binding energies of CsPbX3 and CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = I, Br, or Cl), the binding energy of the exciton after Sr doping increased by 35, 62, and 60 meV. The increase in binding energy was beneficial for increasing the recombination probability of the exciton. These changes improved exciton stability, which enhanced luminescence properties. Sr doping is good for luminescence applications, specifically photovoltaic applications.
4. Conclusions
In this study, the band structures, photoelectronic properties, and effective mass of CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) have been investigated by first principles. The results showed that CsPb0.875Sr0.125X3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) could maintain the perovskite structure and had improved stability based on the tolerance factor and the formation energy. In terms of electronic properties, Sr doping affected the distribution of orbital hybridization in the initial structure of the perovskites, increasing the bandgap and changing the high symmetry point. The blueshift phenomenon in optical properties also reflected the increase in the bandgap. Moreover, Sr doping increased electron transport along the Γ → R direction. Therefore, Sr doping reduced the concentration of Pb in the inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 and caused it to exhibit new properties, which are advantageous in the design of photoelectric devices.
