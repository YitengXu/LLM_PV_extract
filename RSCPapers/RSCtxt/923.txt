    , Accepted 28th November 2014First published on 1st December 2014AbstractThe utilization of electron–hole pairs (EHPs) generated from multiple excitons in quantum dots (QDs) is of great interest toward efficient photovoltaic devices and other optoelectronic devices; however, extraction of charge carriers remains difficult. Herein, we extract photocharges from Ag2S QDs and investigate the dependence of the electric field on the extraction of charges from multiple exciton generation (MEG). Low toxic Ag2S QDs are directly grown on TiO2 mesoporous substrates by employing the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The contact between QDs is important for the initial charge separation after MEG and for the carrier transport, and the space between neighbor QDs decreases with more SILAR cycles, resulting in better charge extraction. At the optimal electric field for extraction of photocharges, the results suggest that the threshold energy (hνth) for MEG is 2.41Eg. The results reveal that Ag2S QD is a promising material for efficient extraction of charges from MEG and that QDs prepared by SILAR have an advantageous electrical contact facilitating charge separation and extraction.
Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been attracting increased attention as building blocks for the development of next-generation solar cells.1–4 The QDs possess the advantages of tunable band gap energy, high extinction coefficient, low cost, and easy preparation. More importantly, the QDs can generate multiple excitons at high energy photon excitation, and the QD-based solar cells may therefore overcome the Shockley–Queisser limitation for a single bandgap based solar cell where one photon only produces one electron–hole pair (EHP).1,5–7 The process of multiple exciton generation (MEG) converts a high energy photon into multiple EHPs. Typically, if the incident photon energy is greater than the band gap energy (Eg), the higher energy state absorbs the photon to produce a “hot exciton” with excess energy, ΔEex = hν − Eg.8 For semiconductor QDs, the excess energy prior to cooling is converted into kinetic energy.9 Moreover, if ΔEex > Eg (hν > 2Eg), it may produce one or more extra EHPs, which is a promising strategy to enhance the photon-to-current energy conversion efficiency by utilizing the excess energy.
A variety of QDs, such as PbSe,10–13 PbS,14–19 PbTe,20 CdSe,21 Si,22 InAs,23 InP,24 Ag2S,25 CuInSe2,26 and single-walled carbon nanotubes,27,28 have been evaluated for multiple exciton generation. Semonin et al. reported that the external quantum efficiency (the spectral resolved ratio of collected charge carriers to incident photons) of a PbSe QD solar cell reached up to ∼114% at 4Eg photon energy excitation,7 which stimulated a strong interest in MEG investigation. Cunningham et al. demonstrated that an increased multiple exciton efficiency in quasi-one-dimensional PbSe nanorod was observed by decreasing the threshold energy (hνth).13 Compared with the zero-dimensional PbSe QD, a 2-fold increase in efficiency and a reduction of the threshold energy by ∼2.23 eV were obtained for the PbSe nanorod. Recently, Sun et al. reported the carrier dynamics and MEG efficiency in Ag2S QDs using femtosecond broad-band transient absorption spectroscopy, and found that the quantum efficiency was ∼173% per single-absorbed photon at a pump photoexcitation of 3.2Eg.25 However, how efficiently the generated multiple exciton may be extracted and collected may be very important to obtain highly efficient photon-to-current energy conversion and, moreover, improving the charge extraction is essential to improve the performance of the QD-based photovoltaic devices. Kim et al. have proved that the extraction of excess carriers (electrons or holes) produced from QDs was possible under an electric field.29 A colloidal PbSe QD layer was covered on a TiO2 substrate film for the carrier extraction. However, the threshold energy of MEG was 2.8Eg, which is higher than that in solution (∼2.4Eg),9,11 and was presumed to result from a poor carrier mobility between QDs and a low electron injection efficiency from the QD into the TiO2 nanocrystal.30 MEG has been observed in photovoltaic devices under high energy photon excitation, which shows that utilization of MEG is possible for photovoltaic devices and other optoelectronic devices.7,31
Clearly, at least three obstacles limit the carrier extraction and collection of multiple excitons in the film device. Firstly, the colloidal QD layer exhibits poor conductivity, resulting in low carrier mobility between QDs.29 The surfactant surroundings and surface dangling bonds of QDs lead to low conductivity. To some extent, the conductivity can be enhanced using short chain ligands that increase the carrier mobility.32,33 Secondly, the electron recombination in the device is very fast, which affects the carrier collection efficiency.34,35 Thirdly, for devices based on electron injection from QDs to nanoparticles of another material the injection is not fast enough.30 For example, the measured electron injection time from PbS QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles is surprisingly slow, around 100 ns. Therefore, an increased separation and carrier extraction efficiency of multiple excitons is necessary for high efficient photon-to-electron energy conversion and is also a potential strategy to improve the photovoltaic device performance.
In this report, we measure the extraction of photogenerated carriers in Ag2S QDs. Ag2S QDs exhibit high photostability, low toxicity, low threshold energy for multiple excitons, and long lifetime of the multiple excitons.36,37 Moreover, Ag2S QDs are considered to be a convenient model system for MEG investigation for photovoltaic devices, because of its tunable band gap energy in the near infrared region.38,39 Here, Ag2S QDs were directly grown on TiO2 mesoporous substrates using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.36 Ag2S QDs with different Eg were obtained by repeating different numbers of SILAR cycles. After 12 SILAR cycles, Ag2S QDs with an Eg of ∼1.18 eV attached on the TiO2 substrate, forming a thin QD layer covering the TiO2 substrate (Ag2S/TiO2). The results below reveal that the contact between QDs is important for the carrier extraction and collection, and the space between QDs decreases with repeating more SILAR cycles. Under an electric field, the EHP was separated, forming free charge carriers flowing between QDs toward the contact electrodes. The results suggest that the threshold energy for MEG is 2.41Eg. The kinetics of carrier separation and transportation is discussed below and the properties are compared with typically used PbSe QDs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the device architecture for the investigation of MEG and charge carrier extraction. The detailed experimental information is given in ESI.† Briefly, the central area of the FTO layer on the glass substrate was etched with Zn powder and an HCl solution to prevent the contribution of charge transport through the FTO layer in the conductivity measurements. The TiO2 paste was covered on the etched FTO substrate by the doctor blading technique, and subsequently sintered at 500 °C in air to remove the organic additive in the TiO2 paste, obtaining TiO2 mesoporous layers. Ag2S QDs were directly deposited on the TiO2 substrate using the SILAR method according to a previously reported procedure.36 The TiO2 substrate was dipped into the AgNO3 ethanol solution and the Na2S methanol solution separately and thereafter washed with ethanol at room temperature. The two-step procedures formed one SILAR cycle. So as to increase the carrier mobility between QDs, more SILAR cycles were repeated, increasing the QDs loading and minimizing the space between QDs. Here, 6–12 SILAR cycles were repeated. It is notable that the Eg of the Ag2S QDs was affected by the QD size and the larger QD had a narrow Eg as expected.40
 Fig. 1  Device architecture for charge carrier extraction. 

Fig. 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of TiO2 films before and after Ag2S QD loading. The size of the TiO2 nanoparticles is ∼20 nm and the film is very porous (Fig. 2a), which provides room for Ag2S QD loading. The thickness of TiO2 films is ∼6 μm. Ag2S QDs were directly grown on TiO2 using the SILAR method, and the QD size and Eg could thereby be tuned by controlling the number of SILAR cycles.40 With increasing the number of SILAR cycles, QDs with bigger size were formed and connected, presenting a continuous QD layer (Fig. 2c). From the high magnification SEM image (Fig. 2d), QDs with a size of 8–10 nm were observed to cover all of the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The QD layer therefore forms a 3D network on the TiO2 nanoparticle substrate, providing a possibility for a high carrier mobility of the carriers traveling between QDs. Fig. 2e shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Ag2S/TiO2. The presence of QDs on the TiO2 substrate can be clearly seen, as the arrow indicates. The QDs connected together form a QD layer with a thickness of ∼10 nm covering the TiO2 nanoparticle substrate. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 2f), there are two types of lattice fringes, namely the [110] plane (d110 = 0.32 nm) for the anatase crystal structure of TiO2 and the [121] plane (d121 = 0.26 nm) for the acanthite crystal structure of Ag2S QDs. The crystal structures were also studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S1†), which also revealed that the TiO2 and Ag2S QDs were of anatase and acanthite structure, respectively. The SEM and TEM data provided complementary evidence that crystalline Ag2S QDs are grown on the TiO2 substrate. Although some QDs may be aggregated that could affect the quantum confinement, each QD was an isolated crystal and less than 1 nm interface space between QDs was observed, which is important for carrier transportation.41 The composition of Ag2S/TiO2 was analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. S2†), which confirmed the Ti, O, Ag, and S elements.

Inserted in (f) is the selected-area electron diffraction pattern. 12 SILAR cycles were used for QD formation in (c–f). 

Fig. 3 shows the light absorption spectrum of the Ag2S/TiO2 film after different numbers of SILAR cycles. As expected, the overall increase in absorbance with increased number of SILAR cycles suggests more QDs loaded on the TiO2. The red-shift of the absorption peak suggests that larger size QDs were formed with more SILAR cycles. The table inserted in Fig. 3 shows the Eg of the QDs calculated according to the references.35,40 When the Ag2S QD has a size of ∼9 nm, the Eg is 1.23 eV.25 After 12 SILAR cycles, the Eg was around 1.18 eV. The calculated Eg is higher than the bulk Ag2S (1.1 eV), which shows that there is still quantum confinement effects for QD size, but it may also be related to a higher degree disorder of Ag2S QDs in Ag2S/TiO2 films as well as a result of non-uniform light absorption of different wavelengths within the thickness of the Ag2S/TiO2 film.42

The conductivity of the Ag2S/TiO2 nanostructure films with different SILAR cycles for Ag2S QD formation was investigated both in the dark and under white light illumination. The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), and the voltage was scanned in the range of 0–4.5 V. Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage (J–V) measurements of the Ag2S/TiO2 films. Under illumination, there were more mobile carriers (photocharges) generated from the Ag2S QDs, increasing the conductivity. The net charge current (ΔJ, blue curves), termed the photoexcited current, was determined by subtracting the dark current from the photon enhanced current under illumination, ΔJ = Jlight − Jdark.29 As shown in Fig. 4, there was an increase of conductivity with more SILAR cycles both in the dark (black curves) and under illumination (red curves). As discussed above, for larger QDs the QDs were more closely connected together, forming a QD layer on TiO2 and therefore possessing lower resistance for the carriers.
 Fig. 4  
J–V curves of the Ag2S/TiO2 films both in the dark (black curve) and under illumination (red curve). The SILAR cycles for QD formation in (a–d) were 12, 10, 8, and 6, respectively. The distance between electrodes was ∼8 mm. Blue curves were the net charge current (ΔJ) “photoexcited current” due to QDs in the presence of illumination: ΔJ = Jlight − Jdark. 
Moreover, under an electric field, the photogenerated EHPs were separated and extracted at the contacts. Interestingly, the ΔJ was as a function of applied voltage bias and exhibited different domains in the J–V characteristics (Fig. 4a). If the electric field was low, in domain I in Fig. 4a, there was an increase in ΔJ with increased voltage. In domain II, ΔJ stabilized with increasing voltage, which indicates that the maximum amount of photogenerated charges was extracted. In domain III, ΔJ decreased with increasing voltage suggesting that a limitation in charge extraction occurs in the device possibly due to mobility limitation, and the dark current becomes rather similar to the photoexcited current.29,43 Therefore, for the device with 12 SILAR cycles for QD formation, the electric field produced at a voltage of 2–3 V was optimal for extraction of the photogenerated charges. However, for the device with 10 SILAR cycles the conductivity was lower and a higher voltage, ∼3.6 V, was needed for optimal extraction of the photogenerated charges (Fig. 4b).
In order to efficiently extract the photogenerated carriers, the generated EHP should be separated before Auger recombination or injection occurs.31 In our case, the electron transportation competed with Auger recombination and injection into TiO2 (Fig. 5a). The photoexcited electron kinetics is expressed using the following equation: n*KTotal = n*KTr + n*KIn + n*KRe(1)where n* is the total amount of photoexcited electrons, KTotal is the total photoexcited electron kinetics, and KTr, KIn and KRe are transportation, injection, and recombination kinetics, respectively. Actually, the lifetime of photoexcited electron is much longer than the time for Auger recombination, and the Auger recombination rate is much slower than the electron transportation rate. For instance, the CdTe and PbS QDs both show an electron transfer rate of ∼100 ps between QDs, and the photoexcited electron can efficiently transport between QDs prior to Auger recombination.44,45 Furthermore, the lifetime of the photoexcited electron in the Ag2S QD is about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude longer than those of comparable size PbS QDs or single-walled carbon nanotubes, respectively,25 which suggests that KTR ≫ KRe in the Ag2S QD layer.45,46
 Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of (a) photoexcited electron kinetics and (b–c) the carrier transportation between QDs. The photoexcited electron from the Ag2S QD can inject into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanocrystal, recombine with the hole in the valence band of the QD, and transport into the conduction band of another QD. With more SILAR cycles for QD formation, the space between QDs decreases, which facilitates the carrier transportation between QDs. 
Hyun et al. found that the electron injection time from PbS QDs to TiO2 nanocrystals was surprisingly slow (∼100 ns), and the injection time was affected by the QD size.47 When the PbS QD size was more than 4.8 nm, the electron injection was not expected because the Eg of QD was too narrow with size increasing.18,48 Clark et al. also found that the electron lifetime of PbS and PbSe QDs were 2 orders of magnitude longer than the CdS and CdSe QDs; however, they had a similar electron injection rate.49 The slow injection rate presents a serious impediment to the utilization of MEG, simply because the slow injection rate affects the carrier collection of the device. Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIA) measurements were carried out to investigate the electron injection from the Ag2S QD to the TiO2 substrate (Fig. S3†), which revealed that the electron injection efficiency was very low. Moreover, no photocurrent at short-circuit was observed when we connected the Au contact and the TiO2/FTO side of the sample (Fig. S4, S5†). These results indicate that the electron injection from the Ag2S QD into the TiO2 can be neglected in this device (KTR ≫ KIn). In other words, the carrier extraction and collection is only restricted by the carrier transportation between the Ag2S QDs.
For colloid QDs, organic ligands, typically oleic acid, are used to control kinetics and allow for stable colloidal dispersions for QD synthesis. However, they are essentially electrically isolated and thus prevent exciton dissociation and charge conduction. Passivation with short molecules with high affinity to bond with QDs can remove the ligands and reduce the distance between QDs.50 For example, the CdSe QD treated with ammonium thiocyanate displayed a record carrier mobility of 27 cm2 v−1 s−1.51 The recent report by Stolle et al. also confirmed that the capping ligands inhibit the collection of multiple excitons, and the photocurrent was largely increased after removing the ligands.31 Removing organic ligands therefore brings better electrical contact between QDs, which is in good agreement with our observation of better contact between the QDs for an increased number of SILAR cycles (Fig. 5b, c). From the dark current (black curves in Fig. 4), the better conductivity was observed after more SILAR cycles, which was favorable for the carrier conduction. In contrast, the carrier transportation efficiency was poor if the distance between QDs was too long,31 which agree with our results for a few SILAR cycles (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the carrier extraction was also influenced by the electric field. The space charge limited current (SCLC) model may be used to illustrate the relationship between the current and the applied voltage. In this case, if we assume that very few active traps are present in the semiconductor under high voltage bias, the current follows the well known Mott–Gurney equations:52,53 (2)where J is the current density, μ is the charge-carrier mobility, ε0 is the free space permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, V is the applied voltage, and L is the separation between the contacts. The charge mobility, however, shows electric field dependence, which is understood in terms of hopping transport. Field dependence is generally expressed as54 μ(E) = μ0exp[0.89γ(V/L)1/2](3)where μ0 is the zero-field mobility and γ describes the field activation of mobility. Thus, combining the above equations, the space charge limited current in this case of mobility depending on the field can be expressed:55 (4)
From the equation, the current depends on the applied voltage to the power of 2, but also shows an exponential behavior due to the mobility dependence of the voltage. However, the above model is on the assumption of very few active traps in the film. In the QDs there are probably a rather high number of trap states, which will affect this relationship and, moreover, the conductivity may also be affected by the surface engineering.31 Also, under illumination, the photogenerated carriers in the device will increase the carrier density. Moreover, the electric field will enhance the separation of EHP to free carriers, which further enhance the current up to the voltage when all EHPs are separated. These devices may therefore show rather similar characteristics as organic photovoltaic devices, in which carriers also may be efficiently separated and collected under a strong enough electric field.56
Recently, more studies suggested that much of the apparent field dependence of the mobility may be explained on a more physically relevant basis in terms of carrier density dependence.57 In the case of a planar device, carrier transportation is effectively one-dimensional because of the uniformity of the electric field and carrier density parallel to the electrode. In contrast, if the electrodes are located on the same side of the film device, such as in our case, carrier transportation between electrodes is three dimensional, with current and carrier density spreading significantly away from the electrode. So as to compare the resistance and conductivity under dark and illumination conditions, the resistance (both differential resistance and static resistance) and conductivity were studied (Fig. S6, S7†), which show how the photoexcited carrier contributed to the conductivity. Both differential resistance (Fig. S6†) and static resistance (Fig. S7†) decreased after more SILAR cycles as expected from the discussion above.
The carrier extraction from the device under illumination scanning the energy of the light is shown in Fig. 6. A fixed voltage bias was applied to the electrodes of the device to provide the internal electric field driving the carrier extraction. To compare the extraction as a function of electric field, different voltage biases (1 V, 2 V, and 4 V for domains I, II, and III in Fig. 4a) were applied to the device. Incident photons with energies of 1.5–3.5 eV were used to excite the device and Fig. 6 shows the normalized carrier extraction as a function of photon energy under different voltage biases. From the results, the electric field at 2 V bias is optimal for the carrier extraction, which is in agreement with the maximum photoexcited current in the J–V curve in Fig. 4a. As discussed, the electric field at low voltage bias was not ample enough to extract all multiple excitons, which resulted in low carrier extraction and collection efficiency. Increased voltage bias could enhance the carrier transportation dynamic, KTr, which may enable separation of more multiple excitons. Therefore the electric field at 2–3 V bias was optimal for efficient carrier extraction for this device. When the device was at 2 V bias, the results suggest that the hνth for MEG was 2.41Eg for QD with an Eg of 1.18 eV and that the highest measured multiple exciton extraction was ∼160% at 3.15Eg. Interestingly, the hνth at different voltage bias had a similar value, which suggests that the applied voltage did not affect the threshold energy and only influences the carrier separation and extraction. For the QDs prepared with 10 SILAR cycles, the results suggest that the hνth was 2.48Eg (Fig. S8†) and that a stronger electric field was needed (∼3.6 V) to separate and extract the multiple exciton due to poor conductivity between the QDs.
 Fig. 6  Photon energy dependent carrier extraction measurements. Different voltage biases were applied to the device. 
Notably, the results from electrical extraction were slightly different from the optical measurement in solution (photon to exciton), which was also observed by Kim et al. when they studied the carrier extraction of PbSe QDs.29 For electrical extraction in the device, the measured current comes from carrier separation and extraction, which should be lower than the total amount of multiple excitons due to the difficulties to separate and extract all carriers from multiple excitons. The charge conduction limitation decreases carrier transportation and collection efficiency, preventing efficient carrier extraction. Furthermore, it is difficult to evaluate how many QDs contribute to the current. Therefore, improving the amount of active QDs and conductivity is important to increase the carrier extraction for MEG.
So as to better understand multiple exciton generation and extraction, Fig. 7 shows a schematic depiction. In a semiconductor QD, the excess energy, ΔEex, prior to cooling is converted into kinetic energy, and may generate one or more extra EHPs. In bulk semiconductors, however, two factors limit the multiple exciton generation. Firstly, hot carriers undergo impact ionization. Secondly, the density of final states is limited by crystal momentum, which must be conserved between the initial and the final state, and rapid cooling of hot carriers through photon emission to the band edge competes efficiently with impact ionization. Therefore, multiple EHPs produced by impact ionization only generate at higher photon energy hν > (4–5)Eg.9 In contrast, QDs can overcome these limitations that energy conservation sets fundamental limits on MEG due to the fact that crystal momentum is a result of long-range repeating atomic potentials, which is not repeated in QDs. MEG is better able to compete due to the fact that the hot-carrier relaxation can be adjusted. Furthermore, for quantum-confined semiconductors the size, shape, composition and surface engineering allow to tailor the MEG properties.18
 Fig. 7  Schematic depiction of multiple exciton generation and extraction. 
Recently, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were typically used to investigate MEG of QDs in solution. However, there has been debate over TA measurements because of the large spread in reported quantum yields (QYs).58 The discrepancies and variations reported could be attributed to photocharging during the pulsed laser experiments. In the ideal case, two EHPs are produced after accepting a photon with exactly 2Eg. In real systems more than 2Eg is needed to produce two EHPs; that is because the MEG rate is competing with the cooling rate of the hot exciton. Here, we apply published theories5,8,9,11 to discuss the MEG of the Ag2S QD and compare the MEG properties with the typically used PbSe QD. Briefly, the QY number can be expressed using the following equation: (5)where KMEGn is the rate of producing (n + 1) excitons from n hot excitons and Kcool is the cooling rate. Each successive term in eqn (5) is only valid when the energy conservation is met. If the photon energy (hν) is greater than 2Eg, two terms can contribute to MEG, and if hν > 3Eg, more than three terms can contribute. The photon energy where QY > 1 is the threshold energy, hνth. KMEG and Kcool are related to each other by (6)where hνex = hν − hνth, and P describes the competition between KMEG and Kcool. The threshold energy for MEG is related to P by (7)where  is the MEG rate as hν = 2hνth. As  increases or Kcool decreases, hνth approaches the energy conservation limit of 2Eg. Thus, the number of EHPs produced will be improved if KMEG/Kcool is increased. In the ideal case, if two EHPs are produced at exactly 2Eg, the P value needs to be very large. In reality the P value is rather low, which results in the threshold energy being higher than 2Eg. For semiconductor QDs based on PbSe, InP, and Si QDs the P values are all in the range of 1–10. The P value of PbSe QDs is 1.5, but for the PbSe nanorod it is 7.3, which indicates that the competition between KMEG and Kcool can be adjusted by controlling the QD morphology.13
For our device, the results suggest a threshold energy of 2.41Eg, which is somewhat higher than what Sun et al. reported for Ag2S QDs in solution, 2.28Eg,25 which may be attributed to differences between the QD systems. For example, the results may be different for a solid film of QDs and QDs in solution. Differences between QDs in solution and in films of, for example, PbSe have been reported previously.9 Our QDs have not any surface passivation, which also may affect the results. Moreover, in the film with QDs, the carriers have to transport between QDs to the contacts, as discussed above, which may affect the results.
The MEG efficiency, ηEHPM, is a measure of how well MEG competes with other relaxation channels and provides a proper and meaningful comparison with respect to the photophysics of MEG.5 The ηEHPM is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to produce an EHP, divided by the actual amount of energy required to produce an additional EHP after the MEG threshold is passed; the latter quantity is referred to the EHP creation energy εEHPM,59,60ηEHPM = Eg/εEHPM. The εEHPM can be determined from a QY vs. hνth/Eg plot and is equal to the inverse of the slope of QY vs. hνth/Eg, εEHPM = (ΔQY/hν)−1. Thus the ηEHPM can be calculated from the above equations, ηEHPM = ΔQY/Δ(hν/Eg). However, ηEHPM has no relationship with threshold energy and P value. η′EHPM is defined using the following equation:5 (8)
As defined above, P captures the competition between KMEG and Kcool, while the ηEHPM was defined in terms of εEHPM.
In Table 1 we compare the results of the MEG properties suggested by our experiments of Ag2S QDs with typically applied PbSe QDs. It was found that the QDs under different conditions for MEG have different hνth. As shown in Table 1, experiments suggest that both Ag2S and PbSe QDs have similar ηEHPM and hνth both in solution and in films, but Ag2S QDs have somewhat higher Eg, which limits the photon harvesting in the near infrared range (wavelength more than 1100 nm).

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported on the extraction of photogenerated carriers in Ag2S QDs. The dependence of the electric field on the extraction of charges was investigated and specifically the extraction of charges from multiple exciton generation (MEG). The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was used to grow the Ag2S QDs directly on TiO2 mesoporous substrates. At the optimal electric field for extraction of photocharges, the results suggest that the threshold energy (hνth) for MEG is 2.41Eg for the sample with 12 SILAR cycles. The results show that the Ag2S QD is a promising material for efficient extraction of charges from MEG and that QDs prepared by SILAR have an advantageous electrical contact facilitating charge separation and extraction. The results therefore suggest that the low-toxic Ag2S QDs had similar MEG properties as PbSe QDs, and the Ag2S QD prepared with SILAR is therefore a promising material for optoelectronic devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Device architecture for charge carrier extraction.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Top-view and (b) cross-sectional SEM images of TiO2 substrate films; (c) top-view and (d) high magnification SEM images of Ag2S QD covered TiO2 substrate films; (e) TEM and (f) HRTEM images of Ag2S QD covered TiO2 nanoparticles. Inserted in (f) is the selected-area electron diffraction pattern. 12 SILAR cycles were used for QD formation in (c–f).	 

 	Fig. 3  Light absorption spectrum of Ag2S/TiO2 films. The table shows the band gap of the QDs after different numbers of SILAR cycles.	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V curves of the Ag2S/TiO2 films both in the dark (black curve) and under illumination (red curve). The SILAR cycles for QD formation in (a–d) were 12, 10, 8, and 6, respectively. The distance between electrodes was ∼8 mm. Blue curves were the net charge current (ΔJ) “photoexcited current” due to QDs in the presence of illumination: ΔJ = Jlight − Jdark.	 
n*KTotal = n*KTr + n*KIn + n*KRe	(1)

 	Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of (a) photoexcited electron kinetics and (b–c) the carrier transportation between QDs. The photoexcited electron from the Ag2S QD can inject into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanocrystal, recombine with the hole in the valence band of the QD, and transport into the conduction band of another QD. With more SILAR cycles for QD formation, the space between QDs decreases, which facilitates the carrier transportation between QDs.

 	Fig. 6  Photon energy dependent carrier extraction measurements. Different voltage biases were applied to the device.
