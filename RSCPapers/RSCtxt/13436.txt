    , Accepted 27th November 2012First published on 28th January 2013AbstractIn this study, ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were conformally covered on the surfaces of ZnO nanowires (ZnO NWs) with high diffusion coefficient (1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1) to make a composite photoanode. By using N719 to sensitize the composite photoanode, the conversion efficiency can reach 7.14%.
ZnO is a wide band gap semiconductor that possesses an energy band structure and physical properties similar to those of TiO2, but has a higher electronic mobility than is favorable for electron transport, in addition to reduced recombination losses when used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1 Many studies have reported on the use of ZnO for applications in DSSCs. Although conversion efficiencies for ZnO2–5 are lower than the 12.3% for TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs),6 ZnO is still a viable alternative to TiO2 because of its ease of crystallization and anisotropic growth. These properties allow ZnO to be produced in a wide variety of nanostructures, consequently constructing unique properties for ZnO nanostructure-based DSSCs.
For DSSCs, photoanodes must provide large specific surface areas, and they can result in many different behaviors in electron transport or light propagation because of the surface effect, quantum confinement effect, or photon localization.2 Electron transport in DSSCs is based on nanoparticulate films that occur by a series of hopping events between the trap states on neighboring particles.7 Electron transport in photoanodes of DSSCs has recently been improved by using single-crystal and vertical ZnO nanowires (ZnO NWs).2,8 However, the efficiencies of the ZnO NWs DSSCs with 18–24 μm nanowires were inferior to those of TiO2 NPs DSSCs. Recently, Gao et al. proposed a method to avoid fusion of roots for long ZnO NWs. The conversion efficiency can reach 7.0% when ZnO NWs with lengths of 40 μm are used.9
This study proposes that the conversion efficiencies of ZnO NWs with long lengths can be improved with high electron transport properties using an ammonia-assisted continuous flow injection (NH3-assisted CFI) process. In addition, when ZnO NWs–NPs composite photoanodes, which have high electron transport abilities and large dye absorption areas, are sensitized to N719, the conversion efficiency improved to 7.14%.
In this study, we synthesized ZnO NWs by a multi-batch process and a CFI process, and the ZnO NPs were synthesized using base-free methanolic chemical bath deposition (CBD).10 The detailed procedures are described in the ESI† section, and the CFI process is shown schematically in Fig. S1.† The ZnO NW and ZnO NWs–NP composite photoanodes were annealed in air at 200 °C before dye loading. For the ZnO based photoanodes, dye loading was performed by immersing the anodes in a 0.3 mM N719 ethanolic solution for 45 min at 75 °C. All synthesis conditions of the ZnO NW and ZnO NWs–NP composite photoanodes are shown in Table 1.

Recently, ZnO NWs have been synthesized using a low temperature hydrothermal batch process of approximately 60–90 °C.11–16 For ZnO NW photoanodes for DSSCs, long lengths are needed to increase dye absorption. To increase the length of the ZnO NWs, a multi-batch process is used. This study proposes a continuous flow injection (CFI) process to synthesize ZnO NWs. The length of ZnO NWs can be easily controlled by the synthesis duration. ZnO NW photoanodes prepared by the multi-batch process were used in the control experiment (A1) to be compared with the ZnO NWs prepared by the CFI process (A2). Fig. 1 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the ZnO NWs grown using the multi-batch process (controlled experiment) and CFI process, respectively. The enlarged SEM images are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† From SEM images, the diameter distribution, lengths, densities of ZnO nanowires prepared by multi-batch and CFI process can be obtained and are listed in Table S1.† To elucidate the differences between the ZnO NWs synthesized using these two processes, micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) and micro-Raman (μ-Raman) spectroscopies characterized the crystal qualities of the ZnO NWs, as shown in Fig. S4.† For the multi-batch process, the ZnO NWs exhibited strong and broad orange-red emissions and the PL intensity ratio of the UV emissions to visible emissions was low, indicating the presence of high-density point defects. In contrast to the multi-batch process, the ZnO NWs synthesized by the CFI process displayed visible emissions. However, the PL intensity ratio of the UV emissions to the visible emissions was higher than that of the sample prepared using the batch process. The higher intensity ratio of the UV emissions to the visible emissions indicated that the ZnO NWs synthesized using the CFI process had higher optical qualities for the photoanodes of DSSCs. We used A1 and A2 as the photoanodes to assemble the DSSCs. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 2. The performances are listed in Table 2. J–V analysis showed that the conversion efficiency of A2 was higher than that of A1 (2.13% vs. 1.51%) when both lengths were 10 μm. Generally, the transport properties of ZnO nanowires could be analyzed by light intensity modulation method and electrochemical impedance technique (the detailed description is in the ESI†). In this study, the transport properties of A1 and A2 were analyzed by EIS impedance spectra (Fig. S5†), and their transport properties are listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of A2 was higher than that of A1 (4.40 × 10−3 cm2 s−1vs. 1.56 × 10−3 cm2 s−1). The mentioned analyses show that the ZnO NWs synthesized by the CFI process had high transport properties and achieved high conversion efficiencies.

Previous studies17 have shown that collection efficiency (ηCC) can be influenced by electron transit time (τd) and recombination lifetime (τn) [i.e., ηCC = 1 − (τd/τn)]. However, τd is related to the length (L) and diffusion coefficient (Dn) of ZnO NWs (τd = L2/Dn). When the length of a photoanode is increased without the simultaneous enhancement of the diffusion coefficient, τd is increased and ηCC is reduced. Increasing the length of ZnO NWs can effectively increase the dye loading amount; however, the collection efficiency of DSSCs is influenced by the length of the ZnO NWs if the diffusion coefficient cannot be simultaneously increased. To increase the conversion efficiency of the ZnO NWs DSSCs by increasing the lengths of the ZnO NW photoanodes, the diffusion coefficient must be simultaneously improved. In our previous study,18 we found that the electric properties of ZnO NWs can be modulated by adding NH3. Therefore, NH3 was added to the CFI process (the NH3-assisted CFI process, A3) to modify the properties of the ZnO NWs. An SEM image of A3 is shown in Fig. 1(c). The morphology of A3 could be regarded as a nanotip, which is different to A1 and A2. Additionally, we also analyzed the nitrogen concentration and the optical properties of A3 by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S6(a) and (b).† In this work, the nitrogen concentration of A3 refers to the percentage of atomic N to Zn in nanowires and the value is about 4%. The absorbance of A3 in the visible range is slightly higher than that of A2, as shown in Fig. S6(b).† Herein, A3 was also used as the photoanode to characterize the performance and transport properties of the DSSC. The J–V curve is shown in Fig. 2(a), and the performance is shown in Table 2. The ZnO NW photoanode synthesized by A3 had a high diffusion coefficient of approximately 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, and the conversion efficiency was improved to 2.91%. To realize the high conversion efficiency of A3, the roughness factor was estimated by dye loading, as shown in Table S1.† From the roughness factor analysis, we can find that the roughness factors of A1–A3 are similar. So, the high conversion efficiency of A3 was caused by the high transport properties of ZnO NWs. In addition, the spectra of μ-PL and μ-Raman of A3 (Fig. S4†) were shown to be different from A1 and A2. From a previous Raman analysis, the N-doped ZnO thin film revealed distinct additional modes at 275 cm−1, 510 cm−1, 582 cm−1, and 643 cm−1.19,20 These new peaks are attributed to nitrogen local vibrational modes (LVMs).21 Detailed studies on this type of ZnO NWs are needed, but we do know that this type of ZnO NW is suitable to serve as DSSC photoanodes.
This study developed a new method to continuously synthesize ZnO NWs and added NH3 to modulate the electron diffusion coefficient. Although the ZnO NWs with high diffusion coefficients increased the conversion efficiency, the dye absorption amount with the ZnO NWs was still low. Recently, a ZnO NWs–NPs composite photoanode could be used as the photoanode of the DSSCs.22,23 To effectively increase the dye adsorption area, a thicker ZnO NWs–NPs film could be employed as photoanode. In this work, a high diffusion coefficient of ZnO NWs could be prepared by the NH3-assisted CFI process as trunk without affecting seriously the carrier transport. Therefore, the length of ZnO NWs was increased to 25 μm as the trunk and the ZnO NPs were synthesized among the ZnO NWs using base-free chemical bath deposition (CBD) with a 0.15 M methanolic solution of zinc acetate dihydrate at 60 °C for 8–20 h (A4), as shown in Fig. 1(d) and S7.† Structural analyses of the ZnO NWs–NPs composite photoanode were performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Typical cross-sectional TEM images and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the ZnO NWs–NPs are shown in Fig. 3(a) and its inset. Fig. 3(b) shows a typical high-resolution (HR) TEM image of a ZnO NW–NP composite at the interfacial region of the NW and NP. This reveals that a ZnO NP with a diameter of approximately 15 nm was grown on the surface of the ZnO NW and the lattice fringe of the NP was aligned to the single-crystal NW, indicating an epitaxial relationship between the NW and NP.

The IPCE and J–V characteristics of the N719-sensitized ZnO NWs–NPs composite DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4. The performances and transport properties are listed in Table 2. The IPCE for cells with N719 reached 98% in the spectral range from 400 to 800 nm. In addition, the photovoltaic characteristics JSC, VOC, FF, and the conversion efficiency (η) were 17.01 mA cm−2, 0.70 V, 0.60, and 7.14%, respectively. EIS impedance analysis showed that the diffusion coefficient of the ZnO NW–NP was maintained at 1.02 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, which was similar to that of the ZnO NW photoanode. For the ZnO NW–NP composite photoanode, the dye absorption amount was substantially increased by decorating the ZnO NPs and the roughness factor reached 689 (see Table S1†). Fig. 5(a) shows IPCE spectra of ZnO NWs (A3) and ZnO NWs–NPs (A4). Compared to the ZnO NW (A3) photoanode, the ZnO NW–NP (A4) photoanode exhibited significantly increased IPCE over the entire wavelength region. In the previous studies,24,25 the light scattering efficiency can be observed from the normalized IPCE spectrum. In this work, the normalized IPCE spectra were shown in Fig. 5(b). In the long wavelength region (600–800 nm), the ZnO NW–NP (A4) photoanode achieves a higher normalized IPCE than the ZnO NW (A3) photoanode. The result indicates the red light is more efficiently utilized through light scattering of the ZnO NW–NP photoanode.

In summary, the ZnO NWs synthesized using the ammonia-assisted continuous flow injection process were suitable to serve as the photoanodes of DSSCs because of its high crystal quality and high electron transport properties. The diffusion coefficient reached 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, the highest recorded for ZnO NW photoanodes. To achieve a high conversion efficiency for ZnO-based DSSCs, long ZnO NWs with a high diffusion coefficient were used as the trunk, and ZnO NPs were conformally-covered on the surfaces of the ZnO NWs to increase the dye absorption amount. A high-efficiency DSSC of 7.14% was achieved using a N719-sensitized and a 25 μm length ZnO NW–NP composite photoanode.
