    , Accepted 4th June 2021First published on 14th June 2021AbstractAlthough two-dimensional fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have recently attracted increasing attention, designing highly efficient two-dimensional FREAs with a new heterocycle-based two-dimensional central core for further development is still a great challenge. Herein, two chlorinated two-dimensional fused-ring electron acceptors (namely C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl) were synthesized for polymer solar cells, featuring with the two-dimensional conjugated central donor units by alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene (BDSe), respectively. Compared with C8T-BDT4Cl, C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum and a narrower optical bandgap. Moreover, we first studied the single crystals of such two-dimensional conjugated FREAs and the crystallographic analysis indicates that both acceptors presented 3D network packing with three independent molecular conformations, but C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibits more enhanced multiple intermolecular interactions with slightly shorter π–π interaction distances. A C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based blend film exhibited a more favorable morphology with better face-on intermolecular packing with a longer coherent length and more suitable phase separation, resulting in more efficient charge separation, transport, and collection. Consequently, benefiting from the above-mentioned merits, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 presented a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.5% with higher Jsc than that of sulfur-containing analogue-based C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 (12.2%). These results indicate a unique application prospect of the selenium-substituted FREAs and demonstrate that combination of the two-dimensional conjugated central core and selenium-substituted in the central electron-rich position strategy is an effective approach to improve the Jsc value and PCE of two-dimensional FREA-based PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been increasingly employed in the field of solar energy utilization due to their unique advantages such as low-cost solution processing, flexibility and lightweight.1–6 Recently, the PSCs based on the BHJ of polymeric donors and small-molecular fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) as photoactive layers have attracted much attention.7 Currently, the performances of binary and ternary PSCs based on novel FREAs have both exceeded 17%,8–16 respectively, which significantly outperformed that of all-small/all-polymer organic solar cells.17–25 These results are ascribed to the reasonable and flexible design strategies and the in-depth understanding of the structure–property relationship of FREAs.
For the design strategies of the molecular structure, most frequently, research often started with modulating the structure of the electron-rich core moiety with proper side chains (known as the core strategy)26–36 or developing the electron-deficient end-group fragment (known as end-group strategy).37–48 As much as end-group strategy, it currently tends to graft halogenated atoms onto 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the acceptor unit,49–51 which can improve optical and film-forming properties of the corresponding FREAs and can also reduce the non-radiative energy loss of the corresponding devices.52,53 However, much effort has been devoted to the synthesis of a unique core moiety with proper side chains, which is the main component of FREAs and plays an important role in the regulation of molecular properties54–57 including energy levels, light absorption, aggregation state and charge transport properties. Moreover, compared with the end-group strategy, there are much more modification sites on the electron-rich core moiety, thus, to a certain extent, which is more conducive to structural diversity and innovation. Generally, two main avenues are presently adopted in the core strategy. The first avenue can be defined as a skeleton-modulated strategy58–60 including changing the length, symmetry or dimension (one-dimensional and two-dimensional) of the conjugated skeleton. While the second one can be defined as a heteroatom-doped strategy, the implementation of this strategy is via introducing heteroatoms (including Se, N, Si, O, and B) into the molecular skeleton without much change in the conjugated skeleton.61–70
Among these skeleton-modulated strategies, motivated by the design strategies of polymers,71–74 Zhan et al. presented first 2D conjugated side-chain-functionalized FREA ITIC2 with a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit,60 which showed redshifted absorption, higher charge mobility, and higher PCE (11.0%) relative to ITIC1 without 2D conjugated side-chains (8.54%). After that, expanding the skeleton structure of FREAs with various symmetrical and asymmetrical 2D conjugated side chains has been achieved and the efficiency has been significantly improved due to its unique merits of 2D conjugated side chains on fine-tuning the energy level and morphology.75–80 Recently, single-crystal structures of some linear and banana-shaped FREAs have been reported,81–83 which is conducive to the in-depth understanding of the relationship between the molecular structure, self-assembly and their charge transport properties. However, to date, systematic studies on the incorporation of the single-crystal structure to investigate the effect of the 2D central core on molecular packing, the morphology of blend films and device performance of 2D FREAs have not been reported. It might be the multiple flexible side chains with strong disorder that cause the difficulty in achieving high-quality single crystals, which limited the further development of highly efficient 2D FREAs. In addition, as we know, most of the 2D FREAs are constructed with derivatives of BDT as the central core, which might be because BDT with various 2D side chains is easy to be synthesized. The lack of other 2D central core units, especially for other heterocycle-based 2D central core units, seriously bounded the development of highly efficient 2D FREAs. Therefore, to enrich the types of 2D FREAs, it is urgent to design new highly efficient 2D FREAs with new heterocycle-based 2D central core units and systematically study their single-crystal structures to further understand the unique function of the 2D central core.
As another important design and synthesis strategy, heteroatom-doped strategies, especially the selenium substitution strategy is regarded as one of the most important ones in the design and synthesis of highly efficient FREAs.61–65,84–87 In Chart 1a and b, some classic examples of systematic comparison between selenium-substituted FREAs and the corresponding sulfur-substituted analogues are summarized. For C-shaped FREAs (seen in Chart 1a), Jen et al. and Wang et al. replaced sulfur with selenium in the outermost position of FREAs, which can effectively control the molecular energy level, spectral absorption, and charge mobilities, thereby improving the performance of FREAs-based PSCs.62,65 When the selenium move toward into the central electron-deficient unit of C-shaped FREAs, Lin et al. and Yan et al. independently revealed the molecular properties (including more red-shifted absorption spectrum, narrower optical bandgap and lower Urbach energy) of selenium-substituted FREAs was enhanced related to its sulfur-substituted analogue.61,63 While for S-shaped FREAs as seen in Chart 1b, Wang et al. reported that selenium-containing FREAs exhibited better performance than their sulfur-containing analogues by replacing sulfur with selenium in the outermost position.85 However, previous works reported that the selenium substitution for the inner central electron-rich unit is far behind that of the outermost electron-rich position,51 and there was no direct comparison between such types of selenium-substituted FREAs and the corresponding sulfur-substituted analogues, which aroused the research interest in the effect of the selenium substitution in the inner central electron-rich position of S-shaped FREAs. More importantly, to fully exploit these merits attributed to selenium substitution, systematic and comprehensive investigation on the influence of selenium substitution in 2D FREAs is necessary. However, 2D FREAs with selenium substitution in the outermost or the central position have never been reported for high-performance OSCs due to the critical challenge in the synthesis of selenophene-based 2D FREAs. Therefore, it is very necessary to combine the 2D conjugated central core strategy and selenium-substituted in the central electron-rich position strategy to systematically explore the direct and clear difference between selenium-substituted FREAs and the corresponding sulfur-substituted analogues on the electronic property, single-crystal packing, film morphology, and photovoltaic performance of the selenium-substituted 2D conjugated FREAs.
 Chart 1  Chemical structural summaries of systematic comparison works between selenium-substituted fused-ring electron acceptors and the corresponding sulphur-substituted analogues in (a) previous C-shaped acceptors, (b) previous S-shaped acceptors, and (c) two-dimensional acceptors in this work. 
To address the above-mentioned issues, we, for the first time, introduced a selenium substitution strategy in the synthesis of 2D FREAs by doping selenium in the central position of the 2D electron-rich core moiety and synthesized two chlorinated 2D FREAs to provide a platform for the direct comparison between selenium-substituted FREAs and the corresponding sulfur-substituted analogues (seen in Chart 1c) on the optoelectronic property, single-crystal packing and morphology of these materials and the corresponding photovoltaic performance. In detail, as seen in Fig. 1a, a selenium-substituted 2D FREA for PSCs, named C8T-BDSe4Cl, was obtained by starting from alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene (BDSe) with a new synthetic strategy in comparison with the corresponding sulfur-based analogue (C8T-BDT4Cl). As expected, due to the replacement of the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the central position, C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibited slightly broader and stronger absorption and a narrower bandgap than that of C8T-BDT4Cl. Fortunately, reasonable conditions were selected to overcome the difficulty of single-crystal growth of 2D FREAs. X-ray crystallographic data of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl were first obtained in this work. The molecular packing of both C8T-BDSe4Cl and C8T-BDT4Cl present a typical 3D “network” motif with three independent molecular conformations. In addition, due to the change of chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium, C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibits a shorter π–π stacking distance, more aggregation morphology and a tighter lamellar distance; thus, the intermolecular interaction of C8T-BDSe4Cl is enhanced relative to that of C8T-BDT4Cl, which is a benefit for charge transport. Consequently, benefitting from the above-mentioned advantages and favorable blend film morphologies with better suitable phase separation and nanoscale-interpenetrating fibril structures, the optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based PSCs exhibited higher Jsc of 21.79 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest values in the PSCs based on 2D FREAs. Therefore, the PCE of optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based PSCs is 13.5%, which is higher than that of sulfur-containing analogue-based PSCs (12.2%). The results indicate that the design and synthesis of 2D FREAs with selenium substitution in the central position indeed is an effective avenue to improve the performance of devices by simultaneously improving the Jsc value and FF. Furthermore, the successful synthesis of the selenium-substituted 2D electron-rich core moiety and the more efficient performance in the PSCs certify that the first attempt to combine the 2D central core unit strategy and selenium substitution in the central electron-rich position strategy is feasible.

Results and discussion
The synthesis routes of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was achieved by a general method as reported.88 Compound 2 was obtained via a Stille coupling reaction starting from compound 1 and tributyl-(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane in 87% yield. Then, central core compound 3 was obtained via two steps of acidification and decarboxylation with a total yield of 45%. Compound 4 was obtained from compound 3via a butyllithium reaction and then reacted with the solution of trimethyltin chloride in THF. The Stille coupling reaction between the ditin reagent of compound 4 and 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate was used to obtain compound 5 in 90% yield. Then, the nucleophilic addition reaction between 5 and (4-hexylphenyl)-lithium was performed, which was followed by the p-toluenesulfonic acid-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction to synthesize 2D electron-rich core moiety compound 6 with a total yield of 63%. After that, dialdehyde reagent 7 was synthesized by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with a high yield of 85%. Finally, the target compound C8T-BDSe4Cl was prepared by Knoevenagel condensation between 7 and 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl) in 93% yield. While the counterpart C8T-BDT4Cl was obtained via Knoevenagel condensation between HBDT-CHO77 and IC-2Cl with a yield of 86%. All the detailed experimental steps and new compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF-MS (see ESI†). Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot of C8T-BDSe4Cl was obtained (as shown in Fig. S1†) to investigate its thermal stability, and the decomposition temperature at 5% weight-loss was of 354 °C, which indicated that the thermal stability of C8T-BDSe4Cl is enough for PSCs.

To figure out the influences of chalcogen atom replacement from sulfur to selenium in the central electron-rich core moiety on the optical absorption properties, the absorption spectra of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl were recorded, as shown in Fig. 1b (thin film) and Fig. S2a† (solution), and the values are summarized in Table 1. In dilute chloroform solution, when compared to C8T-BDT4Cl, C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibited a maximum absorption peak at 746 nm and an extinction coefficient of 2.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is broader and stronger than that of C8T-BDT4Cl with a maximum absorption peak at 738 nm and extinction coefficient of 2.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In thin films, both C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibited redshifted absorption relative to their absorption in the solution and performed near-infrared (NIR) absorption FREA characteristics with a narrow optical band gap (by the general equation: Eoptg = 1240/λonset). In detail, when compared to C8T-BDT4Cl, because of replacing sulfur with selenium in the central position of the electron-rich core moiety, the absorption of C8T-BDSe4Cl displayed a maximum absorption peak at 892 nm with Eoptg of 1.39 eV, which was slightly red-shifted in comparison with that of C8T-BDT4Cl with Eoptg of 1.40 eV. These results indicated that introducing selenium into the central core of 2D FREAs could contribute to extending and enhancing the absorption relative to that of sulfur-containing counterpart.

To investigate the geometry of the backbone of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl, the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level was introduced where the alkyl substituents were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S3,† both C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl displayed distinct 2D geometry. The calculation results of HOMO/LUMO are −5.50 eV/−3.52 eV and −5.47 eV/−3.53 eV for C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl, respectively. Furthermore, the dipole influence of the replacement of the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the donor unit was also verified by the calculation of half-molecular dipole (seen in Fig. S4†). The result indicated the half-molecular dipole moment of C8T-BDSe4Cl (10.28 Debye), which is slightly higher than that of C8T-BDSe4Cl (10.08 Debye). Normally, a larger dipole moment in FREAs contributes to revealing their better features of devices in terms of intramolecular interaction and charge recombination;78 thus, in contrast to C8T-BDT4Cl, C8T-BDSe4Cl exhibits the more enhanced intramolecular interaction, which agrees with their optical absorption properties as above. For the CV test, the CV curves and the energy level alignment are displayed in Fig. 1c and S2b.† The values of HOMO/LUMO were calculated from onset oxidation and reduction potentials and calibrated using an Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The HOMO/LUMO values (shown in Table 1) are −5.75 eV/−3.92 eV for C8T-BDT4Cl and −5.71 eV/−3.96 eV for C8T-BDSe4Cl, respectively, indicating that the change of chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the donor unit can upshift HOMO but downshift LUMO, which contributed to reducing the bandgap.
To achieve an in-depth understanding of the “structure–property-performance” relationship, in this work, the single-crystal structures of 2D FREAs were first obtained via slow diffusion of ethanol to their chloroform solution. The single-crystal structures of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl crystallized in triclinic space group P, respectively. All the detailed crystal parameters of the two molecules are displayed in Table S1.† For the single molecular configuration, as shown in Fig. 2, both C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl presented a 2D geometry, with the oxygen atom of carbonyl group on the end group pointing toward the sulfur atom of the neighboring thiophene ring. Owing to the replacement of the chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of the electron-rich core moiety, the S⋯O distances of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl were 2.71 Å and 2.70 Å, respectively, which were less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur and oxygen (3.32 Å), indicating the close contact between the donor cores and the end groups. Moreover, the torsion angles of both C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl between the end groups and electron-rich core moiety were 14.3° and 12.8°, respectively. The relatively large torsion angle of C8T-BDT4Cl may be attributed to the stronger multiple intermolecular S⋯π interactions between the central electron-rich core moiety and the end groups (Fig. S5†). These results indicated that the change of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of the electron-rich core moiety can enhance the intramolecular interactions and the planarity, thereby resulting in smaller optical bandgaps and red-shifted absorption spectra. Besides, according to the structural characteristics of 2D FREAs, the torsion angle between the 2D side chain and linear molecular skeleton was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2, when the replacement of the chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium occurred in the central position of the donor unit, the values of torsion angle were 78.8° for C8T-BDT4Cl and 85.3° for C8T-BDSe4Cl, respectively, which may be due to the larger atomic radius of selenium that increases the electron cloud density of the donor core, resulting in increased repulsion between the 2D side chain and linear molecular skeleton. Overall, the change in chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of the donor unit can cause the differences in single-molecule configuration, which may bring about dissimilar molecular packing in the solid state, thereby resulting in different charge transfer efficiencies.
 Fig. 2  Top view and side view of single-crystal structures of (a) C8T-BDT4Cl and (b) C8T-BDSe4Cl. 
As Fig. S6† depicted, the molecular packing of both C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl displayed a reticular architecture with 3D π–π stacking, respectively, and this packing motif undoubtedly has been proven to contribute to enhancing the efficient charge transport via facilitating multiple electron transport channels.81 However, due to the change in chalcogen atoms in the central position of donor units, the π–π interaction between two molecules shows a difference. As depicted in Fig. 3a and b, two types of π–π interaction originated from the end groups and the electron-rich core moiety of three kinds of orientations (colored azure, pink, brown), respectively. In detail, the values of the π–π stacking distance between two terminal groups in C8T-BDSe4Cl crystal were 3.40 Å and 3.36 Å, respectively, which were obviously smaller than those of the C8T-BDT4Cl crystal (3.42 Å and 3.39 Å). The tighter packing feature of C8T-BDSe4Cl benefited from the closer multiple noncovalent interactions of Cl⋯S, Cl⋯π and Cl⋯N, which will help promote molecular crystallinity and aggregation. As we all know, side chains in FREAs are critical to prevent the interactions between donor units while simultaneously filling void space and directing the packing of crystals. In this work, as shown in Fig. S6,† the 2D side chains in the structures not only can enhance the filling of void space but also exhibit a special intermolecular interaction channel that originated from 2D alkylthienyl in single crystals of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl (Fig. S7†), which is beneficial for the increase in intermolecular interaction. Moreover, the unique feature in 2D FREAs leads us to believe that the reticular architecture with 3D π–π stacking in the crystal of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl may be closely related to their 2D side chains. However, due to the replacement of selenium, the intensity of intermolecular interaction is changed. In detail, the values of π–π stacking distance (between 2D alkylthienyl and arylbenzene) and σ⋯π distance (between Cl and arylbenzene) of C8T-BDSe4Cl are 3.35 Å and 3.83 Å, respectively, which are smaller than that of the C8T-BDT4Cl crystal (3.41 Å and 3.88 Å), indicating that the molecular packing in the crystal of C8T-BDSe4Cl is tighter in comparison with that of C8T-BDT4Cl. These results indicate that changing the chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central electron-rich core moiety can effectively enhance intermolecular or intramolecular interactions with shorter π–π stacking distances during molecular packing of FREAs, which contributes to enhancing the molecular crystallinity with more ordered 3D interpenetrating networks and better charge–transport properties.

To figure out the effect of structure–property with the chalcogen atom replacement from sulfur to selenium in the central position of C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl. The devices were fabricated by the structure of ITO/ZnO/FREAs:PM6/MoOx/Ag. The optimal conditions for both C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blends were a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 in chlorobenzene solution with 0.5% DIO additive and thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min (see Fig. S8 and Table S2†). The photovoltaic data are presented in Table 2. The current-density-voltage (J–V) curves of the C8T-BDSe4Cl- and C8T-BDT4Cl-based devices with DIO additives are displayed in Fig. 4a. In detail, the C8T-BDT4Cl-based device exhibits a lower PCE of 12.21% with a Jsc value of 19.65 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.86 V, and an FF value of 72.32%, while due to replacement of sulfur with selenium in the central position, the PCE of C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices is boosted up to 13.50% with a Jsc value of 21.79 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.85 V, and a FF value of 72.71%, which is better than those of the C8T-BDT4Cl-based device owing to the enhancement of Jsc. This may be due to the broader absorption range of C8T-BDSe4Cl, which helps improve the efficiency of using sunlight, and the shorter π–π stacking distance in the single-crystal structure of C8T-BDSe4Cl is beneficial to the enhancement of intermolecular charge transfer (ICT), thereby resulting in higher Jsc. Moreover, the same Eloss of 0.54 eV was achieved in C8T-BDT4Cl- and C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices. In Fig. 4b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are depicted. Broad and wide (300 to 890 nm) photoresponse features were presented in the EQE spectra of C8T-BDT4Cl- and C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices, and all the values of EQE in the range of 500 to 800 nm exceed 70%. Specifically, for the optimal C8T-BDT4Cl-based device, the maximum EQE value is only 73% at 563 nm, while the maximum value of 80% is presented at 611 nm in the optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl-based device. The larger maximum EQE value indicates that the photoelectron conversion efficiency is higher in C8T-BDSe4Cl-based device than in its sulfur-containing analogue-based devices. Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the calculated Jsc values from EQE curves were 18.80 mA cm−2 for the optimal C8T-BDT4Cl-based device and 20.83 mA cm−2 for the optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl-based device, respectively, corresponding to the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves within a reasonable mismatch.

The correlation between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective applied voltage (Veff) for the optimal device was investigated to gain insight into the charge generation and transfer properties. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the darkness, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 4c, both the devices based on C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 reached their saturated photocurrent density Jsat (Jsat, defined as Jph = Jsat) when Veff reaches ca. 4 V, which implied the excitons being dissociated and the charge being almost totally collected without any bimolecular recombination. However, owing to the replacement of chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the central position of FREAs, the C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based devices reached the Jsat value and a slightly lower Veff than that of C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6-based devices. In theory, the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) (describing the probability of exciton dissociation at the D/A interface) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) (describing the fraction of free charge carriers that can be collected by the electrodes) can be calculated under short circuit conditions and maximum power output conditions, respectively. Pdiss is defined as , where  is the photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions, while Pcoll is defined as , where  is the photocurrent density under maximum power output conditions. Under short circuit conditions, the Pdiss values for C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6-based and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based devices are 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. While under maximum power output conditions, the Pcoll values for C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6-based and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based devices are 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. The results of higher Pdiss and Pcoll for the optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based devices indicated that C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 show more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, resulting in an increase in Jsc of the devices, which is consistent with the result of EQE.
To further explore the charge recombination processes in C8T-BDT4Cl- and C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices, as indicated in Fig. 4d, the measurement of Jsc at different light intensities (P) was presented. Generally, Jsc and P can be related via the equation Jph ∝ Pα. When the exponential factor (α) is close to 1, the bimolecular recombination in devices is negligible. The α value of the C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices is 0.95, which is slightly higher than that of C8T-BDT4Cl-based devices (0.93). This result further indicates that the charge recombination is more efficiently restrained in C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices. In addition, to evaluate the charge transport properties in C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6- and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6-based devices, as shown in Fig. S9,† space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was performed. In detail, for C8T-BDSe4Cl-based devices, the values of electron and hole mobilities were calculated to be 4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are obviously higher than that of C8T-BDT4Cl-based devices (μe = 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh = 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 possesses excellent charge-transporting behavior including the higher charge carrier mobilities and the more balanced μe/μh ratio, which may be ascribed to the replacement of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of FREAs with a more favorable morphology.
Morphology–performance relationships of blend films are of great significance to the performance of PSCs.89,90 In this contribution, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigate the effect of chalcogen atoms changing from sulfur to selenium on the surface and bulk morphologies of 2D FREA-based blend films. As depicted in Fig. 5a and b, uniform and smooth surfaces were presented on the optimal C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blend films, respectively. Accurately, the optimal C8T-BDSe4Cl-based blend exhibited a slightly larger aggregation and a higher RMS roughness of 1.56 nm than that of the C8T-BDT4Cl-based blend film (1.48 nm), which contributed to enhancing the ohmic contact, thus resulting in higher Jsc. Additionally, the TEM images are displayed in Fig. 5c and d, and all the optimal blend films are presented with an interpenetrating reticular nanofibril structure, indicating that the two FREAs could be intermixed very well with PM6. However, when compared with C8T-BDT4Cl-based blend films, C8T-BDSe4Cl-based films displayed a better suitable phase separation and nanoscale-interpenetrating fibril structure, which was helpful for exciton dissociation and charge transport, thereby contributing to high Jsc. These results indicate that the replacement of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of FREAs can effectively optimize the surface morphology with proper phase separation.

As presented in Fig. 6a and b, 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate the effect of different 2D electron-rich core moieties on the crystallinity and molecular order. In addition, the in-plane (IP) line or out-of-plane (OOP)-cuts in GIWAXS for the corresponding neat films are shown in Fig. 6e. The pure C8T-BDT4Cl- and C8T-BDSe4Cl-based films displayed dominant “face-on” orientations with distinct diffraction peaks. Due to the replacement of the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the central position, the diffraction peak signal in the neat film of C8T-BDSe4Cl was slightly stronger than that of C8T-BDT4Cl. In detail, for the neat C8T-BDT4Cl film, a sharp (100) diffraction peak at 0.26 Å−1 in the IP direction and an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.73 Å−1 in the OOP direction were observed, corresponding to a lamellar distance of 24.1 Å and π–π stacking distance of 3.63 Å. While in the neat film of C8T-BDSe4Cl, the lamellar (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction was at 0.29 Å−1 and the π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction was at 1.75 Å−1, corresponding to a lamellar distance of 21.6 Å and π–π stacking distance of 3.58 Å. Moreover, the value of the corresponding coherence length (CCL) in the IP direction for C8T-BDSe4Cl was 94.2 Å, which was higher than that of C8T-BDT4Cl (80.7 Å). These results indicated that with the change of the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium, molecular packing and crystallization were enhanced, which may be due to the more compact stacking in C8T-BDSe4Cl single-crystal structures. Meanwhile, the GIWAXS of C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 and C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blend films are presented in Fig. 6c and d, and the sharp (010) scattering peaks in the OOP direction and the pronounced peaks in the IP direction were observed, which revealed that C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl could be intermixed very well with PM6 to finally form a predominant “face-on” orientation, which is beneficial for exciton transmission. In detail, the optimal C8T-BDT4Cl-based blend films, the sharp (010) peak in the OOP direction was at ca. 1.74 Å−1 and the lamellar (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction was at ca. 0.29 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.60 Å and a lamellar distance of 21.6 Å. When compared to the optimal C8T-BDT4Cl-based blend films, both of π–π stacking distance (3.56 Å) and lamellar distance (21.5 Å) of C8T-BDSe4Cl-based blend films were slightly smaller, respectively. Furthermore, with the change of the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium in the central position, the CCL values of C8T-BDT4Cl- and C8T-BDSe4Cl-based blend films in the OOP direction were increased from 20.2 to 21.7 Å, indicating stronger intermolecular interaction and better crystallinity in C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blend films, which agreed with their corresponding AFM images below and conducive to decreasing charge recombination. Consequently, C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blend films exhibit better face-on orientation, more compact stacking with smaller π–π stacking distance and lamellar distance, and larger CCL value, thus resulting in higher Jsc in devices.

Conclusion
In summary, the selenium-substituted central electron-rich unit strategy was first applied in the synthesis of 2D FREA (C8T-BDSe4Cl) with alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene as the central unit. In comparison with sulfur-substituted similar 2D FREA (C8T-BDT4Cl), we systematically investigated the effect of the replacement of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central electron-rich position on their electronic property, crystal packing, film morphology, and photovoltaic performance. Due to the regulation of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of the donor units, C8T-BDSe4Cl presented broader absorption and narrower optical bandgap than those of C8T-BDT4Cl. Additionally, the single-crystal structure of 2D FREAs indicated the change of chalcogen atoms from sulfur to selenium in the central position of the electron-rich core moiety significantly affected the molecular conformation and packing. Compared with C8T-BDT4Cl, the π–π stacking interactions and other multiple non-covalent intermolecular interactions in the C8T-BDSe4Cl crystal were enhanced and the corresponding distances became shorter. Moreover, C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 blend films achieved the face-on orientation crystallinity, favorable nanofiber-like morphology with suitable phase separation, weaker charge recombination, and higher charge carrier mobilities in comparison with that of C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 blend films, enabling higher Jsc, FF, and the performance of C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 PSCs. As expected, the optimal devices based on C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 showed a PCE of 13.5%, which is obviously higher than that of C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 (12.2%), benefitting from its higher Jsc (21.79 mA cm−2). It is noteworthy that a PCE of 13.5% is one of the highest values in 2D FREA-based binary PSCs. Our work demonstrated that combining the selenium substitution strategy and the 2D configuration strategy in the central position of the FREAs plays a crucial role in achieving extended optical absorption, tighter crystal packing, higher charge mobilities, and more favorable morphology of the blend films, eventually enhancing the performances of 2D FREA-based PSCs. Moreover, considering the flexibility of 2D conjugated side modules in selenium-containing 2D donor units, it can be envisaged that careful screening of 2D conjugated side modules will be used to further promote the device performance of 2D conjugated FREA-based PSCs.
