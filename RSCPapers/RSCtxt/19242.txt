    , Accepted 19th July 2016First published on 19th July 2016AbstractTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) manifest excellent phonon-limited mobility and strong light–matter interaction, which, however, conflict with the long response time and low responsivity of TMD-based photodetectors. The extreme susceptibility of TMDs' electronic qualities to the large density of unscreened disturbances from the SiO2 substrate accounts for such inconformity. Here, we evaluated the potential of WS2 for photodetectors by passivating SiO2 substrates with layered Bi2Te3, a representative three dimensional topological insulator. Comparative photoswitching measurements of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector demonstrated its stable and broadband photoresponse from 370 to 1550 nm. Meanwhile, WS2 and Bi2Te3 allied a high responsivity of 30.7 A W−1, a pronounced detectivity of 2.3 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1 as well as a short response time of 20 ms, which make the device stand out among previously reported WS2 photodetectors. In fact, the responsivity and detectivity are comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photodetectors (R ∼ 0.5 to 0.85 A W−1, D* ∼ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1), suggesting its great potential for practical applications. In addition, we also established that the excellent device performance is attributed to the synergy of the passivation of the SiO2 substrate, efficient carrier separation at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface and excellent carrier transport along the time-reversal-symmetry protected surface channel of Bi2Te3. In summary, these findings suggest that the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector will launch a significant advance in next-generation photodetection. Moreover, the interface engineering strategy depicts a universal scenario for development of TMD devices in the future.
Introduction
van der Waals materials (vdWMs) represent a family of layered structures including graphene,1 boron nitride (BN),2 transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs),3 and black phosphorus (BP),4 as well as other emerging members such as arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene.5 Generally, they comprise weakly vdW-interacting molecular layers, inside which atoms are associated via strong covalent bonds. In the past decade, they have exhibited great potential in extensive applications spanning the realms of piezoelectricity,6 lithium-ion batteries,7 light polarization analyzers8 and so forth. Benefiting from the appealing optical and electrical attributes,3 TMDs are regarded as alternative candidates to traditional semiconductors such as Si and Ge for next-generation photoelectric applications. For example, by virtue of the sizable bandgaps and strong light–matter interaction, Yin et al. successfully fabricated a monolayer MoS2 phototransistor with definite photoswitching behavior and post-graphene responsivity (7 mA W−1).9 Besides, based on the excellent thermostability, Song et al. fabricated robust MoS2 photodetectors which operated in harsh working temperature.10 Moreover, taking advantage of the dangling-bond-free surface, Deng et al. constructed a clean and atomically sharp BP/MoS2 vdW heterojunction solar cell, which achieved an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 0.3%.11 Recently, some studies pointed out that compared to their monolayer counterparts, multilayer c-axis-oriented TMDs possess larger in-plane mobility.12–14 Meanwhile, the light absorbance is greatly enhanced15,16 and the effective wavelength range is substantially broadened.13,16 Therefore, compared to their monolayer counterparts, the multilayer TMD based photodetectors delivered superior responsivity from 0.1 A W−1 to 1.42 A W−1.17–19
In spite of this ongoing progress, one enduring challenge standing before the further advancement of TMDs is extrinsic disturbances. These include the Coulomb impurities, phonon scattering and defect-induced traps. Since the screening effect of the atomic scale TMD layer is rather weak, their electronic quality is quite vulnerable and susceptible to extrinsic disturbances. Among various extrinsic environments, the SiO2 substrate is reported to be the dominant disturbance source.20–22 On one hand, the amorphous SiO2 layer causes irregular potential fluctuations.22 On the other hand, the Si–O bonds terminate on the surface and dangling bonds take over.21 The density of these surface states could be rather high, which is in the order of the surface atom density (∼1015 atoms per cm2). Thus, the intimate chemical binding between the SiO2 substrate and TMD aggravates the interface, which gives rise to serious carrier scattering.21 Thus, TMDs grown on SiO2 substrates usually show low carrier mobility from 0.005 to 4.7 cm2 V−1 s−1,9,20,22–24 which is several orders of magnitude lower than their intrinsic phonon-limited ceiling.20 As a result, this is manifested in the widely reported long response time (1 to 100 s), poor responsivity (10−8 to 1 A W−1) and low detectivity (106 to 109 cm Hz1/2 W−1) for the TMD based photodetectors.9,14,19,23,25–27 These figures-of-merit lag far behind those of the state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photodetectors (R ∼ 0.5 to 0.85 A W−1, D* ∼ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1).28 Whereas a mobility improvement of 2–10 times was achieved via suspending the MoS2 channel by etching away the underneath SiO2 layer,29 the fabrication process is too complex for realistic commercialization, not to mention the high processing cost. In addition, the fragile hollow structure suffers from collapse. Therefore, an alternative strategy must be developed to address this predicament.
In contrast to TMDs, the three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) represents a new quantum phase that possesses an insulating bulk state while supporting time-reversal-symmetry protected metallic surface states (SSs). The second generation 3D TIs, formulated as A2B3 (Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, or Sb2Te3), have undergone extensive study on account of their relatively simple surface electronic structure, a single Dirac cone.30 Benefiting from the spin-momentum-locked nature of the SSs, the back scattering of the TI's surface channel is greatly suppressed. This leads to an extraordinary surface mobility of 104 cm2 V−1 s−1,31 which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of TMD. Taking advantage of this merit, Liu et al. successfully fabricated highly efficient TI electrodes.32 Moreover, by virtue of its robust qualities, the surface Dirac electronic states were still maintained at the heterointerface between a nontrivial TI and a trivial semiconductor.33 Therefore, this suggests great potential for the development of TI based multilayer systems. In fact, benefiting from the synergy of the excellent transport capacity and broad absorption range of the TI's SSs,32,34 a fast, stable and highly responsive Bi2Te3/Si heterojunction photodetector operating from ultraviolet (370 nm) to terahertz (118 μm) was successfully achieved.35 On the other hand, the second generation 3D TIs comprise A2B3 quintuple layers. Such dangling-bond free layered films help to passivate the underneath defective surface.36 Meanwhile, they serve as the least invasive substrates and thus mitigate the deformation of the subsequently deposited sample.37
Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the second generation 3D TIs complement the bottleneck of TMDs. By engineering the SiO2 surface with the second generation 3D TIs, the successively deposited TMD channel can circumvent the lattice matching condition, resulting in the production of high crystalline quality and pronounced device performance. However, to date, proof-of-concept is still absent. This is probably due to the lack of a facile technology to obtain a high-quality TMD/TI double-layer on account of their considerably distinct physical and chemical properties. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD), a clean and efficient approach reproducing the target's components onto the substrate, has been proven to be a versatile technology for the growth of various vdWMs including GaSe,38 Bi,39 Bi2Te3,40 MoS225 and WS2.41 Compared to the CVD and mechanical exfoliation approaches, PLD holds unique advantages. First, it is a precursor-free physical vapor deposition method, which causes little contamination. Second, the growth rate and thickness of the films can be controlled by the energy fluence and pulse number of the pulsed laser.42 Most importantly, it is a large-area growth technology producing centimeter scale thin samples, which is of great significance for integrated device implementation because of their ready compatibility with modern semiconductor technology.43,44 Therefore, it holds great potential to achieve high-quality TMD/TI double-layers.
In this contribution, we fabricate a WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer by successively depositing Bi2Te3 and WS2 films via PLD. Comparative measurements of the WS2/Bi2Te3-based photodetector demonstrate its stable and broadband photoresponse (370 to 1550 nm). Besides, the photocurrent exhibited a positive dependence on both the source–drain voltage and the incident power density, providing good tunability for multi-functional photoelectrical applications. Additionally, the device manifested a high responsivity of 30.7 A W−1, a good detectivity of 2.3 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1, as well as a short response time of 20 ms, which make the device stand out among the previously reported WS2 photodetectors.14,19,23,26,27,45–48 Importantly, the responsivity and detectivity are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photodetectors (R ∼ 0.5 to 0.85 A W−1, D* ∼ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1). By qualitatively analyzing the band structures, we attribute the enhanced photodetection performance to the synergy of the passivation of the SiO2 substrate, efficient carrier separation at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface and excellent carrier transport along the time-reversal-symmetry protected surface channel of Bi2Te3. In summary, the excellent device performance of the PLD-grown WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector may have significant prospects for next-generation photodetection. Moreover, the interface engineering strategy depicts a universal scenario for the development of TMD devices in the future.
Experimental section
PLD was exploited to prepare the polycrystalline Bi2Te3 and WS2 films. The deposition parameters of our experiments are described in detail below. Prior to loading into the growth chamber, the SiO2/Si substrates were successively washed with acetone and piranha solution (H2SO4 (98%):H2O2 (35%) = 3:1) in an ultrasonic environment for 30 minutes to remove organic and inorganic contamination, respectively. The base pressure of the growth chamber was lower than 2 × 10−4 Pa. Pre-growth annealing at 300 °C for 30 min was performed to further remove the remaining contamination. Then, the polycrystalline Bi2Te3 films were deposited at the optimized substrate temperature of 300 °C. The Bi2Te3 target comprised highly pure and uniform Bi (99.99%) and Te (99.99%) elements. The Bi:Te atomic ratio was 2:3. The coherent KrF excimer laser (248 nm) was operated at a power density of ca. 3 J cm−2. The repetition rate was 1 Hz. The pulse width of the laser was ca. 20 ns. Ar2 (99.99%) was exploited as the working gas. The working pressure and flow rate were set at 40 Pa and 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), respectively. Then, the substrate was heated up to 480 °C. Polycrystalline WS2 films were subsequently deposited onto the Bi2Te3 films. The WS2 target comprised highly pure and uniform W (99.99%) and S (99.99%) elements. The W:S atomic ratio was 1:2. In this growth process, the coherent KrF excimer laser was operated at a power density of ca. 4 J cm−2, with a repetition rate of 4 Hz and a total pulse number of 10000. It is to be noted that the whole deposition process can be performed by exchanging the targets in situ, which was of great significance for reducing the pollution of the external ambient environment to the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku D-MAX 2200 VPC diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm). The operating voltage and current were 40 kV and 26 mA, respectively. The Raman spectrum was obtained via a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer. An argon ion laser was exploited as the excitation source. The excitation wavelength was 514 nm. The surface morphology and thickness profile were acquired on a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (AFM). Au electrodes (ca. 120 nm in thickness) were deposited with a JEOL JFC-1600 auto fine coater system. The working current and time were 40 mA and 150 s, respectively.
Illumination with wavelength of 370 nm was generated from a CrystaLaser Class IIIb laser, and illuminations with wavelengths of 447, 532, 635, 808, 1064 and 1550 nm were generated from Viasho lasers. The transport characteristics of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetectors were evaluated using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system (SCS) equipped with a Lakeshore probe station. All measurements were performed at room temperature in ambient conditions.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) presents the crystal structure of the hexagonal WS2 and Bi2Te3. Each WS2 molecular layer comprises a trilayer, a tungsten layer sandwiched between two sulfur layers (S–W–S). Meanwhile, each Bi2Te3 molecular layer comprises a quintuple layer, two bismuth layers sandwiched among three telluride layers (Te–Bi–Te–Bi–Te). Fig. 1(b) presents a digital photograph of the WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer grown on SiO2. A large-area film with a lateral size of one centimeter is achieved, which is of great significance for practical integrated device implementation. In addition, the whole WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer appears monochromatic (green), demonstrating its uniformity. Fig. 1(c) presents a high-magnification AFM image, showing the polycrystalline morphology. Fig. 1(d) presents the XRD pattern. There are three main features. First, there exist two sets of diffraction peaks. One set (green) is attributed to WS2, and the other set (black) is attributed to Bi2Te3. Therefore, the good crystalline quality of both WS2 and Bi2Te3 in the PLD-grown WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer is demonstrated. Second, there are predominantly the (003) family diffraction peaks for the polycrystalline Bi2Te3 film and (002) family diffraction peaks for the polycrystalline WS2 film, indicative of their highly c-axis-oriented nature. This is in stark contrast to the TMD samples grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which are widely reported not to be c-axis preferably-oriented.24,48 In a previous work, Peng et al. pointed out that the transport along the basal plane of layered vdWMs was several orders of magnitude more efficient than that perpendicular to the basal plane.49 Therefore, the c-axis-oriented nature of WS2 and Bi2Te3 suggests their great potential for the efficient in-plane transport of carriers. In addition, the dangling-bond-free surfaces of the c-axis-oriented Bi2Te3 and WS2 can alleviate the lattice-mismatch-induced deformation at the heterointerface.11,50 Third, the WS2 grown on Bi2Te3 exhibits a stronger XRD pattern than that grown on SiO2 (ESI,† S1). As the thickness of Bi2Te3 increases, the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak increases. Meanwhile, the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreases from 1.05 degrees for WS2 grown directly on SiO2 to around 0.8 degrees for WS2 grown on Bi2Te3. In general, both of the above characterization results suggest the improvement of the crystalline quality. Fig. 1(e) presents the Raman spectrum of the WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer under the 514 nm excitation laser. There are also two sets of peaks. The peaks at 62.7, 107.2 and 138.5 cm−1 (black) are assigned as the A1g1, Eg2 and A1g2 vibration modes of Bi2Te3, while the peaks at 154.6, 354.5 and 418.5 cm−1 (green) are assigned as the LA(M) − E2g2, E2g1 and A1g vibration modes of WS2. The difference between the position of the E2g1 and A1g modes for WS2 is 64 cm−1, corresponding to the multilayer nature.14,46 During the growth process of a heterojunction system, by-products easily form due to the reaction between the adjacent layers. For example, it was pointed out that AgS2 formed during the deposition of WS2 on an Ag substrate via PLD.41 However, for both the XRD pattern and the Raman spectrum, there are no obvious characteristic peaks from possible by-products such as Bi2S351 and WTe2.27 Therefore, there is little reaction between the Bi2Te3 and WS2 during the PLD growth process. As demonstrated above, the Bi2Te3 and WS2 are both c-axis-oriented, exposing the most compact basal planes. Therefore, the exchange of atoms at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface was greatly suppressed, which efficiently suppressed the formation of by-products.

Then, the growth mechanism for the enhanced crystalline quality of WS2 in the WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer was unveiled. As shown in Fig. 1(f), the surface of SiO2 is full of dangling bonds. They strongly interact with the adjacent layer, which results in severe lattice distortion. Therefore, the WS2 film grown directly on SiO2 suffers relatively poor crystalline quality, which is reflected in the weak XRD pattern (ESI,† S1). As shown in Fig. 1(g), the c-axis-oriented Bi2Te3 layer passivates the dangling-bond-terminated SiO2 layer. It can efficiently screen the underneath disturbance on account of the large dielectric constant. Therefore, there is little interaction between the SiO2 and WS2. In addition, since the surfaces of Bi2Te3 and WS2 are both dangling-bond-free, the interaction between them is quite weak. As a result, the deformation of WS2 grown on Bi2Te3 is greatly suppressed. Thus, it exhibits a relatively strong XRD pattern (Fig. 1(d)).

Fig. 2(a) and (b) present the 3D schematic diagram of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector and its 2D cross-sectional view, respectively. The device comprises two Au electrodes and a WS2/Bi2Te3 double-layer channel. The channel width and length are 2.5 mm and 0.04 mm, respectively. The thickness of the WS2 layer is fixed to 15 nm, while the thickness of the underneath Bi2Te3 layer is determined by the pulse number during the PLD growth process, including 0 nm, 2 nm, 4 nm and 6 nm (ESI,† S2). For brevity, the thickness of Bi2Te3 is 4 nm unless stated otherwise hereafter. Fig. 2(c) shows the representative photoswitching behavior under periodical 635 nm light illumination. When subjected to time-dependent illumination, the device exhibits a definite photoswitching characteristic. In addition, such photoswitching characteristic has long-term stability, which is demonstrated by a consecutive photoswitching curve (ESI,† S3) spanning a long period (∼2000 s) and a number of cycles (∼33 cycles). Fig. 2(d) presents a transient photoresponse. The rise and decay times are both extracted to be ca. 20 ms, which are several orders of magnitude faster than the previous reported WS2 photodetectors.14,19,26,27 Such fast speed can be attributed to the rapid carrier separation at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface and efficient carrier transport by the SSs of Bi2Te3.35 In addition, it supports the dangling-bond-free WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface and high crystalline quality of Bi2Te3 and WS2.

Fig. 3 presents the photoswitching curves of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector under periodic illumination. The wavelengths of the illumination cover from the ultraviolet to near-infrared, which includes (a) 370, (b) 447, (c) 532, (d) 808, (e) 1064 and (f) 1550 nm. In all illumination cases, the device yields an obvious photocurrent and exhibits good reproducibility. Therefore, a broadband photoresponse of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector is demonstrated. Note that the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector can respond to the 1550 nm illumination, whose photon energy is far below the bandgap of WS2. Obviously, such a broad responsive range outperforms the traditional vdWM photodetectors.9,17,38,45 This result is of great significance because the 1550 nm wavelength is widely used in optical communication applications. In a previous work, Wang et al. also extended the responsive range of MoS2 photodetectors by extracting hot electrons generated from Au surface plasmon decay.52 However, the absorption of the plasmon-assisted device is seriously limited by the resonance wavelength of the Au nanostructures. In addition, the photoswitching stability is rather poor. In contrast, the Bi2Te3 possesses an ultra-broad absorption range on account of its Dirac-like SSs.34 It acts as the dominant optically active material under illumination with a photon energy below the bandgap of WS2 (i.e., hν < 1.2 eV), which is discussed in detail below.
 Fig. 3  Broadband photodetection of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector. Photoswitching behavior under illuminations with wavelengths of (a) 370 nm, 6 mW cm−2, (b) 447 nm, 24 mW cm−2, (c) 532 nm, 19 mW cm−2, (d) 808 nm, 34 mW cm−2, (e) 1064 nm, 32 mW cm−2 and (f) 1550 nm, 135 mW cm−2. Source–drain voltage: 1 V. 
Then, the output characteristics of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetectors were systematically investigated. Fig. 4(a) presents the photoswitching curves under different incident power densities. In all illumination cases, the device yields definite photoswitching behavior. Fig. 4(b) presents the power dependent photocurrent of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetectors with different Bi2Te3 thicknesses. There are two main features. First, in all illumination cases, the photocurrent exhibits a positive dependence on the incident power density on account of the increase in the number of photogenerated carriers. Second, after the passivation of the SiO2 interface by the c-axis-oriented Bi2Te3, the photocurrent is greatly enhanced. The photocurrent increases first and then saturates as the thickness of Bi2Te3 increases from 0 to 6 nm. Responsivity (R) is an important figure-of-merit defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of the incident light on the effective area. It can be calculated by the following equation , where Ip, P, and A are photocurrent, power density and active area, respectively. Detectivity (D*) is another important figure-of-merit representing the ability of a photodetector to detect weak optical signals. It can be calculated by the following equation D* = A1/2R/(2qId)1/2, where q and Id are elementary charge and dark current, respectively. Fig. 4(c) and (d) presents the corresponding power dependent responsivity and detectivity to Fig. 4(b). In all cases, the responsivity (detectivity) exhibits a negative dependence on the incident power density. In addition, as the thickness of Bi2Te3 increases from 0 to 6 nm, the responsivity increases first and then saturates, while the detectivity increases first and then decreases. In general, the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector achieves the best device performance with a Bi2Te3 thickness of 4 nm considering both the responsivity and detectivity. Fig. 4(e) presents the photoswitching curves of the device under different source–drain voltages. In all cases, the device yields definite photoswitching behavior. Fig. 4(f) presents the voltage dependent photocurrent and responsivity. They both exhibit positive dependence on the source–drain voltage on account of the enhanced efficiency of carrier separation by the external voltage as well as the promoted carrier drift velocity, suggesting good tunability for multifunctional applications. At a source–drain voltage of 3 V, the device achieves a high responsivity of 30.7 A W−1, along with a good detectivity of 2.3 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1. Importantly, these figures-of-merit are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photodetectors (R ∼ 0.5 to 0.85 A W−1, D* ∼ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1),28 suggesting that the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetectors possess great potential for commercial applications. For clear comparison, Table 1 summarizes the important figures-of-merit of the previously reported WS2 photodetectors based on various approaches including CVD,23,47,48 mechanical exfoliation,18,27,45,46 magnetron sputtering (MS),53 PLD19 and laser irradiation annealing (LIA).26 Generally, our device stands out considering the responsivity, detectivity, response time and effective wavelength range.

Then, the physical mechanism for the enhancement of the photodetection performance of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector was qualitatively investigated. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the WS2 grown directly on SiO2 suffers severe substrate disturbances (denoted as blue arrows), which mainly come from the unscreened dangling bonds. These dangling bonds introduce relatively large forces at the heterointerface, which cause severe deformation of the bottom layer of WS2. Thus, there is a large density of defect states (VD), acting as scattering and recombination centers for the photogenerated carriers, as shown in step I of Fig. 5(b). As a result, the carrier lifetime τ is greatly suppressed. In addition, incident light with a photon energy below the bandgap of WS2 (Eg < 1.2 eV) cannot excite the electrons from their conduction band to valence band, as shown in step II of Fig. 5(b). Therefore, the previous WS2 photodetectors are widely reported to suffer relatively low responsivity and limited effective range.45,48 The situation of the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector differs quite a lot. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the Bi2Te3 layer acts as the passivation layer. It screens the disturbances from the dangling bonds of SiO2. Therefore, there is relatively less interaction between the SiO2 and WS2. In addition, the Bi2Te3 is highly c-axis-oriented. That is, its surface is free of dangling bonds. Thus, it did not cause additional disturbances. As a result, the WS2 grown on Bi2Te3 possesses higher crystalline quality than that grown on SiO2 (ESI,† S1). Thus, the defect states VD are greatly suppressed, as shown in Fig. 5(d).

It is to be noted that a different material dominates the photocurrent of the Bi2Te3/WS2 photodetector under illumination with different wavelengths. On one hand, for the illumination with photon energy beyond the band gap of WS2, the upper WS2 layer absorbs the majority of incident light. Thus, the bottom Bi2Te3 layer absorbs much less light. In addition, the smaller bandgap of Bi2Te3 makes its carrier lifetime much shorter than that of WS2. Therefore, WS2 dominates the photocurrent under illumination with photon energy beyond the band gap of WS2. On the other hand, Bi2Te3 can also absorb the incident light with photon energy below the band gap of WS2.34 Therefore, for illumination with wavelength beyond the responsive range of WS2, the upper WS2 layer acts as a relatively transparent window and absorbs little light. Consequently, the incident light irradiates directly on the bottom Bi2Te3 layer and excites electron–hole pairs, as shown in step II of Fig. 5(d). As a result, this greatly broadens the effective range, which is clearly reflected in the absorption spectrum of the pure WS2 film and WS2/Bi2Te3 heterojunction film (ESI,† S4). Therefore, the WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector can respond to 1550 nm illumination, which is far below the band gap of WS2. In addition, the responsivity and detectivity under the 1550 nm illumination (Fig. 3(f)) are calculated to be 1.9 mA W−1 and 2.7 × 107 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively. These figures-of-merit are quite different from those under illumination with photon energy beyond the bandgap of WS2. The large difference between the responsivity and detectivity under beyond- and below-bandgap illumination is also a manifestation of different dominant active materials.
Moreover, on account of the difference of the work function of WS2 (∼4.0 eV)54 and Bi2Te3 (∼4.3 eV),55 electrons diffuse from the former to the latter to keep the Fermi level in alignment as they contact. As a result, a built-in electric field is formed at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface, which points from WS2 to Bi2Te3. Because of the nanoscale thickness of WS2 and Bi2Te3, the photogenerated carriers can easily drift into the built-in electric field, inside which electrons and holes are accelerated in opposite directions and thus quickly separated. According to the band alignment in Fig. 5(d), the holes in WS2 have a tendency to inject into the Bi2Te3 channel, while the electrons remain in the WS2, as shown in step I in Fig. 5(d). The spatial separation of the photogenerated carriers helps to prolong the carrier lifetime. In addition, since the SSs of TI possess relatively high mobility σ,31 the transport of photogenerated carriers becomes more efficient. The photocurrent can be expressed as Ip ∝ στ. Thus, it is greatly enhanced.
As shown in Fig. 5(e), as the thickness of Bi2Te3 increases, the screening effect increases. Therefore, the quality of WS2 increases, which is reflected in the increase in the XRD diffraction peaks (ESI,† S1). In addition, for the Bi2Te3 with a thickness below 6 nm, the bandgap of SSs decreases as the thickness increases, as shown in Fig. 5(f).56 This results in a decrease in carrier effective mass and thus an increase in the effective surface mobility. However, the decrease of the gap in the SSs also facilitates the recombination of photogenerated carriers, as shown in step I in Fig. 5(f). This results in the decrease in carrier lifetime. Therefore, according to Ip ∝ στ, the photocurrent increases and then saturates as the thickness of Bi2Te3 increases from 0 to 6 nm. On the other hand, the increase in the Bi2Te3 thickness also increases the dark current (ESI,† S5). That is, there is a tradeoff between the responsivity and the dark current. Therefore, considering that the detectivity can be expressed as , it increases first and then decreases, with a maximum value at a Bi2Te3 thickness of ca. 4 nm (Fig. 4(d)). In the future, strategies can be developed to address the issue of high dark current. First, the dark current of the semimetallic Bi2Te3 channel can be suppressed by lateral barrier engineering.57 For example, a lateral superlattice thin layer consisting of alternating Bi2Te3 and β-In2Te3 can be exploited to replace the Bi2Te3. In addition, the bandgap of the Bi2Te3 passivation layer can be enlarged by alloying it with materials with a semiconducting bandgap and similar layered hexagonal structure (i.e., beta-In2Se3 or In2Te3), which also contributes to the suppression of the dark current. Importantly, PLD was recently demonstrated to be a facile and effective technology to grow alloy films,44 suggesting its great potential for addressing this issue. Finally, we applied this approach to the MoS2 film. Similar enhancement of the device performance was achieved (ESI,† S6), demonstrating the universality of this interface engineering methodology.
Conclusion
In summary, we have passivated the interface between WS2 and SiO2 by inserting a Bi2Te3 layer via PLD. Comparative measurements of the fabricated WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector have demonstrated its stable and broadband photoresponse from 370 to 1550 nm. Meanwhile, the photocurrent exhibited a positive dependence on both the source–drain voltage and the incident power density, offering good tunability for multi-functional photoelectrical applications. Additionally, the device manifested a high responsivity of 30.7 A W−1, a pronounced detectivity of 2.3 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a short response time of 20 ms, which make the device stand out among the previously reported WS2 photodetectors. In fact, the responsivity and detectivity are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photodetectors (R ∼ 0.5 to 0.85 A W−1, D* ∼ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1). By qualitatively analyzing the band structures, we have attributed the enhanced photodetection performances to the synergistic effect of the passivation of the SiO2 substrate, efficient carrier separation at the WS2/Bi2Te3 heterointerface and excellent carrier transport along the surface channel of Bi2Te3. Accordingly, the excellent performance of the PLD-grown WS2/Bi2Te3 photodetector will launch a significant advance in next-generation photodetection. Additionally, these findings depict a universal scenario for the development of TMD devices in the future.
