    , Accepted 15th December 2014First published on 18th December 2014AbstractTriplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) based up-conversion is a promising strategy for light harvesting the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum with photovoltaic technologies. Here, we present a bi-component system for photon managing via TTA that allows bypassing the classical statistic limit of 2/5 in the singlet generation, achieving a near unitary conversion efficiency. This result is obtained because of the peculiar relative position of the triplet and singlet energy levels of perylene, used as up-converter and emitter. The system shows a record red-to-blue external up-conversion yield of ∼10% under an irradiance of 1 sun.
Solar technologies are the most common and sustainable strategies for the production of carbon-free renewable energy with a significant impact for long-term worldwide growth. However, the efficiency of photovoltaic and photo-catalytic devices for hydrogen production is limited because they exploit only a fraction of the available light.1–5 To also use efficiently the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum, an improved light harvesting can be achieved by the up-conversion (UC) of sub-bandgap photons through different processes that must be effective in light managing at the solar irradiance. At present, this requirement can be fulfilled only by the so-called sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation (sTTA-UC) in multi-component organic systems. Briefly, an up-converting molecule, acceptor/emitter, gives rise to a high-energy delayed fluorescence upon annihilation of its metastable triplet states, which are populated through Dexter energy transfer (ET) from the triplet states of a proper light harvester, donor/sensitizer. In the latter, the triplet states are generated via intersystem crossing (ISC) from singlet states excited by low-energy light absorption.6 After a very fast development, different groups reported sTTA-UC systems with up-conversion yields as high as 20% under an irradiation of few suns. These performances are an order of magnitude better than those achievable with up-converters based on other processes, such as multi-photon absorption or annihilation of rare-earth excited states.7–10 Because sTTA-UC materials were also proven to effectively enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of real PV devices,3,5,11,12 it can possibly become a fundamental building block for the next generation of solar-based devices, with a potential yield enhancement as high as 50% for silicon and organic photovoltaic cells, and even larger for photo-catalytic water splitting cells (+100%).8,13,14
The maximum quantum-yield (QY) of the photon UC is 0.5 because obeying the thermodynamic requirement of 2Ein ≥ Eout, two low-energy (Ein) photons are required to generate one photon with higher energy (Eout). However, in the case of the sTTA-UC, the intrinsic probability that emitting states are effectively generated upon TTA introduces an additional statistic requirement, which decreases the limit QY from 0.5 to 0.2 (see below). Here, we describe, for the first time, an up-converting system in which the statistic limit is bypassed obtaining an internal UC efficiency QYint ∼ 0.5. The external sTTA-UC quantum yield (QYout) is 0.38, limited only by the efficiencies of the sensitizer–emitter ET and of the emitter fluorescence at the employed concentration.
The sTTA-UC yield depends on the product of the efficiencies of all the involved photophysical steps: QYout = 0.5fϕISCϕETϕTTAϕfl = ϕISCϕETϕflQYint,(1)where the pre-factor 0.5 is set by the thermodynamic limit described above. The other parameters are the efficiencies of the sensitizer ISC (ϕISC), the sensitizer–emitter energy transfer (ϕET), the emitter TTA (ϕTTA) and fluorescence (ϕfl). In eqn (1), f represents the probability to obtain a singlet excited state as a result of the annihilation of two triplet states.15 Cheng and co-authors recently introduced a discussion on this parameter. It depends on the electronic properties of the systems that experience bi-molecular excitonic annihilation, and they suggested how it is possible to overcome the spin statistical limit for TTA assisted up-conversion yield.11,16
Indeed, TTA is a two-particle collision process, which results in the generation of excitons with different spin-character according to the statistical combination of the spin of the colliding triplets. TTA reactions are described as follows: (2)
Quintet (Q) states require the simultaneous excitation of two electrons and are energetically unattainable. On the contrary, usually E(T2) < E(2T1) + kBT and E(S1) < E(2T1) + kBT allowing the intermediate collision complex to generate either a singlet excited state S1 or one of the three degenerate high-energy T2 triplet states with a statistical ratio of 1:3. The resulting T2 states quickly decay back to T1, becoming again available for further annihilations (see Fig. 1a). Therefore, upon collision of four triplet exciton pairs, five triplets are destroyed, but only two of them give a singlet, which sets f = 2/5. However, if E(T2) > E(2T1) + kBT, not only the formation of a quintet state, but also that of high-energy triplets is prevented. In this case, only singlet excitons can be formed upon TTA; thus, f = 1 (see Fig. 1b). The latter condition is the fundamental requirement to bypass the statistical limit and to reach a maximum QYint = 0.5.11,16
 Fig. 1  Sketch of the TTA process involving four triplet pairs. In the case (a), where T2 levels are energetically accessible, the collision of four triplet pairs destroys five triplets. Only two dead triplets produce a singlet excited state; therefore, f = 2/5 = 0.4 with a predicted maximum QYint = 0.2 (eqn (1)). In case (b), where the T2 level is not energetically accessible, the collision of four triplet pairs produces four singlet excited states. Thus, f = 8/8 = 1, with a predicted maximum QYint = 0.5. 
The emitters commonly used in the sTTA-UC are rigid polyacenes. They possess a large fluorescence yield (ϕfl ∼ 1) and long-living metastable triplets suitable for TTA. As sensitizers, metallated porphyrins show the best performance. They have a strong absorption cross-section because of the conjugated porphyrinic ring and fast ISC enhanced by the presence of the central metal atom, which gives ϕISC = 1.17,18 Therefore, by using the properly paired chromophores of these families, we can avoid energy losses by unwanted non-radiative processes. Of course, the lowest excited state of the sensitizer must be resonant with the T1 level of the emitter to allow the Dexter ET. If this requirement is satisfied, ϕET can be easily optimized by changing the emitter concentration (CE). To demonstrate the possibility of overcoming the sTTA-UC statistical limit, we selected an emitter from the polyacene family the perylene (PY).19,20 PY is the ideal molecule for this purpose because its ϕfl is 0.96 in diluted solution; the T1 ↔ S0 transition is strictly forbidden implying a T1 natural lifetime in the range of 5 ms, and in particular E(T2) ∼ 4.0 eV is considerably larger than twice E(T1) ∼ 1.51 eV.21–23 With regards to the sensitizer, we choose palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdPh4TBP), a near-infrared emitting phosphor with ϕISC = 1 and a strong phosphorescence at 1.56 eV, not far from the T1 state of PY. Moreover, the broad PY photoluminescence ranging from about 2.40 and 2.80 eV falls mainly in the transparency window of PdPh4TBP delimited by the β- and the Q-absorption bands at 2.81 and 1.96 eV. Very similar systems have been previously employed by Singh-Rachford and Castellano to achieve red-to-blue sTTA-UC achieving good results for the conversion yield.24
The spectroscopy study was performed by dissolving both the dyes in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a fixed concentration of PdPh4TBP (10−5 M) and by varying that of PY from 10−3 M to 10−6 M. Absorption measurements were done with a Cary 50 spectrometer. Photoluminescence signals were recorded by a nitrogen-cooled CCD coupled with a spectrograph Triax-190 instrument (Horiba Jobin-Yvon) with a spectral resolution of 15 nm. As excitation source, a Roithner solid-state laser diode RLTMRL-635-100-5 at 1.95 eV (635 nm) was generally used. Only for the photoluminescence QY measurements this laser was replaced with the second harmonic of a Ti:sapphire laser at 3.26 eV (380 nm). QYout and PY ϕfl has been determined by relative photoluminescence intensity measurements using phthalocyanine in 1-chloronaphthalene as a standard (see ESI† for details).21 All the samples were prepared using anhydrous solvents, and were sealed in a glove box in quartz cuvettes with an optical path d = 0.1 cm to prevent oxygen quenching. Chemicals were received from Sigma Aldrich and used without any further treatment.

Fig. 2 reports the molecular structure with the relevant energy levels of the employed chromophores (upper panel), and the absorption/emission spectra of PY and PdPh4TBP (lower panel). Numbered arrows outline the energy flow in the sTTA-UC process. The sensitizer absorbs light at Ein = 1.95 eV (1) and then experiences a fast ISC that populates its triplet state at 1.55 eV (2). PY triplets are excited by Dexter energy transfer from donors (3) and experience TTA (4); thus, generating fluorescence singlets at Eout = 2.61 eV (5). The overall photon-energy gain is ΔE = (Eout − Ein) = 0.66 eV. In the case of the samples at low PY concentration, the photophysics remains the same, but the up-converted emission slightly shifts to higher energy as described in the ESI.†Fig. 3 reports the measured QYout plotted vs. the excitation power density (Iexc) in a log–log scale for samples with different CE. The QYout data have been corrected neither for the PY self-absorption nor for the PdPh4TBP re-absorption. These two effects play a minor role in determining the performances of the systems and are discussed in detail in the ESI.† Here, we outline that this is considerably a conservative approach because the inclusion of the above-mentioned effects results in performances even better than the reported ones. For all the samples at low excitation power, QYout is below 1% because the density of PY triplet states is too low to have any efficient annihilation as the spontaneous non-radiative decay is the main triplet de-excitation channel. By raising the exciting radiant flux, we observe a corresponding QYout increase up to a constant value. This is reached when the TTA becomes the dominant deactivation channel for the metastable triplets.22 In some cases, i.e., for the samples with CE = 10−5 M and in particular CE = 10−6 M, the regime in which QYout is independent of excitation power is followed by a strong decrease of the conversion yield. This is due to the saturation of the number of acceptors available for the ET occurring when Iexc is so large that a non-negligible fraction of the emitters is in an excited state.25

The inset shows the sTTA-UC emission of a THF solution (10−5 M/10−4 M) under broad excitation by a filtered white lamp. The dashed vertical line indicates the amount of photons absorbed under 1 sun of irradiance by considering the sensitizer absorption at the concentration of 10−5 M used in the experiment. 
We first studied the sample with CE = 10−3 M, the maximum concentration of emitter soluble in THF (Fig. 3, circles). The regime in which the conversion yield assumes a constant value is reached for Iexc > 1016 ph cm−2 s−1. Here, we measure QYout = 0.33. The singlet generation efficiency upon TTA can now be evaluated from eqn (1) by considering the following factors: (i) donor ϕISC is 1, because in PdPh4TBP, there is no detectable fluorescence from the absorbing S1 state.26 (ii) ϕTTA is 1, because we are considering the irradiance range in which QYout is independent from Iexc, i.e., in which all the triplet states decay by annihilation. (iii) Because of the large CE concentration, ϕET = 1, as demonstrated by ET efficiency measurements (ESI,† Fig. S2). (iv) The ϕfl of PY at this concentration is only 0.65 because of the concentration quenching effect at the selected CE (see ESI,† Fig. S1).27,28 As a matter of fact, PY fluorescence efficiency is the only bottleneck for the conversion yield in the investigated system. With these values, eqn (1) gives QYint = QYout(ϕETϕfl)−1 = 0.49, or equivalently f = 1. This demonstrates for the first time that the thermodynamic upper limit of photon up-conversion yield by TTA is reached. The overall sTTA-UC efficiency can be increased by optimizing the system composition by decreasing the emitter concentration to as low as CE = 10−4 M to limit the concentration quenching of ϕfl (Fig. 3, dots). In such a way, ϕfl = 0.80, and CE is still sufficiently high to obtain ϕET = 0.97 (ESI,† Fig. S1). The measured QYout = 0.38 is, to our knowledge, the highest value observed for photon sTTA-UC. Moreover, by eqn (1), the calculated QYint = 0.50 confirms an f value of 1. Additional reductions of CE allow the further reduction of the emitter fluorescence quenching, but limit the ET efficiency, and as a consequence of the described saturation effect, hinder the correct evaluation of f. In the system with CE = 10−5 M, from one side ϕfl increases up to 0.91 ± 0.04 but from the other one, the corresponding ϕET decreases to 0.47, and the maximum measured sTTA-UC efficiency decreases to 0.18. In this case, eqn (1) gives QYin = 0.42, which corresponds to f = 0.8. This suggests that the ET saturation at high excitation intensities prevents reaching the maximum achievable QYout giving an unreliable value of f. This is confirmed by the data collected for the sample with the smallest CE = 10−6 M that shows a dramatic decrease of QYout well before its saturation value is reached. Table 1 summarizes the relevant parameters for all the investigated samples measured at Iexc = 8 × 1017 ph cm−2 s−1 (250 mW cm−2). In the inset of Fig. 3, an image of the bright blue emission of the sample PdPh4TBP/PY (10−5 M/10−4 M) excited with a white lamp passing through a 520 nm long-pass optical filter demonstrates the high efficiency of sTTA-UC in our system. For this sample, it should be outlined that even if an excitation power density larger than the solar irradiance is necessary to attain its maximum efficiency, the QYout achievable by absorbing a number of photons equal to that provided by the solar irradiance at the A.M. 1.5 condition (Fig. 3, dashed vertical line) is as large as ∼10%.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the thermodynamic upper limit of ∼50% in photon up-conversion yield has been demonstrated for a sTTA-UC system using an acceptor/emitter dye pair with suitable triplet and singlet energy levels. When the condition E(S1) < E(2T1) + kBT < E(T2) is satisfied, the singlet generation by TTA is maximized, and the QYout is only limited by the emitter fluorescence efficiency, and/or by the sensitizer-to-emitter energy transfer yield. Our findings demonstrate that by a proper selection of chromophores, it is possible to have up-conversion yields not only at low irradiance,20,29,30 but also without photon losses, exactly as in the case of non-linear optic materials when they operate with coherent radiation at excitation power densities of MW or GW per square centimetre. Because of this record performance, the presented sTTA-UC system shows an up-conversion efficiency of 10% under 1 sun of irradiance, demonstrating the potential application of these materials in photovoltaic and photo-catalytic technologies.
