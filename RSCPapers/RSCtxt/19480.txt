    , Accepted 18th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractThe reduction of CO2 into C1 feedstocks (e.g., CO) by utilizing solar energy has attracted increasing attention for the efficient production of renewable energy. However, a significant challenge in the reduction of CO2 is achieving high conversion efficiency due to the high CO dissociation energy of CO2 and difficultly in accessing the surface of photocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst with hydroxyethyl groups grafted on its edge via a facile bottom-up strategy, facilitating the efficient surface absorption of CO2 and lowering the CO2 transformation energy barrier; this was accompanied with exceptional extended optical absorption ability to the near-infrared region and increase in the density of states at the Fermi level. Thus, concentrated CO2 molecules could contact the surface of PCN and be easily activated; this resulted in an excellent CO production rate of up to 209.24 μmol h−1 g−1 in the modified PCN (i.e., 39.5-fold increase compared to that of pristine PCN) and a selectivity of 98.5% under white LED illumination, exceeding that of most PCN-based energy conversion systems reported to date. Notably, this PCN matrix also exhibited photocatalytic activity for the production of CO in the near-infrared region from 780 to 850 nm. These results pave the way for the development of structured photocatalysts with easy accessibility for CO2 and broadband spectral response for the efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
1. Introduction
The conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical fuels via solar-driven photocatalysis is one of the most attractive routes for addressing the issue of global warming and the production of renewable energy.1–4 Thus, numerous photocatalysts have been applied for the conversion of CO2 in the previous decade, including metal oxides (TiO2, WO3, and ZnO),5–9 metal chalcogenides (CdS),10–12 layered double hydroxides,13 metal–organic frameworks14,15 and layered Bi-based semiconductors.16,17 However, the efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 remains unsatisfactory owing to the high activation energy barrier of CO2 (i.e., high CO dissociation energy of 750 kJ mol−1 in the CO2 molecule), relatively low selectivity due to multiple electron transfer steps to produce a variety of products, and the sluggish kinetics of CO2 absorption and mass transfer. This requires favorable CO2 absorption, easy activation, and sufficient excited electron and proton transfer to facilitate the subsequent CO2 reduction process.18,19 According to the intense studies on photocatalysts, porous layered materials with a high surface area via some modifications may be candidates as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2.20 In this case, visible light-driven polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has drawn significant attention21–24 due to its layered structure, chemical stability, and low cost; however, the CO2 reduction rate by pristine PCN is far from satisfactory.
Pioneering studies have revealed an enhancement in CO2 photocatalytic efficiency by combining PCN with other semiconductors25–27 to facilitate the separation of photo-induced charge carriers. The incorporation of modulated complex cocatalysts such as iron quaterpyridine, cobalt phthalocyanine and binuclear ruthenium(II) complexes in the PCN matrix can achieve similar elevated activity.28–31 Grafting a hydrophobic polymer in the PCN surface to overcome the mass transfer limitation of CO2 resulted in enhanced CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.32 However, attempts on the basal plane activation of the PCN matrix remain scarce, where the lack of sufficient active sites on the surface of the catalyst and altered redox ability hamper the long-term applications of the above PCN-coupled systems. Thus, the introduction of surface defects becomes increasingly important because they help to tune the chemical and electronic structures of the PCN matrix, generating more active sites and lowering the activation energy of CO2.33 Generating carbon vacancies in the PCN matrix provides long-lived photo-generated charges and enhanced reaction kinetics, which can be achieved via a steam-etching approach;34 however, this requires harsh conditions and breakage of the long-range order of the material. On the other hand, considering the surface termination of the incomplete cyclization of heptazines, residual NH2/NH may also serve as real active sites, but led to difficulty in activating CO2 and poor charge carrier transport.35–38 The replacement of terminal amino groups by cyano groups in the solvothermal process can lead to enhanced activity towards CO2 reduction.39 Nonetheless, this modification only allows a weak optical response absorption region (<500 nm) and insufficient selectivity, severely inhibiting the broadband, solar spectrum-utilization efficiency for the target product.40,41 More importantly, although improved activity has been generally achieved by the reported works, little has been done to optimize the CO2 absorption kinetics and reduce the CO2 transformation energy barriers. Although rarely reported, it has been evidenced that introducing coordination molecule linkers in the edge of the structural unit of a material (e.g. homogeneous transition photoredox catalysts42 and metal–organic frameworks43) can change the rate-determining step, modulate its intrinsic affinity and engineer its electronic structure. Accordingly, the covalent multi-step polymerization processes of cyanamide derivatives during the synthesis of PCN allow nucleophilic addition reaction with some electron-rich motifs. These observations indicate that some functional organic linkers can be introduced in the structural units in PCN via a facile bottom-up strategy to modulate its reaction kinetics for CO2 conversion, which has not been achieved to date.
Thus considering the abovementioned facts, we elaborately designed hydroxyethyl-functionalized one-dimensional PCN nanostructures by applying an organic amine catalyst (e.g., N-acetylethanolamine, NA) in the hydrothermal pretreatment synthetic procedure and then the calcination process. Combining a set of systematic experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified that the replacement of the terminal amino groups by hydroxyethyl groups caused by the addition of NA drastically facilitated the absorption capability of the material for CO2 molecules and reduce the CO2 transformation energy barrier. Also, the presence of hydroxyethyl groups enhanced the optical absorption capability of the PCN matrix to the near-infrared region due to the optimized electronic structure and promoted photogenerated charge separation. This led to a remarkable CO production rate of 209.42 μmol h−1 g−1 (∼39.5-fold increase compared to that of pristine PCN) together with a selectivity of 98.5% for the NA-modified PCN catalyst and an apparent quantum efficiency of 5.26% at λ = 420 nm for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, together with extended response activity in the near-infrared region.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample synthesis
The HCNT–NA was prepared via the following process. Briefly, 3 g of dicyandiamide (DCDA) was added to a 15 mL mixture solution containing 5 mL deionized water and 10 mL propanol, then followed by the addition of 0.15 mL N-acetylethanolamine (NA) and stirred for 30 min. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave (Teflon-lined) and heated at 180 °C for 10 h.44 After natural cooling, the obtained precipitate was washed with water and ethanol several times, followed by drying at 80 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven. Finally, the intermediate solids were heated to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept for 4 h under a static air atmosphere using a Nabertherm GmbH muffle furnace to obtain the polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) sample, named HCNT–NA. Also, g-C3N4 samples with different contents of NA, such as 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 mL, were also prepared, which were denoted as HCNT–NA1, HCNT–NA2, HCNT–NA3, and HCNT–NA4, respectively. The process for varying the chemical structure of the synthesized HCNT–NA is illustrated in Schemes S1 and S2.† For comparison, HCN–NA and HCNT were prepared without added propanol and NA under the same conditions, respectively. Also, a bulk PCN sample (denoted as BCN) was synthesized from DCDA via direct calcination in a muffle furnace at 550 °C/4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, according to the previous reports, and the chemical structure variation with an increase in temperature is illustrated in Scheme S3.†
To illustrate the versatility of this modulated synthetic method, several other additives were selected including ethylene glycol (EG), ethylenediamine (EDA), ethanolamine (EOA), diethanolamine (DOA), and triethanolamine (TOA) to react with the precursor. Typically, 0.10 mL additive was added to 25 mL aqueous suspension containing 3 g DCDA to dissolve completely, and then hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 10 h. After dying the obtained intermediate solids, they were continuously heated at 550 °C 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The resultant CN-based samples were denoted as HCN–EG, HCN–EDA, HCN–EOA, HCN–DOA, and HCN–TOA, respectively. The structures of the selected additives together with that of N-acetylethanolamine (NA) are shown in Scheme S4.† Similar to the synthetic process of HCNT–NA, we also selected three additives including EOA, DOA, and TOA (0.15 mL) to prepare HCNT–EOA, HCNT–DOA, and HCNT–TOA, respectively.
2.2. General information for characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and valence band-XPS were performed using a Kratos Axis Ulra DLD spectrometer with charge neutralization equipped with a monochromatic Mg Kα X-ray source. The samples were pressed onto a silicon foil and referenced with the adventitious carbon C 1s peak at 284.90 eV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker Vector 33. Magic-angle spinning solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on an Agilent VNMRS 600 MHz magnetic resonance spectrometer. CNHO elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario MICRO analyzer. The morphologies and texturization of the samples were investigated by applying a Hitachi SU8220 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and JEM-2100 JEOL transmission electron microscope (TEM, 200 kV). The roughness of the surface over the working electrode was measured using a Bruker Multimode 8. Surface areas were measured according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory from the N2 absorption–desorption isotherms using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus at 77 K and CO2 absorption curve at 298 K. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Shimadzu U-3010 spectrophotometer and referenced to BaSO4. Static photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra (375 nm excitation) were acquired with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature.
For femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TA), the fundamental output from a Yb: KGW laser (1030 nm, 220 fs Gaussian fit, 100 kHz, Light Conversion Ltd) was separated to multiple light beams. One was introduced to a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier and a second harmonic generation crystal BBO to generate a certain wavelength for the pump beam (here we use 400 nm). The other was focused on a BBO crystal to generate 515 nm pulses and then focused on a YAG crystal to generate continuum blue light as a probe beam. The temporal delay between them was controlled via a motorized delay stage. The pump and probe pulses overlapped spatially in the sample and the transmitted probe light was collected by a linear array detector.

In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS 50 with an in situ Harrick IR cell. The in situ FTIR experiment was performed on a Bruker Tensor II FTIR spectrometer. Firstly, the samples were sealed in the specimen chamber, then, 40 mL min−1 pure CO2 was flowed into the specimen chamber, which carried 10% TOA/acetonitrile aqueous solution with a certain amount of [Co(bpy)2] Cl2·6H2O (bpy = 2′2-bipyridine) to simulate the CO2 photoreduction reaction condition. After 30 min, the specimen chamber-loaded samples were irradiated from the SiO2 window with an Xe lamp for 1 h and infrared absorbance spectra were recorded every 10 min.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation equipped with a standard three-electrode system, with a Pt plate as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) as the reference electrode. The preparation of the working electrode was as follows: firstly, acetone and ethanol were used to clean the F-doped thin oxide (FTO) glass, and then the obtained samples (10 mg) was added into 1 mL ethanol solution with 20 μL of 5% Nafion, and sonicated for 30 min to form a homogeneous slurry. Then the slurry was transferred onto the FTO glass by dipping to achieve a 1 × 1 cm2 active region, followed by heating at 150 °C for 2 h. The supporting electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 6.8), and 0.2 M NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 served as the buffer solution. A 300 W Xe-lamp (Beijing ProfectLight, Microsolar300) with a 420 nm cutoff filter was applied as the incident visible light source. The photocurrent–time response (I–t) was measured in the dark and under light irradiation by chopping from a 300 W Xe lamp at a bias potential of −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Moreover, the I–t curves were also measured using different monochromatic wavelength light sources of 420 nm, 450 nm, 535 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 730 nm, 765 nm and 810 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl over the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz in the dark. Mott–Schottky plots were measured using the frequency of the AC potential at 3000, 4000 and 5000 Hz. The carrier concentration was calculated using eqn (1)2 as follows: (1)where e is the elemental charge: 1.6 × 10−19 C, A is the active area of the working electrode, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum: 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1, and ε is the relative permittivity of the material, which is 5.5 for C3N4. The value of kT/e is too low, and thus it is generally ignored.
2.4. Evaluation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction was monitored using a Beijing ProfectLight PCX-50C photochemical reaction device equipped with a 5 W white LED lamp. Typically, 50 mg catalyst, 1 μmol CoCl2, and 15 mg 2,2-bipyridine were added to 3 mL 10% TOA/acetonitrile solution with 0.5 mL H2O and ultrasonically dispersed for 15 min. The reactor was degassed three times to vent air and filled with high purity CO2 gas (99.999%). Then the reactor was illuminated under a white LED lamp. The gaseous components (CO and CH4) were monitored by an FID detector equipped with a mechanizer by gas chromatography and the generation of H2 was simultaneously detected by a TCD detector. Note that the role of the mechanizer was to convert CO to CH4 for FID analysis. The liquid products were also detected by the FID detector after reaction upon injecting 10 μL sample, but no product was observed in this work. The reaction temperature was controlled at 26 °C using a liquid cooling system. The isotopic label experiments reaction was conducted under the same conditions mentioned above and illuminated for 4 h under a white LED lamp. The generated 13CO gas was analyzed using an Agilent gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, 7890 A, and 5975 C).
For the recycling tests. 50 mg catalyst, 1 μmol CoCl2, and 15 mg 2,2-bipyridine was added to 3 mL 10% TOA/acetonitrile solution with 0.5 mL H2O, purged with pure CO2, and irradiated with a white LED lamp. After 4 h, the catalyst was collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min, washed with acetonitrile and ethanol, and after drying, redispersed in fresh TOA/acetonitrile solution with the sample irradiated for 4 h again for 3 subsequent recycling runs.
2.5. Calculation of apparent quantum efficiency (AQE)
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was evaluated using a ProfectLight PCX50B under the illumination of a 5 W LED lamp. The monochromatic light was set at different wavelengths of 385 nm, 420 nm, 465 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm, 595 nm, 630 nm, 730 nm, 785 nm, 810, and 840 nm. Note that the latter three monochromatic light sources of 785 nm, 810, and 840 nm belong to the near-infrared region. The generated CO was collected after the light irradiation lasted for 4 h. AQE under the different wavelengths were calculated using the following equation: (2)
The number of CO molecules was calculated from the moles of CO, where the generation rate of CO under 420 nm was 5.646 μmol h−1 and Avogadro's number (6.022 × 1023). Thus, the number of electrons received from the product is 2 × 5.646 × 10−6/3600 = 3.114 × 10−9 mol s−1.
The energy of a single photon at λ = 420 nm was calculated to be 4.736 × 10−19 J, according to hc/λ, where h and c are Planck's constant and the speed of light, respectively. The light intensity was measured to be 3.44 mW cm−2 by calibrating with a light power meter (PL-MW2000). The diameter of the illumination window of the reactor was 2.5 cm, and consequently the irradiation area was calculated to be 4.91 cm2. Thus, the total number of incident photons was calculated to be 5.924 × 10−8 mol s−1. Accordingly, AQE = 3.114 × 10−9 mol s−1/5.924 × 10−8 mol s−1 × 100% = 5.26%.
2.6. Calculation of turnover number (TON)
The turnover number (TON) over Co(bpy)2/HCNT–NA was calculated using the following equation: (3)
Moles of evolved product gas: herein, only CO and H2 were detected as the products of CO2 reduction. By using 50 mg Co(bpy)2/HCNT–NA catalyst, the photocatalytic activity remained relatively stable during 8 h. After the reaction for 8 h, the amount of CO and H2 was detected to be 83.70 μmol and 0.26 μmol, respectively. Moles of active components on photocatalyst: the amount of CoCl2 added was 1 μmol for 50 mg HCNT–NA. Thus, TON= (83.70 + 0.26) μmol/1 μmol = 83.96, which is obviously large, demonstrating the catalytic nature of this CO2 reduction reaction by using HCNT–NA.
2.7. DFT calculations
DFT calculations were performed in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). A spin-polarized GGA PBE functional, all-electron plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 400 eV, and a projector augmented wave (PAW) method were adopted. g-C3N4 was simulated using a surface model of p (2 × 2) unit cell periodicity. A (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst–Pack mesh was used for sampling of the Brillouin zone integrations. A 15 Å vacuum layer was added to avoid interaction between adjacent layers. The electronic density of states (DOS) of (2 × 2) supercells were calculated using a higher 9 × 9 × 1 k-point mesh. The conjugate gradient algorithm was used in the optimization. The convergence threshold was set at 1 × 10−4 eV in total energy and 0.05 eV Å−1 in force on each atom. The adsorption energy change (ΔEabs) was determined as follows:ΔEabs = Etotal − Esur − Emolwhere Etotal is the total energy for the adsorption state, Esur is the energy of the pure surface, and Emol is the energy of the molecule.
The free energy change (ΔG) for adsorption was determined as follows:ΔG = Etotal − Esur + ΔEZPE − TΔSwhere Etotal is the total energy for the adsorption state, Esur is the energy of the pure surface, ΔEZPE is the zero-point energy change and ΔS is the entropy change.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the PCN-based photocatalyst involved two steps, a hydrothermal pretreatment to form a melamine–cyanaurate complex, followed by thermal condensation to obtain NA-modified holey PCN microtubes (HCNT–NA, Fig. 1a). Hydroxyethyl groups were grafted at the edge of the heptazine motifs through in situ replacement of the NH/NH2 groups by nucleophilic addition with the precursor during hydrothermal pretreatment in a water/propanol mixture (proposed reaction mechanism is illustrated in Scheme S1, ESI†). We also synthesized a series of control samples, as illustrated in Schemes S2 and S3,† including bulk PCN (BCN), holey PCN microtubes (HCNT) and NA-modified holey PCN nanosheets (HCN–NA).

The detailed characterization of the structural change of the pristine and modified PCN is provided in Fig. 1b, c, S1, and Table S1.† All the PCN samples showed two similar diffraction peaks (Fig. S1†), reflecting the periodic packing of the in-plane heptazine motifs and the interlayer stacking of the lamellar structure, which are indexed to the (100) and (002) lattice faces, respectively.45,46 The chemically tailored PCN (HCNT–NA) exhibited a slight left shift for the both (002) peak and (100) peak compared to that of its BCN counterpart due to the distorted heptazine motifs and enlarged layered spacing by the grafted hydroxyethyl groups and formation of 1D tube structure.47 The much higher BET specific surface area of HCNT–NA (73.3 m2 g−1versus 9.5 m2 g−1 of BCN) was verified by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. S2†) due to the introduction of well-defined mesopores.48
The successful grafting of hydroxyethyl on the PCN matrix was confirmed by solid-state 13C magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR, as shown in Fig. 1b. The spectrum of HCNT–NA shows two characteristic peaks at 154.9 and 164.8 ppm, corresponding to C–(N)3 (1) and NH2–C(N)2 (2) in the heptazine motifs, respectively, and is slightly left-shifted compared to that of BCN.49,50 The peak ratio (I1/I2) gradually increased with the incorporation of NA due to the replacement of NH2–C(N)2 by the hydroxyethyl group (see detailed model structure in Fig. S5†). This is reflected by the two additional peaks at 136.4 and 189.5 ppm in HCNT–NA from the C–C–OH (3) and aromatic ring-C–C (4) in the hydroxyethyl group,51,52 respectively, as confirmed in previous work, indicating the successful introduction of diethylamino groups in the heptazine derivatives.53,54
Further evidence of the edge-functionalization is provided by the high-resolution XPS N1s spectra in Fig. 1c and S4,† where certain shifts in the peaks for the C–NC, N–(C)3 and C–N–H species can be observed in HCNT–NA and HCN–NA relative to that in BCN.55 It is recognized that the C–N heterocycles have strong polarity, where the hydroxyethyl groups serve as electron donors to enhance the π-conjugated, electron-rich system, resulting in positive shifts in the escape energy of the surface electrons (binding energy in XPS).56,57 A similar observation can be found in the XPS C1s spectra in Fig. S3.† The binding energy of N–CN in HCNT–NA, indexed to the in-plane hybridized carbon of the C–N heterocycles, is slightly higher than that of BCN.45,58 Although we also acquired the FTIR spectra in Fig. S1,† the hydroxyethyl group is hard to distinguish from the overlapping –NH2/OH groups in the region of 3200–3500 cm−1 and the C–N heterocycles in the region of 1200–1700 cm−1.21,46 The higher C/N ratio and higher O percentage in HCNT–NA according to the elemental analysis in Table S1† also confirm the installation of hydroxyethyl groups in the PCN matrix.
3.2. Morphological characterization
Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively) were used to observe the morphology of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1d, the intermediate compound of HCNT–NA after hydrothermal treatment of dicyandiamide (DCDA) with NA had a well-ordered, pillar-like morphology with a diameter in the range of 2–3 μm, which is distinct from the large, irregular particles of the DCDA precursor in Fig. S6.† This is attributed to the transformation into a modified melamine–cyanaurate complex (see Fig. S7 and S8† for XRD and FTIR, respectively) via the liquid–liquid supramolecular self-assembly process during the hydrothermal treatment.59,60 The modified PCN samples (HCNT–NA) maintained their 1D hexagonal pillar structure (Fig. 1e) after calcination due to the thermal stability of the intermediate compounds, despite volume shrinkage by the release of NH3 and H2O. The SEM images at higher magnifications further reveal the packing of leaf-like nanostructures to form the hexagonal entity (Fig. 1f), where vertically aligned nanoarrays are observed on the surface (Fig. 1g), which formed the spatial potential difference to boost the directional charge transfer and the absorption of CO2.61 This unique mesoporous structure with hollow microchannels within the individual “leaf” provides sufficient active sites for the activation of CO2 and facilitates the mass transfer of reactants.36,61 Further details of the microstructure are displayed in the TEM images in Fig. 1h–l. The 1D porous network is comprised of regularly packed 2D nanosheets with a uniform dimension and well-ordered highly crystalline domain. The bright diffraction patterns in the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) indicate the relatively high crystallinity of HCNT–NA, where NA is critical for the formation of high-quality crystals (see the difference in the SAED patterns for HCN–NA and HCNT in Fig. S10†). This ordered packing configuration is beneficial for the rapid transfer of photo-induced carriers and extended optical absorption.62–65 The STEM-EDS mapping also confirmed the uniform distribution of C, N, and O in HCNT–NA throughout the selected area.
3.3. Optical absorption and band-gap structure
The optical absorption property of the catalysts was investigated via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), as shown in Fig. 2a. Owing to the quantum confinement effect and its high specific surface area, the modified PCN matrix exhibited a slight blue shift in the absorption edge compared to its BCN counterpart.34,66 HCNT–NA showed the highest absorption at λ > 460 nm with extended absorption up to the near-infrared region due to the formation of an intermediate band in the n–π* state transition, increased density of band tail states, and well redistributed localized states (vide infra), resulting in excitation by photons with induced energy lower than the intrinsic band–band transition. Similar results were found in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and band structure (Fig. S11–S13, see the related discussions in Section 4 of the ESI†). The significant extension in optical region response can lead to a higher concentration of excited electrons to facilitate the CO2 conversion rate. XPS valence band (VB) spectra and Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were conducted to elucidate the change in band-edge position. As shown in Fig. 2b, the VB position to the Fermi level shifted positively in HCN–NA (2.16 eV) and HCNT–NA (2.19 eV) compared to that of BCN (1.89 eV).67 For n-type semiconductors, the conduction band (CB) position can be estimated from the flat potential (0.1–0.2 V lower than CB) by extrapolating the x-axis intercept in the M–S plot.68,69 As depicted in Fig. 2c, the flat potential of HCNT–NA is obviously less negative than that of BCN (−1.20 versus −1.53 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Importantly, HCNT–NA also has a lower slope in the M–S plots, demonstrating its higher donor carrier density than BCN (1.88 × 1021versus 7.38 × 1020, calculation process shown at the bottom of Fig. S15†). This 2.55-fold increase in carrier donor density is beneficial for the subsequent photocatalytic reduction process.64 Based on the above results, the band diagrams of HCNT–NA and BCN are proposed in Fig. 2d.

(c) Mott–Schottky plots over different frequencies of 3000, 4000, 5000 Hz in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer electrolyte of BCN and HCNT–NA. (d) Relative band alignments of HCNT–NA and BCN. Total and partial density of states over (e) CN (BCN) and (f) CN–NA (HCNT–NA). 
To reveal the critical role of the hydroxyethyl groups in the modification of the electronic structure, density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the total and partial density of states (PDOS) of the catalysts were performed, as shown in Fig. 2e and f (see DFT models in Fig. S16†). After installation of the hydroxyethyl groups on the tri-s-triazine units, the CB and VB positions of PCN–NA shifted downwards together with a smaller bandgap than that of pristine PCN, in good accordance with the XPS-VB and M–S observations. The appearance of an intermediate band from the C2p and N2p orbitals in PCN–NA agrees with the extended absorption tail along the optical region,35,70 leading to a significant decrease in the electron transportation distance for photo-generated carriers.40 Note that the formation of intermediate band states may also occur due to the well-ordered high-crystalline structure in HCNT–NA, but this is difficult to quantitate.64 The density of states along the Fermi level also significantly increased, which is ascribed to the redistributed localized electronic states below the CBM, suggesting a higher concentration of charge carriers.71 This high density of localized states associated with the band tail states further contribute to the absorption extension into the optical region. Additionally, the transient-state photocurrent in Fig. S17† manifests a high carrier separation efficiency in HCNT–NA due to the modulation in its electronic structure after the installation of hydroxyethyl groups. This extended absorption ability, intensive concentration of charge carrier and promoted charge separation allow efficient activation of CO2 on HCNT–NA under visible light.
3.4. Photocatalytic activity evaluation and mechanism analysis
We examined the photocatalytic efficiency of the PCN-based catalysts for CO2 reduction under a 5 W white LED lamp with a Co complex as a cocatalyst and triethanolamine (TOA) as the electron donor (reaction setup shown in Fig. S18†). As shown in Fig. 3a, BCN exhibited an unsatisfactory CO production rate of 5.29 μmol h−1 g−1 owing to its inert surface for CO2 activation. Self-assembly into PCN microtubes led to a moderate improvement to 43.91 μmol h−1 g−1 for HCNT. Surprisingly, the incorporation of NA into the PCN matrix dramatically boosted the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where a 24.4- and 39.5-fold increase in CO yield (129.08 and 209.24 μmol h−1 g−1) together with a selectivity of ∼97.5% was observed for HCN–NA and HCNT–NA relative to that of BCN, respectively. Considering their similar specific surface areas, edge activation of the inert PCN matrix by NA functionalization should be the main cause for this improvement. This was confirmed by the strong correlation between NA content and CO2 activity in Fig. S19.† The control experiments in Fig. S20–S23† reveal that the catalyst, cocatalyst, TOA, light source, and CO2 gas are all essential for this reduction reaction. The PCN catalyst serves as the photocatalyst and the Co complex as the cocatalyst. Under white light illumination, the excited electrons from PCN transfer to the Co complex. The 13C isotopic experiments in the inset of Fig. 3b confirm that the generated 13CO gas at m/z = 29 in the mass spectrum originated from the used 13CO2. HCNT–NA also exhibited excellent cycling stability for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where no obvious change in its structure and morphology could be found via the XRD and FTIR even after 4 cycles (Fig. S24 and S25,† respectively).

(b) Apparent quantum efficiency of HCNT–NA (irradiated by LED lamps with different monochromatic wavelengths of 385 nm, 420 nm, 465 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm, 595 nm, 630 nm, 730 nm, 765 nm and 810 nm).

(d) CO2 absorption isotherms. (e) In situ FTIR spectra for the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the HCNT–NA sample. (f) Gibbs free energy diagram for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO on BCN and HCNT–NA. Charge difference of CO2 absorbed on (g) BCN and (h) HCNT–NA. 
Together with its excellent activity, HCNT–NA exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at λ = 420 nm (5.26%), as shown in Fig. 3b (see Experimental section 1.5 in the ESI†), outperforming most of the state-of-art heterogeneous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction in Table S2.† The turnover numbers (TONs) when HCNT–NA was used as the catalyst was calculated to be 83.96 for the evolved products over 8 h (see Experimental section 1.6 in the ESI†), demonstrating the catalytic nature of this CO2 reduction reaction. CO production was extended to longer wavelengths (500–850 nm), whereas a detectable amount of CO gas was generated even in the near-infrared region such as λ = 785, 810 and 840 nm using HCNT–NA. This was further verified by the observation of a recycled transient photocurrent response with chopped light in the near-infrared region (Fig. S26†) and time-dependent evolution of CO at λ = 785, λ = 810, and λ = 840 nm (Fig. S27†) over HCNT–NA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of PCN-based photocatalysts for CO2 conversion in the near-infrared region. Considering that the redox potential of CO2/CO is as high as −0.53 V. vs. NHE, the photocatalytic activity in the near-infrared region may contribute to the formation of inter-band excitation and nonlinear two-photon response.43,72
To illustrate the versatility of our functionalized-activation strategy, five different additives including ethylene glycol (EG), ethylenediamine (EDA), ethanolamine (EOA), diethanolamine (DOA) and triethanolamine (TOA) were chosen (their molecular structures are shown in Scheme S3†) and reacted with the DCDA precursor. As expected, all of them resulted in much higher CO production than BCN, as shown in Fig. 3c, revealing the universal applicability of in situ C–N coupling for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Additionally, although EDA and EOA, HCN–EDA (modified by ethyl) and HCN–EOA (modified by hydroxyethyl) possess different molecular structures, they delivered a similar CO evolution rate. This suggests that the improved photocatalytic activity is mainly determined by the grafting of the ethyl group, rather than the modification by hydroxy group.73 However, the grafted hydroxyethyl group of HCN–EOA exhibited slightly enhanced activity than that of HCN–EDA, which implies that the presence of hydroxy also favors CO2 reduction.
We performed the CO2 absorption capacity test, in situ FTIR measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the catalytic origin of our catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3d, HCNT–NA exhibited the strongest absorption capability toward CO2, which is five times that of BCN (5.49 versus 0.95 cm3 g−1), demonstrating its much enhanced CO2 absorption. This preferred absorption of CO2 on the surface of HCNT–NA is validated by the in situ FTIR spectra in Fig. 3e. A series of infrared peaks ascribed to carbonate species was observed under illumination. Specifically, the peaks at 1540, 1513 and 1462 cm−1 (m-CO32−), 1337, and1635 cm−1 (b-CO32−), 1209, 1406 and 1574 cm−1 (hydroxyl groups of carboxylic acid) are key evidence of the presence of surface-absorbed COOH* species.74 The COOH* species is the critical intermediate during the surface activation of CO2, whose intensity remained constant after 10 min due to the fast equilibrium between COOH* and the final product (CO). Meanwhile, the characteristic peak of CO at 2054 cm−1 gradually increased with time, in good agreement with the higher CO production under prolonged illumination (Fig. S28†).
To further reveal the influence of the hydroxyethyl group on the absorption and activation of CO2, the Gibbs free energy involving the reduction pathway of CO2 to CO via COOH* was calculated by DFT calculations, as shown in Fig. 3f. The results confirm much the lower absorption energy of CO2 on HCNT–NA than that on BCN (−0.292 versus −0.187 eV), demonstrating the facile activation of CO2 on HCNT–NA to form COO*. Detailed models on each CO2 reduction intermediate are presented in Fig. S29.† The activation energy barrier for the formation of COOH* over HCNT–NA is slightly smaller than that for BCN (0.853 versus 0.869 eV, Table S3†), indicating that HCNT–NA is also kinetically more favorable for the formation of COOH* than its BCN counterpart.75,76 As shown in the charge difference contours in Fig. 3g and h, the presence of hydroxyethyl groups can significantly enhance the charge density around the adjacent nitrogen atoms in HCNT–NA, where the charge distribution is clearly more delocalized to interact with the intermediates in CO2 reduction. This makes the CO bond closer to the catalyst surface for the subsequent electron transfer and generation of the *COOH intermediate, thus promoting the overall reduction process. We also calculated the carried charge (Δq) to estimate the electron transport direction, where the negative value reflects the number of electrons transferred to the CO2 molecule.16 Apparently, HCNT–NA has a larger absolute value (−0.391 e) than that of BCN (−0.129 e), indicating stronger electron transfer to the active CO2 molecules. Collectively, the existence of hydroxyethyl in the structural edge of HCNT–NA is favorable for CO2 adsorption, provides more excited electrons to active the CO2 molecules and lowers the CO2 transformation energy barrier.
Finally, the carrier dynamics during the photocatalytic process were investigated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4, to understand the importance of the hydroxyethyl group on the movement of charge carriers. After excitation at 400 nm, both BCN and HCNT–NA displayed a ground state bleach signal and an excited state absorption signal. The ground state bleach signal in HCNT–NA is broader than that of BCN and further extends to 440 nm, as shown in Fig. 4c, inconsistent with the studies on the band structure. The color contours of the TA spectra display much stronger positive absorption in HCNT–NA due to its higher excited charge carrier density.77,78 Since ground state bleaching originates from the state filling and reflects the excited state carrier population, the carrier dynamics from this signal was subtracted and plotted in Fig. 4d. It can clearly be seen that the lifetime of the excited state carriers is substantially prolonged by an order of magnitude (from 2.62 ps to 21.83 ps) with the modification of the hydroxyethyl groups. This prolonged period for carrier transportation to the interface results in better charge separation efficiency to provide sufficient surface electrons to participate in the CO2 reduction.

Accordingly, the experimental results can be well illustrated by the introduction of hydroxyethyl groups at the edge and the simultaneous formation the porous 1D microtubes with hollow micro-channels together with highly crystalline well-ordered domains using the feasible bottom-up strategy of NA motif nucleophilic addition and hydrothermal pretreatment process. Based on the aforementioned experimental analyses and theoretical calculations, this unique structure in HCNT–NA enabled substantially improved photocatalytic CO2 conversion as follows: (i) the existence of hydroxyethyl in the structural edge is beneficial for CO2 absorption and lowers the CO2 transformation energy barrier. (ii) The generated inter-band states, increased density of band tails and localized states originating from the hydroxyethyl group and well-ordered mesocrystal structure lead to a continuously extended optical region from 450–850 nm. (iii) The lifetime of excited state carriers is substantially prolonged compared to that of pristine PCN. (iv) The functionalized structure together with hierarchical porous 1D microtubes can largely limit the radiative recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and facilitate rapid charge transfer. Generally, the involved three essential steps in the semiconductor-based photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, namely: (i) light absorption, (ii) charge carrier separation and transfer, and (iii) surface absorption and redox reaction, the enhanced optical absorption region, excellent carriers separation and boosted CO2 absorption capacity in HCNT–NA, lead to a significantly photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a covalent functionalization strategy to promote the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on carbon nitride by activating the inert amino edge with hydroxyethyl groups. The as-synthesized hydroxyethyl-functionalized one-dimensional mesoporous matrix (HCNT–NA) exhibited a 39.5-fold increase in CO production rate (209.24 μmol h−1 g−1) compared to that of pristine BCN, together with a CO selectivity of 98.5% under white LED light illumination. The hydroxyethyl groups at the edge of the CN matrix led to the formation of an intermediate band in the energy gap and a higher state density along the Fermi level as well as a well-ordered mesocrystal structure, thus enabling stronger light-harvesting ability up to the near-infrared region. The presence of hydroxyethyl groups also promoted the activation of CO2 by decreasing its absorption energy barrier and activation energy. Meanwhile, the prolonged period for carrier transportation to the interface resulted in better charge separation efficiency in HCNT–NA to provide sufficient surface electrons to participate in the CO2 reduction. Our findings indicate the great potential of using hydroxyethyl-functionalized PCN in visible light-driven photocatalytic CO2 conversion and also provide a feasible bottom-up strategy for simultaneously realizing the activation of CO2 and wide-spectrum optical absorption with strong photoredox ability in photocatalysts.
