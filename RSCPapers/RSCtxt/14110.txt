    , Accepted 1st March 2017First published on 2nd March 2017AbstractDeveloping efficient noble metal-free multifunctional electrocatalysts is highly effective to dramatically reduce the overall cost of electrochemical devices. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a facile strategy for in situ coupling of ultrafine Co0.85Se nanocrystals and N-doped carbon (Co0.85Se@NC) by directly selenizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedra. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the coupling between Co0.85Se and NC, the Co–N–C structure, and the porous conductive carbon network, Co0.85Se@NC affords excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a small overpotential, remarkable stability, and high faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, Co0.85Se@NC can also efficiently catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and we therefore investigated its applications as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries. When used as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.76 V is sufficient to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2; the obtained Zn–air batteries exhibit a very low discharge–charge voltage gap (0.80 V at 10 mA cm−2) and long cycle life (up to 180 cycles). These results not only demonstrate a facile strategy for the synthesis of affordable Co0.85Se@NC but also present its huge potential as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for clean energy systems.
Introduction
Growing global energy consumption and associated environmental issues have motivated considerable interest in clean energy systems, such as water splitting devices, rechargeable metal–air batteries, and fuel cells. The electrocatalytic reactions involved in these energy systems [e.g. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), especially core oxygen evolution reaction (OER)] all require high-performance electrocatalysts to promote their commercial applications.1–3 Nowadays the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and ORR are still noble metals, such as Ir, Ru, Pt and so on.4–6 However, the prohibitive costs and scarcity of these noble metals seriously hinder their large-scale commercial use. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to searching for noble metal-free electrocatalysts with performances comparable to those of the noble metals. Recently, cobalt selenides, as a type of highly active cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts,3,7–16 have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high thermal and chemical stability. A variety of strategies have been developed to improve their performance. For instance, Xie's group designed and prepared vacancy-rich ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets with enhanced OER activity.12 Yu's group reported that CoSe2/Mn3O4 and CoSe2/CeO2 hybrids display significantly improved OER performances compared to pristine CoSe2.11,13 Zhang's group achieved bifunctional overall water splitting by anchoring CoO domains on CoSe2 nanobelts.14 Cui's group constructed an efficient and stable HER electrocatalyst by growing CoSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon fibre paper.15 A Co0.85Se/graphene hybrid was also used as a highly efficient catalyst for ORR.16 Although the cobalt selenides mentioned above show remarkable electrocatalytic behavior in a separate OER, or HER, or ORR, they can scarcely function well toward all OER, HER and ORR in the same electrolyte because of their unstable or inactive nature in an unfavorable pH environment.14,17 Therefore, constructing cobalt selenides with integrated performance for clean energy systems such as overall water splitting and rechargeable zinc–air batteries is still a challenging work.
Recently, a new family of metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived materials, including porous carbon and metal-based/(heteroatom-doped) carbon hybrid nanocomposites, have drawn fast-growing interest, and they have been widely used in electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and other fields.2,3,18–21 The MOFs as both the precursor and template can afford abundant channels to facilitate electron/ion transport or provide (heteroatom-doped) carbon species to combine with metal species by in situ carbonization to further increase the relevant properties (i.e. active sites, conductivity, and adsorptivity).22–24 Besides, the huge families of MOFs, which can be obtained easily by changing the metal species and organic ligands, also enrich these precursors and templates. On the other hand, novel and high-performance electrocatalysts like MoCx,2 especially Co-based groups such as Co3O4-carbon hybrid,3 Co–C@Co9S8 double-shelled nanocages,25 and CoxFe1−xP,26 have been successfully obtained by using the corresponding MOFs. Nowadays, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), a common type of MOFs, has been used as the precursor to prepare some functional materials, especially electrocatalysts like Co@Co3O4/NC,27 Co–C@Co9S8,25 CoP,28,29 and ZIF-Co0.85Se.30 However, these materials suffer from a time-consuming, multi-step synthesis process, or cannot work well as trifunctional electrocatalysts in OER, HER, and ORR. Also, cobalt selenide derived from MOFs as an electrocatalyst has rarely been reported so far.
Materials with a metal–nitrogen–carbon (Me–N–C) structure, i.e. metal cations coordinated with nitrogen functional groups provided by organic ligands or N-doped carbon, have been demonstrated to be high-performance electrocatalysts because of their excellent electroactivity and strong durability.5,31–36 Thus, extensive studies have been directed to those electrocatalysts with the Me–N–C structure for OER, HER, and ORR. For instance, Co–N–C species originating from a N-doped Co9S8/graphene hybrid31 and Co encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes36 can boost both OER and ORR performances; NiO combined with Fe(Co)–N–C5 and Ti–Nx–C32 constructed by the interaction between the carbon nitride and the titanium carbide nanosheets can enhance the OER activity. However, these strategies all suffer from a multi-step, time-consuming preparation process, or a high-temperature thermal treatment. Therefore, the above cases inspire us to seek for an advanced yet simple method to obtain catalysts with the Me–N–C structure for efficiently enhancing the electrocatalysis performance. Thus, a promising fabrication strategy is devised by using MOFs with a N-rich organic ligand followed by one-step carbonization to ensure that the resultant electrocatalysts have the Me–N–C (e.g. Co–N–C) structure and a controlled microstructure.
Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate in situ coupling of Co0.85Se nanocrystals and N-doped carbon (denoted as Co0.85Se@NC) via a one-step carbonization–selenylation procedure by using zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as both the precursor and template. The resultant Co0.85Se@NC can be used as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries. Importantly, the carbonization of ZIF-67 can not only enable a synergistic effect of the combination of N-doped carbon and Co0.85Se nanocrystals, but can also facilitate construction of the Co–N–C structure to further enhance the multifunctional electrocatalysis performances. Besides, the in situ carbonization of ZIF-67 can also ensure a smaller size of Co0.85Se nanocrystals to increase the catalytic sites, thus resulting in high electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the resultant Co0.85Se@NC also inherits the porous structure of the ZIF-67 template, which can increase the solid/liquid contact surface area and promote the efficient transfer of the electrolyte and the rapid diffusion of gas products. As a consequence, Co0.85Se@NC with the Co–N–C structure, short diffusion pathways for electron/ion transport, and synergistic effect between the ultrafine Co0.85Se nanocrystals and NC exhibits excellent activity as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn–air batteries.
Experimental
Preparation of ZIF-67
In a typical synthesis, 0.63 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was first dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol under magnetic stirring. Then, 50 mL of ethanol containing 2.48 mmol of 2-methylimidazole was added dropwise into the above solution under continuous stirring, and the resultant solution was further stirred at room temperature. After 24 h, the product (ZIF-67) was collected by centrifuging, washed with absolute ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of Co0.85Se@NC
To prepare Co0.85Se@NC, the obtained ZIF-67 and Se powder with a mass ratio of 1:1 were put in two separate positions of a porcelain boat. Then the porcelain boat was put into a furnace with Se powder at the upstream side of the furnace and heated at 600 °C for 3 h with a heating speed of 2 °C min−1 under a H2/Ar atmosphere (H2, 7 vol%). After cooling to room temperature, Co0.85Se@NC was obtained. For comparison, two other Co0.85Se@NC samples were also prepared at 500 °C and 700 °C while keeping other reaction conditions constant.
Preparation of Co0.85Se
ZIF-67 was first calcined at 500 °C for 3 h with a heating speed of 2 °C min−1 in air, leading to the formation of Co3O4. Then Co3O4 and Se were reacted with the reaction parameters same as those for the preparation of Co0.85Se@NC.
Preparation of N-doped carbon (named as NC)
NC was prepared by etching the as-prepared Co0.85Se@NC with 1.0 M HCl aqueous solution for 24 h to remove Co0.85Se.
Preparation of physically mixed Co0.85Se and NC
The as-prepared Co0.85Se was physically mixed with NC in a mass ratio same as that for Co0.85Se@NC by grinding and ultrasound treatment.
Preparation of CoSe2@NC
CoSe2@NC was prepared with a mass ratio of ZIF-67 to Se powder at 1:2 while keeping other reaction conditions same as those of Co0.85Se@NC.
Preparation of Co@NC
ZIF-67 was directly heated at 600 °C for 3 h with a heating speed of 2 °C min−1 under a H2/Ar atmosphere (H2, 7 vol%).
Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ ≈ 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA in a scanning range of 10–80° (2θ). Raman spectra were collected on an Invia Raman spectrometer with an excitation laser wavelength of 633 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed on a Rigaku thermogravimetry (TG) analyser from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in air. X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements were undertaken at Beamlines 1W1B at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) using transmission modes. The morphologies of as-obtained products were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI S-4800). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images were taken on a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) (FEI Technai G2 F20). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Belsorp-max sorption analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Before measurement, the Co0.85Se@NC sample was degassed at 200 °C for 3 h. Surface area was calculated by the multi-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore-size distribution was calculated from the adsorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization

Preparation of electrocatalyst ink. 
The working electrodes for electrochemical measurements were prepared by the following processes. 4 mg of the as-prepared sample was dispersed into 1 mL of solution containing 900 μL of ethanol and 100 μL of 0.5 wt% Nafion solution followed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Then, 20 μL of the above slurry was coated onto a glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 5 mm and dried naturally at room temperature.


OER measurements. 
OER measurements were performed in a three-electrode system using a rotating disk electrode (PINE Research Instrumentation, at a rotation speed of 1500 rpm) and the data were collected using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Shanghai). An Ag/AgCl (KCl, 4 M) electrode and a Pt foil (1 × 1 cm−2) were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. All current densities were normalized to the geometrical surface area and the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl was converted to the potential vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + (0.205 + 0.059 pH)V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were taken at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 to obtain the polarization curves, and 1.0 M KOH solution was used as an aqueous electrolyte with a continuous flow of O2 during the test in order to ensure the O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The Tafel slope was calculated according to the Tafel equation η = blog(j/j0) (η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and j0 is the exchange current density). Overpotential was calculated from η = E (vs. RHE) – 1.23, considering O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
In order to investigate the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism, the rotating ring–disk electrode (RRDE) voltammograms were recorded in an RRDE configuration (Pine Research Instrumentation, USA) composed of a disk electrode (glassy carbon) and a ring electrode (platinum). 20 μL of electrocatalyst ink was coated onto the disk electrode, and a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 was utilized for RRDE experiments with a rotation rate of 1500 rpm. In order to determine the reaction pathway for OER by detecting the HO2− formation, the ring potential was held constantly at 1.50 V vs. RHE to oxidize the possible HO2− intermediate in O2-saturated KOH aqueous solution during the OER process. Next, a continuous OER (disk electrode) to ORR (ring electrode) process occurring on the RRDE was used to confirm that the observed anodic current originates from the OER process rather than other side reactions and meanwhile to further collect the faradaic efficiency. The ring potential of the RRDE was kept constant at 0.4 V vs. RHE to reduce the O2 produced from the catalyst on the disk electrode in a N2-saturated electrolyte. [See Ma, T. Y.; et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 13925–13931, and Zhu, Y. P.; et al., Adv. Funct. Mater. 2015, 25, 7337–7347.] The faradaic efficiency (ε) was calculated based on the following equation: ε = Ir/(IdN), where Id and Ir stand for the disk current and the ring current, respectively, and N represents the current collection efficiency of RRDE. Furthermore, IrO2 is a well-established benchmark OER catalyst with almost 100% faradaic efficiency because it is free of probable carbon oxidation during the OER process, and therefore the IrO2 thin-film electrode is selected for the calibration of the collection efficiency of the RRDE. [See T. Nakagawa, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 15578–15579.] Thus, the N value is determined to be 0.2. To measure the faradaic efficiency, the disk electrode current was held at a small constant current of 200 μA, which is large enough to ensure appreciable O2 production and sufficiently small to minimize local saturation and bubble formation at the disk electrode. [See C. C. L. McCrory, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 16977–16987.]
Long-term stability was determined using the i–t curve at a certain potential for 12 h using a rotating speed of 1500 rpm. To evaluate the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC), cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were tested from 1.15 to 1.19 V (vs. RHE, in 1.0 M KOH) with scan rates ranging from 20 to 60 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at a potential of 1.6 V vs. RHE with frequencies from 500000 to 1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. All the data presented were not corrected for iR losses.


HER measurements. 
For HER measurements, the typical process is similar to that of OER, in which a flow of N2 instead of a flow of O2 was maintained over the electrolyte throughout the electrochemical tests to ensure the H2/H2O equilibrium at 0 V vs. RHE.


Overall water splitting. 
To evaluate the full process of water electrolysis, the Co0.85Se@NC catalyst coated onto a nickel foam substrate was used as both the anode and cathode. The electrolyte was purged with N2 gas for 30 min under ambient conditions before the electrochemical tests.


ORR measurements. 
For ORR measurements, the typical strategy is similar to that of OER. The electrochemical experiments were carried out in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for the ORR. The potential range is cyclically scanned between 0.172 and 1.172 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The CV and LSV were obtained at ambient temperature after purging O2 or N2 gas for 30 min. The potential cycling was repeated until stable voltammogram curves were obtained.
RDE measurements were carried out at rotating rates varying from 400 to 2025 rpm at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The kinetic parameters can be obtained on the basis of Koutecky–Levich equations as follows:1/J = 1/Jk + 1/(Bω1/2)B = 0.2nFCoDo2/3ν−1/6Jk = nFkCowhere J is the measured current density, Jk is the kinetic current density, ω is the rotation speed (the constant 0.2 is used when the rotation speed is expressed in rpm), n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant (964 85 C mol−1), Co is the saturated concentration of O2 in the electrolyte (1.21 × 10−3 mol L−1), Do is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in the solution (1.9 × 10−5 cm s−1), ν is the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm2 s−1), and k is the electron-transfer rate constant.


Zn–air batteries. 
Rechargeable Zn–air batteries were tested in home-made electrochemical cells, and the prepared Co0.85Se@NC was coated on a carbon paper substrate as the air cathode, a polished Zn plate was employed as the anode, and a 6 M KOH + 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2 aqueous solution was utilized as the electrolyte. Battery tests were performed at room temperature on a LAND CT2001A instrument. For the cycling test, one cycle consists of one discharging step (10 mA cm−2 for 5 min) followed by one charging step of the same current density and duration time.

Results and discussion
The overall fabrication process of Co0.85Se@NC is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1 (for details see the Experimental section). First, ZIF-67 was prepared by a facile and scalable method. Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methyl-imidazole were mixed in an ethanol solvent under magnetic stirring at ambient temperature and after 24 h, ZIF-67 was formed (Fig. S1a†). Subsequently, ZIF-67 and Se powder with an appreciable mass ratio were put in two separate positions of a porcelain boat. Then the porcelain boat was put into a furnace with Se powder at the upstream side of the furnace and heated at an appropriate temperature under a H2/Ar atmosphere. During the heat treatment process, the organic ligand 2-methyl-imidazole in ZIF-67 was carbonized into N-doped carbon and simultaneously Co present in ZIF-67 was selenized into Co0.85Se surrounded by in situ formed N-doped carbon, thus leading to the formation of Co0.85Se@NC. The phase composition of the resultant sample was first characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, the main diffraction peaks at 33.3°, 44.7°, 50.6°, 60.4°, 61.7° and 69.9°, can be assigned to (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (202) planes of hexagonal Co0.85Se (JCPDS, no. 52-1008), respectively, indicating that the Co0.85Se alloy phase has been successfully synthesized by the current strategy. The broad peak in the 2θ range of 20–30° is related to carbon species, which is further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. From Fig. 1b, we can see that two prominent peaks at around 1341.5 and 1586.9 cm−1 are clearly observed, and they are assigned to the D and G bands of carbon, respectively. The D band is related to the structural defects or partially disordered structures in carbon materials, while the G band is associated with the degree of graphitization. The carbon species in Co0.85Se@NC is determined to be around 31 wt% from the thermogravimetric analysis (TG) curve (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to further analyze the surface chemical information of Co0.85Se@NC. The survey XPS spectrum in Fig. S2† confirms Se, C, N, O, and Co elements existing in Co0.85Se@NC. The presence of the O element is probably due to the adsorbed oxygen-species or the oxidized parts caused by exposure to air. Fig. 1d shows the high resolution C 1s XPS spectrum, which can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 284.6, 285.6, and 288.7 eV, corresponding to C–C, CN, and O–CO bonds, respectively. The high resolution Co 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 1e) shows the peaks of Co 2P3/2 and Co 2P1/2 with binding energies at 780.0 and 796.6 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 785.8 and 803.0 eV. The Co 2P3/2 peak can be deconvoluted into four components with binding energies at 777.8, 779.4, 780.3, and 781.6 eV, corresponding to Co0, Co2+, Co–Nx, and Co3+, respectively.31,37–39 The Co2+ and Co3+ may result from the surface oxidation under ambient air, consistent with the reported result.27Fig. 1f shows the high resolution Se 3d XPS spectrum, in which Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks at 53.6 and 54.2 eV with a spin–orbit splitting of 0.86 eV can be assigned to Se0, while the wide and weak peak at about 59.7 eV discloses the presence of SeOx.15,30 Furthermore, the high resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 1g) can be deconvoluted into five components with binding energies at 398.2, 403.7, 400.6, 401.8, and 403.7 eV, which can be assigned to pyridinic N, Co–Nx, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N, respectively.39,40 The total nitrogen content in Co0.85Se@NC is determined to be as high as 5.26 wt% by CHN elemental analysis. These XPS results confirm the surface chemical states of all elements involved in Co0.85Se@NC as well as the formation of Co–N–C. If the original mass ratios of ZIF-67 to Se powder were 1:2 and 1:0, CoSe2@NC and Co@NC were obtained, respectively (Fig. S3†).

More information about the charge states and electronic nature of Co0.85Se@NC was obtained from X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2a, the pre-edge of the Co K-edge XANES spectrum of Co0.85Se@NC clearly shifts towards higher energy compared to that of pristine Co0.85Se, indicating the existence of a strong interaction between Co0.85Se and N-doped carbon, which is caused by a negative charge-transfer from Co to carbon.41,42 Furthermore, Fig. 2b shows the Fourier transformed k3-weighted EXAFS data for Co0.85Se@NC and Co0.85Se. Clearly, Co0.85Se@NC exhibits a relatively strong peak at 1.56 Å, which can be assigned to the typical Co–N bond.41,43 This result further confirms the existence of the Co–Nx bond in Co0.85Se@NC, which is constructed by the interaction between Co0.85Se and N-doped carbon, in good agreement with the above XPS results. It has been well addressed that the Co–Nx bond is beneficial for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the materials.32

Fig. 3a shows a representative field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of Co0.85Se@NC. It can be clearly seen that the sample completely inherits the polyhedral morphology of the ZIF-67 precursor (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Compared to ZIF-67 polyhedra with a fairly smooth surface, the Co0.85Se@NC polyhedra are much rougher in surface and have a length of 200 nm. During the thermal treatment process, a full phase transformation occurs from ZIF-67 to Co0.85Se@NC, which is the reason for the formation of the rougher surface. The microstructure of Co0.85Se@NC is further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in Fig. 3b, the polyhedral structure is also observed, same as the above FE-SEM result. A detailed examination of a single polyhedron (Fig. 3c) reveals that the Co0.85Se@NC polyhedron is composed of numerous small nanocrystals. Besides, a highly porous texture can be clearly observed throughout the polyhedron, which may result from the decomposition of organic species in ZIF-67 during the thermal treatment process. More details on the edge of the Co0.85Se@NC polyhedron can be obtained from Fig. 3d. Numerous 10 nm-sized Co0.85Se nanocrystals (darker areas indicated by red circles) are embedded in a carbon matrix (as verified by Raman, TG and XPS), which may play important roles in prohibiting further growth of the Co0.85Se nanocrystals, stabilizing the polyhedral structure, and affecting the electronic structure of Co. Furthermore, a representative high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3e) clearly shows that a carbon layer with a thickness of about 1–2 nm is formed on the surface of a Co0.85Se nanocrystal, which results from in situ carbonization of the organic ligand in ZIF-67. The resolved interplanar distances of the lattice fringes are 0.26 and 0.34 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of Co0.85Se16 and the (001) planes of graphite, respectively. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also confirms the polycrystalline nature of the Co0.85Se nanocrystals. Additionally, in agreement with the results from XPS measurements, the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum also confirms that the Co0.85Se@NC samples are composed of Co, Se, C, and N elements (Fig. 3f), and that these elements are homogeneously distributed (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the N2 adsorption isotherms recorded on Co0.85Se@NC belong to type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H4 (Fig. 3h), which is usually observed for mesoporous materials with slit-like pores, in good agreement with the above TEM observations. Correspondingly, the sizes of the mesopores are mainly in the range of 2–20 nm from the pore size distribution curve (Fig. 3i). Also, Co0.85Se@NC displays a high specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 55 m2 g−1. The rich porous channel and high surface area of Co0.85Se@NC may result from the porous structure of the ZIF-67 template, and at the same time they are beneficial for improving its electrocatalytic performance.

(h) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Co0.85Se@NC and (i) corresponding pore size distribution curve from the BJH model. 
The electrocatalytic OER activity of Co0.85Se@NC was first evaluated using the polarization linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) recorded in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 using a standard three-electrode configuration (see the Experimental section for details). For comparison, CoSe2@NC, Co@NC, Co0.85Se (Fig. S4†), NC (Fig. S5†), ZIF-67, Pt/C and IrO2/C were also tested under the same conditions. Co0.85Se@NC exhibits the optimal performance with a mass loading of 0.4 mg cm−2 on a glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode (Fig. S6a†), while the catalysts prepared with lower or higher temperatures show slightly inferior OER performance (Fig. S6b†), and therefore in the following discussion, we compare this optimal result with those of other samples. First, as shown in Fig. S3b,† the OER activity of Co0.85Se@NC is obviously better than those of Co@NC and CoSe2@NC. As we know, the Co–Se bond can lead to the Co in Co0.85Se@NC with a high valence state,30,44 and this is able to boost the OER adsorption process, which can be further supported by its Tafel slope value (Fig. S3c†) (75 vs. 101 mV dec−1 for Co0.85Se@NC vs. Co@NC). In addition, Co0.85Se@NC has a higher Co/Se atomic ratio than CoSe2@NC, and this can enhance the adsorption process in the OER reaction as Co0.85Se@NC has a small Tafel slope value (Fig. S3c†), which is determined by its inherent phase structure, commonly observed in other studies.44,45 Moreover, NC and ZIF-67 show negligible current densities below the potential of 1.60 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while the pristine Co0.85Se presents the OER response with an onset potential at 1.59 V (Fig. 4a), indicating that the catalytic sites come mainly from Co0.85Se. In contrast, Co0.85Se@NC exhibits significantly enhanced OER catalytic activity. Specifically, Co0.85Se@NC reveals a sharp onset of OER current at approximately 1.49 V, indicating that the synergistic effect between Co0.85Se and NC is responsible for the excellent OER performance. Noticeably, although the IrO2/C affords an onset potential of approximately 1.47 V, slightly smaller than that of Co0.85Se@NC, its OER current densities drop obviously below those of Co0.85Se@NC at high biases, indicating the excellent OER catalytic activity of Co0.85Se@NC. Moreover, we further compared the operating potentials required for all the catalysts to deliver 10.0 mA cm−2 current density, the approximate current density expected for a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device under 1 sun illumination.46,47 The operating potential of Co0.85Se@NC at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 1.55 V, comparable to that of the state-of-the-art IrO2/C catalyst (1.55 V), but much lower than those of Co0.85Se (1.65 V), NC (1.72 V), ZIF-67 (1.76 V), Pt/C (1.74 V), CoSe2@NC (1.64 V), Co@NC (1.69 V), and many other reported catalysts, for example, IrO2/C (1.60 V, 0.1 M KOH),48 Pt/C (1.83 V, 0.1 M KOH),49 CoSe2 ultrathin nanosheets (1.55 V, 0.1 M KOH),12 CoSe2/N-graphene (1.596 V, 0.1 M KOH),50 Mn3O4/CoSe2 hybrids (1.68 V, 0.1 M KOH),11 CoS2/N,S-GO (1.61 V, 0.1 M KOH),51 and TCCN (1.65 V, 0.1 M KOH).32 A detailed comparison of various OER catalysts reported recently is presented in Table S1,† further confirming the outstanding catalytic activity of Co0.85Se@NC. The OER kinetics of the above catalysts were further examined by Tafel plots, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Tafel slopes are found to be 75, 88, 90, 97, 94, and 73 mV dec−1 for Co0.85Se@NC, Co0.85Se, NC, ZIF-67, Pt/C, and IrO2/C, respectively. Clearly, the Tafel slope of Co0.85Se@NC is close to that of IrO2/C, but it is lower than those of the control samples and some of the previously reported OER catalysts (Table S1†). This result suggests that Co0.85Se@NC has favorable OER reaction kinetics corresponding to its high catalytic activity.

(f) Polarization curves of Co0.85Se@NC before and after 1000 cycles. 
To obtain further insights into the reaction mechanism, we used the rotating ring–disk electrode (RRDE) technique with a Pt ring electrode potential of 1.50 V to oxidize the peroxide intermediates formed on the Co0.85Se@NC surface during the OER process. As shown in Fig. 4c, it can be clearly seen that a fairly low ring current of 6 μA is detected and this value is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the disk current (mA scale), which is so small that it can be neglected. So it can be reasonably concluded that Co0.85Se@NC favors a desirable four-electron pathway for water oxidation (4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−). Moreover, in order to prove that the observed anodic current results from the OER process rather than other side reactions and also to further measure the faradaic efficiency, an RRDE with a ring electrode potential of 0.40 V (a value to ensure that the ORR can take place) in N2-saturated medium was employed to reduce the generated O2 from the OER process (Fig. 4d), thus guaranteeing a continuous OER (disk electrode) to ORR (ring electrode) process (the inset of Fig. 4d).3,44 When the disk current was fixed at 200 μA, a constant ring current of about 39 μA (collection efficiency 0.2) can be detected, indicating that the anodic current catalyzed by Co0.85Se@NC is attributed to the OER process with a high faradaic efficiency of 97.5%.10,51,52
Another critical criterion for evaluating the OER performance of the electrocatalysts is the long-term durability, which is significant for energy conversion and storage systems. As shown in Fig. 4e, the chronoamperometric response curve for Co0.85Se@NC at a low potential of 1.55 V exhibits an anodic current attenuation as small as 6.6% within 12 h, demonstrating high stability. This insignificant activity decrease of Co0.85Se@NC may be caused by a small amount of the Co0.85Se@NC catalyst peeling off the electrode during the evolution of a large amount of O2 gas for the long process.45 In contrast, Co0.85Se displays not only 3.1 times larger current attenuation (20.7%) than Co0.85Se@NC, but also 100 mV larger potential to afford the same current density response within 10 h (Fig. S7†), indicating the synergistic effect between Co0.85Se and NC. The TEM image of the Co0.85Se@NC electrocatalyst after a 12 h reaction shows a good polyhedron structure, almost completely same as that of the fresh Co0.85Se@NC (Fig. S8a†). Besides, the HRTEM image gives the interplanar distance of the lattice fringes to be 0.26 nm, which corresponds to the (101) planes for Co0.85Se (Fig. S8b†), suggesting the fact that the Co0.85Se phase does not change during the OER process. All these findings indicate the superior stability and excellent OER catalytic activity of Co0.85Se@NC. Furthermore, from the chronopotentiometric curve tested at the current density of 10.0 mA cm−2 (the inset in Fig. 4e), we can see that Co0.85Se@NC has a nearly constant operating potential at 1.55 V with a trend of continuous potential decrease corresponding to its current increase in the i–t curve in the first 3 h, which is owing to the diffusion of the electrolyte into the electrode, while the potential of Co0.85Se increases about 13 mV from 1.650 to 1.663 V as a striking contrast within 5000 s, again revealing the superior durability of Co0.85Se@NC. Additionally, accelerated degradation studies are carried out by taking continuous cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at an accelerated sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 for 1000 cycles to probe the stability of the catalyst; only 2.6% anodic current loss (4 mV increased) is observed for Co0.85Se@NC, further confirming its highly stable performance (Fig. 4f).
The outstanding OER performance of Co0.85Se@NC originates from the synergistic effect between ultrafine Co0.85Se nanocrystals and highly conductive N-doped carbon, the Co–N–C structure constructed by the interaction between the high N content and Co0.85Se species, and unique porous architecture. Firstly, the synergistic effect between the highly conductive N-doped carbon and ultrafine Co0.85Se plays an important role in enhancing the OER performance of Co0.85Se@NC. As discussed above, the pre-edge of the Co K-edge XANES spectrum of Co0.85Se@NC (Fig. 2a) has shifted towards higher energy compared to Co0.85Se due to the negative charge transfer from Co to carbon,41,42 indicating a strong coupling effect between Co0.85Se nanocrystals and N-doped carbon species. The in situ incorporated N-doped carbon causes impaired electron density of Co atoms, which can make the electrocatalytically active sites of Co more electrophilic,42,53 thus facilitating the adsorption and reaction of OH− groups with Co0.85Se@NC,54 resulting in outstanding OER performance. Besides, the uniform anchoring of Co0.85Se in situ on the N-doped carbon, assured by the use of ZIF-67 as the precursor, can greatly improve the conductivity and charge transfer capability of the Co0.85Se catalyst. The strong coupling effect between them can take full advantage of the superior electric conductivity of the N-doped carbon backbone, which can facilitate the charge transfer in the hybrid catalyst, thus resulting in enhanced OER activity and stability. For instance, compared to the physically mixed Co0.85Se and NC, and carbon-free Co0.85Se, Co0.85Se@NC has a smaller onset potential with continually enhanced current density, suggesting its much higher OER activity (Fig. 5a). Moreover, Co0.85Se@NC has a smaller semicircular diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) than Co0.85Se (Fig. 5b), revealing its smaller contact impedance and faster charge transport along with favorable reaction kinetics. The higher OER electrocatalytic activity and smaller charge transfer impedance of Co0.85Se@NC both benefit from the strong coupling between Co0.85Se and N-doped carbon. Additionally, the N-doped carbon matrix might also play an important role in prohibiting the growth of Co0.85Se nanocrystals, thus increasing the catalytic sites and stabilizing the polyhedral structure of Co0.85Se@NC to contribute to the microstructure effect such as the porous structure.

(c) Polarization curves of Co0.85Se@NC and Co0.85Se at different scan rates. (d) Plots of the current density at 1.17 V (V vs. RHE) vs. the scan rate of Co0.85Se@NC and Co0.85Se. 
Secondly, as high as 5.26 wt% N content of Co0.85Se@NC can be achieved, as determined by CHN elemental analysis. Such a high N content can not only directly act as OER active sites but can also facilitate incorporation of metals (e.g. Co species) forming a Co–N–C structure (as proved by XPS and XANES) to boost the OER performance. Recently, Qiao32 reported that Ti–Nx motifs constructed by the interaction between carbon nitride and titanium carbide nanosheets can act as OER electroactive sites. Dai31 reported that N-doping into both Co9S8 and graphene could efficiently enhance the electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER by tuning the electronic properties of Co9S8 and graphene. Others also assumed that the metal–N–C structure can boost oxygen electrochemistry performance. Based on these facts, we conjecture that the Co–N–C structure in our case also contributes to increasing the OER performance.
Thirdly, the unique porous architecture of Co0.85Se@NC, on the one hand, can provide abundant and short diffusion pathways for electron/ion transport during the electrochemical reactions, and on the other hand, can afford a large active surface area for increasing catalytic sites. Noticeably, for the OER polarization curves of Co0.85Se@NC, the current density is not susceptible to the scan rate increasing from 2 to 15 mV s−1, while Co0.85Se acts as a striking contrast (Fig. 5c). This result indicates that the high porosity of Co0.85Se@NC favors the efficient transfer of the electrolyte and the rapid diffusion of the O2 product. Furthermore, the mesoporous Co0.85Se@NC polyhedra afford a large active surface area, which has been confirmed by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the calculated slope from the linear relationship of the current density against the scan rate (Fig. S9†). Co0.85Se@NC shows a larger Cdl than Co0.85Se (3.2 vs. 2.4 mF cm−2), indicating an enlarged catalytic solid–liquid contact surface area for Co0.85Se@NC (Fig. 5d). Thus, the rich channel and large solid–liquid contact surface area of Co0.85Se@NC provided by its unique porous architecture can obviously increase its OER electrocatalytic performance.
The opposite reaction initiated on the oxygen evolution electrode that can catalyze the corresponding cathode hydrogen evolution process as well is an important criterion to pursue the fabrication of a bifunctional water electrolysis electrode and simplify the installation. Hence, the catalytic capacity of Co0.85Se@NC for HER is assessed in the same electrolyte as OER (1.0 M KOH). As shown in Fig. 6a, Co0.85Se@NC has a small onset potential of around −140 mV at the current density of 2 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10†), beyond which the cathodic current increases rapidly at higher biases, indicating outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for Co0.85Se@NC is 230 mV, which is far smaller than those of Co0.85Se (424 mV), NC (442 mV), ZIF-67 (599 mV), and some other reported non-noble metal HER electrocatalysts. Co0.85Se@NC also possesses favorable HER reaction kinetics with a small Tafel value of 125 mV dec−1, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (104 mV dec−1), but much smaller than those of Co0.85Se (197 mV dec−1), NC (224 mV dec−1), and ZIF-67 (135 mV dec−1) (Fig. 6b). This result suggests that Co0.85Se@NC has favorable HER reaction kinetics corresponding to its high catalytic activity. As expected, Co0.85Se@NC displays excellent stability (tested by the chronoamperometric model) in basic solution within 10 h only with a minor current drop at the beginning of the HER measurements, which may be due to the loss of the electrocatalyst from the electrode on rapid rotation (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the polarization curves before and after operating for 10 h in basic medium were also tested (the inset in Fig. 6c), which show similar robust durability, indicating the super stability of Co0.85Se@NC. We also studied the relationship between the HER current density and the scan rate. As shown in Fig. 6d, the HER current density for Co0.85Se@NC is not susceptible to the scan rate increasing from 2 to 20 mV s−1. So, the unique porous architecture of Co0.85Se@NC may contribute to the enhanced HER performance. Besides, the synergistic effect between the highly conductive N-doped carbon and ultrafine Co0.85Se also contributes to the enhanced HER activity by decreasing the charge transfer impedance (as evidenced by the EIS test in the inset of Fig. 6d). Encouraged by the excellent OER and HER performances, we accordingly assembled a water electrolyzer with a two-electrode configuration in 1.0 M KOH, in which the as-synthesized Co0.85Se@NC was coated on Ni foam as both the anode and the cathode (the inset in Fig. 6e). As shown in Fig. 6e, a catalytic current is detected when the applied potential is larger than 1.42 V, and the current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.76 V, representing a combined overpotential of 530 mV for full water splitting. The overall water splitting performance of Co0.85Se@NC also outperforms those of commercial Pt/C and the Ni foam substrate. In addition, the stability test indicates that Co0.85Se@NC has high stability with good rate performance as the current density increases from 5 to 10, and 20 mA cm−2 during the 35 h electrocatalysis process (Fig. 6f). Co0.85Se@NC exhibits low overpotentials and superior stability, which demonstrates its promising practical application for overall water splitting.

(e) Polarization curves of a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer using Co0.85Se@NC//Co0.85Se@NC, Pt/C//Pt/C and Ni foam//Ni foam as both the cathode and anode at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1.0 M N2-saturated KOH. (f) Galvanostatic water electrolysis at a series of current densities of 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−2 over the course of 35 h for Co0.85Se@NC//Co0.85Se@NC. 
Interestingly, apart from the excellent overall water splitting performance, Co0.85Se@NC also shows remarkable ORR activity, making it a promising application for metal–air batteries. Specifically, in cyclic voltammograms (CVs, Fig. 7a), one characteristic ORR peak centered at 0.817 V is observed in 0.1 M O2-saturated KOH solution, showing the electrochemical reduction of oxygen initiated on Co0.85Se@NC, while, in sharp contrast, no significant peak is obtained in N2-saturated solution. This potential (0.817 V) is close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, but far more positive in comparison to those for Co0.85Se (0.617 V), NC (0.73 V), ZIF-67 (0.732 V) (Fig. S11†), and previously reported Co-based ORR catalysts (e.g. −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl for Co0.85Se/graphene hybrid nanosheets,16 0.704 V vs. RHE for N–Co9S8/G,31 and −0.21 V vs. SCE for Co3O4/ON–CNW55), indicating an easier ORR process on Co0.85Se@NC. Accordingly, Co0.85Se@NC displays a sharp onset potential at 0.912 V in the polarization LSV curves (Fig. 7b), and its limiting current density increases with increasing the rotation speed (e.g. from 400 to 2025 rpm) because of the increased diffusion rate at high speeds.56 The corresponding Koutechy–Levich (K–L) plots of Co0.85Se@NC are obtained from LSVs with potentials ranging from 0.272 to 0.572 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7c), and all plots show fairly good linearity, suggesting first-order reaction kinetics toward dissolved oxygen and similar electron-transfer number (n) for the ORR process at different potentials. The n is calculated to be in the range of 3.98 to 4.03 at the potentials ranging from 0.272 to 0.572 V (Fig. 7d), indicating that the Co0.85Se@NC electrode favors a four-electron oxygen reduction process. Thus, Co0.85Se@NC favors a desirable four-electron pathway for reversible OER and ORR processes (4OH− ↔ O2 + 2H2O + 4e−), which is of great significance, especially for rechargeable metal–air batteries and regenerated fuel cells involving these two reactions.

(b) Rotating-disk electrode polarization curves (LSVs) of Co0.85Se@NC in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at rotating rates ranging from 400 to 2025 rpm with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. (c) K–L plots of Co0.85Se@NC obtained from the RDE data at 0.572, 0.522, 0.472, 0.422, 0.372, 0.322 and 0.272 V vs. RHE, and (d) the corresponding electron-transfer number. (f) Rotating-disk electrode LSVs of Co0.85Se@NC, Co0.85Se, NC, ZIF-67, and Pt/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 at 1600 rpm. (f) The chronoamperometry curves of Co0.85Se@NC and commercial Pt/C catalysts obtained at 0.672 V in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. 
Moreover, we also evaluated the ORR performance of Co0.85Se@NC, Co0.85Se, NC, ZIF-67, and commercial Pt/C catalyst using RDE technology at the rotating speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M O2-saturated KOH (Fig. 7e). Remarkably, Co0.85Se@NC displays significant ORR performance, which is not only better than Co0.85Se, NC, and ZIF-67 in both the onset potential and the reaction current density, but also comparable to the commercial Pt/C, revealing the high ORR activity of Co0.85Se@NC. As expected, Co0.85Se@NC also shows strong durability as revealed by the chronoamperometric response (Fig. 7f), retaining 85.2% of the initial current even after 10 h, while the Pt/C catalyst loses 28% of its initial current. The high activity and good durability of Co0.85Se@NC may be due to the Co–N–C structure, the porous structure and the synergistic effect between the highly conductive N-doped carbon and the ultrafine Co0.85Se nanocrystals. These excellent ORR features of Co0.85Se@NC, especially together with its outstanding OER performance, are particularly desirable for clean energy systems, such as rechargeable metal–air batteries and alkaline fuel cells.
Next, proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to demonstrate the potential application of Co0.85Se@NC in rechargeable Zn–air batteries since OER and ORR are two fundamental steps in this application. A home-made rechargeable Zn–air battery device was constructed by pairing a zinc plate (the anode), the Co0.85Se@NC loaded on carbon fiber paper (the cathode), and O2-saturated KOH/Zn(Ac)2 electrolyte (Fig. 8a). The battery has an open circuit voltage of ∼1.4 V and a small internal resistance (Fig. S12†). Clearly, Co0.85Se@NC shows a current density of 186 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 1.0 V, which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (162 mA cm−2) and other reported values (Table S2†). The peak power density of Co0.85Se@NC (Fig. 8b) is as high as 268 mW cm−2 at 0.64 V, which is also superior to those of Co0.85Se (139 mW cm−2), Pt/C (173 mW cm−2) and some previously reported materials on Zn–air primary batteries (Table S3†). Fig. 8c shows the charge and discharge polarization curves of the rechargeable Zn–air battery using the galvanodynamic method with Co0.85Se@NC coated on carbon fiber paper as both the ORR and OER electrodes. It can be clearly observed that Co0.85Se@NC, Co0.85Se and commercial Pt/C all show excellent rate capability during the charging and discharging process. Specifically, Co0.85Se@NC exhibits a discharging potential superior to Co0.85Se, and comparable to the commercial Pt/C during the ORR process, while for the charging process, Co0.85Se@NC obviously outperforms the Pt/C catalyst. The charge–discharge voltage gap at 20 mA cm−2 for Co0.85Se@NC is only 0.88 V, which is much smaller than those of Co0.85Se (1.13 V) and Pt/C (0.96 V), and some results reported previously (Table S3†). Importantly, when repeatedly charged or discharged at 10 mA cm−2 with a 10 min per cycle period (including discharging for 5 min, followed by charging for the same period of time) (Fig. 8d), Co0.85Se@NC as the air cathode affords a discharge voltage of 1.27 V and a charge voltage of 2.07 V with a small voltage gap of 0.80 V and a high trip efficiency of 61.35% in the first cycle. At the same time, it also shows high cycling stability with no obvious potential change for over 180 charge–discharge cycles within 30 h, whereas an apparent increase in both the charge and discharge voltages is observed after 120 cycles in 20 h for both Co0.85Se and Pt/C. Therefore, the bifunctional Co0.85Se@NC electrode is feasible in practical metal–air batteries with enhanced cyclic stability.

Conclusion
In summary, we have achieved in situ coupling of Co0.85Se nanocrystals and N-doped carbon via one-step selenization of metal–organic frameworks. The resultant Co0.85Se@NC was used as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries for the first time. When used as an electrode for overall water splitting in alkaline solution, Co0.85Se@NC shows a low cell voltage of 1.76 V at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and good stability. At the same time the obtained Zn–air batteries based on Co0.85Se@NC exhibit a very low discharge–charge voltage gap (0.80 V at 10 mA cm−2) and long cycle life (up to 180 cycles). Its excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the coupling between Co0.85Se and NC, the Co–N–C structure, and the porous conductive carbon network. Our work establishes a facile strategy for the preparation of the Co0.85Se@NC hybrid as an efficient and stable trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries and this strategy can be extended to fabricate other nanomaterials for energy fields.
