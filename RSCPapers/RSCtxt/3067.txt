    , Accepted 7th July 2020First published on 17th July 2020AbstractSolar-driven interfacial evaporation for desalination is a very promising strategy for obtaining clean water while avoiding an energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the poor evaporation performance and long-term salt-resistance of conventional solar evaporators in seawater seriously hinder their applications for practical solar desalination. Here, we report a yolk@shell superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic solar evaporator for efficient and stable desalination. The evaporator was prepared by coating a superelastic superhydrophobic silicone sponge with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the top surface followed by changing the external surface to be superhydrophilic. The silicone/MWCNT evaporator features high sunlight absorption and photothermal conversion by the silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer, sufficient water supply and rapid salt dissolution in the superhydrophilic shell, and low heat loss enabled by the superhydrophobic yolk. Consequently, the evaporator shows a stable evaporation rate of 1.72 kg m−2 h−1 during a 200 h continuous solar desalination of seawater under 1 sun. Furthermore, 11.8 kg m−2 of clean water could be collected in a sealed setup using the evaporator upon 10 h continuous solar desalination. The high-performance evaporator may find practical applications for solar desalination of seawater and wastewater, as it can be prepared by a very simple procedure.
Introduction
During the World Economic Forum in 2015, water shortage was listed as the biggest global potential risk in the next decade. Now, water shortage is a huge problem facing sustainable human development.1–3 Desalination is of great interest for obtaining clean water from abundant seawater. However, the energy crisis and environmental hazards severely hinder further development of traditional desalination techniques, e.g., multi-stage flash evaporation and reverse osmosis.4–6 Energy-efficient solar-driven interfacial evaporation for desalination recently became a very promising approach to solve the water shortage and energy crises.7–9 Many novel solar evaporators with high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency have been developed by enhancing light absorption, improving the heat-insulating properties and optimizing the structure.10–16 It is generally recognized that an ideal solar evaporator should have the following characteristics:17,18 (i) broadband solar absorption and high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency for rapidly heating up the top surface and converting water into vapor, (ii) low thermal conductivity for localizing heat at the solid–vapor interface and reducing heat loss, and (iii) a hydrophilic micro-/nanostructure facilitating capillary water supply and vapor release.
In spite of fast progress, salt-fouling seriously hinders the application of solar evaporators in real world desalination.19,20 With the rapid water evaporation on the top surface of solar evaporators, the solute cannot diffuse back to bulk seawater in time, and thus precipitates on the surface or in the pores of the evaporators. Consequently, the solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency and water evaporation rate decay seriously, especially in the cases of long-time evaporation and high salt concentration. The salt-tolerance could be improved by dissolving salts in a timely manner via rapid water supply or by hindering salt precipitation via surface hydrophobization.19,21 However, excessive water supply causes serious heat loss and hydrophobization leads to insufficient contact between water and the top surface, which result in low solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency and water evaporation rate. Therefore, it is challenging to develop advanced solar evaporators with high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency and water evaporation rate during long-time desalination.
Here, we report a yolk@shell superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic solar evaporator for efficient and stable desalination. First, a superelastic superhydrophobic silicone sponge was prepared, and was coated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the top surface. Then, the external surface of the silicone/MWCNT sponge was made superhydrophilic using O2-plasma, forming the yolk@shell superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic evaporator. The silicone/MWCNT evaporator is composed of (1) a silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer for efficient sunlight absorption and photothermal conversion, (2) a superhydrophilic shell for sufficient water supply and rapid salt dissolution, and (3) a superhydrophobic yolk for reducing heat loss and facilitating self-floating. Consequently, the silicone/MWCNT evaporator showed a stable evaporation rate of 1.72 kg m−2 h−1 during a 200 h continuous solar desalination of seawater from the Yellow Sea under 1 sun, and no salt precipitated on the top surface of the evaporator. In addition, the evaporator maintained the evaporation performance after a series of tests under harsh conditions. Furthermore, 11.8 kg m−2 of clean water was collected in a sealed setup using the evaporator upon 10 h continuous solar desalination.
Experimental
Materials
Methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), dimethyldimethoxysilane (DMDMS), dihexadecyl dimethylammonium bromide, HAc, H2SO4, HNO3, Na2CO3, NaCl and methylene blue were provided by China National Medicines Co., Ltd. MWCNTs 20–40 nm in diameter were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. The length of MWCNTs is less than 5 μm. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Seawater was collected from the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea of China.
Synthesis of superhydrophobic silicone sponges
The superhydrophobic silicone sponges were synthesized by hydrolytic condensation of MTMS and DMDMS via a one-pot method.22 Typically, 38.6 mg of dihexadecyl dimethylammonium bromide and 40 mg of Na2CO3 were added into a glass bottle containing 77 mL of HAc aqueous solution (1 mM). Then, 14.3 g of MTMS and 8.4 g of DMDMS were sequentially added into the weak acidic buffer solution. The mixture was vibrated at 200 rpm and 30 °C for 1 h in a thermostatic incubator shaker. The resulting sol was transferred into a sealed reactor, which was placed in an oven at 95 °C for 24 h without any shaking to form a silicone hydrogel. The hydrogel was washed with water to remove trace residues and then dried in an oven at 60 °C under ambient pressure.
Fabrication of silicone/MWCNT evaporators
First, 1.0 g of MWCNTs was treated in 100 mL of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 (3:1, v/v) at 60 °C for 1 h, and then washed with deionized water until pH > 5.5 was reached. The acid activated MWCNTs were redispersed in ethanol to form a homogeneous suspension (0.125–2 mg mL−1). The silicone sponge was cut into cylinders 10 mm in height and 48 mm in diameter. Then, 10 mL of the MWCNT suspension was spray-coated onto the top surface of the silicone sponge using an air brush (INFINITY 2 in 1, Harder & Steenbeck, Germany) with 0.2 MPa N2. According to Table S1,† the concentration of the MWCNT suspension is 0.5 mg mL−1 unless otherwise specified. Finally, the silicone/MWCNT sponges were dried in an oven at 30 °C, and then activated using O2-plasma (HARRICK PLASMA PDC-002, USA) at 15 W to form the silicone/MWCNT evaporators. The O2-plasma treatment time was 6 min unless otherwise specified.
Solar-driven interfacial evaporation performance
The tests were carried out using a custom-made setup composed of a xenon lamp (HSX-FIUV 300, NBeT, Beijing, China) with a solar filter (AM 1.5, NBeT, Beijing, China), the evaporator in a test chamber (100 mL) and a balance connected to a computer at 24 ± 2 °C with a relative humidity of 20 ± 1%. The xenon lamp was used as the light source to emit simulated sunlight. The simulated sunlight irradiated on the evaporator floating on the water surface in the test chamber. The evaporator was wrapped with a thin layer of melamine sponge to fit the test chamber in order to reduce heat loss. The intensity of simulated sunlight was calibrated using an optical power meter (Thorlabs, Beijing NBET Technology Co., Ltd., China). The temperature on the top surface of the evaporator was recorded using an infrared camera (Testo 869, Germany). The balance was used for real-time measurement of water weight loss during solar evaporation. The water evaporation rate was calculated according to eqn (1).23 Evaporation rate = m/St(1)where m is the instantaneous water mass change due to evaporation, S is the evaporation area, and t is the evaporation time.
The solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (η) was calculated according to the following equations.24–26 η = m(hLV + Q)/q1Copt(2) hLV = 1.91846 × 106[T/(T − 33.91)]2 J kg−1(3)where m is the water evaporation rate (1.46 kg m−2 h−1) with the dark evaporation rate over the samples subtracted (0.106 kg m−2 h−1), hLV is the total enthalpy that is required to cause the transition of water from its liquid phase to the vapor phase, T (318.15 K) is the average surface temperature of the evaporator, Q is the sensible heat of water of unit mass (Q = C (T − T1), J kg−1, where C is the specific heat of water (4.2 J K−1 g−1) and T1 (296.15 K) is the initial temperature of water), q1 (kJ m−2 h−1) is the energy input of the incident light, and Copt is the optical concentration.
Characterization
The micrographs of samples were taken using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL). Before SEM observation, all samples were fixed on aluminum stubs and coated with gold (∼7 nm). Measurements of contact angle (CA) were performed at 25 °C using 10 μL water droplets on a Contact Angle System OCA20 (Dataphysics, Germany). The thermal conductivity of samples at room temperature and ambient pressure was determined via the transient plate heat source method (Hot Disk TPS2500, Sweden). The mechanical properties of samples were measured using a universal testing machine (CMT4304, Shenzhen SANS Test Machine Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with a 200 N load cell at room temperature. The tests were performed with a gauge length of 20 mm and a loading speed of 10 mm min−1. The transmittance and reflectance spectra were collected using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) from 200–2500 nm. The concentrations of ions in water samples were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS 7700, Agilent). The high-speed videos were recorded at 4000 fps using a high-speed video camera (FASTCAM Mini UX100, Photron, Japan). The total organic carbon concentration in the condensed fresh water was measured using a Vario TOC select (Elementar, Germany) employing a high-temperature combustion oxidation method.
Results and discussion
Preparation and physicochemical properties of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator

Fig. 1a shows the preparation of the silicone/MWCNT evaporators. First, the silicone sponge was synthesized by sol–gel reaction of MTMS and DMDMS in the presence of trace amounts of dihexadecyl dimethylammonium bromide and Na2CO3.22 The silicone sponge was chosen as a backbone of the solar evaporator because it is macroporous, thermally insulative, superhydrophobic, superelastic, mechanically robust and stable (Fig. 1b).22 A layer of MWCNTs was then applied onto the top surface of the silicone sponge via spray-coating. The MWCNTs attached to the porous skeleton of the silicone sponge via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces,27 and thus the band corresponding to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator was widened and enhanced (Fig. S1†). Finally, the external surface of the silicone/MWCNT sponge was converted to be superhydrophilic using O2-plasma, forming the yolk@shell superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic silicone/MWCNT evaporator (Fig. 1c). The top surface of the evaporator was macroporous and was covered with a uniform layer of MWCNTs, forming the silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer (Fig. 1d and e). Meanwhile, the yolk of the evaporator remained the same as the pristine silicone sponge (Fig. 1f).

The static water CA on the surface of the shell is 0°. A 10 μL water droplet falling from a height of 10 mm was absorbed by the shell of the evaporator within 7.5 ms (Fig. 2a and Movie S1†), demonstrating ultrafast water transport. Through the superhydrophilic shell, the water dyed with methylene blue could quickly climb to the top of the O2-plasma treated silicone sponge 50 mm in height in 10 s via capillary force (Fig. 2c). This is much faster than the water climbing speed in degreasing cotton, melamine sponge and cloth, which are frequently used for water transport during solar evaporation (Fig. S2 and Movie S2†).28–31 The ultrafast water transport in the shell is due to the combination of the macroporous surface and the abundant hydrophilic groups generated by O2-plasma treatment. In contrast, the yolk remained dry with a static water CA of 154.6° (Fig. S3†). A 10 μL water droplet falling from a height of 10 mm bounced up after impact on the yolk (Fig. 2b and Movie S3†), showing excellent superhydrophobicity. In addition, the superhydrophobic yolk provided the evaporator with self-floating properties even after 20 cycles of squeezing and releasing in water (Fig. S4†).

The insets are photographs of the evaporator in one compression–release cycle. (g) 100 cyclic compressive tests of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator with 50% strain. 
The light absorbance on the top surface of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator is about 98% in a wide spectral wavelength of 200–2500 nm including ultraviolet light, visible light and infrared light (Fig. 2d). The thermal conductivity of the evaporator in the dry state is as low as 0.039 W m−1 K−1 due to its unique porous structure filled with air (Fig. 2e).22 To simulate the solar evaporation state, the thermal conductivity of the evaporator saturated with water in the shell was also measured (0.228 W m−1 K−1, 37% water thermal conductivity). This is much smaller than that of conventional solar evaporators (0.43–0.457 W m−1 K−1).32–36 Since conventional evaporators are hydrophilic and fully wetted by water, the heat loss via thermal conduction and convection is serious, resulting in low solar evaporation performance. In contrast, the yolk@shell structure of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator greatly blocked heat dissipation.
The silicone/MWCNT evaporator is superelastic, mechanically robust and fatigue resistant. The 3D porous skeleton of the evaporator was gradually compressed with increasing the stress (Fig. 2f). The stress reached 0.35 MPa at 80% strain. The evaporator completely recovered its original shape after release of the stress. After 50 compression–release cycles with 50% strain, the compressive stress at 50% strain only decreased by 1.5 kPa, i.e. 94.5% of the original stress was retained (Fig. 2g). Further increase to 100 cycles had a negligible influence on the stress. Moreover, the evaporator did not show any damage in appearance and microstructure after the fatigue test (Fig. S5†).
The functions of each component of the porous silicone/MWCNT evaporator are summarized in Fig. 1g. (1) The silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer captures more sunlight via increasing the optical path and reducing light reflection,7,36–38 which facilitates photothermal conversion and vapor generation. (2) The superhydrophilic shell guarantees sufficient water supply, and promotes rapid dissolution and diffusion of salts to bulk water. (3) The superhydrophobic yolk locks heat in the silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer and makes the evaporator self-float on the water surface. The combined functions make the silicone/MWCNT evaporator very promising for efficient and stable desalination.
Solar evaporation properties of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator
The solar evaporation properties of the silicone/MWCNT evaporators were tested using a custom-made setup composed of a xenon lamp (simulated sunlight), the evaporator in a test chamber and a balance connected to a computer at 24 ± 2 °C with a relative humidity of 20 ± 1% (Fig. S6†). Fig. 3a shows the water mass changes under three different conditions. Without the evaporator, the water evaporation rate was 0.36 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun, while the evaporation rate reached 1.46 kg m−2 h−1 in the presence of the evaporator under the same conditions, ∼4 times that of pure water. Water vapor could be clearly seen under 2 sun or more (Fig. S7†), and the evaporation rate increased evidently to 6.74 kg m−2 h−1 under 5 sun (Fig. S8†).
 Fig. 3  (a) Water mass change versus time under different conditions. (b) Solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator with that of references for comparison. 
The solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator was 92.4% under 1 sun and increased to 95.2% under 5 sun (Fig. 3b), which is higher than that of the reported solar evaporators.7,8,11,39–45 The very high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency arises from three major factors. (i) 98% of the incident light was captured by the silicone/MWCNT layer and MWCNTs could efficiently convert solar energy into thermal energy (Fig. S9†).46 Also, the porous silicone/MWCNT layer with a hierarchical micro-/nanostructure provided a large heating area in contact with water, causing a rapid water temperature increase on the top surface from 22 °C to 45 °C in 6 min under 1 sun (Fig. S10 and S11†). (ii) The superhydrophilic shell reduced the water meniscus at the liquid–vapor interface via the capillary effect, resulting in a thinner water film close to the three-phase contact line and thus accelerating vapor release.47 (iii) The unique yolk@shell structure endowed the evaporator with low thermal conductivity, which locked heat on the top surface for efficient water evaporation and reduced heat loss via thermal conduction and convection. On the other hand, the radiation heat loss is ∼5%, the convection heat loss is ∼4%, and the conduction heat loss is ∼3%. The detailed calculation of heat losses can be seen in the ESI.†
Salt-tolerance of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator
Long-term salt-tolerance of solar evaporators is very important for real world desalination.20,48 The salt-tolerance of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator was studied in detail. Fig. 4a shows the water mass changes of different water samples under 1 sun. Surprisingly, no obvious difference among the mass change curves could be seen, which means that salt has no obvious influence on the water evaporation rate of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator. Considering that the daily average sunlight exposure time is 10 h (8:00–18:00), the long-term salt-tolerance of the evaporator was assessed. Fig. 4b shows the evaporation rates of different water samples during 10 h continuous solar evaporation under 1 sun. The evaporation rates have the same trend. In the first 4 h, the evaporation rates gradually increased to about 1.65 kg m−2 h−1 because of the surface temperature increase and energy enrichment.8,19 Then, the evaporation rates were stable during 4–7 h although some precipitated salt reduced the light-to-heat conversion area (Fig. 4c and S12†). This is because the precipitated salt in the center will accelerate evaporation of the surrounding water, as the water film becomes thinner and thus the temperature rises (Fig. S13†).47 In addition, the temperature of bulk water increased gradually in the solar evaporation process (Fig. 4b), and thus less energy was needed to vaporize the bulk water when it was transported to the evaporator surface. This is also helpful to offset the negative effect of salt precipitation on the evaporation rate. In the last stage, the evaporation rates decreased gradually due to more salt precipitation on the top surface and in the pores. The evaporation rate in 10 h reached ∼16 kg m−2 for 3.5 wt% NaCl solution and real seawater. Furthermore, the evaporator showed a self-cleaning behavior and the precipitated salt gradually disappeared in 5 h once the light was turned off (Fig. 4c and S12†). This is due to the salt concentration gradient on the top surface. The surrounding water moved to the center on the top surface, and the precipitated salt gradually dissolved and diffused back to the bulk saline solutions.

(c) Salt precipitation (1 sun) and salt ablation (light off) processes of 3.5 wt% NaCl solution on the top surface of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator. (d) Evaporation rates of seawater from the Yellow Sea in the 90 h solar evaporation test with 10 h continuous 1 sun illumination and 5 h light off in each cycle and with seawater replenishment after each cycle. (e) Evaporation rates of 3.5 wt% NaCl solution in a 30 cycle solar evaporation test with 1 h illumination under 1 sun in each cycle. The silicone/MWCNT evaporator was washed with deionized water after each cycle. (f) Evaporation rate and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency in 3.5% NaCl solution under 1 sun with those of references for comparison. 

Fig. 4d shows the evaporation rates of seawater from the Yellow Sea in the 90 h solar evaporation test with 10 h continuous 1 sun illumination and 5 h light off in each cycle and with seawater replenishment after each cycle. The evaporation rate showed regular changes and remained very high (1.42–1.70 kg m−2 h −1) under 1 sun over 90 h. Also, the salt precipitation–ablation phenomenon appeared regularly. In addition, the evaporation rate of the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was quite stable in the 30 cycle solar evaporation test with 1 h illumination under 1 sun in each cycle (Fig. 4e). These results demonstrate excellent long-term salt-tolerance of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator. Furthermore, the evaporation rate and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator in real seawater or 3.5 wt% NaCl solution are obviously higher than the reported data (Fig. 4f).20,21,43,48–54 The high evaporation rate, high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency and excellent long-term salt-tolerance are mainly attributed to the merits of the evaporator summarized in Fig. 1g.
The adaptability of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator to various harsh conditions was further explored. We soaked the evaporator in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 30 d to simulate the solar evaporation process, and then measured its wettability. It was found that the shell of the evaporator was still superhydrophilic with a water CA of ∼0° (Fig. S14†). The top surface of the evaporator did not show any change after immersion in liquid N2 (−196 °C, 1 h), boiling water (94 °C, 2 h), deionized water under ultrasonication (100 W, 8 h), 2 M H2SO4 solution (30 d), 2 M NaOH solution (30 d) and 2 M NaCl solution (30 d) as shown in Fig. 5a. Furthermore, the evaporation rate of deionized water remained very stable after these tests (Fig. 5b and S15†). In addition, the pH of aqueous solutions has a negligible effect on the evaporation rate (Fig. S16†). These results demonstrate very high stability of the evaporator even under harsh conditions. This is due to the high stability of MWCNTs and robustness of the silicone sponge.22 The excellent stability of the evaporator paved the way for practical desalination and wastewater treatment via solar evaporation.

To further enhance the salt-tolerance, a new silicone/MWCNT evaporator2.0 with a larger superhydrophilic shell (2.6 mm) was prepared by extending the O2-plasma treatment time to 14 min (Fig. 6a). When the evaporator2.0 was used for solar desalination of seawater from the Yellow Sea, no salt precipitated on the top surface of the evaporator during a 200 h continuous solar evaporation test under 1 sun (Fig. 6b).43,51 Every 10 h, the evaporation rate rapidly increased to 1.72 kg m−2 h−1 in 5 h and then remained almost constant (Fig. 6c). The trend of the evaporation rate did not show any change in 200 h. All these results prove the ultrahigh salt-tolerance of the evaporator2.0. The ultrahigh salt-tolerance is attributed to the larger superhydrophilic shell, which provides sufficient water in time to reduce the salt concentration gradient and avoid salt precipitation during the long-term solar desalination.

The seawater was replenished every 10 h during the test. 
Water collection via solar desalination
A simple sealed experimental setup was designed to study the performance of the silicone/MWCNT evaporator for clean water collection via solar desalination (Fig. 7a). Vapor was continuously generated on the top surface of the evaporator under 1 sun, and then condensed on the glass panel and dropped into the tank on the right. After 10 h continuous solar desalination of seawater from the Yellow Sea, 11.8 kg m−2 of clean water was collected. The collection efficiency of clean water is 71.5% using the sealed setup, considering that ∼16 kg m−2 of water evaporated into the open atmosphere when not using the sealed setup. The evaporation rate in the sealed setup is obviously lower than that in the open atmosphere because of the following reasons. (i) The illumination was reduced from 1 sun to 0.9 sun by the glass panel. (ii) The vapor condensed on the glass panel in the form of microdroplets (Fig. 7b), which resulted in further decrease of illumination intensity due to light reflection and refraction. (iii) The humidity in the sealed setup was very high (Fig. 7c), which greatly inhibited water evaporation. Thus, to enhance the collection efficiency of clean water, (i) new materials should be used instead of the glass panel to reduce solar energy loss and (ii) novel micro-/nanostructures should be introduced on the wall of the sealed setup to accelerate the vapor condensation, reduce the humidity and promote the transport of condensed water to the tank.

(b) Photograph of the sealed setup showing condensation of vapor on the glass panel. (c) Changes of temperature and relative humidity over time in the sealed setup. (d) Concentration changes of major ions before and after solar desalination of simulated seawater and wastewater. 

Fig. 7d shows the concentration changes of the four major ions before and after solar desalination of the simulated seawater. The concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ decreased from 10525, 1106, 385 and 398 mg L−1 to 4.91, 1.45, 0.54 and 0.85 mg L−1, respectively. The removal efficiencies of all the ions are above 99.8%. In addition, the concentrations of these ions in the collected water are far below the drinking water standards defined by the World Health Organization (WHO, indicated by the dashed lines).55,56 The total organic carbon concentration in the condensed fresh water is as low as 8.5 ppm. Furthermore, the silicone/MWCNT evaporator could also be used for solar desalination of wastewater. The concentrations of two representative heavy metal ions (Cu2+ and Zn2+) decreased from 1280 and 1300 mg L−1 to 0.087 and 0.125 mg L−1, respectively. The removal efficiencies are above 99.99%. Also, we carefully observed the collected water and bulk water via SEM, but did not find any MWCNTs. The leaching risk of the MWCNTs and other nanomaterials as well as organics to the vapor and bulk water should be considered for designing new solar evaporators and their practical applications.
Conclusions
In summary, a mechanically robust and chemically stable yolk@shell superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic solar evaporator was prepared for efficient and stable desalination. The silicone/MWCNT evaporator is composed of a silicone/MWCNT hybrid layer for efficient sunlight absorption and photothermal conversion, a superhydrophilic shell for sufficient water supply and rapid salt dissolution, and a superhydrophobic yolk for reducing heat loss and facilitating self-floating. Thus, the evaporator showed a high and stable evaporation rate of 1.72 kg m−2 h−1 without salt precipitation on the top surface during long-term (200 h) continuous solar desalination of seawater from the Yellow Sea under 1 sun. The ultrahigh salt-tolerance is attributed to the superhydrophilic shell, which provides sufficient water in time to reduce the salt concentration gradient and avoid salt precipitation during solar desalination. In addition, the evaporator maintained the evaporation performance after a series of tests under harsh conditions. Furthermore, 11.8 kg m−2 of clean water could be collected in a sealed setup using the evaporator upon 10 h continuous solar desalination. Considering the high performance and simple preparation method, the evaporator may find applications for solar desalination of seawater and wastewater. To fully meet the practical solar desalination requirements, the water evaporation rate and collection efficiency of clean water in the sealed setup should be further enhanced by accelerating the vapor condensation, reducing the humidity and promoting the transport of condensed water to the tank.
