    , Accepted 17th March 2023First published on 20th March 2023AbstractWidespread practical application of organic solar cells requires their long-term operational stability, a prerequisite which has not yet been achieved. Achieving long device lifetimes depends on the availability of intrinsically stable absorber materials and a thorough understanding of their degradation pathways; both of these aspects are still insufficiently explored. In this work, we present a systematic study of a series of 18 conjugated polymers composed of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) subunits combined with various kinds of other building blocks. It has been shown that the DPP unit itself substantially accelerates the degradation of conjugated polymers due to its favorable photochemical transformation into, as we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate, 1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)but-2-yne-1,4-diamine (major product) and 1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzene (minor product). Using a set of complementary analytical techniques, we compared the degradation rates of various polymers and established some important correlations between the molecular structures of the materials and their intrinsic photostability. The revealed relationships provide valuable new guidelines for furthering the rational design of new organic absorber materials with largely enhanced photochemical stability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells represent an exciting technology, which features potential for multiple unique applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (PVs), for example, self-powered smart windows, textile-integrated PVs (e.g., wearable electronics), efficient energy harvesting under indoor illumination, powering different types of Internet of Things (IoT) remote sensors and other applications.1–6 The efficiency of organic solar cells has been steadily growing and now exceeds 18% for the best certified small-area laboratory samples.7,8 There is also substantial progress in the development of high throughput roll-to-roll printing and coating technologies for production of flexible and lightweight organic photovoltaic panels at a low-cost.9,10
While the main goal of research in the field of organic PVs has been to increase the device efficiency, device upscaling10–12 and the operational stability of organic solar cells13,14 have received much less attention. However, it is well known that organic solar cells are prone to various degradation pathways under exposure to light and heat, which limits operational lifetimes of PV devices and thus represent the main obstacle for their mass application.13–17
While the degradation of organic semiconductors and solar cells under their simultaneous exposure to light and the ambient atmosphere has been actively explored,18,19 the intrinsic photochemical and thermal stability remains the least studied. The degradation induced by ambient species (oxygen and moisture) can be effectively suppressed by encapsulation with high-quality barrier films. In contrast, intrinsic aging processes induced by light and heat can hardly be avoided under realistic solar cell operational conditions.
The main challenge for studying the intrinsic photostability of organic absorber materials is related to the limited number of sufficiently sensitive techniques capable of revealing relatively minor changes in the structure and composition of organic molecules under exposure to light or heat under anoxic conditions. Previously, we used electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to study the dynamics of light-induced degradation of conjugated polymers.20–22 However, some of the materials degrade via alternative pathways, which do not lead to the appearance of free radical species which would be detectable by ESR. More recently, we have applied gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which revealed the facile nature of light-induced cross-linking of different types of conjugated polymers and small molecules.23 However, GPC appeared to be a mostly qualitative technique since it monitors the decrease in material solubility (besides some changes in the molecular weight) under light exposure, which is a complex parameter depending on multiple variables such as the length of solubilizing side chains, aggregation behaviour, initial molecular weight, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to use GPC analysis for any quantitative assessment of intrinsic photostability of different materials.
It should be emphasized that there is an urgent need for developing at once simple and universal tools for quantitative benchmarking of the intrinsic photostability of different types of organic absorbers and establishing “structure-stability” relationships to guide further organic PV material design. This task was solved in the context of the investigation of extrinsic photostability, since the photooxidation of organic absorber materials in air could be easily monitored by UV-vis and infrared spectroscopy.24–26 However, on the one hand, photooxidation resistance usually does not correlate well with intrinsic photostability. On the other hand, massive light-induced cross-linking of organic absorber materials under anoxic conditions does not lead to significant changes in optical spectra, at least, not within reasonable experimental timescales (<8000 h).
In the present work, we propose an approach for accelerated tests of intrinsic photostability of organic absorber materials. In particular, the use of a hard UV light source integrated inside glove boxes with a well-controlled anoxic atmosphere has allowed us to perform a rapid assessment of the photostability of a series of conjugated polymers (Fig. 1). Also, our methodology has revealed some important correlations between the material molecular structures and their degradation rates.

Results and discussion
The designed experimental setup was based on 172 W bacteriocidic UV lamps typically used for ozone generation in air (Fig. S1, ESI,†). However, in our setup these lamps were placed in a stainless-steel chamber integrated inside MBraun glove boxes filled with pure nitrogen (O2 and H2O levels were below 0.1 ppm). Therefore, no ozone could be generated under these conditions, while the UV irradiation induces intrinsic photodegradation of organic absorber materials without involving the ambient species.
First, we verified that the behaviour of conjugated polymer films under these harsh experimental conditions corresponds to light-induced material degradation trends revealed previously. Fig. 2a shows the characteristic evolution of the GPC profiles of the P3HT films.
 Fig. 2  The evolution of the GPC profiles (a) and UV-vis absorption spectra (b) of P3HT films exposed to hard UV illumination. Evolution of the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of a P3HT film within 38 h of aging (c). The dashed ellipse in (a) highlights the appearance of higher molecular weight fractions produced via cross-linking of P3HT chains. 
A new feature at short retention times (<13 min) corresponding to the high molecular weight cross-linking products appears already after 15 min of aging under UV light; longer exposure to UV light is accompanied by the gradual decay of the GPC signal intensity due to the loss of the material solubility and formation of insoluble cross-linked products. The films become completely insoluble within 3–4 h under UV light exposure, which is ca. 10 times faster as compared to experiments reported previously.23 Thus, illumination with hard UV irradiation results in the same material behaviour, but within a much shorter time than under white light exposure.
Notably, the P3HT films showed just subtle changes in the UV-vis spectra within the first 3 h of aging, when GPC revealed an almost complete loss of solubility. However, longer exposure to UV light led to a characteristic photobleaching of the polymer film as shown in Fig. 2c. The presented spectral dynamics, i.e., the gradual decrease in the absorbance and blue shift of the absorption maximum, strongly resembles the behavior of P3HT films in previously reported photooxidation experiments (photobleaching in air).24–26 However, the degradation pathways realized under anoxic conditions inside the glove box are completely different from those occurring in air and should reflect the intrinsic photostability of the material.
All studied polymers demonstrated similar photobleaching behaviours, but the rates of degradation were found to be substantially different depending on the material's chemical structure. Fig. 3a–d show a representative set of examples featuring the evolution of the absorption spectra of structurally similar polymers P4–P7 upon aging. It is noteworthy that P5 differs from P4 only by the presence of two fluorine substituents in the benzothiadiazole unit. P6 differs from P4 by a single atom in a repeating unit: S in benzothiadiazole (P4) is replaced by O in benzoxadiazole (P6). Finally, P7 represents an analog of P6 with additional oligoether side chains.

Fig. 3e provides a general overview of the degradation dynamics of all studied materials including the references P3HT and PCDTBT, which is obtained by plotting the film absorbance at maximum as a function of the aging time. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the data on the optoelectronic and physicochemical properties of polymers P1–P18 as well as the experimental k = A20/A0 values, which could be considered as a measure of the material photostability (A0 and A20 represent film absorbance before and after 20 h of UV light exposure). Indeed, higher k values are observed in materials with higher stability. The analysis of the obtained set of data allowed us to reveal some correlations between the materials structure and their photostability. First, one could notice that replacing the benzothiadiazole X unit in P4 (Fig. 3a) with diflurobenzothiadiazole in P5 (Fig. 3b) substantially accelerates the degradation. Similar observations could also be made for another pair of congener polymers: P17 and P18, which differ only by the substituents in the benzothiadiazole units. This leads to the surprising observation that the fluorine substitution has an adverse effect on the polymer photostability. Similar or even stronger effects are caused by the introduction of octyloxy substituents in benzothiadiazole units (P16), which leads to much faster degradation as compared to the congener polymer incorporating non-modified benzothiadiazole units (P15).
Second, polymers with benzoxadiazole X units, such as e.g., P6 (Fig. 3c), degrade much faster than their congener polymers with benzothiadiazole blocks (e.g., P4, Fig. 3a). Thus, replacing a single atom (S with O) in the benzothiadiazole block strongly accelerates polymer photodegradation. The situation becomes much more severe when benzoxadiazole units are loaded with oxygen-rich ether substituents as in the case of P7: this polymer undergoes a complete decomposition under light exposure within 1–2 h (Fig. 3d). This behaviour could be explained by the metastable nature of the N–O bonds, which promotes light-induced reactions and rearrangements, likely leading to the formations of more thermodynamically stable CO bonds (see below).
The aging dynamics of the studied polymers (Fig. 3e) allowed us to compare their photostabilities. Apparently, the presence of DPP units makes P1–P18 less stable in comparison with the reference material PCDTBT. Only a few polymers were shown to be more stable than P3HT: P10 with a naphthalene diimide X unit, P2 and P3 with thiophene and terthiophene blocks, and P9 with a thiadiazoloquinoxaline unit. The overall stability ranking of polymers with representative X units is shown in Fig. 3f. Thiazolothiazole enables somewhat higher stability than benzothiadiazole, whereas such X units as benzodithiophenedione and quinoxaline have an intermediate position between non-substituted benzothiadiazole and its difluorinated derivative.
It is worthy of note that UV aging behavior of conjugated polymers P1–P18 is not affected significantly by the origin of the material and shows very good batch-to-batch reproducibility. Indeed, we investigated two independently synthesized and purified batches of P5 and three batches of PCDTBT of different origins and they demonstrated very consistent aging dynamics as shown in Fig. S2a, ESI.† The sample-to-sample (or film-to-film) reproducibility of UV aging dynamics was also found to be quite decent as illustrated in Fig. S2b, ESI.† However, we found that the side chains attached to the polymer backbone could alter the aging rate significantly. For example, polymer P14a bearing bulkier side chains as compared to P14 (structures shown in Fig. S2c, ESI†) demonstrated considerably faster photobleaching (Fig. S2b, ESI†). This result could be explained by the fact that larger alkyl side chains make the polymer films less compact, which means that polymer chains have more freedom for possible structure rearrangements and the volatile aging products could also be easily removed from the film. Thus, alkyl side chains should also be considered along with the polymer backbone when designing materials with enhanced photostability.
The photobleaching experiments under UV light exposure seem to be very informative and could be considered a straightforward approach for benchmarking the intrinsic photostability of conjugated polymers. Still, the obtained results should be independently verified by some complementary analytical techniques. As such, we fabricated lateral photoresistors with thin films of polymers P4–P7 (Fig. 4a) and investigated the evolution of their dynamic photoresponse to white light pulses (LED) (Fig. 4b) during aging under UV light exposure. The characteristic parameter used to characterize the electrical performance of the polymer film was the photoresponse magnitude calculated at the ratio of the current under LED illumination (IL, maximum of the recorded pulse) divided by the value of dark current just preceding the light pulse (ID). Fig. 4c shows that polymers P4 and P7 provided the highest photoresponse before the light exposure. However, the photoresponse of the devices based on P7 became negligibly small (IL/ID ∼ 1) after just 2.5 h of aging, which illustrates low photostability of this material. In contrast, the devices based on the most stable polymer P4 showed good photoresponse even after 10 h of aging under the same conditions. Similarly, the photoresponse of P5 degrades slower as compared to that of P6, which proves that P5 is more stable than P6. Thus, the photostability assessment for polymers P4–P7 based on the results of the electrical measurements is in agreement with the stability ranking provided by the photobleaching experiments.

Light-induced degradation of polymer films could also be monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 5, for P5–P7. Irradiation of the films with UV light results in a rapid decay and considerable broadening of all peaks in the FTIR spectra. One can easily notice that P5 is much more stable than P6 and P7, while the degradation of the latter polymer occurs particularly fast compared to the others. In order to draw a quantitative comparison of the aging behaviours of P5–P7, we plotted the normalized absorbance of the peaks corresponding to the carbonyl groups (1663–1671 cm−1) as a function of the aging time. The obtained plot (Fig. 5d) matches quite well the aging dynamics of the polymers P5–P7 assessed by UV-vis optical spectroscopy and presented in Fig. 3e. Thus, the photobleaching behaviour of conjugated polymers under UV light exposure in an inert atmosphere could be quantitatively monitored in the visible and infrared spectral ranges.

Magenta arrows point to the new CO bands that appeared upon aging. The photobleaching dynamics of the carbonyl group IR absorption peaks upon aging for polymers P1–P3 (d). 
The change in the FTIR spectra of polymer films during aging provides some information on the evolution of their chemical structures. In particular, one can notice that all three studied polymers demonstrate the appearance of spectral features at 1700–1725 cm−1 corresponding to new carbonyl (CO) groups formed upon photochemical aging. This effect is particularly strong in the case of benzoxadiazole-based polymers P6 and P7, which strongly suggests that high-energy N–O oxadiazole bonds are involved in the formation of these new carbonyl functions.
Further insight into the degradation behaviour of conjugated polymers was gained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS survey spectra revealed the surface composition of the samples before and after 200 h of exposure to UV light. The atomic concentrations of C and N did not change significantly, whereas the content of S decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 and fluorine was eliminated almost completely (F concentration dropped by an order of magnitude). These results suggest that both fluorine- and sulfur-containing functional groups are largely responsible for the observed photochemical degradation of the conjugated polymers. The selected high-resolution XPS spectra of P5 and P7 are shown in Fig. 6. The C 1s spectrum of P7 reveals photochemical cleavage of ether side chains (C–O peaks decay significantly), whereas new features corresponding to CO and COOH functional groups appear at higher energy (Fig. 6a).27 This result concurs with the FTIR spectroscopy data suggesting that new carbonyl-type functional groups are formed presumably through structural rearrangements of the active chemical bonds, e.g., N–O–N within benzoxadiazole. The S 2p XPS spectra of polymers P5–P7 showed massive decay of the bands at 163–166 eV, which suggests that thiophene rings lose sulfur (likely as H2S or SOx species) upon exposure to UV light. The benzothiadiazole units within P5 appear to be even less photochemically stable since the high-energy feature at 166–168 eV, which corresponds to the N–S–N moiety, completely disappears after light exposure (Fig. 6b). Similar behaviour was also observed for PCDTBT (Fig. 6e). Furthermore, polymer P5 almost completely loses fluorine atoms upon aging (Fig. 6c), which evidences that fluorine substitution indeed decreases the photochemical stability of benzothiadiazole units as discussed above. All polymers with DPP units demonstrate strong changes in the N 1s spectra: the intense band at 400.1 eV corresponding to amide groups decays, whereas a new intense band appears at 398.8 eV, which is characteristic for pyridine type CN bonds (Fig. 6d).28 Notably, no such spectral changes were observed in the XPS N 1s spectra of PCDTBT, which does not comprise DPP units (Fig. 6f).

To shed some light on the mechanism of the photochemical degradation of DPP-based materials, we thoroughly studied two conjugated small molecules SM1 and SM2 both incorporating a DPP block (Fig. 7). These materials undergo facile photodegradation upon exposure to UV-light (Fig. S3a–c, ESI†). Some of the aging products were completely insoluble in organic solvents, so they are presumably represented mostly by heavily cross-linked species (Fig. S3d and e, ESI†). A much faster degradation rate is observed for compound SM1 than in the case of SM2 which suggests that the alpha protons of thiophene rings actively participate in the cross-linking reactions.
 Fig. 7  Molecular structures of model SM1 and SM2 compounds with DPP core units. 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry analysis was carried out for the films of SM1 and SM2 and also for the polymers P6 and P7 deposited directly on a metal sample plate and exposed to UV light for various periods of time. The MALDI TOF mass spectra of SM2 films revealed a series of characteristic peaks, evidencing that UV light causes the elimination of alkyl side chains and cleavage of benzodithiophene units. Some representative mass spectra and molecular structures of the identified species are presented in Fig. S4, ESI.†
Importantly, the peak with m/z = 300 which is characteristic of the DPP block linked with two thiophene units (Th-DPP-Th or X2Fig. 8) was dominant in the mass spectra after 30 min of UV exposure, and the signal with m/z = 243 and series of peaks with m/z = 249, 251 and 253 were also quite intense. The m/z = 243 peak became one of the most intense for the films after 20 h of aging. Interestingly, we also observed intense peaks corresponding to the higher molecular weight species including the dimer of SM2 (m/z = 1576) and a similar dimer, which eliminated two benzodithiophene units (m/z = 1310).
 Fig. 8  The proposed mechanism of the photolysis of alkylated DPP units based on the experimental mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy data. 
The MALDI TOF mass spectra of SM1 films were quite noisy at low m/z values, so the major information was extracted from the region with m/z > 1000 (Fig. S5, ESI†). In particular, we revealed an intense peak with m/z = 1159 corresponding to an adduct of SM1 (m/z = 861) with Th-DPP-Th (X2, m/z = 300), which evidences that light illumination causes the elimination of alkyl side chains. Indeed, another intense peak with m/z = 1141 or m/z = 1142 (depending on conditions) was due to the addition of eliminated C20H40 alkene to the SM1 molecule. Furthermore, a series of intense signals of other adducts with m/z = 1109, 1110, 1111 and 1112 and a weaker peak with m/z = 1104 (corresponds to m/z = 243 without SM1 mass) were also observed. The proposed molecular structures of the corresponding adducts are shown in Fig. S5d, ESI.†
The MALDI TOF mass spectra of thin films of polymers P6 and P7 exposed to UV light also revealed characteristic peaks with m/z = 300, m/z = 248, 250 and 252 and m/z = 243 (Fig. S6, ESI†). Thus, these peaks correspond to the common products formed upon photodegradation of all materials incorporating DPP units in their molecular frameworks.
The mass spectrometry data evidence that alkyl side chains are eliminated from solubilized DPP units (X0 in Fig. 8) in the form of the corresponding alkenes (X1), thus producing dealkylated Th-DPP-Th (X2), which is responsible for the peak with m/z = 300. The molecular structures of the species with m/z = 243 and m/z = 248, 250 and 252 have to be deduced in a less straightforward way. We strongly believe that photolysis of the DPP core proceeds via several parallel pathways. The major one involves photochemical CO extrusion with the formation of a diimine intermediate I1 (Fig. 8), which could be fully reduced with the formation of diamines X3a (m/z = 248), X3b (m/z = 250) and X3c (m/z = 252). Alternatively, Th-DPP-Th (X2) could undergo photochemical retro-Beckmann rearrangement leading presumably to the formation of dinitrozo compound I2, which reductively eliminates NO and forms dithienylbenzene X4 (m/z = 242). It should be emphasized that photochemical cross-linking of molecules generates active hydrogen, which provides an appropriate environment for reductive conversion of I1 to X3a–c and I2 to X4.
NMR spectroscopy was used to support the conclusions made on the basis of MALDI TOF mass spectrometry data. However, each 1 × 1 inch substrate with a 50 nm thick film contains only about 50 micrograms of the material available for NMR analysis. UV exposure induces crosslinking in thin films of SM1 and SM2 which makes them partially insoluble in organic solvents, thus leading to a further reduction in the amount of the soluble sample. Therefore, each 1H NMR spectrum was accumulated for 3–10 h, whereas more complicated experiments (COSY, 13C NMR, etc.) could not be performed. The 1H NMR spectra of SM1 and SM2 films dissolved in CS2-acetone-d6 solvent before and after UV light exposure are compared in Fig. S7 and S8, ESI.† One may observe that both SM1 and SM2 degraded only partially after 10–20 h of UV light exposure. Most importantly, the aging products formed from SM1 and SM2 are characterized by the same sets of new signals which appeared in the NMR spectra as shown in Fig. S9, ESI.† MALDI-TOF mass spectra of these solutions revealed the signals of molecular ions of SM1 and SM2 together with the same new signal for both samples with m/z = 332 (Fig. S10, ESI†). The fact that mass spectra of the samples collected for NMR analysis do not match the spectra of thin films exposed to UV light could be explained by the secondary reactions of some aging products shown in Fig. 8 with the CS2/acetone-d6 solvent mixture used for NMR analysis. Indeed, it is well known that amines readily react with CS2 forming isothiocyanates, so compound X3a could be easily converted to X5 with m/z = 332 as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, this finding unambiguously supports the presence of X3a as a major product formed upon photolysis of the ThDPPTh framework.
 Fig. 9  The formation of diisothiocyanate X5 from diamine X3a upon treatment with CS2. 
The new signals that appeared in the NMR spectra of the SM1 and SM2 films exposed to UV light and then dissolved in CS2/acetone-d6 could be confidently attributed to the identified molecular species. Thus, two multiplets at 3.90 and 3.95 ppm correspond to two non-equivalent protons of the alkene group RR1CHaHb (product X1 in Fig. 8), which also matches literature data for these compounds.29 Other signals are multiplets at 7.43, 7.14 and 7.07 ppm of almost the same intensity, which could be attributed to the three protons of the thienyl substituent of compound X5 (Fig. 8). A broad signal at 5.28 ppm (N–H protons) also matches the structure of X5.
Thus, the photochemical degradation of SM1 and SM2 (as well as polymers P6 and P7) produced the corresponding alkenes X1 and diaminoacetylene X3a as soluble products. The product X4, which was identified by mass spectrometry, probably remained within the insoluble part of the film or was formed in too small amounts for detection by NMR spectroscopy. Thus, the MALDI TOF and NMR spectroscopy data are fully consistent with each other and reveal that UV photodegradation of DPP-based compounds proceeds with an unexpectedly high selectivity thus producing only a very few molecular species.
Additional insight into the possible mechanism of the photochemical degradation of DPP derivatives was provided by theoretical DFT calculations by considering the thermodynamics of the pathways described in Fig. 8 both on the S0 potential energy surface (PES) and the T1 PES. We begin with the first two steps of Fig. 8, where the asterisk indicates the adiabatic T1 state: X0 → X0(T1) ΔG(338 K) = +0.98 eV(1) X0 → 2X1 + X2 ΔG(338 K) = −0.51 eV(2) X0(T1) → 2X1 + X2(T1) ΔG(338 K) = −0.49 eV(3)Here, we can see that the elimination of the alkene happens in a facile fashion upon illumination. The CO extrusion pathway may produce either X3a (m/z = 248). We assume that the source of hydrogens for this process is the dimerization of the ThDPPT (X2) units, as described above. The corresponding reactions, where the second indicated value of ΔG is where P3-nH2n = 0–2 is prepared in the triplet state, are: 5X2 → X3a + 2[X2]2 + 2CO ΔG(338 K) = +0.82 eV, +1.00* eV(4) 7X2 → X3b + 3[X2]2 + 2CO ΔG(338 K) = +2.52 eV, +1.06* eV(5) 9X2 → X3c + 4[X2]2 + 2CO ΔG(338 K) = +1.21 eV, +0.96* eV(6)
Considering the significant amount of dimerizations required, these processes are clearly entropically unfavorable. For example, at 0 K reaction (5) is predicted to be near exothermic or slightly exothermic: ΔE(0 K) = 0.16 eV, −0.1* eV.
For the retro-Beckmann process we assume that the departing NO group results in N2+ O2 the latter being in the triplet state: 2X2(S0) + X2(T1) → X4(S0) + [X2]2(S0) + N2(S0) + O2(T0) ΔG(338 K) = +0.92 eV(7) X2(S0) + 2X2(T1) → X4(T1) + [X2]2(S0) + N2(S0) + O2(T0) ΔG(338 K) = +0.67 eV(8) 3X2 → X4 + [X2]2 + 2NO ΔG(338 K) = +3.71 eV, +3.46* eV(9)
These reactions are, contrary to (3–5), entropically favored and are quite endothermic at 0 K: ΔE(0 K) = 1.73 eV (for 7) and 1.47 eV (for 8). As such, we expect these reactions to be more dominant at higher temperatures and reactions (3–5) at lower temperatures.
Experimental
Materials
The studied polymers were synthesized following known procedures: P1,30P2,31P3,32P4,33P5,34P6,35P7,36P8,37P9,38P10,39P11,40P12,41P13,42 and P14–P18.43,44 PCDTBT and P3HT were products of FOMaterials Ltd (Russian Federation). Soda lime microscopy glass slides (ISOLAB GmbH) and ITO-covered glass slides (15 Ohm per sq., Kintec, China) were used as substrates for the polymer films. Anhydrous chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene were used as solvents (Sigma-Aldrich).
Aging experiments
The aging setups were based on 172 W bacteriocidic UV lamps (J-19180 Ozone), which were fixed inside a stainless-steel box placed in an inert nitrogen atmosphere inside an MBRaun glove box. The fan cooling of the setup resulted in an equilibrium temperature of 65 °C. UV light power at the sample holder was ca. 35 mW cm−2. The sample holder incorporated multiple cells; each could accommodate a single 25 × 25 mm sample. These cells were numbered and the incident light flux was calibrated for each cell. Only the cells with the same light flux within a 5% error were used in the experiments. The polymer films deposited on glass substrates were illuminated from the top and their aging was monitored by periodic measurements of the optical UV-vis absorption spectra in the same glove box without any exposure to the ambient atmosphere.
Spectroscopy
Avantes AvaSpec2048 and Ocean Optics OIQE-SET-02121 fiber spectrometers integrated into glove boxes were used for UV-vis spectra measurements. FTIR spectra were measured from the films deposited on CaF2 substrates in ATR mode using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two instrument with a KRS5 prism inside the glove box. XPS spectra were measured from the polymer films deposited on conductive ITO glass substrates using a PHI XPS 5000 Versaprobe spectrometer (ULVAC-Physical Electronics, USA) with a spherical quartz monochromator and an energy analyser working in the range of binding energies from 0 to 1500 eV. The energy resolution was ΔE ≤ 0.5 eV. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu Axima Confidence time-of-flight spectrometer (Shimadzu Biotech) in the reflectron high resolution mode with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) without a matrix (for range with m/z < 700) and using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as a matrix (for range with m/z > 1000). Matrix solution in tetrahydrofuran (10 mg ml−1) was dropped on the top of materials films and dried in air. The NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer using the residual solvent signals as a reference.
Electrical measurements
The ITO glass substrates were laser scribed (EASY SISMA 200F) to produce lateral two-electrode architectures with a channel length of 70 μm and a channel width of 2 mm. The polymer films were spin-coated above the ITO electrodes and dried at 90 °C within 2 h inside the glove box. Afterwards, they were subjected to electrical photoresponse measurements under exposure to the light pulses generated by a 10W white LED powered by an Advantest 6241A instrument. The electrical signal from the devices was collected using a Keithley 2612 source-meter. All measurements were performed inside MBraun glove boxes with a pure nitrogen atmosphere without exposure to oxygen and moisture.
Theoretical calculations
All calculations were based on density functional theory (DFT) and performed with the Gaussian 16 suite of programs. The RMS force threshold was set to 3 × 10−4 eV Å−1 and the total energy threshold to 10−8 a.u. For performing preliminary calculations, we chose the density functional PBE belonging to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) family of exchange-correlation functionals.
Conclusions
To summarize, we presented an efficient methodology for studying photodegradation of conjugated polymers under anoxic conditions and comparing their intrinsic photostabilities. The obtained mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy data, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that solubilized DPP units are intrinsically unstable under UV light exposure and first undergo elimination of alkene fragments, which is followed by CO extrusion or retro-Beckmann rearrangement producing 1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)but-2-yne-1,4-diamine and 1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzene, respectively. Such building blocks as, e.g., benzoxadiazole, especially when bearing ether substituents, are very prone to photodegradation due to the presence of metastable N–O bonds. Benzothiadiazole also degrades with the rupture of N–S bonds and the presence of fluorine or alkoxy groups accelerates the light-induced aging. The most photochemically stable building blocks are based on naphthalene diimide and oligothiophenes. However, significant loss of sulphur from the polymer films upon aging and evolution of the XPS spectra suggest that thiophene itself is still not entirely photostable. This is quite an alarming finding considering that all efficient electron donors and now also electron acceptor materials incorporate thiophene units in their molecular frameworks. The revealed correlations between the chemical structure of conjugated polymers (presence of certain building blocks or side chains) and their photostability provide a useful set of guidelines for rational design of a new generation of organic absorber materials, which could demonstrate simultaneously high photovoltaic efficiency and long-term operational stability.
