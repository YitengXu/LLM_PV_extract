One of the most promising technologies for converting sunlight into electricity is solar cells but silicon or other inorganic material based solar cells are rather expensive. The solid-state photovoltaic technologies are often challenged by devices with dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), functioning at a molecular level.1 The low-cost and easier fabrication of DSCs are key features that draw burgeoning interest over the silicon based inorganic solar cells.2 In DSCs the TiO2 layers are the key components, through which the photoelectrons generated from the dye molecules are transported to the anode,2 although other semiconducting oxides such as ZnO, SnO2, or Nb2O5 are also employed.3 A reverse charge transfer in the DSCs from TiO2 to the dye or to the redox couple (I3−/I−) may severely reduce the cell efficiency. One effective way to prop up the charge transfer and to reduce the backward recombination is the introduction of a conductive network into TiO2. Here, graphene shows incomparable potential not only for its extremely high carrier mobility but also for its unique 2D flexible structure.4 Graphene is an important material which finds promising applications in different fields.5 Also graphene has led to the rise of scientific investigations of e.g. high-performance polymer composites, energy storage, photovoltaic devices, sensors and electronics.6 Replacement of electrodes with graphene in organic solar cells with various polymers has been well reported.7 The promoting effect of graphene on DSCs has also been explored.8 But using the polymer–graphene oxide nanocomposite as an alternate material of TiO2 in a DSC, which yields a reasonable power conversion efficiency, is yet unknown and is reported here. Here we have replaced the TiO2 layer with our newly synthesized semiconducting poly[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,5-thienylene] grafted reduced graphene oxide (PHET-g-rGO) (Scheme 1). About 68% (w/w) PHET (Mn = 19470 with a PDI of 1.20) is grafted onto the rGO as determined from the hydrolysis of PHET-g-RGO.
 Scheme 1  Formation of a PHET-g-rGO composite. 

Fig. 1 indicates that pure PHET exhibits fibrillar network morphology and in PHET-g-rGO the network morphology of the polymer remains appended on the graphene surface making it a good electron transport promoter.9 Thus when white light is absorbed by a monomolecular layer of the dye adsorbed on the semiconducting PHET-g-rGO, an electron is promoted from the dye to an excited state. The excited electron is then transferred to the conduction band of PHET and the electron mobility is accelerated by the rGO part in the PHET-g-rGO composite. This leads to effective charge separation, with a negative charge within the semiconducting PHET-g-rGO and a positive charge on the surface-adsorbed dye molecule. Hence, for the first time, replacing the traditional TiO2 layer with the newly synthesized PHET-g-rGO leads to a reasonable power conversion (efficiency 3.06%) of DSCs with a ruthenium dye (N-719, loading 1.95 × 10−5 mmol cm−2).
 Fig. 1  TEM images of (a) pure PHET and (b) PHET-g-rGO. 
The FTIR spectra of GO, PHET and PHET-g-rGO are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and for GO, the peaks around 3432, 1717, 1626, 1400–1064 cm−1 are attributed to the O–H, CO, intercalated water and C–O vibrations, respectively.10a For PHET the bands at 3259, 2925 and 2872 cm−1 correspond to the stretching of the hydroxyl group and also to the stretching of the –CH2– group. The bands at 1515 and 1308 cm−1 are associated with the vibrational modes of the thiophene ring and angular deformation of –C–H bonds, respectively. The stretching frequency of the –C–O group is found at 1032 cm−1 and the out-of-plane deformation band of the thiophene ring is at 821 cm−1.10b For PHET-g-rGO the bands at 1728 and 1230 cm−1 are attributed to the CO stretching and the C–O stretching of the ester groups, respectively, confirming the formation of covalent bonding between rGO and PHET.10c It is evident from Fig. S3b (ESI†) that 1728 and 1230 cm−1 peaks are shifted to 1722 and 1192 cm−1 indicating supramolecular interaction (H-bonding) between the dye and PHET-g-rGO.
The UV-vis spectra of pure PHET and PHET-g-rGO in dimethyl formamide (DMF) are presented in Fig. S4a (ESI†). Pure PHET shows an absorption band at 419 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of its conjugated segments.10b It is red shifted to 431 nm after grafting with rGO due to the delocalization of π-electrons by conjugation with the graphene ring. The graphene-induced delocalization is also observed in the diffuse reflectance spectra of PHET-g-rGO (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The 374 and 547 nm peaks are due to π–π* transition of the thiophene ring and π-conjugated segments, respectively.10d In the spectrum of PHET-g-rGO the former peak red shifted to 383 nm while the latter peak shifted to 628 nm. The observed red shifts in both the solution and the solid state compared to those of PHET indicate better electron delocalization with the chemically linked graphene sheet. The absorption bands at 374 nm for PHET and 383 nm for PHET-g-rGO correspond to the band gap values of 1.86 eV and 1.38 eV, respectively (inset of Fig. S4b, ESI†), calculated using Tauc's method.10e The band gap of PHET-g-rGO is lower than that of PHET and it may be attributed to the chemical binding of rGO with PHET. Thus, it provides an advantage for the photovoltaic application of PHET-g-rGO and it is rather not possible by simple mixing of rGO and the polymer (Fig. S4c, ESI†) where no such shift of the π–π* absorption peak occurs.11
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure PHET and PHET-g-rGO in DMF are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). At an excitation wavelength of 420 nm, PHET shows the PL emission peak at 565 nm which becomes red shifted to 579 nm for PHET-g-rGO. The 14 nm red shift is attributed to the stabilization of excitons through the graphene rings.12a But fluorescence quenching occurs in PHET-g-rGO and it is expected as graphene is a well-known fluorescence quencher.12b The reason for the PL quenching in PHET-g-rGO may be due to the interaction of PHET with rGO12c forming additional decaying paths of the excitons through the rGO sheets.
For using this material as an alternative of TiO2 we have checked whether after grafting with rGO, there is suppression in the electron–hole pair (e−–h+) recombination. The red shift in UV-vis spectra and the PL quenching in PHET-g-rGO definitely suggest that there is efficient (e−–h+) pair separation and as a further proof we observe a stable photocurrent produced after irradiation with white light (Fig. S6, ESI†). In PHET-g-rGO, PHET is a potential donor and rGO acts as an acceptor.6d Hence after grafting of rGO with PHET, the resulting PHET-g-rGO can provide a direct path increasing the electron transport.
TiO2 is an electronic semi-conductor in which the current carriers are actually free electrons, in contrast to the hole conduction of the present type of semi-conductor.13a The (e−–h+) pair may also exist in the π bonds of PHET; the holes in the HOMO and electrons in the LUMO can contribute to the total electrical conductivity. Due to the low mobility of electrons in PHET (an organic semiconductor) we have covalently grafted it with rGO which has high electron mobility (15000 cm2 V−1 s−1) at room temperature.7 The dc-conductivity of pure PHET is 2.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 whereas the PHET-g-rGO has a conductivity value of 7.9 × 10−4 S cm−1. Hence upon grafting with rGO a four order increase in conductivity occurs compared to that with pure PHET and it is due to the increase in carrier mobility in PHET-g-rGO. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of both pure PHET and PHET-g-rGO (Fig. S7, ESI†) exhibit the semiconducting nature, however, the PHET-g-rGO is more conducting than the PHET due to the contribution of high electron mobility of rGO. Now to utilize the PHET-g-rGO as an alternative of TiO2 in DSCs, the porous character of the material is a necessary criterion. The porosity of the composite is confirmed by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement (Fig. S8, ESI†). The pore size distribution of the samples is measured using the Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) method14a (Fig. S9, ESI†). The BET surface area of the PHET-g-rGO is 227.5 m2 g−1 and the respective pore volume is 0.19 cc g−1. So, a high surface area is obtained for the composite which is comparable with the bare TiO2 surface area (typically ≈290 m2 g−1).14b The existence of mesopores in the PHET-g-rGO can originate from the aggregation of graphene nanosheets13b (Fig. S2c, ESI†) and it may also be created by the polymer network structures.14c,d Also, the surface area of graphene is extremely high (theoretical value 2630 m2 g−1)13c which contributes to the high surface area of the composite. Such organized porous nanostructures of PHET-g-rGO would be suitable for fabrication of solar cells, as they would provide efficient transport pathways for the electrolyte molecules. Hence, such a high surface area and porosity of PHET-g-rGO are beneficial for replacing TiO2 to fabricate DSCs. The 2D morphology of graphene and a large surface area provide a large number of sites for the adsorption of dye molecules, which thus harvests more light leading to the injection of more photoinduced electrons from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of the composite. High photoelectron conversion efficiency, a reduced (e−–h+) recombination rate and high electron transport are highly desirable for fabrication of an efficient DSC. The energy level of graphene is between the conduction band of PHET and that of ITO.10d Due to its excellent electronic mobility, the 2D graphene acts as a bridge between PHET and ITO acting as an electron transfer channel,8d allowing the transport of photoinduced electrons very quickly. Scheme 2 shows the operational principle of a DSC. Under illumination with white light (150 W Xenon lamp), the conduction band of PHET receives electrons from the photo excited dye. Because the PHET is anchored with 2D graphene, the excited electrons of the polymer are captured by it without any obstruction. The collected electrons can transport from PHET to the conductive substrate quickly through graphene bridges to ITO (Scheme 2), thus suppressing the recombination and back reaction satisfactorily. This yields a reasonably high photocurrent density (Jsc) of 7.5 mA cm−2 for the device (the thickness of the PHET-g-rGO film is 6.1 μm) with an overall power conversion efficiency of 3.06% (Fig. 2) and the incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) is ∼32% (Fig. S10, ESI†). The cell characteristics when using the PHET-g-rGO as an alternative of TiO2 are: open circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.61 V, Jsc = 7.5 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) = 0.668, yielding an overall power conversion efficiency (η) = 3.06%. A DSC fabricated with bulk TiO2 and a graphite counter electrode (Fig. S11a, ESI†) exhibit a cell efficiency of 2.66% (Voc 0.71 and fill factor 0.72). After simple mixing of PHET with rGO we have made a DSC whose efficiency is only 0.82% (Fig. S11b, ESI†), which is much lower than that of the DSC made using the grafted composite (PHET-g-rGO). Thus chemical grafting has a commanding role in increasing the cell efficiency.

So without using the key component (TiO2) of DSCs we can also obtain a reasonable power conversion efficiency using the newly synthesized PHET-g-rGO as a photo electrode. We think that the simultaneous development of low cost new organic dyes, compatible with this type of polymer based photo electrode, may lead to fabrication of DSCs with much higher efficiencies.
