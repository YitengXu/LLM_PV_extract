In the scheme of a sustainable biorefinery, lignin valorization is essential for enhancing the economic feasibility of the overall biomass transformation processes. Electrocatalysis and electrochemical processes are expected to play a major role in biomass valorization due to the possibility of using renewable electricity sources for in situ production of ‘green’ H2 and other reagents that are necessary for biomass conversion. Recent advances in the electrocatalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of lignin derivatives, including oxygenated aromatic compounds, suggest promising pathways for the synthesis of industrially relevant chemicals, such as ketone-alcohol (KA) oil, the mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol for the production of Nylon polymers. This review presents the prospect of electrocatalytic reduction approaches for a mild synthesis of lignin-based chemicals with emphasis on the potential applications of high current density electrolysis. Feasible electrocatalytic oxidation strategies for lignin depolymerization are also summarized, highlighting the fundamental differences between the electrochemical reductive and oxidative routes.

1. Introduction
The search for clean and sustainable energy sources has been driven by major global issues, such as the overdependence on non-renewable petroleum sources and the environmental problems of greenhouse gas emissions. Energy utilization from renewable resources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy) represents an eco-friendly approach for powering economic growth and securing future energy supply while mitigating the risks of climate change.1 Moreover, with the rising concerns of global health crises like COVID-19, the strategic development of bio-based product manufacture is urgently needed to anticipate the increasing demand for sustainably generated and biodegradable polymer products, which are currently dominated by petroleum derivatives.
According to the latest report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), world energy supply and demand remain dominated by fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas).2 In 2017, fossil energy accounted for approximately 67% and 81% of the total world energy consumption and supply, respectively. Bioenergy accounts for roughly 10% of world total primary energy supply today. Electricity has been increasingly in demand, making up nearly 19% of the total world energy consumption.2 The increasing electricity demand is anticipated with the accelerated efforts on decarbonizing electricity through the renewables, nuclear power, and carbon capture technologies. Prior to the global outbreak, it was already estimated that renewable energy sources (including hydro, solar photovoltaic, and wind) will provide two-thirds (67%) of electricity supply worldwide by 2040.3 Renewable electricity consumption, along with natural resources and energy innovation, improve environmental quality and can have a positive role in controlling CO2 emissions related to economic growth.4 All these data show the enormous potential of electricity-driven process, such as electrocatalysis, for sustainable energy production in the coming years.
1.1. Lignocellulosic biomass as a promising source for renewable carbon-based energy
As the Earth's most abundant carbon source, lignocellulosic biomass represents a promising natural resource for energy and chemical production.5–7 Lignocellulosic materials are inexpensive (can be derived from organic wastes), environmentally friendly (biodegradable), and do not compete with the feedstocks for food production. Three biopolymers which constitute biomass, cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (25–35%), and lignin (15–30%), can be transformed into smaller and upgradable bio-chemicals, which have versatile industrial applications, such as transportation fuels, fine chemicals, and polymeric materials.5,6,8 The chemistry and structure of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin have been reviewed extensively elsewhere.6,7,9–11 The overall biomass conversion into bioproducts involves two major reactions: fractionation (including depolymerization) and valorization (including reductive or oxidative upgrading). In the fractionation step, lignocellulosic biomass is deconstructed into its constituents,10via biological (e.g., enzymatic hydrolysis) or thermochemical processes (e.g., acid hydrolysis, fast pyrolysis), whereas electrochemical routes (e.g. electrochemical delignification) remain underexplored for this purpose. A carbohydrate-rich stream (hydrolysate) and a lignin-derived substrate (bio-oil) are produced from this fractionation-depolymerization step to be further catalytically upgraded into higher value products. An ideal strategy for biomass valorization should aim for energy densification (to maximize the energy content of the final products) and carbon preservation (to minimize carbon losses in the process) in order to attain the competitiveness of bioproducts compared with petroleum. The integration of thermochemical (e.g., fast pyrolysis) and electrochemical pathways using renewable electricity is considered a promising carbon retentive scheme that could enhance the profitability of future biorefineries.12,13 A general scheme for the reductive transformation processes for biomass to bioproducts are illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  General schematic illustration of lignocellulosic biomass transformation into bio-products (fuels, chemicals, and/or polymeric materials). The overarching goal of this process is to deconstruct the complex structure of biomass and upgrade the resultant substrates, i.e. carbohydrate-rich streams (hydrolysate) and lignin-derived streams (bio-oil) into higher value products. Traditionally, the reductive upgrading pathways are done via thermocatalytic processes. As a novel approach, the electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives is the primary focus of this review. 
1.2. Lignin and bio-oil as natural sources for renewable chemicals and fuels
As the second most plentiful biopolymer after cellulose and the most abundant source of aromatic compounds in nature, lignin accounts for 15–30% (by weight) and 40% (by energy) of the biomass.14,15 Lignin is considered an important, but underutilized material derived from lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes and/or pulp and paper plants.9,14,16 The underutilization of lignin is due to its complex, irregular structure and variability in composition which depends on the biomass origin and the isolation methods. The representative lignin network is composed of three major monolignols: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, which are commonly referred to as p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units, respectively (Fig. 2).9,14,15 Lignin convertibility is basically determined by the interunit linkages between monolignols; the most abundant linkage is β-aryl ether (β-O-4) which can be found in softwood (43–50%) and hardwood (50–65%).16 The lignin resistance toward chemical degradation is considerably dictated by the reactivity of β-O-4 bonds.16 Factors affecting lignin solubility include the molecular weight, temperature, liquid to solid ratio, and the ionic strength of the aqueous solution.17 Lignin is a preferable feedstock for pyrolysis to produce bio-oil because of the lower oxygen content (0.32 < O/C < 0.46) compared to that of woody biomass (O/C > 0.61).15 Lignin valorization is essential to enhance the economic and environmental profitability of the overall biomass conversion process associated with a sustainable biorefinery.14–16 Development of genetic engineering, analytical chemistry and computational modeling, and biomass pretreatment technologies could improve lignin processing in the biorefinery.18

Bio-oil is a highly oxygenated, multi-component liquid mixture containing acids, alcohols, sugars, aldehydes, esters, ketones, phenolics, aromatics, and oligomers.19–21 The exact chemical composition of bio-oil depends on the feedstock type and source (biomass or lignin) and the fractionation or depolymerization method.22 Compared to petroleum crude oil, pyrolysis bio-oil from wood has lower energy density (40 MJ kg−1vs. 16–19 MJ kg−1).19,20 Bio-oil is a potential source for renewable chemicals and fuels, however its direct use is improbable due to high oxygen (35–40 wt%) and water (15–30 wt%) content, high viscosity and acidity, instability due to polymerization, and incompatibility with petroleum fuels. The current industrial uses of bio-oil (or lignin) are limited mostly to low-grade fuels via direct combustion.15,20 Stabilization and upgrading of the bio-oil are necessary before it can be used as an alternative to petroleum fuels and chemicals feedstock.5,15,20 The goal of bio-oil upgrading processes is principally to optimize the energy density (C–H bonds) and molecular weight (C–C bonds) while reducing the oxygen content (C–O bonds) of the final products.
Conventional bio-oil upgrading processes, including hydrocracking, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), have been investigated using a variety of heterogeneous catalysts, such as noble metals (supported on carbon or metal oxides) and transition metal carbide, nitride, and phosphide catalysts.20,23,24 Most of these thermochemical processes, referred to as thermocatalytic hydrogenation–hydrogenolysis (TCH), have common requirements, such as high temperature (200–400 °C) and high H2 pressure (100–200 bar) to achieve high production rates. In such a harsh upgrading environment, bio-oil is not stable and its polymerization, which starts to accelerate at 80 °C, will cause substantial tar and coke formation, leading to reactor plugging and catalyst deactivation.25,26 The majority of hydrogen gas (∼95%) is currently produced from fossil resources (via methane steam reforming or coal gasification).27 As fuel, hydrogen has higher energy content (∼142 MJ kg−1, on a higher heating value (HHV) basis) than gasoline (47.5 MJ kg−1) and diesel (∼45 MJ kg−1).28 However, the high cost of hydrogen is considered one major impediment to the commercial success of TCH approaches, therefore hydrogen-lean or hydrogen-free approaches to bio-oil valorization are desirable.29 For these reasons, bio-oil upgrading via TCH is yet to be cost-effective and energy-efficient, therefore further research and development is still needed in this area.15,26
1.3. Renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis
Water is an indispensable feedstock in electrochemical valorization of biomass derivatives. While hydrogen can be made from a variety of feedstocks, including natural gas, coal, biomass, wastes,27 water electrolysis is the simplest technology for producing hydrogen.30 Electrolysis of water is essentially the conversion of electrical energy to chemical energy in the form of hydrogen, with oxygen as a useful by-product,31 and is currently the only way to produce large quantities of hydrogen with no emissions of fossil carbon pollutants.27,30
Alkaline electrolysis is the most common technology that employs potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), or sodium chloride (NaCl) as the electrolyte solution (25–30 wt% concentration).30 Alternatively, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, PEM-based acid electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) are also being developed.31,32 Commercial alkaline electrolyzers are typically operated at lower current densities (100–300 mA cm−2) than PEM electrolyzers (>1600 mA cm−2).30,31 Of all these technologies, SOEC electrolyzers are the most electrically efficient (85–90%),31 followed by PEM-based acid electrolyzers (65–82%),32,33 but they are the least developed and require costly materials and fabrication methods in addition to a heat source. PEM electrolyzers are more efficient (55–70%) than alkaline electrolyzers (50–60%) but have higher capital costs.31,33 A comprehensive review, with direct comparison of water electrolysis technologies, has been provided recently by Gür32 and a summary is presented here (Table 1) to highlight the potential applications of water electrolyzer infrastructures with the ranges of operating current density and electrolyte pH relevant for electrocatalytic conversion of biomass. In the context of electrochemical reduction for biomass valorization, hydrogen gas is not the target product; however, knowledge of electrolytic hydrogen technology is necessary for the overall process development, especially in regards to efforts to build accessible hydrogen energy infrastructure in remote sites that can be coupled with other renewable energy sources.

1.4. Scope and purpose of this review
This review mainly focuses on the upgrading of lignin-derived compounds via an electrochemical reduction process known as electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH). Insights from the fundamental concepts of ECH, electron transfer mechanisms, and mechanistic studies from the ECH of lignin model reactants are systematically provided herein. Recent progress in lignin depolymerization via electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) is also briefly discussed to give a broader perspective on electrochemical routes for lignin valorization. The purpose of this article is to present a concise and coherent review of the state of the art of the electrocatalytic valorization of lignin-derived substrates, not only relevant to the scientific community, but also to non-specialists and early stage researchers in this field. This review contributes to the advancement of electrochemical routes for green synthesis of renewable bio-products, mainly commodity organic chemicals.
2. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation: basic concepts and general mechanisms
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) has been studied for over a century and its applications for electrosynthesis of organic compounds have gained increasing interest in recent years.12,13,35–48 ECH is essentially an electrochemical reduction process that utilizes the chemisorbed hydrogen (Hads) resulting from proton and/or water reduction for the saturation of organic compounds on the catalyst. This ECH process could also involve hydrogenolysis and/or hydrodeoxygenation to remove oxygen from the organics (or decrease the O/C ratio), thereby storing higher chemical energy in the liquid products.
2.1. Prospects of electrocatalytic hydrogenation
In comparison to classic thermocatalytic hydrogenation (TCH) routes, the ECH process offers some advantages with respect to: (i) greener hydrogen gas (internally and continuously supplied from water splitting reactions, eliminating the requirement of external H2 supply), (ii) milder reaction conditions (lower temperature and pressure using aqueous electrolytes, eliminating the need for organic solvents and the problem of catalyst deactivation due to coking), (iii) cleaner process (resulting in higher carbon recovery and useful by-products, such as hydrogen and oxygen gases, which in a large-scale can be utilized for fuel cell applications), (iv) simpler operation (controllable operating parameters, such as current/voltage input).49–52 Furthermore, the ECH process becomes more attractive with the possibility of integration with solar, wind, and/or hydro energy, which are renewable and becoming more economical sources of electricity.12,30,31 In this regard, the electrochemical reduction of biomass-derived substrates, particularly lignin derivatives, represents a sustainable process that could be integrated with renewable energy and promote the overall biorefinery with electricity storage in a chemical form. An inherent limitation of the ECH method comes from the competitive side reaction, that is the formation of molecular hydrogen (H2), either via electrochemical or thermal desorption.49
2.2. Reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of organic compounds
A simplified, plausible ECH reaction mechanism involves the following elementary steps:
• Generation of chemisorbed hydrogen on the catalytic metal sites (M): H3O+ + e− + M → H·M + H2O(1)
• Adsorption of the organic reactant on the catalyst adsorption sites (A): (RO) + A ↔ (RO)·A(2)
• Hydrogenation between the adsorbed organics and the chemisorbed hydrogen: (RO)·A + 2H·M ↔ (RH–OH)·A + 2 M(3) (RH–OH)·A + 2H·M ↔ (R–H2)·A + H2O + 2M(4)
• Desorption of the hydrogenated product: (RH–OH)·A ↔ RH–OH + A(5) (R–H2)·A ↔ R–H2 + A(6)
As the competitive pathway to ECH, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually proceeds via Volmer–Heyrovsky–Tafel reaction mechanism, depending on the electrolyte type, as follows:
• Chemisorbed hydrogen generation via proton/water reduction Volmer reactions: H+ + e− + M → H·M (in acid media)(7a) H2O + M + e− → H·M + OH− (in neutral/base media)(7b)
• Hydrogen (electrochemical) desorption via Heyrovsky reactions: H·M + (H+)aq + e− → H2 + M (in acid media)(8a) H·M+H2O+e−→H2+OH−+M (in neutral/base media)(8b)
• Hydrogen (thermal) desorption via Tafel reactions: H·M + H·M → H2 + 2M(9)
Surface coverages of adsorbed organics and chemisorbed hydrogen are the key factors in the ECH process which determine the faradaic efficiency. The studies of H2 adsorption on metals have confirmed that the Hads coverage increases with an increase in the negative overpotential.47 It is noteworthy that changing the cathode potential to control the surface Hads coverage is equivalent to changes of the hydrogen pressure in the TCH process.47
2.3. Electron transfer mechanisms in electrochemical hydrogenation
Many important energy conversion processes in chemistry and biology are essentially redox reactions, in which both electrons and protons are transferred, and occur by a variety of mechanisms.53 Electron transfer (ET), along with proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), are among the elementary steps for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). The coupling of ET and PT influences both energetics and mechanisms, allowing for the buildup of multiple redox equivalents at single sites or clusters for multielectron reactions or providing reaction pathways that involve simultaneous ET and PT thus avoiding high-energy intermediates.53,54 The mechanisms in PCET reactions are dictated by the conditions, such as temperature, pH, and solvent (polarity).54 In PCET, protons and electrons are transferred from different orbitals on the donor to different orbitals on the acceptor, while in HAT, both electrons and protons are transferred from the same chemical bond.53 Comprehensive reviews on PCET are provided in the literature.53,54
Two distinct electron transfer mechanisms in electrochemical hydrogenation are proposed based on the requirement of direct chemical interaction with the electrode surface (direct electroreduction followed by a protonation, i.e. electronation-protonation (EP) reaction)47 and the involvement of chemisorbed hydrogen on the electrode surface (electrocatalytic hydrogenation).52 ECH involves an inner-sphere ET that requires direct interaction with the electrode (or the charged catalyst surface) through specific adsorption of atomic hydrogen (Hads) as the proton source,52,55 whereas EP proceeds via either inner-sphere or outer-sphere ET whereby the protonation step may occur in the bulk solution47,52 and the electrode reactions are characterized by a large H2 overpotential and low Hads coverage.47 In contrast to the ECH mechanism described by eqn (1)–(6), the EP mechanism is described as follows (where R denotes the organic reactant molecules): R + e− ↔ R−(10) R− + H+ → RH(11) RH + e− ↔ RH−(12) RH− + H+ → RH2(13)
Examples of inner-sphere and outer-sphere reactions are provided in the literature.53,55–57 A general comparison of the inner-sphere and outer-sphere ET is summarized in Fig. 3.

The inner-sphere and outer-sphere comparison is summarized from various literatures.52,55,56 
2.4. Electrocatalysis mechanism in organic electrosynthesis
In organic electrosynthesis, there are three possible scenarios for the electron transfer from the electrode to the substrate, as summarized by Möhle et al.,58 including: (i) direct electron transfer via an inert electrode, (ii) electrocatalytic reaction over an active electrode, (iii) mediated electrolysis (Fig. 4). In the first mode, the substrate reactivity at the electrode surface is not influenced by a surface layer thus selectivity control is possible by tuning the electrode potential. In the second mode, an electrochemically active species is formed and regenerated in situ, thus the substrate electroconversion becomes less dominated by the applied potential. In the third mode, electrolyte-soluble redox-active species act as mediators between the electrode and the substrate, thus the electroconversion can be conducted at milder potentials than an electrolysis without mediator, avoiding large overpotentials.58

2.5. The roles of electrocatalyst and electrolyte in ECH of organic compounds
The appropriate choice of electrocatalyst and electrolyte is important for an effective ECH. The electrocatalyst provides large active surface area for the reaction between the adsorbed organics and the chemisorbed hydrogen, whereas the electrolyte provides electrical conductivity for the water splitting reactions. Acidic electrolyte is favorable for ECH applications due to the requirement of high proton concentration as the source of hydrogen radicals.50 Acid-tolerant catalysts are therefore desirable for an effective ECH and, in this regard, the role of noble metals remains significant. The synergy between electrocatalyst and electrolyte aims to maximize the faradaic efficiency (F.E.), which represents the predominant use of electrons for the ECH of organics over HER.51 High surface coverages of the adsorbed organics and the chemisorbed hydrogen on the catalytic active sites are hence pivotal for an efficient ECH process.
Importantly, the electrolyte effect reveals that proton/water reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions proceed differently in acid, neutral, and base solutions51 (as shown in eqn (7)–(9)). The formation of adsorbed hydrogen radicals (Volmer reactions, eqn (7a–b)), as the first step in the electrocatalytic H2 evolution, plays an important role in the ECH of organics. Meanwhile, the side reactions that produce hydrogen gas can proceed electrocatalytically (via Heyrovsky reactions, eqn (8a–b)) or thermally (via Tafel reaction, eqn (9)). Hydrogen radicals are formed via the electroreduction of protons in acidic media (where protons are abundant) or via water reduction with cogeneration of hydroxide ions in neutral/alkaline media.
The HER kinetics in alkaline media is generally considered more sluggish than in acidic electrolytes because of an additional water dissociation step and the more complex mechanism where the reaction rate and pathway are influenced not only by hydrogen adsorption/desorption energies (as in case of acidic media), but also by water adsorption and dissociation and hydroxyl ion affinity for the catalyst surface (which could poison the surface by occupying the active sites). Consequently, the best performing catalysts in acidic media (even the noble metals) showed poor activity and stability in alkaline electrolytes, requiring large overpotentials to obtain reasonable current densities.59 Different catalyst and electrolyte properties are therefore expected to have different impacts on the ECH efficiency.
3. Recent progress in electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives
In the past two decades, intensive efforts have been made to investigate the valorization of lignin-derived substrates using electrocatalytic reduction processes. Phenol is the most common lignin monomer for ECH studies37,42,44–46,60–63 and represents an important platform chemical for the synthesis of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol as the industrial precursors for Nylon polymers.64–66 A variety of phenolic and aromatic model compounds, such as p-cresol, 4-methoxyphenol, guaiacol, syringol, benzaldehyde, benzyl phenyl ether, phenolic ethers have also been investigated in ECH under various conditions (Table 2). Most of the reported studies have used low current densities (<|50 mA cm−2|) and low initial reactant concentration (<50 mM) that resulted in low faradaic efficiencies (<50%), which are not practically relevant for large-scale applications. Nevertheless, insights can still be drawn from the mechanism and kinetic studies using the model reactants, especially pertaining to the reactivity of different functional groups of the organic molecules with different metal catalysts.

3.1. Overview of the electrocatalyst preparation and application techniques
With regard to the electrocatalyst design and development, there have been three applicable methods to configure the electrocatalytic materials: electrodeposition,36,42,44–46,60 impregnation or chemical deposition,13,35,42,44,67–71 and suspension.37,40,50,51,62,63,72 In the electrodeposition, metal particles are deposited on a high surface area, conductive material (e.g., graphite felt) by electrochemically reducing the dissolved metal cations from the metal precursor electrolytes. In the impregnation, the electrocatalyst is prepared by dispersing the metal precursor solution carefully onto the porous, conductive material (this process is known as incipient wetness or dry impregnation and may include chemical spray deposition) or by soaking the support material (e.g., carbon cloth) in the precursor solution to saturate its pores (wet impregnation or cation exchange method). This process requires further steps, such as drying at room temperature and reduction under H2 at elevated pressure and temperature (e.g., 34 atm and 220 °C).35 Other than H2, soluble reductive agents, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solutions, can be employed for reduction of the impregnated species. In the suspension technique, catalyst powder (usually consists of active metal deposited on porous support material) is dispersed in the electrolyte in a stirred cell. Another method to fabricate the electrocatalyst is mechanical pressing,43,47,48 where heat and pressure are applied to form a powder compact on a conductive plate. Among the various configurations, the stirred suspension method is relatively recent, but it has been increasingly applied for the ECH of lignin model compounds. To date, the impact of the different electrocatalyst configurations on substrate reactivity and ECH efficiency has not been made clear. This review presents a comprehensive comparative study of various electrocatalyst configurations in the ECH of lignin derivatives, indicating that high current density electrolysis could be performed without the expense of detrimental decrease in faradaic efficiency. By using a stirred slurry electrocatalyst, for instance, diffusion limitations of organic substrate to the electrode (observed in the conventional ECH) can be overcome. Furthermore, key findings and insights from the previous research papers on ECH of lignin derivatives are discussed in order to better understand the process with different electrocatalyst designs. A schematic illustration of the electrocatalyst configurations is presented in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Three common techniques for the electrocatalyst preparation and application in the ECH of lignin derivatives, including electrodeposition, impregnation or spray deposition, and stirred suspension. The first two methods are used for fixed bed electrode configurations, while the stirred suspension method enables direct use of catalyst in a slurry configuration. Note that a supported catalyst (e.g., Pd/C) can also be used directly in spray deposition method. 
3.2. Electrocatalytic reduction of phenol
In the ECH of phenol on dispersed Pt electrodes, Amouzegar et al. reported the selective conversion to cyclohexanol over 2% Pt loading on Vulcan carbon powder with Teflon as the binding material, resulting in higher current efficiency (85%) than those obtained on carbon rods-electrodeposited Pt or platinized Pt electrodes.42 It was found that the reaction is not structure-sensitive to the Pt particle size, but the efficiency and selectivity are influenced by the electrode material (i.e. the presence of alloying component, such as Pt–Co/C).45 The later work revealed that a Pt/C electrode is significantly more active than platinized platinum (Pt/Pt) electrode because of the increased Pt electron density in its interaction with the carbon support (i.e. a metal–support interaction effect) that weakened the Pt–H bond.45 Moreover, the study of the reaction mechanism showed the rate determining step (RDS) for the phenol ECH to cyclohexanol is the surface reaction between the adsorbed species, not the phenol adsorption,46 which was also recently confirmed by Song et al. using suspended Pt/C catalyst in acetic acid (pH 5) electrolyte.37 Under the operating conditions, phenol ECH followed a zeroth order reaction with respect to phenol,37,50,51,62 indicating the rate is independent of the phenol concentration, which might be attributed to the high reactivity of phenol toward hydrogen radicals allowing faster adsorption and H+ reduction. Phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone proceeded faster than cyclohexanone hydrogenation to cyclohexanol (although the former step consumes twice as many electrons), thus cyclohexanone was the most dominant product at the low conversions.37,63 The reaction pathways for phenol ECH and TCH were also shown to be independent and proceeded via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism, implying the chemisorbed hydrogen for ECH was solely produced from electroreduction of protons instead of re-adsorption of H2. Comparative phenol hydrogenation experiments revealed the reaction rates and turnover frequencies (TOF) of the catalysts (Pt/C and Rh/C) in the combined ECH and TCH experiments equal the sum of the values obtained from the individual ECH and TCH (Table 3 and Fig. 6). The activation energies determined using Arrhenius plots with the TOF values obtained from phenol ECH at potentiostatic conditions (5–40 °C) were 29 kJ mol−1 (on Pt/C) and 23 kJ mol−1 (on Rh/C).37

In a related work, Singh et al. reported a counter-intuitive effect of temperature in the ECH of phenol (18 mM) over Rh/C at low cathode potentials (−0.15 to −0.45 V vs. RHE).61 The phenol conversion reached a plateau (60–75%) at higher temperature (60 °C) but nearly 100% at room temperature (23 °C), suggesting the possibility of thermal dehydrogenation of phenol species that could block the active sites and the lower Hads coverage at elevated temperatures (Fig. 7a). This problem could be resolved by increasing the applied potential (in ECH) or H2 pressure (from 1 bar to 20 bar in TCH, as shown in Fig. 7b) to remove the site blockers and increase the Hads coverage, resulting in increased hydrogenation rates and phenol conversion at higher temperatures (60–100 °C). Comparably, the cathode potential was observed to significantly affect the Hads coverage whereby the ECH rates increased faster than HER rates with increasing negative potentials leading to the higher production of cyclohexanol at room temperature (23 °C) using low phenol concentration (16 mM).62 At higher temperature (30–50 °C) and higher phenol concentration (105 mM) under potentiostatic control, cyclohexanol was also obtained as the most selective product in the ECH of phenol using H2SO4 (0.2 M) and 5 wt%-Pt/C. Interestingly, the product distribution shifted to cyclohexanone under galvanostatic control (j = −109 mA cm−2) at constant temperature (50 °C), showing the influence of temperature–potential synergy on the Hads coverage on the catalyst surface.50,51

Remarkably, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol to cyclohexane was achieved in the more recent study by Liu et al.72 using a dual-catalyst system consisting of suspended Pt/C catalyst and soluble silicotungstic acid (SiW12). Each catalyst is active for hydrogenation/ring saturation and dehydration, respectively. The latter, also referred to as polyoxometalate (POM), is a superacid that has much higher Brønsted acidity than H2SO4 or triflic acid (CF3SO3H), even in dilute solution.72 It is classified as a heteropoly acid, along with phosphotungstic acid (PW12), used as a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst (either in bulk or supported form) in the chemical industry.73,74 This catalyst is powerful for dehydration reactions and, for instance, has been used in the conversion of 2,5-dimethylfuran to p-xylene, a precursor chemical for the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).75 Meanwhile, the POM in the ECH of phenol acts as the charge storage and transfer catalyst, which transfers electrons from the cathode to the catalyst particle surface, facilitating the charge transfer efficiency.72 Nearly full phenol conversions (>99%) were achieved with different current densities (100–250 mA cm−2), resulting in product yields of cyclohexanol (85–89%), cyclohexane (10–14%), and cyclohexanone (0.3–1.7%) at 35 °C in less than 20 min (because low initial phenol concentration of 20 mM was used). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to explain the mechanism of phenol HDO to cyclohexane on Pt (Fig. 8A) by calculating the required reaction energy (Er) and the activation energy barrier (Ea) of each possible pathway. Direct cleavage of the phenol C–O bond to yield benzene is energetically unfavorable (ΔEr = 1.59 eV), hence the phenol aromatic ring was firstly saturated by hydrogen radicals (H*) from proton reduction and the reduced SiW12 over the Pt catalyst. The intermediate cyclohexanone can be easily hydrogenated to cyclohexanone, however the C–O bond cleavage of cyclohexanol is still energetically unfavorable (ΔEa = 1.80 eV), which explains why deoxygenation is difficult in low-temperature aqueous electrolysis. The proposed mechanism of phenol HDO via electrolysis in the presence of POM (Fig. 8B) includes: (i) the protonation of cyclohexanol to form a cyclohexyl-oxonium ion, (ii) the energy favorable C–O bond cleavage (ΔEr = 0.23 eV, ΔEa = 0.74 eV) via dehydration to yield carbocations in a cyclohexylium ion, (iii) the neutralization of the carbocations over Pt by one electron from the reduced SiW12 to yield a carbon radical, followed by the reaction with the H* to finally produce cyclohexane.72

3.3. Electrocatalytic reduction of guaiacol
Guaiacol ECH proceeds via two parallel reactions involving demethoxylation and aromatic ring saturation steps35,50,76 as opposed to phenol ECH, which proceeds in a series reaction. A thermodynamic analysis revealed that all the direct electrocatalytic reductions of guaiacol are thermodynamically favorable in which the standard potentials of all the reactions are above that of the HER.50 The reaction pathway shift was also observed in the ECH of guaiacol using a stirred slurry electrochemical reactor (SSER) due to the synergistic effect of temperature and cathode potential.50,51 At the higher temperature (60 °C), cyclohexanone formation was promoted while 2-methoxycyclohexanol was suppressed, suggesting the favored demethoxylation over ring saturation route (Fig. 9). At the applied constant current, higher temperature decreased the cathode potential (i.e. turning less negative) and promoted the desorption of Hads, thereby lowering the surface coverage and altering the reaction pathway. In contrast to phenol ECH, guaiacol ECH was reported to be a first- or second-order reaction depending on the operating conditions (e.g., initial reactant concentration, stirring rates, catalyst loading).50 While hydrogenation step (eqn (3) and (4)) was the RDS in phenol ECH,37 the adsorption of organic molecules (eqn (2)) appeared to be the RDS in guaiacol ECH as the reaction rates are dependent on the initial guaiacol concentration.50 Consistently, cyclohexanol and 2-methoxycyclohexanol were the most dominant products from guaiacol ECH under different conditions over the impregnated Ru/ACC (I = −40 to −160 mA, 25–80 °C)35 or the stirred Pt/C slurry (I = −300 to −700 mA, 30–50 °C).50 However, the faradaic efficiencies obtained in the latter work (30–50%) were higher than the former (8–31%) despite the higher current densities, which could be partially attributed to the electrocatalyst configuration. The SSER design allows the cell to operate at the industrially relevant current densities (>|100 mA cm−2|) and improves the liquid–solid mass and heat transfer between the reacting molecules and the negatively charged catalyst particles during the reaction. In the fixed bed electrode design, the organic molecules should collide with the chemisorbed hydrogen at the electrode surface to favor ECH over HER, whereas in the SSER, the hydrogenation reactions (eqn (3) and (4)) proceed on the large surface area of the charged metal active sites of the dispersed catalyst in the electrolyte solution. In the former case, the hydrogenation reactions are localized at the fixed bed electrode, whereas in the latter case, the reactions could proceed entirely at the well-dispersed electrocatalyst (stirred slurry electrode) as a result of the neighboring effect in which electrons are conductively transmitted to the surrounding metal particles through the collisions. Stirring rate is thus a critical parameter in the SSER that significantly affects the ECH efficiency.

Another important advantage of the SSER is related to the carbon recovery. High carbon recovery (>90%) can be obtained in the SSER at low catalyst loading with negligible diffusive losses.50 Lam et al. reported the deficits in material balance (80–93%) from the ECH of alkoxyphenols over RANEY® Nickel fixed bed electrode at low current density (8 mA cm−2) and moderate temperature (75 °C).36 Diffusion across the membrane, adsorption on the cathode, oxidation on the anode, and evaporation were possible causes of the carbon losses. In the non-polarized cell, the phenolic reactants diffused to the anode chamber and when the cell was polarized, a brown buildup was observed.36 This was consistent with the guaiacol oxidation in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments which turned the guaiacol-containing catholyte from colorless into dark orange or brownish.50 Moreover, the organic crossover was more noticeable at low current densities, while at higher superficial current densities (>|150 mA cm−2|), the crossover was minimized by the counter flux of electro-osmotic water associated with proton migration from anode to cathode. Nevertheless, higher catalyst loading in the SSER could also be responsible for lowering the carbon recovery due to the adsorption of organics on the supported catalyst.51
Electrocatalyst durability tests demonstrated that spent Pt/C catalysts remained active for ECH of guaiacol, despite the morphological changes after exposure to acidic or alkaline environment.50 By a simple treatment (i.e. washing and drying), the spent catalysts retained activity (>90%) in terms of guaiacol conversion and did not appear to alter the product selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the possibility of agglomeration and nanoparticles loss, mainly on the alkali-treated Pt/C catalyst, consistent with the study of Pt/C instability in alkaline medium.77 Nevertheless, the Pt/C catalyst was still active in the guaiacol ECH using acidic (HClO4) electrolyte, implying its reusability.50 ECH can be used to perform in situ, continuous reduction that activates the catalyst.
In a recent work, the performances of different carbon-supported noble metal catalysts (Pt/C, Ru/C, and Pd/C with the same metal loading of 5 wt%) were evaluated for the ECH of guaiacol (and phenol) in the SSER using different catholyte–anolyte pairs. In the neutral (NaCl) catholyte and acid (H2SO4) anolyte pairs, the reactant conversions and faradaic efficiencies were improved dramatically, implying that the anodic protons transported through the Nafion membrane were effectively utilized for ECH reactions.51 Pt/C showed superior activity than Ru/C and Pd/C in all cases based on the measured reaction rates (Fig. 10). In the ECH of guaiacol, Pt/C worked best in the acidic electrolyte pair (pH < 0.8), however the activity of Ru/C was significantly enhanced in the neutral–acid pair as the catholyte pH increased by the formation of hydroxide ions from water reduction. Ru/C activity was inhibited in the presence of H2SO4 owing to sulfate poisoning,78 therefore the ECH conversions were low in the acid–acid pair. On the other hand, ruthenium-based catalysts were reported to be more active than platinum toward H2 evolution reaction in alkaline media.79,80 The remarkable activity was ascribed to the dispersed individual Ru atoms embedded within the carbon matrix resulting in a lower kinetic barrier for water dissociation than Pt.79 This study hence shows the importance of electrocatalyst and electrolyte synergy in the ECH of phenolic compounds.51

Furthermore, the importance of high working current density (up to 800 mA cm−2) was also identified in the recent study on the electrochemical hydrodeoxygenation of phenolics, including guaiacol, over suspended Pt/C and SiW12 catalysts.72 High guaiacol conversion (95%) was achieved at current density of 250 mA cm−2 and 55 °C, resulting in ∼12% cyclohexane and 56% cyclohexanol selectivities with high F.E. (96%). In this dual-catalyst system, dispersing nanocatalyst particles in the solution could greatly improve the collision rate between reactant and catalyst, thereby favoring ECH rates over HER. This was contrasted to the conventional catalyst-coated electrolysis where the reaction rate is limited by the diffusion of unsaturated reactants to the catalyst (electrode) surface. Efficient deoxygenation to alkanes, often thought to be very difficult in conventional ECH, was demonstrated in this work via aqueous electrolysis.72
3.4. Electrocatalytic reduction of benzaldehyde
Benzaldehyde ECH was studied using different carbon-supported metal catalysts (e.g., Pt/C, Rh/C, Pd/C, Ni/C).40,63 Benzaldehyde showed different reactivity than phenol presumably caused by the different substituting groups that impact the adsorption strength. Compared to benzene, phenol and benzaldehyde interact more weakly with metal surfaces due to steric hindrance from the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups that distorts the ring to undergo coplanar adsorption. The repulsion of the aromatic ring from the metal surface causes the carbonyl group to interact more strongly than the ring, but the overall interaction with the metal is weakened. Consecutive ring saturation of benzyl alcohol was not observed under the applied conditions due to the presence of hydroxymethyl group.40 This was clearly in contrast with phenol, which can undergo ring saturation to cyclohexanone and further hydrogenation to cyclohexanol. Both phenol and benzaldehyde were converted rapidly over Pt/C and Rh/C in TCH and ECH, however Pd is more active than Pt and Rh for benzaldehyde ECH, but slowly catalyzed phenol ECH.40,63 This different reactivity was attributed to the different Pd structure observed: metallic Pd (during benzaldehyde hydrogenation), which had a higher intrinsic activity than beta palladium hydride (β-PdHx, during phenol hydrogenation), suggesting that adsorbed benzaldehyde is more reactive (than adsorbed phenol) toward hydrogen radicals on the three metals (Pt, Rh, Pd).63 The activation energies (kJ mol−1) for the ECH of benzaldehyde decrease in the following order: Ni/C (41) < Pt/C (25) < Rh/C (21) < Pd/C (14). Remarkably, Ni/C was inactive in TCH (at room temperature, 1 bar H2) because of the formation of a passivating hydroxide layer in the absence of electric potential, but showed activity in ECH despite the higher cathodic potentials required for Ni/C (−0.9 V) than for Pt/C, Rh/C, and Pd/C (−0.7 V). However, the overall activation energies were lower and reaction rates were higher for ECH than for TCH (Fig. 11). The ECH rates are influenced by the reactant coverages, the nature of the metals, and cathodic potential.40 Consistent with the previously discussed phenol ECH,61 the benzaldehyde hydrogenation rates increased with the cathodic potentials since the Hads coverages were sustained by electric potential.40 Interestingly, the reaction orders in benzaldehyde differed with the catalyst, i.e. zero (on Pd/C and Ni/C) and one (Pt/C and Rh/C), resulting from the different benzaldehyde coverages affected by the surface negative charge induced by the electric potential. Zero reaction order implied high benzaldehyde coverages and low Hads coverages associated with the fast ECH reaction (on Pd)40,63 and the fast HER reaction (on Ni).40 The reaction order increased as the benzaldehyde coverage decreased with the increasing cathode potential. It was therefore proposed that the electric potential affects the reaction mechanism.40
 Fig. 11  Intrinsic activity of the catalyst in ECH and TCH of benzaldehyde. Reaction rates were higher and activation energies were lower in ECH than in TCH, with the exception of Ni/C (inactive in TCH). ECH conditions: Acetate buffer (pH 5), E (vs. Ag/AgCl) = −0.7 V (for Pt/C, Rh/C, Pd/C) and −0.9 V (Ni/C), at 1 bar N2, stirred at 500 rpm. TCH conditions were all the same, but with 1 bar H2 and no potential applied. Adapted from ref. 40 with permission from Elsevier, Copyright 2018. 
The changes in reaction order observed for benzaldehyde were also reported in the ECH on Pd supported on carbon felt (CF) using a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor, which were caused by changes in benzaldehyde and H surface coverages as a function of the cathode potential.69 The presence of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol) showed a negative impact on ECH rates and F.E. caused by the dilution of the H3O+ concentration that decreased the ionic activity. The impact of the alcohol on ECH was greater as the length of the hydrocarbon chain and/or the concentration increased (Fig. 12). The kinetic analysis suggested that Eley–Rideal (E–R) is the most likely reaction mechanism under the applied conditions (the possible mechanism is presented in Fig. 13) with a simultaneous proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), instead of sequential transfer, which was shown to be energetically favorable for ECH of aldehydes.69,81 L–H mechanisms could not be the case because complete inhibition of HER at high benzaldehyde concentrations was observed and a negative order at high benzaldehyde coverages was predicted with competitive adsorption.69 Mechanistically, ECH could proceed through two different pathways: sequential proton/electron addition or simultaneous proton–electron transfer (via concerted addition of H+ and e− or via H-atom transfer).40,62 The concerted PCET is shown to have lower energy barriers than sequential transfers.54 Higher negative overpotentials are required for the direct reduction of aromatic molecules than for proton reduction, e.g., as shown by benzene reduction: C6H6 + e− → (C6H6)− (E° = −3.18 V), therefore, direct electroreduction of the aromatics followed by proton addition is not a likely pathway.62

In a combined theoretical and experimental study by Lopez-Ruiz et al., a variety of base metals (BMs: Cu, Ni, Zn, Co), and platinum group metals (PGMs: Pd, Rh, Cu) were investigated in the ECH of oxygenated organic compounds, including benzaldehyde.70 DFT calculations were used to estimate the binding energies of the organic molecules and hydrogen on the metals, to draw general structure–activity correlations for ECH and HER in a broad range of applied potential. Both ECH and HER rates were found to correlate with the corresponding binding energies of each respective substrate (aldehyde molecules and atomic hydrogen) with the metals following the Sabatier principle (Fig. 14a and b). It is a qualitative concept in heterogeneous catalysis which states that the interactions between the substrate and the catalyst should be “just right” with an optimum binding strength – not too weak and not too strong. If the interaction is too weak, the substrate will fail to bind to the catalyst and no reaction will take place; conversely, if it is too strong, the substrate may cause poisoning or inhibition and the product fails to dissociate.82 The correlations showed that Pd has an optimum binding energy with benzaldehyde (−3.16 eV), which may explain its best activity and selectivity for the ECH.70 On the other hand, benzaldehyde binds weakly on Cu (−0.70 eV) but strongly on Ru (−4.84 eV) and, as a result, they showed the same ECH activity despite being at the opposite sides of the ECH volcano plot (Fig. 14a). The other metals (Zn, Rh, Co) exhibited negligible ECH rates, while only Ni performance diverged from the predicted binding energy with benzaldehyde. Meanwhile, the HER rates also followed a volcano-type relationship with the hydrogen binding energy as the activity descriptor (Fig. 14b). PGMs remain as the most active HER metals, whereas BMs were less active due to relatively weak or strong interactions with hydrogen.70 PGMs were selective to hydrogenation to benzyl alcohol, while BMs favored radical mechanisms where ECH and HER rates seemed independent of each other (did not require adsorbed H) as indicated by the dimerization product (hydrobenzoin) of α-hydroxybenzyl (the proposed mechanism is depicted in Fig. 14c).70,71 Furthermore, it was noticed that the presence of a ring structure (aromatic) in the aldehyde molecules increased the binding energy by bringing the molecule closer to the surface with a more favorable orientation.70,81 The electrocatalytic activity of a metal catalyst is influenced by the reactant structure and functionality.71 This study proposed that the relationships between ECH rates and binding energies can be directly correlated with reaction mechanisms.70

3.5. Electrocatalytic reduction of complex lignin-relevant compounds
Moving toward lignin conversion by electrocatalytic reduction, more complex molecules (including alkylated phenolics, dimer aromatic ethers, and bio-oil-derived substrates) have been investigated to better understand the reactivity of different lignin functionalities. Depending on the biomass source and the fractionation method, monomer contents (aromatics, phenolics) in lignin may vary. Recently, pyrolysis of lignin streams obtained from extractive ammonia processing of corn stover and copper-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide extraction of poplar, has identified major lignin monomers, such as 4-vinylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol, syringol, guaiacol, and phenol.13 The ECH of these phenolics, in addition to some related alkyl phenols and aryl methyl ethers, was studied by Garedew et al. in a pair of 0.2 M HCl (catholyte) and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (anolyte) over ruthenium on activated carbon cloth (Ru/ACC) at low operating current (100 mA) and high temperature (80 °C).13 In addition to hydrogenation, C–O and C–C hydrogenolysis were observed whereby conversion of the alkyl phenols decreased with increasing alkyl chain length, which also shifted selectivity to favor 2-methoxycyclohexanols over the demethoxylated products. Increasing substrate concentration was also found to improve F.E. up to a plateau at higher concentrations. Similar trends were also noticed elsewhere,50,69 showing that higher substrate concentrations positively affected F.E. due to higher surface coverages of the organic reactants.
In another study by Zhou et al.,76 high phenolic substrate conversions (95–100%) were achieved with high F.E. (80–93%) in a mild ECH using boron-doped PtNi nanoparticles encapsuled into ordered mesoporous carbon (PtNiB/CMK-3) catalyst. The experiments were carried out in a electrolyzer cell with a catalyst coated-membrane (CCM) configuration. The remarkable electrocatalyst performance was mainly attributed to the boron-doping effect in optimizing the catalyst alloy surface electron structure which promotes the adsorption of substrate and related intermediates. The large specific surface area and uniform mesoporous structure of CMK-3 also maximized the number of exposed active sites and facilitated electrolyte diffusion and ion transport.76
In the electrocatalytic hydrogenolysis (ECH) of lignin model dimers (e.g., benzyl phenyl ether, β-phenoxyethylbenzene, and α-phenoxyacetophenone) using Ra–Ni electrode in a solution of sodium chloride mixed with aqueous ethanol, Mahdavi et al. reported that hydrogenolysis of the ether bonds must be faster than the aromatic ring saturation in order to degrade lignin efficiently via a hydrogenation process.43 The depolymerization of lignin by ECH of C–O linkages seemed feasible by choosing the proper substrate concentration, current density, and temperature. The presence of methoxy groups on both aryl rings of the benzyl phenyl ether moieties, which could be found in the structure of lignin, apparently did not drastically affect the ECH efficiency (Table 4, entries 2–5). The ECH of a benzyl-O-alkyl bond was much less efficient than that of a benzyl-O-phenyl bond as shown by the lower conversion rates and current efficiencies (Table 4, entries 6–7 vs. entry 2). Cleavage of α-aryl and β-aryl ethers is important in the lignin depolymerization. The ECH of β-phenoxyethylbenzene resulted in lower conversion and current efficiency than the ECH of benzyl phenyl ether and α-phenoxyacetophenone (Table 4, entry 8 vs. entries 2 and 9). These results showed that, under the reaction conditions, the C–O bond conjugated to one phenyl ring (βC–O bond) was more difficult to cleave than the C–O bond conjugated to two phenyl rings (αC–O bond). Steric interactions could make the adsorption of the substrate on the catalyst surface and the reaction with chemisorbed hydrogen more difficult, thereby decreasing the ECH efficiency. The more difficult (slower) the hydrogenolysis, the more HER becomes dominant. In some cases, the overestimated current efficiencies (>100%) indicated that chemisorbed hydrogen was present on the electrode at the beginning of the electrolysis. This work demonstrated important insights in the ECH of lignin model compounds with higher functionalities, however, the major products were unfortunately not specified clearly and the applied current densities were extremely low (i.e. 0.2 to 1.6 mA cm−2).43

In a recent study, the conversion of di-aryl ethers, including benzyl phenyl ether (BPE), diphenyl ether (DPE), and p-tolyl ether (PTE) was performed via TCH and ECH in water-isopropanol (needed to dissolve the ether) mixtures at room temperature and atmospheric pressure over Rh/C.62 The steric effects were also observed in this study as the reactivities of the aryl ethers increased as follows: PTE < DPE < BPE. The highest reactivity of BPE is attributed to the lower dissociation energy of the α-O-4 bond (218 kJ mol−1) than that of 4-O-5 bond in DPE (314 kJ mol−1), whereas PTE is the least reactive because of the steric repulsion induced by the methyl groups. In all cases (Table 5), the conversion of di-aryl ethers was slower than the conversion of phenolic compounds (e.g., phenol, 4-methylphenol, and 4-methoxyphenol). The reaction network for the di-aryl ethers conversion involves hydrogenation (aromatic ring saturation), hydrogenolysis, and hydrolysis pathways with different selectivities depending on the substrate type. Under overall TCH and ECH conditions, the most selective pathway was hydrogenolysis (59–63%) for BPE and hydrogenation (69–73%) for DPE and PTE (Fig. 15). However, for all the substrates, by the measured reaction rates (in 10−5 mol s−1 g−1Rh) under ECH conditions, the hydrogenation pathways were faster (1.6–2.5) than hydrogenolysis (0.4–2.1) and hydrolysis (0.1–0.3), resulting in fully ring-saturated products (e.g., cyclohexyl methylcyclohexyl ether from BPE and dicyclohexylether from DPE) as the major products.

3.6. Electrocatalytic reduction of bio-oil substrates
In the ECH work using real feedstocks pioneered by Li et al.,68 water-soluble bio-oil (WSBO) was reacted in the pair of 0.2 M NaCl (catholyte) and 1 M H2SO4 (anolyte) over Ru/ACC at mild conditions (27 °C and 1 atm in), but relatively high cathode potential (−7.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). WSBO is difficult to upgrade thermochemically because water is detrimental to most catalysts at higher temperature. The WSBO used in this work contained most of the carboxylic acids and carbonyl groups present in raw bio-oil and was obtained by mixing bio-oil (from pyrolysis of poplar) with water (a mass ratio of 1:4), followed by 30 minutes of sonication. This work demonstrated that ECH can convert most of the aldehydes and ketones in WSBO to their corresponding alcohols (the major products were ethylene glycol and propylene glycol) after 6.5 h. Under the operating conditions, no coke formation was observed (carbon recovery >80%), but small amounts of solid precipitate were found in the cathode chamber during electrolysis. Carbon losses were also caused by migration to the anode through the membrane (6%), adsorption on the cathode (2.6%), and drift to the water trap (0.2%). The additional unidentified carbon losses could be from the organics attached to the membrane (as it turned black after the ECH reaction) and oxidation of the organics at the anode. This report clearly suggests that the system used in this work could still be improved further. Nevertheless, accelerated aging test followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) indicated that ECH stabilizes bio-oil against polymerization. The addition of cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was also found to facilitate the solubility of the organics by partitioning into a hydrophobic layer attached to the negatively charged electrode surface in a greater extent than for H3O+, thereby favoring higher catalyst surface coverage by organics. As a result, the efficiency of the WSBO ECH with addition of 2 mM CTAB was improved by 4–10%. Increases in alcohol carbon content and polyhydric alcohol selectivity in WSBO were also reported elsewhere after ECH using well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles anchored in ordered mesoporous carbon (Ru@OMC) as electrocatalyst.83
More recently, electrochemical upgrading of pine pyrolysis oil was reported using a newly devised reactor that employed a so-called dual membrane cell (DMC) consisting of a cation-exchange membrane (CEM) and an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) based on electrodialysis system.67 There are three chambers in this configuration: bio-oil contacts a cathode bonded to an AEM, water oxidizes at an anode bonded to a CEM, while organic acids carry charge to the center concentrate stream for collection (Fig. 16). In the DMC, the cathode pH increases by proton consumption (for reducing the oil and co-forming H2 gas) while the concentrate pH decreases by accumulation of protons from the anolyte and anions from the catholyte. This novel cell design could resolve the problem in a CEM configuration (e.g. Nafion) related to the transport of protons from the anode to the cathode along with the electro-osmotic flow of water carried by protons. Additionally, the removal of small acids and other anions from bio-oil could also help reduce the hydrogen requirements for catalytic hydrotreating in subsequent processing. Despite the new technology, the ECH of bio-oil demonstrated in this study was operated at low current (10–50 mA) and high cell voltage (4 to >10 V) and no bio-oil hydrogenation products were specified. Instead, total acid number (TAN), phenolic acid number (PhAN), and carboxylic acid number (CAN) were reported. The decrease in TAN was observed with a decrease in the reactive carbonyl (aldehydes and ketones) concentration and indicated by pH increase from 2.6 to over 4. However, no appreciable change in PhAN was noticed, indicating the limited aromatic reduction. This preliminary work describes an electrochemical process mainly for stabilization of bio-oil prior to hydrotreating at high pressure and temperature.

The trivial reactivity of carboxylic acids and phenolics was also noticed in the ECH of bio-oil (10 wt%) in the presence of benzaldehyde (80 mM) over Pd.71 The bio-oil substrate was obtained via fast pyrolysis of a mixture of hybrid poplar (70%), wheat straw (15%), and forest thinnings (15%). The results showed that PhAN and CAN remained constant regardless of the applied current (−50 to −700 mA), suggesting that the phenolics and carboxylic acids present in the bio-oil could not be electrocatalytically upgraded.71 In the presence of bio-oil, benzaldehyde conversion to benzyl alcohol also decreased, implying that the organics in the bio-oil competitively reacted with the benzaldehyde.69,71 In terms of the catalytic activity, Pd and Cu were shown to be the best-performing catalysts in the benzaldehyde ECH among the tested noble metals and base metals, respectively.69,71 However, upon introduction of the bio-oil, Cu was deactivated, while Pd initial activity was recovered even after exposures to different feed compositions and operational conditions.71 Consistent with the previous work,67 the ECH of pyrolysis bio-oil could only reduce the carbonyl content (aldehydes and ketones) in the substrate under the operating conditions.71
Interactions among bio-oil compounds during electrochemical treatment were observed in a recent work by Deng et al.84 The electrolysis of the whole bio-oil, the water-soluble (aromatic-poor) fraction, and the water-insoluble (aromatic-rich) fraction resulted in different trends. The aromatic-rich fraction tended to undergo condensation, forming large-molecular-weight compounds, while this aromatic condensation was suppressed in the whole bio-oil. This trend was attributed to the presence of light components (carbohydrate-derived compounds) in bio-oil which were reactive and enhanced the hydrogenation reaction. The aromatic and phenolic contents were reduced in all the bio-oil substrates with a prolonged processing time (∼12 h).84 Mild ECH of deoxidized bio-oil from microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis of corn stover could also significantly increase the relative content of alcohols and decrease the relative contents of acids, esters, carbonyls, phenols, sugars, and furans;85 however the reaction mechanisms and specific product yields were not yet discussed in detail in all the aforementioned examples. Due to the inherent complexity of bio-oil, specific product selectivity and current efficiency quantifications are presently very difficult to measure the process performance. ECH of bio-oil has been increasingly studied in recent years, but thus far it works mainly for stabilization toward polymerization rather than hydrogenation purposes.67,71,86 Effective reduction of oxygenated aromatic and unsaturated compounds in the bio-oil via ECH and the subsequent selective product purification remains a challenge to be addressed in the future.
4. Electrochemical depolymerization of lignin
Lignin depolymerization via electrochemical process, likewise the bio-oil electrocatalytic upgrading, has been increasingly studied over the last few years88–97 although it is not as prevalent as the ECH of lignin model compounds. It is noteworthy that electrochemical depolymerization reactions of lignin are based on oxidative routes (i.e. ECO) as opposed to the ECH of bio-oil or lignin monomers which follow reductive pathways. None of the published works on this topic have employed acidic electrolytes. This is due to the fact that lignin is soluble in alkaline solutions rather than in acidic media. Lignin solubility is affected by the ratio of the number of phenolic hydroxyls to the number of phenylpropane units in the macromolecule (the higher ratio means the higher solubility).17 Consequently, several fundamental differences are obvious: (i) electrochemical depolymerization of lignin is mostly performed on the anode using alkaline solutions (e.g., NaOH),88–91 (ii) lignin is degraded in the presence of reactive oxygen species, such as ˙OH radicals, which drive the charge transfer reactions,90,91 (iii) the cathodic water reduction generates OH− ions which are consumed in the anodic oxygen evolution reactions, thus an anion exchange membrane (AEM) is required in a divided cell configuration.
A simplified, plausible ECO reaction mechanism involves the following elementary steps:
• Hydroxyl radical chemisorption and metal oxide formation: H2O + M → M·OH + e− + H+(14) M·OH → MO + e− + H+(15)
• Organic adsorption on the catalyst adsorption sites (A): (R–H2) + A ↔ (R–H2)·A(16)
• Oxygenation between the adsorbed organics and the chemisorbed oxygen: (R–H2)·A + MO ↔ (RH–OH)·A + M(17) (RH–OH)·A + MO ↔ (RO)·A + H2O + M(18)
• Desorption of the oxygenated product: (RH–OH)·A ↔ RH–OH + A(19) (RO)·A ↔ RO + A(20)
The competitive pathway to ECO, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism can be proposed as follows:
• Electrochemical desorption of oxygen: M·OH + M·OH → O2 + 2 M + 2e− + 2H+(21)
• Thermal desorption of oxygen: MO + MO → O2 + 2M(22)
Cyclic voltammetry analyses of different electrolytes, including H2SO4 and NaOH (at the same concentration of 0.2 M), revealed that while acidic electrolytes are more appropriate for ECH (owing to the least negative potentials for HER), alkaline electrolytes are desirable for electro-oxidation purposes (due to the least positive potentials for OER);50 all of those would be directly related to the energy consumption in the electrolysis cell.
Comprehensive reviews on electrocatalytic treatment of lignin, mainly focusing on the ECO routes, including exploration of various anode types, is recently published elsewhere.98,99 The primary focus of this review is otherwise on the ECH of lignin derivatives. A concise, general review on recent progress in lignin electrochemical depolymerization is also presented here since the overall process is pertaining to the electrochemical valorization of lignin. Insights can be drawn by comparatively analyzing the fundamental differences between the ECH and ECO pathways.
The experimental results and conditions from the recent works in this area are summarized in Table 6. In a study by Zhu et al., lignin in alkaline electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was directly electro-oxidized on the anode and chemically oxidized by the electro-generated H2O2 formed on the cathode simultaneously in a non-diaphragm electrolytic cell.88 The reactions are shown below: Anode: 4OH− − 4e− → O2 + 2H2O(23) Cathode: O2 + 2H2O + 2e− → H2O2 + 2OH−(24)

The results showed that H2O2 and its decomposition products called reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g., HO˙, ˙O2−, HOO˙), play crucial roles in lignin electrochemical depolymerization. Higher concentrations of H2O2 and ROS resulted in higher yields of low molecular weight (LMW) products. The most optimum result in which 59% of lignin depolymerized was achieved from 1 hour-electrolysis at 80 °C with a current density of 8 mA cm−2 with extra O2 supplement. The LMW products were recovered in diethyl ether phase (e.g., vanillin, syringaldehyde) and aqueous phase (e.g., phenol, phenylacetic acid, p-coumaric acid) with the solid product in between the layer having the average molecular weight (Mw) of 1000. Increasing temperature favored more products in aqueous phase (phenols and acids) because more ROS were produced that favored the formation of products with hydrophilic functional groups. In contrast, increasing current density resulted in more products in ether phase (aldehydes and ketones) by cleavage of C–C bonds through the anodic oxidation.88
Different products were reported by Wang et al. in the electrocatalytic oxidation of aspen lignin over Pb/PbO2 anode.89 The lignin oxidation was accelerated with the increasing current density from 20 to 50 mA cm−2, however the rates decreased at j > 50 mA cm−2 presumably owing to the lowered F.E. The major products were 4-methylanisole, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. The yields of 4-methylanisole increased with temperature (from 30 to 50 °C) as the oxidants (˙OH radicals) were decomposed at the higher temperature and after 8 h, the cumulative yield of 4-methylanisole reached 343.3 (g kg−1 lignin) at nearly complete lignin degradation. The formation of 4-methylanisole proceeded as lignin was first cracked to intermediates by ˙OH radical oxidation and subsequently hydrogenated by H atom from alkaline water reduction. Although the general reaction equations on anode and cathode were described, the reaction mechanisms on the electrode surface were not discussed. In the electrochemical oxidation of lignin at a rotating disk electrode (RDE) with Co core/Pt partial shell alloy electrocatalysts, Movil-Cabrera et al. reported CV analyses (in 1 M KOH solution) at different scan rates (50–500 mV s−1) indicating that: (i) the mechanism of lignin oxidation is complex and possibly involves many competing homogeneous chemical and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions, (ii) the electrochemical process is not reversible and likely under diffusion control, (iii) the charge transfer reactions involving lignin are partially driven by ˙OH radicals with a single electron transfer.90
A recent work by Stiefel et al. demonstrated lignin depolymerization in an electrochemical membrane reactor coupled with an in situ product separation based on membrane filtration.91 The subsequent filtration step is necessary for the removal of depolymerization products from the reactor in order to prevent overoxidation and allow a higher yield of LMW compounds in the product solution. Different nickel electrode structures (e.g., plate, wire, fleece, and foam) were investigated at the applied currents of 2, 4, 6, and 8 A using 1 M NaOH electrolyte. Materials with higher porosities show lower mass transport coefficients (plate > foam > wire > fleece) due to the longer diffusion paths of the substrate to the electrode surface. However, the product molecular weight measurements at the different working currents showed the strongest depolymerization with the foam stack electrode, whereas no cleavage was appreciated on the plate electrode. Possible reasons were attributed to the different hydrodynamics, but no real conclusions were made. Lignin molecular weight was reduced by 96% after 11 hours (at room temperature and 8 A) over the nickel foam stack. This work fairly reported the product identification and quantification results. No main product was identified while some of the quantified compounds (e.g., vanillin, apocynin, syringaldehyde) did not exceed 0.5% individual yield. Complete identification and quantification of the produced LMW compounds was still recognized as a challenge. The amount of LMW compounds in the product solution were around 150 g mol−1 and this work overall exhibits complete electrochemical depolymerization of lignin with the effective continuous separation of monomers and unreacted lignin.91
In another study, Di Marino et al. reported the use of deep eutectic solvents (DES) to dissolve kraft lignin in combination with electrochemical oxidative depolymerization.92 The solubility tests indicated that ethylene glycol–choline chloride mixture (1:2 molar ratio) was the best solvent to dissolve lignin (100 g L−1) and the conductivity was improved by adding 10% water without affecting the lignin solubility. DES have similar electrochemical and rheological properties as ionic liquids (IL)93 but not reactive with water. The experiments were conducted in an undivided cell with nickel electrode at the chosen oxidation potentials of 0.5 V and 1.0 V and room temperature. SEC results (Fig. 17) showed that the DES-water solvent resulted in more pronounced LMW peaks compared to the pure DES with the degree of depolymerization of 65–80% after 24 h (Mw = 2598–3288 g mol−1 for the reacted lignin and 93–122 g mol−1 for the lignin extract). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results identified guaiacol, vanillin, apocynin, and syringaldehyde as the most abundant products recovered using a liquid–liquid extraction. Potential limitations of DES utilization may be associated with the solvent recoverability and possible side reactions owing to the binary mixture degradation.92

Overall, electrochemical depolymerization of lignin is an attractive approach for production of aromatic compounds under mild conditions. This oxidative process, however, is less developed than the electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives. The crucial bottlenecks are the lack of selectivity and low product yields.94 Moreover, the exact pathways and governing mechanisms during the reactions are yet unclear,91,92 leaving huge opportunities for future developments.
5. Perspectives on the potentials, challenges, and research opportunities
In summary, electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives is a promising approach for mild synthesis of renewable value-added chemicals from biomass. It is essentially a chemical storage technology with a promise of economic and environmental benefits for future biorefineries. The potency of redox reactions in water electrolysis, which internally produce hydrogen and oxygen as the natural reducing and oxidizing agent, is harnessed to catalytically upgrade the organic substrates. The sustainability of this process could also be promoted via synergistic integration with renewable electricity sources, further improving the hydrogen economy. Diverse electrolyte choices, including mineral acid (H2SO4, HClO4, HCl), organic acid (CH3COOH), inorganic salt (NaCl), and mineral base (NaOH) render the ECH process operations more flexible adapting with the water electrolysis technologies. Recent applications of stirred catalyst suspension with different electrolyte pairs enable high current density electrolysis over the extended electrocatalyst options, thereby improving the practical feasibility of the ECH process.
At present, ECH has been, however, applied mostly to lignin model compounds and limitedly to bio-oil rather than the lignin from biomass. ECH of lignin is not available to date, to the best of our knowledge, because lignin is not soluble in acidic electrolytes. Conceptually, it is possible to depolymerize lignin in a mixed organic and aqueous electrolyte via ECH pathways. However, high temperature and super acid catalysts might be required to facilitate HDO reactions, which usually involve dehydration steps. These conditions are not preferable for the electrocatalytic reduction pathways because at least three components are required: (i) organic solvent, (ii) high-temperature reactor, (iii) bifunctional catalyst, which already characterized thermochemical routes. Hence, it is understandable that lignin depolymerization is carried out via ECO rather than ECH. On the other hand, ECO of lignin model compounds is less prevalent than ECO of real lignin, presumably because the ECO process targets pulp delignification and lignin degradation rather than chemical synthesis. In this regard, ECH is potentially more useful approach for synthesis purposes.
Electrochemical pathways are however still attractive with the possibility of performing simultaneous redox reactions in a single cell. For example, ECH of model compounds (or bio-oil) in a cathode coupled with ECO of lignin in an anode. Moreover, if the target product is monomeric chemical (e.g., cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol), ECH can be very competitive toward TCH, due to its milder reaction conditions with greener H2 source and no need for organic solvent. On the industrial scale, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone are produced by either phenol hydrogenation (140–170 °C, 1 atm) or cyclohexane oxidation (140–180 °C, 0.8–2 MPa).64 Synthesis of commodity organic chemicals via ECH and/or ECO offers greener approaches which can be competitive to the petroleum-based conventional processes. Potentials, challenges, and possible pathways forward in the electrocatalytic routes for lignin valorization are identified based on the current understanding of this field.
5.1. Conductive, organic electrolyte to enhance substrate solubility
While lignin model compounds, including phenolics, aromatics, and dimers, have been widely explored, the ECH of real substrates (e.g., pyrolysis bio-oil) has not been yet evaluated in detail. The complex nature of bio-oil and the limited operating conditions are among the critical factors that need to be addressed for large-scale implementation of this process.29 Most of the ECH studies have used aqueous electrolytes for model reactants with low concentrations, however higher molecular weight organic substrates are not soluble in water. The solubility issues would also occur with the increasing oxygen removal from the substrates, leading to the formation of hydrophobic layers in the reaction media. This phase separation would dramatically cause mass transport and electron transfer limitations, lowering the substrate conversion, electrolyte conductivity, and current efficiency. Organic solvent addition, such as alcohols or acetone, facilitates the reactant dissolution, however their presence could suppress the ECH rates, either by decreasing the activity of H3O+ ions or by competitively occupying the active sites of the catalyst. A conductive, water-soluble organic solvent, such as methanesulfonic acid, might be a useful electrolyte for this purpose. Besides the requirements for high current density (>|100 mA cm−2|), higher substrate concentrations are also necessary toward the large scale applications. The presence of the electrically conductive organic solvent as supporting electrolyte could hence play an important role in the ECH of larger organic substrates. Likewise, a conductive, organic base electrolyte may also be desirable for advancing the lignin electrochemical depolymerization.
5.2. Improved reactor design for a robust, high temperature electrosynthesis
Some challenges in the electrochemical upgrading process are also related to the reactor design. Most ECH studies were carried out in a glass H-type cell configuration with a batch mode of operation. This reactor type, while convenient for laboratory scale testing of different ECH conditions, normally employs a large inter-electrode gap and a membrane, which contribute to high ohmic resistance for electron transfer, resulting in voltage losses. This technical issue has been recognized in some literatures50,62,68 and a solid polymer electrolyte ECH cell has been recommended to reduce the distance between electrodes (and hence the cell voltage), thus enhancing the energy efficiency.68 High temperature electrochemical reactor may also be necessary for hydrodeoxygenation reactions, particularly if the target product is liquid alkane. Conversion of oxygenated compounds to alkanes typically involves dehydration of alcohols, which is endothermic by nature and thermodynamically limited by the reaction equilibrium in the presence of water,50 thus high temperatures (>100 °C) are necessary for high yield production. The durability and cost of the membrane should also be taken into consideration in the reactor design with the critical opportunity to employ dual membrane configuration for simultaneous redox reactions. A good membrane for electrolyzer has to be mechanically stable (able to resist elevated temperature up to 100–120 °C and pressure up to 30 bar) and chemically stable (inert toward reducing and oxidizing chemicals, e.g., H2 and O2).100 A recent study of Nafion-117 stability at elevated temperature (110–150 °C) and pressure (5–7 bar) showed the possibility of operating water electrolysis at those conditions with sufficient membrane hydration.101 Online measurement of H2 and O2 generated from the water electrolysis will also be an important addition to the electrochemical reactor system in order to evaluate more precisely the electrical efficiency.
5.3. Electrocatalyst design and development
ECH processes still rely on noble metals for stability and efficiency owing to the requirements of high proton concentration, which can be supplied by acidic electrolytes. Platinum-based catalysts (e.g., Pt/C) are most effective in acidic media while ruthenium has been increasingly used in alkaline media considering its stability.13,35,50,51 Non-precious metals (e.g. Ni, Cu, Co, Zn)36,70,71 have also been evaluated in the ECH of lignin model compounds and some of them exhibited good catalytic activity even though the stability and selectivity under different pH conditions are still questionable. These catalysts were mostly used for hydrogenation, ring saturation, or partial deoxygenation purposes, however the applications of bifunctional catalysts (as in the thermocatalytic processes) for electrocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation reactions are still underexplored. The recent applications of heteropoly acid in the ECH of phenolics72 could facilitate the future electrocatalytic upgrading of bio-oil to produce higher yields of fully deoxygenated products in a dual catalyst system. For better understanding the reaction and electron transfer mechanisms, impacts of different support materials (e.g., conductive vs. non-conductive, hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic) need a comprehensive investigation, including evaluation of the electrocatalyst durability and reusability after reduction and/or oxidation reactions, which is currently underexplored. In thermochemical routes, catalyst deactivation mechanisms include coking, sintering, and poisoning, which could be triggered by elevated temperature conditions. In electrochemical routes, catalyst deactivation may be caused by agglomeration and loss of metal nanoparticles, as reported in case of Pt/C in alkaline medium.77 Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, detailed studies on electrode reusability, including the effects of different organic substrates and electrode materials on the turnover number, are at present non-existent for the biomass upgrading applications. Development of an active, selective, and stable electrocatalyst, targeting earth-abundant materials, is essential to advance the sustainability of the ECH and ECO processes.
5.4. Future research opportunities
In a broader context, the feasible integration of electrocatalytic valorization of lignin derivatives with renewable electricity sources and thermocatalytic processes (for the fractionation stage) offers a promising future biorefinery scheme and many research opportunities. The contrasting nature and environment for effectively degrading and upgrading lignin represents intrinsically interesting challenges toward the future realization of this process. The water alkaline and PEM-acid electrolysis infrastructures could potentially be applied for the electrochemical depolymerization of lignin and the electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives, respectively. The following key research areas are highlighted for further investigation and development toward the practical applications of this process:
(1) Simultaneous reduction and oxidation for lignin valorization, for instance, by using a dual membrane cell configuration with different catholyte and anolyte pair,
(2) Continuous electrocatalytic reduction in a flow cell reactor using a slurry mode, such as fluidized bed or moving bed electrode, for a large-scale electrosynthesis,
(3) Electrocatalytic upgrading of bio-oil substrates for producing higher aromatic and alkane yields using a robust, high temperature-enabled electrochemical reactor design with bifunctional catalyst,
(4) Selective and efficient electrosynthesis of industrially important chemicals (e.g., cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) under mild conditions at high working current densities,
(5) Theoretical studies and molecular simulations combined with in situ microscopic, structural, compositional characterizations regarding the interactions between different organic molecules and different metal catalyst surfaces and their effects on the ECH as well as HER catalysis.
(6) Techno-economic assessment on the feasibility of electrocatalytic technologies for prospective biorefineries.
Overall, the electrocatalytic process for lignin valorization represent promising pathways that currently serve three major purposes: (i) synthesis of renewable chemicals and fuels, (ii) stabilization of biomass or lignin derived oils, (iii) degradation of lignin substrates. Insights from this review are applicable to the electrocatalytic upgrading pathways of biomass derivatives, for either lignin- or carbohydrate-derived substrates. The integration of pyrolysis, ECH, and hydrotreatment processes for bio-oil production, stabilization, and upgrading powered by renewable electricity from solar or wind in a distributed biomass processing station has been proposed for the production of sustainable carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals (Fig. 18).84,86 Despite all the advantages and advances in the electrochemical routes for lignin valorization, the remaining technological barriers need to be addressed before an economically feasible and scaled-up process can be designed.99 Interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts are imperative to accelerate the progress in this area, aiming for the integration of renewable energy and biorefinery to provide our society with clean and sustainable chemical products.

 	Fig. 1  General schematic illustration of lignocellulosic biomass transformation into bio-products (fuels, chemicals, and/or polymeric materials). The overarching goal of this process is to deconstruct the complex structure of biomass and upgrade the resultant substrates, i.e. carbohydrate-rich streams (hydrolysate) and lignin-derived streams (bio-oil) into higher value products. Traditionally, the reductive upgrading pathways are done via thermocatalytic processes. As a novel approach, the electrocatalytic reduction of lignin derivatives is the primary focus of this review.	 

 	Fig. 2  Lignocellulosic biomass structure consists of cellulose (crystalline), hemicellulose, and lignin (amorphous). Lignin primary building blocks (monolignols) are shown (upper image), adapted from ref. 7, with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, Copyright 2012.

 	Fig. 17  Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results after lignin electro-depolymerization in deep eutectic solvents (DES) at (a) 0.5 V and (b) 1 V and in DES dissolved with 10% water at (c) 0.5 V and (d) 1 V (— untreated lignin, - - - lignin after 7 h, and ∙∙∙∙∙ lignin after 24 h reaction). Insets show visual appearances of the lignin solution at the corresponding conditions, suggesting the brighter color of the extracted solution indicated the lower molecular weight distribution.
