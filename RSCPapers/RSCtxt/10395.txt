    , Accepted 14th August 2014First published on 18th August 2014AbstractTwo symmetrical planar star shaped organic small molecules TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (1) and DMM-TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (2) with TPA and fused TPA core donors, respectively, and three branched DTS-PyBTTh3 units were synthesized and characterized. These small molecules were used as donor materials along with PC71BM as acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on 1 and 2 is about 2.87% and 3.83%, respectively, when the active layers were processed in chlorobenzene (CB) solvent. The higher PCE of the solar cell based on 2 may be attributed to its low bandgap and broad absorption profile as compared to 1. The PCE of the solution-processed BHJ solar cells was improved up to 3.88% and 5.81% for 1 and 2, respectively, when active layers were processed with 0.4% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as additive in the CB solvent. The enhancement in the PCE was mainly because of the increase in Jsc and FF. The increase in the Jsc and FF may be attributed to the balance charge transport between the electron and hole transport and reduction in the bimolecular recombination, leading to an increase in the PCE.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their potential in low cost solar energy harvesting compared with silicon based solar cells, as well as promising applications in flexible, light weight, and large area devices.1–4 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells that contain a blend film of a conjugated material and fullerene derivatives, such as phenyl-C61 or C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM) as the active layer have been studied most extensively.5–8 Through the optimization of molecular structure and device architecture, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 10% has recently been achieved,9,10 giving hope for the prospects of commercialization. At present, the most efficient donor used for BHJ OSCs are low bandgap semiconducting polymers composed of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzodithiophene (poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodi-thiophene)) (PTB) series. The BHJ OSCs fabricated using these materials and6,6-phenyl-C(61 or 71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC (61 or 71)BM) have achieved PCE of up to 9.2%.11 These OSCs with potential applications in next generation solar cells can compete with inorganic solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells. However, polymer based materials suffer from poor reproducibility of the weight average molecular weight, high dispersity and difficulties in purification.
Moreover, OSCs using small molecules as electron donors have also received increasing attention because of the advantages of easy synthesis and purification, well defined structures, good charge mobility and better batch to batch reproducibility.4,12–18 A PCE higher than 8% has recently been reported because of the excellent solubility in organic solvents, broad band light absorption and good charge transport property of the solution-processed SM donor.19,20 Chen and co-workers have achieved a PCE of 8.12% by developing a series of novel SM donors with a benzodithiophene core, a terthiophene spacer, and a rhodamine end-group.21 Very recently, Bazan et al. reported an OSCs based on the small molecule donor of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (ref. 14, 22 and 23) and found that the barium cathode layer can significantly enhance the FF of the device via increasing the charge collection at the cathode. Ultimately, the PCE is improved to 9.02% and is the record value for small molecule OSCs, thus making solution processed small molecule OSCs strong competitors to polymer solar cells.
Most of the small molecules used as donor materials for photovoltaic applications normally contain four key constituents: donor–acceptor units, conjugated bridges, heteroatom substituents and side chains. The creative design, choice of the donor or acceptor units, conjugated bridges and heteroatom substitutions have successfully overcome the shortcomings of the unbalanced charge transport and poor film quality of small molecule OSCs.24–27 By tailoring and substituting the functional groups including donor units, acceptor units, and conjugated bridge, star shaped small molecules with low bandgap and strong and broader absorption, together with highly ordered and interconnected domain can be designed resulting in higher PCE of the OSCs.28–32
Triphenylamine (TPA) is a representative unit to construct star shaped small molecules, due to its good electron donating and high hole transporting abilities. Shang et al. have reported a symmetrical star shaped acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecule compromising of a TPA core and various acceptors.24,33–36 Recently, Min et al., have developed a star type TPA small molecule N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me) and used it as donor component for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells with PC71BM as acceptor and achieved a PCE of 4.76%.30 Inspired by their work, we have synthesized the star shaped small molecules with TPA and fused TPA donor cores for OSCs and achieved a PCE of 4.16%.37 We have also reported various symmetric and unsymmetric push–pull chromophores for solution-processed small molecule OSCs.34–36 The use of such push–pull type structure in small molecules enables efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), providing better molar extinction coefficient and low bandgap.14 Moreover, an electron donating group such as TPA can play an important role in stabilizing the separated hole from an exciton and improving the hole transporting properties37–39.
The electron acceptor unit, thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyBT), has also been explored as a strong electron acceptor in the design of low bandgap copolymers40–45 with high PCE. Recently, Bazan et al. have also explored PyBT based small molecules and copolymers for solution-processed OSCs.46–48
Recently, we have designed two symmetrical star shaped A–D–A small molecules with fluorine substituted benzothiadiazole electron deficient unit and achieved a PCE of 5.16% for organic solar cells processed with chlorobenzene (CB) and DIO–CB solvent, respectively.49 These small molecules showed an optical absorption profile up to 700 nm. To increase the optical absorption profile further, we have used PyBT electron acceptor instead of fluorine substituted benzothiadiazole and designed two symmetrical star shaped small molecules (Fig. 1) TPA-[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (1) and DMM-TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (2). The incorporation of PyBT leads to an extension of the optical absorption profile towards the NIR region, leading to an increased light harvesting efficiency. We have utilized these small molecules as the electron donor along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for the BHJ solar cells and achieved PCE of 2.87% and 3.83% for 1 and 2, respectively. When solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was incorporated into the host CB solvent, the PCE has been improved up to 3.88% and 5.81% for 1 and 2, respectively.

Fabrication of photovoltaic devices and characterization
The BHJ films were prepared as follows: The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, Clevios P VP.AI 4083) in an aqueous solution was spin-cast to form a film with thickness of approximately 50 nm. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C under air and then transferred into a glove box to spin-cast the photoactive layer. Small molecules were combined with PC71BM blend in several ratios (1:1–1:3 w/w) in CB at a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. The blend solutions were spin-cast on the PEDOT layer, and the substrate was dried for 2 h. Then, a thin film of Al (90 nm thick) was deposited on top of the active layer.
All the devices were fabricated and tested under ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The active area of the devices is about 0.20 cm2. The hole and electron only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Au and Al/donor:PC71BM/Al structures, were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobility, respectively.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). A xenon light source coupled with AM1.5 optical filter was used as a light source to illuminate the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and monochromator and resulting current was measured using the Keithley electrometer under short circuit condition.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of TPA-[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (1) and DMM-TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (2)

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic protocol of organic small molecules TPA-[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (1) and DMM-TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (2) starting from the 4-(3,3′-dihexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-7-(5′′-hexyl-2,2′,2′′-terthiophen-5-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (8), which was synthesized from the Stille coupling reaction of 4,7-dibromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine, (3,3′-dihexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)trimethylstannane (3), followed by the Stille coupling reaction with (5′′-hexyl-2,2′,2′′-terthiophen-5-yl)trimethylstannane (4). The 4-(5′-bromo-3,3′-dihexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-7-(5′′-hexyl-2,2′,2′′-terthiophen-5-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (9) was synthesized by bromination of 8 with NBS in CHCl3. The compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized via a microwave assisted Stille coupling reaction between the brominated molecular ‘wing’ 9 and the stannylated molecular ‘core’ of either tris(4-(trimethylstannyl)phenyl)amine (5) or 2,6,10-trimethylstannyl-4,4,8,8,12,12-hexamethyl-4H,8H,12H-benzo[1,9]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7,-defg]acridine (6).

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in CB and thin film form, respectively. The corresponding optical properties are compiled in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption spectra of 1 and 2 exhibit two typical absorption bands in 300–800 nm. The absorption bands observed at lower energies (longer wavelengths) originated from the ICT between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The absorption bands at 300–430 nm were dominated by the HOMO−1 → LUMO excitation that may be assigned to the π–π* transitions. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the ICT bands of 1 and 2 in solution showed molar extinction coefficients of 156000 M−1 cm−1 at 620 nm and 137000 M−1 cm−1 at 630 nm, respectively. In addition, these two small molecules 1 and 2 have a motif similar to that of highly efficient symmetrical A–D–A organic semiconductor DTS-(PTTh2)2, which compromises a DTS donor and two1,2,5-thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PT) acceptors end capped with hexylbithiophene (Th2). These molecules exhibit broad band absorptions and good hole mobility.14

As shown in Fig. 2, absorption bands in thin film of both 1 and 2 were more broad and red–shifted by 15 nm and 25 nm, respectively, as compared to that in solution. This suggests that the strong intermolecular π–π interaction and aggregation exists in the solid state.50,51 The optical bandgaps of 1 and 2 were calculated to be 1.67 eV and 1.62 eV by the absorption onset 742 nm and 766 nm, respectively. These values are slightly less than those estimated from absorption and emission cross-peak CB solution.

Fig. 3 shows UV-visible absorption spectra of 1:PC71BM (1:2) and 2:PC71BM (1:2) films. The ICT bands of 1 and 2 observed in 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM blend films, respectively, were similar and slightly blue shifted relative to those in solid state film. These results indicate that the PC71BM may significantly interrupt the intermolecular π–π packing interactions between the p-type organic semiconductors by interacting with PyBT moieties of 1 and 2 in the blend films.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the small molecules were estimated from the oxidation and reduction onsets, respectively, observed in cyclic voltammograms of these materials under the assumption that energy level of ferrocene (Fc) was 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels of 1 and 2 were −4.96/−3.56 eV and −5.05/−3.62 eV, respectively, and the corresponding values are summarized in Table 1. The values of LUMO of both 1 and 2 are sufficiently higher than the LUMO of PC71BM (−4.1 eV), indicating that efficient photo-induced charge separation is possible and can be used as donors for the BHJ OSCs.
Theoretical calculations and molecule simulation
The electronic properties of 1 and 2 have also been investigated by theoretical calculations. Fig. 4 shows the optimized structures of 1 and 2, which were calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional/6-31G* basis set. The orbital densities of the HOMOs of 1 and 2 were evenly distributed on TPA core, whereas the orbital densities of LUMOs and LUMO+1 of these materials were located on PyBT moiety. The calculations revealed that the ICT from TPA ‘core’ (HOMO) to PyBT ‘wing’ (LUMO and LUMO+1) can effectively occur in 1 and 2 when excited by light energy.

Hole mobility
The hole mobility is an important parameter for effective charge transport and collection in organic solar cells. The hole mobility of 1 and 2 films was measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2/Au, using the current voltage characteristics in dark. The hole mobilities estimated from SCLC method were about 6.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, for 1 and 2, respectively. The planar structure of 2 may lead to an enhanced transport via efficient intermolecular π–π packing interactions.
Photovoltaic properties
Small molecules 1 and 2 were employed as donor (D) for fabrication of photovoltaic devices along with PC71BM as acceptor (A) with different weight ratios, i.e. 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. The weight ratio of spin D:A (1:2) for both the small molecules resulted in the best photovoltaic performance. We have chosen PC71BM instead of PC61BM as the acceptor counterpart, since the former has a superior spectral response in the visible region. Fig. 5a displays the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 1.5 AM irradiation (100 mW cm−2) OSC fabricated from 1 or 2:PC71BM (1:2 wt ratio), and corresponding values are summarized in Table 2. The higher value of PCE for 2:PC71BM (3.83%) active layer than 1:PC71BM (2.87%) has been attributed to the increased values of Jsc, Voc and FF. The device based on small molecule 1:PC71BM active layer exhibited higher Voc (0.82 V) as compared to that for 2:PC71BM (0.74 V), owing to its lower HOMO energy level. The relatively higher Jsc and FF for the device based on 2 could be attributed to the better hole mobility resulting from the efficient intermolecular π–π packing interactions, due to its planar skeleton. The benzene rings in TPA have ∼35 degree of tilted angle on a nitrogen atom, while the tilt angle in DMM-TPA was considerably smaller because of the DMM bridge between the benzene rings.37 Moreover, the radical cation of DMM-TPA had a nearly planar structure. Thus, we supposed that the DMM-TPA core can facilitate intermolecular packing and increase the lifetime of the charge-separated state in the BHJ system more efficiently than does TPA. The IPCE spectra of these devices are shown in Fig. 5b and the IPCE spectra of devices were in good agreement with the optical spectra of blends, resulting in a close correlation with the photocurrents with J–V characteristics.

The PCE of the BHJ solar cells based on either 1 or 2 as donor is relatively low because of the low values of Jsc and FF. For an efficient organic solar cell, there must be a proper nanomorphology in the thin film BHJ active layer for exciton dissociation and balanced charge transport. We assume that the poor PCE using 1 or 2:PC71BM active layer may be because of an imbalanced charge transport and insufficient nanomorphology of the active layers. Various processing techniques have been developed in order to optimize the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer to improve the PCE of organic solar cells, including thermal annealing,52,53 solvent annealing54 and spontaneous inter-diffusion of the bi-layer heterojunction.55 In addition to the above processing methods, the use of solvent additives was recently employed to enhance the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs.56–58 To improve the PCE of organic devices based on 1 and 2, we have used CN as additive. We have varied the concentration of CN in the solvent from 0.1% to 0.5% by volume and found that the optimized concentration was about 0.4%. Beyond that concentration, the PCE of the solar cell decreases because of the over aggregation of the donor phase, which disturbs the percolating pathways of the acceptor phase and reduces the electron mobility in the BHJ active layer. The over-aggregation of the donor phase may also reduce the effective interfacial area for charge separation and consequently reduce photocurrent generation.59,60 The reduction in PCE may also be attributed to the incomplete drying of the active layer because of the high boiling point of CN. Therefore, we have discussed the effect of solvent additive on the photovoltaic performance of the devices only for the 0.4% (v/v) CN in CB. The J–V characteristics of the devices processed with CN/CB under illumination are shown in Fig. 6 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2.

The PCE of the devices for 1 and 2 have been significantly enhanced up to 3.88% and 5.81%, respectively. The increase in the PCE upon addition of CN arises from the enhancement in FF and Jsc. The increase in Jsc and FF may be attributed to the favorable nanomorphology for active layers and more balanced charge transport in the device processed from CN/CB solvent.
The morphology of the active layer is also very important for the performance of organic solar cells and strongly depends upon its morphological features. To investigate the enhancement in the PCE for solar cells based on the active layers processed with CN/CB solvent, we have also used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to get information about the change in the morphology of the active layer with the addition of solvent additive. The AFM height images for 2:PC71BM casted with and without CN are shown in Fig. 7. Similar AFM images have been observed for 1:PC71BM thin films. The AFM images showed a different surface morphology and the root mean square (rms) values of 2:PC71BM are 1.45 nm and 3.56 nm for with and without CN, respectively. Phase separation between small molecule donor and fullerene acceptor in the domain size (10–20 nm) can provide enough D–A interfaces for exciton dissociation. The phase images in both BHJ active layers also indicate that the nano-phase separation is formed. However, with the addition of CN, the spin coated 2:PC71BM seems clearer than that of the cast using only CB. The lower rms value and clearer nanophase separation therefore lead to higher values of Jsc and FF, resulting in an enhancement in the overall PCE.

We have also recorded transmission electron microcopy (TEM) images of active layers processed with and without CN additives (as shown in Fig. 8 for 2:PC71BM) to get more information about the phase separation. It can be seen from these images that large size aggregations were clearly observed in the film processed with CB only; however, after the solvent additives the domain sizes are significantly reduced, leading to better phase separation. The better phase separation and reduced domain sizes lead to the more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.

Fig. 9 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers cast on ITO substrates. As shown in the Fig. 9a, 1:PC71BM cast from CB solvent exhibits as a broad and weak peak at 2θ = 4.32°, indicating low crystallinity. This peak becomes stronger for the film cast from CN/CB solvent, indicating that CN promotes the crystallinity of 1 when it is incorporated into CB as additive. It was observed that the 2:PC71BM film (Fig. 9b) processed from CB exhibits shows a sharper peak at 2θ = 4.34°, due to more crystallinity induced by molecular co-planarity of 2.

To get information about the effect of solvent additive on charge transport in the photovoltaic devices, we have measured the hole and electron mobilities in the blend cast from CB or CN/CB using the hole only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend layer cast) from CB or CN/CB/Au and electron only (ITO/Al/blend layer cast) from CB or CN/CB/Al devices.28 The hole and electron mobilities were extracted by fitting the current–voltage characteristics (as shown in Fig. 10a and 10b) using the Mott–Gurney relationship as described by following expression:  where J is current density, d is the thickness of the active blend layer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, εo is the permittivity of free space and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport layer, V is the effective voltage in the device given by V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the voltage applied to the device and Vbi is the built-in voltage owing to the relative difference in the work functions of two electrodes and has been estimated from the transition between the ohmic and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) region.61,62 The hole and electron mobilities for the active layer processed with and without additive were estimated from the plots of logJdversus V (Fig. 10). Here we have included the plots only for the devices based on 2:PC71BM active layers. Similar plots have been observed for devices based on 1:PC71BM layers. The values of hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table 3. The low hole mobility and the unbalanced electron–hole transport lead to poor PCE of the organic solar cells based on the active layers processed from only CB solvent. The solvent additive significantly enhances the hole mobility. Moreover, the electron mobility is also improved slightly, and more balanced electron–hole transport is obtained. Under the same conditions, both hole and electron mobilities of 1:PC71BM films are higher than those of 2:PC71BM. Therefore, the more enhanced PCE of 1 is mainly ascribed to its superior charge transport ability because of the planar molecule geometry of fused TPA core and also through the reduction of domain size in the active layer.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis and optical and electrochemical properties of two novel symmetrical planar star molecules TPA-[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (1) and DMM-TPA[DTS-PyBTTh3]3 (2) and used them as donor components along with PC71BM for the fabrication of solution-processed organic BHJ solar cells. The BHJ solar cells based on 1:PC71BM (1:2) and 2:PC71BM (1:2) showed overall PCE of 2.87% and 3.83%, respectively. Higher PCE of 2 than 1 as donor has been attributed to increased values of Jsc, FF and Voc. The larger value of Jsc and FF has been ascribed to the higher value of hole mobility for 2 as compared to 1 due to the planer core for 2, which facilitates charge transport more easily. We found that the PCE of the devices is significantly enhanced for the devices when solvent additive (0.4% CN by volume) is used for film processing, resulting in overall PCE of 3.88% and 5.81% for 1 and 2, respectively. We found that the active layer processed from only CB showed poor phase separation with large domain size, and that charge transport is unbalanced, leading to the lower values for both Jsc and FF. However, the device processed with 0.4% (v/v) CN yields a favorable nanoscale morphology, in which phase separation sufficiently created a percolating pathway for charge transport. We believe that these findings could bring out new approaches in the development of novel small organic molecules.
