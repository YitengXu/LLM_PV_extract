    , Accepted 18th May 2017First published on 18th May 2017AbstractThe effect of embedding Au nanoparticles (NPs) in a BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction for photoelectrochemical water splitting is studied here for the first time. The present nanostructured heterojunction offers three major advantages over pristine BiVO4 and Fe2O3: (i) the formation of a heterojunction between BiVO4 and Fe2O3 enhances the charge carrier separation and transfer, (ii) the layer of Fe2O3 provides protection to BiVO4 from photocorrosion and, (iii) the Au NPs possessing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enhance the photoelectrochemical response by transferring energy to metal oxides by hot electron transfer (HET) and plasmon resonant energy transfer (PRET). The present study reveals that the heterojunction ITO/BiVO4/Fe2O3 (with 32% v/v Au solution in both layers) gives the best performance and mitigates the limitations of both pristine Fe2O3 and BiVO4. A thirteen-fold increment in applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) was observed at 1.24 V vs. RHE under the condition of 1 Sun illumination. Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements indicated that an Au embedded heterojunction is more effective in harvesting visible light in comparison to a heterojunction without Au NPs.
1. Introduction
In the present world there is a strong need to explore green and sustainable energy sources to fulfill the ever-increasing demands for energy. The global energy requirement is vastly furnished through carbon based fuels and there is a compelling need to avail ourselves of the immense power of sunlight and one of the preferred ways is artificial photosynthesis, technically termed photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water for hydrogen generation. Hydrogen has been considered as an ideal alternative future fuel by virtue of its high energy efficiency and non toxicity.1,2 In a photoelectrochemical cell, energy from sunlight absorbed by the semiconductor material is used to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen separately.3
The crucial and key factor deciding the performance that restricts the practical application of PEC is to get the right set of properties in a semiconductor material. The heterojunction system is an effective way to augment the performance of a PEC system. The use of a heterojunction system is associated with the following advantages: (i) enhancement in the range of the solar spectrum absorbed by the semiconductor material, (ii) effective separation of charge carriers and (iii) reduced recombination of charge carriers.4,5 Heterojunction systems for efficient water splitting have been tried with various semiconductor materials like TiO2/Fe2O3,6 α-Fe2O3/WO3,7 WO3/BiVO4,8,9 Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4,10 BiVO4/Cu2O,11 α-Fe2O3/graphene/Mo–BiVO4,12 Ti–Fe2O3/Cu2O,13 Cu2O/SrTiO3,14 BaTiO3/Cu2O,15 and Fe–TiO2/Zn–Fe2O3.16
The use of noble metal nanoparticles possessing plasmonic properties is receiving more and more attention because of their potent use in various light harvesting devices, including photoelectrochemical cells. It is well known that enhancement in light absorption by semiconductor material due to the presence of noble metals is ascribed to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption exhibited by them.17,18 The enhancement in efficiency of solar devices by plasmonic nanoparticles may be attributed firstly to the radiative effects which include both near field and far field enhancement, where nanoparticles create an electric field locally by acting as a secondary light source, and secondly to the non-radiative effect which includes both hot electron transfer and plasmon resonant energy transfer (PRET), where relaxation of SPR increases the generation of current by transferring energy to a semiconductor in close proximity.19,20
The purpose of the present study is to use the heterojunction of BiVO4 and Fe2O3 to enhance the charge carrier separation and transfer and to exploit the favorable aspects of both semiconductors. BiVO4 and Fe2O3 with band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively, absorb the visible portion of sunlight which is desirable for PEC water splitting. It should be noted that BiVO4 shows a suitable band edge position for water oxidation, whereas Fe2O3 is economical and shows stability in an aqueous system. However, BiVO4 suffers from slow water oxidation kinetics and susceptibility towards photocorrosion, while Fe2O3 has a low absorption coefficient and short diffusion length.8,21–24 The idea of heterojunction formation is particularly important to overcome the photocorrosion of BiVO4 by depositing a layer of stable Fe2O3 over BiVO4. The plasmonic Au nanoparticles have been incorporated in both layers, which further enhances the visible light activity of the heterojunction. The present study reveals that plasmonic nanoparticles not only promote the flow of charge carriers but also reduce their recombination. In the Discussion section, the focus is on understanding the mechanism behind the role of Au nanoparticles in enhancing the PEC performance of an Au embedded heterojunction. The suggested mechanism for improving PEC performance is supported by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) and charge carrier separation efficiency measurements.
To the best of our knowledge, an Au embedded BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction system has not been explored so far, although a PEC study on Fe2O3/BiVO4 with graphene as an electron mediator has been demonstrated by Hou et al. and the material exhibited enhanced photoconversion efficiency due to better separation of photogenerated charge carriers.12 In a study of the degradation of Rh B dye and phenol, significantly good photocatalytic activity by Fe2O3/BiVO4 nanoplates has been reported by Cai et al.25
Current–voltage (I–V), light on–off current vs. time, resistance, flat band potential, open circuit voltage, charge transfer resistance and charge carrier separation efficiency measurements were conducted in order to investigate the electrochemical performance of various systems comprising BiVO4, Fe2O3, BiVO4/Fe2O3 and an Au nanoparticles embedded BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction. Besides the evaluation of applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) and Faradaic efficiency, IPCE and APCE measurements were also carried out in order to identify the role of embedded plasmonic Au nanoparticles. The structural and optical properties were studied using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cross sectional SEM, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy.
2. Materials and methods
The chemicals used in the experiment were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, including gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·H2O, 99.99%), tri-sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7, 99%), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, >98%), glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.7%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.99%) and vanadyl acetylacetone (V(acac)2, 98%). The ITO coated glass substrates (dimensions: 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm, resistivity ∼8 Ω cm; SPI supplies, USA) were cleaned before deposition to remove any dirt and impurity particles in a mixture of methanol (CH3OH, 99.8%) and DM water (Avarice Industries) in an ultrasonicator for a duration of 10 minutes followed by oven drying.
2.1. Preparation of Au nanoparticles solution
To synthesize Au nanoparticles a weighed amount of HAuCl4 (10 mg in 95 mL of distilled water) was kept at boiling point (100 °C) and 5 mL of tri-sodium citrate aqueous solution (1% w/v) was added to the boiling solution. A color change from yellow to deep wine red after a few minutes confirmed the formation of Au nanoparticles. The method of preparation has been described elsewhere.28
2.2. Fabrication of Au nanoparticles embedded BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction
An equimolar mixture (0.4 mM) of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate and vanadyl acetylacetone was dissolved in a mixture of acetic acid and water (1:4 ratio) to make the precursor solution for BiVO4. The prepared solution was sprayed using automated spray pyrolysis (Holmarc, India). The flow rate of the solution was maintained at 2 μL min−1 with an air pressure of 2 psi and the distance between the nozzle and the ITO substrate was fixed at 20 cm. The total duration of the spray on the heated ITO substrates (350 °C ± 10 °C) was 1 min with each spray lasting 20 s with a time interval of 30 s between each spray. The Fe2O3 thin films were deposited by a spray pyrolysis method over the prepared BiVO4 thin films. The method of fabrication of Fe2O3 has been reported in the literature.29 For another set of Au nanoparticles embedded Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction samples, the precursor solutions of BiVO4 and Fe2O3 were prepared in 2 mL, 4 mL, 8 mL and 16 mL of Au nanoparticles solution prepared by the citrate reduction method.28 The obtained precursor solutions had Au nanoparticles concentrations of 8% v/v, 16% v/v, 32% v/v and 64% v/v. Approximately one third of the area of the ITO substrate was covered with aluminium foil prior to deposition of the thin film to make ohmic contact with copper wire, silver paste and epoxy (Hysol, Singapore). The thin films so prepared were then converted into photoanodes for use in electrochemical studies. The overall film thickness in the case of the heterojunction samples lies in the range of 1110–1225 nm and was measured using an Alpha step D-Tencor T120 surface profilometer.

2.3. Structural and compositional characterizations
X-ray diffraction patterns for the synthesized films were recorded using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance instrument (Germany) with a Cu Kα (1.54 Å) radiation source. All the samples were scanned at a speed of 2 sec step−1 with 2θ varying from 20° to 60°.
Absorption spectra of all the samples were recorded in the range of 400 to 800 nm to investigate the optical properties using a double beam UV-visible spectrometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). The SEM images were obtained from a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to study the surface morphology using a TESCAN MIRA II LMH system. An EDX (Oxford INCA PentaFETx3) spectrometer attached to the FESEM was used to confirm the elemental composition of all the samples.
2.4. Electrochemical studies
The electrochemical characterization of the prepared photoanodes was performed in a three electrode cell configuration with a counter electrode (Pt mesh), reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode (SCE); Naina Solaris Ltd, India) and working electrode (photoanodes) using a Zahner potentiostat (Germany). The electrodes were immersed in 0.1 M aqueous NaOH (Merck, >99%, pH 13). The potential scan from −1 V per SCE to 1 V per SCE at a fixed scan rate of 20 mV s−1 was done under both dark and visible light conditions to get current–voltage (I–V) plots. A 150 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source for illumination (illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2; Oriel, USA) and the effective area of 1 cm2 (1 cm × 1 cm) for the electrodes was kept constant for all the systems. The resistance of the PEC cell was calculated from the slope of the I–V curve of the sample obtained under dark conditions beyond the breakdown voltage.34
The dark current was subtracted from the light current (under illumination) per unit of the illumination area to obtain the photocurrent density (Jph). Jph was further used to calculate the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the system using eqn (1):30 ABPE (%) = Jph (mA cm−2) × [1.23 − Vapp (V)]/P (mW cm−2) × 100(1)where Vapp is the applied bias and P is the illumination power intensity. Vapp in the case of ABPE calculation is the magnitude of the difference between Vmeas and Voc. Vmeas is the applied bias at which photocurrent was measured. The open-circuit potential (Voc) of the photoanodes was obtained from the I–V curve obtained by illuminating the electrodes.32
Mott–Schottky analysis was performed using the Zahner potentiostat to obtain the capacitance at the semiconductor/electrolyte junction with an ac signal frequency of 1 kHz in the three electrode setup under dark conditions. The plot between 1/C2 and the applied potential (Vapp) was used to calculate the flatband potential (VFB) of the samples using eqn (2).31 (2)where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, ND is the donor density, Vapp is the applied potential, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, and kT/q is the temperature-dependent term. The charge transfer resistance at the semiconductor electrode electrolyte interface was measured using a Nyquist plot in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) in a three electrode setup under illuminating condition using a wideband white LED tunable light source with an output intensity of 1.02 W m−2 attached with a separate monochromator in the 430–720 nm range. The IPCE data and UV-visible absorbance data were utilized to obtain the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) plots.33
The stability of the electrodes was determined by a chronoamperometry technique using the Zahner electrochemical workstation. The light on–off measurements were also performed for 3 minutes duration to investigate the role of light in photocurrent generation. The charge carrier separation efficiency data was acquired by measuring the photocurrent in the presence of a hole scavenger (H2O2 in the present case).32 The evolved H2 and O2 gases were collected by the water displacement method and collected for 1 hour. The ratio of evolved H2 and O2 gases was found to be 2:1, elucidating that the Faradaic efficiency was close to unity. The method of gas collection was been taken from previously reported work by our group.29
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction analysis
The XRD analysis of the samples was performed to obtain information about the crystalline phase, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The peaks related to BiVO4 are marked ‘B’ and were obtained at 2θ = 28.79, 34.48, 35.19, 39.54, 45.85 degrees, corresponding to (013), (200), (020), (114) and (23) planes, respectively. The diffraction pattern matches well with JCPDS card no. 75-2480, confirming evolution of the monoclinic phase of BiVO4. The diffraction peaks for Fe2O3 match well with JCPDS card no. 24-0072 and are represented by ‘F’. The peaks are present at 2θ = 24.12, 33.11, 35.61, 39.22, 40.83, 49.41, 54.00, 57.50 degrees, corresponding to (012), (104), (110), (006), (113), (024), (116) and (122) planes, respectively, and thus confirm the formation of the rhombohedral hematite phase of Fe2O3. The peaks represented by ‘*’ correspond to peaks of the ITO substrate. The peak of metallic Au in the embedded configuration obtained at 38.19° corresponds to the fcc structure of metallic Au in the (111) plane and was confirmed by JCPDS card no. 04-0784. To further confirm the formation of metallic Au nanoparticles, a few drops of Au nanoparticles solution were deposited on a glass substrate and the X-ray diffraction patterns of both glass substrate and Au nanoparticles on the glass substrate were recorded. The average particle size of Au nanoparticles as estimated from the XRD data is about 8 nm using the Debye–Scherrer formula. The obtained XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 2(b).

3.2. SEM and EDX characterization
The FESEM images of the surface morphology of Au nanoparticles on the ITO substrate, BiVO4, Fe2O3 and Au nanoparticles embedded BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction system are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d). The cross sectional SEM image of the Au embedded heterojunction is shown in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(a) shows that Au nanoparticles deposited on ITO are of spherical nature with a size of around 10–15 nm. The measurement of particle size was performed using Image J software.34,35 The evolution of columnar type structures in BiVO4 samples can be seen in Fig. 3(b). The SEM image of the Au embedded heterojunction BiVO4/Fe2O3 (Fig. 3(c)) with Fe2O3 as the upper layer shows the uniform and dense deposition of Fe2O3 nanostructures. A similar kind of morphology has been reported previously by Verma et al.29 The surface morphology of the Au embedded heterojunction (B–F4) shows some brighter areas, which may be attributed to the embedded Au nanoparticles and has been marked in Fig. 3(d). The cross sectional SEM image shown in Fig. 3(e) indicates successful deposition of Fe2O3 thin film over the BiVO4. The thickness of the Fe2O3 layer is around 510 nm, while the thickness of BiVO4 is around 695 nm, as revealed from the cross sectional SEM image. The obtained thickness shows close agreement with the thickness measured from the surface profilometer. Elemental line profiling was performed to confirm the distribution of elements, viz. V and Fe, in the respective BiVO4 and Fe2O3 layers, as presented in Fig. 3(f). The other elements, like In and Si, are also shown for better understanding. The distribution of Au nanoparticles across two layers can also be seen from the EDX elemental map.

The EDX were recorded at a few selected places, as shown in Fig. 4, to further confirm the presence of elements in various samples. The EDX spectrum shown in Fig. 4(a) confirms the presence of metallic Au while the presence of other elements, like Bi, V, Fe, O, Au in various samples, are shown in Fig. 4(b)–(d). The atomic% of Au in the B–F1, B–F2, B–F3 and B–F4 samples obtained from the EDX map were 0.04%, 0.09%, 0.20% and 0.53%, respectively (provided in ESI,† Fig. S1).

3.3. UV-visible absorption analysis
The UV-visible spectrum of Au nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction methods is shown in Fig. 5(a). The SPR peak of the Au nanoparticles was observed at 520 nm. The absorbance spectra of pristine BiVO4 and Fe2O3 are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), which exhibit prominent absorbance in the visible region. The absorbances of the pristine heterojunction along with embedded Au heterojunction systems are shown in Fig. 5(d). It is clear from Fig. 5(d) that absorbance for the Au embedded heterojunction is higher than that of the heterojunction without Au nanoparticles. The increased absorption may be assigned to the SPR property possessed by Au nanoparticles, which increases the absorption in the heterojunction system.

3.4. Electrochemical studies

3.4.1. 
            I–V characterization. 
Current voltage (I–V) properties of all the systems viz. BiVO4, Fe2O3 and heterojunctions were evaluated under both dark and illumination conditions (visible light) from the scanning range of +1 V per SCE to −1 V per SCE. The photocurrent densities obtained for various systems are shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). The photocurrent density of pristine BiVO4 and Fe2O3 is a few μA cm−2 while in the case of pristine heterojunction (B–F), 0.41 mA cm−2 is obtained. The increase in photocurrent density is due to better separation of charge carriers thanks to the formation of the heterojunction. The improved PEC response in the case of heterojunction systems has been reported previously by various researchers.6–16

Fig. 6(d) indicates the improvement in photocurrent density after embedding Au nanoparticles. The maximum photoresponse of 2 mA cm−2 at 1 V per SCE or (1.24 V per RHE) was obtained in the case of the Au embedded B–F3 sample. Besides least resistance, the high value of the open circuit voltage in B–F3 sample also explains its enhanced photoresponse. It should be noted that a high value for the open circuit voltage suggests a low charge recombination rate.36 The values of the photocurrent density, open circuit voltage and resistance are given in Table 2.

3.4.2. Mott–Schottky analysis and Nyquist plot. 
A Mott–Schottky analysis was performed to get the flat band potential of various systems. The Mott–Schottky plots and Nyquist plots for the various samples are shown in Fig. 7(a)–(e). The slope of the plot of 1/C2vs. applied bias gives the value of the flat band potential. A more negative value for the flat band potential indicates a low recombination rate of charge carriers with better charge transport properties.37 A shift of 0.32 V was obtained from the pristine B–F (0.53 V per SCE) to the B–F3 (0.85 V per SCE) sample, indicating a better charge transport property at the electrode–electrolyte interface in the case of the B–F3 sample. The pristine heterojunction system shows better charge carrier separation in comparison to BiVO4 and Fe2O3 (Fig. 7(a)–(c)). The positive slope in all the samples suggests the n-type nature of the semiconductor with electrons as the majority charge carriers. The values of flat band potentials for different samples under study are given in Table 2.

A Nyquist plot gives information about the charge transfer resistance and a decrease in the radii of the semicircles reveals a decrease in charge transfer resistance.36 In Fig. 7(e), the semicircle radius is least in the B–F3 sample, exhibiting better charge transport properties with least charge transfer resistance.


3.4.3. Efficiency measurements. 
Under illumination conditions, the applied bias to current conversion efficiencies (ABPE) for all the systems were calculated using a 150 W xenon lamp at 1 V per SCE (1.24 V per RHE) with the help of eqn (1). A maximum efficiency of 1.44% was obtained in the case of the B–F3 sample. The high value of ABPE (shown in Fig. 8(a)) was attributed to the maximum negative value of the flat band potential, least resistance, high open circuit voltage and highest photocurrent density. Despite this, reduced charge transfer resistance was also obtained from the Nyquist plot.
 Fig. 8  (a) ABPE (b) IPCE and APCE and (c) carrier separation efficiency. 
The fraction of charge carriers generated per incident photon flux can be calculated from IPCE measurements. However, the IPCE measurement suffers from imperfect absorption and reflection of incident light. On the other hand, APCE is closer to the real conversion efficiency obtained from IPCE data corrected with respect to UV-visible absorption spectra.42 IPCE measurements of the best-performing B–F3 sample show an increment in the entire visible region as well as in the region where both semiconductors and Au nanoparticles show better absorption in comparison to pristine B–F, which suggests that plasmon resonant energy transfer (PRET) by Au nanoparticles is responsible for the enhanced IPCE (shown in Fig. 8(b)). Enhancement in IPCE beyond the region where both semiconductors and Au nanoparticles show absorption may be due to the hot electron transfer (HET) mechanism. APCE can be considered an important measurement to confirm the hot electron transfer mechanism in the investigated Au embedded heterojunction system. The drastic enhancement in APCE after embedding Au nanoparticles beyond 550 nm reasonably explains the role of HET.
The carrier separation efficiency of the pristine heterojunction system was compared for the B–F3 sample and the B–F4 sample. It can be assumed that the B–F4 sample with maximum absorption in visible light should give better a PEC response compared to B–F3. Therefore in order to explain the poor performance of the B–F4 sample, the carrier separation efficiency in the presence of H2O2 was measured, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The low carrier separation efficiency in the case of B–F4 can be ascribed to a high charge recombination rate, which may be the consequence of agglomeration of Au nanoparticles. The increased recombination rate with an increase in Au concentration and size has also been reported previously by Fang et al. and Naseri et al.39,40


3.4.4. Chronoamperometric measurement. 
The current was recorded under illumination condition for a duration of 4000 s at an applied potential of 1 V per SCE (1.24 V per RHE) to confirm the stability of the best-performing sample. The chronoamperometric measurement reveals that the current obtained under illumination of B–F3 is almost constant over time, indicating the absence of photocorrosion,14,37 as shown in Fig. 9(a). Light on–off measurements were also performed to check the stability of photocurrent as well as to see the effect of light on the photoanode (Fig. 9(b) and (c)). The evolved H2 and O2 gases were collected by the water displacement method over a graduated inverted tube for the duration of 1 hour. The ratio of evolved gases is close to 2:1 ratio, indicating a Faradaic efficiency close to unity (Fig. 9(d)).

3.4.5. Discussion on mechanism. 
The positions of the conduction and valence band edges of BiVO4 w.r.t NHE are +0.46 eV and +2.86 eV, respectively, while for Fe2O3 the conduction band edge is +0.37 eV and the valence band edge is +2.47 eV.1,38 The positions of the conduction band and valence band suggest that the arrangement is of a staggered type which allows the easy flow of charge carriers at the interface of the two semiconductors. The energy band diagram is presented in Fig. 10. Upon illumination, the electrons can move easily from the conduction band of Fe2O3 to the low-lying conduction band of BiVO4. The electrons will finally reach the Pt electrode to generate H2 through the ITO substrate. Likewise, the holes generated in BiVO4 can be easily transferred to the Fe2O3 layer, which will help in water oxidation. Thus there is hindrance-free movement of charge carriers at the semiconductor interface as well as at the semiconductor–electrolyte junction, which makes the heterojunction suitable for water splitting application.
 Fig. 10  Charge transfer mechanism in heterojunction system and plasmonic enhancement by PRET and HET in semiconductor layers. 
The PEC response in the heterojunction is further improved by the embedded Au nanoparticles. The possible ways in which Au nanoparticles promote the photoelectrochemical performance are discussed below:
(1) Plasmon Resonant Energy Transfer (PRET): it is well known that upon excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles, an intensified electromagnetic field is created around the nanoparticles which in turn increases the generation of charge carriers in the vicinal semiconductor, generally referred as plasmon resonant energy transfer (PRET). It is relatively more prominent with smaller size nanoparticles.17,26,27 For PRET, an overlap between the SPR spectrum possessed by the metal nanoparticles and the absorbance spectrum of the semiconductor is required and is directly related to the photocatalytic efficiency.27 Apart from this, PRET is also helpful in reducing the distance travelled by the holes (minority carriers in an n-type semiconductor) to reach the electrolyte to cause water oxidation by concentrating the electromagnetic field at the semiconductor electrolyte interface.17 In the present case, Au nanoparticles are of small size, as evident from the Debye–Scherrer calculation (∼8 nm) used for particle size estimation (Section 3.1) and the SEM image (∼10–15 nm) (Fig. 3(a)). In Au embedded heterojunctions, the presence of Au nanoparticles in both layers will increase the generation of charge carriers throughout the thickness of the semiconductor layers by the PRET mechanism, as there is a spectral overlap present between the Au SPR absorption peak which is at 520 nm and the region where both BiVO4 (absorption edge at 510 nm) and Fe2O3 (absorption edge at 595 nm) are showing prominent absorbance (as revealed from Fig. 5). The increase in IPCE throughout the visible range, including 400–600 nm, confirms the role of PRET in enhancing PEC. It has been reported by several authors that an increase in IPCE restricted to the absorbance range of the semiconductor and noble metal nanoparticles is attributable to the PRET effect.42–45 Apart from this, the APCE is also increasing in the region where both Au nanoparticles and the semiconductor absorb, which further confirms the role of PRET in promoting the generation of charge carriers in semiconductor layers.
(2) Hot Electron Transfer (HET): the photoreaction enhancement by hot electron transfer is a well-known mechanism by which a metal supplies electrons (being highly energetic under light excitation) to the conduction band of the semiconductor material. Hot electron transfer (HET) is prominent when there exists a direct contact between the metal and the semiconductor and it has been reported that the generation of hot electrons is efficient in Au nanoparticles of size <20 nm.19,26,27 The presence of Au nanoparticles in semiconductor layers also creates various metal semiconductor junctions with the presence of a Schottky barrier at the interface. On light excitation, hot electrons can easily cross the Schottky barrier and move to the conduction band. The particle size of Au is less than 20 nm in the present case, suggesting efficient generation of hot electrons. By the hot electron transfer (HET) mechanism, electrons will start to accumulate in the semiconductor conduction band and thus trigger the facile movement of photogenerated charge carriers to finally reach the respective electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.42–45 The confirmation of the HET mechanism can be evidenced by the increase in IPCE beyond the wavelength corresponding to the semiconductor band gap energy. Also the dramatic increase in APCE beyond 590 nm in the present case indubitably confirms the role of hot electron injection in enhancing the PEC performance.
(3) Optical enhancement: the increase in absorbance by the semiconductor material due to the presence of SPR possessed by plasmonic nanoparticles is a well-known phenomenon. Naseri et al. observed improved photoresponse in an Au/TiO2 nanocomposite by the improved absorbance due to the presence of Au.40 Zhan et al. also reported improved photocatalytic efficiency due to embedded Au nanoparticles in a TiO2 matrix.41 The presence of embedded Au nanoparticles in the present case resulted in greater absorption by the photoanode. The increase in absorbance can be affirmed from Fig. 5(d), but in the case of the B–F4 sample with the maximum concentration of Au nanoparticles, low photoresponse was observed even with maximum visible light absorption, which may be attributed to the agglomeration of Au nanoparticles which acts as a recombination centre (as revealed from the inset of Fig. 4(d)). The low charge carrier separation efficiency in the case of the B–F4 sample, as revealed from Fig. 8, (c) indicates fast recombination in B–F4.
(4) Photon scattering: optimum scattering of light for its effective harvesting by metal nanoparticles is prominent when the particle size of the nanoparticles is around 100 nm.17,26 In the present study, as gold nanoparticles are of very small size, multiple scattering of light by Au nanoparticles will not promote the absorbance. The increase in APCE beyond the range where semiconductor and Au NPs absorbs suggests that scattering is not playing any role in PEC enhancements, as also reported by Valenti et al.42
Based on effects related to plasmonic enhancement, in the present study, the improved absorption is attributed to the SPR effects of Au nanoparticles. In addition to the SPR effects, PRET and HET also play a significant role leading to improved photoelectrochemical performance by enhancing the rate of charge transfer. Improved IPCE and APCE values provide a confirmation of the dominant effect of PRET and HET in the B–F3 sample and the other two factors, viz. optical enhancement and scattering, were not found to contribute significantly towards enhanced PEC performance.

4. Conclusions
Embedding Au nanoparticles to enhance the performance of a heterojunction system has been elucidated for the first time. The increased efficiency of an Au embedded heterojunction system has been attributed to the higher visible light absorption due to the SPR effect which further helps in the generation of electron–hole pairs by the PRET mechanism. The APCE measurement, which is not restricted to the absorbance regions of metal NPs and the semiconductor, confirmed the role of hot electron transfer in Au embedded heterojunctions. A more negative flat band potential value, a decrease in resistance, a high open circuit voltage and improved ABPE and IPCE show that ITO/BiVO4/Fe2O3 with embedded Au nanoparticles (B–F3) is the most efficient system. The stability of B–F3 studied through current vs. time measurement proves that the system is resistant to photocorrosion.
