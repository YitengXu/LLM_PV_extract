    , Accepted 27th January 2023First published on 28th January 2023AbstractThe use of a superlattice structure is an effective strategy to develop novel perovskites and obtain excellent light-absorbing materials. Based on first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the properties of intrinsic point defects at the interface of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice. Our calculations show that charged defects are easier to form as compared to neutral ones at the superlattice interface due to low formation energies. Most defects with low formation energies have a shallow level in the band gap, and some deep level defects have high formation energies, so the superlattice perovskite exhibits high defect tolerance. PbI3+ is a dominant and detrimental defect, which acts as a non-radiative recombination center because it has low formation energy and a deep transition level. To avoid the generation of PbI3+ defects, it is suggested to synthesize FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices under I-rich conditions. The calculated light absorption coefficients and photovoltaic performance parameters demonstrate that the presence of defects leads to a certain degree of reduction in light absorption and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells made of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices, but the excellent performance of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) is basically retained. The superlattice perovskites are still promising candidates for light-absorbing materials of PSCs. This study is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the properties of defects at the superlattice interface and provide theoretical support for the design of high performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have received extensive attention due to their suitable band gap, excellent carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, and low production cost.1–5 In just a dozen years, the PCE of PSCs has been improved from 3.8% reported by Kojima et al.6 in 2009 to a certified 25.7% PCE in 2022.7 Despite the rapid progress in the performance of PSCs, organic–inorganic halide perovskites were observed to decompose easily under light and humid environments, leading to the degradation of the light-absorbing layer, which is still a challenge for their industrial application.8–11 The CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite is the most widely used light-absorbing material in PSCs.12–14 Recently, NH2CHNH2PbI3 (FAPbI3) has also received a lot of attention due to its narrow band gap and higher thermal stability.15 One promising alternative is to replace MA+ with the larger organic cation FA+ (FA = NH2CHNH2). Jalili et al.15 showed that the FA ions improved the electrical properties of the material, and FAPbI3-based PSCs displayed a better thermal stability than MAPbI3-based PSCs. It has been found that mixing organic cations such as MA+ and FA+ can improve the stability of solar cell devices. More importantly, the ion mixing can fine-tune the material's band gap, which directly affects the performance of a series of solar cells.16 Pang et al.17 proposed that the MAPbI3/δ-FAPbI3 structure can enhance the performance and stability of MAPbI3 PSCs, in which the δ-FAPbI3 phase plays the role of passivating the trap state, tunneling the contact between the perovskite and carrier transport layer, and limiting the diffusion of organic cations. Multiple cation mixing is a useful method to improve the stability of solar cell devices.18,19 The solar cell efficiency table shows that the PCE of the FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite-based cell reaches 23.7%.20
Experimental and theoretical investigations have proved that interface engineering is an effective strategy to achieve surface passivation, thereby improving the stability and efficiency of PSCs.21–27 Heterojunctions consisting of two kinds of perovskite layers can provide a new paradigm for device engineering. Holmes et al.21 synthesized seven APbX3/MASnX3 (A = Cs, MA, or FA; X = Br or I) heterojunctions using a combination of sequential solution and steam processing, and they found that two promising superlattice structures, MAPbBr3/MASnBr3 and CsPbBr3/MASnBr3, are stable for more than 1500 hours. Xu et al.22 proposed a scheme for constructing heterojunctions by adding the CsPbI3 film as a surface protection layer on the top of the MAPbI3 perovskite, and they found that the structural stability of the perovskite was enhanced by strengthening the bonding between layers and preventing the penetration of water molecules into the interior. A single-crystal perovskite has a lower density of defects, better transport ability of photogenerated carriers and material stability. So et al.23 developed a process for the growth of MAPbI3 epitaxial layers on the MAPbBr3 single crystal by ion exchange. The newly grown MAPbI3 layer in the heterostructure exhibits the characteristics of a single crystal, and the high carrier mobility in MAPbI3 surface is comparable to that of the original MAPbBr3 single-crystal material. Xu et al.24 reported a low dimensional metal halide perovskite BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 superlattice fabricated by chemical beam epitaxy, showing a long carrier lifetime and a stable 12.36% PCE. Theoretical calculations also revealed that an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite superlattice has more carriers and lower effective masses of electrons and holes, indicating that superlattice structures have many potential advantages in designing solar devices.25,26 In previous work, we have studied the structures and photoelectric properties of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices by DFT calculations, showing that they are thermodynamically stable and exhibit good optical absorption performance.27
Structural defects ranging from point defects to grain boundaries play a critical role in the performance of PSCs, especially the electron–hole diffusion lengths and recombination rates.28 Some defects that create a deep level usually form nonradiative recombination centers and reduce carrier lifetime.29,30 The instability of the PSC device is also related to the charge trapping of defect states.31–33 Fully understanding the formation mechanism and chemical and physical properties of defects in perovskite materials is significant for reducing losses in non-radiative recombination and carrier transportation, and improving the performance and efficiency of PSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of intrinsic point defects in the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice. Considering that there have been many studies on the intrinsic defects of bulk MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites in recent years32,34 and the importance of the perovskite–perovskite interface, in this work, we performed first-principles calculations on a series of intrinsic point defects at the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice interface. Our results show that most of the interface defects show shallow-level characteristics. MAPb−, VPb2−, MAi+, FAi+, FAI2+ and PbI3+ defects are easy to form at the superlattice interface, and the PbI3+ defect generates a deep energy level in the band gap. The interface defects lead to a blue shift of light absorption and reduction of PCE to some extent. The growth condition should be carefully controlled to avoid the formation of such defects in the synthesis process of superlattice perovskites.
2. Computational details
In order to explore the effects of defects on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of the superlattice perovskites, we constructed a 1 × 2 × 2 supercell using the optimized (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 cell. The first-principles calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),35 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (PBE) with a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for the exchange–correlation functional.36,37 Electron–ion interactions were described using projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.38 Valence electron configurations of atoms are H 1s1, C 2s2 2p2, N 2s2 2p3, Pb 5d10 6s2 6p2, and I 5s2 5p5. van der Waals (vdW) interaction was treated using the optB88-vdw correlation functional.39–41 A 1 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh was adopted to sample the first Brillouin zone. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. All atoms were relaxed until the total force on each atom is less than 0.04 eV Å−1 and the total energy change is less than 1 × 10−5 eV.
Band gaps calculated using the GGA-PBE exchange–correlation functional are often underestimated.42,43 However, in some cases, PBE provides a band gap very similar to the experimental value due to the error cancelation, that is, the underestimated band gap error using PBE cancels out the overestimated band gap error ignoring SOC.44 The HSE06 functional approach incorporating SOC is also used to correct band gap underestimation.45 In this work, we calculated the band gaps of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 using PBE, PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC functionals, as presented in Table S1 of the ESI.† Compared with the PBE + SOC functional, the bandgaps of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 calculated using HSE06 + SOC are only 0.1 eV lower than those gained using PBE. The PBE functional can make a reasonable estimate of the bandgaps, which are in good agreement with experimental observations.46,47 Therefore, considering the computing resources, PBE is employed in our calculations as in other previous investigations for interface systems.48
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures of superlattices
To investigate the properties of intrinsic defects at the superlattice interface, we constructed a (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattice, as shown in Fig. 1c, which consists of two layers of cubic phase MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites each. The structural parameters of relaxed superlattices are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The cell parameters of the (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattice are a = 25.596 Å, b = 6.319 Å, and c = 6.388 Å. Compared with primitive MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, the lattice parameters of the superlattice do not change much in b and c directions, whereas the average thickness of the MAPbI3 monolayer, dMAPbI3, stretches, but dFAPbI3 shows a certain compression along the a direction, which is caused by the lattice mismatch of the two types of perovskite layers and the existence of an interfacial effect.49 The extension and compression trends of dMAPbI3 and dFAPbI3 in the a-axis of the superlattices with different thicknesses are consistent with those of the previous work.27 The binding energy and formation enthalpy of the superlattice are computed according to eqn (1) and (2): Eb = E[(FAPbI3)/(MAPbI3)] − 2E(FAPbI3) − 2E(MAPbI3)(1) ΔHf = E[(FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2] − 2E(FAI) − 2E(MAI) − 4E(PbI2)(2)where E(MAPbI3), E(FAPbI3) and E[(FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2] are the total energies of MAPbI3, FAPbI3 perovskites, and (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattices, respectively. E(MAI) and E(FAI) are the total energies of MAI and FAI. The calculated binding energy Eb is −0.188 eV and ΔHf is −0.429 eV, which indicate that the (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattice is thermodynamically stable. To gain a large enough interface area, we constructed a 1 × 2 × 2 supercell (FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice for short hereafter) based on the (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattice, as shown in Fig. 1d. The area enclosed by the red rectangle represents the interface to be investigated. Various intrinsic defects at the interface of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice were studied, including vacancies (VMA, VFA, VPb, and VI), interstitials (Ii, MAi, FAi, and Pbi), cation substitutions (MAPb, FAPb, PbMA, and PbFA), and antisites (IMA, IFA, IPb, MAI, FAI, and PbI), and different charge states of defects were also considered.

3.2 Defect formation energies
The point defect can be in the neutral or charged state. The formation energy of point defect α with charge q can be described as follows:50,51 ΔHf(α, q) = Etot(α, q) − Etot(host) − Σni(μi + Ei) + q(EF + EVBM)(3)where Etot (α, q) and Etot (host) are the total energies of defective and perfect superlattices, respectively. ni represents the number of element i added to (ni > 0) or removed from (ni < 0) the superlattice, and μi is the chemical potential of the corresponding element i referenced to the elemental solid with energy Ei. EF is the Fermi level referenced to the valence band maximum (VBM).
To calculate the defect formation energy at the superlattice interface, it is necessary to determine the chemical potential range of thermal equilibrium growth of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites. In order to avoid the spontaneous precipitation of each component, the chemical potential of each element should be satisfied as μMA < 0, μFA < 0, μPb < 0 and μI < 0. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the conditions for the formation of stable MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are that the chemical potentials of MA, FA, Pb and I should meet the following equalities:32,50,52 μMA + μPb + 3μI = ΔH(MAPbI3) = −5.111 eV(4) μFA + μPb + 3μI = ΔH(FAPbI3) = −4.758 eV(5)Here, ΔH(MAPbI3) and ΔH(FAPbI3) are the formation enthalpies of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 in the cubic phase, respectively. The cubic phase of Pb solid, orthorhombic phase of I2 solid, and the body-centered-cubic phase of organic MA and FA were chosen for the calculation of chemical potentials. In addition, to exclude the formations of possible secondary phases including MAI (cubic phase), FAI (cubic phase), and PbI2 (trigonal phase), the following constraints should also be satisfied: μMA + μI < ΔH(MAI) = −3.004 eV(6) μPb + 2μI < ΔH(PbI2) = −2.054 eV(7) μFA + μI < ΔH(FAI) = −2.636 eV(8)Based on the thermodynamic constraints of eqn (4)–(8), the chemical potential regions for the equilibrium growth conditions of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are shown in Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), marked as red-colored long and narrow regions. The chemical potential ranges for the growth of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 crystals are very narrow, corresponding to the low dissociation energies of 0.0522 eV for MAPbI3 to MAI and PbI2 and 0.0678 eV for FAPbI3 to FAI and PbI2, respectively. These are consistent with the previous report for MAPbI3 (0.11 eV)51 and FAPbI3 (0.07 eV).32 MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 crystals are not easy to grow in the solution synthesis process, so the concentrations of Pb and I components need to be flexibly controlled. Carefully inspecting Fig. S1 (ESI†), the stabilization region of chemical potentials of FAPbI3 is slightly wider than that of MAPbI3, so we selected three points in the potential region of MAPbI3 as representative chemical potentials so that all the constraint conditions mentioned above can be satisfied, which resembles the method for calculating chemical potentials of MAPbI3/CsPbI3 superlattices by Yu et al.51 The selected three points A, B, and C represent I-rich/Pb-poor, moderate, and I-poor/Pb-rich synthesis conditions, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The chemical potential of FA is calculated according to eqn (5), in which the chemical potential values of Pb and I meet the three representative points in MAPbI3. Thus, the chemical potentials of the three synthesis conditions of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice are A (μI = 0 eV, μPb = −2.107 eV, μMA = −3.004 eV, and μFA = −2.651 eV), B (μI = −0.527 eV, μPb = −1.027 eV, μMA = −2.503 eV, and μFA = −2.150 eV) and C (μI = −1.053 eV, μPb = 0 eV, μMA = −1.952 eV, and μFA = −1.599 eV).
In the computations of defect formation energies, the VBM level (EVBM) of the superlattice interface was corrected using the electrostatic potential alignment method.53,54 The VBM levels of pure FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 bulk calculated using 2 × 2 × 2 supercell models (see Fig. S2, ESI†) are EFAPIVBM = 1.293 eV and EMAPIVBM = 1.090 eV, respectively. The plane average electrostatic potentials are shown in Fig. 2 for pure FAPbI3, MAPbI3 supercells and FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices. It can be seen from Fig. 2a and b, the differences between the VBM and the lowest energy at the bottom of electrostatic potential in FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 can be calculated as ΔVFAPI = EFAPIVBM − EFAPIbot = 13.167 eV and ΔVMAPI = EMAPIVBM − EMAPIbot = 12.569 eV. For the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice (Fig. 2c), the lowest electrostatic potentials of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 parts are −11.817 eV and −11.357 eV, so the corresponding EVBM should be 1.350 and 1.212 eV, respectively. These values were used to calculate formation energies of defects near the superlattice interface, such as VFA, VMA, and PbMA, etc. Finally, the average value of EVBM of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 in the superlattice, 1.281 eV, is adopted as the EVBM of the interface to calculate the formation energies of defects located at the interface, such as VPb, VI, and Pbietc.

Based on the total energy, Fermi level, VBM level, and chemical potential of each component of the superlattice, the formation energies of neutral defects at the interface under three growth conditions are calculated and listed in Table 1. In semiconductor materials, cation vacancy and anion interstitial are acceptors, and cation interstitial and anion vacancy are donors. An antisite can be regarded as a defect pair of vacancy and interstitial to determine whether it is a donor or an acceptor. Under I-rich conditions, acceptor defects FAPb, IMA, MAPb, and VMA have negative formation energies, and FAPb has the lowest formation energy of −0.199 eV. In addition, defects VPb and IFA also have formation energies almost close to zero. Compared with the I-rich condition, the formation energies of acceptor defects increase, while the formation energies of donor defects decrease under Pb-rich conditions, and the donor defects become the main defects. Under Pb-rich conditions, defects MAi, FAi, PbMA and VI have relatively small formation energies. Under moderate growth conditions, the formation energies of various defects are between those under I-rich and Pb-rich conditions, and the formations of most intrinsic defects are inhibited. Our calculated defect formation energies are consistent with some results of previous reports. For example, first-principles calculations conducted by Liu et al.32 predicted that neutral VFA in the FAPbI3 perovskite has the lowest formation energy under I-rich conditions, and the MAPb defect in the MAPbI3 perovskite has the second-lowest formation energy.34 Compared with their calculated results, the formation energies of most neutral defects at the superlattice interface are smaller than those in the bulk phase of pure MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. The intrinsic defects are relatively easy to form near the superlattice interfaces, due to that the lattice distortion at the heterogeneous interface induces mismatch and various defects in perovskite–perovskite heterojunctions.55,56

Intrinsic defects in perovskite crystalline materials tend to exist in different charge states, and some charged defects are more likely to generate compared to neutral defects. The calculated formation energies as a function of Fermi level for charged defects are presented in Fig. 3. It can be observed that many charged defects indeed have more negative formation energies compared with the neutral defects, implying that charged defects are easy to form compared to the neutral ones at the superlattice interfaces. Under I-rich conditions (Fig. 3a), the cross point of acceptor defect FAi+ and donor defect VPb2− pins the Fermi level EF (gray dashed line) which is near the VBM, indicating that the superlattice belongs to p-type semiconductors. Under Pb-rich conditions (Fig. 3c), the Fermi level is close to the conduction band minimum (CBM), implying that the superlattice has a characteristic of n-type semiconductor. Under moderate conditions (Fig. 3b), the Fermi level is located between the VBM and CBM. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 3 that the conductivity of the superlattice composed of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites can be regulated from p-type to n-type semiconductors by controlling the synthesis condition.
 Fig. 3  Formation energies of charged defects at the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 interface under (a) I-rich, (b) moderate, and (c) Pb-rich conditions (some defects with high formation energies are plotted as dashed lines). 
Under I-rich conditions, VPb2−, FAi+ and FAI2+ defects with very low formation energies are the dominant defects. In addition, the MA cation-related defects MAi+, MAPb− also have low formation energies due to the weak interaction between organic cations and PbI6 octahedra in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. The lower formation energy of the VPb2− defect is related to the anti-bonding coupling of s–p orbitals.34 On the other hand, under Pb-rich conditions, the PbI3+ defect with a lower formation energy is the most stable defect in a hole-rich environment (EF < 0.4 eV). Under more electron-rich conditions (EF > 0.4 eV), defects VPb2−, FAi+, FAI2+ become the main defects. In the MAPbI3 perovskite, MAi+ and VPb2− defects have low formation energies under I-rich conditions, while the formation energies of VFA+, VPb2− and FAI2+ in FAPbI3 are very small.32,34 The dominant defects in the superlattice are related to but not identical to the prime defects in the respective perovskites. Defects MAPb−, VPb2−, MAi+, FAi+, FAI2+ and PbI3+ are dominant at the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice interface.
3.3 Transition levels of defects
In semiconductors, deep-level defects can form Shockley–Read–Hall non-radiative recombination centers and accelerate the recombination of carriers, thereby shortening the lifetime of carriers, while shallow-level defects can generally provide more carriers. Defect charge transition level is defined as the Fermi level where the defect transition is from one stable charged state to another. The transition level εα(q/q′) of defect α from charge state q to q' can be calculated by:57 εα(q/q′) = [E(α,q) − E(α,q′) + (q − q′)EVBM]/(q′ − q)(9)

Fig. 4 shows the transition levels of intrinsic defects at the superlattice interface. Here we define the deep-level defect as its transition level is 0.2 eV higher than the VBM or lower than the CBM.58 It is seen that dominant defects MAPb−, VPb2−, MAi+, FAi+, and FAI2+ with low formation energies show shallow transition levels, which are conducive to the transport of carriers. There are five deep-level defects at the superlattice interface, including VFA−, IMA2−, PbMA+, VI+ and PbI3+. Among them, VFA−, IMA2−, VI+, and PbMA+ defects have comparatively high formation energies, meaning that they are not easy to form or their concentrations are low at the superlattice interface, and thus these defects are less likely to form effective recombination centers. While the PbI3+ defect has very low defect formation energy under Pb-rich conditions and a deep transition level (PbI2+/PbI3+), indicating that it may act as a non-radiative recombination center. In order to avoid the formation of such defects, the content ratio of Pb and I should be properly controlled in the synthesis process. Since the PbI3+ defect is easily formed under Pb-rich conditions, it is recommended to synthesize superlattices under I-rich conditions.
 Fig. 4  Transition levels of defects at the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 interface. 
In the study of the intrinsic defects in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 bulk, Liu et al.32,34 predicted that defects with low formation energy generally do not generate deep transition levels. Our calculation results show that most of the defects at the superlattice interface are shallow-level defects. Some deep-level defects have low concentration due to their relatively high formation energy. Some defects such as Pbi2+, IPb2−, and IFA2− show deep transition levels in pure perovskites,32,34 but they become shallow-level defects in the superlattice interface, which is beneficial to reduce the recombination of carriers. Therefore, the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice can be used as an ideal optical absorption material of PSCs.
3.4 Electronic properties of superlattices with defects
In order to explore the effects of charged defects on the optoelectronic properties of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices, three shallow-level defects, VPb2−, FAi+, FAI2+, and two deep-level defects, PbI3+ and PbMA+, were selected as representatives. The optimized local structures of superlattices with these defects are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Compared with the perfect superlattice, the structures distorted because of the presence of defects, and the organic cationic groups FA+ and MA+ were twisted to different degrees. For PbI3+ and PbMA+ defects (Fig. S3e and f, ESI†), inserted Pbi forms Pb–I bonds with five adjacent I atoms.
The band structure, total density of states (TDOS) and band edge charge density distribution of the superlattice with these defects are analyzed. The band structures and TDOS plotted in Fig. 5 reveal that the VBM and CBM are both located at the Γ point for superlattices with and without defects, belonging to direct band gap semiconductors. The presence of defects usually creates defect states in the band gap of semiconductors. It can be found from Fig. 5 that defect states marked with red lines are introduced for the defective superlattice interface. The defect states emerge at the top of the valence band for the superlattice containing VPb2− (Fig. 5b), whereas the defect states appear near the bottom of the conduction band for the superlattices with FAi+, FAI2+, PbI3+ and PbMA+ defects (Fig. 5c–f). What needs to be emphasized is that the defect states of VPb2−, FAi+, FAI2+, and PbMA+ are all positioned near the edges of the valence band or conduction band i.e., there are no defect states in the midgap, but only the defect states of PbI3+ are present in the midgap close to the CBM. This is in accord with the analysis of the defect transition level. The introduction of defects causes the distortion of the local structure of the superlattice, which will affect the width of the band gap. Compared with the perfect superlattice, the band gaps of superlattices containing defects are enlarged. Among the studied five defects, the superlattice containing FAi+ has the largest band gap of 1.859 eV, and the smallest band gap of 1.751 eV is present in the superlattice with the PbMA+ defect.
 Fig. 5  Band structures and TDOS of the superlattice interface with (a) defect free, (b) VPb2−, (c) FAi+, (d) FAI2+, (e) PbI3+, (f) PbMA+. The red solid lines denote defect states. 
For the purpose of probing the bonding nature in the defective FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice, we examine the total and partial density of states (TDOS and PDOS) for the defective superlattices, as plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). For the perfect FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice (Fig. S4a, ESI†), the VBM is mainly contributed by I 5p state and a small amount of Pb 6s state, and the CBM is mainly formed by Pb 6p state. MA+ and FA+ cations do not contribute significantly to the band edges. For the VPb2− defect (Fig. S4b, ESI†), the defect state at the VBM is mainly due to the anti-bonding coupling of Pb 6s and I 5p around the VPb vacancy. This anti-bonding coupling does not gain electron energy,34 and is thus prone to bond breakage and forms VPb, resulting in the low formation energy. The defect states at the CBM of defects FAi+, FAI2+ and PbMA+ are mainly composed of Pb 6p state, as shown in Fig. S4c, d and f (ESI†). In the presence of the PbI3+ defect (Fig. S4e, ESI†), two defect states at 1.4 eV and 1.7 eV are also mainly contributed from Pb 6p states.
To better understand the defect induced changes of electronic structures, we calculated the decomposed charge density distributions for the VBM and CBM of the superlattice with and without defects, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The band edge charge densities (VBM and CBM) of the perfect FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice are mainly distributed on the FAPbI3 part, due to the narrower bandgap of FAPbI3 compared to MAPbI3. It is clear that the VBM is composed of I 5p and Pb 6s states and the CBM is contributed from Pb 6p states. This is in accordance with the DOS analysis. The point to emphasize here is that the charge densities of both VBM and CBM are distributed on the FAPbI3 layer, which is adverse to the separation of charge carriers. Interface defects cause the charge redistribution in the superlattices. Acceptor defects induce changes in the charge density of the VBM and donor defects mainly cause the charge density redistribution of the CBM. Two distinct features can be seen from Fig. S5 (ESI†). First, in the superlattice with defects, the charge densities are mainly localized near the defect. Second, unlike the perfect superlattice, the charge densities of the VBM and CBM are distributed on layers of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3, respectively, in the defective superlattice, which is conducive to the separation of electrons and holes.
Transportation of charge carriers is a decisive factor for the performance of PSCs. The presence of defects at the superlattice interface leads to a change in the electronic structure. Thus, the defect will impact the generation, separation and diffusion of electrons and holes. The effective mass (m*) and reduced effective mass (mr*) of electrons and holes and exciton binding energy (Eeb) of the superlattice interface containing the five defects mentioned above are computed according to eqn (S1)–(S4) given in the ESI.† The calculated results are listed in Table 2. In MAPbI3, the effective masses of electrons and holes, 0.388 and 0.285 m0, in this work are comparable with 0.35 and 0.31 m0 calculated by Yin et al.59 Moreover, the calculated exciton binding energy of MAPbI3 is 65.2 meV, which is consistent with the experimental result (68.3 ± 4.7 meV).60 Compared with MAPbI3, the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice has smaller effective masses of electrons and holes, 0.185 and 0.182 m0, respectively, and the exciton binding energy is as small as 35.3 meV, indicating that the superlattice possesses high carrier mobility and low exciton binding energy, and can thus be used as a good light harvesting material of solar cells. It can be seen from Table 2 that when there are interface defects VPb2−, FAi+, FAI2+, PbI3+ and PbMA+, the effective masses of electrons, holes, and reduced masses increase, resulting in a larger exciton binding energy. The acceptor defect VPb2− exhibits a large hole effective mass of 0.553 m0, and its exciton binding energy reaches 76.0 meV, while donor defect FAI2+ has the largest electron effective mass of 0.402 m0, and its exciton binding energy is 61.6 meV. The high exciton binding energy means that electrons and holes are difficult to separate, which is detrimental to the transport of electrons and holes and ultimately to the performance of solar cell devices.

3.5 Spectral properties of the superlattice with defects
Absorption spectra of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice with and without defects were computed according to eqn (S5)–(S8) (ESI†). Fig. 6 shows that perfect FAPbI3/MAPbI3 exhibits the maximum light absorption coefficient at about 390 nm. For the superlattice interfaces containing defects, the light absorption coefficients decrease in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm, and the absorption spectra show a tendency of blue-shift. Among the five defects, the maximum absorption coefficients of superlattices with VPb2− and PbI3+ defects decrease markedly. However, in the wavelength range less than 600 nm, the light absorption coefficients of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices with defects are still larger than 0.01 nm−1, meaning that the incident light absorption rate of the superlattice with a thickness of 300 nm will reach more than 90%.25 Because the presence of defects reduces the light absorption ability of the superlattice, the light absorption advantages of the perovskites are still basically maintained. Of course, in order to improve the light absorption efficiency, interface defects should be avoided as much as possible during the preparation of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice perovskites.
 Fig. 6  Absorption spectra of the superlattice with and without defects. 
Open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and PCE of the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices containing interface defects were evaluated using eqn (S9)–(S12) (ESI†) and listed in Table 3. With the increase of the band gap, open-circuit voltage Voc increases, short-circuit current density Jsc decreases, and the PCE is determined by the product of Voc and Jsc. The PCE of the perfect superlattice is higher than that of the superlattice with interface defects. When we take Eloss = 0.5 eV,61 the PCE of the perfect FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice reaches as high as 21.42%. The PCEs of superlattices with VPb2−, FAi+, FAI2+, PbI3+, PbMA+ defects range from 18.17% to 19.46%, which are close to the value of 19.98% for pure MAPbI3 perovskites. This shows that the interface defects slightly decrease the efficiency of solar cells made of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice perovskites, compared with the pure MAPbI3, but the excellent performance of PSCs is basically retained.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the properties of intrinsic defects at the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice interface by first-principles calculations. The binding energy shows that the (FAPbI3)2/(MAPbI3)2 superlattice is thermodynamically stable. In general, many charged defects have lower formation energies than neutral ones, implying that charged defects are prone to generate at the superlattice interfaces. The FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice shows high defect tolerance, like its components of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. A majority of defects with low formation energies exhibit shallow transition levels, and the defects possessing deep transition levels have high formation energies. The exceptional one is the PbI3+ defect that has low formation energy and deep transition level. Because the PbI3+ defect is easy to form under Pb-rich conditions, it is suggested to synthesize the FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattice under I-rich conditions. The calculated light absorption coefficients and photovoltaic performance parameters demonstrate that the existence of defects causes a certain degree of reduction in light absorption and PCE of solar cells made of FAPbI3/MAPbI3 superlattices, but the excellent performance of PSCs is basically retained. The superlattice perovskites are still promising candidates for light absorption materials of PSCs.
