    , Accepted 9th October 2020First published on 10th October 2020AbstractAs perovskite solar cells are highly efficient and already meet the efficiency requirement for renewable power generation, more attention is given to technological barriers such as scalability and stability. In particular, the large efficiency losses associated with upscaling lab-scale devices to large-area modules represents one of the major hurdles for commercialization. Given the essential role of the perovskite films in the device performance, it is of critical importance to develop reliable crystallization protocols to deposit high-quality perovskite layers via scalable methods. This review summarizes recent advances in emerging crystallization protocols for the large-scale deposition of perovskite thin films. The unique merits of the well-developed crystallization strategies, including antisolvent, gas quenching, vacuum quenching, etc., are carefully analyzed and discussed. We highlight that, independent of the coating method, creating intermediate phases to decouple the otherwise overlapped solution coating and crystal growth is essential to realize homogeneous coatings of perovskite thin films. Strategies for enhancing the crystal morphology of perovskite films are presented as well, which is vitally important to realize reproducible manufacturing of large-area modules. This tutorial review assists the screening and development of robust crystallization strategies for scalable deposition of high-quality perovskite films for photovoltaic applications.

1. Introduction
Solution-processable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) combine the unique features of tunable bandgaps,1 high absorption coefficients,2 and long carrier diffusion lengths,3 which are crucial merits for their rapid rise to the forefront of thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Since the demonstration of the first solar device in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rocketed from 3.8% to an impressive level of over 25% within just a decade,4–6 and has already surpassed the record efficiencies of commercially available PV technologies such as mainstream multi-crystalline silicon and conventional inorganic thin-film solar cells.7,8 The fast increase in cell performance stems mainly from a combined effort in controlling the perovskite composition,9 advanced processing,6 interface engineering,10–12 and defect passivation.13–15 Encouragingly, the operational stability of PSCs is also noticeably increasing as one-year stable solar devices tested under one-sun illumination and at elevated operating temperatures have been reported.16 This rapid progress in fabrication of high efficiency and long-term stable devices envisages a bright prospect for the commercialization of perovskite PV technology.
Another intriguing advantage of PSCs is that the perovskite absorber layers consist of inexpensive raw materials that can be easily synthesized and are soluble in common organic solvents, including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL). Accordingly, thin films of perovskites can be readily deposited from solution by various coating techniques such as spin-coating,6 doctor blading,17 slot-die coating,18 spray coating,19 inkjet printing20etc. Most of these fabrication techniques are compatible with industrial roll-to-roll manufacturing processes, allowing one to upscale perovskite PV technology via printing methods.21 Furthermore, a relatively low annealing temperature typically between 100 and 150 °C is sufficient for nucleation and crystal growth, rendering perovskite deposition compatible with flexible polymer substrates.
It is widely acknowledged that the crystal morphology of perovskite layers plays an essential role in determining the solar cell performance.6,22 Obtaining a uniform, dense and pinhole-free perovskite layer with minimal structural defects is a prerequisite to deliver high device performance. At present, the spin-coating method is predominately used in laboratories to deposit small-area PSCs, leading to continually updated efficiency records.6,23 Unfortunately, the biggest bottleneck of spin-coating is that it is a nonscalable process, which is generally limited to 5 × 5 cm2 and probably can be expanded to silicon wafer size level. Moreover, the established cystallization protocol for spin-coating can not be transferred to other scalable coating lines. It is therefore imperative that scalable coating methods can be used to deposit high-quality perovskite films over large areas and in a high-throughput manner. However, the paramount challenge to realize high-quality perovskite films via printing methods is that the two critical steps, nucleation and crystal growth, usually take place within seconds and overlap each other, making perovskite crystallization intractable.24 In this context, controlling the crystallization kinetics during perovskite formation is highly demanding for large-scale manufacturing of perovskite thin films.
In this review, we provide an overview of the emerging crystallization technologies that have been proposed for the scalable preparation of perovskite thin films. In contrast to the previous review papers which mainly focus on the implementation of different coating methods,25–28 we summarize the recent achievements in scalable coating of perovskites by classifying the key crystallization technologies. Several crystallization protocols including hot-casting, solvent extraction, vacuum extraction, gas quenching, etc. are carefully discussed to distinguish their viability for scalable coating of high-quality perovskite films by a specific processing method. Particular attention is paid to the scientific challenges of growing dense and uniform perovskite thin films. Additionally, strategies based on post-treatment for improving the morphology of already formed perovskites are presented. Finally, we provide an outlook on the efficiency deficit associated with upscaling, as well as the key considerations of the stability and toxicity of PSCs.
2. Nucleation and crystal growth of polycrystalline perovskites
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs depends largely on the crystal morphology of the perovskite absorber layer. In particular, up-scaling PSCs requires coating perovskite thin films uniformly over large areas without pinholes. However, it is often encountered that without delicately controlling the crystallization process, the obtained perovskite films exhibit incomplete surface coverage due to the tendency of preferential growth toward a dendritic structure,29,30 which is detrimental for device performance due to leakage paths. Given the crucial importance of the crystallization dynamics in determining the morphology of the final perovskite layer, we start with a comprehensive analysis of the nucleation and crystal growth mechanism of perovskite thin film formation.
The preparation of perovskite polycrystalline films from precursor solutions involves two important processes, the nucleation followed by the growth of the crystals. It is well accepted that the final crystal morphology of the perovskite film depends strongly on the rates of the two processes, which are closely related to the constantly changing concentrations of the precursor wet film. The concentration change of a precursor solution as a function of time can be illustrated qualitatively by the LaMer diagram (Fig. 1). It can be observed that, with the evaporation of the solvent, the solution concentration increases and reaches the saturation concentration (denoted as Cs on the graph) at a time of t1. However, the formation of nuclei at this stage (stage I) is prohibited until the critical concentration (denoted as Cc) is reached at a time t2, owing to the fact that the energy barrier for nucleation has to be overcome. When the concentration is higher than Cc (stage II), both nucleation and crystal growth take place. The solution concentration increases constantly as the solvent continuously evaporates, which results in a fast rate of nucleation. Due to the competition between the solvent evaporation and the solute consumption by crystal growth, the concentration of the solution then starts to decrease and finally drops below Cc. It is seen from stage I and II that the nucleation rate increases with increased supersaturation; higher and faster supersaturation will lead to a higher nucleation rate and density (more nuclei) and, thus, a larger number of smaller crystals. In the third stage, no more nuclei are created but grains will continuously grow until the concentration drops below Cs.

3. Lessons learned from antisolvent extraction in spin coating
Since the two important processes, nucleation and crystal growth, are strongly related to the concentration of the solution or, in other words, to solvent evaporation, it is important to understand whether a fast or slow solvent evaporation rate is more favorable for producing high-quality photovoltaic perovskite layers. The classic crystallization protocol based on antisolvent extraction which is commonly used for spin coating provides a sound hint illustrating the importance of the creation of a supersaturation state in a very short time.6 After adding the orthogonal solvent just a few seconds before the end of the substrate rotation, rapid nucleation takes place, which brings the solution concentration above Cc. Therefore, nuclei are created on the substrate until the substrate is fully covered and in parallel the crystal growth time is reduced significantly during the spin coating process. The subsequent crystal growth is realized by applying thermal annealing, yielding a uniform perovskite film with small grain size and full surface coverage.
Based on the above analysis of the LaMer model and the classic antisolvent approach, it can be concluded that if fast evaporation of the solvent takes place, rapid supersaturation can be reached with the solution concentration continuously maintained above Cc. As a result, the nucleation rate will quickly increase and, meanwhile, the crystal growth time will decrease, leading to more nuclei as well as smaller and more uniform grains (Fig. 2). Therefore, to fabricate a uniform perovskite layer with complete surface coverage, the crystal growth rate should be slowed down and, more importantly, the number of nuclei should be increased during a short period at the early stage of precursor film drying. On the other hand, if the solvent evaporation is slow, the solution concentration drops below Cc but remains larger than Cs, which leads to fast and constant crystal growth. As a consequence, no more nuclei are generated but grain growth continues. This eventually brings about relatively small numbers of large grains with macroscopic inhomogeneity and incomplete surface coverage (Fig. 2).

4. One-step versus sequential two-step
From the deposition procedure point of view, perovskite thin films can be processed from solution by either one-step or two-step sequential deposition. Both approaches require delicate control over the crystallization kinetics to achieve dense and uniform perovskite films with minimal structural defects. In the one-step deposition method, a perovskite film is produced from a precursor solution mixture of an organic halide and lead halide. The precursor solution can be deposited by spin coating or other printing methods, followed by the conversion to perovskite crystals upon removing the solvents.6 Although the one-step method is relatively simple and inexpensive compared to the two-step procedure, it is challenging to produce uniform and compact perovskite films without delicately controlling the nucleation and crystal growth during film formation.
In comparison, perovskite films are produced through a conversion reaction of a lead halide and organic halide in the two-step sequential deposition.31–33 As a first step, lead iodide (PbI2) is deposited by spin coating or another coating method, and then dipped into a methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution and converted to a perovskite.31,32 Alternatively, sequentially coating the two precursor ingredients offers a more promising approach in terms of continuous high-throughput manufacture.34,35 During the conversion reaction, MAI molecules are inserted into the PbI2 structure, and the yellowish color of the PbI2 film is changed to dark brown, indicating the formation of perovskite crystals. It has been reported that the difference in the bulk lattice energy and the strong ionic interaction between the two materials are the driving force for inducing this reaction.31 PbI2 crystals feature strong intralayer chemical bonding but weak interlayer van der Waals interactions; therefore, MAI molecules can be easily inserted between these layers. In a two-step deposition process, the morphology of the perovskite films tends to be strongly dependent on the PbI2 film microstructure.35 Controlling the uniformity of the PbI2 film and its reactivity with MAI is the key factor for determining the quality of the perovskite layer.
5. Crystallization protocols for large-area coating of perovskite films
The preparation of a uniform and pinhole-free perovskite film over large areas plays a key role in delivering high performance perovskite solar cells and modules. It has been stated that the occurrence of the three stages (solution state, nucleation, and crystal growth) described in the LaMer graph strongly depends on the drying kinetics of the freshly coated perovskite precursor solution, which is, in principle, independent of the coating method. Therefore, the choice of quenching methods for the generation of the supersaturation state is of great importance to tune the balance between nucleation and crystal growth. Rapid solvent removal from the perovskite precursor solution results in fast supersaturation, leading to more nucleation with a shorter grain growth time, which is beneficial for preventing the aggregation and migration of the solute. Coupled with more nuclei, a shorter growth time suppresses the overgrowth of individual nuclei into large dendritic structures. In this section, we review the emerging crystallization approaches including hot-casting, solvent extraction, gas quenching, vacuum quenching, irradiation etc. that are capable of rapidly removing the solvent of printed precursors and thereby facilitating the growth of homogenous and dense perovskite thin films (Fig. 3). The photovoltaic parameters of the scalable deposited perovskite solar devices introduced in this section are summarized in Table 1.

5.1 Hot-casting
Hot-casting is a straightforward method of expediting solvent removal from a printed wet film and induces rapid supersaturation. Hot-casting can be facilely carried out by coating a perovskite solution on a preheated substrate. In 2015, Mohite and coauthors reported the fabrication of perovskite thin films based on hot-casting crystallization by spin coating.36 It is found that the grain size of the perovskite increases with an increase in the substrate temperature. Crystal grains on a millimeter scale are obtained when processed at temperatures up to 190 °C. They also discovered that the presence of a small amount of high boiling-point solvent is beneficial for obtaining large grains due to prolonged crystal growth. Benefiting from the suppressed charge recombination and improved carrier mobility, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite devices is greatly enhanced as a result of the large grain size.
Since controlling the substrate temperature in scalable coating methods is more convenient than in spin-coating, the hot-casting strategy has been applied to deposit thin films of perovskites by various printing methods, such as blade coating,17,37–43 spray coating,44,45 and dip coating.46 Early in 2015, Deng et al. for the first time reported blade-coating of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films on a preheated substrate (Fig. 4a).17 They found that the substrate temperature plays an important role in determining the crystal morphology of the perovskite films. A long time is required for drying the precursor wet film when blading at substrate temperatures of 100 °C or lower, resulting in non-uniform perovskite films with needle-like crystal domains and incomplete surface coverage (Fig. 4b). Blading the perovskite solution at 125 °C ensures rapid supersaturation of the precursor sheet, which is found to be the optimum temperature for obtaining continuous and smooth films (Fig. 4c). The perovskite solar cell prepared by hot-casting yields an efficiency of 15.1%. Further increasing the substrate temperature to 145 °C, close to the boiling point of the solvent DMF, is also able to produce smooth films with complete coverage. However, such a high temperature is found to decompose the prepared MAPbI3 films as well.

Hot-casting is also demonstrated to be effective for compositional engineering of formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites by blade coating. Compared to their MA-based counterparts, FA-based perovskites exhibit higher thermal stability and smaller bandgaps, which are more favorable for solar cell efficiency and operation. By taking advantage of the facile temperature control capability of blade coating, Deng et al. fabricated α-phase FA-based perovskite films by blade coating a solution mixture of FAI:MAI:PbI2 on preheated substrates.38 They found that a high temperature of 145 °C is required to obtain α-phase pure FAMAPbI3. Completely suppressing the formation of the δ-phase at temperatures lower than 100 °C was found to be difficult. To further stabilize the α-phase FA-based perovskite, Tang et al. added a very small amount of Cs cations into the precursor solution to enhance the phase purity of FA-based perovskite films.37 It is found that the incorporation of 2 mol% Cs reduces the Urbach energy and enhances the charge carrier lifetime in the films. In a very recent study, Wu et al. incorporated a small amount of phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) in an FA-based triple-cation perovskite precursor to suppress the formation of the δ-phase by hot-casting (Fig. 4d).47 The introduced Cl anion is able to modulate the crystal growth to obtain perovskite films with high crystallinity and large grains (Fig. 4e). The hot-cast solar cells achieved high efficiencies of 22.0% with a VOC of 1.18 V (Fig. 4f), corresponding to a very small voltage deficit of 0.33 V for the bandgap of 1.51 eV. Moreover, the stable α-phase FA-alloyed perovskite gives rise to significantly enhanced operational stability of the devices with 96% of the initial efficiency retained under one sun illumination for 500 h.
It should be noted that the surface energy of the substrate largely influences the solution drying kinetics and thereby greatly impacts the crystal morphology of the final perovskite film.48 In particular, it is challenging to coat a perovskite precursor solution on top of hydrophobic interfaces due to severe de-wetting problems.49 To overcome this limitation, Deng et al. proposed surfactant-controlled ink drying as a viable solution to alter the fluid drying dynamics during hot-casting of perovskite films by blade coating.50 Incorporating L-α-phosphatidylcholine as a surfactant into the precursor, they printed the perovskite solution with blading speeds higher than 50 mm s−1, which guarantees that the coated precursor stays wet before the substrate is moved from the blade coater to a hot plate for thermal annealing. They found that the solution flow toward crystal islands originates from the surface tension gradient, which leads to a rough and discontinuous crystal morphology. To suppress the solution flow during solution drying, they incorporated a very small amount of surfactant (20 ppm) to create a “Marangoni flow”, which originates from the gradient of surfactant concentration from the island periphery to the solution. As a result, the “Marangoni flow” counteracts and suppresses the original solution flow. They further showed that surfactants with charged quaternary ammonium ions not only improve the wettability of the solution on hydrophobic interfaces, but also passivate the defect states in perovskite films. Benefiting from the pinhole-free and smooth film with reduced trap states, solar modules with stabilized PCEs up to 15.3% and 14.6% are demonstrated with active areas of 33.0 and 57.2 cm2, respectively.
Understanding the underlying physics of the hot casting-based crystallization is highly desired to establish reproducible and scalable processes. To this end, comprehensive investigations on the structural evolution and crystal growth mechanism using time-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and time-resolved optical microscopy have been conducted (Fig. 5a and b).51–53 It is found that the participation of intermediate phases plays a key role in hot casting crystallization for both spin coating and blade coating. Slow solvent removal during blade coating at room temperature leads to indirect crystallization from the precursor sol–gel to perovskite crystals with the participation of intermediate phases, resulting in an inferior perovskite film with a dendritic crystal morphology (Fig. 5c). In contrast, blade coating at high substrate temperatures ensures fast removal of solvent, resulting in direct crystallization from a disordered sol–gel to MAPbI3 crystals by skipping the formation of intermediate phases (Fig. 5d). As a result, dense perovskite films with high crystallinity and good photophysical properties are obtained by coating the precursor films at a substrate temperature of 150 °C. Planar photovoltaic cells based on the perovskite films fabricated via direct crystallization deliver efficiencies of 18.74% (0.09 cm2) and 17.06% (1 cm2).51

Similar to the hot-casting procedure, a hot dip-coating technique was also developed, during which the preheated substrate is dipped into a hot perovskite precursor solution.54 The perovskite crystallizes on the substrate instantaneously as the substrate is drawn out from the solution. Solar cells based on hot-dipping coating yield a decent PCE of 12.4%. Given that dip-coating is one of the mature large-scale deposition methods, it is expected that improved device performance can be achieved using slot-die coating and high throughput roll-to-roll production lines by means of better control of the film thickness and roughness.
5.2 Meniscus-assisted solution printing
Controlling the crystallization dynamics during hot casting at high deposition temperatures approaching or exceeding the boiling point of the precursor solvent is found to be challenging. This is because the solute migration and aggregation associated with solution convection is extremely sensitive to the coating temperature. Therefore, special care and experienced operation are commonly required for the reproducible production of dense and uniform perovskite layers over large areas. To bypass this limitation, in 2017 He et al. developed a meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) method to fabricate perovskite films at a much milder temperature (Fig. 6a).55 A concave meniscus of the solution at the air/perovskite ink/substrate interfaces is formed due to capillary forces (Fig. 6b). Fast evaporation of the solvent is realized at the edge of the meniscus, which promotes the migration of the solute toward the front of the meniscus by outward convection. As a result, rapid supersaturation is realized at the front of the meniscus, which induces immediate crystallization of the perovskite at mild elevated temperatures. Real-time tracking of the perovskite crystal growth by optical microscopy is shown in Fig. 6c, which depicts the evolution of a perovskite nucleus into a large-grained microstructure. It is found that the coating speed and the substrate temperature play critical roles in controlling the outward convection during solution drying and the subsequent crystal growth. Using the optimized coating speed of 12 μm s−1 along with an optimal substrate temperature of 60 °C, pinhole-free perovskite films with large grain size and preferred orientation are successfully fabricated. Inverted (p–i–n) and normal (n–i–p) structured solar devices with an active area of 0.1 cm2 show stabilized PCEs of 19.1% and 19.9%, respectively (Fig. 6d and e). A large-area device with an active area of 1 cm2 is also fabricated, giving a PCE of ∼17%.

It should be noted that although MASP is capable of controllable perovskite deposition over large areas, the slow printing speed represents a major limitation, which can prohibit the feasibility for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the meniscus shape to a variety of factors such as the printing speed, gap between the substate and blade, and surface tension of the lower substrate imposes a barrier for the reliable implementation of the technology.
5.3 Meniscus-assisted soft-covering
In 2016, Han and coworkers developed a soft-covering crystallization method for scalable deposition of perovskite films.56 The soft-covering technology elegantly brings together the unique features of hot-casting and meniscus-assisted crystallization. A soft polymer sheet with high wettability is applied to spread perovskite precursor ink on a preheated substrate (Fig. 7a). The covering sheet also confines the precursor in the wet state between the substrate and the cover film, thereby preventing the fast evaporation of the solvent and undesired solute aggregation. Upon peeling off the cover film at a certain speed, a meniscus edge is formed at the interface of the substrate, cover film and air. As a result, fast solvent evaporation and crystallization take place instantaneously as the precursor solution is exposed to air. Compared with spin-coating, perovskite films deposited by soft-covering deposition (SCD) exhibit larger crystal grains (Fig. 7b and c), probably due to slow crystallization. Inverted solar cells based on the soft-covering deposited perovskite films deliver an efficiency of 17.6% with small hysteresis (Fig. 7b and c). Noticeably, a uniform perovskite thin film of up to 51 cm2 is prepared using this soft-covering method.

Reproduced with permission.56 Copyright 2016, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
It should be noted that the soft-covering process in a single step has to be carried out at a high substrate temperature of 210 °C, which may soften and deform the ultrathin polymer cover sheet, thereby constraining the processing window. Later on, an improved method of a low-temperature soft-covering-assisted sequential deposition process was developed.57 By rationally selecting a solvent of inorganic PbI2, the thermal convection in the PbI2 precursor solution can be well modulated. PbI2 processed at a low temperature of 80 °C possesses a smooth morphology without convection-related defects, which is a prerequisite for obtaining high-quality perovskite films via sequential two-step deposition. Homogeneous and convection-induced-defect-free MAPbI3 films are obtained by reacting the prepared PbI2 with MAI solution during capillary immersion. A flexible solar cell based on this method delivers an efficiency of 15.3%.
The crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite as well as its precursors PbI2 and MAI can react with methylamine gas and result in intermediate phases which are in a liquid state under ambient conditions.58,59 The formed MAPbI3·CH3NH2 liquid complex can be further processed by various solution coting methods. Taking this unique feature, Han and coworkers extended the soft-covering strategy to prepare high-quality MAPbI3 films by using a high pressure to spread the MAPbI3·CH3NH2 liquid complex on the substrate.59 A dense and pinhole-free perovskite film with large crystal grains is obtained over a large substrate (8 cm × 8 cm). Perovskite solar cells prepared by pressure-assisted soft-covering deliver a PCE of 19.3% (1.0 cm2). In addition, a 10-subcell series-connected module with an illuminated aperture area of 36.1 cm2 yields a certified efficiency of 12.1%.
5.4 Antisolvent quenching
It is noticed that in the aforementioned hot-casting and meniscus-assisted methods, the two important processes of perovskite formation, nucleation and crystal growth, take place simultaneously with the perovskite precursor solution deposition; it hence remains a major challenge to tailor the film morphology, crystallinity, and crystal orientation. In this regard, it is of great significance that the nucleation and crystal growth can be decoupled to achieve a more controlled fashion to manipulate the crystal morphology of the perovskite films. First introduced by Seok and coauthors in 2014,6 antisolvent extraction has been established as an effective and “standard” laboratory technique to prepare high-quality perovskite films of a wide variety of compositions. Antisolvent extraction is based on a fast quenching process, in which a supersaturation state is formed with a sudden removal of the excess solvent by pouring a large quantity of orthogonal solvent on the spinning perovskite precursor. A large number of antisolvents which are miscible with the perovskite precursor solvent but do not dissolve the perovskite crystals have been investigated, for instance toluene,6,60 chlorobenzene,61 ethyl ether,62 ethyl acetate,60 hexane62 and anisole.63 It has been proposed that the application of an antisolvent accelerates heterogeneous nucleation with the formation of an intermediate phase. Later studies confirm that the resulting intermediate phase consists of a molecular structure of MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO,3,35–37,64 which originates from the intercalation of MAI and DMSO into layered PbI2. Applying thermal annealing to the intermediate phase generates crystalline perovskite films that are smoother and of higher quality than those prepared by spin coating without antisolvent treatment.
At present, antisolvent extraction is implemented primarily in the spin-coating process. However, it is generally observed that the time window for dripping antisolvent is very narrow, which has to be carried out strictly several seconds after the substrate starts rotation or before the end of rotation. In addition, several key factors such as the volume of antisolvent, the distance of dripping and the local environment like the temperature, solvent atmosphere etc. may significantly influence the lab-to-lab or even batch-to-batch variation for PSC fabrication. Moreover, antisolvent dripping combined with spin-coating is neither scalable nor can it be transferred to scalable coating methods, and it is thus limited with respect to the film area for practical applications. To bypass this limitation, antisolvent bathing has been developed for the fabrication of uniform and dense MAPbI3,65 which features a few appealing attributes including room temperature deposition, rapid crystallization, and film smoothness. The versatility of antisolvent extraction was demonstrated by the preparation of mixed Sn–Pb perovskites with different bandgaps and semitransparent PSCs for tandem applications.63,66
In principle, antisolvent bathing imposes no limit on the substrate size and could be combined with blade-coating and other continuous coating methods (Fig. 8a). Different from hot-casting and meniscus-assisted printing where the crystallization takes place synchronously with the precursor deposition, crystallization based on antisolvent bathing is carried out after the completion of the precursor film deposition. Hence, to avoid the drying of the printed perovskite precursor film before immersing it into the antisolvent bath, it is important that either ultrafast transfer or a wide processing window can be achieved to ensure reproducible and scalable fabrication of PSCs. In practice, it would be intriguing to formulate a perovskite ink by means of solvent and additive engineering to keep the printed precursor film wet over a long period after deposition. Previous studies have shown that a mixed solvent containing GBL, DMSO and NMP leads to a longer evaporation time compared to single DMF for the perovskite precursor solutions, owing to the low saturation vapor pressure and the formation of an adduct between DMSO and PbI2.6 In 2017, Yang et al. reported on the development of a slow-drying perovskite precursor to ensure antisolvent extraction in scalable blade-coating deposition.68 Using a solvent mixture of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and DMF with a volume ratio of 9:8, a wide process window up to 8 min is achieved. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor, which is beneficial for the recrystallization of perovskite films to form dense and large grains with enhanced crystallinity. The combination of solvent and additive engineering enables blade coating of uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films of different compositions using an antisolvent bath (Fig. 8b).67 Photovoltaic devices with an active area of 0.12 cm2 show efficiencies of 18.08% and 18.96% for the light absorber of MAPbI3 and FA0.3MA0.7PbI3, respectively. Moreover, a series-connected four-cell module with an active area of 10.36 cm2 yields a stabilized PCE of 15.6%.

Antisolvent bathing has also been implemented in other scalable printing methods. In 2018, Whitaker et al. applied the antisolvent extraction method to crystallize perovskite precursor films deposited by slot-die coating and demonstrated almost identical photovoltaic performance to those prepared by spin-coating and blading.69 Employing the same material system, they further fabricated a 15.6% efficiency perovskite module by antisolvent bathing through the optimization of the interconnections.67
5.5 Gas quenching
Gas quenching relies on convection forces to quickly extract the coordinating solvent from the precursor film and induce nucleation and crystal growth. In this process, the gas flow rate and gas temperature are the two important parameters in delivering high-quality thin films of perovskites. In addition, the solvent composition that allows the formation of a stable intermediate phase is another important consideration. Early in 2014, Huang et al. reported, for the first time, the gas-blowing method for the preparation of MAPbI3 films by spin-coating.70 During substrate rotation, dry argon gas with a pressure of 40 psi is blown over the surface of the precursor solution to promote evaporation of the solvent, thereby leading to rapid supersaturation of the film. The perovskite film prepared by gas quenching shows a dense and compact morphology without pinholes after thermal annealing, whereas the films prepared without gas quenching exhibit a dendritic grain morphology. Later in 2016, Snaith and coworkers extended gas quenching as a general technique to produce smooth pinhole-free perovskite films of a wide variety of material compositions.71 They found that the addition of DMSO to a DMF-based precursor plays a key role in achieving dense and smooth perovskite films due to the formation of an intermediate perovskite precursor–DMSO complex. As a result, slow crystal growth is realized, analogous to the antisolvent quenching method. Similar to antisolvent extraction, the timing of gas-blowing during spinning should be carefully optimized depending on the material composition and solvent systems.
Gas quenching was later developed for depositing perovskite films by scalable methods. In 2015, Di Carlo and coworkers used the concept to fabricate PSCs via two-step blade coating.72 To obtain uniform and smooth perovskite layers, an airflow system was introduced during blade coating of PbI2, resulting in a compact film morphology. The conversion to the MAPbI3 perovskite is carried out by immersing the resultant PbI2 in a MAI bath. An efficiency of 13.3% is obtained for small-size blade coated perovskite devices. Perovskite modules with active areas of 10.1 and 100 cm2 deliver efficiencies of 10.3% and 4.3%, respectively. Also in 2015, Vak et al. reported the application of a 3D slot-die coater for the two-step sequential deposition of perovskite films.73 They attach a second slot-die head behind the first slot-die head, where the second head is connected to high-pressure nitrogen, which is used to quickly dry PbI2 by blowing nitrogen gas. To improve the uniformity of the PbI2 layer, the slot-die coated PbI2 has to be stored in an enclosed container. The resulting PbI2 layer exhibits a micro crack structure which enables much faster conversion to the perovskite when it reacts with the slot-die coated MAI solution. Careful optimization of the coating speed and substrate temperature yields a PCE of 11.96% for fully slot-die coated perovskite solar cells. Using an air blade to assist solvent drying, the gas quenching method was also applied for one-step slot-die coating of mixed lead halide perovskites.18 In addition, hot gas quenching was developed to crystallize MAPbI3 films prepared by one-step slot-die printing of a nonstoichiometric precursor of lead acetate and MAI.53
In 2018, Hu and coworkers developed an elegant air-blading technique which is capable of spreading the precursor solution and, simultaneously, inducing solvent evaporation (Fig. 9a).74 They found that air blading of a perovskite precursor solution at room temperature produces an intermediate adduct consisting of ((MA)2[(PbI3)2PbI2]·2DMSO), which is analogous to the antisolvent extraction method (Fig. 9b). In their air-blading process, the thickness of the perovskite films can be tailored by controlling the pressure of the input N2 flow. In addition, a small amount of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) is incorporated as an additive to facilitate the growth of a uniform and compact perovskite film with a large grain size (>2 μm) and long carrier lifetime (Fig. 9c).75 Perovskite solar devices prepared by air blading at a pressure of 0.3 MPa yield high efficiencies of 20.08% and 19.12% for active areas of 0.09 and 1.0 cm2, respectively (Fig. 9d and e).

Through tailoring the solvent coordination capability, in 2019 Huang and coworkers extended the gas quenching technology for blade coating perovskite films at an ultra-high speed of 99 mm s−1 (Fig. 10a).76 They found that processing from a coordinating solvent of pure DMSO results in dendritic crystals (Fig. 10b), owing to the formation of intermediate phases composed of PbI2–MAI–DMSO which are stable at room temperature (Fig. 10c). On the other hand, processing from noncoordinating solvents (i.e. acetonitrile) enables one to skip the generation of the intermediate film, which eventually leads to small crystal grains with poor physical contact with the interface layer beneath (Fig. 10b). The utilization of a coordinating and noncoordinating solvent mixture produces dense perovskite films with large crystals, owing to the slow release of coordinating solvent during film formation. The decoupling of the precursor coating and temperature-induced crystallization ensures high reproducibility, which is demonstrated by fabricating a large-area perovskite film on a flexible substrate (Fig. 10d) and a mini module (63.7 cm2) showing a certified efficiency of 16.4% (Fig. 10e). Very recently, gas-quenching was applied to fabricate flexible perovskite devices by blade-coating. Small-sized (0.08 cm2) devices and large-area (42.9 cm2) flexible modules fabricated on Corning Willow Ultrathin Glass showed high efficiencies of 19.72% and 15.86%, respectively.77 Given the general application of air-blading coating in industry,78,79 it is anticipated that air-blading can be applied to up-scaling perovskite thin films by continuous roll-to-roll manufacturing.

5.6 Vacuum quenching
Vacuum quenching relies on changes in pressure to remove the coordinating solvent of the printed precursor films and initiate nucleation by reaching supersaturation. Similar to the solvent bath extraction and gas quenching strategies, one distinct advantage of vacuum quenching is that the precursor solution deposition and thermally induced crystallization can be effectively decoupled. In 2015, Xie et al. reported a vacuum-assisted thermal annealing process to modulate the composition and morphology of MAPbI3 films.80 They found that the implementation of a vacuum can effectively remove the byproduct of MACl generated from a perovskite precursor consisting of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 during thermal annealing, which gives rise to composition-pure and pore-free MAPbI3 films. Vacuum assisted thermal annealing was later applied to crystallize perovskite films prepared by inkjet printing.81 In the vacuum quenching process, the vacuum degree and vacuum duration are the two determinative parameters that should be taken into account.82 A year later in 2016, a major advance was realized by developing vacuum flash-assisted solution processing to produce uniform and highly-crystalline perovskite thin films.83 Subjecting the freshly spin-coated precursor film to a high vacuum enables sudden removal of residual solvent in a controlled manner. As a result, rapid crystallization of a fibrous complex consisting of a Lewis acid–base type adduct is obtained, which is converted to a crystalline perovskite with subsequent thermal annealing. Solar devices with an aperture area of 1 cm2 prepared by vacuum flash-assisted processing deliver a certified efficiency approaching 20%.83
In an early stage, the vacuum quenching technique was primarily pursued for perovskite deposition by spin coating with the aspiration of replacing antisolvent dripping.82–87 A significant advance was achieved in 2019 by extending the vacuum quenching strategy to large-area deposition of high-quality perovskite films by blade coating.88–91 In a two-step sequential approach, a vacuum apparatus is deployed to extract the superfluous solvent of the freshly deposited inorganic component PbI2 (Fig. 11a).88 It is shown that the choice of solvent and the subjection to a mild vacuum are the two most important factors to obtain homogenous lead iodide (PbI2) films. Depositing PbI2 from a single solvent of DMF leads to large haze with obvious coffee rings, owing to the fast evaporation of the solvent DMF because of its high vapor pressure (2.70 mmHg at 20 °C) (Fig. 11b). On the other hand, blade-coating PbI2 from a binary solvent mixture of DMSO and DMF produces a more homogenous film, but the naturally dried PbI2 exhibits needle-like crystals, mainly owing to the preferred crystal growth of the PbI2–DMSO adduct during slow solvent evaporation (Fig. 11c). In contrast, deploying vacuum extraction on the freshly coated PbI2 precursor film processed from 9:1 DMF/DMSO solvent allows rapid removal of the excess solvent, which results in a solid PbI2 layer with a smooth and shiny appearance over the entire substrate (Fig. 11d). More significantly, the resulting PbI2 film exhibits a mesoporous structure, which is highly desired for perovskite conversion via an insertion reaction with the organic salt MAI. As a result, homogenous and compact MAPbI3 films are obtained by coating a solution of MAI on top of PbI2 at a mild temperature of 50 °C.

In 2019, a generalized one-step approach based on vacuum-quenching was developed, which allows one to prepare dense and uniform perovskite films over large areas (Fig. 12a).89 Subjecting the freshly coated precursor wet film to a mild vacuum of 1000 Pa produces an intermediate film composed of a mixture of the crystalline perovskite and an intermediate phase with a molecular structure of MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO. It is found that incorporating processing additives (MACl, MASCN, KSCN etc.) into the precursor solution facilitates the growth of perovskite crystals during the vacuum process (Fig. 12b and c). Homogenous large-area perovskite films with high specular reflection and low-haze transmittance are obtained by applying thermal annealing to the vacuum-processed intermediate films (Fig. 12d). Inverted perovskite devices prepared by one-step vacuum quenching deliver a PCE over 18% with a high FF of 80% (Fig. 12e). A large-area solar module is also fabricated (Fig. 12f), demonstrating the scalability of the technology. Furthermore, solar cells based on three perovskite material compositions with different bandgaps were fabricated (Fig. 12g), illustrating the general applicability of the one-step vacuum quenching technology.

In follow-up work, the vacuum quenching protocol was extended to scalable fabrication of low-bandgap tin–lead (Sn–Pb) mixed perovskites by blade coating.93,94 High-quality thin films of Sn–Pb perovskites with different bandgaps are facilely prepared by subjecting the freshly coated precursor films to a vacuum, followed by a thermal annealing process.93 Solar cells based on vacuum-quenching processed (MAPbI3)0.75(FASnI3)0.25 deliver high efficiencies over 17%,94 comparable to those prepared by antisolvent spin coating. In very recent work, the vacuum quenching approach was used to fabricate flexible perovskite solar cells on polymer substrates by blade coating (Fig. 12h).92 Morphology engineering in combination with interface design successfully addresses the two major challenges: depositing high-quality perovskite layers on polymer substrates with high roughness and the inefficient charge extraction due to the energetic mismatch at the interface. In particular, the rationally designed double hole transport layer comprised of “poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]” forms a cascade energy level alignment with the adjacent layers of polyethylene naphthalate/indium tin oxide and the perovskite, which ultimately gives rise to an enhanced spectral response as well as remarkably improved fill factors. The champion small-size flexible perovskite cells prepared by vacuum-assisted blade-coating deliver an efficiency as high as 19.41% with a high FF of 81% (Fig. 12i). In addition, a large-size flexible device with an active area of 1 cm2 yields an efficiency of 16.61% (Fig. 12j), which is comparable to the flexible PSCs prepared by spin-coating.95,96
In addition to blade coating, vacuum quenching has also been applied for the fabrication of triple-cation perovskite layers by inkjet printing and spray coating (Fig. 13a).20,97 It is shown that the thickness of perovskite films can be easily controlled by adjusting the density of the ink droplets. Perovskite layers with thicknesses ranging from 400 nm up to 4 μm can be facilely prepared by inkjet printing with a droplet resolution from 600 to 2000 dots per inch (Fig. 13b). Solar devices based on vacuum quenching assisted inkjet printing yield a champion efficiency of 21.6% from the reverse scan (Fig. 13c). In a very recent report, a perovskite solar cell which was completely inkjet printed with the exception of the two charge-collecting electrodes was fabricated, giving an efficiency of 17.2% (Fig. 13d).98

5.7 Radiative annealing
Irradiation offers a rapid and contactless approach for heating target materials, which enables not only the photon energy to be effectively absorbed in the active layer, but also in the underlying transparent conductive contact.99 In contrast to the highly energy consuming thermal processes, radiative annealing allows a significant reduction of the manufacturing cost, owing to the short processing time and more efficient energy utilization. In 2015, Troughton et al. developed a rapid irradiation annealing process to crystallize spin-coated MAPbI3 on an aluminium oxide scaffold. The crystallization time is significantly reduced from 45 min of annealing in a conventional oven to 2.5 s by near infrared radiation without significant performance losses.100 Switching to an intensive photonic flash sintering technique, the processing time was further reduced to 1.15 ms. Unfortunately, the prepared perovskite films exhibit incomplete surface coverage and thus lower device performance compared to the conventional thermally annealed devices.101
A notable advance was achieved in 2016 by Pool et al., who applied radiative thermal annealing to formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) and prepared solar cells with photovoltaic performance slightly outperforming the devices prepared by hotplate annealing.102 Similarly, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been utilized for annealing perovskites, which offers the advantage of layer-specific annealing, because the LED light source is able to provide a specific UV wavelength for maximum light absorption in the target layer.103 Recently, ultrafast laser scribing has been exploited as an effective technique to anneal perovskite films. By tuning the laser scanning parameters, such as the laser wavelength, scanning speed and output power, perovskite films with larger crystalline grains compared to thermally annealed samples are obtained. Solar devices based on laser annealed MAPbI3 photoactive layers exhibit an efficiency of up to 20%.104 However, it has to be noted that, prior to subjection to radiative laser annealing, an intermediate film has to be created by antisolvent quenching during spin-coating, which limits its potential for upscaling.102–104
In order to realize upscaling of the technology, it is of great significance that the antisolvent dripping step commonly involved in perovskite deposition by spin-coating can be avoided. In 2018, Sanchez et al. reported a flash infrared annealing (FIRA) approach which allows one to skip the antisolvent quenching involved in spin-coating.105 They found that the crystal structure and morphology of the perovskite films are closely correlated with the FIRA pulse duration (Fig. 14a). A short irradiation time of 1.0 s produces a 3D MAPbI3 film along with larger contribution of low-dimensional perovskites (Fig. 14c). An irradiation time of 1.7–2.0 s results in large and pinhole-free crystalline domains with XRD patterns resembling the antisolvent sample. Further increasing the irradiation time leads to the decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2. The optimal pulse duration is identified to be in the range of 1.5–3 s, which enables the formation of phase-pure perovskite films (Fig. 14b). Solar cells with active areas of 0.16 cm2 and 1.4 cm2 processed with 1.7 s irradiation time MAPbI3 give efficiencies of 19.0% and 14.6%, respectively (Fig. 14d and e). The practical application of FIRA for upscaling is supported by manufacturing uniform large-area perovskite films (100 cm2) on both glass and polymer substrates (Fig. 14f). A detailed study giving comparisons with the common lab-scale antisolvent method suggests that flash infrared annealing is potentially a cost-effective method with a low environmental impact for the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells.106

6. Morphology optimization in scalable coated perovskite films
6.1 Additive engineering
In the previous section, we have presented a detailed discussion of the several crystallization technologies capable of depositing photovoltaic perovskite films by scalable methods. In essence, these technologies rely on the fast removal of the precursor solvent, thereby inducing rapid supersaturation. In addition, a consensus reached on the growth of perovskite thin films is that the nucleation and crystal growth are also heavily correlated with the solution chemistry of the precursors. A large number of studies have shown that the morphology of perovskite films can be regulated by varying the chemical composition and/or by introducing additives into the precursor solution.37,50,87,89,92,107,108
In the early stages of perovskite research, chloride-containing precursors (PbCl2 and MAI) were commonly used to produce perovskite layers with better coverage and larger grain sizes than those obtained from a stoichiometric precursor (PbI2 and MAI).28,109 Other typical chloride additives such as MACl, formamidinium chloride, NH4Cl and Pb(SCN)2 are also capable of regulating the morphology of perovskite films.89,110–113 In addition, the orientation and crystallinity of the perovskite films can also be effectively tailored by incorporating these additives.68,89 It has been revealed that the as-spun film processed from chloride-containing precursors consists of crystalline MA2PbI3Cl,114,115 coexisting with amorphous MACl. The generated intermediate film is less crystalline than the film deposited directly from the stoichiometric precursor. In addition, the presence of MACl impedes the transformation of the precursor into the perovskite.114 Upon thermal annealing, the slow evaporation of MACl acts as a self-regulating mechanism to slow the conversion, resulting in a perovskite film with dense coverage and improved crystal quality. Although these additives are initially used in spin-coated perovskite devices, they are also applicable in scalable coating methods. For example, MACl/NH4Cl has been demonstrated as an effective additive in modulating the crystal morphology of perovskite films deposited by scalable methods with the assistance of hot-casting,37 solvent-extraction,68 vacuum quenching,89,92 and gas-quenching.77 Other surfactant-based additives are shown to have a great impact on the ink drying kinetics, which enables high-speed deposition of perovskite photovoltaic layers.50
6.2 Lewis acid–base adduct approach
Lewis acids and bases are described by the Lewis theory of acid–base reactions as electron-pair acceptors and electron-pair donors, respectively. A Lewis base can donate a pair of electrons to a Lewis acid to form a product containing a coordinate covalent bond. In perovskite precursors, Pb2+ halides are strong Lewis acids that can readily form adducts with Lewis-basic solvents or additives.116,117 The formation of Lewis acid–base adducts in the precursor solution enhances the solubility of lead halides.118 Moreover, Lewis acid–base adducts have enabled the development of the adduct approach, utilizing the adduct film as an intermediate phase to control the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. Through the selection of Lewis bases with different basicity, the nucleation and crystal growth can be effectively modulated. In this regard, the Lewis acid–base approach can be used to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films. For example, the addition of DMSO or thiourea to a precursor solution of PbI2 and MAI in DMF leads to the formation of a Lewis acid–base adduct,117,119 and the morphology of the resultant thin film is greatly improved compared with the film prepared from the pristine precursor solution.92 In addition to DMSO, other Lewis-basic solvents, such as pyridine and NMP, can be used for adduct formation.120 Other examples of Lewis-basic additives with the ability to modify perovskite thin-film morphologies are urea,121,122 thiocyanate and thiosemicarbazide.123 These additives have been demonstrated to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films as well as passivate the defect states due to the strong bonding between the under-coordinated Pb2+ and the Lewis basic molecules,124,125 which are beneficial for large-area fabrication of perovskite films by scalable methods.
6.3 Post-growth approach
In perovskite solar devices, the thickness of the light absorber layers is typically in the range of 300–600 nm. With such a thin layer, film uniformity and complete surface coverage are the two essential factors to the production yield of large-area perovskite modules. Even with myriad strategies addressing the crystal morphology, perovskite deposition is still fundamentally sensitive to the processing conditions. The variation of the processing parameters and changes even on a small scale in the local atmosphere can result in inferior device performance due to the formation of pinholes and structural defects. To eliminate the structural defects in the prepared perovskite films, several post-annealing treatments have been developed, which can increase the process reliability for reproducible fabrication of large-area perovskite modules.
Solvent vapor annealing of perovskite films in a controlled environment has been demonstrated as an effective technique to enhance the grain size and crystallinity and to remove local pinholes. Several solvents have shown an efficient Ostwald ripening effect to heal the structural defects in perovskite thin films and resulted in enhanced solar cell performance. For example, Huang and coauthors reported the use of DMF vapor annealing to increase the grain size and improve the electronic quality of perovskite films.126 Other solvents including water, alcohols, DMSO, GBL or combinations of them have been utilized for solvent vapor annealing.127–129
An Ostwald ripening approach enabled by coating a solution of ammonium halide has also been demonstrated to heal the structural defects in perovskite thin films. The ripening process removes pinholes and increases the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite film. For example, MAPbI3 films treated with a diluted MABr solution (2 mg ml−1) followed by brief annealing at 150 °C exhibit a more uniform and compact morphology with larger crystal grains.130 It is also reported that a capping layer consisting of a material with a larger bandgap can be formed by coating a solution of guanidinium bromide, which is capable of reducing nonradiative recombination of the solar devices due to defect passivation on the perovskite surface.131 As a result, a VOC gain up to 100 mV is realized without sacrificing the photocurrent.
6.4 Impact of interface layers
It is well documented that the surface energy of the charge transporting layers significantly influences the solution processability and morphology of the perovskite films. Hydrophobic polymeric interfaces have been shown to be beneficial for growing perovskite films with large crystal domains.48 However, if the surface energy of the interface layers is significantly higher than that of the hydrophilic perovskite precursor solution, incomplete surface coverage of the perovskite films with numbers of pinholes can be formed. In severe circumstances, de-wettings are frequently observed due to the super-hydrophobic properties of the interfaces.132 To bypass this limitation, surface modifications via oxygen plasma or ultraviolet–ozone treatment have been proposed to decrease the surface energy of the charge extracting layers,133,134 enabling one to deposit dense and uniform perovskite layers on non-wetting interfaces. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that the plasma-based surface modifications may negatively change the chemical structure of the materials, thereby altering the optoelectronic properties of the interface layers,134 such as the work function, transparency and mobility of the films. Prior to perovskite deposition, coating a thin layer of an amphiphilic conjugated semiconducting polymer to lower the surface energy of the hydrophobic interlayers offers another effective method.132 Alternatively, physical modification by depositing a mesoporous insulating layer,28,49 acting as an inert scaffold, has been proved to be a viable approach allowing one to deposit high-quality perovskite films without deteriorating the original optoelectronic properties of the interface layers. Not only does the surface energy of the interface layer influence the crystal morphology of perovskites, but it was also recently demonstrated that the wettability of the blade also has a profound impact on the morphological properties of the scalable coated perovskite thin films.135
7. Summary and outlook
Perovskites solar cells have become a strong contender among photovoltaic technologies, rivaling the successful silicon-based solar panels and inorganic thin-film solar cells of cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide. The intriguing efficiency advances achieved from low-temperature solution-processed devices have motivated the photovoltaic community to devote resources for upscaling of PSC technology. Notwithstanding, owing to the low entropy of perovskite formation, the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth readily take place at room temperature during solution processing. The low activation energy can lead to rapid nucleation and crystal growth, making control over the crystal morphology of scalable-coated perovskite films elusive. In this review, starting with an in-depth analysis of the LaMer model, we conclude that controlling the crystallization kinetics by realizing fast nucleation and slow crystal growth is crucial to obtain uniform perovskite films with high surface coverage. Based on this guideline, we comprehensively analyze several emerging crystallization methods of great potential for the large-scale fabrication of perovskite thin films. Among them, hot-casting offers the most straightforward approach for high speed deposition of perovskite thin films, yet the simultaneous occurrence of nucleation and crystal growth generally requires experienced operation to achieve repeatable fabrication.17,37–39 As well, hot-casting may face challenges for roll-to-roll processing on flexible polymer substrates. Meniscus-assisted solution coating carried out at relatively low temperature alleviated the dilemma, but the coating speed represents a major limitation.55 Derived from the classic antisolvent spin-coating, anti-solvent bathing is able to produce high-quality perovskite films by scalable methods.68 However, recirculation of the antisolvent bath imposes a major technical concern for continuous high-throughput production. Enabling the decoupling of precursor solution deposition and the subsequent thermal annealing, gas quenching74,76 and vacuum quenching88,89 are promising protocols for reproducible fabrication of perovskite films. Apart from developing robust crystallization protocols for depositing high-quality perovskite absorber layers by scalable printing methods, there are several additional major challenges that have to be addressed in order to realize practical application of the technology.
7.1. Perovskite ink formulation
Currently, the large efficiency gap associated with the transition from laboratory devices to large-area modules is still noticeable (Fig. 15), which represents one of the major obstacles towards commercial application.136 The announcement of record efficiency is mainly realized on small-area devices fabricated by lab-scale spin-coating. Given the fundamental difference between the crystallization dynamics of anti-solvent spin-coating (nucleates in seconds during anti-solvent washing) and scalable coating (takes a few tens of seconds for solvent removal), it is of imperative necessity to re-formulate a precursor ink specifically designed for scalable crystallization. In addition, developing new interface materials with outstanding optoelectronic properties and advanced module design and fabrication techniques will accelerate closing the efficiency gap between lab-scale devices and large-area modules.
 Fig. 15  Efficiency evolution of PSCs taken from the NERL chart and printed solar devices with perovskite layers prepared by scalable crystallization methods. The PCE of the scalable printed perovskite devices has gradually increased, yet a noticeable efficiency gap between the scalable printed devices and the record efficiency cells still remains. 
7.2. Addressing the stability
The stability is another critical issue in realizing the commercialization of perovskite solar technology. MA-based perovskites are currently the most intensively investigated material, yet they show poor moisture and thermal stability due to the hydrophilicity and volatility of MA+. In comparison, mixed cations and mixed halide perovskites with better resistance to moisture and heat are more appealing for fabricating perovskite solar cells with long-term stability.137,138
Dimensionality control can be a promising approach to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells.139 Recent studies indicated that, as compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites possess notably higher ambient stability due to the moisture-resistance of the bulky organic cations.140,141 Combining the outstanding stability of the 2D phase with the excellent photovoltaic properties of 3D perovskites offers a plausible way to simultaneously address the efficiency and stability of the devices. Incorporating a small amount of large-size ammonium cations into the perovskite precursor, the prepared perovskites with mixed 2D/3D phases have shown great promise in reducing the degradation of the solar devices.94,141–143 Alternatively, constructing 2D/3D bilayer heterostructures via sequential layer-by-layer deposition93,144,145 has received considerable attention due to their effectiveness in delivering high performance PSCs with significantly enhanced stability. Recently, spontaneous self-assembly of such a 2D/3D bilayer structure by one-step coating118 has been demonstrated as another viable approach to improve the efficiency and stability. It should be noted that the defect states of the solution-processed perovskite layers are mainly located at the surface of the films. The formation of a 2D perovskite thin layer on top of 3D crystals can effectively passivate the surface trap states, thereby significantly increasing the carrier lifetime, which is the key factor for achieving high VOC.93,94,118,138
Developing advanced packaging techniques such as depositing a water-resistant layer on top of perovskite solar cells may provide solutions to circumvent the environmental instability as well.146 In addition, crystal crosslinking with modified molecules or blending hydrophobic additives into a perovskite will also improve the stability of PSCs towards commercialization.
7.3. All-inorganic perovskites
The current research interest is mainly focused on organic–inorganic perovskite composites that are capable of affording high efficiency devices. Nevertheless, it should be noted that all-inorganic perovskites are an important category of PSCs, mainly owing to their high thermal stability and rapid efficiency advances. Among them, CsPbBr3 is relatively stable in ambient conditions, which is, however, not suitable for photovoltaic application due to its wide bandgap of 2.3 eV.147,148 The challenge to process Br/I mixed halide or CsPbI3 all-inorganic perovskites with lower bandgaps mainly originates from their phase instability due to the easy formation of the yellow δ-phase on the one hand,149,150 and the difficulty in controlling the crystal morphology of films due to the faster crystallization rate than the organic–inorganic counterparts on the other hand.151 In this regard, we expect that slowing down the crystallization dynamics and stabilizing the black phase perovskites by rationally selecting a processing additive would be a promising avenue to fabricate efficient all-inorganic PSCs by scalable methods. On the other hand, a recent study discovered a step-wise crystallization behavior in all-inorganic CsPbI2Br, which was realized by optimizing the blade coating temperature during hot casting.152
7.4. Environmental impact
Lastly, it is worth noting that the highest performance PSCs with long-term stability still contain lead. Unfortunately, the toxicity of the heavy metal Pb and its solubility in water raise concerns with respect to pollution to humans and the environment, which hampers the acceptance of the technology and may conflict with legislative barriers. In this regard, more attention and research efforts should be devoted to evaluating the environmental impact and to developing robust encapsulation techniques to prevent Pb leakage. In addition, simple and effective methods are supposed be developed to recycle the perovskite devices at the end of their lifetime.
