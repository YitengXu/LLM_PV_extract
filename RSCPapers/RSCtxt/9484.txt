    , Accepted 2nd November 2016First published on 3rd November 2016AbstractNanoporous bismuth vanadate is modified simultaneously via tungsten doping and graphene surface modification for use as an efficient photoanode. The modified films were prepared on a FTO substrate by a drop-cast method followed by photoreduction of graphene oxide. SEM, XRD, Raman and XPS characterization was conducted to confirm the incorporation of tungsten and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and to look into their influences on the structure and performance of BiVO4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis clearly revealed enhanced carrier density and improved electronic conductivity, which are beneficial for the enhancement of PEC performance in comparison to either individually doped or RGO modified BiVO4. Our results indicated that the enhanced PEC performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of bulk doping and surface modification that facilitates electron and hole transport and transfer in the bulk and at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.
Introduction
Research on semiconductor films for solar water splitting and solar cells has been motivated by the demand for renewable clean energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen and oxygen evolution using semiconductor materials is a highly appreciated method for solar energy conversion and storage.1–3 Regarded as one of the most promising n-type photoanode materials, bismuth vanadate has a balance of sufficient visible light absorption (band gap of ∼2.4 eV), chemical stability, cost-effectiveness, and suitable band edge positions for efficient PEC water oxidation.4,5 However, the severe charge recombination, poor electron transport and poor water oxidation kinetics restrict its further development for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.
Therefore, numerous efforts have been dedicated to the modification of bismuth vanadate aimed at overcoming the adverse factors and fruitful progress has been achieved. Among them, doping of tungsten, molybdenum and phosphate effectively promotes charge carrier density and improves the electron transport properties and thus suppresses electron–hole recombination.6–12 Loading of oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) can greatly accelerate surface water oxidation kinetics and achieve higher efficiencies at a lower applied potential.13–19 Heterostructures are adopted as an effective strategy to improve charge transport, charge separation10,20–22 or photo-absorption in BiVO4 by compositing with other semiconductors or conductors. Among the semiconductors used, the most effective material is WO3.12,23–25 Other strategies such as hydrogenation,26 surface modification27,28 and (electro)chemical pretreatment29,30 have also been adopted.
Graphene based materials have also drawn much attention for their utilization in solar energy conversion and storage.31–35 The excellent structural and electronic properties of graphene enable its application as an electron mediator to improve photogenerated charge carrier transport in photoconversion systems. According to Ng et al., BiVO4 hybridized with reduced graphene oxide showed improved photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency attributed to promoted charge transfer and better electrical contact with the substrate.36 Hou et al. developed a heterojunction array of α-Fe2O3/graphene/BiV1−xMoxO4 core/shell nanorods for PEC water splitting in which graphene served as an electron mediator, promoting charge transport and separation and thus enhancing the energy conversion efficiency. However, in-depth investigations into the role of graphene at the surface of semiconductors and the relationship between charge transport and transfer in the bulk and at the surface are still insufficient.
In order to address these issues, in this work, both the bulk and surface properties of bismuth vanadate were simultaneously improved via a facile route combining W doping and surface reduced graphene oxide modification. The combination of bulk doping and surface modification generates a synergetic effect for the enhancement of PEC water splitting (Scheme 1). Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were implemented to understand the mechanism of the synergetic effect and the role of reduced graphene oxide.

Experimental section
Bismuth vanadate nanoporous films were prepared via a repeated drop-cast method. Equal molar ratios of bismuth nitrate hexahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.485 g) and vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) were dissolved in 15 mL of acetic acid and 35 mL of ethanol, respectively. Then the obtained two solutions were mixed together and stirred for 30 min to obtain the final precursor for drop-casting. For the precursor of W doped BiVO4, a 3% molar ratio of WCl6 was added to replace the same molar amount of vanadyl acetylacetonate when preparing the 35 mL VO(acac)2 ethanol solution. Before the drop-cast coating process for all of the different films, the solutions were ultrasonicated for 5 minutes. Then 0.5 mL of the solution was drop-cast onto a FTO substrate at a temperature of 120 °C and then annealed at 450 °C for 5 min in air. This procedure was repeated for 5 cycles to obtain the desired thickness of the films and then subjected to a final annealing at 450 °C for 2 h.
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized via a modified Hummers method.37 A 200 μL GO aqueous solution (50 μg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the (tungsten doped) BiVO4 film at 2000 rpm for 10 s. Then the film was annealed at 400 °C for 0.5 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere to improve the adhesion between GO and the BiVO4 nanoparticles. Then the films were photoreduced in 50 mL of ethanol with 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp irradiation for 1 h to convert the GO to RGO.36,38
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined using a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength 1.5406 Å). The morphology of the samples was investigated using a JEOL JSM-7800FE scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI TECNAI-F30 TEM at 300 kV. The chemical compositions and element states of the samples were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Axis UltraDLD, Kratos) with monochromatic aluminum Kα radiation. The Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR800 confocal Raman spectrometer from Jobin Yvon. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PTI QM-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature. UV-vis spectra of the films were measured on a HITACHI U4100 instrument.
PEC measurement was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell with illumination from the backside and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. Photocurrents were recorded under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp as the white light source in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The potentials versus Ag/AgCl were converted to be versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following Nernst equation  where  at 25 °C.
Mott–Schottky measurements were performed in the dark with a frequency of 1 kHz. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was performed within a frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under illumination at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl using a potentiostat, 273A from Princeton Applied Research Company (PARC), and an analyzer, model 5210 Lock-in from Signal Recovery. Incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution using a monochromator.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM morphologies of pure BiVO4, W doped BiVO4 (W-BiVO4), RGO modified BiVO4 (BiVO4/RGO) and BiVO4 with both treatments (W-BiVO4/RGO). The pristine BiVO4 film has a uniform surface composed of nanoparticles with a particle size of about 50 nm. As shown in Fig. 1b, the tungsten doping in BiVO4 does not substantially change its morphology or particle size. The results are similar to those reported previously13 except for the smaller particle sizes, which are beneficial for surface reaction and further modification.

Due to the nature of the spin-coating method and the unique morphology of RGO, a very tiny amount of RGO sheets was successfully deposited on the film surface. Heat treatment was adopted to improve the adhesion between GO sheets and the BiVO4 nanoparticles. Most of the GO sheets are found embedded into the gaps between nanoparticles and serve as a connection between the nanoparticles for RGO modified BiVO4 or W-BiVO4. The thicknesses of all of the films are similar and estimated to be about 800 nm from cross-section SEM (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The RGO modified samples were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal the coverage of graphene and the structure of the interfaces. As shown in Fig. 2, graphene sheets could be obviously observed at the bottom of the BiVO4 and W-BiVO4 particles, connecting the nanoparticles tightly. The lattice fringe spacings of 0.292 nm and 0.467 nm match well with the (040) and (011) planes of monoclinic bismuth vanadate. TEM measurements agree well with the SEM results and reveal the structure of the interfaces between BiVO4/W-BiVO4 and graphene. The RGO sheets show good coverage and tight connections with the nanoparticles of BiVO4 and W-BiVO4, which is beneficial for charge transfer and PEC performance.

The elements and their valence states can be identified with XPS, while the successful reduction of GO can also be confirmed. The normalized XPS spectra of Bi 4f, V 2p, and W 4f before and after RGO modification are displayed in Fig. 3. The binding energies of Bi 4f are located at 158.9 eV and 164.2 eV, and those of V 2p are located at 516.5 eV and 523.9 eV for pure BiVO4. After tungsten doping and RGO modification, the binding energies for Bi 4f and V 2p show slight shifts (0.1–0.2 eV) to higher binding energies, indicating that tungsten doping in the bulk and RGO modification at the surface interact with the atoms and thus impact the valence states of bismuth and vanadate. The strong interaction of the doped W element with Bi, V, and O atoms has been reported previously, in support of the present results.10 Similarly, RGO sheets also interact with the atoms of BiVO4 at the surface, thus resulting in the shifts toward higher binding energies. Despite the weak intensities of the W 4f peaks, an apparent shift of W binding energy could be observed after RGO modification. This demonstrates the electronic interaction between deposited RGO and doped atoms. Additionally, in the C 1s XPS spectrum of GO (Fig. S3, ESI†), three main functional groups of carbon are observed: C–C bonds (284.8 eV), C–O bonds (286.9 eV) and CO bonds (288.8 eV).36 After photoreduction, the peak intensity of C–O bonds in RGO decreases significantly compared with that of GO, indicating the efficient removal of surface oxygen-containing functional groups.38,39

The XRD patterns also give evidence for the existence of GO and RGO composited with BiVO4 and W-BiVO4. All the samples show a highly crystalline monoclinic scheelite structure of BiVO4 with characteristic peaks at 18.8°, 28.8°, 30.5°, corresponding well with the standard JCPDS card no. 14-0688. Although no peaks for a tungsten impurity could be found in the XRD pattern, the incorporation of tungsten and RGO was confirmed by the combination of XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Obvious deviations of the diffraction peaks can be found due to tungsten incorporation and RGO loading. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, a peak shift towards lower angle degrees at 28.8° was observed which could be due to the larger ion radius of tungsten. Since too much tungsten incorporation might lead to the destruction of the crystal structure8,40 and reduce the performance, a relatively small amount, 3%, was chosen for doping. Moreover, owing to the trace amount of RGO loading during the experiment no direct XRD peak assignable to RGO could be found. However, its existence was verified by the corresponding deviation of the BiVO4 XRD patterns. After RGO modification (BiVO4/RGO), the corresponding peaks of monoclinic BiVO4 at 18.8°, 28.8° and 30.5° shifted to higher angles slightly. For W-BiVO4/RGO, the corresponding peak positions were higher than those of W-BiVO4 but lower than those of BiVO4/RGO, located close to those of BiVO4. The shifts in the XRD patterns of BiVO4 confirmed the successful implementation of the combined modification strategy and their interactions. In addition, when the amount of GO was increased by a factor of 10, the peaks of GO then appeared around 12–15°, which is direct evidence for its existence (shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). After photoreduction in ethanol under Xe lamp irradiation, the characteristic peaks of GO disappeared, indicating the successful transformation toward RGO. The successful deposition of GO and transformation toward RGO was also observed in W-BiVO4. These results suggest that this facile RGO surface modification method is a feasible, versatile method and can be applied to other semiconductor based photoanode systems.

Raman spectroscopy was also performed to confirm the effectiveness of the photoreduction process, tungsten doping and RGO surface modification. For all of the different treatments, as shown in Fig. 5b and c, the D band and G band peaks of graphene were obviously located at ∼1350 cm−1 and ∼1600 cm−1 respectively with a slight shift from the typical positions and a change of the typical D/G intensity ratios. After photoreduction, the D and G band peak positions of all of the samples shifted toward lower wavenumbers and the D/G intensity ratios increased slightly (0.982 to 0.991 and 0.952 to 1.006, respectively), which indicated that the GO sheets incorporated with the BiVO4 and W-BiVO4 nanoparticles were successfully reduced to RGO sheets. Furthermore, the down-shift in wavenumbers of the Raman peaks also implies a desirable connection between the RGO sheets and semiconductor nanoparticles. The typical vibration bands of BiVO4 were observed around 210 cm−1, 323 cm−1, 364 cm−1, 710 cm−1 and 824 cm−1 for all samples shown in Fig. 5a, which are assigned to the external mode (rotation/translation), the asymmetric and symmetric deformation modes and the stretching modes of two different types of V–O bonds that exist in BiVO4, respectively.41,42 Both of the Raman bands of BiVO4/RGO and W-BiVO4 shifted to lower wavenumbers compared with those of pure BiVO4 while the Raman bands of W-BiVO4/RGO shifted to even lower values. These shifts are attributed to the impact of tungsten doping and RGO modification on the local structure of BiVO4. For example, the incorporation of tungsten in the bulk leads to the partial substitution of vanadate, so the vibrational bands of the bonds might change correspondingly.43 The RGO sheets embedded on the surface of BiVO4 interact with the bonds and lead to a decrease of the symmetry of the BiVO4 grains. Similar Raman shifts of BiVO4 have been ascribed to certain functional relationships between the V–O bond length and the Raman wavenumbers.41 The red-shift of the Raman peak at around 824 cm−1 for samples with tungsten doping or RGO surface modification might be due to an increase in the V–O bond length. For W doping, the XRD peaks shifted to lower angles due to the larger ionic radius of W, which is consistent with the Raman results. However, for RGO modification, the XRD peaks shifted to higher angles while the V–O bond length increased. This could be explained by the different structural variations between W doping and graphene surface modification. For W doping, a small amount of W with a larger ionic radius substituted V in the V–O bond, resulting in an increase of the V–O bond length and the lattice spacing. For RGO modification, RGO affected both the V–O bond and the Bi–O bond simultaneously. The Bi–O bond length might decrease after RGO modification, although the Bi–O bond information could not be obtained from Raman spectroscopy, unfortunately. The reverse change in the Bi–O bond might exert a more significant influence on the crystal structure.41 Thus the XRD peak shifted to a higher angle after RGO modification although the V–O bond length increased.

PEC measurement under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight illumination in a three-electrode system has been carried out to understand the effect of tungsten doping and RGO surface modification on the performance of a BiVO4 film for water oxidation. Negligible dark currents were observed for all samples in the potential range of −0.2 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which embodied the stability of the photoanodes. The photocurrent curve of pure BiVO4 increased linearly with an increasing applied potential in the scanned potential range and no saturate tendency for the photocurrent was observed, which revealed ineffective charge separation and low charge mobility in pure BiVO4. The noteworthy spikes at the beginning of light illumination should be attributed to excess charge carrier accumulation caused by slow surface kinetics or the oxidation of surface states.16 It was found that the photocurrent of BiVO4 film increased significantly from 0.16 mA cm−2 to 0.38 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl after RGO treatment (Fig. 6). Tungsten doping also promoted the photoactivity of BiVO4 substantially owing to the improved electronic conductivity and charge carrier density. BiVO4/RGO showed higher photocurrents compared with those of W-BiVO4 at applied potentials lower than 0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while a lower photocurrent was observed when the applied potential was more positive than 0.95 V. This could be understood according to their different promotion mechanisms. Tungsten doping mainly contributed to an increase in donor density and improvement of hole transport in the bulk other than surface charge transfer. When applied with a positive bias, the charge separation and transportation of the photoanode would be improved. As for BiVO4/RGO, the improvement of photocurrent at a low bias potential can be attributed to favorable charge transfer at the surface due to the graphene modification. However, the low donor density and inefficient charge transport in the bulk remain unchanged so the photocurrent didn't increase much, even at a high bias potential. Therefore, combination of the two strategies becomes a reasonable strategic modification for optimal PEC performance. The strategically modified W-BiVO4/RGO shows an impressive highest photocurrent of 1.39 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 3.96 times higher than that of pure BiVO4 and much higher than even the sum of W-BiVO4 and BiVO4/RGO (Table 1). This result verified the synergistic effect of tungsten doping and RGO surface modification on the PEC performance. The donor density and bulk charge transport were improved via tungsten doping while the graphene modification promoted the surface charge transfer simultaneously, breaking the bottleneck effect during the photoelectrochemical process. It is noteworthy that the photocurrent onset potential of W-BiVO4/RGO also shifted from ∼−0.1 V to ∼−0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The cathodic shift of the onset potential is often shown in cocatalyst modified photoanodes.13 Herein we attribute this shift to the successful suppression of charge recombination instead of a cocatalysis effect.

In order to understand the mechanism of the enhancement in the modified system, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were further employed to provide details of the electrochemical properties. Flat band potentials and charge carrier densities could be inferred from Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation:1/C2 = (2/εε0eNd)[(V − Vfb) − kT/e]where C is the capacitance of space charge layers, e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, Nd is the carrier density in cm−3, V is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in K.44 From the equation, the flat band potential is determined from the x-intercept of the tangent line and the carrier density can be calculated from the slope of the linear part of the M–S plots, as shown in Fig. 7. From the plots and the calculated results, it was found that pure BiVO4 had a low charge carrier density while after RGO modification the concentration was greatly increased by a factor of three compared to those of the pure ones. Incorporation of tungsten increased the concentration even more significantly as tungsten was directly doped into the BiVO4. After RGO loading on W-BiVO4, the concentration was further enhanced to approximately 18 times that of pure BiVO4. The increase in donor density for BiVO4/RGO was slightly increased compared to that of pure BiVO4 but remained relatively low, and thus the amplitude of the photocurrent enhancement was not remarkable. This was ascribed to poor electron transport in the bulk and a relatively low concentration of charge carriers in BiVO4, which could be optimized via bulk doping. The charge carrier concentration of W-BiVO4 was much higher than that of BiVO4 and BiVO4/RGO yet the photocurrent was lower than that of BiVO4/RGO, indicating that solely increasing the charge carrier density through doping is not sufficient for efficient water oxidization. Meanwhile an enhancement of surface charge transfer using RGO surface modification could also be required in an efficient PEC water splitting system. W-BiVO4/RGO with both modifications had the highest donor density as well as the highest PEC performance. In general, tungsten doping could lead to an increase in carrier density, enhance the bulk electronic conductivity and raise the Fermi level of BiVO4 which is beneficial for a better PEC performance. RGO surface loading could also increase the charge carrier density, and improve the surface electron transport/transfer which may play a crucial role in PEC water splitting. A drastic quenching of photoluminescence (PL) intensity of BiVO4 was observed after W doping and RGO surface modification (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers in the modified photoanodes is greatly enhanced, which is consistent with the M–S and EIS results. The Mott–Schottky plots revealed flat band potentials of approximately −0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl for pure BiVO4 and −0.53 V vs. Ag/AgCl for W-BiVO4 in this work, which is consistent with previous reports.4,8,45 However, the onset of the photocurrents was found to be much more positive than the flat band potentials due to severe surface recombination caused by the slow kinetics of the water oxidation reaction. After RGO modification, positive shifts of the EFB of BiVO4 and W-BiVO4 were observed, which might be the result of the change in the surface electronic structures.46

Due to the large surface areas and high carrier densities in the doped and surface modified BiVO4 photoanodes, the capacitance of the space charge region can be the same order of magnitude as the Helmholtz capacitance hence CH cannot be neglected. Therefore, an equivalent circuit consisting of two RQ elements in series was chosen to fit the impedance data. In the equivalent circuit, RS represents the solution resistance; Q is the constant phase element (CPE) and the two RQ elements in series account for the semiconductor and surface processes respectively. Since the charge transport and transfer process is normally much faster in the bulk than that at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, the low frequency response was assigned to the semiconductor–electrolyte charge transfer behavior (RCT and QH) while the high frequency response was accordingly designated to the behavior in the semiconductor bulk (RSC and QSC). The simulated results of the equivalent circuit of two RQ in series can fit the Nyquist plots very well. The fitted values of RSC for BiVO4, BiVO4/RGO, W-BiVO4 and W-BiVO4/RGO were 1299, 790, 348 and 85.7 Ω cm−2, respectively, while the fitted values of RCT for them were 7438, 2658, 1359 and 618 Ω cm−2, respectively. The decreasing resistances of both semiconductor–electrolyte charge transfer and the space charge region indicated the improved charge transfer in the PEC water splitting circuit which is beneficial for faster kinetics and thus higher efficiency (Fig. 8). Although the resistance values may not be precise for the actual process, it is reasonable to compare the relative values qualitatively. From the fitted resistance values, we discovered that the charge transfer characteristics of BiVO4 were relatively poor and both tungsten doping and RGO surface modification dramatically decreased the resistance. As a result of the combined modification, W-BiVO4/RGO had the lowest resistances which were both less than 1/10 of that for pure BiVO4. The tiny amount of RGO acted as a charge transfer mediator from the space charge region to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, which resulted in a decrease of both RSC and RCT. As mentioned previously, charge transfer across the semiconductor–electrolyte interface is normally slower than that in the bulk, thus the improvement of the former component is of much more importance. Detailed comparisons of the important parameters in PEC reactions were listed in Table 1. The synergistic effect of the modifications for both bulk and the semiconductor–electrolyte interface resulted in longer charge carrier lifetimes and reduced photogenerated electron–hole recombination. Thus, more holes from the valence band reached the semiconductor–electrolyte interface for use in water oxidation reactions. It is noteworthy that loading of oxygen evolution cocatalysts is normally an effective method to improve the semiconductor–electrolyte interface kinetics, which might be a strategy for further performance improvement.

Fig. 9 shows the IPCE data. The IPCE values were calculated by the equation:IPCE = (1240I)/(λP),where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light and P is the power intensity of the light. Regardless of RGO modification and tungsten doping, all the films has approximately the same light absorption edge at ∼520 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating that the modifications scarcely affect light absorption. All the samples showed substantial visible light responses in almost the same regions in accordance with the UV-vis spectra. For pure BiVO4, a photocurrent onset at ∼520 nm is observed and the IPCE value reaches 3.7% at 450 nm. Individual modification via doping or RGO treatment both increased the IPCE by an average factor of ∼2.5 owing to the different modification mechanisms. Via the combined modification, W-BiVO4/RGO shows the highest IPCE of 17.6% at 450 nm, owing to its possession of the highest carrier concentration and optimal charge transport and transfer properties. The IPCE data agree well with the photocurrent results and verify again the synergistic effect between bulk doping and surface modification.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a combined design strategy of tungsten doping and surface modification with RGO for BiVO4 was adopted and examined to effectively promote the charge transport and transfer for BiVO4 in the PEC water oxidation process. The photocurrent of the strategically modified W-BiVO4/RGO increases 3.96 times compared with that of pure BiVO4 (0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The EIS measurements show the remarkable increase in donor density and the decrease of the charge transport and transfer resistances. Thus, we have demonstrated the strategy of simultaneous modifications for charge transport and separation processes in the bulk and at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, which show a synergistic effect on the enhancement of PEC performance. The results provide beneficial insight for the construction of strategically modified photoanodes for use in PEC water splitting.
