    , Accepted 8th March 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractThe oxidation process of SO32− to final SO42− is commonly required in existing desulphurization technologies. The resulting SO32− is usually purged with air for oxidation before disposal. The energy of SO32− to SO42− is wasted in this process. Herein, we report simultaneous H2 production with the removal of poisonous SO2via a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting process based on a nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode. The enhancement of H2 production is attributed to the lower activation energy and faster kinetics of SO32− oxidation compared with direct oxidation of water on the photoanode. The enhancement factor is significantly higher on the nanoporous film than on the non-porous film. The removal rate of SO2 is higher than 97%, and the absorbed SO2 is used to produce hydrogen. A H2 evolution rate of 29.8 μmol h−1 cm−2 on the nanoporous BiVO4, with a high Faradaic efficiency, is obtained with removal of SO2, which is much faster than that without SO2 removal (0.22 μmol h−1 cm−2). This work provides a new method for SO2 removal with simultaneous H2 production. The proposed method can be used either in processes involving NaOH as a desulfurization absorber, or combined with existing desulfurization technologies, such as the ammonia-based desulfurization method.

Environmental significance
In a conventional method for SO2 removal, the resulting SO32− is usually purged with air for oxidation before disposal. The energy of SO32− is wasted in this process. Herein, we present that solar-to-H2 energy conversion efficiency can be greatly improved with the simultaneous removal of poisonous SO2via a photoelectrochemical water splitting process based on nanoporous BiVO4, since SO32− possesses lower activation energy and exhibits faster kinetics compared with the direct oxidation of water on the photoanode. This work for the first time demonstrates that the energy of Na2SO3 wasted in conventional SO2 removal technology can be utilized for H2 production, which provides an economical option and a green method for SO2 removal from flue gas.

Introduction
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted from petroleum refineries, fossil fuel burning and chemical industries is one of the most important air pollutants. As one of the acid gases, SO2 could form sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere and lead to acid deposition. Therefore, SO2 can cause a wide range of issues from human health and agriculture to global climate, such as acid rain, haze and the formation of PM2.5.1–5 Till now, many technologies have been applied to deal with SO2, including absorption6–14 and reduction methods.15,16 Among these technologies, wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) has been one of the state-of-the-art technologies for absorption of SO2 with high efficiency, using simple equipment and producing multi-use by-products.4,15,17,18 However, some inevitable drawbacks of WFGD technologies still exist, such as the high cost, consumption of vast amounts of water, block, and especially the waste of energy during the treatment of SO32− to the final SO42−.8,12,19,20
In most cases, a base is first utilized to absorb SO2 from flue gas, which results in the formation of SO32−. The resulting SO32− is then purged with air for oxidation before disposal. Therefore, the transformation energy of SO32− to SO42− is wasted during the process. It is thus proposed that the oxidation of SO32− can be carried out for the production of clean and green hydrogen fuel. The amount of SO2 generated from the production of electricity (1 kW h) from a coal power plant is around 0.03 kg (0.47 mol). If this SO2 can be used to produce H2, for 1 kW h of electricity generated, around 10 L of H2 can be produced. Huang et al.8 reported hydrogen production via direct photolytic oxidation of aqueous Na2SO3 solutions under ultraviolet (UV) illumination. However, this process can only be performed under UV light illumination, which limits its practical application. Recently, solar water splitting has been widely studied as a promising, attractive and pollution-free approach to produce H2 fuel.21–34 Nevertheless, this method frequently shows low efficiency because of the accumulation of four electrons for water oxidation to form O2.24,35–37 Considering the oxidation of SO2 is kinetically and thermodynamically much easier than water oxidation, it is thus of great interest to perform solar-to-H2 energy conversion with the removal of poisonous SO2via a solar water splitting process. In solar water splitting, the product O2 is also not of significant value. We propose to replace the O2 evolution reaction with a thermodynamically more favorable reaction, the oxidation of SO2, which is a pollutant abundant in flue gas. Although Na2SO3 has been employed as a sacrificing reagent (SR) for the study of charge carrier behavior during solar water splitting,38 it has not yet been investigated from the viewpoint of SO2 removal. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), with a narrow band gap of 2.4 eV and a broad response in visible light, has been considered as one of the most promising candidate photoanodes for water splitting due to its stability and high oxidation ability.22,23,39–43 Herein, we report a novel method for SO2 removal with simultaneous, enhanced H2 generation via a PEC process based on nanoporous BiVO4. The method is shown in Scheme 1, wherein a two-electrode configuration was employed with a Pt wire as the counter electrode, nanoporous BiVO4 as the working electrode and NaOH as the electrolyte. SO2 is absorbed by NaOH with formation of Na2SO3, which is then oxidized on the photoanode, and H2 is generated on the cathode during the PEC process.

Results and discussion
The microstructure of the nanoporous BiVO4 film was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1a. The film of BiVO4 is mainly composed of nanoparticles with diameters of around 200 nm. The nanoporous structure of the BiVO4 film is clearly observed. The sizes of the pores are approximately from 20 nm to 100 nm. The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1b) shows an inter-planar distance of 0.224 nm, which is related to the (112) plane of BiVO4. The thickness of the nanoporous BiVO4 film is investigated by means of a cross sectional SEM image, which shows that the film has a thickness of approximately 150 nm. In good agreement with this result, the Auger electron spectra (AES) reveal that the film thickness is 147.8 nm (Fig. 1c).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to investigate the chemical composition and crystal structure of the photoelectrode. Fig. 1d presents the XRD spectra of BiVO4 and bare FTO. It is clear that the diffraction peaks of the synthesized BiVO4 were highly consistent with the characteristic peaks of the scheelite monoclinic phase (JCPDS no. 14-0688). In addition, the sharp peaks of BiVO4 indicate that it has good crystallinity. Besides, due to the highly porous structure and the thin thickness of the BiVO4 film, the diffraction peaks of FTO are also observed.
UV-vis diffraction reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was performed to characterize the optical properties of the as-prepared nanoporous BiVO4 electrode. As shown in Fig. 1e, three broad absorption bands of the BiVO4 electrode were observed at wavelengths of 200–350 nm, 350–450 nm, and 450–500 nm, respectively. It is shown that the BiVO4 electrode has a strong absorption in the visible light region (λ > 420 nm). The band gap of the BiVO4 electrode calculated from the Tauc plot is 2.53 eV (Fig. 1f), which is consistent with the reported band gap of BiVO4.22
The PEC performances were investigated both in the dark and under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in NaOH solutions after absorbing SO2 gas of different concentrations. In this system, a conventional three-electrode configuration is employed with BiVO4 on FTO as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode, respectively. Fig. 2a displays the photocurrent density–bias voltage (J–V) curves of BiVO4 in the dark and under illumination in different electrolyte solutions after absorbing SO2. SO2 at different concentrations of 500 ppm, 1000 ppm and 1500 ppm was successively bubbled into NaOH solutions, forming electrolyte solutions of 0.1 M NaOH–0.025 M Na2SO3 (denoted as NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-1), 0.1 M NaOH–0.050 M Na2SO3 (denoted as NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-2), and 0.1 M NaOH–0.075 M Na2SO3 (denoted as NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-3), respectively. Different initial concentrations of NaOH are used so that electrolyte solutions with similar concentrations of NaOH can be obtained after absorbing SO2, allowing a comparison of photocurrents. The concentration of obtained SO32− in different solutions was detected by ion chromatography, and the reaction conditions and resulting solutions are listed in Table 1. In all cases, the removal rate of SO2 is found to be higher than 97%. We observe that the current densities are negligible under dark conditions at applied biases lower than 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO in different electrolyte solutions. We also observe that the photocurrent densities greatly depend on the concentration of Na2SO3 in the electrolyte solution. As displayed in Fig. 2a, NaOH(aq) shows the lowest photocurrent density.

However, after the inletting of SO2 gas into NaOH(aq), not only the concentration of Na2SO3 was increased but also the photocurrent density is significantly enhanced at the applied bias from −0.5 V to 1.0 V vs. Hg/HgO. The results of the J–V curves indicated that the photocurrent density is evidently enhanced due to absorption of SO2 in the electrolyte solution. The J–V curve of porous BiVO4 in NaOH(aq) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) is also studied and is shown in Fig. S1.† The electrode does show an ability to respond to visible light due to its large band gap, though lower than that in the whole irradiation range, as expected. As our BiVO4 film is thin and no doping or co-catalyst is used, the photocurrent density is lower than the result of a previously published work on BiVO4 with Na2SO3 as a sacrificial reagent for solar water splitting.44 However, our nanoporous BiVO4 film exhibits an outstanding performance compared to those of previous works on pristine BiVO4.23,45–48
In order to further investigate the influence of SO2, the change of photocurrent density is studied by in situ increasing the Na2SO3 concentration in the electrolyte solution. Fig. 2b displays the results of chronoamperometric testing at a constant potential of 0 V vs. Hg/HgO with addition of Na2SO3 into the electrolyte solution. The photocurrent density of the electrode in the initial electrolyte solution (NaOH(aq), 0.1 M) gradually decreases from 0.019 to 0.015 mA cm−2, and then becomes steady at 10 min. After injecting 1 ml of Na2SO3 saturated solution into the PEC reactor (35 ml), the concentration of the resulting electrolyte solution will be 0.025 M Na2SO3–0.1 M NaOH. From Fig. 2b, we observe an instantaneous increase of the photocurrent after injecting Na2SO3 solution, which becomes steady after 10 min. When another 1 ml of Na2SO3 saturated solution was injected, the photocurrent density increased instantaneously again, while the concentration of Na2SO3 is around 0.05 M Na2SO3 in this case. A further improved photocurrent density is observed when the concentration of Na2SO3 reached 0.075 M, though the enhancement is not as high as in the former two steps of Na2SO3 injection. Notably, the photocurrent density is lower than the values shown in Fig. 2a, which may be attributed to the continuous consumption of Na2SO3 during the test. However, the above result indicates that Na2SO3 is directly responsible for the enhancement of photocurrent due to its low activation energy and fast kinetics.40,49
To investigate the advantage of a nanoporous structure for SO2 removal and H2 production, a planar BiVO4 film without a porous structure was also prepared and studied for comparison. Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of nanoporous and non-porous BiVO4 photoanodes under chopped illumination with or without SO2 removal. For both electrodes, back-side illumination produces higher photocurrent than front-side illumination, which has been reported to be related to the poor electron transport in BiVO4 (see the ESI† for details), so in this work the light irradiates from the back-side, if not noted otherwise. It is observed that the nanoporous BiVO4 shows much higher photocurrent response, suggesting much faster SO2 removal and H2 generation rates than those of planar BiVO4 without a porous structure. In BiVO4, as displayed in the inset of Fig. 3, the BiVO4 crystal is composed of non-interconnecting VO4 tetrahedra. The conduction band of BiVO4 consists mainly of V 3d orbitals, and, consequently, the photogenerated electrons have to hop between the VO4 tetrahedra in BiVO4. As a consequence, the charge transport in BiVO4 is not efficient; doping or co-catalysts are commonly employed to improve the activity of BiVO4. In this work, as the photogenerated holes can be quickly scavenged by SO32− produced from SO2 removal, the charge carrier separation on the surface can be greatly enhanced, especially for the nanoporous structure, which has a higher surface area and a higher rate of surface recombination than planar BiVO4. Therefore, with the SO2 removal, the nanoporous BiVO4 shows better performance, possessing an enhancement factor of ∼10 compared with that without SO2 removal at 0.2 V, while the enhancement factor is only ∼2 for the non-porous BiVO4. Additionally, the nanoporous structure can significantly reduce the path length required for the charge carriers to diffuse to the surface, thus suppressing the charge carrier recombination. The reproducibility of the nanoporous film is studied and the results are provided in Fig. S3 in the ESI;† the similarity in the J–V curves of the samples confirms the reproducibility of the fabrication method.

The processes of electrochemical reactions with or without SO2 are compared to understand the improved photocurrent response. As shown in Fig. 4, under illumination by solar light, the semiconductor BiVO4 film is excited to produce an electron (e−) from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and create a hole (h+) in the VB. With the help of an external bias, the photogenerated carriers could migrate to the cathode electrode (Pt wire) where electrons (e−) can reduce water to produce H2, while the holes (h+) will participate in the oxidation reaction. In the case of pure NaOH(aq) as the electrolyte solution, the half reaction on the photoanode is (Fig. 4a):2OH− → O2(g) + 2H+ + 4e− 1.23 V vs. RHEwhile in the existence of SO2 removal, the half reaction on the photoanode is (Fig. 4b):SO32− + 2OH− → SO42− + H2O + 2e− 0.92 V vs.RHE
Since SO32− has a much lower activation energy and only 2 electrons are needed for the oxidation reaction, it is thus expected that the photogenerated holes will be instantaneously consumed by Na2SO3, and a higher photocurrent is generated as a consequence. Whereas, in the case of water oxidation, the reaction is much slower because of its higher activation energy and 4 electrons are required; the photocurrent thus suffers from quick recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Transient photocurrent measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out to preliminarily evaluate the charge carrier recombination and kinetics of charge transfer behavior on the interface of BiVO4 in different solutions (Fig. 5). The transient photocurrent occurring upon illumination and under dark conditions was studied at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Hg/HgO (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5a, the electrode in different electrolyte solutions presents fast and uniform photocurrent responses while the light is switched on or off. Besides, the phenomenon of the photoresponse is reversible. It is well known that the generated transient anodic photocurrent wave when the chopped light is switched on represents the accumulation of holes at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Meanwhile, the generated transient cathodic photocurrent wave when the chopped light is switched off represents the back reaction of electrons from the conduction band with the accumulated holes.50 A more serious recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is clearly observed in the case of NaOH as the electrolyte in Fig. 5a, which shows a high photocurrent spike when light is switched on or off, suggesting that the separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs is greatly improved with the existence of Na2SO3 formed by the removal of SO2. EIS was then carried out to investigate the interface charge transfer resistance. Fig. 5b shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the nanoporous BiVO4 film in different SO2 removal solutions under light illumination. The diameter of the arc radius in the Nyquist plot illustrates the charge-transfer resistance of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. Therefore, a smaller arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot reflects a more efficient charge transfer occurring at the electrode–solution interface. As seen in Fig. 5b, NaOH(aq) showed the biggest arc radius compared to other solutions with SO2 removal, suggesting that SO2 removal could significantly reduce the charge-transfer resistance at the BiVO4 and electrolyte solution interface. The above results indicate that the SO2 removal could dramatically enhance the separation and transfer efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and improve the H2 production.

The amounts of evolved H2 in different electrolyte solutions were measured in a two-electrode system at a bias of 1.6 V under AM 1.5 G irradiation (simulated solar light). Fig. 6a and b exhibit the amounts of H2 evolved theoretically vs. the amounts of H2 evolved experimentally with/without removal of SO2 and the corresponding amperometric i–t curves, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, a stable H2 evolution with a rate of 29.8 μmol h−1 cm−2 is obtained in NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-3, while the H2 evolution rate is only 0.22 μmol h−1 cm−2 in NaOH(aq), suggesting that H2 production can be dramatically enhanced by more than a hundred times with the removal of SO2. The relevant reactions during the removal of SO2 with simultaneous H2 generation are as follows:

Additionally, the measured H2 evolution rates are close to the theoretical values calculated based on the photocurrent density, indicating a high Faradaic efficiency.
The photocurrent densities, theoretical evolution rates of H2, experimental evolution rates of H2 and the Faradaic efficiencies in different electrolyte solutions are thus summarized and provided in Table 2. It is shown that without the absorption of SO2 (only NaOH as electrolyte solution), the photocurrent density and the experimental evolution rate of H2 are the lowest. After the absorption of SO2, a slight increase in the concentration of Na2SO3 can significantly enhance the H2 production. The experimental evolution rates of H2 are 0.22 μmol h−1 cm−2, 2.7 μmol h−1 cm−2, 27 μmol h−1 cm−2 and 29.8 μmol h−1 cm−2 for NaOH(aq), NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-1, NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-2 and NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-3, respectively. These results indicate that the generated Na2SO3 during SO2 removal could significantly improve the solar-to-H2 energy conversion. Additionally, as the BiVO4 film is thin and no doping or co-catalyst is used, improvement is possible to further increase the photocurrent densities and evolution rates of H2. Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency of H2 production is more than 96% (Table 2), suggesting that nearly all the generated electrons are consumed by the production of H2. The stability of this system is confirmed by the photocurrent density vs. time curves, which show hardly any decrease in 3 hours of the H2 production experiment (Fig. 6b) with BiVO4 as the photoelectrocatalytic material. The high stability of BiVO4 as a photoanode is also reported in the literature.22 The results confirm that the energy of SO32− wasted in conventional SO2 removal technology can be utilized in the process of solar-to-H2 energy conversion, which provides an alternative option when considering the removal of SO2 from flue gas. In a photoelectrochemical system, the photocurrent density greatly depends on the value of bias voltage. In Fig. 2, the photocurrent density in the three-electrode photoelectrochemical system (NaOH(aq) + SO2(g)-3) is low because a low bias voltage is employed; however, we can see exponentially increased photocurrents when the potential applied is higher than 0.5 V. Therefore, we can simply tune the system by changing the voltage to deal with different flue gas with various concentrations of SO2.

The pH values of the electrolyte solutions during the PEC process with or without SO2 removal are monitored and shown in Fig. 6c. As expected, the PEC process with SO2 removal shows a faster pH decrease rate, which is attributed to the OH− consumption during the SO2 absorption and H2 production, based on the total reaction (eqn 5). In order to detect whether there are S or other elements deposited on the surface during SO2 removal, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the electrodes before and after catalysis was conducted (Fig. 6d). Hardly any change in the XPS can be observed, indicating there are no S or any other elements deposited on the surface during the PEC process.
In real flue gas, CO2, H2S etc. are also important components. We thus studied the influence of CO2 by mixing it with SO2 (2:1); however, hardly any change is observed in the photocurrent density, indicating that the existence of CO2 does not affect SO2 removal and H2 production at this mixing ratio of CO2. The reason is that NaOH solution could react with CO2 from flue gas to form sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which can further absorb SO2 and then produce Na2SO3. The resulting Na2SO3 is then utilized to produce H2 in the PEC process (similar to Fig. 4b). Therefore, the existence of a low concentration of CO2 does not affect the production of H2 and desulfurization. The relevant reactions are as follows: 2NaOH(aq) + CO2(g) → Na2CO3(aq) + H2O(6) 2Na2CO3(aq) + SO2(g) + H2O → 2NaHCO3(aq) + Na2SO3(aq)(7) 2NaHCO3(aq) + SO2(g) → Na2SO3(aq) + H2O + 2CO2(g)↑(8)
In practice, the CO2 concentration is much higher; our further experiment with a high concentration of CO2 in the gas shows that CO2 can also be reduced on the cathode, and production of HCOOH is observed in the liquid phase, as measured by GC (see the ESI,† Fig. S4). H2 production is thus decreased because of the reduction of CO2. However, the SO2 removal rate is still higher than 97%. Another research work on the simultaneous removal of SO2 and reduction of CO2 is under way in our lab. Besides, H2S could react with NaOH to form Na2S, since Na2S is also an efficient sacrificing reagent (SR) for producing H2 in the solar water splitting process.38 Thus, the proposed method can also remove H2S with simultaneous H2 production. While HCl could react with NaOH to form NaCl, the existence of NaCl will not affect the H2 production. The existence of HCl will consume NaOH, which may increase the consumption of NaOH, but as a result, HCl can also be removed through this process.
Regarding the use of this technology in a real case of desulfurization in a power plant, it can be used either in processes involving NaOH as a desulfurization absorber, or combined with existing WFGD processes, such as the ammonia-based desulfurization method. Due to the expensive price of NaOH, it is not a popular desulfurization absorber, although its desulfurization efficiency is very high (>97%). In this work, the energy of SO2 is used to produce the high-value-added product H2, which can greatly reduce the cost of NaOH. As we know, the price of 1 mol H2 is almost 30 times more valuable than 1 mol NaOH (value from the Internet). Herein, a consumption of 2 mol NaOH will produce 1 mol H2 based on the total reaction. Furthermore, the energy input in this PEC process is mainly from solar light. The small external bias can be provided by a solar cell or by replacing the Pt cathode with a p-type semiconductor as a photocathode. By the proposed process, simultaneous production of H2 may make NaOH a suitable desulfurization absorber. Alternatively, our method can also be combined with the existing ammonia-based desulfurization technology, which includes an (NH4)2SO3 aeration step to form (NH4)2SO4. We can use this simultaneous H2 generation method to replace the aeration process without changing the ammonia-based desulfurization technology, so that the energy of (NH4)2SO3 is recycled to produce H2 rather than wasted. Via the proposed process, the SO2 released from coal power plants can be used to produce H2, wherein for 1 kW h of electricity generated, around 10 L of H2 can be produced.
Conclusions
In summary, a new method for the removal of SO2 and simultaneous, improved solar-to-H2 energy conversion based on nanoporous BiVO4 is proposed. Through this approach, the wasted energy of SO2 in a conventional desulfurization process is recycled and used to produce H2. The PEC production of H2 is significantly improved with the existence of Na2SO3 (generated during SO2 removal) due to its lower activation energy and faster kinetics. The removal rate of SO2 is higher than 97% in this proposed PEC method. The nanoporous BiVO4 shows much higher SO2 removal and H2 production rates than the non-porous film due to its higher surface area and reduced charge carrier transportation length. This work for the first time demonstrates that the energy of SO32− wasted in conventional SO2 removal technology can be utilized in the process of solar-to-H2 energy conversion, which provides a new option when considering the removal of SO2 from flue gas.
Experimental
Synthesis
Fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glasses (thickness, 1 mm) were purchased from China Southern Glass Co. Ltd. All chemical reagents are analytical grade and used without any further purification. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the whole experiment.
The FTO glasses were sonicated by immersing in acetone, ethanol and DI water in sequence to remove the impurities on the surface. The nanoporous BiVO4/FTO was synthesized by drop coating a BiVO4 precursor solution onto the conducting side of the FTO. In a typical procedure, 0.5 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.5 mmol NH4VO3 were dissolved in a mixture of 5 ml nitric acid and 5 ml DI water. After the solute was dissolved, 10 ml of ethanol was added to dilute the mixture. Then the BiVO4 precursor of calculated volume was dripped onto the surface of FTO with a pipette. After being dried at 60 °C in an oven, the films were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1. A non-porous BiVO4 film was prepared for comparison by repeating the above process twice to get rid of the pores in the deposited film.
Characterization
The microstructure of the as-prepared electrode was characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and field emission high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, PHILIPS CM200FEG). The crystal structure of the as-prepared electrode was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained by means of a Bruker instrument with Cu Kα radiation ranging from 10° to 70°. The UV-vis spectrum of the as-prepared electrode was obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2600) with an integrating sphere attachment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer PHI-5000C ESCA system equipped with a dual X-ray source, using a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) anode and a hemispherical energy analyzer.
PEC tests
The PEC measurements were performed using a potentiostat (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua Co. Ltd. China). For the PEC tests, a standard three electrode configuration was employed, with BiVO4 as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. The electrolyte solutions of the PEC experiments were prepared by the reaction of SO2 with NaOH solution. SO2 at different concentrations of 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 1500 ppm was successively bubbled into the corresponding NaOH solutions with a flow rate of 100 ml min−1 (abundant reaction) for 21.3 min. Then the SO2 was made to react with NaOH solution to form a specific amount of Na2SO3, and the resulting concentrations of the solutions are 0.025 M Na2SO3–0.1 M NaOH, 0.050 M Na2SO3–0.1 M NaOH, and 0.075 M Na2SO3–0.1 M NaOH, respectively. For comparison, a 0.1 M NaOH solution was also prepared. The PEC characterization was carried out under illumination using a 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter (100 mW cm−2) from the back side of the film (FTO side). The potentials were swept at a rate of 10 mV s−1. The concentration of H2 was determined by gas chromatography (SHIMADZU, GC-2014) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The pH value of the solutions during the PEC tests was measured by using Ohaus (STARTER 2100). The amounts of evolved H2 were measured in the two-electrode system at 1.6 V under AM 1.5 G irradiation in a 500 ml reactor filled with 300 ml of the electrolyte solution. The theoretical evolution rate of H2 is calculated according to the following equation:  where v indicates the evolution rate of H2 (mol cm−2 h−1); I indicates the average current (A); t indicates the time (s); Z indicates the transferred electron number (1); F is Faraday's constant (96500 C mol−1); and A is the area of the BiVO4 film (cm−2).
The equation for the calculation of Faradaic efficiency is:  where m is the experimental value of H2 (mol); n is the reacted electron number (1); F is Faraday's constant (96500 C mol−1); I is the average current (A); and t is the time (s).

Environmental significance
In a conventional method for SO2 removal, the resulting SO32− is usually purged with air for oxidation before disposal. The energy of SO32− is wasted in this process. Herein, we present that solar-to-H2 energy conversion efficiency can be greatly improved with the simultaneous removal of poisonous SO2via a photoelectrochemical water splitting process based on nanoporous BiVO4, since SO32− possesses lower activation energy and exhibits faster kinetics compared with the direct oxidation of water on the photoanode. This work for the first time demonstrates that the energy of Na2SO3 wasted in conventional SO2 removal technology can be utilized for H2 production, which provides an economical option and a green method for SO2 removal from flue gas.
