    , Accepted 4th January 2012First published on 8th February 2012AbstractFe-doped TiO2 nanopowders with controlled molar-atomic ratios of iron to titanium oxide (in percentage) ranging from nominal 1 to 10% were synthesized by a new simple sol–gel method. Metallic Ag nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the nanopowder of the Fe-doped TiO2 surface by citrate reduction of AgNO3 in water/CH3CN mixture. The molar ratio of iron to TiO2, phase formation, bandgaps, crystallinity, catalytic and plasmonic properties of the resultant composites were systematically investigated using UV-visible spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, EDX, and photoluminescence spectral analyses. The photocatalytic activity of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 composite nanoclusters was evaluated through photocatalytic killing of cancer cells. For the photocatalytic killing of cancer cells under visible light irradiation, as-prepared Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanopowders exhibited higher activity than Fe-doped TiO2. The promoting effect of the Ag nanoparticles deposited on the Fe-doped TiO2 surface showed strong absorption in the visible region due to localized surface plasmon resonance of Ag and inhibited the recombination of photoelectrons and holes rather than only Fe-doped TiO2. The cytotoxic cell killing efficiency depends on the molar ratio of Fe content to TiO2. The optimum Fe content in Fe-doped TiO2 was determined to be 5% due to the Fe/TiO2 molar ratio. Based on the obtained results, a plausible mechanism was also proposed.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide is an indispensable compound in various applications such as a photocatalyst, solar cells for the production of hydrogen and electric energy, a gas sensor, a white pigment, a corrosion-protective coating, an optical coating, ceramics, electric devices, self-sterilizing and cleaning, etc. It has excellent and characteristic chemical, physical, optical and electric properties i.e., high chemical stability, non-toxicity, high thermal stability, redox properties and photoabsorption properties.1,2 As a widely used heterogeneous catalyst, TiO2 has been extensively studied in the field of surface science for last few decades. Current research on TiO2 is focused on its visible light-responsible photoelectric and photochemical properties. The initial work by Fujishima and Honda2,3 on the splitting of water into H2 and O2 on TiO2 electrodes under UV irradiation stimulated much of the early works on TiO2.4,5 Unfortunately, the quantum yield of TiO2 is too low for photochemical conversion of solar energy due to the easy recombination of photoelectrons and holes. However, pure TiO2 can be activated only by UV light absorption due to its energy gap (3.0–3.2 eV) and thus, only less than 5% solar light can be utilized. Many studies have been devoted to the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, such as deposition of noble metals,6–11 doping of metal or non-metal ions,12–16etc.
Doping of TiO2 is one of the promising ways to extend light absorption to the visible region. The doping of metal ions such as Pt4+, Ir4+, Rh3+, Au3+, Pd2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ into TiO2 directly influences the intrinsic properties of TiO2 and extends its catalytic photoresponse into the visible region.17 Among various dopants, the Fe3+-dopant is most frequently employed owing to its unique half-filled electronic configuration,18–20 which might narrow the energy gap through the formation of new intermediate energy levels and also diminish recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes by capturing photoelectrons. Therefore, to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2-based photocatalysis, the e−–h+ recombination rate must be reduced.
The deposition of a noble metal on semiconductor nanoparticles is an essential factor for maximizing the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.21 The noble metal (e.g., Ag) which acts as a sink for photoinduced charge carriers promotes interfacial charge-transfer processes. Composite semiconductor systems have also been shown to improve the photoconversion efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.22 Ag nanoparticles absorb visible light due to the surface plasmon absorption and the characteristic broad absorption band appears in the visible range. In an earlier study, we have shown that metal nanoparticles deposited on the TiO2 nanostructure undergo Fermi level equilibrium following the UV-visible light excitation and enhance the efficiency of charge-transfer processes with photocatalytic cancer cell killing activity.23–26
The transfer of electrons from the photoexcited Fe-doped TiO2 to the Ag metal is an important aspect that dictates the overall energetics of the composite and enhances the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction process. The capped Ag can effectively hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs, and the doped Fe can improve the visible light activity of TiO2. Due to the combined effect of the doped Fe and capped Ag, the photocatalytic activities of these Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites are tremendously enhanced under visible light illumination. We have developed a novel method for preparing the Ag-capped Fe-doped TiO2. Moreover, we report the effect of photocatalytic efficiency for cancer cell killing and the advantage of Ag nanoparticles as the promoter for the Fe-doped TiO2 photocatalyst. We found that the photocatalytic cancer cell killing of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 required only half of the irradiation time for Fe-doped TiO2 alone and that the killing efficiency of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 was more than two times higher than that of Fe-doped TiO2 at the same concentration. To the best of our knowledge, such a preparation method and the application for cancer cell killing have not been reported previously.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Titanium(IV)(triethanolaminato)-isopropoxide (N((CH2)2O)3TiOCH(CH3)2) (TTEAIP) (80 wt% solution in 2-propanol) was purchased from Aldrich. Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (99.9%) (Fe (NO3)3·9H2O), α-iron(III) oxide (99.9%) (Fe2O3), AgNO3 (99.8%) and sodium citrate (99.0%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Fe2O3 and TiO2 (self-made) were used only for a comparative study with Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2.
2.2 Preparation of Fe-doped TiO2 nanopowder
Fe-doped TiO2 nanopowder was prepared by hydrolysis through the sol–gel route using TTEAIP and ferric nitrate as precursors. Under constant stirring, 0.10 M (1 M = 1 mol dm−3) TTEAIP was added drop-wise to 60 vol% water–ethanol mixture. Then iron(III) nitrate ((Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) salt (0.001–0.01 M) was mixed in solution, maintaining the reaction mixture in suspension by magnetic stirring. The sol was obtained when the mixture was hydrolyzed at boiling temperature for 2 h with vigorous stirring. Then the gel was obtained by centrifugation of the sol at room temperature. The resulting gel was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h to remove the solvents and calcined at 350 °C in a muffle furnace for 2 h. Then the Fe-doped TiO2 powder was obtained. The calculated atomic ratios (in %) of Fe to TiO2 in the precursors were 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10%.
2.3 Preparation of TiO2 nanopowder
Synthesis of TiO2 nanopowders was carried out by changing temperature in the TTEAIP gel from 350 to 400 °C. A gel was obtained by evaporation of the TTEAIP solvent using an evaporator at 80 °C, and was heated at 150 °C for 60 min before undergoing firing in a furnace.
2.4 Preparation of Ag-capped-Fe-doped TiO2 nanopowder
Generally Ag nanoparticles are chemically very reactive; they can be oxidized by direct contact with TiO2 and can produce silver oxide (Ag2O). For this problem to prevent oxidation we introduce a very simple new method to prepare Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites by the citrate reduction method in acetonitrile–water mixed solvent. The Fe-doped TiO2 (100 mg) surface was modified by using potassium hydroxide. 0.001 M KOH were added drop-wise on Fe-doped TiO2 until the pH rose to ca. 11 in 70 vol% acetonitrile–water mixture under vigorous stirring. Then the Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposite was prepared by adding 1 mM of AgNO3 to the modified Fe-doped TiO2 surface with vigorous stirring at constant temperature (60 °C). The positively charged Ag+ ions were adsorbed strongly onto the negatively charged surface of the Fe-doped TiO2 nanopowder, and then the suspension was allowed to stand for 15 min to ensure complete adsorption of the Ag+ ions onto the Fe-doped TiO2 surface. Then the solution temperature was increased to the boiling temperature with vigorous stirring and 2 mL of 1% sodium citrate were added in solution (50 mL). After 30 min, the color of the suspension turned from light to dark brown and the total time of reduction was kept at 1 h. After that, the sample suspension was cooled by standing at room temperature. Then the solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The precipitate nanocomposites were washed two times with water and one time with ethanol to remove the remaining citrate solution and salt and to minimize the water content. After the supernatant was removed, nanocomposites were collected and sterilized in an autoclave. Then 10 mg of composite nanoclusters were dispersed in 5 mL of MEM (minimum essential medium) solution and stored at 4 °C for further application in cancer cells.
2.5 Instrumental analysis
Reflectance absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, UV-2450, Japan) and barium sulfate (BaSO4) was used as a standard. The size and shape of the nanocomposite were analyzed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-3010 VII), operated at 300 kV. Samples for TEM were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing in absolute ethanol, then placing a drop of this suspension onto a carbon-coated copper grid and dried naturally. The nanocomposite surface was also analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Ultra-High-Resolution Analytical SU-70, Hitachi), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Quantum-2000, Scanning ESCA-1000 microprobe with magnesium α radiation, Shimadzu) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical) analyzer. Prior to SEM measurements, the sample was dispersed on a carbon tape attached metal plate. Then the metal plate containing the sample was coated with platinum by using a magnetron sputter and placed in the SEM for the analysis with desired magnifications. The XPS patterns were recorded using MgKα X-ray as an excitation source and C1s (284.6 eV) as the reference line. The XRD patterns were recorded using an X'Pert PRO PANalytical diffractometer over the scanned angle from 10° to 100° at a scanning rate of 3° per minute. The quantitative chemical composition of the nanocomposite surface was also measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Philips, XL 30CP, microscope working at 15 kV) attached to the cold field SEM. The confirmation of the oxidative cell killing by formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) on the surface of visible light-illuminated Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 was performed by a photoluminescence (PL) technique (Shimadzu, RF-5300PC) with terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.
2.6 Cell culture and incubation with colloidal nanocomposite
A typical cancer cell line, human cervix epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa), was used in this study. The cells were cultured in a minimum essential medium (MEM, Sigma, Eagle) plus 10% new born calf serum (NBS, Invitrogen Corporation, Gibco) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a concentration of about 3 × 105 in 60 mm Petri dishes and were allowed to grow for 3 days. The old culture medium was replaced with nanocomposite colloidal solution and recultured for 24 hours in an incubator. After 24 h incubation cells were irradiated by light. The colloidal solution was then removed and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Invitrogen Corporation, Gibco). Then the cells were cleaved by trypsin–EDTA (Gibco) and collected from Petri dishes. After that the cells were stained with trypan blue (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and counted under a 10× in-bright field microscope (Olympus, CKX41). The cell survival was determined as the percentage of the number of unstained (live) cells against the control dish cells.
2.7 Light irradiation method on cells
In photocatalytic experiments, a xenon lamp (Cermax, 300-W LX300F, ILC, USA) was used. The light wavelength was 350–800 nm (ILC, CM1 as a reflection band pass and heat cutoff filter). The light power was measured by using a spectroradiometer (model LS-100, EKO Instruments Co. Ltd). The light power was ca. 90 mW cm−2 and the irradiation time was 10 min for Fe-doped TiO2 and 5 min for Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 for each dish. A table rotator was used for the Petri dish to ensure homogeneous light irradiation on the cells. The medium of cells cultured for 3 days was replaced with colloidal nanocomposite solution, and then the cells were incubated for 24 hours. One dish only was photoirradiated without using the nanocomposite solution (light control dish) and other dishes were photoirradiated with different quantities of colloidal nanocomposite solution. After light irradiation, the colloidal solution was removed and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then stained with trypan blue to evaluate the cell viability. Dead cells accumulated by the dye were stained in blue color while living cells have no color. The living cells were counted as the percentage against the control dish cells.
2.8 Method of taking cell images
The images were taken using an inverted Olympus CKX41 microscope with a numerical light field condenser, which delivers a very narrow beam of white light from a tungsten lamp on top of the sample. A 20× objective was used to collect only the scattered light from the samples. The light field pictures were taken using an Olympus digital camera (model No. C-5060, wide zoom).
2.9 Photoluminescence (PL) measurement
The PL experimental procedure was as follows: the Fe-doped TiO2 powder and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 powder (10 mg) were suspended separately in 20 mL of 5 × 10−4 M terephthalic acid aqueous solution with 2 × 10−3 M NaOH in a small size beaker with mild stirring. An aqueous suspension containing powder was exposed to visible light provided by a 500 W Xe lamp (UXL-500SX, Ushio) with a UV-cutoff filter (L-42, Asahi Techno glass). After light irradiation every 10 min for Fe-doped TiO2 powder and 5 min for Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 powder, the reaction solution was filtered to measure the PL intensity at 425 nm of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid excited by 315 nm light.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization properties

3.1.1 Reflectance absorption spectral analysis. 
UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 with different Fe contents are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows the absorption edge shifts to the visible light region upon iron doping in TiO2 and the broad absorption shoulders increase. The appearance of a shoulder band of Fe-doped TiO2 indicates that a new energy level is formed in the band structure of TiO2. The bandgap energies were obtained from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra of undoped TiO2, commercial Fe2O3 and Fe-doped TiO2 powders. The bandgap was calculated by using Planck's equation, Eg (eV) = 1240/λ (nm), where Eg is the bandgap energy and λ is the corresponding wavelength of the absorption edge. For the synthesized undoped TiO2 and commercial Fe2O3, the linear part of the edge gives 410 nm (3.02 eV) and 550 nm (2.25 eV), respectively, which are very close to well-known values. The onset absorption wavelength and corresponding bandgap of Fe-doped (1, 3, 5, 7 and 10%) TiO2 catalysts were found to be 427 nm (2.90 eV), 457 nm (2.71 eV), 471 nm (2.63 eV), 482 nm (2.57 eV), and 500 nm (2.40 eV), respectively. The above results suggest that the incorporation of Fe is responsible for the visible light photoresponse of the synthesized Fe-doped TiO2 photocatalyst. Iron doping is ascribed to the introduction of Fe3+ 3d states in the conduction band of TiO2. In addition, a striking feature in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1A) is the appearance of broad absorption shoulder bands. These absorption bands are generally associated with one type of transition, i.e., the promotion of an electron from a localized orbital on one atom to a higher-energy localized orbital on the same atom.27 In the present case, the absorption is associated with d–d electron transition of iron atoms.

The UV-visible absorption reflectance spectra of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 composite nanoclusters with different Fe contents are shown in Fig. 1B. Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 shows strong absorption in the visible region with plasmonic peaks at around 420 nm. The presence of plasmonic peaks in curves shows that Ag is not oxidized, because the absence of any plasmonic peaks in curves is associated with the oxidation of Ag nanoparticles.28


3.1.2 XRD analysis. 
In order to get insights into the crystal structure and phase formation of various Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed and are presented in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. XRD patterns confirmed the major presence of the anatase phase accompanied by a rather significant fraction of the rutile phase. No other significant peaks except the anatase and rutile phase of TiO2 were identified.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of (A) Fe-doped TiO2 at various Fe contents: (a) as-synthesized TiO2, (b) 1% Fe-doped TiO2, (c) 3% Fe-doped TiO2, (d) 5% Fe-doped TiO2, (e) 7% Fe-doped TiO2, and (f) 10% Fe-doped TiO2 and (B) Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 synthesized at constant Ag concentration with the same Fe doping as (A). 
Quantitative phase calculations of TiO2, Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 were performed using an X'Pert PRO PANalytical diffractometer software attached with XRD. For the synthesized undoped TiO2, the anatase percentage is approximately 78%, which is quite similar to that (80%) of the well-known Degussa P25 prepared by flame synthesis.2 With iron doping, the proportion of anatase decreases rapidly with increasing Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratio. When the Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratio reaches 5%, the content of rutile exceeds that of anatase as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B (d and d1 peaks)), implying that iron ions are prone to being doped in the rutile phase. The subsequent increase of the Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratio (7 and 10%) results in decreasing anatase peaks and increasing the rutile phase as shown in Fig. 2A and B (e, f and e1, f1). The results suggest that irons are considered to be doped substitutionally for Ti ions.
The XRD profiles of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 reveal the presence of diffraction peaks related to the Fe-doped TiO2 phase. The Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 samples also exhibit new peaks at 38.10° (111), 44.37° (200), 64.18° (220) and 77.54° (311) which belong to the crystal plane of metallic silver, indicating that Ag is in metallic form (JCPDS, PDF, file no. 00-001-1167). No appearance of silver oxide-characteristic peak indicates that Ag° exists in the crystal lattices of TiO2. The intensity of the Ag diffraction peak is almost the same except for Fig. 2B (b1, Ag-Fe-1%). This may be due to the high TiO2 content in samples, but no AgO diffraction peak could be observed at 30.9°.29 From the FWHM of the diffraction pattern, the crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer's equation and were found to be ca. 11 nm for Ag and ca. 14 nm for Fe-doped TiO2.

Fig. 2A and B show the powder XRD patterns for Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 at Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratios of 1 to 10%, respectively. For the powders with Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratios <5%, the diffraction peaks are normal with a symmetric shape, whereas, in the cases of atomic molar ratio 7 and 10%, the diffraction peaks except for (101) and (111) showed an asymmetric character. The extent of this asymmetry was remarkably enhanced with increasing Fe/TiO2 atomic ratio. In addition, these peaks, particularly (110), were broadened and weakened. The asymmetry, broadening, and weakening of the (110) reflection with iron doping suggest misalignment of slabs in such a way that the d spacing is not well defined in the (110) direction. It can be seen in Fig. 2A that the strongest diffraction from anatase (101) decreases with increase in the Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratio, while the opposite trend holds for rutile (110).


3.1.3 TEM analysis. 

Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of 5% Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposite. The images of the specimens also exhibit Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles ((Fig. 3a and b) and Ag metal nanoparticles ((Fig. 3b), respectively. The bright field TEM image in Fig. 3b suggests that spherical Ag particles are capped on Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The corresponding electron diffraction patterns of Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3 (a1 and b1), respectively. The concentric rings corresponding to (101), (004), (103), (200), (105) and (204) reflection are presented in Fig. 3 (a1 and b1). These distances are characteristic of the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure of Fe-doped TiO2 as mainly in the anatase phase (Fe content: 5%).
 Fig. 3  TEM micrographs of (a) Fe-doped TiO2 and (b) Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. a1 and b1 show the corresponding electron diffraction patterns of (a) and (b), respectively. The Fe content is 5%. 
It should be noted that the rings are constituted of a collection of spots typical of the different nanocrystal orientations. Hence, it can be concluded that Fe-doped TiO2 nanocrystals are formed. The electron diffraction in Fig. 3 (b1) shows a typical octahedral geometry which is in good correspondence with Ag and Fe-doped TiO2 polycrystalline nanopowders. The diffraction spots/rings can be again indexed as (111), (200), (220) and (311) reflections according to the cubic structure of Ag. The appearance of diffraction rings/spots indicates that the Ag nanoparticles are comprised of polycrystalline domains with Fe-doped TiO2 nanocrystals.


3.1.4 SEM analysis. 
The SEM images of Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S1 as the ESI† and prove that all samples exhibit very similar heterostructure. As seen in Fig. S1B† the SEM images of the Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites show that Fe-doped TiO2 is uniformly deposited by Ag nanoparticles. It can be seen that the Ag size is ca. 12 nm in all of the samples. Only ca. 5% of the Fe-doped TiO2 surface area were deposited. A large surface area of the Fe-doped TiO2 is still exposed (Fig. S1B†). The Ag metal has electron-capture properties at the Schottky barrier in contact with the Fe-doped TiO2 surface. The SEM images show the only small area of the Fe-doped TiO2 surface that is actually covered.


3.1.5 XPS analysis. 
XPS measurements were carried out to determine the elements of Fe, Ag, Ti and O and their chemical states in materials. XPS wide survey spectra of Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. S2A and B†, respectively. According to XPS wide survey spectra, Fe-doped TiO2 samples contained Ti, C, Fe and O, whereas Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 samples contained Ti, C, Fe, O and Ag elements, with sharp photoelectron peaks. The carbon peak is attributed to the residual carbon from the sample and/or adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. Fig. S2A† (spectrum of TiO2) shows the standard spectrum of synthesized undoped TiO2 and a spectrum of α-Fe2O3 shows the commercial standard α-Fe2O3 and the middle shows spectra of doped (1–10%) Fe to TiO2 which were used for comparisons of spectral residual peaks. Other residual peaks were not observed except the sample element standard peaks. Fig. S2B† also shows the same peaks as Fig. S2A† except the Ag peaks.

Fig. 4A shows the XPS spectra for Ti2p of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. The Ti2p spectrum showed a single strong peak at 458.5 eV and a weak shoulder at around 464.2 eV for as-synthesized TiO2 (undoped) corresponding to Ti4+. The doping of Fe to TiO2 causes the gradual peak shift generally encountered in TiO2 for oxygen vacancies, interstitial or substitutional Ti3+ ions, interstitial Ti4+ ions and cation vacancies. This result suggests that the shift of spectral bands are due to oxygen deficiency created by the substitution of Fe3+ for tetravalent Ti4+ in TiO2.
 Fig. 4  XPS spectra for (A) Ti2p, (B) O1s, (C) Fe2p and (D) Ag3d of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. 

Fig. 4B shows the O1s XPS spectra of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. The O1s spectrum was a little asymmetric. The synthesized TiO2 (undoped) of O1s located at about 530.0 eV shows energy similar to the O1s electron binding energy for TiO2, corresponding to lattice oxygen of TiO2. The O1s peak of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 appears at 531.6 eV, attributed to a little presence of surface hydroxyl oxygen (O–OH, 532.1 eV). The shift of O1s spectra from 530.0 eV (for TiO2) to 531.8–531.9 eV (for α-Fe2O3) suggests that trivalent Fe3+ ions are substitutionally doped in TiO2. Because oxygen vacancies or interstitial cations carry a positive charge, iron ions are prone to being doped in TiO2. This O1s signal showed a shoulder located (around 534 eV) at the side of higher binding energies, indicating a small amount of surface hydroxyl groups or chemisorbed water molecules.30,31 These data suggest that the amount of surface hydroxyl oxygen or adsorbed oxygen (Os, 533.6 eV) and/or oxygen vacancies of Fe-doped (1–10%) TiO2 increases but the amount of crystal lattice oxygen decreases. The oxygen vacancies are a very active group, which can easily combine with other atoms (such as Fe and Ag) or groups to become stable, accounting for an increase in the amount of the adsorbed oxygen and surface hydroxyl oxygen.32

Fig. 4C shows the Fe2p XPS spectra of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. The Fe2p spectrum showed a single strong peak at 712.39 eV and a weak shoulder at around 725.97 eV for commercial α-Fe2O3 corresponding to Fe3+. The signals of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 (1–10%) are very weak, due to the low doping of Fe-content. The signals of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 are similar to commercial α-Fe2O3, indicating Fe3+ doped in TiO2. We could not find any other corresponding signals like Fe2+ in Fe XPS spectra. As trivalent iron ions (Fe3+) are substitutionally doped in TiO2, oxygen vacancies and/or interstitial cations (Fe3+, Ti3+, and Ti4+) would be spontaneously introduced to maintain the charge neutrality. From these results it can be established that a fraction of Fe ions interacts strongly with TiO2 suggesting the linkage-forming possibility of Ti–O–Fe–O–Ti–O–Fe–O–Ti type bonds at least at the surface.

Fig. 4D shows Ag3d XPS spectra of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. The Ag3d spectra showed the two strong peaks at 370.10 eV and 376.10 eV with a splitting width 6 eV which were ascribed to metallic silver. The characteristic spectra of Ag suggest that Ag is on the surface of Fe-doped TiO2 and moreover any interruptions to the Fe-doped TiO2 crystal structure are not seen.


3.1.6 EDX analysis. 
The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis demonstrates that the crystal consists of Ti, Fe and O elements for Fe-doped TiO2 (Fig. S3A†), whereas it consists of Ag, Ti, Fe and O elements for Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 (Fig. S3B†). EDX was employed to obtain the quantitative element information on the amount and the distribution of Fe, Ag, Ti and O species in the samples. The detected carbon signals were likely assumed to originate from the carbon tape or adventitious hydrocarbon from the EDX instrument itself.
The analyses were done in the three different regions and the average values are given in Table 1. The atomic% values of Fe, 1.31, 3.19, 4.24, 6.77 and 9.39, are roughly similar to atomic molar ratios of Fe to TiO2 in the precursors. In the case of Ag, the averaged atomic% value was found to be 1.47, also roughly corresponding to an expected value (1.0) in the precursors.

3.2 Photocatalytic cancer cell killing
Controlled experiments in the absence of Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 were done for the cancer cell killing under UV-visible (350–800 nm) light irradiation. In the ordinate of Fig. 5A–C, 100% indicates the number of living cells in a control dish. To compare the cell killing ability of Fe-doped TiO2 with Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, the cell dishes were incubated with different amounts of MEM containing colloidal nanocomposites (10 mg/5 mL MEM) solution (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μL).
 Fig. 5  Surviving fractions of HeLa cells incubated in a MEM medium containing (A) Fe-doped TiO2 under 5 min irradiation, (B) Fe-doped TiO2 under 10 min irradiation, (C) Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 under 5 min irradiation and (D) cell killing efficiency of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 containing 1–10% Fe. 100% indicates the control dish and the cell viability percentage was calculated using the number of live cells against the control dish cells. Bars represent margins of errors of 2-times measured data and each point represents the mean value of two data. Note the ordinate (70–100%) in (D). 
The cells were stained by the trypan blue indicator; the dead cell accumulates the dye, resulting in blue color, whereas the live cells have no color. The cell viability was determined as the percentage of the number of unstained cells against that of the control dish cells.
In the absence of light, the cells were found to be mostly viable (ca. 95–100%) under the incubated condition with the nanocomposite colloidal solutions, whereas under 5 and 10 min light irradiation without nanocomposites, cells were found to be ca. 90–100% viable as shown in Fig. 5A–C (light control, see abscissas). However, after 5 min light irradiation, the amount of cells killed was maximally ca. 40% for only Fe-doped TiO2 (Fig. 5A), whereas after 10 min light irradiation, the amount of cells killed was maximally ca. 100% in 100 μL MEM containing nanocomposites (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, the destructive cell killing effect was found in the presence of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites under 5 min light irradiation; maximum number of cells were killed rapidly as shown in Fig. 5C. In the presence of 100 μL Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 (5% Fe-doped TiO2 with silver capped) under 5 min light irradiation almost 100% of the cells were killed (Fig. 5C), whereas in the same concentration of Fe-doped TiO2 alone, ca. 40% cells were killed (Fig. 5A). The photocatalytic cancer cell killing of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 required only half the irradiation time required by Fe-doped TiO2 alone and the killing efficiency of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 was more than two times higher than that of Fe-doped TiO2 at the same concentration and irradiation time. Ag capped to the Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposite plays an important role in the photocatalysis for cancer cell killing. The error bars in Fig. 5A–C represent the maximum and minimum values of two independent experiments.
In the lower Fe-doped region (Fe/TiO2 atomic molar ratios <5%), some surface oxides (such as FeO) may be formed, which may lead to decrease in the photocatalytic cytotoxicity (1 and 3% Fe content in Fig. 5D). At the optimum ratio (Fe/TiO2 atomic ratio 5%), we assume that some photothermal killing due to the plasmonic absorption (Fig. 1B) of Ag nanoparticles may also contribute to the cytotoxicity.33 However, in the higher molar ratio region (Fe/TiO2 atomic ratios >5%) with excessive doped Fe in the TiO2 nanoparticles, the phases are more changed to the rutile and also some Fe clusters may be formed on the surface, which may also lead to decrease in photocatalytic cell killing (Fig. 5D, and d and e in Fig. 5A–C). However, further study is needed to clarify the presence of the optimum ratio (5%).

Fig. 6 shows microscopic images of HeLa cells (a) before, (b–d) after light irradiation, (e) single live cell (with neither Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites nor light) and (f) single dead cell (after 5 min light irradiation with the nanocomposites). Fig. 6a and b show that the cell morphology is largely unchanged after 10 min irradiation. Fig. 6c shows that the HeLa cells suffer severe photochemical injury under 5 min light irradiation with the Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites where some red spots and aggregated particles are seen. It can be suggested from this image that the nanocomposites are taken up into or in contact with the cells, because these red spots are not observed when the nanocomposites are not present in the medium (Fig. 6a and b). Thus, it is considered that the nanocomposites form aggregates in or on the cells. After light irradiation, cells were stained with trypan blue; cells stained blue (Fig. 6d) indicated cell death. Moreover, the killing was confirmed by also observing the image of a single cell. Fig. 6e shows the single live cell of neither Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites nor light, whereas Fig. 6f shows the single dead cell of 5 min light irradiation with the nanocomposite. The dead cell shows the photocatalytic destruction under 5 min light irradiation.

3.3 Cancer cell killing mechanism
The benefit of Fe3+ doping in the TiO2 lattice is to induce donor and acceptor levels which reduce the bandgap of TiO2. As a result, the light absorption of TiO2 can be extended into the visible region.34 The Fe3+ dopant is most frequently employed owing to its unique half-filled electronic configuration,18–20 which might narrow the energy gap through the formation of new intermediate energy levels and also diminish recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes by capturing photoelectrons. When Fe3+ ions trap electrons, the half-filled electronic configuration is destroyed and their stability decreases. The trapped electrons can easily be transferred to the oxygen molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the catalysts, and the Fe3+ ions return to the original stable half-filled electronic structure. This might promote charge transfer and efficiently separate the electrons and holes by shallowly trapping electrons. The prerequisite for an effective dopant may involve the possibility of charge detrapping and migration to the surface of catalysts.35
The photocatalytic efficiency depends on the recombination rate or lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes. Undoubtedly, Fe-doped TiO2 exhibits highly photocatalytic performance. However, our results reveal that Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 has higher photocatalytic efficiency than the only Fe-doped TiO2 for cancer cell killing in vitro. Ag capped on Fe-doped TiO2 may prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electrons more efficiently and may be responsible for their superior acceleration for photocatalytic cell killing effect.
In Fe-doped TiO2 samples, photoexcited conduction-band electrons are transferred to Ti(IV) surface sites (forming Ti3+) or to deeper Fe(III) sites (forming Fe2+). In this case, the transferred electron can be easily migrated from Fe2+ to neighboring surface Ti4+ because of the proximity of the energy levels. Then for the Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 samples, Ti4+ site electrons are efficiently trapped by Ag nanoparticles and can easily reduce O2 on the interface as shown in a pictorial view in Fig. 7. It is well known that molecular oxygen accepts the photogenerated electrons to form the superoxide anion (O2˙−) as shown in reaction (3). Generally, O2˙− is less reactive and has a short lifetime and therefore the role of O2˙− in succeeding reactions is not understood well:36 (Fe-TiO2)Ag + hν → (Fe-TiO2 (e− + h+))Ag(1) (Fe-Ti4+)Ag + e− → (Fe-Ti3+)Ag(2) (Fe-Ti3+)Ag + O2 → (Fe-TiO2)Ag + O2˙−(3)
 Fig. 7  Dopant influences intrinsic properties of titania resulting in lowering the bandgap and shifting light absorption into the visible light range. Capped Ag is useful for the visible light absorption and separation of hole and electron. 
On the other hand, the dopant level hole (h+) can be easily moved from Fe3+/4+ to a neighboring interface surface of O sites. Then the photogenerated holes on the Fe-TiO2 surface can react with water to produce powerful oxidative radicals such as ˙OH and HO2˙ via reactions (4) and (5). While O2˙− is not considered so reactive and is further reduced slowly to H2O2 as shown in reaction (6).37 H2O2 is more reactive than O2˙− and is easily decomposed to ˙OH as shown in reaction (7).38 Fe-TiO2 (h+) + H2O → ˙OH + H+(4) O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙(5) 2HO2˙ → O2 + H2O2(6) H2O2 + O2˙− → ˙OH + OH− + O2(7)
The highly oxidizable hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radicals (O2˙−) formed on the surface of photoexcited TiO2 particles alone are reported to be toxic to cells.36
The oxidation by both the photogenerated holes and the radicals at the Fe-TiO2/Ag interface is an important process. It can be a major factor in determining the overall photocatalytic efficiency of Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites. Dopants can act as both electron traps and hole traps which are photoactive. Trapping either an electron or a hole alone is ineffective because the immobilized charge species quickly recombines with its mobile counterpart.39 After the excitation in the Fe-doped valence level, the electrons migrate to Ag where they are trapped and the electron–hole recombination is suppressed. The hole is then free to diffuse to the TiO2 surface where oxidation reactions can occur.34
Experiments to confirm the reaction mechanism were performed under dark conditions without light illumination; the cell killing effect was not observed for every measurement using Fe-doped TiO2 particles or Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites. Most of the cells were found to be viable (ca. 96–100%) under the dark conditions without light illumination. Light illumination in the absence of Fe-doped TiO2 particles and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites did not result in the photocatalytic cell killing of HeLa cells. Therefore, the presence of visible light irradiation and Fe-doped TiO2 particles or Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 nanocomposites is essential for efficient cell killing.
3.4 Photoluminescence detection of hydroxyl radical for photocatalytic cancer cell killing
The cell killing mechanism requires that the formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) on the surface of visible light-irradiated Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 should be detected by a photoluminescence (PL) technique using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule. Terephthalic acid reacts with hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) to form a highly fluorescent product, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, during irradiation time. The intensity of the PL peak of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid is in proportion to the amount of OH radicals produced in water.40,41 This method relies on the PL signal at 425 nm due to the hydroxylation of terephthalic acid with ˙OH generated at the water/Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 interface.
The PL spectra were compared between Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 of the same concentration under the same visible light irradiation. The PL spectra excited at 315 nm in terephthalic acid solution were measured every 10 min for Fe-doped TiO2 and 5 min for Ag@Fe-doped TiO2. Fig. 8 shows the change of PL spectra with irradiation time. As shown in Fig. 8, gradual increase in the fluorescence at about 425 nm was observed by the irradiation of visible light on the Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 solution. This strongly suggests that the fluorescence is caused by chemical reactions of terephthalic acid with ˙OH formed on the Fe-doped TiO2 or Ag@Fe-doped TiO2/water interface via photocatalytic reactions. Although a little PL was observed in the absence of visible light for Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 solutions, it may be ascribed to that due to the reaction of terephthalic acid with OH− originated from NaOH.
 Fig. 8  PL spectral changes observed during irradiation of (a) Fe-doped (5%) TiO2 and (b) Ag@Fe-doped (5%) TiO2 samples. Each fluorescence spectrum was recorded every 10 min for (a) Fe-doped (5%) TiO2 and 5 min for (b) Ag@Fe-doped (5%) TiO2 under visible light irradiation. Note that the ordinate scales are different. 
For the comparative study of PL intensities of Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 (Fe-doping 5%), it can be seen (Fig. 8) that the Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 fluorescence intensity is much larger than Fe-doped TiO2 alone. It can be concluded that the Ag shell highly enhances the photocatalytic activity. In the higher molar ratio region (Fe/TiO2 atomic ratios >5%) PL intensity changes are fairly not good for both Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 samples as shown in the ESI in Fig S4†. This result was also supported by the photocatalytic HeLa cell killing with Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2.
4. Conclusions
A series of nanosized Fe-doped TiO2 and Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 photocatalysts have been studied for the photocatalytic killing of cancer cells. The photocatalytic cancer cell killing and its mechanism are dominated by the Fe-doping percentage in TiO2 and depend on surface properties of catalysts. The Ag nanoparticles capped on the Fe-doped (<5%) TiO2 surface is shown to be favored for highly photocatalytic reactions on cancer cells. Iron doping greatly promoted the formation of rutile because of its higher tolerance to defects such as oxygen vacancies resulting from the substitution of Fe3+ for Ti4+ in TiO2. Iron doping in TiO2 led to narrowing of the bandgap and allows the absorption of visible light. As-prepared Ag@Fe-doped TiO2 is more active than Fe-doped TiO2, which could be explained by considering the good crystallization, strong absorption of visible light and more surface oxygen vacancies. Moreover the Ag nanoparticles could also reduce the recombination between photoelectrons and holes and efficiently transfer the electron to the interface, leading to the enhanced quantum efficiency of photocatalysis. Our results for cancer cell killing clearly indicated that the Ag nanoparticles play a major role in the photocatalytic enhancement of Fe-doped TiO2, which opens a new way for catalytic cancer killing.
