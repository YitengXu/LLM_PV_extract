    , Accepted 14th June 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractConventional, high-efficiency, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (e.g., methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)) having ammonium-based organic cations exhibit poor moisture stability mainly due to the effective hydrogen bonding interaction of nitrogen in the ammonium-based cations with water molecules. Recently, a sulfonium-based cation, trimethylsulfonium (TMS+), has attracted growing attention for the development of moisture-stable hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This research investigated the photovoltaic performance of trimethylsulfonium lead triiodide (TMSPbI3) based PSCs and their moisture stability both experimentally and theoretically. The results revealed that TMSPbI3 exhibited a relatively large optical band gap (Eg = 2.32 eV) and high absorption coefficient (α = 2.30 × 104 cm−1 at 500 nm) with a hexagonal one-dimensional crystal structure. The PSCs with a device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3/CuSCN/Au exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.22% with no hysteresis in the I–V curve, and high moisture stability at ambient temperature (25 ± 3 °C, ca. 50% relative humidity) with a PCE loss of only ca. 4.6% after 500 h. This result could be attributed to the absence of the hydrogen bonding interaction of TMS+ with water molecules, leading to the effective stabilization of TMSPbI3 compared to MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, verified by density functional theory calculations.
1. Introduction
During the past decade, hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention from scientists and industry due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and cost-effective processing technology.1,2 In particular, methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead triiodide (CH5N2PbI3 or FAPbI3) perovskites are the most widely investigated effective light absorbers owing to their numerous advantages, such as a low optical band gap, high absorption coefficient, and long-range exciton diffusion length.3–6 The PCE of these perovskite based PSCs was greatly enhanced from 3.81% to 23.3% through the successful engineering of efficient device architectures and film preparation processes (e.g., sequential and vapor deposition), the control of the concentration of deep-level defects of perovskites, and the development of novel materials.7–9 Recently, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) certified a PCE of 25.5% for single-junction PSCs,10 which exceeds the reported PCEs of other types of thin-film solar cells.
Although PSCs are now competitive with traditional Si-solar cells, their commercialization depends on improving their long-term operational stability during exposure to prolonged humidity, light, heat, and oxygen, which is not enough for commercialization.3 For example, the absorption intensity of MAPbI3 is halved within 4 h at 98% relative humidity (RH), with a blue shifted absorption band edge, while it took ca. 10000 hours at a lower RH of 20%.11 Similarly, the photoactive black α-phase of FAPbI3 is easily converted to a photo-inactive yellow δ-phase and degraded by water molecules.12 This instability of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 could be attributed to the effective hydrogen bonding interaction of the methylammonium cation (MA+) and formamidinium cation (FA+) with water molecules through nitrogen.5,11,12 Additionally, the weak electrostatic bonding between the MA+ and [PbI6]4− octahedra is another possible reason for the facile decomposition of MAPbI3.13
To increase the moisture stability of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 based PSCs, various strategies were suggested, such as the replacement of MA+ and FA+ by other cations (Cs+, guanidinium (GA+), etc.) (Fig. 1a shows the molecular structures of Cs+, MA+, and FA+),14–17 the compositional tuning of mixed halides and pseudo-halogens,18–20 the introduction of mixed multiple cations (MA1−xFAxPbI3, MA1−xCsxPbI3, Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)(100−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, and Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3),21–24 the insertion of robust barrier layers,25 the replacement of a conventional spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL),26 the incorporation of larger organoammonium cations (ethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, hydrazinium, etc.),27–29 and the encapsulation/packaging of the entire device.30 Despite those attempts, the moisture stability remains insufficient for the commercialization of PSCs, which are required to operate up to 20–25 years under outdoor conditions with a PCE retention of 80% of the initial value.3,31 The replacement or mixing of MA+ and FA+ with alkali metal cations and larger organoammonium cations is a very effective strategy to develop moisture resistant PSCs.32–37 For example, the controlled incorporation of Cs+ and rubidium (Rb+) cations into MA+- and FA+-based perovskites led to improved moisture-resistance and enhanced photovoltaic (PV) performance.32–35 The reason is partly attributed to the absence of the hydrogen bonding interaction of Cs+ and Rb+ with water molecules. Again, the incorporation of larger ammonium-based cations and their resultant perovskites in conventional MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 to form multi-dimensional (1D/3D or 2D/3D) homojunction and heterojunction PSCs can lead to good moisture stability.29,36,37 For example, Poli et al. prepared a tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) and MA+ mixed perovskite ((TBA)n(MA)1−nPbX3), where 2D (TBA)PbX3 coexists with 3D MAPbX3.36 The PCE of the corresponding 2D/3D perovskite based PSCs remains unchanged for 45 days under ambient conditions without encapsulation, while MAPbX3 lost a PCE of 60% over the same time. Similarly, some other researchers prepared GA+ and MA+ mixed perovskite (MA1−xGAxPbI3 (0 < x < 0.25))37 and phenethylammonium (PEA+) and FA+ mixed perovskite-based PSCs,38 which exhibited better stability compared to pristine MAPbX3 and FAPbI3-based PSCs. Nevertheless, the long-term stability of these larger organoammonium cation mixed hybrid PSCs has not been thoroughly investigated since amines can easily react with and hydrolyzed by moisture via hydrogen bonding. Based on this structural variation issue of the organic/inorganic cations, we noticed that the hydrogen bonding of the donor atom in the organic/inorganic cations of the given perovskite materials with water molecules is a crucial factor in controlling the moisture stability, in addition to other conventional factors, such as the cationic size, tolerance factors (TFs), and the crystal phase.

Recently, sulfonium-based cations are attracting growing interest over organoammonium cations for developing moisture-stable PSCs, including trimethylsulfonium (TMS+) (Fig. 1a), trimethylsulfoxonium (TMSO+), and butyldimethylsulfonium (BDMS+).39–41 In particular, TMS+ cation-based trimethylsulfonium lead triiodide (TMSPbI3) is investigated mostly.39–44 Kaltzoglou et al. first investigated the structural and optoelectronic properties of TMSPbI3, which showed high stability under moist air conditions and up to 200 °C.42 Later, Hu et al. developed a 1D TMSPbI3 nanorod array-based PSC using a VOx HTL with a PCE of 2.07%.43 Importantly, the TMSPbI3 nanorod array showed good air stability without altering the crystallinity and morphologies for two months under ambient conditions. 1D TMSPbI3 is also used as an interfacial layer in a (FA/MA/Cs)PbI3−xBrx based PSC with significantly high stability against light and humidity without encapsulation.44 Thus, the moisture stability of TMSPbI3 constructed PSC devices, the exploration of other high-performance HTLs (e.g., CuSCN and spiro-OMETAD), and the theoretical investigation of the reaction kinetics between TMSPbI3 and water molecules are fundamentally important for the further development of stable PSCs. Herein, the PV performance of a TMSPbI3 based PSC and its moisture stability was investigated both experimentally and using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The TMSPbI3 with a 1D hexagonal crystal phase, synthesized by a two-step solution process on a mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) electrode, showed suitable energy band positions for efficient electron and hole transport to the m-TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and inorganic CuSCN HTL, respectively. The single-step solution process proved unsuccessful for the synthesis of TMSPbI3 because of the poor solubility of TMSI in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvents, while a conventional one-step process was generally suitable for preparing CsPbI3, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3 perovskites. The PSC device (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3/CuSCN/Au) exhibited a hysteresis-less PCE of 2.22% with good stability for 500 h under ambient conditions without encapsulation.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and fabrication of mesoscopic PSCs
Unless otherwise noted, all materials were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used as received. For the fabrication of mesoscopic PSCs, firstly, HCl-etched fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, solar, 2.3 mm thickness) were cleaned by ultrasonication in an aqueous detergent solution, ethanol, and acetone, and then dried with N2 gas. Subsequently, the dried FTO was subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 30 min. A compact layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2) was deposited on the etched FTO substrates by spin coating using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) sol–gel solution at a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min and then at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of c-TiO2 was about 50 nm. After cooling down to room temperature (RT), the substrates were immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution in ethanol at 70 °C for 30 min, and then rinsed with de-ionized water and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Next, m-TiO2 was spin-coated at a spin rate of 5000 rpm for 30 s using a diluted TiO2 paste (particle size 20 nm; TTPH-20N, ENB Korea Co., Ltd, Korea) in ethanol (w/w = 2:7). After drying at 150 °C for 10 min, the films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled down to RT. PbI2 powder was dissolved in 1 M DMF by stirring overnight at 70 °C. The PbI2 solution was deposited on the m-TiO2 films by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s, dried at 90 °C for 30 min, and then cooled down to RT. Afterward, the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a solution of (CH3)3SI in acetonitrile (10 mg mL−1), rinsed with acetonitrile, and dried at 100 °C for 30 min. Next, a solution of 8 mg mL−1 CuSCN in propyl sulfide was coated on top of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3 by the doctor blade method at 80 °C. Finally, the Au electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a constant evaporation rate of 0.15 nm s−1. A spiro-OMeTAD HTL with the composition of 180 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 18 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 40 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution in chlorobenzene was deposited onto the TMSPbI3 layer by a spin coating method.
2.2 Characterization
The PV measurements of the PSCs were performed under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G), which was generated by a 200 W xenon lamp using a solar simulator (Polaronix K201, McScience, Korea). The intensity of the simulated light was calibrated against a standard mono-Si reference solar cell (PVM-396, PV Measurements, Inc., USA). The current density–voltage (J–V) graph was obtained by using a PV power system (Polaronix K101/LAB20, McScience). The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded by using an IPCE measurement system (Polaronix K3100, McScience) with a 300 W xenon light source, calibrated against the same standard mono-Si reference solar cell. The X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD; Cu Kα radiation; D/Max-2500, Rigaku) was characterized at 40 kV and 30 mA. The surface morphology and thickness were studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a Jeol JSM-6700F SEM. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II with a He ionization energy (IE; 21.22 eV) source. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (S-3100, Scinco).
2.3 Computational details
DFT was used to calculate the transition states (TSs), reaction intermediate (IM), and product (P) energy of the reaction of the TMSPbI3 molecule with water molecules, together with the conventional MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and CsPbI3 perovskite molecules. In this regard, the corresponding molecular motif of all perovskites was considered because it allows quick estimation of the fundamental Eg, deformation potential, exciton binding energy, and hygroscopicity of the corresponding bulk-form semiconductors.45,46 Geometry optimization and intrinsic reaction coordinate path analysis were carried out using the gradient-corrected DFT method47 with the B3LYP48 functional combined with the Lanl2DZ49 basis set. The geometries of the reactant and P minima were optimized along with the TSs to determine the minimum energy reaction paths. The Gaussian 09 suite of programs50 was used for all computational studies.
3. Results and discussion
The UV-visible absorption spectra of different perovskite layers prepared on the m-TiO2 layer are shown in Fig. 1b. It is well known that the crystal lattice of perovskites can be expanded with the increase in the size of the ‘A’ site cation, which induces a red-shifted absorption onset and decreases the optical Eg.51 The corresponding TMSPbI3 perovskite showed a noticeable blue shift of the absorption onset compared to the CsPbI3, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3 perovskites, despite that the size of TMS+ (244 pm)42 is intermediate between those of MA+ (217 pm) and FA+ (253 pm) and larger than that of Cs+ (167 pm).52 From measuring the onset of the first absorption peak,51 the Eg of TMSPbI3 was ca. 2.32 eV (ESI, Fig. S1†), consistent with the reported value.43 Nevertheless, the blue-shifted absorption onset and large Eg of TMSPbI3 compared to CsPbI3, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3 could be ascribed to the distortion of the face-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra due to the large volume of TMS+.13,42 The α of TMSPbI3 (thickness of ca. 382 nm) coated on the TiO2 film (thickness of ca. 375 nm) was estimated to be ca. 2.30 × 104 cm−1 at 500 nm with a penetration depth of light of 0.43 μm, and is one-order lower than the α of MAPbI3 (ca. 1.6 × 105 cm−1 at 500 nm).53 The details of the calculation of α and the corresponding α vs. wavelength plot are presented in the ESI (Fig. S2†). Additionally, the TMSI precursor solution does not show any light absorption in the visible wavelength range. It also exhibits a large blue shift of the absorption onset compared to MAI and PbI2, which is also evident from the color of their corresponding precursor solutions (ESI, Fig. S3†), indicating the successful synthesis of TMSPbI3. Additionally, the non-absorbing behavior of TMSI suggests that it does not compete with the light absorption of TMSPbI3 if there is reaming or unreacted TMSI in the perovskite film.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of TMSPbI3 on the m-TiO2 electrode along with those of PbI2 and TiO2. It is well-matched with the simulated XRD pattern of TMSPbI3 (CCDC# 1547868).42 This profile corresponds to the formation of hexagonal TMSPbI3 perovskite with a 1-D channel along the c-axis (Fig. 2b) in the space group of P63mc (no. 186). It is thermodynamically stable at RT, similar to δ-FAPbI3 (yellow phase).42,43 The sharp and intense peaks of TMSPbI3 at ca. 10.67°, 15.5°, 18.60°, 22.23°, 24.15°, 28.60°, and 29.10° indicate the reflections of (100), (101), (20), (002), (201), (30), and (22), respectively. The additional peak at 26.20° is attributed to the (101) plane of the anatase phase of TiO2.54,55 The large TF value of 0.97 for TMSPbI3 induces the formation of 1D hexagonal rod-shaped structures, as shown in the FE-SEM image (Fig. 2c). For comparison, the FE-SEM image of the DMF-based PbI2 film (ESI, Fig. S4†) was also obtained. It exhibited layered structures with the existence of some pinholes or pores, consistent with reported results.56,57

Fig. 3a shows the UPS of TMSPbI3 on the m-TiO2 layer. All the energy values measured by UPS were calibrated against a He IE of 21.22 eV and referenced to a common vacuum level energy (Evac = 0 eV).58 The photoemission cut-off value for TMSPbI3 was 17.95 eV, which corresponds to the work function (WF) of 3.27 eV lying below the Evac. The valence band maximum (VBM or EVB) was positioned at −5.18 eV, which is 1.91 eV below the Fermi level (EF), as indicated in the inset of Fig. 3a. Thus, considering the Eg (2.32 eV) of TMSPbI3, the conduction band edge (ECB) is −2.86 eV, which is 0.41 eV above the EF. The electron affinity (EA), the difference between WF and ECB, and the IE for TMSPbI3 are calculated to be 2.86 and 5.18 eV, respectively. The ECB of TMSPbI3 is 1.34 eV above the conduction band of TiO2 (ECB,TiO2) (−4.2 eV).59 Meanwhile, the EVB of TMSPbI3 is 0.08 eV lower than the EVB of CuSCN and 0.04 eV higher than the EVB of spiro-OMeTAD HTLs,60,61 suggesting that CuSCN is more suitable for efficient charge separation.

The mesoporous-type TMSPbI3-based PSCs with c-TiO2 and m-TiO2 as ETLs, spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL, and an Au layer as the counter electrode (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) exhibited a poor PCE of only 0.438% (ESI, Fig. S5(a) and Table S1†). The low PCE is attributed to the degradation or phase change of TMSPbI3 crystals induced by the basicity of the tBP additives containing spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (solvent). The decoloring and decreased absorption of the TMSPbI3/tBP film observed in the absorption spectra of the TMSPbI3 and TMSPbI3/tBP films on the ETL layers confirmed this interpretation (ESI, Fig. S5(b)†). The small mismatch of energy level alignment between TMSPbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD is another possible reason for the low PCE. The cells with CuSCN as the HTL instead of spiro-OMeTAD (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3/CuSCN/Au) with an optimum thickness of ca. 377, 382, 440, and 122 nm for m-TiO2, TMSPbI3, CuSCN, and Au, respectively (Fig. 4a) showed a maximum PCE of 2.22% with a short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of 3.77 mA cm−2, 0.932 V, and 63.37%, respectively, in the forward scan (Fig. 4b). The corresponding optimization results are summarized in Fig. S6 (ESI).† The PSC exhibited a negligible hysteresis with only a 0.90% PCE difference in the reverse scan (a Jsc, Voc, and FF and PCE of 3.71 mA cm−2, 0.936 V, and 63.30%, and 2.20%, respectively (Fig. 4b)). The IPCE plot (insets of Fig. 4b) indicates that the photocurrent generation is extended up to ca. 530 nm, and it is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of TMSPbI3. The measured Jsc was almost consistent with the value (ca. 3.10 mA cm−2) estimated by integrating the measured IPCE spectrum. Among 45 cells, ca. 25% cells showed PCEs of above 2.20%, and 35.5% exceeded 2.10%, with an average PCE of 2.06% under 1 sun illumination conditions (insets of Fig. 4b).

(b) Current density–voltage (J–V) plot of the cell as a function of forward and reverse bias voltage (insets show the IPCE plot of the corresponding cell and histogram of PCEs for 45 cells). 
The low efficiency of this TMSPbI3 solar cell is mostly attributed to the very rough and porous nature of the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 2c. It was not successful for the preparation of a uniform and homogeneous film due to the large TF of TMSPbI3, which generally promotes the formation of rod-shaped 1D crystal structures42,43 during the two-step solution process. The attempt to achieve a relatively higher PCE with enhanced uniformity in film formation by a single-step solution process was not successful because of the poor solubility of the perovskite components (PbI2 and TMSI) in various solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, and γ-butyrolactone. Therefore, it is of further interest to enhance the PCE of TMSPbI3 solar cells by solvent engineering since the Shockley–Queisser limit of Jsc for TMSPbI3 (Eg = 2.32 eV) based single-junction PSCs is 8.64 mA cm−2 at 25 °C under AM 1.5G spectral irradiance conditions and considering the radiative emission from the front and rear sides of the cell.62 This can induce a theoretical limit of Voc and FF of 1.982 V and 93.1%, respectively, with a PCE of 15.95%.62
With the consideration that moisture is a critical and major cause of the decomposition of perovskite materials, we investigated the stability of TMSPbI3-based PSCs over 500 h without encapsulation under ambient conditions (ca. 50 ± 5% RH, 25 ± 3 °C, and at atmospheric pressure) and 1 sun illumination. No notable changes were observed in the PV parameters of the cells after 500 h. PCE, Jsc, and FF were decreased by only ca. 4.60%, 5.40%, and 0.47%, respectively, while Voc increased slightly by up to 1% after 500 h (Fig. 5a). Importantly, this indicates the enhanced moisture stability of TMSPbI3 compared with other conventional organic–inorganic hybrid-based PSCs. It is consistent with the moisture stability of single-crystal TMSPbI3 for several months in air.42,43 The XRD pattern of freshly prepared and aged TMSPbI3 perovskite (up to 50 days) did not reveal any measurable differences in the peak position and peak height and any additional impurity peak or any sign of PbI2 formation by the decomposition of TMSPbI3 perovskite (Fig. 5b). The absence of color change in the TMSPbI3 perovskite film by visual inspection during aging (ESI, Fig. S7†) and the lack of morphological change in the FE-SEM images (ESI, Fig. S8†) support this finding. The high moisture stability of TMSPbI3 can be ascribed to the strong electrostatic interaction between the TMS+ and [PbI6]4− octahedra and the absence of hydrogen bonding between the TMS+ and water molecules.43

The variation in the relative reaction energies (ΔE) of the various perovskite reactants (MAPbI3, FAPbI3, CsPbI3, and TMSPbI3), with respect to the possible TS, IM, and P, over the reaction coordinate during the decomposition reactions by water molecules was analyzed by DFT calculations. It is well known that the decomposition of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 begins with and is facilitated by the hydrogen bonding interaction between MA+/FA+ and water molecules, as suggested by reactions (1) and (2) (R denotes the reactant), respectively. The corresponding variation of ΔE, together with the optimized geometries of reactions, is summarized in Fig. 6.3,5 (CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O) (R) → (CH3NH2⋯H+⋯H2O + PbI3−) (TS1) → (CH3NH2⋯OH3+ + PbI3−) (IM) → (CH3NH2 + OH2⋯H+⋯I−⋯PbI2) (TS2) → (CH3NH2 + HI + H2O + PbI2) (P)(1) (NH2CHNH2PbI3 + H2O) (R) → (NH2CHNH⋯H+⋯H2O + PbI3−) (TS1) → (N2CH4 + OH3+ + PbI3−) (IM) → (N2CH4 + OH2⋯H+⋯I−⋯PbI2) (TS2) → (N2CH4 + HI + H2O + PbI2) (P)(2)

In brief, the formation of the first TS (TS1) required an activation energy (Ea1) of 16.46 kcal mol−1 for the hydrogen bonding interaction between MAPbI3 and water molecules and 13.66, 31.14, and 29.14 kcal mol−1 for the IM, TS2 (Ea2 = 17.48 kcal mol−1), and the final P, respectively. The corresponding values for FAPbI3 were 25.30, 17.06, 35.30, and 33.08 kcal mol−1 for TS1, IM, TS2, and P, respectively. FAPbI3 has two hydrogen bonding donor atoms. Meanwhile, the ΔEa1 for the TS1 of FAPbI3 decomposition is 8.84 kcal mol−1 higher than that of MAPbI3. This result could be attributable to the structural resonance stabilization effect of the FA+ cation (ESI, Fig. S9†), which provides FAPbI3 with better moisture stability than MAPbI3. This suggests that FAPbI3 has better moisture stability than MAPbI3, which is consistent with the experimental and theoretical observations reported elsewhere.5,63
The decomposition of TMSPbI3 was similarly analyzed by DFT calculations with the assumption that it is also initiated by chemical interactions between the sulfur atom of TMS+ with hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water molecule. Considering the minute difference in the electronegativity between sulfur and hydrogen atoms (ca. 0.4), it is more appropriate to consider that the electrostatic interaction between the sulfur in TMS+ and oxygen in water might be the main initiator for the decomposition reaction of TMSPbI3, with the final decomposition products of (CH3)2S, CH3I, and PbI2, as shown in reaction (3). The very weak interaction with the water molecules leads to a somewhat large Ea as high as 51.10 kcal mol−1 for the TS of the TMSPbI3 decomposition reaction (Fig. 6). This value is substantially larger than those of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 and was slightly smaller than the corresponding value for the CsPbI3 decomposition reaction. [(CH3)3SPbI3 + H2O] (R) → [PbI2⋯I−⋯CH3⋯(CH3)2S+⋯H2O] (TS) → [PbI2 + CH3I + (CH3)2S + H2O] (P)(3)
The Ea value for the TS of CsPbI3 decomposition by water was calculated to be ca. 59.93 kcal mol−1, as shown in reaction (4) and Fig. 6. This value is the largest among the lead iodide-based perovskites, and it is attributable to the absence of the hydrogen bonding type interaction of CsPbI3 with the water molecule. It is also consistent with the remarkable enhancement of the moisture stability of CsPbI3 compared with other organic lead iodide-based perovskites as reported elsewhere.64,65 Overall, the Ea value of the TMSPbI3 decomposition process was much larger than those of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 but close to that of CsPbI3. This trend was consistent with the moisture stability of perovskite materials. The enhanced stability of the sulfur-containing perovskite TMSPbI3 could be attributed to the decreased interaction with the water molecule. (CsPbI3) + H2O) (R) → (PbI2⋯I−⋯H+⋯OH−⋯Cs+) (TS) → (PbI2 + HI + CsOH) (P)(4)
4. Conclusions
In summary, PSCs were fabricated with TMSPbI3 with a device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/TMSPbI3/CuSCN/Au and showed improved stability under ambient atmospheric conditions (25 ± 3 °C and 50 ± 5% RH) for 500 h without encapsulation and exhibited a PCE loss of only ca. 4.6%. Furthermore, the nanorod arrays of TMSPbI3 displayed an unaltered morphology and crystal structure under ambient conditions for 50 days. DFT calculations revealed that the Ea of the TMSPbI3 decomposition process was much higher than those of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 and slightly lower than that of CsPbI3, suggesting that the suppression of the hydrogen bonding capability of the organic cation is an important controlling factor in enhancing the moisture stability of perovskites. Additionally, the strong electrostatic interaction between the TMS+ and [PbI6]4− octahedra is another possible reason for the high moisture stability of TMSPbI3.43 The overall PCE for TMSPbI3-based PSCs was 2.22% after the optimization. Despite this relatively low efficiency compared with the highly efficient organoammonium lead halide-based PSCs such as MAPbX3/FAPbX3 and various PSCs with mixed halides (e.g., MAPbI3−xXx, where X = Cl, Br)8,18,19,51 as well as some cells with multiple cations,21–24 it might be improved further by developing a better kinetic and thermodynamic control for homogeneous film growth of TMSPbI3 by both solvent and additive engineering since the Shockley–Queisser limit of Jsc for TMSPbI3 is 8.64 mA cm−2 at 25 °C under AM 1.5G spectral irradiance conditions. This study provides novel insight into the benefits of introducing a sulfur-containing organic cation, such as TMS+ instead of the conventional nitrogen-based organic cations, for enhancing the stability of PSCs. Moreover, TMSPbI3 and TMS+ cations can be used as a reliable passivation layer at the conventional perovskites/HTL interface and as a potential candidate to prepare mixed multi-cation-based perovskites with multiple dimensions and high moisture stability.
