    , Accepted 10th December 2012First published on 10th December 2012AbstractA new A–D–A small molecule (SM) based on a 3,6-dithienylcarbazole donor unit at the center and nitrophenyl acrylonitrile acceptor units as the terminal ends was synthesized by the Pd catalyzed Stille coupling reaction for application as a donor material in the organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. The SM possesses a low lying HOMO energy level at −5.34 eV and optical band gap of 1.74 eV. The photovoltaic performance of the SM was investigated with PC60BM and PC70BM as acceptors cast from THF with 3% CN additive and without additive. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the organic solar cells based on SM:PC60BM cast from THF solvent reached 1.94% with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 6.08 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.34, where as the PCE of SM:PC70BM cast from THF solvent was 2.65% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 7.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.38%, under the illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The higher PCE of the organic solar cells based on PC70BM as an electron acceptor has been attributed to its strong absorption in the visible region than PC60BM. The PCE of the organic solar cells has been further improved to 3.76% and 4.96% for SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM, respectively, cast with CN–THF solvent.
Introduction
Solution processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising cost effective alternative for utility of solar energy converters, and possess the advantages of being light weight, low cost and flexible.1 In recent years, efforts have been intensively focused on improving device performance towards achievement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10%. Research has mainly been concerned with further development of active materials such as conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives or functional layers such as buffering, charge transporting and optical spacing layers.2 Recently the encouraging PCEs in the range of 7–10% have been achieved from bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on conjugated polymer donors and fullerene acceptors and has rendered OSCs strong candidates for next generation solar cells over the inorganic thin film solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells.3 Despite this significant progress, further increasing the PCE over 15% is needed for OSCs to compete with silicon solar cells and other thin film solar cell technologies for commercialization. The thermodynamic efficiency limit of OSC is 22–27%.4 Most of these efficiencies have been reported in OSCs fabricated with BHJ active layers composed of low band gap conjugated polymers and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 (or 71)-butyric acid methyl ester (C61(or 71)-PCBM).5 Generally, polymers have many advantages such as strong absorption ability, admirable solution processability, good film forming ability and tunable energy levels. However, the polymer donor materials always suffer from batch to batch variation, difficulty of purification and broad molecular weight distributions. The impurity and relatively high molecular weight dispersity significantly decreases the charge carrier mobility of polymers and further lead to a relatively low fill factor and PCE of the photovoltaic devices.6
To overcome these issues, solution processed small molecules (SMs) for BHJ OSCs, combining the advantages of purity, well defined structure and molecular weight, no batch to batch variations and easily tunable band gap and energy levels have stimulated more and more attention.7 Moreover, the intramolecular associations, which can assist with charge transport, are also typically stronger in SMs than in polymeric materials.7 So far, significant progress has been made and PCEs of 4–7% have been achieved for OSCs with SM as the donor.8 This PCE is always below that of their polymer counterpart. In most cases, devices based on solution processed small molecules, always seem to have poorer film quality than their polymer counterparts, in the BHJ active layer.8 Thus it is expected that a better PCE can be achieved if the intrinsic poor film quality and morphology in the BHJ active layer could be improved. However, in order to achieve this, careful molecular design has to be carried out to address many factors simultaneously, including the material solar light absorption associated with its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, mobility, film forming quality and morphology compatibility with acceptors.
Push–pull chromophores involving electron donating (D) and electron accepting (A) groups have been widely investigated for use in OSCs. This type of molecular structure can lower the material band gap and extend the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths, and the same time the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be tuned effectively.9 Continuing our research work on small molecule for BHJ organic solar cells, herein we have synthesized a small molecule end capped with 2-(4-nitrophenyl) acrylonitrile as an electron acceptor and central 3,6-dithienyl carbozole as an electron donor unit and used it as electron donor along with different fullerene derivatives as an electron acceptor for the fabrication of BHJ organic solar cells. The PCE of the devices based on SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM cast from THF solvent were 1.94% and 2.65%, respectively. In addition, we have investigated the effect of the solvent additive used for spin casting of SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM blend film and found that the device based on solvent additive has increased the PCE significantly and yielded a PCE of 3.76% and 4.96%, respectively for the CN-additive processed BHJ active layers.

Characterization methods

1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were obtained using a Bruker spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ values) are given in parts per million with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.
The electrochemical properties i.e. onset oxidation potential and reduction potentials of SM, were examined by cyclic voltammetry. We used an electrochemical cell with a conventional three electrode assembly and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acting as the electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile solution. SM was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode which was used as the working electrode, while Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry measurement at room temperature was performed at a 100 mV s−1 scan rate. The optical absorption spectra of SM in solution and thin films, and blend in thin films were measured using a Perkin Elmer UV-visible spectrophotometer.
Device fabrication and characterization
The organic solar cells were prepared on a commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sandwiched structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC60BM or PC70BM/Al. Prior to use, the patterned ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned with deionised water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, using ultrasonication and then dried in an ambient atmosphere. A thin layer (about 60 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayon, Germany) was spin coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 100 °C for 10 min. Blends of SM and fullerene derivates in different weight ratios from 1:05 to 1:4 w/w) were dissolved for 6 h in THF (concentration 10 mg mL−1) solution and subsequently spin coated at 1500 rpm for 60 s on to the PEDOT:PSS layer of ITO coated glass. The deposition of all organic layers was carried out in ambient atmosphere. The thickness of the photoactive layer is about 80–85 nm. Aluminium (Al) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photoactive layer under a vacuum of 10−5 Torr. The active area of the devices is about 5 mm2.
To prepare the film from the additive solvent, a blend solution was prepared by dissolving SM and the fullerene derivative in a host solvent, i.e. THF, and then small amounts of processing additives were incorporated and the solution was stirred on a hot plate at 60 °C for 4 h. The blend solution was cooled to room temperature prior to spin coating deposition.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices was measured with a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter unit. A halogen lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the light source and the optical power at the surface of the device was 100 mW cm−2. All the measurements were carried out under ambient conditions.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured using a monochromator and 100 W halogen lamp as the light source and the resulting current was measured with a computer controlled Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions. The intensity of each wavelength was kept constant.
To measure the electron mobility in the BHJ active layer, this layer was sandwiched between the top and bottom Al electrodes acting as the injecting electrode and the electron collecting electrode, respectively. For hole mobility measurement, the BHJ layer was sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS coated ITO as the hole injecting electrode and Au as the hole collecting electrode. The mobilities were extracted by fitting the J–V characteristics in space charge limited region.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of SM

Scheme 1 outlines the five-step synthesis of SM. In particular, carbazole was brominated by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF to afford 3,6-dibromocarbazole (1). The Stille coupling of 1 with 2-tributylstannylthiophene in the presence of a palladium catalyst gave 2. The latter reacted with formic acid to afford aldehyde 3. Compound 3 was further formylated by means of DMF and POCl3 to give trialdehyde 4. The condensation of 4 with 4-nitrobenzyl cyanide in the presence of NaOH afforded the target SM. This small molecule and all the intermediate compounds were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Optical and electrochemical properties of SM

Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of the SM in THF solution and thin film form. The absorption spectra of SM showed two absorption bands in the wavelength region 400–800 nm. The absorption band observed in the longer wavelength region results from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the central di-thienyl carbazole donor unit and the terminal acceptor groups present in the SM, originating from HOMO → LUMO monoexcitations. The absorption band observed at the 400–500 nm could be assigned to π–π* transitions.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of SM in THF solution and in thin film form cast from THF solution. 
The absorption spectrum of SM in the film state (also shown in Fig. 1) shows an obvious broadening bathochromic shift of 42 nm in the longer wavelength band compared to the solution spectra. Such a spectral change is typically attributed to planarization of the conjugated backbone and stronger π–π interactions in the solid state.13 The solid state absorption of conjugated materials is primarily determined by conformation and molecular packing.14 The thin film absorption spectra of SM also showed a well defined vibronic shoulder around 656 nm, indicating an effective π–π packing between the molecule backbones in the solid state.15 This is similar to what is seen in regioregular semiconducting polymers such as P3HT16 and some conjugated small molecules,15 and is indicate of effective π-stacking and strong intermolecular interaction in the film.17 The optical band gap of SM estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra in the thin film was found to be 1.74 eV.
The electrochemical properties of SM and its HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and we have observed that the onset reduction potential (Eonsetred) and the onset oxidation potential (Eonsetoxd) were −1.49 V and 0.63 V (vs. NHE). The HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO (ELUMO) energy levels and electrochemical bandgap (Eelecg) of SM were estimated from the following expressions18  
The values of EHOMO and ELUMO as well as Eelecg of the SM are −5.34 eV, −3.2 eV, and 2.14 eV, respectively, calculated from above expressions. The bandgap estimated CV is higher than that obtained from the absorption spectrum in thin film, which is commonly observed in most of the conjugated polymers and small molecules.19 The LUMO level of the SM is higher than that of PC60BM or PC70BM (−3.9 eV);20 the LUMO gap between the donor and acceptor is enough larger than the binding energy of exciton i.e. 0.3–0.4 eV) to guarantee photoinduced electron transfer between them. The difference between the HOMO of donor and LUMO of the acceptor is as large as 1.44 eV, which could lead to high open circuit voltage for BHJ solar cells using SM as the donor and fullerene as the acceptor, since the Voc is mainly determined by this difference.
DFT computation
We have performed theoretical calculations to understand the electronic structure of SM and to elucidate the origin of possible vertical transitions, by using the Gaussian 09W21 (Revision-A.02) program suite. The geometries of the dye in a vacuum were optimized using density functional theory (DFT)22 with the hybrid B3LYP23 density functional and the 6-31G* basis set. Optimized geometry was subjected to vibrational analysis, and characterized as a minimum due to the absence of imaginary frequencies. The time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)24 calculations were carried out at the same theory level to determine at least 10 vertical excitations to the excited state of SM.
The computed vertical excitation and frontier orbital energies, oscillator strengths for electronic excitations and compositions of vertical transitions in terms of molecular orbitals are listed in Table 1. The electronic distributions observed for selected molecular orbitals contributing significantly to the prominent electronic excitations in the SM are presented in Fig. 2. They mainly originate due to the electronic excitations HOMO to LUMO, HOMO − 1 to LUMO and HOMO − 1 to LUMO + 1. Since in the HOMO and HOMO − 1 of the dye the electronic distribution occurs over the electron donating 3,6-dithienylcarbazole unit and the electron delocalization in LUMO and LUMO + 1 is spread over the electron-accepting nitrophenyl acrylonitrile units. The HOMO and LUMO values estimated are also shown in Table 1 and these values are in good agreement with the experimentally estimated from CV measurement.

Photovoltaic properties
To probe the photoinduced charge transfer from the donor SM to the acceptor, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the SM and its blends with fullerene derivatives were measured and shown in Fig. 3. The pristine SM film exhibited an emission band with an emission maximum at 830 nm. For the SM:fullerene blend films, emission intensity exhibited significant quenching (about 90%). This indicates a photo induced charge transfer from the SM donor to the fullerene acceptors, which is highly favorable for competing with radiative recombination of the excitons. The emission intensity for the SM:PC70BM is slightly more quenched, indicating that the photo induced charge transfer in this BHJ active layer is more efficient.
 Fig. 3  Photoluminescence spectra of SM, SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM. 
To demonstrate the potential application of the SM in OSCs, we used SM as an electron donor and PC60BM and PC70BM as an electron acceptor and fabricated the BHJ OSCs with a structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC60BM or PC70BM/Al, consisting of different donor–acceptor weight ratios. It is found that the Voc is almost insensitive to the weight ratio, while the Jsc is strongly dependent on the donor to acceptor weight ratio in the active layer. The donor:acceptor ratio of 1:1 gave the best performance. The current–voltage characteristics of the BHJ OSC based on SM:PCBM with a weight ratio 1:1 are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device with SM:PC60BM yielded a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 6.08 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.34, resulting in a PCE of 1.94%. In contrast, the device with SM:PC70BM with same weight ratio shows a higher photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 7.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.38, yielding an overall PCE of 2.65%. The increase in the PCE for the device based on PC70BM as the electron acceptor is mainly due to the enhancement of the Jsc and FF, attributed the stronger absorption of PC70BM than PC60BM, below 500 nm. The broader absorption band of SM:PC70BM as compared to SM:PC60BM leads to the absorption of more photons by the former active layer, generating more excitons in the active layer in the device based on SM:PC70BM, resulting in higher Jsc. The almost same value of Voc is related to the same value of LUMO level of both the fullerene derivatives, since the Voc is related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of donor and LUMO level of acceptor employed in BHJ active layer.

The low values of PCEs of these BHJ organic solar cells may be due to the poor nanoscale interpenetrating morphology of the BHJ active layer. In organic BHJ solar cells based on conjugated polymer and small molecules, the morphology of the D–A BHJ active layer is of critical importance to their high PCE.25 For an efficient solar cell, the excitons generated on the D and A material used in the active layer must be able to diffuse to the D–A interface where they can be dissociate into free electrons and free holes. Therefore, an interpenetrating network of D and A phases is then required for the transport of the electron and hole to the respective collecting electrode. Moreover, the hole and electron mobilities must be sufficiently high and there ratio must be unity for balance and efficient charge transport. For these requirements, a phase separated morphology consisting of interpenetrating and interconnected D and A domains that are of the order of 10–30 nm is ideal for efficient solar cell.26 It is well known that the solvent additive (SA) i.e. addition of relatively small amount of high boiling point solvents, can have tremendous impact on the morphology of the BHJ active layer and hence affecting the photovoltaic performance of the device.27 The use of SA has also been employed for BHJ solar cells based on small molecules to improve the PCE.28Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM based devices fabricated with solvent additive (SA), CN (3% by volume) and photovoltaic parameters are complied in table. Both the devices showed increase in photovoltaic performance. The device with SM:PC60BM showed a PCE of 3.76% with a Jsc of 9.73 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V and FF of 0.42. The PCE of the device based on SM:PC70BM reaches 4.96% with Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V and FF of 0.48. The value of Jsc has been drastically enhanced with the SA treatment without significant loss in Voc. Moreover the FF has also increased upon the SA treatment. Therefore, the enhancement in the PCE, upon SA treatment is mainly as a result of increased Jsc and FF. We have observed from the J–V characteristics of the devices in dark that the devices fabricated with CN additives have a higher value for the rectification ratio and smaller value for Rs, estimated from the J–V characteristics of the devices measured in dark compared to those made without SA and may be attributed to the enhancement in the Jsc and FF. We have observed that the J–V dark currents in the reverse bias and low forward voltages is lower for device with SA as compared to the device without SA, indicates that the recombination has been reduced with the SA processing of the BHJ active layer.

The X-ray diffraction method has been widely used to determine the structural ordering of the donor–acceptor blend thin films.29 To investigate the structural ordering of SM:PC70BM in the solid state, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on thin film spin coated on to glass substrates from THF and CN–THF solutions and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, SM:PC70BM display Bragg reflection (100) peak at 2θ = 9.28° (stronger peak) and 2θ = 19.82° (relatively low intensity), that indicate the presence of crystalline domains. When the SM:PC70BM blend is cast from the THF solvent low degree of ordering as evident from the appearance of weak broad reflection at 2θ = 9.28°. The lack of sufficient crystallinity and phase separation within the BHJ layer may be attributed to the low value of PCE.30 However, when the blend film is cast from CN–THF mixed solvent, the intensity of diffraction peak corresponds 2θ = 9.28° indicating the more organized assembly of the SM with the addition of CN additive. Since THF is not a good solvent for fullerene derivatives and the CN is good solvent for both PC60BM and PC70BM, therefore the addition of CN as SA help the crystallinity of SM due to the solubility of fullerene derivatives in CN. This indicates that the addition of CN improves the crystallinity and phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials in the BHJ layer, which leads to an enhancement in the PCE of the device.

To understand the influence of charge carrier transport on the photovoltaic performance, we have used the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique to measure the hole and electron mobility in the BHJ layer processed from THF and CN–THF solvent. In order to satisfy the SCLC conditions, hole only devices and electron only devices with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC70BM/Au and Al/SM:PC70BM/Al, respectively were fabricated. These devices form Ohmic contacts at low voltage, as confirmed by the linear current–voltage relationship with slope of unity and quadratic behavior at SCLC regime (slope two). The zero field mobility of charge carrier mobilities in the BHJ active layer have been measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique, given by modified Mott–Gurney's Law:  where J is the current density at the SCL regime, d is the thickness of the active layer, μ is the zero field mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blend (assuming that 3.5), ε0 is the permittivity of the free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), β is the field activation factor and V is the applied voltage. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices are plotted in the form of ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)1/2 and shown in Fig. 7a and b for the hole only device and electron only device, respectively. From the analysis of these plots and the equation we have estimated the charge carrier mobilities in the BHJ active layer processed from THF and with a solvent additive. The hole and electron mobilities for the BHJ active layer processed from THF solvent are 5.87 × 10−7 cm2 V s−1 and 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1, respectively. However, with the addition of a solvent additive (CN), the hole mobility has been increased to 2.38 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1 but the electron mobility has been decreased to 9.8 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1. It can be seen from the absorption spectra of the SM:PCBM processed with additives, the vibronic peak is enhanced indicating that after the SA the more ordered film could be the result of enhanced π–π stacking. Thus SA leads to hole mobility enhanced by a factor of 40. However, the increase in the order to the donor phase probably causes decrease in the order of the acceptor phase, which leads to electron mobility reduction by a factor of 3. Similar results have been observed for the device with PC60BM as electron acceptor. The simultaneous increase and decrease in the hole mobility and electron mobility, respectively, lead to a more balanced hole and electron transport after the addition of SA is beneficial to enhancement in both Jsc and FF, and consequently the overall PCE of the organic solar cells.

In the organic solar cells based on the BHJ active layer, the morphology of the active layer plays an important role in the PCE of the device. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of the SM:PC70BM BHJ films cast from THF and CN–THF solvents obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM). The rms values of the surface roughness are 5.23 nm and 3.96 nm for SM:PC70BM blend film cast from the THF and CN–THF, respectively. Similar results were also observed for SM:PC60BM blend films. The large value of surface roughness and phase separation for the THF cast film is not sufficient for efficient dissociation of the excitons into free charge carrier, leading to low Jsc. Since CN is a good solvent for PCBM and therefore evidence for the large scale phase separation is provided by the smaller surface roughness observed in AFM images for SM:PC70BM cast from CN–THF solvent. The smaller roughness value and improved value phase separation for the BHJ active layer contributes to the increase in the interfacial D–A area leads to more efficient charge separation, resulting higher PCE.

The FF of these organic solar cells based on SM is low which is due to the miscibility of SM with fullerenes and lower hole mobility of SM due to the weaker intermolecular interaction in the non-planar carbazole containing small molecule. For a balance charge transport in the organic BHJ device, the ratio between the electron and hole mobility should be almost unity. In the present devices this ratio is greater than unity, even employing SA. Therefore, while designing small molecules for high FF and PCE for solution processed BHJ organic solar cells, in addition to their high charge mobility and Voc, other factors, such as maximizing their solar absorption, achieving better film quality and appropriate HOMO and LUMO positions, should be taken into consideration. The synthesis of other classes of unsymmetrical A–D–A small molecules with different conjugated systems and acceptors may also increase the FF.
Conclusion
In summary, an A–D–A small molecule with a 3,6-dithienylcarbazole D unit and nitrophenyl acrylonitrile acceptor (A) units has been designed, synthesized and employed as a donor along with fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ solar cells. A PCE of 1.65% and 2.65% was obtained from the SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM, respectively, processed from THF solvent. The PCE has been further improved up to 3.76% and 4.96%, for SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM, respectively, when CN as the solvent additive was added to the blend solution.
