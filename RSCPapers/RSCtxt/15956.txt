    , Accepted 4th November 2020First published on 5th November 2020AbstractNew photocatalysts have been synthesized with inorganic clusters of polyoxometalates (POMs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) under hydrothermal conditions. In this research, for the first time, a Preyssler-type polyoxometalate (Na14[NaP5W30O110]·xH2O) with g-C3N4 was applied to design P5W30/g-C3N4, and photoelectrocatalytic water splitting with a g-C3N4/P5W30 photoanode was investigated. All of applied characterization methods verified the preparation of g-C3N4 nanorods and the successful compositing of POMs with g-C3N4. The photoelectrocatalytic results reveal that the photocurrent density of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), of around 44 μA cm−2, is greater than those of g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), or P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1). The lower slope of the transient open circuit potential decay for P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) in comparison with other photocatalysts demonstrates more efficient separation and lower recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers. Also, the constant photocurrent density in chronoamperometry analysis confirms a stable photoelectrocatalytic performance during three cycles under light irradiation for all of the prepared photoanodes. Mott–Schottky plots displayed a deeper band bending for P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) compared to that of g-C3N4, implying a greater charge carrier density, which leads to greater electron accumulation on its surface and simplifies electron transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.
Introduction
The energy crisis and concerns about pollution have provided extremely important reasons to explore alternative energy sources and design potential solutions for the detoxification of air and water.1 Photocatalysis due to its environmentally friendly nature, high potential in the degradation of toxic pollutants, and the generation of hydrogen fuels as a green energy source by exploiting solar energy, is one of the most appropriate processes with which to approach this aim.2–7 Polymeric graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted attention as one of the most explored photocatalysts due to its thermal and chemical stability, facile synthesis, suitable band gap, low cost and non-toxicity.8–11 g-C3N4 is an appropriate candidate for photocatalytic water splitting and solar degradation of organic contaminants.12–14 The reaction mechanism of water splitting with g-C3N4 has been investigated in the literature using density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which has been used to propose that there are preferred sites for proton reduction and water oxidation to generate H2 and O2, respectively.15–20 However, the photocatalytic performance of pure g-C3N4 is limited by the high recombination rate of its photo-generated charge carriers and the deficiency of surface active sites that reduce light absorption.21–23 To improve photocatalytic efficiency, a variety of strategies such as a junction of g-C3N4 with metals and other semiconductors,24–31 the design of nano-porous structures32 and heteroatom doping9,33 have been applied to modify the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. Among these strategies, the production of heterojunction composites has attracted more attention to advance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4.24,34–40 In this research, there were attempts to explore the compositing effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) on the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4.41–43 POMs are a class of metal–oxygen clusters, in which the metals are connected together by shared oxygen atoms.44,45 They differ in composition, charge, shape, and reactivity. Moreover, numerous applications have been reported for different POM structures.46,47 POMs have been widely employed as photocatalysts for a number of reasons, including strong light absorption, being extremely redox-active, and high structural stability during photoredox processes.48 POMs should be ideal electron acceptors that can be used as trapped electron centers due to their high number of metal centers. When POMs connect to other semiconductors, a suitable photocatalyst is constructed that inhibits the high recombination rate of photo-induced electrons and holes.49 Accordingly, the combination of POMs with g-C3N4 can reduce some of the inherent drawbacks of g-C3N4 by decreasing charge recombination and enhancing light absorption.50 Some heterojunction composites of g-C3N4 and POM have been reported to increase the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4, such as H3PW12O40/mpg-C3N4,51 g-C3N4-SiW11,52 POMs/g-C3N4,40 and polyoxometalate@g-C3N4.53 Herein, for the first time, g-C3N4 was composited with an anion cluster ((NaP5W30O110)−14 denoted (P5W30)) as a more efficient electron trapping agent for improving photocatalytic performance. In the first stage, the precursors were synthesized and then composited. P5W30/g-C3N4 was characterized by applying X-ray diffractions (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. Finally, the photoelectrochemical performance of these compounds was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient open circuit potential (OCP), transient photocurrent response (TPC), and Mott–Schottky analysis.
Experimental details
All chemicals were analytical grade and applied without further purification.
Preparation of the nanomaterials
The cluster P5W30 was prepared according to reports in the literature.54 Briefly, a mixture of Na2WO4·2H2O (4.95 g), water (5 ml), and H3PO4 (4 ml) was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated for 12 h at 120 °C. After cooling the resulting mixture to room temperature, a mixture of water and KCl was added to it, affording a precipitate. The final mixture was filtered and washed with potassium acetate and methanol. The collected precipitate was re-dissolved in hot water and finally, while the solution was cooling to room temperature, white crystals formed.
g-C3N4 powder was prepared by heating 4 g of melamine in an alumina crucible for 4 h to 555 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and subjected to 555 °C for 4 h prior to cooling. The yellowish product was prepared and ground into powder.55
For the synthesis of the P5W30/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, the g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by adding 1 g of bulk g-C3N4 powder to 20 ml water and sonicating the mixture using a 500 W ultrasonic crasher for 1 h at room temperature. Different amounts of P5W30 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 g) were dissolved in 15 ml of HCl (2 mol l−1). Then the P5W30/HCl solution was continuously added into the above suspension. After stirring for 1 h at ambient temperature, the resulting mixture was transferred to an autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C for 24 h. After cooling, the mixture was centrifuged and washed several times with an adequate amount of water and then dried at 50 °C for 8 h. The final prepared photocatalysts were denoted P5W30/g-C3N4 (x:y), where x:y indicates the mass ratio of P5W30 to g-C3N4.
Photoelectrode fabrication
The photoelectrode fabrication involves two steps of depositing the blocking layer and the photocatalyst layer including g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1). An FTO (F-doped SnO2)/glass substrate (1 × 2 cm−2) was washed in a series of liquid soap, isopropanol, acetone, ethanol and deionized water for each solvent (15 min) in an ultrasound bath. First, a transparent layer of TiO2 (the blocking layer) was coated on the FTO substrate,. For this coating, 50 μl of an ethanol solution comprising titanium isopropoxide (0.2 mol l−1) and HCl (0.2 mol l−1) was deposited by a spin coater at 1000 rpm for 120 s; then it was calcined in air at 400 °C for 45 min. The photocatalysts were placed on the FTO/TiO2via an electrophoretic deposition technique. In order to do this, 50 mg of g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), or P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) in 30 ml of acetone were suspended in an ultrasound bath for 20 min. Next, 8 mg of iodine was added to the above suspension. This supernatant was applied for coating. In the electrophoretic deposition method, a Pt plate and FTO/TiO2 were employed as an anode and cathode, respectively. Two parallel electrodes were submerged in the suspension. After that, at a bias voltage of 60 V, the FTO/TiO2 was deposited with g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N (0.5:1), or P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) for 60 s. Ultimately, the attained photoelectrode was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a standard three-electrode setup by means of a computer-controlled electrochemistry potentiostat under xenon lighting (400 W) equipped with a UV filter (400 nm). Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All determined potentials were standardized to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 × pH(1)
The photoelectrochemical performance of the photoelectrode was evaluated in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.5). For linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), the potential was swept by applying the potentials from negative to positive (scan rate of 10 mV s−1). The transient photocurrent response (TPC) was attained at 1.23 V vs. RHE and recorded for 11 min as on–off light. For the open circuit potential (OCP), initially, the work electrodes were steadied for 30 s under visible light irradiation. Then, the light was switched off. The OCP decay was determined during 100 s. The Mott–Schottky plots were achieved with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and a frequency of 500 Hz over the potential range −0.6 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the dark.
Instrumentation
FT-IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Fourier spectrophotometer (USA) as KBr discs. The crystal structure of the nanomaterials was recorded using XRD with a Bruker/D8 ADVANCED diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 06 nm). The morphology of the nanomaterials was determined using TEM with a Leo 912AB microscope (Germany). FESEM and EDX were carried out with a MIRA3 TESCAN. The UV-vis spectra were collected by means of an Agilent photodiode-array (Model 8453) spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were investigated by a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrophotometer, and an Autolab potentiostat (Model PGSTAT302N) was used for photoelectrochemical measurements.
Results and discussion
Characterization

Fig. 1 indicates the XRD patterns of g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), and P5W30. According to the XRD patterns of g-C3N4 in Fig. 1, two diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 are located at 27.11° and 13.0° (indexed as (002) and (100), respectively). The less intense diffraction peak at 13.0° is assigned to the in-plane tri-s-triazine unit cells of g-C3N434,56 and the most intense peak at 27.11° is related to the stacking of layers in aromatic systems.57 [Environmental Science and Pollution Research 26 (2019) 30941–30953] In the XRD patterns of P5W30, the characteristic peaks of P5W30 were located at 18–22°, 24–26°, 27–30° and 33–40° assigned to the (012), (202), (420) and (511) crystal planes of P5W30 with an orthorhombic crystal system, respectively.51,58 Since the amounts of P5W30 clusters are relatively high in P5W30/g-C3N4, their diffraction patterns are more similar to the pattern of P5W30 cluster dispersion. Hence, as shown in Fig. 1 for the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) sample, the peaks of the inorganic cluster are stronger than those of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1).51,58

The IR spectra of P5W30, g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) are presented in Fig. 2. The characteristic bands of the polyoxometalates located in the region of 800–1100 cm−1 are revealed. These frequencies are related to the vibrations of P–O bonds of the PO4 unit, and the WO and the W–O–W bonds.59 Also, in the IR spectrum of g-C3N4, peaks appeared in the region of 1200–1600 cm−1 and 812 cm−1 due to the stretching and bending vibrations of CN at the heptazine ring units and a broad peak around 3170 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of NH2 and NH groups at the defect positions of the aromatic ring of g-C3N4 nanosheets, indicating the successful production of g-C3N4.55 According to the IR spectra of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), all the characteristic variations assigned to g-C3N4 and P5W30 can obviously be observed. The intensity of the characteristic peaks related to P5W30 in the IR spectrum of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) is more than that of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), which is due to the greater amount of P5W30 in the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) composite. These spectra verify the successful preparation of the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) structures.

To investigate morphology, structure and elemental analysis, FESEM, TEM, and EDS techniques were applied, as shown in Fig. 3. The pure g-C3N4 has an irregular sheet-like structure (Fig. 3a and c). Fig. 3b and d indicate that the morphology has changed from sheet-like for g-C3N4 to rod-like for P5W30/g-C3N4. However P5W30 cannot be observed so clearly in the TEM images, probably due to the lower amount and more homogeneous dispersion of P5W30 on g-C3N4.60 The elemental mapping results obviously confirm the presence of the materials, including tungsten, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and phosphor in the structure of the photocatalyst (Fig. 3e).

ICP-MS technique was applied to find the exact amount of W content in the P5W30/g-C3N4 composites. The W percentage in P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1) were estimated to be 5.49%, 4.17%, and 2.63%, respectively. Therefore, the calculated amounts of P5W30 in P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1) are 7.5%, 5.7%, and 3.8%, respectively.
Optical characteristics of the prepared nanomaterials were determined using UV-vis and PL spectrophotometry. The UV-vis spectra of P5W30, g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) are presented in Fig. 4a. The UV-vis spectrum of g-C3N4 displays a sharp band at 312 nm due to the electron transition of π–π*.61 As shown in Fig. 4a, the optical absorption capability of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) in comparison to P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), or P5W30 within the visible-light range has been significantly enhanced. The light absorption edges of P5W30, g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) were estimated to be about 335, 475, 405, 465, and 365 nm, respectively. This redshifted band absorption for P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) in comparison to P5W30 is ascribed to the synergistic effect between P5W30 and g-C3N4, leading to increased harvesting of visible light and thus higher photo-generation of electrons and holes.49 The energy band gaps of the prepared photocatalysts were calculated with Tauc's equation:62 αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(2)where α represents the absorption coefficient, ν is the light frequency, h is Planck's constant, A is a constant and Eg indicates band gap energy. The value of n can be 1 or 4, due to direct and indirect transitions, respectively. The value of 4 was assigned to g-C3N4 and P5W30/g-C3N4. The calculated quantities of Eg for P5W30, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), and g-C3N4 were 3.88, 3.60, 2.78, 3.11, and 2.74, respectively (Fig. 4b). A remarkable decrease in energy band gap for the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photocatalyst in comparison to P5W30 can be observed.

The PL emission is proposed as an effective way to investigate the generated electron–hole pair's efficiency for semiconductors. Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of pure g-C3N4 and different P5W30/g-C3N4 samples with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The PL intensity was used to indicate the amount of recombination of the photogenerated carriers. A lower PL intensity demonstrates less electron–hole recombination which results in higher photocatalytic performance.63,64 By combining POM with g-C3N4, the intensity of the peak is significantly reduced in comparison to pure g-C3N4. The lowest intensity PL spectrum belongs to the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photocatalyst.

Photoelectrochemical properties
The fabricated electrodes of g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) were employed as photoanodes. The photoelectrochemical responses for the oxygen evolution reaction at the photoanode semiconductor–liquid junction, as a function of applied potential are shown in Fig. 6. All fabricated photoelectrodes exhibited a tiny current density in the dark. The photocurrent density of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) begins from a potential of 0.21 V vs. RHE. Then, it increases to around 44 μA cm−2 at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. However, the photocurrent densities of g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) are around 18, 31, and 25 μA cm−2 at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. Ge et al.65 achieved a photocurrent density of about 8.0 μA cm−2 for pristine g-C3N4 and Dong et al.66 achieved a photocurrent density of about 19.0 μA cm−2 for a g-C3N4/NiO composite. Li et al.67 synthesized phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 and Au/phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 with a photocurrent densities of about 10.0 and 15.0 μA cm−2, respectively. A higher photocurrent density gives a strong propulsive force in the photoelectrochemical water splitting process.63 This enhancement in the photocurrent suggests that P5W30 could decrease the photo-induced recombination rate of charge carriers which was confirmed by the PL spectra (Fig. 5).63 This means that P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) generates more charge carriers.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent density vs. potential for g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) photoanodes. 
The first experiential photocurrent under lighting is specified as the turn-on voltage, Von, whose values are about 0.47 and 0.21 V for the g-C3N4 and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanodes, respectively (Fig. 6). Clearly, a cathodic shift is detected in Von for P5W30/g-C3N4 in comparison to g-C3N4. The lower potential of the P5W30/g-C3N4 photoanodes is more suitable for the oxygen evolution reaction.68
The transient OCP as a function of time was measured to consider the electron recombination rate.69 When the light source was turned off, a decrease in the OCP was detected because of the recombination of electrons and holes.63Fig. 7 displays the OCP decline over time for the g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) photoanodes. The OCP decline rate for the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode is obviously slower than those for the g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) photoanodes. Therefore, the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode compared with the other three photoanodes has a considerably slower recombination rate. Also, all the photoanodes are n-type as a consequence of the negative increase in voltage under lighting.70,71 So, the electrons are transported to the counter electrode. The difference in OCP in the dark and light defines the photovoltage produced at the photocatalyst/water interface (Table 1). The created photovoltage of the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode is larger than those of the g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), or P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) photoanodes, which confirms its higher photoelectric conversion capability. Thus, the presence of P5W30 in P5W30/g-C3N4 improves the photoelectrochemical performance. As indicated in Fig. 6 and 7, the most effective photoanode is P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) since it has the best values of photocurrent density, Von, and OCP (Table 1).

To consider the performance of the photoanode, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was computed: (3)where Jph, Vb, and Pin are the photocurrent density, applied bias, and incident illumination power density (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), respectively. The dependence of ABPE (%) on the applied bias potential for the photoanodes is shown in Fig. 8. Outstanding efficiency could be perceived with P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) compared with g-C3N4, reaching 0.214% at 0.56 V against 0.062% at 0.70 V, respectively. Moreover, the maximum efficiency of all the P5W30/g-C3N4 photoanodes is accessible at a lower potential by comparison with the g-C3N4 photoanode.
 Fig. 8  Intrinsic power to chemical conversion efficiency for different photoanodes. 
In an effort to explore the charge transfer and extraction, the photo response of the fabricated photoanodes under lighting was considered.72,73Fig. 9 exhibits the transient photocurrent responses for the g-C3N4, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.1:1), P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1), and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.5:1) photoanodes in three on–off lighting cycles. As anticipated, all the photoanodes indicate an obvious current under light irradiation, followed by a rapid decrease in current to close zero after the light is turned off. A constant photocurrent density was detected in three cycles under light irradiance, indicating stable photoelectrochemical activity for all the photoanodes. Among the above photoanodes, P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) shows the highest photocurrent density. The enhanced photocurrent response and lesser slope of OCP decay (after the light was turned off) of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) compared with the other three photoanodes authenticated the improved charge transfer ability and diminished charge recombination rate for P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1).

The intrinsic electronic properties, including the carrier density, Nd, and the flat band potential, Vfb, were investigated by Mott–Schottky analysis. The flat band potentials were extracted from the linear part of the x-axis intercept of the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 10a). The flat band potential values of the g-C3N4 and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) electrodes were −0.37 and −0.58 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The negative alteration in the flat band potential specifies a larger carrier density for the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) electrode and so, more effective charge transfer for this electrode compared with that of g-C3N4.63 Moreover, this negative alteration of Vfb shows the bending of the band edge of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) owing to the facilitated electron transfer being greater than that of g-C3N4 at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Also, the slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots are positive, indicating the n-type semiconductor characteristics of the prepared photocatalysts. The flat band potential is normally related to the Fermi level and for n-type semiconductors, it is located under the conduction band (CB) edge. The CB energy level when Ag/AgCl is the reference, was calculated using the following equation:74 ECB = −e(4.71 + Vfb)(4)where e is the reduced electron charge and is equal to 1. The energy level of the valence band edge, EVB was determined with the equation EVB= ECB− Eg. Fig. 10b exhibits the band diagrams of g-C3N4 and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1). This figure indicates the better position of P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) with respect to g-C3N4 for water splitting.

The charge carrier densities of the fabricated electrodes were calculated from the slope of the linear region of the Mott–Schottky plots:74 (5)where  is the slope of the linear region. e0, ε0, and ε are the electron charge, the permittivity of a vacuum, and the dielectric constant of the semiconductor 9.58 for g-C3N4,63 respectively. The Nd values for the g-C3N4 and P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) electrodes were obtained as 1.46 × 1010 and 1.53 × 1010 cm−3, respectively. The higher photocurrent density for P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) was ascribed to its higher carrier density. Functionalization with an optimum amount of P5W30 in the g-C3N4 structure could prevent the recombination of charge carries and hence it would help provide more electron transfer for water splitting.
Conclusions
In summary, new photocatalysts, P5W30/g-C3N4 were synthesized by compositing POMs (P5W30) with g-C3N4. P5W30/g-C3N4 NRs were successfully synthesized. The photoelectrochemical results showed that P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) has an enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison to pure g-C3N4 and other P5W30/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode showed an improved photocurrent density of 44 μA cm−2 at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE with respect to 18 μA cm−2 for pristine g-C3N4. The photoconversion efficiency for the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode is 3.45 times greater than that of g-C3N4 and was achieved at a lower potential. The notable photoelectrocatalytic performance of the P5W30/g-C3N4 (0.3:1) photoanode is related to its deeper band bending and its outstanding trapping skill for electrons which leads to a higher separation and transfer of photo-induced charge carriers.
