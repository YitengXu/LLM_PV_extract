Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by hydrogen is catalysed by a [C,N] cyclometalated organoiridium complex, [IrIII(Cp*)(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κN2)benzoic acid-κC3)(OH2)]2SO4 [Ir–OH2]2SO4, under atmospheric pressure of H2 and CO2 in weakly basic water (pH 7.5) at room temperature. The reverse reaction, i.e., hydrogen evolution from formate, is also catalysed by [Ir–OH2]+ in acidic water (pH 2.8) at room temperature. Thus, interconversion between hydrogen and formic acid in water at ambient temperature and pressure has been achieved by using [Ir–OH2]+ as an efficient catalyst in both directions depending on pH. The Ir complex [Ir–OH2]+ also catalyses regioselective hydrogenation of the oxidised form of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to produce the 1,4-reduced form (NADH) under atmospheric pressure of H2 at room temperature in weakly basic water. In weakly acidic water, the complex [Ir–OH2]+ also catalyses the reverse reaction, i.e., hydrogen evolution from NADH to produce NAD+ at room temperature. Thus, interconversion between NADH (and H+) and NAD+ (and H2) has also been achieved by using [Ir–OH2]+ as an efficient catalyst and by changing pH. The iridium hydride complex formed by the reduction of [Ir–OH2]+ by H2 and NADH is responsible for the hydrogen evolution. Photoirradiation (λ > 330 nm) of an aqueous solution of the Ir–hydride complex produced by the reduction of [Ir–OH2]+ with alcohols resulted in the quantitative conversion to a unique [C,C] cyclometalated Ir–hydride complex, which can catalyse hydrogen evolution from alcohols in a basic aqueous solution (pH 11.9). The catalytic mechanisms of the hydrogen storage and evolution are discussed by focusing on the reactivity of Ir–hydride complexes.Shunichi FukuzumiShunichi Fukuzumi earned a Ph.D. degree from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1978.

Introduction
It is highly required to replace fossil fuels by sustainable and renewable energy resources such as hydrogen (H2), because H2 is regarded as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels, generating no harmful products for living things when it is burned in contrast with NOx or SOx emitted during combustion of fossil fuels in an internal-combustion engine and a coal-fired power plant.1–10 In spite of the availability and usefulness of H2, storage and transportation of H2 are quite difficult, because H2 gas is explosive and its volumetric energy density is quite low. Extensive efforts have so far been devoted to store hydrogen on-site, e.g., the improvement of the safety of high-pressure tank-systems. In such systems, however, energy-consuming cryogenically-coolable equipment is required to store pressurised hydrogen in a liquid form.11–13 Other methods using metal hydrides (hydrogen storage alloy),14–16 carbon materials17–20 such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and metal–organic frameworks21–31 can store only low amounts of hydrogen under high pressure and liberate them at high temperature. Hence, low-cost, energy-efficient storage of hydrogen is definitely needed for stationary and portable applications in the hydrogen-delivery infrastructure. In this context, catalytic dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions of organic and inorganic molecules in a reversible way have recently attracted much attention from the viewpoint of a hydrogen donor as a hydrogen storage material, i.e., releasing hydrogen by dehydrogenation of a hydrogen donor and storing hydrogen by hydrogenation of the oxidised form of the hydrogen donor.32–42 With reversible interconversion between hydrogen and hydrogen donors under ambient conditions, hydrogen donors can be regarded as sustainable and renewable energy resources.
In particular, the utility of formic acid (HCOOH) as an organic hydrogen donor has merited significant attention,43–56 because HCOOH is liquid at room temperature with relatively high volumetric density (d = 1.22 g cm−3)57 and HCOOH can be formed by reduction of CO2 with H2 using various catalysts.58–77 From the viewpoint of safety and cost-cutting, its liquid form is suitable for transportation, handling and storage as compared to the gaseous form. In addition, HCOOH is widely utilised as a preservative and an antibacterial agent in livestock feed.78 Thus, the combination of H2 storage with the aid of CO2 as a carrier, i.e., hydrogenation of CO2 with H2 to produce HCOOH, and the reverse reaction, H2 evolution in the decomposition of HCOOH to produce CO2 as a sole by-product, is an ideal carbon-neutral process. The use of water as a solvent is preferred for the interconversion between H2 and HCOOH, because the standard free energy change is slightly negative (−4 kJ mol−1 at 298 K) in water under the conditions where all the reactants and the products are soluble in water, whereas the reaction between gaseous H2 and CO2 is accompanied by a change in free energy by +33 kJ mol−1 to yield liquid HCOOH.60,79
In the natural photosynthesis of plants, electrons and protons taken from water under irradiation of solar light are used to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate): NAD(P)+ with the aid of ferredoxin-NADP reductase, generating the 1,4-dihydro form, i.e., NAD(P)H, which is used to reductively fix CO2 as carbohydrates through the Calvin cycle.80,81 On the other hand, in hydrogenase-containing photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and green algae, electrons and protons taken from water using solar energy are used for the reduction of protons to hydrogen (H2) rather than the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H.82–85 Both the oxidation of H2 with NAD(P)+ and the reduction of protons with NAD(P)H are catalysed by hydrogenases.82–85 Thus, a functional mimic of hydrogenase, i.e., interconversion between H2 and NADH as an organic hydrogen donor, provides a sustainable biomimetic hydrogen storage system. Hydrogen evolution from 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: NADH in water has so far been made possible under photoirradiation of an appropriate sensitiser with the aid of metal nanoparticles at room temperature.86–90 On the other hand, regeneration of NAD(P)H from NAD(P)+ by the reduction with gaseous H2 has been made possible with Ru and Rh catalysts under relatively high pressure of hydrogen (4.8 atm).91
From the viewpoint of solar energy utilization, biofuels such as so-called bioethanol made from plants’ carbohydrate are ideal hydrogen resources, since they can easily be produced from biomass by fermentation.92–100 As biomass takes in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in photosynthesis for its growth, consumption of biomass-derived ethanol to produce carbon dioxide is regarded as a carbon neutral process and does not adversely affect the global warming. Bioethanol is usually produced in water with the aid of enzymes, thus, containing a certain amount of water at least 5 vol%.99,101 The mixture of water and ethanol is a well-known azeotrope and the use of the mixture as a biofuel to produce hydrogen is preferred as compared to that of pristine ethanol to avoid the costly isolation procedures. Dehydrogenation of bioethanol to produce hydrogen requires high temperatures (ca. 573 K) generating CO as a waste by-product, which is a poison for the catalyst.101–105 Thus, it is desired to produce hydrogen from bioethanol that contains water under ambient conditions without CO generation.
Given this state of development of hydrogen storage and evolution using organic hydrogen donors described above, we have recently focused on finding efficient homogeneous catalysts, which are capable of interconverting between organic hydrogen donors and hydrogen in an aqueous solution under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature. In this Perspective, we review the current status of hydrogen storage and evolution using various hydrogen donors (formic acid, NADH and alcohols), which are catalysed by metal hydride complexes, and discuss the catalytic mechanisms.
2. Interconversion between hydrogen and formic acid
In 2003, we found that a Ru–hydride complex [RuII(η6-C6Me6)(bpy)H]2(SO4) (where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), which was produced by the reduction of [RuII(η6-C6Me6)(bpy)(OH2)](SO4) (1) with NaBH4, reduces CO2 to HCOOH in water in a pH range of about 3–5 at ambient temperature.63,106 When [RuII(η6-C6Me6)(bpy)(OH2)](SO4) was replaced by [RuII(η6-C6Me6)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)](SO4) (2) (where 4,4′-MeO-bpy = 4,4′-dimethoxy-2,2′-bipyridine), the catalytic reduction of CO2 (2.5 MPa) with H2 (5.5 MPa) to HCOOH occurred under acidic conditions (pH 2.5–5.0).64 The use of an iridium complex was more effective in the catalytic reduction of CO2 with H2 under the same reaction conditions. The initial turnover frequency (TOF) for the catalytic reduction of CO2 with H2 to HCOOH using an Ir complex [IrIII(Cp*)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)]2+ (3) (where Cp* = η5-C5Me5, the X-ray crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1) was 27 h−1, which is more than 10 times faster than that using a ruthenium aqua complex [RuII(η6-C6Me6)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)]2+ (2).64 The catalytic cycle of the reduction of CO2 with H2 using [IrIII(Cp*)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)]2+ is shown in Scheme 1. The reaction of the Ir–OH2 (where Ir = IrIII(Cp*)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)) complex ([Ir–OH2]2+) with H2 affords the Ir–hydride complex ([Ir–H]+), which reacts with CO2 to give the formate complex ([Ir–O(CO)H]+).

 Scheme 1  Catalytic cycle of the reduction of CO2 with H2 using [IrIII(Cp*)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)](OTf)2 (3·(OTf)2). 
The catalytic efficiency for the reduction of CO2 with H2 to HCOOH is significantly improved by using a water-soluble [C,N] cyclometalated iridium aqua complex [IrIII(Cp*)(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κN2)benzoic acid-κC3)(OH2)]+ (4) as a catalyst, which enables the reaction under atmospheric pressure of CO2 and H2.107 The complex was obtained as a sulphate salt [4]2·SO4 that was synthesised by the reaction of a triaqua complex [IrIII(Cp*)(OH2)3]SO4 with 4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid in H2O under reflux conditions. The aqua complex 4 can release protons from the carboxyl group and the aqua ligand to form the corresponding benzoate complex 5 and hydroxo complex 6, respectively (Scheme 2).107 The pKa values of complexes 4 and 5 were determined from the spectral titration to be pKa1 = 4.0 and pKa2 = 9.5, respectively.107 These values are consistent with those for benzoic acid108 (pKa = 4.19) and [IrIII(Cp*)(4,4′-MeO-bpy)(OH2)](SO4)64 (pKa = 9.2). The benzoate complex 5 is less soluble in water because of its neutral charge. The structure of 5 was determined by X-ray single crystal structure analysis.107,109
 Scheme 2  Acid-base equilibria of iridium aqua complexes (4–6). 
A CO2-saturated K2CO3 (0.1 M) aqueous solution of complex 5 was bubbled with H2 and CO2 at a 1:1 volumetric ratio under atmospheric pressure resulting in catalytic formation of formate with high concentrations at pH 7.5 at 303 K (Scheme 3). The turnover number (TON) increases linearly with time to exceed over 100 which is significantly larger than the maximum TON for catalytic formation of formate with 2 (59) and 3 (64) under significantly acidic (pH 3.0) and high temperature (313 K) conditions by the reduction of pressurized CO2 (2.5 MPa) with pressurized H2 (5.5 MPa).64 Turnover frequency (TOF) was determined from the slope of the linear plot as 6.8 h−1 at 303 K and 22.1 h−1 at 333 K at pH 7.5.107 The TOF increased with increase in pH to afford the highest value (36 h−1) at pH 8.8 at 333 K (Fig. 2). A further increase in pH resulted in decrease in TOF to reach 0.0 at pH 10.4. On the other hand, under slightly acidic conditions, no formation of formate was confirmed at 333 K at pH 6.0. Judging from the similar pH dependence of TOF (black line in Fig. 2) to that of the amount ratios of 5 and HCO3− (red line and red dashed line in Fig. 2, respectively), hydrogenation of bicarbonate (HCO3−) rather than carbonate (CO32−) or CO2 is catalysed mainly by 5 rather than by 4 or 6 to produce formate at pH 8.8. Indeed, TOF linearly increased with concentrations of HCO3− and 5 at pH 8.8. These results indicate that both catalyst 5 and a bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) are involved in the rate-determining step of the catalytic hydrogenation reaction in Scheme 3. The TOF for hydrogenation of HCO3− at pH 8.8 increased with increasing temperature with the activation energy of 11.3 kcal mol−1, which is much smaller than that of the hydrogenation of CO2 without catalysts (79 kcal mol−1).109

Red and green solid lines show the amount ratios of complex 5 and complex 6, respectively, to the total amount of these complexes. Red and green dashed lines show the ratios of HCO3− and CO32−, respectively.107 
In slightly basic water, the reaction of 5 with H2 affords the corresponding hydride complex 7: [IrB–H]−, that was identified by the 1H NMR spectrum, UV-vis absorption spectra and the ESI mass spectrum.107 The reaction of the hydride complex 7 with HCO3− gives the corresponding formate complex, which is the rate-determining step.107 The formate complex is converted to regenerate the aqua complex 4 by releasing HCOO− in competition with the back reaction to form the hydride complex 7 and CO2.
In acidic water, the reverse reaction, i.e., the catalytic decomposition of HCOOH, occurs with 4 to produce H2 and CO2 in a 1:1 molar ratio, which was detected by GC.107 No CO was formed as a by-product during the reaction.107 The pH dependence of TOF is shown in Fig. 3 in which the maximum TOF value of 1880 h−1 is obtained at pH 2.8 at 298 K. The TOF value is more than four times larger than that (426 h−1) obtained at pH 3.8 at 298 K in the catalytic decomposition of HCOOH using a heterodinuclear iridium–ruthenium complex [IrIII(Cp*)(OH2)(bpm)RuII(bpy)2](SO4)2 {bpm = 2,2′-bipyrimidine, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine} under otherwise the same experimental conditions.110 The black line in Fig. 3, which represents an increase in TOF with a decrease in pH in the region between 2.8 and 9.0, overlaps well with the curve of the ratio of 4 to 5 (blue line in Fig. 3), indicating that the complex 4 rather than 5 acts as a catalyst for the selective decomposition of HCOOH to H2 and CO2.
 Fig. 3  pH dependence of the H2 evolution rate (TOF) in the catalytic hydrogen generation from formic acid and formate ([HCOOH] + [HCOOK] = 3.3 M) catalysed by 4 (0.20 mM) in deaerated H2O at 298 K (black line). Blue, red and green lines show the amount ratios of complex 4, complex 5 and complex 6, respectively, to the total amount of these complexes.107 
The TOF value for hydrogen evolution from HCOOH at pH 2.8 increases with increasing concentrations of [HCOOH] + [HCOOK] to approach a constant value (Fig. 4).107 This indicates that the cationic aqua complex 4 reacts with HCOO− to afford the corresponding formate complex, which is then converted to the corresponding hydride complex 8: [IrA–H]0via β-hydrogen elimination. The hydride complex reacts with H3O+ to produce H2, accompanied by regeneration of 4 (Scheme 4).107 Thus, the direction of the reaction under slightly basic conditions in Scheme 3 is reversed under acidic conditions in Scheme 4.107 Formation of the hydride complex was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum independently obtained in DMSO-d6.107 At lower pH, formation of a hydride complex 8via β-hydrogen elimination from the formate complex is the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle in Scheme 4 because of relatively high concentration of proton which may accelerate the subsequent hydrogen-evolution step. This was confirmed by observing the kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KIE = 4.0) for the catalytic hydrogen evolution from formic acid-d (DCOOH).107 When a [C,N] cyclometalated ligand in 4 is replaced by a bpy ligand, [IrIII(Cp*)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ reacts at elevated temperatures with formic acid under neutral to slightly basic conditions to form a corresponding hydride [IrIII(Cp*)(bpy)(H)]+ which is stable enough not to evolve H2 in the reaction with proton in the wide range of pH.111 Alternatively, the corresponding Rh complex [RhIII(Cp*)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ catalyses the decomposition of formic acid at room temperature due to higher reactivity of the corresponding hydride complex [RhIII(Cp*)(bpy)(H)]+ as compared with [IrIII(Cp*)(bpy)(H)]+.51

 Scheme 4  Catalytic cycle of the decomposition of HCOOH using [IrIII(Cp*)(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κN2)benzoic acid-κC3)(OH2)]2SO4 (42·SO4). 
Thus, interconversion between H2 and HCOOH in water has been made possible using the Ir complexes 4 and 5 at ambient temperature and pressure by changing the pH: the Ir benzoate complex 5 catalyses hydrogenation of bicarbonate in slightly basic water (Scheme 3), whereas the reverse reaction, that is, the decomposition of formic acid to H2 and CO2, was also catalysed by 4 in acidic water (Scheme 4). In the same manner, a dinuclear Ir(Cp*) complex with 4,4′,6,6′-tetrahydroxy-2,2′-bipyrimidine (thbpym) as a bridging ligand, [{Ir(Cp*)(Cl)}2(thbpym)]2+, acts as a pH-modulated catalyst for interconversion between H2 and HCOOH by the deprotonation equilibrium of the phenolic ligand in Scheme 5.112 The X-ray crystal structure of [{Ir(Cp*)(Cl)}2(thbpym)]2+ is shown in Fig. 5.112 At pH 8.4, the deprotonated form of [{Ir(Cp*)(Cl)}2(thbpym)]2+ acts as an efficient catalyst for hydrogenation of bicarbonate at 0.1 MPa at 298 K to produce formate with a TOF value of 64 h−1.112 At pH 3.5, the reverse reaction, i.e., the decomposition of HCOOH to H2 and CO2, is efficiently catalysed by [{Ir(Cp*)(Cl)}2(thbpym)]2+, which is partially deprotonated, with a TOF value of 228000 h−1 at 388 K. This is the highest TOF value ever reported for the production of H2 from HCOOH. The mechanism of the pH dependent catalytic interconversion between HCOOH and H2 with [{Ir(Cp*)(Cl)}2(thbpym)]2+ may be similar to the case of the Ir complexes 5 and 4 in Schemes 3 and 4, respectively. However, the Ir–hydride and formate complexes have yet to be detected.112

3. Interconversion between hydrogen and NADH
When HCOOH in Scheme 4 was replaced by 1,4-dihydro-β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), H2 was evolved from NADH in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4 in an acidic aqueous solution.113 The oxidised product of NADH was confirmed to be an oxidised form of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) by 1H NMR.113 The yield and turnover number (TON) reached up to 96% and 6.9, respectively, both of which were determined by integrating the characteristic 1H NMR signals of NAD+ and NADH.113 The reaction of 4 and the deprotonated complex 5 with NADH afforded the corresponding anionic Ir–hydride complex 7 as indicated by the negative-ion ESI mass spectrum (m/z = 515.2).113 The reaction of the hydride complex 7 with proton in water yields H2, which is the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle in Scheme 6 (top left-hand side) as indicated by the saturation behaviour of TOF with increasing concentration of NADH (Fig. 6).

 Fig. 6  Plot of TOF for catalytic hydrogen evolution versus the concentration of NADH in the reaction of NADH with proton in the presence of 4 and 5 ([4] + [5] = 65 μM) in deaerated phthalic buffer (2.0 ml) at 298 K at pH 4.1.113 
At pH 8, the reverse reaction of H2 production from NADH, i.e., hydrogenation of NAD+ by H2 with the Ir complex 5, occurs to produce NADH.113 Only the 1,4-isomer of NADH was selectively produced by the reaction of NAD+ with H2 in the presence of the catalytic amount of 5.113 The yield based on the amount of NAD+ and the turnover number (TON) reached up to 97% and 9.3, respectively.113
The pH dependence of TOF for both H2 evolution from NADH and formation of NADH from NAD+ with 4 and 5 is shown in Fig. 7.113 An increase in TOF of H2 evolution from NADH with a decrease in pH in the region between 4.1 and 7.0 (black line in Fig. 7) overlaps well with the curve of the ratio of 4 (blue line in Fig. 7), whereas the pH dependence of TOF for hydrogenation of NAD+ (dashed line in Fig. 7) overlaps well with the curve of the ratio of 5 (red line in Fig. 7). This indicates that the complex 4 reacts with NADH to produce H2 and the complex 5 reacts with H2 to reduce NAD+ to NADH as is the case of interconversion between HCOOH and H2 (Fig. 3 and 4). At pH 6.5, the TOF for the formation of NADH is maximised (36 h−1), whereas the TOF for the hydrogen evolution reaches 44 h−1 at pH 4.1. A further decrease in pH resulted in decomposition of NADH due to acid-catalysed hydration.114
 Fig. 7  pH dependence of the rate (TOF) of H2 evolution in the oxidation of NADH (3.3 mM) catalysed by 4 and 5 ([4] + [5] = 0.18 mM) in deaerated H2O at 298 K (●) and pH dependence of the rate (TOF) of formation of NADH in the reduction of NAD+ (0.78 mM) by H2 catalysed by 4 and 5 ([4] + [5] = 15 μM) in deaerated H2O at 298 K (■). Blue, red and green solid lines correspond to the amount ratios of complex 4, complex 5 and complex 6, respectively, to the total amount of these complexes.113 
The rate-determining step in the catalytic hydrogenation of NAD+ with H2 is the formation of the Ir–H complex, which reacts with NAD+ rapidly to produce NADH (the right-hand catalytic cycle in Scheme 6). Formation of the Ir–H complex under an atmospheric pressure of H2 was confirmed by the ESI mass spectrum, 1H NMR and UV-vis absorption spectra.113 The TOF value of the catalytic hydrogenation of NAD+ decreased with increasing concentrations of NAD+ (Fig. 8) due to the coordination of NAD+ to 5, which prohibits formation of the hydride complex via H2 coordination. The binding constant of NAD+ with 5 was determined to be 1.1 × 104 M−1 from the absorption change due to the binding of NAD+ with 5.113 This is the first example of a hydrogenase functional mimic using a water-soluble iridium aqua complex which can catalyse the oxidation of H2 with NAD+ to produce protons and NADH and also the reduction of protons with NADH to produce H2 and NAD+ in water under atmospheric pressure at room temperature. The change of the direction of the reaction in interconversion between NAD+ and NADH depending on pH is largely consistent with the result of the thermodynamic analysis of the driving force (ΔG) of the reaction.113,115

4. Hydrogen evolution from alcohols
Alcohols can also be used as hydrogen donors for the catalytic hydrogen evolution with the Ir complex 4.116 At pH 13.6, the aqua ligand of the Ir complex 4 is deprotonated to produce [IrB–OH]− complex 6 (Scheme 2). When ethanol was added to a heavy water solution of 6-d, i.e., [IrB–OD]− at pD 13.6 in D2O, 6-d was reduced to produce the corresponding Ir–hydride complex 7 as confirmed by the 1H NMR spectral changes at high yields (98%).116 The second-order rate constants (k) of formation of the hydride complex were determined in the reaction of 6 with various aliphatic alcohols in an aqueous solution (pH 13.7) at 298 K.116 When CH3OH and C2H5OH were replaced by CD3OH and CD3CD2OH, respectively, in the reaction of 6 at pH 13.7, kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KIE's) were observed to be 3.2 and 2.1, respectively.116 Thus, the β-hydrogen elimination of alkoxy complexes, which are produced by the replacement of a hydroxy (OH) ligand of 6 by an alkoxy ligand, is the rate-determining step for formation of 7: [IrB–H]− (Scheme 7). The k value increases in accordance with the electron donating ability of the alkyl groups bonded to the carbon at the β-position of aliphatic alcohols, CH3(CH2)2 > two CH3's > CH3CH2 > CH3 > no substituent alkyl group. An alcohol having no β-hydrogen (t-butyl alcohol) shows no hydride donating ability to 6.
 Scheme 7  Formation of a hydride complex 7 in the hydrogenation of 6 with aliphatic alcohols. 
The hydride complex 7 formed in the reaction of 6 with ethanol in water is stable at pH 14, however, when pH was decreased to 0.8 by adding H2SO4, 7 was immediately converted to an aqua complex 4 accompanied by evolution of hydrogen (H2).116 The yield of H2 was determined by GC to be 82%.116 The conversion between the hydride complex and the aqua complex 4 accompanied by H2 evolution was repeated by alternate change in pH between ca. 12 and ca. 2 in the presence of an excess amount of ethanol as shown in Fig. 9.116 The conversion from 4 to 7 in the reaction of ethanol with 6 and that from 7 to 4 accompanied by H2 evolution by changing pH is shown in Scheme 8. Thus, hydrogen derived from aliphatic alcohols can be stored in the form of an Ir–hydride complex at higher pH and can be provided whenever it is needed at lower pH simply by changing the pH.

When an aqueous solution of the Ir–hydride complex 7 produced by the reaction of 6 with ethanol in D2O at pD 13.6 was photoirradiated for 7 h with a Xe lamp through a coloured glass filter transmitting λ > 340 nm, the signal of a proton at δ = 8.25 ppm disappeared completely and the signal of a hydride proton exhibited the upfield shift from δ = −14.34 to δ = −17.48.116 The ESI mass spectrum of the CO bubbled aqueous solution of the photoproduct agrees with the calculated isotopic distribution of the corresponding CO complex, i.e., [Ir(Cp*)(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κC5)benzoate-κC3)(CO)]−.116 This indicates that the mass number of the photoproduct remained the same as 7 and the [C,N] cyclometalated Ir–hydride complex 7: [IrB–H]−, was converted to the corresponding [C,C] cyclometalated complex 9: [IrC–H]2− (Scheme 9). The quantum yield of this photoreaction was determined to be 1.7%.116 The intersystem crossing of the photoexcited 7 and the subsequent formation of 9 were monitored by femtosecond and nanosecond laser flash photolysis, respectively.116

In contrast to the [C,N] cyclometalated Ir–hydride complex (7), the [C,C] cyclometalated Ir–hydride complex (9) can react with proton in water to produce H2 even under basic conditions as shown in Fig. 10. The turnover number (TON) of H2 evolution with 9 increases linearly with time to reach 3.3 (2.5 h), whereas 7 has no catalytic reactivity even at an elevated temperature of 323 K (Fig. 10).116 The TON for hydrogen evolution with 9 increases with increasing temperature to be 26 (1.0 h) at 353 K.116 This catalytic reactivity of 9 may be attributed to the electron-donating effect of the phenylpyrazole ligand on the metal centre in 9 with the [C,C] cyclometalated iridium as indicated by the upfield shift of the 1H-NMR signal of a hydride ligand bonded to the IrIII centre. The largely negative standard Gibbs energy change (ΔG°) for hydrogen evolution from alcohols can be evaluated based on the reported equilibrium constant.117

The complex 9 was formed from 7: [IrB–H]−, under photoirradiation (λ > 340 nm) for 30 min. Time course of hydrogen evolution from 2-propanol (4.3 M) catalysed by 7 (55 μM) in water (pH 11.9) at 323 K is shown by the red line.116 
5. Conclusions
As described above, the mononuclear [C,N] cyclometalated half-sandwich iridium complex, [IrIII(Cp*)(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κN2)benzoic acid-κC3)(OH2)]2SO4 [4]2·SO4, acts as an efficient catalyst for both storage and evolution of hydrogen in various redox reaction systems in water at ambient temperature. The Ir complex 4 shows high catalytic reactivity for hydrogenation of bicarbonate and NAD+ with H2 in slightly basic water at ambient temperature and pressure, whereas the reverse reactions, i.e., dehydrogenation of formic acid and NADH to evolve H2, were also catalysed by 4 in acidic water. The catalytic interconversion between H2 and hydride donors, i.e., HCOOH and NADH, in this study provides a convenient hydrogen-on-demand system in which H2 (gas) can be stored as naturally abundant hydrogen resources, formic acid and NADH (liquid and solid) and, whenever needed, H2 is produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid and NADH with 4 as a catalyst. The Ir complex 4 also reacts with aliphatic alcohols to afford the Ir–hydride complex 7, from which H2 is produced by lowering the pH at room temperature. In this context, the storage and evolution of H2 from so-called bioethanol could be conducted simply by the repeated change in pH. Photoirradiation of an aqueous solution of the corresponding Ir–hydride complex 7 resulted in formation of a unique [C,C] cyclometalated Ir–hydride complex 9. While 7 requires acidic conditions to produce H2, 9 acts as a catalyst for H2 evolution from 2-propanol and ethanol under basic conditions at ambient temperature. The catalysts 4 and 9 take advantage of the robustness in water, which enables the detection and characterization of the reactive intermediates by various spectroscopic methods as well as the stability in the wide range of pH in comparison with the other homogeneous catalysts reported so far.58–77,91,118,119 The catalytic systems reported in this Perspective for H2-storage and evolution are expected to supply pristine H2 free from by-product CO, which is a poison for the electrode catalyst of fuel cells. The work accomplished to date, as summarised herein, could thus set the stage for future advances.
