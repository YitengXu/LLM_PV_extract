    , Accepted 24th April 2018First published on 25th April 2018AbstractAerobic photosynthesis in green plants, cyanobacteria, and micro-algae has two important sites in the integral-membrane photoactive complexes, photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). These systems are assembled into thylakoid membranes. Thylakoid membranes with oxygen-evolution activity owing to PSII can be used in visible-light driven water photolytic materials. In this work, a new visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel-based cell consisting of the thylakoid membrane of microalgae Spirulina platensis immobilized on a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer electrode as a photoanode, a formate dehydrogenase (FDH)/viologen co-immobilized electrode as a cathode, and a CO2-saturated buffer solution as the redox electrolyte, was developed. The actual short-circuit photocurrent of this cell was estimated to be ca. 50 μA cm−2. Formic acid and oxygen were produced in this biofuel cell, while generating electricity from irradiated visible light. The ratio of formic acid to oxygen produced in the biofuel cell after continuous irradiation was estimated to be ∼2. Thus, formic acid and oxygen were produced stoichiometrically in this visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. Thus, a new biofuel cell system with the functions of a solar cell and the ability of CO2 conversion was developed.
Introduction
Green plants, cyanobacteria, and micro-algae use an aerobic photosynthesis system to convert solar light energy into chemical materials such as starch.1 An aerobic photosynthesis system uses a water molecule as an electron donor. In general, an aerobic photosynthesis system consists of two photosystem sites in the thylakoid membrane (TK) photoactive complexes: photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII).2–4 PSI facilitates the photoreduction of NADP+ to NADPH with the P700 reaction center complex. PSII serves as the reaction center with P680 for oxygen production due to water photo-oxidation, including an oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) protein. Thus, the thylakoid membrane is an attractive photocatalytic material for the visible-light driven oxygen and hydrogen production in the presence of a hydrogen producing catalyst such as hydrogenase. In particular, some studies on the visible-light driven hydrogen production with a combination of PSI and hydrogenase or platinum nanoparticles have been reported.5–7 Recently, many studies on biomimetic photovoltaic conversion systems using photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, its derivative, or artificial dyes in assembling electrodes have been reported.8–21 We developed a photovoltaic conversion system using a light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII) isolated from a green plant, spinach, immobilized onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode.22 As PSII is an attractive material for the visible-light driven photolysis of water into oxygen, some studies on the photovoltaic conversion system using purified-PSII assembled onto an electrode have been reported.23–31 Willner et al. reported integrated PSII-based photo-bioelectrical cells with a bilirubin oxidase (BOD) immobilized carbon nanotube electrode.26 PSII is also an attractive photocatalytic material for photoelectrochemical cells using semiconductor-based photocatalysts such as a TiO2 electrode. As PSII purified from Spinach or micro-algae is very unstable, however, stability against light irradiation for a long period and on the electrode is a serious problem for the utilization of photovoltaic conversion devices. Moreover, PSII alone will not work with TiO2 because the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.6 eV vs. NHE pH 7.0) is at a higher potential than those of P680*, the excited state of the reaction center P680 in PSII (−0.58 V vs. NHE pH 7.0), and the quinone derivative, the last mediator in the electron transfer chain in PSII (redox potential: −0.03 V vs. NHE pH 7.0), disabling the direct electron transfer from PSII to TiO2.30 On the other hand, the redox potential of P700*, the excited state of the reaction center P700 in PSI, is estimated to be −1.30 V (vs. NHE pH 7.0). Thus, direct electron transfer from PSI to TiO2 occurs.29 Therefore, we proposed to directly use chloroplasts or TK, assembled PSI and PSII, as an oxygen producing photocatalytic material to develop an electrode with the function of PSII. We also reported a photovoltaic conversion system based on the combination of oxygen production from water and chloroplasts from spinach on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film electrode by irradiation, and the electrochemical reduction of oxygen to water due to the catalytic activity of the platinum electrode.32,33 Thus, chloroplasts and TKs are attractive materials for assembling a photovoltaic conversion system using a water molecule as a redox electrolyte. In this system, PSII in the chloroplasts or TK acts as an oxygen producing catalyst under visible light irradiation.
CO2 conversion to organic molecules using visible light irradiation is a lucrative technology for assembling an artificial photosynthesis device. Some studies on the visible-light driven conversion of CO2 to organic molecules such as formic acid and methanol, using an enzyme and photo-redox system, have been reported.34–37 We previously reported visible-light driven enzymatic formic acid production from CO2 using formate dehydrogenase (FDH) via the reduction of methyl viologen (MV2+) by the photosensitization of water-soluble zinc porphyrin or chlorophyll-a.38–43 The visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell converting CO2 to formic acid consists of an FDH and viologen co-immobilized electrode, instead of a platinum electrode in the photovoltaic conversion system, combined with chloroplasts from Spinach immobilized on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film electrode and platinum electrode.
Since the TK of microalgae, which are active in water, is expected to be more stable in aqueous solution than that of green plants, such as Spinach, we focused on the TK from microalgae Spirulina platensis. Spirulina platensis thrives at a pH of around 8.5 and a temperature of around 30 °C. Spirulina grows efficiently in water, so it is easier to handle as a photosynthetic material than that of green plants, such as Spinach. As no chloroplasts are formed in Spirulina, Spirulina itself exhibits the function of a chloroplast. For the utilization of chloroplasts as a photoanode in a photovoltaic conversion system, in the future, chloroplasts must be purified from green plants using centrifugation, but Spirulina can be used directly as a photoanode material. Thus, we concentrated on the photosynthesis organ in Spirulina in the visible-light driven electrochemical conversion system.
In this work, a new visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell consisting of TK from Spirulina platensis immobilized on a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer electrode (TK/TiO2) as a photoanode, an FDH-viologen (1-carboxyundecanoyl-1′-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium bromide, iodide; CH3V(CH2)9COOH) co-immobilized electrode as a cathode, and a CO2-saturated buffer solution as the redox electrolyte was developed, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  A visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell consisting of TK from microalgae Spirulina platensis immobilized on a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer electrode (TK/TiO2) as a photoanode, the FDH-viologen co-immobilized electrode (FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH) as a cathode, and a CO2-saturated buffer solution as the redox electrolyte. 
The principle of the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell consisting of TK/TiO2, FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH and CO2-saturated buffer solution is as follows.
(1) Oxygen evolution with PSII in TK/TiO2 occurs under visible-light irradiation.
(2) The electron transfers from the TK to the conduction band of TiO2.
(3) The electron transfers from TK/TiO2 to the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode through an external circuit.
(4) Single-electron reduction of the viologen moiety of CH3V(CH2)9COOH on the electrode occurs.
(5) The reduction of CO2 to formic acid with the function of FDH catalytic activity and the single-electron reduced viologen moiety as a co-enzyme on the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode proceeds.
Results and discussion
Characterization of TK/TiO2
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of TK/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2 (solid line). As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption maxima are observed at 440, 490, 620 and 680 nm. Similarly, the absorption maxima of the TK dispersed in a solution are also observed at 440, 490, 620 and 680 nm as shown in Fig. 2 (dashed line).
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of TK/TiO2 (solid line) and the TK dispersed in a solution (dashed line). 
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of TK/TiO2 is similar to that of the TK dispersed in a solution. The absorption band at 680 nm is attributed to Mg chlorophyll-a (MgChl-a) (Q-band) along with its Soret band at 440 nm. The shoulder band at 490 nm is attributed to carotenoid (Car) absorption.44,45 The presence of a light harvesting site based on phycobilisomes (PBS) is observed from the absorption band at 620 nm. Thus, the TK is immobilized onto the TiO2 film electrode.
The photosynthetic dyes such as MgChl-a were fully desorbed by immersing the TK immobilized on the TiO2 film electrode in acetone. After immersing the electrode in acetone, the amount of MgChl-a was determined from the molar coefficient (ε663 = 8.13 × 104 M−1 cm−1) using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. From the result of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, the amount of adsorbed MgChl-a in the TK/TiO2 film electrode was estimated to be 14.8 nmol cm−2. The ratio of MgChl-a contained in PSI and PSII was reported to be 94.5 to 5.5, respectively.45 It has been reported that 920 molecules of MgChl-a are contained in one unit of PSII.44 Thus, the amount of PSII (0.86 nmol of MgChl-a cm−2) in the TK/TiO2 film electrode was estimated to be 2.9 × 1012 units cm−2 (ca. 5.0 × 10−12 mol cm−2). For a PSII/benzoquinone polymer-based photo-bioelectrical cell, the amount of PSII on the electrode was estimated to be 1.5 × 10−12 mol cm−2. In our system, as the TK was immobilized onto the electrode, the amount of PSII on the electrode was about 3.3 times compared with that of the PSII/benzoquinone polymer-based photo-bioelectrical cell system.
To confirm the successful fabrication of the TK/TiO2 electrode, the surface observation of the electrode was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 3 shows the photo image and the SEM image of the TK/TiO2 electrode and bare TiO2 electrode.
 Fig. 3  A photo image and the SEM images of the TK/TiO2 electrode and bare TiO2 electrode. 
From the result of the SEM observation, it is not clear that the TK immobilized on the TiO2 electrode is formed, but it is estimated from the SEM images of the bare TiO2 and TK/TiO2 that a large TK covers the electrode surface. Thus, it was suggested that the TK was immobilized on the TiO2 electrode.
To confirm the successful fabrication of the TK/TiO2 electrode, the photoelectrochemical properties of the TK/TiO2 electrode were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the dark and under visible-light irradiation.

Fig. 4 shows the representative CV in the dark and under visible-light irradiation of the TK/TiO2 electrode in an aqueous solution of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (vs. Ag/AgCl) (1 M KCl). The reversible redox curve is identifiable in all the CV curves at a central potential of around 0.35 V for thylakoid electrochemistry. From the CV curves in Fig. 4, the anodic current based on the water oxidation of the TK/TiO2 electrode was observed with light irradiation. Thus, the TK is immobilized onto the TiO2 electrode and TK/TiO2 exhibits a sufficient oxygen production activity.

The oxygen production activity of TK/TiO2 under visible-light irradiation
To confirm the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) activity of TK/TiO2 in a CO2-saturated buffer solution under visible-light irradiation, the oxygen production activity of TK/TiO2 under 100 mW cm−2 light irradiation in the presence of dichloroindophenol (DCPIP) as a sacrificial oxidant is studied in nitrogen-saturated (closed circle) or CO2-saturated (open square) 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as shown in Fig. 5. In all the experiments, to prevent the degradation of the TK and the direct excitation of TiO2 by near UV light, wavelengths of less than 390 nm were blocked using a cut-off filter (SCF-50S-39L Sigma Koki). In both cases, oxygen production was observed with irradiation time. This result indicates that CO2 has no effect on the oxygen production activity of TK/TiO2. In contrast, no oxygen production was observed in the absence of DCPIP (×) or dark conditions (open circle). Thus, oxygen was produced by the photocatalytic function of TK/TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. The oxygen production activity of TK/TiO2 was estimated to be 30 nmol cm−2 min−1. The turnover number of PSII in TK/TiO2 in the presence of DCPIP was estimated to be 1.5 × 104 min−1.

From these results, it was suggested that TK/TiO2 has sufficient oxygen production activity even in CO2-saturated buffer solution as an electrode. Furthermore, oxygen production from TK/TiO2 was observed even under visible-light while applying a bias equal to or lower than the oxidation potential of water. Thus, the successful fabrication of the TK/TiO2 electrode was confirmed from these experimental results.
Characterization of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode is shown in Fig. 6 (solid line). As shown in Fig. 6, the absorption maximum is observed at 270 nm. In contrast, the absorption maximum of CH3V(CH2)9COOH in a methanol solution is also observed at 265 nm as shown in Fig. 6 (dash line).
 Fig. 6  UV-vis absorption spectra of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode (solid line) and CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO in a methanol solution (dash line). 
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode is similar to that of CH3V(CH2)9COOH in a methanol solution. Thus, CH3V(CH2)9COOH is immobilized onto the ITO electrode.
The amount of CH3V(CH2)9COOH immobilized onto the ITO electrode was estimated to be 280 ± 10 nmol cm−2 using a spectrophotometer. The amount of FDH in FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was calculated using an enzyme activity assay and was estimated to be ca. 97.5 nmol cm−2.
To confirm the successful fabrication of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode, the surface observation of the electrode was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 7 shows the photo image and the SEM images of the bare ITO electrode, CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode.
 Fig. 7  A photo image and the SEM images of the bare ITO electrode, CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. 
From the result of the SEM observation, it is not clear that FDH immobilized on the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode is formed, but it is estimated from the SEM images of the bare ITO, CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO, and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes that a large amount of FDH covers the electrode surface.
To confirm the successful fabrication of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode, the electrochemical properties of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode were studied using CV. Fig. 8 shows the CV of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO (dotted line) and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH (solid line) electrodes in an aqueous solution of CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl)) as an example.
 Fig. 8  Representative CVs of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO (dotted) and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH (solid) electrodes. Buffer solution: CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl; Scan rate: 10 mV s−1. Inset: Colour changes of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode surfaces in aqueous solutions of a CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl under the application of −550 mV potential vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) for 2 h. 
In the case of both the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes, the shapes of the CVs are almost the same. The potential due to the single-electron reduced viologen moiety was estimated to be −550 ± 5 mV in the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes. This value is almost equal to that in the CH3V(CH2)9COOH solution. Fig. 8 also shows an image of the surface colour change of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes in aqueous solutions of a CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl under the application of −550 mV potential vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) for 2 h. The colour of the surface of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO or FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode changed to blue upon potential application, indicating the single-electron reduction of the viologen moiety on the electrode.
From the CV curves in Fig. 8, the cathodic current in the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode was observed to be increased compared with that of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode. Thus, the TK is immobilized on the TiO2 electrode and TK/TiO2 has sufficient oxygen production activity. These results indicate the catalytic current based on the reduction of CO2 to formic acid with FDH on the electrode. From the observation of the colour changes of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO or FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode surfaces, the viologen moiety of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode was more single-electron reduced compared with that of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. By immobilizing FDH on the electrode, it is shown that the single-electron reduced viologen moiety on the electrode acts as a co-enzyme for FDH and is used for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid.

Fig. 9 shows the time dependence of the absorption changes at 570 nm due to the single-electron reduced viologen moiety on the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO (closed circle) and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH (open circle) electrodes under the bias application of −550 mV potential vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl).

From the results of Fig. 9, the viologen moiety of the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode was found to be more single-electron reduced compared with that of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. As the single-electron reduction of the viologen moiety on the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode was accomplished, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid was attempted. Fig. 10 shows the time dependence of the production of formic acid using the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode in CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl under the application of −550 mV potential vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl).

By using the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode, the amount of formic acid was increased with increasing bias application time. On the other hand, no formic acid production was observed when the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode was used. Moreover, formic acid production was observed with the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode upon addition of FDH into a CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer under bias application. No formic acid production was also observed with only the FDH immobilized ITO electrode under bias application. From these results, both viologen as a co-enzyme and FDH as a catalyst are required for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid.
Voltage response of TK/TiO2 under visible-light irradiation

Fig. 11 shows the voltage response of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. In all the experiments, to prevent the degradation of the TK and the direct excitation of TiO2 by near UV light, wavelengths of less than 390 nm were blocked using a cut-off filter. The voltage increased upon irradiation and decreased under dark conditions. The light and dark voltages were estimated to be 570 and 0.1 mV, respectively. In TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, the electrolyte consists of only the CO2-saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl. The photovoltage was estimated to be 569 mV under irradiation.

Current response of TK/TiO2 under visible-light irradiation

Fig. 12 shows the current response of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The current increased upon irradiation and decreased under dark conditions. The light and dark currents were estimated to be 55 ± 10 and 5.0 ± 5 μA cm−2, respectively. In TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, the electrolyte consists of only the CO2-saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The photocurrent was estimated to be 50 ± 5 μA cm−2 under irradiation. For TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, the two electrodes were separated by a Nafion 115 membrane. The Nafion 115 membrane was treated with sulfuric acid so as to stably and efficiently exhibit H+ permeability in aqueous solution.
 Fig. 12  Current responses of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH in the dark and under irradiation cycles with 100 mW cm−2 light. 
The ohmic resistance of the Nafion 115 membrane was estimated to be 1.3 × 106 Ω cm−2 in this system using an electrochemical procedure. The ionic conductivity of the Nafion 115 membrane was estimated to be 1.5 × 10−2 Ω−1 cm−1. These results suggested that some impedance loss in this cell will occur. In the case of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH without a Nafion 115 membrane, however, the oxygen produced from TK/TiO2 acted as a scavenger for the reduced form of the viologen moiety in FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH. Thus, the cell performance drastically decreased and no formic acid production was observed under irradiation. As there was some impedance loss when the Nafion 115 membrane was used in the cell, to prevent oxygen transfer to the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH side, the Nafion 115 membrane was required for the cell.
Dark and light currents and potential curves of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH using linear polarization

Fig. 13 shows the dark and light currents and the potential (J–V) curves of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, respectively.
 Fig. 13  Dark and light currents and potential (J–V) curves of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under 100 mW cm−2 light irradiation. 
For TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, Voc and Jsc in a light current were estimated to be 600 mV and 54.5 μA cm−2, respectively. In a dark current, Voc and Jsc were estimated to be 598 mV and 10.0 μA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the actual Jsc in a photocurrent was estimated to be 44.5 μA cm−2.
The Voc and Jsc values in light and dark currents obtained by LP measurements were in good agreement with the result of current and voltage responses with cycles of dark/irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 light.

Fig. 14 shows the photocurrent density and photopower density as a function of the applied potential in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH. Here, the photocurrent was calculated by subtracting the dark current from the light current. The photopower density is calculated by P = J·V.

From these results, the maximum of the photopower of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was estimated to be 5.3 μW cm−2 (V = 286 mV). The data of the photocurrent, photovoltage and photopower obtained from the cycles of dark/irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 light and LP measurements are summarised in Table 1.

The photocurrent action spectrum of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH

Fig. 15 shows the photocurrent action spectrum of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH (circle), where the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is plotted as a function of wavelength. The maximum peaks of the UV-vis absorption spectrum of TK/TiO2 are at 440, 490, 620 and 680 nm as shown in Fig. 2 and 15. The maximum peaks of the photocurrent action spectrum of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH are also at 440, 490, 620 and 680 nm and the IPCE values at 440, 620 and 680 nm are estimated to be ca. 20, 14 and 19%, respectively. From the UV-vis absorption spectrum of TK/TiO2 and the photocurrent action spectrum of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, it can be observed that the shapes of both spectra are similar, as shown in Fig. 15. Thus, photon-to-current conversion proceeded based on the function of the TK on the TiO2 electrode.

Formic acid production in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under visible-light irradiation
Next, we focused on the production of formic acid from CO2 in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under irradiation with visible-light. Fig. 16 shows the time dependence of the photocurrent of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under continuous 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. In all the experiments, to prevent the degradation of the TK and the direct excitation of TiO2 by near UV light, wavelengths of less than 390 nm were blocked using a cut-off filter. The volumes of electrolyte and gaseous phase in the anode and cathode sides were 0.5 mL, respectively. The distance between the working and counter electrode was 0.5 cm.

The photocurrent generated during continuous irradiation was estimated to be 55 ± 10 μA cm−2. Fig. 17 shows the time dependence of formic acid and oxygen production in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH upon continuous visible-light irradiation. The amounts of formic acid and oxygen increased with increasing irradiation time. After 3 h irradiation, the amounts of formic acid and oxygen produced in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH were estimated to be 30.0 and 12.5 nmol, respectively.
 Fig. 17  Time dependence of formic acid and oxygen production in the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell consisting of the TK/TiO2 and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes under continuous irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 light. Inset: Time dependence of the amount of HCO3− in the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. 
In Fig. 17, the time dependence of the amount of hydrogen carbonate (HCO3−) is also indicated. Before irradiation, the concentration of HCO3− in a sample of CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer was estimated to be 7.0 mM (3.5 μmol) using an ion chromatography system. In solution, FDH catalyzes the reduction of HCO3− to formic acid rather than directly reducing CO2. Therefore, the decrease in HCO3− and the increase in formic acid are interlocked. From the results of Fig. 17, it can be observed that, as the amount of HCO3− decreases, the amount of formic acid produced increases with irradiation time.
In contrast, formic acid and oxygen were not produced under dark conditions. The mechanism of photocurrent generation and the production of formic acid and oxygen in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH under continuous irradiation are as follows. Initially, PSII in TK/TiO2 was excited by irradiation with visible light, thus producing oxygen. Then, an electron was transferred from the TK to the conduction band of TiO2, followed by transfer to the viologen moiety, and lastly to the FDH moiety in the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. Finally, CO2 in the electrolyte was reduced to formic acid by the catalytic activity of FDH on the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. The ratio of formic acid to oxygen production in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH upon continuous irradiation was estimated to be ∼2. Thus, formic acid and oxygen were produced stoichiometrically in this visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. The turnover number of PSII in TK/TiO2 in this visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell was estimated to be ca. 2777 h−1.
On the other hand, the amount of FDH in FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was calculated using an enzyme activity assay and was estimated to be ca. 97.5 nmol cm−2. The turnover number of FDH in FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was calculated to be ca. 0.3 h−1. In a CO2 saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer containing 0.1 mM KCl, FDH catalyzes the reduction of HCO3− to formic acid. Before irradiation, the concentration of HCO3− in a sample of CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer was estimated to be 3.5 μmol using an ion chromatography system. When the volume of the aqueous medium was 0.5 mL, the conversion yield of CO2 to formic acid in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was estimated to be ca. 0.85%.
When bare TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was used, no formic acid or oxygen production was observed under continuous 100 mW cm−2 irradiation using a cut-off filter (less than 390 nm). In contrast, formic acid production was observed when bare TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was used under UV-light irradiation (Xe-lamp). No formic acid production was observed in the absence of CO2, TK/TiO2|FDH (without CH3V(CH2)9COOH), or TK/TiO2|CH3V(CH2)9COOH (without FDH) under continuous 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. Thus, TK, TiO2, FDH and CH3V(CH2)9COOH are all required to develop the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell with the function of CO2 conversion to formic acid.
In addition, as a result of investigating the influence of the distance between the TK/TiO2 and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes to the cell performance, a photocurrent was observed, but the reduction efficiency of CO2 decreased below the distance of more than 1.5 cm between the TK/TiO2 and FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrodes.
Although high phoelectrochemical conversion efficiency was achieved using the purified-photosynthetic proteins such as the PSI and PSII immobilized electrode, stability against visible-light irradiation for a long period was hardly improved. As the membrane-bound proteins exert their function in the lipid bilayer membrane, in general, their stabilities decrease due to purification from the membrane. The activities of these membrane-bound proteins were reduced even in micelles formed with surfactants. In contrast, by using TK directly for the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell, the photosynthetic proteins, PSI and PSII work in almost the same environment as nature, thus, PSII was stably functionalized onto the TiO2 electrode. Thus, a new biofuel cell system with the functions of a solar cell and CO2 conversion was developed using TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH.
Mechanistic pathway for electron transfer in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH

Fig. 18 shows the mechanistic pathway for visible-light driven electron transfer in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH.
 Fig. 18  Energy diagram of the working mechanism and electron transfer pathway in the TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH cell. Data from ref. 51–55. 
In this figure, C.B and V.B represent the conduction and valance band of TiO2, P700 and P700* represent the lower and excited energy states of PSI respectively, P680 and P680* represent the lower and excited states of PSII, respectively and Q represents quinone. OEC represents the oxygen-evolved complex, and V represents the viologen moiety of FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH. The band position values are also mentioned in the figure. The process starts at PSII, where the reaction center chlorophyll molecules in P680 harvest visible-light energy for charge separation. An electron from P680, the lower energy state in PSII, is excited to the higher energy state, P680*. After subsequent transfer within PSII, the electron transfers to P700 in PSI, via intrinsic electron mediators such as quinones. A second electron excitation occurs at PSI and the electron moves to the excited state, P700*. After sequential electron transfer in PSI, the electron reaches the electron mediators such as ferredoxins in PSI, and then to the conduction band (C.B) of TiO2 at a lower redox potential. From TiO2, the electron transfers through the external circuit and reaches the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode, where it reduces the viologen moiety of CH3V(CH2)9COOH and then CO2 reduction to formic acid occurs with the catalytic activity of FDH. The electron in PSII is regenerated by the oxidation of water to oxygen with the OEC as the redox potential of water oxidation is higher than that of P680. Thus, the cycle completes, producing oxygen at the working electrode (TK/TiO2) and reducing CO2 at the counter electrode (FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH). In this scheme, PSI alone cannot complete the cycle of electron transfer because of the absence of a sacrificial electron donor in the system. PSI cannot accept electrons from water attributed to the unfavorable energy level alignment, as the water oxidation potential is lower than that of P700, the lower energy state of PSI, as explained in Fig. 18. The electron at PSI has to move from PSII. Simultaneously, PSII alone will also not work with TiO2 because the conduction band of TiO2 has a higher potential than that of quinones in the electron transfer chain in PSII, disabling the direct electron transfer from PSII to TiO2. As can be seen from Fig. 18, the photovoltaic system using the combination of the Thylakoid membrane including PSI and PSII, and FDH-based electrodes would be operated without any bias voltage.
As mentioned above, TK, TiO2, FDH and CH3V(CH2)9COOH are all needed to develop the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell with the function of CO2 reduction to formic acid. In particular, PSII in the TK with the function of the photolysis of water into oxygen, acquires electrons and protons under visible-light irradiation, and is the most important photoanode material. As PSII purified from the micro-algae is very unstable, however, stability against light irradiation for a long period and on the electrode is a serious problem for the utilization of a visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. Therefore, direct utilization of the TK-assembled photosynthetic proteins represents an important approach for device application of visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cells.

Isolation of the TK from Spirulina platensis

Spirulina platensis was incubated in SOT culture medium etc., and TK was isolated using a previously described procedure.49
Preparation of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film electrode
The nanocrystalline TiO2 film on the ITO substrate was prepared using a procedure described previously.50 TiO2 powder was dispersed in concentrated nitric acid aqueous solution (pH = 1.0). The viscous suspension was spread onto ITO (1 cm × 3 cm) at room temperature using scotch tape as a spacer. A thin film was obtained by raking off the excess suspension with a glass rod. After removing the tape, the plate was dried using a hot plate at 80 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions to form a nanocrystalline TiO2 film onto the ITO substrate. The thickness of the film, determined using a micron-sensitive caliper, was approximately 10 μm. The active area of the electrode was 1.0 cm2.
Preparation of the TK-immobilized TiO2 film electrode (TK/TiO2)
The TK-immobilized nanocrystalline TiO2 layer on the ITO glass substrate was prepared as follows: a nanocrystalline TiO2 film on an ITO glass substrate was dipped into a TK suspension at 4 °C for 24 h. To prevent the TK on the electrode from eluting into the solution, the electrode surface was covered with a polyion complex film consisting of a poly-L-lysine and poly-L-TK-immobilized nanocrystalline TiO2 film on an ITO glass substrate, which is defined as the TK/TiO2 electrode. The surface structure of the TK/TiO2 electrode was observed using scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6500F FE-SEM JEOL). The CV curves in the dark and under visible-light irradiation of the TK/TiO2 electrode in an aqueous solution of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (vs. Ag/AgCl) (1 M KCl) were measured using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HZ-3000). A solar simulator also was used as a light source (A.M. 1.5 100 mW cm−2) with a cut-off filter (SCF-50S-39L Sigma Koki: less than 390 nm).
Preparation of the FDH- and viologen-immobilized electrode (FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH)
The FDH- and viologen-immobilized electrode was prepared using a modification of a previously described procedure. A viscous suspension containing indium–tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol was spread to 1 cm2 onto an ITO glass substrate (1 × 5 cm) at room temperature. An ITO thin layer film was obtained by raking off the excess suspension with a glass rod. The substrate was dried using a hot plate at 80 °C for 30 min and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions to form an ITO thin layer film electrode. The active area of the electrode was 1.0 cm2. To immobilize 1-carboxyundecanoyl-1′-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium bromide, iodide (CH3V(CH2)9COOH) onto the ITO thin layer film electrode, the substrate was dipped into a methanol solution containing CH3V(CH2)9COOH (300 μM) for 68 h at 25 °C. The electrode was washed with methanol to remove physically adsorbed CH3V(CH2)9COOH. This electrode is defined as the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode. Finally, FDH was immobilized onto the CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrode. The electrode was dipped into a sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing FDH (0.75 μM) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing with a sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution (pH 7). To prevent CH3V(CH2)9COOH and FDH in the electrode from eluting into the solution, the electrode surface was covered with a polyion complex film consisting of poly-L-lysine and poly-L-glutamine. This electrode is defined as the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode. The surface structure of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The CV curves of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH and CH3V(CH2)9COOH/ITO electrodes in the aqueous solution of CO2 saturated sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (vs. Ag/AgCl) (1 M KCl) were measured using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HZ-3000). The concentration of formic acid produced in FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH upon continuous electrochemical bias application was measured using an ionic chromatograph system (Dionex IC2000). Other details of the FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode were reported previously.47,48
Oxygen production activity of TK/TiO2 in the presence of DCPIP under visible-light irradiation
The oxygen production activity of PSII in TK/TiO2 under continuous visible-light irradiation in the presence of the sacrificial reagent DCPIP was studied. Sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.3 mM of DCPIP was subjected to bubbling nitrogen or CO2 gas for 20 min. The TK/TiO2 in the sodium pyrophosphate buffer containing DCPIP was irradiated with visible-light. A solar simulator (YSS-40, Yamashita Denso) was used as a visible light source (A.M. 1.5 100 mW cm−2). To prevent the degradation of the TK and the direct excitation of TiO2 by near UV light, wavelengths of less than 390 nm were blocked using a cut-off filter. The amount of oxygen produced was measured using an optical oxygen monitor (FireStingO2, Pyroscience).
Photocurrent action spectra measurement
A 400 W xenon lamp with a monochromator was used as a light source for photocurrent action spectra measurements. The cell was operated in the short-circuit mode. The photocurrent action spectrum of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH was measured with a sandwich type cell. The working electrode with TK/TiO2 was gently squeezed together with FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH as a counter electrode using a spring and irradiated from the working electrode side. The sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl was subjected to bubbling CO2 gas for 20 min and then used as the electrolyte. The distance between the working and counter electrode was 0.5 cm. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were determined between 400 and 800 nm. The IPCE was then calculated according to the following equation:IPCE = 1240Jph (μA)/P (μW)λ (nm)where Jph and P are the photocurrent and the power of the incident radiation per unit area and λ is the wavelength of monochromatic light.
Characterization of the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell
The working electrode with the TK/TiO2 electrode was gently squeezed together with a FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH electrode as a counter electrode via the proton transparent membrane (PEM), Nafion® 115, using a spring and irradiated from the side of the working electrode. The sodium pyrophosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM KCl was subjected to bubbling CO2 gas for 20 min, and then used as the electrolyte. The volumes of electrolyte and gaseous phase in the anode and cathode sides were both 0.5 mL. This visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell was defined as TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH.
A solar simulator was used as a light source (A.M. 1.5 100 mW cm−2) with a cut-off filter (less than 390 nm). The cell was operated in the short-circuit mode. The voltage and current responses were measured using a digital multimeter (model 34401A, Agilent) under dark conditions and irradiation cycles. The actual photocurrent was calculated from the difference in the curves. The active electrode area was 1.0 cm2.
Linear polarization (LP) was used to obtain dark and light current–potential (J–V) curves for the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HZ-3000) at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1, and the photocurrent was calculated from the difference in the curves. In LP measurements, the potential between the anode and cathode was varied without a reference electrode, while the current was monitored, allowing for probing of the light and dark J–V characteristics of the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. A solar simulator was also used as a light source (A.M. 1.5 100 mW cm−2) with a cut-off filter (less than 390 nm) for LP measurements. The active electrode area was also 1.0 cm2 for LP measurements.
The concentrations of formic acid produced and HCO3− in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH during irradiation were measured using an ionic chromatograph system (Dionex IC2000). The amount of oxygen produced in the side of TK/TiO2 was measured using an optical oxygen monitor.
Conclusions
In this work, the development of a TK isolated from Spirulina platensis assembled onto a TiO2 film electrode, and its photon-to-current conversion function was studied. A visible-light driven electrochemical fuel cell, TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH, which converts CO2 to formic acid, was also developed. The photovoltage and photocurrent of TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH were responsive to visible-light on/off. The ratio of formic acid to oxygen production in TK/TiO2|FDH-CH3V(CH2)9COOH upon continuous irradiation was estimated to be ∼2. Thus, formic acid and oxygen were produced stoichiometrically in this visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. By using TK directly for the visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell, PSI and PSII work in almost the same environment as nature, thus, a stable electrochemical cell using photosynthetic organs was accomplished. A new biocatalyst-fuel cell system with the functions of a solar cell, reduction of CO2, and lower carbon fuel production was developed in this study.
