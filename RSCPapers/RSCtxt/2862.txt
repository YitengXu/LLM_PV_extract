    , Accepted 29th September 2011First published on 20th October 2011AbstractThe photocatalytic and plasmonic photothermal cancer cell-killing activity of the metallic Au-capped TiO2 (Au@TiO2) composite colloidal nanopellets has been investigated on HeLa cells under UV-visible (350–600 nm) light irradiation. The Au@TiO2 composite nanopellets with the uniform Au-capped TiO2 structure were successfully synthesized by simple reduction of HAuCl4 on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. The morphological structure and surface properties of Au@TiO2 were characterized by using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, TEM, SEM, XPS, EDX and XRD analyses. The formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) was confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The photocatalytic and photothermal cell-killing activity of the Au@TiO2 nanopellets was found to vary with the molar ratio of Au to TiO2. The direct involvement of the metal particles in mediating the electron transfer from the photoexcited TiO2 under the band gap excitation is considered to carry out the efficient photocatalytic reaction on the cells. The plasmonic absorption spectra of Au@TiO2 suspensions were also measured for the evaluation of photothermal cell killing. The charge separation, the interfacial charge-transfer and photothermal activity promoted the photocatalytic–photothermal cancer-cell killing more than TiO2 alone. The cytotoxic effect of Au@TiO2 nanopellets with low concentration of gold (TiO2:Au molar ratio > 1:1) was found to be 100%, whereas that of the commercial TiO2 (P25) was ca. 50%. The comparative study of the cell viability using Au alone and TiO2 alone revealed that the synergistic effect of photocatalytic hydroxyl radical formation and Au-plasmonic photothermal heat generation plays a vital role in the cancer cell killing. A plausible mechanism was also proposed for photocatalytic cancer cell killing based on the obtained results.
1. Introduction
The increased prevalence of cancer in the world demands an increase in efforts towards the development of novel and effective photocatalysts for killing cancer cells. A variety of nanocomposite semiconductor materials have been synthesized in recent years to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic processes. The functional properties of such materials can be greatly improved by capping semiconductors or metal nanoclusters with another layer of compatible materials.
When a semiconductor absorbs the photons with energy greater than its band gap, the photons excite electrons of a semiconductor catalyst, moving them from the valence band to the conduction band. Removal of an electron from the valence band creates a positively charged vacancy called a hole. These electrons and holes in single component semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit relatively poor photocatalytic efficiency (<5%) and the majority of the photogenerated charge carriers undergoes recombination.1,2 The conduction band electrons must be removed rapidly from TiO2 to prevent the recombination with the holes and allow the successful charge separation for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.
Heterogeneous photocatalysis based on TiO2 has been the focal point of numerous investigations in recent years because of the chemical stability of this material, its nontoxicity, and its potential utility for total destruction of organic compounds in polluted air and wastewater. The band gap (Eg) of TiO2 anatase is ∼3.2 eV, which corresponds to only a limited portion (3–4%) of the solar spectrum. This relatively large band gap has significantly limited more widespread applications, particularly to indoor situations.3,4 Various methods have been suggested to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic processes involving TiO2 under visible light irradiation, including doping, functionalization of the surface with metal particles, and reduction of particle size to the nanoscale. The deposition of a noble metal on semiconductor nanoparticles is an essential factor for maximizing the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. The noble metal (e.g. Pt), which acts as a sink for photoinduced charge carriers, promotes interfacial charge-transfer processes.1,5 The TiO2 lattice with metal ions introduces new energy levels in the band gap which can be tailored to extend the photoresponsiveness into the visible light region. Recently many studies have shown that metal or metal ion doped semiconductor composites exhibit a shift in the Fermi level to more negative potentials.6–9 Such a shift in the Fermi level improves the energetics of the composite system and enhances the efficiency of interfacial charge-transfer processes.
The photocatalytic reactions of Au@TiO2 have been studied as several phototechnologies, such as water-splitting reactions, microelectronics, photochemical solar cells, sensors and memory devices.10–14 Very few studies have been investigated on the application of Au@TiO2 to biology and medicine, such as an anticancer modality. In a preliminary communication we reported the cytotoxic ability of the Au@TiO2 nanopellets on cancer cells.15 We also reported that plasmonically photoexcited Au nanoparticles showed photothermal cytotoxicity.16 In this paper we report the effect of photocatalytic and plasmonic Au@TiO2 on cancer cells at several concentrations and molar ratios of TiO2 to gold nanoparticles. In our experiments using HeLa cells as a human cancer cell line, we observed a distinct cell killing in vitro with the combination of Au@TiO2 and UV-visible (350–600 nm) light irradiation. We also compare the cell killing effects of only TiO2 and gold capped TiO2. We observed that the Au@TiO2 needs only half of the irradiation time and more than 50% of the cells have been killed than those of bare TiO2 treatments. Moreover, the advantage of Au nanoparticles as the promoter for the TiO2 photocatalyst and their photothermal cytotoxicity are reported with a plausible mechanism.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 colloidal suspension
The photocatalyst TiO2 (Degussa, P25) was used mainly with an anatase structure (ca. 80%) in the shape of non-porous polyhedral particles of ca. 20 nm mean size with a surface area of 49.9 m2 g−1. The powder of TiO2 (20 mg) was mixed with concentrated hydrochloric acid (20 μL) with some water and rubbed very hastily. After thorough rubbing the paste was collected and 50 mL colloidal suspension was prepared with vigorous stirring. The 50 mL (5 mM (1 M = 1 mol dm−3)) solution was the mother solution to prepare the Au capped TiO2 in various ratios. Prior to the addition of the water suspension the pH value was adjusted to ca. 1.5 with 0.01 M hydrochloric acid under vigorous stirring.
2.2 Preparation and characterization of Au@TiO2 nanopellets
The gold-capped nanopellets were prepared by borohydrate reduction from hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) tetrahydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O) using the following method4 modified by us. Four different suspensions of Au@TiO2 nanopellets were prepared by keeping the gold concentration constant at 0.2 mM while varying the TiO2 concentration from 4 to 0.05 mM. These four Au@TiO2 suspensions contained [Au]:[TiO2] ratios of 1:20, 1:10, 1:1, and 1:0.25 respectively. All the concentrations are based on molar concentrations.
Au@TiO2 nanopellets were prepared by adding the HAuCl4 (Aldrich) solution to the colloidal TiO2 suspension in water while stirring vigorously. The negatively charged [AuCl4]− strongly adsorbs on the positively charged surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The solution was stirred for an additional 15 min to allow complete adsorption of [AuCl4]− ions onto the TiO2 surface. Reduction of the [AuCl4]− was achieved by the dropwise addition of sodium borohydride (8–10 mM) until a color change was observed. The reduced gold solutions made with TiO2:Au ratios of 20:1, 10:1, and 1:1 were wine red in color, while the solution with a TiO2:Au ratio of 0.25:1 solution was dark purple in color. All solutions used were freshly prepared and kept stirring in a closed flask until the next step.
After the solution was transferred into a conical flask with a rubber septum, it was irradiated with ultraviolet light (15 mW cm−2) for at least 5–10 min to reduce adsorption of any remaining Au+3/+2/+1 in the TiO2 surface to Au by TiO2 photocatalysis and also N2 purged the solution to remove dissolved oxygen at least for 30 min. Then the solution was centrifuged at 1600 × g for 10 min and washed several times repeatedly. After the supernatant was removed, the pellet was collected and sterilized by an autoclave. Next the pellet was dispersed in 10 ml MEM (Minimum Essential Medium) solution and stored at 4 °C.
Absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, MPS-2000, Kyoto, Japan) using a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The size and shape of the nanopellet are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using JEOL, JEM-3010 VII, TEM operating at 300 kV. The nanopellet surface characteristics were also analyzed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi, S-4100H), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Quantum-2000, Scanning ESCA-1000 microprobe with Magnesium α radiation, Shimadzu) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical). The quantitative chemical composition of the Au@TiO2 composite nanopellets surface was also measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Philips, XL 30CP) attached to the cold field SEM. The confirmation of oxidative cell killing by formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) on the surface of UV-visible illuminated Au@TiO2 was examined by a photoluminescence (PL) technique (Shimazu, RF-5300PC) with terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.
2.3 Cell culture and cellular incubation with colloidal nanopellets

2.3.1 Cell line and counting method. 
A typical cancer cell line, human cervix epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa), was used in this study. The cells were cultured in a minimum essential medium (MEM, Sigma) plus 10% new born calf serum (NBS, Invitrogen Corporation, Gibco) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a concentration of about 3 × 105 in a 60 mm Petri dish and were allowed to grow for 3 days. The old culture medium was replaced with nanopellet colloidal solution and recultured for 24 h in an incubator. The colloidal solution was removed and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Invitrogen Corporation, Gibco). After the cells were cleaved by trypsin–EDTA (Gibco), the cells were stained with trypan blue (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Then, the cells were counted under a 10× in-bright-field microscope by using a hemocytometer. The cell survival was determined as the percentage of the number of unstained (live) cells against the control dish cells.


2.3.2 Light irradiation of colloidal nanopellets on cells. 
For the light irradiation experiment, a continuous wavelength Xenon CX-04E lamp (Inotech, Japan) was used. The light wavelength was in the range of 350–600 nm (band pass filter V-B46, Asahi Techno glass) and passed through a heat cutoff filter. The light power was measured by using a spectroradiometer (model LS-100, EKO Instruments Co. Ltd., Japan). The maximum power of the light was 35 mW cm−2 and the irradiation time was 10 min for TiO2-treated dishes and 5 min for Au@TiO2-treated ones. The cells were cultured for 3 days and the medium was replaced with colloidal nanopellet solution, and then the cells were incubated for 24 hours. One dish only was photoirradiated without nanopellet solution (light control dish) and other dishes were photoirradiated with different quantities of colloidal nanopellet solution. Next the colloidal solution was removed, and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then stained with trypan blue to evaluate the cell viability. Dead cells accumulating the dye were stained with blue color while living cells have no color. The living cells were counted by using a hemocytometer and calculated as the percentage against the control dish cells.


2.3.3 Cells imaging method. 
The images were taken using an inverted Olympus CKX41 microscope with a numerical light field condenser, which delivers a very narrow beam of white light from a tungsten lamp (transmitted light of 6 V–30 W halogen illumination) on the top of the sample. A 40× objective was used to collect only the scattered light from the samples. The light field pictures were taken using an Olympus digital camera (model No. C-5060, wide zoom).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the Au capped TiO2 nanopellets
Au@TiO2 nanopellets have a visible absorption band at around 550 nm. The TiO2 lattice with metal/metal ions introduces new energy levels in the band gap. The band gap of TiO2 can be tailored to extend the photoresponsiveness into the visible light region. TiO2 is a quite stable photocatalyst, but since the band gap is large (Eg = 3.2 eV), it is only active in the ultraviolet region which is around 3% of the overall solar intensity. When the heterogeneous photocatalysts like TiO2 are capped by the noble metals like gold, they increase the active wavelength to the visible region.4,17

3.1.1 UV-visible absorption spectra. 
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the four different Au@TiO2 colloidal solutions were clearly characterized by the visible region peaks of Au@TiO2 nanopellets (Fig. 1). All the four solutions contained a constant amount of gold (0.2 mM), but different TiO2 core concentrations. These experimental conditions allowed us to achieve different gold distributions on the TiO2 core and compare the spectral properties. In the nanopellet solution with lower TiO2 molar ratios (i.e. when the ratio of TiO2:Au is maintained at ratios ≤ 1:1), sharp and prominent absorption bands (ca. 550 nm) corresponding to the surface plasmon band of gold are observed (Fig. 1c and d). Apparent absorption of Au@TiO2 particles in the visible region (Fig. 1c and d) should contain light scattering, because of the solution's higher gold molar concentration than TiO2. On the other hand, at higher TiO2 molar concentrations ((Fig. 1a and b), i.e. when the ratio of TiO2:Au is maintained at 20:1 and 10:1), we observed that the absorption band was broadened due to the light refraction of anatase TiO218 as well as Au@TiO2 nanopellets. A possible explanation may be due to the extra charged TiO2 surface at high TiO2 molar concentrations, which may oxidize the gold and allow weak interaction between the TiO2 core and the capping gold layer, thus inducing some aggregation (see TEM images in Fig. 2a and b).
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of various Au@TiO2 colloidal nanopellet suspensions in water. The gold concentration was fixed at 0.2 mM and the TiO2 concentration was varied. The Au:TiO2 molar ratios were maintained at (a) 1:20, (b) 1:10, (c) 1:1 and (d) 1:0.25. 
 Fig. 2  TEM images of Au@TiO2 nanopellets were recorded after 10 min UV light irradiation on the colloid. The Au:TiO2 molar ratios were maintained at (a) 1:20, (b) 1:10, (c) 1:1 and (d) 1:0.25. 


3.1.2 TEM analysis of nanopellets. 
The TEM images of the four different Au@TiO2 nanopellets are shown in Fig. 2. The nanopellets as deposited on the copper grid exhibit wide population in particle size, ranging from 10 to 40 nm. These composite nanopellets are mostly spherical in shape. As observed from the broadband absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1a and b, these particles maintain individual identity and also exhibit noticeable aggregation (Fig. 2a and b) as well as background scattering. The TEM images in Fig. 2c and d clearly show a lot of dotted Au nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface.


3.1.3 SEM and XPS analyses of nanopellets. 
From the FE-SEM micrograph measurements it was found that the gold metal nanoparticles form a cluster on the TiO2 surface. At the TiO2:Au molar ratio of 20:1, only about 5% of the TiO2 surface area was covered. A large surface area of TiO2 is still exposed (Fig. 3a). The properties of electron captures at the Schottky barrier of the metal depend on the contact with the small area of the TiO2 surface. The FE-SEM image shows the small area of the TiO2 surface that is actually covered. We can see that the capped gold is metallic by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3b), because the peaks observed at 83.8 and 87.45 eV are ascribed to the metallic gold. As shown in Fig. 3c, the peak located at 464.2 eV corresponds to Ti 2p1/2 and another one located at 458.5 eV is assigned to Ti 2p3/2. The splitting width between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 is 5.7 eV, indicating a normal state of Ti4+ in the as-prepared mesoporous TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3c.
 Fig. 3  (a) FE-SEM image of Au@TiO2 nanopellets. The XPS scan survey in the region of (b) Au 4f and (c) Ti 2p of the as-prepared Au@TiO2 nanopellets. The Au:TiO2 ratio of these two images was maintained at 1:20. 
The full-range survey of XPS spectra of the naked TiO2 (P25) and Au@TiO2 is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The naked TiO2 (P25) and Au@TiO2 contain Ti, O, and C elements, with sharp photoelectron peaks appearing at binding energies of 458 (Ti 2p), 531 (O 1s) and 285 eV (C 1s), respectively. The carbon peak is attributed to the residual carbon tape from the sample and also to the adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. It is clear from the spectra shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) that the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks have relatively clear intense signals corresponding to peaks at 83.8 and 87.45 eV, respectively. In contrast, the Au@TiO2 sample contains not only Ti, O, and C, but also metallic Au elements consistent with that observed in TiO2-supported metal catalysts. Therefore it can be concluded that HAuCl4·4H2O with borohydrate reduction treatment did not change the oxidation state of Au nanoparticles.


3.1.4 EDX and XRD analyses of nanopellets. 
EDX was employed to obtain the quantitative information on the amount and the distribution of gold and TiO2 species in the sample (Au:TiO2 = 1:20). The EDX analyses show the presence of gold, titanium and oxygen as part of the composition of the material (Fig. 4a). We performed the EDX analyses on various regions with a typical scan spot area (ca. 3.0 μm2) using different areas and consistently obtained an atomic ratio of Ti18Au9. This ratio also represented the average atomic ratio of Ti to Au in the Au@TiO2 nanopellet.
 Fig. 4  (a) EDX spectrum of Au@TiO2. The strong Au and Ti signals in the EDX spectrum indicate that Au is metallic and Ti consists of mixed oxides. (b) XRD patterns of Au@TiO2 and TiO2 (P25), indicating the formation of pure metallic gold. The molar ratio of Au:TiO2 was 1:20 in (a) and (b). 
The XRD patterns were recorded using an X'Pert PRO PANalytical diffractometer over the scanned angle from 10° to 100° at a scanning rate of 3° per minute. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Au@TiO2 and bare TiO2 (P25) nanoclusters are shown in Fig. 4b. Compared with the bare TiO2, Au@TiO2 exhibits new peaks emerging at 2θ = 38.185°, 44.393°, 64.578°, 77.549°, 81.724° and 98.137° which can be attributed to the diffraction peaks of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (400) planes of Au (JCPDS, PDF, File No. 00-004-0784), respectively, demonstrating the formation of metallic Au. The Au diffraction peaks are relatively narrow and low, suggesting that the Au nanoparticles are well crystalline and formed on the surface of TiO2.

3.2 Photocatalytic and photothermal cancer cell killing enhanced using Au@TiO2 nanopellets

In vitro experiments transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation showed that the TiO2 particles were adsorbed on the cell membrane and phagocytized into the cytoplasm during 24 h incubation with the cells as reported in the literature.19 There are many reports demonstrating that nanoscale sized particles smaller than 50 nm can easily enter most cells, while those smaller than 20 nm can move out of blood vessels as they circulate through the body. The size of the blood vessel endothelium wall pore of normal cells is ca. 10 nm while that of cancer cells is 10–100 nm. The anatomical difference of blood vessels and the size and properties of the nanoparticles are selective targets of nanosized devices for cancer cells. After passing the blood vessel endothelium, nanoparticles can enter the cell by a diffusion process and/or taken up into cancer cells via a phagocytosis process.16,20–23
The metal–semiconductor composite system was applied to the cancer cell as a photocatalyst. Single component semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit relatively poor photocatalytic efficiency (<5%) since the majority of the photogenerated charge carriers undergo recombination.1 It has been shown that the photocatalytic electron transfer processes at the semiconductor interface can be greatly enhanced by depositing a noble metal on the semiconductor particle.24–28 It is well known that TiO2 nanoparticles undergo charge separation under band gap (Eg) excitation (anatase, Eg = 3.2 eV). The UV light irradiation (<400 nm) is therefore capable of exciting TiO2 nanoparticles and initiating the redox reactions at the interface. The photocatalytic oxidation and reduction of semiconductor TiO2 are strongly enhanced by contact with noble metal gold nanoparticles under 5 min irradiation.
To compare the cell killing viability, the cell dishes were incubated with different amounts of colloidal nanopellet MEM solutions (0.2 ml, 0.5 ml, 1 ml, 2 ml and 3 ml) and a dish without nanopellet solution (controlled dish) was also incubated.
The cells were stained by a trypan blue indicator; the dead cells accumulate dyes resulting in blue color, whereas live cells have no color. The cell viability was determined as the percentage of the number of unstained cells against that of the control dish cells. All data are expressed as the mean of three time separate culture. The 100% mean the viability of the control dish cell in the absence of Au@TiO2. Fig. 5 shows the TiO2-concentration dependence of the viability of HeLa cells under the 24 h incubation condition. The cell viability under 10 min light irradiation without TiO2 (light control) was more or less 85–90%. When TiO2 was added, the HeLa cells were killed at much higher rate as shown in Fig. 5. When the concentration of TiO2 was 4 mM/10 mL MEM (Fig. 5a) in 3 ml treatment, a maximum of 50% of the cells were killed after 10 min irradiation, and also that when the concentration of TiO2 was 2 mM, 0.2 mM and 0.05 mM, 40%, 36% and 35% of the cells were maximally killed, respectively. The surviving fraction of HeLa cells depends on the amount of TiO2 and irradiation time. With about 50 μg ml−1 under 10 min UV light irradiation, most of the cells were killed as reported in the literature.29 But it was also reported that the depth of UV light penetration into the tissue is limited to a few fractions of a millimetre.30 The longer-time light irradiation gives pain and burn over the entire body.
 Fig. 5  Surviving fraction of HeLa cells incubated for 24 h in MEM solution containing different concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles: 4 mM, 2 mM, 0.2 mM and 0.05 mM. Light irradiation: 10 min. The 100% shows the control dish and the viability were calculated by the percentage of the number of live cells against the control dish cells. Bars represent the average region of 3 times measured data and the points represent the mean value from three measurements. Note the scale (40–100%) of the ordinate. 
For the Au@TiO2 nanopellets, the irradiation time is very short with low light power intensity. The Au@TiO2 nanopellets induced the cell death by the photochemical conversion, provided that heat is insufficient to damage the neighboring normal cells.

Fig. 6 shows the viability of HeLa cells treated by Au@TiO2 under the 24 h incubation condition. At 4 mM concentration (Fig. 6a) with 5 min light irradiation, 100% of the cells were killed in the presence of 3 mL Au@TiO2 nanopellets, whereas at the same concentration of TiO2 (Fig. 5a), only 50% of the cells were killed under 10 min irradiation. It can be concluded that the cell killing with Au@TiO2 was much enhanced by a factor of 2 and also the irradiation time needed was only 5 min. The cell killing effect of Au@TiO2 depends on the TiO2:Au ratio. When the TiO2:Au ratio is 20:1, 100% of the cells were killed under 5 min irradiation and also when the ratios of TiO2:Au were 10:1, 1:1 and 0.25:1, 68%, 37% and 35% of the cells were killed, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Surviving fraction of HeLa cells incubated in MEM medium containing Au@TiO2 nanopellets with different Au:TiO2 ratios of (4 mM) 1:20, (2 mM) 1:10, (0.2 mM) 1:1 and (0.05 mM) 1:0.25 after 5 min irradiation by a xenon lamp. The 100% shows the control dish and the viability were calculated by the number of live cell percentage against the control dish cell. Bars represent the average region of 3-times measured data and the points represent the mean value from three measurements. 

Fig. 7a and b show microscopic images of HeLa cells after 24 h incubation only in MEM medium containing control dish cells and after 5 min irradiation under the same conditions (light control dish). From these images it is seen that the cell morphological structure has almost not changed after 5 min irradiation. Fig. 7c shows the microscopic cell image of nanopellet-treated HeLa cells after 24 h incubation with 5 min light irradiation where some red spots and some aggregated particles are seen. It can be inferred from this image that the nanopellets are taken up or in contact with the cells, because these red spots are not observed when the nanopellets are not present in the medium (Fig. 7a and b). Thus, it is obvious that the nanopellets form aggregates in or on the cells. Fig. 7d shows that the HeLa cell (single cell) suffers severe injury under 5 min irradiation with Au@TiO2 nanopellets. The dim blue-red color (Fig. 7c and d) shown in the cell images inside and/or outside the cell surface is due to the cell death. After light irradiation the cells were stained with trypan blue. The blue color (data not shown) showed the cell death.
 Fig. 7  Microscopic images of HeLa cells after 24 h incubation. (a) Control dish cells, without nanopellets and light irradiation, (b) after 5 min light irradiation without nanopellets, (c) with Au@TiO2 nanopellets and 5 min light irradiation and (d) an injured single cell. Magnification: 200 for (a)–(c) and 400 for (d). 
The time threshold for cell death of the HeLa cells for the Au@TiO2 nanopellets is about half that needed for only TiO2 (Fig. 5 and 6). The dim blue-red color shown in the cell images outside the cell surface (Fig. 7c) is due to the cell killing by prolonged exposure of the cells to MEM solution. The blue-red spots (Fig. 7d) show that the Au@TiO2 nanopellets in the cytoplasm were gathered to form larger aggregates. Thus, it can be concluded that particles are taken up or in contact with the cells, because these blue-red spots are not observed when nanopellets are not present in the medium (Fig. 7a).
Obviously there is one question about the scavenger reactive oxygen species like ˙OH, H2O2, and O2˙− on HeLa cells. There are many reports on the scavenger experiments. The cell survival rate was increased, because in the presence of L-tryptophan ˙OH is quenched.29,31 In the presence of catalase, the cell survival rate was increased due to the catalase decomposition of the reactive H2O2via the following reaction 2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2.27 In the presence of superoxide dismutase also, the survival rate was increased due to the antioxidant action like superoxide conversion into the hydrogen peroxide which is then converted to water and oxygen in the presence of catalase.32

3.2.1 Cancer cell killing mechanism. 
It is well known that reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide are formed on photoexcited photocatalysts such as TiO2 nanopellets in water solution. The highly oxidizing hydroxyl and hydrogen peroxide species are expected to be cytotoxic to the cells.28,33(TiO2)Au + hν → (TiO2(e + h))Au(TiO2(e))Au + O2 → (TiO2)Au + O2˙−TiO2(h) + H2O → ˙OH + H+O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙2HO2˙ → O2 + H2O2H2O2 + O2˙− → ˙OH + OH− + O2
It was reported that a photogenerated hole will react with a water molecule to form ˙OH, H2O2 and O2˙− which are expected to be toxic to cells.32,34 The photo-induced electrons can move to the surface of gold nanoparticles and reduce the dissolved O2 easily and the photo-generated holes on the TiO2 surface can react with water to produce powerful oxidative radicals ˙OH and HO2˙. The reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Proposed mechanism for the interfacial charge separation of the Au@TiO2 nanopellet under the UV-visible (350–600 nm) light irradiation (left). Fermi level equilibration of the Au@TiO2 composite nanopellet through the redox reaction after light irradiation (right) (Ef* = apparent Fermi level). 
After the photoexcitation of metal–semiconductor nanocomposites, the electron migrates to the metal in which it becomes trapped and the electron–hole recombination is suppressed. The hole is then free to diffuse to the semiconductor surface where oxidation of organic species can occur.2 The metal has also an important influence on the photocatalytic properties of the semiconductor by changing the distribution of electrons. For example, the metal and the n-type semiconductor have different Fermi level positions. The metal has a higher work function than the semiconductor. When the two species come in contact, the Fermi levels of the metal and the semiconductor align, causing electrons to flow to the metal from the semiconductor. Furube et al. reported that upon the surface plasmon excitation of Au nanoparticles, electrons can be transferred into TiO2 depending on the TiO2 particle size; the larger TiO2 particles result in the slower back electron transfer to Au nanoparticles.35 Thus, the ease of O2 reduction on the TiO2 surface for Au@TiO2 with smaller loading amounts may contribute to increase in the photocatalytic activity.36 The decrease in electron density within the semiconductor leads to an increase in active holes, and thus the hydroxyl group. This in turn affects the photocatalytic process on the semiconductor surface.37,38 Dawson and Kamat showed that, in the absence of capping gold, TiO2 nanoparticles generated SCN2˙− radicals with a quantum yield (Φr) of 0.09.4 To vary the gold capping concentration, the Φr of SCN2˙− is also varied. At low concentrations of gold, they observed an increase in the efficiency of the oxidation process. For a [Au]:[TiO2] ratio of 0.17 they found more than 40% enhancement of the oxidation efficiency (Φr of SCN2˙− = 0.13).4 It can be concluded that the lower concentration of Au (metal) is one of the important factors in increasing the efficiency as well as the quantum yield efficiency of TiO2 in the Au@TiO2 photocatalytic system.


3.2.2 Photoluminescence detection of hydroxyl radicals for photocatalytic cancer cell killing. 
The formation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) on the surface of UV-visible light irradiated Au@TiO2 can be detected by photoluminescence (PL) techniques with terephthalic acid as a probe molecule. Terephthalic acid reacts with hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) to form a highly fluorescent product, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, during photoirradiation. The intensity of the PL peak of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid is in proportion to the amount of ˙OH radicals produced in water.39,40 This method relies on the PL signal (peak: 425 nm) due to the hydroxylation of terephthalic acid with ˙OH generated at the water/Au@TiO2 interface.
The PL spectral experimental procedures are given in the ESI.† The PL spectra were compared between TiO2 (P25) and Au@TiO2 (1:20 molar ratio) of the same concentration under the same UV-visible light irradiation like that in the cancer cell experiment. The PL emission spectra from terephthalic acid solution excited at 315 nm were measured every 10 min for TiO2 and 5 min for Au@TiO2 after excitation. Fig. 9 shows the changes of PL spectra from 5 × 10−4 M terephthalic acid solution including 2 × 10−3 M NaOH with irradiation time. As shown in Fig. 9, gradual increase in the fluorescence at about 425 nm was observed by the irradiation of UV-visible light in the TiO2 and Au@TiO2 colloidal solution. However, no PL increase was observed in the absence of UV-visible light or TiO2 or Au@TiO2. This indicates that the fluorescence is caused by chemical reactions of terephthalic acid with ˙OH formed on the TiO2 or Au@TiO2/water interface via photocatalytic reactions.39,40
 Fig. 9  Fluorescence spectral changes observed during irradiation of (a) TiO2 (P25) and (b) Au@TiO2 composite nanopellets. The optimal concentration of terephthalic acid (excitation at 315 nm) was about 5 × 10−4 M in NaOH (2 × 10−3 M) aqueous solution. Each fluorescence spectrum was recorded every 10 min for TiO2 and 5 min for Au@TiO2 under UV-visible (350–600 nm) irradiation. 
From the comparative study of the PL intensity of TiO2 and Au@TiO2 (Fig. 9) we can see that the fluorescence intensity of Au@TiO2 is much higher than that of only TiO2 under the same concentration and excitation. It can be concluded that the Au shell enhances the photocatalytic activity and the time needed for the same photocatalytic efficiency is about one third that for only TiO2. This result is also supported by the photocatalytic HeLa cell killing with Au@TiO2.


3.2.3 Synergistic effect of photocatalytic and plasmonic cancer cell killing. 
Under dark conditions without light illumination, the cell killing was not observed for every measurement using TiO2 or Au@TiO2 nanopellets. Illumination in the absence of TiO2 or Au@TiO2 nanopellets did not result in the cell killing of HeLa cells. Therefore, the presence of both UV-visible light irradiation and TiO2 or Au capped TiO2 nanopellets is crucial for the efficient cell killing. To examine the effect of Au alone or TiO2 alone on the cell killing activity of Au@TiO2 nanopellets, only Au or only TiO2 colloids were used on the cells under 5 min light irradiation. The cell viability using Au or TiO2 colloids revealed the synergistic effect of photocatalytic hydroxyl radical formation and Au-plasmonic photothermal heat generation, the latter of which is also known to result in the cell killing.16 The viability under 5 min light irradiation with 3 mL particles colloid solution/10 mL MEM containing only Au or only TiO2 colloids was ca. 55% and ca. 50%, respectively (Fig. 10b and c). To examine the effect of photothermal cell killing, cell killing viability was measured only in visible light (400–800 nm) or only in UV light (<400 nm) with Au@TiO2 (1:20) under 5 min irradiation. As shown in Fig. 10a and d, under only visible light irradiation and only UV light irradiation the cell killing viability was ca. 60% and ca. 45%, respectively. However, under 5 min light irradiation, almost 100% of the cells were killed in the presence of 3 mL Au@TiO2 (1:20) nanopellet colloid (Fig. 10e). The data led us to conclude that the synergistic effect based on the photocatalytic and plasmonic-photothermal16 cancer cell killing plays a vital role in our cancer therapy.
 Fig. 10  Surviving fractions of HeLa cells in the presence of Au@TiO2 nanopellets, (a) Au@TiO2 (400–800 nm), (b) only Au colloids (350–600 nm), (c) only TiO2 (P25) (350–600 nm) colloids, (d) Au@TiO2 (<400 nm) and (e) Au@TiO2 (350–600 nm wavelength) under 5 min irradiation. 100% of the cells were killed at a Au:TiO2 ratio of 1:20 in the presence of 3 mL Au@TiO2 colloid solution as shown in (e). 

4. Conclusions
The Au@TiO2 nanopellets were successfully prepared by a simple reduction method. The investigation of HeLa cell killing with four different suspensions of Au@TiO2 nanopellets showed that a [TiO2]:[Au] ratio of 20:1 was optimum for the cell killing. Lower concentration of TiO2 increased the Au concentration in solution and gave the plasmon absorption peak at ∼550 nm. The decreased TiO2 core concentration leads to the formation of larger sized particles with decreased stability of the sol. Higher concentration of TiO2 exhibited further absorption in the red and infrared regions. When the concentration of TiO2 was 4 mM/10 mL MEM, a maximum of 50% of the cells were killed after 10 min irradiation. At the same concentration of TiO2 with gold loading, 100% of the cells were killed rapidly after 5 min irradiation. With Au@TiO2, the cell killing activity was enhanced by a factor of 2 and the time threshold for killing of the HeLa cells is about half that needed for only TiO2. Gold-loading TiO2 greatly enhances the cancer cell killing activity than the only TiO2. Shorter irradiation time and lower light power intensity are very good for the body. The Au@TiO2 nanopellets induced the highly efficient cell death by the synergistic effect of photocatalytic ˙OH formation and Au-plasmonic photothermal heat generation.
