Structural and Raman scattering data confirm that CZTS is obtained rather than other possible material phases. The optical absorption spectra of nanocrystals with diameters less than 3 nm show a shift to higher energy due to quantum confinement.
To be sustainable, future electronic materials must deliver desirable optoelectronic properties while containing only abundant and benign elements. While silicon can satisfy these requirements, it has well known limitations that necessitate the use of other materials in several important applications. Unfortunately, many of these other materials, such as GaAs or CdTe, have rare and toxic elements. The field of sustainable electronics (or sustronics) aims to develop new electronic materials that avoid these problems.
One example is Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), which is emerging as a promising new sustainable semiconductor for solar cells. CZTS has a high absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1) and an electronic bandgap (∼1.5 eV)1 that is nearly ideal for photovoltaics. Indeed, thin-film Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells were recently demonstrated with an overall power conversion efficiency of 9.7%.2
To improve upon this result, one potential strategy would be to develop nanostructured CZTS. For example, semiconductor nanocrystals (or colloidal quantum dots)3 have been proposed as a general route to high-efficiency, low-cost photovoltaic devices.4,5 These materials are solution processible and, due to quantum confinement, exhibit optical properties that are tunable with nanocrystal size. In materials where the electronic levels can be changed through composition and quantum confinement, one can independently control both the effective band gap, and the location of the lowest unoccupied electronic level (e.g., electron affinity). Thus, multilayered devices containing films of quantum dots of different sizes could yield inexpensive multijunction solar cells.6 Further, quantum dots can potentially allow the Shockley-Queisser power-conversion limit for Si (31%) to be exceeded through multiple exciton generation7–9 or hot-electron extraction.10 However, the best quantum-dot solar cells to date11,12 have utilized lead chalcogenide nanocrystals that do not satisfy sustainability goals. CZTS nanocrystals could solve this problem while preserving the advantages of quantum dots.
Recently, several synthetic approaches to CZTS nanocrystals have been reported.13–16 However, two requirements for quantum-dot solar cells have yet to be demonstrated. First, no report has shown quantum confinement in CZTS nanocrystals, which is critical for exploiting the advantages discussed above in solar cells. Second, the syntheses to date have not provided a range of nanocrystal sizes, which is necessary for not only fundamental studies but also for multijunction photovoltaic architectures.
Herein we resolve these two issues by demonstrating a simple synthesis that provides CZTS nanocrystals with diameters ranging from 2 to 7 nm. This allows us to observe the effect of quantum confinement in the optical absorption spectra.
Our nanocrystals were synthesized from copper, zinc, and tin diethyl dithiocarbamate complexes. Because these molecules decompose thermally to produce their corresponding sulfides,17 CZTS nanocrystals can be obtained when stoichiometric mixtures of these three complexes are heated together. However, since their decomposition temperatures are 220 °C, 240 °C, and 175 °C, respectively, premature decomposition of one can result in unwanted phases such as SnS2 and Cu2S. To avoid this, we utilized the addition of oleylamine, which can lower the decomposition temperature of all three complexes to a narrow temperature range.18 The mechanism of oleylamine promoted thermal decomposition of metal alkyldithiocarbamate complexes was investigated by Jung et al. who hypothesized that oleylamine coordinates with the thiocarbonyl carbon of the dithiocarbamate ligand and accelerates decomposition.18 Thus, simultaneous decomposition of the copper, zinc, and tin dithiocarbamate complexes can be triggered by the sudden injection of oleylamine into a mixture of the three complexes. The amine is added when the mixture temperature is below that needed for the decomposition of the individual complexes, but above that needed for the decomposition of the complexes in the presence of the amine.
This approach leads to nucleation and subsequent growth of CZTS nanocrystals (see Supporting Information for details). The concentration of the nuclei available for growth is determined by the amount of oleylamine that is injected. By varying this amount and the growth temperature, we were able to tune the average diameter of the nanocrystals. Specifically, the final nanocrystal size decreased with an increase in added oleylamine and with a decrease in the growth temperature. The growth time of the nanocrystals did not influence their final size. Attenuated-total-reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra of the nanocrystals showed that the nanocrystals are capped both with oleylamine and oleic acid ligands (Fig. SI-1).

Fig. 1 shows high resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEM) of individual nanocrystals. By collecting statistics from many such images, we estimated the standard deviation in size for the 2, 2.5, 5 and 7 nm samples as ±12, 10, 23 and 20%, respectively. The nanocrystals become more polydisperse with increasing size. Ostwald ripening may be broadening the size distribution. In general, the HRTEM images also confirm that the quantum dots are crystalline and exhibit lattice spacings that are consistent with CZTS. Additional TEM images at lower resolutions can be found in the ESI (Fig. SI-2†).
 Fig. 1  
          HRTEM images of synthesized CZTS nanocrystals with diameters of: (a) 2 nm, (b) 2.5 nm, (c) 5 nm, and (d) 7 nm. The nanocrystals are single crystalline. All scale bars are 2 nm. 
To confirm that the nanocrystals are CZTS, we performed several additional characterization experiments. First, we used electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) to check the elemental composition of the samples. The results are shown in Table SI-1 in the ESI.† While all four elements are present, and the Zn:Cu and Sn:Cu atomic ratios are approximately 1:2 as expected, the samples are also slightly rich in sulfur. The S:Cu ratio increases with decreasing size, which suggests that the nanocrystal surfaces are sulfur rich.
Second, we completed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on our samples as a function of nanocrystal size, as shown in Fig. 2. The crystallite sizes extracted from the width of the (112) diffraction peak at 28.5° using the Debye-Scherrer equation range from 2 to 7 nm, in agreement with the HRTEM. The observed diffraction peaks also match those expected for CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575). The broad peak at ∼20° is due to oleylamine ligands19 and is present in all XRD data. This peak looks large compared to CZTS diffractions in the XRD of the smallest nanocrystals because the ligand volume fraction is comparable to the nanocrystal volume fraction.

However, one difficulty with ternary and quaternary nanocrystals is that XRD results alone often cannot confirm their exact structure. In particular, the diffraction pattern of CZTS is essentially indistinguishable from that of several related sulfides such as ZnS and Cu2SnS3.20,21 Therefore, we added a third set of characterization experiments, Raman scattering, which can provide a more definitive assignment of the structure.21Fig. 3 shows our Raman scattering data for four different nanocrystal sizes. Only a single Raman peak at 336 cm−1 is detected. The location of this peak matches that expected from bulk CZTS (338 cm−1).20,21 Raman peaks for Cu2S, ZnS, and SnS2 are expected at 472 cm−1, 351 cm−1, and 315 cm−1, respectively.20 The linewidths in Fig. 3 are also larger than those observed in bulk CZTS. Broadening of Raman peaks has been observed previously for nanocrystals of other materials and attributed to phonon confinement within the nanocrystals.22 In our case, the broadening appears to increase with decreasing size. In principle, this could mask the presence of Raman peaks due to ZnS and SnS2. However, when we anneal films of our nanocrystals, a single sharp peak at 338 cm−1 is observed with no detectable Raman scattering at the frequencies expected for ZnS or SnS2 (Fig. SI-3†). Thus, we conclude that our nanocrystals are CZTS and other sulfide phases are not present, at least within the detection limit of Raman scattering.

After confirming that the nanocrystals were CZTS, we proceeded to examine their optical properties. As stated above, effects due to quantum confinement have not yet been observed for CZTS nanocrystals. In general, the optical transitions of a bulk semiconductor should shift to higher energy if the optically excited electron hole pair is confined within the nanocrystal boundary.23,24Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra from our nanocrystals as a function of size. The edge of the optical absorption spectrum as well as the lowest energy absorption peak shift to higher energy as the diameter decreases from 7 to 2 nm. While this shift is not pronounced between 7 and 5 nm, it becomes more evident when the average diameter is reduced to 2.5 nm and then further to 2 nm. There was no photoluminescence from the nanocrystals. Using the values of dielectric constant and effective masses from ref. 25, we estimate the exciton Bohr radius, aexc, for CZTS nanocrystals to be between 2.5–3.3 nm.22 Thus, we expect the nanocrystals with diameters less than ∼3 nm to begin exhibiting quantum confinement effects consistent with our experimental observations.

In summary, we report a synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals where the average nanocrystal diameter could be changed controllably between 2 and 7 nm. Characterization using HRTEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy confirm the phase purity of the CZTS nanocrystals. Our smallest nanocrystals exhibit shifts in their optical transitions which are consistent with quantum confinement.
