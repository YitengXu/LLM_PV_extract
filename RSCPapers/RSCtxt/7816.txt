    , Accepted 2nd July 2018First published on 2nd July 2018AbstractLong-term device stability is one of the most critical issues that impede perovskite solar cell commercialization. Here we show that a thin layer of a functional hygroscopic polymer, poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, on top of the perovskite thin film, can make perovskite-based solar cells highly stable during operation and in a humid atmosphere. We prove that PEO chemically interacts with lead ions on the perovskite surface, and thus passivates undercoordinated defect sites. Importantly, defect healing by PEO not only results in an improvement of the photo-voltage but also makes the perovskite thin film stable. We demonstrate that the hygroscopic PEO thin film can prevent water inclusion into the perovskite film by screening water molecules, thus having a multi-functional role. Overall, such interface engineering leads to highly durable perovskite solar cells, which, in the presence of PEO passivation, retained more than 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency over 15 h illumination, under load, in ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. Our findings experimentally reveal the role of interface engineering in mastering the instability of perovskite materials and propose a general approach for improving the reliability of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
Lead halide perovskites have been extremely successful in lab-scale photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, and reliability remains the main challenge to bring such technology to the market. Once the critical degradation processes have been identified, adequate encapsulating materials can be selected, though the trade-off between performance and cost is often difficult to meet. Long-term exposure to humidity in the atmosphere causes irreversible degradation of perovskite materials. This work presents an approach for perovskite thin film passivation which improves the optoelectronic quality of the semiconductor while also improving the thin film and solar cell stability when working in ambient conditions, thus relaxing the constraints on expensive encapsulating solutions. Such an approach can be integrated regardless of the specific perovskite formulation and is reliable and easy to scale up, being based on insulating hygroscopic polymers. These results show an example of functional encapsulation for educated development of durable and reliable perovskite solar cells.

1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaics by virtue of their highly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE), up to 22% within a few years.1–3 The solution-processable perovskite photovoltaic module is predicted to have the shortest energy payback period of all solar technologies, less than a year.4–6 However, for further development, there still exist challenges related to their high susceptibility to moisture and operational instability under continuous polarization and illumination.7
Degradation of perovskite materials can be caused by humidity, oxygen, light, and heat.7,8 In most studies, water has been considered as the primary cause of the instability of the perovskite because most of the perovskite elements, alkylammonium salts and some lead salts, are hygroscopic.9 Absorbed water in the perovskite layer acts as a catalyst in the whole degradation process and thereby speeds up the decomposition of the perovskite. Especially CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) readily reacts with water to form intermediate byproducts, monohydrates and insulating dihydrates, under continuous water exposure, and eventually decomposes into CH3NH3I and PbI2.10,11 MAPbI3 perovskite films readily undergo degradation when exposed to light and oxygen together.12 The abundant ionic vacancy defects in the perovskite structure have been suggested to be catalytic sites for photo-induced superoxide formation and further degradation.12,13
The water-induced degradation processes of perovskite films can be inhibited by proper device encapsulation with hydrophobic barrier layers. However, effective water barrier layers often require multiple complicated processes or expensive organic–inorganic materials to completely prevent water vapor permeation into perovskite devices.14–16 The use of polymeric hydrophobic barriers, just on top of the semiconductor layer, such as polystyrene17,18 and carbon materials,19 has been suggested to relax the constraints of the encapsulating materials. To protect perovskite from water penetration, the hydrophobic barrier layer should form complete film coverage without pinholes. However, depositing a hydrophobic layer on a hydrophilic perovskite could lead to the formation of thick films, possibly with pinholes, due to unfavorable surface interactions.20,21 These thick and insulating barriers on the perovskite film could also induce high series resistance in the photovoltaic device, so they should be incorporated with additional charge-conductive networks.22,23 In this regard polymer intermixing in the perovskite bulk phase has been proposed to obtain high stability of perovskite devices by improving the morphology of the perovskite films. Various polymers, e.g., poly(ethylene glycol),24 poly(methyl methacrylate),25 poly(4-vinylpyridine),26 and semiconducting polymers,27 were introduced into the perovskite film to achieve humidity resistance by encapsulating grain boundaries of perovskite crystallites in the film. However, processing polymer additive into the perovskite layer needs sophisticated optimization because the blend system could go through harsh phase separation due to its thermodynamic driving force. Moreover, it is not a universal approach for a variety of perovskite precursors and device structures.
Interface engineering of perovskite surfaces by inserting an interfacial layer between the perovskite and charge transport layers has been arousing interest to improve device stability at large.28 The interfacial layers can prevent undesirable chemical reactions, and they keep the capacity of carrier transport at the interface.29,30 These modifications of the perovskite interfaces serve not only as encapsulants against the environment but play multi-functional roles, acting as a semiconductor or charge tunneling layer, reducing carrier recombination at the interface and protecting the perovskite from degradation.31 Recently, W. Tress et al. have shown that light-soaking impairs solar cell performance by generating surface defects that become a new source of non-radiative recombination.32 They conclude that improving long-term perovskite stability needs some focus on adjacent layers as well. Therefore, we need to study more about which properties of interfacial layers could be effective in improving the stability of perovskites.
Here, we design the incorporation of a polymer thin film as an interlayer between the perovskite and the charge extracting layers to improve the environmental and operational stability of perovskite solar cells. To investigate how the hygroscopic polymer influences the moisture-related instability of the perovskite, we chose two representative polymers: a hygroscopic polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO), which absorbs water before the perovskite layer and a hydrophobic polymer, polystyrene (PS), which repels water molecules from the perovskite layer. Although both PEO and PS have already been incorporated in perovskite solar cells, there has been no comparative study to understand what leads to effective protection of the perovskite layer.17,24 We characterized polymer thin film formation on the perovskite, the intermolecular interactions between the polymer and the perovskite film, and their role in the protection of perovskite thin films. We show that the deposition of PEO at the perovskite interface reduces the density of trap states in the semiconductor thin film, prolongs the carrier lifetime, and enhances Voc of planar-structured perovskite devices, therefore increasing the PCE. This strategy can eventually enhance the operational stability of photovoltaic devices, resulting in extended lifespans under continuous illumination in ambient conditions.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Polymer film formation
We chose two polymers, which have different water-compatibilities, hygroscopic PEO and hydrophobic PS (Fig. 1a), and measured the water contact angles (WCAs) of the polymer films, which are ∼11° for PEO and ∼90° for PS (Fig. S1, ESI†). Prepared from polymer solutions in chlorobenzene, the polymer thin films were spin-coated on the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The concentrations of the polymer solutions were controlled in the range from 0.1 to 10 mg ml−1.

(b) Top-view and cross-section SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films passivated with PEO or PS processed from a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 (φ > 0.98). 
With the polymer concentration less than 10 mg ml−1, the processed polymer films on the perovskite would be a few to tens of nanometers thick, which is unlikely to form complete coverage on the perovskite film. Therefore, to estimate the degree of polymer coverage on the perovskite, φ, based on the chemical surface composition, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).33 A very thin polymer layer on the perovskite with incomplete coverage exhibits a Pb signal in its XPS spectra. To calculate the degree of polymer coverage, φ, the relative atomic concentrations (at%) of Pb (the key element of the perovskite layer) are compared before and after polymer deposition by using the equation φ = 1 − [Pb]1/[Pb]0, where [Pb]1 is at% of Pb on the polymer-coated perovskite film and [Pb]0 is at% of Pb on the pristine perovskite film (Fig. S2, Table 1, and Table S1, ESI†). The measured area irradiated by X-rays was ∼2 mm2. However, these values could be underestimated because the film thickness of a few nanometers is thin enough for emission of photoexcited electrons from the underlying perovskite layer. When processing from 1 mg ml−1 polymer solutions, we measured that φ was 0.32 and 0.35 for PEO and PS on the perovskite, respectively. When processing from 10 mg ml−1 polymer concentrations, φ is close to one, which indicates complete polymer coverage on the perovskite films.

We obtained SEM and AFM images of polymer-coated MAPbI3 perovskite films to investigate the polymer film formations on the perovskite (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3, ESI†). The top-view SEM image for the neat perovskite film shows closely packed grains of perovskite crystals with sizes between 200 and 500 nm. The perovskite films which are covered with PEO or PS thin films show smoothed surface morphologies and become obscured due to flattened topologies by polymer infiltration. The cross-section SEM images show that the MAPbI3 perovskite crystals are conformally covered with a polymer thin film, PEO or PS, and the thicknesses of the polymer thin films are about 30 to 40 nm when they are processed from 10 mg ml−1 solutions. The AFM images of PEO-coated and PS-coated perovskites also show smoothened topologies with lower average surface roughnesses: Ra = 31.9 nm for bare MAPbI3, 16.4 nm for PEO–MAPbI3, and 12.7 nm for PS–MAPbI3 (Fig. S3, ESI†).
2.2. Degradation kinetics under high humidity
We obtained optical images of perovskite films degrading at high relative humidity (RH) of 88% over two weeks (Fig. 2a). We chose solutions with a high polymer concentration of 10 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene to form complete coverage on the perovskite. We also scratched the edge of the perovskite films before polymer coating to completely cover every side of the perovskite with the polymer film. As the pristine perovskite is exposed to humid atmosphere, the black color of the perovskite phase changes to transparent, indicating a transition to the hydrated phase.10 In the optical images of the pristine perovskite film without polymer encapsulation, it is observed that small transparent spots appear on the 2nd day, and then grow continuously. The number of hydrated transparent spots continuously increases during hydration all over the surface. The perovskite film with PS encapsulation also shows the emergence of transparent spots on the 3rd day, which keep growing into a large size. Compared to the pristine film without polymer encapsulation, the perovskite film with PS seems to have a lower number of initial nucleation sites which trigger hydration and degradation, but at the 15th day of exposure, they both degrade significantly. We calculate a ratio, ξ, of the white area of the hydrated phase to the black-colored area of the perovskite phase in the optical images by using a graphic tool (Fig. S4, ESI†), which can be related to the degree of hydration. After 15-day aging, ξ calculated from the bare MAPbI3 film is 0.68, and ξ from PS–MAPbI3 is 0.70. On the other hand, PEO–MAPbI3 shows completely different behavior with respect to the reference and the PS-coated perovskite sample. The PEO–MAPbI3 film does not change its aspect even after 15 days, showing a very low ξ of ∼0.02. On the 3rd day, we notice a small white hydrated spot that possibly nucleated from a pinhole on the PEO film, but this spot does not grow on a large scale over 15 days. The UV-vis spectra of each film before and after degradation also support these observations (Fig. 2b and c). The degree of decrease of the absorption coefficient is proportional to the area of the hydrated transparent area. The spectra of the PEO-perovskite show little difference over 15 days of water exposure. The absorption coefficient monitored 700 nm reaches a saturation point after 10 days and then starts a slow degradation (Fig. S5, ESI†), while the pristine and the PS-perovskite exhibit continuous degradation, which agrees with the changes in the appearance of the films. More importantly, even with lower polymer coverage, obtained by depositing the thin film from lower polymer concentration solutions (1–0.1 mg ml−1), similar degradation behavior is observed (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). We thus confirm that the PEO coated perovskite films show enhanced durability regardless of their surface coverage on the perovskite, while the PS-passivated perovskite films do not exhibit protective functionality when exposed to RH as high as 88%.

XRD patterns in the range 9.0° to 17.0° of the degraded films (e) without a passivation layer and with (f) PEO and (g) PS. 
In order to get more detailed information, we also collected structural data on perovskite phases during the hydration process by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on exposure to RH of 88%. The XRD patterns of the three thin films with and without PEO and PS polymer passivation before and after moisture exposure were measured. The diffraction pattern of the as-prepared perovskite film exhibits the tetragonal perovskite phase, crystallizing in the I4cm space group (Fig. 2d). As hydration proceeded, two additional peaks appear as a consequence of hydration, which are related to the formation of the hydrated perovskite complex and PbI2 at 10.5° and 12.7°, respectively.10,34 Focusing on these two diffraction peaks, different behavior is observed depending on the polymer coverage. For the as-prepared perovskite layers, the diffraction peak at 10.5° which corresponds to the hydrated perovskite phase is observed after moisture exposure for one day (Fig. 2e). Later, after 4-day exposure to high RH, the hydrated perovskite phase disappears, and instead, higher signal intensities for the peak of the PbI2 phase are found. This result means that the as-prepared perovskite degrades through hydration and then decomposes into PbI2 and MAI phases. Similar behavior is also found for MAPbI3/PS (Fig. 2g). In this case, the intensities of the peaks attributed to the hydrated perovskite and PbI2 are slightly reduced by 60% when compared to the bare perovskite after moisture exposure, but the transition from hydration to decomposition is seen in a similar manner. On the other hand, the perovskite passivated with PEO does not show any change of perovskite phases into hydrated or decomposed phases, which indicates that MAPbI3/PEO is highly durable even under high RH of 88% over at least 4 days (Fig. 2f).
2.3. Defect passivation by polymer thin films
Interface formation can lead to defect formation and the appearance of new electronic states. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the optoelectronic quality of the interface upon development of the device architecture. The photoluminescence dynamics are strongly sensitive to defect density which affects radiative and nonradiative carrier decay paths. Fig. 3a shows the photoluminescence spectra of three identical MAPbI3 films, two of them interfaced with PEO or PS thin films. To exclude the effect of oxygen in the air, the samples were kept and measured in vacuum (pressure < 10−5 mbar).35 The samples were monochromatically excited at 560 nm, about the center of the solar spectrum, with a power density of about 100 mW cm−2, close to solar excitation conditions. This allows us to properly evaluate the emission properties of the thin films, taking into account the intensity dependence of the emission efficiency due to trap filling phenomena as well as their photo (in)stability35 (see Fig. S9 in the ESI†). The PEO-capped perovskite is about twice as emissive compared to the reference sample, while the PS-capped perovskite film is similar to the reference sample. Consistently, the time-resolved PL dynamics, probed at the emission spectra peaks, show that the carrier lifetime of PEO-capped perovskite becomes much longer with respect to that of the bare perovskite thin film (Fig. 3b and Table S2, ESI†). These results infer that the PEO thin polymer heals defect states on the thin film surface by effective suppression of non-radiative recombination paths. On the other hand, the PL lifetimes are shorter in the PS-capped film, suggesting the formation of further non-radiative recombination centers at the interface between the two materials.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to verify the presence of intermolecular interactions between the perovskite and the polymer thin layer. First of all, we have excluded the role of the polymer terminal groups in the passivation process, as by changing the polymer molecular weight we do not observe significant differences (Fig. S10, ESI†). In Fig. 4a the IR spectra show that the C–O stretching mode at 1060 cm−1 of the bare PEO film shifts to a lower frequency, 1030 cm−1, when it is interfaced to the perovskite in the PEO–MAPbI3 film.36 This peak shift is ascribed to the formation of a coordinate bond between PEO and the perovskite, at the film surface, by sharing of the lone electron pair on the C–O of PEO with the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+ in the perovskite,26,37–39 (Fig. S11, ESI†).

To obtain in-depth understanding of the chemical interaction between the perovskite and the polymer thin film, XPS measurements were carried out (Fig. 4b and c). Core level scans of Pb4f for each sample are compared. The Pb4f core level of the pristine sample contains two features, one at higher binding energy (142.8 eV) and the other at lower binding energy (138 eV). However, the PEO-coated sample exhibits additional peaks at lower binding energy (141 and 136 eV), which correspond to the presence of Pb–O bonds.40 They are attributed to the coordinate bonding between Pb(II) from the perovskite and O from PEO. On the other hand, the PS-coated sample shows no difference from the pristine perovskite, which means that PS does not have a chemical interaction with the perovskite. These XPS results suggest that the PEO polymer interacts with the perovskite, forming a Pb–O bond which would passivate the anion vacancies. It was reported that the perovskite could be passivated by oxygen from the atmosphere. However it cannot be a stable solution on the long-term.35,41 In this study, we demonstrate that PEO passivates defects which can directly or indirectly lead to non-radiative recombination in MAPbI3, with an approach which is technologically relevant.
2.4. Device characteristics and operational stability

Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic device characteristics with and without polymer passivation on the perovskite film. We fabricated photovoltaic devices whose structure was a standard architecture, FTO/compact TiO2/C60/MAPbI3/PEO or PS passivation/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. By varying the polymer concentrations, we could control the degree of polymer coverage, φ, from 0.21 to 0.99 to optimize the device performance. The photovoltaic parameters of MAPbI3 devices are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 5a. The MAPbI3/PEO device with φ of 0.21 shows an enhancement of PCE on average compared to the reference MAPbI3 device (see also Fig. 5d). However, the MAPbI3/PEO device with high φ of 0.97 exhibits a significant reduction of PCE due to a low fill factor and large hysteresis, which are attributed to high series resistance and reduced tunneling current through the insulating PEO interlayer. It should be noted that the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the MAPbI3/PEO device increases from 1.05 to 1.10 V with a PEO coverage φ = 0.21 (Fig. 5b). This increase in Voc well reflects the defect-passivation by PEO which was anticipated from PL studies. The EQE spectra also match a slight increase in Jsc of the PEO device from 19.6 to 19.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c). On the other hand, the MAPbI3/PS devices do not show an increase in Voc (see Fig. 5d for the statistical behavior of device performance). This is in agreement with the spectroscopic studies that show no interaction of PS with the perovskite and the formation of interface defect states. The PS based devices show comparable photovoltaic performance when using formulations leading both to high and low coverage on pristine thin films (Fig. S12, ESI†). These results indicate that the PS polymer thin film forms an efficient charge-tunneling layer even with full polymer coverage in contrast to the PEO devices. To elucidate the charge tunneling properties, we measured dark J–V curves of the MAPbI3 devices with PEO or PS thin films (Fig. S13, ESI†). The MAPbI3/PEO devices show a clear reduction of the on-current at an applied voltage of 1.4 V with increasing surface coverage of PEO, while the MAPbI3/PS devices show a negligible reduction of the on-current. The efficient charge tunneling properties of PS film have also been reported.17,42 We speculate that the hydrophobicity of the PS polymer might induce incomplete coverage on the perovskite with some nanoscale pinholes.21 To visualize the PS film formation on the perovskite, we measured an AFM image of PS-MAPbI3, which shows that the PS polymer does not form a conformal film on the perovskite crystals, still having uncovered area exposed (Fig. S14, ESI†). This PS film formation would result not only in efficient charge tunneling through the nominally thick insulating PS film,42 but also in water penetration through it, finally driving degradation of the MAPbI3/PS device in a humid environment. On the other hand, the AFM image of the PEO film shows that the PEO polymer completely conformally covers the surface of the perovskite crystals, which could be attributed to intermolecular interactions between PEO and the perovskite.

To examine the effect of PEO-passivation on the device stability, we performed aging tests of high-performance non-encapsulated perovskite devices in controlled conditions. To investigate the solar cells degradation under hydration, we exposed the devices to a high humidity environment (RH = 88%) in dark. We measured the devices periodically, and each time it was exposed to light for 1 min at the maximum power point (MPP) (Fig. 6a). The reference device shows accelerated, continuous degradation of PCE from 15% to 1% in 120 h. The slope of degradation became steeper after the 3rd day due to the accelerated decomposition in PbI2 and MAI. This behavior is identically observed for the PS-capped devices with PS coverages φ = 0.35 and φ = 0.99. PEO-capped devices, with PEO coverages of only φ = 0.32, show a 20% loss over 120 h exposure to humid air (RH = 88%). Importantly, these degradation trends mirror those reported for thin film absorbance at 700 nm (Fig. 6a and 2 and Fig. S5, ESI†), inferring that the slower degradation rate is the result of the slowing down of the perovskite hydration process. To further understand the role of PEO in device protection from hydration, we also tested the film passivated by poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), another hydrophilic polymer, which also has a polar moiety, but is not so hygroscopic as PEO. It shows similar degradation behavior as the reference sample (Fig. S8 of ESI†). Then, we fabricated a complete device where the PEO layer is on top of the Au electrode, instead of between the electrode and the perovskite layer. We examined its shelf-life stability upon exposure to 88% RH over seven days, which shows that the over-coated PEO layer successfully protects the perovskite device from hydration-driven degradation (Fig. S15, ESI†). This result suggests that the hygroscopic properties of the PEO polymer make a relevant contribution to the stability of the device.
 Fig. 6  (a) Shelf life test for the evolution of normalized PCE for the devices without and with PEO or PS kept for 14 days of storage in air at RH of 88% in the dark. Each average (symbol) and standard deviation (error bar) was calculated from six solar cells. The star symbols represent the time dependent absorbance at 700 nm measured under the same condition as thin films only. Operational stability test for the evolution of PCE of (b) MAPbI3 and (c) FA0.87Cs0.13Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 devices without and with PEO, continuously measured under xenon-lamp simulated full-spectrum AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 equivalent irradiance in air (humidity ∼ 50 RH%) without any ultraviolet filter, held at the maximum power point during ageing, and tested at 0.03 s time intervals. 
The operational stabilities of the devices were monitored by measuring the photocurrent densities at the MPP as a function of time for devices without and with PEO and without further encapsulation. The MPP tracking over 15 h was performed at a humidity of 50% and under 1-sun illumination (Fig. 6b and c). The PCE of the reference MAPbI3 device continuously reduces by 50% over 12 h while the device with PEO decayed much slower, retaining 80% of the initial PCE over 18 h. We also tested a mixed cation FA/Cs perovskite device which has been studied to show higher durability than MAPbI3. The FA/Cs device with PEO shows negligible degradation over 14 h continuous illumination at the MPP, retaining ∼100% of the initial PCE. In contrast, the bare FA/Cs device degrades, showing a 25% decrease in PCE. The PV figures of merit at the beginning and the end of the aging study are summarized in Table 3. Note that in such a test, when PEO is used on top of the gold electrode directly, the device performance does not remain as good as when the PEO is used as an interlayer (Fig. S15 of ESI†), which suggests that encapsulation by a hygroscopic polymer enhances the hydration resistance of the perovskite device, but the defect passivation of PEO is also needed to improve its operational stability.

3. Conclusions
We have proposed an effective strategy of interface engineering for improving the stability of perovskite solar cells. We use a hygroscopic polymer, PEO, as interlayer between the perovskite and charge extracting layer which allows to obtain reproducible high-quality thin films on the hydrophilic perovskite. The hygroscopic polymer strongly slows down the perovskite hydration process by absorbing water before the perovskite does. Spectroscopic studies demonstrate that the lone electron pairs of the PEO polymer bond with undercoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite surface. This results in the passivation of defect sites on the perovskite surface and the reduction of the loss channels. These two beneficial aspects of PEO, protecting the perovskite from hydration and passivating defects, improve the operational device stability under exposure to high humidity, illumination and polarization. In fact, we demonstrated highly durable perovskite solar cells with PEO passivation which retained more than 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency over 15 h illumination, under load, in ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. This study provides not only fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanism of perovskites but also a promising strategy to protect the perovskite layer by using a functional polymer layer.
4. Experimental section
Materials
All materials were purchased and used as received. PbI2 and PbBr2 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were obtained from Dyesol. Cesium bromide, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), polystyrene (PS, MW ∼ 180000) and chlorobenzene (anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD was from Luminescence Technology Corp. Polyethylene oxide (PEO, MW ∼ 10000) was obtained from Dae Myung Chemical, Korea.
Film fabrication
FTO-coated glass was etched with zinc powder (zinc powder, Sigma Aldrich) and 2 M aqueous HCl solution for the electrode pattern. The FTO substrates were sequentially washed with 2% Hellamanex in water, deionized water, iso-propanol, acetone, and iso-propanol in a sonication bath for ∼15 min, followed by O2 plasma cleaning for 10 min. A patterned and cleaned transparent conducting oxide substrate was covered with a ∼30 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer by spin-coating of a titanium diisopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 2-propanol (0.05 M) at 450 °C. The C60 layer was deposited from a C60 solution (10 mg ml−1) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by spin-coating at 3000 rpm, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min.
For the MAPbI3 film, a 1.4 M solution of PbI2 and MAI (1:1 molar ratio) in dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a volume ratio of 9:1 was deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating, and then 0.1 ml of toluene was dropped on the rotating substrate. The resulting transparent film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min.
The mixed cation FA/Cs perovskite was prepared by dissolving different molar quantities of 1.21 M PbI2, 1.21 M FAI, 0.24 M PbBr2, and 0.24 M CsBr in 1 L solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a volume ratio of 4:1.
For polymer passivation, we prepared PEO and PS solutions in chlorobenzene with various concentrations from 0.1 to 10 mg ml−1. The polymer solutions were deposited on the perovskite film by spin-coating at 4000 rpm. And then the polymer/perovskite film was dried for 10 min in the glove box.
For photovoltaic device fabrication, a spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 73 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 ml chlorobenzene (99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich), to which were added 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 17.5 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg LiTSFI in 1 ml acetonitrile, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). This fabrication process was carried out under controlled conditions in a glove-box atmosphere. Finally, 75 nm gold was thermally evaporated on top of the device at a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar to form the back contact. The active area of the complete device was 0.08 cm−2.
Characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra are recorded with a UV-vis Varian Cary 5000. Perovskite films were prepared on bare glass substrates. XRD patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.544060 Å) anode, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. All the diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature, with a step size of 0.02° in symmetric 2θ/ω scan reflection mode and an acquisition time of 1 s.
The FT-IR spectra of the perovskite films deposited on silicon substrates are measured using a PerkinElmer 2000 FTIR spectrometer, in transmission mode. Measurements are carried out in the 100–4000 cm−1 range. The substrate contribution is removed from the measured data.
X-ray photoelectron spectra were taken using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific) using a monochromated Al Kα source (1486.6 eV).
SEM images were obtained using a JCM-6010LV, JEOL at 15–20 kV electron beam.
The contact angle measurements were performed using the OCA 15 EC system. The values were determined by dropping a volume of 1 μl of water on the different substrates using the sessile drop method. Digital images were captured with a CCD-camera (resolution of 752 × 852 pixels), and the values of the contact angle were extracted using the SCA-20 software.
Steady-state photoluminescence
Excitation light was provided by a CW diode laser (Oxxius laserboxx, wavelength 560 nm). MAPbI3 films were mounted inside a vacuum chamber (pressure < 10−5 mbar), and PL was collected in reflection mode and focused into a fiber coupled to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics Maya Pro 2000).
Time-resolved photoluminescence
Time-resolved PL measurements were performed with a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) setup. The excitation source was an unamplified tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, temporal and spectral bandwidths of ∼140 fs and ∼5 nm, respectively), which was tuned to a central wavelength of 700 nm. The measurements were performed with excitation at 2 MHz, which was achieved using an acousto-optical modulator pulse picker (APE Pulse Select). The sample was excited with an excitation density of about 7 × 1015 cm−3. The samples were mounted in a chamber under vacuum, and PL was collected in reflection mode and focused onto a spectrometer coupled to a N2 cooled photomultiplier.
Photovoltaic characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source meter in air without any device encapsulation. The simulated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) irradiance was provided with a class AAA Newport solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell with a spectral mismatch factor of 0.99. For the J–V measurement, the scan rates were 0.05 V s−1 for slow scans and 0.2 V s−1 for fast scans. The forward scan started from 0 V (the short circuit condition) to 1.4 V, while the reverse scan was from 1.4 V to 0 V. Pre-conditional stress was not done for PV measurements. The stabilized maximum power output was recorded for more than 90 s. The EQE was measured with a home-built setup. EQE spectra were recorded using the monochromated (Bentham) output from a tungsten halogen lamp calibrated with a Newport UV-818 photodiode. For the humidity degradation test, we controlled the relative humidity in a closed glass jar where water was vaporized from a saturated salt solution of potassium chloride. We kept perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in the glass jar under relative humidity of 88 ± 1% in the dark at room temperature. We measured the RH value of the chamber in which we kept perovskite films and devices by using a hygrometer.

Broader context
Lead halide perovskites have been extremely successful in lab-scale photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, and reliability remains the main challenge to bring such technology to the market. Once the critical degradation processes have been identified, adequate encapsulating materials can be selected, though the trade-off between performance and cost is often difficult to meet. Long-term exposure to humidity in the atmosphere causes irreversible degradation of perovskite materials. This work presents an approach for perovskite thin film passivation which improves the optoelectronic quality of the semiconductor while also improving the thin film and solar cell stability when working in ambient conditions, thus relaxing the constraints on expensive encapsulating solutions. Such an approach can be integrated regardless of the specific perovskite formulation and is reliable and easy to scale up, being based on insulating hygroscopic polymers. These results show an example of functional encapsulation for educated development of durable and reliable perovskite solar cells.
