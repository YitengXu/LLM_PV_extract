    , Accepted 29th January 2018First published on 29th January 2018AbstractHere, we demonstrate a novel solution-based route for deposition of tin monosulfide (SnS) thin films, which are emerging, non-toxic absorber materials for low-cost and large-scale PV applications via thermo-reducing Sn(IV) to Sn(II). Upon optimizing the morphology of the SnS layer via adding a seed layer, the SnS-based hybrid solar cells show promising photocurrent conversion efficiencies.
The goal of preparing low-cost solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies using normal and non-toxic materials via a simple large-scale process motivated researchers in the last few years to develop and investigate materials. Based on this, tin monosulfide (SnS) attracted more and more attention since it is a promising and emerging thin-film absorber candidate.1–4 SnS is natively p-type with ideal parameters for a solar cell absorber.5–7 Due to its high optical absorption coefficient in the visible spectrum (>105 cm−1), film thicknesses below 1 μm are sufficient to absorb most of the incident sunlight.8
Despite their promising photovoltaic properties, devices based on SnS are still underperforming compared to those with a theoretical maximum efficiency of 32%, assuming a bandgap of 1.1 eV. In recent years, NREL-certified record efficiencies of η = 3.88% and η = 4.36% have been achieved via thermal evaporation (TE) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), respectively.8,9 Moreover, a range of fabrication methods have been developed for the preparation of photoactive SnS thin films.8–11 However, these techniques of deposition of SnS are either vacuum-based, high cost or involve slow deposition rates, which are not favourable for the low-cost and large-scale production. Solution processing of inorganic semiconductor thin films is a promising, scalable method for the manufacture of thin-film photovoltaics, such as CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) and Cu2ZnSe4−ySy (CZTSSe).12–14 Recently, with increasing interest on SnS materials, a few solution-phase deposition methods have been developed.15–18 However, developing a simple, scalable and promising solution-phase method is still a challenge for industrializing SnS materials.
For solution-phase deposition methods, precursor solutions consisting of all inorganic molecular metal chalcogenide complexes are particularly interesting as they can lead to highly homogeneous films without adverse organic contaminants.19 Hydrazine- and ammonium sulfide-based solutions containing the dimeric thiostannate(IV) complex [Sn2S6]4− have been utilized in different technological applications to improve the electronic properties.20,21 The thermally decomposed thiostannate(IV) complex has been used as the source of SnS2, which acts either as electronic “glue” between nanoparticles or as a building block for multinary phases.19–24 An example of the latter is the CZTSSe solar cells formed by using [Sn2X6]4− (X = S and Se) complexes, which have recently attracted great scientific and technological interest.22 In this communication, we report the synthesis of SnS nano-plate thin films by solution-phase deposition via a thermo-reducing thiostannate(IV) complex with a small molecule reducing agent. This synthesis is scalable and thus complements the range of materials that may be presently produced by liquid-phase exfoliation. This is a significant step forward towards a simple and stable formation of SnS thin films.
SnS films were prepared by a novel solution-phase thermo-reducing route (details of the experiment and the reaction route are provided in the ESI†). Firstly, a precursor solution containing HDC and a dimeric thiostannate(IV) complex [Sn2S6]4− in 25 wt% (NH4)2S aqueous solution was deposited on FTO glass by spin coating to form a precursor layer. In the precursor layer, the ionic dimer complexes (thiostannate(IV)) and hydrazine ions (reducing agent) are interlaced with each other due to coulombic interactions of the negative and positive charges, which is convenient for the reaction. The precursor layer was then converted into SnS by sequential thermal annealing in N2 gas. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the annealing temperature which was appropriate to convert Sn(IV) to Sn(II) with hydrazine. After drying the solution in situ at 100 °C for 10 min, the sample was further heated to 400 °C. A peak at 250 °C was observed which was consistent with the heat flow change due to the reduction of Sn(IV) to Sn(II) (in Fig. S1 of the ESI†). Therefore, the sequential annealing temperature was set to 300 °C in a N2 stream for 30 min for converting SnS2 to SnS completely. Moreover, the SnS film was carried over from annealing at 300 °C in a N2 stream for 30 min for crystalline growth.
For confirmation and discussion of the crystal growth, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the deposited films using precursor solutions without and with hydrazine dihydrochloride after sequential annealing at 300 °C in a N2 stream. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the films deposited by the precursor solutions with and without HDC. The diffraction pattern of the film with HDC exhibited a 100% intensity peak (2θ = 32°), indexed to the (040) reflection of orthorhombic Pnma SnS (JCPDS card No. 00-039-0354), with all of the other peaks also matching the SnS phase. On the other hand, the diffraction pattern of the film without HDC shows a pure hexagonal phase of SnS2, which is in good agreement with the reported values (JCPDS card No. 22-0951). The XRD data are distinctly different between the films prepared with and without HDC, and matched with those of SnS and SnS2, respectively. Moreover, the optical properties of the two kinds of films were characterized by diffuse reflectance UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy using an integrating sphere. Fig. 1(b) shows the absorption spectrum of the two films prepared with and without DHC. In the absorption spectra of the film prepared with HDC, an absorption peak slightly under 1000 nm corresponds to the direct band gap of approx. 1.22 eV, and a weaker absorption edge between 1100 and 1150 nm matches with an indirect band gap of approx. 1.11 eV of the SnS materials, which are determined by Tauc analysis (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).25 On the other hand, the absorption spectra of the film without HDC show the maximum absorption at 420 nm, which is in accordance with SnS2.20,21

For further material analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the materials prepared with HDC revealed a measured binding energy of 485.8 eV for the Sn 3d5/2 (in Fig. 2(a), black line), in close agreement with the literature values of SnS.26 On the other hand, for investigating the deposition route, a film of the as-deposited precursor layer was also performed by XPS measurements. In Fig. 2(a), the red line is the spectrum of the as-prepared precursor layer, as well as before thermo-reduction, which shows a higher binding energy of Sn 3d5/3 (∼0.9 eV) than the black line (after thermo-reduction). Furthermore, these were assigned to the single oxidation states of tin Sn(II) and Sn(IV), respectively, and the single, clear, high-intensity peaks in these spectra confirm the phase purity of both materials.24 Based on the XPS spectrum of Sn 3d5/2, we considered that the Sn4+ ions of the precursor film were almost reduced, resulting in the formation of SnS after the thermo-reduction process. Moreover, the binding energy of N 1s was also monitored for estimating the molecule reducing agent of HDC by XPS (shown in Fig. 2(b)). Before the thermo-reduction process, the XPS spectra show that N was contained in the precursor layer (the spectra of N 1s showed two binding energies N–N and N–H assigned to NH4+ and HDC, respectively27); after thermo-reduction, the N was not detected on the surface. The chemical composition analysis of SnS materials was carried out using TEM-EDX analysis (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The result of EDX analysis indicated that the nano-plate material showed an element ratio of Sn to S to be almost 1:1, thereby supporting the formation of tin monosulfide.

Next, the synthesized SnS was used as an absorbant material, which is suitable to prepare a hybrid solar cell of FTO/TiO2/SnS/P3HT/Ag.17 However, SnS films directly deposited on a TiO2 surface show either a very poor morphology of the prepared device (see Fig. S4(a) of the ESI†) or a poor photo-conversion efficiency (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Therefore, before spin-coating the precursor layer, we add a seed layer of SnS2 (FESEM image shown in Fig. S6 of the ESI†) on the TiO2 surface to optimize the SnS growth (details of the experiment are mentioned in the ESI†). Using the SnS2 seed layer, the SnS nanoplates were vertically and densely grown on the seed layer surface (see Fig. S4(b) of the ESI†). We note that during the thermo-reduction process, the molecule reducing agent (HDC) attached and diffused into the seed layer to react with a dimeric complex. SnS nano-plates were synthesized and further grown from the surface of the bottom layer, thus resulting in densely and vertically grown SnS nano-plates. Therefore, HDC is selected as the reducing agent since it is not only suitable to prepare a clear aqueous precursor solution but also preferable to interlacing with anionic thiostannate(IV). And then, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) was deposited by spin coating to form hybrid solar cells. FESEM images of the prepared hybrid film (Fig. 3(a)) reveal that the pores and voids of the SnS layer are homogeneously filled with P3HT. The cross-section image of the hybrid film shows dense and vertical nanoplates, which have a thickness of 80–100 nm and vary in diameter ranging from a few 200 nm up to 1 μm. Moreover, the UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 4(a)) was also recorded for identification of the formation of hybrid films. The photo-conversion efficiencies of a hybrid solar cell of glass/FTO/TiO2/SnS/P3HT/Ag are shown in Fig. 4(b), which were measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The solar cell exhibits a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.56 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 256 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.39, which leads to a PCE of 1.05%.

In summary, SnS nanoplate films were directly deposited on a substrate using a solution-based method via a sequential thermo-reduction process (the schematic graph of the mechanism and the probable chemical formula are shown in Scheme S3 of the ESI†). A clear precursor solution containing anionic dimer complexes (thiostannate(IV)) and cationic hydrazine (reducing agent) is the key of this experiment, which supports not only a simple and rapid solution-based spin coating method for film deposition but also a full inorganic process without adverse organic contaminants. Furthermore, by adding a seed layer, the SnS nano-plates were vertically and densely grown on n-type TiO2 films to form hybrid solar cells with an organic conjugated polymer (P3HT). After optimizing the morphology of SnS films using a seed layer, the hybrid solar cells showed very promising short-circuit currents and photo-conversion efficiencies (∼10 mA cm−2 and 1.05%, respectively) compared to films without a seed layer device (∼2 mA cm−2 and 0.11%, respectively). However, further optimizing the morphology of the SnS layers and the nano-size of the SnS nano-plates is the goal of current research to obtain more compact and denser films. Moreover, this solution-phase method provides a novel idea for the deposition of metal chalcogenide films of low oxidation state metal ions, such as Sn2+ and Cu2+.
