    , Accepted 30th April 2012First published on 30th April 2012AbstractThe photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA) as acceptor was optimized by using 3 vol% high boiling point solvent additive of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 1,8-octanedithiol (OT) or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) without solvent annealing. The optimized PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) with 3 vol% CN and pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.40% with Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 11.35 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.0%, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE of 7.40%, the Voc of 0.87 V, and the FF of 75.0% are all the highest values reported in the literature so far for P3HT-based PSCs. The high efficiency is due to the optimized P3HT/IC70BA interpenetrating network and stronger absorption of the active layer by using the additive treatment. Taking into account the advantages of thickness-insensitivity and good reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT-based PSCs as well as the simple device fabrication processes without the need of solvent annealing, the high-efficiency PSCs based on P3HT:IC70BA using CN additive are very promising for future commercialization of PSC devices.
Introduction
Since the first report on the bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) in 1995,1 studies on PSCs have drawn great attention,2–6 especially in recent years, as the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs quickly increased to 7–8%.2,3
PSCs are commonly composed of a blend active layer of a conjugated polymer donor5 and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor6 sandwiched between a PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)) modified ITO (indium tin oxide) as positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode. Among the photovoltaic materials used in PSCs, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are the most representative donor and acceptor materials, respectively, and the PCE of the PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM can reach over 4% by thermal treatment,7 solvent annealing,8 as well as mixture solvent treatment.9 Moreover, the high efficiency of the P3HT-based devices is reproducible in different laboratories. The optimized active layer thickness of the devices is thicker (ca. 200 nm) and the photovoltaic performance is insensitive to the thickness in the range of ∼100 to 300 nm (ref. 10) which benefits from the higher hole mobility and preferred morphology of P3HT. The thicker active layer of the P3HT-based PSCs is very important for future low-cost and large-area fabrication of the PSCs by solution-processing. Nevertheless, the relatively higher lying HOMO energy level (ca. −4.8 eV)11 of P3HT limits the open circuit voltage (Voc) value (Voc is limited to ca. 0.6 V) of the PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM, because of the relatively lower lying LUMO level (−3.91 eV)6 of PCBM and that Voc of the PSCs is proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.12 Obviously, appropriately raising the LUMO energy level of the acceptor should be desirable for improving the Voc and PCE of the P3HT-based PSCs. Therefore, several new fullerene derivatives with higher-lying LUMO energy levels than PCBM were synthesized in recent years, and the Voc of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the new fullerene derivatives as acceptor increased significantly.13–21
In the new fullerene derivatives, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) with a LUMO level at −3.74 eV, which is 0.17 eV up-shifted than that of PCBM,15 showed excellent photovoltaic performance with Voc of 0.84 V and PCE of 6.48% when it is used as acceptor in the P3HT-based PSCs.16a Meanwhile, a corresponding C70 derivative, indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA, see its molecular structure in Fig. 1), was also synthesized.17 IC70BA also possesses a higher LUMO energy level of −3.72 eV which is 0.19 eV higher than that of PCBM. The PSCs based on P3HT/IC70BA with methyl-thiophene additive demonstrated a higher PCE of 6.69% with a high Voc of 0.86 V, by using solvent annealing and pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min.18a

Although higher PCE has been attained for the PSCs based on P3HT/IC70BA, solvent annealing is not convenient for large area fabrication in future application of PSCs. Obviously, it is desirable to develop a simple method without the solvent annealing process for getting high efficiency PSCs. Actually, the key point in the solvent annealing is controlling the morphology and nanoscale phase separation of the donor/acceptor interpenetrating network in the active layer of the PSCs.8 The same goal can be realized by using solvent additives in the blend solution of the donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials. In recent years, some solvent additives, such as 1,8-octanedithiol (OT),22,23 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),22,24,25 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH),25 nitrobenzene (NB),26 3-methylthiophene,18a 3-hexylthiophene (3HT),27 oleic acid (OA),28N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP)23 and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN),29 have demonstrated improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs without the need of solvent annealing.
Stimulated by the high photovoltaic performance of the P3HT/IC70BA-based PSCs17,18 and the effective improvement of the photovoltaic properties by the additives, in this work, we carried out detailed device optimization of the PSCs based on P3HT:IC70BA by using different solvent additives including 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 1,8-octanedithiol (OT) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (see Fig. 1), instead of solvent annealing. Under the optimized conditions with the weight ratio of P3HT:IC70BA(1:1, w/w) and 3 vol% CN and pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, a PCE as high as 7.40% was achieved with a Voc of 0.87 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.35 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.0%, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE of 7.40%, the Voc of 0.87 V, and the FF of 75.0% all are the highest values reported in literature so far for the P3HT-based PSCs.
Results and discussion
Effect of additives on the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs
We fabricated the PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) (200 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), where P3HT was used as donor and fullerene derivative IC70BA was used as acceptor. The active layer of the devices was prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of P3HT/IC70BA with or without additives; solvent annealing was not performed for the PSCs.

Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs without pre-thermal annealing under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performance data of the PSCs, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values, are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs improved significantly by using the solvent additives. The PSC without additive treatment only exhibited a low PCE of 1.15% with Jsc of 2.69 mA cm−2. After additive treatment, the Jsc and PCE increased greatly to 6.23 mA cm−2 and 2.97% for the DIO additive, 6.52 mA cm−2 and 3.09% for the OT additive, 7.11 mA cm−2 and 3.45% for the NMP additive, and 7.09 mA cm−2 and 3.77% for the CN additive.

Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performance data of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2 for a clear comparison. Obviously, with the pre-thermal annealing treatment, the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT:IC70BA without or with additive treatment all showed great improvement. With the pre-thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C for 10 min, the PSC without additive treatment showed a PCE of 4.12% with Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 7.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.1%. With the treatment of the solvent additive, the Jsc and PCE increased significantly to 10.11 mA cm−2 and 6.00% for the DIO additive, 10.54 mA cm−2 and 6.34% for the OT additive, 11.53 mA cm−2 and 7.21% for the NMP additive, and 11.35 mA cm−2 and 7.40% for the CN additive. In particular, the treatment of the additive NMP and CN results in high FF of 72.6% and 75.0% respectively. The Voc of 0.87 V, FF of 75.0% and PCE of 7.40% for the PSC with the treatment of CN additive are all the best values reported in the literature for the P3HT-based PSCs. In addition, the reproducibility of the high photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with the treatment of the additive is very good. For example, we tested 20 devices with the CN additive; the average PCE of the PSCs is 7.2%. Moreover, the CN or NMP additive treatment is superior to the traditional solvent annealing technique for the P3HT/IC70BA-based PSCs,17,18 which is very important for roll to roll fabrication of large area PSCs in future applications. The excellent photovoltaic performance of the PSC with the additive could be ascribed to the higher boiling point of the additive which is beneficial to the self-organization of P3HT and IC70BA to get the preferred morphology.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the PSCs based on P3HT/IC70BA with pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min are shown in Fig. 4. The PSCs prepared with CN or NMP additive show the highest EQE values, the devices with OT or DIO additive demonstrate medium EQE values, while the PSC without additive displays the lowest EQE value, which is consistent with the tendency of Jsc of the corresponding PSCs.

Effect of additives on the absorption and morphology of the active layers
For understanding the origin of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, absorption spectra and atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology of P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) blend films without or with solvent additives were studied. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of the blend films of P3HT:IC70BA (1:1 w/w) with or without additives spin-coated on quartz at 800 rpm (active layer thickness is ca. 200 nm). It can be seen that the blend films with additives show stronger absorption peaks within the range of 350–610 nm especially with NMP and CN additives. The stronger absorption could be ascribed to the more ordered structure of P3HT with the treatment of additives, and it should be beneficial to the increase of Jsc and EQE values for the PSCs with additives.

The morphology of the active layer of the P3HT/IC70BA thin film plays a critical role on improving the device performance. Interpenetrating networks with phase-separated domains in the active layer provide not only interfaces for charge separation of photo-generated excitons but also percolation pathways for charge carrier transport to the respective electrodes, which can critically affect the fill factor and PCE of the devices. Fig. 6 shows the AFM topography and phase images of the active layer surfaces in the PSCs. The surface roughness of the film without additive is 1.27 nm from the AFM image, while that of the films with using additives of DIO, OT, NMP and CN is reduced to 0.547, 0.590, 0.469 and 0.428 nm, respectively. Obviously, the surface roughness of the films becomes much smoother by using the additives, and the surface of the film with CN additive shows the lowest roughness. The results indicate that the smoother surface of the active layer by using the additives could be beneficial to the higher fill factor (FF) of the corresponding PSCs. In addition, it can be seen clearly from the AFM images that the interpenetrating network in the film without additive is quite poor, and that in the films with additives, it improved greatly. The blend without additive exhibits coarse phase separation between P3HT and IC70BA, with large micrometre-sized domains. In contrast, the addition of solvent additives led to much finer phase separation between the two materials and the formation of fiber-like interpenetrating morphologies at the length scale of ∼20 nm.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also used to investigate the effect of the additive on the interpenetrating networks of the active layer. Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of the active layers with the thickness of 100 nm. TEM images correlate well with the morphologies observed with AFM. These large dimensions are much greater than typical organic exciton diffusion lengths of ∼10 nm (ref. 30) and thereby severely limit device performance. The low Jsc observed in the devices fabricated without additives are attributed to this large-scale phase separated morphology where only a small fraction of the photo-generated excitons could diffuse to reach a P3HT:IC70BA interface. After the addition of solvent additives, phase separation is observed to be on the order of tens of nanometres, with no large aggregates of IC70BA or P3HT observed. This small-scale phase separation is on the order of the exciton diffusion length, and correspondingly large Jsc values are observed for these devices. In addition, it can be seen that the uniformity of the BHJ blend layer with solvent additives was improved obviously. In particular, the active layer with CN additive showed the thinnest and most uniform interpenetrating networks. The uniform interpenetrating networks of P3HT:IC70BA in the films with additives should be responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PSCs. Therefore, the excellent photovoltaic performance of the PSC based on P3HT/IC70BA with CN additive can be ascribed to the optimized P3HT/IC70BA interpenetrating networks in its active layer. Similar AFM and TEM results for the high performance organic solar cells with uniform interpenetrating networks of the active layers were also reported recently.31 Interestingly, the morphologies both before and after addition of CN are nearly identical to those observed by the Frechet's group for a conjugated polymer where a similar increase in Jsc was observed upon addition of CN.29

It is well known that the morphology of the active layer in a BHJ solar cell plays a critical role on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Phase-separated domains in the active layer provide not only interfaces for charge separation of photogenerated excitons but also percolation pathways for charge carrier transport to their respective electrodes, which critically affect the device performance. The nanoscale morphology of the polymer/fullerene blend film is greatly affected by (i) the film processing conditions, (ii) the molar ratio (composition) of the polymer and the fullerene, and (iii) the nature of the solvent additive (if any). In particular, BHJ polymer solar cells exhibit improved device performance after the film morphology is improved by solvent annealing, thermal annealing or by adding additives. Among the approaches to improve the morphology, the addition of solvent additive during the processing of the active layer is the simplest and most effective method, and the solvent additives influence the size of the fullerene domains and enhance the self-assembly of the polymers through the different solubility of the polymer and fullerene and the slightly elongated drying time of the active layer.22–29
In order to fully understand the effect of the additives on the interpenetrating networks of the P3HT/IC70BA blend films, we measured X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the blend films prepared with or without additives, as shown in Fig. 8. A sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = ca. 5.5° corresponding to the (100) orientation of the P3HT crystallite32 was observed in the XRD patterns of the blend films. It can be seen that the intensity of the diffraction peak decreased slightly with adding solvent additives, which agrees with the thinner interpenetrating networks of the blend layers with additive observed in TEM images mentioned above. In addition, the phenomenon of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs being improved via reduction of the crystallinity in the polymer donor was also reported recently.33

Conclusions
In conclusion, we carried out device optimization of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and IC70BA as acceptor by using 3 vol% high boiling point solvent additives of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 1,8-octanedithiol (OT) or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The optimized PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) with 3 vol% CN and pre-thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min exhibits a high PCE of 7.40% with Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 11.35 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.0%, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) with NMP additive also shows high photovoltaic performance with Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 11.53 mA cm−2, FF of 72.6% and PCE of 7.21%. The PCE of 7.40%, the Voc of 0.87 V, and the FF of 75.0% are all the highest values reported in the literature so far for P3HT-based PSCs. The high efficiency is due to the optimized P3HT/IC70BA interpenetrating network and stronger absorption of the active layer by using the additive treatment. The AFM, TEM and XRD results indicate that the surface roughness of the P3HT/IC70BA blend films becomes much smoother and the interpenetrating networks of the active layer are more uniform by using the CN solvent additive, which could benefit the improvement of the photovoltaic performance. Taking into account the advantages of thickness-insensitivity and good reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT-based PSCs as well as the simple device fabrication processes without the need of solvent annealing, the high-efficiency PSCs based on P3HT:IC70BA with CN additive are very promising for future commercialization of PSC devices.
Experimental section
Materials
P3HT (4002-E) was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc. and used as received. Indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA) was synthesized in our laboratory according to the procedures reported in our previous paper.17
Measurements and instruments
Absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The P3HT:IC70BA blend films (1:1, w/w) for the UV-vis absorption measurements were prepared on quartz glass substrates using the same method as that for device fabrication. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement of the surface morphology of samples was conducted on a Nanoscope III (DI, USA) in contacting mode with a 1 μm scanner. The P3HT:IC70BA blend films (1:1, w/w) for AFM measurements were prepared on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates using the same method as that for device fabrication. The bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was carried out on a TECNAI G20, FEI operating at 300 kV. The samples for the TEM measurements were prepared as follows: The thin active-layer (about 100 nm) films were spin-cast on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, and the ITO glass with the active layers were submerged in deionized water (10 min) to make the active layers float onto the air–water interface. Then the floated films were picked up on unsupported 200 mesh copper grids for the TEM measurement. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the P3HT/IC70BA films were measured by a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) operating on active-layer (about 200 nm) films spin-cast on the SiO2 surface which is treated with OTS (a solution of P3HT:IC70BA in ortho-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was spin-cast on top of the OTS-treated SiO2 substrate. Then, the active layer was heated at 150 °C for 10 min).
Fabrication and characterization of the PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG Holdings Co., Ltd (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 15 min. Then PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Clevious P VP AI 4083 H. C. Stark, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter and spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 30 min in air and the thickness of the film was around 35 nm. Then the PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO glass was transferred into a nitrogen glovebox for the subsequent procedures.
The P3HT solution was prepared in ortho-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 17 mg mL−1 and heated to 100 °C and stirred for 3–5 h for complete dissolution, and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The P3HT solution was mixed with 17 mg mL−1 IC70BA to yield a blend solution. The additives were added to the blend solutions before spin coating. The blend solution of P3HT and IC70BA in ortho-dichlorobenzene (DCB) (1:1 w/w) was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 80 s. The active layer was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. The thickness of the photoactive layer is measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Then, the negative electrode consisting of Ca (∼20 nm) capped with Al (∼100 nm) was thermally evaporated on the active layer under a shadow mask in a base pressure of ca. 5 × 10−5 Pa. The device active area is 4 mm2 for all the PSCs discussed in this work. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. Device characterization was done in a glovebox under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 using a 150 W xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (from Newport Co., LTD.). The reference cell is a Schott visible-color glass-filtered (KG5 color filtered) Si diode (Hamamatsu S1133). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
