    , Accepted 26th June 2020First published on 15th July 2020Abstract1,10-Phenanthroline (phen) was grafted to either indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), or titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductors (SC's) by electrochemical reduction of 5-diazo-phen. The phen ligand is bonded to the semiconductor at C5, and it can be handled in air. The semiconductor-phen (SC-phen) complexes displace both CH3CN ligands from either cis-[Ru(Mebipy)2(CH3CN)2]2+ (Mebipy = 4,4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine), cis-[Ru(tBubipy)2(CH3CN)2]2+ (tBubipy = 4,4′-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), or cis-[Ru(pheno)(bipy)(CH3CN)2]2+ (bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine; pheno = 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione) dissolved in DCM/THF (4 h, 70 °C) to form the corresponding surface-bound SC-[(phen)Ru(bipyridyl)2]2+ chromophores. The identities of the SC-[(phen)Ru(Mebipy)2]2+, SC-[(phen)Ru(tBubipy)2]2+, and SC-[(phen)Ru(pheno)(bipy)]2+ (SC = ITO, FTO or TiO2) chromophores were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); UV-vis and reflectance infrared spectroscopies; and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The data were compared to analogous Ru-polypyridyl control compounds dissolved in solution. A facile ketone-amine condensation solid-phase synthesis reaction between SC-[(phen)Ru(pheno)(bipy)]2+ and [Ru(1,10-phenthroline-5,6-diamine)(bipy)2]2+ in ethanol (80 °C, 1 h) formed the dinuclear, bound chromophore SC-[(phen)(bipy)Ru(tpphz)Ru(bipy)2]4+ (tpphz = tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c:3′′,2′′-h:2′′′,3′′′-j]phenazine). Photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydroquinone and triethylamine under acidic, neutral, or basic conditions showed that the SC-chromophore photoanodes are active, and that TiO2-[(phen)Ru(Mebipy)2]2+ is the most active and stable under basic- and neutral conditions. The dinuclear chromophore SC-[(phen)(bipy)Ru(tpphz)Ru(bipy)2]4+ was most active and stable under potentiostatic conditions in acid.
Introduction
Anthropogenic climate change is the greatest challenge faced by our society.1 Intense, world-wide efforts are underway to develop energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases.2,3 The amount of solar energy that strikes Earth in one hour is equal to the amount of energy consumed by humankind in one year.4,5 In principle, solar energy can fulfill most of humankind's energy requirements, but it is intermittent and diffuse. Efficient, large-scale energy storage, that also delivers the stored energy on demand, is required for the widespread adoption of solar and renewable energy.5–8
A promising method to store solar energy is artificial photosynthesis of either hydrogen from water and sunlight, or hydrocarbons from CO2, water, and sunlight.2,8 In essence, solar energy is stored in the resulting fuel (and O2). Hydrocarbons have enormous gravimetric energy densities, and they can deliver vast amounts of energy over extended periods of time.9,10 Hydrocarbons made by artificial photosynthesis are ideally suitable for applications with these requirements (e.g. transportation, large-scale storage for power or heat),7,9,10 and their utilization would be net CO2 emission neutral. In principle, the CO2 emissions from a conventional power plant can be captured and converted back into hydrocarbons in a zero emission, solar-fuel cycle.9,10 Carbon dioxide can also, in principle, be removed from the atmosphere and converted into solar fuels or commodity chemicals.
Artificial photosynthesis is often carried out in a photoelectrochemical cell.11 Water splitting occurs at the photoanode to produce oxygen, protons, and electrons; and either protons are reduced to hydrogen, or CO2 and protons are reduced to hydrocarbons at the photocathode. A potential is typically applied to prevent back transfer at the electrodes. Systems based upon Z-schemes that operate without applied bias by transferring electrons from the conductance band of the photoanode to the valence band of the photocathode, are also under investigation.12
Photocatalytic water splitting was first reported by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, who utilized TiO2 as a photoanode to oxidize H2O to form O2, protons, and electrons under UV irradiation.13 Narrow band gap semiconductors such as CuWO4/CoPi14 and Ta3N5/KTaO315 have been studied as photocatalysts for water splitting that absorb in the visible light range.16 Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPECs) are an alternative to using one material for both light absorption and water splitting catalysis.5 In DSPECs, the light absorbing material (dye or chromophore) and the catalyst are typically different materials.17 Thereby, both can be optimized for their specific function independently to better tune and understand the overall performance of the DSPEC.18,19
The chromophores that have been investigated in DSPEC's include Zn,20 Os,21 Ir,22 or Ru23 metal complexes. Ru-polypyridyl compounds are the most studied24–27 because they possess relatively strong, tunable metal-to-ligand charge transfer absorbances in the visible range, and their triplet excited states are relatively long-lived.28,29 Further, the ligands can be varied to tune relevant characteristics such as chemical stability, the rates of injection and back electron transfer, excited state potential, and light-absorption range.30,31 Ru-polypyridyl chromophores are typically attached to semiconductor (SC) electrodes through phosphonate- or carboxylate-SC linkages in DSPECs. While these linkages are stable under acidic conditions, they undergo rapid hydrolysis at pHs above 7 and 5, respectively.32 Basic pHs are more desired because most earth-abundant catalysts are stable under these conditions.33 Also, kinetics favor CO2 reduction to H2 evolution at higher pH values.34 Atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 or TiO2 has improved the stability of chromophore/catalyst assemblies.35 A common method to graft a desired organic compound through a covalent bond to an electrode is via electrografting of the corresponding diazonium salt.36–43 Several groups,27,44,45 including our own,46 have reported that Ru-polypyridine chromophores grafted to various surfaces by diazonium ions demonstrate good stability under basic conditions.
The majority of Ru-polypyridyl chromophores undergo one electron processes under light, whereas the reduction of CO2, and related reactions require multiple electron transfers. Dinuclear Ru(II) polypyridal complexes such as [(phen)2Ru(tatpq)Ru(phen)2]4+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, and tatpq = 9,11,20,22-tetraazatetrapyrido[3,2-a:2′3′c:3′′,2′′-l:2′′′,3′′′-n]-pentacene-10,21-quinone),47 or tetranuclear Ru(II) complex [(Ru(phen)2)4(ditatpp)]8+ (ditatpp = dimer of 9,11,20,22-tetra-aza-tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2′3′-c:3′′,2′′-l:2′′′,3′′′]-pentacene linked by a carbon–carbon bond along the central benzene ring)48 can store up to 4 electrons upon irradiation with visible light in presence of triethylamine (Et3N) as sacrificial electron donor. Each one-electron reduction of the bridging ligand is accompanied by protonation to prevent the build-up of negative charge. As well, chromophores with multiple Ru and other metal centers absorb light deeper into the visible range than monomeric chromophores.49,50 Multinuclear chromophores often have poor solubility, however, hampering their purification, characterization, activity measurements, and attachment to electrode surfaces.51,52 A modular synthesis of complex chromophores/catalysts in a step-by-step manner with the starting group covalently bonded to the surface, much like solid-phase synthesis,53,54 would simplify the construction complex systems on electrode surfaces. Specifically, insolubility is not a limitation because the target is already bonded to the electrode, and it is constructed by a sequence of reactions with smaller components dissolved in solution. This simplification of the procedure would allow for rapid optimization by varying the reactants in each step of the sequence. Another advantage of attaching a small component molecule to the semiconductor surface first is that higher surface coverages may be obtained than if the larger molecule was attached to the surface in one step.55
We recently reported the step-wise synthesis of a SC-[(phen)Ru(bipy)2]2+ photoanode (SC = semiconductors, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), with the ruthenium-polypyridyl chromophore covalently bonded to the semiconductor at C5 of the phen ligand. The bond between the SC and C5 was more robust under neutral and basic conditions than phosphonate- or carboxylate-linkages.46 We now report the preparation of a series of monomeric- and a dimeric Ru-polypyridine chromophores to demonstrate the versatility of this synthetic strategy (Scheme 1). We determined the light absorption range, Ru2+/3+ redox potential, and the photoactivity of the resulting photoanodes towards the photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydroquinone or triethylamine under a wide pH, wavelength, and potential range.

Experimental
Materials
Chemicals were used without any further treatment unless mentioned otherwise. Following compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: 1,10-phenanthroline-5-amine (97%), NaNO2 (≥97.0%), TiO2 nanoparticles (anatase, nanopowder < 25 nm particle size, 99.7% trace metals basis), TiCl4 (≥99.995%, trace metals basis), 2,4-pentadione (≥99%), hydroquinone (ReagentPlus, ≥99.5%), NaClO4 (ACS reagent, ≥98.0%), sulfuric acid (99.999%), triethylamine (Et3N, ≥99.0%; distilled), tetrahydrofuran (ACS reagent, ≥99.0%; distilled), dichloromethane (ACS reagent, ≥99.5%; distilled). Anhydrous ethanol, Triton X-100, and perchloric acid were purchased from Commercial Alcohols, EMD Millipore Corporation, and GFS Chemicals (ACS reagent, 70%), respectively. Triply distilled water was used in preparation of aqueous solutions.
Fabrication of FTO/TiO2 electrodes
Fluorine doped tin oxide slides (FTO, Sigma-Aldrich, surface resistivity ∼7 Ω sq−1, cut into 1 × 2.5 cm2) were sonicated in ethanol followed by water for 15 min each. They were then heated in 50 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. TiO2 paste was prepared following reported literature procedure.46 The paste was applied on FTO surfaces using doctor-blade technique (4 layers of scotch tape and TiO2 thickness of ∼10 μm). After drying in air, the electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace, followed by treatment in 50 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. They were rinsed thoroughly with water and heated at 450 °C for 30 min.
Electrochemical grafting of 1,10-phenanthroline
Electrochemical grafting of 1,10-phenanthroline onto FTO (or indium doped tin oxide slides (ITO, Sigma-Aldrich, surface resistivity 8–12 Ω sq−1, cut into 0.8 × 2.5 cm2)) or FTO/TiO2 slides (referred to here as TiO2) was done following our previous report,46 adapted from Ekinci and Bélanger studies.56,57 FTO (or ITO) electrodes were cleaned by sonication in ethanol and water, for 15 min ea. prior to the experiments. Briefly, 0.1 M H2SO4 solution (10 ml) containing 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline-5-amine (1.9 mg) was bubbled with N2 for 15 min. Once 2 mM NaNO2 (1.4 mg) was added, ∼1 cm2 of FTO slide was immersed into the solution as the working electrode. The potential was swept between 0.15 and −0.20 VSCE at 50 mV s−1 for 5 cycles using cyclic voltammetry technique. Coiled platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter and reference electrodes. Phen electrografted electrodes (referred to as SC-phen; SC = FTO, ITO or TiO2) were rinsed with abundant water followed by ethanol and dried in air.
Metallation of chromophore onto SC-phen
[Ru(Mebipy)2(CH3CN)2]2+ (6.0 mg, 0.007 mmol), [Ru(tBubipy)2(CH3CN)2]2+ (6.0 mg, 0.006 mmol), or [Ru(pheno)(bipy)(CH3CN)2]2+ (6.0 mg, 0.006 mmol) were weighed out into a screw cap Schlenk tube inside a glovebox. Distilled dichloromethane (0.8 ml) and THF (4.0 ml) were added to the Schlenk tube. SC-phen electrodes were placed in the Schlenk tube after being kept in the nitrogen flow for a minute. The schlenk tube was heated at 70 °C for 4 h using a paraffin oil bath. Then, the Schlenk tube was removed from the oil bath and cooled to room temperature. The electrodes were rinsed by cannulating ∼5 ml CH2Cl2 into the flask and repeated two more times. The metallated electrodes were kept under N2 and in the dark and tested within 24 h. The prepared electrodes in this manner are labeled SC-[(phen)Ru(Mebipy)2]2+, SC-[(phen)Ru(tBubipy)2]2+, and SC-[(phen)Ru(pheno)(bipy)]2+, which contain Mebipy, tBubipy, or pheno ligands (hereon denoted as SC-RuMePhen, SC-RutBuPhen, and SC-RuOPhen), respectively.
Synthesis of dimeric chromophore onto SC-RuOPhen
4.8 ml anhydrous ethanol containing [Ru(bipy)2(phen-diamine)]2+ (phen-diamine = 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-diamine; 5.0 mg, 0.006 mmol) was cannulated into a screw cap Schlenk tube with SC-RuOPhen electrodes. The flask was heated at 80 °C for 1 h. Then, the electrodes were rinsed with anhydrous ethanol (∼5.0 ml each) three times after the flask cooled to room temperature.
Photoelectrochemistry
For photoelectrochemistry studies, 0.1 M HClO4 solution containing hydroquinone (pH = 1.0), or 0.1 M NaClO4 solution containing either hydroquinone (pH = 7.0) or Et3N (pH = 12.6) were used. Synthesized TiO2-Ru-polypyridyl electrodes were the working electrode. Photoanodes were synthesized and tested at least 2–3 times for each medium (except for SC-RutBuPhen under basic conditions due to its poor performance) and the results presented here are illustrative. The reference and counter electrodes were saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum gauze, respectively. A homemade 100 ml four-neck quartz flask with a flat window was used as the reaction flask. The electrolyte was stirred using a magnetic bar at 500 rpm throughout the measurements. Prior to each measurement, the solution was purged with argon for 30 min, followed by maintaining Ar blanket on top of the solution. The light source was a Newport QEPVSI-b system (300 W Xe lamp with Cornerstone M 260 monochromator), and the incident light intensity was measured with a Thorlab S121C light meter. eqn (1) was used for calculating the IPCE at any specific wavelength:58,59 (1)where i is the obtained photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P is light power density (mW cm−2), and λ is the specific wavelength (nm).
Instrumentation
Electrochemical studies were done using Solartron SI 1287 Electrochemical Interface controlled by CorrWare for Windows Version 2-3d software (without iR compensation). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done using a Kratos Axis 165. A monochromatized Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used at 12 mA and 14 kV, while the pressure in the sample analytical chamber was <1 × 10−9 Torr. Survey scans covered the binding energy of 1100 to 0 eV, with 160 eV analyzer pass energy and 0.3 eV steps. For deconvolution, the spectra are calibrated by C–C binding energy at 285.0 eV. UV-vis spectra were collected using Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrometer for chromophores dissolved in CH2Cl2 or on TiO2 (with TiO2 absorption subtracted). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to obtain the surface coverage of each chromophore using PerkinElmer Elan 6000.
Results and discussion
The diazonium derivative of 1,10-phenanthroline-5-amine was used to electrograft phen to flat FTO or TiO2 nanoparticles pasted on FTO (referred to here as TiO2) electrodes using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as we reported previously (1 mM phen and 2 mM NaNO2 in 0.1 M H2SO4, −0.20 to 0.15 VSCE, 50 mV s−1, 5 cycles).46,57 Fig. S9A and S9B† show the deposition voltammograms. The high cathodic current in the first cycle, followed by the significantly lower values in the remaining cycles, indicate that the majority of the electrochemically active sites are occupied after the first cycle. As expected, the cathodic deposition current over the higher surface area TiO2 electrode was ∼10 larger than over flat FTO.
Fig. S10† shows the high-resolution XPS spectra in the N 1s region (∼400 eV) of FTO, TiO2, FTO-phen, and TiO2-phen. The N 1s peaks at 400 eV for FTO-phen and TiO2-phen, confirm that nitrogen is only present after electrografting, and indicate that the nitrogen is sp2-hybridized in an aromatic phen-type structure.61
Fig. S11† shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of FTO-phen, with sweeping to a lower potential limit than during the electrografting (0.1 M Na2SO4, 0 to −1.0 VSCE, 50 mV s−1). Similar to ITO-phen reported previously,46 the cathodic peak at ∼−0.85 V in the first cathodic sweep is absent in subsequent sweeps. This peak is attributed to two proton-coupled, electron transfers to phen, forming species resembling 1,4-dihydro-1,10-phenanthroline grafted at C5 to the electrode surfaces.57,62 Charge integration of this peak estimates the electrochemically accessible surface coverage to be 3.8 × 10−10 mol cm−2. As expected, this charge is slightly less than those for the corresponding electrografting by reduction of the diazonium (equivalent to 4.45 × 10−9 mol cm−2 assuming it involves 1 e− transfer). Specifically, it is reasonable to expect that a portion of the phen radicals formed during the electrografting of the diazonium do not bond to ITO or TiO2 at electrochemically accessible sites.
The heterogeneous ITO-phen, FTO-phen, and TiO2-phen ligands react to completion over 4 h at 70 °C with either cis-[Ru(Mebipy)2(CH3CN)2](BF4)2 (Mebipy = 4,4′-methyl 2,2′-bipyridine), cis-[Ru(tBubipy)2(CH3CN)2](BF4)2 (tBubipy = 4,4′-tert-butyl 2,2′-bipyridine), or cis-[Ru(pheno)(bipy)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2 (pheno = 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione; bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine) dissolved in THF/CH2Cl2 (5:1) by displacing the CH3CN ligands to form the corresponding surface-bound, heterogeneous SC-[(phen)Ru(polypyridyl)2]2+ complexes (Scheme 1ii).46 The precursor cis-[Ru(pheno)(bipy)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2 was prepared by first reacting cis-RuCl2(pheno)(DMSO)2 (DMSO = dimethylsulfoxide) with bipy in DCB (reflux for 12 h) to prepare cis-RuCl2(pheno)(bipy), followed by reaction with AgOTf in CH3CN to form the target. Fig. 1 shows the CVs of ITO, ITO-phen, and of the ITO-[(phen)Ru(polypyridyl)2]2+ photoanodes recorded in CH3CN (0.1 M NBu4PF6, −1.75 to 1.4 VFc+/Fc (Fc = ferrocene; 100 mV s−1; oxidized silver wire as a reference electrode). The first sweep is in the positive direction, starting at 0 V Fc+/Fc. The ITO was a low specific surface area transparent film on a glass slide. The CV of bare ITO contained only the onset of solvent oxidation at potentials >1 VFc+/Fc.63 The CV of ITO-phen contains a strong anodic peak at ∼0.45 VFc+/Fc that is assigned to a largely destructive oxidation of SC-phen.57 The CVs of the ITO-[(phen)Ru(polypyridyl)2]2+ photoanodes contain large anodic peaks ranging from 0.75 to 0.96 VFc+/Fc in the first positive-going sweep with much smaller cathodic peaks. There are no corresponding large cathodic peaks, showing that these oxidations are irreversible. These are in the range of known potentials for the Ru(II)/(III) oxidation for Ru-polypyridyl chromophores, both in solution and as we reported previously for ITO-RuPhen.24,31 It is well-known that the oxidation of Ru(II) to Ru(III) is largely destructive for Ru-polypyridyl compounds under these conditions.46 The peak current potentials for ITO-RuMePhen, ITO-RutBuPhen, and ITO-RuOPhen were 0.75, 0.83, and 0.96 VFc+/Fc, respectively. The CV of ITO-RuOPhen contained evidence of pheno ligand redox peaks (vide infra). We also found that the pheno carbonyl groups in the ITO-RuOPhen photoanode readily undergo solid-phase condensation with the amine groups in [Ru(bipy)2(phen-diamine)]2+ (phen-diamine = 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-diamine) dissolved in ethanol after 1 h at 80 °C to form the dimeric chromophore bridged by a tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c:3′′,2′′-h:2′′′,3′′′-j]phenazine (tpphz) ligand grafted to ITO (Scheme 1iii). The charge under the Ru(II)/Ru(III) redox peak in the CV of ITO-[(phen)(bipy)Ru(tpphz)Ru(bipy)2]4+ (denoted as SC-RuRu) is ∼2× that of the monomeric Ru chromophores. The estimated E1/2 is 0.85 VFc+/Fc. Similar to ITO-RuOPhen, there appear to be redox peaks from the bridging tpphz ligand in the CV of ITO-RuRu.
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms of the ITO-based electrodes after each step of chromophore synthesis in N2-saturated CH3CN (0.1 M NBu4PF6, 100 mV s−1; the first sweep is in the positive direction, starting at 0 VFc+/Fc). 

Fig. 2 shows the expanded CVs of the free ligand pheno (A), of ITO-RuOPhen (B), and of ITO-RuRu (B) in CH3CN. The CV of the ITO-RuOPhen electrode contains two redox peaks at −0.62 and −1.43 VFc+/Fc. This CV was measured with Einitial = 0 VFc+/Fc, and with the first sweep in the cathodic direction to avoid the destructive oxidation that occurs at higher potentials. These peaks likely arise from two 1-electron redox processes at the carbonyl groups of the pheno ligand, sequentially and reversibly forming the semi-quinone and then the catecholate derivatives. These redox processes are known for the free- and palladium-coordinated pheno ligand.64 The presence of these peaks in the CV of ITO-RuOPhen is more evidence for the successful metalation of ITO-phen by cis-[Ru(pheno)(bipy)(CH3CN)2]2+. Consistent with the observations of Yellowlees et al.,64 coordination to Ru shifts these peaks to more positive potentials from those of the free ligand pheno (Fig. 2A).
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of the (A) 2.5 mM pheno; and (B) ITO-RuOPhen and ITO-RuRu electrodes in N2-saturated CH3CN solution containing 0.1 M NBu4PF6, scan rate: 100 mV s−1. 
The expanded CV of ITO-RuRu contained two redox peaks at −0.53 and −1.36 VFc+/Fc (Fig. 2B). As for ITO-RuOPhen, the CV of ITO-RuRu was recorded with Einitial = 0 VFc+/Fc, and with the first sweep in the cathodic direction to avoid the destructive oxidation that occurs at higher potentials. These peaks likely result from two 1-electron redox processes at the nitrogen centers of the pyrazine group. These redox processes are known for related pyrazine ligands both free- and bonded to ruthenium in solution.64 Converting the carbonyl groups on the pheno ligand into a bridging pyrazine group shifted the peaks to less negative values.

Fig. 3 shows the CVs of the chromophores attached to TiO2 nanoparticles (pasted onto FTO slides). The electrochemically accessible surface area of the TiO2 is notably higher than that of the ITO or FTO films. Potentials below −0.2 VFc+/Fc were avoided to prevent reduction of the TiO2 substrate. The CVs of both TiO2 and TiO2-phen are quite featureless over the potential range. The first sweep started at 0 VFc+/Fc and was in the positive going direction. The large peaks in the first positive going sweep in the CVs of the TiO2-[(phen)Ru(polypyridyl)2]2+ electrodes are substantially larger and better defined than those over flat ITO. As well, although the Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidations were destructive, there was clear evidence of a smaller cathodic peak in the reverse sweep. E1/2 for (in increasing order) TiO2-RutBuPhen, TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RuRu, and TiO2-RuOPhen were 0.67, 0.75, 1.04, and 1.09 VFc+/Fc, respectively. A study of related Ru chromophores attached by phosphonic acid to TiO2 found the E1/2 were similar for Mebipy and tBubipy.30 The more positive E1/2 for the pheno-bipy complex is consistent with these ligands being less electron donating than the Me- and tBubipy derivatives. This order is expected based upon the relative electron donating ability of these ligands/groups. Using integration of oxidation peak, the surface coverages (geometric surface area) of Ru were estimated to be 5.2 × 10−9, 5.2 × 10−9, 1.1 × 10−8, and 5.1 × 10−9 mol cm−2, respectively. As expected, there is roughly twice as much Ru in TiO2-RuRu.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of the TiO2-based electrodes after each step of chromophore synthesis in N2-saturated CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M NBu4PF6, scan rate: 100 mV s−1. 
Fig. S12† shows the Ru 3d and C 1s region of the high-resolution XPS of the FTO and TiO2-based photoanodes. The binding energies of C 1s and Ru 3d sometimes overlap in the 280–290 eV range. The Ru 3d5/2 peak, however, is easily located at 281.4 eV, and is assigned to ruthenium in the +2 oxidation state.65 As expected, this peak is absent in the XPS spectra of the phen controls. Deconvolution of the C 1s peak reveals the Ru 3d3/2 peak at 285.5 eV (peak separation = 4.1 eV), a position also consistent with Ru being present in the +2 oxidation state.66 The atomic ratios of N:Ru in all the photoanodes except TiO2-RuRu (ratio ∼ 7) were estimated from XPS to be ∼6, indicating that the majority of the SC-phen reacted with the cis-[Ru(polypyridyl)2(CH3CN)2]2+ precursors during the metallation step.67 The XPS peaks centered at 285.0 and 286.1 eV (C 1s region) can be attributed to C–C/C–H and C–N bonds, respectively.68

Fig. 4 shows the solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra from 400–700 nm of the Ru-polypyridyl photoanodes using TiO2 as the blank. The insets show the molar extinction coefficient vs. wavelength spectra of the corresponding Ru-polypyridyl chromophores (containing phen as model for SC-phen) dissolved in CH2Cl2. The solid-state UV-vis spectra resemble those of the model chromophores dissolved in solution. There is typically a slight blue shift and broadening of the peaks in the spectra of the SC-chromophores. These shifts and broadening likely result from interactions between the surface and the chromophore bonded at C5. An investigation into the nature of these interactions is beyond the scope of the present study. The UV-vis spectra of Ru(II)-polypyridyl chromophores are well-understood. The major absorptions in the visible region are due to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), with lesser contributions from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT), and ligand-centered (LC) transitions.69 The molar extinction coefficients for the MLCT of the monomeric analogs dissolved in CH2Cl2 were similar. Perhaps not surprisingly, the molar extinction coefficient of RuRu was ∼2× those of the monomeric analogs. As well, the absorptions of RuRu and RuOPhen extended to longer wavelengths than the others.49,70 The surface coverages (Γ) of the Ru-based chromophores on the photoanode were estimated using the ∼450 nm molar extinction coefficient measured for the dissolved chromophore analogs and eqn (2):60 Γ = Aλ/(103 × ελ)(2)where Aλ is the absorption at specific wavelength (λ), and ελ is the molar extinction coefficient at the same wavelength in M−1 cm−1. The Γ was calculated to be 5.6 × 10−9, 5.7 × 10−9, 5.9 × 10−9, and 5.6 × 10−9 mol cm−2 for TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RutBuPhen, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RuRu, respectively. These values are consistent with the coverages estimated from their CVs, indicating that most of SC-phen sites reacted with the cis-[Ru(polypyridyl)2(CH3CN)2]2+ precursors, and that most of the resulting SC-[(phen)Ru(II)(polypyridyl)2]2+ chromophores were electrochemically accessible.

ICP-MS analysis of the Ru solutions obtained by digesting the photoanodes in aqua regia showed that the coverage of TiO2 (geometric surface area) by the chromophores was 5.8 × 10−9, 5.8 × 10−9, 5.1 × 10−9, and 5.7 × 10−9 mol cm−2 (considering 2 Ru for each chromophore) for the TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RutBuPhen, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RuRu electrodes. These loadings are consistent with coverages obtained using CV and solid-state UV-vis absorption.
Taken together, the results from the CV, solid-state UV-vis absorption, XPS, and ICP-MS analyses show that the SC-phen ligands were converted into the target monomeric- and dimeric-Ru(II)-polypyridyl chromophores. The chromophores are anchored by a covalent bond to C5 at electrochemically accessible sites on the semiconductor. Finally, control experiments showed that grafting 1-naphthylene to TiO2 with diazonium chemistry strongly passivates the surface towards the reaction with [Ru(polypyridyl)2(CH3CN)2]2+. It is therefore unlikely that significant amounts of Ru-precursor were deposited onto TiO2 during the reactions between [Ru(polypyridyl)2(CH3CN)2]2+ and TiO2-phen.

Fig. 5 shows the photoelectrochemical activity and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in visible range (410–700 nm) of the TiO2-[(phen)Ru(II)(polypyridyl)2]2+ under basic conditions with Et3N as the sacrificial electron donor (pH = 12.6, 0.5 M Et3N, 0.1 M NaClO4, E = −0.3 VSCE). Lower wavelengths were not investigated, and a UV cutoff filter was employed during these measurements to limit TiO2 photoactivity. The data we reported previously for the TiO2-RuPhen photoanode is included for comparison.46 As shown in Fig. 5A, TiO2-RuMePhen was the most active, closely followed by TiO2-RuPhen, and then by the somewhat less active TiO2-RuRu. The TiO2-RuOPhen and TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanodes were poorly photoactive under these conditions. The IPCE values generally increased for the TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode when the wavelength decreased, reaching 6.6% at 410 nm making it the most active chromophore. As well, none of the photoanodes were significantly photoactive at wavelengths >550 nm, in agreement with their UV-vis spectra. Apart from these rough correlations, there were no obvious connections between the IPCE data and the UV-vis spectra of the chromophores (Fig. 4).

Fig. 5B shows the potentiostatic photocurrent responses of the TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RuRu, and TiO2-RuOPhen photoanodes towards oxidation of Et3N under constant irradiation at 450 nm (pH 12.6, 0.5 M Et3N (close to saturation with highest photoactivity), 0.1 M NaClO4, E = −0.3 VSCE). The TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanode was not noticeably photoactive under these conditions, and it is not shown in the graph. TiO2-RuMePhen was the most active, but the photocurrent density decreased ∼43% (from 7 to ∼4 μA cm−2) over 200 s irradiation at 450 nm. The initial activity of the dimeric TiO2-RuRu was lower (2.2 μA cm−2), but climbed over the 200 s to about the same level (3.6 μA cm−2) as the Mebipy chromophore. The TiO2-RuOPhen photoanode was the least active, but most stable under these conditions. The initial photocurrent of 1.1 μA cm−2 decreased to 0.8 μA cm−2 after 200 s.

Fig. 5C shows the photo-oxidation current response of the TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode towards Et3N after the potential was decreased from −0.3 to −0.75 VSCE. Decreasing the potential greatly increased the stability of the chromophore with only a ∼10% penalty in performance. Specifically, the photocurrent held at 6.3 μA cm−2 over 200 s at −0.75 VSCE, whereas it dropped from 55% from 7.7 to 3.5 μA cm−2 at −0.3 VSCE (Fig. 5B). Further, the photo-oxidation current was ∼6 times higher, 38.2 μA cm−2, when the wavelength of irradiation was decreased to 420 nm at −0.75 VSCE. The photocurrent dropped 21%, however, from 38.2 to 30.1 μA cm−2 after 200 s at 420 nm. While this drop is notable, it is less than the percentage drop at −0.35 VSCE. The initial turnover frequencies (TOF)71 at −0.75 VSCE were 274.1 h−1 at 420 nm, and 45.2 h−1 at 450 nm.

Fig. 6 shows the IPCE and the photoelectrochemical activities of the TiO2-[(phen)Ru(II)(polypyridyl)2]2+ photoanodes under neutral conditions with dihydroquinone (H2Q) as the sacrificial electron donor at E = 0 VSCE under 450 nm illumination (0.1 M NaClO4, 0.02 M H2Q, pH = 7.0). The data we reported previously for the TiO2-RuPhen photoanode is included for comparison.46 As shown in Fig. 6A, the IPCE values were in general higher under these conditions than with Et3N as electron donor under basic conditions. TiO2-RuMePhen was significantly more active than the others at shorter wavelengths (410 to ∼440 nm), with the IPCE reaching values as high as 12.7% at 410 nm. The IPCE values are normalized to intensity for each wavelength. The TiO2-RuPhen photoanode was notably more active than the other chromophores at longer wavelengths (∼440 to 700 nm). The maximum IPCE (∼5.5%) occurred, however, at 410 nm. The maximum IPCE for the other photoanodes occurred at 410 nm and were significantly lower. The values were 1.3, 0.3, and 0.2% for TiO2-RuRu, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RutBuPhen, respectively. The IPCE of TiO2-RuRu exceeded that of TiO2-RuMePhen at wavelengths ≳480 nm. Increasing the H2Q concentration did not significantly improve the short-term photoelectrochemical activities of the electrodes.

(TiO2-RuPhen adapted with permission from ref. 42. Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.) 

Fig. 6B shows the potentiostatic photocurrent responses of the TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RuRu, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RutBuPhen (0.1 M NaClO4, 0.02 M H2Q, 450 nm, 0 VSCE, 200 s). Again, the TiO2-RuMePhen was the most active. The initial photocurrent reached 22.4 μA cm−2 (TOF 80.4 h−1) and then gradually decreased to 12 μA cm−2. The initial photocurrent generated by the TiO2-RuRu photoanode was 4.1 μA cm−2, and then increased to 6.3 μA cm−2 after 200 s. The activities of the TiO2-RuOPhen and TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanodes were low. As expected, irradiating the TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode 420 nm generated higher photocurrents (Fig. 5B). Specifically, the initial current was 42.5 μA cm−2 (TOF = 152.5 h−1) followed by a decline to 22 μA cm−2 after 200 s. Unlike in base, changing the potential (∼300 mV range) did not have an appreciable effect on either the performance or stability under these conditions.

Fig. 7 shows the IPCE and the photoelectrochemical activities of the TiO2-[(phen)Ru(II)(polypyridyl)2]2+ photoanodes under acidic conditions with H2Q as the sacrificial electron donor (E = 0.2 VSCE, 450 nm, 0.1 M HClO4, 0.02 M H2Q, pH = 1.0). As shown in Fig. 7A, the IPCE activity of the TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode was lower in acid than under basic or neutral conditions. The highest IPCE in acid was 4.2%, generated at 410 nm. The TiO2-RuRu, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanodes were more active in acid. Indeed, the TiO2-RuRu photoanode was the most active at wavelengths >450 nm, and its activity extended the furthest into the long wavelength region. The activity of the TiO2-RuOPhen photoanode also extended into longer wavelengths, but it was less active than TiO2-RuRu. The TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanode generated the lowest IPCE values over all wavelengths.
 Fig. 7  (A) The IPCE measurements and (B) photoelectrochemical responses of the TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RutBuPhen, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RuRu electrodes in 0.1 M HClO4 containing 0.02 M H2Q (pH = 1.0) at constant potential of 0.2 V and illumination of 450 nm, under Ar atmosphere. 

Fig. 7B shows the potentiostatic photocurrent responses of the TiO2-RuMePhen, TiO2-RuRu, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanodes in acid (0.1 M HClO4, 0.02 M H2Q, 450 nm, 0.2 VSCE). The photocurrent generated by the TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode initially reached 7.8 μA cm−2 (TOF = 28 h−1) followed by quick drop to 5.1 μA cm−2 over ∼180 s (light off). The photoactivities of the TiO2-RuRu, TiO2-RuOPhen, and TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanodes were relatively stable in acid. Fig. 6B shows their activities extended out to ∼200 s. The TiO2-RuRu photocurrent was higher under acid than it was under neutral or basic conditions. In fact, it was the highest among the photoanodes tested in acid, generating a quite stable value 8.4 μA cm−2 (TOF = 31.4 h−1). The TiO2-RuOPhen photoanode generated a stable value of 5.4 μA cm−2 (TOF = 19.8 h−1), and it was more active than TiO2-RuMePhen after ∼130 seconds. The TiO2-RutBuPhen initially generated ∼1.7 μA cm−2 (6.1 h−1 TOF). Unlike in base, changing the potential (∼300 mV range) did not have a noticeable effect on either the performance or stability under these conditions.
It is difficult to establish the precise origins of the differences in IPCEs and potentiostatic photocurrents with changes in pH, chromophore structure, and sacrificial electron donors. Factors that may influence the photoactivity include variations in the Fermi level of TiO2 with pH;72 differences in rates, mechanisms, and overpotentials for the electrooxidations of Et3N and H2Q;60 differences in the rates of electron injection and back transfer;73,74 in reorganization energies, orbital coupling, excited state energies and lifetimes;75 chemical stability, and other factors.
The TiO2-RutBuPhen photoanode was the least active in this study. We propose that the steric bulk of the four tBu groups inhibit the photoactivity, perhaps by either blocking the electron transfer from Et3N or H2Q to the oxidized chromophore, or by increasing the reorganization energy for electron injection. As expected, conjugation extended the activity to longer wavelengths for TiO2-RuRu and TiO2-RuOPhen. For unexplained reasons, however, these expectations did not manifest themselves as appreciably higher activity except for under acidic conditions, where these photoanodes were more stable and active at longer wavelengths. The use of unconjugated linkers may be of benefit to these systems.76
The TiO2-RuMePhen photoanode was the most active at lower wavelengths, reaching a maximum IPCE of 12.7% under neutral conditions at 410 nm. This higher activity at lower wavelengths is somewhat consistent with the UV-vis data, where the maximum MLCT absorption occurred at the shortest wavelength for RuMePhen. Changing the applied potential had more effect on the photoactivities and stabilities in base than it did under neutral or acidic conditions.
Conclusions
We demonstrated an adaptable, step-wise, solid-phase type synthesis of several semiconductor–chromophore assemblies. The prepared chromophores were attached to the semiconductor by a direct covalent bond to C5 of a phen ligand, presumably to an oxygen atom in the semiconductor. This attachment has appreciable stability in base, providing a means to study to base-stable, abundant metal catalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction. The chromophores were well-characterized, and they largely are situated at electrochemically accessible sites on the semiconductor. In general, more electron donating ligands (i.e. methyl and tert-butyl) to Ru decreased the redox potential of the chromophores relative to the unsubstituted bipy parent complex, while replacing a bipy with phendione ligand caused it to shift to higher values. Even though the molar extinction coefficient of dimeric Ru was ∼2× that of other chromophores, it did not improve the photoactivity as expected, indicating other factors are at play. An interesting future direction would be to systematically vary the structure of the ligands within the dimer and investigate the effect on hole transfer between the Ru centres and the overall photoactivity of the bonded chromophore. Detailed photophysical studies are required to determine the origins of the differences in photoactivity between these systems. As well, this solid-phase synthesis can, in principle, be used to prepare high molecular weight chromophores with multiple, mixed metal centers in a controlled, step-wise manner while avoiding difficulties arising from insolubility. Such studies are underway in these laboratories.
