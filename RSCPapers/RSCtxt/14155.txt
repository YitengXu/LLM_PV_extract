Structural analysis showed that both ZnO had a highly preferred orientation along the 〈0001〉 direction with a highly crystalline MgF2 shell coated uniformly. However, a small amount of Al was present in nanosheets, originating from Al diffusion from the Al seed layer, resulting in an increase of the optical bandgap. Compared with the nanosheet-based antireflection coatings, the nanowire-based ones exhibited a significantly lower reflectance (∼2%) in ultraviolet and visible light wavelength regions. In particular, they showed perfect light absorption at wavelength less than approximately 400 nm. However, a GaAs single junction solar cell with nanosheet-based antireflection coatings showed the largest enhancement (43.9%) in power conversion efficiency. These results show that the increase of the optical bandgap of the nanosheets by the incorporation of Al atoms allows more photons enter the active region of the solar cell, improving the performance.
Introduction
Antireflective (AR) coatings based on the ZnO nanostructures have received increasing interest during the past few decades and may be considered as one of the promising candidates due to the excellent optical properties and the controllable anisotropic growth of ZnO.1–3 In particular, ZnO can easily be synthesized as various forms of nanostructures such as nanowires, nanobelts, nanoplatelets, and nanorods using well-developed methods, demonstrated by many research groups.4–8 However, as promising candidates, most work has focused on the nanowire-based AR coatings. The graded refractive index to the active region of the solar cell, which is essential in obtaining low reflectance, can be achieved by a gradual decrease in the diameter of the nanowires to the bottom from the top.9–13 Various experimental parameters such as substrates, growth time, temperature, amounts of precursors and additives should be considered for the fine control of the nanowire diameter. However, the morphology was found to be quite sensitive to these parameters. Recently, it was reported that the coaxial-type surface by coating low refractive index materials on the nanowires could decrease the reflectance, significantly at a low angle of incident light, thereby, enhancing the solar cell performance over broadband and wide angle ranges.14,15 The enhancement of the performance of solar cells with the ZnO nanowire-based AR coatings may not be huge, although the AR coatings show quite low reflectance comparable to those of the conventional multi-layered antireflective films.16–20
Here, a series of hierarchical ZnO nanostructure-based AR coatings was synthesized and the reflection over a broadband range was simultaneously examined. The GaAs solar cells with the AR coatings were then fabricated and the AR characteristics were compared with the performance of the solar cell. As the nanostructures, the ZnO nanowires and nanosheets were prepared hydrothermally on a high-refractive index layer (ZnS and TiO2), followed by the RF sputtering of MgF2 layers for coaxial nanostructures. For the nanosheet growth, a very thin aluminium layer less than 1 nm was deposited on the ZnS layer by using an e-beam evaporator. The nanosheet-based AR coatings exhibited large reflection in the range of 300–800 nm, >5% at a shorter wavelength than 450 nm, while ZnO nanowire-based coatings showed ∼2% in the entire region. However, the GaAs single-junction solar cells with nanosheet-based AR coatings showed the largest enhancement of 43.9%, compared with a pristine solar cell. It is believed that the results are explained by the increase of the optical bandgap of the ZnO nanosheets by the incorporation of aluminium atoms, increasing the optical transmittance.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic image of GaAs solar cells with three representative nanostructured antireflective surfaces; MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/TiO2, MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/ZnS, and MgF2/ZnO nanosheets/Al/ZnS. The corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are shown in Fig. 1b–d. The ZnO nanowires are approximately 3.0 μm in length and 65 nm in diameter, respectively. The ZnO nanosheets are seen in 25 nm in thickness, about 3 times smaller than the nanowires, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The thickness of the nanosheet increases as the thickness of the Al layer increases. On the Al layer of less than 0.5 nm, nanowires were also observed, meaning that the Al layer was not formed uniformly. For elemental analysis, the nanosheets were transferred onto a foreign substrate and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was performed. This analysis showed that the nanosheet was composed of zinc, oxygen, and aluminium (Fig. S2c, ESI†), while Zn and O were the only components in the nanowire. Al was also observed in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The peak in the Al 2p spectra corresponds to Al–O and Al–Zn–O bonds. The Al–O binding energy was observed at 73.5 eV, lower than that (∼75.6 eV) of the pure Al2O3. By RF magnetron sputtering, the MgF2 film was deposited on the ZnO nanowires and nanosheets. After MgF2 film deposition, the diameter increased to approximately 100 nm and 60 nm, respectively, indicating that the thickness of the MgF2 film is about 17 nm in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

The scale bars in the SEM images are 1 μm except the right image of (d), which is 250 nm. The insets also show the enlarged images (scale bar 50 nm). 
The crystal structures at and near interface of MgF2 and ZnO layers were characterized by low- and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images. Fig. 2a and b show TEM images of MgF2-coated ZnO nanowires with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Thin MgF2 shells are clearly visible and they appear to be quite uniform along the body of the nanowire. The corresponding atomic spots and the diffraction patterns reveal that the layers are highly crystalline. FFT patterns taken along the [20] zone axis, together with measured lattice spacing of the adjacent planes, confirm that the nanowire grew along the c-axis. For the nanosheets, it is also clearly seen that ZnO was preferentially grown in the same direction. According to the mechanism suggested previously,21,22 prior to growth, Al is oxidized to Al2O3, forming the AlO2− ions in the solution. The AlO2− ions at the surface react with the Zn2+ ions, producing ZnAl2O4 at the nanolevel, promoting the growth along the direction by decreasing the growth rate of different facets in ZnO.

In Fig S2 (ESI†), a small amount of Al is present in nanosheets, meaning that Al from the ultrathin Al layer was diffused and incorporated into ZnO during growth. Al doping by diffusion was already reported and has been commonly observed when the layers were annealed at high temperature (>800 °C).23 It is unlikely that Al easily diffuses into ZnO because the growth temperature is not so high (∼90 °C). However, it can be expected that the Al atoms can move via a defect-mediated mechanism (the vacancy-mediated diffusion) into and inside ZnO. The AlO2− ions in the solution may also play a role as a source for the incorporation of Al into ZnO. Actually, the TEM results show that Al doping increases the spacing between two adjacent planes along the c-axis by approximately 10%, as shown in Fig. 2b and d. Furthermore, the defects commonly observed at the interface between ZnO and the seed layer will promote the nucleation of ZnAl2O4 at the surface for nanosheet growth. The incorporation of the Al atoms into the ZnO nanosheet was also reported in a hydrothermal process when Al substrates were used.24
To investigate the AR characteristics of the nanostructured surfaces based on nanowires and nanosheets over a broad range of wavelengths, we observed the total reflection over a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. The incident angle with respect to the parallel of the sample was 83° in this measurement. After MgF2 was deposited on ZnO nanowires grown on TiO2 layers, the reflectance was found to be less than 2% in the UV and visible range. This ascribes to the decrease in the effective refractive index from the bottom to the top of the nanowires and the low refractive index (∼1.38) of MgF2, well-known previously.25 The TiO2 layer was also reported to be effective in decreasing the reflectance, thereby, enhancing the solar cell performance. As TiO2 is replaced by ZnS, the reflectance increases, but it is still found to be less than 3% in the range.

The reflection in multi-layered AR coatings may be quite complicated due to the multiple reflections and interference effects occurring at the interface of the layers. Furthermore, for the nanowire-type AR coatings, it is difficult to explain the reflection because of the complicated nanowire morphologies. If the optical transmission of the ZnO/TiO2 layered structure takes into account the multiple reflections and is compared with the ZnO/ZnS layered structure, the reflection can be calculated by eqn (1),26–28 (1)where, r1, r2, and r3 are the amplitude reflection coefficients. θ is the incident angle of light and t is the thickness. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)n0, n1, n2 and n3 are the refractive indices of the air, ZnO, TiO2 (or ZnS) and the substrate. It is clearly observed that the nanostructures with a 50 nm thick TiO2 layer show lower reflectance than those with a ZnS layer in the entire region except the near UV region, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). As the thickness of the layer increases, the reflectance decreases, indicating that the reflection can be lowered by optimizing the thickness of each layer.
Note that the reflectance of both MgF2/ZnO nanowire antireflection coatings is almost the same in the near UV region (at the wavelength less than 400 nm), less than 1–2%. This may ascribe to the low bandgap (3.37 eV) of ZnO.29 This implies that the ZnO nanowires or films absorb the photons in UV light having wavelength less than 370 nm, preventing light to enter the active region of the solar cell. TiO2 also has a small bandgap of 2.85 eV, indicating that the layer absorbs the light at the wavelengths shorter than 430 nm and lower the reflectance, compared with the MgF2/ZnO/ZnS sample.30 However, for the MgF2 deposited ZnO nanosheets on Al/ZnS, it shows high reflectance (10–15%) in the near UV region, meaning that some of the light can pass to the active region of the solar cell. It is also clearly seen that the reflectance is around 5% or less over a wavelength range from 500 to 800 nm.

Fig. 3b shows the total absorption of the nanostructured surfaces over a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm using UV-vis-IR absorbance spectroscopy. For the MgF2/ZnO nanowires on TiO2 layers, it shows a high absorption close to 100% in the UV region less than 400 nm. As TiO2 is replaced by ZnS, absorption is decreased to 92% at 400 nm. For the ZnO nanosheets, it significantly decreases to 10% at 400 nm. Absorbance was transformed by the following equation for the near-edge absorption known as the Kubelka–Munk method, (αhν)n = K(hν – Eg)(7)where, K is a constant relative to the material, α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy, and n is 2 for a direct band gap semiconductor. The calculation shows that the MgF2/ZnO nanowires on TiO2 layers start to absorb below about 2.8 eV, which is equal to the optical bandgap of TiO2. The absorption edge increases to 3.2 eV as TiO2 is replaced by ZnS, which is equal to the bandgap of ZnO. For the ZnO nanosheets, it is found that the absorption band edge significantly increases to 3.4 eV. This means that the bandgap of ZnO increases in the form of the nanosheets.
The blue-shift of the absorption edge in the nanosheets may be explained by the quantum confinement effect and the incorporation of Al atoms into ZnO. It was reported that various materials synthesized in the form of nanosheets showed an obvious blue shift in ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) adsorption spectra due to the quantum confinement effect at an extremely small scale. Using a simple square quantum well potential of infinite height,31 the band-to-band edge direct transition energy is proportional to 1/L2. Here, L is the thickness of the nanosheet. As L decreases, the transition energy increases. However, the critical size for a significant quantum confinement effect should be less than 10 nm, which may be much smaller than that of the ZnO nanosheets. The incorporation of Al atoms into ZnO may be the reason for the blue-shift in the spectra. For the structures that are doped, the Al atoms are more favourable in the Zn sites than in the O sites, leading the ZnO nanosheet to an n type semiconductor.32 According to the Burstein–Moss effect, the electrons occupy states within the conduction band, which pushes the Fermi level higher in energy, hence, the valence electrons require more energy to be excited to higher energy states in the conduction band. Therefore, the optical band gap of the nanosheets becomes larger than that of nanowires, thereby, increasing the optical transmittance, consistent with the results in Fig. 3c.
To further verify the effect of the MgF2 layer on the reflectance, we performed simulations for the reflectance of the nanosheet-based structure with and without MgF2 coating layers using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. To mimic the structures shown in SEM images, we modelled a 150 nm-height ZnO waveform nanostructure on the multilayer of Al (1 nm)/ZnS (50 nm)/Si (semi-infinite). The average thickness of the nanosheets and the MgF2 layer are assumed to be 20 nm and 20 nm, respectively. It was also assumed that the MgF2 layer was coated uniformly on the nanosheets. For a large area, we used periodic boundary condition for x and y directions, where the randomly oriented 5 × 5 array of ZnO nanosheets (see the inset of Fig. 3d) was adopted as the unit cell. The refractive index in the range of 450 and 1000 nm for each material was obtained from data obtained by experimental measurements.33–36 The reflectance spectrum in Fig. 3d reveals that the reflectance in the entire region of wavelength decreases by the coating of the MgF2 layer. Moreover, the high reflectance (>10%) was found at short wavelengths, consistent with the experimental results in Fig. 3a.
The nanostructured AR surfaces based on nanowires and nanosheets were produced on the GaAs solar cells and the current-density versus voltage (J–V) curves are measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2, 1 Sun) at room temperature. Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics of solar cells integrated without and with the AR surfaces. For the solar cells without the AR surfaces, it shows an efficiency of approximately 14%. After the MgF2/ZnO nanowires on TiO2 layers are produced, there is no significant change in the efficiency. As TiO2 is replaced by ZnS, the efficiency is increased to 18.5% without the change in Voc. These results show that many photons of the light are already absorbed in TiO2 layers before entering the active region of the solar cell. After the ZnO nanosheets are grown, a further increase to 19.8% (43.9% enhancement) in power conversion efficiency was observed despite the fact that the reflectance of this AR coating is 2–3 times larger than those of the nanowire-based AR coatings. This implies that the increase in the bandgap with the growth of the ZnO nanosheets with a small thickness less than 20 nm significantly contributes to the enhancement of the solar cell performance. The spectral responses of external quantum efficiency (EQE) and surface reflectance were also measured to further analyse the antireflection capability of the AR surfaces in GaAs solar cells, plotted in Fig. 4b. When the ZnO nanosheets were used, the GaAs solar cell exhibited a broad-range EQE enhancement from 400 to 900 nm and there was a 30% enhancement in the EQE. Also note that the EQE is nearly zero in the solar cell with nanowire-based AR coatings at the wavelengths less than 400 nm, meaning that the light absorption is mainly due to ZnO and TiO2, in which the AR coatings do not contribute to the solar cell performance. Integrating the EQE over a standard AM 1.5G illumination spectrum yields a short-circuit current density (Jsc) for the solar cell with ZnO nanosheets of 24.54 mA cm−2, quite similar to the value in Fig. 4a and Table 1.

Experimental
Fabrication of ZnO nanowires and nanosheets
High-aspect-ratio ZnO based double-nanotextured surfaces with core–shell morphologies were prepared via a hydrothermal method of ZnO nanowires and nanosheets, followed by means of RF sputtering for MgF2 thin film deposition. For reflectance measurements of the antireflective surfaces, the nanowires were grown on ZnO/TiO2 (100 nm/50 nm) and ZnO/ZnS (100 nm/50 nm) layers in a mixed solution of 0.020 M zinc nitrate hydrate and 0.020 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) in DI water for 9 h. The TiO2 and ZnS were deposited by reactive sputtering using 80 W of RF power, 16 sccm of Ar and 4 sccm of O2 at an operating pressure of 2 mTorr, and 50 W of RF power, 20 sccm of Ar at an operating pressure of 5 mTorr, respectively. The deposition condition was optimized to enhance good crystallinity. ZnO, which acts effectively as a seed layer for growing ZnO nanowires, was then deposited by reactive sputtering using 100 W of RF power to the 2 in. ZnO target, 16 sccm of Ar and 4 sccm of O2 at an operating pressure of 4 mTorr. For the growth of ZnO nanosheets, a very thin layer of aluminium (0.5 to 3 nm) was deposited on the ZnS layer, followed by the growth of the ZnO nanosheets under the same growth condition. MgF2/ZnO was fabricated using 80 W of RF power to the 2 inch MgF2 target, 15 sccm of Ar at an operating pressure of 25 mTorr.
Fabrication of a GaAs single junction solar cell
A GaAs single junction solar cell structure was grown on a GaAs substrate by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, in which AsH3, PH3, trimethylgallium (TMGa), and trimethylindium (TMIn) were used as precursors. SiH4 and dimethylzinc (DMZn) were also employed as n-type and p-type dopants, respectively. The structure consists of 0.5 μm thick Si-doped GaAs, 0.05 μm thick Si-doped, 3 × 1018 cm−3, Ga0.5In0.5P, 3.5 μm thick Si-doped GaAs, 0.5 μm thick Zn-doped, 1 × 1018 cm−3, GaAs, 0.03 μm thick Zn-doped Ga0.5In0.5P, and 0.3 μm thick Zn-doped GaAs. For the fabrication of solar cells, n-type Ni/Au/Ge/Ni/Au (20/100/30/30/200 nm) Ohmic contact was deposited on the n+ GaAs layer, followed by the mesa etching in the H3PO4 and HCl-based solutions for GaAs and InGaP etching, respectively. The p-type Pt/Ti/Pt/Au (20/30/20/200 nm) Ohmic contact was deposited on the bottom p+GaAs layer. Rapid thermal annealing was then carried out at 400 °C for 40 s to reduce contact resistance and the n+GaAs contact layer on the window was etched for efficient light absorption. The antireflective surfaces based on ZnO nanowires and nanosheets are produced on the top surface of the solar cells.
Characterization
The morphologies of the ZnO nanostructured films was investigated using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Elemental analysis was carried out in the SEM using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). The high-resolution TEM images were collected using a Cs-corrected JEM-2100 operated at 200 kV. A UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750), equipped with an integrating sphere, was employed to measure the spectral reflectance of the antireflective coatings at wavelengths ranging between 300 and 1000 nm. The reflected light was collected into the angular acceptance range characterized by the minimum and maximum acceptance angles. In order to verify the effect of MgF2 on reflectance of the ZnO nanosheets, FDTD solutions software with a RF module was employed for two-dimensional finite element frequency domain simulations. XPS was employed to identify the quantitative chemical characterization and chemical bonding states of solid surfaces. The J–V curves of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with McScience XES-301S. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra measured using a K3100 Spectral IPCE Measurement System consisting of a 400 W Xe lamp as a light source.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of hierarchical ZnO nanostructure-based AR coatings was prepared by a hydrothermal method of ZnO nanostructures, followed by means of RF sputtering for coaxial nanostructures. The two types of nanostructures (nanowires and nanosheets) were synthesized hydrothermally on high-refractive index layers by properly selecting the kind of seed layer; ZnO thin films for nanowires and Al thin films for nanosheets. The structural analysis showed that ZnO has a highly preferred orientation along the 〈0001〉 direction with a highly crystalline MgF2 shell uniformly coated. It was observed that the thickness of the nanosheets increased with the thickness of the Al layer. A small amount of Al was present in nanosheets, originating from Al diffusion from the Al seed layer, resulting in an increase in the optical bandgap. For nanosheet-based AR coatings, it showed quite high reflectance (10–15% in the near UV region and 5% in the visible region), while nanowire-based AR coatings showed a low reflectance of 2–3% in the entire region. Furthermore, nanowire-based AR coatings showed perfect absorption in the near UV region. However, contrary to the AR characteristics, the GaAs solar cell showed the largest enhancement (43.9%) from 13.77% to 19.81% in power conversion efficiency when the nanosheet-based AR coatings were used. These results show that the low reflection of the nanowire-based AR coatings is mainly due to the high light absorption of ZnO and TiO2, which prevents light to pass to the active region of the solar cell. The increase of the optical bandgap of the nanosheets due to the incorporation of Al atoms improves the optical transmittance, enhancing the solar cell performance.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The schematic images of a GaAs based solar cell with MgF2/ZnO nanosheets/Al/ZnS as the AR coatings. Schematic and SEM images of (b) MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/TiO2, (c) MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/ZnS, and (d) MgF2/ZnO nanosheets/Al/ZnS. The scale bars in the SEM images are 1 μm except the right image of (d), which is 250 nm. The insets also show the enlarged images (scale bar 50 nm).	 

 	Fig. 2  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of MgF2/ZnO nanowires and MgF2/ZnO nanosheet. (a) Low-magnification MgF2/ZnO nanowires (scale bar is 50 nm) and (b) high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of MgF2/ZnO nanowires (scale bar is 5 nm). (c) Low-magnification MgF2/ZnO nanosheet (scale bar is 0.2 μm) and (d) HR-TEM image of MgF2/ZnO nanosheet (scale bar is 5 nm). The inset shows a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the image.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra over a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm: MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/TiO2, MgF2/ZnO nanowires/ZnO/ZnS and MgF2/ZnO nanosheets/Al/ZnS. (b) UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra in the range from 300 to 800 nm. The absorption calculated by measuring the reflection (at a 7° angle of incidence) using A% = 100% − R% − T% while it is assumed that the scattering effect is negligible. (c) Corresponding plot of transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of the light. (d) Simulated spectra of the effect of the straight MgF2 shell on the reflectance. Wavelength-dependent simulated reflectance distribution at 90°.
