    , Accepted 17th February 2021First published on 18th February 2021AbstractIn promoting the application of green and sustainable solutions towards the photodegradation of organic dyes and toxic ions, it is urgent to fabricate semiconductor-based effective and stable photocatalysts. Constructing a heterojunction is the new way to accelerate the photoinduced charge separation to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity. In this article, a novel 3D/2D heterostructure has been fabricated by a simple two-step solvothermal process. First of all, 3D Bi2S3 urchins were synthesized and after that 2D SnS2 nanosheets were decorated on Bi2S3 urchins. The formation of Bi2S3 urchins was monitored at different reaction times and probed by scanning electron microscopy. Both theoretical calculations and experiments suggest that an epitaxial relationship was formed between the (211) plane of Bi2S3 and the (012) plane of SnS2. A type-II band alignment between Bi2S3 and SnS2 was established by theoretical investigation, which accelerated photoinduced charge separation and improved the photocatalytic activity of the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure. The surface area analysis of the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure with different SnS2 loading was monitored and the increased surface area and the porous structure make the heterostructures more active than that of the pure one. Therefore, this 3D/2D heterostructure is found to be important as a new generation photocatalytic system.
Introduction
With the ever-increasing demand of photocatalysis towards the environmentally harmful organic pollutants, semiconductor-based heterostructures offer most promising ways to resolve these environmental issues.1–3 The conversion of solar light into chemical energy for the degradation of pollutants is the best way to produce renewable energy. The photoconversion efficiency requires several factors to be met: (1) the high light absorption efficiency of materials, (2) efficient charge separation, and (3) the high surface area of photocatalysts. There are several proposed technologies for the sustainable development of photocatalysts such as the formation of different kinds of semiconductor-based heterostructures,4,5 band gap engineering,6,7 and carbon-based heterostructure formation.8 Among them, a promising approach is to form a semiconductor heterostructure as it provides increased light absorption efficiency, greater surface area, and effective charge separation. In particular, semiconductor-based heterostructures have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications including energy storage,9 photocatalysis,10 electrochemical applications,11 solar cells,12 and optoelectronic properties.13 Among the different kinds of band engineering in semiconductor heterostructures, a type-II band alignment provides a complete charge separation and longer life time of the photoexcited charge.14,15 Dimensionality plays a major role in efficient charge transportation and enhancing the physical/chemical properties of heterostructures. With respect to single one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), or three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor photocatalysts, it is a fruitful way to construct the 1D/2D, 2D/2D, or 3D/2D heterostructure as it can offer effective band alignment and efficient charge carrier separation.16–18 It is a great challenge to construct a 2D/2D or 3D/2D heterojunction with an appropriate choice of the semiconductor with preferable band edges for future photocatalytic systems.
For past few years, metal sulfides have been extensively studied for next generation photocatalysts due to their narrow band gap and a potential photoactive component in the heterostructure. Among them, lamellar-structured Bi2S3 is less toxic and more ecofriendly with a typical band gap value of 1.2–1.7 eV.19 In recent times, Bi2S3 with a variety of morphologies have been studied in the case of solar cells,20 photodetectors,21 photoelectrochemical activity,22 thermoelectric applications,23 hydrogen storage,24etc. Bi2S3 coupled with other metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal nanoparticles such as Bi2S3/TiO2,25 Bi2S3/WO3,26 Bi2S3/Pd4S,27 Bi2S3/CdS,28 and Bi2S3/Au (ref. 29) has been extensively studied as efficient heterostructures. Recently, 3-dimensional (3D) hierarchical heterostructures with Bi2S3 as the base material have been used due to their large specific area and high light absorption coefficient for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.
In a fast-growing industry, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials exhibit excellent optical, electronic, and physiochemical properties.30,31 Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be the most attractive class of candidates in the field of photocatalysis due to their good light absorption property as well as the presence of active sites for the catalytic reaction. Several metal sulfides such as WS2,32 MoS2,33 CdS,34 ZnS,35 and NiS2 (ref. 36) have been used in heterostructure formation to date. Tin disulfide (SnS2) has attracted much attention due to its interesting properties and potential applications. SnS2 is considered as an earth-abundant and low cost TMD and crystallizes in a layered CdI2 type structure, where each layer of Sn atoms is sandwiched between two layers of hexagonally-closed packed S atoms.37 In recent times, a few SnS2-based heterostructures have been studied for enhancing the photocatalytic performances, such as SnS2/TiO2,38 SnS2/SnO2,39 g-C3N4/SnS2,40 and SnS2/RGO.41 SnS2 has both thermal and oxidation stability. It is also stable in acidic as well as neutral media. Therefore, SnS2 can be a potential candidate for heterostructure formation for achieving improved photocatalytic activity.
In this present work, we have successfully synthesized 3D/2D Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures by a two-step solvothermal method for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. First of all, we synthesized Bi2S3 urchins by a simple solvothermal method. Next, 2D SnS2 nanosheets were decorated upon the Bi2S3 urchins. This unique hierarchical heterostructure offers high light absorption efficiency, larger surface area, and more catalytically active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, based on the calculated band positions, type-II band alignment is formed between Bi2S3 and SnS2, which is favorable for the complete separation of electrons and holes and increases the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers. The as-synthesized heterostructures have been used for the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) dyes under simulated solar light irradiation. They also exhibit the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under solar light irradiance. The photodetector fabricated using these materials shows ∼10 times greater photocurrent gain value than that of the pure one. Therefore, Bi2S3/SnS2 hierarchical heterostructures are the most promising ones for the photocatalytic degradation of environmentally-toxic pollutants.
Experimental section
Materials
Bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3, 5H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S), 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2), tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate, (98%, SnCl4, 5H2O), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), deionized water, toluene, rhodamine B (RhB) dye, methylene blue dye (MB), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), diphenylcarbazide, citric acid, terephthalic acid, and acetone were purchased from MERCK. All the reagents were analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification. DI water was used throughout all the experiments.
Synthesis

Preparation of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) microurchins. 
Bi2S3 microurchins were prepared by a simple solvothermal method. In a typical synthetic procedure, Bi(NO3)3, 5H2O (1 mM) was dissolved in 10 mL 2-methoxyethanol to form a homogeneous solution. Then, 30 mL 2-methoxyethanol solution containing 8 mM thiourea (CH4N2S) was added dropwise to the previous solution under vigorous stirring. After 30 min of vigorous stirring, the mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and then heated for 12 h in an electric oven at 120 °C. After the solvothermal synthesis, the resulting black colored Bi2S3 powder was washed with distilled water and ethanol. Finally, the Bi2S3 powder was collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min and dried at about 60 °C.


Preparation of Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures. 
The Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures were synthesized via the in situ growth method. At first, 15 mg of the as-prepared Bi2S3 microurchins were dispersed in 10 mL 2-methoxyethanol and stirred for 5 min to make a homogeneous dispersion. Then, 10 mL 2-methoxyethanol containing SnCl4·5H2O and 0.5 mM thioacetamide (where the concentration of SnCl4·5H2O was 0.1 mM, 0.15 mM, and 0.2 mM for different heterostructures) were added to the previous solution. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, the mixed solution was transferred to a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated in an electric oven at 160 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitates of Bi2S3/SnS2 with different molar ratios were collected, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and then dried at about 80 °C for 4 h. Three different Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures, namely, BSS1, BSS1.5, and BSS2 were synthesized where the molar ratios of Bi2S3:SnS2 were 1:0.1, 1:0.15, and 1:0.2, respectively.


Preparation of the SnS2 nanosheets. 
For the synthesis of SnS2 nanosheets, 0.1 mM SnCl4·5H2O and 0.5 mmol thioacetamide were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water under vigorous magnetic stirring. The as-obtained transparent solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated for 12 h in an electric oven at 160 °C. After the completion of hydrothermal synthesis, the resulting yellow-colored SnS2 powder was washed with ethanol and deionized water. After that, SnS2 powder was collected by high-speed centrifugation and dried at about 50 °C for 4 h.


Characterization. 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) studies were performed by using a Bruker AXS D8SWAX diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scanning rate of 0.5° S−1 in the 2θ range of 10–80°. A concentrated ethanol solution of the samples was drop-cast over a glass substrate till a thin layer visible to the naked eye was formed for the XRD measurement. The morphology of the samples was studied by a transmission electron microscope (UHR-FEG TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) operated at 200 kV. The samples were dissolved in ethanol and were drop-cast on a carbon-coated copper grid for the TEM observation. The room temperature optical absorbance of the samples was recorded by a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a commercial fluorimeter with 400 nm excitation using a xenon lamp (FluoroMax-4, HORIBA Scientific). Photodetector measurements (I–V measurement and the temporal response of the photocurrent) were carried out using an assembled setup consisting of a microprobe station (Ecopia, Korea), a 405 nm diode laser, a source meter (Keithley 2400, Germany), a pulse generator (Agilent), and a digital oscilloscope (Agilent). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1C surface area analyzer at 77 K.


Photocatalytic degradation test of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue dyes (MB). 
RhB and MB were used as the model dyes for the photocatalytic degradation for the evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized samples. The photocatalytic degradation tests were studied under a solar simulator (KRATOS, Analytical Instruments, universal arc lamp supply: 250 Watt, 150XE, model no. 1152). For the photocatalytic degradation of the dyes, 10 mg of the sample was first dispersed in 3 mL toluene. In another vial, 10 mL 0.0008 mM aqueous solution of the dye was prepared. After that, the solution containing catalyst was poured into the aqueous solution of the dye. The aqueous solution was collected from the biphasic mixture at a regular interval of time and then centrifuged. The absorbance measurement of the as-collected samples was conducted using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.


Detection of Cr(VI). 
In a typical experiment, 5 mL 10 ppm solution of chromium (Cr(VI)) was prepared by dissolving K2Cr2O7 salt in DI water. Next, 0.39 mM citric acid was added to the Cr(VI) solution, followed by maintaining a constant pH of 2 using 1 M HCl solution. A violet color was developed in the Cr(VI) solution via the addition of a 19.77 mM diphenylcarbazide solution in acetone. After the color change, 2 mg catalyst was added to the solution and the resulting mixture was ultrasonicated for 4 min, followed by incubation in the dark for 30 min under stirring to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then, the reaction mixture was irradiated with the light source previously mentioned. The reaction mixture was discarded at various intervals of time and centrifuged. The concentration of Cr(VI) was measured with a spectrophotometer at λ = 540 nm (Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer) using the diphenylcarbazide method.


Device fabrication. 
First of all, Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication using acetone, isopropanol, and water sequentially for 10 min each, followed by drying/heating at 100 °C for 1 h on a hot plate. To avoid the degradation of the material while depositing the electrodes, the Al electrodes were first deposited on the wafers using a shadow mask by the thermal evaporation method. Then, the sample solution was drop-cast between the gap of the two electrodes and dried at 60 °C.


Computational details. 
In this work, all the calculations are done within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with projector augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).42 The exchange-correlation energy is described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method parametrized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.43 The empirical correction method proposed by Grimme (DFT-D2) was utilized to account for the van der Waals interactions.44 The kinetic energy cut-off was set to 600 eV for Bi2S3 and 500 eV for SnS2. All the structures were fully relaxed using the conjugant gradient method; the convergence criteria were set to 10−4 eV for energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 for force. The Brillouin zone was sampled with the 8 × 4 × 4 and 12 × 12 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack k-points grid for bulk Bi2S3 and SnS2 respectively.45 For the slab calculation, the k-point grids for Bi2S3 and SnS2 were 4 × 8 × 8 and 12 × 4 × 4, respectively.

Results and discussion
Structural and morphological analysis
The crystal phases and the purity of the as-prepared Bi2S3 microurchins, SnS2 nanosheets, and their heterostructures (BSS1, BSS1.5, BSS2) were characterized by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 1 the X-ray diffraction patterns of A and C shown in Fig. 1 revealed the presence of the standard orthorhombic phases of Bi2S3 (JCPDS card no.17-0320) (Fig. 1A) and the hexagonal berndtite SnS2 (Fig. 1E) (JCPDS No. 23-0677), respectively. The XRD patterns of the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 1B–D, which display both the characteristic peaks of Bi2S3 and SnS2 (the diffraction peaks are highlighted with different symbols), indicating the existence of both Bi2S3 and SnS2 in the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures. With the increase in the SnS2 contents in the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of SnS2 were boosted gradually, while the peaks of Bi2S3 were simultaneously diminished.

The morphology of the Bi2S3 microurchins was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2A shows the as-synthesized Bi2S3 microurchins with an average size of 1–5 μm. The inset in Fig. 2A shows the closer view of the microurchins, which consists of a large number of nanorods radiating from the center and stacked together uniformly. Fig. 2B–D show the SEM images of Bi2S3/SnS2 (BSS1, BSS1.5, BSS2) heterostructures. The radial distribution of the nanorods in the Bi2S3 microurchins provide a perfect framework for the decoration of SnS2 nanosheets. Fig. 2B shows the BSS1 (molar ratio of Bi2S3:SnS2 = 0.01) heterostructures. The inset shows the closer view of the microurchins, where the Bi2S3 microurchins were decorated with SnS2 nanosheets uniformly. Fig. 2C provides the SEM image of the BSS1.5 (molar ratio of Bi2S3:SnS2 = 0.015) heterostructure, where the amount of SnS2 increases from the previous one and the inset shows a closer view of the heterostructure. The SEM image of the BSS2 (molar ratio of Bi2S3:SnS2 = 0.02) heterostructure is shown in Fig. 2D and a closer view of the heterostructure shows that the microurchins are fully covered with the SnS2 nanosheets. The average size of the microurchins decorated with SnS2 nanosheets remains in between 1 and 2 μm.

TEM analysis
A series of TEM and HRTEM images of the samples was studied to reveal more specific microstructural information. Fig. 3A shows the TEM image of the two Bi2S3 microurchins. The closer view of the microurchin shows that it is composed of closely packed nanorods (Fig. 3B). The average size of the Bi2S3 microurchins lies in between 0.7 and 1.6 μm. The HRTEM image of a single nanorod is shown in Fig. 3C and the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) pattern obtained from the yellow box in Fig. 3C is shown in Fig. 3D. The (103), (011), and (211) planes of pure Bi2S3 are identified from the FFT pattern. The d spacing corresponding to the above planes are 0.36 nm, 0.38 nm, and 0.32 nm, respectively. Fig. 4A shows the TEM image of the BSS1 heterostructure with an average size of 0.8–1.5 μm and Fig. 4B shows a closer view of the two nanorods decorated uniformly with SnS2 nanosheets. The HRTEM image of the heterostructure is shown in Fig. 4C. The FFT pattern obtained from the orange-colored box in Fig. 4C depicts planes of both Bi2S3 and SnS2 (Fig. 4D). A clear difference between Bi2S3 and SnS2 in the HRTEM image is due to the low thickness of the SnS2 nanosheets. The FFT pattern shows planes of both Bi2S3 and SnS2. The (011) and (210) planes correspond to Bi2S3 and the planes (012) and (011) correspond to SnS2. The d value obtained for the planes of Bi2S3 is 0.38 nm and 0.34 nm, respectively, and that for SnS2 is 0.22 nm and 0.58 nm, respectively. Fig. 5A shows the large area TEM image of the BSS1.5 heterostructures and a closer view of the single heterostructure is depicted in Fig. 5B where the Bi2S3 microurchin is well-decorated with SnS2 nanosheets. The size of the BSS1.5 heterostructure remains between 0.9 and 1.2 μm. The HRTEM of a single nanorod is shown in Fig. 5C where the SnS2 nanosheets are eptaxially attached to the Bi2S3 nanorod. The FFT pattern (Fig. 5D) obtained from the yellow-square box in Fig. 5C, which displays both the planes of Bi2S3 and SnS2. The FFT pattern reveals that the d spacing of 0.38 nm corresponds to the (011) plane and 0.31 nm corresponds to the (211) plane of Bi2S3, while 0.31 nm corresponds to the (100) plane and 0.22 nm corresponds to the (012) plane of SnS2, which implying the formation of the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure. Fig. 5E shows the reconstructed HRTEM image by masking the (211) plane of Bi2S3 and the (012) plane of SnS2. Although there is a large lattice mismatch between the (211) plane of Bi2S3 and the (012) plane of SnS2, there exists a periodic arrangement between the planes. The epitaxial relationship between the two planes is 2 × d(211) (= 0.62 nm) of Bi2S3 matches exactly with 3 × d(012) (= 0.66 nm) of SnS2. This epitaxial relationship establishes the heterostructure formation between Bi2S3 and SnS2. From DFT calculations also, it is seen that the 6 × 1 surface of SnS2 (012) matches with that of the 1 × 1 surface of Bi2S3 (211). There is only 2.20% lattice mismatch in the x-direction, whereas there is 19.5% lattice mismatch in the y-direction. The (012) surface of SnS2 and the (211) surface of Bi2S3 are shown in Fig. 5F. Fig. S1A† shows the large area TEM image of the BSS2 heterostructure with the average size distribution between 0.5 and 2 μm, while Fig. S1B† shows the closer view of the heterostructure. Fig. S1C† shows the HRTEM image of a single Bi2S3 nanorod fully covered with SnS2. The FFT pattern obtained from the yellow-square box in Fig. S1C† is shown in Fig. S1D.† The d spacing of 0.20 nm corresponds to the (020) plane and 0.23 nm corresponds to the (410) plane of Bi2S3, and the d spacing of 0.27 nm corresponds to the (011) plane and 0.31 nm corresponds to the (100) plane of SnS2. All these TEM analyses suggest that the SnS2 nanosheets are grown over the Bi2S3 microurchins. Finally, Fig. S2A† shows the TEM image of the SnS2 nanosheets. A few SnS2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. S2B† with an average crystallite size of 70 ± 20 nm and the HRTEM image of a single nanosheet is shown in Fig. S2C.† The FFT pattern obtained from the blue-square region in Fig. S2D† shows the (100), (20), and (20) planes of SnS2. The d spacing corresponding to the planes is 0.31 nm, 0.18 nm, and 0.18 nm, respectively. The above structural and microstructural investigation confirms the formation of the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures.

To further accurately investigate the nanoscale elemental composition as well as the spatial uniformity of the elemental distribution, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was carried out on different Bi2S3/SnS2 hierarchical heterostructures (BSS1.5 and BSS2). The EDS mapping images indicate the coexistence and homogeneous distribution of the S, Bi, and Sn elements among the BSS1.5 and BSS2 heterostructures, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† Moreover, the Sn element surface content increases from 6.57% to 18.62% as the Bi:Sn ratio increases in the two heterostructures. The element mapping images also suggest the formation of Bi2S3/SnS2.
Growth analysis
To further investigate the formation of the microurchin such as Bi2S3, the samples were prepared at different reaction times and the as-collected samples were investigated by SEM. The formation process at different reaction times is shown in Fig. 6A–D. As shown in Fig. 6A, at a reaction time of 30 min, small nanoparticle-like structures were formed. When the reaction time was prolonged to 4 h (Fig. 6B), some microsphere-like structures are formed with some self-assembled short rod-like structures and as the reaction time increased to 8 h (Fig. 6C), the size of the urchins increased and finally after 12 h (Fig. 6D) of reaction, the complete microurchins were formed. In this synthetic procedure, thiourea was used as a sulfur source as it can coordinate with the metal ions to form a metal-thiourea complex. The formation of this metal-thiourea complexes reduces the free metal ions and sulfur ions and the oriented growth becomes favourable in this case. In our experiment, the Bi3+-thiourea complexes were formed initially and then, at an elevated temperature, during the solvothermal process, the complex decomposes to Bi2S3 urchins.46 The solvent 2-methoxyethanol provides a perfect viscous medium that promotes the unique self-assembled urchin-like structure. As a result of the urchin-like structure, the self-assembled rods provide greater active sites for the epitaxial growth of the SnS2 nanosheets and hence the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures are formed.

Optical property study
To study the optical absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples, UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry was employed in the range of 250–800 nm, which has been shown in Fig. 7A. A strong absorption peak at about 700 nm was observed in case of pure Bi2S3 urchins. The UV-vis spectra of the as-synthesized pure SnS2 sheets show a peak at about 400 nm, which covers the UV as well as the visible range. The Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures show strong photoabsorption from the UV to visible-light region with an absorption edge of about 400 nm, which is similar to that of SnS2. The band gap of the as-synthesized samples was calculated (Fig. 7B–F) using the following equation47 (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(1)where α, h, ν, and Eg are defined as the optical absorption coefficient, Planck constant, photon frequency, and band gap of the semiconductor, respectively, and A and n are the constants. Depending on the nature of the semiconductor, the value of ‘n’ is 2 for a direct band gap semiconductor and 1/2 for an indirect band gap semiconductor. The calculated band gap of the pure Bi2S3 urchins is 1.2 eV and that of pure SnS2 is 2.48 eV. The band gap values were within the range of the previously reported value.48,49 The calculated band gaps of the heterostructures are 2.41 eV, 2.3 eV, and 2.16 eV for BSS1, BSS1.5, and BSS2, respectively.

The photocatalytic activity of the Bi2S3 urchins and the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures with different SnS2 loading were evaluated by the model dyes RhB and MB under solar light irradiation. No degradation was found in the absence of any sample. RhB was degraded within 5 min by the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructures (Fig. S5†), whereas MB was degraded within 30 min (Fig. S6†) under solar light irradiation. The change in the dye concentration with time is shown in Fig. 8A and C. The photodegradation of RhB in the presence of Bi2S3 was found to be very low and only 35% of the dye degraded after 5 min; in case of MB, 29% of the dye was degraded after 30 min. The photocatalytic activity increased significantly after the formation of the heterostructure. The heterostructure BSS1.5 (Bi2S3:SnS2 = 1:0.15) shows the best photocatalytic activity. In case of the BSS1.5 heterostructure, the RhB dye was degraded ∼94% within 5 min and MB was degraded ∼95% within 30 min. The reaction kinetics of the catalysts follow pseudo first order kinetics with respect to time; thus, the degradation rate constant (k) can be obtained from the linear fit of In(C/C0) = −kt. Here, C and C0 denote the real time and initial concentrations of the dyes, and t and k denote the irradiation time and the overall photodegradation rate constant, respectively. Fig. 8B and D depict the In(C/C0) vs. t plot to calculate the k values for all the samples and we can compare the photocatalytic degradation rate for the photocatalysts. The photodegradation rate constant for RhB was found to be 0.0842 min−1 for pure Bi2S3, whereas, in case of BSS1.5, it was 0.5632 min−1, which is ∼6 times higher than that of pure Bi2S3. However, BSS2 shows a lower photocatalytic activity (k = 0.2166 min−1) than that of BSS1.5. In case of MB, the photodegradation rate constant for Bi2S3 is 0.01129 min−1 and that of BSS1.5 is 0.09532 min−1, which is ∼8 times than that of pure one. The stability of the heterostructures was evaluated by XRD and SEM characterization of the samples after photocatalytic activity (Fig. S8†). No apparent change in the XRD pattern and the SEM images was observed after the photocatalytic activity, which in turn confirms the stability of the heterostructures.

The removal of toxic metal ions is necessary for the environmental remediation of the toxicity. Here, we reduced Cr(VI) ions to less toxic Cr(III) using the as-synthesized materials. Cr(III) is less harmful than Cr(VI) and can be precipitated easily in alkaline or neutral medium. Cr(VI) reduction in the presence of different photocatalysts was monitored by the absorption peak at ∼540 nm and is shown in Fig. S7.† The reduction concentration and the catalytic rate constants for different samples are shown in Fig. 8E and F. The photocatalytic rate constant for pure Bi2S3 was found to be 0.0085 min−1 and the best activity was found for the sample BSS1.5, which is ∼7 times greater than that of the pure one. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) follows the equation:4Cr2O72− + C6H5O73− + 41H+ + 6e− → 8Cr3+ + 6CO2 + 23H2OThus, these photocatalysts are beneficial for Cr(VI) reduction.
Photoconductivity and photoresponse properties
To explore the separation of the charge carriers of the as-synthesized heterostructures, the current–voltage and transient photocurrent response were investigated under a laser source (λ = 405 nm) with an irradiance power of 2.35 mW cm−2. Fig. 9 shows the current–voltage (I–V) plots (left panel) both in the presence (LIGHT) and absence (DARK) of light in the voltage range from −10 V to +10 V and the transient photocurrent curves (I–t) (right panel) at a bias voltage of −7 V (ON = irradiation on; OFF = irradiation off) for the photodetectors made from pure Bi2S3 and other Bi2S3/SnS2 (BSS1 and BSS1.5) heterostructures. The I–V characteristics show a non-ohmic type behavior. The photocurrent (IPhoto) values of all the samples show higher value than that of the dark current (IDark) at all the bias voltages. The photocurrent gain values as obtained from the transient photocurrent curves are ∼3.6, 5, and 33 for pure Bi2S3, BSS1, and BSS1.5 samples, respectively. The highest photocurrent gain value obtained for the BSS1.5 heterostructure is ∼10 times higher than that of the pure one. The higher and more stable photocurrent measured on the 3D–2D Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure indicates the higher generation, separation, and transfer efficiency of the reactive photocarriers under light irradiation.
 Fig. 9  The left panel shows the current–voltage (I–V) plots (A, C and E) of pure Bi2S3, BSS1, and BSS1.5 heterostructures. The right panel shows the transient photocurrent response (B, D and F) of the same at a bias voltage of −7 V. Maximum photocurrent gain was obtained for the BSS1.5 heterostructure. 
Relevant mechanism for photocatalytic activity
The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic effects of increased light absorption efficiency of the heterostructure and effective charge separation of the photogenerated charge carriers under solar light irradiation. Since the SnS2 nanosheets are much thinner, solar light can easily penetrate into the Bi2S3 nanorods assembly and effective charge carriers can be generated. Moreover, epitaxy formation between the interfaces between Bi2S3 and SnS2 as described in the TEM analysis section (BSS1.5 heterostructure) provides easy charge separation in the heterostructure. Therefore, these factors are significantly favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures than that of the pure one.
It is known that photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy can give information about the photoexcited electron transfer and recombination processes, and it has been widely used to study the fate of electron–hole pairs in photocatalytic systems. In this method, a smaller PL intensity reflects a more effective charge separation. The as-synthesized materials were excited with a wavelength of 340 nm and the emission spectra were collected in the range of 390–625 nm, as shown in Fig. S9.† The emission band centered at ∼450 nm was attributed to the intrinsic luminescence of Bi2S3. As expected, the intensity of the PL spectra decreased with the increase in the SnS2 concentration in the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure due to decreased electron–hole recombination rate. However, in case of BSS2, the intensity was significantly increased as the SnS2 nanosheets densely covered the Bi2S3 microurchins, leading to lesser charge separation.
In general, increased surface area leads to better photocatalytic performance. We performed nitrogen adsorption–deadsorption measurements to know more about the surface area and porous structure of the as-synthesized samples. The as-obtained isotherms were classified according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) classification. The BET isotherms and the pore size distributions of the samples are shown in Fig. S10A–C.† The typical type IV nature of the hysteresis curves indicated the porous structure of the as-synthesized samples. The surface area obtained from the BET analysis was 23.54 m2 g−1, 254.24 m2 g−1, and 41.95 m2 g−1 for the samples Bi2S3, BSS1.5, and BSS2, respectively. Also, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the samples shows non-uniform pore size distribution between 2 and 14 nm. The pore areas obtained from the graph are 2.73 m2 g−1, 29.60 m2 g−1, and 4.4 m2 g−1 for Bi2S3, BSS1.5, and BSS2, respectively. BSS1.5 has the highest specific area and pore area, which consequently shows the highest catalytic activity.
The band alignment between the heterostructures plays an important role in the separation of the photoexcited charge carriers. Different band alignment offers effective charge migration and enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The band positions of Bi2S3 and SnS2 can be estimated using the following equation:50EVB = χ − Ee + 0.5EgECB = EVB − Egwhere EVB is the valence band (VB) potential, ECB is the conduction band (CB) potential, Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor (1.3 eV for Bi2S3 and 2.48 eV for SnS2, as obtained from the optical study), and χ is the electronegativity of the semiconductor (5.28 eV for Bi2S3 and 6.3 eV for SnS2),46–51 which can be expressed as the geometric mean of the constituent atoms and Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV). The calculated values of ECB and EVB are summarized in Table S1.† Based on the as-calculated data, the band alignment of the heterostructure is shown in Scheme S1.† When both the semiconductors are excited by solar light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons will be transferred from the CB of Bi2S3 to the CB of SnS2 since the CB of SnS2 is 0.41 eV lower than that of Bi2S3, according to the formation of type II band alignment. On the other hand, photogenerated holes are transferred from the VB of SnS2 to the VB of Bi2S3 and a complete charge separation is possible. Therefore, Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure formation prolongs the lifetime of the charge carriers and the separation of the carriers will be possible. However, an excessive amount of SnS2 in the heterostructure (BSS2; Bi2S3:SnS2 = 1:0.2) can fully cover the Bi2S3 urchins, which may lead to lower catalytic activity. Therefore, we can say that heterostructure formation enhances the photocatalytic activity of the samples.
The photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules can be explained by the following mechanism. Photoexcited electrons in Bi2S3 can be transferred to the epitaxially connected SnS2 nanosheets. The photogenerated electrons on the surfaces of SnS2 can react with surface absorbed oxygen molecules to produce superoxide radical anions (˙O2−). The holes on the surface of Bi2S3 can be transferred to the absorbed H2O molecules to generate the highly oxidizing OH˙ radical according to the following redox steps.
Charge separationBi2S3 + hν → Bi2S3(eCB− + hVB+)
Charge transferBi2S3(eCB−) + SnS2 → SnS2(eCB−) + Bi2S3
Superoxide radical (˙O2−) formationSnS2(eCB−) + O2 → SnS2 + ˙O2−
OH˙ radical formation˙O2− + H2O → HO2˙ + OH−Bi2S3(hVB+) + OH− → OH˙ + Bi2S3
Dye degradationOH˙ + Dye molecule → CO2 + H2OTerephthalic acid (TA) test can be used to probe the formation of the OH˙ radical as an active photocatalytic species during photocatalysis. The reaction of TA with OH˙ radicals can generate fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH), which shows an emission peak at 430 nm with excitation at 315 nm.47 The PL intensity of TAOH is proportional to the amount of OH˙ produced on the surface of the photocatalysts. Fig. S11A in the ESI† shows the emission of the in situ formed TAOH in water in the presence of different photocatalysts when irradiated for 30 min. The maximum fluorescence intensity of TAOH was obtained for BSS1.5, which reveals maximum OH˙ radical formation by the BSS1.5 heterostructure at a fixed time of solar light irradiation. Fig. S11B–D† show that the photoluminescence intensity increases with increasing irradiation time. This clearly proves that OH˙ radical generation is directly proportional to the irradiation time. This experiment reveals that BSS1.5 generates the maximum amount of OH˙ radical and shows the highest photocatalytic activity.
Theoretical investigation
To calculate the electronic properties, we studied the band structures and density of states (DOS). From the band structure calculation, the band gap of Bi2S3 and SnS2 is 1.48 eV and 1.50 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10A and B, which agrees well with that of a previous report.52,53 As we have used PBE functional, there is a difference in the band gap from the experimental report. Although it is known that the band gaps are underestimated by this level of theory, the basic physics predicted here should be reliable.54 From the DOS calculation, it is seen that the valence band maxima of Bi2S3 mainly consisted of the 3p orbital of S whereas the conduction band minima mainly consisted of the 6p orbital of Bi (Fig. 10C). For SnS2, the VBM and CBM consisted of S 3p and Sn 5s, respectively (Fig. 9D). We also calculated the work functions by aligning the Fermi level with the vacuum energy level and obtained the work functions for Bi2S3 and SnS2 to be 4.80 eV and 6.90 eV, respectively. Due to the difference in the work functions, a spontaneous interfacial charge transfer results in a built-in electric field, which can promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Besides this, we also calculated the band edge alignment theoretically. For Bi2S3, we obtained the position of VB and CB as 1.60 eV and 0.12 eV, respectively, and for SnS2 the positions were 2.05 eV and 0.55 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the experimental report. This type of band edge alignment shows a type-II band alignment, which is desirable for solar light-driven photocatalytic performances.

Conclusion
In summary, a simple solvothermal process was developed to synthesize Bi2S3 urchin-like structure decorated with SnS2 nanosheets. The formation of the urchin-like structure with respect to time was evaluated. The unique epitaxy formation between Bi2S3 and SnS2 in the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure provides better charge separation in the heterostructure. Compared with pure Bi2S3, the heterostructure shows the best photocatalytic activity under solar light irradiation. The combined investigation with DFT calculations and experiments demonstrates that there is a difference in the surface work function of Bi2S3 and SnS2, which promotes the photoexcited charge separation in the heterostructure as well as the acceleration of the charge carriers. A typical type-II band alignment was suggested from the theoretical calculations. The lifetime of the charge carriers is prolonged due to the heterostructure formation and the better photocatalytic activity. Thus, the Bi2S3/SnS2 heterostructure formation was found to give the best catalytic activity for solar light-harvesting applications.
