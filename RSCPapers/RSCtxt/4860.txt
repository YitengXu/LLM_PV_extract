    , Accepted 1st October 2020First published on 1st October 2020AbstractOrganic–inorganic perovskites were treated with a CsI solution to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability. Due to the formation of CsPbI3 and trap filling in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites by CsI treatment, the power conversion efficiency was improved to 20.48%. The CsI-treated perovskites exhibited slower degradation under heating at 180 °C than the untreated perovskites.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as CH3NH3PbI3, have recently been of significant interest as light-harvesting materials of solar cells,1,2 due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%, which is almost equivalent to the performance of the present commercial Si solar cells (27.6%).3 The low processing temperature and solution processability of these perovskites are advantageous for roll-to-roll mass production using flexible plastic substrates,4–6 and thus a significant decrease in fabrication costs is expected. For these reasons, perovskite solar cells are attracting considerable attention as low-cost power-production devices for future applications.
Post-treatment of light-absorbing perovskite layers is one of the important approaches to improving the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells. Perovskite layers are typically formed by spin-coating precursor solutions that contain excess PbI2 to improve the crystallinity of the layers.7 However, resistive PbI2 that remains in the final perovskite layer impedes charge carrier diffusion and causes a loss of photovoltaic performance.8,9 To address this issue, the perovskite layers are often treated with methylammonium (CH3NH3 = MA)10–12 and formamidinium (CH(NH2)2 = FA) halide12,13 solutions to convert the unreacted PbI2 into perovskite materials (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3) and decrease the trap density, which leads to an improvement of the PCE. Treatment with amines having larger ionic radii, such as n-butylammonium iodide,14 5-ammoniumvaleric acid,15 and phenethylammonium iodide,16 forms robust two-dimensional perovskite materials on the pristine perovskite layers and improves both the PCE and stability of the solar cells.
Besides organic ammonium halides, cesium halides form perovskites such as CsPbI3 by reaction with PbI2. Therefore, it is expected that post-treatment of organic–inorganic perovskites with a CsI solution would also improve the photovoltaic performance. In addition, inorganic CsPbI3 has higher stability than the organic–inorganic perovskites FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 because inorganic Cs+ has higher stability than hygroscopic MA+ and FA+.17 Therefore, it is considered that incorporation of CsPbI3 by surface treatment of organic–inorganic perovskite materials with CsI would improve both the PCE and stability. In this study, post-treatment of organic–inorganic perovskite materials with CsI solution was performed, and the photovoltaic performance and thermal stability were evaluated. The results indicated that the PCE was increased to 20.48% due to the improved electrical conductivity of the perovskite layers and the durability during heating at 180 °C was improved.
Perovskite substrates were fabricated as follows. Compact TiO2 layers were formed on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by spray pyrolysis. Mesoporous TiO2 layers were formed on compact TiO2 layers by spin-coating a commercial paste (18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd) followed by sintering at 500 °C. Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites were formed according to a previous report.18 Briefly, a mixed solution of N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide containing FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) with a CsI additive was spin-coated on TiO2-coated substrates and annealed at 105 °C for 1 h. In the middle of the spin-coating process, chlorobenzene was poured on the substrates to induce crystallization of the perovskite. For CsI treatment, an anhydrous methanol solution of CsI was spin-coated on the perovskite layers and the substrates were annealed at 105 °C for 5 min. Further experimental details are provided in the ESI.†
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to characterize the perovskites with and without the CsI treatment (Fig. 1a and S1†). The diffraction peak for PbI2 at 12.7° was observed for the pristine perovskite, whereas it was absent for the 10 mM CsI solution-treated perovskite. This indicates that unreacted PbI2 in the pristine perovskite was converted to CsPbI3 by reaction with CsI. It was also assumed that perovskites treated with higher-concentration CsI solutions (>10 mM) contained excess CsI. On the other hand, when the perovskite was treated with 5 mM CsI solution, the PbI2 peak increased. This is because methanol solvent can dissolve FA+ and MA+ ions and degrade perovskites. In the presence of CsI more than 10 mM in methanol solution, the formation of CsPbI3 in the perovskite stabilizes the crystal structure and prevents the desorption of FA+ and MA+. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskites with and without 10 mM CsI treatment are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The treatment led to an increase in grain size, which was ascribed to the formation of the CsPbI3 perovskite by the reaction of PbI2 with CsI. The perovskites treated with a 20 mM CsI solution (Fig. 1d) exhibited similar crystal sizes to those treated with the 10 mM CsI solution because the unreacted PbI2 in the pristine perovskite was completely converted to CsPbI3 by treatment with the 10 mM CsI solution. The crystal size was similar among the perovskites treated with 10–50 mM CsI solutions (Fig. S2†). These results suggest that treatment with CsI solution >10 mM results in an excess amount of CsI in the perovskite without further yield of CsPbI3. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis of the perovskites with and without treatment with a 30 mM CsI solution was performed to observe the distribution of Cs+ ions in the perovskite layers (Fig. 1e). The Cs+ ions in both perovskite layers exhibited a concentration gradient, with a higher concentration closer to the surface. In a precursor solution, the Lewis acid–base adduct of the MAI (or FAI)-PbI2-dimethyl sulfoxide intermediate was formed and additives such as CsI were excluded to the surface of the perovskites.19,20 Therefore, the Cs+ concentration increased at the surface of the pristine perovskite. The Cs+ concentration increased by treatment with 30 mM CsI. The ratio of the Cs+ concentration in the 30 mM CsI-treated perovskite to that in the untreated perovskite had a relatively uniform value of about 3 (Fig. 1f). This indicates that Cs+ ions added by the post-treatment were uniformly diffused throughout the perovskite layer. The CsI treatment caused no change in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the perovskites (Fig. 1g), which indicates no change in the bandgap energy.

Solar cells were fabricated, and their photovoltaic performance was measured to evaluate the effect of the CsI treatment. Hole transport layers were formed on the perovskites by spin-coating a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt, tert-butylpyridine, and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyrydine)cobalt-(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide as dopants. Au contacts (3 mm × 3 mm) were formed by vapor deposition. A cross-sectional SEM image of a solar cell is shown in Fig. 2a. The thicknesses of the mesoporous TiO2, perovskite, and spiro-OMeTAD layers were ∼100 nm, ∼450 nm, and ∼200 nm, respectively. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for solar cells with and without CsI treatment were obtained under illumination with 1 sun (Fig. 2b and c, active area = 3 mm × 3 mm). Fig. 2d shows the external quantum efficiency spectra of the short-circuit photocurrents. The PCE and the solar cell parameters estimated from the J–V curves measured under a backward voltage scan (1.2 V → −0.2 V) are shown in Fig. 2e and Table 1. Although unreacted PbI2 in the perovskite layers was removed by treatment with 10 mM CsI, as confirmed by XRD measurements, the PCE reached a maximum when the perovskite was treated with CsI solutions of higher concentration (20–40 mM). Therefore, not only removal of PbI2 impurities, but also adding excess CsI is important for the improvement of the PCE. The increase in the PCE is mainly due to the improvement of the fill factor (FF; Fig. 2f). Similar results were observed in the J–V curves measured under a forward (−0.2 V → 1.3 V) voltage scan (Fig. S3† and Table S1†). We previously reported that in the case of perovskite treatment with an MAI solution, excess MAI to convert PbI2 into MAPbI3 is necessary to fill trap states in the perovskite for performance enhancement.11 It can thus be expected that in the case of CsI treatment, excess CsI introduced by post-treatment also fills the trap states.

The dark current for solar cells with and without CsI treatment was compared (Fig. 2g). In the bias voltage range over ∼0.9 V, solar cells with the CsI-treated perovskite exhibited a higher dark current density than the untreated perovskite solar cells, which suggests that the conductivity of the perovskite is improved by Cs+ post-doping. It has been reported that when an excess amount of MAI is contained in a precursor solution, the MAI at grain boundaries of the perovskite fills the defects of perovskite crystals and improves conductivity.19 It can be expected that the improved conductivity in our case of CsI post-treatment is also due to defect filling by an excess amount of CsI supplied by the post-treatment. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurement showed that the 30 mM CsI-treated perovskites formed on TiO2 exhibited a shorter carrier lifetime than the untreated perovskite, suggesting faster charge carrier collection to TiO2 (Fig. 2h). The best PCE of 20.48% was obtained using an anti-reflection film (MOSMITE, Mitsubishi Chemical) on the glass side of the solar cells (Fig. S4 and Table S2†).
Incorporation of Cs+ in organic–inorganic perovskites improves stability due to the strong interaction between Cs+ and halide ions and quenching of HI generation.18,21 Therefore, it can be expected that the increase of Cs+ by CsI post-treatment improves the stability of the perovskite layers. To compare the thermal stability of the CsI-treated and untreated perovskites, the FTO/TiO2/perovskite substrates were heated at 180 °C under a N2 atmosphere, after which UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured (Fig. 3a and b). Both the perovskites, with and without CsI treatment, showed a decrease in absorption in the 500–800 nm wavelength range after heating at 180 °C due to the thermal decomposition of MA+ and FA+ ions, whereby the perovskites (bandgap energy ∼800 nm) were converted into PbI222 (bandgap energy ∼500 nm (ref. 23)). The CsI-treated perovskite showed a smaller decrease in absorption than the untreated perovskite (Fig. 3c), which suggests that the increased amount of Cs+ in the perovskite prevented thermal degradation. The bandgap energy for the untreated perovskite was shifted from 780 nm to 810 nm (Fig. 3a). MA+ ions induce a larger bandgap energy in the perovskite than FA+ ions, and therefore, it can be expected that MA+ would degrade faster than FA+, which would cause a decrease in the bandgap energy for the entire perovskite layer. On the other hand, the bandgap energy was unchanged in the case of the CsI-treated perovskite (Fig. 3b), which suggests that the decomposition of MA+ ions was suppressed. For comparison, we have fabricated MAI- and FAI-treated perovskites and evaluated their thermal stability. The absorption decrease of CsI-treated perovskites is much slower than MAI- and FAI-treated perovskites (Fig. 3c and Fig. S5†) indicating that incorporation of Cs+ improves stability better than MA+ and FA+.

Conclusions
In conclusion, organic–inorganic perovskites were treated with a CsI solution to convert unreacted PbI2 into inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. Excess CsI increased the PCE of solar cells up to 20.48% due to the improved electrical conductivity of the perovskite layer. The thermal stability of the perovskite layer during heating at 180 °C was also improved by treatment with CsI.
