    , Accepted 23rd January 2019First published on 23rd January 2019AbstractThe efficiency of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) remains low compared to that of n-type congeners due to charge recombination events. We report a supramolecular approach to reduce recombination at the NiO–dye interface, realized by using the cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring (RING4+/RING3˙+) as a redox mediator and a dye (PN) functionalized with a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition site, promoting the supramolecular formation of a pseudorotaxane capable of directing charge transfer away from the NiO–dye interface. The binding affinity of RING4+ to PN is high (Kass = 3.4 × 104 M−1), with quenching of the photoexcited dye (PN*) ascribed to reduction of RING4+ to RING3˙+. The reduced RING3˙+ exhibits a lower binding affinity to PN, facilitating exchange with the excess RING4+ present in solution. This supramolecular phenomenon was implemented into p-type DSSCs by anchoring the PN dye on a NiO photocathode in conjunction with the RING4+/RING3˙+ redox couple, yielding a 10 fold enhancement in the short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) compared to control devices utilizing P1 dye or the methylviologen (MV2+/MV˙+) redox couple that cannot form pseudorotaxanes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), invented by O’Regan & Grätzel in 1991,1 have complementary advantages to traditional silicon solar cells including low-cost manufacturing,2 low-light performance,3 and tunable colors, making them useful for indoor applications and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).4 High-efficiency n-type DSSCs employ sterically demanding dyes and/or surface passivation to shield the TiO2–electrolyte interface and suppress the recombination of photoinjected electrons.5,6 This design principle has enabled the use of alternative redox mediators yielding enhancements of open-circuit voltages (VOC) that translate to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 14%.7,8
Complementary p-type DSSCs open avenues to tandem solar cells to attain greater PCEs while demonstrating utility for both photovoltaics and solar-driven fuel generation, but they are relatively unexplored compared to their n-type analogue.9–13 Intrinsic to the operation of p-type DSSCs is electron transfer from the Valence Band (VB) of the p-type semiconductor NiO to the excited state dye (D*).14,15 However, currently the highest efficiencies of p-type cells are 10 fold lower compared to those of the n-type analogues due to recombination phenomena.16,17 Electron propagation in p-type DSSCs and recombination phenomena are outlined in Fig. 1. Ideally the absorption of light to generate an excited state dye (D*) will proceed via an electron transfer from the VB of NiO (Process 2, Fig. 1) to afford the radical dye anion (D−). Regeneration of the ground-state dye proceeds via a second electron transfer to the redox mediator (Process 3, Fig. 1) allowing the reduced species of the redox couple to diffuse to the counter electrode, regenerate and complete the circuit (Process 4).

FTO = Fluorine Tin Oxide. RC = Redox Couple. CB = Conduction Band. VB = Valence Band. D = Dye. D* = excited state dye. D− = radical dye anion. 
Unfavorable recombination phenomena can lower the PCE by creating competition for the forward electron transfer to the redox couple.18,19 Ultrafast recombination between the radical dye anion and the hole in the VB of NiO (Process 6, Fig. 1) is ameliorated by the molecular engineering of donor–π–acceptor dyes. Spatial separation of the donor near the semiconductor surface and the acceptor away from the NiO surface promotes vectorial electron transfer away from the surface upon light absorption, increasing the lifetime of the photoreduced excited state.20–22 The second recombination process involves the electron transfer from the reduced redox couple to the VB of the NiO (Process 5, Fig. 1). As charge migration is relatively slow in NiO (4 × 10−8 cm2 s−1), this process also significantly contributes to the low efficiencies.23
With these challenges in mind, we propose a novel approach to the construction of a p-type DSSC in which we functionalize the dye with a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition site for the ring to form a pseudorotaxane with the cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring, RING4+, being the oxidized form of the redox couple.24 Electron transfer from D− reduces RING4+, yielding RING3˙+ which loses affinity for the recognition site and is driven away from the dye–semiconductor interface, facilitating charge rectification within the device (Fig. 2).

The ring in the oxidized form (RING4+, blue) has a high affinity for the binding site (DNP, in red) in contrast to the reduced ring (RING3˙+, green), leading to a high local concentration of RING4+ close to the dye. The molecular structures of PN, P1, the ring RING4+, MV2+ and the PN–(RING4+)2 complex (right). 
This self-assembly strategy is unknown for p-type cells based on the I−/I3− redox couple.25 Pre-organization of the redox couple should result in improving the competitiveness of forward electron propagation in the device compared to charge recombination. This is in contrast to the operation of current liquid DSSCs where the electron transfer between the dye and redox mediator is dictated by diffusion (collisional) phenomena.
In this paper we report the synthesis of dyes with recognition sites that facilitate pseudorotaxane formation and implementation into a p-type DSSC where the ring acts as a redox mediator. Initial experiments confirm that this supramolecular approach results in a ∼10 fold improvement in photocurrent compared to that of control cells without supramolecular motifs for pre-organization.
Results and discussion
Design and description of the components
Creating a switchable pseudorotaxane-based DSSC requires the components to meet specific criteria. Firstly, the oxidized form of the ring component in the pseudorotaxane must have a high affinity (high binding constant, Kass) for the recognition site, accompanied by a decrease in Kass upon reduction of the ring, facilitating ring exchange and charge transport. Secondly, the redox potentials of all of the components must promote forward electron propagation by an electron cascade triggered by the absorption of light to reduce the ring as the redox mediator. With these requirements in mind, we considered pseudorotaxanes developed by Stoddart and coworkers as suitable.24,26 The electron-deficient ring structure RING4+, or the famous “blue box”, exhibits a strong electrostatic interaction with the electron rich DNP (Fig. 2, in red).27 Upon reduction of RING4+ to RING3˙+via chemical,28 electrochemical29 or photochemical stimuli,30,31 the increase in electron density causes a loss of affinity for the DNP recognition site.26,32
We decided to modify the P1 dye system20,33 as it can accommodate the incorporation of the DNP recognition sites at the acceptor part with minimal perturbation of the dye electronic structure (Fig. 2) so that the energy levels of the NiO VB, the dye and the redox couple match to allow for forward electron propagation within the system (Fig. 3). Initial experiments showed that high concentrations of the ring caused detachment of the PN dye, a problem that was solved by using low concentrations of RING4+ and MV2+ as the main redox mediator as the former is essentially two connected MV2+ molecules.
 Fig. 3  A schematic energy diagram for the p-type DSSC based on the PN pseudorotaxane dye. Energy levels are represented in V versus NHE. This effectively creates a local high concentration of oxidized redox mediator in close proximity to the dye, facilitating the productive transfer processes compared to recombination pathways. 
Synthesis of the building blocks
The P1 dye20 and the [RING·4PF6]34 were prepared according to literature procedures. The PN dye functionalized with the DNP recognition site was prepared using a modified procedure, outlined in Scheme 1. The bisaldehyde 4 was reacted with malononitrile to obtain P1.20 The last step in the preparation of PN involves a Knoevenagel condensation of 4 with the cyanoacrylate-functionalized DNP unit 1. After purification by column chromatography the PN dye was obtained as a waxy red solid in 11% yield. The compound was comprehensively characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FD-MS, ATR-IR, CV, and UV-vis.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption maxima and electrochemical properties of P1 and PN are presented in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1. A strong absorption between 400–680 nm was ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer, with the maximum for PN (450 nm) slightly blue-shifted in comparison to that for P1 (475 nm). This blue shift arises from the slight difference in electron withdrawing capability of the acceptor due to the substitution of one cyano group with an ester. The absorption of the DNP unit is a clearly visible feature between 270–340 nm in the UV-vis spectrum of the PN dye, and the absorption spectrum of PN indeed approximates a superposition of the UV-vis spectra of both compound 1 and P1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the DNP unit in PN exhibits a structured fluorescence band with a maximum at 344 nm upon excitation at 310 nm, while the dye part of PN shows a broad fluorescence feature at 630 nm upon excitation at 450 nm as is shown in Fig. 4. There is no electronic communication between the DNP group and the dye part of PN as these fluorescence features are separated from each other and only appear upon excitation at 310 nm or 450 nm, respectively.

NMR investigation of binding phenomena
The binding of RING4+ to the PN dye is qualitatively confirmed by a 5 point 1H NMR titration (Fig. S13†). Mixing of the components resulted in an upfield shift for the resonances originating from RING4+ (δ = 0.02 ppm) and the DNP (δ = 0.20 ppm) moiety with concomitant peak broadening observed in the 1H NMR spectra. DOSY NMR (Fig. S14†) established that both the PN dye and RING4+ components in the PN–RING4+ complex demonstrate identical diffusion constants (5.50 × 10−10 m2 s−1) that are slightly smaller than that of the PN dye (1.02 × 10−9 m2 s−1) and significantly smaller than that of RING4+ (1.26 × 10−10 m2 s−1). This observation is consistent with the PN–RING4+ complex exhibiting rigidification upon complex formation at the DNP recognition site, manifesting in an increase in the hydrodynamic radius. Quantification of the binding constant (Kass), along with the photoinduced charge transfer in the PN–(RING4+)2 complexes, was investigated by fluorescence quenching studies.
Fluorescence quenching studies
The Kass of RING4+ to the PN dye was measured by titration, monitoring the quenching of emission from the DNP moiety in PN (lem = 344 nm) upon the addition of aliquots of RING4+.35 The Kass obtained by fitting the titration curve using a Host–Guest–Guest (HGG) model, as introduced by Hunter36 showed that binding of RING4+ to the two binding sites exhibited almost the same association constant (Kass = 3.4 × 104 M−1). The cooperativity factor α is determined to be 0.7, suggesting a minor negative cooperativity, i.e. the first binding event for the formation of PN–(RING4+) is slightly stronger than the second binding event to form PN–(RING4+)2. Overall the association constant is of the same order of magnitude as was previously reported for a related system.37
Next, it was investigated whether the ring is able to quench the excited state of the dye when bound to the DNP recognition site. Upon formation of the PN–(RING4+)2 complex, 83% of the fluorescence of the dye at 630 nm was quenched. No other emission was observed, which is in line with a photoinduced electron transfer process.
Photovoltaic properties
The NiO working electrodes were functionalized with sensitizers by soaking the electrodes in dye solution (P1 or PN in MeCN) for 16 hours. Adsorption of the dye was confirmed by the loss of the νCO bands of the acidic group of the dye in the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. S8†). Dye desorption experiments show that the dye coverage is 1.6 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for PN. To prove the effect of pseudorotaxane-mediated pre-organization, MV2+ on its own as the electrolyte was employed as the control for RING4+. They both demonstrate similar reduction potentials (Table S3†), differing in their ability to participate in pseudorotaxane formation, i.e.MV2+ is not able to form a pseudorotaxane whereas RING4+ is.38,39 DSSCs employing four different combinations of dye (either P1 or PN) and redox couple (either 25 mM MV2+/˙+ or 24.925 mM MV2+/˙+ with 75 μM (0.3 mol%) RING4+/˙3+) were fabricated. This relatively low concentration of RING4+ is used in the cell as initial experiments revealed that the use of 25 mM (i.e. 100%) RING4+/3˙+ as the electrolyte results in leaching of the PN dye from the surface, observed as the sensitized orange color of the photocathode disappearing upon introduction of the electrolyte (for further explanation see ESI 8†). The redox couple was added as a mixture of the reduced and non-reduced species (i.e.MV˙+:MV2+ = 9:1) by combining a pre-reduced 25 mM MV˙+ solution with a non-reduced 25 mM MV2+ solution. As the reduced electrolyte containing MV˙+ and RING3˙+ is sensitive to oxygen, all of the DSSCs were constructed under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen filled glovebox. The properties of the DSSCs were measured directly after fabrication in a two-electrode system, connected to a potentiostat to measure the Short-Circuit photocurrent density JSC (i.e. at zero bias) under AM1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 30 second cycles (Fig. 5), with the data summarized in Table 2.

The DSSCs based on the P1 and the PN dye with MV2+/˙+ as the electrolyte (Entry 1 and 2) give identical photocurrents, indicating that the new PN dye functions similarly to the known P1 dye in this set-up. Entry 2 shows that, in the presence of RING4+/˙3+ and in the absence of the recognition site, similar currents to those in Entry 1 and 3 are observed. Only DSSCs utilizing the PN dye and the RING4+/˙3+ redox mediator elements, conducive to pseudorotaxane formation, exhibit a dramatic increase in photocurrent (Entry 4). In addition the photocurrent profile features an initial spike at −17 μA cm−2 which decays down to a constant value of −9.56 μA cm−2, indicative of a mass transport limitation as the diffusion of MV2+/˙+ to the counter electrode is slower than the I−/I3− redox couple due to its larger molecular size. This is a well-known phenomenon in n-type DSSC with redox couples based on larger molecules than the I−/I3− redox couple.40,41
Although the photocurrents are low for the control DSSC, in these experiments the typical spike phenomenon is also observed (Fig. 5). These initial experiments demonstrate that the presence of a recognition site, enabling pre-organization of an electron acceptor by pseudorotaxane formation that also acts as a redox couple, leads to DSSCs exhibiting higher photocurrents. This suggests that the pseudorotaxane approach may indeed be a useful strategy to reduce charge recombination in p-type DSSCs.
Conclusions
We proposed here a new type of p-type DSSC where the redox acceptor is pre-organized to the dye, directing charge transfer away from the dye–electrolyte interface. We constructed a new dye, PN, based on the previously reported P1 dye, functionalized with DNP moieties that can form pseudorotaxanes with the electron acceptor RING4+, providing competition with recombination by directing charge transfer away from the dye. RING4+ shows a high binding affinity (3.4 × 104 M−1) for the DNP recognition sites installed on the PN dye and the affinity for the reduced ring RING3˙+ is known to be low. Implementation into p-type DSSCs showed that pseudorotaxane formation afforded photocurrents almost one order of magnitude higher than those of the control experiments. Future research will be focused on time-resolved characterization of the system to provide quantification of reductions in charge recombination. Also, as the eventual efficiencies of the fabricated DSSCs are still rather low, we aim to further improve this using the concept introduced in this paper.
Material and instruments
All of the reagents and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluorochem and VWR, and were used without purification. Compound 3 was obtained following a literature procedure.20 MeCN and THF were dried in a solvent purification system. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (SiliCycle, SiliaFlash P60, 40–63 μm, 230–400 mesh) while fractions were analyzed using TLC (TLC silica gel 60 F254 from Merck KGaA) visualized with 254/350 nm light. The products were analyzed using MS, NMR and IR. 1H-NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV300 and AV400 spectrometer and are reported in ppm using a solvent residual signal as an internal standard (7.26 ppm for CDCl3 and 2.05 ppm for (CD3)2CO). 2D 1H-DOSY spectral data were acquired with temperature and magnetic gradient calibration prior to the measurements, and the temperature was kept at 298 K during the measurements. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Alpha FTIR machine. The exact mass of the compounds was obtained on an AccuTOF GC v 4g, JMS-T100GCV Mass spectrometer (JEOL, Japan) equipped with an FD Emitter, Carbotec or Linden (Germany), FD 13 μm. The current rate was 51.2 mA min−1 over 1.2 min via a machine using field desorption (FD) as the ionization method. UV-vis measurements were performed on a single beam Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrometer in a 10 mm path length quartz cuvette using MeCN as the background. (Photo)electrochemical experiments were performed with a g-stat potentiostat from Autolab and an Oriel LCS-100 solar simulator. The light intensity was set to 100 mW cm−2via a calibrated DSSC Newport, 91150-2000. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog Jobin Yvon-SPEX together with their corresponding UV-vis spectra (Shimadzu UV-2700 Spectrophotometer).
Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication and characterization
The NiO was bought as a paste (Ni-Nanoxide N/SP from Solaronix) and screen printed on FTO glass obtained from Sigma Aldrich (2.2 mm, 7 Ω/sq) as 0.5 cm diameter circles. Sandwich cells were constructed with carbon based counter electrodes separated from the working electrode using Meltonix polymer 1170-60 (Solaronix, Switzerland) with a thickness of 60 μm. The preparation of electrolyte and the DSSCs was performed under inert atmosphere (N2) in a glovebox since the reduced species MV˙+ and RING3˙+ are reactive towards oxygen. The reduced MV˙+ was prepared by the addition of Zn dust (2 equiv.) to a 25 mM solution of MV2+ in 1 M LiTFSI as the supporting electrolyte in N2 degassed MeCN. Reduction is clearly visible as the color changes from colorless to dark blue. After stirring for 1 hour, the final electrolyte solution was prepared by adding 9 parts filtered reduced solution with 1 part oxidized MV2+, both 25 mM (either with 25 mM MV2+ or 24.925 mM MV2+ with 75 μM (0.3 mol%) RING4+). Filtration of the reduced solution is required to remove excess Zn dust and precipitated Zn2+. Then the electrolyte was introduced inside the cells via a pre-drilled hole. After cleaning and wiping the outside of the cell, the hole was sealed with the Meltonix polymer and optical glass plate by melting the polymer using a 350 °C heating source. The DSSCs were measured directly after fabrication using a g-stat potentiostat and solar simulator. The cells were masked to make sure 0.126 cm2 of the NiO surface was irradiated, to stay consistent throughout all of the measurements.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammograms and differential pulse voltammograms were recorded on a potentiostat PGSTAT302N from Autolab with a glassy carbon working electrode (MetrOhm, diameter 3 mm), a leakless Ag/AgCl reference electrode (eDAQ, ET069) and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The analyte solution was prepared by degassing a 100 mM TBAPF6 solution with N2 and adding this to the analyte to obtain a 0.5 mM final analyte solution.
Binding studies
In order to determine the Kass of the ring to the dye, a solution of PN was kept at a constant concentration (5 μM) and titrated with an increasing concentration of ring (2 mM and 10 mM) inside a fluorescence cuvette with a path length of 10 mm. After each addition of the ring the fluorescence at 344 nm was recorded by irradiation with 310 nm light and the UV-vis spectrum was measured to correct for the inner-filter effect following the formula described by Turner and coworkers:42  
The corrected data was fitted to a 1:2 host–guest model using a Matlab script.43
Excited state quenching studies
The excited state quenching studies were performed using a similar approach to that of the determination of Kass. The PN was kept at a constant concentration (10 μM) and was titrated with an increasing concentration of ring (4 mM and 20 mM). The decrease in the fluorescence at 630 nm upon excitation with 450 nm light was directly used to determine the amount of quenching and no correction was needed as there was no self-absorption of the sample at 630 nm.

The ring [RING·4PF6]
The ring was synthesized based on a protocol described in the literature with minor modifications.34
Compound 6 was combined with bromoxylene and the template in dry DMF and stirred for 30 days. After one night, a purple precipitate was observed. After 30 days the product was precipitated by the addition of ether. The purple solid was dissolved in 1 M NH4Cl (50 mL) and to this, 50 mL of DCM was added. This mixture was heated at reflux under gentle stirring until the purple color disappeared. The DCM layer was separated from the water layer, after which the water layer was heated again at reflux with DCM. This was repeated two times until the purple color had disappeared completely. Upon addition of NH4PF6 to this water solution, a white precipitate was obtained. The solid was filtered and washed thoroughly with Milli-Q and ether. The product was obtained from recrystallization from acetonitrile. The 1H NMR corresponds to the literature.34

Salt exchange [MV·2(PF6)]. 
Methyl viologen dichloride (MV·Cl2) (1.00 g; 7.78 mmol) was dissolved in Milli-Q water. To this, NH4PF6 was added as a solid until no more precipitation was observed. The white solid was filtered and washed thoroughly with Milli-Q and ether after which it was dried in a vacuum oven. The white solid was used without further purification.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  A schematic representation of a p-type DSSC. The blue arrows represent the forward electron propagation processes and the red arrows show the unfavorable recombination phenomena. FTO = Fluorine Tin Oxide. RC = Redox Couple. CB = Conduction Band. VB = Valence Band. D = Dye. D* = excited state dye. D− = radical dye anion.	 

 	Fig. 2  The proposed operational principle of the pseudorotaxane-based p-type DSSC. The ring in the oxidized form (RING4+, blue) has a high affinity for the binding site (DNP, in red) in contrast to the reduced ring (RING3˙+, green), leading to a high local concentration of RING4+ close to the dye. The molecular structures of PN, P1, the ring RING4+, MV2+ and the PN–(RING4+)2 complex (right).	 

 	Fig. 3  A schematic energy diagram for the p-type DSSC based on the PN pseudorotaxane dye. Energy levels are represented in V versus NHE. This effectively creates a local high concentration of oxidized redox mediator in close proximity to the dye, facilitating the productive transfer processes compared to recombination pathways.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of PN dye with DNP recognition sites and synthesis of the ring.	 

 	Fig. 4  UV-vis spectra of P1 (solid blue line), PN (solid red line) and compound 1 (solid green line) together with the normalized emission spectrum of PN upon excitation at 450 nm (dashed red line).
