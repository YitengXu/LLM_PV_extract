CdS nanorods grew on the surface of the existing CdS nanorods to form hierarchical assemblies. After the chemical bath deposition process, core–shell structures of branched CdS nanorods covered by a uniform CdSe overlayer were formed.

After CdSe sensitization, with the optical absorption greatly extended to longer wavelengths and the photoexcited charge carriers efficiently separated at the type II CdS/CdSe interface, the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures showed considerably increased photoelectrochemical performance compared with the CdS/CdSe nanorods, with a photoconversion efficiency for solar hydrogen generation of 2.7%.
1. Introduction
The development and utilization of renewable energy, especially solar energy, is becoming increasingly important as a result of the depletion of fossil fuels and global climate change. As one of the more promising solar energy conversion technologies, solar hydrogen production via the photoelectrochemical splitting of water has attracted considerable interest since it was first reported in 1972.1 Various photoelectrode materials have been investigated, including ZnO,2–5 TiO2,6–8 WO3,9–11 BiVO412–14 and Fe2O3.15–18 However, the large band gaps of most metal oxides limits their application as efficient photoelectrochemical electrodes in solar hydrogen generation.19
Compared with single semiconductors, heterojunction electrodes containing two or more different semiconductors have significant advantages in both optical absorption and charge carrier separation.20 Wide bandgap semiconductor electrodes (e.g. TiO2, ZnO) sensitized with narrow bandgap semiconductors (e.g. CdS, CdSe, CdTe) have been emerging as a new kind of heterojunction photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical applications, with optical absorption extended to the visible and even near-infrared region.21–25 CdSe, with a small band gap of ∼1.7 eV and exhibiting a wide range of absorption in the visible region up to 730 nm, has been widely used as a light sensitizer for photoelectrodes in solar cells, solar water splitting and in photodetectors.26–28
It has been generally accepted that the nanostructure of semiconductor electrodes plays a significant part in the solar energy conversion performance.29 One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have great potential in efficient charge collection for improved solar water splitting as a result of directed charge carrier transport along the 1D pathway and reduced charge carrier recombination.30 Intensive studies on various semiconductor photoelectrodes (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, WO3) have revealed that 1D nanostructures, including nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes, always have a much higher photoelectrochemical performance than their particulate counterparts, mainly due to efficient charge carrier transportation in the 1D direct conduction pathway.31–34 Further sensitization of 1D nanostructures with narrow bandgap quantum dots has been used for efficient solar energy conversion as a result of the synergy between the improved optical absorption and promoted charge transfer ability.29 Wang et al.35 fabricated 1D CdSe/ZnO arrays as photoanodes with a maximum photocurrent density of 2.55 mA cm−2 under solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, which was over 12 times higher than that of bare 1D ZnO arrays. A novel double-sided CdS and CdSe quantum dot co-sensitized ZnO nanowire array photoanode was designed by Wang et al.24 for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation, exhibiting strong absorption over almost the entire visible spectrum up to 650 nm and an improved charge collection efficiency. The photoanode yielded a significant photocurrent density of ∼12 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V and a high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of ∼45% at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
Branched hierarchical nanostructures, with 1D nanoarrays grown on a separate 1D structure, have recently attracted much interest in the field of solar energy conversion and their intrinsic superiority in optical absorption and charge carrier transportation has been demonstrated in different studies.36 Compared with individual 1D nanostructures, branched hierarchical nanostructures effectively improve light absorption as a result of the increased optical path as well as additional light trapping through multiple scattering.36,37 The direct charge carrier transport pathway in both the trunks and branches increases the charge collection efficiency.38–42 In all these previous studies,36,43,44 the branched hierarchical nanostructures displayed a much higher photoconversion performance than the 1D nanostructures. For instance, Huang et al.45 synthesized 3D hierarchical ultrathin branched CdS nanowire arrays that had a ten-fold enhancement in photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution driven by visible light compared with lower dimensional CdS nanostructures as a result of the increased optical path length and additional light trapping.
In this study, CdS was used as the photoelectrode material for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation because of its small band gap of ∼2.3 eV and superior electrical conductivity.46 Using a two-step hydrothermal process, branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were grown on conductive substrates for efficient light absorption and charge transportation and then further sensitized by CdSe via a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The light absorption was extended to the long wavelength region and charge carrier separation was promoted at the CdS/CdSe interface. Compared with the CdSe-sensitized 1D CdS nanorods reported in our previous study (photoconversion efficiency, η = 1.6%),47 the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures in this study showed much higher photoconversion efficiency (η = 2.7%).
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
Branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (TEC-15, 15 Ω/sp (ohms per square)) via a two-step hydrothermal method. The FTO glasses were cleaned by successive ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 15 min each and then dried in a stream of nitrogen.
In the first hydrothermal step in which CdS nanorods were grown,48 the FTO glasses were placed into a mixed aqueous solution of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0167 mol L−1), thiourea (0.05 mol L−1) and glutathione (0.01 mol L−1) in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel, which was then sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 2.5 h. The deposited nanorod films were naturally cooled to room temperature, rinsed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in a stream of nitrogen. The CdS nanorod arrays were next placed into 5 vol% HCl for 30 s and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. In the second hydrothermal step in which the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were grown, the HCl-treated films of CdS nanorod arrays were hydrothermally treated for 2 h under the same conditions as in the first hydrothermal step and then rinsed with water and ethanol and dried in a stream of nitrogen.
The branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were sensitized with CdSe using a CBD approach. First, an Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.01 mol of Se powder in 50 mL of a solution of Na2SO3 (0.5 mol L−1) and then refluxing at 70 °C for 5 h with a flow of nitrogen as a protective atmosphere. The resultant Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was stored in a conical beaker until further use. A Cd2+ solution was prepared by adding 0.2525 g of KOH, 0.285 g of nitrilotriacetic acid and 0.3085 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O to 50 mL of deionized water with strong magnetic stirring; this was then heated to, and maintained at, the desired CBD temperatures (60, 70, 80 and 90 °C) for 30 min. A 5 mL volume of the Na2SeSO3 solution was then added to the Cd2+ solution. The branched CdS hierarchical nanostructure was placed into this solution at a measured angle and maintained at different temperatures for 60 min for the CBD process. After the CBD process, the resultant CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were rinsed with deionized water and dried in a stream of nitrogen. The samples were described as CdS/CdSe-A, where A = 60, 70, 80, 90, to represent the different CBD temperatures of 60, 70, 80 and 90 °C, respectively.
2.2 Characterization
The sample morphology was observed using a JEOL JSM-7800FE scanning electron microscope and an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The transmission spectra of the samples were measured with a Hitachi U-4100 UV-visible-near-IR spectrophotometer. Elemental analysis was carried out using an Oxford INCA energy-dispersive X-ray detector mounted in the FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell with an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.5 M) as the electrolyte. The CdS/CdSe-A films used as the working electrode were mounted onto a specially designed electrode holder. The surface areas exposed to the electrolyte were fixed at 0.785 cm2. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and a large area platinum plate was used as the counter electrode. An electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI760D) and a 300 W Xe lamp (AM 1.5G filter, 100 mW cm−2) were used for the photocurrent measurements.
The IPCE was measured in a two-electrode system with an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.5 M, pH 10) as the electrolyte. The absolute intensity of the incident light was recorded with an Avaspec-2048 fiber optic spectrometer from Avantes. The IPCE was calculated according to the formula:49 (1)where Iph,λ is the photocurrent density, Pλ is the power intensity of the light and ħ, c and e are Planck's constant, the speed of light in a vacuum and the elementary charge, respectively.
The solar energy to chemical energy conversion efficiency, or photoconversion efficiency (η), was calculated as:50 (2)where Jp is the photocurrent density (mW cm−2), JpE0rev is total energy output, JpEapp is the total electrical energy input and I0 is the power density of the incident light (mW cm−2). E0rev refers to the standard reversible potential of 1.23 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode. The applied potential is Eapp= Emeans − Eaoc, where Emeans refers to the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent is measured under irradiation and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions with the same irradiation and in the same electrolyte (0.5 M Na2SO3 solution).
3. Results and discussion
Branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process. Fig. 1a shows that CdS nanorods with diameters of ∼100 nm were formed on the FTO substrate during the first step of the hydrothermal process. During the second step of the hydrothermal process, CdS nanorods with diameters of 50–100 nm were grown on the top and side surfaces of the pristine CdS nanorods to form branched hierarchical structures (Fig. 1b). In the hydrothermal process, glutathione was added to the aqueous solution as a stabilizer and was selectively adsorbed on the (010), (100), (110) low-index faces of the CdS nanocrystals, slowing crystal growth along the sides, but allowing growth along the vertical direction, which led to the formation of CdS nanorods with an oriented structure. Pretreatment with HCl before the second step of the hydrothermal process removed the glutathione adsorbed on the low-index faces of the CdS nanorods. The exposed low-index faces then acted as seed layers in the second hydrothermal step, leading to the formation of branched CdS hierarchical structures.51 Compared with the CdS nanorods, the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures displayed a larger specific surface area, which led to a better contact between the electrodes and electrolyte and created more surface reactive sites for photoelectrochemical water-splitting reactions.52Via the CBD process, CdSe was successfully decorated onto the surface of the branched CdS nanorod structures. As shown in Fig. 1c–f, different CBD temperatures led to obviously different morphologies for the resultant CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures (e.g. CdS/CdSe-A, where A = 60, 70, 80, 90). When the CBD temperature was 60 °C, only separate CdSe nanoparticles were dispersed on the branched CdS nanorod surfaces (Fig. 1c). With increasing CBD temperature, the surfaces of the branched CdS nanorods were partially covered in the CdS/CdSe-70 structures (Fig. 1d, inset), but fully covered by CdSe overlayers in the CdS/CdSe-80 structures (Fig. 1e). As the CBD temperature was further increased to 90 °C, the CdSe overlayer became slightly thicker, resulting in a slight increase in the diameter of the nanorods (Fig. 1f).

Fig. 1g shows the XRD patterns of the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures obtained by the two-step hydrothermal process and the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures obtained via the CBD process. For the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures, the diffraction patterns can be indexed to hexagonal CdS (reference code 00-041-1049). The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.8, 26.5 and 28.2° were indexed to the {100}, {002} and {101} planes of hexagonal CdS, respectively. For the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures, except for the diffraction peaks belonging to CdS, two minor peaks at 2θ = 25.4 and 42.0°, which can be indexed to the cubic CdSe {111} and {220} planes (reference code: 00-019-0191), were observed. With increasing CBD temperature, the intensity of the CdS diffraction peaks gradually decreased and the CdSe peaks became clearer, mainly due to the increasing thickness of the CdSe overlayers. Fig. 1h shows that the optical absorption edge of the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructure at about 550 nm was gradually shifted to longer wavelengths, up to 700 nm, when the CBD temperature for CdSe deposition increased from 60 to 90 °C. This clearly demonstrates that CdSe sensitization could effectively extend the optical absorption of CdS to the longer wavelength visible region, which contributed to the improved photoelectrochemical performance of the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures under solar light.
Morphological and crystallographic information about the synthesized samples were further recorded by TEM and selected area fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a clearly shows the formation of branched nanostructures of CdS nanorods via the two-step hydrothermal process, which is consistent with the SEM observations. However, as a result of the scraping and ultrasonic processes during sample preparation for TEM, only partially broken branched nanorods were observed. The clear lattice fringes in Fig. 2b suggest that the CdS lattice was highly ordered without any obvious stacking faults or dislocations. The 0.34 and 0.36 nm d-spacings of the lattice fringes can be assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of hexagonal CdS, respectively, as confirmed by the FFT patterns in the inset of Fig. 2b. After CBD deposition, a CdSe overlayer with a thickness of ∼10 nm was successfully created on the surface of the CdS nanorods for CdS/CdSe-80 (Fig. 2c). Except for the 0.34 and 0.36 nm lattice fringes of CdS in the internal region of the nanorods, d-spacings of 0.35 and 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (220) planes of cubic CdSe, were also measured in the HRTEM images and the FFT patterns (Fig. 2d), suggesting the successful formation of CdS/CdSe heterojunctions. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry elemental mapping was conducted to investigate the distribution of elements in the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures (Fig. 2f–h). Cd, Se and S were uniformly distributed throughout the entire heterostructure, confirming the homogeneous distribution of the CdSe overlayer on the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructure. The S signal was much weaker than those of Cd and Se, probably because of the uniform coverage of the CdSe overlayer on the CdS nanorods.

Fig. 3 shows the photoelectrochemical performance of the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures for solar hydrogen generation. Fig. 3a and b show that the dark current densities for all the samples could be neglected, whereas, on irradiation, the photocurrent increased significantly depending on the applied potential. Compared with the branched CdS films, all the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures exhibited a much higher photoelectrochemical performance, whereas the CdS/CdSe-A (A = 70, 80, 90) structures displayed similar photocurrent profiles with a high photocurrent density, e.g. 4.3 mA cm−2 obtained over CdS/CdSe-80 at an applied potential of 0.74 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). It is worth noting that all the CdS/CdSe films showed a good photoelectrochemical performance under low applied potentials. For example, the photocurrents of CdS/CdSe-A (A = 70, 80, 90) were all >3 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, suggesting that the CdSe-sensitized CdS films showed better optical absorption and charge transfer properties. These three samples also had similar photoelectrochemical performances, which may be due to the tradeoff between light absorption and charge transfer depending on the deposition of CdSe. Compared with CdS/CdSe-80, CdS/CdSe-70 with less CdSe deposition had a lower optical absorption (Fig. 1h). Although CdS/CdSe-90 exhibited a better deposition of CdSe (the enhanced light absorption shown in Fig. 1f), excess deposition of CdSe also inhibited charge transfer at the interfaces between the CdSe shell and the CdS core. Therefore the similar photocurrent densities obtained over CdS/CdSe-A (A = 70, 80, 90) are reasonable. When compared with the rod-like CdS and rod-like CdS/CdSe-80 films, the branched CdS and branched CdS/CdSe-80 films had a higher photocurrent performance (Fig. 3b), which is related to the branched hierarchical nanostructure improving the optical absorption and increasing the specific surface area and number of surface reactive sites.53 The electrochemical active surface area was measured for both the CdSe-sensitized rod-like and branched CdS nanorod arrays by determining the double-layer capacitance by cyclic voltammetry54 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The results showed that the electrochemical active surface area of the branched CdS/CdSe-80 was nearly three times that of the rod-like CdS/CdSe-80. Further comparison of the IPCE profiles in Fig. 3c confirmed the higher photoelectrochemical performance of the branched hierarchical nanostructures compared with the rod-like nanostructures for either CdS or CdS/CdSe. As a result of the increased optical path length and additional light trapping, the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures showed a better IPCE performance than the rod-like CdS at wavelengths of 520–580 nm. Compared with the bare rod-like and branched CdS films, the CdSe-sensitized CdS samples showed a substantially enhanced IPCE in the visible region (400–700 nm), primarily due to the extended light absorption induced by the CdSe sensitizers as well as the type II band structure promoting interfacial charge separation.

(b) Current–potential characteristics, (c) IPCE profiles and (d) photoconversion efficiencies of rod-like CdS, branched CdS, rod-like CdS/CdSe-80 and branched CdS/CdSe-80 films. 

Fig. 3d demonstrates the photoconversion efficiencies of rod-like CdS, branched CdS, rod-like CdS/CdSe-80 and branched CdS/CdSe-80 films, with detailed information given in Table S1 (ESI†). Similar to the IPCE results, Fig. 3d (see also Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the branched hierarchical nanostructures exhibited higher photoconversion efficiencies than the rod-like structures, while CdSe sensitization greatly improved the photoconversion efficiencies for both the branched hierarchical nanostructures and the rod-like structures of CdS. The maximum photoconversion efficiency reached ∼2.7% for the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructure CdS/CdSe-80 at an applied potential of –0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, an increase of 2.5 times relative to that of the bare branched CdS film and also much higher than the rod-like CdS/CdSe nanostructures.
All these observations indicate that the branched hierarchical nanostructure can improve the optical absorption by increasing the optical path length via additional light trapping as well as increasing the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte for more reactive sites, contributing to the higher photoelectrochemical performance relative to the rod-like nanostructures. CdSe may be a good sensitizer, extending the optical absorption of CdS to longer wavelengths and creating a type II band structure that promotes the interfacial charge separation, resulting in increased photoconversion efficiencies.

Fig. 4 shows the proposed fabrication process for the branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructures. A two-step hydrothermal process was used to form branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures (Fig. 4a and b) and a CBD process was used to sensitize the as-obtained branched CdS nanostructures with CdSe (Fig. 4c). Compared with the CdSe-sensitized 1D CdS nanorods in our previous work47 (photoconversion efficiency, η = 1.6%), the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures in this study showed a much higher photoconversion efficiency (η = 2.7%) for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation. This excellent photoelectrochemical performance relies on the synergistic effects of the branched hierarchical structure and the type II band structure formed at the CdS/CdSe interface. First, the branched structure not only increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, resulting in more surface sites for electrochemical reactions, but also improves light absorption as a result of the increased optical path length and additional light trapping (Fig. 4b). The direct charge carrier transport pathway in both the trunks and branches boosts the charge collection efficiency (Fig. 4b). Second, CdSe has a narrow band gap, which can extend the optical absorption of CdS to longer wavelengths for more efficient light utilization (Fig. 4c). The type II band structure formed at the CdS/CdSe interface could drive photoexcited electron migration from CdSe to CdS and photoexcited hole migration from CdS to CdSe (Fig. 4d), leading to efficient charge carrier separation for improved photoelectrochemical performance.55–57

4. Conclusions
Branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures were successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process and were then sensitized by CdSe, forming a branched CdS/CdSe hierarchical nanostructure through a mild CBD process. A uniform CdSe overlayer was created on the surface of the branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures and the optical absorption was extended from 550 to 700 nm; charge carrier separation was promoted at the CdS/CdSe interface, giving rise to a much higher photoelectrochemical performance than obtained with bare CdS. A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 2.7% for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation was obtained over the CdSe-sensitized branched CdS hierarchical nanostructures, which was much higher than that over the CdSe-sensitized CdS nanorod films. This increase in photoelectrochemical performance can be explained by the positive effects of the branched hierarchical nanostructure in improving the optical absorption and increasing the number of surface reactive sites.
