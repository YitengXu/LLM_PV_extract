    , Accepted 17th September 2015First published on 18th September 2015AbstractA gold-coupled ZnTe/ZnO-nanowire array is a new photocathode for selective CO2 reduction to CO. At −0.7 VRHE under simulated 1 sun illumination, its photocurrent (−16.0 mA cm−2) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (97%) represent the highest among reported ZnTe photocathodes for CO2 reduction and dramatic enhancement from those of a bare electrode (−7.9 mA cm−2, 68%). In addition, the Au nanoparticles convert mainly-hydrogen-producing bare ZnTe/ZnO-nanowires into mainly-CO-producing photocathodes in photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction. The remarkable effects of the Au co-catalyst originate from the formation of a Schottky junction with ZnTe to improve charge separation and to provide reaction centers for CO2 reduction suppressing competing water reduction.

Broader context
Carbon dioxide (CO2) reutilization has been attracting great global attention in recent years to capture the most important greenhouse gas and to convert it into valuable chemicals and fuels. Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction using abundant solar light and water is an ideal path to CO2 reutilization because of cleanness and sustainability of the technology. Unfortunately, however, there are a number of technical barriers to overcome before the practical applications including the low solar energy conversion efficiency of the photoelectrodes and the low selectivity of the CO2-reducing electrocatalyst to a desired product molecule. The Au coupled ZnO/ZnTe composite photocathode reported here demonstrates excellent efficiency and high selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO. In particular, Au nanoparticles improve photogenerated carrier separation by Schottky junction formation and promote selective CO production suppressing competing water reduction to H2.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide conversion to clean and renewable chemicals or fuels has received a great deal of attention in recent years as a means of CO2 reutilization. Although the combustion of these fuels produces CO2 again, the technologies reduce the rate of new carbon being added to the environment. In addition, they can produce liquid hydrocarbons useful for the transportation industry to decarbonize. Among many possible strategies of CO2 reduction, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is an ideal pathway to reutilize CO2 as a feedstock for various chemicals and fuels by using abundant solar light and water in a clean and sustainable manner.1–3
However, the development of this field has been slow mainly due to inadequate performance of the (photo)electrodes showing a low efficiency, a high overpotential to reduce CO2, and a low electrical and chemical stability in aqueous electrolytes.4,5 Many semiconductor photocathodes have been investigated, such as GaP,1 InP,6 p-Si,7 Cu2O,8 and CuFeO2,9 yet there is still no material that is free from those limitations. Another important issue in (photo)electrochemical CO2 reduction is the competition between the reduction reactions of CO2 (to carbon-based chemicals) and water (to hydrogen) due to their similar reduction potentials.10 The formation of a variety of products by CO2 reduction is a drawback that could make practical processes complicated with additional costs for separation. The reaction involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfer and overlapped redox potentials to form HCOOH, CO, HCHO, CH3OH, CH4 and higher hydrocarbons.11–13
ZnTe is a promising p-type semiconductor as a photocathode with many desired properties including the small direct band gap of 2.26 eV to utilize the solar spectrum effectively. In particular, its most negative conduction band edge position (−1.63 VRHE) among p-type semiconductors known so far provides a large driving force for electron transfer from semiconductor electrodes to acceptors in electrolytes. However, the ZnTe photocathode has not been fully studied as photoelectrodes. The promotion of simultaneous reductions of CO2 (mainly to CO) and water (to H2), and thus a low selectivity to CO has been a challenge.14,15 Here, we report an Au-coupled ZnTe/ZnO-nanowire (NW) heterojunction photocathode for PEC CO2 reduction for the first time. In an attempt to catalyze selective production of CO, a useful feedstock to produce a number of chemicals and fuels, Au nanoparticles were strategically deposited onto a ZnTe/ZnO-NW array because of its high electrocatalytic effect of converting CO2 to CO16,17 Thus, the Au-coupled composite recorded >10-fold increase in the production of CO with a high faradaic efficiency of ∼90% compared with bare ZnTe/ZnO-NWs. Also the CO selectivity relative to H2 was improved by >7.5 fold with Au deposition.
Experimental section
Synthesis of ZnTe/ZnO heterojuntion arrays
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The ZnTe/ZnO photocathode was synthesized by the modified dissolution–recrystallization method. The ZnTe/ZnO electrode was fabricated by the two-step method. First, ZnO nanowires were synthesized on the Zn sheet (Nilaco, 99.5%) in the 10 mM zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99%, Aldrich) aqueous solution with ammonia water (NH3, 28.0–30.0 wt%, Aldrich). The substrate and solution were maintained at 95 °C for 1.5 h. After the reaction, the substrate was washed several times with de-ionized water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 6 h. As a second step, ZnTe crystals were fabricated on the top of ZnO nanowires in an aqueous solution containing 3.6 mM sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3, 99%, Aldrich) and 0.66 M hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4·H2O, Aldrich). The ZnO nanowire array substrate and the solution were loaded into a microwave reactor (Discover SP, CEM Corporation) equipped with a temperature programmer. The solution and the substrate were heated to 195 °C within 10 min and maintained at 195 °C for 2 h. After reaction, the ZnTe/ZnO substrate was washed several times with de-ionized water, dried at 60 °C for 12 h and then annealed at 300 °C for 2 h under Ar flow (100 sccm).
Deposition of Au nanoparticles on ZnTe/ZnO heterojunction arrays
Au-nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited onto the ZnTe/ZnO substrate using an e-beam evaporator (Temescal, USA) at a substrate temperature of 250 °C and a deposition rate of 0.02 nm s−1 in a 1.6 × 10−4 Pa vacuum chamber. The size distribution of Au nanoparticles was controlled by the deposition time after opening the shutter of the system and using a calibrated quartz crystal reference. This procedure enables the control of the nanoparticle size around 2–5 nm. Then the Au deposited ZnTe/ZnO was annealed at 300 °C for 1 h under N2 flow (100 sccm).
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2
The photoelectrochemical performance of the electrodes was measured in a three-electrode system under front-side illumination from a solar simulator (91–160, Oriel) with an air mass 1.5G filter. The simulated light intensity was calibrated to be 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a reference guaranteed by National Renewable Energy Laboratories, U.S. The Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl was used as a reference electrode and a Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was CO2-saturated 0.5 M potassium bicarbonate (Wako, 99.9%) solution with a pH of 7.5. The photo-activated CO2 reduction was measured under chopped illumination for observing the photo-response under dark and light simultaneously.
A potentiostat (Gamry Reference 600TM) applied an external bias potential to the system and the scan rate for the linear sweep voltammetry was 5 mV s−1. The gas evolution by photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction was measured in the same system (Scheme S1 in the ESI†). An Agilent Model 7890 gas chromatograph with a Carboxen 1000 packed column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for the analysis. The gaseous samples were tested for potential products of CO2 reduction such as CO, methane, ethylene and ethane by injecting onto the gas chromatograph. An Agilent poraplot-Q capillary column was employed for testing the liquid products of methanol and ethanol with an FID detector. An attempt to measure the quantity of HCOOH was made by high resolution liquid chromatography (HPLC; Agilent 1200) using a C18-inverse column.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Xe lamp (300 W, Oriel) and a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm. The IPCE was measured at −0.7 V vs. RHE in a 0.5 M CO2-saturated potassium bicarbonate solution (pH 7.5). Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at −0.7 V vs. RHE of the DC potential and AC potential frequency range from 100000 to 0.1 Hz with 10 mV amplitude. The Z-View software (Scribner Associates Inc.) was used to fit the obtained data to the corresponding equivalent circuit model.
Characterization of physical properties
The morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JMS-7401F and Philips Electron Optics B. V. XL30S FEG, operated at 10 keV), X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD, Mac Science, M18XHF using Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Cs-corrected, JEOL JEM-2200FS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS, Shimadzu, UV2501PC).
Results and discussion
Fabrication of Au-coupled ZnTe/ZnO nanowire arrays of tulip-like morphology
The fabrication of Au-coupled ZnTe/ZnO-NW composite photocathodes starts from the growth of ZnO nanowires on a Zn sheet. ZnTe is directly formed on the ZnO nanowires by a modified microwave hydrothermal reaction.14 The ZnO nanowires act as a Zn source for ZnTe, as well as a bridge for photogenerated charge transfer to provide a remarkably high performance compared to previous reports.15,18 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZnO nanowires on the Zn substrate (denoted as ZO) shows both Zn (JCPDS no. 03-065-3358) and hexagonal wurtzite structures of ZnO peaks (JCPDS no. 01-089-0511) in Fig. 1a. The XRD peaks of the ZnTe/ZnO-NW composite (ZOZT) indicate the formation of zinc-blende ZnTe (JCPDS no. 01-065-0385) on the Zn/ZnO-NW substrate. The Au-deposited ZnTe/ZnO-NW (ZOZT–Au) shows a similar XRD pattern to ZOZT due to small amounts and sizes of gold nanoparticles deposited on the substrate. The gold deposition was confirmed by the point energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS), which provides more localized element information on Zn, O, Te and Au as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated metallic Au(Au0), Zn2+ from ZnO-NW and ZnTe, and O2− from ZnO-NW as shown in Fig. 1b–d. Both Te2− from ZnTe and Te4+ from TeO2 were observed due to superficial oxidation by exposure to air.19

The Fig. S3 of ESI† shows the SEM image of the early stage of ZnTe formation process where ZnTe blocks cover only the top of ZnO nanowires.

Also, the cross-sectional image of ZnTe/ZnO-NWs at the edge of substrate (Fig. 2e) reveals the tulip-like morphology schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a. The surface of ZnTe is covered with Au nanoparticles of 2–5 nm size after Au e-beam evaporation in Fig. 1f (ZOZT–Au). The size distribution of deposited Au nanoparticles is presented in Fig. S4 of ESI.†Fig. 2g shows a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of the ZnTe grain and Au particles on the area marked in Fig. 2d. A lattice spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the distance of the (111) lattice planes of zinc-blende ZnTe crystals.20 In addition, Au nanoparticles show the (111) lattice plane with a lattice spacing of 0.288 nm.21,22 As mentioned, Au nanoparticles deposit on the surface of single crystalline ZnTe/ZnO-NW composites.
The mechanism of ZnTe/ZnO-NW composite formation involves dissolution–recrystallization.14,23,24 In hydrazine-containing alkaline solution, the Zn(OH)42− ion is formed locally on the surface of ZnO-NW by reaction with hydroxyl anions (reaction (1)). ZnOsurface + H2O + 2OH− → Zn(OH)42−(1) Simultaneously, highly active Te2− ions are released by hydrazine-assisted reduction of tellurite (TeO32−) ions through the formation of the reduced form, Te, as temperature increased (reaction (2) and (3)). TeO32− + N2H4 → Te + N2 + H2O + 2OH−(2) 3Te + 6OH− → 2Te2− + TeO32− + 3H2O(3) Then the Te2− ions react with Zn(OH)42− to form ZnTe crystals on ZnO-NWs by heterogeneous nucleation and growth.25 Te2− + Zn(OH)42− → ZnTe + 4OH−(4) The time course of the ZnTe crystal formation was followed by SEM analyses as shown in Fig. S3 of ESI.† As the reaction proceeds, the size and number of ZnTe crystals increase, which grow on the top of ZnO-NWs. The observation indicates that the larger ZnTe crystals grow upon sacrificing the smaller ZnTe via the typical Ostwald ripening with secondary nucleation and growth.23
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) in Fig. 3a reveal significant differences in the absorption properties. ZO shows a strong absorption in the UV light region characteristic of the wide band gap ZnO with white colour. However, ZOZT and ZOZT–Au show dramatically shifted absorption into the visible light region (<550 nm). The optical band gap energies of ZO, ZOZT, and ZOZT–Au composites were estimated from the Tauc plots in Fig. S5 (ESI†): αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2 where α, hν, A, and Eg are an absorption coefficient, the photon energy, a proportional constant and the optical band gap energy, respectively. The obtained optical band gap energy of ZOZT was ∼2.25 eV in agreement with the values reported for ZnTe in the literature (2.1–2.26 eV).26 The optical properties of ZOZT and ZOZT–Au are very similar, i.e. reddish reflecting colour, light absorption spectra and Tauc plots. The light absorption of ZOZT–Au is lower than that of ZOZT due to reduced light penetration in the presence of Au particles. ZnTe/ZnO-NW-Au with larger Au particle sizes around 5–10 nm formed by heavier Au loadings shows further reduced light absorption in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2
Both bare and Au-decorated ZnTe/ZnO-NWs were employed as a photocathode for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction with a Pt mesh as an anode under irradiation of simulated AM 1.5G (1 sun) solar light in a typical three-electrode photoelectrochemical system schematically shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All the measurements were evaluated under chopped irradiation, so the dark and light current–voltage could be monitored simultaneously. The photocathodes were scanned only below 0.3 VRHE because no cathodic photocurrents were generated above it. The size of Au nanoparticles was controlled by the deposition time and an optimized sample had 2–5 nm Au nanoparticles as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3b, the photocurrent of the Au coupled ZnTe/ZnO-NW (−3.14 mA cm−2) was ca. 1.5 times as high as that of the bare ZnTe/ZnO-NW electrode (−2.12 mA cm−2) at −0.11 VRHE (the theoretical potential necessary for CO production from CO2). The photoactivity of ZOZT–Au at −0.11 VRHE is compared favourably with other photocathodes reported in the literature including Au/pSi (−1.87 mA cm−2), Cu/pSi (ca. 1 mA cm−2), and Sn/pSi (ca. −0.5 mA cm−2).4,7,27 At −0.5 VRHE (390 mV overpotential), ZOZT–Au recorded a drastically enhanced photocurrent of −13.4 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the photocurrent of bare ZOZT was −5.6 mA cm−2 at the same applied potential. For comparison, the ZnO and Au coupled ZnO electrodes were applied to photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction, which showed negligible performance due to the n-type semiconductor properties of ZnO (Fig. S8, ESI†).14 The result demonstrates that the observed photocatalytic performances of ZnTe/ZnO are originated mainly from ZnTe. In addition, ZnTe and Au coupled ZnTe photocathodes fabricated without ZnO by the chemical bath deposition method were also tested for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). They showed a significant CO2 reduction activity but their activity and faradaic efficiency were much lower than those of ZnTe/ZnO or Au coupled ZnTe/ZnO. The results indicate that the role of ZnO is not limited to a sacrificial material to form ZnTe, but serves as a charge transport medium to reduce the generated charge recombination and enhance photocatalytic performances.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in Fig. 3c represents the photocathodic response as a function of incident light wavelength: IPCE = [J × 1240]/[Pmonoλ] where J = photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Pmono = light power density (mW cm−2) at λ, and λ = wavelength of incident light (nm). The photocathodes were held at −0.7 VRHE under irradiation using a 300W Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator. Both photocathodes show the onset of IPCE around 550 nm as expected from the band gap of ZnTe, ∼2.25 eV. The IPCE of photocathodes followed the UV-vis DRS pretty well, implying that the generated photocurrents by CO2 reduction were derived from the absorbed light at different wavelengths. The Au coupled ZnTe/ZnO-NW composite marked higher IPCE values compared the bare electrode over all wavelengths, indicating that the photogenerated charge transfer and its separation in ZOZT–Au was better than that in ZOZT as discussed below. The maximum IPCE value of the ZOZT–Au photocathode was >97%, whereas the bare ZOZT photocathode recorded 68% in the range of 350–550 nm. The relative values of IPCE for both photocathodes are consistent with the photocurrent results in Fig. 3b.
To elucidate the origin of the different photoelectrochemical responses of ZOZT–Au and ZOZT, we performed potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at −0.7 VRHE under the 1 sun condition. The Nyquist plots of both photocathodes are presented in Fig. 3d. The data were fitted to a simple equivalent circuit model of two RC circuits made of resistance (R) and constant phase element (CPE) in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The RC circuit represents an interface between the electrode and the electrolyte (R2/CPE2) and the electron pathway within the bulk of the electrode (R1/CPE1). The Rs represents sheet resistance in a half cell test system.28,29 In general, the largest resistance in the RC circuit is observed at the electrode/electrolyte interface (R2/CPE2) due to the large charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance. For the ZOZT–Au photocathode, R2 was reduced by ∼2.7 times and CPE2 increases by 2.8 times relative to the bare ZOZT photocathode, indicating that CO2 reduction occurred more efficiently mainly by improved charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. In contrast, the R1/CPE1 circuit did not show any significant difference indicating that Au modification did not influence the bulk properties of the electrodes.
Let us consider then how Au brings such a remarkable improvement in photoresponse of CO2 reduction. A possibility to consider is the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) by Au particles, which gives rise to a sharp and intense absorption band in the visible range because of a collective resonant oscillation of the free electrons of the conduction band of the metal.30 However, UV-vis absorption and IPCE spectra in Fig. 3a and c do not show any sign of SPR. The absence of the SPR effect is believed to be due to the small sizes of our Au particles (2–5 nm) because the strong SPR effect by Au nanoparticles is usually observed for larger Au particles of 5–20 nm.30–33 Instead, the primary role of Au seems to modify the band profile of ZnTe by forming a metal–semiconductor junction. ZnTe with gold forms a Schottky junction because of a smaller work function of Au (5.1–5.3) than that of p-type ZnTe (5.79).34–37 The Schottky junction causes enhanced band bending of ZnTe into electrolytes; thus photo-generated holes easily migrate into the inside of the electrode and electrons come out to the surface and are transferred through Au into the electron acceptor (CO2 or H+) in the electrolyte for the reaction as illustrated in Fig. S12 (ESI†). This enhanced charge separation leads to the high photoelectrochemical activity. The effect of band bending modulation is limited to a region of the direct metal–semiconductor contact. But if the area of the contact is too large by heavy loading, it would block a part of light absorption. Thus, an optimal Au loading that gave the best photoelectrochemical performance was determined to be ca. 0.5 wt%, which formed 2–5 nm Au particles as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The loaded amount of Au on ZnTe/ZnO-NW was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).
Another critical role of Au was the selectivity of the CO2 reduction products. A variety of products are expected from CO2 reduction such as H2, CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and so on, due to their similar redox potentials. Deposition of Au nanoparticles improved the selectivity of CO production with negligible other carbon-containing products. Thus photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction was carried out in the KHCO3 electrolyte at −0.7, −0.5, −0.3 and −0.1 VRHE for 3 h as presented in Fig. 4. The amounts of generated CO and H2, their faradaic efficiencies, and selectivity of CO are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 1. The amounts of formed CO increased with the increase of biased potential. In particular, Au loading on ZOZT increased the production of CO by a factor of >10 and reduced the faradaic efficiency of H2 to less than a half.

Thus, the faradaic efficiency of CO production was enhanced to 26.0–63.0% compared with that of bare ZOZT (0–7.2%) as shown in Table 1. Bare ZOZT is mainly a water reduction (to H2) photocatalyst, which converts into a CO2 reduction (to CO) photocatalyst by incorporating Au as a co-catalyst. Au metal favours initial reduction from adsorbed CO2 into the CO2˙−(ads), which is an activated form of CO2 reduction with the carbon atom bonded to the surface Au atom.11–13,16,38 Then the proton in the electrolyte reacts with the oxygen atom in the activated CO2˙−(ads) to form HOCO(ads), which is then reduced to OH and CO(ads) by the transferred photogenerated electron.38 The CO is easily desorbed from the surface of Au.16 The facile adsorption of CO2˙− effectively suppresses the H+ adsorption and direct reduction to H2.
As shown by chronoamperometry in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the photocurrent generation by CO2 reduction was quite stable at least for 180 min of the test. Also, the morphology of ZnTe crystals was almost preserved during the chronoamperometry test at −0.7 VRHE although some Au nanoparticles were aggregated and detached from ZnTe like shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). ZOZT–Au showed higher combined faradaic efficiencies than those of bare ZOZT in Table 1. The combined faradaic efficiencies of ZOZT–Au were higher than 90% at high potentials, but were still lower than 100%. Since no other products were detected by GC-FID and HPLC analyses of reaction solution and there were small dark currents observed in Fig. 3b, we concluded that aggregation, detachment of Au nanoparticles from ZOZT and non-negligible electrochemical corrosion of ZnO and ZnTe took place due to, for instance, ZnO and ZnTe decomposition into Zn, H2O and Te2−.14,39,40 The stability could be further improved by combining with a protective surface layer or a more active electrocatalyst.27
Conclusions
An Au nanoparticle-coupled ZnTe/ZnO array is an attractive photocathode to convert CO2 selectively to CO. Its photocurrent (−15.97 mA cm−2) and IPCE value (97%) at −0.7 VRHE under simulated 1 sun illumination represent the highest among the reported ZnTe photocathodes for CO2 reduction and dramatic enhancement from those of the bare ZnTe/ZnO electrode (−7.89 mA cm−2, 68%). Interestingly, the Au nanoparticles convert mainly-hydrogen-producing ZnTe/ZnO into mainly-CO-producing photocathodes in photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction by greatly enhancing CO selectivity. The obtained Au coupled ZnTe/ZnO-NW exhibited at least two attributes highly desirable for efficient photoelectrodes with selective CO production: (i) the formation of a Schottky junction at the interface between Au particles and ZnTe that allows improved band bending, facile charge separation and electron transfer into electrolytes. (ii) The deposited Au nanoparticles provide reaction centres of CO2 reduction suppressing competing water reduction. There is a scope for improvement in electrochemical stability by combining with a protective surface layer or a more active electrocatalyst.

Broader context
Carbon dioxide (CO2) reutilization has been attracting great global attention in recent years to capture the most important greenhouse gas and to convert it into valuable chemicals and fuels. Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction using abundant solar light and water is an ideal path to CO2 reutilization because of cleanness and sustainability of the technology. Unfortunately, however, there are a number of technical barriers to overcome before the practical applications including the low solar energy conversion efficiency of the photoelectrodes and the low selectivity of the CO2-reducing electrocatalyst to a desired product molecule. The Au coupled ZnO/ZnTe composite photocathode reported here demonstrates excellent efficiency and high selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO. In particular, Au nanoparticles improve photogenerated carrier separation by Schottky junction formation and promote selective CO production suppressing competing water reduction to H2.
