    , Accepted 16th April 2018First published on 18th April 2018AbstractA highly efficient Ni–Mo bimetallic catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction can be obtained from a molybdate incorporated Ni-MOF by thermal decomposition in NH3. The catalyst is composed of crystalline Ni nanoparticles doped with amorphous low valence Mo oxide encapsulated in thin N-doped carbon layers, showing excellent HER performance, featuring a very low overpotential for the HER (η20 = 58 mV), low Tafel slope (57 mV dec−1) and excellent long term stability. The catalyst apparently outperforms N-doped carbon encapsulated Ni catalysts without Mo doping, emphasizing the critical synergetic effect of Mo doping and the surface N-doped carbon thin layer on promoting the performance of Ni based HER catalysts.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting is a practical method to achieve sustainable mass production of high-purity hydrogen. The combination of wind power or photovoltaics, electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel cells will establish a distributed renewable power source truly independent of grids.1–5 Conventionally, noble metals, especially platinum, are considered to be the most efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), featuring low overpotential and high activity. However, the low abundance in earth and high cost of Pt limit its capability for large-scale water splitting and increases the cost of hydrogen fuel. Therefore, an effective noble-metal-free electrocatalyst is required to promote the commercialization of electrochemical hydrogen production.6–9
Nickel–molybdenum based materials are a promising cathode candidate for hydrogen evolution in basic electrolyzers.10,11 Among a large variety of non-noble metal bimetallic HER catalysts investigated in previous studies, Ni–Mo alloys exhibited the lowest overpotential.12,13 The performance and stability of Ni–Mo catalysts can be further improved by proper design of the nanostructure and non-metal element (typically N and/or C) incorporation. Successful examples include, but are not limited to, Ni–Mo nanopowders obtained by thermal reduction of ammonium nickel molybdate,14,15 Ni–MoCx composites,16,17 MoP/Ni2P composites,18 Ni rich Ni–Mo–N19,20 and Ni–Mo–C catalysts21 reported in our previous work.
Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are gaining increasing interest as precursors to prepare electrocatalysts by thermal decomposition. The highly ordered 3D framework structures and well-defined coordination environment in MOFs are highly promising for controlling the structure, particularly metal dispersion, of the derived catalysts.22–27 When MOFs are heated to high temperature, the metal centers will turn into metal nanocrystals, while the organic ligands either escape or are decomposed into carbon, often with various dopants. Tremendous efforts are being made to further develop this strategy to improve the performance of MOF-derived catalysts, including properly choosing the metal–ligand combination, controlling the size/morphology of the MOF particles and understanding the decomposition mechanism.28,29
Ni–Mo based HER catalysts are a successful example of bimetallic alloy based catalysts. In many application fields, bimetallic catalysts often exhibit drastically improved performance compared to the individual components due to their modulated electronic band structure. For transition metals with the same oxidation number and similar coordination chemistry, bimetallic MOFs can be formed, which can be used to prepare bimetallic catalysts though the same thermal decomposition process. However, this strategy is difficult to apply to Ni–Mo catalysts due to their significantly different oxidation number and coordination chemistry. The most common oxidation number of Mo is +6, which often appears as molybdates instead of coordination compounds or MOFs.
Motivated by the fact that polymolybdate anions can be fitted into the voids of the typical MOF structure in terms of their size, we synthesize a molybdate incorporated Ni-MOF and convert it into a highly efficient Ni–Mo based HER catalyst through thermal decomposition. The incorporated Mo, despite its low content, significantly improves the HER performance. A very low overpotential of only 58 mV at 20 mA cm−2 with long term stability is achieved, showing promising application as a low cost, high performance HER catalyst for sustainable H2 production.
Results and discussion
We start from a well-known Ni-MOF, Ni3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenecarboxylic acid) with a cage structure, which can be easily synthesized by a solvothermal method from Ni(NO3)2 and H3BTC in dimethylformamide. To obtain the molybdate incorporated Ni-MOF (MoOx@Ni-MOF), MoCl5 is added as the Mo precursor during the preparation of the Ni-MOF. All the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of MoOx@Ni-MOF match well with those of the pure Ni3(BTC)2 sample (both experimental and simulated).30,31 There are no peaks corresponding to crystalline Mo species. As shown by the SEM images (Fig. 1c and d), the Ni-MOF is composed of needle-like crystals of 20–50 μm length and 1–2 μm diameter, while the MoOx@Ni-MOF is composed of a nanorod structure with a much lower aspect ratio. The different morphology is attributed to the higher acidity in the growth of the MoOx@Ni-MOF due to the hydrolysis of MoCl5. The nitrogen sorption isotherms suggest that the MoOx@Ni-MOF shows a smaller BET specific surface area and pore volume compared to the pristine Ni-MOF (shown in Fig. S1†). In the XPS spectra of the MoOx@Ni-MOF sample, peaks at 856.0 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 region, 233.0 eV in the Mo 3d3/2 region, and 236.1 eV in the Mo 3d5/2 region can be readily detected, which suggests that only Ni(II) existed in the MOF structure, and Mo exists in the high oxidation number from Mo(IV) to Mo(VI).32
 Fig. 1  (a) The synthesis process and schematic illustration and (b) XRD patterns of the structure of the MoOx@Ni-MOF sample, SEM images of (c) Ni-MOF and (d) MoOx@Ni-MOF samples, (e and f) the corresponding EDS mapping and (g and h) Ni 2p3/2 and Mo 3d XPS spectra of the MoOx@Ni-MOF sample. The baseline in XPS spectra has been corrected. 
The above structural characterization strongly suggests that in the MoOx@Ni-MOF sample, Mo is in the molybdate state which is encapsulated in the pores of the Ni-MOF. Although it was reported that Mo can also form the MOF Mo3(BTC)2 which is isostructural with Ni3(BTC)2, the possibility of Mo substitution for Ni as the metal center in the MOF is ruled out here as the oxidation state of Mo is too high. The preparation of Mo3(BTC)2 requires Mo precursors with a low oxidation state, such as Mo(CO)6.30,33 In fact, when the solvothermal reaction is carried out with only MoCl5 and H3BTC in DMF at 130 °C, Mo3(BTC)2 could not be obtained, which indicates that the condition to prepare Ni3(BTC)2 is incompatible to form the corresponding Mo isostructure.31,34
ICP-OES measurements show that the Ni/Mo ratio in the MoOx@Ni-MOF is 4:96, 6:94 and 8:92 when the Mo/Ni molar ratio is 1:4, 1:3 and 1:2 in the starting material. The much lower Mo incorporation ratio again indicates a molybdate encapsulation mechanism rather than the Mo substitution mechanism. However, if a higher amount of Mo is added to the solution before the solvothermal reaction, the MOFs will not be precipitated, which may be caused by the excessively produced H+ from the hydrolysis of MoCl5. However, the quantitative analysis of the peak area in full-range XPS spectra (shown in Fig. S2†) shows that the Mo:Ni molar ratio on the surface of the MoOx@Ni-MOF is 2:5 while it is 6:94 as measured by the ICP-OES method, confirming the enrichment of the adsorbed MoOx. Meanwhile, the elemental mapping from EDS in SEM images also indicates that the amorphous MoOx disperses homogenously on the nanocrystalline Ni-MOFs.
The NiMo–C and Ni–C catalysts are obtained by heating the MoOx@Ni-MOF (Mo:Ni molar ratio of 6:94) and Ni-MOF at 450 °C under a NH3:Ar = 1:5 (v/v) atmosphere respectively. In the obtained catalyst the Mo:Ni molar ratio is equal to that of the MoOx@Ni-MOF precursor, since the Ni and Mo species will not escape during the decomposition process. Moreover, the carbon content is very low (less than 3.2 wt%), which is mainly attributed to the chemical induced decomposition effect induced by NH3, as shown in our previous study.28,35 N doping is also observed, which is 1.0 wt% and 1.2 wt% in the NiMo–C and Ni–C samples, respectively. The N doping must be from the interaction with NH3 during the thermal decomposition process.
The XRD pattern (Fig. 2a) of the NiMo–C sample only shows diffraction peaks corresponding to cubic metallic Ni without crystalline Mo related species, which is similar to that of the Ni–C sample without Mo. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2b) suggest that the NiMo–C sample is composed of metallic nanoparticles with the diameter less than 10 nm. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2c) show the (111) lattice planes of fcc Ni (a fringe interspace 0.204 nm) with amorphous carbon coating on the surface of the Ni nanoparticles. Crystalline Mo is still absent, which is in good accordance with the XRD results. EDS mapping (Fig. 2d–g) shows a very homogeneous distribution of Ni and Mo. The XPS composition analysis suggests that the Mo/Ni molar ratio is much higher on the surface (1:3.2, Fig. S3†), the same as that for the MoOx@Ni-MOF, indicating that there is no significant diffusion of the metal species during the thermal decomposition of the MoOx@Ni-MOF. The surface enrichment of Mo may have resulted by the automatic phase segregation. In such a composite nanostructure with Mo modification, it is thermodynamically more stable if the metallic Ni and the MoOx phases are well separated rather than homogeneously mixed to minimize the interface energy. Therefore, it is energetically more favorable to form a solid metallic Ni phase and the amorphous MoOx phase tends to be separated and enriched in the surface region. The high resolution XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2h–j. In the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum, the peak at 852.3 ± 0.2 eV corresponds to metallic Ni, while the peak at 855.5 ± 0.2 eV corresponds to Ni(II). In the Mo 3d spectrum of the sample, there are peaks at 228.9 eV and 235.6 eV which could correspond to the existence of Mo(II) and Mo(VI),25,26 which are reduced compared to those in MoOx@Ni-MOF. It should be noted that NH3 is necessary for the reduction of Mo. Thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere will result in the formation of the NiMoO4 phase, as indicated by XRD (Fig. S4†). N doping is another important effect of NH3. In the N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2i), the peaks at 398.3 and 400.3 eV could be assigned to the pyrindinic and pyrrolic states of N. The nitride related peak (∼397 eV) is not detected, indicating that most N is doped into the carbon layer.

The HER activity of the NiMo–C catalyst in 1 M KOH is first evaluated by using the linear polarization curves, which is shown in Fig. 3a. The overpotential at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (η20) is used as a figure of merit. The NiMo–C catalyst exhibits a very low η20 of only 58 mV. The catalyst derived from the same Ni-MOF but without MoOx encapsulation (Ni–C) is used for comparison, which shows a much higher η20 of 111 mV. In addition to the low overpotential, the NiMo–C catalyst also shows a low Tafel slope of only 57 mV per decade, suggesting that the mechanism of the HER here is determined by not only the discharge step of H2O (Volmer step), but also the desorption step of the H atom on the surface of the electrode.36–38 On the other hand, the Ni–C catalyst shows a much higher Tafel slope (104 mV dec−1). The lower Tafel slope implies the lower electrochemical polarization during the HER process, particularly at high current density.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which is proportional to the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl), is also measured for the two catalysts using the CV method (Fig. 3c and S5†).39–41 The measured Cdl is 11.2 mF and 7.8 mF for NiMo–C and Ni–C, respectively. Despite the similar particle size and physical surface area obtained from the BET method (Fig. S6†), the ECSA value of the NiMo-catalyst is also increased compared to that of the Ni–C catalyst, indicating that additional electrochemically active sites are created with the addition of Mo.
The significantly improved HER performance can also be implied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The semicircle observed in the Nyquist plot (in Fig. 3d) of both Ni–C and NiMo–C are fitted using an equivalent circuit composed of a parallel combination of a charge transfer resistance and a constant phase element (CPE) to simulate the interfacial electrochemical double layer.37,42 The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is mainly determined by the diameter of the half circle, which is found to be only 77 Ω for NiMo–C, while as large as 169 Ω for Ni–C, indicating a much faster electron transfer process on the NiMo–C catalyst.
The Mo/Ni ratio and thermal decomposition process is optimized to give the best HER activity. As the Mo species in the MoOx@Ni-MOF is introduced by encapsulated molybdate in the pores of the Ni-MOF, the Mo/Ni atomic ratio in the MoOx@Ni-MOF and also the NiMo–C is limited to 8/92. However, even with such a narrow composition region, an optimal Ni/Mo ratio (94/6 in NiMo–C, also denoted as NiMo(94/6)–C) is observed. A deviation from the optimal Mo/Ni ratio results in a higher η20 value (Fig. 4a) and Tafel slope (Fig. 4b). The thermal decomposition temperature to convert the MoOx@Ni-MOF to NiMo–C also plays a critical role in the HER activity. As shown by the LSV curves in Fig. 4d, the catalyst obtained at lower thermal decomposition temperature (350 °C) shows higher overpotential (η20 = 105 mV), mainly due to the incomplete decomposition and carbonization of MOFs, which can be observed in the TEM images in Fig. S7.† However, higher decomposition temperature will result in even more rapid degradation of the HER performance (η20 = 220 mV at 550 °C and 303 mV at 650 °C), which is mainly due to the over-etching of the surface N-doped carbon layer and aggregation of the particles also concluded from the TEM images in Fig. S7.† Moreover, thermal decomposition in Ar results in a very inactive catalyst (Fig. S8†), as Mo cannot be reduced in this case. It should also be noted that here the MOF-derived NiMo–C catalyst exhibits higher performance under alkaline conditions than in acid, while it shows an η20 value of 135 mV and a Tafel slope of 104 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (shown in Fig. S9†).

(d) Linear polarization curves in 1 M KOH of the NiMo–C heated at different temperatures. 
The NiMo–C catalyst also exhibits good stability. The potential of the NiMo–C electrode remains stable in continuous electrolysis at 20 mA cm−2 for 12 hours (Fig. 5a). Another linear sweep voltammogram after repeated CV cycles is taken and in this test there is almost no change for the LSV curve (in Fig. 5b) and η20 value (in Fig. 5c). Also, the good stability can be maintained even at much higher current density, as shown by the stable potential in the galvanostatic tests with increasing current density at a stepping of 20 mA cm−2 to 120 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). The structural characterization of the NiMo–C catalyst after the galvanostatic test (shown in Fig. S10†) shows that there is no apparent change in terms of phase composition and morphology, while the incorporated Mo has not been contaminated or oxidized.

(d) Time dependent potential profile at different current densities up to 120 mA cm−2. The noise at high current density is due to the perturbation of the H2 bubbles. 
The HER activity of the NiMo–C (Ni/Mo = 94/6) catalyst is very close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst with 20 wt% Pt loading in terms of the overpotential and Tafel slope, as compared in Fig. 3a and b. The activity is superior compared to most non-Pt HER catalysts reported in recent literature, as compared in Table S1.† It is worth noting that both Mo doping15,16,19,21,43 and encapsulation in the N-doped thin carbon layer25,44,45 have been demonstrated to be very effective to promote the HER performance of Ni, which can be attributed to the synergism of MoOx and Ni particles encapsulated in N-doped carbon (Ni@N–C). The latter has been demonstrated to exhibit high HER activity due to the modulation of H adsorption energy by the thin carbon coating layer.13,25 Indeed, the activity (in terms of overpotential and the Tafel slope) of the NiMo–C catalyst is superior compared to Ni28,29 and Ni–Co36 alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in a thin layer of N-doped carbon as well as most Ni based HER catalysts doped by Mo species but without the coating of the N-doped carbon layer.14,20,43 Thus, the excellent HER performance originates from the combined effect of Mo-doping and encapsulation by the thin N-doped carbon layer. Particularly, the thermal decomposition of molybdate incorporated Ni-MOFs in NH3 reported in this work is a very effective method to synthetically achieve such synergism.
The NiMo–C catalyst is further tested in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer driven by a solar cell. The OER catalyst is NiFe nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon (NiFe@N–C) previously developed by our group,29 which shows an η10 value of 300 mV and 100% Faraday efficiency for the OER (see the OER polarization curve in Fig. 6b). Both the HER and OER catalysts are loaded on Ni foam at a loading of 2 mg cm−2. The polarization curve of this combined two-electrode system is shown in Fig. 6b and the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of only 380 mV, slightly higher than the sum of that of the OER (300 mV) and the HER (40 mV). The additional potential loss is attributed to the internal resistance (iR drop) of the electrolysis cell. The current density of this system could also be kept stable under a voltage of 1.6 V for more than 15 h, as shown in Fig. 6c. For the measurement of the Faraday efficiency, H2 evolved in galvanostatic electrolysis at a current of 40 mA for 5.5 h is quantified using a gas burette. The amount of collected gas (4.0 mmol) is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value (4.1 mmol) according to Faraday's law, indicating 98% faradaic efficiency of the HER process.

(e) Evaluation of the energy loss of each part of the electrolyzer corresponding to (b). 
The electrolysis cell can be driven using a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell to establish a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) system. The circuit is shown Fig. 6a. Under a natural solar irradiation of 51 mW cm−2, the cell works at a voltage of 1.78 V and a current of 24 mA, corresponding to an overall electrolysis efficiency of 69.1% at a hydrogen production rate of 0.44 mmol h−1 cmelectrode−2. The overall solar-to-hydrogen energy efficiency reaches 7.1% using the commercial polycrystalline solar cell with a conversion efficiency of only 10%. The STH efficiency can easily surpass 10% by simply using a more efficient solar cell, as solar cells with an efficiency of ∼20% are easily available. A detailed split of the energy loss of the electrolyzer indicates that the overpotential of the HER electrode only caused 3.9% loss of the total input power, even lower than that from the iR drop. Therefore, the NiMo–C catalyst can readily replace the Pt based HER catalysts for alkaline electrolysis for H2 production.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we show that a polymolybdate anion can be incorporated into the pores of a Ni-MOF, Ni3(BTC)2, by a one step hydrothermal reaction. The molybdate incorporated Ni-MOF (MoOx@Ni-MOF) can be converted into a highly efficient HER catalyst by thermal decomposition in an NH3 atmosphere. The obtained HER catalyst consists of metallic Ni nanoparticles doped with amorphous low valence Mo oxide encapsulated in thin N-doped carbon layers. Benefiting from the synergism from the multiple components, this catalyst shows excellent HER performance, featuring a very low overpotential for the HER (η20 = 58 mV), low Tafel slope (57 mV dec−1) and excellent long term stability. The NiMo–C catalyst is successfully applied in an efficient solar driven electrolysis system based on non-noble metals, which shows a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7.1% using a commercial polycrystalline solar cell.
Experimental section
Preparation of the Ni-MOF and molybdate incorporated Ni-MOF (MoOx@Ni-MOF)
1,3,5-Benzenedicarboxylic acid (H3BTC, 0.38 g, 1.8 mmol, J&K Chemicals co. ltd.), and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.78 g, 2.7 mmol, Xilong Chemicals co. ltd.) and a certain amount of MoCl5 (Aladdin Chemicals co. ltd.) are dissolved in 50 mL DMF (Xilong Chemicals co. ltd.). The solution is sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 130 °C for 24 h. The obtained green crystalline powders are washed with DMF two times and ethanol another two times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum overnight.
Preparation of HER catalysts
The HER catalysts were prepared by temperature programmed pyrolysis of the Ni-MOFs at different atmospheres. Typically, 0.2 g Ni3(BTC)2 or MoOx@Ni-MOF is loaded into a quartz tube furnace. The system is flushed with Ar for 30 min to remove air. The sample is heated to a certain temperature at 10 °C min−1 in the desired atmosphere, kept at the peak temperature for 1 h, and allowed to cool down to room temperature in pure Ar flow.
Materials characterization
The content of C and N was decided by the combustion method (Vario EL elemental analyzer). The content of Ni is obtained using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) performed on a CCD-ICP-AES spectrometer (PROFILE SPEC). The samples are first calcined in air at 900 °C for 12 h. Then the obtained residue is dissolved in 2 mol L−1 HNO3 to give the solution for ICP-OES analysis. The structure and morphology of the products are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert3 diffractometer, Cu Kα), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, 200 kV). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an AXIS-Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (225 W, 15 mA, 15 kV). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured on a NOVA 2200 gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome) at 77 K. Before testing, the samples were degassed at 130 °C for 12 h. The surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
Electrode preparation
To prepare the working electrode, 8 mg of catalyst powders were ultrasonically dispersed in a mixed solution of 400 μL Nafion (0.5 wt% in ethanol and water) for about 0.5 h. Then, 7 μL suspension was dropped onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 3.0 mm diameter. The catalyst loading is 2 mg cm−2. The electrode is dried for 2 h at room temperature.
To prepare the electrode for continuous water electrolysis, 360 μL suspension is dropped onto a 1.8 × 2.0 cm2 Ni foam substrate. The catalyst loading is 2.0 mg cm−2. The electrode is dried for 2 h at room temperature.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode system controlled by a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation. The working electrode is the catalyst loaded GCE. A clean platinum foil is used as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) is used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was N2 saturated 1 M KOH solution. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a rate of 5 mV s−1 in a range from 0.02 V to −0.4 V (vs. RHE). CV scanning was carried out from −0.4 V to 0.1 V (vs. RHE) at a rate of 100 mV s−1 for 1000 and 2000 cycles in order to test the durability of the catalyst. And electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out under η = 100 mV.
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is proportional to Cdl, which assumes that the measured current in the non-faradaic region iC is due to the charging of the double layer capacitor. Thus, the current iC is proportional to the scan rate v: iC = vCdl. To estimate Cdl, the catalysts are loaded on the GCE using the procedure described above. CV measurements with different scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 are carried out in the potential region from 0.02 to 0.12 V vs. RHE (the non-faradaic region).
Preparation of OER catalysts
The precursor of the NiFe-based OER catalyst is FeNi-substituted ZIF-8, which is synthesized from the mixture of 2-methylimidazole (Hmim, 40 mmol) and mixed metal acetates (3 mmol ferrous acetate, 1 mmol nickel acetate and 6 mmol zinc acetate) in oxygen-free methanol solution at room temperature. After washing and drying FeNi-substituted ZIF-8 as the deposit, the precursor is heated to 1000 °C at 10 °C min−1 and kept for 1 hour under a pure Ar atmosphere to obtain the NiFe-based OER catalyst.
Solar-driven water electrolysis
Solar water electrolysis was performed on a home designed electrolyzer with 1 M KOH solution as the electrolyte, while the power source is a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell (5.5 × 5.5 cm2). Both the NiMo-based HER catalyst and NiFe-based OER catalyst were loaded on 1.8 × 2.0 cm2 Ni foam with a loading of 2 mg cm−2. And the two electrodes were separated by a polypropylene membrane. The irradiation on solar cell from while the power is measured by a solar radiometer (Photoelectric Instrument of Beijing Normal University). To record the time dependent potential of the working electrode during the chronopotentiometry test, the evolved hydrogen was introduced into the gas burette eudiometer to be quantified.
