    , Accepted 20th April 2022First published on 3rd May 2022AbstractMany applications, including solar energy conversion, can be enhanced by the upconversion of low energy photons. A flexible approach towards achieving this is by sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation, or triplet fusion. Despite high efficiencies being achieved for many compositions in solution, this has not yet been translated to the solid state. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the various approachesto obtain triplet fusion upconversion in solid state and discuss the challenges inherent to its implementation. Finally, we outlay our view on target areas to successfully envision solid state upconversion in the future.
Introduction
Triplet fusion upconversion, also commonly known as triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC), has been developed over the last decade as a promising way to convert low energy photons into those of higher energy. This bi-molecular process of upconverting photon energies was first observed in 1962 by Parker and Hatchard,1,2 and is particularly attractive as it enables light harvesting where the power density is low (<100 mW cm−2) and incoming light is non-coherent. This makes TTA-UC potentially applicable to a broad range of fields, such as solar energy harvesting,3 bio-imaging,4,5 optical microscopy,6,7 photocatalysis8 and many others.9–11 For device applications, it is desirable to achieve efficient upconversion in the solid state. However, much of the earlier work was dedicated to organ(ometall)ic molecules in solution. Solution-based systems have been well investigated and have achieved high upconversion quantum efficiency, even at sub-solar irradiance.3,12–14 The challenges facing solid-state TTA-UC vis-à-vis solution-phase TTA-UC compositions are different, and while some of the problems facing solution TTA-UC disappear when translating into the solid state, some new challenges emerge.
A suitable approach, from both the design and materials perspective, is yet to reveal the full potential promised by upconversion in the solid state. In this perspective, we identify various limitations to solid-state upconversion efficiency and propose strategies to further develop efficient solid-state upconversion systems fit for device implementation.
Progress and challenges
The solution phase
Before discussing the challenges in the solid state, we review the strategies by which highly efficient upconversion is achieved in solution. The general mechanism of solution TTA-UC is illustrated in Fig. 1.15 Initially, a low-energy photon is absorbed by a sensitizer molecule, which is promoted to its first excited singlet state (S1) followed by an intersystem crossing (ISC) to its lowest-energy triplet state (T1). The triplet energy on the sensitizer is then transferred to an annihilator molecule by triplet energy transfer (TET). Annihilator triplet molecules diffuse in solution and upon encountering one another may annihilate to generate two singlets: one in the ground state, S0, and the other in an excited singlet state, generally S1. This excited singlet can emit upconverted fluorescence. Assuming that the sensitizer undergoes near-quantitative ISC and TET, which is usual, the kinetic equation governing the concentration of annihilator triplets is (1)where [S] is the concentration of sensitizer molecules and kϕ is their excitation rate (s−1). The rate constants k1 and k2 are first and second order decay constants of the annihilator triplets. The second-order, bimolecular channel is responsible for generating excited singlets, but may also generate higher-energy annihilator triplets. Under steady-state conditions, if the efficiency is low, k1 ≫ k2[T] and [T] ≈ kϕ[S]/k1. Since the rate of photon upconversion, WUC, depends on the square of the triplet concentration,16 it can be expressed as: (2)where f describes the probability that an annihilation event generates an excited singlet and ΦF is the probability that this singlet will emit a photon.17 As such, it would seem that the desirable characteristics for an efficient upconversion system are: high k2, high f, high ΦF, low k1, high [S] and high kϕ. In the following sections we will discuss these points in turn and how they translate into the solid state. A full discussion of the kinetics of TTA-UC in solution may be found in ref. 16 and 18.

High k2. 
For triplet-state molecules to annihilate in solution, they must encounter one-another. The rate at which this occurs is proportional to the concentration squared, and is limited by diffusion. In typical solvents such as toluene, the diffusion limit is on the order of kd ∼ 1010 M−1 s−1. However, in order to annihilate, the molecules must be oriented favourably and their spins must align to generate a singlet state. Since the probability of generating a singlet randomly from two triplets is just 1/9, typical values of k2 are on the order kd/9, but higher if other spin-channels are open. This treatment of spin is somewhat naïve and ignores the interplay between spin-dipole and exchange coupling at low magnetic fields. However, on moving to the solid state, as is our focus here, it is no longer the molecule that diffuses but a triplet exciton, and the effective value of k2 may be enhanced by orders of magnitude.


High f. 
The quantity f describes the probability that an annihilation event, which destroys a pair of triplets, generates an excited singlet.17 If the exchange coupling exceeds the zero-field splitting of the triplet states of the tumbling chromophore, then it is appropriate to describe a triplet-pair encounter complex as a singlet, triplet or quintet. These are formed in a probability ratio of 1:3:5, with the sum of these integers being 9 (3 × 3). If a molecular state is thermally accessible from the triplet-pair state, then the system may undergo internal conversion to that state. In the case of the singlet, this is desirable. In many cases, there lurks a T2 state in the vicinity of S1 and the triplet channel may be considered resonant. The generated T2 state will undergo rapid internal conversion to T1, resulting in the loss of one triplet.16 The aforementioned considerations generally translate to the solid state. Quantum chemical calculations may aid in the design of chromophores, but it is notable that perylene exhibits f ∼ 1,19 while diphenylanthracene (the drosophila of annihilators), has f ∼ 0.5.20


High ΦF. 
Many chromophores are known to have a fluorescence quantum yield approaching unity in dilute solutions. However, the interaction with other chromophores, such as the sensitizer or another annihilator, can lead to concentration quenching. This is particularly problematic in the solid state as discussed in more detail later in this contribution.


Low k1. 
In order to increase the probability that two triplets will annihilate, they should last as long as possible. From a chromophore perspective, higher-energy triplet states will generally lead to longer lifetimes, following the “energy gap law”.21 However, if low energy upconversion is desired, then the triplets will necessarily be low energy. In this case, avoidance of heavy atoms will ameliorate the risk of inducing intersystem crossing back to the ground state.
The longevity of annihilator triplets is also enhanced by removal of quenching sources. We have shown that high concentrations of sensitizer can lead to reduced triplet lifetimes.22 But the “elephant in the room” is molecular oxygen. Molecular oxygen is an efficient triplet quencher, making it one of the worst enemies of upconversion.23,24 Strategies such as using oxygen scavengers and designing an oxygen-mediated system (e.g. by employing oxygen as an energy transmitter) have been a topic of interest in upconversion systems to circumvent this issue.25,26 Combining oxygen scavenger techniques with encapsulation of the device could be a feasible alternative for the fabrication of solid-state upconverters. Nevertheless, oxygen has been observed to enhance low energy upconversion under certain circumstances.26,27


High [S]. 
Because TTA is a bimolecular process, it proceeds at a faster rate with a higher concentration of triplet-state annihilators. This is partly controlled by the concentration of sensitizer molecules. However, we showed that there is a trade-off between the increased triplet concentration brought about by high sensitizer concentrations, and the shorter triplet lifetimes imparted by collisions between triplet-state annihilators and ground state sensitizers.22 Under one-sun irradiance, the optimum concentration for studied systems was about 1 mM. These considerations generally translate into the solid state, but the homogeneity implied by eqn (2) may not apply.


High kϕ. 
Under solar irradiance, with a given chromophore, the rate of photon absorption is fixed. As such, it is imperative to choose a sensitizer with strong absorption that matches the available light spectrum. Broadband absorption is generally advantageous under solar irradiance,28 and this approach has been adopted by various solid state implementations.


High overall ΦUC. 
All the above considerations are responsible to directly impact the, perhaps, most important parameter: the upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC). The ΦUC is defined by the number of upconverted photons observed per number of photons absorbed by the sensitizer. This parameter could be used to easily compare the performance of different devices if a consensus on the best approach to determine and report such value is reached.17 The architecture of the device and the incident power highly impact the calculated ΦUC, which means that different laboratories will likely report incomparable values.17 Also, fluence affects on perovskite carrier recombination, which ultimately affects the quantum yield of such upconversion devices. Therefore, while often reported, we suggest the reader to consider these values critically.

Threshold excitation light intensity Ith
The threshold excitation intensity or Ith is a parameter often determined in upconversion publications and represents the light intensity that marks the transition between the low and high efficiency regimes.29 Generally, a low Ith is more relevant for a solar upconversion device, since the excitation rate of a sensitizer under the filtered solar spectrum is much lower than achievable with many laboratory light sources.
Assuming that ISC and TET are efficient, and that eqn (1) applies, there are two intensity regimes. Where k1[T] ≫ k2[T]2, then eqn (2) applies and the rate of photon conversion is quadratic in excitation rate kϕ = σI/hν, where σ is the absorption cross section of the sensitizer, I is the (monochromatic) light intensity and hν is the photon energy. Where k1[T] ≪ k2[T]2, eqn (2) is replaced by (3)and the rate of photon upconversion is linear in the excitation rate. The excitation power density that results in k1[T] = k2[T]2, Ith, marks the transition between these regimes and is a useful parameter to compare different upconversion systems.
Beyond molecular sensitizers
TTA-UC using a semiconductor nanocrystal sensitizer was first demonstrated by Bardeen and co-workers,30 who also demonstrated the utility of trapping triplet energy with an organic ligand. The transfer of triplet energy to organic ligands was elegantly studied in-depth by Castellano and co-workers.31–33 The general mechanism for semiconductor nanocrystal sensitization is shown in Fig. 2.

Hybrid systems combining organic molecules and inorganic nanocrystals show several advantages over purely organic systems. The band gap of semiconductor nanocrystals is highly tuneable by the nanocrystal size. The semiconductor nanocrystals can have broadband absorption extending into the infrared region, being then superior to commonly used molecular sensitizers.28,34 While molecules can be engineered to absorb in the infrared, they do so at the expense of triplet lifetime.21,26,35 This characteristic has been clearly demonstrated in a recent review with osmium complexes.36 An IR absorbing (996 nm) osmium complex bears a triplet lifetime of 12 ns in solution, while other osmium-containing structures absorbing around 700 nm had a triplet lifetime in the range of a few microseconds.36 Moreover, the same energy gap law applies for both organic and inorganic materials: both nanocrystals (e.g. PbS(Se) as sensitizers) and organic sensitizers (e.g. PdPc(OBu)8) have a typical triplet lifetime of a few microseconds.37 Importantly, nanocrystal excitons are highly mixed in spin character due to the small electron-exchange coupling compared to most organic molecules.38,39 This means that the excited nanocrystal is simultaneously poised to undergo TET and emission. As such, an energy gradient to the annihilator triplet is required as a driving force for upconversion, and reverse energy transfer from ligands has been observed.33 Different combinations of nanocrystals and organic annihilators provide great flexibility in both absorption and emission spectral ranges. Semiconductor nanocrystal sensitizers have been used to achieve TTA-UC using triplet energies40 and photon energies below the band gap of silicon.27
Tang et al. investigated the relationship between the upconversion quantum yield (QY) and size of nanocrystals. The upconversion QY increased by 700 and 250-fold respectively by decreasing the size from 3.5 to 2.9 nm for PbS and from 3.2 to 2.5 nm for PbSe. The work suggests that a requirement for lead chalcogenide nanocrystal-sensitized upconversion is the use of well-passivated, small lead chalcogenide nanocrystals.41 They also concluded that the energy transfer in the hybrid systems lies in the Marcus normal regime.42 Importantly to note, however, that despite the large increase in the upconversion QY, the overall value was unsatisfactory (ΦUC ≈ 0.01%), suggesting that nanocrystals are still far from being ideal candidates in upconversion devices.
Lead halide perovskites have been implemented as nanocrystal sensitizers. Perovskites are semiconductors that bear similar crystal structure, generally of chemical formula of ABX3, where A is a monovalent organic cation, B is a divalent metal cation and X is a halide ion. Their popularity is notable in the field of solar cells.43
In early work, Kimizuka, Yanai and co-workers implemented surface-modified perovskite nanocrystals to sensitize DPA in solution.44 The triplet energy from the perovskite is transferred to a chromophoric ligand, and then transferred to the free DPA molecules, ultimately undergoing upconversion.
The size-dependent TET from nanocrystals was further explored by Wu and co-workers using CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.45 They demonstrated that quantum confinement is necessary for efficient TET. The TET efficiency is around 99% for highly confined nanocrystals whereas is almost zero for bulk-like particles. The TET rate is linearly dependent on the size-determined carrier probability density at the nanocrystal surface. High carrier probability density has large donor–acceptor wavefunction overlap required for efficient Dexter-type transfer. These studies have provided insights on the mechanisms of the TET between perovskites and some organic ligands. In some hybrid systems, TET is believed to be mediated via charge transfer.32
Designing solid state upconverters
While upconversion in the liquid phase can hardly be considered device-relevant, research has exposed some challenges that cannot be ignored when designing solid-state devices.14,37,46–48
From an energetics point of view, an efficient upconverter should have a large photon energy release in the singlet annihilation channel, low energy losses in intersystem crossing to the triplet state and the triplet annihilation channel should be less thermodynamically favourable than the singlet.49
Molecules known to undergo upconversion are still limited, as evidenced by the few classes commonly seen in publications. For discussions on lanthanide upconversion systems, we redirect the reader elsewhere.50 A comprehensive list of molecules for upconversion is available in a recent review.51 Both sensitizers and annihilators can benefit from design,52 and it should not be neglected that the efficiency of an upconversion composition depends on how these components work together.53 Modification of properties of different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives, molecules commonly used as annihilators, has been achieved.52,54–56 Optimization of the sensitizer structure and orientation leading to better compatibility with the annihilator is also possible.57–60 Such investigations can lead to structures not only bearing higher upconversion efficiencies but also greater oxygen stability.52
To fabricate the best possible upconversion device, besides the issues mentioned above, the concentration (or composition ratio) of the species should be carefully considered since an optimum sensitizer to annihilator ratio will dictate the best performance. While a higher sensitizer concentration is desirable for high efficiency, the triplet lifetime of the annihilator can be quenched with the increased concentration of the sensitizer.22 Inappropriate concentrations can induce excimer formation of the annihilator and quench upconversion.54 Additionally, energy back transfer from annihilator to the sensitizer molecules also is a loss pathway of triplet excitons that otherwise could be utilized in the TTA process.17,61,62 Finally, on the device front, upconversion efficiency can benefit from device engineering.28,63
The need for solid-state upconverters
Despite the above challenges, liquid upconverter systems have achieved respectable efficiencies under solar irradiance.14 So, why throw this away and make things hard for ourselves? The reasons are manifold. Firstly, liquids leak. Liquids transmit hydraulic forces which can rupture the weakest point in an encapsulant when placed under stress. That said, there are numerous examples of stable devices such as LCDs. Secondly, liquids make fabrication difficult, especially where O2-free conditions are required. A solid can be applied as a stable film and will remain in place during the manufacturing process. Thirdly, solvents are volatile and may dissolve adhesives and encapsulants. The former may be mitigated with ionic liquids,64 but the latter remains problematic.
In the following, we review progress towards solid-state upconversion by highlighting several strategies. We draw out the challenges to each approach and then provide our perspective on how these challenges will be addressed in the coming years.
Gel or quasi-solid upconversion
A gel retains its shape and does not flow like a true liquid. But, on the scale of molecules the viscosity is unchanged and as such it should be able to achieve upconversion efficiencies on par with solutions. A pair of publications in 2015 reported on gelated upconverters. The first was a report by Simon et al., who embedded UC chromophores (a palladium derivative and DPA) in a cross-linked polymer.65 There was a small but significant difference in upconversion quantum efficiency in a gelated and in solution samples, which the authors attributed to reduced molecular mobility.65 They evidenced this claim by the observation of full upconversion suppression when the gel was frozen by liquid nitrogen. Photobleaching, attributed to degradation, was also observed. However, the upconversion properties could be fully recovered over time.
Schmidt and co-workers demonstrated equivalent upconversion efficiencies between gelated and non-gelated samples (Fig. 3(a)).66 The gelation process involved heating the upconversion solution to 120 °C with an organogelator to form a homogenous solution in liquid state. Cooling the solution to room temperature induced a fibrillar network formation, transforming the sample into a gel. These fibres contained gaps large enough to confine the solution and allow it to behave as a liquid, therefore, maintaining the liquid properties (Fig. 3(b)).66 Provided the material can withstand the increase in temperature required by the organogelator, this approach is promising to translate properties from liquid to a quasi-solid state. However, one important factor to consider is that, heating is required above the boiling point of many solvents, which ultimately limited the options for the solvent used. In the case in point, the researchers were limited to a higher-viscosity solvent than usually employed, reducing the rate of diffusion and thus k2. Nevertheless, this system was employed in an organic light emitting diode-pumped TTA-UC device, demonstrating its potential.67
 Fig. 3  (a) shows a photograph of a gelated material upconverting green light to blue in an inverted cuvette. The inset is a cross-polarised transmission optical microscope image of the upconverting gel. (b) shows a scanning electron micrograph of the dried gel with cavities larger than 1 μm. The figures are adapted from the ref. 66. 
Optimization of gelated samples for upconversion has motivated research on chemically modified Pt(II) derivatives as sensitizers, targeting the manipulation of the energetic states, as shown in the work by Wu, Yang and co-workers.57 The addition of a diyne functionalized pyrene to the sensitizer could shift the LUMO closer to the acceptor's, ultimately leading to a lower energy loss in comparison with the original structure. Interestingly, replacing the pyrene with an anthracene completely depleted TET to the annihilator and when replaced with perylene, the overall anti-Stokes shift was not as large. However, the drawback of functionalizing molecules is that larger molecules affect the TET quantum yield, since they diffuse slower. A large anti-Stokes shift (1.08 eV) from deep-red to blue was achieved with upconversion quantum yield ΦUC of 21% in solution and 14.8% in air-saturated hydrogels (with the maximum theoretical value of ΦUC = 50%).17 For this system, the upconversion threshold excitation intensity was calculated in 2.8 mW cm−2 at 589 nm excitation and 167.2 mW cm−2 at 635 nm.57
Do gels fulfil the goals of a solid state upconverter? We would say, in part. While they remain in place, and do not flow, they are susceptible to drying out through evaporative loss of solvent. The solvent may thus also dissolve seals, leading to leakage. What is required is a actual solid, such as those architectures found in the following paragraphs.
Polymeric upconversion
TET and TTA in the liquid phase and in some polymer matrices (those that allow migration of molecules) is mediated by molecular diffusion.68,69 Excited annihilators with triplet character diffuse through the matrices and annihilate before the triplet lifetime elapses. However, if the sensitizers and annihilators are immobile, as in the solid state, triplet energy diffusion then depends on the mobility of excitons through molecular sites rather than molecular diffusion (Fig. 4a).

The dark azure dots represent the sensitizers which absorb incoming light (red lines). The photogenerated excitons diffuse through the polymer chains (blue squiggles) and annihilate (yellow star) and emit upconverted light (violet lines); (b) confinement of TTA-UC liquid domains, embedded in a rigid solid matrix. Sensitizers (dark azure dots) and annihilators (light blue ovals) are confined in liquid domains. Brown and grey rods represent a rigid solid matrix; (c) sensitizer-doped molecular crystals. Sensitizers (dark azure dots) are doped in molecular crystals of annihilators (blue ovals); (d) metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs). Sensitizers (khaki dots) and annihilators (blue lines) are arranged in a controlled manner to prevent aggregation; (e) hybrid systems. Brown dots represent colloidal nanocrystal sensitizers and blue ovals represent the deposited layer of molecules for annihilation; (f) semiconductor-mediated upconversion. The exciton transfer takes place as sequential hole and electron transfers. The grey layer represents the semiconductor phase as sensitizers and blue ovals are annihilators deposited on the top. 
At room temperature (T ≫ TT, the transition temperature between the high- and low-temperature regime), the Marcus-type triplet transfer model applies, and the triplet transfer rate is expressed as:70–72 (4)where a is an average distance between neighbouring localized states, L is the effective triplet localization radius, J0 is the electronic coupling, σ is the energetic disorder parameter, Ea is the activation energy which is related to the geometric reorganisation energy λ by Ea = λ/4.
The Marcus-type triplet transfer model suggests that for condensed systems at a constant temperature, the triplet transfer rate is entirely dependent on the degree of energetic disorder (σ) and geometric relaxation (λ). In disordered polymeric matrices where the energetic disorder is large, the mobility of triplet excitons is highly suppressed, thus achieving upconversion requires a careful design. Other solid-state upconversion limitations also apply to polymeric systems such as high-concentration aggregation and phase segregation of sensitizers in the annihilator matrix, both of which generally impedes efficient energy transfer between sensitizers and annihilators.13
Despite the theoretical limitations, however, polymers for upconversion have several advantages that justify the effort. Polymers are easily processable and can be manufactured at a large scale with existing and widely implemented technologies and can be easily integrated with existing devices by coating processes. Additionally, their chemical properties are easily tuneable by different monomers, additives, and synthetic procedures.
Of the few reports on polymeric upconverters, poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), has been a common polymer of choice. PPV is a π-conjugated conducting polymer bearing bright yellow fluorescence around 2.2 eV.73 After the first report of electroluminescence in PPV, this polymer and its derivatives have been incorporated into various optoelectronic devices.73,74 The work done by Partee et al. showed strong evidence for TTA in PPV derivatives and it contributes to around 3% of the total emission.75 Lyskov et al. modelled the TET in the crystalline PPV and they found the triplet mobility is largely anisotropic with respect to the propagation direction.76 The intrachain diffusion constant is around 100 times faster than the interchain due to coherent energy transfer. It is clear from their results, the importance of long-range order for increased triplet mobility. Mori et al. have also investigated PPV derivatives by conjugating an additional chromophore unit, the 9,10-bisphenylethynylanthracene (BPEA) as an annihilator, and used palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrine (TBP) as a sensitizer.77 Their results suggest that the covalently bound BPEA units increase the TET rate in comparison with pure PPV, while also being a source of energy loss due to energy back transfer at a high BPEA ratio.
Gaining insight on the effects of morphology on upconversion aspects of a device is then crucial for advancing polymeric upconverters. Wong and co-workers contributed to this aspect by synthesizing a series of anthracene-PPE copolymers with different aryl spacer units.78 Optimization of the spacer unit allowed the polymer to achieve a maximum upconversion quantum efficiency (ΦUC) of 0.18%. They identified several limitations of conjugated polymers as emitters systems: (1) the TET efficiency between sensitizers and co-polymers is low;79 (2) although adding side-chains increases the PLQY, it also alters the excited states energies of the polymers, which results in poor energy alignment; (3) the triplet-pair formation efficiency is very low due to the structural conformation of the polymers.80
Early investigations on polymeric upconversion were performed by Castellano et al. who fabricated thin films for solid upconversion by embedding DPA and PdOEP on a rubbery polymer host. Such a system required an appropriate composition of the polymer host and the chromophore to allow solid upconversion.81 Subsequent work on a similar system showed that upconversion can be fully suppressed if the temperature is sufficiently low and that the upconversion emission intensity can be reversibly tuned upon temperature change.82 Kimizuka, Yanai and co-workers recently prepared a polymeric thin-film containing DPA as a repeating unit in its backbone in an emitting ionic liquid. The key advantage of implementing an emitting ionic liquid is the ability to have a high concentration of emitters, which the authors demonstrated to significantly affect the quantum yield and efficiency.83 Castellano, Kim and co-workers have also implemented a commercially available polymer precursor to embed a DPA and PdOEP into a polymeric matrix, this time demonstrating upconversion in bulk (Fig. 5a). The polymer could be molded into different shapes with ease and displayed a shift in colour of the emitted light upon change of DPA concentration (Fig. 5b).84

Hagstrom et al. used a solid-state dual-sensitizer PtOEP/PdTPBP system to harvest both red and green wavelengths, thus enhancing the TTA-UC process especially at low-power excitation.85 Polymeric upconversion devices were also envisioned and optimized by Baldo and co-workers who developed a device containing a buffer layer in-between the sensitizer and annihilator layers to minimize back transfer.86 Doping the sensitizer into a host material in a bilayer structure also efficiently suppresses molecular aggregation and back transfer.
Jankus and co-workers doped 4% PdTPBP sensitizer into poly(para-phenylene vinylene) copolymer “super yellow” and reportedly achieved an UC efficiency of 6% in films.87 They found that triplet quenching during the migration in PdTPBP aggregates is severe, accounting for 76–99% of the whole population, and acts as a main loss channel responsible for the low UC efficiency.
Problems with conjugated polymer annihilators remain. The disordered structures lead to trapping of the triplet excitons, and sensitizers may aggregate, leading in some cases to catastrophic loss of excited quanta.87 Ordered structures, such as molecular crystals, would seem to be a solution to this problem.
Using a rigid polymer as a support structure for an essentially liquid upconverter is an attractive proposition (Fig. 4b). Weder, Simon and co-workers proposed the confinement of the sensitizer-annihilator pair within liquid domains, embedded into a rigid solid matrix. They fabricated TTA upconverting nanostructured rigid polymers which co-localize sensitizers and annihilators to a high local density and confine the interacting excited chromophores to enhance the upconversion performance at low power densities.88,89 This strategy warrants further investigation, but cannot be considered true solid state upconversion: it is liquid upconversion in a rigid polymer support. As such, it benefits from attributes of both regimes.
Molecular crystals
Efficient triplet fusion upconversion in condensed systems relies on fast exciton diffusion, making molecular crystals particularly attractive due to their low energetic disorder and thus high triplet diffusivity.90–92 In this strategy, sensitizer molecules are either dispersed in annihilator crystals as dopants (Fig. 4c) or co-crystallized with annihilators, enabling fast ET and efficient TTA.93 A high sensitizer concentration is generally required to increase the cross-section of light absorption, which often results in aggregation and phase segregation in these composite systems while acting as a loss channel of triplet excitons due to limited interactions with annihilators.94 Kamada et al. proposed a rapid-drying nonequilibrium approach to improve the distribution of sensitizers into matrices on the micrometre scale, thus increasing the upconversion efficiency.95 They fabricated binary crystalline solids consisting of PtOEP as the sensitizer and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) or an alkyl-strapped derivative (C7-sDPA) with suppressed segregation.
A major issue with molecular crystals is: Where does the sensitizer go? Co-crystallization of annihilators and sensitizers is difficult and will likely lead to separate crystals. Strategies which start with a sensitizer material in a different phase to the annihilator will be discussed below.
Recently, Murakami et al. have demonstrated a solid upconverter by exploring solid solutions of a highly conjugated anthracene derivative as annihilator and PtOEP as sensitizer.96 With an appropriate composition of both species, this system could form large crystals while avoiding aggregation of the sensitizer. As a result, it had a high UC performance (ΦUC = 16% and Ith of around 0.2 mW cm−2) as well as air stability.96 Alternatively, metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs) can be implemented to arrange the sensitizer and annihilator molecules in a controlled manner to prevent aggregation (Fig. 4d), as demonstrated in the work by Richards, Howard and co-workers.97 They fabricated ordered annihilator–sensitizer heterojunction layers using surface-anchored metal–organic-framework (SURMOF), demonstrating that triplets can be transferred across the heterojunction and undergo TTA. Aggregation-induced emission-type (AIE) molecules were also employed to realize TTA-UC in the crystalline phase without macroscopic segregation of sensitizer molecules, as demonstrated by Yanai, Kimizuka and co-workers.98 Later, they proposed a rational strategy to develop efficient upconverting crystal by employing ionic interactions. They crystallized an anthracene-based ionic annihilator in the presence of anionic sensitizer molecules, resulting in sensitizer molecules spontaneously and homogeneously dispersed in annihilator crystals without aggregation.99 Their work also addressed the effects of defects in sensitized TTA-UC by comparing single crystals with mechanically grounded powder. They found the upconversion efficiency drastically decreases from 6% in crystals to 0.3% in grounded power. The crystal had a threshold excitation intensity of 49 mW cm−2.99 Other works have also explored the influence of defects on exciton dynamics in molecular crystals.100,101
The need for Dexter-type triplet energy transfer from sensitizer to annihilator will necessarily facilitate Förster-type energy transfer back to the sensitizer. This will be a problem in any homogeneous system without implementation of a singlet energy trap to localize fluorescence emission. A possible solution to this problem is an inhomogeneous upconverter where sensitization and annihilation are separated in space. Alternatively, singlet exciton collectors, i.e. highly fluorescent molecules that will collect the energy from the acceptor when in their excited state, has been a promising tool to increase upconversion QY by avoiding FRET back to the sensitizer and increasing the fluorescence quantum yield.102,103
Hybrid systems
A significant step towards hybrid solid-state upconversion (Fig. 4e) was made by Bulović, Bawendi, Baldo and co-workers, who employed lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal nanocrystals as a sensitizer layer. Rubrene was deposited over the nanocrystals as the annihilation phase, doped with dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) as an emitter. As such, this device realized solid-state thin film upconversion of infrared photons (λ > 1 μm) to the visible region (λ = 612 nm).104 Doping 0.5 vol% DBP into thermally evaporated rubrene film (80 nm thickness) to form a host-guest annihilator-emitter layer increases the fluorescence by a factor of 19. Nienhaus et al. further investigated the speed limit for triplet-exciton transfer from colloidal PbS nanocrystals to the triplet state of rubrene.105 They found that by reducing the effective ligand shell thickness from 13 to 6 Å, the triplet transfer rate increases by an order of magnitude, whereas the rate saturates for thickness smaller than 10 Å. They attributed this saturation of the rate of triplet energy transfer to the rapid increase in the medium dielectric constant and thus decreased electronic coupling because of the higher volume proportion of PbS in the monolayer.
Voorhis, Bawendi and co-workers proposed a kinetic model to understand the low internal upconversion efficiency of a PbS nanocrystal and rubrene system. In a monolayer system, the upconversion quantum yield was determined to be ∺3.5% and the TET efficiency was close to unity.105,106 By comparison, when they deposited two PbS layers to increase the absorbed photons by a factor of 2, the upconverted light intensity did not significantly increase. They found two loss channels accounting for this severe reduction in internal quantum efficiency with increasing nanocrystal layer thickness: (1) the inefficient interparticle energy transfer, which means most of the excitons in the second PbS nanocrystal layer cannot transfer to the rubrene via short-range Dexter energy transfer (DET); (2) the fast back transfer of the generated singlet excitons from TTA to PbS nanocrystals via long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Baldo and co-workers further explored the subsolar infrared-to-visible upconversion by integrating the PbS nanocrystals and doped rubrene upconverting layers into a Fabry–Pérot microcavity. At cavity resonance, the threshold excitation intensity reduces by 2 orders of magnitude to a subsolar flux of 13 mW cm−2.107
A promising strategy to increase the upconversion efficiency in hybrid systems is by exploring plasmons. An early report from Ko et al. have explored a device containing a thin layer of PtOEP and DPA surrounding a well-ordered array of silver nanoplates. Additional layers of SiO2, Ag and Si were needed to assist efficient upconversion enhancement.108 Sugawa et al. have also demonstrated the potential of this strategy by evidencing that when the localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance band overlaps with the photoexcitation wavelength, the photoexcitation efficiency increases, ultimately increasing the efficiency of the upconversion emission. A careful design must be followed in such systems as, when the LSP resonance band overlaps with the phosphorescence of the sensitizer instead, the upconversion is quenched.109 Similar strategy has also been explored to improve photocatalysis.110,111
In hybrid systems, size polydispersity of nanocrystals could potentially jeopardise the efficiencies of solid-state upconverters due to interparticle energy transfer to the nanocrystal with the smallest band gap.112 Therefore, anisotropic nanoplatelets which are quantum confined in only one direction aid the polydispersity problem. Generally, nanoplatelets exhibit intrinsically high quantum yields, as well as large oscillator strength, high absorption cross-section and rapid exciton transport in the solid state, making them promising sensitizers for solid state upconversion devices. Nienhaus and co-workers have investigated nanoplatelets-sensitized TTA-UC, obtaining a Ith of 237 mW cm−2.112 Nienhaus et al. also explored one-dimensional quantum-confined sensitizers by using cadmium telluride (CdTe) nanorods as triplet sensitizers for red-to-blue photon upconversion obtaining a Ith of 93 mW cm−2.113
As stated, exciton transfer between layers of nanocrystals is inefficient, possibly further complicated by polydispersity. Yet, a monolayer device has a very low absorbance. To rectify this issue, it was proposed to sensitize upconversion with a bulk semiconductor.
Semiconductor-mediated upconversion
An elegant approach to achieve upconversion employs bulk perovskite to sensitize the annihilator (Fig. 6). Being bulk semiconductors, implementing perovskites instead of or in combination with, for example, nanocrystals, in principle, allows efficient energy transfer to the annihilator after complete absorption of the incident light.
 Fig. 6  Perovskite-sensitized solid-state upconversion in rubrene. 
Nienhaus and co-workers developed a perovskite-nanocrystal-annihilator system as a trilayer device in solid.114 The role of the nanocrystals in this case was not only to transmit the triplet states from the perovskite layer, but also to act as a spin-mixer, i.e., to convert the optically excited singlet excitons into triplet states.
Attempts to simplify the design of the device led Nienhaus and co-workers to remove the nanocrystal layer altogether.115 Now a bilayer device containing a thin film of a bulk lead halide perovskite and a layer of doped rubrene was investigated, resulting in an upconversion threshold intensity of approximately 137 suns when accounting only the range between 770 and 790 nm.115
Singlet fission is a recurrent issue in upconversion systems as it presents a competitive pathway for excited state quenching.116,117 While an emissive dopant is often added to rubrene in order to harvest the singlet state before it undergoes singlet fission, it was recently found to outcompete triplet pair separation, rather than the exciton dimming event leading to the triplet pair.118 Nevertheless, Wieghold et al. showed that singlet fission in solution-processed systems may be suppressed by disorder in the rubrene layer.119
At this point, while a pathway was paved for efficient solid-state perovskite-sensitized upconversion, there is still room for improvement on the fronts of film preparation and material optimization. Production techniques have been found to be key factors such as the solvent used to deposit the annihilator, and thermal annealing.120 Moreover, it was found that thicker perovskite layers combined with longer carrier lifetimes can be beneficial for upconversion.121 The thickness of the perovskite layer plays an important role in perovskite-based upconversion systems due to their inherent trap states, as those have shown to significantly affect the triplet states formation.122 One way to overcome this drawback is by illuminating the device longer to saturate all the traps, which causes the luminescence of the perovskite to last long enough to diffuse more effectively to the rubrene, thus increasing upconversion efficiency.122 Traps can occur not only in bulk perovskite but, perhaps more importantly, at the interface between the perovskite and rubrene layers.123 A full understanding of the photophysical processes occurring at the interface between the perovskite and the annihilator layer is still lacking.124,125 Unexpectedly, Baldo, Bawendi and co-workers have suggested that interfacial traps can be beneficial to upconversion.124 The interfacial traps are responsible for slowing the carrier diffusion, effectively concentrating them at the surface, thus increasing the probability of triplet formation and annihilation.
Since perovskite mediated upconversion is still in its infancy, there are many fronts that require exploration for effectively accessing its capability in becoming a relevant upconverter device. Better understanding its limitations may allow a more conscious design and ultimately lead to the best performing perovskite mediated upconverter in the foreseeable future.
A recent work by Izawa and Hiramoto introduced a new route by utilising charge separation at an organic semiconductor-annihilator interface to achieve relatively efficient solid-state upconversion.126 The sensitizer singlet firstly separates into free charges at the sensitizer/annihilator interface, analogous to the charge separation in organic photovoltaics (OPVs),127 followed by charge recombination to form singlet and triplet charge-transfer (CT) states with population 1:3 due to spin statistics. Afterwards, the energy is transfered from the charge-transfer triplets to the annihilator triplets, which then undergo TTA-UC (Fig. 4f). This strategy does not rely on the ISC of the sensitizer and helps to suppress non-radiative recombination of sensitizer triplets. The authors determined the threshold upconversion intensity of 39 mW cm−2 for their rubrene/ITIC CI/0.5% DBP doping system by using a non-conventional methodology: the intensity at which the upconversion is half of the saturation.
A summary of relevant performance parameters of solid state devices incorporating upconversion can be found in Table 1.

Overcoming upconversion limitations
Solving back transfer: triplet herding
One of the significant hurdles that must be overcome in solid-state upconversion devices based on broadband absorbers and triplet sensitizers is singlet back transfer. A requirement for singlet back transfer is strong absorbance at the upconverted wavelength, a condition which is given in the broadband absorbing inorganic semiconductors, which show increasing optical absorption towards higher energies. In singlet back transfer, the upconverted photons are transferred directly back to the sensitizer through near-field energy transfer or far-field reabsorption, which limits the number of upconverted photons released from a solid-state device.
As shown by Wieghold et al., the fraction of back transfer depends on the location at which upconversion occurs.129 If TTA-UC occurs close to the interface (within a few nanometres), near-field FRET will be a dominant decay pathway of the excited state singlets. Diffusion-mediated TTA further away from the interface yields a lesser fraction of back transfer, since it is based on far-field reabsorption, which is dependent on the optical density of the underlying sensitizer film. Therefore, it has been shown that despite a similar expected underlying TTA-UC efficiency, the observed quantum yield of upconversion is different due to varying amounts of back transfer.
The simplest and most-straightforward approach to mitigating back transfer would be to implement triplet sensitizers that have defined absorption bands which do not overlap with the emission of the annihilator (Fig. 7a). However, to date, broadband absorbing semiconductors have outperformed their molecular counterparts. As predicted via modelling by Frazer et al., the negative effects of reabsorption might be counteracted by the broad range of wavelengths that can be upconverted.28 Hence, based on experimental evidence and supported by modelling, simply using a sensitizer with limited spectral absorption is not the desired path forward. A possibility to overcome the barrier of reabsorption using broadband absorbing triplet sensitizers is the use of trilayer upconversion device structures, where the broadband absorbing sensitizer and annihilator are spatially separated by a triplet transmitter.86 This approach is similar to the transmitter ligand approach broadly utilized in nanocrystal-based TTA-UC in solution.130 In this architecture, the energy of the triplet state in the transmitter layer must be placed such that the triplet energy of the transmitter is in between the sensitizer energy level and the annihilator. In this configuration, initial triplet sensitization to the transmitter layer is favourable, and subsequent TET to the annihilator is also energetically downhill. Due to the longevity of the triplet states and resulting long triplet diffusion lengths, the transmitter layer can be made sufficiently thick to minimize back transfer via FRET. Furthermore, the thickness of the annihilation layer can be optimized to reconcentrate the excitons to optimize TTA. Ultimately, the energy gradient includes an entropy term proportional to the logarithm of the thickness of the layer.
 Fig. 7  Schematics of strategies to improve TTA-UC in the solid state. (a) Solving back transfer: triplet herding. Triplet excitons migrate to an annihilation layer via a transmitter layer. (b) Solving outcoupling. Total internal reflection is mitigated (purple dots) and a back reflector (grey layer) is added. This system must be homogeneously sensitized. (c) Solving the quantum yield problem. Organic crystals (green ovals) are engineered to control the excitonic coupling either with spacer molecules or bulky substituents (blue ovals). (d) Solving triplet-charge annihilation. An electric field confines the carriers to the interfacial region. 
Since emission from a bulk film is generally isotropic, back transfer by far-field reabsorption cannot be avoided with this architecture. However, molecular and photonic engineering can provide a pathway towards increasing the directed emission. As shown by Moth-Poulsen and co-workers, it is possible to arrange the molecular annihilators such that the emission is aligned.131
Solving outcoupling
Outcoupling of emission is a known issue in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite internal quantum efficiencies reaching unity, the external efficiencies are dramatically lower, peaking around 30% for common architectures.132,133 Reflection at dielectric constant mismatched interfaces resulting in waveguiding modes, absorption, and losses to surface plasmon polaritons are some of the most common loss pathways in OLEDs.134–136 Considering that the current perovskite-based upconversion device are essentially OLEDs with a sub-bandgap onset of emission due to TTA-UC, driven by a photovoltaic (PV) where both charges are extracted at the same electrode, the same outcoupling issues present in OLEDs will be found in solid-state TTA-UC. This also raises an interesting aspect regarding the reported UC efficiencies in solid-state: the internal efficiency of the TTA-UC process is likely significantly higher than the reported values, due to outcoupling losses. The outcoupling issue in solid-state upconversion can be addressed in several ways, based in large part on the known approaches in OLEDs, using photonic engineering approaches.
There are several interfaces at which light can be reflected, leading to a reduced emission from the desired device side. The first of which is the glass/air interface. Reflection at planar interfaces due to a dielectric mismatch between the active layer can be avoided by simple engineering approaches. For example, half-sphere lenses can be used to more efficiently outcouple the light than a planar top glass design. However, this non-planar approach is not easily scalable and difficult to implement into sandwiched device architectures as desired for a TTA-UC/PV tandem device. Other approaches including encapsulating coverslips fabricated with microlenses bear more potential in scalability.
Reflection or transmission at interfaces follow Snells law, which dictates the angle of the escape-cone based on the respective dielectric constants. To minimize reflections at the organic/gas interface above the active layer and beneath the encapsulating glass, the organic thin film can be fabricated such that the surface is not smooth, rather is rough on the scale of the wavelength by inclusion of large-scale optically inert scattering centres or the intended fabrication of a rough surface. Under these conditions, less light is subject to reflection at the interface, enabling a higher outcoupling efficiency.
The generation of surface plasmon polaritons at the organic/inorganic interface in solid-state upconversion devices has not yet been demonstrated. However, interfacial effects are not unexpected. To mitigate the possibility of these effects, the previously mentioned triplet transmitter layer can be utilized to funnel the triplet excitons away from the interface, thus reducing the possibility of interfacial loss pathways of the upconverted emission.
Back-reflectors have been successfully implemented in PbS nanocrystal-based and porphyrin–rubrene UC devices, leading to increases in the upconversion emission intensity, as shown by Schmidt's and Baldo's work.63,137 In both cases, the back-reflector increased the effective excitation rate as the transmitted photons could re-enter the solar cell, increasing their path length within the active layer, inducing interference enhancement. In principle, adding a reflective component to the TTA-UC device would predominantly direct the light into one direction, inducing a higher triplet density, which leads to a higher likelihood of bi-molecular processes, such as TTA (Fig. 7b). This behaviour is clearly evidenced by a decrease in the threshold intensity, Ith. Such reflective components can be plasmon-induced metal nanostructures, as demonstrated by Sugawa et al., who improved the upconversion emission in more than 6 times with the addition of a layer of a periodic array of Ag to the TTA-UC film, while decreasing the Ith by 77%.138 TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles were also successfully implemented as back-reflectors.139,140 However, in the case of the broadband absorbing perovskite thin films, the upconverted emission will be strongly filtered by the perovskite, possibly minimizing the benefit of such a reflector.
As mentioned previously, directed emission from the annihilator is one pathway towards minimizing reabsorption losses. This enables the harnessing of the otherwise undesired waveguide modes for the benefit of outcoupling. If the directed emission can be efficiently directed into waveguide modes in the encapsulating glass layer, the waveguide can be used to harvest and concentrate the upconverted light and direct it to a PV or sensor.
It should not be ignored that some solar cell materials, such as silicon, have very high dielectric constants. As such, the evanescent wave of the silicon slab can effectively harvest the upconverted photons. Furthermore, in the case of direct band gap materials, the upconverted state might transfer directly to the photovoltaic medium by Förster energy transfer.
Solving the quantum yield problem
Many dyes are known to undergo a catastrophic reduction in fluorescence quantum yield upon transition from dilute solution to the solid state. In most cases this is put down to “aggregation induced quenching”, a name which reveals nothing of the mechanism. Certainly, one channel which opens up upon crystallization or aggregation is singlet fission. For TTA that is endergonic or only mildly exergonic, singlet fission will be a thermally accessible channel.
Maybe all is not lost. The rate of TTA in a triplet pair that has singlet character needs to only exceed the triplet hopping rate, kTTA ≫ khop. Yet, in the absence of a dopant, the radiative rate must greatly exceed the singlet fission rate, kr ≫ kSF. For simplicity, if we assume that triplet pairs are well described by total spin, and that TTA is iso-energetic, then kSF = kTTA and the condition distills to kr ≫ kSF ≫ khop(5)The radiative rate, kr, is typically of the order of 108 s−1. For a typical triplet diffusion constant of D ∼ 10−5 cm2 s−1, and a unit cell parameter of L = 10−7 cm, one arrives at an inferred hopping rate of khop = 2D/L2 = 2 × 109 s−1. If a radiative trap is introduced, then the rate of trapping replaces kr in these considerations.
The observant reader will notice that our inequality would seem doomed. But, we note that in many singlet fission systems, kSF > 1010 s−1 is readily achievable. And so, one needs to reduce the interchromophore coupling to reduce both kSF and khop by some orders of magnitude. This might be achieved by introducing disorder, but it would be preferable to achieve by design.
In a recent report, Flood, Laursen and co-workers introduced “cyanostar” a plug-and-play unit which binds the negative counterion of cationic dyes.141 They were able to increase the quantum yield of rhodamine to ∼30% in the solid state, highlighting the benefits of chromophore separation. It remains to be seen how cyanostar or similar co-crystal components affects the rate of triplet hopping or annihilation (Fig. 7c).
A sure way to reduce kSF without compromising other rates is to ensure that TTA is exothermic. Singlet fission attenuation of three orders of magnitude is achieved with a driving force for TTA of 7kBT, or 0.18 eV at 300 K, a completely reasonable quantity. For example, tetracene has a triplet energy of 1.25 eV, but an S1 energy of 2.3 eV. However, the singlet excitons of this material are known to rapidly deactivate via an excimer-like trap. Excimers are to be avoided. This may be achieved with bulky substituents. Anthracene derivatives are well known to exhibit exergonic TTA, and are well worth exploring for higher-energy blue-emitting applications.
Inspiration for the types of materials which maintain both the ability to undergo TTA and high fluorescence quantum yield may come from the field of OLEDs. In OLEDs, excitons are generated by charge recombination and due to spin-statistics, generate 75% triplets and 25% singlets. The non-emissive triplets may emit room temperature phosphorescence, but at the expense of exciton energy. Thermally-activated delayed fluorescence is another mechanism to coax photons from electro-generated singlets. Blue OLEDs, which are desired in organic displays, have been demonstrated to exhibit TTA: triplet–triplet-upconversion OLEDs (TTU-OLEDs).142–144 In this way, the maximum quantum yield is increased from 25% to 62.5% (25 + 0.5 × 75). Recently Han et al. demonstrated TTU-OLEDs using substituted anthracene derivatives with high solid-state quantum yield.145 These materials were termed AIEgens, from “aggregation induced emission” (AIE). But aggregation does not induce emission. It can attenuate internal conversion, by restricting conformational freedom.146 Nevertheless, what is important is that materials can maintain a high solid state quantum yield while exhibiting TTA. In the case of anthracene derivatives, it is achieved through bulky substituents and exergonic TTA.142–144 Without a TTA driving force (e.g. rubrene), efficient upconversion requires a delicate balance of rate constants and remains a challenging proposition. Importantly, despite commonly used in upconversion, rubrene appears to have a low f, which ultimately limits its applicability in the solid state.147 We require a larger library of TTA compounds for the solid state.
More annihilators
Research in TTU-OLEDs is motivated towards blue emitters. Yet, especially, solar applications of TTA-UC desire materials upconverting from near infrared photon energies. Nevertheless, discoveries from the world of TTU-OLEDs can be applied to tetracene derivatives for lower energy applications, providing a TTA driving force is maintained. Triplet energy levels are nontrivial to measure but can be calculated to a useful accuracy with some benchmarking.148,149 As such, computational screening of a range of candidates may help identify those with the highest triplet states which are likely to maintain a driving force for TTA-UC in the solid state. Bulky substituents are required to prevent excimer formation (self-trapping) and moderate the chromophoric coupling. The position of these bulky substituents can impact the overall TTA-UC process as recently demonstrated by Kazlauskas et al.150
Solving triplet-charge annihilation
In previous excitonic-based systems, triplet-charge annihilation (TCA) did not pose a significant hurdle, as triplets were created in the annihilator by a bound DET and TCA could only occur with dopant charges. However, in the current perovskite-sensitized systems, the free charge carrier transfer nature of the triplet generation results in a notable probability for the encounter of triplet excitons with free charge carriers. While Nienhaus et al.115 found no indication of TCA, a recent report by Bawendi and co-workers showed detrimental effects caused by TCA in the perovskite/rubrene system.124
Rubrene is a well-established hole transport layer,151–153 and in conjunction with the perovskite triplet sensitizer can harbor both long-lived triplets as well as freely diffusing holes, thus priming this TTA-UC system for TCA. To avoid negative effects of TCA, it would be beneficial to confine the holes into a small spatial region at the interface, enabling the efficient generation of triplets at the interface.
A simple approach to such hole confinement is based on generating an interfacial electric field, which can attract the holes to the interface (Fig. 7d). Ji et al. have investigated the band bending at the perovskite/rubrene interface.154 Interfacial charge transfer results in a space-charge region which can pin the charges at the interface, which has been shown to result in a spike in the observed upconversion emission intensity upon illumination.123
The compositional tunability of perovskites provides a simple method of tuning the interfacial band alignment, and thus, the probability of generating undesired diffusive free charges. Changing the methylammonium to formamidinium ratio is one possibility to approaching this problem, as the intrinsic doping of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 is inherently different (n-type vs. p-type respectively), influencing the Fermi level alignment and resulting band bending upon contact with the annihilator.155 In addition, the halide composition can be tuned, as the addition of bromide is expected to deepen the valence band and move the conduction band to a shallower level.156,157
Conclusions
Since the invigoration of research into TTA-UC in the mid 2000s, high efficiencies have been achieved in the solution phase, even under solar irradiance. Reports on solid-state TTA-UC so far fail to reach similar efficiencies despite intense research into many different architectures, as reviewed above. The overriding problem with TTA-UC in the solid state remains the photonic extraction of the energy of the S1 state. This boils down to 3 principle issues: back transfer to the sensitizing material; low solid-state quantum yield; and photonic outcoupling. In this perspective, we have laid out our vision for how to circumvent these issues with further research. The future for upconversion is bright!

 	Fig. 1  The mechanism of molecularly sensitized TTA-UC in solution, showing the formal electron exchange that takes place during the TTA process. ISC – intersystem crossing; TET – triplet energy transfer; TTA – triplet–triplet annihilation.	 
	(3)

 	Fig. 2  The mechanism of energy transfer from a semiconductor nanocrystal to chromophores in solution. (1) Photoexcitation on the nanocrystal. (2) Triplet energy transfer (TET) to the ligand from a state of mixed spin character. (3) TET from the ligand to the annihilator. (4) Triplet–triplet annihilation between two annihilator triplets. (5) Fluorescence from upconverted singlet. Figure adapted from ref. 27.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) shows a photograph of a gelated material upconverting green light to blue in an inverted cuvette. The inset is a cross-polarised transmission optical microscope image of the upconverting gel. (b) shows a scanning electron micrograph of the dried gel with cavities larger than 1 μm. The figures are adapted from the ref. 66.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematics of different solid-state TTA-UC implementations. (a) Polymeric upconversion. The triplet excitons travel along the polymer backbone and hop between adjacent chains. The dark azure dots represent the sensitizers which absorb incoming light (red lines). The photogenerated excitons diffuse through the polymer chains (blue squiggles) and annihilate (yellow star) and emit upconverted light (violet lines); (b) confinement of TTA-UC liquid domains, embedded in a rigid solid matrix. Sensitizers (dark azure dots) and annihilators (light blue ovals) are confined in liquid domains. Brown and grey rods represent a rigid solid matrix; (c) sensitizer-doped molecular crystals. Sensitizers (dark azure dots) are doped in molecular crystals of annihilators (blue ovals); (d) metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs). Sensitizers (khaki dots) and annihilators (blue lines) are arranged in a controlled manner to prevent aggregation; (e) hybrid systems. Brown dots represent colloidal nanocrystal sensitizers and blue ovals represent the deposited layer of molecules for annihilation; (f) semiconductor-mediated upconversion. The exciton transfer takes place as sequential hole and electron transfers. The grey layer represents the semiconductor phase as sensitizers and blue ovals are annihilators deposited on the top.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Bulk polymeric sample evidencing upconversion when both PdOEP and DPA are embedded in the matrix. (b) Concentration dependence study on the light-emitted. Both images were reproduced with permission from the ref. 84. Further permissions related to this material must be directed to ACS.

 	Fig. 7  Schematics of strategies to improve TTA-UC in the solid state. (a) Solving back transfer: triplet herding. Triplet excitons migrate to an annihilation layer via a transmitter layer. (b) Solving outcoupling. Total internal reflection is mitigated (purple dots) and a back reflector (grey layer) is added. This system must be homogeneously sensitized. (c) Solving the quantum yield problem. Organic crystals (green ovals) are engineered to control the excitonic coupling either with spacer molecules or bulky substituents (blue ovals). (d) Solving triplet-charge annihilation. An electric field confines the carriers to the interfacial region.
