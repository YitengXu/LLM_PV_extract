    , Accepted 15th July 2010First published on 20th August 2010AbstractThe optical properties of Yb3+ and Ho3+ co-doped Y2BaZnO5, synthesized by solid-state reactions, are investigated in detail. Under 977 nm excitation (∼25 × 10−3 W mm−2), bright green upconversion emission is observed. Concentration dependence studies at room temperature show that relatively high infrared to visible upconversion efficiencies are obtained with values up to ∼2.6%. The results of power dependence studies and temperature-dependent lifetime measurements allow us to determine the dominant upconversion mechanisms in Yb3+:Ho3+ co-doped Y2BaZnO5oxides. The materials presented in this article constitute new and efficient upconversion phosphors which may find utility in a variety of applications.
1. Introduction
The upconversion luminescence properties of rare-earth doped materials for infrared to visible upconversion have been the focus of much research since the development, in the nineteen eighties, of cheap and high-powered InGaAs diode lasers emitting at around 980 nm.1–3 Potential applications of these materials include biosensors,4–6 colour displays7–9 and solar cells.10–13 The idea of adding an upconversion material layer at the rear-face of a solar-cell device is very attractive. This is particularly relevant to the area of organic solar cells, to which Prof. Wudl has contributed extensively.14,15 The upconverting material could help decrease the transmission losses of the solar-cell device by converting the sub-band gap infrared photons of the solar spectrum into visible photons that can be efficiently used by the solar cell. This requires the development of highly efficient and stable materials that can upconvert efficiently at the solar-cell operating temperatures, with low excitation density thresholds.

Oxide materials are usually very stable chemically, mechanically, and thermally and could therefore be promising hosts for light upconversion applications. Ho3+ is an excellent dopant candidate for infrared to green upconversion because of its favourable intra-atomic 4f energy level structure. It has a relatively long-lived 5I7 level that can act as a population reservoir for upconversion processes. Upconversion of Ho3+ has been widely reported under 650 nm,16–18 750 nm19–22 and 875 nm23,24 excitations, but often with poor efficiency. Higher upconversion efficiencies have been achieved in materials co-doped with Yb3+ and Ho3+, where Yb3+ acts as a sensitizer for Ho3+ owing to its strong absorption around 980 nm.25,26Oxides materials have been reported as suitable host for Ho3+ upconversion.27,28
In the present work, we present results obtained on a new upconversion material, namely Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ (Ln = Y, Gd). Ln2BaZnO5 ternary oxide hosts were first reported by Michel and Raveau in 1982.29,30 Since then they have attracted attention for their interesting magnetic and optical properties. Ln2BaMO5oxides (Ln = Y, Gd and M = Zn, Cu) crystallize in the orthorhombic space groupPnma. Ln ions occupy two different seven-fold coordinated sites with the same symmetry but with slightly different Ln–O distances, while the M ions exhibit an unusual distorted tetrahedral coordination. Recently, the upconversion properties of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Er3+ and Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Er3+ under 980 nm continuous and pulsed excitation were investigated and bright green and red emissions observed.31,32 In the present work, we focus on the investigation of Yb3+ and Ho3+ co-doped Y2BaZnO5 for infrared to visible upconversion. We show that, by optimizing dopant concentrations, bright green upconversion luminescence can be achieved, with a relatively high efficiency of up to 2.6%. Luminescence mechanisms are elucidated through power dependence studies and temperature-dependent lifetime measurements on samples with different dopant concentrations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ phosphors

          Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%), Ho3+ (y%) phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reactions. Stoichiometric amounts of Y2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), Yb2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), Ho2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), ZnO (Fisher Scientific, 99.5%) and BaCO3 (Fisher Scientific, 99+%) were mixed, ground together, and sintered at 1200 °C for several days with intermediary grinding stages.
2.2. 
          X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis

X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were measured using a theta-theta diffractometer (Bruker D8), equipped with a Cu Kα source (generator: 40 kV and 40 mA), a scintillation detector with pulse-height analysis, and a variable knife-edge collimator for high resolution X-ray diffractometry. The best achievable instrumental resolution is 0.08° in 2θ.
2.3. Upconversion luminescence spectroscopy
For emission spectra acquisition and upconversion efficiency measurements, the sample of interest was finely ground and sandwiched between two quartz plates (Helma, 106-QS), one of which was coated with a reflective film of silver. The sample holder was then placed at the rear-face of an integrating sphere (Instrument System, ISP-150-100). For the acquisition of upconverted luminescence spectra, samples were excited using the 977 nm output of a temperature-controlled cw laser diode (Thorlabs, L980P100 and TCLDM9). The excitation signal was focused onto the centre of the sample holder using a lens (Newport, KPX049AR.16). After initial alignment of the setup, efficiency measurements were performed in two steps. For the first measurement, the quartz sample holder at the rear-face of the integrating sphere was left empty (no sample inside and rear-face silver coated), and the laser excitation on the sample was collected using an optical fibre and analyzed with a spectrometer (Instrument System, CAS 140B). From this measurement was determined the incident power in the near-infrared PincIR (integrated over the 950–1000 nm range). It is worth noting that a previous calibration was performed for the integrating sphere with an undoped sample, to mimic the scattering, and no significant differences were found with respect to the empty sample holder with a reflective mirror at its rear. For the second measurement, the sample under investigation was placed inside the quartz holder, and both the fraction of the excitation light that had not been absorbed by the sample (power Pnot absIR), and the emitted upconversion light in the 380–780 nm range (power Pemvis), were collected and quantified. From these two measurements, the fraction of the incident power absorbed by the sample was calculated. The upconversion efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the upconverted emission in the range 380–780 nm to the power absorbed in the range 950–1000 nm:  
A preliminary study showed that the statistical error on efficiency measurements (from repeated measurements) is of the order 6%. The collected emission spectra in the 380–1000 nm range were corrected for instrumental response.
For emission rise-time and lifetime measurements, a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (Continuum Panther OPO) pumped by the third harmonic wavelength at 355 nm of a Q-switched YAG:Nd laser (Surelite I laser) was tuned to 455 nm or 977 nm to excite the sample with a 7 ns pulse at a 10 Hz repetition rate. The fluorescence from the sample was separated from the pumping light using a filter (Schott, GG 475), and was then passed through a spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, Triax 550) and detected using a photomultiplier tube detector (Hamamatsu R550) connected to a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (LeCroy, 9350A) and a desktop computer. A continuous flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments Optistat and ITC) was used for low temperature measurements. For measurements above room temperature, a temperature-controlled hot stage was used (LinkamTHMS600 and TMS94).
3. Results
3.1. Crystal structure

Fig. 1 shows the typical powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%). The crystal structure is orthorhombic, space groupPnma. Relatively pure phases are obtained, as shown by the good quality of the Rietveld refinement.33Cell parameters are: a = 12.3387(1) Å, b = 5.70975(5) Å and c = 7.07037(7) Å (ICDD 87082). Note that the lattice parameters obtained in the doped sample are slightly smaller than those in the pure phase, which is attributed to the smaller sizes of the Yb3+ (0.0925 nm) and Ho3+ (0.0958 nm) compared to Y3+ (0.096 nm).

3.2. Upconversion luminescence emission
During 977 nm excitation at room temperature, Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ powders yield bright green emission, visible to the naked eye. Under 977 nm (corresponding to the selective excitation of Yb3+2F5/2) and 455 nm excitation (selective excitation of Ho3+3K8), typical emission spectra measurements reveal the presence of emission bands centred around 545 nm, 760 nm, 660 nm, 1040 nm (broad emission) and 1200 nm (Fig. 2). A comparison of the emission spectra obtained under 977 nm and 455 nm excitation shows that the green (545 nm) to near-infrared (760 nm) emission intensity ratio does not vary with the excitation wavelength.

3.3. Concentration dependence of UC efficiencies
The upconverted emission intensity and spectral properties depend on the dopant concentrations. In Fig. 3, the emission spectra of seven selected samples of the Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%), Ho3+ (0.5%) (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) family under cw 977 nm excitation (∼36 × 10−3 W mm−2 incident power) are presented. The upconversion emission intensity is seen to increase with the Yb3+ concentration, with an optimum performance around 5% Yb3+. When the Yb3+ concentration is increased above this value at constant Ho3+ concentration, the upconversion becomes less efficient. This can be explained by the appearance of concentration quenching, as has been observed in previous studies.35 The inset of Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the green (545 nm) to near-infrared (760 nm) emission intensity ratios for the same seven samples. For Yb3+ concentrations above ∼3%, the green to near-infrared ratio is seen to be constant with the Yb3+ concentration. A lower green to near-infrared ratio is measured on the sample doped with 1% Yb3+. In the second inset of Fig. 3, the evolutions of green (545 nm) and red (660 nm) emission intensities with the Yb3+ concentration in the same seven samples are represented. The green emission intensities increase strongly with increasing Yb3+ concentration before reaching a maximum around 5% Yb3+. For higher Yb3+ concentrations, the green emission intensity decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration. The near-infrared emission intensities present the same dependence on Yb3+ concentration as the green emission intensities for Yb3+ concentrations above ∼3%. The red emission intensity is shown to increase very slightly with Yb3+ concentration.

The insets present the evolutions of the green (545 nm) to near-infrared (760 nm) intensity ratio (top inset) and of the green (545 nm) and red (660 nm) emission intensities (bottom inset) as a function of Yb3+ concentration under cw 977 nm excitation (∼36 × 10−3 W mm−2 incident power). 
The upconversion efficiencies of a variety of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%), Ho3+ (y%) samples (0 ≤ x ≤ 15 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 3) were measured at room temperature under 977 nm excitation (∼25 × 10−3 W mm−2 incident power) (Fig. 4 and S1†). Samples containing between 0.25 and 0.75% of Ho3+, and total dopant concentrations (Yb3+ plus Ho3+) in the 5–9% range were shown to exhibit the highest efficiencies for infrared to visible upconversion. A maximum upconversion efficiency of 2.6 ± 0.2% was obtained with Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) at room temperature under ∼25 × 10−3 W mm−2 excitation. It is worth noting that very similar upconversion efficiency values (and behaviour) were obtained from Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ samples.

Contour lines (lines with the same upconversion efficiency value) and contour labels displaying the UC efficiencies associated to those contour lines are also included. 
3.4. 
          Pump power dependence of the luminescence emission

          Pump power dependences of the green (545 nm), near-infrared (760 nm) and red (660 nm) emissions were investigated at room temperature under 977 nm excitation. The three emissions were shown to present an approximate quadratic dependence on the excitation power density in the low power regime (Fig. 5). It is worth mentioning that for ∼25 × 10−3 W mm−2 excitation densities, about half of the incident light on the sample is absorbed, i.e..

3.5. Lifetime measurements, temperature dependence
The temporal evolutions of the emissions centred at around 545 nm, 760 nm, 1040 nm, and 1200 nm in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) were recorded under pulsed 455 nm (direct excitation of Ho3+3K8) and 977 nm (excitation of Yb3+2F5/2) in the 80−573 K range. It is worth noting that Ho3+ does not absorb at 977 nm, which guarantees a selective excitation of Yb3+ under 977 nm excitation. A typical transient corresponding to the room temperature temporal evolution of the green emission (545 nm) under pulsed 977 nm excitation in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) is presented in Fig. 6. At the end of the excitation pulse (t ≈ 0), no luminescence intensity is observed; instead, the transient exhibits a typical delayed rise and a decay. This is a clear fingerprint of an energy transfer process. The experimental intensity data were fitted to the expression:34 (1)where A is an emission intensity factor, and τr and τd represent the rise and decay times of the transient. Note that τr and τd are related to the transfer rate constants between Yb3+ and Ho3+ and to the intrinsic lifetimes of the levels involved.34 The decay curves showed, in some cases, bi- or triexpontial behaviour corresponding to decay mechanisms via different depopulation channels. As such, when the transient decay section could not be fitted by a single exponential, the effective fluorescent decay time τd was determined using the following equation (discretisation of the formula used in ref. 35). (2)where Ai and τi are the amplitude and lifetime corresponding to the level depopulation channeli, respectively, and n = 1, 2 or 3.
 Fig. 6  Typical temporal evolution of the green (545 nm) emission under pulsed 977 nm excitation and data fitting in order to get average rise and decay times in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) at room temperature. Note that the small peak observed at around t ≈ −140 µs is due to a triggering artefact. The inset presents an expansion of the initial rise. 
The fit of the typical room temperature transient corresponding to the green emission (545 nm) under pulsed 977 nm excitation of the Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) sample is presented in Fig. 6. The transient decay function presents two distinct lifetimes. The best fit for the 545 nm emission transient corresponds to average rise and decay times of τr = 14.4 ± 0.72 µs and τd = 280 ± 14 µs.
It is worth noting that for given dopant concentrations, the lifetimes measured under 977 nm excitation are longer than those obtained under direct 455 nm excitation (Fig. 7b).36 Moreover, for Yb3+ concentrations above ∼3%, the transients corresponding to the green (545 nm) and near-infrared (760 nm) emissions present the same rise and decay times (within experimental errors) in the whole range of temperatures studied (Fig. 7b).
 Fig. 7  Temperature dependence in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) of the lifetimes corresponding to (a) the 1040 nm emission under pulsed 900 nm excitation, (b) the 545 nm green and 760 nm near-infrared emissions under pulsed 977 nm and 455 nm excitations, and (c) the 1200 nm emission under pulsed 977 nm and 455 nm excitations. Note that in graph (b), the temperature dependence (up to room temperature) of the 545 nm green emission lifetime in a Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (0%), Ho3+ (0.5%) sample (no Yb3+) under pulsed 455 nm excitation is also represented for comparison. No data were recorded above room temperature. 
In Fig. 7, the temperature dependence of the lifetimes corresponding to (a) the broad 1040 nm emission from Yb3+ under 900 nm excitation, (b) the 545 nm green and 760 nm near-infrared emissions from Ho3+ under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations, and (c) the 1200 nm emission from Ho3+ under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) are shown. For clarity, the error bars are not shown in Fig. 7a–c but are typically of the order 5% (statistical error on repeated measurements).
Under 900 nm excitation (Fig. 7a), the lifetime corresponding to the broad emission around 1040 nm increases with increasing temperature, τd ≈ 165 ± 8 µs at T = 80 K to τd ≈ 522 ± 26 µs at T = 403 K, when it saturates. At temperatures above 405 K, the lifetime decreases again reaching τd ≈ 438 ± 22 µs at T = 573 K (Table S1, ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 7b, the Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) 545 nm and 760 nm emission lifetimes corresponding to the 545 nm and 760 nm emissions present very different temperature dependences under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations. Under 977 nm excitation, corresponding to the selective excitation of Yb3+2F5/2, the 545 nm and 760 nm emission upconversion lifetimes decrease with decreasing temperature for T < 350 K and reach a minimum of τdUC ≈ 179 ± 9 µs at T = 130 K, before slightly increasing at lower temperatures up to τdUC ≈ 215 ± 11 µs at T = 80 K (average of the 545 nm and 760 nm emission lifetimes). For T > 350 K, the green emission lifetime decreases with increasing temperature, from τdUC ≈ 300 ± 15 µs at T = 350 K to τdUC ≈ 204 ± 10 µs at T = 573 K. On the other hand, under 455 nm direct excitation of Ho3+3K8, the green emission lifetime decreases monotonically with increasing temperature (this is the case in the whole range of temperatures studied) from τddirect ≈ 182 ± 9 µs at T = 80 K to τddirect ≈ 30 ± 1.5 µs at T = 573 K. It is worth noting that, for the 7% Yb3+, 0.5% Ho3+ sample, the lifetimes corresponding to the green emission (545 nm) measured under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations are similar at temperatures around 80 K. For increasing temperatures in the 80–400 K range, the two graphs plotting the temperature dependences of lifetimes under both excitation wavelengths diverge. Note that the lifetimes measured under 977 nm excitation are always longer than those measured under 455 nm excitation.37Fig. 7b also shows the temperature dependence of the green emission lifetimes under 455 nm excitation in a purely Ho3+ doped Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (0%), Ho3+ (0.5%) sample. Lifetimes measured in this Yb3+-free sample under 455 nm are seen to decrease with temperature, from τddirect ≈ 170 ± 9 µs at T = 80 K to τddirect ≈ 112 ± 6 µs at T = 300 K similar to what observed in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%). However, for a given temperature, the lifetimes measured in the Yb3+-free sample are always higher than those measured in the Yb3+ and Ho3+ co-doped sample. Note that the three graphs plotted in Fig. 7b tend to almost converge for T = 80 K.
The temperature dependence of the 1200 nm emission under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations is represented in Fig. 7c. The lifetimes measured under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations are almost identical for temperatures above 220 K, but show a slight deviation at low temperatures. In the whole temperature range (and especially at low temperatures), the lifetimes of the 1200 nm emission are very long. For T > 185 K, the 1200 nm emission lifetimes measured under both 977 and 455 nm excitations decay strongly with increasing temperature, τd455 nm ≈ 1730 ± 87 µs, τd977 nm ≈ 1800 ± 90 µs (T = 185 K) down to τddirect ≈ 469 ± 23 µs, and τdUC ≈ 544 ± 27 µs (T = 573 K). For T < 185 K, the measured lifetimes decrease slightly with decreasing temperature, τddirect ≈ 1730 ± 87 µs, τdUC ≈ 1800 ± 90 µs (T = 185 K), τddirect ≈ 1630 ± 81 µs, and τdUC ≈ 1730 ± 87 µs (T = 80 K).
4. Discussion
4.1. Population and depopulation mechanisms of the energy levels of interest
A detailed investigation of the steady-state and dynamic emission properties of a variety of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%), Ho3+ (y%) (0 < x ≤ 3 and 0 < y ≤ 15) samples was performed and the results were presented in the previous section.
Under 977 nm Yb3+ excitation, the samples present a strong green upconversion emission, easily visible to the naked eye. Maximum upconversion efficiencies of ∼2.6% are obtained at room temperature on samples doped with Yb3+ and Ho3+ concentrations around 7% and 0.5%, respectively (Fig. 4). The emission spectra measurements reveal the presence of emission bands centred around 545 nm (strong upconversion emission), 660 nm (weak upconversion emission), 760 nm, 1040 nm (strong and broad emission) and 1200 nm (strong and broad emission). Under 977 nm excitation, the transients corresponding to the emissions centred at 545 nm, 760 nm and 1200 nm present a clear rise-time after the excitation is turned off, indicating that the population mechanisms of the energy levels from which these emissions arise involve at least one Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer step (Fig. 6). Power dependence studies show that under 977 nm excitation the emissions centred around 545 nm, 760 nm and 660 nm present a quadratic dependence on the excitation power, indicating a two-photon population process of their emitting levels (Fig. 5). According to the energy diagram (Fig. 8), the emissions centred at 545 nm, 660 nm, 1200 nm and 1040 nm can be assigned to the Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) → 5I8, Ho3+5F5 → 5I8, Ho3+5I6 → 5I8 and Yb3+2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions, respectively. The near-infrared emission centred at around 760 nm could be attributed to the Ho3+5I4 → 5I827 and/or Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) → 5I7 transitions.26,37,38 The invariance of the green (545 nm) to near-infrared (760 nm) emission intensity ratio with the excitation wavelength (Fig. 2), and with Yb3+ concentration (for Yb3+ concentrations above 3%, Fig. 3), suggests that both the 545 nm and 760 nm emissions might arise from the same Ho3+ level, in this case the thermalized Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) levels. This is confirmed by the comparison of the transients corresponding to the 545 nm and 760 nm emissions (Fig. 7b); the rise and decay times corresponding to these two emissions are very similar (within experimental errors) over the whole temperature range that was investigated. In view of these results, the emission centred at 760 nm can be exclusively assigned to the (5S2, 5F4) → 5I7 transition. Note that a surprisingly low green to near-infrared ratio was observed on the sample doped with 1% Yb3+ (Fig. 3). A possible explanation to this low value could be the existence of an additional channel for the 760 nm emission in addition to the (5S2, 5F4) → 5I7 emission, possibly via a Ho3+5I4 → 5I8 depopulation.27 This fact, together with a significantly decreased green to red upconversion emission ratio for Yb3+ concentrations smaller than 3%, suggests that processes involving an excited state absorption (ESA) from the long-lived 5I7 Ho3+ state could be relevant at low Yb3+ concentrations due to a reduced energy transfer upconversion (ETU) probability.
 Fig. 8  Simplified energy level diagram of Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions and the dominant upconversion mechanisms in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+. Radiative processes of ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA) and green, red and near-infrared luminescence, as well as non-radiative energy transfer upconversion (ETU), back-energy transfer (BET) and multiphonon relaxation processes, are represented. 
According to the energy diagram (Fig. 8), one can see two different ways of populating the thermalized (5S2, 5F4) energy levels. The first mechanism involves two successive Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer steps, Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I8 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5I6 and Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I6 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4). Alternatively, the (5S2, 5F4) levels could be populated by a first Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer step: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I8 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5I6 followed by an excited state absorption (ESA) by Ho3+5I6 (with no Yb3+ assistance). However, given the high absorption cross-section of Yb3+ at 977 nm39 compared to that of Ho3+,40–42 and the relatively high Yb3+ to Ho3+ concentration ratios in the samples, the first mechanism involving two successive Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfers is expected to be dominant in the population process for Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) for moderate and high relative Yb3+ concentrations.
Inspection of the energy diagram reveals three possible ways of populating the red emitting Ho3+5F5 level. First, it could be populated by multiphonon relaxation from the above lying green emitting levels, (5S2, 5F4) → 5F5. The second mechanism involves a phonon-assisted Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I8 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5I6, followed by a multiphonon relaxation step to the long-lived Ho3+5I7 level: 5I6 → 5I7 and a second Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer step populating directly the Ho3+5F5 red emitting level: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I7 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5F5. Alternatively, the second Yb3+2F5/2 to Ho3+5I7 energy transfer step could be replaced by an excited state absorption (ESA) by Ho3+5I7. Again, given the high absorption cross-section of Yb3 + at 977 nm compared to that of Ho3+, and the relatively high Yb3+ to Ho3+ concentration ratios in the samples, the mechanism involving two successive Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfers is expected to be dominant in the population process for Ho3+5F5.

          Ytterbium concentration dependence studies of the emission properties of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%), Ho3+ (0.5%) (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) samples (inset Fig. 3) show that for Yb3+ concentrations below 5%, green (545 nm) and near-infrared (760 nm) emission intensities increase with increasing Yb3+ concentration. This can be attributed to an increase in Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) population due to an increased Yb3+ sensitization. Lifetime measurements show that under 977 nm excitation, the (5S2, 5F4) level lifetime decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration (for Yb3+ concentrations ranging from 3% to 11%). This indicates that there is an additional process that depopulates the (5S2, 5F4) level in the presence of Yb3+ ions that is more favourable at high Yb3+ concentrations. It is worth mentioning that multiphonon relaxation rates are not expected to be dependent on dopant concentrations, and in particular Yb3+ concentrations since the phonon energy is quasi-invariant at these low doping levels (Fig. S2†). The Yb3+ concentration dependent depopulation of Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) could be attributed to a back-energy transfer mechanism between Ho3+ and Yb3+: Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) + Yb3+2F7/2 → Ho3+5I6 + Yb3+2F5/2.43,44 Energy transfer from Ho3+ to Yb3+ does exist, as evidenced by the broad emission attributed to Yb3+2F5/2 → 2F7/2 under selective excitation of Ho3+ at 455 nm (Fig. 2).
The increase in the green and infrared (760 nm) emission intensities for Yb3+ concentrations below 5% indicates that, in this concentration range, the (5S2, 5F4) levels become more populated by Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer than they are depopulated by Ho3+ to Yb3+ back-energy transfer. For Yb3+ concentrations below 5%, the red emission intensity also increases slightly. This indicates that the higher the Yb3+ concentration, the higher the ratio between Ho3+5F5 population and Ho3+5F5 depopulation. When the Yb3+ concentration exceeds 5%, the green emission intensity starts decreasing with increasing Yb3+ concentration. This means that the higher the Yb3+ concentration, the higher the influence of Ho3+ to Yb3+ back-energy transfer (depopulating Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4)) compared to that of the Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer route populating Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4). In this same Yb3+ concentration range, the red emission intensity keeps increasing slightly despite the decrease in green level population (Fig. 3). Moreover, a comparison of the emission spectra measured under 977 nm and 455 nm excitations shows that the Ho3+5F5 level emission is enhanced in the upconversion spectrum (as evidenced by the lower green to red emission intensity ratio) (Fig. 2). This indicates that Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) → 5F5 multiphonon relaxation is not the only process populating Ho3+5F5 under 980 nm excitation. Yb3+ to Ho3+5I7 energy transfer cannot be neglected when considering the population mechanisms of Ho3+5F5; the increase in red emission can be attributed to an increase of the Yb3+ to Ho3+5I7 energy transfer rates with Yb3+ concentration. The importance of this red level population channel involving Ho3+5I7 is confirmed by the observation of the transients corresponding to the emissions at 545 nm, 760 nm and 660 nm (Fig. S3†). Both the green and near-infrared (760 nm) emissions are seen to present the same rise-time; the red (660 nm) emission, however, presents a different average rise-time, which is shorter. This suggests that the main population mechanism of the red emitting level upconversion is not multiphonon relaxation from Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) since this would lead to longer rise-times of the red level compared to that associated to the 545 nm and 760 nm emissions. These results confirm that the contribution of Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I7 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5F5 to the population of Ho3+5F5 cannot be neglected.
4.2. Population and depopulation dynamics as a function of temperature
Temperature dependence studies of the Yb3+2F5/2 lifetimes under direct 900 nm excitation (observation of the transient corresponding to the broad emission around 1040 nm emission) in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) show that the maximum lifetimes are at around 420 K and decrease strongly with decreasing temperature down to 80 K, which is the limit of our measurements (Fig. 7a). One can see three major ways of depopulating the Yb3+2F5/2 level; the first process involves Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer (three different transfer processes must be considered: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I8 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5I6, Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I6 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4), and Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I7 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+5F5). The second process would involves Yb3+2F5/2 → 2F7/2 multiphonon relaxation, but in view of the large energy gap between the Yb3+ ground and excited states (∼10400 cm−1), the rates of multiphonon relaxation are expected to be low. We have observed that excitation hopping between Yb3+ does not contribute significantly to the Yb3+2F5/2 lifetime, as no significant concentration dependence has been found with the Yb3+ concentration in singly doped samples. Besides, the temperature dependence of the Yb3+2F5/2 lifetimes observed in Fig. 7a is very different from that expected for a process governed by multiphonon relaxation45 so we conclude that for T < 420 K, the decrease of lifetimes with decreasing temperature reflects the increase in the global Yb3+ to Ho3+ transfer rate (which includes three contributions corresponding to the transfers to Ho3+5I8, Ho3+5I6 and Ho3+5I7). This increase can be assigned to an improved overlap between the emission from Yb3+ emission and any of the absorptions by Ho3+5I8, Ho3+5I6 and/or Ho3+5I8. The remarkable increase of the green upconversion intensity supports this idea and suggests that the resonant transfer to Ho3+5I6 is the main beneficiary of this transfer probability increase.
Temperature dependence studies of the Ho3+5I6 lifetimes in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) (observation of the temporal evolution of the 1200 nm emission) show that for T > 200 K, the Ho3+5I6 lifetimes measured under 977 nm and 455 nm excitation are very similar and decrease with increasing temperature (Fig. 7c). The Ho3+5I6 level can be depopulated either by multiphonon relaxation to Ho3+5I7, by Yb3+ to Ho3+ ET: Yb3+2F5/2 + Ho3+5I6 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4), or by phonon-assisted Ho3+ to Yb3+ back-energy transfer. This suggests that the Ho3+5I6 dynamics might be governed mainly by the Ho3+, and in particular by the Ho3+5I6 → 5I7 multiphonon relaxation rate, which is expected to increase with temperature (the Ho3+5I6 lifetime is not governed by Yb3+–Ho3+ interaction dynamics). The slight lifetime decrease (of around 100 µs for τd455 nm and 70 µs for τd977 nm) in the 185–80 K range suggests that, despite the low Ho3+ concentrations in the samples, cross-relaxation mechanisms involving the lowest excited states of Ho3+ occur at low temperatures. These mechanisms are weak and only possible due to the long lifetimes of the levels involved.46
The temperature dependence study of the temporal evolution of the Ho3+ green emission at 545 nm in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) shows that the thermal behaviour is completely different under 455 nm excitation (down-conversion by selective excitation of Ho3+3K8) compared with that under 977 nm excitation (upconversion through selective excitation of Yb3+2F5/2) (Fig. 7c). Interestingly, the lifetimes measured under 977 nm excitation are longer than those measured under 455 nm excitation, for T > 80 K. This is a clear indication that the upconversion dynamics are governed by the Yb3+–Ho3+ interaction dynamics and not by the intrinsic Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) lifetimes.47 Under 455 nm excitation, the strong decrease of Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) lifetimes with increasing temperature (Fig. 7c) suggests that Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) → 5F5 multiphonon relaxation governs the green and near-infrared (760 nm) emitting level depopulation dynamics. A comparison of the lifetimes in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%) and Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (0%), Ho3+ (0.5%) under 455 nm excitation shows that, for each temperature, the sample containing Yb3+ (7%) presents lower intrinsic lifetimes than the Yb3+ free sample. This indicates that Ho3+ to Yb3+ back-energy transfer does exist, even under 455 nm excitation. At high temperatures, its contribution, however, is low compared to that of (5S2, 5F4) → 5F5 multiphonon relaxation.
Under 977 nm excitation, a distinct behaviour of Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) emission is observed, the lifetime decreasing with decreasing temperature. The lifetimes measured under 977 nm and 455 nm excitation tend to (almost) converge. This observation is noteworthy, and suggests that there is a change in the dynamics regime at low temperatures; the system is no longer governed by Yb3+–Ho3+ transfer times but by Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) → 5F5 intrinsic de-excitation times. We believe that this article constitutes the first report of a dynamics regime change by means of temperature variation in a Yb3+, Ho3+ doped system. A more elaborated theoretical study of temperature-dependent upconversion dynamics (rate equation solving, Monte Carlo simulation) is in progress and should allow us to get a better understanding of the change in dynamics regime experimentally observed.
The relevant upconversion mechanisms for Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ are summarized in Fig. 8.
5. Conclusions and future work
A very efficient near-infrared to green upconversion phosphor is presented in this article. Upconversion properties of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+, Ho3+ oxide materials were investigated as a function of dopant concentration and their upconversion efficiencies quantified. We believe that the high upconversion efficiencies obtained at room temperature (∼2.5%) are the highest reported to date for an Yb3+ and Ho3+ co-doped oxide phosphor.
Power dependence studies and temperature-dependent lifetime measurements provide a model for the upconversion mechanisms involved in these materials. The strong green (545 nm) and near-infrared (760 nm) emissions arise from the thermalised Ho3+ (5S2, 5F4) levels populated mainly by two successive Yb3+ to Ho3+ energy transfer steps under 977 nm excitation. Temperature-dependent lifetime studies suggest that there is an interesting change in upconversion dynamics occurring at low temperatures in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (7%), Ho3+ (0.5%).
