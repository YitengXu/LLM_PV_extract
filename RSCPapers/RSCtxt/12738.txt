    , Accepted 19th February 2013First published on 20th February 2013AbstractCobalt-based electrolytes have significantly advanced the tunability and performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. The typically used platinum cathodes are expensive and non-optimal for cobalt complexes, motivating the search for replacements. Graphene nanopowders are a viable alternative but they are mechanically unstable as catalysts due to their poor substrate adhesion. Here we report a new type of carbon–graphene nanocomposite that maintains the catalytic performance of graphene with enhanced adhesion via a conductive carbon matrix. These nanocomposites were synthesized by carbonizing mixtures of graphene nanoplatelets with a carbon-source, poly(acrylonitrile). The resulting materials had tunable performance with a low charge transfer resistance of ∼1 Ω cm2 using as little as 20% graphene. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with these carbon–graphene nanocomposites had enhanced fill factors and enhanced power conversion efficiencies as compared to platinum cathodes. Accelerated mechanical aging led to the complete detachment of graphene-only electrodes whereas carbon–graphene nanocomposites were stable.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are an alternative to traditional silicon photovoltaics that offer similar performance at lower cost and with greater ease of manufacturing.1–3 DSCs are fabricated with a monolayer of adsorbed dye sandwiched between a wide bandgap semiconductor such as anatase titania and a hole conducting electrolyte. Upon photoexcitation, the dye injects an electron into the conduction band of the semiconductor and a hole into the electrolyte. The difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor determines the device voltage. The longtime favored iodide electrolyte has recently been surpassed by more tunable cobalt based electrolytes where changing the complexing ligands allows adjustment of the redox potential.4–6 This flexibility has recently enabled DSCs with larger than 1 V open circuit voltage with cobalt bipyridine pyrazole electrolytes.7 These larger voltages possible with cobalt electrolytes recently led to a new record of 12.3% power conversion efficiency under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with a cobalt electrolyte having bipyridine ligands.8 Although platinum counter electrodes are popular with cobalt-based electrolytes,5–7,9,10 the charge transfer resistance is generally high which can lead to losses in the fill factor and overall efficiency.
Carbon-based cathodes have been applied towards cobalt mediated DSCs with much success.11–15 Beyond the sometimes greatly reduced charge transfer resistance, carbon materials are much more abundant and less expensive than precious metal catalysts such as platinum or gold. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have abundant edge sites16 that are catalytically active and lead these affordable electrocatalysts to have remarkably low charge transfer resistance for cobalt bipyridine electrolytes.11,14 Although these studies showed that GNPs had good electrochemical stability, they did not address the challenges of robust adhesion to a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. Indeed, GNPs were only weakly adhered to FTO after heat treatment and may be easily removed by light mechanical perturbations such as wiping or blowing. Such a loss of catalyst would clearly reduce the electrochemical performance while also causing extraneous optical absorption losses within the electrolyte.
Here we report the performance of a new nanocomposite cathode that greatly improves GNP adhesion by embedding it in a conductive carbon matrix derived from the carbonization of poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN). The use of an electrically conducting matrix for GNPs is key to support charge transport from the FTO. PAN is a well known polymeric carbon source that is mass-produced and already used for the commercial production of carbon fibers.17 PAN has a high carbon yield upon carbonization, leaving a residue of about 50% of the original mass.17 The type of carbon formed is largely determined by the temperature of the heat treatment where anything from amorphous carbon to partially graphitic, or purely graphitic carbon is accessible.17
Results and discussion
A series of nanocomposites with a range of GNP contents from 0 to 80% were prepared for analysis. The carbon–graphene nanocomposite samples were named accordingly CGX, where X corresponds to the weight fraction of GNPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the nanocomposite samples showed a mixed morphology containing smooth layers of carbon resulting from the PAN with aggregates of GNPs (Fig. 1a). This CG mixture had an overall lacey morphology with patches of exposed FTO. Measurements from cross-sectional SEM indicated a nominal film thickness of 100 nm. Raman spectroscopy was used to compare the carbonaceous character of C (PAN derived carbon), GNP (graphene nanoplatelet), and CG mixtures (Fig. 1b). Raman spectra of carbonaceous materials may contain numerous peaks corresponding to vibration modes for ideal graphite (G 1580 cm−1), graphitic edge defects (D1 1350 cm−1), graphitic surface defects (D2 1620 cm−1), disordered graphitic lattices such as polyenes (D4 1200 cm−1), or amorphous carbon (D3 1500 cm−1).18 The Raman spectra of sample C contained two broad peaks with significant D1, D2 and G-band contributions as well as some minor D4 character. Thus the PAN derived carbon in sample C is considered partially graphitic. In contrast, sample GNP had two sharp peaks corresponding to D1 and G-bands and a small D2 shoulder, consistent with highly graphitic carbon having many edge defects. Nanocomposite CG20 had a hybrid Raman spectrum that clearly combined the character of the C matrix and the GNP particles, with broader peaks than sample GNP and a more intense G-band than sample C.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure the performance of the electrodes. We first characterized sample C having only carbon derived from PAN to determine the catalytic contribution of the matrix material alone. All EIS measurements employed a symmetric cell with two identical electrodes. The EIS spectrum of sample C is presented as a Nyquist plot (Fig. 2a). The spectrum exhibited a single arc corresponding to charge transfer resistance at higher frequencies and a line corresponding to the Warburg impedance of the electrolyte diffusion at lower frequencies. This spectrum required two Randles circuits in series to obtain a good fit, which was attributed to a sequential charge transfer from the FTO to C and subsequently from C to the electrolyte. This two-step charge transfer process was further supported vide infra by a clear bimodal EIS character of the nanocomposites. The charge transfer resistances of sample C were thus found to be 6.37 and 0.62 Ω cm2 (Table 1), significantly higher than that of a pure GNP.11 The low carbonization temperature of 600 °C was sufficient for dehydrogenation reactions (400–600 °C), but not for denitrogenation reactions (600–1300 °C), resulting in carbon that was partially graphitic.17,19,20 Thus the higher charge transfer resistance compared to GNPs is consistent with the less graphitic character. Furthermore, it is anticipated that charge transfer directly from PAN derived carbon to the cobalt electrolyte will not significantly compete with charge transfer through GNP. The carbon–graphene nanocomposites exhibited EIS spectra with two clear semi-circles corresponding to a similar charge transfer sequence (Fig. 2). Please note that we examined pairs of Randles circuits in parallel and series, but could only obtain reasonable quality fits with a series combination (Fig. 3). There was no need to account for the Nernst diffusion impedance in pores due to the use of thin films (∼100 nm) with low porosity. The BET surface areas for samples C and CG20 were insignificant at 6.2 and 12.2 m2 g−1, respectively. For CG nanocomposites the sequential charge transfer steps were attributed to transfer from FTO to C and from GNP to the electrolyte. With 80% GNP, sample CG80 had charge transfer resistances of 0.10 Ω cm2 and 0.05 Ω cm2, the latter of which is similar to reported values for pure GNP. We thus ascribe the larger charge transfer resistance to the FTO–C couple (Rct1), and the smaller to the GNP–electrolyte couple (Rct2). For the series of samples, both Rct1 and Rct2 generally decreased with increasing GNP content (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The reduction of Rct2 with GNP content is consistent with the increased loading of the highly active GNP catalyst. Similarly, the reduction of Rct1 with GNP content could result from the enhanced GNP percolation, reducing the distance and resistance of charge transfer across the carbon matrix. The composition control of carbon–graphene nanocomposites enables the direct tuning of the resulting hybrid charge transfer characteristics.
 Fig. 2  The EIS spectra for carbon and carbon–graphene nanocomposites are shown as Nyquist plots with the best-fit lines (a). The spectra with the highest graphene loading are magnified for better visibility (b). Symmetric cell configurations were used for all samples.

Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated with carbon–graphene nanocomposites. All nanocomposite compositions had appropriate charge transfer resistance for the fabrication of high efficiency DSCs. Nanocomposite CG20 was selected because it had the largest amount of PAN derived carbon and was anticipated to have the best adhesion to the substrate. DSCs with these carbon–graphene nanocomposite cathodes were compared to standard platinum cathodes prepared with ∼10 μg Pt per cm2 as a control (Fig. 5). The short circuit current density and open circuit voltage were not largely affected by the cathode selection (Table 2). Similarly, the fill factor and power conversion efficiency were much the same for both cathodes under 9.5% simulated sunlight intensity. At 51% intensity, the lower charge transfer resistance of the carbon–graphene nanocomposite leads to a slightly enhanced fill factor of 0.77 and power conversion efficiency of 9.69% as compared to that of the platinum cathode, 0.74 and 9.38%, respectively. The advantages of the GNP based cathode are clearly apparent at 100% simulated sunlight intensity where CG20 leads to a fill factor of 0.74 and an efficiency of 9.11% compared to the platinum cathode with a fill factor of 0.68 and an efficiency of 8.61%. The reduced charge transfer resistance with carbon–graphene nanocomposites significantly improves the device performance.

The mechanical stability of the carbon–graphene nanocomposite cathodes is a significant advantage over pure GNP films. The in situ carbonized PAN forms a strong bond between the GNP and the FTO substrate surface. The nanocomposite films are thus difficult to scratch in contrast to the fragile GNP films. We subjected cathodes to accelerated mechanical aging to measure the graphene removal rate. Electrodes were put in a specific volume of acetonitrile, a common solvent for DSC electrolytes, and subjected them to fifteen minutes of sonication. The optical absorbance of the solution was a direct measure of the amount of graphene removed from the cathodes. The pure-GNP film of sample GNP was completely removed by this process leading to significant absorbance across the visible spectrum (Fig. 6). On the other hand, nanocomposite CG20 was stable against this mechanical aging and showed no significant absorbance indicating no loss of GNP (Fig. 6). The enhanced nanocomposite durability was visibly evident after testing where the GNP electrodes looked like bare FTO (Fig. 6b) whereas the CG20 film retained its macroscopic appearance (Fig. 6c). SEM confirmed the loss of GNP from the former and the preservation of the nanocomposite in the latter (Fig. 6d and e). The loss of catalyst from sample GNP would cause multiple problems for functioning DSCs. First, the catalysis at the cathode is significantly compromised and would lead to decreased fill factor and power conversion efficiency. Second, the dispersed catalyst particles cause extraneous optical absorption losses and could potentially clog the pores of the photoanode impeding electrolyte diffusion. Moreover, the particles could adsorb onto the FTO of the photoanode and increase dark current.14 Nanocomposite CG20 shows an almost identical dark current compared to the Pt cathode, which may be associated with improved adhesion of the catalyst particles. The addition of a carbon matrix to stabilize GNP catalysts makes them more suitable for use in practical devices.

Conclusion
Cobalt-based electrolytes have significantly advanced dye-sensitized solar cells. However, the non-ideal performance and high cost of platinum cathodes have motivated the search for replacement materials. Here we report a new type of carbon–graphene nanocomposite that combines the high catalytic performance of GNP with enhanced substrate adhesion via a conductive carbon matrix. The nanocomposite cathodes were shown to significantly outperform platinum cathodes in DSCs while also having greatly improved mechanical stability compared to GNP-only cathodes.
Materials and methods
Electrode preparation
Poly(acrylonitrile) of Mw 150000 g mol−1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HPLC grade N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Graphene nanoplatelets, GNPs (grade 3), were purchased from Cheap Tubes Inc. All reagents were used as-received. A 10% PAN solution was prepared in DMF with light heating and stirring for several hours. GNP powder was added in various ratios to PAN solutions such that the GNP fraction with respect to the total carbon (GNP + 50% carbon yield from PAN) was varied systematically from 0 to 80%. All spin coated solutions had 10% PAN to control the viscosity and preserve the final film thicknesses. Dispersions were prepared with probe sonication (Branson Sonifier 250) for several minutes. FTO glass (TEC 7, Hartford Glass Co.) was cleaned with 2% aqueous deconox solution under sonication, followed by a rinse with deionized water and ethanol before calcination at 500 °C for 20 minutes. GNP dispersions were sonicated just prior to spin coating at 5k rpm for 40 seconds. The cathodes were then heated to 200 °C for 1 h in air to cyclize the PAN. The cyclized PAN was then carbonized by heating at 20 °C min−1 to 600 °C with a 1 h hold under flowing argon, followed by natural cooling. Nanocomposite electrodes were washed thoroughly with acetonitrile.
Platinum and GNP electrodes were prepared for comparison. Platinized electrodes were prepared by drop casting 5 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol followed by calcination at 400 °C for 15 minutes. The preparation details of GNP electrodes were described in a previous study.21
SEM measurements
SEM was performed with a field emission source and an accelerating voltage of 5 kV with an in-lens secondary electron detector on a Zeiss Merlin.
Raman measurements
Raman scattering measurements were made using a 532 nm wavelength laser beam and were acquired with a Labram HR800 model of Jobin-Yvon Horiba spectrometer equipped with a microscope for collection of backscattered Raman signals.
EIS measurements
Electrocatalyst performance was measured on symmetric “dummy-cells” by EIS using the Eco-Chimie Autolab PGSTAT 10 with an FRA module. Frequencies from 0.1 to 105 Hz were scanned with a perturbation of 10 mV and an average potential of 0 mV. The data were iteratively fitted using ZView. The active cell area was 0.25 cm2 and the same Co(II/III)(bpy)3 electrolyte was used as described under the DSC preparation section below. The fit parameters for the constant phase element (CPE) and Warburg diffusion correspond to the equations Z = (T[iw]P)−1 and Z = Rtanh([iTw]P)/(iTw)P, respectively, where w is the angular frequency.
Nitrogen physisorption measurements
The film porosities were evaluated with a Micrometrics ASAP 2000 apparatus using nitrogen gas. Samples were first degassed under high vacuum at 250 °C for several hours and were subsequently measured in liquid nitrogen.
DSC preparation and measurements
Around 5 μm thick TiO2 transparent films composed of 20 nm diameter anatase were deposited by screen printing onto FTO glass (Solar 4 mm thickness, 10 ohms per sq., Nippon Sheet Glass) by repeated cycles of screen-printing.22 A ∼5 μm scattering layer (400 nm diameter, Catalysts & Chemicals Ind. Co. Ltd., HPW-400) was deposited on the transparent layer. The TiO2 electrode was sensitized with 3[6-[4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino-]phenyl]-4,4-dihexyl-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-yl]-2-cyanoacrylic acid, coded Y123 by overnight dipping into 0.1 mM of the dye in a 4-tert-butanol–acetonitrile mixture (1:1 v/v). The DSC was assembled with a counter electrode using Surlyn tape (25 μm in thickness) as a seal and spacer. The cell active area for illumination was 0.2 cm2, defined by a shading mask. A self-adhesive, anti-reflecting, ultraviolet cutoff film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was attached to the top of the active area to decrease light reflection losses. All experiments employed a Co(II/III) tris(bipyridyl) redox electrolyte with 220 mM Co(II)(bpy)3[B(CN)4]2, 50 mM Co(III)(bpy)3[B(CN)4]3, 100 mM LiClO4, and 200 mM 4-tert-butylpyrdidine in acetonitrile.
Accelerated mechanical aging
About 1 cm2 of each cathode was subjected to accelerated mechanical aging by sonication for 15 minutes in 5 mL of HPLC grade acetonitrile (Biosolve) using an ultrasonic bath (VWR USC500TH). The nanocomposite was washed by sonication before the experiment. The absorbance of the resulting dispersion was measured using a quartz cuvette with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The same quartz cuvette and fresh acetonitrile was used as the baseline for the measurement.
