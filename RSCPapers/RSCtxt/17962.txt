    , Accepted 18th November 2013First published on 19th November 2013AbstractA facile method for improving the photo current of the [60]PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)/P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) photodetector device is demonstrated, and 1.6 times enhancement of the on/off ratio of the device is obtained by using wavelength-matched photonic crystals as substrates.
1. Introduction
Organic photodetectors based on organic materials and conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention due to their unique advantages,1–4 such as low cost fabrication, large-area high density arrays, superior mechanical character and the ability to adjust the structure of the organic molecules. Organic/polymer photodetectors can endow materials with more flexibility and foldable properties which facilitate their application in signal processing and optical sensing systems, typical examples include foldable devices and solar cells.2–4 Moreover, the functions of organic materials and polymers can be intentionally tuned by modifying the chemical structures of the organic molecules or the monomers in the polymers.2,3,5 However, altering the structure of the organic molecules and modifying the polymers usually involves tedious synthetic processes and brings about new problems in the system. For example, disrupting the uniformity of the system or over-modifying a fullerene derivative may undermine its electric and biomedical properties.6 It is particularly noted that the optimization of one organic device is relatively complex. Herein, we have developed a facile approach to optimize a photodetector device simply by substituting the traditional substrate with wavelength matched photonic crystals (PCs).
PCs possess special light manipulation properties, which make them a good candidate for optimizing optical devices.7–11 This prominent feature of PCs facilitates corresponding applications in amplified detection sensitivity for TNT12 and DNA13 and enhanced optical storage performance14, etc.15–20 Because of resonant Bragg scattering, light propagates at reduced group velocity near the stop band of PCs which will lead to optical gain and stimulated emission.21–23 Notably, PCs have been used in dye-sensitized solar cell systems to improve the light harvest and power conversion efficiency.24–28 Therefore, the ability of PCs to amplify optical signals is an alluring characteristic for developing highly sensitive optical devices. However, as a parallel field to solar cells, the field of photodetectors remains untouched by PCs, since the classic PC substrate made by polystyrene spheres is not solvent-compatible29 and the cracks in conventional PCs degrade the properties of the devices.
In this paper, we successfully achieve an enhancement of photocurrent by introducing PCs into the [60]PCBM/P3HT photodetector device. [60]PCBM/P3HT as a classic acceptor–donor system30,31 has been widely used in photodetector devices, in which P3HT acts as a donor, and [60]PCBM acts as an acceptor. This system demonstrates promising applications in solar cells,32 chemiluminescence detection33 and photodetectors34–36 because of its superior charge transfer properties. Nonetheless, there is still significant potential for improvement of the sensitivity of the system, which is usually determined by the photo current, the dark current and the response speed.34,35 Since the photocurrent of one device is usually determined by both the intensity of the light source and the properties of the material, a light amplifier is an indispensable strategy for enhancing the photocurrent of a device whilst keeping the materials and the light source unchanged.
Herein, we design a device to improve the photocurrent of the photodetector by using wavelength-matched PC as a substrate, which results in a 1.6 fold amplification of the on/off ratio of the corresponding photodetector device compared with that on a bare glass substrate. This improvement can be attributed to the efficient reflection of particular wavelengths and the defects caused by the rough structure of PCs. This method opens up a simple and viable approach to the design and development of high performance photodetector devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
[60]PCBM was synthesized according to the literature.37 1,2-Dichlorobenzene and P3HT (Mn, 20000; Mw, 33000) were bought from the Beijing Chemical Factory, China, both of them were A. R. grade.
2.2. Synthesis of monodisperse latex particles
Poly(styrene–methyl methacrylate–acrylic acid) (poly(St–MMA–AA)): monodisperse latex spheres of poly(St–MMA–AA) were synthesized using our previous method.38 The resulting latex spheres were used directly without purification. The polydispersity of the latex spheres was approximately 0.5%, which was measured using a ZetaPALS BI-90plus (Brookhaven Instrument).
2.3. Fabrication of photo-crosslinked PC films
The PC films were fabricated by self-assembly of latex particles of poly(St–MMA–AA) on a glass substrate using a vertical deposition method39 at a temperature of 60 °C and the humidity of 60% for 24 h. After the samples were dried, they were sintered at 85 °C for 30 min to increase the stability of the samples. Then the PC films were immersed into an acrylamide (AAm) solution for 8 min following by exposure to UV illumination for 18 min. As a result, photo-crosslinked PC films were obtained.29
2.4. Fabrication of the photodetector device
The photodetector device was fabricated according to the previous reports from our group.40,41 Firstly, a copper grid was put on the [60]PCBM/P3HT active layer which was fixed with a silver glue. Secondly, platinum particles were sputtered onto the [60]PCBM/P3HT film. Finally, the copper grid was carefully removed to form a platinum electrode array with a distance of 10 μm between adjacent electrodes.
2.5. Characterization
The SEM images of samples were obtained using a field-emission SEM (JEOL JSM-6701F, Japan) after sputtering the samples with a thin layer of platinum. Reflectance spectra were collected using a fiber optic spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, Inc., HR 4000 256 UV–Vis–NIR). A UV (365 nm, 0.8 mW cm−2) lamp from Jiangsu Kylin-Bell Lab Instrument Co. Ltd. was used as a UV source for the fabrication of photo-crosslinked PC films. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley 4200 SCS and a Micromanipulator 6150 probe station in a shielded, clean box at room temperature. An iodine–tungsten lamp was selected as a white light source in view of the significant absorption of the [60]PCBM/P3HT film.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents a typical configuration of a PC enhanced photodetector device and the mechanism of photo current generation. The photodetector device is composed of a [60]PCBM/P3HT film spin-coated onto the surface of a PC. The P3HT acts as a donor and [60]PCBM as an acceptor, which forms a classic photoelectric material owing to the outstanding charge transfer features of the three-dimensional interconnected network.4,42 When the film is excited with white light, P3HT releases electrons, and [60]PCBM accepts the electrons. As a result, a photocurrent is produced. Since the PC substrate can enhance the light intensity and improve the photocurrent by selectively reflecting the incident light, an improved on/off ratio could be obtained. In this system, the PC is obtained by self-assembly of monodisperse latex particles of poly(styrene–methyl methacrylate–acrylic acid) (poly(St–MMA–AA))38 and subsequent photo-crosslinking.29 The photo polymerization process can not only remarkably improve the solvent resistance of the PC films,43,44 but also keep the active materials attached to the surface of the PC, rather than the interstices of the latex particles, which can greatly improve the performance of active materials. Furthermore, the infiltrated photopolymer plays an adhesive role and can patch up the cracks in the PC film, ensuring the quality of the device on the PC. Under the same condition, a control photodetector device was built on a bare glass substrate by spin coating the active materials and manufacturing the platinum electrodes as above.45 The PCs were fabricated by latex particles with diameters of 190 nm, 210 nm and 240 nm.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the amplified [60]PCBM/P3HT device on a PC. When this photoelectric film is excited by white light, a photocurrent is observed with a bias voltage on the platinum electrodes. The use of a wavelength-matched PC as a substrate can amplify the photocurrent of the device. 
The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the P3HT, [60]PCBM and [60]PCBM/P3HT film are shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption of P3HT is mainly in the visible range from 450 to 620 nm, while the absorption of [60]PCBM is located in the UV region with the main absorption peak at around 347 nm. When P3HT is mixed with [60]PCBM, the [60]PCBM/P3HT blend has the advantages of both P3HT and [60]PCBM materials and exhibits a broad absorption in the UV–Vis region, which could amplify the photocurrent of the photodetector. Fig. 2b presents the absorption spectrum of [60]PCBM/P3HT and the reflection spectra of the PCs assembled from (poly(St–MMA–AA)) latex particles with different diameters. The main absorption of [60]PCBM/P3HT lies in the visible region with the maximum absorption at 520 nm which corresponds to green light. Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of the stopband positions of the PCs on photo current of photodetector, PC samples with stopbands at 460, 520, and 620 nm were fabricated from latex spheres with diameters of 190, 210 and 240 nm respectively (Fig. 2b), since all are included in the absorption range of the [60]PCBM/P3HT film.
 Fig. 2  (a) The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the P3HT, P3HT/[60]PCBM film and [60]PCBM; (b) the reflection spectra of as-prepared PCs (red, green and blue curves) and the UV–Vis absorption spectrum of the [60]PCBM/P3HT film (pink curve). The PCs were assembled from different latex spheres with diameters of 190, 210 and 240 nm, and the reflection spectra were measured with a light incident along the normal surface of the PCs. The stopbands of the three kinds of PCs are in the range of the absorption of P3HT. 
The transmission spectra of the [60]PCBM/P3HT film (Fig. S5†) was examined to make sure that sufficient light still passes through the [60]PCBM/P3HT film. The result indicates there is about 60% light transmission at 520 nm, which may be further reflected by the PC. In our opinion, this part of the light could be seen as the second light source, which would benefit the photo current of the device.
The SEM images of the cross-linked (poly(St–MMA–AA)) PC reveal that the colloidal spheres are in a face-centered-cubic arrangement with a close-packed plane (111) oriented parallel to the substrate (Fig. 3a), which can extend over a large region (Fig. 3b).46,47 With the aid of the cross-linked layer, the PC film is smooth and crack-free, which ensures the quality of the photodetector device, therefore fulfilling a prerequisite for PC's application in photoelectric devices. Notably, the ordered periodicity of the PC film is retained even after it is coated with an active layer of [60]PCBM/P3HT (see Fig. 3c). Moreover, as revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the films fabricated on the glass and PC substrates, both of them have a homogeneous phase without obvious crystallization (Fig. S6†). The thickness of the active layer is approximately 250 nm (Fig. S4†). The well-ordered structure is closely related to the high reflection spectra shown in Fig. 2. The periodicity of the PC film with latex sphere diameters of 190, 210 and 240 nm corresponds to stopbands at 460, 520 and 620 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Typical SEM images of the photopolymerized poly(St–MMA–AA) PC film (a and b), PCs with the active layer [60]PCBM/P3HT spin-coated on the surface of the PC film (c) and the photodetector device array coated with platinum electrodes on the surface of (c); (d). The latex particles have good long range order, and the ordered periodicity of the PC film is retained after it is coated with the active layer. 

Fig. 4b and d exhibit a typical I–V curve and the photocurrent response of the photodetector device when using PCs with stopband of 520 nm as the substrate. As expected, a remarkable enhancement in the photocurrent of the device built on a PC substrate is observed in comparison with that built on a bare glass substrate (Fig. 4a and c). Typically, the maximum photo current enhancement is obtained when the stopband of the PC (λ = 520 nm) overlaps with the absorption wavelength of P3HT. The increased photo current resulted in the amplification of the on/off ratio of the optimized photodetector (4.7) by 1.6 times over the control device (1.8). The enhanced performance of the optimized photodetector is stable during the light on and off cycling process. Notably, only a slight increase in the on/off ratio occurs for the PC with a stopband of 460 nm (1.2 times) and negligible improvement is observed for the PC substrate with a stopband of 620 nm (Fig. S2†) since the stopband of the PC does not match the adsorption spectra of P3HT.
 Fig. 4  (a) I–V curve of the control device built on a bare glass substrate; (b) I–V curve of the device built on the PC film with a stopband at 520 nm; (c and d) time-dependent photocurrent response of the control device and the device on the PC film with a stopband at 520 nm, at an incident light density of 7.63 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage of 1 V. The current ratio was normalized by the dark current. An evident enhancement of the photocurrent and on/off ratio of the device is observed when using a wavelength-matched PC as the substrate. 
This photo current enhancement should be attributed to the efficient and selective reflection of the light induced by PC substrate when it passes through the [60]PCBM/P3HT film, which can serve as a secondary light source, equivalent to an increase in light intensity. During this process, the PC plays a dielectric mirror role in the device. When the intensity of the light was improved, the photon density in the [60]PCBM/P3HT film increased accordingly. As a result, more photo-excited electrons in P3HT successively transferred to [60]PCBM producing an improved photocurrent.
Another possible contribution to the improvement of the photo current is the rough structure of the PC substrate. The bumps in the structure of the PC substrate may cause far more defects on the active layer compared with the bare glass substrate, which may serve as trap states, leading to low response speeds and high internal photoconductive gain (Fig. 5).48,49

Based on the two main factors mentioned above, the wavelength-matched PC film as an optical amplifier in this device plays an important role, which can improve a light source and gain the light near the stopband in the meantime.50 This result unambiguously demonstrates efficient improvement of the photocurrent and sensitivity of the photodetector device by simple involvement of a wavelength-matched PC, which is desirable for practical applications in photodetectors.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a facile approach to improve the photo current by introducing wavelength-matched PCs into photodetector devices is demonstrated. A 1.6-fold improvement of the on/off ratio is achieved relative to that on the bare glass, owing to efficient and selective light reflection and defects caused by the rough structure of the PC. This result presents a new protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of photodetectors, and can be extended to other kinds of photo electric devices.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the amplified [60]PCBM/P3HT device on a PC. When this photoelectric film is excited by white light, a photocurrent is observed with a bias voltage on the platinum electrodes. The use of a wavelength-matched PC as a substrate can amplify the photocurrent of the device.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the P3HT, P3HT/[60]PCBM film and [60]PCBM; (b) the reflection spectra of as-prepared PCs (red, green and blue curves) and the UV–Vis absorption spectrum of the [60]PCBM/P3HT film (pink curve). The PCs were assembled from different latex spheres with diameters of 190, 210 and 240 nm, and the reflection spectra were measured with a light incident along the normal surface of the PCs. The stopbands of the three kinds of PCs are in the range of the absorption of P3HT.	 

 	Fig. 3  Typical SEM images of the photopolymerized poly(St–MMA–AA) PC film (a and b), PCs with the active layer [60]PCBM/P3HT spin-coated on the surface of the PC film (c) and the photodetector device array coated with platinum electrodes on the surface of (c); (d). The latex particles have good long range order, and the ordered periodicity of the PC film is retained after it is coated with the active layer.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) I–V curve of the control device built on a bare glass substrate; (b) I–V curve of the device built on the PC film with a stopband at 520 nm; (c and d) time-dependent photocurrent response of the control device and the device on the PC film with a stopband at 520 nm, at an incident light density of 7.63 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage of 1 V. The current ratio was normalized by the dark current. An evident enhancement of the photocurrent and on/off ratio of the device is observed when using a wavelength-matched PC as the substrate.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a and b) Response time of the control device. (c and d) Response time of the device built on the PC substrate with a stopband at 520 nm.
