    , Accepted 6th February 2017First published on 7th February 2017AbstractThe Cu–ZnS passivation layer is considered to be far more efficient than the most widely used ZnS passivation layer in terms of enhancement of light harvesting and suppression of surface charge recombination. As a result, a TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) exhibits a greatly improved efficiency of 3.35%, which is 30% and 82% higher than that of TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS based QDSSCs, respectively.
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS,1 CdSe,2 PbS,3 PbSe,4 CuInS2,5 and CdTe,6etc., have gained much popularity due to their outstanding properties of tunable band gaps,7 high absorption coefficients,8 large intrinsic dipole moments,9 and multiple exciton generation (MEG).10 Despite these excellent properties, the performance of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs = 11.6%) is lower than that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs = 14.3%).11,12 One of the main serious problems behind the lower photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs is the severe electron recombination process at the interface of the TiO2/QD/electrolyte. Therefore, several methods have focused on the control of charge recombination processes in QDSSCs.
To reduce charge recombination in QDSSCs, the mesoporous oxide layer has been over-coated with a thin wide band gap inorganic layer, which acts as a passivation layer and controls the charge recombination. Until now, ZnS has been the most widely used passivation layer for suppressing interfacial recombination in QDSSCs, to enhance the performance of solar cells.13 However, recently, Shen et al. introduced a P-type CuxS layer on the surface of CdS QDs, which not only improved the light harvesting of the photoelectrode but also boosted the charge separation after photo-excitation.14 Radich et al. reported that a CuxS coating on CdSe QDs mediates hole transfer to a polysulfide electrolyte by collection of photogenerated holes from CdSe and resulted in the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.6%.15 Interestingly, the combination of the ZnS material with dipolar molecules on the TiO2 surface has been demonstrated to elevate the QDSSC performance.16 Our recent research has shown that a dopant can alter the charge separation and recombination processes in QDSSCs by creating electronic states in the mid-gap region of the QDs and also by enhancing the light harvesting, resulting in an improved PCE of 5.17%.17 Therefore, the combination of dopants and a ZnS passivation layer may efficiently suppress the charge recombination observed on bare ZnS at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.17 To date, the fabrication of a Cu doped ZnS passivation layer in QDSSCs has not been reported.
Here, Cu–ZnS is directly grown on TiO2/CdS film using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. Our investigation reveals that the transition metal Cu2+ dopant in the ZnS can strongly suppress charge recombination processes and increase light harvesting, which enables an improved photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs. As a result, the QDSSC based on TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS exhibits a PCE of 3.35% (with short-circuit current density (JSC) = 10.49 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.621 V and fill factor (FF) = 0.515), which is much higher than the PCE values of TiO2/CdS/ZnS (2.58%) and TiO2/CdS (1.84%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements show that this Cu–ZnS passivation layer significantly reduces the electron recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces.

Fig. 1a and b depict the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the bare ZnS and Cu–ZnS layers on the surface of the TiO2/CdS. As seen from the SEM images, the surface morphologies of both samples are similar although there is a little increase in the particle size of Cu–ZnS due to the introduction of the Cu dopant in the ZnS layer coating; the exact change in size is difficult to measure and inconclusive. Thus, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were used to confirm the CdS QDs and ZnS coating on the surface of TiO2. Fig. 1c depicts the XRD curve of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS thin film. XRD analysis indicates that the characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS file no. 01-084-1286), cubic CdS (JCPDS file no. 01-080-0019) and hexagonal ZnS (JCPDS file no. 00-039-1363) phases can be identified which is consistent with our previous work.18 In the XRD patterns, the characteristic diffraction peak of copper is not present, which is due to the low amount of Cu doped in the ZnS. The deposition of Cu in the ZnS layer can be clearly investigated by XPS analysis. Fig. 1d depicts the XPS survey spectra of TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS films. The survey spectra of both films show the characteristic peaks of Ti2p, O1s, C1s, Cd3d, Zn2p, and S2p, while additional Cu2p peaks are observed in the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS film. The inset in Fig. 1d shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu, which contains two peaks at 952.7 eV (Cu 2p1/2) and 932.4 eV (Cu 2p3/2), indicating the state of Cu2+. Therefore, it can be concluded from XPS analysis that the Cu is successfully deposited in the ZnS passivation layer.

UV-visible absorption spectra of the TiO2/CdS photoelectrodes with ZnS and Cu–ZnS layers are shown in Fig. 2a. The TiO2/CdS electrode has an absorption edge at nearly 512 nm and it shifts towards longer wavelength with a layer of ZnS (525 nm) or Cu–ZnS (536 nm). Therefore, it is clear that the TiO2/CdS with the Cu–ZnS layer shows a larger absorption window in the visible region and so is capable of harvesting a greater range of the light spectrum, which enables a better QDSSC performance. The J–V characteristics of the QDSSCs based on these three photoelectrodes were measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and are shown in Fig. 2b. The resultant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The QDSSC based on the TiO2/CdS photoanode exhibited a VOC of 0.586 V, JSC of 7.05 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.444, resulting in a PCE (η) of 1.84%. The photovoltaic performance of the TiO2/CdS QDSSC could be further improved with the introduction of the ZnS passivation layer (TiO2/CdS/ZnS), which resulted in a higher VOC of 0.610 V, JSC of 8.30 mA cm−2, FF of 0.509, and η of 2.58%. The highest overall VOC (0.621 V), JSC (10.49 mA cm−2), FF (0.515) and η (3.35%) were achieved with the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS based QDSSC. The improved photovoltaic performances of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS based QDSSC were due to the fact that the Cu–ZnS layer could efficiently broaden the light-harvesting range, increase the electron injection rate and significantly suppress the charge recombination at the interface of the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.

To investigate the charge transport properties and recombination processes at the interfaces, EIS analysis was conducted in QDSSC devices under one illumination at a bias voltage of 0.5 V. The Nyquist plots of the QDSSCs are shown in Fig. 2c; the inset shows the equivalent circuit for fitting and the fitted parameters are listed in Table 1. In general, Rs denotes the overall series resistance, Rct indicates the charge transfer resistance with a parallel combination of chemical-capacitance (Cμ) at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface (large semicircle), and RCE and CCE represent the resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (small semicircle).19 An identical electrolyte and counter electrode were used in all of the experiments, which resulted in almost the same values of RCE. However, the Rct of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS based QDSSC (18.86 Ω) was larger than those of TiO2/CdS/ZnS (15.92 Ω) and TiO2/CdS (8.47 Ω) based QDSSCs. The high Rct value in TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS indicates the lower recombination of photo-injected electrons with electrolyte in this QDSSC than in TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/ZnS based QDSSCs.20 Moreover, the Cμ of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS cell (2873 μF) was much higher than those for TiO2/CdS/ZnS (2369 μF) and TiO2/CdS (1153 μF) based cells due to the large number of photo-excited electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 by the CdS/Cu–ZnS layers. Furthermore, the electron life-times (τe) can be extracted using the equation, τe = Rct × Cμ. The larger τe of TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS (54.18 ms) enhances the charge collection efficiency of this QDSSC in comparison to TiO2/CdS/ZnS (37.71 ms) and TiO2/CdS (9.76 ms) based QDSSCs. It clearly reveals that the introduction of Cu2+ into the ZnS passivation layer can prolong electron lifetimes in view of the reduced charge recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to further investigate the enhancement of the JSC values of the three devices. As shown in Fig. S1, ESI,† for all cells, the onset positions of the photocurrents in IPCE curves were well matched with those of the corresponding absorption spectra. The maximum IPCE of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS QDSSC reached 72% at 440 nm, which represents an improvement of about 16% or 7% compared with the TiO2/CdS (maximum IPCE of 62% at 420 nm) or TiO2/CdS/ZnS (maximum IPCE of 67% at 430 nm) sensitized solar cells, and indicates the excellent energy conversion efficiency of the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS QDSSC. IPCE can be estimated by eqn (1):21 IPCE = ηLHE × ηct × ηcc(1)where ηLHE, ηct and ηcc represent the light harvesting, charge transfer and charge collection efficiencies. The light harvesting efficiency “LHE” is given by eqn (2):22 LHE = 1 − 10−absorbance(2)
From the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 2a), it can be seen that the absorption of the photoanode with the Cu–ZnS layer is higher than that of the bare TiO2/CdS or TiO2/CdS/ZnS photoelectrodes, denoting the higher ηLHE. ηct is obtained from the energy level difference between the conduction band edge of the QDs and the photoanode, which is the driving force for charge transfer. ηcc is related to the charge recombination in solar cells. The EIS results indicate that the deposition of the Cu–ZnS passivation layer can increase the charge transfer resistance (recombination resistance) and prolong the electron lifetime. In summary therefore, the Cu–ZnS passivation layer reduces interfacial recombination and also acts as a collaborative cosensitizer to both utilize more sunlight and accelerate the electron transport in the photoanode.
To investigate the Cu doping effect in enhancing the QDSSC performance, OCVD analysis was conducted under open-circuit and dark conditions. OCVD is a useful technique to obtain information about the charge recombination process of photo-excited electrons with an oxidized redox couple. The measured OCVD curves for the studied QDSSC devices after turning off the illumination are shown in Fig. 2d. Apparently, the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS QDSSC exhibited a slower decay rate than the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS based cells, indicating that the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS QDSSC can effectively suppress the charge recombination, which is consistent with the EIS analysis. These findings illustrate that the Cu dopant in the ZnS passivation layer enhances the light absorption range and suppresses recombination.
The deposition of the ZnS layer on the surface of TiO2/CdS can efficiently reduce the charge recombination process at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte (Fig. 3). However, the Cu2+ doping in the ZnS layer exerts two main effects on the performance of the QDSSC: (1) it creates midgap levels in the ZnS that generate the large number of electrons at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, which increase the light harvesting, and (2) it suppresses electron recombination which has a beneficial effect on the JSC.

In conclusion, the introduction of Cu2+ dopant in a ZnS passivation layer deposited on TiO2/CdS QDSSCs (TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS) achieved an improvement of nearly 30% or 82% in the PCE (η) as compared to the QDSSCs of TiO2/CdS/ZnS or TiO2/CdS films, respectively. EIS and OCVD techniques confirmed that the Cu–ZnS layer acts as a promising passivation layer for retarding charge recombination and prolonging electron life. Also the Cu–ZnS layer increased the light harvesting to generate a large number of excitons. As a result, the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS based QDSSC achieved appreciably enhanced performance compared to the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS based solar cells; a high VOC of 0.621 V, JSC of 10.49 mA cm−2, FF of 0.515, and η of 3.35% were obtained.
Experimental section
QDSSC fabrication
A paste of anatase TiO2 particles (20 nm, Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) was spread onto conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by the doctor blade method. The samples were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, CdS was deposited on the surface of TiO2 by a facile SILAR process similar to a previously published procedure.18 The passivation layer Cu–ZnS was deposited on the TiO2/CdS by SILAR, using an aqueous solution of 15 mM CuSO4·5H2O and 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O as an cationic precursor, and an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2S as an anionic precursor, with dipping for 2 min in each solution. The as-prepared photoanode was named as the TiO2/CdS/Cu–ZnS photoanode. The QDSSC was assembled using a sandwich of photoanode and CuS as a counter electrode, which were separated by sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix). A DI water:methanol (7:3 by volume) solution was used as a co-solvent of the polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.1 M KCl), and was used to fill the space between the electrodes.
Characterization
The morphologies of the surfaces of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-2400, Hitachi). The crystalline structure of thin films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku). The composition of elements in the samples was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 operated at 1486.6 eV). The optical absorption spectra were obtained by UV-vis spectroscopy (OPTIZEN 3220UV spectrophotometer). Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using an Oriel® IQE-200™. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination with a frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz and 10 mV of AC amplitude.
