    , Accepted 20th January 2016First published on 22nd January 2016AbstractIn this study, a novel visible-light-sensitive Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite photocatalyst was controllably synthesized through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. The Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite exhibited a perfect nest-like hierarchical microsphere structure, which was constructed by the self-assembly of nanoplates with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The growth mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite and the effect of its structure on its photocatalytic performance was investigated and proposed. Experimental results showed that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites displayed enhanced photocatalytic antifouling activities under visible light irradiation compared to pure Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 exhibited the best photocatalytic antifouling performance, and almost all (99.99%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria were killed within 30 min. Moreover, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite exhibited excellent stability and reusability in the cycled experiments. The photocatalytic antifouling mechanism was proposed based on the active species trapping experiments, revealing that the photo-induced holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) could attack the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane directly and lead to the death of bacteria. The obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite could be mainly attributed to the formation of heterojunctions, accelerating the separation of photo-induced electrons and holes. Furthermore, the large BET surface area combined with the wide photoabsorption region further improved the photocatalytic performance of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. This study provides a new strategy to develop novel composite photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performance for marine antifouling and water purification.
1. Introduction
Natural and artificial substrata in the marine environment are quickly colonized by marine micro and macroorganisms in a process known as “biofouling”.1–3 In previous decades, marine biofouling has become a serious problem worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses, great energy waste, serious security risks to marine project facilities, and harmful ecological destruction around the world.4,5 To date, the most effective method for biofouling control is using toxic antifouling coatings on the surface of marine installations such as tributyltin (TBT), cuprous oxide and organic compounds.4,5 However, almost all these conventional antifouling paints are contaminants to the ecological environment and have strong biotoxicity, leading to a serious marine ecological crisis.4–8 Recently, TBT, tin-based and copper-based antifouling paints, have been banned from use worldwide.4–8 Therefore, there is an urgent and essential need to develop novel, efficient, safe, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly marine antifouling materials and techniques to prevent the harm caused by marine biofouling.1,3,5
Currently, a novel and green photocatalysis technology based on semiconductors, which facilitates the conversion of clean solar energy into chemical energy, has attracted considerable interest for its potential applications in the degradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen production from water and disinfection.9–13 In addition, as a promising alternative for solar energy utilization, photocatalysis has been regarded not only as a cost-effective technology, but also as a highly efficient method to completely decompose organisms into harmless chemicals.9–13 Moreover, during the photocatalytic process, the excited electrons (e−) and photo-induced holes (h+) on the surface of the semiconductor will react with water or air to generate active oxidative species (h+, ˙OH and ˙O2−).9–13 These oxidative radicals can attack the marine fouling microorganisms directly and then decompose them completely,14–17 restricting the formation of biofilms on the surface of marine facilities and thus preventing further biofouling. Therefore, the prospect of applying photocatalysis technology in marine antifouling and water purification has a bright potential.
To date, TiO2 has been the most popular catalyst in photocatalysis owing to its good photocatalytic activity, good chemical stability, non-toxicity, and low cost.18–20 Since Matsunaga and coworkers21 firstly reported the high photocatalytic performance of TiO2 for disinfection under ultraviolet light (UV) light, estimating the photocatalytic antibacterial activity of TiO2 has aroused extensive interest. TiO2 is demonstrated to exhibit excellent antibacterial performance against Escherichia coli,22Staphylococcus aureus,23Lactobacillus,24 sulfate reducing bacteria,25Pseudomonas aeruginosa,26 and algae.27 However, the large band gap, UV-only response and low quantum efficiency of TiO2 greatly inhibit its utilization of solar energy, which dramatically limits the practical applications of TiO2.18–20 Consequently, researchers are paying much attention towards developing novel visible-light responsive photocatalysts and composites that can harness solar energy efficiently and promote the rapid separation of charge carriers.28–34 Among the various reported photocatalysts, bismuth-based materials, such as Bi2O3,29 Bi2S3,30 BiVO4,31 Bi2WO6,32 Bi2MoO6,33 and BiOX (X = Cl, Br, and I),34 have received widespread attention due to their particular layered structures, chemical and thermal stabilities, non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, and excellent photocatalytic activities.28–34 In addition, in view of the interaction between the Bi (6s) and O (2p) orbitals at the top of the valence band, most bismuth-based materials show a strong response to visible light,35–37 which gives rise to excellent photocatalytic activity.
As one of the typical Aurivillius oxides, Bi2WO6 is a typical n-type semiconductor, with a direct band gap of about 2.8 eV, which has generated extensive interest due to its excellent intrinsic physical and chemical properties and photocatalytic activity.32,35–39 Furthermore, since Kudo and coauthors40 reported its high photocatalytic performance for O2 evolution in AgNO3 solution under visible light irradiation, a variety of Bi2WO6 materials have been developed as visible-light-driven photocatalysts in the degradation of organic pollutants, water splitting and disinfection.32,35–40 However, the rapid recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and the relatively narrow absorption region of pure Bi2WO6 greatly restrict its photocatalytic activity.32,35–40 Therefore, to accelerate the separation of photoinduced charge carriers and further enhance the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6, Bi2WO6-based composite photocatalysts are constructed with narrow band-gap semiconductors with appropriate band positions.41–44 Tian et al.41 reported a Bi2WO6/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructure with an enhanced UV, visible and near-infrared photocatalytic activity, realizing the effective utilization of solar energy. Peng et al.42 prepared a novel one-dimensional (1D) Bi2O3 nanorod-Bi2WO6 nanosheet p–n junction photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic activity than single Bi2O3 nanorods or Bi2WO6 flowers; the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol under solar/visible light reached 100% within 60 min. Rauf and coworkers43 developed a robust single-step hydrothermal synthesis for the formation of hierarchically structured heterocatalysts of Bi2S3/Bi2WO6 with high yield (>95%); the heterocatalysts exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the removal of toxic Cr(VI) ions under visible light irradiation. Recently, our group prepared a Bi2WO6/BiOI heterojunction photocatalyst44 based on a chemical etching method for photocatalytic antifouling, which exhibited obviously enhanced photocatalytic antifouling performance under visible light irradiation compared to pure Bi2WO6 and pure BiOI.
On the other hand, as a typical n-type semiconductor with a narrow band gap (Eg = 2.3 eV) and excellent visible-light responsive ability, BiVO4 exhibits fantastic photocatalytic activity and is widely used in photocatalysis.31,45–47 Especially, BiVO4 has been proved to be an effective visible-light-driven photocatalyst in the inactivation of Escherichia coli.46 However, limited by the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in pure BiVO4, crystal facet engineering47 and coupling with other semiconductors (BiVO4/TiO2,48 BiVO4/Bi2S3,49 BiVO4/Bi2O3,50 BiVO4/BiOCl,51 and BiVO4/BiOI52) are usually used to further enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4. Therefore, given the abovementioned background and the matching band edges, BiVO4 is an appropriate material to combine with Bi2WO6 to establish a composite with enhanced photocatalytic antifouling performance. Zhang et al.53 firstly reported the preparation of a Bi2WO6/BiVO4 heterojunction with higher photocatalytic activity than the individual components under visible light irradiation; 81% of phenol was degraded in 6 h, indicating that the combination of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 could obviously enhance the photocatalytic activity of pure Bi2WO6. Subsequently, Chaiwichian et al.,54 Xue et al.55 and Fan et al.56 prepared Bi2WO6/BiVO4 heterojunction photocatalysts via different preparation methods, and these displayed enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of dyes. In addition, in our previous report,57 a calcined Bi2WO6/BiVO4 heterojunction photocatalyst with a multilayer plate-like structure was synthesized via a hydrothermal-calcination method and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB; the degradation efficiency reached 100% within 30 min.
However, although the study of BiVO4/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions with improved photocatalytic activity has attracted the broad attention of researchers, considering the fact that the morphological diversity of inorganic materials has a significant impact on their functional diversification and potential applications, there is still a huge potential to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite by optimizing the preparation process to control its structure, morphology and surface properties. Moreover, a complete and detailed explanation of the growth mechanism and the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism of Bi2WO6/BiVO4 is lacking in previous studies. Furthermore, the application range of Bi2WO6/BiVO4 is limited to the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes and pollutants at present; therefore, it is necessary to extend its application areas to brighten the prospects of Bi2WO6/BiVO4 in photocatalysis.
In this study, a novel Bi2WO6/BiOI composite photocatalyst with a perfect nest-like hierarchical microsphere structure was controllably synthesized through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, and was further used in photocatalytic antifouling. The growth mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite was presented according to controllable preparation experiments. Moreover, the effects of the BiVO4 content on the structure and photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts were investigated in detail. In addition, the photocatalytic antifouling activities, broad-spectrum antibacterial performance and reusability of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites were evaluated and compared by the photocatalytic disinfection of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus under visible light irradiation. In addition, the destruction process of the bacterial cells was studied and observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic antifouling was proposed based on trapping experiments and calculated energy bands.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Na2WO4·2H2O, NH4VO3, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), isopropanol (IPA), 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPOL), sodium oxalate, glutaraldehyde, nutrient agar, tryptone, acridine orange (AO), and other chemicals were all of analytical grade and were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Analytical reagent grade yeast extract was purchased from Oxoid Basingstoke Hampshire (England). All aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (Millipore, USA). The strain employed in this study was the typical marine fouling microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Moreover, the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were also selected as model microorganisms to evaluate the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance. The bacteria were obtained from the Key Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Qingdao, China). Natural seawater collected from Huiquan Bay (Huanghai Sea, Qingdao, China) was used after sterilization by autoclaving for 20 min at 121 °C at 0.1 MPa and filtration through a membrane filter (0.22 μm pore-size).
2.2. Preparation of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts
The Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method based on our previous study.57 In a typical procedure, 3.0 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added to 30 mL of 2.0 M nitric acid under magnetic stirring to obtain transparent solution A. Moreover, appropriate amounts of Na2WO4·2H2O and NH4VO3 (W/V molar ratios were 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, and 1:1 for the synthesis of Bi2WO6/BiVO4 with different molar ratios) were dissolved in 30 mL of 2.0 M NaOH solution under magnetic stirring, and then 0.5 g of PVP was added into the solution under continuous stirring to form homogeneous mixture B. Subsequently, mixture B was subsequently added dropwise to solution A slowly under vigorous stirring to form a final suspension, the pH value of which was then adjusted to 7.0 with 2.0 M NH3·H2O. The suspension was stirred for another 60 min and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, maintained at 160 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature naturally. The yellow precipitates were collected and washed several times with Milli-Q water and absolute ethanol, respectively. Then, the samples were dried at 60 °C in air for 6 h. The final composite products were denoted as Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.25, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.5, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.75, and Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1.
Pure Bi2WO6 and pure BiVO4 were prepared under the same conditions described above as controls. To investigate the growth mechanism of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, samples subjected to hydrothermal treatment for 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h were also collected, with the other conditions fixed.
2.3. Characterization
The crystal structures of the as-prepared samples were recorded by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer (Japan) under the following conditions: 40 kV, 30 mA, and graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The structures and morphologies of the as-prepared samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 field-emission transmission electron microscope (Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for elemental analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) equipped with an Al-anode at a total power dissipation of 150 W (15 kV, 10 mA), and the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.60 eV from adventitious carbon. The specific surface areas of the samples were measured on the basis of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation with a nitrogen adsorption instrument (ST-08A, China) at 77 K after pretreatment at 473 K for 2 h. UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) of the samples were obtained using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100, Japan) with BaSO4 as a reference.
2.4. Culture of bacteria
In this study, P. aeruginosa was chosen as a model marine fouling microorganism for antibacterial experiments. E. coli and S. aureus were used to assess the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance. All apparatus and materials were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min before each microbiological experiment and all antibacterial tests were carried out in triplicate. Normally, P. aeruginosa was firstly incubated in Luria–Bertani (LB) nutrient solution at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 150 rpm. Then, the bacteria were separated by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterilized seawater several times. The collected cells were diluted to the desired concentration or optical density in sterilized seawater. Bacterial cell numbers were estimated by the spread plate method, and the final suspension concentration was around 8.5 × 108 colony forming units (cfu mL−1). The stock suspensions of E. coli (3.0 × 108 cfu mL−1) and S. aureus (3.0 × 108 cfu mL−1) were also prepared by the abovementioned operations with sterilized phosphate buffer as the diluted solution.
2.5. Photocatalytic antifouling experiments
The photocatalytic antifouling experiments were carried out using a 500 W Xe lamp as the light source with a 420 nm cutoff filter. A quartz glass container was used as the reaction vessel and was jacketed with water circulation to maintain room temperature; the suspension was stirred with a magnetic stirrer throughout the reaction. Typically, 50 mg of photocatalyst was added to 49.5 mL of sterilized natural seawater or PBS, and 500 μL of bacterial suspension was subsequently added. Prior to illumination, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure an adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the bacterial cells. Then, the suspension was sequentially stirred and exposed to light irradiation. At given time intervals, 1 mL of the bacteria suspension was withdrawn and serially diluted with sterilized seawater or PBS. Then, 100 μL of the diluted sample suspension was immediately spread on LB agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to determine the number of viable cells (in cfu). For comparison, control experiments were conducted along with the treatment experiments. The blank control was conducted without adding photocatalysts in bacterial suspension under visible light irradiation, and the reaction system without visible light irradiation was used as a dark control. The survival rate was determined as follows: survival rate (%) = (Nsurvivor/Ncontrol) × 100, where Ncontrol and Nsurvivor are the numbers of viable cells in the blank control and after each photocatalytic reaction, respectively. Therefore, the antibacterial rate could be defined as follows: antibacterial rate (%) = 100 − survival rate.
The survival status and morphology changes of P. aeruginosa were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX-51 with cellSens image software, Japan), FESEM (Hitachi S-4800) and TEM (JEOL JEM-1200), respectively. The details of the operations are shown in the ESI.†
2.6. Analysis of active species
The active species generated in the photocatalytic reaction were detected by adding scavengers to the reaction solutions, in which the concentrations of IPA (a scavenger of hydroxyl radical, ˙OH), of TEMPOL (a scavenger of superoxide radical, ˙O2−), and sodium oxalate (a scavenger of holes, h+) were 10 mM, 2 mM and 10 mM, respectively.58 At given time intervals, 1 mL of the reaction solution was collected and then serially diluted to the required concentration. Then, 100 μL of the diluted solution was immediately spread on LB agar medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The number of viable cells was determined by the plate count method. For comparison, control experiments were carried out with scavenger alone in bacterial suspension under visible light irradiation to eliminate the toxic effect to the bacteria.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and surface composition
The crystal phase structure, crystallinity and purity of the as-prepared samples were examined by XRD measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Bi2WO6, BiVO4, and Bi2WO6/BiVO4 with different molar ratios. All the samples displayed narrow and sharp diffraction peaks, indicating the high crystallinity of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1, all the diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6 can be indexed to orthorhombic phase Bi2WO6 with lattice constants of a = 5.456 Å, b = 5.436 Å, and c = 16.426 Å, which are in good agreement with the reported data (JCPDS no. 73-1126). In addition, the diffraction peaks of BiVO4 matched very well with the monoclinic structure of BiVO4. The cell constants of BiVO4 were calculated to be a = 5.195 Å, b = 11.701 Å, and c = 5.092 Å, which are consistent with the literature values (JCPDS no. 14-0688). In addition, the addition of surface active agent PVP during the preparation process suppressed the formation of other crystalline phases and led to the generation of a single monoclinic crystal phase of BiVO4.59 As for the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites, all the characteristic diffraction peaks can be well indexed to monoclinic phase BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 14-0688) and orthorhombic phase Bi2WO6 (JCPDS no. 73-1126), indicating that Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 were successfully composited. Furthermore, with increasing amounts of BiVO4, the relative intensities of the corresponding diffraction peaks of BiVO4 strengthened gradually. In addition, there were no significant shifts in the principal diffraction peaks occurring in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites, implying that BiVO4 existed as a separate phase rather than being incorporated into the Bi2WO6 lattice. No peaks of other impurities were observed in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites.

To further investigate the surface compositions and the oxidation states of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, XPS analysis was typically performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(A)–(E). The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing C 1s to 284.60 eV. As observed in the typical XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2(A)), only Bi, W, V, O, and C elements were detected on the surfaces of the samples, whereas the C 1s peak at around 284.6 eV could be attributed to the signal from carbon contained in the instrument and was used for calibration.50,51,60,61Fig. 2(B) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Bi 4f. The peaks with binding energies at about 159.0 eV and 164.0 eV were assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, confirming that the bismuth species in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite were in the form of Bi3+.50,51,60,61 Moreover, it can be observed that the Bi 4f7/2 region could be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 158.3 eV and 159.3 eV, indicating that there were two types of Bi ions in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite.50,51,60,61 Considering that the binding energy of Bi 4f7/2 in pure Bi2WO6 exists in the range of 158–159 eV41,60,61 and that in BiVO4 exists in the range of 159–160 eV,50,51 the peak at 158.3 eV could be ascribed to Bi3+ in Bi2WO6, whereas the peak at 159.3 eV could originate from Bi3+ in BiVO4. Moreover, the Bi 4f5/2 region could be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 163.7 eV and 164.9 eV, which also demonstrated the existence of two types of Bi ions in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite.50,51,60,61 According to previous reports that the binding energy of Bi 4f7/2 in pure Bi2WO6 exists in the range of 163–164 eV41,60,61 and that in BiVO4 exists in the range of 164–165 eV,50,51 the peak at 163.7 eV could be ascribed to Bi3+ in Bi2WO6, whereas the peak at 164.9 eV could originate from Bi3+ in BiVO4. However, the binding energy values in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite are different from that of pure Bi2WO6 or pure BiVO4 due to changes in the local environment and electron density of the elements in the interfacial structure.41,50,51,60,61
 Fig. 2  XPS spectra of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1: survey spectrum (A), high resolution spectra of Bi 4f (B), W 4f (C), V 2p (D), and O 1s (E). 
As shown in Fig. 2(C), the two peaks located at 34.1 eV and 36.2 eV can be assigned to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively, suggesting that W existed in the W6+ oxidation state.61 The V 2p orbital showed splitting peaks at binding energies of approximately 523.5 and 515.9 eV (Fig. 2(D)), which were assigned to the V 2p1/2 orbital and V 2p3/2 orbital, respectively, corresponding to the surface V5+ in the composite.50,51 It is well known that the O 1s peak is broad and complicated due to the existence of several types of nonequivalent lattice O atoms. In Fig. 2(E), the O 1s region could be divided into two peaks at about 529.3 and 531.2 eV, which could be attributed to the oxygen species of lattice oxygen (O2−) of Bi2O22+ and that of hydroxyl oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the composite, respectively.41,50,51,60,61 Therefore, the XPS results verified the existence of BiVO4 along with Bi2WO6 in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite, which is in good accordance with the XRD analysis.
3.2. Morphology and microstructure
The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared samples were investigated by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 3(A), the pure Bi2WO6 samples were flower-like microspheres with diameters of about 1 μm. These flower-like microspheres possessed superstructures assembled hierarchically from many two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates with a thickness of about 20 nm and an average side length of about 100 nm. Fig. 3(B) shows that the shape of the pure BiVO4 samples had irregular rod-like structures with an average size of about 1 μm, and some leaf-like shaped products were also observed. As for the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites, a number of uniform and hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) microspheres can be observed in Fig. 3(C)–(F), ranging from 1 to 4 μm in diameter, which are constructed from various thin 2D nanoplates. However, the morphologies of these composites were different from each other due to the different contents of BiVO4 in the composites. Compared to the loose flower-like structure of pure Bi2WO6, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.25 composites exhibited uniform underdeveloped flower-like structures (resembling pancakes) with an average size of about 2 μm (Fig. 3(C)). It can be clearly observed that each “pancake” is assembled from many nanoplates with a thickness of about 20 nm and an average side length of about 100 nm and has a concave structure with several perpendicular nanoplates at its center (inset in Fig. 3(C)). The imperfect pancake-like structures were commonly observed during the formation of the flower-like structures,59,62 and could further evolve into the perfect flower-like structures. Thus, as the BiVO4 content in the composite increased, more nanoplates accumulated in the pancake-like structures and bigger flower-like structures were tightly constructed from these thin nanoplates, as shown in Fig. 3(D) and (E). In addition, as the content of BiVO4 increased further, a more perfect and tighter nest-like structure of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 was observed in Fig. 3(F), which was derived from the sequential assembling of the flower-like microsphere from an increasing number of nanoplates. These tiny nanoplates were attached side by side into integrated sheets and aligned to the spherical surface with clearly oriented layers, pointing toward a common center, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(F). In addition, it can be observed that the size of the composites increased along with increasing BiVO4 content in the composite, and the average size of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 nest-like structure was about 4 μm. Therefore, based on the FESEM results, it can be deduced that the flower-like microspheres were composed of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 nanoplates; Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 grew together with the assistance of PVP to form nanoplates and further led to the construction of hierarchical nest-like structures by the accumulation of the well-ordered and oriented nanoplates. These results indicated that the morphology and microstructure of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites could be facilely adjusted by controlling the molar ratio of the two constituents.

To obtain more detailed information about the crystalline structure of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, TEM, HRTEM and SAED characterizations were conducted. The low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 4(A)) presents the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite as a nest-like hierarchical morphology, assembled from thin nanoplates, which is consistent with the FESEM results. Fig. 4(B) shows the enlarged TEM image of the area marked by an orange rectangle in Fig. 4(A), showing the thin nanoplates around the sides of the microsphere. Moreover, the SAED pattern of this part (inset of Fig. 4(B)) shows arc-like symmetry spots rather than a diffraction ring, which confirms that the structure of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite was polycrystalline in nature and that the nest-like microspheres consisted of single-crystal subunits.59,63–66Fig. 4(C) shows the HRTEM image of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite corresponding to the orange square region displayed in Fig. 4(B), in which the interface of orthorhombic Bi2WO6 and that of monoclinic BiVO4 could be clearly observed. Moreover, the HRTEM image reveals the highly crystalline nature of the composite. By measuring the lattice fringes, it was found that the interplanar distances at 0.272 nm and 0.292 nm agreed well with the fringe spacing of the (200) lattice plane of Bi2WO6 and the (040) lattice plane of BiVO4,41,50,51,59 which is in good accordance with the XRD results. Therefore, it is apparent that a well-defined heterojunction structure was formed between Bi2WO6 and BiVO4.

To further investigate the chemical composition and element distribution of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, TEM-EDX elemental mapping was performed when operating the TEM in scanning mode (STEM). Fig. 4(D) shows a TEM-EDX image of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, from which strong signals of Bi, W, V, and O elements could be clearly observed without exhibiting other elements, confirming the presence of Bi, W, V, and O elements in the composite. In addition, quantitative results gave the atomic ratio of Bi:W:V:O in Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 as 20:7:6:67, which coincided well with the theoretical molar ratio of 1:1 for Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 in Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, considering instrumental error. Therefore, the EDX results are in good agreement with the XPS analysis, indicating that Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 composited with the molar ratio 1:1 in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. The STEM mapping images shown in the inset of Fig. 4(D) clearly reveal that the Bi, O, W, and V elements were distributed uniformly and had the same shapes and locations in the composite, confirming the existence of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. Therefore, these results gave solid evidence that Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 were successfully composited together and had assembled to form a hierarchical nest-like structure.
3.3. Growth mechanism
To reveal the formation process of the nest-like Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 hierarchical microspheres, products formed at different growth stages were collected and determined by XRD and FESEM. At the initial stage of the reaction, numerous small nanoparticles with irregular sizes and morphologies were formed when the solutions were mixed together, as presented in Fig. 5(A). However, these products exhibited weak peaks according to the XRD patterns (Fig. 6), indicating their poor crystalline and amorphous characteristics. After hydrothermal treatment for 2 h (Fig. 5(B)), these primary nanocrystals tended to aggregate together to form imperfect microspheres with a diameter of about 2 μm, along with many aggregated nanoparticles. Moreover, it can be observed that some nanoparticles gradually transformed to 2D nanoplates. Moreover, the peaks shown in Fig. 6 can be ambiguously designated as the orthorhombic phased Bi2WO6, indicating that Bi2WO6 would crystallize and precipitate first at the initial reaction stage. On the other hand, there was a competition between nucleation and crystallization in Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 in the reaction, slowing down the formation of flower-like Bi2WO6 microspheres compared to previous reports.56 Then, BiVO4 nanoparticles gradually crystallized and precipitated during the reaction process and formed 2D nanoplates in an additional crystallization process. Subsequently, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 grew together. When the reaction time increased to 6 h, some hierarchical, largely flower-like microspheres with a diameter of about 3 μm gradually appeared with the disappearance of the small nanoparticles under the Ostwald ripening process (Fig. 5(C)). It is apparent that these hierarchical flower-like microspheres were assembled from many thin nanoplates, which interconnected with each other and aligned with clearly oriented layers, pointing toward a common center. Thus, concave structures were formed on the top of these microspheres. Moreover, some weak peaks can be observed in Fig. 6, which can be indexed to monoclinic phase BiVO4, confirming the existence of BiVO4 during the reaction process. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of Bi2WO6 became sharp and strong, indicating that the crystal structure of the composite gradually tended toward completion. When the reaction time was further elongated to 12 h, the number of layers on the flower-like microspheres gradually increased, whereas the size of the concave structures at the top of the microspheres decreased; the nest-like microspheres constructed from many more compactly packed nanoplates can be observed in Fig. 5(D). Furthermore, the XRD patterns in Fig. 6 show that all the characteristic diffraction peaks can be well indexed to monoclinic phase BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 14-0688) and orthorhombic phase Bi2WO6 (JCPDS no. 73-1126), and the diffraction peaks of BiVO4 became stronger as the reaction time increased, confirming the coexistence of BiVO4 and Bi2WO6 at this stage. Finally, the perfect and tight nest-like microspheres with a diameter of about 4 μm were obtained when the reaction was further prolonged to 24 h (Fig. 5(E)); these were also assembled from many thin and tiny nanoplates. In addition, the morphology and XRD pattern of the products obtained at 36 h are almost the same as those obtained at 24 h, as shown in Fig. 5(F) and 6, proving that further prolonging the reaction time did not influence the crystallization process of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, leading to no significant change in the morphology and crystal structure.
 Fig. 5  FESEM images of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 obtained at different reaction times: (A) 0 h, (B) 2 h, (C) 6 h, (D) 12 h, (E) 24 h, and (F) 36 h. 
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 obtained at different reaction times. 
Therefore, based on the abovementioned analysis, combined with the crystal structure and chemical composition results, the growth mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 nest-like hierarchical microspheres was proposed and is presented in Scheme 1. It was a typical Ostwald ripening process, and the crystal anisotropy and the face-inhibitor function of PVP played key roles in the formation of nest-like hierarchical microspheres via selective adsorption on various crystallographic planes to partially passivate the surfaces of the crystals.59,66 Initially, when the solution containing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and HNO3 was mixed with the solution containing Na2WO4·2H2O, NH4VO3 and PVP, many irregular nanoparticles appeared, which would further serve as seeds for anisotropic growth in the subsequent process via the Ostwald ripening mechanism.59,62–66 Then, the polymer molecule, PVP, would be absorbed on these nanoparticles. Driven by the minimization of the total energy of the system and by van der Waals interactions between the polymer molecules,59,64 these small primary nanocrystals would aggregate into spherical structures with many PVP molecules absorbed on their surfaces after hydrothermal treatment for 2 h, which would provide many high-energy sites for nanocrystalline growth. However, there was a competition between nucleation and crystallization in Bi2WO6 and BiVO4, which resulted in a different formation order. According to the XRD analysis shown in Fig. 6, Bi2WO6 crystallized and precipitated first at the initial reaction stage. Then, the crystallization of Bi2WO6 began from these nucleation sites on the surface, anchoring spontaneously with PVP. Moreover, the microspheres gradually grew inside the unstructured polymer aggregates and subsequently dissolved the nanocrystal from the inner side of the aggregates toward the outside. Moreover, these nanoparticles tended to grow into 2D nanoplates due to the Ostwald ripening process and the high intrinsic anisotropic properties of Bi2WO6.59,62–66 The further crystal growth of Bi2WO6 was strongly related to the intrinsic crystal structure of Bi2WO6. Orthorhombic Bi2WO6 is constructed from a corner-shared WO6 octahedral layer and [Bi2O2]2+ atom layers sandwiched between WO6 octahedral layers, and is parallel to the (001) facets.66 Thus, the (200) and (020) facets have much higher chemical potentials than other facets, leading to faster growth of the (200) and (020) facets along the layer. Then, the crystallization of 2D Bi2WO6 nanoplates began from these nucleation sites on the surface, anchoring spontaneously with PVP. The free PVP polymer molecules would preferentially be absorbed on the primary nanoplates and functioned as potential crystal face inhibitors; they formed polymer interlayers on the nanoplates and benefited the formation of oriented nucleation.59,66 On the other hand, BiVO4 gradually crystallized and precipitated during the reaction process, and then also formed 2D nanoplates in a further crystallization process due to its high anisotropy. As a result, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 would then grow together with the assistance of the Ostwald ripening process and PVP.
 Scheme 1  Growth mechanism of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 nest-like hierarchical microspheres. 
When the reaction time was extended further, the spherical aggregates further dissolved and recrystallized, and these tiny nanoplates gradually self-assembled in an edge-to-edge fashion by an oriented attachment process, during which the as-formed nanoplates gradually bent outward due to the growth of new nanoplates in the spaces.59,62–66 Thus, the shape of the composite gradually evolved to 3D hierarchical flower-like microspheres that were concave on the top. As the reaction time was sequentially elongated, more new tilted nanoplates were generated on the notched flower-like microspheres. Then, the number of layers on the flower-like microspheres gradually increased, further leading to the thickening of the microspheres. Finally, the flower-like microspheres further evolved to perfect and tight nest-like microspheres with a smaller concave, which were constructed from many well-ordered and oriented nanoplates. Therefore, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 nest-like hierarchical microspheres were obtained by self-assembly of the in situ formed nanoplates with the assistance of PVP.
3.4. BET analysis
The BET specific surface area is considered to be an important influencing factor in the photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst, and it can be measured by a nitrogen adsorption method. Therefore, the BET specific surface areas were determined as 12.83 m2 g−1, 7.51 m2 g−1, 14.94 m2 g−1, 17.98 m2 g−1, 22.13 m2 g−1, and 26.53 m2 g−1 for Bi2WO6, BiVO4, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.25, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.5, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.75, and Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, respectively. Clearly, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites exhibited much higher BET specific surface areas than pure Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. In addition, for the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites, the BET specific surface areas increase as the content of BiVO4 increases, and the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite with the nest-like hierarchical structure displayed the highest BET specific surface area among these photocatalysts. These results coincide well with the morphologies observed in the FESEM images. As is known, a larger BET specific surface area will provide more active sites and better absorption for a photocatalyst, promoting the electron–hole separation efficiency and further enhancing the photocatalytic activity.31,32,67 Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the as-prepared Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 nest-like hierarchical microspheres will show excellent photocatalytic activity.
3.5. Optical absorption property analysis
The photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is mainly determined by its photoabsorption properties and the diffusion of the photo-induced electrons and holes, which are relevant to the energy band structure of the semiconductor. Thus, UV-DRS was used to illustrate the photoabsorption properties of the samples, as can be observed in Fig. 7(A). According to the spectra, both Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 had good optical absorption in visible light, and all of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites showed a strong absorption from the UV light region to the visible light region, implying the possibility of photocatalytic activity over these materials under visible light irradiation. In addition, the absorption edges of the different Bi2WO6/BiVO4 samples were gradually red-shifted with increasing BiVO4 content due to the strong visible light response of BiVO4, and Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 presented the best visible-light absorption properties. These results further confirmed the existence of BiVO4 in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite, and the introduction of BiVO4 in Bi2WO6 greatly improved the visible-light absorption properties of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite. In addition, for a crystalline semiconductor, the band gap energy can be calculated based on the spectra by the equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2,31,32 where α, h, ν, Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, the Planck constant, the light frequency, the band gap, and a constant, respectively. Among these, the value of n depends on the type of optical transition of the semiconductor (n = 1 for a direct transition and n = 4 for an indirect transition). As a direct transition semiconductor, the n value of both Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 is 1.31,32 From the plot of (αhν)2versus hν in Fig. 7(B), the Eg of Bi2WO6, BiVO4, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.25, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.5, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-0.75, and Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 were calculated to be 2.70 eV, 2.30 eV, 2.18 eV, 2.14 eV, 2.12 eV, and 2.07 eV, respectively. Thus, the results indicated that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite had a wider photoabsorption region and more suitable band gap, making it a potential candidate as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst.

3.6. Photocatalytic antifouling performance
The photocatalytic antifouling performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated by their antibacterial activities toward the marine fouling microorganism P. aeruginosa (8.5 × 106 cfu mL−1) under visible light irradiation. As observed in Fig. 8(A), the blank control experiment (without photocatalyst under visible light irradiation) shows an almost negligible loss of P. aeruginosa. The dark control test (with photocatalyst in the dark) also displayed a negligible effect on P. aeruginosa, indicating the non-toxicity of the photocatalysts to P. aeruginosa. However, when irradiated by visible light, the as-prepared samples exhibited high photocatalytic antifouling activities. It can be observed in Fig. 8(A) that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites revealed obviously enhanced photocatalytic antifouling activities in comparison with pure Bi2WO6 and pure BiVO4 in the temporal course of the P. aeruginosa survival curve. In addition, with the increase of the BiVO4 molar ratio in the composite, the photocatalytic antifouling properties of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites improved apparently, indicating that the introduction of BiVO4 into Bi2WO6 significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activities of the composite. Among the as-prepared composites, Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 exhibited the best photocatalytic antifouling activity; only about 2.1 log of P. aeruginosa survived after 30 min reaction, compared with about 6.9 log of P. aeruginosa before the reaction. Furthermore, almost all of the bacterial cells were killed as the reaction time was extended to 60 min. In addition, Fig. 8(B) displays that the antibacterial rate of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 could achieve 99.99% after 30 min of reaction, far exceeding the rates of pure Bi2WO6, pure BiVO4 and the other Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites. Furthermore, compared to other reported antifouling photocatalysts (details of the antibacterial activities are shown in Table S1 in the ESI†), such as TiO2,23 Ag@TiO2,25 BiVO4,46 Bi2WO6,68 Ag2S/Bi2S3,69 Bi2O2CO3/Bi3NbO7,70 and AgBr-Ag-Bi2WO6,71 the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite photocatalyst in this study also showed superior photocatalytic antifouling activity. Furthermore, the fluorescence microscopy images of P. aeruginosa during the photocatalytic process for the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite further demonstrated the excellent photocatalytic antifouling performance of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite under visible light irradiation (Fig. S1†).

Therefore, the abovementioned results revealed the superior and enhanced photocatalytic antifouling performance of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite, which could be mainly attributed to the formation of heterostructures between Bi2WO6 and BiVO4, accelerating the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. Furthermore, a large BET surface area (26.53 m2 g−1) due to the superior structure that contained more active sites, combined with the wide photoabsorption region, further gave rise to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, making it a potential marine antifouling material in practical applications.
3.7. Destruction process of bacterial cells
To visually investigate the destruction process of the bacterial cells in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 photocatalytic system under visible light irradiation, the morphology and structure changes of P. aeruginosa at different stages during the photocatalytic reaction were observed by FESEM and TEM. Fig. 9(A) shows a representative FESEM image of untreated P. aeruginosa cells, which have a regular and intact cellular structure with a well-defined cell wall, indicating that the cells are living without any environmental disturbance. After P. aeruginosa cells were mixed with the photocatalyst in the dark for 30 min, it can be observed in Fig. 9(B) that bacterial cells without obvious damage adhered to the surface of the photocatalysts, owing to their large sizes and specific surface areas. The close contact between the bacterial cells and the interface of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 would be beneficial to the antibacterial process.15 When irradiated under visible light for 15 min, significant changes in the morphology and structure of the P. aeruginosa cells can be observed in Fig. 9(C). Flagella existed in some cells compared to the untreated cells due to the stress response, and some cells were subject to mass-missing on the cell wall and the cell membrane, which would further develop as deep ‘holes’. These results verified that P. aeruginosa cells were gradually destroyed during the photocatalytic reaction. The formation of flagella and holes in bacteria is in good agreement with some previous reports.72–75 With further extension of the reaction time to 30 min, the cell structure shows much more severe damage in Fig. 9(D). The cell wall and the cell membrane were greatly ruptured, with even more severe leakage of intracellular components such as K+, indicating that the bacterial cells were completely killed by the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. The destruction progress of P. aeruginosa cells was also observed by TEM; the results are consistent with the FESEM results, as shown in Fig. S2.†
 Fig. 9  FESEM images of untreated P. aeruginosa cells (A) and untreated P. aeruginosa cells in the dark with Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 for 30 min (B), and treated P. aeruginosa cells under visible light irradiation with Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 for 15 min (C) and 30 min (D). 
Therefore, these results indicated that the destruction process of the bacterial cells began from the cell wall and progressed to the cellular components; this could be mainly attributed to the attack of the oxidative active species (˙OH, ˙O2−, and h+) generated during the photocatalytic process.69–75 During the photocatalytic reaction, the oxidative active species would first attack the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterial cell due to the close absorption of bacterial cells on the surface of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1. After the cell wall was ruptured, a large amount of diffusing oxidative active species would enter the cell to further degrade the remaining intracellular components of the cell69–75 and decompose the cell completely. Therefore, these results proved the advantages of this photocatalysis technique, including efficiency, environmental friendliness, and non-secondary pollution.
3.8. Stability and reusability
To evaluate the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst, repeat photocatalytic antifouling experiments for P. aeruginosa (8.5 × 106 cfu mL−1) were conducted using recycled Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 under visible light irradiation. After each cycle, the photocatalysts were collected by centrifuging, washed with Milli-Q water several times, dried, and reused in the next run. It can be observed in Fig. 10(A) that the antibacterial rate did not exhibit significant loss and could reach 99.21% after six successive cycles with each reaction lasting for 30 min, indicating that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite was relatively effective and stable. Although the antibacterial rate decreases from 99.99% to 99.21% after six successive reactions, the antibacterial rate is still higher than 99%, exhibiting good stability and reusability considering the loss of photocatalysts during the recycling process and the absorption of impurities on the photocatalysts. The crystal structure of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 after six circulating runs was analyzed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 10(B). The XRD pattern of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 after six successive photocatalytic reactions revealed that the crystal structure and the intensity of the peaks showed no obvious change after cycled use. In addition, the chemical composition of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 after six cycles was also characterized by EDX. It can be observed from Fig. 10(C) that there was no significant change in the EDX spectra of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 after six uses. The composite showed strong signals of Bi, W, V, and O elements with an atomic ratio of 17:6:5:69 for Bi:W:V:O, which was close to the ideal value of 1:1 for Bi2WO6/BiVO4 considering instrumental error, indicating the good stability of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1. As observed in Fig. 10(D), there was no apparent change in the morphology of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 after six circulating photocatalytic reactions, indicating that the hierarchical nest-like microspheres were stable enough that they were hardly decomposed to disperse nanoplates after longtime use. Therefore, these results indicated that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite exhibited excellent stability and reusability, as well as less photocorrosion, which favors its long-term use in photocatalytic antifouling in a marine environment.

3.9. Broad-spectrum antibacterial performance for E. coli and S. aureus
To assess the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, photocatalytic antibacterial experiments were carried out against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli (3.0 × 106 cfu mL−1) and the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus (3.0 × 106 cfu mL−1) using 1 mg mL−1 Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1. As observed in Fig. 11(A), Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 exhibited superior antibacterial activity compared to pure Bi2WO6 and pure BiVO4. The antibacterial rate for Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 reached 99.99% after 30 min reaction in both the E. coli and S. aureus reaction systems. Furthermore, the blank control experiment (without photocatalyst under visible light irradiation) and the dark control test (with photocatalyst in the dark) showed almost negligible effects on E. coli and S. aureus. Furthermore, the morphology of E. coli and S. aureus before and after the photocatalytic reaction was investigated, as presented in Fig. 11(B)–(E). It can be observed that both the E. coli and S. aureus cells displayed intact cellular structures with well-defined cell walls and good living conditions before the photocatalytic reaction. When irradiated under visible light in the presence of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, the cell walls of both E. coli and S. aureus were destroyed after 30 min reaction, leading to the leakage of the intracellular components and further death of the cells. All the observations indicated that the rupture of the cell walls could be ascribed to the damage of photo-induced oxidative active species in the photocatalytic process, followed by the further degradation of intracellular constituents and finally, the complete decomposition of the bacterial cells. Therefore, the results confirmed the highly efficient and broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite under visible light irradiation, making it a potential application in not only marine antifouling but also other water purification areas.

3.10. Photocatalytic antifouling mechanism
As is known, various active species (˙OH, ˙O2−, and h+) generated during the photocatalytic process played key roles in killing the bacteria. Therefore, to ascertain the dominant active species in the photocatalytic antifouling process, different scavengers were added into the reaction solutions in the presence of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 under visible light irradiation using IPA as an ˙OH scavenger, TEMPOL as an ˙O2− scavenger, and sodium oxalate as an h+ scavenger.58 It can be observed in Fig. 12 that the antibacterial rate for P. aeruginosa reached 99.99% after 30 min reaction by Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 without the addition of a scavenger. In addition, there was no obvious effect on the antibacterial rate with the addition of TEMPOL (a scavenger of ˙O2−), indicating that ˙O2− was not the major active species involved in the photocatalytic antifouling process.57 On the other hand, when IPA (a scavenger of ˙OH) and sodium oxalate (a scavenger of h+) were added, the antibacterial rate for P. aeruginosa decreased apparently in both systems, especially in the solution with sodium oxalate. Thus, ˙OH radicals and h+ were proved to be the dominant active species for Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, playing key roles in the photocatalytic antifouling process. Moreover, the holes are the major contributing factor for the generation of active radicals. Furthermore, the control experiments showed that the addition of the scavengers did not result in any toxic effect to P. aeruginosa within 30 min; the effects were almost negligible.
 Fig. 12  Effects of scavengers on the photocatalytic antibacterial rate of Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 for P. aeruginosa under visible light irradiation. 
To further investigate the enhanced photocatalytic antifouling activity of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 heterojunction, the relative band positions of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 should be confirmed, because the band potential positions play an important part in determining the migration direction of the photogenerated charge carriers in the heterojunction structure.41–44,48–57 The conduction band (CB) edge potential of the semiconductor at the point of zero charge can be calculated by the empirical equation:31,32ECB = χ − EC − 0.5Eg, where χ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms (6.360 eV for Bi2WO632 and 6.035 eV for BiVO431), EC is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), and Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor (Eg is 2.70 and 2.30 eV per NHE for Bi2WO6 and BiVO4, respectively). In addition, the valance band (VB) edge potential can be determined by the equation: EVB = Eg + ECB. Therefore, according to the equations above, the calculated ECB and EVB of Bi2WO6 are 0.51 eV and 3.21 eV per NHE, respectively. Moreover, the calculated ECB and EVB are 0.385 eV and 2.685 eV per NHE for BiVO4, respectively. Thus, a difference in the band potentials exists between the two semiconductors. When Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 were in contact, the heterojunction structure was established, and then an inner electric field was built in the interface,41–44,48–57 leading to the efficient separation of photoinduced electrons and holes between Bi2WO6 and BiVO4.
Therefore, on the basis of the calculated energy bands and the abovementioned results, a possible photocatalytic antifouling mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite was proposed, as shown in Scheme 2. When the composite was illuminated with visible light, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 were excited simultaneously and the electrons (e−) in the VB were excited to the CB, leaving the same amount of holes (h+) on VB in both Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. Moreover, the photoinduced electrons in BiVO4 would be easily injected from the CB of BiVO4 to the CB of Bi2WO6 due to the more negative CB of BiVO4 compared to that of Bi2WO6. On the other hand, because of the lower VB of Bi2WO6 compared to that of BiVO4, the holes on the VB of Bi2WO6 will transfer to that of BiVO4. Therefore, an efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes accrued on the n–n heterojunction, which could greatly reduce the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers.41–44,48–57 Consequently, more separated photogenerated electrons and holes were then free to initiate reactions with the reactants adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to pure Bi2WO6 and pure BiVO4. These results are consistent with some previous studies on the transition of photo-induced charge carriers between semiconductors.41–44,48–57
 Scheme 2  Photocatalytic antifouling mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. 
In addition, because the ECB value of Bi2WO6 (0.51 eV per NHE) is more positive than the redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.046 eV per NHE),44,50,58 the electrons located on the CB of Bi2WO6 could not reduce O2 to yield ˙O2−. However, the two-electron reduction of O2 to form H2O2 could occur on Bi2WO6 because the ECB value of Bi2WO6 (0.51 eV per NHE) is more negative than the redox potentials of O2/H2O2 (0.70 eV per NHE) and H2O2/˙OH (0.71 eV per NHE).76 Therefore, the electrons located on the CB of Bi2WO6 could react with O2 to form H2O2 and, finally, form ˙OH. These ˙OH radicals would further attack the bacterial cells and lead to the destruction of the cells. At the same time, the EVB value of BiVO4 (2.685 eV per NHE) was much more positive than the standard redox potentials of ˙OH/OH− (1.99 eV per NHE) and OH−/˙OH (2.38 eV per NHE),44,50,58 exhibiting a strong oxidative ability. Thus, the photo-induced holes could oxidize H2O or OH− to form ˙OH radicals, which would further attack the bacterial cells and then lead to the destruction of the cells. Moreover, the photo-induced holes could oxidize the bacterial cells directly. Therefore, based on the active species trapping experiments and the analysis of redox potentials, it can be deduced that holes are the major contributors for the generation of active radicals. As shown in Scheme 2, when the bacterial cells were in contact with Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1, numerous cells were absorbed on the surface of the composite due to its large BET specific surface area. Then, the photoinduced holes combined with ˙OH radicals would attack the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane directly, leading to severe rupture of the cell wall and release of the interior components, which would also facilitate the entry of ˙OH radicals to further damage the interior DNA molecules, degrade the remaining intracellular components,70–75 and then decompose the cell completely. Therefore, the photoinduced holes and ˙OH radicals were demonstrated to play major roles in the photocatalytic antibacterial process of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite. The efficient separation of photoinduced electrons and holes due to the formation of a heterojunction, combined with the large BET specific surface area and wide photoabsorption region, led to the excellent and enhanced photocatalytic antifouling performance of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The growth mechanism of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composite was studied by XRD and FESEM, revealing that the nest-like hierarchical microspheres were constructed by the self-assembly of nanoplates with the assistance of PVP under anisotropic growth and Ostwald ripening processes. The different BiVO4 contents in the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites resulted in different morphologies, surface properties and even photocatalytic activities. Photocatalytic antifouling experiments showed that the Bi2WO6/BiVO4 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities compared to pure Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. Especially, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite showed the best photocatalytic antifouling performance, and almost all (99.99%) of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus could be killed within 30 min. Moreover, the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite exhibited excellent stability and long-time reusability. The antibacterial process was observed by FESEM and TEM, indicating that the death of the bacteria could be mainly ascribed to the attack of photoinduced radicals on the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, leading to the rupture of cell wall. Based on active species trapping experiments, a possible photocatalytic antifouling mechanism was proposed, and ˙OH radicals and h+ were proved to play key roles in the photocatalytic reaction. The obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6/BiVO4-1 composite could be mainly attributed to the effective separation of electron–hole pairs at the interface of the heterojunction, leading to the low recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers. Moreover, a large BET specific surface area and wide photoabsorption also favored the excellent photocatalytic antifouling performance. More importantly, this study not only provides a new insight into developing novel and broad-spectrum antibacterial materials, but also introduces a highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst for marine antifouling and water purification.
