    , Accepted 18th June 2018First published on 18th June 2018AbstractThough mixed cation hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials are of promise due to the high efficiency and long-term stability of the corresponding devices, a fundamental understanding on the function of the mixed cation system is still unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the roles of the Cs cation and Cl anion in inverted structure perovskite solar cells based on CsxFA0.2MA0.8−xPb(I1−yCly)3. For the role of Cs, we observe that an appropriate amount of Cs in the film could improve the crystal quality of the film and optimize the energy band alignment of the device, thus reducing non-radiative recombination and promoting the charge transport efficiently. The presence of Cl with a suitable concentration also possesses these functions. More importantly, the two limitations for the application of the devices, hysteresis and performance instability, could also be addressed to some extent. Thus a high power conversion efficiency of 20.31% has been realized and a universal method for constructing highly-efficient perovskite solar cells has been provided.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 22.7% with certified identification on single-junction PSCs, from the initial PCE of 3.8% in 2009.1,2 This great progress is attributed to the intrinsic physical properties of perovskite materials, such as a high absorption coefficient, long charge-carrier diffusion length, tunable bandgap, low binding energy of exciton, and high charge-carrier mobility.3–5 Meanwhile tremendous efforts on the structural design of devices have been made, like developing electron or hole transport layers (ETL, HTL) with particular properties and applying suitable buffer layers for modifying the interlayer, to facilitate the charge transport and collection by obtaining an ideal band alignment and reducing interfacial charge recombination.6–9 Furthermore, efficient devices with large active areas over 50 cm2 have been successfully realized by applying ETL/perovskite interface engineering.10 After a period of rapid development, the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs can compete with that of state-of-the-art crystalline silicon solar cells. To become the next candidate in the market of solar cells, hybrid perovskite devices should have long-term stability.
Generally, perovskite is one category of materials sharing a similar crystal structure and chemical formula AMX3, where A+ is typically an organic cation (methylammonium+ (MA+) or formamidinium+ (FA+)) or inorganic Cs+, M2+ is Pb2+ or Sn2+, and X− is I−, Br− or Cl−. In the early years, researchers mainly focused on improving the performance of the devices with an active layer of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3).11–13 However due to the instability for long-term operation under illumination or moisture environments and the limitations in harvesting near-infrared light in the solar spectrum, MAPbI3 is gradually substituted by formamidinium lead triiodide (CH(NH2)2PbI3 or FAPbI3). FAPbI3 presents significantly enhanced thermal stability and a suitable bandgap (∼1.45 eV),12 which is close to the ideal bandgap (1.2–1.3 eV).14 Unfortunately, FAPbI3 shows an undesired phase transition, in which the photoactive black α-phase (only stable above 160 °C) readily degrades into the photo-inactive yellow δ-phase at room temperature. This seriously affects the practicability of the corresponding device, let alone its large-scale application.15,16 To control the phase transition of FAPbI3, the strategy of diminishing the size of the cation was developed by incorporating MA+ or Cs+ into the composition. Although the MA+/FA+, Cs+/FA+, and Cs+/MA+/FA+ mixed-cation compositional modulations have been proposed as an effective method to restrain the phase conversion,17 the PCE of the corresponding device is slightly lower than that with pure MAPbI3. Recently Seok et al. found that (MAxFA1−x)Pb(IyBr1−y)3 can keep the photoactive phase stable at room temperature and the fabricated device presents a remarkable performance.18 Hence, (MAxFA1−x)Pb(IyBr1−y)3 became a hotpot in mixed cation systems. Based on this Br-doping composition, numerous efforts on cation-doping have been made.17,19,20 However, the reports rarely refer to cation-doping in the Cl-doping system, especially the effect of the anion in the composition. The issue of the mutual function of cation-doping and Cl-doping thus deserves more attention.
In this study, to realize a high PCE, we developed a novel composition for the perovskite active layer on the basis of CsxFA0.2MA0.8−xPb(I1−yCly)3 and systematically analyzed the influence of the combination of cation- and Cl-doping on the performance of PSCs. The influences of the previously unexplored Cs ratio and Cl incorporation on the photovoltaic properties of triple cation PSCs were investigated in detail. More importantly, we obtained highly efficient, hysteresis free devices with a PCE of 20.31% using an optimized composition of Cs (20%) and Cl (10%). The devices also present an improved stability in comparison with the device without Cl doping.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the schematic representation of a standard inverted planar perovskite solar cell in this study, where NiOx:5% Cu is used as the HTL and PC61BM/ZrAcac is used as the ETL. The perovskite film in the device was prepared by using a one-step fast crystallization method with anti-solvent treatment with toluene.21Fig. 1b shows the corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the best performing device. The multi-layered structure can be observed clearly. The thickness of the active layer was gauged as 340 nm which could absorb sufficient sunlight (Fig. S1†) and diffuse charge carriers to their respective transport layers efficiently. By adopting the above method and structure, the PSCs with the active layer of Cs0.2FA0.2MA0.6Pb(I0.9Cl0.1)3 present decent photovoltaic properties. Fig. 1c illustrates the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing device (reverse and forward scan) based on the Cs0.2FA0.2MA0.6Pb(I0.9Cl0.1)3 perovskite. The device presents a promising PCE of 20.31% measured in the forward scan direction, including a Voc of 1.13 V, a Jsc of 23.72 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75%. Additionally, the PCE is 20.24% when measured in the reverse scan direction, with a Voc of 1.13 V, a Jsc of 23.67 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75%. This suggests that the hysteresis in the device is negligible. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra with integrated current density were measured (Fig. 1d). The device shows a remarkable capacity of converting solar energy into electricity in the range of 300–800 nm and the value of the integrated Jsc is close to the Jsc from J–V curves. Further, to explore the effect of Cs on the photovoltaic properties of device, systematic experiments were executed. Fig. 2a displays the J–V curves for the devices based on CsxFA0.2MA0.8−xPb(I0.9Cl0.1)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and the detailed parameters and statistical analysis are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2†, respectively. The acceptable derivation of the integrated Jsc from the IPCE spectra with the Jsc from J–V curves is discussed in ESI (Section 2).† The device without Cs exhibits a low PCE of 15.5 ± 1.5% and the efficiency of the devices with the perovskite film spin-coated from the precursor containing 10% Cs is enhanced to 17.5 ± 0.6%. When the ratio of the Cs precursor increases to 20%, an optimized PCE of 20 ± 0.31% is obtained. Interestingly, on further increasing the Cs ratio in precursor solution, the device performance deteriorates and the PCE decreases to 14.2 ± 0.8% for the device with the film spin-coated from the precursor containing 30% Cs. The IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. The value of IPCE for the devices with the active layer spin-coated from the 20% Cs containing precursor is remarkably higher than that of devices without Cs incorporation. With the concentration of the Cs precursor increasing from 0 to 20%, the value of IPCE as well as integrated current density both increase accordingly, but the IPCE value decreases with further increase in Cs ratio in precursor solution, well consistent with the variational tendency of Jsc obtained from J–V curves. This indicates that an optimum ratio of Cs is beneficial for enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the devices. To reveal the effect of Cs on the crystal structure of perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2c, the series of diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 13.93°, 20°, 28.07° and 40.11° can be attributed to the standard (101), (012), (202), and (024) lattice planes of the black CsxFA0.2MA0.8−x phase, respectively.22,23 A small peak at 9.8° corresponds to the peak of δ-CsPbI3 (ref. 24) and its intensity increases with increasing the concentration of Cs, indicative of that there could be a phase separation between main black CsxFA0.2MA0.8−x and δ-CsPbI3.25 Considering that the δ-CsPbI3 phase needs a high temperature for transforming into the photoactive α-phase,26,27 there would be the excessively unnecessary photoinactive δ-phase of CsPbI3 in the film, resulting in a detrimental effect to the performance of PSCs.28 Fig. S3† shows the color variation of the corresponding perovskite films after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. When the ratio of Cs is over 40%, the film cannot completely turn black, suggesting that the film is not suitable for absorbing visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the series of perovskite films indicate that all the films have an acceptable purity without any elemental contamination. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S4,† with increasing the Cs ratio in the precursor, gradual enhancement in Cs3d peak intensity and atomic percentage is obtained. To understand the effect of Cs on non-radiative recombination behaviours of photo-excited carriers in the perovskite films, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out on the perovskite film coated on glass and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. When we increase the concentration of the Cs precursor from 0 to 20%, the PL lifetime of the resulting film presents an increasing tendency (207 to 352 ns). Since a longer lifetime indicates that the photo-excited carriers possess a lower probability of non-radiative recombination,29,30 this result indicates that the presence of Cs in the perovskite film is beneficial for reducing the probability of non-radiative recombination. As the concentration of Cs in the precursor is increased further, however, the lifetime of the film decays. As revealed by the XRD spectrum, overloading Cs into the film would cause serious phase separation and the phase boundary would behave as the recombination center for charge recombination. To get more information, the morphology of perovskite films with different Cs/MA ratios was investigated by SEM as shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the film spin-coated from the 20% Cs containing precursor, whose photovoltaic performance outperforms compared with the others, shows a clear and smooth morphology without pinholes. By decreasing the Cs ratio in the precursor, we can still obtain a compact film, but many small crystals begin growing and attach on the surface. As revealed by our previous work,31 the small size of crystal grains would increase the probability of non-radiative recombination and create an adverse effect on the PCE. Alternatively, by increasing the ratio of Cs, lots of pinholes appear on the surface of the film. These pinholes as the center of non-radiative recombination would promote the recombination process of photo-excited carriers and the efficiency of the corresponding devices would seriously decay. These results can support our former analysis in TRPL again. The optimum doping of Cs in the perovskite is helpful for obtaining well-crystalline films, which can promote the separation and collection processes of photo-excited carriers. To directly obtain charge transport information on the devices, we have calculated the charge transfer resistance by using impedance spectra (Fig. S5†). Nyquist plots of the corresponding devices were measured at 1.1 V bias voltage under dark conditions and the respective fitted values of resistance are listed in Table S1.† Considering the diameter of semicircle is proportional to the charge transfer resistance,32 the device with the film spin-coated from the 20% Cs precursor shows the smallest semicircle, indicating that the charge transport resistance is the lowest in comparison with the other devices. This result illustrates that the optimized Cs ratio is helpful for device performance in the aspect of charge transport. Changes of the Cs ratio (0–40%) in the perovskite precursor may also effect the position of energy levels of the resulting perovskite film and thus the photovoltaic performance of the device by altering the charge transport efficiency. The energy levels of relevant photo-active layers, as characterized by ultraviolet (UV) photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy measurements (Fig. S6†), are shown in Fig. 3f. Specifically, the Fermi level (Ef) as well as
the valence band maximum (VBM) can be determined from the cut-off of the UPS spectra shown in Fig. S7.†Ef is determined by the position of the lower kinetic energy cut-off and the position of the lower binding energy cut-off represents the gap between the Ef and VBM, with the inset showing the exact cut-off position in the lower binding energy side. The conduction band minimum (CBM) is determined by subtracting the bandgap energy (Eg) from the corresponding VBM. It is obviously concluded from the energy band diagram that the VBM upshifts from 4.40 eV to 3.88 eV with the Cs ratio increasing from 0 to 20%. Further increase in Cs ratio (30–40%) shifts the VBM downwards from 3.88 eV to 4.32 eV. On the other hand, the CBM shows a similar tendency to the corresponding variation in the Cs ratio. In comparison with the CBM of PC61BM (4.00 eV (ref. 33)), only the perovskite film spin-coated from the precursor with 20% Cs presents a CBM that is higher than 4.00 eV and this alignment is energetically favourable for transporting the photo-generated electrons from the perovskite to PC61BM. The other perovskite films all have a lower CBM than PC61BM and such alignment would deteriorate the electron transport due to the formed energy barrier. Alternatively, for facilitating the collection of the photo-generated holes in the perovskite, the VBM of the perovskite films should be lower than that of NiOx and a smaller distance of the VBM of these two component usually indicates a lower energy loss for hole transport. In this case, the perovskite film from the 20% Cs precursor also exhibits a superior capability in transporting the holes to NiOx with a low energy loss in comparison with the other films.

In addition, we have also focused on optimizing the Cl incorporation into perovskite materials based on Cs0.2FA0.2MA0.6PbI3 by choosing a champion ratio (20%) of Cs for fabricating the film. Although some groups have investigated the Cl doping and its influence on the performance of MAPbI3 devices,34–36 as well as perovskite devices based on a double cation FA/MA,37,38 there are still no reports on Cl addition to triple cation perovskite. Here we have investigated the effect of Cl ratio on the photovoltaic, structural and opto-electrical properties of the Cs/FA/MA-based perovskite. Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves to examine the influence of Cl incorporation on photovoltaic performance of devices and relevant detailed parameters are listed in Table 2 and the corresponding statistical analysis is shown in Fig. S8.† The device without Cl presents a PCE of 15.5 ± 0.5%, a Jsc of 19.0 ± 0.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.09 ± 0.01 V and a FF of 69 ± 3%, consistent with the reported values.39 Substituting 10% of the iodide with Cl in the precursor significantly improves the PCE further to a value of 20.0 ± 0.31%, with a Jsc of 23.0 ± 0.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.13 ± 0.01 V and a FF of 75 ± 2%. However on further increasing the Cl ratio to 15%, the device performance begins deteriorating. These findings imply that with the incorporation of 10% Cl into the precursor, substantial improvement is simultaneously observed in Jsc from 19.0 to 23.0 mA cm−2, in Voc from 1.09 to 1.13 V and in FF from 69 to 75%, thus suggesting that photovoltaic properties are exceptionally affected by inclusion of a tiny amount of Cl in the perovskite. To get more information, the IPCE spectra and the corresponding integrated Jsc of the series of devices were measured and are displayed in Fig. 4b. The IPCE peaks blueshift with a higher concentration of Cl incorporation which is consistent with a previous report.38 The integrated Jsc values obtained from the IPCE spectra are approximately in agreement with those from the J–V curves. Fig. 4c shows the XRD patterns of Cs0.2FA0.2MA0.6Pb(I1−yCly)3 on ITO glass prepared from precursor solutions containing different ratios of Cl. It is interesting to note that the (110) peak at about 14° increases slightly in intensity with the amount of 10% Cl incorporation in the precursor, which may suggest an increase in crystallinity in perovskites with a 10% Cl ratio.40 A conspicuous systematic shift in the (101) peak position at 14° toward higher 2θ values could be observed with the increase of the Cl% (Fig. 4c inset), these results correspond to the gradual reduction in lattice parameters as well as lattice cell volume,41 because of the gradual replacement of the iodine anions by the smaller chlorine anions.38,42 The small peak of PbI2 at 12.54° can be attributed to the Cl incorporation into perovskite solution (10–15% Cl).33 The remnant tiny amount of PbI2 in the perovskite film has been reported to show a somehow positive effect on device performance.33,43,44 To confirm the presence of Cl and elemental impurities in perovskite films, XPS was measured. Fig. S9a† reveals the XPS spectra of the series of perovskite films with different compositions and Fig. S9b and c† show that the gradual increase in the Cl2p peak intensities, as we increase the Cl concentration in the precursor. To get more understanding on the effect of Cl incorporation, we performed TRPL measurements on perovskite films spin-coated from the precursors containing 0, 10 and 15% Cl, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4f, the average PL lifetime of the 10% Cl precursor spin-coated film (352 ns) is much longer than that without Cl (50.65 ns). This indicates that a suitable amount of Cl in the perovskite film is beneficial to have a low possibility of non-radiative recombination. An overloading of Cl into the film could cause a fast decay of the lifetime.

We have further studied the impact of Cl incorporation on the charge transport resistance of the photovoltaic devices by impedance spectroscopy. As revealed by Fig. S10 and Table S2,† the device with the optimized ratio of Cl shows the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance. Fig. 5a–c show the planar SEM images of perovskite films spin-coated from the precursor containing 0, 10 and 15% Cl, respectively. The reference film without Cl has a non-uniform morphology with a large number of pinholes and the grains pack together irregularly with rather sharp grain boundaries. The addition of 10% Cl to the precursor strongly affects the morphology of the film, and a uniform and pinhole-free film could be obtained. However, when the concentration of Cl in the precursor increases up to 15%, the density of grain boundaries raises in the perovskite film as compared to the optimized condition, making the morphology adverse for ideal performance of PSCs.

(d) Comparative band energy diagram of the corresponding perovskite films. The values of these energy band positions are referred to the vacuum level (e) J–V curves of the electron-only devices with the structure ITO/Al/(0–15% Cl) perovskite/PC61BM/Al. (f) Hole-only device with the structure ITO/NiOx + 5% Cu/(0–15% Cl) perovskite/Au measured under dark conditions. 
Interestingly, the variation of PCE exactly follows the tendency in the changes of the morphology to the response of Cl variation. To get a better understanding on the significance of Cl for the charge transport dynamics, we have examined the energy band structure alignment as the function of Cl ratio as shown in Fig. 5d, which is determined from the UV-absorption spectra (Fig. S11†) and UPS spectra (Fig. S12†). The VBM could be obtained as 5.77, 5.52 and 5.35 eV for the films spin-coated from the 0, 10 and 15% Cl incorporated precursors, whereas, the CBM positions are obtained as 4.15, 3.88 and 3.72 eV for the respective perovskite films. In comparison with the CBM of PC61BM, the perovskite films without Cl have a lower CBM and this alignment is not favourable for transporting the excited electrons from the perovskite to PC61BM. Alternatively, the perovskite film spin-coated from the precursor with 10% Cl shows an upward shifted CBM to 3.88 eV, such a value is beneficial for transporting the electrons to PC61BM. However, overloading Cl in the film would move the CBM further upwards. Though the electron transport is favourable, this would cause more energy loss in the transport. For the hole transport to NiOx, the VBM positions of the films spin-coated from the precursors with 0 and 10% Cl are all lower than that of NiOx and this is beneficial for the hole transport. However, the latter one possesses a VBM that is closer to the VBM of NiOx than the former one and this enables the latter film with a lower energy loss in the hole transport. An overloading of Cl moves the VBM further upwards, even higher than the VBM of NiOx. In this case, the hole transport is not favourable. The accuracy of the measurement of energy levels is good. Fig. S13† shows three sets of UPS spectra of the CsxFA0.2MA0.8−xPb(I1−yCly)3 film with 20% Cs and Cl 10%. Each sample was prepared and measured at different times. The results demonstrate that the energy levels of the CsxFA0.2MA0.8−xPb(I1−yCly)3 film with 20% Cs and Cl 10% for different samples are in good accuracy and the corresponding deviation could be ignorable in comparison with the difference in energy levels of the films with different Cs or Cl doping concentrations.
The effect of Cl incorporation on the Cs/FA/MA perovskite has also been investigated via measuring electron and hole mobilities (μe, μh) as well as electron and hole trap state densities (nt) in the perovskite device using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique.45Fig. 5e and f display the J–V characteristics of the electron and hole-only devices, respectively, fitted with the Mott-Gurney law, where three regions could be clearly observed. These three regions can be identified according to the different values of the exponent n (J ∝ Vn relation): n = 1 is the ohmic region, n = 2 is the SCLC region, and in between is the trap-filled limited region. At the kink point where the current increases abruptly, the voltage is termed as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). From this region, the trap density nt could be calculated using the following relation:46 (1)where L is the thickness of the perovskite films, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (taken as the value of 32 for MAPbI3 from a previous report47), and εo is the vacuum permittivity. The VTFL values, including the calculated densities of electron and hole trap-states for the devices with the perovskite films fabricated from the precursors with different ratios of Cl, are listed in Tables S3 and S4†, respectively. In comparison with either the reference device (with 0% Cl) or that with 15% Cl, the optimized device (10% Cl) presents an obvious decrease in trap-state density. This reduction in trap density is from the high quality crystallized film, possible passivation effect with the inclusion of tiny amount of Cl in the perovskite film, and the optimized bandgap alignment of the device. Furthermore, we have calculated the carrier mobilities (μe and μh) at a trap free regime (n = 2) by applying the Mott-Gurney law48 (2)where JD is the dark current, μ is the carrier mobility, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, εo is the vacuum permittivity, V is applied voltage and L is the thickness of the active layer. The corresponding J1/2–V curves are shown in Fig. S14 and S15† for electron- and hole-only devices, respectively. A higher slope of the J1/2–V curve results in a larger mobility and the relevant fitted values are listed in Table S5 and S6.† As expected, the device with the film spin-coated from the 10% Cl precursor presents the largest electron and hole mobilities, 1.68 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 5.90 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are almost 4 fold higher than those of the device without Cl modification. Either a lower or higher concentration than 10% of Cl in the precursor would induce a deterioration in charge carrier mobilities. Fig. 6a shows the bandgap alignment of the whole device. The CBM and VBM for NiOx + 5% Cu, PC61BM and ZrAcac were obtained from our previous research.33 Here we have studied the Cs+ and Cl− compositional engineering to get a suitable band alignment with a NiOx + 5% Cu based HTL and a PC61BM/ZrAcac based ETL (Fig. 3f, 5d and 6a). These aligned energy levels of multiple layers suggest the efficient extraction of photo-generated carriers without generating excessive interface recombination, thus facilitating the carrier transport to the respective extraction layers by reducing the current leakage as shown in Fig. S16.† Besides improvement in PCEs with 10% Cl incorporation into the precursor, the most interesting phenomenon is the elimination of common hysteresis in fabricated devices. Fig. 6b shows the hysteresis behaviour of the devices prepared with 0–15% Cl precursors and device parameters with forward and backward scans are shown in Fig. S17† and Table S7†, respectively. Since the J–V hysteresis is related to the native defects in the perovskite layer49 and we have proved that the defects or traps in the devices with the champion Cl ratio are extensively reduced than other devices, it is understandable that the device with the film spin-coated from the 10% Cl precursor shows an ignorable hysteresis effect. One major concern is the durability of PSCs in an ambient environment. We therefore monitored the stability of the devices based on the perovskite film with or without Cl incorporation. Both of the devices were stored in a N2 environment at room temperature without encapsulation and photovoltaic measurements were performed after different intervals of time for over 1000 hours and the corresponding normalized PCEs are shown in Fig. 6c. These results indicate that the Cl based device shows a moderate decrease in PCE during the stability test and over a period of 1000 h it has maintained about 90% of its initial efficiency. Under the same storage and fabrication conditions, the device without Cl incorporation shows a rapid decrease in PCE and maintained about 40% of its initial PCE after 1000 h. To explore the reason behind the fast decaying performance, XRD measurements were taken on perovskite films without and with 10% Cl incorporation into the precursor as shown in Fig. 6d and e. The samples were stored under ambient conditions (RH > 50%) without encapsulation and measurements were taken after different intervals of time. Previously, it was proved that the ratio of PbI2 peaks to perovskite peaks quantified the degree of perovskite degradation.50 It can be observed that the PbI2 peak intensity at 12.6° increases with the aging time more rapidly for the film without Cl as compared to the film spin-coated from the 10% Cl precursor. Whereas, the perovskite peak intensities for the film without Cl incorporation at 13.93°, 20°, 28.07° and 40.11° were decreasing with the storage time and disappeared after 30 days (dark brownish film turns yellow). However, the films prepared from the 10% Cl precursor maintained the perovskite phase even after 30 days of aging under ambient conditions, suggesting that the films show a significantly improved phase stability. Furthermore, we have examined the absorption capability of the films with or without Cl incorporation, stored under ambient conditions (RH > 50%). Fig. 6f shows the absorption spectra of the corresponding films after regular intervals of time. The film without Cl shows a rapid degradation, because the dark brownish color turns pale yellow due to the moisture sensitive nature of perovskites. The absorptivity of the perovskite film decreases quickly as compared to the perovskite film prepared from the precursor with 10% Cl. These results suggest that the addition of Cl to the Cs/FA/MA based perovskite material improves the device stability. Fig. S18† shows the transient photocurrent and photovoltage curves of the devices. In comparison with devices with perovskite films that are not doped with Cs or Cl, the champion device presents the fastest photocurrent decay and lowest photovoltage decay. These results demonstrate that the best-performing device is of decent capability in extracting the photo-generated charge carriers efficiently and the charge recombination possibility is the lowest among the devices herein.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the function of the Cs cation and Cl anion in perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure systematically. Using a combination of techniques, we found that 20% Cs and 10% Cl incorporation into the precursor could improve the morphology quality of the perovskite film, regulate the corresponding alignment of energy levels of the photovoltaic device, and facilitate the transport of charge carriers by improving the electron and hole mobilities and reducing the density of the respective trap state of the device. Most interestingly, the stability of the devices could also be enhanced with the addition of Cl. Thus, an impressive PCE about 20.31% with ignorable hysteresis has been realized. With a detailed working mechanism discussed in a fundamental way, this designed method provides a novel and universal strategy to improve the efficiencies and stability of perovskite photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Materials and solution preparation
Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI; >99.5%), lead chloride (PbCl2) and lead iodide (PbI2; >99.99%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Caesium iodide (CsI), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM; >99.9%) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and cupric acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate (ZrC20H28O8) was provided by Alfa Aesar. All the solvents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were used as received.
For the function investigation of Cl in triple cation perovskite, FAI, CsI, and MAI were mixed with a fixed ratio (0.2:0.2:0.6) and the molar ratio of PbI2/PbCl2 was varied (1:0, 0.9:0.1, and 0.85:0.15) in anhydrous DMF. To study the effect of Cs, the CsI/MAI ratio was varied (0:0.8, 0.1:0.7, 0.2:0.6, 0.3:0.5, 0.4:0.4), whereas FAI, PbI2 and PbCl2 were mixed with a fixed ratio (0.2:0.9:0.1). The concentration of the perovskite precursor was 1.2 M. The mixture was then stirred overnight at 60 °C in a nitrogen glovebox. The final solution of the perovskite precursor was aged in a glovebox for 2 to 3 days, and filtered with 0.45 μm PTFE filters before use. For the hole transport layer, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O were dissolved separately in anhydrous ethanol (0.1 M). The Cu doped NiOx precursor was prepared by mixing the ethanol solutions of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O with the specific volume ratio (Ni:Cu, 95:5). PC61BM was dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1). For the electron buffer layer, ZrC20H28O8 (ZrAcac) was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (2 mg mL−1).

Device fabrication. 
FTO patterned glasses were cleaned sequentially with detergent, isopropanol, acetone and then ethanol. The Cu doped NiOx film was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed for 1 h at 340 °C under ambient conditions. When the temperature decreased to 100 °C the substrates were immediately transferred into the nitrogen glove box (H2O and O2 < 1 ppm). To deposit the active layer, perovskite solution (25 μL) was dropped onto the center of the substrates and then spun at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and anhydrous toluene was quickly dropped onto the centre of the substrates after a desired interval of time. The obtained dark brownish films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. After cooling down to room temperature, PC61BM solution was subsequently spin coated on top of the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The final solution for the buffer layer ZrAcac was deposited on top of the PC61BM layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. To complete the device, Ag (100 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.


Characterization. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2450 source measure unit under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−1. The XRD spectra were obtained using a Rigaku V2500 X-ray diffractometer. IPCE measurements were obtained using a QEPVSI-B measurement system (Newport). The cross-sectional and planar scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the device structure was recorded using a JSM-7401F. Absorbance spectrum measurements were performed on an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Persee TU-1950) in absorption mode. PL measurements were performed with a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system (Edinburgh F900) and the samples were excited using a pulsed laser with a wavelength of 485 nm.
