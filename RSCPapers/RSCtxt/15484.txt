    , Accepted 23rd March 2021First published on 23rd March 2021AbstractThe coupling of piezoelectric properties with Rashba spin–orbit coupling (SOC) has proven to be the limit breaker that paves the way for a self-powered spintronic device (ACS Nano, 2018, 12, 1811–1820). For further advancement in next-generation devices, a new class of buckled, hexagonal magnesium-based chalcogenide monolayers (MgX; X = S, Se, Te) have been predicted which are direct band gap semiconductors satisfying all the stability criteria. The MgTe monolayer shows a strong SOC with a Rashba constant of 0.63 eV Å that is tunable to the extent of ±0.2 eV Å via biaxial strain. Also, owing to its broken inversion symmetry and buckling geometry, MgTe has a very large in-plane as well as out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient. These results indicate its prospects for serving as a channel semiconducting material in self-powered piezo-spintronic devices. Furthermore, a prototype for a digital logic device can be envisioned using the ac pulsed technology via a perpendicular electric field. Heat transport is significantly suppressed in these monolayers as observed from their intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature: MgS (9.32 W m−1 K−1), MgSe (4.93 W m−1 K−1) and MgTe (2.02 W m−1 K−1). Further studies indicate that these monolayers can be used as photocatalytic materials for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen on account of having suitable band edge alignment and high charge carrier mobility. This work provides significant theoretical insights into both the fundamental and applied properties of these new buckled MgX monolayers, which are highly suitable for futuristic applications at the nanoscale in low-power, self-powered multifunctional electronic and spintronic devices and solar energy harvesting.
1. Introduction
With the groundbreaking discovery of graphene,1 a new field of science has emerged at the nanoscale which has been drawing unparalleled attention due to their novel characteristics as compared to their bulk counterparts. However, the semi-metallic nature of graphene arising from the linear band crossing at the Fermi level hinders its realization in practical applications2 and hence, the quest for 2D semiconducting materials with novel properties. The transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2), h-BN, black phosphorous, and other 2D materials have attracted significant attention owing to their interesting properties and prospects in several applications.3–10 The discovery of new stable semiconductors having strong SOC is very much desired in the field of spintronics in which the spin–orbit interaction can be used to tune the electronic properties of the material. In this context, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides have drawn considerable attention due to spin splitting at the band edges, which is caused by a considerable SOC. The mirror cum inversion symmetry is broken in their Janus monolayer structures along the out-of-plane or z-direction, giving rise to a built-in electric field along the z-direction. It induces a Rashba-like spin splitting around the Γ-point and a higher spin splitting at the band edges with respect to their pristine counterparts and thereby makes it more suitable for their application in spintronics. The broken inversion symmetry in a crystal brings about an additional degree of freedom, namely, the valley index,6,11 which can be employed to encode and process information. The valley and spin polarization may be coupled together in certain applications, where spintronics may be merged with valleytronics. A large spin splitting at the band edges is desirable for applications of nanomaterials in nanoscale spintronics. Few atomically thin semiconductors with direct band gap show large Rashba splitting at the band edges, such as, in the BiSb monolayer.12 For example, despite a strong SOC in the WSe2 monolayer, Rashba splitting is suppressed13 owing to the presence of mirror symmetry, whereas a Janus WSeTe monolayer shows a good level of Rashba effect, which is induced by the broken mirror symmetry and a large out-of-plane built-in electric field. However, a WSeTe monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor.14 Although large Rashba splitting is observed in bulk materials, such as BiTeI (3.8 eV Å),15 and GeTe (4.8 eV Å),16 it is not clear whether these properties will be retained when they are thinned down to the scale of monolayers. In addition, theoretically, the Rashba effect has been predicted in van der Waals heterostructures, such as, in PtSe2/MoSe2 (1.3 eV Å),17 BiSb/AlN (1.5 eV Å),12 GaSe/MoSe2 (0.49 eV Å).18 Hence, monolayers having an intrinsically strong SOC are very much sought after in replacing the traditionally used channel material to develop atomically thin spin field-effect transistors (s-FETs).
Alternatives to conventional power sources, such as batteries, are being sought for more than two decades, particularly, for low-power small-sized electronic devices.19 The persistent issue lies in the limited lifetime, the need for periodic recharging and replacement of batteries in portable, remote, and implantable devices. In this context, small-scale piezoelectric materials can serve as a promising alternative to batteries, on account of their intrinsic and ultrasensitive electromechanical coupling. Besides, these materials can harvest ambient vibration energy and mechanical energy. Non-centrosymmetric materials allow for the generation of electricity upon the application of stress/strain. Various theoretical investigations on low dimensional systems reported piezoelectricity in 2D monolayers such as TMDC,20,21 monolayer and bilayer CdS,22,23h-BX (X: P, As, Sb),24,25 and h-BN25–29 which have guided experimentalists in their quest for piezoelectricity in 2D materials. In this context, MoS2 monolayer has been reported first experimentally to exhibit piezoelectricity.30,31 However, the aforementioned materials have shown in-plane piezoelectricity. The ongoing search for the directional oriented piezoelectric material presented GaP-GaS, SiP-AlS, and SnP-InS Janus structures with out of plane piezoelectricity.32 A desirable directional oriented piezoelectricity with a large piezoelectric coefficient would result in the application of these nanostructures in actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting.
Although the effect of piezoelectric properties on SOC has been demonstrated experimentally,33 no significant progress has been reported on combining these two exclusive properties for self-powered spintronic devices either theoretically or experimentally. In this work, a new series of stable magnesium monochalcogenide (MgS, MgSe, and MgTe) monolayers have been proposed and a systematic investigation has been conducted to shed light on their basic intrinsic properties via density functional theory. A wide range of properties of these monolayers have been evaluated theoretically from the perspectives of fundamental understanding and futuristic applications in cutting-edge electronics as well as in green and clean solar energy harvesting.
2. Computational details
All the calculations of MgX monolayers are performed using density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).34,35 The projected augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials are used to describe the ion–electron interactions.36 The electron exchange and correlation are treated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as parameterized by the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.37 The electronic wave-functions are expanded using the plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cut off of 500 eV, ensuring the total energy is converged to 10−8 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman force component on each atom reaches less than 0.02 eV Å−1. A Γ-centered k-point mesh of 16 × 16 × 1 is used to sample the Brillouin zone for static and electronic property calculations. The interaction between the adjacent monolayer is avoided by adding a vacuum thickness of 20 Å along the z-direction. The lattice thermal conductivity of these materials has been calculated using the harmonic and anharmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) that have been evaluated based on the supercell approach using the PHONOPY38 and PHONO3PY39 codes, respectively. A 4 × 4 × 1 supercell size for second-order and 4 × 4 × 1 supercell for third-order IFCs with a 9 × 9 × 1 k-mesh have been employed in these calculations. It is to be noted that beyond the third-order IFC terms treating higher-order anharmonicity requires intensive computational cost and theoretical complexity.40
For 2D electron systems, the Rashba effect is described by the Hamiltonian (1)where αR represents the Rashba coupling parameter,  is the out-of-plane unit vector,  is the in-plane momentum of the electrons and  is the vector of Pauli matrices, respectively. The Rashba splitting parameter which is used to measure the strength of Rashba spin splitting is defined as  and  along the Γ–K and Γ–M directions, respectively. KKR and KMR are the offset momentum along the Γ–K and Γ–M directions, as discussed in section 3.4. Due to the lifted spin degeneracy, the energy versus momentum dispersion relation can be represented as (2)
The PYPROCAR code is used to plot the spin texture.41
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical properties
Analogous to h-BN, the planar hexagonal structures of monolayer MgX (X: S, Se, and Te) have been constructed having lattice constants close to that of the bulk—4.05 Å, 4.25 Å and 4.61 Å for MgS, MgSe, and MgTe respectively. However, these structures exhibit significant imaginary frequency in a large region of the Brillouin zone as indicated in their phonon dispersion spectra shown in Fig. 1 leading to lattice dynamical instability. The imaginary frequency in the ZA mode indicates a lack of sufficient restoring force between the atoms to retain their original configuration when displacing from their mean position along the z-direction. Similarly, other 2D planar semiconductors such as CdX, ZnX, HgX (X: S, Se, and Te) have been reported to be dynamically unstable.42 To address the stability issues in planar MgX structures, buckled monolayers have been constructed from their bulk structures (P63mc).

The detailed structural parameters of buckled monolayers are listed in Table 1. The top and side views of the optimized buckled monolayers are shown in Fig. 2. The lattice constant a0 increases with the increase in the atomic radius upon moving down the chalcogen series. The dynamical and mechanical stabilities of these buckled structures have been confirmed from their phonon dispersion and mechanical stability criteria which have been discussed in subsequent sections.

3.2 Electronic properties of MgX monolayers
The application of any semiconductor is strongly dependent on its electronic properties. Hence the band gaps of these MgX monolayers are calculated first using density functional theory by employing the GGA-PBE functional and plotted as shown in Fig. 3. They show a direct band gap with the band edges occurring at the high symmetry Γ-point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. The band gaps calculated using different exchange–correlation functionals are provided in Table 1. The two bands near the valence band maximum (VBM) account for the heavy and light holes in the MgX monolayers, as the high (low) curvature of these bands causes a high (small) hole effective mass.

3.2.1 Effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on electronic properties. 
The SOC plays an important role in realizing spin field-effect transistors. Since MgX monolayers are constituted by both light (Mg) and heavy (Te) atoms, SOC is included to account for the relativistic effect on the electronic structure. The electronic band structure incorporating SOC is plotted as shown in Fig. 4. The Rashba type spin splitting is observed near the conduction band minimum of the MgTe monolayer compared to the other two. The significant decrease in band gap upon including the relativistic effect is also observed in the system which implies relativistic effect cannot be ignored in these semiconductors. The strength of the Rashba effect depends on the Rashba energy (ER), the Rashba momentum (KR) and the Rashba constant (αR) that have been pictorially presented in Fig. 4. EKR and EMR represent the difference in the energy of the two peaks and degenerate energy at the high symmetry Γ-point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. KKR and KMR are the offset momentum along the Γ–K and Γ–M directions, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 4(a). The calculated Rashba energy, Rashba momentum, and Rashba constant for MgTe at the conduction band are 8.3 meV, 0.0275 Å, and 0.63 eV Å, respectively. The Rashba constant of the other known 2D and bulk semiconductors are: WSeTe monolayer (0.92 eV Å),14 BiSb monolayer (2.3 eV Å),12 KMgSb (0.83 eV Å),43 BiTeCl (1.2 eV Å),44 and GaSe/MoSe2 heterostructure (0.49 eV Å).18 The HSE06 functional does not affect the strength of the Rashba spin splitting as reported earlier.12,16 Hence, such computationally intensive calculations are excluded. The origin of such a large Rashba effect in such a simple two-atom monolayer can be understood by analyzing the atomic orbital contribution in the conduction band at the Γ-point which was found out to be Mg_s (24.5%), Te_pz (49.8%), and Te_s (23%). The built-in electric field is along the z-direction, and CBM is mainly composed of pz orbitals whereas VBM is composed of px and py orbitals leading to spin splitting in CBM only, as 〈pz|Ez|pz〉 ≠ 0, 〈px|Ez|px〉 = 0, and 〈py|Ez|py〉 = 0. Furthermore, the spin texture is calculated in the kx–ky plane centered at the Γ-point. The concentric spin-texture (red color: spin-up; blue color: spin-down) circles represent the Rashba effect. The spin projection on the electronic bands indicates the presence of only the in-plane spin components (Sx and Sy), which indicates that the Rashba splitting is purely 2D in nature.

Valley polarization is discernible at the K and K′ points, as indicated within the circles and (b) the spin texture plot projected on the conduction band edge. 
The response of the Rashba effect to external stimuli is important for designing s-FET experimentally as the strain will arise naturally when it will be supported on a substrate, due to the lattice mismatch between the MgX monolayer and the substrate. To investigate the tunability of the Rashba splitting observed in MgTe, an external biaxial strain within ±8% is applied on the system. Its response to electronic properties is plotted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) indicates that MgTe remains direct but the band gap decreases under both compressive and tensile strain while the Rashba constant increases (decreases) under the biaxial tensile (compressive) strain. Furthermore, to illustrate the differences in the sensitivity of the band gap to different kinds of strain, the variation in the conduction and valence band edges in an absolute vacuum scale is plotted in Fig. S1.† Besides, the change in the total energy of the system is shown in Fig. S2.† It can be observed that the variation in total energy is not symmetric under compressive and tensile biaxial strain, which is clear from the quadratic fitting parameters in Fig. S2.† A similar trend in band gap variation with strain engineering has been reported in other monolayer systems, such as, Janus SnSSe, SnS2, and SnSe2.45,46 The Rashba constant can be tuned by ±0.2 eV Å under the application of ±8% biaxial strain. The Rashba constant under an external electric field with SOC is provided in Fig. S3 in the ESI† which shows a decrease in the Rashba constant under both forward and reverse electric fields. Hence, the external biaxial strain and electric field will act as a tool to manipulate the Rashba constant which will be very useful in spintronics applications. Furthermore, the broken inversion symmetry leads to valley polarization at the corners of the 2D Brillouin zone i.e. at K/K′. The out-of-plane spin (Sz) projected band structure of MgTe is plotted in Fig. 4, where opposite spins are found to be locked at the momentum valleys, K and K′, occurring at the edges of the conduction and valence bands. SOC facilitates the spin splitting of the bands at the valleys. It is similar to that of the transition metal dichalcogenides MoS2, WS2, HfN2, etc.11,47 The application of strain and an out-of-plane electric field is found to effectively engineer the band edges, such as shifting of the conduction band edge or valence band edge from one high symmetry point to another, as previously reported in several materials,18 including a ferroelectric semiconducting AgBiP2X6 monolayer.48 Hence, simultaneous Rashba-type spin splitting (Sx/y) with valley spin splitting (Sz) can be achieved in the MgTe monolayer which makes it a promising candidate in both spin and valleytronics.

The effect of an external electric field on electronic properties, structural modification, polarization, gas molecule adsorption, etc. has been widely studied.49 In the following section, the effect of a perpendicular electric field on the electronic properties has been discussed for its application in electric field induced memory devices. Besides, the structural change under the external electric field is useful in the study of ferroelectricity, as demonstrated in previous reports.50 The study of ferroelectricity is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the structural changes in bond length and buckling height under different electric field intensities are shown in Fig. S4.† For electric field modulated electronic properties, the impact of structural changes has been excluded by fixing the position of atoms.49


3.2.2 Effect of electric field on electronic property modulation. 
The variation of band gap with the perpendicular electric field plays a significant role in charge carrier transport in electronics and for the MgTe monolayer, it is presented in Fig. 6(a). From Fig. 6, it is clear that the band gap gradually decreases with an increase in electric field intensity. When the electric field is zero, it is semiconducting and in this state, the charge carriers experience large impedance which limits the source to drain current (ISD) (termed as OFF state), whereas high current will flow in the metallic state (ON state). The application of an electric field alters the electrostatic potential51,52 and the position of the bands in an absolute vacuum scale. The application of an electric field along the z-direction narrows the gap between the CBM and VBM. At E = 0.74 V Å−1 (critical electric field), MgTe transits from semiconducting to metallic state as the CBM overlaps with the VBM, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Taking advantage of such an electrical resistance response, high/low electric resistance corresponds to low/high tunneling current. We propose the potential application of MgX in digital electronics. The square wave pulse voltage applied along the z-direction is shown in Fig. 6(c) where critical electric field/saturation voltage ES = 0.74 V Å−1, beyond which MgTe behaves metallic. The electrical input–digital output signal conversion is presented in Fig. 6(c). The output signal “1/0” corresponds to the “ON/OFF” state. Thus, in correspondence to the external field, a data storage device with desirable width and frequency of the output regulated by the input pulsed voltage can be designed. For comparison, the vertical electric field required to convert the semiconducting state to the metallic state is provided for other monolayers and van der Waals heterostructures—InSe monolayer53 (1 V Å−1), InSe bilayer54 (0.3 V Å−1), InSe/BP52 (0.25 V Å−1), and HfN2 monolayer51 (0.48 V Å−1). The vertical electric field of 0.5 V Å−1 has been experimentally demonstrated by using the ac pulsed-field technology.55

3.3 Piezoelectric properties
The uniaxial strain is applied within ±1% to calculate the change in the polarization (ΔP) of MgTe using the Berry phase method56 implemented in VASP. We have employed two methods, namely, the clamped-ion method and the relaxed-ion method. In the clamped ion method, the atoms are not relaxed at each percentage of strain, whereas in the relaxed ion method, all the atoms are fully relaxed. The method of relaxation is similar for the calculation of elastic stiffness but the strain is applied within ±6% of strain at an interval of 2%. Based on the strain–energy relationship in eqn (3), the elastic constants (Cij) have been obtained via both the clamped-ion and relaxed ion methods and listed in Table 2. (3)

The difference in the elastic constants obtained by the clamped-ion and relaxed ion methods is obvious due to the relative displacement of atoms. The slope of ΔP and the uniaxial strain graph as plotted in Fig. 7 gives the piezoelectric stress coefficient (eij). The piezoelectric strain coefficient (dij) which is a measurable quantity in the experiment is related to eik and Cjk as in Voigt notation; eik = dijCjk(4)where e11 is the change in polarization along the x-axis when a uniaxial strain ε11 is applied. For the given symmetry, d11 is related to e11 as; (5)
 Fig. 7  Change in unit-cell polarization per unit area along the x-direction upon applying the uniaxial strain (ε11) along the same direction. 
The piezoelectric stress and strain coefficients calculated using both the clamped-ion and relaxed ion approaches are tabulated in Table 3. The calculated results indicate MgTe as a promising piezoelectric semiconductor with d11 ∼ 34 pm V−1 surpassing the earlier predicted Mo and W based transition metal dichalcogenides (d11 = 2–8 pm V−1),26 boron V-group binary and ternary monolayers (d11 = 0.5–4.5 pm V−1)24,25 and other bulk piezoelectric semiconductors such as α-quartz, wurtzite GaN etc. Further calculation indicates that the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient, dMgTe33, originating from its buckled geometry can be as high as 59.62 pm V−1, whereas those for MgS and MgSe are 33.7 pm V−1 and 48.17 pm V−1 respectively. Utilizing the piezoelectric properties of monolayer MoSe2, recent experiments have demonstrated excellent electromechanical conversion, which would be very useful in monitoring respiratory rate and self-powered sensors.57

Earlier experiments have demonstrated that Rashba SOC can be effectively controlled by crystal piezo-potential without the application of an external voltage.33 Hence, such a large piezoelectric coefficient signifies its potential for application in piezoelectric resistive memory (PRM) devices or as a gate electrode in strain-gated transistors in which the piezoelectric voltage generated via mechanical manipulation can control the flow of electric current, unlike the conventional transistor in which the external gate voltage regulates the current flow. For instance, ZnO nanowires having a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 = 20.8 pm V−1 have been reported previously as a highly sensitive piezotronic transistor.58 Further, experiments have demonstrated a self-switching diode as memristor and photodetector using the multifunctionalities of MoS2.59 Likewise, the Rashba and piezoelectric effects are intertwined in the MgX monolayers studied in this work. The out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient, dMgX33, originates from the broken inversion symmetry and the built-in out-of-plane electric field (say, Ez) along the z direction, which is brought about by the buckled structure of the MgX monolayers. Ez induces the Rashba effect in MgX monolayers owing to the considerable spin orbit coupling (SOC) in them. The SOC coupling and Ez rise from MgS to MgTe. The out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient, d33, shows the same trend as that of the Rashba constant in MgX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers. Both d33 and the Rashba constant scale with Ez and therefore, they increase from MgS to MgTe monolayers. These results indicate their prospects for use as channel semiconducting material in self-powered piezo-spintronic devices. Moreover, these buckled monolayers can be used as a highly sensitive self-powered piezotronic transistor.
3.4 Mechanical properties and charge carrier mobility
Mechanical properties are important for realizing practical device-based applications, e.g., in NEMS, stretchable, and flexible electronics. In this context, the elastic constants (Cij) of these materials have been evaluated from the strain–energy relationship as implemented in the VASPKIT code60 and are summarized in Table 4. These monolayers are found to be stable under small mechanical deformations, thus satisfying the Born–Huang stability criteria.61 The mechanical constants/properties have been derived from the elastic stiffness constants, as discussed in the ESI† and listed in Table 4. The flexibility of these monolayers is discernible from their low Young's modulus, which is comparable to that of TcTe2 (34 N m−1),62 planar CdS (29 N m−1),63 and buckled CdSe (31 N m−1).23

From the obtained elastic constants, other important mechanical properties such as intrinsic strength, bending modulus, and critical buckling strain can be evaluated using the following formulas:64–66 (6) (7) (8)where Y and v are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, h is the thickness of the nanosheet (= 2 Å for buckled monolayers), and L is the length of the nanosheet in Å. These parameters are calculated and listed in Table 5. For a ready reference, the bending modulus of graphene is calculated to be ∼1.2 eV and that for MoS2 is ∼9.61 eV within the same formalism.64

The charge carrier mobility of the MgX monolayers has been calculated using the Lang et al. formalism67,68 given in eqn (9) (see the ESI† for more details). (9)
The carrier mobility and its related parameters are listed in Table 6. The electron mobility is calculated to be higher than the hole mobility due to the smaller effective mass and deformation potential than that of the holes as carrier mobility is inversely proportional to the square of the deformation potential. The obtained carrier mobility is very high compared to that of MoS2 (200 cm2 V−1 s−1)5,69 and comparable to that of SnS2 (756 cm2 V−1 s−1), SnSe2 (462 cm2 V−1 s−1),70 buckled CdS (450 cm2 V−1 s−1), CdSe (610 cm2 V−1 s−1),23 InSe (1000 cm2 V−1 s−1),71 and TiS3 (1000 cm2 V−1 s−1).72 Since the band dispersion is symmetric around the Γ-point, only one direction is considered for carrier mobility calculation.

3.5 Phonon dynamics
Phonon transport in a semiconductor plays an important role in operating electronic devices with optimum efficiency and lifetime.73 Apart from that, a low thermal conductivity is desirable for on-chip power generation using ultrathin thermoelectric generators via the conversion/recycling of waste heat into useful electricity.74–78 It is well-known that phonons are quantized by lattice vibration and are the main carriers of heat transport in solids. However, the phonon spectra also contain valuable information such as phonon group velocity and Debye temperature that determines the lattice thermal conductivity of a material etc. All these quantities have been explicitly calculated and presented in the following section.

3.5.1 Phonon dispersion and phonon group velocity. 
The phonon spectra obtained for buckled monolayers are shown in Fig. 8. The absence of the imaginary frequency in all the phonon branches demonstrates their lattice dynamical stability. The phonon frequency of all modes decreases with an increase in the mass ratio mx/mMg from MgS to MgTe as tabulated in Table 1 which is similar to that of the previously studied CdX23 and group-IV selenides.79 The low-frequency acoustic modes (ZA, TA, and LA) are well separated from the high-frequency optical modes (ZO, TO, and LO) as indicated in Fig. 8. The group velocity can be directly determined from the slope of the phonon dispersion curve as given by: νλ = ∂ωλ/∂q(10)where ωλ,q represents the phonon branch λ at the wave vector q-point. The longitudinal acoustic phonon group velocity close to the Γ point (i.e. the sound speed) was calculated for MgS, MgSe, and MgTe and are found to be ∼6.2 km s−1, ∼5 km s−1, and ∼3.8 km s−1, respectively, which can be seen in Fig. 8(b). For a quick reference, the maximum group velocity found in other 2D materials GeSe79, InSe80, BSb24, and SnP381 are 4.5 km s−1, 4 km s−1, 7.2 km s−1, and 4 km s−1, respectively.

3.5.2 Debye temperature and mode Grüneisen parameters. 
The Debye temperature can be calculated from the phonon dispersion and is given by79,82 (11)where θA = hvm/kB. vm is the maximum frequency of the phonon mode and the other terms denote their usual meaning. The lower Debye temperature corresponds to the low thermal conductivity, according to Slack's theory.83,84 The low Debye temperature indicates low phonon velocities which increase the phonon population and in turn, the phonon scattering rate.82 The Debye temperature of the MgX monolayers is listed in Table 7. The obtained Debye temperature for the MgX materials is comparable to those of stanene (198 K),82 GeSe (133.13 K), SnSe (95.94 K),79 SnS2 (136.9 K), and SnSe2 (107.8 K)70 within the same formalism.

Grüneisen parameters are other important parameters that describe the anharmonicity of the crystal. The larger mode Grüneisen parameters indicate strong anharmonicity. The larger mode Grüneisen parameter can be calculated from Poison's ratio (υ) by eqn (12);85 Y = 3(1 + ν)/2(2 − 3ν)(12)
It has been calculated to be 1.77, 2.13, 1.6 for MgS, MgSe and MgTe monolayers, respectively. Furthermore, it can be calculated directly from a change in phonon frequency with respect to volume dilation as given by eqn (13) and plotted in Fig. 9. (13)

3.5.3 Lattice thermal conductivity. 
The lattice thermal conductivity (κl) of a phonon is calculated by solving the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) which depends on the specific heat capacity, phonon group velocity, and phonon lifetime. It is given by (14)where Cλ the mode-dependent specific heat, vλ is the group velocity, τλ is the relaxation time of mode λ, and V is the crystal volume. The lattice thermal conductivities here have been calculated using the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The difference between RTA and iterative solution to LBTE is briefly discussed in the ESI.† The temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivity of MgX (X: S, Se, and Te) monolayers are plotted in Fig. 10 and are found to be 9.32, 4.93, and 2.02 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, respectively. For comparison, other 2D materials of the same order are GaS (14 W m−1 K−1), GaSe (13 W m−1 K−1),80 buckled CdS (1.08 W m−1 K−1),23 SnP3 (4.97 W m−1 K−1),81 SiTe2 (2.27 W m−1 K−1),86 SnS2 (6.41 W m−1 K−1),70 and stanene (5.8 W m−1 K−1).82 The value of κl decreases from MgS to MgTe which is mainly due to the low group velocity and Debye temperature in MgTe. Besides, κl is dependent on the square of vλ, as shown by eqn (14). The contribution of each phonon mode to the total lattice thermal conductivity was evaluated and found to be dominated by the acoustic phonons in heat transport.
 Fig. 10  The calculated temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivities of the MgX monolayers. 
Considering the three phonon scattering mechanisms,82 the acoustic branch phonons can scatter in two ways: (i) scattering between the three acoustic modes (a + a ↔ a) and (ii) the emission of one optical phonon from two acoustic phonons (a + a ↔ o), where a and o represent the acoustic and optical phonons, respectively. To evaluate the contribution of the optical phonon modes, the lattice thermal conductivity of each branch is calculated and tabulated in Table 8. It shows that the LA and TA modes contribute significantly whereas the contribution of optical mode decreases from MgS to MgTe as depicted in the phonon dispersion plot. The acoustic–optical (a–o) gap increases from MgS to MgTe, as shown in Table 8, while it is almost equal to the maximum frequency of the acoustic mode in MgTe. Considering the a + a ↔ o scattering process alone, the optical phonons provide important scattering channels for acoustic phonons. But as the a–o gap increases, this process is weakened and the scattering process is mainly contributed by the acoustic modes. In summary, the low lattice thermal conductivity of MgX originates from the low phonon group velocity, low Debye temperature and strong anharmonicity of the crystal as indicated by the large mode Grüneisen parameter.

3.6 Photocatalysis
Apart from the above properties, photocatalysis is another avenue to meet the global energy crisis. It is one of the efficient ways to produce hydrogen and oxygen by utilizing unlimited solar energy via semiconducting materials.87,88 2D materials due to their superior properties, such as large specific area and availability of more active sites promote their wide application as a photocatalyst. TiO2 happens to be the first photocatalyst that has been investigated; however, its wide band gap causes optical absorbance in the UV region, which lowers its scope for direct application in visible light photocatalysis.89 Since then, many 2D photocatalyst materials such as AlN, GaN, In/GaX (X: S, Se), TaN2,90 and many more have been explored.87,91–93 New photocatalysts suitable for simultaneous oxidation and reduction of water is very much the crying need of the hour.93–95
Photocatalysis strongly depends on the band gap of the material to convert the solar energy efficiently.96 The foremost requirement for a suitable photocatalyst is that the VBM should be lower than the water oxidation potential (−5.67 eV) and the CBM to be higher than the hydrogen reduction potential (−4.4 eV) at zero pH value. The pH-dependent redox potentials can be calculated using the standard equations.97,98 Along with a suitable band edge alignment, the monolayer should possess a band gap between 2–3 eV. Due to the presence of such a large band gap with high charge carrier mobility ∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1, the electron–hole pair generated can migrate to the semiconductor surface before recombination and therefore the electrons and holes can participate in the generation of hydrogen and oxygen gases. The overall photocatalytic process can be presented in a reaction as; 2H2O → O2(g) + 2H2(g)(15)

Fig. 11 shows the simultaneous straddling of band edges with respect to the oxidation and reduction potentials of water. The band edge positions for all the MgX monolayers are located at energetically favorable positions, suggesting their suitable application for photocatalysis in acidic as well as neutral media having a wide range of pH values (0 to 7). From the analysis, it is found that the MgX monolayer has both the suitable band edge position and band gap for the promising application as an overall water splitting catalyst in acidic as well as in neutral medium.
 Fig. 11  Band edges of buckled MgX monolayers calculated using the HSE06 functional scaled up with respect to vacuum and the dotted lines indicate the water redox potentials at different pH values. 
The kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction is presented in Fig. 12 which shows that the remotely separated hydrogen adatoms generated photocatalytically migrate closer to form the hydrogen molecule on the surface of magnesium chalcogenide. The approaching hydrogen adatoms reduce the energy of the adsorbed system to an energy level of −0.27 eV. Furthermore, the aggregation of H adatoms to form a H2 molecule is highly exothermic (−2.21 eV). A low energy of 0.02 eV (from −2.21 eV to −2.19 eV) is required for the removal of the H2 molecule from the surface of the MgX monolayer which is similar to that of bilayer CdS.22,98 The downhill feature of the energy profile demonstrates that H2 can be favorably generated on monolayer MgS. These results presented the high applicability of monolayer MgX as a photocatalyst with overall water splitting capacity. The detailed absorption spectra of MgX monolayers are presented in the ESI.†

4. Conclusion
In this work, the stable structure for magnesium-based chalcogenide monolayers has been predicted and their intrinsic properties, such as electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties have been extensively investigated using the density functional theory. These monolayers are found to be semiconductors with a wide and direct band gap. Among all MgX monolayers, MgTe exhibits a strong SOC leading to a Rashba splitting of 0.63 eV Å, which can be further tuned by ±0.2 eV Å under external biaxial strain. The semiconductors having large Rashba splitting reported so far are narrow band gap semiconductors and hence, the band structure and band gap cannot be modulated effectively via external perturbations, such as, strain. In addition, the direct to indirect band gap transition via strain engineering is common in 2D materials. In contrast, MgTe provides a relatively wider band gap that is tunable via strain, thereby providing ample room for the modulation of its band structure and band gap via external perturbations. Also, it retains its direct band gap under ±10% of biaxial strain. As a result, this semiconductor stands out from the other Rashba semiconductors studied or reported so far. Under the application of a vertical electric field, the MgTe monolayer turns metallic which can be used in logic gate devices to store information. Furthermore, these materials exhibit large in-plane piezoelectric coefficients compared to well-known TMDCs which can be used for sensing and as actuators. The MgX monolayers exhibit superhigh flexibility as reflected by their low Young's modulus of ∼30 N m−1. The charge carrier mobility is found to be ∼104 cm2 V−1 s−1. With such high carrier mobility and low Young's modulus, these materials can be integrated into next-generation flexible nanoelectronics. The phonon transport is largely suppressed in these materials as indicated by their low lattice thermal conductivity of less than 10 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, which largely influences the efficiency and the longevity of MgX based devices. These materials can be used as efficient photocatalysts due to the straddling of their band edges with respect to water redox potential and large charge carrier mobility. Our theoretical results suggest a promising application of these MgX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers in next-generation device-based applications such as flexible nanoelectronics, photodetectors, thermoelectrics, digital electronics and photocatalysis. More importantly, this work enlightens the coupling of multiple intrinsic properties with technologies for advanced applications in the field of spintronics and also promotes self-powered electronics.
