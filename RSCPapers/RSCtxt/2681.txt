    , Accepted 2nd February 2018First published on 5th February 2018AbstractMetal-free organic dyes JY43–JY46 based on the triazatruxene donor were synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where the effects of ethynyl unit and electron acceptor/anchor were systematically investigated. Compared to dyes JY45 and JY46, JY43 and JY44 containing an additional ethynyl unit in the molecular structure showed higher molar absorption coefficients, respectively. The strongly electron-withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid seemed helpful for dyes to achieve better light harvesting ability compared with dyes having carboxylic acid groups, resulting in the enhancement of the dyes’ photocurrents. Notably, dyes JY43 and JY45 incorporating carboxylic acid anchors exhibited more effective suppression of charge recombination and longer lifetimes of excited electrons, therefore delivering higher photovoltages. Under standard light irradiation (AM 1.5G), the dye JY43 with an ethynyl unit and carboxylic acid in its skeleton gave the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.51% in the iodine electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a promising photovoltaic technology in solar energy utilization have received widespread attention due to their low cost, ease of fabrication, and high photoelectric performance.1–9 Through years of continuous efforts, numerous sensitizers have been designed and applied in DSSCs.10–17 As the most important members of the sensitizer family, Ru-complexes and porphyrin-based dyes have experienced a striking development of which the representative dyes have achieved very high photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCE) such as 11% for N71918 and 13% for SM315.19 However, the envisioned environmental stress for heavy-metal-containing dyes and synthetic difficulties for porphyrin-based ones will inevitably hamper the prospect of their future development. Therefore, metal-free organic dyes have attracted an increasing interest because of the advantages of their rich skeletons and good flexibilities for tailoring molecular structures.20–25
Similar to porphyrin-based dyes, the structures of organic dyes commonly adopt the donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, since it is beneficial to facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from a donor to electron acceptor.26–32 To extend the relatively narrow spectral response of organic dyes, decorating the main structure with a conjugate unit is generally needed to enhance its light absorption and thus gain a promoted photocurrent.33–35 Cyanoacrylic acid, which possesses a conjugate structure and strong electron-withdrawing feature, has consequently been employed as the electron acceptor and anchoring group to fabricate the most of metal-free organic dyes, replacing the benzoic acid which is successfully used in porphyrin-based dyes.36–39 Another effective approach for expanding the conjugate system, broadening the absorption spectrum, and obtaining an improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) is also realized by the interposition of the ethynyl unit between the donor and the acceptor.40 Apart from the Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc) is another critical factor that should be involved in the initial molecular design for achieving high device efficiency. Without the assistance of high Voc, many dyes with very high Jsc give low to moderate device efficiencies.41–45
With this background, four novel triazatruxene-based organic dyes JY43–JY46 featuring carboxylic acid/cyanoacrylic acid groups as electron acceptors and anchoring groups have been synthesized. Triazatruxene was applied for its strong electron donating ability in our previous study,46 and ethynyl unit was introduced in some of the target dyes to modify their conjugate structures. The photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of JY43–JY46 are systematically investigated. The highest PCE of 7.51% is achieved from the device based on dye JY43 containing an inserted ethynyl unit and benzoic acid electron acceptor, which seldom appears in metal-free organic dye molecules. The molecular structures of the four dyes are shown in Fig. 1.

2. Experiments
2.1. Materials and instruments
All chemicals were used as received unless otherwise stated. Dry THF and toluene were distilled over sodium with benzophenone indicator under nitrogen atmosphere. DCM was distilled over calcium hydride. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained with a Varian 7.0T FTMS system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner Corporation). CV experiments were performed in dry DCM with 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte using a classical three-electrode system with a glassy carbon working electrode, an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode.
2.2. Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The double layer TiO2 (8 μm + 4 μm) was printed on a FTO conducting glass by using the screen-printed technique. The transparent layer and scattering layer were coated by commercial TiO2 particles (Heptachroma Corporation) 20 nm and 200 nm in size, respectively. The TiO2 photoanodes were then heated gradually up to 500 °C and kept for 40 min at that temperature. Then, they were immersed in a TiCl4 aqueous solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 40 min and sintered once again at 500 °C for 40 min. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating one drop of 20 mM H2PtCl6 solution in isopropyl alcohol on the surface of FTO conducting glass and subsequently, it was heated to 400 °C and kept at that temperature for 20 min. The TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of dyes with 5.0 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in THF at room temperature for 12 h. The N719 dye was immersed in a 0.3 mM solution in ethanol for 12 h. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.1 M guandine thiocyanate (GuSCN) and 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) in acetonitrile. The photocurrent-voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the DSSCs were obtained under AM 1.5G simulated solar light using a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner Corporation). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a commercial IPCE system (QTest Station 2000, CrownTech Corporation, USA). The DSSCs were fabricated into a sandwich-type structure and illuminated by a solar simulator (CHF-XM-500 W, Trusttech Co. Ltd) under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation, which was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell (91150 V, Newport Corporation).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic routes of dyes JY43–JY46 are displayed in Scheme 1. The intermediates 1,471019 and 1148 were prepared according to the previously reported procedures. Compound 2 was obtained by the alkylation of the intermediate 1; then, it was functionalized with NBS to give bromo-substituted compound 3, which was subsequently transformed into compounds 4 and 7via coupling reactions with trimethylsilylacetylene and bis(pinacolato)diboron, respectively. The deprotection of compound 4 was performed with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF, and the resultant terminal alkyne was subsequently reacted with compounds 10 and 11via Sonogashira cross-coupling to yield dye precursor compounds 5 and 6, respectively. The other precursor compounds 8 and 9 were obtained through Suzuki cross-coupling of intermediate 7 with compounds 10 and 11, respectively. Further hydrolysis of ester compounds 5 and 8 gave the target dyes JY43 and JY45, respectively. The dyes JY44 and JY46 containing cyanoacrylic acid acceptors were synthesized by the classic Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the four triazatruxene-based organic dyes in dichloromethane solutions and on TiO2 films are displayed in Fig. 2. The data for optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. In dichloromethane solutions, all four dyes exhibit two distinct absorption bands at 350–400 and 400–600 nm. The high-energy absorption bands below 400 nm can be attributed to π–π* transitions. The low-energy region at 400–600 nm can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from triazatruxene donors to electron acceptors.49 The maximum absorption peak of JY43 with carboxylic acid as the anchoring group/electron acceptor appears at 469 nm. A 12 nm red-shift has been observed for the dye JY44 by replacing carboxylic acid with cyanoacrylic acid which features a conjugated structure and stronger electron-withdrawing ability. For the same reason, a more significant red-shift (33 nm) has also been found for JY46 relative to that of JY45. The incorporation of acetylene between triazatruxene donor and BDT moiety is also in favor of the expansion of the dyes’ conjugated structures, causing red-shifted onset absorption of JY43 relative to that of JY45 in visible region. When adsorbed on TiO2 films, as shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption ranges of dyes JY43–JY46 are broadened compared to the corresponding absorption spectra in solution, which is favorable for harvesting solar light.

Cyclic voltammetry assessment was carried out using a classical three-electrode system in dicholoromethane to survey the redox behavior and the system was standardized by Fc/Fc+ (0.63 V vs. NHE) with 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte.50 The cyclic voltammetry curves for JY43–JY46 are shown in Fig. 3, and the pertinent data are displayed in Table 1. The first oxidation potentials (Eox) of JY43–JY46 were 0.94, 0.99, 0.89 and 0.93 V (vs. NHE), respectively, corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Clearly, the HOMO levels of JY43 and JY44 were more positive than those of JY45 and JY46, respectively, mainly due to the presence of an additional ethynyl unit. After employing electron-withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor, the HOMO levels of both JY44 and JY46 slightly shifted downward in comparison to those of JY43 and JY45, respectively. As a result, the dye JY44 containing both ethynyl unit and cyanoacrylic acid in its skeleton showed the most positive HOMO level. The band gaps E0–0 of the dyes were calculated by E0–0 = 1240/λint, and the parameter λint was estimated by their onset wavelengths in UV-absorption spectra.51 Because of an obvious red-shift in the absorption spectra, the E0–0 levels of JY44 (1.83 eV) and JY46 (1.82 eV) were narrower than those of JY43 (2.06 eV) and JY45 (2.09 eV), respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of JY43–JY46 were calculated by Eox − E0−0,52 to be −1.12, −0.84, −1.20 and −0.89 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels matched well with those of iodine redox couples (0.4 V vs. NHE) and TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring efficient dye regeneration and electron injection.

3.3. Theoretical calculations
To optimize the geometric and electronic structures of the dyes JY43–JY46, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed based on the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set with Gaussian 03 package.53 The octyl groups of dyes were replaced by methyl groups to save calculation time. The frontier molecular orbitals of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the four dyes are shown in Fig. 4. The optimized configurations exhibited that triazatruxene core has an axisymmetric rigid planar structure, which can promote electron distribution along the entire donor system. Apparently, the insertion of ethynyl unit between the triazatruxene donor and BTD moiety resulted in extension of molecule conjugation and slight improvement of molecule planarity. The dihedral angles between the donor and π-bridge of JY43 and JY44 were 25.3° and 28.5°, respectively, which were smaller than those of JY45 (36.5°) and JY46 (32.7°). A more planarized conformation is beneficial for obtaining better electron delocalization and facilitating the intramolecular electronic communication. It was found that the HOMOs of all four dyes were mainly located on the triazatruxene core and neighboring BTD unit, while the LUMOs were distributed on the carboxylic acid/cyanoacrylic acid acceptors and partly extended to BTD moieties. As a consequence, such electronic distribution in dyes was beneficial for the charge transfer from the excited dyes to the TiO2 conduction band.

3.4. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances and parameters of the DSSCs were determined under a simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with iodine redox electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.1 M GuSCN and 0.6 M PMII in acetonitrile, and the active area of the cells was 0.196 cm2. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the dyes are plotted in Fig. 5a, and detailed photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. The dyes JY43 and JY44 showed higher Jsc values relative to those of dyes JY45 and JY46, respectively, indicating that the extended conjugate structures obtained by inserting acetylene groups endowed dyes JY43 and JY44 with a more efficient light absorption ability. Similar to the above mentioned data, in comparison to dyes JY43 and JY45, cyanoacrylic acid acceptors with larger conjugate structures than simple carboxyl acid acceptors made an obvious Jsc improvement in dyes JY44 and JY46. With respect to another important performance factor Voc, dye molecules with a single carboxyl acid acceptor seemed beneficial to obtain higher Voc in contrast with those having cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. To achieve the best device efficiency, a good balance between Voc and Jsc should thus be carefully assessed in the structural design of dyes. Finally, the dye JY43 with an ethynyl unit and a carboxyl as the electron acceptor exhibited the highest PCE of 7.51% (a Jsc of 14.97 mA cm−2, a Voc of 793 mV and a FF of 0.632), which nearly reached about 91% PCE of that of the commercial N719-based cells.

To further investigate the different Jsc values of the four dyes, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the DSSCs based on JY43–JY46 were obtained. As shown in the IPCE spectra (Fig. 5b), all these dyes exhibited broad spectral responses within a wavelength range of 350–650 nm; especially, JY44 and JY46 showed broader spectral responses within 350–720 nm wavelength range. The IPCE responses of the four dyes were in agreement with the trends of their UV-vis absorption spectra. The spectra onsets of JY43–JY46 were at 640, 670, 720 and 720 nm, respectively. Noticeably, the dye JY44-based cells gave over 60% IPCE values from 380 to 630 nm, and this result also agreed well with the highest Jsc value in photovoltaic measurements. Meanwhile, the dye JY45 had a lower Jsc than the other three dyes because of the weak IPCE response in the wavelength range of 350–450 nm. The IPCE measurements could well explain the differences in Jsc values among the four dyes.
3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the dark to investigate the electron recombination effect of four dyes JY43–JY46 in DSSCs.54 The EIS Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 6, and the tests were performed in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under a bias of −0.75 V. The interfacial charge transfer resistances (Rct) at the TiO2/dyes/electrolyte interface are related to the larger semicircle section on the right of the Nyquist plots.55 A larger radius of the semicircle means a larger resistance for the electron recombination, which is beneficial for a higher value of Voc.56 As shown in Fig. 6a, the fitted Rct decreased in the order of JY43 (93 Ω) > JY45 (74 Ω) > JY46 (44 Ω) > JY44 (28 Ω), and the trend was in good accordance with the order of Voc of JY43 (793 mV) > JY45 (775 mV) > JY46 (743 mV) > JY44 (707 mV). In addition to the interfacial Rct, the electron lifetime (τ) is another important parameter that affects Voc values of DSSCs; a longer lifetime means a lower current in DSSCs in the dark and corresponds to the higher photovoltage values. The electron lifetime which can be calculated from the peak frequency (f) at lower frequency region in the Bode phase plots by using τ = 1/(2πf) was enhanced in the order of JY44 (8.4 ms) < JY46 (14.0 ms) < JY45 (20.7 ms) < JY43 (25.6 ms). This could further explain the highest Voc value (793 mV) of the dye JY43-based cell.

4. Conclusions
In summary, novel dyes JY43–JY46 based on the triazatruxene donor were designed and synthesized for DSSCs. Special focus was set on the effects of ethynyl unit and different electron acceptors on the photovoltaic performance of metal-free organic dyes. The incorporation of ethynyl unit and cyanoacrylic acid in the dye structure proved that they could obviously promote the light harvesting ability and assist to gain a higher Jsc. Cyanoacrylic acid, which has been considered as the most powerful acceptor to fabricate organic dyes for highly efficient DSSCs, ensured dye JY46 a better PCE in comparison to JY45 with carboxylic acid electron acceptor. However, for dyes containing one inserted ethynyl unit, JY43 with a carboxylic acid acceptor seemed more effective relative to JY44 with cyanoacrylic acid acceptor because of its much higher Voc value of 793 mV (vs. 707 mV for JY44). These results indicate that there is no privileged structure that must be involved in the design of metal-free organic dyes for highly efficient DSSCs, and a structure that takes into account a good balance between Jsc and Voc should be first considered.
