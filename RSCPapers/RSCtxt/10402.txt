1. Introduction
Rapid economic and social development has led to a dramatic increase in fossil fuel consumption.1,2 Over-dependence on fossil energy brings about two major challenges to the sustainable development of human society: energy crisis and environmental pollution.3 To address these two issues, the development of renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources is significant.4,5 Solar energy is widely distributed and abundant in reserves, and solar energy conversion becomes a hot topic.6–9 Recently, semiconductor photocatalysis has emerged as a green technology that converts solar energy into chemical fuels with a high calorific value at ambient temperature and pressure.10–12 For instance, photocatalytic water splitting can produce hydrogen (H2) from water, and photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction can convert CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons.13–15 Although photocatalysis seems to be an ideal approach for solar energy conversion, the low photocatalytic efficiency hinders its practical utilization.
The main reason for the low efficiency of photocatalysts is the massive loss of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and this problem is even more severe in single semiconductor photocatalysts.16–18 To understand the causes for the poor photocatalytic performance of a single photocatalyst, the dynamics of photogenerated carriers in a single semiconductor are analyzed (Fig. 1). Excitons are produced in attoseconds (as) to femtoseconds (fs) after photoexcitation. Then the excitons rapidly dissociate into free high-energy electrons and holes, which respectively decay to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the semiconductor within fs. Subsequently, there are two basic quenching pathways for electrons and holes: (1) recombination of electrons and holes inside the photocatalyst under strong Coulombic forces with the timescale varying from picoseconds (ps) to nanoseconds (ns); (2) migration of electrons (or holes) to the photocatalyst surface on the timescale of ps and participation in the reduction reaction (or the oxidation reaction) in ns to microseconds (μs).19 Because the total time of carrier migration and reaction is much longer than that of charge recombination, the majority of photogenerated carriers recombine inside the photocatalyst before migrating to the photocatalyst surface for redox reactions.20–22 Therefore, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers can effectively improve the photocatalytic efficiency of a single photocatalyst.23,24 Recently, the construction of a heterojunction photocatalyst (HP) has become a promising strategy to achieve spatial separation of electrons and holes, thus allowing more photogenerated carriers to participate in photocatalytic reactions.25–27 Various efficient heterojunctions have been reported, including semiconductor/metal heterojunctions, semiconductor/carbon heterojunctions, semiconductor/semiconductor heterojunctions and multicomponent heterojunctions.28–31 To reveal the mechanism for the improved photocatalytic performance of HPs, it is necessary to study the electron transfer kinetics in HPs. Since the electron transfer usually occurs between fs and ps, time-resolved spectroscopy with sufficient temporal resolution is able to monitor this ultrafast process.

In the past decades, the femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) technique has demonstrated great potential in the fields of photochemistry and photophysics.32–34 Typical TRPL spectroscopy can only measure the decay kinetics of photogenerated electrons on a nanosecond timescale. In contrast, fs-TAS can monitor the ultrafast electron dynamics on the femtosecond to the picosecond timescale. Fs-TAS, as a commonly used “pump–probe” technique, is a powerful tool for studying the energy level structure and charge relaxation processes in photoexcited semiconductors.35 Specifically, fs-TAS provides a dynamic image showing the number of carriers occupied in each energy level of the semiconductor as a function of time.36,37 Besides, fs-TAS can reveal the relaxation process of photogenerated carriers from high-energy excited states to the ground states, such as the electron transition from the conduction band (CB) to the valence band (VB) in semiconductors.38,39 More importantly, the electron transfer kinetics between energy levels in HPs can be obtained by analyzing the fs-TAS results.40–42 In practical fs-TAS measurements, a semiconductor photocatalyst is excited by a high-energy femtosecond monochromatic laser (pump pulse). Then, a low-energy white pulse (probe pulse) is applied to detect the occupancy of photogenerated carriers in semiconductor energy levels. The time delay between the pump pulse and probe pulse is adjusted through an optical delay line, and the relaxation process is explained in detail based on the variation of the excited carrier number with the delay time.43 Consequently, the fs-TAS technique can provide insight into the dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes in HPs. Recently, the fs-TAS technique has been adopted as an important tool to study the electron transfer in HPs. These studies clearly reveal the electron transfer pathways in HPs and clarify the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of electron dynamics. However, to the best of our knowledge, a summary article devoted entirely to the applications of fs-TAS in HPs has never been reported. Hence, a timely report is important.
Herein, we present a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the application of fs-TAS to elucidate electron transfer mechanisms in various HPs. First, the fundamentals of the fs-TAS measurements in semiconductor photocatalysts are introduced. Afterwards, the applications of fs-TAS in semiconductor/metal HPs, semiconductor/carbon HPs, semiconductor/semiconductor HPs and multicomponent HPs are discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and perspectives on the application prospect of fs-TAS in photocatalysis are proposed. This feature article will provide guidance for characterizing the dynamics of photogenerated carriers in HPs by fs-TAS.
2. Fundamentals of fs-TAS
2.1 Principles of fs-TAS equipment
Prior to discussing the applications of fs-TAS in photocatalysis, it is important to understand the basic principles of fs-TAS. The detailed working principle of the fs-TAS equipment is displayed in Fig. 2. The fs-TAS equipment consists of a femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser system, an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and a transient spectrometer. The femtosecond Ti: Sapphire laser system produces a femtosecond laser beam with a central wavelength of 800 nm, which is split into two beams with different intensities using a beam splitter. Afterward, the stronger beam propagates the pulse period through a chopper, and then forms a short-wavelength pump pulse through OPA to excite the sample from the ground state to the excited state. The weaker beam passes through the optical delay line and interacts with the sapphire to produce a continuous white pulse, which serves as a probe pulse to irradiate the sample. Finally, the pump pulse and the probe pulse overlap at the same point on the sample. The probe pulse passes through the sample and enters the detector, while the pump pulse going through the sample is blocked using a stopper.44 The optical delay line alters the optical path difference between the pump pulse and the probe pulse which allows a time delay between them so that these two pulses can reach the sample at different times. The differential optical absorption spectra of the sample are obtained by measuring the absorption of the probe pulse with and without pump pulse irradiation, respectively. As the delay time between the pump pulse and the probe pulse keeps changing, the signal intensity of the probe pulse passing through the sample varies, indicating a change in the number of charge carriers in the excited state.45 Therefore, the relaxation kinetics of charge carriers from the excited state to the ground state are obtained by analysing the signals above.

2.2 Principles of the fs-TAS spectrum
To gain more insight into the principles of the fs-TAS spectrum, the optical absorption signals of the sample are analyzed in detail. Essentially, the fs-TAS spectrum is a kind of differential optical absorption spectrum, which is obtained by conversion of transmittance. In general, the detector measures the transmittance of the sample (T), and the absorbance of the sample (A) can be calculated according to the following formula:46  where I0 and I are the pulse intensity of the probe before and after passing through the sample, respectively. Furthermore, the change in the probe pulse absorption (ΔA) of the sample is defined using the following equation:  where Aw and Awo represent the sample's absorption of the probe pulse with and without pump pulse excitation. Iw and Iwo are the intensities of the probe pulse after passing through the sample with and without pump pulse excitation, respectively. Actually, ΔA is a variable related to the probe pulse wavelength and the delay time between the pump and probe pulses. When the delay time between the pump pulse and probe pulse is changed by the optical delay line, ΔA at different wavelengths is recorded.47 Hence, an image of a three-dimensional (3D) function ΔA(λ, t) with relation to the wavelength and delay time is obtained. From the 3D image of ΔA(λ, t), the variation of ΔA with the wavelength for a certain delay time can be distinguished. Besides, the change of ΔA with the delay time at a specific wavelength can also be acquired, reflecting the variation of the number of excited state charge carriers with the delay time at that wavelength.
Afterwards, the relationship between the ΔA signal and the dynamics of photogenerated carriers in a semiconductor is further discussed. When no pump pulse is available and only the probe pulse irradiates on the semiconductor sample, the semiconductor absorbs part of the probe pulse, and the absorption intensity is determined by the number of ground state electrons in the VB and the absorption coefficient of the semiconductor (Fig. 3(a)). When the pump pulse irradiates the semiconductor sample, the ground state electrons in the VB are excited to the CB of the semiconductor. Consequently, the number of electrons in VB decreases, and the number of electrons in the CB increases. When the semiconductor sample is irradiated by the probe pulse again, the probe pulse absorption by the sample reduces (Iw > Iwo) due to the decreased number of ground state electrons in the VB. As a result, a negative ΔA signal is obtained (Fig. 3(b)), which is referred to as ground state bleaching (GSB). Furthermore, some excited state electrons continue to absorb the probe pulse that cannot be absorbed by the ground state electrons, and jump to the excited states with higher energy. Hence, the sample absorption of the probe pulse increases (Iw < Iwo) and a positive ΔA signal is detected (Fig. 3(c)), which is called excited state absorption (ESA) or photo-induced absorption (PIA). In addition, the semiconductor sample in the excited state is unstable and will return to the ground state due to stimulated radiation or spontaneous radiation. During this process, the semiconductor sample fluoresces, resulting in an increased intensity of light collected by the detector (Iw > Iwo). Therefore, a negative ΔA signal is generated (Fig. 3(d)), which is known as simulated emission (SE).48 In conclusion, three different ΔA signals can be distinguished in fs-TAS measurements, which are ascribed to the electron transition and relaxation in semiconductors (Fig. 3(e)).

According to the ΔA signals discussed above, there are two kinds of fs-TAS spectra. In a photoexcited semiconductor, before the excited electron falls from the energy levels of the CB to that of the VB, the electron will lose part of its energy by interacting with the surrounding particles. The lost energy dissipates mainly in the form of heat. This energy loss will cause a certain energy difference between the excitation light and the emitted light (fluorescence). Consequently, the luminescence spectrum (fluorescence spectrum) will shift to a lower energy (redshift) compared to the absorption spectrum. This energy difference or the difference between the fluorescence wavelength and the absorption wavelength is called the Stokes shift.49 Besides, the magnitude of the Stokes shift differs due to the different physicochemical properties and energy level structures of various semiconductors.50 In the fs-TAS spectrum, the GSB signal is related to the steady-state absorption spectrum; while the SE signal corresponds to the fluorescence spectrum.51 In the case of a small Stokes shift, the wavelengths of the GSB and the SE peaks partially overlap, and the final fs-TAS spectrum is the sum of the GSB, SE, and EAS peaks (Fig. 4(a)). In the case of a large Stokes shift, the wavelength of the GSB peak is not in the same range as that of the SE peak, and thus three peaks are separated in the fs-TAS spectrum (Fig. 4(b)).

3. Applications of fs-TAS in HPs
Compared with single photocatalysts, HPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance due to spatially separated photogenerated electrons and holes.52,53 To elucidate the performance enhancement mechanism of heterojunctions, it is crucial to investigate the dynamics of photogenerated carriers inside HPs, especially the ultrafast interfacial electron transfer process.54–56 The fs-TAS measurements can monitor the electron transfer process in ps and fs, and their applications in HPs deserve extensive attention. This article will introduce the applications of fs-TAS in four types of HPs including semiconductor/metal HPs, semiconductor/carbon HPs, semiconductor/semiconductor HPs, and multicomponent HPs.
3.1 Semiconductor/metal HPs
To suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in single semiconductor photocatalysts, the construction of semiconductor/metal heterojunctions is an effective method.57–59 Metal nanoparticles or nanosheets are decorated on the surface of single semiconductor photocatalysts to prepare semiconductor/metal HPs. Generally, metal cocatalysts can be categorized into noble metals (such as Au, Ag, Pt and Pd) and non-noble metals (such as Ni and Cu).60,61 Metal cocatalysts exhibit two merits in improving the photocatalytic performance of a single semiconductor. First, most metal cocatalysts serve as electron acceptors, extracting photogenerated electrons from the CB of the semiconductor to their empty electron-accepting energy levels.62 Second, metal cocatalysts can provide more reactive sites for the activation of reactant molecules and promote photocatalytic redox reactions.63 In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of semiconductor/metal HPs also benefits from the Schottky barrier formed at the semiconductor/metal interface.64,65 The formation of the CdS/Pt Schottky junction is taken as an example. CdS is a typical n-type semiconductor with a higher Fermi level (Ef) position than that of Pt (Fig. 5(a)). When CdS and Pt are combined, electrons will transfer from CdS to Pt until an aligned Ef is reached (Fig. 5(b)). The energy bands near the CdS interface are bent upwards and the CdS interface is positively charged, resulting from the depletion of electrons. Therefore, a space-charge separation region (also known as the Schottky barrier) is created. Under photoexcitation, the photogenerated electrons will migrate to the CdS interface. And those photogenerated electrons with sufficient energy to overcome the Schottky barrier will transfer to Pt (Fig. 5(c)). Besides, the Schottky barrier also prevents the inverse electron transfer from Pt to CdS. As a result, the unidirectional transfer of photogenerated electrons from CdS to Pt is realized and the photogenerated carriers inside CdS are effectively separated.

Some research works have successfully revealed the interfacial electron transfer kinetics in semiconductor/metal HPs by fs-TAS. Zhang et al. prepared Pt-nanoparticle-decorated CdS nanorods and studied the photogenerated electron dynamics in CdS/Pt Schottky junction photocatalysts during water splitting.66 In single CdS, three electron transfer pathways are identified after photoexcitation, which are trapping of photogenerated electrons at shallow states, recombination of free electrons and trapped holes, and band-to-band recombination of electron–hole pairs. Besides, Pt decoration can release the electrons trapped at shallow states and establish an ultrafast interfacial electron transfer tunnel from CdS to Pt. To investigate the influence of H2O on the interfacial electron transfer kinetics during water splitting, fs-TAS measurements are performed on CdS/Pt powders dispersed in acetonitrile (ACN) and H2O, respectively (labeled as CdS/Pt–ACN and CdS/Pt–H2O). GSB peaks can be observed in the fs-TAS spectra of both CdS/Pt–ACN and CdS/Pt–H2O (Fig. 6(a) and (b)), reflecting only the electron population at the CBM of CdS. After fitting the recovery kinetics of the PB peaks (Fig. 6(c) and (d)), the average lifetime (τave) decreases from 1287.6 ps for CdS/Pt–ACN to 886.3 ps for CdS/Pt–H2O, suggesting faster electron quenching of CdS/Pt HPs during water splitting. Furthermore, the lifetime corresponding to the interfacial electron transfer (τ1) is reduced in CdS/Pt–H2O, indicating accelerated electron transfer from CdS to Pt (Fig. 6(e) and (f)). Hence, the electron dynamics in the photocatalyst are related to the solvent used for dispersion, and the timely consumption of electrons on the metal cocatalyst facilitates the interfacial electron transfer in the Schottky junction.

To further study the effect of metal size on the photocatalytic performance and charge separation efficiency of semiconductor/metal HPs, different sizes of Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the apexes of CdS nanorods by Liu et al.67 Both photocatalytic H2 production tests and fs-TAS measurements are performed in alkaline aqueous solution (pH = 12) with L-cysteine as a sacrificial donor (SD). Similar to the CdS/Pt HPs discussed above, the electrons transfer from CdS to Pt and participate in the reduction reaction to produce H2, while the remaining holes in CdS are consumed in the oxidation of SD (Fig. 7(a)). Upon increasing the Pt size from ∼0.7 nm to ∼3 nm, the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency gradually increases (Fig. 7(b)), and the half-lifetime of GSB recovery kinetics decreases from ∼2.2 ns to ∼8 ps (Fig. 7(c)). After further processing of the data, both the internal quantum efficiency (QEH2) and interfacial electron transfer quantum efficiency (QEET) increase with increasing the Pt diameter (Fig. 7(d)). More interestingly, the interfacial electron transfer time (τET) decreases as the Pt diameter increases, and thus the interfacial electron transfer rate increases following a scaling law of d5.6 (Fig. 7(e)). In conclusion, faster interfacial electron transfer contributes to higher photocatalytic efficiency of CdS/Pt HPs. Furthermore, this work provides new ideas for the development of efficient semiconductor/metal HPs from the perspective of adjusting the size of metal particles.

Another important effect on the interfacial electron transfer in semiconductor/metal HPs is the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of plasmonic metals, including Au, Ag, Cu, and Bi.68,69 When the incident photon frequency matches the vibration frequency of the metal, the metal absorbs the photon energy, producing a resonance absorption peak in the absorption spectrum, which is the SPR effect.70,71 The hot electrons excited by SPR have higher energy than the Ef of the metal and can cross the Schottky barrier into the CB of the semiconductor. This electron backflow kinetics has also been verified by several research works. Liu et al. prepared Au/CdS core/shell nanocrystals with an atomically organized interface and investigated the plasmon-induced hot electron injection from Au to CdS by mid-infrared fs-TAS (Fig. 8).72 The time of the hot electron injection process is ∼0.31 ps, and the quantum yield of hot electron injection is ∼48%. A similar hot electron injection phenomenon is also observed in TiO2/Au and TiO2/Ag, and this process can be adjusted by regulating the physical contact and the spectral overlap between the plasmonic metals and the semiconductors.73 In addition, the stoichiometry of the semiconductor has an effect on the electron transfer kinetics. Sekhar et al. found that the ratio between Cd and Se could influence the number of defect states in CdSe quantum dots (QDs).74 Compared with Cd-rich CdSe QDs, the hole trapping and nonradiative charge recombination are faster in Se-rich CdSe QDs, resulting in lower electron transfer efficiency. Based on the above discussions, a systematic study of the interfacial electron transfer kinetics can guide the design and synthesis of high-efficiency semiconductor/metal HPs.

3.2 Semiconductor/carbon HPs
Although noble metal cocatalysts can effectively enhance the photocatalytic performance of a single photocatalyst, they are expensive and scarce.75 To solve this problem, carbon-based cocatalysts are promising candidates.76,77 Carbon materials, including activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon quantum dots, graphene, graphdiyne, and fullerene (C60), are widely studied as cocatalysts for the construction of semiconductor/carbon HPs.78–80 In addition to the advantages of metal cocatalysts, carbon cocatalysts also possess large surface areas, good physical and chemical stability, and abundant reactive sites.81 The Ef positions of carbon materials can be adjusted through elemental doping and morphology modulation.82 Depending on the Ef positions of the carbon material and semiconductor, the carbon cocatalyst can act as either an electron acceptor or a hole collector for the semiconductor. Consequently, dissecting the dynamics of interfacial carrier transfer is essential to elucidate the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic performance of semiconductor/carbon HPs.
Generally, most carbon cocatalysts (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerenes) can accept photogenerated electrons from semiconductors. And the semiconductor/carbon heterojunctions are confirmed to be Schottky junctions.83,84 Some research works have dealt with the electron transfer kinetics in Schottky junctions based on carbon cocatalysts. Wang et al. grew CdS nanorods on fullerene-modified graphene (CdS-F/G) by a conventional hydrothermal method.85 The electron transfer mechanism of CdS-F/G is investigated by fs-TAS and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Compared with single CdS (Fig. 9(a)), CdS-F/G has a broader PIA peak (Fig. 9(b)), indicating a hole trapping process. By analyzing the recovery kinetics of ground state bleaching (XB) (Fig. 9(c)) and PIA (Fig. 9(d)), three types of lifetimes are obtained (Fig. 9(e)), including interfacial electron transfer from the CB of CdS to F/G (∼30.3 ps), hole trapping on the CdS surface (∼44 ps), and recombination of electrons with the trapped holes (∼172.6 ns). The interfacial electron transfer and hole-trapping process ensure the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in space. Besides, the sub-microsecond-lived excited states provide sufficient lifetimes for the charge carriers to participate in photocatalytic reactions. These two features endow CdS-F/G HPs with improved photocatalytic performance and photostability. This work reveals the essence of the improved photocatalytic performance of semiconductor/carbon HPs from the viewpoint of electron/hole transfer kinetics.

Recently, several studies have also confirmed that carbon dots (CDs) can serve as the hole collector. As reported by Wang et al., microwave-synthesized carbon dots (mCDs) have unique hole-accepting properties when hybridized with carbon nitride (CN), while typical sonication-prepared CD (sCD) act as electron acceptors when deposited on CN.86 According to the TAS spectra of CN with and without electron scavengers (Ag+ ions), the PIA peak at ∼700 nm is attributed to the photogenerated electrons in CN. The half-lifetime of PIA recovery kinetics increases from 25 μs for CN to 160 μs for mCD/CN, because the interfacial hole transfer from CN to mCD leads to the retarded recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes inside CN. The PIA recovery kinetics of sCD/CN has a much lower half-lifetime (40 μs) compared to mCD/CN (Fig. 10(a)). This indicates that the interfacial hole transfer in mCD/CN is more efficient than the interfacial electron transfer in sCD/CN. Besides, the PIA decay curves are linear when converted to the log–log plots (Fig. 10(b)), illustrating the trapping–detrapping dynamics. Ultimately, the prolonged electron lifetime of mCD/CN contributes to methanol production during photocatalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 10(c)). In addition, Wang et al. further developed mCD/oxygen-modified CN HP and found that holes in the oxygen-modified CN could be injected into the CD with ∼75% efficiency before becoming unreactive through trapping.87 In conclusion, it is instructive to reveal the interfacial carrier transfer kinetics for the design of efficient carbon cocatalysts.

3.3 Semiconductor/semiconductor HPs
Many previous studies have found that HPs composed of two semiconductors with a staggered band structure exhibit higher photocatalytic efficiency than the single photocatalyst.88 The enhanced photocatalytic performance is explained by the electron transfer mechanism of type-II or Z-scheme heterojunctions. However, there are many problems and drawbacks in type-II and Z-scheme heterojunctions, which have been expounded.89–91 To address this issue, the S-scheme heterojunction (step-scheme) concept was proposed in 2019.92 The S-Scheme heterojunction typically consists of an oxidation semiconductor (OS) and a reduction semiconductor (RS), and the RS should simultaneously have higher CB and Ef positions than the OS (Fig. 11(a)). When the RS and OS are coupled, electrons will transfer from the RS to the OS at the interface because the Ef position of the RS is higher than that of the OS. The CB and VB near the RS interface are bent upward and the RS interface is positively charged due to electron depletion. Simultaneously, the CB and VB near the OS interface are bent downward and the OS interface is negatively charged owing to electron acquisition. Hence, a built-in electric field (BEF) with the direction pointing from the RS to the OS is formed at the interface (Fig. 11(b)). When the RS and OS are photoexcited, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of the OS will transfer to the VB of the RS driven by the BEF (Fig. 11(c)). Besides, photogenerated electrons in the CB of the RS further transfer to the RS surface; whereas photogenerated holes in the VB of the OS transfer to the OS surface under the effect of the BEF. In conclusion, photogenerated carriers with strong redox ability are spatially separated and retained in S-scheme HPs. To seek the evidence of S-scheme heterojunctions, fs-TAS is a powerful technique that can directly monitor the ultrafast electron transfer process at the RS/OS interface.93

Significant research has been carried out to reveal the interfacial electron transfer kinetics in S-scheme HPs using fs-TAS. Wang et al. studied the dynamics of photogenerated carriers in TiO2/polydopamine (TiO2/PDA) S-scheme HPs by fs-TAS and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy.94 Both the fs-TAS spectra of TiO2 and the best-performing TiO2/PDA (TP0.5) have the GSB peaks at ∼375 nm (Fig. 12(a)). As shown in the fitting results of GSB recovery kinetics (Fig. 12(b)), the GSB signal decays quickly within 30 ps. The shorter lifetime (τ1) in the femtosecond timescale corresponds to electron trapping in TiO2, and the longer lifetime (τ2) can be attributed to electron transfer kinetics. The increased proportion of τ2 in TP0.5 compared to TiO2 suggests a new electron transfer pathway in TP0.5, which can be assigned to the interfacial electron transfer in TiO2/PDA S-scheme HPs. Hence, the electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of PDA takes place within ∼5 ps. Furthermore, the τave value of TP0.5 in the TRPL spectra reflects the band-to-band recombination of electrons and holes in TiO2 and is ∼10 ns (Fig. 12(c)). In summary, the interfacial electron transfer occurs on a much shorter timescale than the charge recombination, leading to the efficient separation of electrons and holes in TiO2/PDA S-scheme HPs (Fig. 12(d)). This work elucidates the performance enhancement mechanism of S-scheme HPs from the perspective of interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

A more systematic fs-TAS study of electron transfer in the TiO2/Bi2O3S-scheme heterojunction is conducted by He et al.95 The fs-TAS measurements were performed on TiO2 (TO) and TiO2/Bi2O3 with optimal photocatalytic performance (TBO40). In the fs-TAS spectra of TO and TBO40 (Fig. 13(a) and (b)), the GSB peak at ∼395 nm and the broad ESA peak at 425–550 nm can be distinguished. To determine whether the signal in the fs-TAS spectrum is contributed by electrons or holes, control experiments with the addition of an electron scavenger (e.g. AgNO3 and benzoquinone) or a hole scavenger (e.g. lactic acid and ethanol) should be conducted. In this work, the fs-TAS spectra of TO with an electron scavenger (AgNO3) or a hole scavenger (furfuryl alcohol) are analyzed. The electron (or hole) scavenger can extract the photogenerated electrons (or holes) from the semiconductor, thus suppressing charge recombination. Both GSB and ESA signals change with the introduction of electron or hole scavengers. This indicates that the dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes contribute to both GSB and EAS signals. According to the fitting results of GSB recovery kinetics within the first 100 ps (Fig. 13(c)), the τave values of holes increase from 148.5 ps for TO–AgNO3 to 232.5 ps for TBO40, suggesting the electron-accepting ability of Bi2O3. This phenomenon also implies the efficient interfacial electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of Bi2O3 (Fig. 13(d)). In addition, Xu et al. revealed the interfacial transfer kinetics in TiO2/Ce2S3 HP by fs-TAS.96 The photogenerated electrons in the CB of TiO2 are easily trapped by the shallow impurity states in TiO2 (∼3.92 ps), and then the trapped electrons are released and further transferred to the VB of Ce2S3 (∼43 ps). All the works discussed above indirectly reflect the interfacial electron transfer in S-scheme HPs, and the electron transfer kinetics are obtained by fitting the recovery kinetics of GSB. However, the recombination of electrons in the CB of OS and holes in the VB of RS will lead to fluorescence as well as a negative ΔA in fs-TAS spectra, which is often neglected. Therefore, future studies can focus on the detection and analysis of this negative ΔA signal caused by the interfacial electron transfer in S-scheme HPs.

3.4 Multicomponent HPs
To combine the merits of various heterojunctions, the construction of multicomponent HPs is a feasible approach. For instance, dual-cocatalyst-deposited semiconductors exhibit better photocatalytic performance than single-cocatalyst-modified semiconductors.97,98 In general, the dual cocatalysts are composed of a reduction cocatalyst (RC) as an electron acceptor and an oxidation cocatalyst (OC) as a hole acceptor.99 Electrons and holes can be extracted into the RC and OC, respectively (Fig. 14(a)). Hence, compared with single cocatalyst-modified semiconductors, the charge separation is more efficient in semiconductors with dual cocatalysts. In addition, the introduction of cocatalysts can further boost the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor/semiconductor HPs.100 Taking S-scheme HP as an example, depositing an RC on the RS surface can further extract the electrons from the CB of the RS to the RC; while modifying an OC on the OS surface can further extract the holes from the VB of the OS to the RC (Fig. 14(b)). Hence, the main reason for the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of multicomponent HPs is the more effective separation of electrons and holes in space.

Some research works have prepared efficient multicomponent HPs and studied the dynamics of photogenerated carriers by fs-TAS. Bie et al. prepared CdS hollow spheres decorated with MoO2 and MoS2 dual cocatalysts (CdMoOS) and found that MoS2 and MoO2 were the reduction and oxidation centers of lactic acid (LA)-assisted photocatalytic H2 production, respectively.101 The charge dynamics of CdS and CdMoOS with and without LA are studied using fs-TAS. Three signals are observed including the ESA peak at 470 nm, the GSB peak at 520 nm, and the SE peak at 650 nm. The intensity of the GSB and SE peaks respectively increases and decreases after the addition of LA (Fig. 15(a) and (b)), indicating the hole transfer from CdMoOS to LA and the inhibition of charge recombination. Based on the fitting results of GSB recovery kinetics (Fig. 15(c)), τave reduces from 12.6 ps for CdS to 10.7 ps for CdMoOS because the MoS2 and MoO2 cocatalysts respectively aid the formation of the interfacial electron and hole transfer pathways. Besides, the CdMoOS + LA has a longer τave (22.2 ps) than CdS + LA (16.1 ps), illustrating a more efficient consumption of holes in CdMoOS. According to the fitting results of EA recovery kinetics (Fig. 15(d)), the CdMoOS (or CdMoOS + LA) possesses a shorter τave value than CdS (or CdS + LA), suggesting significantly retarded charge recombination. Hence, the efficient extraction of photogenerated electrons and holes by MoS2 and MoO2 contributes to the high photocatalytic H2 activity of CdMoOS (Fig. 15(e)). In addition, Peng et al. used Ru/In dual-single atoms to modulate the charge separation in TiO2.102 The fs-TAS results confirm that the Ru single atoms can accept electrons from the CB of TiO2 and In single atoms can collect holes from the CB of TiO2. Through fs-TAS measurements, Zhang et al. also verified that cobalt molecular catalysts and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole can selectively and rapidly extract the photogenerated holes and electrons from the CdS nanorods.103 For cocatalyst-modified S-scheme HPs, Dong et al. revealed the electron dynamics of Ti3C2 quantum dot (QD)-modified TiO2/g-C3N4S-scheme HPs by fs-TAS.104 The fs-TAS results indicate that the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 will further transfer to Ti3C2 QDs. In conclusion, the dynamics of photogenerated carriers are more complicated in multicomponent HPs, so it is necessary to investigate them more intensively via the fs-TAS technique.

4. Conclusions
In this feature article, the basic principles of fs-TAS and the applications of fs-TAS measurements in various HPs are presented. Generally, highly efficient HPs can effectively separate photogenerated electrons and holes, and the dynamics of interfacial electron transfer is important to understand the reasons for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. The fs-TAS results show that the photocatalytic activity of HPs can be enhanced by rapid interfacial charge transfer and the timely consumption of photogenerated carriers by redox reactions. However, in most studies, the test conditions for the fs-TAS and photocatalytic reactions are inconsistent. The measuring conditions of fs-TAS include the dispersive solvent, the atmosphere, and the power and wavelength of the pump laser, which are worth studying systematically and deeply. Hence, further research on fs-TAS in photocatalysis should pay attention to the following aspects:
(1) The influence of solvent used for dispersion. Generally, the synthesized photocatalysts are powders that need to be dispersed in a solvent for fs-TAS measurements. The solvent used for dispersion should have no fs-TAS signals in the visible region to avoid interference with the signal of HPs. To study the dynamics of charge carriers within the HP, a solvent (such as ACN) that has no charge transfer and energy transfer with the HP should be chosen. If a semiconductor sample is dispersed in water for fs-TAS measurements, the reduction and oxidation reactions of the water will consume electrons and holes in the semiconductor. Hence, there are new decay pathways for photogenerated carriers in this case and the lifetime of the charge carriers will decrease. Furthermore, to investigate the charge dynamics of HPs during the practical photocatalytic reaction, the solvent utilized for fs-TAS measurements should be the same as that used for the photocatalytic reaction. In this case, electrons and holes will be consumed by the photocatalytic redox reaction, and the dynamics of photogenerated carriers are closer to the actual situation of photocatalysis.
(2) The effects of the atmosphere. The atmosphere during fs-TAS measurements will affect the dynamics of photogenerated carriers within the HP. When fs-TAS measurements are performed in air, both oxygen and CO2 affect the charge dynamics of the HP. In photocatalytic water splitting, the HP is sealed in a container and high-purity nitrogen is pumped into water to remove the air from the solvent and the environment. In addition, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is conducted under a CO2/N2 atmosphere and the air is also removed. Therefore, the atmosphere of fs-TAS measurements should be taken into account and preferably consistent with the actual photocatalytic reaction.
(3) The impacts of the power and wavelength of the pump laser. The power of the pump laser should be selected properly. Excessive laser power will result in the generation of numerous transient species which interact with each other, thus complicating the dynamics of photogenerated carriers within the HPs. Besides, high pump laser power can burn the HP samples. Hence, the pump laser power can be adjusted until the transient signal is dominated by the HPs with one exciton, which is beneficial for the analysis of electron transfer dynamics in HPs. On the other hand, the wavelength of the pump laser also influences the dynamics of photogenerated carriers, which deserves further investigation. For instance, to study the electron dynamics in the CBM of a semiconductor, it is reasonable to choose a pump laser with a wavelength close to the optical absorption edge of the semiconductor.
