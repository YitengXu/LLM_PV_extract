    , Accepted 13th October 2021First published on 13th October 2021AbstractWhile the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have been dramatically increased through the development of small molecular acceptors (SMAs), achieving eco-friendly solution processability of OSCs is a crucial prerequisite for their practical application. In this study, we develop three new, green solvent-processable SMAs (YSe–C3, YSe–C6, and YSe–C9) with different outer side-chains (n-propyl (C3), n-hexyl (C6), and n-nonyl (C9)), affording high-performance OSCs with non-halogenated solvent (o-xylene)-processed active layers. Also, the impact of both outer and inner side-chain engineering of these SMAs on the performance of eco-friendly fabricated OSCs is systematically investigated. The outer side-chain structure has a much more significant impact than the inner side-chain. For example, the PM6:YSe–C6 blend affords high-performance OSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16%, whereas the PCEs of the YSe–C3- and YSe–C9-based OSCs are only 11–14%. The lower PCEs of PM6:YSe–C3 and C9 are mainly attributed to reduced electron mobility and increased charge recombination, resulting from aggregate-containing non-optimal blend morphologies. Interestingly, the well-optimized morphology of the YSe–C6-based blend also affords OSC devices with active layer thickness-independent PCEs, up to a thickness of >400 nm, demonstrating the great potential for large-area device manufacturing via an eco-friendly printing process. Thus, optimizing the outer side-chain structure of Y-series SMAs is essential for producing green solvent-processed high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted a great deal of interest as power sources for wearable and portable devices owing to their high efficiency, tunable energy levels, and mechanical flexibility/stretchability.1–12 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been improved rapidly to surpass 17–18% through the development of Y-series small molecule acceptors (SMAs).13–27 However, the active layers of most efficient SMA-based OSCs are processed by using toxic halogenated solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF)) to ensure a desirable blend morphology based on enough processability. These solvents are very harmful to workers and require high-cost solvent-management systems to meet strict industrial regulations.28–34 Thus, it is urgent to optimize the chemical structures of Y-series SMAs that maintain superior electrical performance while achieving suitable processability in halogen-free solvents.
The side-chain engineering of Y-series SMAs is one of the effective strategies for increasing the solution processability in non-halogenated solvents.30,34–36 The central donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) core unit within Y-series SMAs featuring the A′–DAD–A′ structure can be modified by side-chain engineering at two major positions: (i) a position at the pyrrole rings next to the central benzothiadiazole unit (termed the inner side-chain position) and (ii) a position at the outermost thiophene (or selenophene) rings in the di-thienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (BTP) core (termed the outer side-chain position).37 Recently, Dong et al. developed an SMA named DTY6 by increasing the length of the inner side-chain of Y6 from ethylhexyl to decyltetradecyl. DTY6 yielded sufficient solubility and desirable crystalline properties, resulting in a PCE of 16%.34 Meanwhile, the outer side-chain was also reported as an important component affecting the performance of Y-series SMAs.17,22,38–41 Since the outer side-chain is located adjacent to the terminal groups of the BTP core, the torsional angle between the BTP core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) unit can be significantly varied through outer side-chain modification of the SMAs. This is important because the torsional angles determine the overall molecular conformation, which in turn greatly impacts their solution processability and the crystalline/electrical properties of SMA-based blend films.37,42 However, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of outer side-chain engineering on green solvent-processed, Y-series SMA-based OSCs has not been reported to date.
Herein, we develop a series of SMAs named YSe–Cx (x = 3, 6, or 9, representing the number of carbon atoms in the outer side-chains) to investigate the impact of the outer side-chain structure on the performance of green solvent-processed OSCs. Selenophene is used to replace thiophene at the outermost position of the BTP core to strengthen the intra- and intermolecular interactions of the SMAs and facilitate complementary light absorption with a high-performance benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymer donor (PM6).43 Among the three developed SMAs, the 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-3,9-dihexyl-12,13-dihydroselenopheno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]selenopheno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno-[3,2-b][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (YSe–C6) SMA shows high processability in o-xylene and most favorable compatibility with the PM6 donor. Owing to these beneficial properties, the PM6:YSe–C6 blend film yields an optimal morphology, leading to the highest PCE of 16.11% when processed in o-xylene. In contrast, the YSe–C3- and YSe–C9-based OSCs show lower PCEs of 11.63 and 14.20%, respectively. Furthermore, the PM6:YSe–C6 OSC exhibits high tolerance of PCEs against the active layer thickness. For example, even at a thickness of ∼400 nm, the YSe–C6-based OSCs show over 90% of the optimal PCE, whereas the YSe–C3-based device with a ∼400 nm-thick active layer affords only 44% of the PCE achieved with the optimal thickness. Relevant analyses of optical, electrical, and morphological properties are carefully carried out to support the trends of the OSC performance depending on the outer side-chain structure.
Results and discussion
The series of SMAs were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation between the dichlorinated IC end-groups and formylated selenophene-incorporated DAD units (di-thienoselenophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) (Scheme S1, Fig. S1–S3, and Table S1†).44 Detailed synthetic routes and conditions for the YSe–Cx SMAs are described in the ESI.† In the design of the YSe–Cx SMAs, the well-known BTP core structure was modified to strengthen the intra- and inter-molecular interactions and thus improve the optical and electrical properties.15 In particular, the outermost thiophenes of the BTP unit were replaced with selenophenes to enhance the quinoidal resonance effect and crystalline properties.45–47 This modification can induce stronger charge transport ability and narrower optical bandgaps.43 To investigate the effect of the outer side-chain structure of the SMAs, n-propyl (C3), n-hexyl (C6), or n-nonyl (C9) solubilizing groups were introduced as the outer side-chain to yield YSe–Cx (x = 3, 6, or 9), respectively. In this series, an identical alkyl chain (i.e., 2-hexyldecyl) was used as the inner side-chain. PM6 was employed as the polymer donor to construct the active layer with the YSe–Cx SMAs.
The molecular structures, energy level alignments, and light absorption spectra of the active layer materials in the thin-film state are shown in Fig. 1. The molecular properties of the PM6 and YSe–Cx SMAs are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1b, the energy levels of the three SMAs were well-matched with those of PM6 to enable efficient charge transfer.48,49 In detail, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the PM6 polymer were −5.50 and −3.56 eV, respectively, whereas the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the SMAs were estimated to be −5.65/−4.29, −5.67/−4.35, and −5.65/−4.32 eV for YSe–C3, YSe–C6, and YSe–C9, respectively (Fig. 1b and S4†). Thus, changes in the outer side-chain length had little effect on either the HOMO or LUMO energy levels. Fig. 1c and S5† show that the PM6 and YSe–Cx SMAs exhibit complementary light absorption spectra in the film states. The absorption spectra of the SMAs in the solution state in dilute o-xylene (0.03 mg mL−1) were similar, with the maximum peaks located near 760 nm (Fig. S6†). In the corresponding thin films, the maximum absorption peaks were red-shifted by 71, 97, and 99 nm for YSe–C3, YSe–C6, and YSe–C9, respectively. Consequently, the neat film of YSe–C3 showed relatively blue-shifted absorption characteristics compared to those of the other two SMAs in films. The absorption coefficients of the o-xylene-processed films increased from 8.0 × 104 to 8.5 × 104, and to 9.2 × 104 cm−1 for YSe–C3, YSe–C9, and YSe–C6, respectively. The higher absorption coefficient is beneficial for enhancing the light harvesting of the YSe–C6-based film.

The solubility of each material in o-xylene was measured to confirm its processability using a non-halogenated solvent (Fig. S7†).29 For the SMA series, the solubility in o-xylene was gradually increased with the outer side-chain length, from 32 to 55 and 72 mg mL−1 for YSe–C3, YSe–C6, and YSe–C9 SMAs, respectively. However, considering that the photoactive layers in this study were prepared with blend solutions of concentrations under 25 mg mL−1, all of the SMAs had sufficient solubility in o-xylene for the fabrication of OSCs. The solubility of PM6 (60 mg mL−1) was most comparable to that of YSe–C6.
To examine the potential of YSe–Cx SMAs in OSC devices, devices with a normal-type structure were fabricated. The detailed conditions for the OSC fabrication are described in the Experimental section of the ESI.†o-Xylene was chosen as a green processing solvent because it has a relatively wide processing window in terms of compatibility with polymers, viscosity, and a boiling point suitable for solution processing.50,51 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The photovoltaic parameters (i.e., open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE) of the OSCs are summarized in Table 2. Notably, the PCEs were greatly affected by the outer side-chain lengths. For example, YSe–C3 and YSe–C9-based OSCs achieved PCE values of 11.63 and 14.20%, respectively. In contrast, the YSe–C6-based device showed a significantly enhanced PCE of 16.11%. The Voc values of the three devices were almost identical in the range of 0.83–0.85 V, consistent with the similar LUMO energy levels of the SMAs.49,52 Thus, the differences in the PCEs of the three OSC devices are mainly associated with the Jsc and FF values. The YSe–C3 and YSe–C9-based devices had a Jsc of ∼23 mA cm−2, whereas the YSe–C6 OSC achieved a much higher Jsc of 25.94 mA cm−2. EQE measurements confirmed the Jsc trends for the three devices, where Jsc,cal for each device was well-matched with the measured Jsc within 3% error (Fig. 2c). The PM6:YSe–C6 device showed superior EQE values in the wavelength range of 300 to 1000 nm with the highest maximum EQE value of ∼85% at 560 nm. In addition, the FF of the PM6:YSe–C6 OSC (0.73) was significantly higher than that of YSe–C3 (0.60).

The impact of the inner side-chain on the photovoltaic performance was also investigated by comparing three different YSe–C9 SMAs with different inner side-chains (2-butyloctyl, 2-hexyldecyl, and 2-octyldodecyl), where the outer side-chain structure was fixed as n-nonyl (C9) (Fig. S8†). As summarized in Table S2,† the length of the inner side-chain had much less influence on the PCE of the o-xylene-processed OSC devices compared to that of the outer side-chain. For example, when the 2-hexyldecyl inner side-chain was introduced, the resulting SMA (i.e., YSe–C9) yielded a PCE of 14.20%, which was only slightly higher than those of the 2-butyloctyl (13.67%) and 2-octyldodecyl (13.55%) counterparts. Thus, for the o-xylene-processed OSC systems, it was observed that modulating the outer side-chain structure of the Y–Se SMAs was more effective for optimizing the photovoltaic performance than varying their inner side-chain structures. In addition, two other non-halogenated solvents of toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were employed to investigate the photovoltaic performances of different Y–Se SMAs. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table S3.† For both processing solvents of toluene and THF, the YSe–C6-based OSCs exhibited the highest PCE compared to the other YSe-Cx-based OSCs, which is consistent with the results from o-xylene processing.
To better understand the effects of the outer side-chain structure on the photovoltaic performance of the three different OSC devices, the charge recombination properties and exciton dissociation probabilities (P(E,T)s) of the PM6:YSe–Cx OSCs were examined.53 Firstly, the charge recombination characteristics of the PM6:YSe–Cx OSCs were investigated by measuring the light intensity (Plight)-dependent Jsc and Voc within the Plight range of 0.1–1 sun (Fig. 3).54,55 In general, the relationship between Jsc and Plight can be estimated based on a power law (Jsc ∝ Plightα), and α decreases when bimolecular recombination occurs more frequently. The PM6:YSe–C6 device showed a higher α value of 0.95 compared to the other two devices (α = 0.80 for the YSe–C3-based device and 0.86 for the YSe–C9-based device), indicating that bimolecular charge recombination was significantly suppressed in the PM6:YSe–C6 device (Fig. 3a). The relationship between Voc and Plight was also investigated for the PM6:YSe–Cx OSCs (Fig. 3b). The plot of Voc as a function of ln(Plight) gives a slope (S) representing the degree of monomolecular or trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, in the units of kBTq−1 (where q is the elementary charge, T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant). In this experiment, the S value of the YSe–C6-based device (S = 1.08 kBTq−1) was much closer to unity than those of the other devices (S = 1.38kBTq−1 for the YSe–C3-based device and 1.24kBTq−1 for the YSe–C9-based device). These results show that both the monomolecular and bimolecular charge recombination are most effectively suppressed in the YSe–C6-based device.56,57 The exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) of each OSC was also compared by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. S9†).53 The YSe–C6-based device had a significantly higher P(E,T) of 91.5% compared to that of the YSe–C9-based (85.2%) device, indicating that charge generation at the donor–acceptor interface occurs most efficiently within the YSe–C6-based OSCs.58 Meanwhile, the unsaturated Jph of PM6:YSe–C3 at sufficiently high Veff suggests that the free charge carriers could not be fully collected at the electrodes,59 consistent with the poor charge recombination properties of the YSe–C3 devices observed in the aforementioned analyses.

To gain insight into the effects of the outer-chain structure of the YSe–Cx SMAs on the electrical and photovoltaic properties of the OSCs, the structural properties of the PM6:YSe–Cx blend films were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 4 and S10†).60,61 To quantitatively compare the crystalline properties obtained from the scattering peaks, the Scherrer equation was used to estimate the coherence lengths of the crystallites (Lcs).61 For all of the PM6:YSe–Cx blend films, the (100) peaks were observed at q = 0.29 Å−1 along the in-plane (IP) direction and of the (010) peaks at q = 1.69 Å−1 along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which indicate the formation of dominant face-on oriented crystallites in the films.62 Interestingly, only the profile of the PM6:YSe–C3 blend film showed a distinct peak at qz = 0.58 Å−1 along the OOP direction, with an Lc of 147.1 Å. This can be understood as a higher order (200) peak along the OOP direction. In addition, considering the significant intensity of the peak at qz = 0.58 Å−1, this peak might be also associated with a higher order peak (or longer distance) of π–π stacking, which is produced when Y–Se SMAs become highly aggregated.63,64 In either case, the peak at qz = 0.58 Å−1 suggests the presence of highly aggregated structures in the PM6:YSe–C3 blend film, which might be the main reason for the relatively poor photovoltaic performance and severe recombination in the corresponding OSC devices. In contrast, this peak was not observed for the PM6:YSe–C6 and PM6:YSe–C9 blend films. From the comparison of the (010) π–π stacking peak along the OOP direction for the PM6:YSe–C6 and PM6:YSe–C9 blend films, the Lc of the PM6:YSe–C6 blend was found to be 16.4 Å, which was slightly larger than that (15.5 Å) of the PM6:YSe–C9 film. However, the difference was not significant and thus could not explain the discrepancy in the PCEs (i.e., 16.11 and 14.20%). Thus, other morphological analyses were performed to better understand the PCE differences.

The blend film morphologies were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with measurements of height images (Fig. S11†). Among the three blend films, PM6:YSe–C6 had a well-intermixed morphology, with the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.36 nm. The RMS roughness of the PM6:YSe–C3 blend film (2.72 nm) was approximately twice that of the PM6:YSe–C6 blend because of the aggregated SMA phases. The PM6:YSe–C9 blend film also had a relatively inhomogeneous structure with a higher RMS roughness value of 2.13 nm compared to that of the YSe–C6-based blend film. Since the crystalline structures of the PM6:YSe–C6 and PM6:YSe–C9 blend films were similar as shown in the GIWAXS results (Fig. 4 and S10†), we investigated the molecular interactions between PM6 and SMA in the three blends. The surface energy (γ) of each material was measured and the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) of each blend system was estimated (Fig. S12 and Table S4†). Water and glycerol were used to measure the contact angles on each film, and the Wu model was used to calculate the γ value.65 The γ value for the PM6 film was measured to be 20.96 mN m−1, while those of YSe–C3, YSe–C6, and YSe–C9 films were estimated to be 27.42, 23.79, and 26.72 mN m−1, respectively. The average values were determined from at least three different measurements for each film. Accordingly, the PM6:YSe–C6 pair showed the lowest χ value of 0.25, whereas the PM6:YSe–C3 and PM6:YSe–C9 pairs showed higher χ values of 1.56 and 0.76, respectively. Since a lower χ value indicates a less enthalpic penalty of the mixing of two different molecules, the results suggest better miscibility of YSe–C6 with PM6 compared to those of the other two SMAs with PM6.66,67 Thus, this result is consistent with the relatively homogeneous morphology of the PM6:YSe–C6 blend with the lowest RMS value. In addition, it is speculated that the solubility difference between the SMAs could play an important role in determining the blend morphology. The solubilities of PM6 and YSe–C6 in o-xylene were very similar (∼60 mg mL−1) (Fig. S7†). In contrast, the solubilities of YSe–C3 (or YSe–C9) and PM6 were significantly different, where YSe–C3 was significantly less soluble (32 mg mL−1) than PM6, while YSe–C9 was more soluble (72 mg mL−1) than PM6. Due to the unmatched solubilities of the PM6 donor and YSe–C3 or YSe–C9 SMA acceptor, one of the components having lower solubility may solidify earlier during the spin-coating process, which can accelerate phase separation and increase the domain purity and size.68,69 Different blend morphologies with varied domain sizes and purities affect the exciton dissociation efficiency, charge transport, and recombination properties.70,71
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements can support the difference in the morphologies of the PM6:YSe–Cx blends (Fig. 5 and Table S5†). The samples for DSC were prepared by applying the same conditions used to fabricate the optimal active layers in order to investigate the relationship between the photovoltaic performance and the morphological properties. For example, blend films were prepared on glass substrates under the same processing conditions used for device fabrication and then collected in DSC pans. Subsequently, DSC thermograms during the 1st heating cycle were monitored to directly interpret the morphological characteristics of the blend films.72Fig. 5a presents a comparison of the 1st heating cycles of the pristine YSe–Cx SMA films. The melting temperatures (Tms) gradually decreased from 282.1 °C (YSe–C3) to 275.2 °C (YSe–C6), and to 259.4 °C (YSe–C9) (Table S5†). The melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of the SMAs also decreased from 1.83 J g−1 (YSe–C3) to 1.51 J g−1 (YSe–C6), and to 0.94 J g−1 (YSe–C9), indicating reduced intermolecular interactions between the YSe–Cx SMA backbones. No melting peak was observed for the PM6 pristine film (Fig. S13†), consistent with the observations from previous literature.73,74Fig. 5b presents a comparison of the 1st heating cycle of the PM6:YSe–Cx blend films. An interesting observation is that the melting peaks of YSe–C3 and YSe–C9 SMAs were distinct in the corresponding blend films. In contrast, the melting transition peak of the YSe–C6 SMA almost disappeared for the PM6:YSe–C6 blend. These results suggest independent formation of SMA crystallites within the PM6:YSe–C3 and PM6:YSe–C9 blends, which indicates higher domain purity and possibly stronger phase separation between the PM6 and SMA domains. In contrast, the formation of separate YSe–C6 crystallites was suppressed in the PM6:YSe–C6 blend, supporting the well-intermixed blend morphology with reduced domain purity. This morphological feature can explain the more efficient charge generation in the PM6:YSe–C6 blend.70,71

OSC devices with different active layer thicknesses were fabricated to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the o-xylene-processable Y-series SMAs. It is particularly important to maintain optimal PCEs at high active-layer thicknesses (>300 nm). These thick active layers are suitable for roll-to-roll fabrication, as they tend to form uniform films during high-speed, large-area processing.75,76 PM6:YSe–Cx OSCs with active layer thicknesses in the range of 100–400 nm were prepared, and their photovoltaic and electrical properties were compared (Fig. 6 and Table S6†). Compared to the other two devices, owing to the more homogeneously optimized blend morphology, the PCE of the PM6:YSe–C6 device was significantly less affected by the active layer thickness. For instance, the PCE of the YSe–C6-based device with an ∼400 nm active layer was maintained at more than 90% of that achieved with an ∼100 nm-thick layer. In contrast, the PCE of the YSe–C3-based film with an active layer thickness of ∼400 nm was only 44% of the optimal PCE obtained with an ∼100 nm-thick film. The charge carrier mobility was also measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, which can support the changes in the Jsc and PCE with increasing film thickness (Table S7†).77 The hole/electron mobility ratio (μh/μe) was found to be strongly correlated with the tolerance of the PCE to the active layer thickness in the PM6:YSe–C6 devices.66,78,79 PM6:YSe–C6 showed well-balanced charge mobilities regardless of the active layer thickness. However, for the PM6:YSe–C3 device, as the active layer thickness increased, μh/μe increased rapidly, which led to a significant decrease in the Jsc and PCE.

Conclusions
In this study, we developed a series of selenophene-containing YSe–Cx SMAs with different outer side-chain lengths of C3, C6, and C9 and investigated the molecular structure–device function relationship in green-solvent-processed OSCs using o-xylene solvent. It is observed that the outer side-chain structures of YSe–Cx SMAs exert a significant impact on the solubilities, aggregated structures of the SMAs, and their optical and electrical properties in the OSCs. As a result, o-xylene-processed PM6:YSe–C6 achieved the highest PCE of 16.11% with superior Jsc and FF values, significantly outperforming the YSe–C3 and YSe–C9-based OSCs. The enhanced miscibility and comparable solubility of PM6 and YSe–C6 contributed to the well-intermixed blend morphology of the corresponding active layer, significantly improving the charge transport and recombination properties as well as the exciton dissociation probability. Also, it was found that the impact of the outer side-chain structure of the YSe–Cx SMAs on the PCE of the o-xylene-processed OSCs was much more significant compared to that of the inner side-chain. Importantly, the PM6:YSe–C6 devices exhibited excellent active layer-thickness tolerant PCEs with up to 400 nm film thickness, demonstrating the potential utility of these materials in roll-to-roll printing, suitable for large-area OSC fabrication. Therefore, by the design of YSe–Cx SMAs with appropriately constructed side-chains, we report green solvent-processed OSC devices with PCEs of over 16%.
