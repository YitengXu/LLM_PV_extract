    , Accepted 29th November 2013First published on 29th November 2013AbstractWe report the formation and characterization of hybrid pn-junction solar cells based on a layer of copper diffused silver indium disulfide (AgInS2@Cu) nanoparticles and another layer of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules. With copper diffusion in the nanocrystals, their optical absorption and hence the activity of the hybrid pn-junction solar cells was extended towards the near-IR region. To decrease the particle-to-particle separation for improved carrier transport through the inorganic layer, we replaced the long-chain ligands of copper-diffused nanocrystals in each monolayer with short-ones. Under illumination, the hybrid pn-junctions yielded a higher short-circuit current as compared to the combined contribution of the Schottky junctions based on the components. A wider depletion region at the interface between the two active layers in the pn-junction device as compared to that of the Schottky junctions has been considered to analyze the results. Capacitance–voltage characteristics under a dark condition supported such a hypothesis. We also determined the width of the depletion region in the two layers separately so that a pn-junction could be formed with a tailored thickness of the two materials. Such a “fully-depleted” device resulted in an improved photovoltaic performance, primarily due to lessening of the internal resistance of the hybrid pn-junction solar cells.
Introduction
Research on organic photovoltaic devices has undergone a quantum jump with the inclusion of nanocrystals in device-structures.1–8 Improved carrier-mobility and a tunable bandgap in combination with their solution processability makes them ideal as active materials for a range of opto-electronic devices.8–14 Apart from reducing the manufacturing cost, thin-film solar cells based on inorganic quantum dots have been undergoing steep progress in terms of power conversion efficiency and other parameters of device performance.15,16
The leading nanocrystalline materials for different opto-electronic devices are generally based on II–VI or IV–VI semiconductors.8,11–13 Recently, some doped and multinary quantum dots are making inroads both as emitting or absorbing materials. For example, nanocrystals of a quaternary kesterite semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) have shown promise in thin-film solar cells due to their direct band gap (1.5 eV) and large absorption coefficient (104 cm−1).17–19 Nanoparticles of binary and other ternary chalcopyrite direct band gap semiconductors (I–III–VI2), such as silver-indium-disulfide (AgInS2) and copper-indium-disulfide (CuInS2), are being considered for their intense absorption in the visible to near-IR range.2,4,20–22 More importantly, they do not contain toxic elements, such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc. that are being commonly used in many semiconducting quantum dots, so that non-toxic nanophotovoltaics could be achieved.21,22 Since the conduction and valence band-edges of such nanoparticles lie below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), respectively, of common conjugated polymers, the nanocrystals can be used in a polymer matrix to form (hybrid) bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices. Such materials are being used as heavy metal-free sensitizers for “green” quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).23–25 Since AgInS2 nanoparticles are associated with some vacancies at different constituent atom-sites leading to the formation of defect states followed by a sharp decrease in the crystalline nature and carrier mobility,26 the diffusion of suitable elements, such as zinc, tin, etc. have been considered.27 Moreover, the diffusion of suitable elements may tune the band gap of the nanocrystals to tune the spectral window of opto-electronic devices.
The other device structure that we recently introduced is a junction between a layer of inorganic semiconducting quantum dots and a layer of suitable organic semiconductor. Such heterojunctions that can be termed as a “hybrid pn-junction” acted as photovoltaic devices.7,18,28,29 In most of the cases, a layer of a fullerene derivative has been used to fabricate hybrid bilayer structures. Under an illuminated condition, two energy offsets at the junction, namely (1) between the conduction band-edge of the quantum dot and the LUMO of the organic molecule and (2) between the valence band-edge of the inorganic and the HOMO of the organic semiconductor are responsible for exciton dissociation that in turn yielded photocurrent in the external circuit. It is hence important to study the junction and the width of the depletion region where excitons are dissociated. It is also important to determine the width of the region in the two materials separately so that a fully-depleted device can be fabricated accordingly, with a predetermined thickness that would be effective in exciton dissociation and would offer a minimal internal resistance.
Experimental
Synthesis of AgInS2 nanoparticles
AgInS2 nanoparticles were grown following reported procedures with some modifications.27,30 Silver(I) acetate (CH3COOAg) and indium(III) acetate (In(CH3COO)3) were used as silver and indium precursors, respectively. A stock solution of indium was prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of indium acetate in 3.2 mL oleic acid and 6.8 mL of 1-octadecene (ODE). 0.1 mmol of silver acetate was dissolved in 5 mL of ODE and 1 mL of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) in a three-neck flask. After a thorough degassing, 1 mL of indium stock solution (0.1 mmol) was injected into the mixture. While continuing the degassing process, the temperature of the mixed solution was raised to 160 °C. At this stage, 2.5 mL of sulfur stock solution, prepared by dissolving 0.3 mmol of sulfur (in excess to that required for the reaction) in 2 mL of ODE and 0.5 mL of oleylamine, was injected to the reaction flask which initiated the reaction process. The temperature of the flask was further raised to 180 °C and the reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min to complete the growth of the nanocrystals. The reaction process was stopped by cooling the flask down to room temperature. The AgInS2 nanocrystals were extracted by repeated precipitation in toluene–ethanol followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm. The final precipitant was dissolved in toluene for further use.
Copper diffusion in AgInS2 nanocrystals (AgInS2@Cu)
To diffuse copper into the AgInS2 nanocrystals,31 a copper stock solution, formed by dissolving 2 mmol of copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2, 2H2O) in 10 mL of oleylamine at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, was used. For copper diffusion into the AgInS2 nanocrystals, a measured amount of the copper stock solution was injected drop-wise to the reaction mixture that had already been used to grow the nanoparticles for 5 min. The temperature of the reaction flask was raised from 160 to 180 °C and the reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 20 min. The concentration of diffused copper was varied by changing the amount of copper stock solution (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mL) injected into the reaction flask. The copper-diffused nanocrystals will henceforth be denoted as AgInS2@Cu(x.xx), where x.xx was the amount of copper stock solution that was injected in the reaction flask. The AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals were separated following the procedure used for AgInS2.
Characterization of the nanocrystals
The AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals were characterized using UV-visible-NIR absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The measurements were carried out with a Varian 5000 UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer, a Jeol Model JEM-2100F TEM, an Omicron XPS (serial number 0571), and a Bruker D8 Advanced X-ray Powder Diffractometer, respectively.
Fabrication of hybrid pn-junction devices
The photovoltaic devices having a sandwiched configuration were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. The ITO electrodes, which were in the form of strips of 2 mm width, had a surface resistance of 15 Ω sq−1. Thin-films of the nanoparticles were formed on ITO electrodes through a multi-step process involving removal of long-chain surface-ligands of the nanoparticles.16,32 Since removal of surfactants from the nanoparticles makes them insoluble, the ligands were replaced with a short-one after formation of an ultrathin layer of the nanoparticles (spinning speed = 2500 rpm). To replace long-chain oleylamine surfactants of the nanocrystals in the ultrathin layer, a solution of pyridine in acetonitrile (30% v/v) was spun followed by washing (through spinning) with anhydrous acetonitrile to remove the excess pyridine. The processes of (1) formation of an ultrathin layer of the nanocrystal and (2) surfactant-removal through spinning of pyridine and acetonitrile in sequence were repeated for a desired number of cycles to form a thin-film of AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals on ITO electrodes. We varied the number of deposition cycles to obtain a desired thickness of the nanocrystals. The thickness of the films was 65 nm as measured by recording the depth profile of an intentional scratch on the films through atomic force microscopy images (NanoSurf EasyScan2).
A 60 nm thin-film of copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was thermally evaporated on the nanocrystal layer under a vacuum of ∼10−6 Torr. On top of the CuPc layer, gold strips orthogonal to the ITO electrode were thermally evaporated under the same vacuum at a rate of 0.04 nm s−1. The active area of the devices, as defined by the overlap of ITO and Au electrodes, was 4 mm2. Since the nanocrystals and CuPc were n- and p-type in nature, respectively, the nanoparticle–CuPc bilayer structure formed a pn-junction (truly speaking, an np-junction). With the inverted structure, ITO and gold acted as the electron- and the hole-collecting electrode, respectively.
Device characterization
The devices were characterized for solar cell applications by placing them inside a shielded metal-chamber with a quartz window. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices under conditions of both darkness and illumination were recorded with a Yokogawa 7651 dc voltage source and a Keithley 6517A Electrometer which recorded the device current. A Newport-Stratfort 150 W Solar Simulator was used as the source for white light illumination. To obtain near-IR illumination, an optical-cast IR long-pass filter (Edmund Optics) having a transmission above 650 nm was used. Jobin-Yvon H20 and H20 FIR monochromators were used to record the external quantum efficiency spectrum in the 300–600 nm and 600–1000 nm regions, respectively. For every device structure, at least six cells were characterized to check the reproducibility of the results.
Capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics were carried out with a Solartron 1260A Impedance Analyzer in the −1.0 to +1.0 V dc voltage region with 100 mV rms as the test ac-voltage. The set of frequencies of the test voltage were 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 100 kHz. The C–V characteristics were recorded with a SMaRT software.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the nanocrystals
We have characterized the AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals with different contents of copper diffusion by recording their TEM, HR-TEM, and STEM images. Such images for AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu(0.10) are shown in Fig. 1a. From the images, we find that the size and shape of both AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu(0.10) nanocrystals remained same. Their average diameter turned out to be 7.2 nm. Since the particles were grown under the same reaction conditions, the invariance of the diameter implied that copper either diffused to the vacant sites or replaced some of the silver and indium atoms of the host nanocrystals instead of forming a shell layer.

The corresponding images of copper-diffused (copper content = 0.10) AgInS2 nanocrystals are shown in parts (iv), (v), and (vi), respectively, of the figure. (b) XRD spectra of AgInS2 (lower panel) and the AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals (upper panel). Diffraction peaks of AgInS2 as obtained from JCPDS file #25-1328 are shown as sticks in the AgInS2 XRD spectrum. 
The crystal structure of the nanocrystals was analyzed by recording their XRD spectrum. Fig. 1b shows XRD patterns of AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu(0.10) nanocrystals. All diffraction peaks in the XRD spectra match the patterns of the orthorhombic phase of pure AgInS2 (JCPDS file #25-1328). We did not observe diffraction peaks corresponding to other possible products, such as In2S3, Ag2S, Cu2S, or other oxides, demonstrating the purity of the AgInS2 and AgInS2@Cu products. Compared to the bulk materials, the nanocrystals returned broader peaks in the XRD spectra presumably due to a smaller size of the crystals and also a distribution in the diameter.
Valence state information and elemental composition of the nanocrystals were studied by XPS analysis (Fig. 2). A full scan spectrum of the AgInS2@Cu(0.10) nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 2a. Here, the binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis have been corrected by referencing the C1s peak to 284.5 eV. The spectrum shows the presence of Ag3d, In3d, S2p, and Cu2p peaks, confirming occurrence of the elements in the nanomaterial. The binding energies of Ag3d, In3d, and S2p match the reported results of AgInS2 nanocrystals.33

We have also recorded high-resolution spectrum in small energy regions around each of the peaks. It can be observed in Fig. 2b that the spectrum for Ag3d is resolved into 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks at 367.8 and 373.8 eV, respectively. These energy positions are in concurrence with the reference XPS spectrum of Ag(I).34 Similarly, the high-resolution spectrum for In3d, as presented in Fig. 2c, is well-resolved into two peaks corresponding to In3d5/2 and In3d3/2 at 444.6 and 452.2 eV, respectively; they also match well with the reported spectrum of In(III).35Fig. 2d shows that the spectrum corresponding to S2p is asymmetric in nature presumably due to recombination of two peaks.35 A shoulder and a peak, corresponding to S2p1/2 and S2p3/2, respectively, appeared at 161.5 and 162.5 eV. The energy positions of S2p also represent the S2− state. From the results, it is hence clear that sulfur coordinated to silver and indium to form AgInS2. The high-resolution spectrum of Cu2p returned one clear peak at 932 eV. The binding energies corresponding to Cu+ and Cu2+ were at 932.5 and 933.8 eV, respectively.36 Our results hence imply that copper atoms that diffused to AgInS2 nanocrystals were in a Cu(I) state and preferred to replace the Ag(I) atoms during the diffusion process to form AgInS2@Cu nanocrystals.
To study the elemental composition, we looked back to the full spectrum and analyzed the total area under the peaks corresponding to Ag3d, In3d and S2p and Cu2p using CASA XPS software. For AgInS2@Cu(0.10) nanocrystals, we have obtained a ratio Ag:Cu:In:S = 1.00:0.17:1.24:1.06. This implied that the effective content of diffused copper was 7.6% with respect to the total cationic elements, matching reasonably well with the precursor-contents that were used during growth of the nanocrystals. With this in mind, we will continue to use the amount of copper stock solution in denoting the content of diffused copper in the AgInS2 nanocrystals.
Optical absorption of the nanocrystals
We have recorded optical absorption spectra of as-grown nanocrystals dispersed in toluene (Fig. 3a). The spectrum of AgInS2 nanocrystals matches the reported results. Upon diffusion of copper into the nanocrystals, the spectrum was extended towards the low energy region. In other words, with copper diffusion the onset of the absorption shifts towards the red implying a decrease in the band gap. The PL emission of AgInS2 in the 650–850 nm region that appears from the defect states is quenched upon copper diffusion since copper diffuses into the vacant sites of the AgInS2 nanocrystals (Fig. 3b). This PL quenching justifies the use of copper diffusion into the nanocrystals for use in photovoltaic devices. The change in the onset of optical absorption may appear due to an interaction between the 3d-state of copper and the valance band-edge of the host material. A similar decrease in the band gap has been reported in other systems, such as, copper-doped ZnIn2S4 and ZnO nanoparticles.37,38 The Raman spectrum of the nanocrystals also matched the reported results.

Formation of inorganic–organic hybrid junctions
We have recorded the I–V characteristics of the photovoltaic devices, which had a sandwiched configuration with ITO and gold as the electrodes. By applying a voltage to the ITO electrode with respect to the gold, they acted as electron- and hole-collecting electrodes, respectively, representing an inverted photovoltaic structure. The active materials of such a structure have been a junction between a layer of AgInS2@Cu nanoparticles and a layer of CuPc in sequence that can be termed as a “hybrid pn-junction”. With the copper diffusion in the nanocrystals, we aimed to extend the active spectral range of the photovoltaic devices. The total thickness of the active layer was 125 nm. The concentration of diffused copper in the nanocrystals was varied. In addition, devices based on a layer of the individual components (Schottky junctions) were also formed and characterized. For each type of device-structures, at least five cells were characterized to ensure reproducibility of the results.
In Fig. 4a, we have shown a schematic diagram of the heterojunction device structure. Energy levels of the active materials and the electrodes, as presented in Fig. 4b, show that the materials form a staggered gap (type-II) band-offset, so that excitons formed in both the materials would have the possibility to become dissociated. The energy diagram of the device under an equilibrium condition is complex, with conduction and valence band-edges of the nanocrystal and LUMO and HOMO of the organic semiconductor. Such a diagram of the hybrid pn-junction with energy-bands and molecular orbitals is presented in Fig. 4c. Considering the barriers with the electrodes under a forward and a reverse bias, I–V characteristics of the device under dark conditions would be rectifying in nature. In Fig. 5a, we present (rectifying) characteristics from a typical heterojunction device based on layers of copper-diffused AgInS2 nanoparticles and CuPc in sequence. The content of copper in the nanocrystals used in forming the heterojunction device was 10%. The AgInS2@Cu(0.10) layer forms an ohmic contact with the ITO electrode and a Schottky contact with the gold. The CuPc layer, on the other hand, forms an ohmic contact with the gold electrode and a Schottky contact with the ITO. Hence, in an ITO/AgInS2@Cu/CuPc/Au device structure, ohmic contacts would be formed with both the electrodes. The junction between the layers of inorganic semiconducting nanocrystals and organic semiconductors can be resembled to a (hybrid) pn-junction diode with formation of a depletion region at the interface (Fig. 4c). The rectification ratio in these hybrid diodes under dark conditions was 15 when measured at 1.0 V. The ratio depended on the content of copper in the nanocrystals; this is due to fact that the copper-content has a role on the carrier concentration that in turn would influence rectification through the hybrid junction.

Hybrid pn-junctions as photovoltaic devices
The rectifying nature of the I–V characteristics under darkness, as presented in Fig. 5a, provided an indication that the devices might act as solar cells under illumination. The I–V characteristics of the ITO/copper-diffused AgInS2/CuPc/Au device under 100 mW cm−2 white light illumination are shown in the same figure. While the sandwiched structures based on only the components yielded low open-circuit voltages (VOC) and short-circuit currents (ISC), the junction demonstrated a reasonable photovoltaic effect (Table 1). In fact, the sum of the ISC’s of ITO/AgInS2@Cu/Au and ITO/CuPc/Au devices was smaller than that of the hybrid pn-junction device. The higher ISC in the ITO/AgInS2@Cu/CuPc/Au heterostructure device was therefore not only due to an increased photoabsorption in two materials (instead of one) but also due to a possible widening of the region where excitons could be dissociated. It is important to note that the heterostructure returned a higher ISC in spite of the higher internal resistance that the AgInS2@Cu and CuPc layers imposed on the carriers. Unfortunately “leakage” of carriers across the junction occurred to some extent, resulting in carrier recombination in the neutral regions and correspondingly a decrease in VOC.

Hybrid heterostructures: role of copper diffusion in the nanocrystals
We have studied the effect of copper-diffusion into the nanocrystals on the photovoltaic performance of the hybrid heterojunction devices. Under dark conditions, the devices returned rectifying I–V characteristics with a rectification ratio ranging between 9 and 15. Results from different bilayer structures under a white light illumination are shown in Fig. 5b. While the open-circuit voltage (VOC) did not show a specific trend, the ISC depended on the content of copper in the AgInS2 nanocrystals (Table 1). With the content of copper diffusion in the nanocrystals, ISC went through a maximum. It reached a value of 3.95 mA cm−2 for 10% copper diffusion with a power conversion efficiency of 0.62%.
Since the diffusion of copper into the nanoparticles extends their optical absorption towards the near-IR range, we explored if the solar cell activity of the devices based on such nanocrystals also extends towards the longer wavelength region. To do so, we characterized the devices under irradiation above 650 nm. The corresponding I–V characteristics are presented in Fig. 6a. The devices acted as solar cells under the near-IR illumination. When the ISC’s were compared, the device based on AgInS2 nanocrystals (no copper diffusion) performed worst. To show the extent of the spectral range in which the devices responded, we plotted external quantum efficiency (EQE%) spectra of the devices under white light illumination (Fig. 6b). In addition, the optical absorption spectrum of the heterojunction has been shown in the figure for comparison with the EQE spectrum (Fig. 6c). While CuPc absorbed in the 500–800 nm region, the nanocrystals' absorption spectrum was a continuum. The spectrum of the AgInS2@Cu–CuPc heterojunction was a sum of the two spectra. The EQE spectra of the devices matched the absorption spectrum of the heterojunction implying that both the components absorbed to yield photocurrent. In the EQE spectra, the bands in the 500–800 nm region represent absorption of CuPc. The nanocrystals' contribution in the EQE spectra can be visible both in low wavelength continuum (from UV to 500 nm) and in the longer wavelength region (above 800 nm). In the heterojunction, while the overall response of the device based on AgInS2@Cu(0.10) was the highest, the extension of the EQE spectrum towards the long-wavelength region was increasingly more with an increase in the copper content of the nanocrystals. In other words, the longer wavelength part of each of the EQE spectra appeared due to absorption in the copper diffused AgInS2 nanocrystals.

(c) Optical absorption spectra of thin-films of CuPc, AgInS2@Cu(0.10), and the AgInS2@Cu(0.10)–CuPc heterojunction are shown for comparison. 
Capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of hybrid pn-junctions
The improvement in device performance with the formation of a heterostructure (as compared to devices based on the components) was presumably due to a wider depletion region at the interface between the two active materials. Since excitons would be dissociated only at the depletion region, it would be important to determine the width of the region, or more precisely the extent of the depletion region in the two materials. In other words, we first aimed to determine the thickness of the depletion region of the quantum dots and of the organic semiconductor layer separately. The rationale behind such a measurement was to finally fabricate a device having such layer thicknesses, so that the tailored pn-junction heterostructure becomes fully depleted. This would allow us to leave behind the additional materials near the electrodes that would otherwise have increased the internal resistance of the device without contributing to any of its photovoltaic activities.

C–V characteristics are an important method to study the parameters of the active layer of a sandwiched structure. C–V characteristics of the two Schottky devices and the hybrid pn-junction heterostructure under dark conditions are shown in Fig. 7. Since we have fabricated our devices in an inverted fashion, a negative voltage meant a forward-biased device. From the characteristics presented in Fig. 7, we find that the capacitance of the devices increased from a reverse-bias to an increasing forward-bias direction. The decreasing nature of the capacitance in the reverse-bias region indicated that the active layer of the devices was not fully depleted. The results are in agreement with the observation that the magnitude of the current under a reverse-bias also increased with an increasing reverse-bias voltage.

From the C–V characteristics of the two Schottky junctions based on AgInS2@Cu(0.10) nanoparticles and CuPc layers, we have calculated the width of the depletion region in these devices. Depletion width (W) of different devices at 0 V can be calculated from: (1)where C and A are junction capacitance and area of the device, respectively, ε0 the free space permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer. With εr of CuPc being 3.5,39 the width of the depletion region of the ITO/CuPc/Au device, WCuPc, was 21.1 nm. Since the AgInS2@Cu nanoparticles were capped with pyridine, we considered the relative dielectric constants of both the bulk AgInS2@Cu material and the medium (pyridine) in order to calculate εr of the capped nanoparticles. We have obtained a value of εr = 11.2 on the basis of Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory. Correspondingly, the width of the depletion region of the ITO/AgInS2@Cu/Au device, WNP, turned out to be 39.7 nm.
For the ITO/AgInS2@Cu/CuPc/Au heterojunction device, we first calculated εr of the heterojunction (εr = 6.4), that resulted in Wjunction to be 54 nm, which is higher than the depletion widths of the two devices based on the components. The wider depletion region in fact results in a higher short-circuit current in the device based on AgInS2@Cu–CuPc heterojunctions as compared to that of the devices based on the components. The values of the width of the depletion region in different devices, along with their photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 2.

We were interested to calculate the extent of the depletion region in each side of the heterojunction, i.e., the width of the depletion region at the n-side (Xn) and at the p-side (Xp). To do so, we first calculated the activated carrier density (N) of the depletion region of two Schottky devices as per the following equation: (2)where q is the electronic charge and Vbi is the built-in potential of the device. At zero applied voltage, Vbi is approximately equal to the open-circuit voltage of the corresponding device. Using eqn (2), we have calculated carrier density NNP of the ITO/AgInS2@Cu/Au device and NCuPc of the ITO/CuPc/Au device. We have obtained NNP = 1.57 × 1023 m−3 and NCuPc = 2.43 × 1023 m−3. For the AgInS2@Cu–CuPc heterojunction device, the activated carrier density can be calculated from: (3)that turned out to be 0.95 × 1023 m−3 implying that the pn-junction device was more depleted as compared to the devices based on the components. To calculate the width Xn in the nanoparticle layer and Xp in the CuPc layer of the depletion region on each side of the heterojunction we considered the following equations:40 (4) (5)where εn and εp represent the relative dielectric constant of the n- and p-type materials, respectively. We have obtained Xn = 29.3 nm and Xp = 18.9 nm with a total depletion width of 48.2 nm. The total width of the depletion region as obtained from these equations matches well with that obtained from the capacitance value.
Fully depleted AgInS2@Cu(0.10)–CuPc pn-junction
The results stated above reconfirm that the 125 nm thick pn-junction device was not fully depleted. The thickness of the active layer was more than double the width of the depletion region. With the information of the depletion region widths on the two sides of the pn-junction, we aimed to fabricate a device with AgInS2@Cu and CuPc layers having thicknesses matching the widths of the depletion regions. With 30 nm of AgInS2@Cu and 20 nm of CuPc layer, the total thickness of such a device was 50 nm. The I–V characteristics of the tailor-made heterojunction device, which could be termed as a “fully-depleted” device, under an illuminated conditions, are show in Fig. 8a. For comparison, we have included results from the 125 nm thick pn-junction device. The results show that although the “fully-depleted” thinner device absorbed less photons than the thicker heterojunction, the former device resulted in a higher short-circuit current. The near-IR activity of the “fully-depleted” device was also higher as compared to the thicker heterojunction device (Fig. 8b). The parameters of the “fully-depleted” device are listed in Table 2.

The analgous characteristics for a thicker device are also shown for comparison. Both the characteristics were under a conditions of white light illumination. (b) I–V characteristics of the two devices under illumination above 650 nm. Results from three cells for each device structure are presented as different symbols in both the figures. (c) C–V and Mott–Schottky plots of the thinner device that was fully depleted under dark conditions. 
To recheck if the 50 nm thinner device was truly fully-depleted, we recorded the C–V characteristics of the devices. In Fig. 8c, the C–V and Mott–Schottky plots of the thinner device are shown. From these characteristics, we find that the capacitance of this “fully-depleted” device under a reverse-bias (that is, positive voltage region) was almost constant with a value matching the geometrical capacitance of the sandwiched structure. The Mott–Schottky plot also supports the analysis. With a reduction in the device thickness, it's photovoltaic performance is hence improved due to a decrease in the device resistance; there was no additional layer through which carriers had to migrate to the electrodes. In other words, the whole of the device was depleted and was active in dissociating excitons.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have fabricated and characterized photovoltaic devices based on a hybrid heterojunction between a layer of copper-diffused AgInS2 nanocrystals and a layer of CuPc in sequence. While the film of the nanocrystals was formed via a layer-by-layer technique by replacing long-chain oleylamine ligands with pyridine (as short-chain ligands) to reduce the interparticle spacing, the organic layer was deposited by a thermal evaporation method. We varied the content of copper diffused in the nanocrystals that in turn extended their optical absorption towards the longer wavelength region. From the comparison of the I–V characteristics of the AgInS2@Cu–CuPc pn-junction solar cells and the Schottky junction devices based on the components of the heterostructure, we inferred that a wider depletion region formed in the heterojunction devices. Capacitance–voltage characteristics confirmed this reasoning. We calculated the width of the depletion regions that extended to the two layers separately so as to form an AgInS2@Cu–CuPc pn-junction solar cell with a tailored thickness. Such a device, being fully depleted, dissociated excitons, which were photogenerated throughout the device, and yielded a higher ISC and external quantum efficiency. In this work, we provided a route to shed extra material from both sides of a hybrid pn-junction, reducing the internal resistance of a device resulting in improved photovoltaic performances.
