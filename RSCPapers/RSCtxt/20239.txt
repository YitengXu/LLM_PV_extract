    , Accepted 27th February 2012First published on 28th February 2012AbstractA thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC) on board a long-haul truck would convert waste heat from the engine or exhaust into electrical energy. We propose a TRFC in which waste-heat drives the endothermic dehydrogenation of a secondary benzylic alcohol to the corresponding ketone in a catalytic reaction chamber adjacent to the engine. 1-Phenyl-1-propanol has been identified as a suitable alcohol. In a fully functioning TRFC, the H2 produced from the dehydrogenation will be sent to the fuel cell's anode, while the ketone, propiophenone, will be sent to the cathode to serve as an oxidant, together producing electricity to charge a battery that could power auxiliary vehicle components. The electrochemical reduction of the ketone back to the original benzylic alcohol would take place at the cathode. For such a system to be viable, both reactions must be very selective and rapid. Herein, the initial development of this system and the implications of catalyst and benzylic alcohol choice on the performance of both of these reactions are discussed. For the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol, Pd/SiO2 offers the highest selectivity (99.65%) at 200 °C. For the re-hydrogenation of the analogous ketone, propiophenone, palladium catalysts offer the highest selectivity, although the highest rates are observed for platinum immobilized on Vulcan XC-72 carbon support; surface modification of commercial catalysts with n-butyl tin also affects the selectivity and rate in a manner that depends on the choice of catalyst support. It has also been shown that the electronic and steric properties of the phenyl ring substituents and the identity of the alkyl chain affect the rate and selectivity.

Broader context
Severing our society's reliance on the burning of fossil fuels for energy is a major challenge moving forward. A significant amount of energy is consumed globally, and a significant portion of that energy is generated for the transportation of goods and services. In Canada, in 2009, transport trucks travelled over 2.8 million kilometers, burning over 8.7 million liters of diesel and gasoline and producing over 17.3 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide [Statistics Canada]. The proposed thermally regenerative fuel cell system could remove the requirement for the internal combustion engine to generate electricity for various vehicle components (via the alternator), resulting in an increased fuel efficiency of such vehicles. Even modest improvements to long-haul trucks' fuel efficiencies, as would be expected from this system, could reduce the global environmental impact of such activities dramatically. This is a unique application of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, exploiting the advantages of the technology without expressed concern for obstacles such as the volumetric and gravimetric storage densities of the hydrogen carrier. The system requires only catalytic amounts of H2 to convert waste heat energy into work in the form of electrical energy.

Introduction
Despite significant development of the internal combustion (IC) engine since its inception, its efficiency at turning the chemical energy of fuel into mechanical power is limited. This is due to a number of factors including overcoming engine and drive train friction, powering accessories via the alternator, and engine idling. The largest loss of energy, however, is loss of heat to the surroundings, comprising 55% or more of the total energy generated in a typical diesel engine.1 This energy is not only wasted, but must be removed from the engine block to prevent lubricant degradation. This is traditionally accomplished with the use of an engine coolant/radiator system.
There are several types of waste heat recovery systems known. Currently, waste heat is only recovered in turbochargers (mainly diesel) or to warm the passenger cabin.2 An alternative system to harness waste heat, using an organic working fluid, is known as the Organic Rankine Cycle.3 The search for ways to maximize the waste heat recovery efficiency by this method continues in the literature, with investigation of various new working fluids.4 The use of solid-state thermoelectric materials to convert waste heat directly to electrical energy has also been proposed for the automotive industry. The first examples of these materials from the 1940–60s, such as ZnSb and PbTe had very low efficiencies, while modern, more complex combinations like PbTe quantum dots embedded in a PbSeTe matrix have greatly enhanced efficiencies.5 The search, however, continues for new materials with increased efficiencies that would make these systems economical.
The use of a thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC) can also be envisioned to convert vehicular thermal waste energy into electrical energy without producing any byproducts. While a significant amount of research was done toward TRFC development between the 1950s and 1970s, most of those systems operated at very high temperatures and used metal salts or hydrides as the fuel source or electrolyte.6,7 For example, a TRFC published in 1965 used I2/PbI2 as a continuous gas concentration cell, absorbing thermal energy at temperatures ≤400 °C.8 More recent developments by Ando et al. describe TRFCs that use organic hydrogen carriers and low-grade waste heat. They proposed using a low temperature heat source (such as solar) to heat the anode of a fuel cell to dehydrogenate 2-propanol to acetone. A cooling system at the cathode provides conditions suitable for acetone rehydrogenation.9 In a second paper, they describe a system with the same carrier fluid pair where the dehydrogenation takes place in a reactor separate from the fuel cell itself.10 With optimization of the cathode catalyst and electrolyte system, currents between 50–100 mA and a voltage of 100 mV were achieved.
In general, organic TRFC such as those described by Ando, use heat to dehydrogenate a hydrogen carrier (XH2) to produce H2 for a fuel cell, and the dehydrogenated carrier (X). X recombines with the protons and electrons at the cathode of a fuel cell to generate electricity and regenerate XH2 in a closed loop system (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Summary of thermally regenerative fuel cell reactions. 
Another example of an organic thermally regenerative fuel cell comes from Akimoto.11 In that patent, a system is described where acetone and isopropanol are used as the fluids (similar to Ando's system above), but where the dehydrogenation takes place in the gas phase and both reactions take place in separate chambers as opposed to at the electrodes. Generation of electricity by the fuel cell relies on a H2 pressure difference between the anode and the cathode because the oxidation and reduction reactions are the same half-reactions. Another downside is that the need to separate the H2 and isopropanol gases after they exit the dehydrogenation chamber necessitates undesirable complexity in the system. Furthermore, both Akimoto and Ando's systems use acetone/isopropanol as their fuel system, meaning that either the reaction temperature must be kept low or the reactions must be performed in the gas phase.
We propose the use of a TRFC to convert waste heat energy generated at the engine of a long-haul transport truck into electrical energy for powering auxiliary components.12 Despite the fact that the increase in fuel efficiency is expected to be small, the overall benefit could be substantial over the lifetime of a truck. This system could replace or supplement the alternator, generating most or all of the required electricity for auxiliary components. Depending on the vehicle, the alternator uses 2–10% of the fuel energy.13 This could lead to a fuel economy improvement of 6–13% in the vehicle's mileage.
Our proposed system (Fig. 1) would involve the dehydrogenation of XH2 as it passes over a heterogeneous catalyst in a reaction chamber positioned adjacent to the engine block in such a way as to achieve a desired reaction temperature of 200–250 °C, far greater than the 80 °C of Ando's system. This reaction would produce H2 and X. The H2 would be delivered to the anode of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell where it would be catalytically split to protons and electrons. X would be passed to the cathode of the fuel cell where it would recombine with the protons and electrons liberated at the anode to reconstitute XH2 at the operating temperature of the fuel cell, 100–150 °C. The XH2 would re-enter the dehydrogenation reaction chamber where the cycle would begin again. The overall higher temperatures of our proposed system make it more flexible and widely applicable to varying waste heat capture applications.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the proposed thermally regenerative fuel cell system. 
There are a number of components of the proposed system that must be developed before realization of a working prototype: the fuel cell membrane and other membrane assembly components, the catalysts used at both the cathode of the fuel cell and in the dehydrogenation chamber, and the fluid couple X/XH2. The fluids chosen must be able to undergo rapid, chemoselective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation under an atmosphere of H2, and should remain chemically stable over the operating temperature range. Because H2 would be continuously generated and consumed, XH2 does not require a high H2 gravimetric storage capacity; one mole of H2 per mole of XH2 is sufficient. Very high selectivities (>99.9%) must be achievable, however, with adequate rates. The in situ conversion of X/XH2 to unreactive byproducts will quickly dilute the active fuel components, slowing the reactions and reducing the energy generating capacity of the system. A solventless reaction is desirable for this reason. Both catalysts must be heterogeneous and stable against leaching so that they can be isolated in specific areas of the system, preventing unwanted reactions from taking place elsewhere. Because the driving force behind the system is the temperature difference between the reaction chamber and the fuel cell, a difference of at least 100 °C must be maintained. This would allow for a sufficient difference in the equilibrium compositions at the two locations to allow for efficient energy conversion. Herein, the details of the original fluid screening, as well as the optimization of the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation systems (including the screening of different catalysts and X/XH2 substituents) are discussed. Fuel cell membrane and assembly components are currently being developed and optimized and will be the subject of future publications.
Results and discussion
Initial X/XH2 and catalyst screening
An ideal X/XH2 pair should rapidly, selectively and reversibly interconvert under 1 atm of H2 at the temperature extremes of the system, and remain otherwise chemically stable at the operating temperatures. Because a high gravimetric hydrogen capacity is not necessary, compounds with only one reactive bond were considered as potential candidates, in order to limit possible side reactions.
The more endothermic the dehydrogenation reaction, the more viable the candidate is to act as a heat sink. However, the enthalpy change should not be so high as to prevent the reverse reaction. Susceptibility to side product formation under the reaction conditions will also dictate which class of compounds can be employed. Dehydrogenation is generally more endothermic for C–O bonds (alcohol to ketone) than for C–N (amine to imine) or especially C–C bonds (alkane to alkene); this trend can be calculated from literature bond dissociation energy values14 or from ΔHf values for representative compounds.
Tests of selected compounds demonstrated that the use of C–C bond dehydrogenation, the least endothermic transformation, would not be appropriate for the system. The reverse reaction, the hydrogenation of N-methylindole to N-methylindoline (1, shown below, where the reactivity takes place at the designated bond) over 0.1 mol% Pd/C at 100 °C under 1 atm H2 showed poor conversion and selectivity after 6 h. Pd/C was chosen as the catalyst for these initial screenings because of its reported utility for catalysing such transformations.15,16 This poor result may be due to the tertiary amine functionality in this molecule; the binding energy between the nitrogen atom and the catalyst may be too high, resulting in irreversible adsorption to, and therefore poisoning of, the catalyst surface. Benzofuran, in contrast, was quantitatively hydrogenated with excellent selectively (no NMR-detectable sideproducts) under these conditions, but dehydrogenation of the resulting saturated compound, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), went poorly. After 6 h at 200 °C, over 0.1 mol% Pd/C, conversion reached 82%, but with only 59% selectivity for the desired product under Ar. 2-Ethylphenol was the predominant side product, which is rather surprising because the only source of H2 for the observed hydrogenolysis reaction was the dehydrogenation of the ring itself; the rate of H2 desorption must therefore be slower than the rate of hydrogenolysis. The results are expected to be worse under H2 because its presence would increase the rate of hydrogenolysis to 2-ethylphenol. Other compounds having –CH2CH2- groups that might dehydrogenate (succinic anhydride, succinimide, ethylene carbonate, 2-imidazolidinone, diethylsuccinate, 2-methylsuccinic acid, and bibenzyl) were tested for dehydrogenation at 200 °C over a variety of catalysts (1 mol% loadings of Pd/C, Pt/C, Rh/C, or RuC, or 10 mol% loading of Ni/kieselghur) without any reaction being observed. The use of C–C bond dehydrogenation was therefore abandoned.  
The dehydrogenation of amines to imines is the second most endothermic reaction. Four different amines were tested for selective dehydrogenation including: benzylamine (3), α-methylbenzylamine (4), N-benzylaniline (5) and N-(1-phenylethyl)aniline (6). Over 0.1 mol% metal loading of Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C under 1 atm H2 for 1 h, the described amines either suffered from severe decomposition under the reaction conditions (3 and 4) or underwent only 0–1% conversion (5 and 6). These results should not be necessarily surprising. The disproportionation of primary alkyl amines to secondary amines and ammonia under similar conditions is known.17 Also, imines are susceptible to hydrolysis, particularly under acid catalyzed conditions as are present in a fuel cell membrane. These could be avoided by running the system under meticulously dry conditions, but it is unlikely that this is an achievable condition in a real-world system. As with N-methylindole above, these nitrogen-containing compounds may be basic enough to poison the catalyst surface.  
Lastly, the most endothermic transformation, the dehydrogenation of alcohols to ketones, was evaluated. The dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol went to ≥99% conversion with ≥99% selectivity (no other peaks were visible in the 1H NMR spectra) over 0.1 mol% Pd/C at 200 °C for 6 h under Ar. Therefore, along with two related alcohols, it was tested for susceptibility to catalytic dehydrogenation under 1 atm H2 (Table 1). Under H2, the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol over Pd/C is not as selective as it was under Ar; only 87% conversion with 66% selectivity for the desired product was observed (entry 1). A comparison of common Pd catalysts (entries 2 and 3) found that excellent selectivity could be obtained under H2 with the use of Pd/SiO2. This catalyst was also used in tests of the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol (entry 4) and benzyl alcohol (entry 5); while the high selectivity was maintained, the conversion after 1 h decreased with decreasing alkyl chain length.

With successes observed for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to ketones over Pd/SiO2, the investigation of alcohols was expanded. It would be thermodynamically and kinetically advantageous to have the ketone product of dehydrogenation distill out of the liquid phase in the dehydrogenation reactor, thereby increasing the concentration of the alcohol remaining in the liquid phase. Therefore, we sought a ketone/alcohol pair in which the ketone has a much lower boiling point than the alcohol. Short chain alcohols have very different boiling points than the analogous ketones (e.g. methanol boils at 65 °C, whereas formaldehyde boils at −21 °C), but the absolute values are too low for our application. The absolute boiling point of higher molecular weight alcohols like 1-phenyl-1-propanol is higher, but the difference relative to the ketone is much smaller (1-phenyl-1-propanol boils at 211 °C whereas propiophenone boils at 218 °C). Short chain diols may offer a compromise: ethylene glycol boils at 197 °C while the glyoxal dehydrogenation product boils at 51 °C. There are also, however, drawbacks to the use of diols. The two alcohol moieties are expected to undergo sequential dehydrogenation, yielding two or three potential products from symmetrical or asymmetrical diols respectively. Also, at 200 °C, it is reasonable to expect dehydration of the alcohol with subsequent CC hydrogenation or C–OH hydrogenolysis, increasing the number of possible side products. Regardless, the dehydrogenations of several short chain diols were attempted over Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C for 1 h under 1 atm H2 to determine the conversion and selectivity (Table 2). Even though great care was taken to catch any volatile products, the conversion from starting material was very low and, for two of the diols, produced a myriad of unidentified products. For 1,2-propane diol and 2,3-butane diol, it was confirmed that the limited conversion was to the singly-dehydrogenated product. No doubly-dehydrogenated product was observed from any of the diols under these conditions. Based on these results, it is clear that diols are not viable fluids for the TRFC.

The initial X/XH2 screening results suggest that benzylic alcohols and ketones, specifically 1-phenyl-1-propanol (6) and propiophenone (7), are the leading candidates for the proposed TRFC system to be subjected to further optimization (Scheme 2). They are liquid over the operating temperature range and offer good conversion and selectivity over Pd/SiO2.

Temperature dependence of the equilibrium
The first question that had to be answered regarding the properties of the chosen X/XH2 is whether there is a sufficient difference between the equilibrium compositions at the system's temperature extremes. To probe this, the equilibrium constant at various temperatures over the desired range (100, 120, 140, 160, 180 and 200 °C), starting from pure propiophenone (X) and from pure 1-phenyl-1-propanol (XH2), were measured. The reactions were carried out over 0.1–1.0 mol% loading of a commercial 5 wt% Pd/SiO2, under 1 atm of H2. Higher catalyst loadings were used at lower temperatures to ensure equilibrium was reached in a reasonable time. The equilibrium constants for the dehydrogenation reaction were then calculated using mole fractions of 6 and 7 rather than activities in the equilibrium expression. These results are summarized in Table 3 where χXH2 is the mole fraction of the alcohol in the alcohol/ketone mixture at the equilibrium.

It is therefore expected that the equilibrium mixture at 100 °C is about 97% 1-phenyl-1-propanol, while at 200 °C it is only about 46% 1-phenyl-1-propanol. This is expected to be a sufficient difference for the proposed TRFC system. A van't Hoff plot of the data (Fig. 2) also indicates that the dehydrogenation enthalpy and entropy are: ΔH° = 56.3 kJ mol−1 and ΔS° = 119.1 J mol−1 K−1 respectively.
 Fig. 2  van't Hoff plot for the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol. 
Dehydrogenation catalyst screening
Next, a comprehensive screening was undertaken to identify a catalyst that could provide the highest possible selectivity for the desired product, propiophenone. The interconversion between 1-phenyl-1-propanol and propiophenone + H2 can form a number of byproducts (Scheme 3). Chemoselectivity is of great importance because of the closed nature of the system. As the same mixture of X/XH2 would be continuously cycled, the buildup of unreactive side products from the reaction would diminish the generation of electrical power. For example, at 99% selectivity for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions combined, there would be <50% X/XH2 remaining after only 70 hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. As the selectivity is increased to 99.9%, 99.99%, and so on, the number of available cycles increases ∼10 fold each time. Ultimately, the selectivity will dictate how often the X/XH2 fluid mixture will have to be replaced in the TRFC system but preliminary calculations have indicated that a selectivity of better than 99.9% is needed.

The dehydrogenation chamber will be maintained at 200–245 °C, under 1 atm of H2. If the temperature or H2 pressure in the chamber is too high, however, poor conversion and selectivity may result, either by suppression of product formation, proliferation of side reactions or coke formation. Therefore, it was necessary to determine if the catalysts being screened could afford the required selectivity and conversion for propiophenone under 1 atm H2 at high temperatures.
Palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium catalysts, with a wide range of supports, were considered due to their well-established activity with respect to alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. In 1990, Van Dam et al. investigated the oxidation of methanol over Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh and Ru/C in the presence of dissolved O2.18 The trend in catalytic activity was found to follow: Pt > Pd > Ir > Rh ≫ Ru with respect to turnover frequency (TOF). In 2001, Keresszegi et al. studied the transfer dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone over supported Pd catalysts with cyclohexene as a hydrogen acceptor.19 The catalyst supports included CaCO3, Al2O3, TiO2 and carbon, of which Al2O3 provided the best catalyst, obtaining a conversion of 77%, with a selectivity of 100%, after 1 h. A review published in 2004 by Mallat and Baiker20 also outlined the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol, as well as benzyl alcohol, over supported Pd, Ru, and Pt catalysts under aerobic conditions. The catalytic supports listed were widely varied (e.g. Al2O3, hydroxyapatite, zeolite, MCM-41, etc.) and the catalysts themselves ranged from mono-, to bi-, to multi-metallic (e.g. Ru/Al2O3, 5% Pt-0.8% Bi/Al2O3, Ru0.35MnFe1.5Cu0.15Ox, etc.). All of the catalysts provided excellent selectivity for the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol (≥98%) and benzyl alcohol (≥95%).
It has also been shown in the literature that the identity of the catalyst support affects the catalytic activity and selectivity, either directly,21 or through particle size inducing effects during metal deposition (differences in particle and pore sizes and shapes). Varying the nature of the support from basic (i.e. CaCO3), to neutral (i.e. carbon), to acidic (i.e. SiO2), makes it possible to investigate the subsequent effect on the electronic nature of the metal, as basic and acidic supports are electron donating and withdrawing, respectively. Supports were also chosen based on their expected robustness under the reaction conditions.
The identity of the catalyst affected both the average rate in the first hour of 1-phenyl-1-propanol dehydrogenation (i.e. highest conversion after 1 h) and the selectivity for propiophenone (7). Based on the catalyst screening results (Table 4), all ruthenium and rhodium catalysts were eliminated as viable catalysts due to their universally poor selectivity for propiophenone. The viability of platinum catalysts varied with support. Pt/SiO2 was the only supported platinum catalyst tested that offered a selectivity of at least 99.9% for propiophenone, suggesting that an acidic support may be necessary to obtain such selectivity with platinum. However, because the conversion with Pt/SiO2 was very poor, it was eliminated as a potential dehydrogenation catalyst. While the selectivity offered by the unsupported Pt/Ir mesh wire catalyst appeared to be high, the conversion was so low that it was also eliminated as a potential catalyst.

Palladium catalysts consistently provided better selectivity and conversion than other catalysts tested, regardless of support, with Pd/SiO2, Pd/BaCO3, Pd/CaCO3·Pb, and Pd/PEI·SiO2 (PEI = polyethylenimine) all offering the best selectivities for propiophenone (99.9%). Of these catalysts, Pd/SiO2 offered the highest rate with a conversion of 50% after 1 h, followed by Pd/PEI·SiO2 with 38% conversion and Pd/BaCO3 and Pd/CaCO3·Pb, both with 27% conversion. To explain these differences, some insight may be offered by comparing the catalysts' respective surface areas (Table 5). Pd/SiO2 has the highest surface area, followed by Pd/PEI·SiO2, then Pd/CaCO3·Pb and Pd/BaCO3; the trend in surface area matches the trend in rate.

It should be noted that the most common side product observed, in all cases, was propylbenzene originating from the hydrogenolysis of the alcohol group (selectivities of 0.1–29.0%). Ring hydrogenation of starting material or product was only observed with half of the catalysts, and occurred with varying selectivity (0.1–17.8%).
Pd/SiO2 was chosen as the catalyst for use in the dehydrogenation chamber of the TRFC system because it offered the best selectivity and conversion, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In order to more accurately determine the selectivity and conversion of the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol with this catalyst, the reaction was repeated and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). As an analysis method, GC offers a lower limit of detection than 1H NMR spectroscopy. We have independently determined that our 1H NMR spectrometer is able to confidently give selectivity values as low as 0.5% while our GC can give values as low as 0.001% (see experimental for details). The propiophenone selectivity determined by GC tended to be slightly lower than that by NMR spectroscopy because GC was more sensitive to very small amounts of minor byproducts. The ring-hydrogenation products in particular, because there are many of them, are underestimated by NMR spectroscopy. For example, for Pd/SiO2 that had been heat treated to remove moisture before use, the selectivity of the dehydrogenation to propiophenone (7) was 99.9% by NMR spectroscopy (Table 4) but 99.65 ± 0.02% by GC. Compared to what is normally expected in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, this selectivity is quite good. It is not, however, as high as one might want for a TRFC.
Catalyst leaching
Potential leaching of the metal from Pd/SiO2 under the TRFC dehydrogenation reaction conditions was also investigated. To ensure that such leaching would not be an issue, a single sample of Pd/SiO2 (with the usual 0.1 mol% metal loading) was used for 16 sequential dehydrogenation reactions over the course of two months. For each cycle, the catalyst was filtered and a fresh equivalent of 1-phenyl-1-propanol added to it. The reaction mixtures from cycles 6 and 15 were then sent for ICP-MS analysis. The amount of leached Pd was determined to be 2 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively, establishing the robustness of the catalyst under the reaction conditions.
Dehydrogenations at higher temperatures
The driving force of the TRFC system is the shift in the X/XH2 equilibrium due to the temperature difference between the dehydrogenation chamber and the fuel cell. If the temperature difference could be increased, the driving force would also increase, as there would be a greater difference between the equilibrium compositions. Increasing the dehydrogenation temperature was therefore proposed and investigated.
An alternative to 1-phenyl-1-propanol was needed because it has a relatively low boiling point (219 °C). Extending the alkyl chain by two carbon atoms gives 1-phenyl-1-pentanol, which has a boiling point of 256 °C. It dehydrogenates to give valerophenone (boiling point: 245 °C), and could undergo hydrogenolysis to give pentylbenzene (boiling point: 205 °C). The catalysts chosen were those five that afforded selectivities of 99.9% (by NMR) for 1-phenyl-1-propanol dehydrogenation at 200 °C: 5% Pd/CaCO3·Pb, 5% Pd/BaCO3, 5% Pt/SiO2, 1% Pd/PEI·SiO2 (Table 6).

Two catalysts, 5% Pd/CaCO3·Pb and 1% Pd/PEI·SiO2, afforded selectivities of ≥99% for valerophenone at 245 °C. Additional tests were performed at a lower temperature of 230 °C in an attempt to improve the selectivity. No significant improvements in selectivity were noted, with that for the Pd/PEI·SiO2 catalyzed reaction actually being lower. Conversion was affected by a greater degree, but in different directions: Pd/CaCO3·Pb had lower conversion at 230 °C while that of Pd/PEI·SiO2 was higher. Regardless, initial results at higher temperatures are not promising and much further development would be required to optimize this for the proposed system.
The best example of a dehydrogenation system presented herein is that of 1-phenyl-1-propanol over 0.1 mol% Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C, giving 35% conversion and 99.65% selectivity for propiophenone. With this, the hydrogenation of propiophenone back to 1-phenyl-1-propanol is considered.
Hydrogenation catalyst screening
There has been relatively little work toward achieving the extreme selectivities required for heterogeneously catalyzed phenyl ketone hydrogenations, in part, due to lack of necessity and interest. Classically, this transformation is done with stoichiometric inorganic hydride reducing agents (LiAlH4, NaBH4), which produce toxic residues.22 There have indeed been some heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature for this transformation, but they usually require additives such as amines or NaOH and are performed in a solvent in order to achieve high selectivities and often operate under moderate to high H2 pressures.23 While the use of additives could be incorporated, their selection must be done very carefully to avoid unwanted interactions with the liquids, catalysts and membrane electrode assembly components. Therefore, such strategies were avoided in this initial investigation.
Zaccheria et al. report high selectivities (97–100%) with high conversions (>99%) after moderate reaction times at 90 °C under 1 atm H2 for a selection of phenyl ketones with an 8% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst.24 Despite the fact that these conditions are close to those described for our desired system, catalyst loadings were extremely high and the reactions were carried out in a dilute mixture in n-heptane. Additionally, in the authors' hands, the catalyst prepared as described proved inactive under our conditions. We have found no reports of any heterogeneous hydrogenations of phenyl ketones where no solvent is used. Because an appropriate catalyst system was not found in the literature, a screening and development project was undertaken to try to find an appropriate combination of catalyst and X/XH2 redox couple.
We chose to use a batch system, employing a neat slurry of powdered catalyst and the desired ketone under 1 atm H2, as a model for the reduction reaction that would take place at the cathode. While this is not truly representative of the proposed system, these studies produced valuable information about the trends in reactivity and selectivity.
The results of this initial screening of commercially available heterogeneous catalysts, based on the most popular metals for fuel cell catalysis (Pt, Pd, Ru), are shown in Table 7. There are very few catalysts that offer selectivities close to the desired 99.9% benchmark. With 5 wt% Pd/PEI·SiO2 (entry 8) a selectivity of 98.0% was achieved, with very low conversion (4.0%). The most selective catalyst is Pd/SiO2 (entry 3), with a selectivity of ≥99.99%, as determined by gas chromatography (GC), in that only 1-phenyl-1-propanol and starting material were detected in the GC trace (vide infra). High selectivity was again, however, accompanied by low conversion (6%). If the reaction time is extended to 5 h, a conversion of 17% is achieved but the selectivity decreases to 96%. From these results, simultaneously obtaining both the required rate and selectivity appears to be unobtainable with propiophenone and these catalysts.

Electrically conductive supports
Catalysts supported on SiO2 offer negligible electron conductivity and therefore would not be appropriate for the final membrane electrode assembly of the fuel cell. Despite the poor initial selectivity obtained with carbon based catalysts (Table 7, entries 1, 2, 11–13), Vulcan XC-72 based heterogeneous catalysts were investigated further. Vulcan XC-72 is an industry standard conductive and static dissipating carbon black with high surface area that has shown promise for fuel cell catalyst applications. The benefit of these carbon-supported catalysts, beyond the electron conductivity of the support, is the greater rate of hydrogenation relative to SiO2-supported catalysts. Initial results with commercial Pt/Vulcan XC-72, at both 10 and 20 wt% metal/support, indicated good conversions but low selectivities after 1 h (entries 12 and 13). Because the reaction selectivity on Pd-based catalysts has proven superior to Pt-based catalysts, two different 5 wt% Pd/Vulcan XC-72 catalysts were prepared by wet-impregnation on commercially available Vulcan XC-72 support. These were generated from two different Pd sources, PdCl2 and Pd(OAc)2 and tested for the hydrogenation of propiophenone. The results are markedly different. After 1 h with 1 mol% metal loading, 54% selectivity at 8.2% conversion was observed for the former (from PdCl2), and 98% selectivity at 14% conversion for the latter (from Pd(OAc)2). This disparity may be due to residual chlorine on the PdCl2 based catalyst's surface; chlorine has been shown to hinder the selectivity of such reactions.25,26 Chlorine is usually volatilized from the surface by high temperature calcination after impregnation (≥530 °C), but calcination is not possible with Vulcan XC-72 based catalysts because they undergo loss of carbon powder above 350 °C.27,28
Catalyst modification
Further increases in rate, while maintaining high selectivities, were still desirable and the challenge was approached through catalyst modification. Manipulations of these Vulcan XC-72 catalysts may help to increase the observed activity and selectivity, possibly as the result of surface modification with other metals.
Santori et al. reported that modification of the surface of heterogeneous catalysts with organometallic n-butyl tin moieties increases the hydrogenation selectivity and conversion for a number of related compounds.29 They report evidence for ionic tin on the surface, which increases the favourability of end-on and side-on adsorbing of the CO moiety to the surface, the binding modes that lead to the ketone hydrogenation. Once bound, the positively charged tin-modified environment helps to weaken the CO bond by withdrawing electron density. The presence of butyl groups sterically hinders planar phenyl ring binding to the catalyst surface to prevent ring hydrogenation. Thus, a commercial 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst was selectively poisoned by butyl tin moieties to give a Sn:Pd atom ratio of 1:5.6 (about 1 wt%). This modification yielded an increase in selectivity toward the desired alcohol for the propiophenone hydrogenation reaction. At 140 °C, where only 58% selectivity (at 43% conversion) was observed with the commercial catalyst, as received, >99% selectivity was achieved with the modified catalyst. This result, however, is accompanied by a significant decrease in conversion, to 14% over the same reaction time. The decrease in rate is not surprising considering the use of a selective poison, added specifically to cover some of the active catalytic sites. In contrast, with a tin-modified 5 wt% Pd/SiO2 (Sn:Pd atom ratio of 1:5.2, about 1 wt%) at 140 °C, the propiophenone hydrogenation conversion actually increased relative to the unmodified catalyst, 12% compared to 9.6%. The reaction selectivity was >99% for both the modified and unmodified catalysts. The effect of the Sn modification is likely different for the two catalysts due to a difference in the interaction between the n-butyl tin moieties and the oxide support surface compared to those with the carbon support, which is promising. To see if such enhancements may be possible with the Vulcan XC-72 based catalysts, a Sn-modified commercial 20 wt% Pt/Vulcan XC-72 was made and tested (Sn:Pt atom ratio of 1:18, about 1 wt% Sn). Under the standard hydrogenation conditions, a conversion of 26%, with a selectivity of 75%, was achieved, which is a lower conversion than achieved with the unmodified catalyst (83%, Table 7, entry 13). A higher loading of Sn (Sn:Pt atom ratio of 1:3, about 5 wt%) almost completely arrested the catalytic activity: the conversion was only 6%. It is possible that such modifications will result in a better catalyst for our proposed system, depending on the support. Further study of catalyst modifiers is needed, including effect on selectivity, the extent of modifier leaching, and possible effects on other system components.
Thus far, there are two catalysts with relatively high rates and selectivities for the hydrogenation of propiophenone. At 100 °C, Pd/Vulcan XC-72 (prepared in house from a Pd(OAc)2 precursor) gives 14% conversion after 1 h with 98% selectivity to 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Secondly, a commercial 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst poisoned with 1 wt% n-butyl tin also gave 14% conversion after 1 h with 99% selectivity, but at 140 °C. The former is thought to be more promising at this time. Regardless of the fact that further studies on the effect of Sn on the system are required, the former operates at a lower temperature (100 vs. 140 °C). This point is especially important because of the importance of maintaining the temperature difference between the two reactions. To reach dehydrogenation temperatures high enough to maintain adequate disparity, one would have to exceed the boiling point of the alcohol and ketone, creating a number of additional problems.
Optimization of X towards higher hydrogenation rates
In addition to the catalyst screening, a number of substituted phenyl ketones were screened for their ability to undergo chemoselective hydrogenation over 1 mol% loading of 5 wt% Pd/SiO2 (Table 8). Both the alkyl group and the para-substituent of the phenyl group were varied.

While the conversion was still poor for many of the ketones, there is a marked dependence of the rate on both R groups. First, we consider the effect of varying the alkyl group R1 (entries 1, 6, 10, 11) on conversion and selectivity. It is difficult to differentiate between steric and electronic effects because the steric bulk, the electron donating nature of the substituents and the reaction rate all increase in parallel (i.e. t-Bu > i-Pr > Et > Me).
Second, we investigated the effect of ring substitution by testing the hydrogenation of several propiophenone analogues substituted at the para-position (Table 8, entries 4–9). Electron-withdrawing substituents clearly increase the rate of hydrogenation (Fig. 3), in contrast to the trend for R1. The only R2 substituent deviating from the general trend in the figure is the bulky substituent t-butyl; that ketone is hydrogenated much more rapidly than ketones with small p-substituents of comparable electronic properties. It has been suggested in the literature that the η1-(O) adsorption mode on the metal surface is more reactive toward hydrogenation than the η2-(C,O) adsorption mode (Fig. 4).29 Bulky groups at the R1 and R2 positions would prevent coplanar binding, limiting the number of catalytic sites being occupied by molecules binding through this unreactive binding mode (and possibly others). The η2-(C,O) binding mode would also place the phenyl ring in the appropriate configuration for orbital overlap leading to binding with the surface. Any molecules adsorbed to the surface via these undesirable binding modes would decrease the number of active sites available for adsorption of hydrogen and the ketone via the η1-(O) mode, and could lead to unwanted ring hydrogenation. Among the ketones with small p-substituents, the rate of reaction increases with increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent. The increase in rate could be related to an increase in the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon atom. The increased positive charge would increase the dipole across the CO double bond, allowing for more facile association with the metal surface. It should be mentioned here that the proposed mechanism for the electrochemical reduction of phenyl ketones involves initial approach of the electropositive carbon atom of the carbonyl functionality toward the electrode surface through the η1-(C) binding mode instead.30,31 Preventing side-on binding at the electrocatalyst surface should still be beneficial (to prevent the blocking of active sites) as would a more positive carbonyl carbon atom, favouring the initial approach toward the electronegative cathode surface. Having the bulky group, which has been shown to be advantageous at the para-position, at the meta- or ortho-positions might be beneficial, as it would not impede the active binding mode, but should still prevent side-on binding of the phenyl ring.

 Fig. 4  Possible CO–metal binding modes for hydrogenation. 
Overall, the rate observed with 4′-trifluoromethylpropiophenone is promising (27% after 1 h) considering the selectivity over Pd/SiO2 is >99% (Table 8, entry 11). However, the use of a p-CF3 group strongly inhibits the dehydrogenation reaction; a test of the dehydrogenation of 1-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)propan-1-ol over Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C showed negligible conversion after 1 h.
Theoretical implications on TRFC viability
Regarding the reaction selectivities, the best achieved for the dehydrogenation was 99.65% after 1 h. For the hydrogenation, the best achieved with Pd/Vulcan was 98%. It is likely that this is a low estimate of the achievable selectivity for the reduction of propiophenone at the cathode and further testing in a TRFC prototype is needed. Regardless, if one complete chemical cycle, including the dehydrogenation XH2 and the rehydrogenation of X, achieved these selectivities (97.66% overall per cycle), the number of chemical cycles possible would be about 30 before 50% of that fluid has been converted to side products, and would need to be replaced. Even a slight enhancement of the overall cycle efficiency to 99% would result in this number of cycles increasing to 67.
While these numbers may seem low, it should be noted that the length of running time before this benchmark is dependent on the number of cycles as well as the volume of liquid used (the more molecules in the system originally, the longer it will take to exhaust all of their available chemical cycles). The flow rates required to achieve the necessary power will also have a large effect on how the number of cycles translates into running time. The flow rates could also be dynamic in that they can be adjusted to compensate for the changing reaction rates and power demands.
Regarding the implications of the reaction rates, the initial rate of dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol over Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C is 22 mol H2 per mol Pd per min over the first 10 min, or 0.21 mol H2 per g Pd per min. The rate of the electrochemical reduction at the cathode is not known, however it can be adjusted by simply adjusting the number of fuel cells (i.e. the amount of catalyst) relative to the amount of catalyst employed in the reaction chamber for the dehydrogenation. Assuming a rate similar to the chemical hydrogenation (0.70 mol H2 per mol Pd per min), the fuel cells would need to contain approximately 31 times the amount of catalyst in the dehydrogenation vessel, to make the hydrogenation rate match the dehydrogenation rate; that amount of Pd will need to be greatly reduced before the system can be economical. Presuming the fuel cell stack could convert all of the hydrogen evolved to electricity at this rate with perfect efficiency, this would be equivalent to 665 A per g Pd in the dehydrogenation reactor.
A modest fuel cell voltage estimate of 64 mV means that this system would be able to provide 43 W per g Pd in the dehydrogenation chamber. Commercial trucking alternators, the technology that this aims to supplant, operate at 12 V with a current of 100–300 A, meaning a power output of 1200–3600 W, significantly higher than that estimated above for the TRFC. In order to increase the rate of the dehydrogenation to produce this much power, about 28 g of palladium would be required. If the re-hydrogenation in the fuel cells can operate at one fifth of that efficiency, another 140 g of Pd will be required there. Currently, Pd prices are approximately 700 USD/oz. (or 25 USD/g), meaning the cost of the palladium alone would be $4,200. This may be prohibitive, but consider the possible cost savings. Considering a maximum fuel savings of 10% (vide infra), and a 2000 survey of Canadian trucking companies, savings of 4,900–9,300 L fuel and $6,000–11,000 per truck per year could be expected.32 Therefore, the cost of the unit, even with a large amount of catalyst, could be paid with one year of fuel cost savings. Also, the projected CO2 emissions reduction for the entire Canadian trucking industry would be about 1.7 billion kg.33 While the cost may not necessarily be excessive, cost is not the only barrier to using such a large amount of a precious metal; its depletion must also be considered. With this in mind, a system that only partially replaces the power generated by the alternator may be considered. The authors also anticipate that further improvements for both reactions will be achievable with further testing and optimization with a TRFC prototype. In particular, improving the rate of the hydrogenation reaction would greatly decrease the amount of Pd needed and therefore the cost of the TRFC. These studies are currently underway; their results will follow.
Experimental
All reagents, solvents and catalysts were purchased from chemical suppliers and used as received. Vulcan XC-72 carbon powder and such supported catalysts were purchased from http://fuelcellstore.com. 1H NMR spectra were collected at 300 K on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer operating at 400.3 MHz, and referenced to SiMe4. Gas chromatograms were collected on a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatogram equipped with a DB-5 column (0.25 mm i.d., 30 m, 0.25 μm film thickness) from Agilent Technologies. Catalyst surface areas and pore sizes were determined using Micromeritics Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System 2010 manufactured by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation. Some experimental methods have been described previously.12
Initial X/XH2 and catalyst screening
Three unsaturated fuel candidates (N-methylindole, 2,3-benzofuran, propiophenone) were hydrogenated (5 ml) over 0.1 mol% metal loading of a commercial 10 wt% Pd/C catalyst in a 25 ml pear-shaped flask under a reflux condenser capped with a rubber septum. The reaction was stirred at 100 °C while H2 was bubbled through the mixture at a rate of 10 ml min−1 (using a needle submerged in the liquid for delivery and an exit needle from the headspace, through the septum, to an oil bubbler). After 6 h, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed, dissolved in CDCl3, and filtered to remove catalyst. The filtrate was then analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy,
Dehydrogenation testing of the analogous XH2 compounds, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and 1-phenyl-1-propanol, was done in a similar manner except Ar (g) was bubbled through the mixtures instead of H2, and the reaction temperature was 200 °C.
Initial screening of three palladium catalysts toward alcohol dehydrogenation was performed in a similar manner, employing 1-phenyl-1-propanol (5 ml) and 0.1 mol% loading of the metal at 200 °C for 4 h. The reactions were performed under 1 atm H2 to simulate the hydrogen atmosphere that would be present in the final fuel cell system.
Propiophenone/1-phenyl-propanol equilibrium determination
Starting from pure XH2, 1-phenyl-1-propanol (5.0 ml, 37 mmol) was added via syringe into an oven-dried, two-neck round bottom flask containing a stir bar and 0.1 mol% loading of 5 wt% Pd/SiO2 (80.2 mg catalyst, 0.037 mmol Pd). The catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 150 °C for 72 h prior to use. The flask was fitted with a condenser capped with a septum. H2 was flushed through the apparatus for 10 min before the flask was partially submerged in an oil bath pre-heated to the desired temperature (100–200 °C). H2 was continuously cycled through the apparatus for the duration of the reaction. Aliquots (50–70 μL) of the reaction mixture were removed periodically, and the conversion measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3 until no change was observed between samples, this was determined to be the equilibrium composition. A similar catalyst loading was used at 180 and 160 °C. At 140 °C, 0.5 mol% catalyst loading was used, at 120 and 100 °C, 1.0 mol% catalyst loading was used. Starting from pure X, propiophenone was used (5.0 ml, 38 mmol) with similar catalyst loadings depending on the temperature. The products of the dehydrogenation equilibrium expressions using the steady state concentrations, starting from both pure liquids, at each temperature were averaged to give the reported values of K.
Catalyst screening
Propiophenone or 1-phenyl-1-propanol (1.0 ml) was measured into a 16 × 100 mm disposable glass test tube containing the catalyst to be screened and a small magnetic stir-bar. For hydrogenation screening, a 1.0 mol% metal loading w.r.t. propiophenone was used, for dehydrogenations, a 0.1 mol% metal loading w.r.t. 1-phenyl-1-propanol. The test tube was capped with a rubber septum and H2 was flushed through the test tube for 15 min using two needles: a gas inlet needle positioned just above the liquid level and a gas outlet needle leading to an oil bubbler. After this, the gas outlet needle was removed completely and the gas inlet needle was retracted to just below the septum. Atmospheric pressure of H2 was maintained throughout the reaction as the gas manifold was connected to an oil bubbler. The test tube was lowered into an oil bath preheated to the reaction temperature (200 °C for dehydrogenation, 100 °C for hydrogenation) so that the mixture was under the oil level, and the mixture stirred at 170 rpm (for dehydrogenations) or 300 rpm (for hydrogenations) at this temperature for 1 h. After this time, the test tube was transferred immediately to an ice bath to stop the reaction. The neat reaction mixture was then filtered through a plug of Celite® 545 or lint-free tissue in a glass pipette to remove the catalyst. An aliquot of the filtrate was dissolved in CDCl3 for analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The spectra of product mixtures were compared to those of the expected products and byproducts found in the literature,34 and conversions and selectivities were calculated by relative proton integrations. The side-product 1-cyclohexenyl ethyl ketone was confirmed by EI-MS by comparing to authentic spectra from NIST EI-MS library. More precise selectivity measurements were sometimes needed; for this the final reaction mixtures were analyzed by CG and selectivity determined by relative peak integrations using calibration curves prepared with hexadecane as the internal standard.
With Vulcan XC-72 based catalysts, the reaction mixture was dissolved in Et2O for easier handling during workup and passed through a thicker layer of Celite® 545 to separate the very fine catalyst powder. The Et2O was removed by rotary evaporation before 1H NMR spectroscopy.
For the hydrogenation screening of other fluids, a 1.0 ml scale was maintained (1.0 g was used for those that are solid at room temperature) and the amount of catalyst adjusted appropriately.
For the dehydrogenation screening of other fluids, a carousel 12 Place Reaction Station (Radley Discovery Technologies) was employed. For each saturated liquid tested, 1.0 g was used (0.25 g for α-methylbenzylaniline) with 0.1 mol% loading of the desired supported catalyst. The reaction tubes were capped and attached to a hydrogen supply. The tubes were flushed with H2 at a rate of 50 ml min−1 for 10 min. The flow of H2 was then lowered to 10 ml min−1 for the remainder of the experiments. One tube was connected to an oil bubbler via a needle through the cap in order to vent the entire system. The reactor was raised to 200 °C and then stirred at 300 rpm for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by stopping the flow of H2 and cooling the tubes. The product mixtures were analyzed as above.
High temperature dehydrogenation studies were conducted as outlined above except at 230–240 °C and in a 25 × 150 mm disposable glass test tube.
Synthesis of α-methylbenzylaniline
Acetophenone (10.0 g, 83.2 mmol) was placed over activated molecular sieves (4 Å) under an inert atmosphere in a round bottom flask. Aniline (1.2 eq., 9.1 ml, 99.8 mmol) was then added to the flask using a syringe, and the mixture was refluxed overnight (16 h). The imine product was isolated from the molecular sieves by vacuum distillation in quantitative yield by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The imine product was then hydrogenated to α-methylbenzylaniline over Pd/C under 1 atm H2 at 100 °C for 4 h. The product was extracted with chloroform, filtered through a plug of Celite® 545 in a glass pipette to remove the catalyst and solvent removed under vacuum. The identity of the product was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis where the spectrum obtained matched that found in the literature.34
Reaction rate determination
Most of the results presented demonstrate the average rate over the first hour of the reaction in terms of the conversion in a fixed time (1 h). For the determination of the initial rate of dehydrogenation, 1-phenyl-1-propanol (5.0 ml, 37 mmol) was added to a 25 ml, two-necked reaction flask with a magnetic stir bar. A commercial 5 wt% Pd/SiO2 catalyst was added (0. 1 mol% metal loading, 77.7 mg catalyst, 0.0365 mmol Pd). One neck was fitted with a condenser that was, like the second neck, capped with a rubber septum. The flask was purged and the reaction started as in the catalyst screening procedure, with a stir rate of 400 rpm. However, aliquots of the reaction mixture (∼50 μL) were removed at different reaction times (10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min), dissolved in CDCl3, filtered to remove catalyst, and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy as above. A similar procedure was used to determine hydrogenation reaction rates employing propiophenone instead of 1-phenyl-1-propanol, and a reaction temperature of 100 °C.
Catalyst leaching analysis
The reaction mixture from the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol (∼2 ml) over Pd/SiO2 was filtered to remove catalyst, and the filtrate mixed with aqua-regia (1:3 HNO3:HCl v/v) and heated to 60 °C for 1 h, and then to 120 °C for an additional 2 h to digest the organic components. The mixture was then heated to dryness. Due to incomplete digestion, 10 ml of a 4% HNO3 (aq.) was added to the dried sample and left overnight to complete leaching of palladium from the solid phase into the aqueous phase. The suspension that formed was filtered to remove particulates and analyzed for Pd content by ICP-MS (Varian 820-MS) with calibration standards prepared in 4% HNO3 (aq.) from 1–100 ppb Pd.
Limit of detection (LOD) determination


1

H NMR spectroscopy: a spectrum was obtained (32 scans, line broadening of 1) of the product mixture of the dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol with 36% conversion. The smallest peak that could be identified with confidence (>3 times the intensity of the noise in the baseline) was a broad singlet at 5.5 ppm, and assigned to 2 vinyl protons. The peak's area was compared with the area of the 1-phenyl-1-propanol benzylic proton peak, the propiophenone methyl proton peaks, and the proton peaks representative of the known side products. It was determined that the smallest peak discernable corresponded to a selectivity of 0.5%. Gas Chromatography: the calculations used above were manipulated to determine what amount of a side product (i.e. propylbenzene) must be present to affect the third decimal place of the reaction's selectivity for the desired product. A standard solution of propylbenzene at this concentration (0.00022 M) was prepared and analyzed by GC. The peak was clearly visible (>3 times the intensity of baseline noise), indicating that selectivity from this GC method can be confidently reported to the third decimal place.
Preparation of 5 wt% Pd/Vulcan XC-72
Vulcan XC-72 (1.0 g) was weighed into a 100 ml round bottom flask, to which 5.0 M HNO3 (16 ml) was added. The mixture was heated to 50 °C in an oil bath and stirred magnetically for 2 h. The mixture was cooled, filtered, and the solid washed with distilled water. It was then transferred to a clean 100 ml round bottom flask and 15% (w/w) NaOH (15 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 60 min. The solid was again filtered and washed with distilled water before drying in a vacuum desiccator overnight. The prepared support was then mixed in a small round bottom with 15 ml dichloromethane and Pd(OAc)2 (0.491 mmol, 110.3 mg), and stirred for 1 h. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to isolate the final catalyst. Before being used for a hydrogenation reaction, these catalysts were reduced under H2 at 200 °C for 2 h.

n-Butyl tin modification of commercial catalysts
Based on a literature procedure,29 commercial 5 wt% palladium on silica powder (1.0 g) was added to a three-neck, 250 ml round bottom flask along with a magnetic stir bar. The flask necks were fitted with a septum, a condenser with an H2 gas inlet (glass gas adapter with stopcock), and a vacuum line via a stopcock. The glassware was evacuated to remove air and then refilled with H2. Tetra-n-butyltin (93%, 29.8 μL, 0.084 mmol) was measured into a small vial via micropipette, and subsequently transferred to the reaction flask through the septum using a needle and syringe, rinsing the vial with 3 × 1.5 ml portions of n-heptane into the flask. A further 10 ml of n-heptane was then added through the septum. With H2 flowing through the system, the round bottom flask was partially submerged in a 90 °C oil bath, and stirred at 600 rpm for 4 h. The solid was separated via vacuum filtration through a Buchner funnel and washed with 4 × 20 ml aliquots of n-heptane. The solid was afterwards transferred to a 4 dram vial, which was capped with a septum and dried at 90 °C for 2 h under flowing argon (delivered via needle through the septum) to give the desired catalyst.
Conclusions
We have herein described an organic thermally regenerative fuel cell system that could feasibly be used to recover waste heat on board a vehicle. A thorough liquid screening identified a candidate working fluid for the TRFC system (1-phenyl-1-propanol) that selectively dehydrogenates over a heterogeneous catalyst to give a dehydrogenated liquid (propiophenone) and H2 gas. Extensive catalyst and liquid screening studies have, so far, failed to achieve the stringent selectivity requirements originally described for the thermally regenerative fuel cell system. However, progress towards such a system has certainly been made. The dehydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propanol to propiophenone can be done with a selectivity of 99.65% over Pd/SiO2 at 200 °C. The initial rate of this reaction indicates that the TRFC could theoretically produce up to 665 A g-Pd−1 under ideal conditions. While power estimates are still low with a sensible amount of catalyst, the authors believe that further optimization with prototype testing will be achievable. Significant strides have also been made toward identifying methods to increase both the rate and selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction by modifying the identity of the phenyl ketone used, by varying the catalyst metal, support and employing surface modifications. Both steric and electronic factors are important in the choice of ketone: adding electronic withdrawing groups at the para-position of the phenyl ring and steric bulk alpha to the carbonyl group both increase the rate. Catalyst choice is also of importance for achieving the high rates and selectivities required. We have been able to show trends in rate and selectivity for heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions of neat phenyl ketones under mild conditions based on catalyst choice and ketone functionalization.
Now that these factors have been identified, future work will involve continued development and optimization of both reactions, as well as membrane and electrode assembly components. This will lead to the goal of building a prototype TRFC to test how well all of these components work together to convert engine waste heat into useable electricity.

Broader context
Severing our society's reliance on the burning of fossil fuels for energy is a major challenge moving forward. A significant amount of energy is consumed globally, and a significant portion of that energy is generated for the transportation of goods and services. In Canada, in 2009, transport trucks travelled over 2.8 million kilometers, burning over 8.7 million liters of diesel and gasoline and producing over 17.3 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide [Statistics Canada]. The proposed thermally regenerative fuel cell system could remove the requirement for the internal combustion engine to generate electricity for various vehicle components (via the alternator), resulting in an increased fuel efficiency of such vehicles. Even modest improvements to long-haul trucks' fuel efficiencies, as would be expected from this system, could reduce the global environmental impact of such activities dramatically. This is a unique application of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, exploiting the advantages of the technology without expressed concern for obstacles such as the volumetric and gravimetric storage densities of the hydrogen carrier. The system requires only catalytic amounts of H2 to convert waste heat energy into work in the form of electrical energy.
