    , Accepted 28th April 2022First published on 28th April 2022AbstractBall milling Knoevenagel condensation reactions of dialdehyde aromatic derivatives and methylene-activated derivatives have been conducted in air and solvent-free systems with ammonium acetate as the catalyst to obtain a series of nonfullerene small molecular acceptors. Organic solar cells based on the fully non-fused ring acceptor SMA-8 showed a power conversion efficiency of 10.02%.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have developed rapidly in recent years thanks to the smart molecular design and device optimization.1 To promote the commercial application of OSCs, low synthetic complexity with environmentally benign characters for active organic semiconductors is an inescapable issue.2
Lots of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF-SMAs) have been developed for high-performance OSCs.3–7 They generally possess acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type structure characteristics.3–7 The key and last synthetic step for their synthesis is the typical Knoevenagel condensation reaction with essential base catalysts in solutions. Chlorinated compounds (e.g. chloroform) are commonly used solvents and organic bases (e.g. pyridine) are commonly used catalysts.3–7 However, the use of these solvents and catalysts is contrary to the requirements of green synthetic chemistry. Therefore, we expect to find a way to solve this problem.
Mechanochemistry is regarded as a promising green approach in chemistry and materials science.8 It can be performed in solvent-free systems or minimize the use of toxic and volatile organic solvents. Ball milling synthesis is a representative mechano-chemical synthesis method.9 Ball milling has shown great potential in the functionalization of some aromatic compounds10,11 and solid-state polymerization.12,13 However, to our knowledge, this green method has not been applied to the synthesis of NF-SMAs.
In this work, we report the mechanochemical synthesis of NF-SMAs in air and solvent-free systems with inorganic bases as catalysts. The ball milling Knoevenagel condensation reactions of a series of dialdehyde aromatic derivatives and methylene-activated derivatives were investigated. The Knoevenagel products, NF-SMAs, could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields under the optimized conditions. The results show that ball milling Knoevenagel condensation is an efficient method for obtaining NF-SMAs by a greener approach.
Initially, compounds A1 and B1 were chosen as the model substrates. Compound A1 was synthesized via a direct arylation reaction between thiophene-2-carbaldehyde and 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene with a yield of 73.4%. Compound B1 was prepared according to the literature method.14 Then, we investigated the ball milling Knoevenagel condensation reactions of compounds A1 and B1 under air at room temperature. All the reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). As shown in Table 1, a series of parameters, including the base catalyst, material mole ratio, ball milling speed, size, and the number of balls were employed to optimize this procedure. The ball milling speed (900, 720, and 540 rpm) was evaluated (Table 1, entries 1–3). The highest yield (60.4%) was gained at 720 rpm. Subsequently, the size and number of balls were examined (entries 2, 4, and 5). The results showed that the ball milling reaction with 50 stainless steel balls (6 mm diameter) was favorable. After selecting the operating ball milling speed, size and number of balls, the effect of the base catalyst on this reaction was evaluated (entries 2 and 6–8). The best results were observed when employing CH3COONH4 as the base catalyst. Remarkably, the material mole ratios of all reactions are not uniform. To allow the reactions to proceed efficiently, compound B1 and bases were supplemented according to the reaction process. The detailed information is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Under the optimal reaction conditions, different dialdehyde aromatic derivatives and methylene-activated derivatives were employed to synthesize various nonfullerene small molecular acceptors. As shown in Scheme 1, the analogous acceptors were obtained in yields of 31.0–98.9%, confirming the universal application of ball milling Knoevenagel condensation. The different methylene-activated derivatives (B2–B4) were chosen to react with compound A1, thereby obtaining acceptors SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4, respectively. It should be noted that SMA-4 was obtained with a low yield (31.0%) and the reaction was assisted by thermal preservation processes (the details are shown in the ESI†). This may be attributed to the relatively weak reactivity of the methylene of B4. Similarly, the acceptors SMA-6 and SMA-7 with the same terminal structure were afforded in low yields. However, B3 was, respectively, employed to react with A1 and A2 to afford SMA-3 and SMA-5 with high yields (86.2% and 98.9%, respectively). SMA-1–SMA-4 are simple fluorene-based acceptors. SMA-5–SMA-7 are typical indacenodithiophene fused-ring acceptors. A type of fully non-fused acceptors based on thiophene and alkoxyl-phenyl units have been considered as promising acceptors in recent years.15 Thus, we develop three new fully non-fused acceptors SMA-8, SMA-9 and SMA-10 by ball milling Knoevenagel condensation. The application of the ball milling protocol to A4 and B5, A4 and B6, and A4 and B7 afforded the expected SMA-8, SMA-9 and SMA-10 in 75.0%, 73.4% and 66.0% yields, respectively. It has to be noted that these reactions were also assisted by thermal preservation processes. The reason may be attributed to the relatively weak reactivity of the dialdehyde of A4. We synthesized the intermediates A1 and A4via atom-economical direct arylation (see the ESI†). Therefore, a greener route was developed for the synthesis of nonfullerene small molecular acceptors in this work.
 Scheme 1  Mechanochemical synthesis of small molecular acceptors. 
All the acceptors display good solubility in common organic solvents (chloroform, chlorobenzene, 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran, etc.). The optical properties of these acceptors in chloroform solutions and as thin films were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, the spectra are shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the data are collected in Table S2 (ESI†), and all absorption curves in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1. All these materials possess acceptor–donor–acceptor conjugated skeletons, resulting in distinct intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption peaks in the visible light region. The strengthening of the electron-withdrawing ability of the end groups increases the ICT between the donor and acceptor moieties, as well as π–π stacking between the molecular backbones of these materials. The thin films of new acceptors SMA-8, SMA-9 and SMA-10 can display intense absorption in the near infrared light region. Due to stronger aggregation in the solid state, the thin film absorption of these acceptors showed significant redshift compared to their solution absorption. Typically, the maximum absorption peak of the SMA-8 thin film was shifted by 116 nm, compared with that of its solution, resulting in strong absorption in the near-infrared light region, which is beneficial for solar photon harvesting. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements were also carried out to characterize molecular aggregation of the thin films of SMA-8, SMA-9 and SMA-10. All thin films show 100 distinct peaks, indicating that they possess strong lamellar stacking (Fig. S24–26, ESI†). The electrochemical characteristics and energy levels of these acceptors were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms are displayed in Fig. S17 (ESI†) and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The new acceptors SMA-8, SMA-9 and SMA-10 possessed suitable LUMO and HOMO energy levels to match with the state-of-the-art donor materials.16

To verify the potential applicability of these acceptors, we chose SMA-8 as a representative active-layer photovoltaic acceptor material and constructed the corresponding bulk heterojunction solar cells (Fig. 3b and ESI†). The pairing donors, weight ratios of the donor and acceptor, solvent additive and device configuration were optimized. Detailed information is shown in the ESI† (Table S3–S6). A considerable PCE of 10.02% was achieved in an optimized PM6:SMA-8 solar cell (Fig. 3a), and the Jsc integrated from the corresponding EQE spectrum was 16.94 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a, inset), which agrees well with the measured Jsc from an AM 1.5G solar simulator. According to the synthetic cost calculation model reported in the literature,17 we also calculated the synthetic cost of SMA-8 (see Table S7, ESI†). As shown in Table S8 (ESI†), the synthetic cost of SMA-8 is relatively low compared to those of some famous fused-ring acceptors (see Fig. S28, ESI†). The result indicates the promising potential of this mechanochemically synthesized non-fullerene molecular acceptor for high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic applications.

In conclusion, ten small molecular acceptor materials with various molecular structures have been successfully synthesized via solvent-free ball milling Knoevenagel condensation in air with ammonium acetate as an efficient catalyst. A new fully non-fused ring electron acceptor, SMA-8, has been developed for OSCs with a PCE of 10.02%. This method has proved to be a facile and green synthetic strategy to construct efficient and low-cost-oriented organic molecular acceptor materials. This synthetic strategy is definitely worth being employed in synthetic and applied chemistry of conjugated organic semiconductors.
