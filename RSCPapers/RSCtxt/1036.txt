    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 6th March 2013AbstractThe morphology of CeO2 nanomaterials determines their properties and synthesis of well dispersed CeO2 nanocrystals with desired morphology is thus crucial for their applications. In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of CeO2 nanocrystals with different morphologies anchored on graphene hybrid composites by a hydrothermal method. Nanorods/graphene (NRs-G), nanoparticles/graphene (NPs-G) and nanocubes/graphene (NCs-G) have been selectively synthesized by optimizing experimental conditions. These nanocrystals show different exposed crystal planes and the size or morphology of the loaded CeO2 can be controlled by the alkali concentration and reactive temperature, as well as the adding of GO or not. In addition, significant changes in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra intensity and position (energy) have been observed in the synthesized samples, which depend on the morphology and size of the loaded CeO2. These interesting phenomena can be easily rationalized by the difference of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of samples.
Introduction
Graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms that has a tight packing of honeycomb lattice and serves as the basic building block of graphitic materials, has attracted a great deal of scientific interest due to its excellent mobility of charge carriers, a large specific surface area and good electrical and thermal conduction.1–6 Depositing other materials on graphene sheets is an efficient way to construct composite materials and to improve the properties of these materials by utilizing the unique properties of graphene.7–10 Many types of metal and metal oxide have been used to anchor on graphene sheets and the resultant composites exhibit some superior properties over the bulk metal and metal oxide alone.11–13
As one of the most reactive rare earth materials, CeO2 has attracted a great deal of attention due to its extensive applications.14–16 For example, ceria nanocrystals have high oxygen-storage capacity and act as an important component in three-way catalytic converters to clear up automotive exhausts.17 Recent studies of the CeO2 system have focused on the development of robust synthetic approaches toward size/shape-controlled nanostructures (particles, cubes, rods etc.) and the investigation of their size/shape-dependent properties.18–21 For example, Yang et al. designed a new class of nanocrystal tandem catalysts formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide nanocube monolayers of about 10 nm on a silica substrate which has subsequently been used to catalyze methanol decomposition to produce CO and H2 and that achieved better reaction activity and selectivity.22 Li et al. synthesized single-crystalline CeO2 nanorods which showed an enhanced CO conversion activity.23 It is a trend to control the synthesis of various morphologic CeO2 nanocrystals and improve its performance in various application areas.
Very recently, Li et al. fabricated CeO2 nanoparticles/graphene nanocomposite and further investigated its supercapacitor performance, the nanocomposite shows a high specific capacitance and power density, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect possibly contributed from improved conductivity of CeO2 and better utilization of graphene;24 Bai et al. prepared CeO2/graphene by a simple hydrothermal method and its electrochemical properties were investigated as a possible anode material for lithium ion batteries, which shows a greater capacity for reversal and a better performance rate than a bare CeO2 electrode.25 However, either by depositing 1.4 nm CeO2 nanoparticles onto three-dimensional graphene sheets or by a hydrothermal method, those loaded CeO2 nanoparticles have poor crystallinity or have no well-shaped exposed surface, which limits their practical application. In addition, various morphologies of titanate/graphene have outstanding photocatalytic activity, and it has also been reported that TiO2 nanorods have higher performance than the usual TiO2 nanoparticles.26 Consequently, to disperse CeO2 nanocrystals with different morphologies on graphene layer as a CeO2/graphene hybrid composite could be an important way to engineer a material with unique properties.
In this article, by optimizing the experimental conditions, NRs-G, NPs-G and NCs-G of different exposed crystallographic facets have been selectively prepared by a facile hydrothermal method under altered NaOH concentrations and temperature. Furthermore, the PL properties of the samples have been studied and the origin of their difference in PL has been revealed by investigating the shape-dependent OSC behavior.
Experimental section
In our previous work, the nanocubes/graphene (NCs-G) was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal synthesis method.27 In brief, 20 mg GO was dissolved in 40 ml distilled water with ultrasonic treatment for 2 hours to form a light yellow-brown suspension. Subsequently, 1 mmol Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.1 mmol NaOH was added into the suspension under magnetic stirring. Then the mixture was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 ml), and reacted at 220 °C for 24 h in oven.
Through a series of attempts during the experiment, we thus further optimized the experimental conditions and successfully prepared the NRs-G and NPs-G. The whole synthesis follows the dissolution–recrystallization mechanism, which involves the formation of Ce(OH)3 and its conversion into CeO2 at elevated hydrothermal temperature.28 We found that the temperature and the concentration of NaOH, as well as the presence of GO have an important effect on the morphology and size of the obtained samples. With similar synthesis conditions but by changing the temperature and the NaOH concentration as that for nanocube/graphene, we obtained the NRs-G and NPs-G samples. When we injected 0.36 mol NaOH into 0.5 mg ml−1 GO aqueous solution in the autoclave and set the reactive temperature at 100 °C for 24 h, we can obtain NRs-G composite; instead, when we added 0.4 mmol NaOH and kept the temperature at 180 °C for 24 h, we can obtain the NPs-G sample. The details for the products under various experimental conditions are summarized in Table 1. In addition, all the yielded products were separated by centrifuging and washed several times with distilled water and ethanol. Finally, the obtained composites were dried in air at 50 °C for 48 h for further characterization and investigations.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the typical TEM images of as-prepared products of CeO2/graphene composites obtained under different experiment conditions. Fig. 1a is the TEM image of the as-obtained NRs-G (CNaOH = 6 mol L−1, 100 °C, 24 h), and from the picture, we can see that the loaded CeO2 nanorods have an average diameter of about 10(1) nm with the lengths in the range of 100–400 nm. Fig. 1b depicts the HRTEM image of the loaded nanorods together with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis (inset). According to the FFT pattern, two interplanar spacings of 0.273 and 0.275 nm can be observed, which are attributed to (100) and (220) planes of the nanorods, respectively. Fig. 1c exhibits the TEM image of the synthesized NPs-G (CNaOH = 0.01 mol L−1, 180 °C, 24 h) with the average size of 8.6 nm. The TEM images of the NCs-G (CNaOH = 0.01 mol L−1, 180 °C, 24 h) shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e) were also added for comparison, which shows the CeO2 nanocubes of NCs-G are only enclosed by the (200) planes.27 It should be noted here that under the same experimental conditions without adding GO only CeO2 nanosheets were produced. From the previous work, the synthesis of CeO2 nanocrystals with controllable size and morphologies via a hydrothermal method was realized by alkali concentration and reaction temperature. In our experiment, we known that the presence of well-separated individual single layer GO sheets (GOSs) is a precondition for loading CeO2 nanocrystals anchored onto their planes during the hydrothermal process, and the presence of water offers an aqueous medium (NaOH) for the formation of cerium hydroxide. Then cerium hydroxide, the precursors of hydrous CeO2 nanocrystals, were formed by the reaction of Ce(NO3)3 and NaOH, and anchored onto the surface of the GOSs by strong chemical interactions between the residual oxygen-containing functional groups on the GOSs to the nanocrystals, or by van der Waals interactions between the GOSs and the nanocrystals.30 Finally, annealing was carried out at different temperatures to convert cerium hydroxide NPs into CeO2 nanocrystals with various morphologies. Our results showed that the CeO2 nanocrystal with tunable size and morphology is then dependent on the alkali concentration, reactive temperature, as well as the presence of GO (details in Table 1). By comparing the experiments without adding GO, we can see that the synthesis of the same morphology loading on GOSs requires higher reactive temperature. This may be due to the interactions between the CeO2 and the substrates (i.e., CeO2–GO, CeO2–reaction solution), leading to the different nanocrystals growth.

Fig. 2 shows the recorded Raman spectra of NRs-G, NPs-G and NCs-G. From the spectra we can see the characteristic peaks that arise from the D and G bands of graphene and the F2g band of laden CeO2 for the three samples,29,31 which agree with our TEM observations that the CeO2 are well anchored on the GSs surface. In our previous work, remarkable blue shifts have been observed in the Raman peaks of NCs-G in comparison with GO and CeO2 nanocubes. The D and G bands of graphene were shifted from 1360 and 1604 cm−1 to 1352 and 1599 cm−1, respectively, while the F2g band of CeO2 was shifted from 464 to 457 cm−1. These significant frequency shifts of the NCs-G suggest the existence of charge transfer between CeO2 nanocubes and graphene sheets. Surprisingly, these characteristic Raman peaks of both NRs-G and NPs-G show clear red shifts compared to those of GO and CeO2 nanocubes, shifting from 464, 1360 and 1604 cm−1 to 466, 1364 and 1610 cm−1, respectively. This is different from the blue shift observed in the NCs-G. As we know, blue shift usually can be caused by the charge transfer from graphene sheets to CeO2 nanocubes, which resulted in the increase of Ce3+ concentration;27 meanwhile, the red shift can be due to the decrease of Ce3+ concentration. These points were further supported by our following XPS results (see below). In addition, the D/G intensity ratios of NRs-G (∼0.90), NPs-G (∼0.98), NCs-G (∼1.21) are clearly higher than that of the pristine GO (∼0.83), which suggests that CeO2 has a reducing effect on GO during the sample synthesis process. The NCs show the best reducing effect.

The XRD patterns of the dried NPs-G, NRs-G, pristine CeO2 nanocubes and NCs-G are shown in Fig. 3. All of them show pure cubic phase (fluorite structure, JCPDS NO. 81-0792, O5h (Fm3m) space group). The sharpness in the diffracted peaks suggests a good crystallinity of the CeO2 nanocrystals. It is worthy to note that the cubic structures of loaded CeO2 in NPs-G, NRs-G, pristine CeO2 nanocubes and loaded CeO2 in NCs-G have lattice constants of 5.346 Å, 5.348 Å, 5.370 Å and 5.401 Å, respectively, which show a gradual lattice expansion of the CeO2 nanocrystals. Such a slight difference in the lattice usually can be related to their unique size and morphology, which possibly leads to a different defect (OSC) concentration in the materials (see below).32

CeO2 is an important rare earth material that has been extensively studied for many technological applications including luminescence, fuel cells and solar cells due to its chemical stability, high oxygen storage capacity, etc.14–16 One of the most important potential applications of nanostructured rare-earth oxides is as luminescent devices.33,34 PL measurement was carried out using a photoluminescence spectra (Renishaw inVia) with 325 nm laser excitation at room temperature and the laser power is 0.15 mW. Fig. 4 shows the PL spectra of CeO2 nanocubes, NRs-G, NPs-G and NCs-G. We have reported that the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the NCs-G is more than 30 times higher than that of pristine CeO2 nanocubes.27 Being significantly different from CeO2 nanocubes anchored on graphene (NCs-G), CeO2 nanorods and CeO2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene (forming NRs-G and NPs-G) only show a weak PL intensity similar to that of pristine CeO2, suggesting no PL enhancement in the latter two cases. Furthermore, besides the difference in the PL intensity, obvious blue-shift in the PL positions have been observed in the PL spectra of NRs-G and NPs-G, while red-shift occurred in NCs-G compared to CeO2 nanocubes (Fig. 4b). These interesting phenomena could probably be rationalized by the difference of OSC of CeO2.35–37

In order to further explain the obvious difference in the PL positions and intensity for the produced composites, we have performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on all the samples. Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of pristine CeO2 nanocubes, NRs-G, NPs-G and NCs-G, and shows the presence of both Ce4+ and Ce3+ ions in these samples. Fitting these curves and calculating the area of the XPS peaks, we obtain the concentration of Ce3+ in CeO2 nanocubes, NRs-G, NPs-G and NCs-G as 9.3%, 8.7%, 8.8% and 18.2%, respectively.38 The OSC of NCs-G was about twice as much as that of pristine CeO2 nanocubes, while the OSC of NRs-G and NPs-G were almost equal or even slightly lower than that of pristine CeO2 nanocubes. The results indicate that there is strong relationship between the OSC and PL properties of our samples. Previous work shows that the blue shift of optical band gap is correlated with the decrease of Ce3+ content, which was explained by the fact that the decrease of Ce3+ concentration will eliminate some localized states within the band gap due to the OSC decrease.39 This explanation can also be used to understand our results. In detail, compared to CeO2 nanocubes, the lower OSC of the samples leads to the blue shift of the PL positions in our NRs-G and NPs-G samples, while the higher OSC in the NCs-G sample results in the red shift in the PL position and a 30-fold enhancement in the PL efficiency of the sample. The XPS results thus suggest that the OSC of the samples has a very important effect on PL, both position and efficiency.

The XPS results are also consistent with the Raman and XRD measurements. For the Raman spectra, the OSC of NRs-G and NPs-G are decreased compared to that of pristine CeO2 nanocubes, which leads to the red shift of Raman peaks; and the OSC of NCs-G is increased as compared to pristine CeO2 nanocubes, which causes the blue shift of Raman peaks (see above Raman results). From the XRD diffraction patterns, we know that the lattice constants increase from NPs-G, NRs-G, pure CeO2 nanocubes to NCs-G, with the same changing tendency as that of the OSC of these samples by XPS measurements. This can be understood by the fact that the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ can cause an increase in lattice dimensions of different size of CeO2 nanomaterials, which is consistent with previous studies.33
Conclusion
Using Ce(III) salt as the cerium source, uniform NPs-G, NRs-G and NCs-G were selectively synthesized via a hydrothermal method by tuning the NaOH concentration and the reaction temperature. The obtained CeO2 nanocrystals showed different exposed crystal planes, depending on the morphology. Besides the structure, the PL properties were also found to be morphology dependent. Compared to CeO2 nanocubes, the PL positions in NPs-G and NRs-G were blue shifted due to the lower OSC of the samples, while the PL position was red shifted and the PL efficiency achieves a 30-fold enhancement in NCs-G due to the obviously higher OSC of the samples. All the results are consistent with our Raman and XRD measurements, suggesting that the OSC of the samples has a very important effect on PL both position and efficiency. The successful synthesis of the CeO2 nanocrystals/graphene composites with controlled morphologies will be of benefit for the applications of CeO2 in related fields.
