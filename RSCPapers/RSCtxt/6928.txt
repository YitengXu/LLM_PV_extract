    , Accepted 10th May 2022First published on 10th May 2022AbstractFlexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) are essential sections for wearable and other flexible optoelectronic devices. The application of traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in flexible devices is limited by its poor mechanical stability and expensive manufacturing equipment costs. In this work, composite FTEs are achieved by combining one-dimensional silver nanowires (AgNWs) with two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (Ti3C2Tx MXene). The one and two-dimensional (1D:2D) structured composite AgNW:MXene FTE is generated under electrostatic interaction. 2D MXene nanosheets fill the voids of the AgNW networks and weld the wire–wire junctions by the effect of capillary force. The AgNW:MXene FTEs obtain superb photoelectric performance with a low sheet resistance of 10.91 Ω sq−1 and high transmittance of 82.84%. Besides, the AgNW:MXene FTEs show high mechanical robustness after 1000 bending tests at a curvature radius of 5 mm and long-term stability (60% relative humidity and 120 °C). Eventually, the AgNW:MXene FTEs are integrated into 0.1 cm2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs), exhibiting a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.22% and 16.03%, respectively. The stability and mechanical properties of the corresponding flexible devices are also improved.
1. Introduction
Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) are indispensable components for flexible photoelectric devices such as flexible displays,1,2 wearable electronics,3–5 and flexible solar cells.6–12 High-performance FTEs are required to have excellent photoelectric performance, light weight and mechanical flexibility.13,14 The superb mechanical flexibility means that the FTEs can maintain a physically continuous conductive channel to collect charge carriers even when deformed under external mechanical forces.15 Currently, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most reported transparent electrode material among rigid photoelectric devices by virtue of its excellent conductivity and transparency.16–19 However, the application of ITO in flexible devices is limited by its inherent brittleness.20,21 Hence, it is urgent to seek a high-performance ITO-free FTE for allowing the development of flexible photovoltaic devices in the future.22,23
Several candidates of ITO have been developed, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs),24–26 graphene,27–29 conductive polymers,30–33 metal grids,34,35 and metal nanowires.36–39 Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are one of the most promising potential materials for FTEs due to their low sheet resistance (Rs), high transmittance and solution processability.40–42 Moreover, the excellent ductility of AgNW networks is suitable for flexible devices. It has been reported that solution-processed AgNW electrodes fulfilled the application requirements in flexible solar cells and other optoelectronic devices through several coating methods (spin coating, spraying, Mayer rod coating, etc.).43,44 Compared with ITO electrodes, the AgNW electrodes show superior bending resistance and mechanical stability under multiple bending tests. However, the random deposition method of AgNWs causes several defects. The commercial application of AgNW FTEs requires overcoming the following challenges: (1) high roughness; (2) low adhesion with the substrate; (3) susceptiblity to oxidation; and (4) high wire–wire junction resistance.45,46
To date, various methods have been explored to resolve the above issues, including thermal annealing, embedding AgNWs into flexible substrates, and chemical welding.47–50 Additionally, metal oxide nanoparticles such as fluorine-doped zinc oxide (FZO) or Al-doped ZnO (AZO) have been investigated to modify the conductivity and surface roughness of AgNW networks.9,51 Another viable choice is conductive polymers with processability and high mechanical properties, like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).52 Besides, a successful approach to improve the performance of AgNW electrodes is integrating two-dimensional (2D) materials to provide a protective layer on top of the AgNW networks. In particular, graphene materials, including electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), are gradually being used to modify the AgNW networks.53,54 However, the poor doping stability affects the further improvement of the graphene-based device's performance.35 Recently, the newly emerging 2D transition-metal carbides (MXene) with a layered structure have attracted extensive attention. Ti3C2Tx is the most reported MXene material, in which Tx represents some surface-terminating functional group such as –O, –OH and –F, etc.55 The Ti3C2 exhibits metallic properties and semiconductor properties by tuning the surface functional groups. Thus, Ti3C2Tx is a potential material to enhance the performance of AgNW networks due to its high electrical conductivity (reaches as high as 15100 S cm−1), high carrier mobility, tunable work function and superior mechanical properties.56,57 According to previous reports, Y. Chen and L. Yang exploited a MXene and AgNW composite transparent electrode by a simple mechanical mixing method for application in flexible organic solar cells, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.30%.58,59 Nonetheless, the interface contact problem and low PCE haven’t been effectively solved.
Herein, we demonstrate a flexible ITO-free electrode with high mechanical robustness. It is a one and two-dimensional (1D:2D) composite structure that combines AgNW and Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. The flexible composite transparent electrode is defined as AgNW:MXene FTEs. The MXene nanosheets as a 2D conductive layer not only fill the voids of the AgNW networks but also weld the wire–wire junctions via the effect of capillary force. This further improves the conductivity of the electrodes by providing more continuous conductive paths. Furthermore, the MXene nanosheets with oxygen-containing functional groups show a strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the PET substrate that can strengthen the adhesion with the substrate. Simultaneously, the Rs and roughness of the AgNW FTEs are dramatically decreased. The Rs of the optimized AgNW:MXene FTE drops to 10.91 Ω sq−1 and the transmittance increases up to 82.84% at 550 nm. Meanwhile, the AgNW:MXene FTEs exhibit excellent mechanical and long-term stability. Ultimately, the 0.1 cm2 flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on the optimized AgNW:MXene FTEs achieve a high PCE of 20.22% and 16.03%, respectively. The AgNW:MXene FTEs provide a novel strategy to replace ITO electrodes for the development of flexible optoelectronic devices in the future.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication of AgNW:MXene FTEs
MXenes are a new series of 2D materials with a layered structure that possess a unique metallic property and semiconductor property. Due to the high electrical conductivity, and tunable work function, MXenes can be developed as conductive nanomaterials and applied in flexible devices.55 Here, we select the typical MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as a modification layer and the schematic of Ti3C2Tx is depicted in Fig. 1. The Ti3C2Tx MXene is synthesized via chemical liquid phase etching,60 and the details are shown in the Experimental Section. The morphology and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ti3C2Tx MXene are shown in Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†). Both the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRD confirmed the successful synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene. The fabrication process of the AgNW:MXene composite FTE is shown in Fig. 1. The 1D AgNWs are deposited on the hydrophilic PET substrate to form a preliminary AgNW conductive network. Then, the crossing junctions and the broken junctions in the AgNWs are welded by combining MXene nanosheets.

2.2 Photoelectric performance of AgNW:MXene FTEs
Electrical conductivity and transmittance are significant parameters for high-performance FTEs. Generally, the reduction of Rs is acquired from sacrificing the transmittance of the transparent electrodes. In order to objectively evaluate the performance of the FTEs, the features (optics and electricity) are determined using the equation:24  where T(λ) represents the transmittance of the FTEs at a wavelength of 550 nm, which is the average wavelength of visible light and the most sensitive wavelength for human eyes. σOp(λ) and σDC are the optical conductivity and direct-current conductivity of the film, respectively, and Rs is the sheet resistance of the FTEs. Here, the ratio of σDC/σOp(λ) is defined as the Figure of merit (FoM). Based on the expression, a higher FoM value of FTEs indicates a more desirable photoelectric performance.
During the spin-coating process of the AgNW FTEs, the concentration and spin-coating speed are key parameters determining the quality of the FTEs. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the Rs and transmittance spectra of AgNW FTEs with different AgNW concentrations, and the corresponding photoelectric performance parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The Rs and transmittance (550 nm) (T550nm) of AgNW FTEs decrease with the increase of the AgNW concentration. However, the improved conductivity by the denser deposition of AgNWs is at the expense of the transmittance of the FTEs. Meanwhile, we explore the optimum spin-coating speed of high-performance AgNW FTEs. The centrifugal force provided by the spin-coating speed can directly affect the photoelectric performance of AgNW FTEs. The Rs and transmittance spectra of AgNW FTEs with various spin-coating speeds are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the corresponding photoelectric performance parameters are displayed in Table S2 (ESI†). The Rs and T550nm of AgNW FTEs are gradually increased as the spin-coating speed increases, which can be attributed to the deposition of fewer AgNWs on the substrate with the increase of the spin-coating speed. After calculation by the above formula, it can be determined that the highest FoM of 149.08 is obtained from 5 mg ml−1 AgNW dispersion at a spin-coating speed of 2000 rpm. The corresponding AgNW FTEs manifest the Rs of 12.09 Ω sq−1 and the transmittance of 81.96%, respectively.
For high-performance AgNW:MXene composite FTEs, it is also essential to control the addition of MXene. The Rs and T550nm of AgNW:MXene FTEs with various concentrations of MXene are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The AgNW networks with deposition of 0.5 mg ml−1 MXene reach the highest FoM of 175.05 with Rs and T550nm of 10.91 Ω sq−1 and 82.84%, which is superior to the pristine AgNW FTEs. The corresponding detailed photoelectric performance with different concentrations of MXene is illustrated in Table 1. According to the transmittance spectra (Fig. 2(b)) of AgNW:MXene FTEs, the AgNW networks with deposition of 0.5 mg ml−1 MXene obtain a higher transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm compared to the pristine AgNW FTEs. Interestingly, the addition of MXene increases the transmittance. The thickness of the AgNWs can be thinner through the MXene nanosheets with the centrifugal force by the spin-coating process. The transmittance spectra of PET, Glass, AgNW-PET, AgNW:MXene-PET and commercial ITO-PET are shown in Fig. 2(c). Meanwhile, the illustrations (digital photographs of Glass, AgNW-Glass and AgNW:MXene-Glass) also confirm that the addition of the MXene is beneficial for the transmittance of the AgNW networks.

To verify the performance improvement of the AgNW networks after the addition of MXene, the transmittance and Rs of the pristine AgNW and AgNW:MXene FTEs (the whole area of 2.25 cm2 and length of a side is 1.5 cm) are measured, respectively. Fig. S6 (ESI†) reveals the statistical data of the Rs for the pristine AgNW FTEs and AgNW:MXene FTEs, respectively. The FoMs at each region of the pristine AgNW and AgNW:MXene FTEs are calculated and shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e). The FoM of the pristine AgNW FTEs exhibits an inhomogeneous distribution where the center is higher than its edge. It is noteworthy that the addition of MXene enhances the performance of the AgNW networks. This is attributable to the fewer AgNWs distributed on the edge of the substrate with the effect of centrifugal force by the spin-coating process. On the contrary, the FoM of AgNW:MXene FTEs is increased and the distribution is relatively homogeneous. The AgNW:MXene FTEs achieve a high FoM of 175.05, which is superior to that reported in other references (Fig. 2(f) and Table S3, ESI†).
2.3 Morphology and roughness of AgNW:MXene FTEs
In order to examine the mechanism of the improvement in AgNW:MXene FTE performance, SEM images are acquired to characterize the morphology of the pristine AgNW FTEs and the AgNW:MXene FTEs, as visualized in Fig. 3(a) and (b) and Fig. S7 (ESI†). The existence of voids and junctions can be observed in the pristine AgNW networks. Noteworthy, the addition of MXene nanosheets can effectively relieve the above issues. The MXene nanosheets as 2D conductive layers fill the voids of the AgNW networks. In this way, the AgNW:MXene FTEs show higher electrical conductivity due to the more conductive paths. In addition, both the effect of capillary force from solvent evaporation and the strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the PET substrate,9,51,61 push the MXene nanosheets closer on the crossing junction sites of the AgNWs. The MXene nanosheets weld the wire–wire junctions of the AgNWs. Thus, the high junction resistance can be effectively reduced. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the SEM image and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images of the welding structure in AgNW:MXene FTEs. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S9, ESI†) are performed to characterize the structure of the AgNW:MXene FTEs. The MXene nanosheets are observed at the AgNW junctions. These results indicate the existence of a 1D/2D composite structure in the AgNW:MXene composite FTEs.

The surface roughness is also a significant feature of the electrodes, which can determine the quality of the upper layer films. Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S10 (ESI†) show atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of pristine AgNW FTEs and AgNW:MXene FTEs. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of AgNW:MXene FTEs is 13.6 nm, which is lower than that of the pristine AgNW FTEs (RMS is 19.2 nm). Besides, the welding structures of the crossing junction and broken junction are observed in Fig. 3(d). This corresponds to the results from the TEM images and SEM images.
2.4 Mechanical and long-term stability of AgNW:MXene FTEs
According to previous literature reports, FTEs are required to maintain a continuous conductive path to collect charge even under external mechanical forces.15 Thus, the mechanical endurance of FTEs is important for flexible devices. The surface Young's modulus of the PET/AgNW:MXene is 0.78 GPa, whereas the values of PET/ITO and PET/AgNW are up to 0.96 and 1.15 GPa, respectively. Based on Young's modulus and other mechanical properties of FTEs (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†), a finite-element simulation is performed, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Compared with the ITO and AgNW FTE, the AgNW:MXene FTE suffers less stress from the bending process. Therefore, the AgNW:MXene FTE can effectively release the stress under narrow bending. To verify the mechanical stability, the FTEs are implemented by bending tests with several curvature radii (10, 7.5, 6.0, 5.0 and 2.5 mm) (Fig. 4(b)). Expectedly, the Rs of commercial ITO-PET is a sharp 180% at a curvature radius of 2.5 mm and loses its original conductivity ability. The Rs of AgNW:MXene FTEs show minor changes at the above curvature radii, which is analogous to the result of the pristine AgNW FTEs. Similar results are observed after a 1000-bending test at a curvature radius of 5 mm, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain 85% of the initial conductivity, which is superior to the pristine AgNW networks. Moreover, the existence of wrinkles on the MXene nanosheets can be seen after bending. The MXene nanosheets act as a buffer layer and can effectively release the stress in the composite FTE. Meanwhile, the structure change of AgNW:MXene FTE before and after the bending tests is tiny (Fig. 4(e) and (f)). On the contrary, large cracks (Fig. S11, ESI†) are observed on the ITO-PET while under the external force bending tests. The cracks interrupt the conductive pathways and block the charge transfer. In addition, the long-term stability of AgNW:MXene FTEs is monitored under an ambient of 60% relative humidity and temperature of 120 °C for 240 h, as illustrated in Fig. 4(g). It is evident that the Rs of commercial ITO-PET shows a gradually increasing trend over time, while the AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain almost 80% of the original Rs after 240 h. Meanwhile, the AgNW:MXene FTEs exhibit superior long-term stability compared to the pristine AgNW FTEs. Hence, it is demonstrated that the AgNW:MXene FTEs with superior conductivity and mechanical stability can replace the ITO-PET in flexible devices.

2.5 Photovoltaic performance of flexible PSCs and OPVs upon the optimized AgNW:MXene FTEs
For high-performance optoelectronic devices, except for excellent conductivity and bending resistance, another vital factor is the match of the work function between the electrodes and the upper layer film. MXene can adjust the work function of AgNW networks by its special surface functional groups. The work function of the FTE is measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The secondary electron cutoff edge (SE cutoff) and Fermi edge (Fermi level) of the AgNW:MXene FTE are 19.14 eV and 2.73 eV, respectively. The photon energy of the excitation source (helium) He I is 21.2 eV. The work function of AgNW:MXene is calculated to be 4.81 eV, which is in the range normally required for optoelectronic devices. Besides, Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the work function of different electrodes.62
To validate the charge collection capability of the AgNW:MXene FTEs, flexible perovskite solar cells with an inverted configuration of PET/AgNW:MXene/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The detailed fabrication procedure is provided in the Experimental Section. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5(b), which are measured under one standard sun by a solar simulator with an Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Based on the AgNW:MXene FTEs, we achieve a high PCE of 20.22% for the 0.1 cm2 flexible PSCs with a short-current density (Jsc) of 25.16 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.52%. It has been reported in the literature that the termination groups of Ti3C2Tx can retard the crystallization rate and enhance the light absorption of perovskite films, thereby improving the optoelectronic device performance.63,64 There is an evident improvement of PCE from 18.71% (based on pristine AgNW FTEs) to 20.22% (based on AgNW:MXene FTEs). The PSCs based on commercial ITO-PET (as a reference) show a PCE of 20.04%. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Moreover, the EQE spectra of these devices are displayed in Fig. 5(c). The integrated currents calculated over the EQE spectra are in good agreement with the J–V curves.65

In addition, to investigate the mechanical stability, the efficiency variations of flexible PSCs are measured at 500 bending cycles with various curvature radii (Fig. 5(d)). The normalized PCE for the PSCs with ITO-PET shows an expected reduction due to the poor mechanical stability of ITO. The PSCs based on ITO-PET decrease to 16% of the original PCE at a bending radius of 1 mm, while the flexible PSCs with AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain 87% of the initial PCE. Moreover, the normalized PCE for the corresponding devices with different bending cycles at a bending radius of 4 mm is measured, as shown in Fig. 5(e). After 1000 bending cycles, the normalized averaged PCE of the flexible PSCs with AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain 90% of the initial PCE, while the PSCs with ITO-PET only retain 17% of the original PCE. To further explain the mechanism of high-performance flexible PSCs with AgNW:MXene FTEs, the finite-element simulation of flexible PSCs with different FTE under bending is performed, as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Compared with the devices based on ITO and AgNW FTE, the stress of PSCs based on a AgNW:MXene layer can be effectively released. Hence, the flexible PSCs with the AgNW:MXene FTE exhibit superior performance under external mechanical forces.
Flexible organic photovoltaics with an inverted structure of PET/AgNW:MXene/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:BTP-eC9/PDINO/Al are fabricated to prove the potential application of AgNW:MXene FTEs (Fig. 6(a)). The detailed fabrication procedure is provided in the Experimental Section. The chemical structures of the polymer donor PM6 and the small molecular acceptor BTP-eC9 are shown in Fig. 6(a). The J–V curves are displayed and summarized in Fig. 6(b) and Table 3. The PCE of the 0.1 cm2 OPVs is enhanced from 14.23% (based on pristine AgNW FTE) to 16.03% (based on AgNW:MXene FTE) with a Jsc of 25.65 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.85 V and FF of 73.61%. Surprisingly, the performance of the device based on the AgNW:MXene FTE is superior to that of the conventional ITO-based OPV, showing a PCE of 15.48%, Jsc of 25.25 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.85 V, and FF of 72.31%. The Jsc values corresponding to the PCE are consistent with those integrated by the EQE spectra (Fig. 6(c)). Furthermore, the OPVs based on AgNW:MXene FTEs exhibit excellent mechanical stability after 500 bending cycles with various curvature radii (Fig. 6(d)). The flexible OPVs with AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain 89% of the initial PCE at a bending radius of 1 mm, while the OPVs with ITO-PET only retain 29% of the original PCE. Besides, the normalized PCE for flexible devices with different bending cycles at a radius of 4 mm is measured, as displayed in Fig. 6(e). The optimized devices with AgNW:MXene FTEs maintain 91% of the original PCE; however, the OPVs based on ITO-PET only retain 19% after 1000 cycles. The finite-element simulation of flexible OPVs based on different FTEs is shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The OPV with the AgNW:MXene FTE shows better mechanical stability than that with ITO and AgNWs.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, an ITO-free flexible 1D:2D structure electrode is designed that optimizes 1D AgNW electrodes by integrating 2D MXene. The AgNW:MXene FTEs are formed through electrostatic interaction to replace traditional ITO electrodes in flexible devices. The voids and wire–wire junctions generated by the random deposition of AgNWs are modified by MXene nanosheets under the capillary force. Thereby, it provides continuous conductive paths to ensure excellent electrical conductivity with Rs of 10.91 Ω sq−1 and considerable T550nm of 82.84%. Moreover, based on the MXene surface oxygen-containing functional groups, the adhesion to the substrate is strengthened through the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between MXene and the PET substrate. Besides, the AgNW:MXene FTEs exhibit high mechanical robustness and long-term stability under an ambient of 60% relative humidity and 120 °C for 240 h. Conclusively, the PCEs of the optimized flexible PSCs (0.1 cm2) and OPVs (0.1 cm2) based on AgNW:MXene FTEs reach up to 20.22% and 16.03%, and they maintain 90% and 91% of the original PCE after 1000 bending cycles at a radius of 4 mm, respectively. The novel AgNW:MXene FTEs are expected to promote the development of high-efficiency flexible optoelectronic devices in the future by replacing ITO-PET.
