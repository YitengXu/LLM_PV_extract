    , Accepted 15th January 2016First published on 27th January 2016AbstractThe design of a photosensitizer characteristic of both excellent absorption of infrared solar photons and high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) should be a momentous stride towards the further performance improvement of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this paper, by using a binary twisting electron-donor triphenylamine-phenanthrocarbazole (TPA-PC) we first demonstrate that the transformation of the electron-acceptor from twisting 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (BTBA) to planar 4-((7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzoic acid (EBTEBA) can significantly stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of an organic dye but does not lower EQEs. Also we show that the application of the electron-donor 11-(2-hexyldecyl)-8-(4-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)phenyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole (P-TCC) with a planar electronic skeleton, featuring a comparable electron-releasing strength to the twisting counterpart TPA-PC, can enhance the absorption of infrared solar photons, without reducing the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO. Dye C288 with P-TCC as the electron-donor and EBTEBA as the electron-acceptor retains an almost planar electronic skeleton and a high power conversion efficiency of 12%. Stationary and femtosecond dynamic photoluminescence (PL) measurements have suggested cascade excited state relaxations and multiple-state electron injections at the titania/dye interface, in collaboration with theoretical calculations on the excited state conformations.

Broader context
The design of a photosensitizing organic dye, possessing an excellent power for absorbing low-energy infrared photons in the solar emission spectrum and also exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies, should be the first step for the future efficiency improvement of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this work, we have employed a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon electron-donor and a planar electron-acceptor EBTEBA to construct a low energy-gap organic dye featuring a reduced Stokes shift, showing an excellent PCE under AM1.5G conditions. One of the key findings presented here is that it is not so necessary to have a twisting between BT and BA.

Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology1 has been attracting a large amount of research interest in view of the extreme potential of converting solar and artificial light to electricity at low cost, and has recently achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of 14.5% measured under the simulated air mass global (AM1.5G) sunlight.2 This glorious accomplishment embodies over 10 years intense studies on metal-free organic dyes,3–7 single-electron redox shuttles,8–10 molecular-scale interface engineering,11,12 and device physics.13–15 Predictably, the development of more powerful metal-free organic dyes could well address the economic efficiency of a DSC, primarily on account of there being copious raw materials and versatile synthetic methodologies. To further increase the PCE of a DSC, the realization of harvesting photons in the infrared region of the solar emission spectrum will be of paramount importance in the future explorations, mainly via narrowing the optical energy gap of a dye molecule.16–20 However, a reduction of the HOMO/LUMO energy gap of a dye molecule is certainly concomitant with either a stabilized LUMO energy level or a destabilized HOMO energy level, or even both. These energetic changes are very much possible to exert unfavorable influences on the yields of generating long-lived charge carriers and thus lower EQEs.13,14 In addition, the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of a DSC is notably dominated by the thickness and pinhole defect of self-organized dye layers, lying spatially at the boundary of electron-transporting titania and hole-transporting redox electrolyte.21–25
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing an intrinsically high level of π-conjugation and charge delocalization have been conceded as an exclusive class of organic optoelectronic materials.26–28 In this context, N-annulated perylene (1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, PC) has been recently utilized as the electron-releasing moiety in metal-free organic dyes for DSCs.29 In our previous paper,30 we synthesized a structurally simple donor–acceptor (D–A) dye, C266 (Fig. 1), characteristic of a twisting electron-donor TPA-PC in conjunction with the widely used electron-acceptor cyanoacrylic acid (CA), which achieved a fairly good PCE of 9.0%. We herein will first switch the electron-acceptor from CA to BTBA for dye C286 (Fig. 1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have suggested that BTBA is a twisting electron-acceptor, and a large dihedral angle between PC and BTBA occurs. Thereby for the first time we use a planar electron-acceptor EBTEBA, which can be coupled with TPA-PC to construct C287 (Fig. 1), with a negligible twisting at the donor–acceptor junction. In the third step, TPA-PC will be taken over with P-TCC with a planar electronic skeleton, to generate dye C288 (Fig. 1). Note that P-TCC was reported in our recent work29 only as an intermediate for the construction of a larger PAH unit, but not used as an electron-donor for a D–A dye.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of D–A dyes C286 and C287 featuring the twisting BTBA (green) and planar EBTEBA (red) electron-acceptors, in combination with a TPA-PC (black) electron-donor. Dye C288 with the same electron-acceptor as C287 is characteristic of P-TCC (blue) with a planar electronic skeleton exhibiting an enhanced photovoltaic performance. Note that photochemically inactive auxiliary segments such as 2-hexyldecyloxy, 2-hexyldecyl, and hexylphenyl in P-TCC are employed to principally abate the strong intermolecular π–π stacking. The previously reported dye C266 with electron-donor TPA-PC and electron-acceptor CA (magenta) is also included. The bond marked with cyan, between electron-donors and electron-acceptors, can be imaged to be formed via oxidative coupling of electron-rich and electron-deficient entities. 
With these three new dyes, we will make a detailed analysis of the impacts of planar electronic skeletons upon the energy level, energy gap, light absorption, and PL of dye molecules by joint experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, their photovoltaic performance in DSCs with a bilayer titania film and a tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-bpy) electrolyte will be accessed by measuring EQEs and current–voltage (J–V) curves, and further scrutinized by charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements. Also, femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements will be carried out to unlock the ultrafast excited-state relaxation and electron injection at the titania/dye interface.
Results and discussion
To figure out the impacts of electron-acceptors EBTEBA vs. BTBA and electron-donors P-TCC vs. TPA-PC on energy levels and energy gaps of dye molecules, we first measured cyclic voltammograms of dye molecules with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. From the curves presented in Fig. 2a, we could approximately determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Table 1) using the equation E = −4.88 − eEonset,(1)wherein Eonset denotes the onset oxidation or reduction potential of a dye molecule at the ground-state. It turns out that with respect to C286 with BTBA as the electron-acceptor, the EBTEBA derived dye C287 possesses a 0.20 eV stabilized LUMO energy level and a 0.03 eV stabilized HOMO energy level (Table 1), and is thereby characteristic of a narrower LUMO/HOMO energy gap. As a consequence, it appears sensible for us to observe an 87 nm red-shift of the maximum absorption wavelength (λMEASABS,MAX) for C287 from Fig. 2b, in contrast to its reference dye C286. In addition, the replacement of electron-acceptor BTBA with EBTBA also results in an enlarged maximum molar absorption coefficient (εMEASMAX), i.e. 44.2 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for C287 compared to that of 35.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for C286. Furthermore, it is found that the electron-donor adjustment from TPA-PC to P-TCC retains the same LUMO energy level of −3.36 eV, but induces a 0.02 eV stabilized HOMO energy level, producing a slightly wider LUMO/HOMO energy gap. However, the P-TCC based dye C288 is counterintuitively characteristic of a red-shifted λMEASABS,MAX at 577 nm compared to that of 539 nm for its reference C287. Notably, dye C288 with an almost planar electronic skeleton owns the highest εMEASMAX of 65.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1, amongst the herein studied three D–A dyes.

a Energy levels of LUMO and HOMO (ECVL and ECVH) versus vacuum were extracted from CVs displayed in Fig. 2a. H and L stand for HOMO and LUMO.

As illustrated in Fig. 2c and Table 1, our DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory can nicely reproduce the relative alignments of electronic energy levels of these three dyes. Moreover, we included the DFT results on electron-acceptors (BTBA and EBTEBA) and electron-donors (TPA-PC and P-TCC) in Fig. 2c for a straightforward discernment on the energetically genetic correlations of D–A dye molecules with their electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing blocks. As discovered in our previous work,31 dyes C286, C287, and C288 are also endowed with almost comparable HOMO energy levels to their related electron-donors (TPA-PC and P-TCC), and similar LUMO energy levels to electron-acceptors (BTBA and EBTEBA).
Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for a dye molecule in THF have afforded maximum absorption wavelengths (λTD-MPW1KABS,MAX), being 492 nm for C286, 570 nm for C287, and 600 nm for C288. The relative trend of λTD-MPW1KABS,MAX is well consistent with our experimental results on λMEASABS,MAX. The S0 → Svert1 electronic transitions for these three dyes stem mainly from HOMO to LUMO, carrying a lively intramolecular charge-transfer character as easily inferred from contour plots of molecular orbitals displayed in Fig. 2d. The superficial inconsistency between the LUMO/HOMO energy gap (ΔEB3LYPL/H, Fig. 2c) and λTD-MPW1KABS,MAX for C287 and C288 can be better inspected by resorting to more detailed transition assignments tabulated in Table S1, ESI.† On the whole, the excitation from HOMO to LUMO is evidently weighted for C288 in contrast to C287.
We further measured the steady PL spectra of diluted solutions of dye molecules in THF (Fig. 2b) and deduced large values of Stokes shift of 7.9 × 103 cm−1 (0.98 eV) for C286, 5.1 × 103 cm−1 (0.63 eV) for C287, and 4.3 × 103 cm−1 (0.53 eV) for C288. The large energy losses following vertical excitation have somehow implied the existence of excited state relaxations to a large extent, including vibrational, solvent, and torsional relaxations.32–35 To gain some insights into conformational relaxation, the equilibrium molecular geometries in the first excited singlet states (Seq1) were optimized by resorting to the TDDFT calculations at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level. Note from Table 1 that for these three dye molecules, the relative tendencies of theoretical maximum PL wavelengths (λTD-MPW1KPL,MAX) and Stokes shifts (ΔTD-MPW1K) are in good accord with the experimental results. It can be found that the usage of more planar electronic skeletons can abate Stocks shifts. Recall that the vertically excited first singlet state Svert1 has the same geometry as S0 according to the Frank–Condon principle. Thereby, conformational changes in the excited states could be identified by comparing the optimized geometries of S0 and Seq1. Prominent variations of dihedral angles are shown in Fig. 3. A noticeable planarization can be perceived for the electronic backbones of these three dyes, which has also been noted for other organic conjugated materials.34

To improve the computational efficiency, the large aliphatic chains were replaced with ethyl. On the side of a molecular skeleton are displayed dihedral angles, which are evidently distinct at the Svert1 and Seq1 states. Aromatic rings are filled with various colors for clarity of presentation. 
We also recorded time-resolved PL traces of dye molecules in THF (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) by the use of the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique (ESI†). The PL intensities (IPL) at various wavelengths for each dye can be globally fitted using four time constants listed in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†), via a four-exponential function convoluted with a Gaussian instrument response function IRF, (2)wherein t, Ai, and τi represent the delay time, fractional amplitude, and lifetime. The values of average lifetime () were determined using  (Ai > 0) and are compiled in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). It can be clearly seen from Fig. S4 (ESI†) that along with the red-shifting of PL wavelengths, there is a gradual increase of , up to three orders of magnitude (ESI†). This situation could be interpreted by a picture that the light excitation promotes the dye molecules via intramolecular charge transfer to a non-equilibrium vertically excited state, i.e. the Franck–Condon excited state, which undergoes stepwise vibrational and torsional relaxations to form an equilibrium excited state. This is highly possible in view of the significant conformational variations of S0 and Seq1 (Fig. 3) as revealed by DFT and TDDFT calculations, and is also supported by the slow arising signals (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) and negative amplitudes of the short time constants in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†) at the long PL wavelengths.
In addition, we examined the PL quantum yields of these three dyes in THF, being 7.1% for C286, 2.7% for C287, and 3.9% for C288, indicative of significant radiationless deactivation of excited states of these intramolecular charge-transfer dyes. The order of PL quantum yields (C286 > C288 > C287) could be roughly elucidated in terms of the energy gap law, stating that the value of the rate constant for radiationless transitions decreases with the size of the energy gap between the initial and final electronic states involved.
Next, dye molecules dissolved in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and ethanol were self-organized onto a bilayer titania film sintered on FTO for the fabrication of DSCs. The manufacture details are outlined in the Experimental section. EQEs were first examined at short-circuit, using monochromatic lights at a wavelength interval of 10 nm. As presented in Fig. 4a, dyes C287 and C288 exhibit the same maximal EQE of 92% as C286, proposing that the yields of electron injection from their excited states to titania, ϕEI, may not decline, albeit there is a reduction of driving energy, which is offered by transforming the electron-acceptor from BTBA to EBTEBA. Likewise, ∼50 nm and ∼67 nm red-shifted onset wavelengths of photocurrent response can be effortlessly discerned for C287 and C288, respectively, in stark contrast to C286. This scenario is in general consistent with wavelength dependent light-harvesting yields (ϕLH) as illustrated by Fig. 4b, for dye-grafted, 8.0 μm-thick mesoporous titania films. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves further measured under an irradiance of simulated AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4c and the averaged photovoltaic parameters of 4 cells are tabulated in Table 2.

EQESC was derived from wavelength integration of the product of the measured EQEs at the short-circuit and the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03). Also, there was a nearly linear dependence of photocurrent on irradiance (Fig. S6, ESI) and thereby the validity of photovoltaic parameters could be assessed by analyzing the calculated JEQESC and experimental JSC values.

Dye C286 has a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.54 mA cm−2, a VOC of 843 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.7%, generating a PCE of 9.0%. In good agreement with the integrals of EQEs over the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03), dye C287 bears an upgraded JSC of 17.70 mA cm−2, affording a ∼17% enlarged PCE of 10.5%, in spite of a 33 mV diminished VOC of 810 mV and a slightly declined FF of 73.1%. Moreover, dye C288 exhibits the highest JSC of 19.65 mA cm−2, the identical VOC of 843 mV to that of C286, yielding an impressive PCE of 12.0%, albeit the smallest FF of 72.5%. To have a clear understanding of the efficiency status of these PAH dyes compared to the traditional ruthenium dyes such as N719, N749, Z907, and C106, we also included their cell parameters in Table 2 for comparison.

J–V curves of cells with C286, C287, and C288 were also recorded under different irradiances of attenuated AM1.5G lights with a suite of neutral metal meshes. As Fig. 4d shows, the recorded VOC is plotted as a logarithmic function of JSC. From the three nearly parallel fitting lines (green, blue, and red) one could find that for all three cells, there is ∼100 mV escalated VOC along with one order of magnitude increase of JSC. In addition, at a given JSC dye C287 has a ∼35–40 mV reduced VOC in comparison with C288 and C286.
To gain some insights into the interfacial energetic and kinetic origins underlying the VOC variation,21,36 we then carried out CE and TPD measurements.37,38 As Fig. 4e illustrates, a very similar profile of charges extracted from titania (QCE) against VOC suggests that the conduction-band (CB) edge of titania as well as the distribution of trap states under CB should not be adjusted upon the change of dye molecules. A larger number of charges stored in titania is closely associated with a higher VOC. However at a certain QCE, the half lifetimes (tTPD1/2) of electrons in the CB of titania as well as traps below the CB vary in the order C286 ≅ C288 > C287 (Fig. 4f), clarifying the change of VOC in the same manner. The trend of electron lifetimes (Fig. S5, ESI†) derived from impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements (ESI†), is well consistent with that derived from TPD.
Loading amounts (cm) of dye molecules on our mesoporous titania film were also measured by visible spectrometry, being 2.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C286 and 1.8 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C287. Although C287 possesses a larger molecular length and a similar diameter compared to C286, it seems that a smaller cm signifies a partial coverage of dye molecules on the surface of titania; thereby some cobalt(III) ions will probably penetrate into the dye layer, recombining the electrons in titania. The higher VOC of C288 with respect to C287 presented in Fig. 4d is closely correlated with elongated tTPD1/2 (Fig. 4f), seemingly as a consequence of an increased cm of 2.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1.
To unlock the electron-acceptor independent EQE height, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments were first performed at a probe wavelength of 800 nm to roughly estimate electron injection yields (ϕEI) by comparing the corresponding PL traces of dyed alumina and titania films. Assuming that electrons cannot be injected into alumina from these three organic dyes in the electronically excited-states (D*), we ascribed the dynamic PL decays (blue curves) in Fig. 5a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) to radiative and radiationless deactivation of D*. However, remarkable PL quenching (PLQ) occurs when the oxide film is changed from alumina to titania. PLQ manifests that charge photogeneration should happen at the dye/titania interfaces, where a favorable energy level offset exists. The areas under PL traces obtained via time integration of intensity signals were also displayed as green curves for alumina samples and magenta for titania in Fig. 5a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) to calculate ϕEI roughly, being 0.95 for all of these dyes. Later, we recorded static PL spectra (Fig. 5b and Fig. S8, ESI†) of dyed alumina and titania films using an ICCD camera and derived the static PL quenching yields (QYS) at different wavelengths from the following equation (3)where IPL(T,λ) and IPL(A,λ) are the PL intensities of dye-grafted titania and alumina films at a given wavelength, respectively. It is valuable to note from Fig. 5e that for all of these three dyes, the values of QYS are pretty low in the blue wing of PL spectra but increase along with red-shifting of PL wavelengths, reaching a value close to unity at the red wing of PL spectra.

The PL intensity (I) was corrected in terms of the absorbance at 482 nm and further normalized with respect to the PL maximum of the dye-grafted alumina film (Imax,a).

(f) Time constants of electron injection as a function of the PL wavelength. (g) The model of cascade excited state relaxations and multiple-state electron injections at the titania/dye interface based on femtosecond PL measurements and quantum calculations. Svert1 is the first vertical excited singlet state, Eeq is the equilibrium excited state, and CS is the charge separated state. Multiple metastable excited states between Svert1 and Eeq are represented by Eint,1,…, Eint,n. 
We further measured the femtosecond PL traces (Fig. 5c, d, and Fig. S9–S14, ESI†) at a suite of wavelengths for dye-grafted alumina and titania films. Similar to the situations in THF, all dyes grafted on alumina and titania also display wavelength-dependent average lifetimes (Fig. S15, ESI†), augmenting along with the red-shifting of PL wavelengths for over one order of magnitude (ESI†). The dynamic PL quenching yields (QYD) at discrete wavelengths were derived from equation (4)wherein (T,λ) and (A,λ) stand for the PL lifetimes of dye-grafted titania and alumina films at a given wavelength, respectively. The values of QYD integrated into Fig. 5c are in excellent agreement with QYS. We propose that the lower values of QYS and QYD of higher energy excited states with shorter PL wavelengths are very much related to their ultrafast transformations to the lower energy excited states with higher values of QYS and QYD. In addition, we also calculated time constants of electron injection (τei) using the equation (5) The values of τei at various PL wavelengths for C286, C287, and C288 are collected in Fig. 5f for comparison. For each dye, there is an evident enlargement of τei of over one order of magnitude, along with a red-shifting of PL wavelengths which is intimately associated with a decrease of the potential energy of excited state. Recalling the energy level alignment of HOMOs in Fig. 2c, one could deduce that at a given PL wavelength, the LUMOs of relaxed excited states should be aligned in the order C286 > C287 > C288. Thereby the potential energy of excited state and thus the driving energy for electron injection should decrease in the order C286 > C287 > C288, which however could not explain τei (Fig. 5f) in the order C286 > C287 > C288. It is very likely that the electronic coupling between the excited state of dye molecules and titania is enhanced by using the planar electron-acceptor EBTEBA instead of BTBA. In addition, the replacement of the electron-donor TPA-PC with P-TCC with a planar electronic skeleton may reduce the reorganization energy of electron injection and thereby lead to a smaller time constant of electron injection at a given driving energy. Overall, the lower electron injection yield (Fig. 5e) concomitant with a faster electron injection (Fig. 5f) for a higher energy excited state can be rationalized by considering the competitive relaxation of a “hot” excited state. By monitoring the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. S16, ESI†) of dye-grafted titania films at different adsorption times (ESI†), we also noted the existence of dye–dye intermolecular interaction in the dye-grafted titania film. Thereby, delocalization of excited states in the self-assembled dye layer is highly possible. The results discussed here are in general accord with the picture of cascade excited state relaxations and multiple-state electron injections at the titania/dye interface (Fig. 5g) revealed by our previous target analysis of femtosecond transient absorption spectra.39–41 It should be realized that the excited state relaxations should include both intramolecular and intermolecular processes.
Conclusions
To sum up, we have used P-TCC and EBTEBA with planar electronic skeletons to synthesize a low energy-gap organic dye featuring a reduced Stokes shift, achieving an excellent PCE of 12% under AM1.5G conditions. Our study has shown that it is not so necessary to have a twisting42 between benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and benzoic acid. The EBTEBA electron-acceptor could be employed to make other metal-free D–A dyes with a high ability of absorbing infrared solar photons and a high electron injection yield. The superior performance of P-TCC vs. TPA-PC presented here has suggested the pivotal role of designing other novel PAH segments instead of conventional electron-releasing units for an improved light absorption without a significantly destabilized HOMO energy level. Our femtosecond PL measurements and theoretical calculations on the conformations of excited states have suggested a key picture of cascade excited state relaxations including intramolecular and intermolecular processes, and multiple-state electron injections at the functional interface of titania and dye molecules, which is of fundamental importance for the future material and device development.

After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (chloroform/methanol, v/v, 20/1) on silica gel to yield a black solid as the final product C288 (388 mg, 84% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-d8) δ: 8.84–8.82 (m, 1H), 8.67–8.62 (m, 2H), 8.08 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 3H), 7.94–7.82 (m, 4H), 7.75–7.67 (m, 4H), 7.45–7.32 (m, 6H), 7.14–7.13 (m, 5H), 6.85–6.83 (m, 2H), 4.50 (br, 2H), 3.88–3.87 (m, 2H), 2.06–2.02 (m, 2H), 1.60–1.58 (m, 4H), 1.31–1.17 (m, 64H), 0.90–0.79 (m, 18H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, THF-d8) δ: 164.00, 157.12, 152.51, 152.43, 144.11, 143.55, 139.67, 139.54, 138.67, 132.82, 132.14, 130.65, 129.44, 129.03, 128.76, 128.06, 127.71, 127.62, 125.75, 125.07, 124.54, 124.21, 123.35, 122.85, 121.89, 121.59, 121.34, 120.61, 120.14, 118.68, 116.63, 116.53, 115.82, 114.43, 113.51, 113.02, 112.34, 103.08, 97.30, 93.77, 88.29, 86.16, 68.54, 56.09, 47.34, 37.56, 36.10, 33.38, 29.84, 29.67, 29.52, 29.32, 28.02, 27.92, 27.62, 27.29, 27.15, 25.00, 24.81, 24.63, 24.27, 20.55, 20.47, 11.45, 11.41.

Theoretical calculations
The Gaussian 09 software package was used for all quantum chemical calculations with a selection of the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) was picked for the simulation of solvent effects.46 The ground-state geometries were optimized by virtue of the popular B3LYP exchange–correlation functional.47 The TD-MPW1K hybrid functional,48 which includes 42% of Hartree–Fock exchange was employed for the vertical electron transition calculations and excited-state geometry optimizations.49
Fabrication of DSCs
A fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (NSG, Solar) partly screen-printed with a titania bilayer film was used as the negative electrode of DSCs. The bilayer semiconducting film was composed of a 4.6 μm-thick translucent layer of small particles (25 nm) and a 5.0 μm-thick light-scattering layer of large particles (350–450 nm). Its preparation details can be found in a previous paper.50 Dye-loading was performed by immersing a titania film into a solution of 150 μM dye in the solvent mixture of chlorobenzene/ethanol (v/v, 2/8) for C286, chlorobenzene/ethanol (v/v, 4/6) for C287, and chlorobenzene/ethanol (v/v, 4/6) for C288 overnight. A 25 μm-thick Surlyn ring was heated at 130 °C to adhere a dyed titania electrode and a gold coated FTO electrode. The internal space of a partly sealed cell was infiltrated with a cobalt electrolyte. The recipe of the Co-bpy electrolyte: 0.25 M Co(bpy)3(TFSI)2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3(TFSI)3, 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M LiTFSI in ACN. Herein, bpy and TFSI denote 2,2′-bipyridine and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, respectively.
Instrumentation
Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation in combination with a three-electrode electrolytic cell equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum gauze counter electrode, and a silver wire quasi-reference electrode. Electronic absorption measurements were performed on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. The details of TCSPC, femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion, EQE, J–V, CE, and TPD measurements have been reported in our previous papers.51–53 A black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.160 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during EQE and J–V measurements. The Global analysis of PL traces was carried out by using the free Glotaran software.54 For all samples, at least four time constants were needed to afford a satisfactory global fitting. After obtaining four time constants, we further employed the Surface Xplorer software (version 2.3) to fit every kinetic trace to yield the corresponding amplitudes.

Broader context
The design of a photosensitizing organic dye, possessing an excellent power for absorbing low-energy infrared photons in the solar emission spectrum and also exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies, should be the first step for the future efficiency improvement of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this work, we have employed a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon electron-donor and a planar electron-acceptor EBTEBA to construct a low energy-gap organic dye featuring a reduced Stokes shift, showing an excellent PCE under AM1.5G conditions. One of the key findings presented here is that it is not so necessary to have a twisting between BT and BA.


 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of D–A dyes C286 and C287 featuring the twisting BTBA (green) and planar EBTEBA (red) electron-acceptors, in combination with a TPA-PC (black) electron-donor. Dye C288 with the same electron-acceptor as C287 is characteristic of P-TCC (blue) with a planar electronic skeleton exhibiting an enhanced photovoltaic performance. Note that photochemically inactive auxiliary segments such as 2-hexyldecyloxy, 2-hexyldecyl, and hexylphenyl in P-TCC are employed to principally abate the strong intermolecular π–π stacking. The previously reported dye C266 with electron-donor TPA-PC and electron-acceptor CA (magenta) is also included. The bond marked with cyan, between electron-donors and electron-acceptors, can be imaged to be formed via oxidative coupling of electron-rich and electron-deficient entities.
