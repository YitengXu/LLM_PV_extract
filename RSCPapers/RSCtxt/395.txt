    , Accepted 6th July 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractElectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a green and convenient way to produce hydrogen with high calorific value and zero environmental pollution, but the precious metal Pt, which catalyzes its efficient operation, faces the dilemma of resource scarcity. Before finding an HER catalyst to replace platinum-based materials, morphology control engineering can achieve high-efficiency hydrogen production with a lower platinum input. Here, we used a supramolecular assembly (host: cucurbituril[7]; guest: closo-[B12H12]2−) with weak reducibility as a carrier to convert Pt4+ into ultrafine and highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (BOPs@Pt) in situ, and the supported Pt-based catalyst (BC3N@Pt) obtained after pyrolysis had the ability to very efficiently catalyze HER. BC3N@Pt exhibited excellent performance in catalyzing HER in the full pH range. Among them, the overpotentials to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the media of pH = 14, pH = 7 and pH = 1 were only 26.1 mV, 38.5 mV and 23.1 mV, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slopes were as low as 41.59 mV dec−1, 59.05 mV dec−1, and 61.07 mV dec−1, respectively. In terms of mass activity, the rate of HER driven by BC3N@Pt was at least three times than that achieved with the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that B doped on CN changes the local electronic distribution, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity. The annealing treatment converts the organic polymer into an inorganic BC3N matrix, which not only accelerates the electron transfer rate in HER, but also ensures the stability of BCN@Pt when catalyzing HER in the entire pH range.
Introduction
Today, mankind is striving to explore ways to achieve carbon neutrality. This is because the massive use of fossil fuels has severely deteriorated the environment and ecosystem, and the increasingly frequent natural disasters are a serious warning. Compared with other clean energy sources (such as wind energy, nuclear energy, and solar energy), hydrogen energy has the advantages of high calorific value, renewability, and zero pollution to the environment.1–3 Numerous application terminals have used hydrogen as a power source, such as hydrogen energy vehicles. At present, the supply of hydrogen mainly comes from the steam reforming of natural gas, which not only releases a large amount of carbon dioxide to the environment, but also causes a serious waste of non-renewable resources.4–7 The strategy of the electrochemical conversion of H2O to H2 is the green route to avoid hydrogen production using non-renewable energy sources, which involves the burning of H2, again converting it to H2O. Since only a small amount of electrical energy is needed, the electrical energy to drive the electrochemical decomposition of H2O into H2 can come from clean energy sources, such as wind energy, solar energy, and nuclear energy.8–10 Nevertheless, additional catalysts are needed to promote the efficient conversion of H2O to H2. Researchers are working hard to find electrocatalysts that can promote HER to achieve high H2 production rates under low electrical energy input. For a long time, due to their excellent catalytic activity, Pt-based materials have been regarded as exemplary catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis.11–14 Unfortunately, the scarcity of resources poses a serious threat to the widespread application of Pt-based materials.1,15 Although researchers continue to try to replace Pt-based materials with those based on non-precious metals (such as Co-based and Ni-based materials) to achieve effective HER, they have not been able to change the dominant position of Pt-based materials in HER catalysis.16–18 Specifically, Pt-based materials are currently the only commercially available HER catalysts, and their excellent catalytic activity and long-term stability compel people to endure its high cost.
Fabricating low-cost Pt-based materials to achieve a high catalytic activity in HER is a problem, which researchers are committed to solving. Generally, electrochemical reactions mainly occur on the surface of the catalyst, and thus the use of bulky Pt-based materials will cause a large number of active sites to remain idle. The development of Pt-based materials with high dispersion and small particle size can avoid the loss of active Pt sites to a certain extent.19–24 However, due to the high surface energy, the small-sized Pt nanoparticles find it difficult to maintain the ideal dispersion state for a long time and tend to aggregate in the electrochemical process, which leads to the decline in catalytic performance.25–28 In this context, the structural confinement strategy of anchoring the Pt nanoparticles (or Pt nanoclusters, single-atom Pt) on a carrier can avoid the leaching and aggregation of Pt.23 Commonly used supports include metal–organic frameworks,29 carbon materials (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, carbon cloth, and carbon paper),30–34 and foamed metals (such as foamed nickel35,36). In addition, choosing a suitable preparation method determines the dispersibility of Pt nanoparticles (or Pt nanoclusters, Pt single atoms) on the carrier. The strong reducing agent sodium borohydride used in traditional wet chemical methods can instantly convert Ptn+ into zero-valent Pt, while at the same time, it also easily causes Pt aggregation, forming large particle size.1
Here, we prepared in situ Pt nanoparticles with high dispersion and small particle size supported on supramolecular assemblies containing a weak reducing agent. Specifically, the macrocyclic molecule cucurbituril[7] (CB[7]) and 3D aromatic-like closo-[B12H12]2− can quickly form nanosheet-like supramolecular assemblies (BOPs) driven by the chaotropic effect. Pt4+ was converted into zero-valent Pt by the weak reductivity of closo-[B12H12]2−in situ and localized in the BOPs framework (BOPs@Pt). After pyrolysis, Pt nanoparticles with high dispersion and ultrafine characteristics were obtained on the BC3N matrix (named BC3N@Pt). BC3N@Pt exhibited excellent HER catalytic activity, and this performance exhibited universality in the full pH range. In the electrolytes with pH = 14, pH = 7, and pH = 1, the current density of HER driven by BC3N@Pt reached 10 mA cm−2 when the overpotentials of only 26.1 mV, 38.5 mV and 23.1 mV were provided, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slopes were as low as 41.59 mV dec−1, 59.05 mV dec−1, 61.07 mV dec−1. In addition, the HER activity of BC3N@Pt was close to 4 times that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. These represent the advancement in the preparation of supported nano-Pt via a weak reducing agent in the supramolecular assembly.
Experimental methods
Chemical and materials
[Et3NH]2[B12H12] was synthesized according to the method in the literature37 and then, ion-exchanged to obtain Cs2[B12H12] with a purity of >98%. However, during the preparation of [Et3NH]2[B12H12], a large amount of hydrogen and diborane are generated, so caution was exercised to ensure that the operating environment was well-ventilated and free of open flames. The carbon paper was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd and was subjected to ultrasonic treatment in ethanol/water for 10 min and then naturally dried for later use. Other reagents were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without further processing; all the reagents were of analytical grade. Milli-Q ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm−1) was used throughout.
Catalyst preparation

Preparation of BOPs. 
First, 1.163 g (1 mmol) CB[7] was dissolved in 200 mL ultrapure water to form a uniform solution A, and 0.407 g (1 mmol) Cs2[B12H12] was dissolved in 100 mL ultrapure water to form a uniform solution B. Then, solution B was quickly added to solution A under magnetic stirring (1000 rpm), and immediately the clear solution started becoming turbid. After stirring for 2 h, the solid was collected, washed alternately with ethanol and water three times, and then dried under a vacuum at 90 °C for 6 h. The product was named BOPs.


Preparation of BOPs@Pt. 
1.304 g BOPs were re-dispersed in 150 mL ultrapure water ultrasonically and transferred to a 500 mL round-bottomed flask placed in a constant-temperature oil bath. When the temperature approached 100 °C, 10.36 mL (19.3 mM) H2PtCl6 was added to the suspension. After the suspension changed from white to gray-black (about 5 min), the reaction was continued for 2 h. After the temperature dropped to room temperature, the solid was collected by filtration under reduced pressure and washed alternately with ethanol and water three times. Then, the filter cake was vacuum dried at 90 °C for 6 h, and BOPs@Pt was obtained.


Preparation of BC3N@Pt. 
The procedure for preparing BC3N@Pt by the pyrolysis of BOPs@Pt was as follows. In an Ar atmosphere, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 5°C min−1 and kept for 2 h, and then, the temperature was naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain BC3N@Pt.

Characterization method
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the materials were recorded on an infrared spectrometer (Thermo iS10), in the spectral range from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1, in which a high-purity potassium bromide tablet was used to obtain a light-transmitting body with the material to be tested. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the material were collected on an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Bruker D8 Advance) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° by step scanning at 40 kV and 15 mA with a Cu-target tube, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, which was calibrated according to the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss SIGMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Titan G260-300), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) elemental mapping were used to characterize the morphology and components of the composites. The accurate content of Pt in BOPs@Pt and BCN@Pt was determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and the instrument model was PE Avio 200. Accurate quantity BOPs@Pt and BCN@Pt were first dispersed in aqua regia for 1 day to completely liberate the platinum ions and then diluted 10 times before directly collecting the ICP-OES signals.
Electrochemical methods
The electrochemical experiment was completed in a single-chamber electrolytic cell equipped with a three-electrode system, in which the electrochemical signal was recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CS 2350) produced by Wuhan Koster Company. The counter electrode was a graphite rod (purity 99.999 wt%), and the working electrode was carbon paper (CP, effective geometric area about 0.25 cm−2) coated with the catalyst (Fig. S1†). When the electrolyte was 1 M KOH solution (pH = 14), the reference electrode was the Hg/HgO electrode (the exact potential = 0.098 V) equipped with 1 M KOH as the filling solution. When the electrolyte was 1 M PBS solution (pH = 7) and 0.05 M H2SO4 (pH = 1), the reference electrode was the Ag/AgCl electrode (the exact potential = 0.197 V) equipped with saturated potassium chloride as the filling solution. Before the start of the electrochemical test, the electrolyte was bubbled with Ar gas for 30 min to remove other gases in the electrolyte. Then, 10 times cyclic voltammetry was performed at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 to activate and stabilize the working electrode. The scanning speed for the linear scanning volt–ampere curve was 5 mV s−1. All reported results have not been compensated for iR, and the operating temperature was 25 ± 0.5 °C.
DFT calculation method
To get further insight into the effects of Pt atoms on HER performance, DFT calculations were utilized to understand the underlying mechanism of the HER process. Similarly, the generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof was selected for the exchange-correlation potential based on the Vienna ab initio simulation package with the projector-augmented plane wave method. In a previous report,38 similarly, the Pt crystal structure with 3.967 Å × 3.967 Å × 3.967 Å has been modeled using a single periodic slab with a (12 × 5) supercell, and the (111) facet was investigated as it was the dominant facet according to the XRD patterns. The BC3N crystal structure model with dimensions 47.33 Å × 19.19 Å × 22 Å was constructed based on the C4N structure (downloaded from materialproject.com; has near-matching XRD pattern and TEM result to the synthesized BC3N) and by substituting the C element with B.
The reasonable vacuum layers were set to 20 Å in order to avoid the interaction between the periodic structures. The cut-off energy for the plane wave was set to 450 eV. The energy criterion was set to 10−5 eV in the iterative solution of the Kohn–Sham equation. The Brillouin zone integration was performed using a 3 × 9 × 1 k-mesh, while for the DOS calculations, the 1 × 5 × 5 k-mesh was applied. All the structures were relaxed until the residual forces on the atoms reduced to lower than 0.05 eV Å−1.
For HER, the Gibbs free-energy (ΔGH*) was calculated as ΔGH* = ΔEH* + ΔEZPE − TΔS, where ΔEH* is the binding energy of atomic hydrogen on the given surface, and ΔEZPE and ΔS are the differences corresponding to the zero-point energy and one hydrogen entropy between the absorbed state and gas phase, respectively. ΔEH* was calculated as ΔEH* = EH* − E* − 1/2EH2, where EH*, E*, and EH2 are the energy of the catalyst with adsorbed hydrogen, pure catalyst, and the hydrogen molecule in the gas phase, respectively.39
All possible hydrogen adsorption sites, including top, bridge, hollow, and oxygen sites were considered to find the lowest energy adsorption site. In the pure Pt(111) facet, the bridge of Pt was the most stable adsorption site. For Pt-doped BC3N, the most stable hydrogen adsorption site was the B atom. Besides, the most stable adsorption site for hydrogen on Pt of BC3N was the top site of Pt.
Results and discussion
This research uses a supramolecular assembly as a structural confinement system and intends to anchor small-sized nano-Pt on the functional carrier to achieve high-efficiency HER with low cost input. In our strategy, this scheme was realized through three steps (Fig. 1a). First, the closo-[B12H12]2− with 2 highly delocalized electrons and CB[7] can quickly form a boron cluster-organic polymer supramolecular assembly (named CB[7]/B12; closo-[B12H12]2−:CB[7] = 3:2) by means of the ‘chaotropic effect’.40–42 ‘Chaotropic effect’ means that when chaotropic ions enter the water environment and combine with another target, the water network structure will change greatly, which is manifested as loss of entropy and increase in enthalpy (which brings the driving force), that is, an entropy–enthalpy compensation mechanism.42 Here, closo-[B12H12]2−, as a superchaotropic ion, quickly forms a stable supramolecular assembly with CB[7] driven by electrostatic attraction and the chaotropic effect. Closo-[B12H12]2− has the ability to reduce noble metal salts (such as Au3+, Pd2+, Pt4+ and Ag+) to the corresponding zero-valent forms.43–46 Therefore, the introduced Pt4+ could be reduced to the corresponding zero-valent form (BOPs@Pt) in the position of closo-[B12H12]2− in BOPs. Compared with NaBH4, closo-[B12H12]2− had milder reducibility for metal ions and can prevent a large number of metal nanoparticles from aggregating. In order to improve the conductivity of the restricted carrier, BOPs@Pt was further pyrolyzed into BC3N@Pt. The FT-IR spectra were used to track the evolution from CB[7]/B12 to BOPs@Pt and then to BCN@Pt (Fig. 1b). The process of consuming a small amount of closo-[B12H12]2− to convert Pt4+ into Pt(0) and anchoring on CB[7]/B12 did not lead to the disintegration of the supramolecular assemblies, and the signal peaks of closo-[B12H12]2− and CB[7] appeared simultaneously in the FT-IR spectrum of the intermediate. After pyrolysis, the FT-IR signals of closo-[B12H12]2− and CB[7] were no longer present in the BC3N@Pt spectrum, but the resonance peak of B–C–N appeared instead. The PXRD patterns showed (Fig. 1c) that in addition to the typical organic frame diffraction peaks (low angle: 10–30°), BOPs@Pt also exhibited the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt. Of these, the diffraction peaks at 39.89°, 46.40°, 67.71°, and 81.57° corresponded to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal planes of Pt in the face-centered cube configuration, which is consistent with the standard PDF card (JCPDS: 87-0640) of Pt. After the pyrolysis treatment, the diffraction peaks at low angles in the BOPs@Pt spectrum disappeared and were replaced by those of typical carbon species (10–30° broadened peaks). In addition, after pyrolysis, the half-width of the peak of Pt in BC3N@Pt tended to be the same as that in BOPs@Pt, which meant that the particle size of Pt had not changed after pyrolysis. However, the PXRD peak shape of Pt in BC3N@Pt was sharper than that of Pt in BOPs@Pt, indicating that the degree of crystallization of Pt in BCN@Pt was stronger. In order to obtain further information about the valence state of platinum in BC3N@Pt and BOPs@Pt, the XPS test was performed (Fig. 1d). Before pyrolysis, platinum in BOPs@Pt existed in the form of zero valence and oxidized states since peaks at 71.0 eV and 74.4 eV were derived from the contributions of Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2, and the peak pairs at 72.2 eV and 75.9 eV corresponded to PtO4f7/2 and PtO4f5/2, respectively. After pyrolysis, platinum in BC3N@Pt also existed in the form of zero valence and oxidized states. In this case, the peaks of Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 were at 71.3 eV and 74.7 eV, and the peaks of PtO4f7/2 and PtO4f5/2 were at 72.1 eV and 75.8 eV, respectively. On the one hand, during the transition from BOPs@Pt to BC3N@Pt, the proportion of PtO decreased and the proportion of Pt increased. This is due to the strong reducibility of [H] released by organic matter during pyrolysis. In addition, after pyrolysis, the binding energy of Pt moved to the high region, and the binding energy of PtO moved to the low direction. We believe that Pt before pyrolysis was in the electronic atmosphere provided by closo-[B12H12]2−, and so the binding energy was lower than that of Pt in BC3N@Pt after pyrolysis. After pyrolysis, the carbon species also had a certain degree of reducibility, and PtO in its presence was, therefore, in a weakly reduced state (and the binding energy had reduced). XPS also showed that the elements B, C, and N in BC3N@Pt formed bonds with each other. The binding energy signal in the B element region could be attributed to the contribution of the B–O bond, B–N bond and B–C bond (Fig. 1e). The binding energy signal in the C element region could be attributed to the contribution of the CO bond, C–N bond, C–C bond and C–B bond (Fig. 1f). The signal in the N element region could be attributed to the coupling of the N–C bond and the N–B bond signals (Fig. 1g). In addition, XPS gave the content ratio of B, C and N as 19.74:65.13:16.49 (atomic ratio), which is close to 1:3:1, and is the basis for naming BC3N.

The morphology and composition of BOPs, BOPs@Pt and BC3N@Pt were first clarified by SEM and TEM measurements. Generally, BOPs (Fig. 2a), BOPs@Pt (Fig. 2b) and BC3N@Pt (Fig. 2c and d) presented a sheet-like structure in the SEM images. The subtle difference was that the nanosheets in BOPs were staggered, while the nanosheets in BOPs@Pt and BC3N@Pt were superimposed on each other. The change in the stacking mode of the nanosheets comes from the rearrangement effect of the violent movement of the components in the material at high temperatures. In TEM images (Fig. 2e–h), BOPs@Pt (Fig. 2e) and BC3N@Pt (Fig. 2g) had evenly distributed nanoparticles with a particle size of 5–8 nm. In these samples, the lattice spacing of these uniformly distributed black nanoparticles was 2.26 Å, which corresponded with zero-valent Pt (Fig. 2f and h). Before and after pyrolysis, the particle size distribution of Pt in BOPs@Pt and BC3N@Pt remained almost unchanged. However, the contrast between Pt in BC3N@Pt and the carrier was higher, which is due to the better degree of crystallization of Pt in BC3N@Pt. In addition, element mapping also showed that the black nanoparticles in BOPs@Pt (Fig. 2i) and BC3N@Pt (Fig. 2j) corresponded to the Pt nanoparticles, and the other elements (B, C and N) were also evenly distributed in the carrier.

To investigate the very purpose of the BC3N@Pt material design, we evaluated its catalytic activity in HER in detail. In the alkaline medium (1 M KOH), BC3N@Pt exhibited excellent HER catalytic activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with only an overpotential of 26.1 mV (Fig. 3a). Although the overpotentials needed to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 by commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and BOPs@Pt were only 36.9 mV and 40.8 mV, respectively, they still did not match the catalytic performance of BC3N@Pt. Similarly, the overpotentials for BC3N@Pt, 20 wt% Pt/C and BOPs@Pt in the neutral pH electrolyte to achieve a current density of 10 mV cm−2 were 38.5 mV, 45.4 mV and 63.8 mV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The overpotentials needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 when driven by BC3N@Pt, 20 wt% Pt/C and BOPs@Pt in the acid electrolyte were 23.1 mV, 39.2 mV and 44.6 mV, respectively (Fig. 3c). Overall, the catalytic activity in the acidic, neutral and alkaline media increased in the order of BC3N@Pt > 20 wt% Pt/C > BOPs@Pt. Although the current densities of BOPs@Pt, 20 wt% Pt/C and BC3N@Pt were close to each other under low applied potentials, the current density gap under larger applied potentials increased significantly. For example, when the current density reached 100 mA cm−2 under alkaline conditions, the overpotentials required when BOPs@Pt, 20 wt% Pt/C and BC3N@Pt were used as the working electrodes were 175 mV, 160 mV and 135 mV, respectively. Fig. 3d–f show the Tafel slopes obtained by taking log(j) as the abscissa and the overpotential as the ordinate. The Tafel slopes (linear part) of BC3N@Pt, BOPs@Pt and 20 wt% Pt/C in the alkaline medium were 41.59 mV dec−1, 62.82 mV dec−1 and 39.11 mV dec−1, while the values in the neutral medium were 59.05 mV, 85.43 mV and 55.18 mV, and those in the acid medium were 61.07 mV dec−1, 62.61 mV dec−1 and 64.24 mV dec−1 respectively. It could be seen that the Tafel slopes driven by BC3N@Pt were not only close to the values of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, but also far lower than the values of BOPs@Pt in alkaline and neutral media. In these media, the smaller the Tafel slope, the faster was the increasing rate of current density. In addition, the magnitude of the Tafel slope obtained from the log(j)–overpotential graph also implied a dominant path for the occurrence of HER. According to the Tafel slope, the reaction paths of HER on BOPs@Pt, BC3N@Pt and Pt/C were closer to the electrochemical desorption mechanism, that is, the Heyrovsky mechanism with the below steps.1 First, the hydrogen species in the solution is adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst: H3O + e + M → M − H + H2O (where M refers to the active site of the catalyst). Then, M − H combines with H3O+ to form H2 and release active hydrogen: M − H + H3O+ + e → H2 + H2O + M.

Stability is one of the most crucial parameters for evaluating electrocatalysts and determines whether a catalyst can enter actual production. In this study, accelerated cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the stability of BC3N@Pt in the process of catalyzing HER. In the alkaline medium, after the accelerated cyclic voltammetry experiment was performed 10000 times, the current density was only slightly attenuated from the initial value (the current density difference at 100 mV overpotential was only about 7.7 mV) (Fig. 3g). BC3N@Pt still had good catalytic stability in the neutral and acidic media, and the current densities after 10000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry only differed by about 13.01 mV and 18.00 mV, respectively (Fig. 3h and i). In addition, the physicochemical properties of BC3N@Pt after catalyzing HER were almost the same as the initial value, as illustrated by XPS (Fig. S2†), PXRD (Fig. S3†), and TEM images (Fig. S4†).
The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and geometric area have similar meanings when used to normalize the current density. ECSA is positively correlated with electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), and its value correlates with the number of active sites used for catalysis. The Cdl values of BOPs@Pt, BCN@Pt and 20 wt% Pt/C obtained from the cyclic voltammetry curves by different scanning speeds were 1.1 mF cm−2, 9.9 mF cm−2 and 28.0 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. S5†). This is consistent with the results of the HER test, which means that the active sites on the BCN@Pt working electrode with the same geometric area were far more than that on 20 wt% Pt/C. Due to the difference in Pt loading between BOPs@Pt, BC3N@Pt and 20 wt% Pt/C, the mass activity can be better assessed by their performance characteristics in catalyzing HER. From the ICP-OES test, the accurate loadings of Pt in BOPs@Pt, BC3N@Pt and 20 wt% Pt/C were 4.81 wt%, 6.01 wt% and 20.0. wt%, respectively. Based on this, the corresponding Pt loadings on the carbon paper were 6.72 μg, 4.81 μg and 20 μg, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the HER mass activity in the full pH range showed the trend of BC3N@Pt > BOPs@Pt > 20 wt% P/C. Among these, the HER mass activity of BC3N@Pt was at least 3 times higher than that of 20 wt% Pt/C, and the HER mass activity of BOPs@Pt was also at least 2 times higher than that of 20 wt% Pt/C. The Nyquist plot showed (Fig. 4b) that the mass transfer resistance (Rct) of BC3N@Pt was about 48 Ω, while the Rct of BOPS@PT reached 200 Ω. Due to the weak electrical conductivity of the organic framework, the mass activity of BOPs@Pt in catalyzing HER was lower than that of BC3N@Pt, which is why it is necessary to pyrolyze BOPs into the BC3N matrix. The excellent catalytic activity of BC3N@Pt in HER makes it an outstanding representative of platinum-based catalysts for HER (Fig. 4c and Table S1†).

To understand the effect of Pt/BC3N in the HER performance, DFT calculations were employed. Fig. 5a and S6† show structures of Pt(111) and BC3N@Pt(111) (details in “Computational methods”). For investigating the electronic structure of BC3N@Pt(111), the charge density difference, Bader charge analysis and electron localization function (ELF) were firstly simulated. Based on Fig. 5c, there was overt charge accumulation around Pt and charge depletion around B, revealing charge interaction between Pt and B. The ELF plot analysis showed that Pt and B have a total strong covalent bond, while C and N are in the ionization form on the electronic structure, which is in agreement with the above-mentioned XPS results (Fig. 5e). The Bader charge analysis obviously showed that the electron flow direction was from Pt to B (Fig. 5d). In order to further elucidate the origin of the improved HER activity of BC3N@Pt(111) after introducing the Pt atoms, the density of states (DOS) was also calculated to deeply investigate the changes in the electronic structure of the catalyst. According to the partial and total DOS calculations (Fig. 5b), with the addition of Pt atoms in BC3N@Pt(111), Pt showed strong interactions with B and N. To elucidate the inherent relationship between the electronic structure and the enhanced electrocatalytic HER performance of BC3N@Pt(111), the adsorption free energy of the HER intermediates was also calculated. Generally, two steps are involved in neutral pH HER, including H2O adsorption/activation and H recombination on the surface of the catalyst; therefore, strong bonding of H2O and neither too strong nor too weak bonding of H to the surface are desired.47 As displayed in Fig. 5f, Pt in BC3N@Pt(111) showed much lower adsorption energy for H2O (ΔGH2O*) compared with BC3N@Pt(111) and BC3N, indicating it had the strongest water adsorption, which benefits the following steps toward generating adsorbed H atoms. In addition, the calculated ΔGH* for the adsorbed H atom to form molecular H2 is the key descriptor to predicting and evaluating the HER activity on the catalyst surface. BC3N possessed a more negative value of ΔGH*, indicating excessively strong adsorption of H and averse to H desorption and H2 release. In contrast, the ΔGH* values of Pt in BC3N@Pt(111) and Pt(111) (Fig. 5g) were closer to the optimal value of ΔGH* = 0 eV, supporting high HER activity. From the above results, it can be found that doping Pt atoms into BC3N can regulate the electronic states of B, resulting in an enhanced ΔGH2O* and a more thermoneutral ΔGH*, thus devoting improved HER performance.

Conclusions
In this work, with CB[7] as the host molecule and closo-[B12H12]2− as the guest molecule, supramolecular assemblies (BOPs) with weak reducibility were constructed. Then, Pt4+ was converted into Pt nanoparticles with high dispersion and of small particle size in situ at the closo-[B12H12]2− positions in BOPs. An annealing treatment transformed the poor conductivity carrier BOPs to a good electron conductor BC3N, and the Pt nanoparticles in BC3N@Pt maintained the distribution state after the annealing treatment. BC3N@Pt proved to be a highly efficient HER catalyst, with a universal applicability in efficiently catalyzing HER in the full pH range. Specifically, the overpotentials required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the media of pH = 14, pH = 7 and pH = 1 were only 26.1 mV, 38.5 mV and 23.1 mV, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slopes were as low as 41.59 mV dec−1, 59.05 mV dec−1, and 61.07 mV dec−1, respectively. In terms of mass activity, the rate of HER driven by BCN@Pt was at least three times that of the commercialized 20 wt% Pt/C. The annealing treatment converted the organic polymer into the inorganic BCN matrix, which not only accelerated the electron transfer rate of HER, but also ensured the stability of BC3N@Pt while catalyzing HER in the entire pH range. Both experimental and theoretical investigations show that BCN without Pt has poor HER catalytic performance, while HER catalyzed by Pt-anchored in BC3N was easier than that by nano-Pt withoutBC3N.
