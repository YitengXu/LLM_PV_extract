    , Accepted 11th November 2021First published on 29th November 2021AbstractThis work shows a detailed study of the synthesis, structural characterization, electrical, thermal, and mechanical luminescence behavior of a one-dimensional coordination polymer formed by a Cu(I)–I double chain, using 2-amino-4 chloropyrimidine as a ligand. The asymmetric structure of double chain type [Cu(L)I]n, (L = 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine (aCLpym)) with Cu–Cu distances shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of two copper atoms, and the substantial flexibility of this structure are crucial to understanding its optoelectronic behavior. The electrical conductivity values at 295 K are in agreement with possible semiconductor behavior. Additionally, the luminescence properties of this coordination polymer (CP) were characterized under ambient conditions (ambient pressure (AP) and 295 K) by a non-symmetric high energy (HE) band centered at 465 nm, tentatively assigned to a mixed 3(I + M)LCT. The intensity of the emission increases upon lowering the temperature. A structural contraction can explain this behaviour, clearly observed when solving the structures employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the compound at 296 K and 110 K. Strong mechanochromic behavior was observed when hydrostatic pressure was applied, with the appearance of an additional low energy (LE) band at around 650 nm, which for this type of CuI CP is typically associated with transitions in the CuI cluster-core, involving 3IMCT and cluster centered 3d10 → 3d94s1 (3MCC) states. The latter is due to the shortening under pressure of the Cu–Cu distances below the van der Waals limit. Moreover, the study of the mechanochromic behavior versus pressure exerted by grinding shows a decrease in the intensity of the emission due to the increase in the number of defects in the material and a decrease in its particle size.
Introduction
Copper(I)–iodine coordination polymers (CPs) with ligands derived from pyrimidines and pyrazines have been studied from different points of view.1,2 Indeed, pyrimidines are an important class of heterocyclic structures found in many synthetic and naturally occurring products with a remarkable spectrum of biological activities by themselves or in combination with metal ions.3 These primary amines with an electron-withdrawing group, such as 2-amino-4 chloropyrimidine, are ligands that can stabilize the Cu(I) oxidation state. In addition, they present the possibility of molecular recognition by forming hydrogen bonds, thanks to the presence of the amino group.4
Structurally, Cu(I)–I CPs can present different dimensionality depending on the chosen pyrimidine ligands.5 Their chains can form various topologies, with those with a Cu(I)–I double chain (1D-staircase ribbon) being the most common.6–8 Most of them have luminescence properties and behave as stimulus-responsive or intelligent materials.2,6,9 Indeed, they can change their properties in response to temperature, pressure, and the presence of gases, among other stimuli.4 An attractive characteristic of these CPs is their partial solubility in some organic solvents such as acetonitrile and the reorganization of the building blocks to the pristine CP through the slow evaporation of the said solvent.2 This unusual characteristic allows fine crystals to be obtained from the solution, useful for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This technique greatly facilitates the comprehension of their behavior when exposed to external stimuli. Their Cu(I)–I chains are extremely sensitive, behaving like springs, resulting in a shortening in the Cu–Cu and Cu–I distances and the Cu–I–Cu angles when the CPs are subjected to low temperature or to high pressures.10
The thermal stability of these types of CPs, their synthesis in a single step,11,12 the low cost of the ligands, and their interesting optical properties, make these compounds hold much interest in different areas and promising for technological applications, such as data recording devices and motion or stress sensors.13 Moreover, recent studies have shown that these types of CPs can be processed into controlled thickness composite films, improving their mechanical properties and maintaining their optical properties, thus expanding the possibility of creating new optical devices,5 such as14 light converting agents to increase quantum efficiency in solar cells.15 Despite interest in these compounds, research towards understanding the behavior versus stimuli such as pressure is still scarce. Indeed, very few studies have applied hydrostatic pressure and solved the crystal structures of these materials under different pressures via single-crystal X-ray diffractometry.16 Furthermore, although the mechanoluminescence studies of copper iodide clusters by grinding are commonplace, they are primarily associated with a crystalline-to-amorphous conversion.17,18 However, the examples in which crystallinity is maintained are still few.2
This work shows a detailed study of the synthesis, characterization, electrical, thermal, and mechanical luminescence behavior of a 1D coordination polymer formed from a Cu(I)–I double chain, using 2-amino-4 chloropyrimidine as a ligand. Its partial solubility in acetonitrile allows single crystals to be obtained to allow the solving of its structure by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, as well as an understanding of its luminescence behavior versus temperature and pressure variations when solving the structure at different temperatures and pressures. This work supports the reversible behavior of this CP against temperature and pressure, except for the conductivity of the material subjected to grinding. In this case, the study of its morphological transformation corroborates its nano processing, the decrease in grain size, and the increase in the number of defects that explain its luminescence behaviour.
Materials and methods
All reagents and solvents purchased were used without further purification. Copper(I) iodide (CuI, 99%) and 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine (aClpym, 98%) were purchased from Fluorochem, and potassium iodine (KI, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The solvents used in the synthesis, acetonitrile (CH3CN) and ethanol (EtOH), were purchased from Labkem and Scharlau at HPLC purification grade.
Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer 100 spectrophotometer equipped with a universal ATR sampling accessory in the wavelength range of 4000 to 650 cm−1. Elemental analyses were performed on a LECO CHNS-932 Elemental Analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a θ/2θ primary monochromator and X'Celerator fast detector and 1° for Kα1 monochromator. The samples were analyzed with scanning θ/2θ, from 3–60 degrees, with an angular increase of 0.0167 and a time per increment of 100 s. Thermogravimetric analysis coupled to differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) was carried out in a TA Instruments Q500 thermobalance oven using a Pt sample holder. Experiments were carried out under nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 90 mL min−1 and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, over a temperature range from 25 to 1000 °C.
Excitation and emission spectra
Excitation and emission spectra were recorded in the spectral range of 300–1000 nm using a Spex Fluorolog II spectrometer equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp as an excitation source, two 0.22 m monochromators (Spex 1680) for wavelength selection of the excitation and emission light, respectively, and a cryostat equipped with a vacuum pump to take the polycrystalline powders from room temperature (RT, 296 K) to liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT, 77 K). The emission was detected using a 950 V photo multiplier tube (PMT) working in photon counting mode. High-pressure luminescence spectra were recorded on a 0.75 m single grating monochromator (Spex 750 M). The excitation source was 375 nm diode laser excitation (BrixX 200 mW pump power), and a cooled photomultiplier (PMT) (Hamamatsu 928b) was used in the detection. For high-pressure measurements up to 10 GPa, a single crystal was placed in a miniature diamond anvil cell (mini-DAC), designed at the University of Paderborn (Germany), equipped with an inconel gasket and low luminescence II-a type diamonds for optical and infrared measurements. A mixture of 16:3:1 methanol–ethanol–water was used as a pressure-transmitting medium to provide hydrostatic pressures of up to 14 GPa. The hydrostatic pressure was calibrated using the ruby R1 line fluorescence technique.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements under ambient pressure (296 K and 110 K) were conducted using a Bruker Kappa Apex II diffractometer employing graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The measurements were processed using the APEX2 software. The structures of the crystal CP1 at 296 and 110 K were determined using a dual-space algorithm employing the SHELXT program, and refinement was performed using the SHELXL program against F2 by full-matrix least-squares refinement. The cell parameters were determined and refined by the least-squares fitting of all reflections. A semi-empirical absorption correction (SADABS) was applied. Details of the structure determination and refinement are summarized in Table S1.† For high-pressure measurements, we used a Rigaku SuperNOVA diffractometer with microfocused X-rays using molybdenum radiation. Also, a Bragg mini-DAC from Almax-EasyLab was used, with an opening angle of 85° and anvil culets of 500 μm in diameter, fitted with a stainless gasket featuring a hole of 200 μm in diameter and 75 μm in depth. A methanol–ethanol mixture (4:1) was used as a pressure-transmitting medium, which remains hydrostatic across the range of pressure used in our experiments19,20 to minimize deviatoric stresses, which can cause incorrect values for bulk modulus.21 The sample was placed on one of the diamond anvils (diffracted side) together with a small ruby sphere as a pressure sensor. The structure was refined for each pressure, using previous results as the starting point, on F2 by full-matrix least-squares refinement using the SHELXL program. Due to the limitations of the opening angle of our DAC, it was only possible to collect about 27% of the total reflections present in a full dataset under ambient conditions. In this situation, structure refinements were performed with isotropic displacement parameters for all atoms except for the heavy atoms (Cu and I), which were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters whenever they did not become non-positive definite. Hydrogen atoms were included in the final procedure in the same way as for the ambient conditions data. No restraints were used during this process. Crystallographic data for the structures reported in this contribution have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as a supplementary publication, 2111057–2111074.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Philips XL 30 S-FEG electron microscope, applying an electron beam of 300 μA intensity and 10.0 kV potential at a pressure of 10−7 Pa. To obtain reproducible results, very flat substrates were used with precise, controlled chemical functionalities, freshly prepared just before the chemical deposition of the samples. Doped SiO2 surfaces were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Elma, 37 kHz, 380 W) for 15 min in acetone and 15 min in 2-propanol and then dried under an argon flow. After sample preparation, the surfaces were metalized with a 10 nm thick Cr layer under a pressure of 10−3 Pa.
Electrical conductivity measurements
Two probe direct current (dc) electrical conductivity measurements were performed at 295 K on several (at least three) single crystals as well as a pressed pellet (at 6.0 GPa, 2 min) of CP1 (Fig. S20 and S21†). A twin crystal was indexed (Fig. S3†) to determine the growth axis of the Cu–I chains and thus measure the conductivity in the same direction, parallel to the a-axis. The conductivity values were obtained by applying voltages from −10.0 to +10.0 V. The final conductivity value is given by the average value, respectively. The contacts were made with Pt wires (25 μm diameter) using graphite paste. The samples were measured on Quantum Design PPMS-9 equipment connected to an external voltage source (Keithley model 2400 source-meter) and amperemeter (Keithley model 6514 electro-meter).
Synthetic procedure

Synthesis of 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n (CP1). 
A solution of 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine (aClpym) (130 mg, 1.00 mmol) in ethanol (23 mL) was added to a solution of CuI (190 mg, 1.00 mmol) in acetonitrile (12 mL) at 25 °C. A white precipitate instantaneously formed and the reaction mixture was maintained for 24 h under magnetic stirring (1600 rpm). The solid obtained was filtered off, washed with acetonitrile (2 × 3 mL) and ethanol (2 × 3 mL), and dried under vacuum. Colourless needle-shaped crystals of CP1, suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis, were obtained from the mother solution after 48 h of evaporation at room temperature. Yield: 242 mg (76% based on Cu). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C4H4ClCuIN3: C 15.01, H 1.26, N 13.13; found: C 15.07, H 1.48, N 13.12. IR selected data (ATR):  (cm−1): 3417 (m), 3292 (m), 3212 (w), 3186 (m), 3169 (m), 3101 (vw) y 3076 (vw), 1639 (s), 1545 (m), 1478 (vs), 1422 (s), 1335 (s), 1222 (m), 1186 (w), 1038 (s), 932 (vw), 895 (w), 797 (w), 779 (m), 718 (m), 668 (m) (Fig. S6†). The powder XRD diffraction spectrum from the powder shows the same crystal structure as that of the single crystals (Fig. S4†).

Results and discussion
The synthesis of the coordination polymer (CP1) was always performed in 1:1 metal–ligand stoichiometry, using a mixture of acetonitrile–ethanol to dissolve the CuI and the ligand adequately. Its partial solubility in the reaction medium allowed the formation of an immediate precipitate (CP1 at 25 °C). Crystals useful for the structural solution through single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation of the mother liquor. Single-crystal data and structure refinement details for the compound 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n (CP1) at room (RT) and low temperature (LT) are described in Table S1.†
The solution of the structure was determined using a two domain twin rotated 180° instead of a single crystal (Fig. S3†).
The results of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that CP1 crystallizes in a monoclinic form in the P21/n space group and shows the formation of double chains [Cu(L)I]n, (L = 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine (aClpym)), where each Cu(I) atom is coordinated to three iodine atoms and a ligand via the pyrimidine nitrogen to form a tetragonal geometry (Fig. 1 and S1†). This double Cu(I)–I chain is a standard coordination mode for this type of CP.22,23 Its geometric parameters are similar to the related staircases copper iodine structures found in the CSD Database (Table S2†).24 The short Cu⋯Cu distances, 2.695 and 3.361 Å, close to the sum of the van der Waals radii of two copper atoms (estimated to be 2.8 Å)25 are the reason for their optoelectronic properties, being in most cases semiconductor26 and luminescent compounds.27 The Cu–N distance is 2.042 Å is in the expected range for this type of bond (Table S2†).22,28 The interactions between the chains and the growth of the chains parallel to the a-axis lead to a needle-shaped crystal (Fig. S3b†). The chains remain attached due to supramolecular π–π and hydrogen bond interactions between one of the free nitrogens and the hydrogen of the ligand forming the next chain (Fig. S2†). At RT, the N⋯H distance is 2.196 Å and when the temperature is decreased to 100 K there is an approximation between the chains and consequently a shortening of the N⋯H distance to 2.162 Å (Table S3†).

Cu: orange; I: purple; C: grey; H: white; N: blue. 
TGA of CP1 was carried out, and the mass losses, temperature ranges, and interpretations can be found in the ESI† (Fig. S7 and Table S4). The TGA data reveal a first stage at around 180 °C, with the loss of half the ligand, and at 535 °C the loss of the remaining ligand. Finally, at 607 °C the decomposition of CuI is observed. The IR spectra of the CP obtained (Fig. S6†) show the characteristic bands of the ligand used, displaced by the coordination of the metal center (Cu(I)) to the N1 and/or N3 nitrogen atom positions of the aromatic ring of the substituted pyrimidine.
Photophysical properties
Photophysical properties of CPs based on d10 metal centers are of current interest. Mainly those CPs containing Cu(I) as building blocks may show bright luminescence emission, varying from blue to red light, and therefore, they have attracted recent attention towards potential applications.28–34
To investigate the fluorescence thermochromism properties of the compound, we first recorded the photoluminescence behavior of the sample under a UV lamp at 300 K and 80 K. As shown in Fig. 2, CP1 emits blue light at RT and green-blue light at 80 K (LT). The compound exhibits fluorescence thermochromism properties, and this thermochromic behavior is fully reversible.
 Fig. 2  Emission spectrum (λexc = 390 nm) at different temperatures in solid-state 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n (CP1), from room temperature (RT, 300 K) (light blue) to liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT, 80 K) (red). 
To evaluate these seminal experimental observations in more detail, emission spectra of CP1 at variable temperature were recorded (Fig. 2). Upon excitation at 390 nm, by lowering the temperature of CP1 from 300 to 80 K, it exhibits a very weak broadband at 468 nm at RT, which increases in intensity and shifts to 480 nm upon lowering the temperature to 80 K (Fig. 2) (Δ = 12 nm at 80 K). The compound exhibits broad emission bands with barely any band shifting, suggesting that the emission could be derived from a charge-transfer excited state. The origins of the luminescence emissions could be assigned to metal-to ligand charge transfer (MLCT), iodide-to-ligand charge transfer (ILCT), iodide-to metal charge transfer (IMCT), and cluster-centered (CC*) transition, or an admixture of more than one of the above.35–39
The 1D chain polymeric stair-type chain structure adopted by CP1 is typical for I–Cu–N donor ligands coordination polymers, and the emission origin, centered at around 500–630 nm, might be derived from an excited state 3ILCT*, and at shorter wavelengths (like in the CP1 case, which appeared at 468 nm) when they are mixed with copper cluster-centered 3d10 → 3d94s1 (3MCC) or IMLCT. The contribution of the 3MCC transition in the excited state is enhanced when the Cu–Cu distances are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radius (2.80 Å). In this case, the structure adopted by CP1 contains an asymmetrical Cu2I2 rhombic core with one Cu⋯Cu distance less than 2.8 Å and another longer (Table S2†). This suggests a higher contribution of the excited state of d–s character (3MCC), shifting the emission wavelength to a higher value. Additionally, as explained later in the mechanoluminescence studies, the emission spectra versus pressure allow us to deduce that the band observed under ambient conditions may arise from a 3(I + Cu)LCT combination, excluding the contributions that arise from the transitions in the CuI cluster.6,30,40–44 On the other hand, this emission corresponds to a so-called high energy (HE) band. An additional low energy (LE) band appears to be associated with the transitions in the cluster, that is, IMCT and MCC. The increase in the intensity of the emission observed when the temperature decreases (Fig. 2) can be explained by a structural contraction. This is observed when solving the structures employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the compound at 296 K and 110 K (Fig. 1, Tables S1–S3†) both in the Cu–Cu and Cu–I distance, as in the angles and in the supramolecular interactions through hydrogen bonds (Table S3†).
Previous studies have shown that the emission energies of Cu(I)–iodide complexes are strongly affected by the presence of heterocyclic organic ligands linked to the metal center of the [CunIn] chains, mainly due to structural changes induced by the presence of terminal ligands and/or their supramolecular interactions.45–47 Therefore, we decided to compare the solid-state luminescence behavior of CP1, with coordination polymers based on Cu2I2 chains bridged by pyrimidine N-heteroaromatic ligands containing different auxiliary ligands in the 2,4 positions of the ring, such as one amino and one chloride group, respectively (Table S5†). Moreover, to evaluate the possible presence of emission arising from a ligand-centered (LC) transition, the free ligand 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine was also investigated at 300 and 80 K (Fig. S8†). The 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine exhibits two clear bands centered at 452 and 500 nm (λex = 356 nm), which increase in intensity when the temperature decreases. These emissions correspond to ligand-centered π → π* transitions, and we can observe that the emission is affected by the nature of the substituent on the pyrimidine ring. As described previously, the electronic structure of the aromatic ring can significantly impact the emission. In this case, the weak emission of CP1 can be attributed to the aromatic ring of one amino and one chlorine group in the 2,4 positions giving rise to lower intermolecular packing.
The temporal luminescence decay of the emission band of CP1 was recorded at 300 and 80 K under excitation at 355 nm using the third harmonic of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Fig. S10,† red and blue circles, respectively). As can be seen, the decays were complex (no single exponential) at both temperatures, and they can be well fitted using a double exponential function (Fig. S10,† black lines). The different parameters associated with the fitting functions are included in the supplementary information (Table S6†) together with the average decay time <τ> (as indicated at the bottom of Table S6†). The average decay time of CP1 at 80 K gives a value of 0.11 μs, while at 300 K exhibits a value of 0.03 μs. This reduction could be attributed to multiphonon relaxation, which may be induced by changes in the bond lengths and angles. The lifetime decrease is also according to the reduction observed in the emission band intensity when the temperature increases (see Fig. 2). In the range of microseconds, the average decay time is the typical range assigned to phosphorescence emission, indicating that this emission band arises from a triplet state.
Solid-state emission depends on the molecular structure, so mechanical stresses alter the arrangement of the inter/intramolecular interactions and modify the Cu–I chains according to the temperature. To study the mechanoluminescence behavior, high-pressure hydrostatic emission was measured for compound CP1, as a microcrystalline powder and using a single crystal. In addition, the behavior of CP1 upon being ground was studied.
The hydrostatic high-pressure technique is a powerful tool that allows the study of the luminescence properties of a system, by continuously varying the different parameters involved, as the bond distances and angles are closely related to the luminescence properties. For CP1, pressure-induced changes in the emission are a clear example of mechanochromic effects.
The pressure experiment was carried out under ambient conditions (AP 300 K), with excitation at 375 nm, where CP1 shows an asymmetric broadband centered approximately at 465 nm (blue). Compressing the sample, drastic changes, even at very low pressure (0.19 GPa), were observed, with an additional band emerging at longer wavelengths with an intensity more significant than the previous one (Fig. 3). These data resemble those observed for other CuI coordination polymers and are described considering two well differentiated bands coined in the literature as HE and LE bands.16,48 At around 3.0 GPa, a third band starts appearing at 445 nm. The evolution of these bands with pressure was analyzed.
 Fig. 3  Normalized luminescence spectra of 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n obtained at 300 K under 375 nm laser excitation for different externally applied hydrostatic pressures. The pressure labels in black correspond to compression and in red to decompression. 
Regarding the HE and LE bands, both show similar behavior, with non-linear red-shifts (bathochromic) with pressure, where the maximum variation takes place between 1.0 and 4.0 GPa. Tentative linear fitting was carried out, to give average slopes of −452 cm−1 GPa−1 and −323 cm−1 GPa−1 for the HE and LE bands, respectively. At pressures beyond 4.0 GPa, the shifts are less pronounced and seem to be stabilized (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, no pressure shift for the third band was observed. The intensity decreased by approximately 85% from AP to 6.7 GPa (Fig. 4b), and the same as with the band-shifts, beyond 4.0 GPa some stabilization of the intensity was observed. During the experiment, the relative intensities of the HE and LE bands remained unchanged.
 Fig. 4  a) Energy shifts of the peak position of the HE and LE bands. b) Integrated intensities of the emission bands with pressure. 
Upon decompressing the sample, the positions of the bands, as well as the total intensity, were almost recovered. However, the relative intensities of the HE and LE bands differ, to the point that at AP the LE band remains, contrary to what happens at the beginning of the experiment.
The AP experimental results show the presence of the HE band alone, which is usually ascribed to a combination of (I + M)LCT bands, and the averaged lifetime of 0.11 μs obtained at 80 K, suggests a phosphorescence mechanism between spin-forbidden triplet–singlet transitions (T1 → S0) with the 3(I + M)LCT transitions. However, the short lifetime obtained for this emission at 300 K in the order of 0.03 μs indicates an abrupt temperature-dependent rise of the non-radiative mechanisms (knr). The non-exponential character of the decay curve (Fig. S10 and Table S6†) supports the presence of more than one emitter state. At shallow pressures (0.18 GPa), another band at a longer wavelength (LE) was also activated, being usually ascribed to transitions within the CuI cluster-core, and considered as a combination of iodide-to-metal (iodide-to-copper) 3IMCT and copper-centered 3d10 → 3d94s1 (3MCC) transitions, with the latter only observed under some Cu–Cu distance requirements (<2.8 Å), that is less than the double of the van der Waals radii, established for the Cu atoms as 1.4 Å.49
In these cases, the interaction between pairs of Cu atoms (cuprophilic interactions) can be considered as non-negligible. From room temperature single-crystal X-ray measurements on CP1, two distinct Cu–Cu pair distances were obtained (Fig. 1b), with values under ambient conditions of 2.695 Å (shorter one) and 3.361 Å (longer one). Therefore, only the Cu pairs at shorter distances are expected to contribute towards the LE emission. On the other hand, as can be deduced from the variation of the cell parameters and the unit cell volume with pressure, CP1 is highly compressible (Fig. S12†), giving rise to significant shortenings of the Cu–Cu distances, of around 6% and 18% for the shorter and larger ones at 7.0 GPa, respectively. Still, despite these shortenings, they are hard enough to activate LE emission from the larger distance Cu–Cu pairs since the threshold value is reached at more than 6 GPa (2.756 Å at 7 GPa). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for other similar complexes show the Cu–Cu bonding character of the excited state. As the pressure increases, the Cu–Cu distances become shorter, increasing the bonding character and then lowering the energy level and consequently inducing a red-shift in the emission bands.50,51
As can be observed from Fig. S13† the variations in these distances are not linear, in accordance with the non-linear red-shifting observed for the emission bands. Focusing on the emission from the shorter pairs, the slope is higher from ambient to 4.0 GPa (Fig. 3), and then tends to stabilize for pressures higher than 4.0 GPa. The same behavior is observed for the integrated intensity of the emission (see Fig. 4b), where the drop in intensity with pressure is again greater in the 0.0 to 4.0 GPa range, where both effects can be correlated with changes in the structure, more evident in this pressure range, which enhances the non-radiative mechanism, knr.
The multicomponent origin of the emission observed upon applying pressure and the presence of a third band, which emerges at around 450 nm under approximately 4.0 GPa, may indicate that the two different components, 3(I + M)LCT, proposed for the HE band, exhibit different pressure behavior, one highly dependent on the conditions, which rapidly red-shifts, the other independent. This fact separates both contributions, giving rise to two different HE bands.
Concerning this study, single-crystal X-ray diffraction on a single crystal of CP1 was carried out to analyze structural changes under hydrostatic pressure. Thus, a crystal of CP1 was introduced into a cell with a liquid medium and was subjected to a gradual increase in pressure from 0 to 9 GPa. From the behavior of cell parameters with pressure, only a small change can be observed in the b-axis at around 2 GPa but without any discontinuity in the volume curve. Therefore, no evidence allows us to conclude a phase transition in this compound (Fig. S12†). The main changes arise from an important deformation of the Cu–I ladders gliding from one side to the other and a moderate reorientation of the pyrimidine rings, where we can observe an asymmetric behavior in the Cu⋯Cu diagonal interactions (Fig. S13†). The increase in pressure causes a contraction of the structure. In particular, the hydrogen bond holding the Cu–I chains together becomes more important as the pressure increases, going from 2.196 Å at 0 GPa to 1.960 Å at 9 GPa. The distance between the pyrimidine rings and their respective slippage distances are shown in Fig. S14.† The volume of the tetrahedral structure formed with Cu as the central atom and the nitrogen and iodine atoms (N1, I1 I1ii, and I1iii) is also affected, as shown in Fig. S15.†
The study of the mechanoluminescence behavior of CP1 upon being ground shows different behavior. In general, the grinding of CPs results in the compounds being crushed, and the generation of granules and defects, where the compounds undergo variations both in the intensity of the emission and in the wavelength peak.52 In this study, CP1 shows an emission intensity that decreases in line with the grinding time (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Emission spectra (λexc = 390 nm) of 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n at different grinding times: 0 min (light blue line), 5 min (blue line), 10 min (red line), and 15 min (black line). 
The powder XRD diffraction data show no phase transformation of the CP1 after grinding, independent of time (Fig. S5†). There is slight amorphization with hardly any loss of crystallinity. Since after grinding, all peaks are preserved, and only slight peak broadening occurs. This behavior can be explained by the fact that many defects are created and the grain size decreases, as seen in the SEM images obtained after the grinding period (Fig. S22†). This results in the division of the energy bands into discrete levels, causing the loss of emission by non-radiative processes.18
Conclusions
This work shows the synthesis in a single step and characterization of the monodimensional double-chain CP 1D-[Cu(aClpym)I]n (CP1), obtained via direct synthesis between CuI and 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine. This luminescent compound also exhibits possible semiconductor behavior, being thermochromic and reversible fluorescent.
The combination of the emission experiments versus temperature and pressure allowed us to have a more precise idea of the contributions of the different states in the final emission of the compound. The decrease in temperature produces a structural contraction that causes a shortening in distances and angles (Cu–Cu, Cu–I…), generating an increase in emission due to an increase in cuprophilia. This response is reversible, showing the great flexibility of this type of structure. In addition, the pressure exerted hydrostatically does not cause phase transitions, shortens the Cu–Cu distances, increases the binding character, decreases the energy level, induces red-shifting, and increases the emission of the compound. However, the pressure exerted by grinding results in a reduction in emission due to the decrease in the grain size and an increase in the number of defects with hardly any loss in crystallinity or structural transformation. Multi-response materials can act as sensors in industries as diverse as food, packaging, or aerospace, and these studies have great relevance for the design and crystal engineering of new Cu(I)–I coordination polymers with better and more interesting optical properties, which may be helpful in the creation of new optoelectronic devices with industrial utility.
