    , Accepted 11th January 2018First published on 12th January 2018AbstractHybrid perovskite MAPbCl3 is considered to be one of the most promising candidates applied in visible-blind UV-photo-detectors due to its outstanding optoelectronic properties. It is proved that the MAPbCl3 single crystal is more excellent than its polycrystalline counterpart because of its fewer defects and grain boundaries. When referring to a single crystal, the crystal orientation or crystal structure anisotropy is an inevitable topic, because structure anisotropy can affect or decide the optoelectronic properties of single crystals. In this study, both cubic and triangular prism MAPbCl3 single crystals with (100) and (110) crystallographic planes were successfully grown from mixed solutions. The crystal growth process, crystal structure and optical absorption were investigated. Moreover, by fabricating metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photo-detectors using Au interdigital electrodes on both (100) and (110) planes, the optoelectronic anisotropy was explored by comparing photocurrents, responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity. According to the crystal structure and calculated charge density, the optoelectronic anisotropy in the MAPbCl3 single crystal was revealed.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, especially MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl−, Br− and I−), have gained extensive attention due to their unique optoelectronic properties,1–4 including high carrier mobilities, large absorption coefficients, long and balanced carrier diffusion lengths and direct band gaps.5–8 Recently, both fully inorganic and hybrid perovskites have drawn increasing interest in the fields of lasers, light-emitting diodes and solar cells,9–13 especially in photo-detectors,14–16 most of which adopted polycrystalline films and low-dimensional perovskites.17–19 As we know, owing to the complicated effect caused by grain boundaries, defect densities, crystal grain sizes and surface states, etc., the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of perovskites are not completely understood. In comparison with polycrystalline films and low-dimensional perovskites, a single crystal is deemed to be more suitable for photo-detector fabrication.20 However, the fabrication of photo-detectors on a large scale, which is readily available for polycrystalline perovskites, is extremely challenging for single crystals and has not been achieved until now.21 Therefore, precisely controlling the growth of large-scale single crystals is crucial for optoelectronic applications of perovskites.
As we all know, the crystal structure of a semiconductor material is essential to absorb incident photons and generate electron–hole pairs upon photoexcitation, which is determined by the alternative arrangements of atoms or ions. There is no doubt that the alternative arrangements of atoms vary in a three-dimensional space, namely crystal structure anisotropy, and as a result, the physical and chemical properties vary along the observed directions. The anisotropy of physical properties of single crystals, such as hardness, piezoelectric properties, optoelectronic properties, magnetic properties and thermal properties, has been revealed for ages.22–25 As for perovskites, the anisotropy of optoelectronic properties has been recently referred to. Cho, Leblebici and their co-workers found that both trap state densities and photovoltaic properties of thin MAPbI3 films are facet-dependent, suggesting that crystal anisotropy plays a vital role in photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties.21,26 The anisotropy of optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 single crystals was also reported.27,28 These results indicate that crystal anisotropy plays an important role in the photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties of perovskite single crystals. However, there is still a lack of detailed optoelectronic anisotropy of MAPbCl3 crystals until now. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of MAPbCl3 crystals’ anisotropy on optoelectronic properties.
In this study, large-scale cubic and triangular prism MAPbCl3 single crystals with (100) and (110) crystallographic planes exposed simultaneously were grown from mixed solvents. The detailed growth process, crystal structure and optical properties were discussed as well. According to planar photo-detectors using Au interdigital electrodes, photocurrents, responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D) were performed on both (100) and (110) planes to reveal anisotropic optoelectronic performances.
2. Methods
2.1 Designing the growth of MAPbCl3 single crystals
It was reported that MAPbCl3 single crystals could grow from DMSO solvent by dissolving PbCl2 and CH3NH3Cl.29 In our experiments, PbCl2 and CH3NH3Cl with an equivalent molar ratio (see detailed synthesis and characterization in Fig. S1, ESI†) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio DMF:DMSO = 1:1) at room temperature in quartz vessels. When no visible traces of undissolved salts remained, transparent precursor solutions were obtained. Then the transparent precursor solutions were sealed and maintained at 80 °C for 6–7 days, and small cubic perovskite MAPbCl3 with sizes of 1–2 mm were harvested for seed crystals. Because of reversible temperature solubility of MAPbCl3 in mixed solvents DMF and DMSO, the seed crystals grew larger to be the perfect cubic MAPbCl3 single crystals with sizes of 4–8 mm. In terms of the above steps, large size triangular prism MAPbCl3 single crystals with (100) and (110) crystallographic planes were also grown by using small triangular prism seed crystals.
2.2 Fabrication of planar photo-detectors
To study the different optoelectronic properties between (100) and (110) crystallographic planes of MAPbCl3 single crystals, Au interdigital electrodes were fabricated on each plane to obtain planar photo-detectors. The two planes were well-polished before the fabrication of photo-detectors. In our study, hollow alloy contact pattern masks were laid on both smooth (100) and (110) planes of MAPbCl3 single crystals, and then the sputtering processes were carried out and Au interdigital electrodes were formed on the blank area of the hollowed mask. The bridging gap between the Au conductive electrodes was designed as 150 μm.
2.3 Characterization and measurements
The XRD patterns of powder, (100) and (110) planes of MAPbCl3 single crystals were measured using X-ray diffraction meters (D/Max 2500PC) and the UV via spectrum of MAPbCl3 single crystals was recorded using a UV-2550 spectrometer.
In order to eliminate the effect of an external environment, mainly the effect of light on experimental results, optoelectronic properties were measured using a semiconductor measurement system (Keithley2450, USA) inside a dark space in air at room temperature. A series of photocurrents were obtained by using a laser diode with excitation wavelength of 405 nm as an excitation light source. To explore the anisotropic optoelectronic properties between these two planes, the R, EQE and D were calculated to compare optoelectronic performances.
2.4 Computational details
The charge density map calculation was performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code based on first-principles density-functional theory (DFT). A Perdew–Wang GGA exchange correlation functional was adopted. The electronic wave functions at each k-point were expanded in terms of a plane-wave basis set and an energy cutoff of 600 eV was used. The Monkhorst–Pack grid parameter for k-point sampling was 5 × 5 × 5. The charge density maps were analyzed according to electronic properties within (100) and (110) slices for the MAPbCl3 crystal.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal growth process

Fig. 1(a) presents the schematic illustration of the MAPbCl3 single crystal growth process. The MAPbCl3 single crystal can be easily obtained from a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (1:1 in volume), which endows MAPbCl3 with a reversible temperature solubility character. However, when growing from other volume ratios with mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (DMF:DMSO ≠ 1:1), such as 1:1.2 or 1.2:1, the reversible temperature solubility is inconspicuous and the result was unsatisfactory. To reveal the intrinsic growth mechanism and therefore to realize the controlling growth of large-size MAPbCl3 single crystals with good crystal shapes and high quality, the (100) surface structures were observed using an optical microscope, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). Once the solution concentration is too high, spontaneous crystals are prone to occur and the seed single crystal grows slowly, which ultimately leads to the appearance of plenty of fragmentary crystals. On the other hand, we observed that a multitude of microscopic two-dimensional crystal plates were preserved simultaneously. These two-dimensional crystal plates are supposed to originate from a two-dimensional nucleus. This growth mechanism makes the growth rate along the [001] direction quite slow, and the concentrations of precursor solutions should be carefully controlled to match the growth temperature.

According to the growth mechanism of the MAPbCl3 single crystal, by finely tuning solution concentrations and growth temperature, large size and high quality single crystals were easily prepared. We found that a 1.2 mol L−1 precursor solution under 80 °C is more suitable and easier controllable. Fig. 1(d) and (e) displays the photos of MAPbCl3 single crystals with (100) and (110) crystallographic planes. Apparently, using small cubic and triangular prism seed crystals, MAPbCl3 can be controlled to grow as perfect cubic and triangular prism shaped single crystals. This suggests that MAPbCl3 can be designed to grow with various crystallographic planes exposed using special shaped seed crystals. Moreover, the large triangular prism single crystals with rigid (100) and (110) crystallographic planes exposed provide a convenient surface to fabricate planar photo-detectors.
3.2 Crystal structure and optical properties
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of ground crystals reveal that MAPbCl3 belongs to a pure perovskite cubic crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 2(a). By fitting the XRD data, the space group is assigned to be Pmm, and the unit cell parameters are calculated to be a = b = c = 5.675 Å, in good agreement with previous reported data.29,30Fig. 2(b) and (c) provide the XRD patterns of (100) and (110) planes measured on MAPbCl3 single crystals. By scanning both (100) and (110) planes, a series of peaks appeared, corresponding to [100] and [110] crystallographic planes, respectively. From the viewpoint of crystallography, these results indicate that MAPbCl3 single crystals exhibit a perfect crystalline integrity for both (100) and (110) facets. The detailed full width at half maximum (FWHM) is shown in Fig. 2(d), and such a narrow FWHM for the (100) and (110) planes proves that MAPbCl3 single crystals possess excellent crystallinity.

The optical absorption curve is shown in Fig. 2(e), in which the absorption edge of the MAPbCl3 single crystal is located around 436 nm, implying the potential application of the MAPbCl3 single crystal as a visible-blind UV-photodetector. The band gap of the MAPbCl3 single crystal obtained from the fitting line of Fig. 2(f) is 2.84 eV, which is smaller than 3.11 eV of the polycrystalline thin film30 and 2.97 eV of the single crystal.29 The band gap of the perovskite single crystal becomes smaller than thin films and is also revealed in MAPbI3, which is attributed to excition absorption or indirect band-gap absorption. Similarly, the smaller band gap in the MAPbCl3 single crystal than in thin films is caused by the same reason, which suggests that the MAPbCl3 single crystal is more beneficial to optoelectronic applications because of the expansion of the active wavelength band.28,31,32
3.3 Anisotropy of the optoelectronic properties in the MAPbCl3 single crystal
The anisotropic optoelectronic properties of MAPbCl3 single crystals are depicted by comparing photocurrents, responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D), using planar photo-detectors on (100) and (110) planes of the MAPbCl3 single crystal with Au interdigital electrodes. Fig. 3(a) displays the photo-detector structure based on MAPbCl3 single crystals. In our study, photocurrent curves were obtained under various illumination powers by using a 405 nm laser diode with power varying from 5 to 20 mW for both (100) and (110) planes, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively. The dark current based on the (100) plane is 7.9 × 10−8 A, in contrast to 3.0 × 10−8 A on the (110) plane at an applied voltage of 10 V. The larger dark current on the (100) plane than the (110) plane implied that the (100) plane possesses a stronger charge transportation capacity. Moreover, we noticed that photocurrents of the (100) plane at different applied voltages increased slightly than those of the (110) plane. After the logarithm operating towards the ordinate of Fig. 3(b) and (c) data, different curves are displayed in the insets of Fig. 3(b) and (c). We can obtain that the tendencies of photocurrents show mainly linear features at a lower voltage region, which was considered as Ohmic regions. Beyond the Ohmic region, the trap-filled limit (TFL) regime dominated the relationship between the voltage and currents at a higher voltage region. Apparently, the TFL regime for the (110) device occurs at a higher voltage than that for the (100) device, suggesting different trap states in the (110) and (100) planes. According to ref. 33, such a difference in the trap states in the (110) and (100) planes can bring a great difference in the transient photo-response, which will be discussed below.
 Fig. 3  (a) Photo-detector structure; (b and c) photocurrent curves of both (100) and (110) planes respectively; insets represent the photocurrent curves of both (100) and (110) planes after logarithm operation. 
The responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D) of photo-detectors based on the MAPbCl3 single crystal on the (100) and (110) planes are presented in Fig. 4(a)–(d). The R, EQE and D can be calculated by using: (1) (2) (3)

I
pc and IDark are the photocurrents under a different applied voltage and the dark current, respectively. P is the irradiation power density. S is the effective area of the photo-detector. C stands for the speed of light and λ is the wavelength of the light source.34,35 According to the above formula, the photocurrent conversion abilities of our photo-detectors based on the (100) and (110) planes in MAPbCl3 single crystals were analyzed.
The highest values of the responsivity and EQE of the photo-detector on the (100) plane were 0. 60 mA W−1 and 0.18% respectively under 10 V bias when the irradiation power was 20 mW. In contrast, they were 0. 62 mA W−1 and 0.19% on the (110) plane under the same conditions. It seems that there were no conspicuous differences in R and EQE for different plane photo-detectors. However, the variation tendencies of R and EQE for different plane photo-detectors are totally different, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). For example, both R and EQE for the (100) plane photo-detector under 5 mW illumination are higher than other illumination powers below 5 V, while they change to be lower when the applied voltage was above 5 V. This character happens at 9 V for the (110) plane photo-detector. We can see that R/EQE/D values obtained at a low light intensity are larger at a low voltage, but lower at a high voltage than those values obtained at a high light intensity. According to ref. 36 and 37, this phenomenon can be explained. Under a lower voltage region, the phenomenon that R/EQE/D values decrease with increasing illumination power may be related to a higher carrier recombination upon a higher illumination. However, a larger bias voltage can promote charge transport and minimize carrier recombination. Therefore, the R/EQE/D values increase with increasing illumination power. The results give us evidence that the carrier transport mechanisms of the (100) and (110) planes are different under different applied voltages, and further imply the anisotropic optoelectronic properties in the MAPbCl3 single crystal. Based on R data, the detectivity of MAPbCl3 single crystal photo-detectors was calculated according to formula (3) and is displayed in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The detectivity is similar to R and suggests anisotropic optoelectronic properties as well.
The switching feature is another important parameter to compare the anisotropy of the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbCl3 single crystal, which is revealed by the time-dependent photocurrent measurements at various applied voltages with an illumination wavelength of 405 nm. Fig. 5(a) and (b) represents the five continuous on–off circles and the detailed response time under different applied voltages of the photo-detector devices on (100) and (110) planes. The detailed response features are displayed in Fig. S2, ESI.† It is clear that the variation tendencies of photocurrent based on different planes are totally different. The photocurrents for the (100) plane photo-detector show an obvious upward tendency when light illumination turns on, whereas the photocurrents for the (110) plane photo-detector exhibit a steady state. On the other hand, when light illumination turns off, the currents for the (100) plane photo-detectors are at almost the same values under different applied voltages. However, the currents for the (110) plane photo-detector show increasing features under different applied voltages when light illumination turns off. Moreover, the highest on/off ratio is about 111 under 5 V bias for the (100) plane device, while it decreases to about 10.7 for the (110) plane device. This also suggests the anisotropy play crucial roles in the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbCl3 single crystal.

3.4 Discussion
As we know that single crystal is constructed by repeated arrangements of atoms and the arrangements vary in different crystal orientations, which exhibit crystal structure anisotropy. We believe that the anisotropy of the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbCl3 single crystal originates from the structure anisotropy. Under a given bias voltage, once the electron–hole pairs were generated, their migration to a conduction band or a valence band decides the optoelectronic properties. To reveal the influence of the crystal structure of (100) and (110) planes on optoelectronic anisotropy, the charge density maps corresponding to the VBM and the CBM were calculated and are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Apparently, the charge density for the (100) plane is higher than that for (110) plane, which is attributed to a higher distribution density of MA+ and [PbCl6]− on the (100) plane. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6, the dispersion of charge distribution in the VBM and CBM of the (100) plane is wider than that of (110) plane, implying electron excitation energies in the (100) plane to be in a wider range, and thus the photocurrent of the (100) plane is slightly higher than that of the (110) plane. The detailed alternating [PbCl6]− and MA+ arrays in both (100) and (110) planes is displayed in Fig. S3, ESI,† from which we can see that the [PbCl6]− and MA+ arrangements in the two planes are different, which are also depicted in previous reports.38,39
 Fig. 6  (a and b) Charge density maps of the (100) and (110) planes of the MAPbCl3 single crystal in the VBM and the CBM, respectively. 
In addition, migration of MA+ and Cl− ions in the hybrid perovskite MAPbCl3 may be intrinsic and make MAPbCl3 a mixed conductor.40 First of all, the much stronger ion migration in a mixed halide perovskite might be caused by the lattice mismatch or thermal defects. A higher distribution density of MA+ and [PbCl6]− in the (100) plane may provide the high probability of lattice mismatch or thermal defects. Being different from electron–hole carriers, the contribution of MA+ and Cl− ion carriers to the photocurrent is time and voltage dependent, which might cause current hysteresis.41,42 The increasing photocurrents depicted in Fig. 5(a) give clear evidence that the MA+ and Cl− ion carriers make greater contributions to current, because the migrations of ions are usually more difficult than electrons and holes owing to their larger volumes in the crystal lattice. Whereas the photocurrents involving less MA+ and Cl− ions carriers in the (110) plane exhibit a steady state. Moreover, trap states, including shallow trap states and mid-gap states, are also believed to play roles in time-dependent photocurrent measurements. From Fig. 3, we can see that the trap states of the (100) plane occurred at a relatively low voltage than the (110) plane. According to the formula (4),28 the trap density of the (100) plane is lower than that of the (110) plane. Therefore, the influence of trap density on the photocurrents of the (100) plane is less than that of the (110) plane and the photocurrents of the (100) plane show an increasing feature. Overall, the time and voltage-dependent photocurrents present the anisotropy in different crystallographic planes of MAPbCl3 single crystals. (4)where Nt is the trap density, l is the distance between the neighboring contact fingers, e is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity.
4. Conclusions
By optimizing the mixed solvent ratios of DMSO and DMF and the concentrations of precursor solutions, suitable growth conditions of MAPbCl3 single crystals were explored. Both cubic and triangular prism MAPbCl3 single crystals with (100) and (110) planes were successfully grown by controlling seed crystal orientations. To deeply reveal the anisotropy of the optoelectronic properties of MAPbCl3 single crystals, MSM photo-detectors with Au interdigital electrodes were fabricated on the (100) and (110) planes. The corresponding optoelectronic properties were compared by measuring the photocurrents under various voltages. The results provide us with evidence that the carrier transport mechanisms of the (100) and (110) planes are different under different applied voltages, and further imply the anisotropic optoelectronic properties in the MAPbCl3 single crystal.
