    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 24th April 2023AbstractTiO2 photoelectrodes modified with organic dyes with pyridine anchoring groups are prepared, which are used as photoanodes of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for efficient water reduction with high photocurrent density and stability in aqueous solutions. Vigorous H2 generation with a production rate of around 250 μmol h−1 is realized with a photoanode of an active area of 5 × 5 cm2.
Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy is considered to be one of the promising ways to solve the energy issues.1–3 Among the known methods, molecular dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPECs) have been studied actively due to the following advantages: (1) in the DSPEC, hydrogen and oxygen are generated at the photocathode and photoanode, respectively, making it easy to collect them with a high purity; (2) the two half-reactions of water splitting are based on two independent electrodes, which enables the active material of each electrode to be developed independently; (3) the uses of molecular dyes and catalysts allow us to sufficiently modify the structures and activities of the photoanodes/cathodes at low costs.4–10
The construction of a DSPEC starts with the adsorption of molecular dyes and catalysts on metal oxide surfaces to form a photoanode and/or photocathode, which allows the semiconductor substrate to efficiently absorb and utilize visible light. This step is typically realized with the aid of anchor groups such as carboxylic or phosphonic groups.11 The stability of the resulting composite film depends heavily on the anchor groups of the dye molecules. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the carboxylic or phosphonic groups have been proven to be suitable anchors to form stable films.12 This is because DSSCs are usually fabricated with organic media or solid electrolytes.12 In contrast, the stability of molecular photoelectrodes with these anchor groups is usually poor under the conditions for water splitting.11 In addition to the stability issue, the electron-injection efficiency from the dyes into the semiconductor under different pH environments is strongly affected by the anchor groups used.11,13 It is of great significance to develop stable and efficient photoelectrodes with functional molecular dyes and catalysts.13
In addition to the carboxylic or phosphonic group, pyridine is another useful anchor group to immobilize molecules. Molecular wires with pyridine terminal groups have been examined in single molecular conductance measurements.14,15 Considering the weak interaction of the metal electrode with a single pyridine group, organic molecules functionalized with multiple pyridine groups have been synthesized for the fabrication of stable films by concerted multi-pyridine-metal interactions.16,17 Pyridine groups have also been introduced as the anchors of ruthenium complex photosensitizers for the preparation of a photoanode.18 The DSPEC with this photoanode operated successfully with a Pt counter electrode reducing water into H2 and it possessed good stability in aqueous media. In addition, the photoanode functionalized with a pyridine-anchored ruthenium water oxidation catalyst was reported to show better stability with respect to that with a phosphonate anchor.19 Stimulated by these results and our previous work on the preparation of molecular films with the multi-pyridine adsorption strategy,20 we present here the first construction of stable DSPECs with a pyridine-anchored organic dye photoanode, in which the Pt counter electrode reduces water efficiently (Fig. 1).

The pyrene-based organic dyes, APyr, DAPyr and TAPyr (Fig. 1b), containing a different number of pyridine-terminated arylamine side groups, have been readily prepared by one-step C–N coupling reactions (see details in the ESI†). In order to decrease the steric hindrance between the arylamine group and the pyrene core, these molecules take a nonplanar three dimensional configuration (see the DFT-optimized structures in Fig. S1, ESI†). The terminal pyridine groups are introduced as anchors to immobilize the dyes on the metal oxide surface through the interaction between the sp2 pyridine nitrogen atom and metal ions. The absorption bands at around 360 nm (Fig. 2a) are assigned to the n → π* electronic transition from amine to pyridine groups, and the absorptions in the visible light region are mainly caused by the nπ → π* electronic transitions of the admixture process from amine/pyrene to pyrene (see DFT and TDDFT results in Fig. S2, ESI†). From APyr to DAPyr and TAPyr, the lower-energy absorption band edge expands gradually to the longer wavelength region. Strong visible absorption bands are observed with ε of 3.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 480 nm for TAPyr and 3.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 425 nm for DAPyr, respectively, making these molecules potential visible-light dyes.

(b) Normalized intensity at the maximum absorption peaks of the fabricated photoanode FTO/TiO2/dye versus the immersion time in the dye solution. (c) XPS (N 1s signal) of the FTO/TiO2/dye electrode. (d) The decrease of the absorption intensity at the maximum absorption peaks after the FTO/TiO2/dye electrodes are immersed in acid or alkali solution for a period of time. 
In order to prepare photoanodes for DSPECs, FTO/TiO2 electrodes were fabricated using a screen-printing and high-temperature sintering technique to spread the mesoporous TiO2 over the conductive substrate FTO glass. The active area and thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film are approximately 1.0 cm2 and 5 μm, respectively. The immobilization of the dye molecules on the electrode is readily conducted by dipping the fresh-cleaned FTO/TiO2 film into the respective dye/CH2Cl2 solution. The adsorption reached saturation within 5 min for all dyes, as monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 2b and Fig. S3, ESI†). The obtained FTO/TiO2/dye films possessed a significant enhancement in absorption above 400 nm compared with the bare FTO/TiO2 (Fig. S3, ESI†). These new absorptions have a similar profile to those of the corresponding dyes in solution, indicating that the dye molecules are successfully immobilized on FTO/TiO2. The surface coverage of APyr, DAPyr and TAPyr on FTO/TiO2 is estimated to be 6.4, 2.6, and 2.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively, according to the molar extinction coefficient in solution and the absorption enhancement of the FTO/TiO2 film. The adsorption of the dyes on TiO2 was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The peaks at 398.9 eV are assigned to the N 1s electron of the sp3 amine nitrogen atoms of the dye molecules (Fig. 2c). The intensity enhancements at around 400.0 eV are attributed to the sp2 pyridine nitrogen atoms. The wide peak width suggests that some of the pyridine groups interact with TiO2. The exact configuration of the dye molecules on TiO2 is, however, not clear. The nonplanar three-dimensional configurations of these dyes are believed to be beneficial for their immobilization.
In the previously reported works, TiO2/dye films with the commonly used carboxylic and phosphonic anchors suffer from poor stability in moderate to strong acidic and basic aqueous solutions.11 In contrast, the pyridine anchor groups we adopt here are proven to have strong chemical stabilities under these conditions. We have soaked the FTO/TiO2 films modified with APyr, DAPyr, or TAPyr in pH = 2.88 HOAc and pH = 10.28 Na2CO3 aqueous solution, respectively, to verify their stability. The decrease degree of the absorption intensity of these films before and after soaking reflects the film stability (Fig. 2d and Fig. S4, ESI†). The films with DAPyr and TAPyr only showed a little decrease of absorbance after soaking in either acidic or basic solutions for more than 10 h, suggesting their high stability. In contrast, the film with APyr showed poor stability, as indicated by the significant decrease in absorbance after soaking even for 1 h. These results demonstrate that the presence of multiple terminal pyridine groups is beneficial for enhancing the film stability through concerted multipyridine-metal oxide interactions.17,20
A DSPEC is constructed with FTO/TiO2/DAPyr film as the photoanode in a pH = 5 HOAc/NaOAc buffer with 0.1 M NaClO4 as the electrolyte. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode are used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. In addition, 10 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is added as the sacrificial electron donor. Under the irradiation of visible light (λ > 400 nm, 600 mW cm−2), a remarkable anodic photocurrent is generated with a density of ∼1500 μA cm−2 on the FTO/TiO2/DAPyr photoanode at 0 V applied bias (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 3a). Almost no photocurrent enhancement under irradiation is observed with the bare FTO/TiO2 electrode. This suggests that the photocurrent generated on FTO/TiO2/DAPyr is caused by the electron injection from the photo-excited DAPyr (DAPyr*) to the conduction band of TiO2, leading to the generation of electron oxidized species of DAPyr (DAPyr+). When the sacrificial electron donor EDTA is absent, the light-induced transient current quickly decays to a rather low level, which is caused by the backward electron transfer from TiO2 to the dye molecule. These results suggested that the reduction of DAPyr+ by EDTA is more favourable, in dynamics, than by the backward electron transfer. At the Pt counter electrode surface, gas bubbles are observed to be generated during the photolysis in the presence of EDTA. The gas is proved to be H2 by gas chromatography analysis (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicating that protons are reduced into H2 by the electrons from the photoanode. The redox potential of TiO2(e−) is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 on the Pt surface. Continuous occurrence of the oxidation of EDTA and the reduction of protons results in a high and stable current, which is triggered by the successive photoexcitation of DAPyr (Fig. 1a).

(b) Photoelectrochemical LSV scans from −0.4 to +0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl conducted on different photoanodes. (c) IPCE spectra of different DSPECs irradiated by a xenon lamp equipped with a bandpass filter of the indicated wavelength. (d) Photocurrent density of different photoanodes under continuous irradiation (1100 mW cm−2). The electrode area is 1 × 1 cm2 for all. 
Photoelectrochemical linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans from −0.4 to +0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl were conducted on the DSPECs (Fig. 3b). The net photocurrent reached the maximum value at around a low bias voltage of 0.1 V for the cells with TAPyr or DAPyr and 0 V for that with APyr, respectively. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of these PECs were measured (Fig. 3c and Fig. S6, ESI†). The maximum IPCE of 4.9% was obtained with DAPyr under irradiation at 400 nm. The PEC of TAPyr exhibited an IPCE of 2.5% at 500 nm, which was higher than those of DAPyr and APyr with weak absorption at this wavelength. An experiment of transient current responses to on–off cycles of light illumination is performed on the PEC with DAPyr (Fig. S5, ESI†). The DSPEC maintains a high photocurrent density for twenty illumination cycles. Besides, the extent of the instant current decay after turning on the light (the spike peaks in Fig. S5, ESI†) is much lower than the subsequent steady-state photocurrent. The former is considered to be mainly caused by backward electron transfer,21 and it gradually decreases to a low level after numerous on–off cycles. These results suggest that the process of backward electron transfer makes a minor contribution to the photocurrent.
Electrolysis experiments under continuous irradiation were conducted on the DSPECs with a photoanode of APyr, DAPyr, and TAPyr, respectively (Fig. 3d). The photocurrent density of the cells with TAPyr and DAPyr remains higher than 1500 μA cm−2 after irradiation for 30 min. The photocurrent density of FTO/TiO2/TAPyr continues to rise after the instant reduction at the initial stage, and reaches about 2100 μA cm−2 at 30 min. This performance is higher than the maximum value generated on the previously reported photoanode modified with pyridine-anchored Ru photosensitizer (around 1200 μA cm−2).18 The long-term light irradiation is expected to increase the temperature of the electrode, which would be beneficial for the forward electron transfer and thus improve the photocurrent of the FTO/TiO2/TAPyr electrode. This phenomenon was not observed with APyr and DAPyr because the photoelectrodes with these two dyes have insufficient photostability upon long-term irritation. However, further studies are certainly needed to clarify this difference. The absorption spectra of the electrodes with APyr and DAPyr show significant changes after photolysis for 30 min (Fig. S7, ESI†). The absorption intensity in the shorter-wavelength decreases distinctly and an enhanced absorption in the longer-wavelength appears, as a result of the dye detachment and oxidation. However, the FTO/TiO2/TAPyr electrode displays less obvious changes under the same conditions, reflecting the high photo-durability of TAPyr.
The H2 gases generated on the Pt counter electrode were collected and measured to be 167, 330, and 442 μL for the above DSPECs of APyr, DAPyr, and TAPyr, respectively, after continuous illumination for 30 min. The corresponding Faraday efficiencies are calculated to be 99%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, suggesting the high efficiency and specific selectivity in the electrolysis reaction (Table S1, ESI†). This means that the photocurrent enhancement after the addition of sacrificial reagent EDTA discussed above is almost entirely caused by the proton reduction process. Among the three dyes, TAPyr exhibits the best H2 production activity, which can be attributed to its wide range visible-light absorption and the high film stability as a result of the multi-pyridine anchoring adsorption.
Encouraged by the high photocurrent density with TAPyr, a large-area FTO/TiO2/TAPyr photoanode (5 × 5 cm2, Fig. 4) was prepared by soaking the substrate in TAPyr/CH2Cl2 solution for 10 min and then washing with CH2Cl2. A khaki film was acquired, with which a large photocurrent of over 10 mA was generated when it was used as the DSPEC photoanode. Vigorous H2 generation was observed at the counter Pt electrode when the photoanode was irradiated (see the ESI†). The average H2 generation rate is estimated to be around 250 μmol h−1 in the first min, assuming a quantitative Faraday efficiency. The generated photocurrent does not show a linear dependence on the geometric surface area (Fig. 3avs. Fig. 4b). This is mainly because the active area of the large photoanode was not sufficiently irradiated due to the smaller irradiation spot of the xenon lamp used. In addition, the uneven optical power density and increasing current loss in the large-scale photoanode may contribute to this discrepancy.

In summary, organic dyes with pyridine anchors are used to prepare photoanodes, with which DSPECs are constructed for efficient water reduction in H2. The dye molecules can be readily synthesized. The dye adsorption is achieved in a few min and the fabricated FTO/TiO2/dye films show high stability in both acid and alkali aqueous solutions. A high stable photocurrent density of 2100 μA cm−2 has been acquired in electrolysis experiments with the tetra-substituted dye TAPyr under visible-light irradiation. These DSPECs show excellent durability upon continuous light illumination. Vigorous H2 production is observed when a relatively large-area photoanode is used. In view of these characteristics, the pyridine anchor strategy combined with organic dyes is considered to be a simple and low-cost way to sensitize photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical cells. Though the current work only describes the H2 production with the aid of EDTA, further studies by incorporating a suitable water-oxidation catalyst on the organic-dye-modified photoanode would be possible for water splitting without the sacrificial reagent.
