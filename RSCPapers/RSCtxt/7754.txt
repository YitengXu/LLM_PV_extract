    , Accepted 25th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractThe selection of interfacial layers in organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucial for enhancing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. PEDOT:PSS is the most widely used hole transport layer (HTL) for high-performance OSCs; however, device stability is often severely degraded, owing to the strong acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS. Herein, we report a new efficient HTL system comprising an oligo(aniline) host (PBD) and an aryl sulfonic acid dopant (PFBSA), and demonstrate its use in high-performance OSC devices. Desirable properties like solvent orthogonality, high transmittance, excellent conductivity, and appropriate work function establish the suitability of the PBD:PFBSA film as an HTL. Thus, a PBD:PFBSA HTL is employed in the PM6:Y6-based OSC system to achieve a PCE of 15.24%, which is comparable to that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL-based OSC. Importantly, the PBD:PFBSA HTL-based OSC exhibits significantly higher device stability than the PEDOT:PSS HTL. We investigate the film properties of the PBD:PFBSA HTL to elucidate the origin of the superior device stability. Our results highlight the successful design of a protonic acid-doped oligo(aniline)-based material and its practical application as an effective HTL for OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are recognized as a promising alternative for pollutant-free and renewable energy sources owing to their superior potential, including mechanical flexibility, tunable semi-transparency, and large-scale production ability.1–7 The rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs beyond 17–18% is attributed to the recent development of efficient polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors.8–17 To enhance the PCE beyond 20%, the concurrent optimization of the active materials and device engineering is required.18–21 Importantly, the device stabilities of the OSCs, including the mechanical, thermal and photo stabilities, are now the most essential issues for their commercialization. Interfacial layers, including hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs), are crucial for determining the PCE and stability of the OSCs. To ensure efficient extraction and collection of photogenerated charge carriers from the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer to the electrodes, interfacial layers are inevitably required for forming an ohmic contact between the BHJ layer and electrodes.22,23 Notably, these interlayers are the prerequisites for enhancing the device stability by preventing direct physical/chemical interactions between the active layer and electrodes as well as the diffusion of oxygen and water molecules into the active layer.23–25 Based on these considerations, different organic ETLs, such as NDI-NI, PNDIT-F3N-Br, and PDINN have been developed and widely applied in high-performance BHJ OSCs.26–28 However, studies on the development of efficient HTL materials are relatively lacking.
The conjugated polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), has been the benchmark HTL in OSCs with a conventional device structure. Unfortunately, the PEDOT:PSS film has distinct disadvantages, including strong acidity and hygroscopicity. The acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS film causes corrosion of indium tin oxide (ITO), significantly decreasing the PCE during the operation and storage of the OSCs. In addition, the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS permits the migration of water and oxygen molecules into the active layer.29–32 Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative HTLs to circumvent these issues. Toward this end, different types of organic HTLs, such as conjugated polyelectrolytes, cross-linkable molecules, and self-assembled monolayer materials have been reported.33–37 In particular, aniline-based materials such as poly(aniline)s (PANIs) are an attractive class of organic HTLs owing to their substantial conductivity, transparency, and solvent orthogonality.38,39
Aniline-based HTLs (ani-HTLs) can be categorized into two groups—protonic-acid-doped and self-doped—depending on the doping method used. Zhao et al. demonstrated the use of an ultrathin (1.3 nm) layer of water-soluble hydrochloric acid-doped PANI in OSCs. The device based on this HTL with PBDTTT-EFT:PC71BM as the active layer exhibited a high PCE of 9.05%, which is the best PCE reported to date for devices employing protonic acid-doped ani-HTLs.40 Recently, Zeng et al. reported poly(diphenylamine-4-sulfonic acid) (PDAS), a self-doped water-soluble ani-HTL with an exceedingly high in-plane conductivity of 7.75 × 10−2 S cm−1 and low acidity.41 The PDAS HTL was successfully applied to small molecule acceptor-based OSCs achieving a high PCE of 16.2%, which was comparable to that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL. These results suggest the potential of ani-HTLs in OSCs. However, these materials feature certain drawbacks; for example, most of the ani-HTLs, including those discussed above, were prepared from in situ polymerization, thus hindering the precise control of their electrical properties and possibly lowering the reproducibility of OSC performance.40–42 In addition, for protonic acid-doped ani-HTLs, unsubstituted PANIs are typically used as the host material. Due to the lack of solubilizing groups and high molecular weight of these unsubstituted PANIs, their processability is limited.43,44 While the incorporation of the solubilizing substituents into the polymer backbone can alleviate the issue of solubility, this process typically accompanies poor electrical conductivity.45 An alternative approach for addressing the limitations associated with ani-HTLs is the utilization of oligo(aniline)s (OANIs) that possess molecular weights below a few hundreds of grams per mole. These molecules exhibit high solubility in common organic solvents without compromising their electronic properties. In addition, their syntheses can be achieved by facile synthetic routes, ensuring batch-to-batch uniformity and reproducible device performance. To the best of our knowledge, OANIs have not been reported for OSC applications.
In this study, we report the development of a new protonic acid-doped, OANI-based HTL system comprising N1,N1′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(N4-phenylbenzene-1,4-diamine) (PBD) as the host and 4,4′-((perfluoro-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(naphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid) (PFBSA) as the dopant. The PBD:PFBSA system satisfies the important requirements for the efficient HTL, such as simple preparation, favorable charge extraction/transfer, suitable work function (WF), and solvent resistance during the solution processing of the active layer. The host:dopant ratio is tuned to determine the optimal conditions for the fabrication of the most efficient PBD:PFBSA HTL. In particular, the PBD:PFBSA HTL with an optimal doping ratio of 1:1 is found to exhibit higher transmittance, appropriate WF, and higher out-of-plane (OOP) conductivity than the reference PEDOT:PSS HTL. As a result, using PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL, a high PCE of 15.24% is achieved in the OSC based on poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6). The obtained PCE is comparable to that of the reference OSC device with the PEDOT:PSS HTL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value of PCE obtained for OSCs using protonic acid-doped ani-HTLs. Importantly, the OSC device with the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL exhibits better device stability in air than the PEDOT:PSS HTL. This feature is mainly attributed to the enhanced moisture resistance and the suppressed degradation of the ITO, induced by the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL. Our results highlight the potential of OANI-based HTLs for constructing OSCs with high PCEs and enhanced device stability.

Synthesis


N
1,N1′-(1,4-Phenylene)-bis(N4-phenylbenzene-1,4-diamine) (PBD). 
PBD was synthesized by following the modified literature procedure.48 In a 500 mL two-neck round-bottom flask, 1,4-phenylenediamine 1 (2.0 g, 18.5 mmol) was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 250 mL of toluene under the protection of inert gas. Then, tetrabutyl orthotitanate (37.7 g, 110.9 mmol) as a dehydration condensing agent was added, followed by stirring at 70 °C for 30 min. In the next step, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine 2 (8.2 g, 44.4 mmol) was added to the flask, and the reaction was vigorously stirred at an elevated temperature of 100 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was filtered and the resulting filtrate was washed successively with toluene and diethyl ether, and dried to obtain silver colored crystals. This crude product was re-dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and reduced with an excess amount of phenylhydrazine. Then, it was recrystallized from isopropyl alcohol (IPA), followed by drying under vacuum to obtain white powder as the final product (4.2 g, 70%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) 7.72 (s, 2H), 7.56 (s, 2H), 7.10 (t, 4H), 6.95–6.85 (m, 16H), 6.63 (t, 2H).


4,4′-((Perfluoro-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(naphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid) (PFBSA). 
PFBSA was synthesized by following the procedure modified from the previous literature.49 In a 250 mL two-necked round-bottom flask, a solid mixture of sodium 1-naphthol-3,6-disulfonate 3 (11.5 g, 32.9 mmol) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (4.3 g, 31.4 mmol) was added and dried under vacuum, then dissolved in 100 mL of DMF under inert gas. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Then, decafluorobiphenyl 4 (5.0 g, 14.9 mmol) was added to the flask in one portion, and the solution was maintained at 100 °C for 6 h with vigorous stirring. After the completion of reaction, the solution was cooled to room temperature, and then it was transferred to a 1 L one-neck round-bottom flask, followed by adding additional 500 mL of DMF. This solution was then stirred for 90 min at room temperature in order to re-dissolve PFBSA that had precipitated out. In the next step, this solution was filtered to remove K2CO3 residues, and then the solvent was evaporated by using a rotary evaporator. 100 mL of methanol (MeOH) was added to the dried solid to remove the remaining impurities. After 30 min of stirring, filtrate was collected by filtration and MeOH was evaporated.
The filtrate was then re-dissolved by adding DI water, and the resulting solution was ion-exchanged by column chromatography using AmberLite HPR650 H cation-exchange resin as the stationary phase. The fraction at or below pH 1 (monitored by pH paper) was collected, and water was evaporated under reduced pressure by a rotary evaporator. The mono-substituted by-product was then removed by the purification using Biotage reversed-phase automated column chromatography with the gradient eluent of DI water and MeOH. The main product was fractionated from 100% DI water eluent, and acquired after the removal of solvent, yielding light brown powder (3.4 g, 25%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) 8.28 (d, 2H), 8.24 (s, 2H), 8.02 (s, 2H), 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.19 (s, 2H).

Device fabrications
To investigate the PBD:PFBSA HTLs in the OSCs, conventional-type devices were fabricated with the device structure of indium tin oxide PFB:PFBSA or PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. First, the ITO substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication using the solvent order of acetone, DI water, and IPA, then dried in the oven at 80 °C for 40 min. The cleaned ITO glasses were then plasma-treated for 10 min before depositing HTLs. For the PEDOT:PSS HTL, the Heraeus CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083 solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 3000 revolutions per min (rpm) for 40 s. The as-cast films were thermally treated at 165 °C for 20 min. For the PBD:PFBSA HTL, the solutions were prepared by the blending of solid materials based on their designated molar ratio of PBD and PFBSA in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent under stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The solutions were then filtered by a PTFE 0.45 μm syringe filter before using. After that, the obtained solutions were deposited on ITO substrates by spin-coating for 60 s at 4000 rpm. The films were annealed on a hot plate at 90 °C for 15 min and 250 °C for 10 min, respectively. The temperature of the hot plate was monitored using a contact-type surface thermometer. The coating and annealing processes of both HTLs were conducted in ambient conditions, and then the resulting samples were transferred into a glovebox under nitrogen atmosphere for the subsequent fabrication processes. For the PM6:Y6 active layer, the blend solution (1:1.2 of PM6:Y6 weight ratio; 13.5 mg mL−1 of total concentration in chloroform) with 0.5 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) additive, was prepared and stirred for 2 h at 55 °C. The solution was then stirred for 1 h at 40 °C prior to spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The spin-coated active layer was treated at 100 °C for 5 min to optimize the blend morphology. For the PBDB-T:N2200 active layer, the blend solution (1.5:1 of PBDB-T:N2200 weight ratio; 13 mg mL−1 of total concentration in chlorobenzene) with 0.5 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, was stirred for 4 h at 80 °C. The film was produced by spin-casting the solution at 2500 rpm for 60 s. The PBDB-T:N2200 film was used without any thermal treatment. The substrates were then kept in a high-vacuum chamber (less than 10−6 torr) for 2 h to ensure residual solvent removal. PDINN was dissolved in MeOH with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 by stirring at 25 °C for 1 h. The PDINN solution was then spin-coated onto the active layer film at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The samples were kept in a high-vacuum chamber for additional 30 min. Then, 120 nm thick Ag layer was deposited by thermal evaporation as the top electrode in the OSC device.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of host and dopant
The chemical structures of phenyl/phenyl-capped aniline tetramer (PBD) and perfluorobiphenyl-based sulfonic acid (PFBSA) are shown in Fig. 1. A system of doped OANIs was designed by ensuring the requirements for efficient HTL and high synthetic reproducibility. PBD was chosen as the host, owing to its high solubility in organic solvents, which enables facile solution processability. PBD is the smallest repeating unit of PANI, which retains the chemical features and beneficial electrical properties of PANI.50 However, small-sized OANIs typically exhibit highly crystalline properties, which may prevent the formation of a smooth film required for the good interfacial contact.51 Therefore, the choice of dopants for aniline-based materials is critical. We hypothesized that using dopants with relatively large molecular sizes can alleviate the high crystallinity of OANIs.52 PFBSA was chosen as the dopant due to its large molecular size.49 Furthermore, the presence of fluorine atoms in PFBSA can make the HTL hydrophobic, preventing the penetration of moisture from the ambient environment and enhancing the stability of the OSCs. Thus, PBD and PFBSA were selected as components of the HTL.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic routes for (a) host PBD and (b) dopant PFBSA. 
The synthetic routes for PBD and PFBSA are shown in Fig. 1. The detailed procedure is described in the Experimental section. PBD was synthesized via the condensation reaction of 1,4-phenylenediamine with 4-hydroxydiphenylamine in the presence of tetrabutyl orthotitanate as the condensation agent.48 The crude product was further reduced by an excess amount of phenylhydrazine to obtain the pure leucoemeraldine form of PBD. PFBSA was prepared through the nucleophilic substitution reaction of decafluorobiphenyl by sodium 1-naphthol-3,6-disulfonate with K2CO3 as the base.49 Following this, the crude sodium sulfonate salt (PFBSA Na) underwent an ion exchange reaction using a cation exchange gel resin with sulfonic acid (–SO3H) as the functional group. Briefly, PBD and PFBSA were purified by recrystallization and reverse phase column chromatography, respectively. The detailed structural characterizations of PBD and PFBSA are shown in Fig. S1–S4.† PBD is soluble in a wide range of non-polar to polar solvents including toluene, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane, acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, DMF, DMAc, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).50 In comparison, PFBSA is selectively soluble in polar solvents, including MeOH, DMF, DMAc, and DMSO. Furthermore, the thermal properties of PBD and PFBSA were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). PBD exhibited a crystallization peak (Tc) at 238 °C with a very high enthalpy value (ΔHc) of 97.8 J g−1, indicating its strong crystalline behavior (Fig. S5a†).51,53 In contrast, PFBSA exhibited no crystallization peak, as shown in Fig. S5b.† Indeed, the crystalline characteristics of PBD were significantly suppressed in the blend of PFBSA and PBD with a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. S5c†), enabling the production of smooth thin film via solution processing.
Doping behavior
To investigate the occurrence of the doping state of the blending system, only PBD, only PFBSA, and PBD:PFBSA mixtures with PBD:PFBSA molar ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 in DMAc solutions (0.1 wt/vol%) were prepared (Fig. 2a). The PBD:PFBSA mixture solutions were simply prepared by dissolving and stirring the mixtures of the solid components in DMAc. This facile preparation is a significant advantage of the PBD:PFBSA system as an efficient HTL over conventional PANI-based HTLs that require complicated and expensive fabrication methods, such as in situ polymerization or mechanical-grinding-induced protonation.40,41,54 The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the solutions are presented in Fig. 2b. For the PBD-only solution, the peak of the π–π* transition was detected at approximately 350 nm while the peak of benzoid to quinoid transition was observed at ∼600 nm. In contrast, the UV-Vis spectra of all the PBD:PFBSA mixture solutions exhibited two distinct characteristic peaks, one at approximately 430 nm and one located at >1100 nm, indicating the formation of a doping state.50

(c) Photograph of color change in PBD:PFBSA (1:1) film before and after thermal annealing, and (d) their UV-Vis absorption spectra. (e) Schematic illustration of internal charge carrier state transformation of PBD in bulk, solution, as-cast film and annealed film state. 
We investigated the optical properties of the PBD:PFBSA films to elucidate the doping behavior in the film state. Samples were prepared by spin-coating PBD:PFBSA mixture solutions in DMAc. The absorption spectra of the PBD:PFBSA films exhibited a bipolaron state, similar to that in the solutions. It has been reported that the thermal annealing of doped materials can produce delocalized polaron pairs (radical cations), which enhance the electrical conductivity.55 Therefore, we annealed the as-cast films on a hot plate at 250 °C to induce the internal charge carrier state transformation and remove residual water and DMAc from the film surface. The annealed films exhibited a remarkable change from pale yellow-greenish to blue-greenish, which can be clearly seen from the images of the representative PBD:PFBSA (1:1) film (Fig. 2c). In addition, films with different doping ratios were spectroscopically investigated to probe the internal charge carrier state transformation through the thermal annealing process (Fig. 2d and S6†). Different behaviors were observed in the UV-Vis spectra of the PBD:PFBSA films upon thermal annealing, depending on the doping ratios. A new peak at approximately 750 nm appeared in the UV-Vis spectrum of the PBD:PFBSA (2:1) film after thermal annealing, which might be attributed to the formation of localized polaron pairs. In contrast, for the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) and PBD:PFBSA (1:2) films, the peak at ∼750 nm was diminished by thermal annealing, and instead, a very broad absorption peak was observed in the range of 700 to over 1100 nm. This feature suggests the formation of delocalized polaron pairs.56 The delocalized polarons are crucial for achieving efficient HTLs by facilitating effective charge extraction and transfer.57Fig. 2e illustrates the internal charge carrier state transformation of PBD in the solution, as-cast film, and annealed film.
Optical and electrical properties
The optical transmittance of the HTL is an important property for determining the light absorption capability and charge generation of OSCs.58 Therefore, the transparencies of the PBD:PFBSA and PEDOT:PSS films under the optimized conditions for device fabrication were examined to compare their potentials as HTLs (Fig. 3a). The PBD:PFBSA (1:1) and PBD:PFBSA (1:2) films demonstrated higher transmittance than the PEDOT:PSS in the range of 300–1100 nm. This feature facilitates effective light harvesting in the active layer, and satisfies the primary requirement for a high-efficiency HTL.

(c) The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA films with the device structure of ITO/(PEDOT:PSS or PBD:PFBSA)/Ag measured in the dark. 
The WFs of the ITOs covered by PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA films were investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The UPS spectra of all the samples are exhibited in Fig. S7.† As shown in the energy-level diagram of the measured films (Fig. 3b), bare ITO and PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO exhibited the WFs of −4.70 and −5.12 eV, respectively. The WFs were estimated to be −4.73, −5.19, and −5.53 eV for PBD:PFBSA films with doping ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. Thus, the PBD:PFBSA film with a doping ratio of 1:1 possesses comparable WF with that of PEDOT:PSS.59
One of the most crucial properties of HTL that influences the device performance of OSCs is its electrical conductivity, especially in the vertical direction between the electrodes. We measured the OOP conductivities of PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA films using devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS or PBD:PFBSA/Ag structure. Conductive Ag metal was selected as the electrode to ensure ohmic contact. The I–V characteristics of the devices measured in the dark are presented in Fig. 3c. The OOP conductivities (σ) were calculated based on the method in the previous report and are summarized in Table 1.60 It is noted that the OOP conductivities are approximate values, owing to the higher conductivities of ITO and Ag.61 The OOP conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was calculated to be 1.25 × 10−6 S cm−1, which is similar to the values reported in the literature.62 The PBD:PFBSA films with doping ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 exhibited σ values of 0.55 × 10−6, 1.87 × 10−6, and 1.21 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. It is noted that the OOP conductivity of the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) film surpassed that of the reference PEDOT:PSS sample. The improved OOP conductivity of PBD:PFBSA (1:1) can promote the extraction and transfer processes of photo-induced charge carriers at the interfaces between the anode and the active layer.63

Another important requirement for an effective HTL is the solvent resistance, which prevents the layer from being washed out during the coating of the subsequent active layer. To evaluate this property, UV-Vis absorption spectra of the PBD:PFBSA films were measured before and after rinsing with chlorobenzene and chloroform, which are the solvents used most frequently for processing the active layer. Three different PBD:PFBSA films with varied doping ratios maintained the same absorption intensities upon rinsing, implying that the PBD:PFBSA films show sufficient solvent orthogonality (Fig. S8†). Based on the optical transmittance, WF, and OOP conductivity measurements, PBD:PFBSA (1:1) was selected as the HTL for further OSC device fabrication and characterization.
Photovoltaic performance and device stability
The PBD:PFBSA (1:1) film was used as HTL in OSC devices with a conventional structure comprising an ITO/HTL/active layer (PM6:Y6)/PDINN/Ag. The PEDOT:PSS film was used as the control HTL for comparison. The molecular structures of PM6 and Y6 as well as the device structure used in this study are shown in Fig. 4a. The detailed device fabrication conditions are described in the Experimental section. For example, the optimization of HTL thickness and the annealing process were investigated, and the results are summarized in Fig. S9, Tables S2 and S3.† The optimal HTL thickness was approximately 10 nm, which resulted in the highest JSC in the OSCs. In addition, the annealing process was optimized using a two-step approach in which the films were sequentially annealed at 90 and 250 °C, respectively. The devices subjected to two-step annealing exhibited PCEs superior to those subjected to one-step annealing at only 250 °C. We hypothesized that during the two-step annealing process, the low-temperature step at 90 °C circumvents the rapid evaporation of DMAc, which may lead to defects on the surface of the resulting films. To confirm this assumption, we probed the surface morphologies of the HTL films on the ITO substrate by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S10†). The as-cast PBD:PFBSA (1:1) film had a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value of 2.15 nm. The films subjected to one-step annealing at 250 °C exhibited an increased Rq of 2.41 nm. In comparison, two-step annealing decreased the Rq value of the as-cast film to 1.93 nm, which is equivalent to that of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate (1.83 nm). The lower Rq of the HTL film can reduce current leakage and interfacial defects, leading to improved JSC and FF of the OSCs.64 This fabrication condition of the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL is employed in further device fabrication. Meanwhile, the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layers for achieving the optimal OSC device performance was found to be approximately 40 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PM6:Y6 OSCs based on two different HTLs under a solar illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) are exhibited in Fig. 4b, while the photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 2. The PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL-based OSCs achieved the highest PCE of 15.24%, which is comparable to that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL. In addition, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA (1:1)-based devices, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4c. The calculated JSCs from the EQE spectra are consistent with the measured JSC values of the devices with a <5% mismatch. Moreover, the PCE histogram from more than 15 devices with Gaussian fitting in Fig. 4d demonstrates the reliability of these devices within small error ranges. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 15.24% is the highest value reported to date for OSCs using protonic acid-doped ani-HTLs. We summarized the previous representative studies of ani-HTLs for conventional OSCs, as part of two aniline-based doped material types in Fig. 4e and Table S4.†40–43,65–69 The versatility of PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL was examined for the OSCs with different active layers. Both the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) and PEDOT:PSS HTLs were used for the all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC) system consisting of PBDB-T and N2200. The device based on the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL exhibited a PCE of 6.92%, which was slightly higher than that of the device with the PEDOT:PSS HTL (6.76%) (Table 2 and Fig. S11†).

The device stability of OSCs is currently considered the most important requirement for commercial applications, and the interfacial layer is believed to play an essential role in device stability.22–24,30,58,70 Therefore, we examined the air stability of the PM6:Y6-based OSC with PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTLs. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PBD:PFBSA (1:1)-based OSC devices retained more than 50% of their original efficiency after 48 h of storage at 25 °C and 55% relative humidity (RH) without encapsulation. In contrast, the OSC devices with PEDOT:PSS HTL exhibited significantly higher degradation, retaining only ∼35% of their original PCE over the same timescale. Furthermore, to decouple the effects of active layer degradation, we examined OOP conductivity over time with sample structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS or PBD:PFBSA (1:1)/Ag and monitored the σ values after 10 and 20 days of storage at 25 °C and 25% RH (Fig. 5b). The PBD:PFBSA (1:1)-based devices retained more than 90% of their initial σ during the investigated timescale, which is significantly higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based devices (65%). Thus, the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) is an effective substitute for PEDOT:PSS to generate OSC devices with enhanced air stability.

Origin of device stability
To elucidate the rationale for the improved device stability, we investigated the relevant properties of PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA (1:1), including water contact angle (WCA), pH value, and indium diffusion. Hygroscopicity is one of the factors that shortens the lifetime of OSC devices, due to the absorption of ambient water into active layers through interfacial materials. Thus, WCA measurements were employed to study the interaction of water on the HTL surface. As illustrated in Fig. 6a and b, the WCA of the PEDOT:PSS coated-ITO sample was 8.2°, whereas that of PBD:PFBSA (1:1) was 59.7°. The higher WCA of the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) sample indicates a significantly decreased hydrophilic property, which could be attributed to the presence of fluorine atoms in the PFBSA. This characteristic builds a kinetic barrier to prevent the penetration of water molecules from air.71 Additionally, the increased WCA of the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) sample indicates a significantly reduced surface energy, which is advantageous for interfacial contact with hydrophobic organic active layers.71,72

The acidity of PEDOT:PSS is another factor that degrades the device stability of OSCs. We compared the pH values of PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA solutions. As shown in Fig. 6c, the color of pH paper indicated a pH value of 1–2 after the PEDOT:PSS solution was dropped on the paper. In contrast, the higher pH values were observed for the PBD:PFBSA solutions, regardless of the doping ratios. To precisely quantify the pH values of solutions, the evaluation with a pH meter was conducted (Fig. S12†), indicating that the PBD:PFBSA solutions exhibited lower acidity than the PEDOT:PSS solution. This phenomenon can be explained by the absence of the free hydronium ion (H3O+), as a consequence of the limited Brønsted–Lowry acid dissociation of PFBSA in the processing solvent (DMAc). Thus, the significantly reduced acidity of the PBD:PFBSA solution is expected to minimize ITO surface degradation. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the amount of indium diffused from corroded ITO for two samples, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and PBD:PFBSA (1:1) after 10 days at 25 °C with 25% RH by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The normalized intensities of indium from the surface of fresh and aged films are compared in Fig. 6d and e. The indium diffusion in the aged PBD:PFBSA (1:1) sample was suppressed, with a slightly increased intensity by a factor of 1.1 compared to its fresh counterpart. In contrast, the aged PEDOT:PSS sample showed a much greater indium diffusion, confirmed by the increased intensity (×1.4) compared to the fresh sample. Therefore, the enhanced device stability of OSC with PBD:PFBSA (1:1) can be attributed to the reduced hygroscopicity and acidity, which respectively suppress water infiltration and ITO degradation. Fig. 7 summarizes the important advantages of the PBD:PFBSA HTL for use in OSCs, including improved transmittance, enhanced OOP conductivity, stronger moisture resistance, and suppressed indium diffusion.

Conclusions
We developed a new HTL comprising an OANI host (PBD) and an aryl sulfonic acid dopant (PFBSA). The HTL can be simply prepared by spin-coating the PBD:PFBSA blend solutions, which is significantly advantageous in terms of processability compared to other PANI systems. The PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL-based OSC achieved a high PCE of 15.24%, which was comparable to that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL-based device. Moreover, the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL was successfully employed in other types of PBDB-T:N2200 all-PSCs, enabling a higher PCE than that obtained for the all-PSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL. This is mainly attributed to the superior properties of the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL, namely, solvent orthogonality, high transmittance, excellent conductivity, and suitable WF. Moreover, the PBD:PFBSA (1:1) HTL-based OSC exhibited superior ambient stability compared to the PEDOT:PSS HTL, which is ascribed to the reduced hygroscopicity and lower acidity of the former. The results obtained herein can act as a framework for the design of efficient aniline-based hole transporting materials suitable for applications in high-performance OSCs with enhanced device stability.
