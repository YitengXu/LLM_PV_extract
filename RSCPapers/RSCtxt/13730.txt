    , Accepted 2nd May 2012First published on 2nd May 2012AbstractHole transfer dynamics of Atto647N sensitized p-type NiO nanoparticle (NP) thin films is investigated using both ensemble-averaged and single-molecule spectroscopy techniques. The rate of hole transfer is dependent on the processing conditions and is enhanced when the NiO is pre-annealed in air as compared to vacuum. This is possibly due to an upward shift of the valence band of the semiconductor and an increase in the free energy for hole transfer as more Ni2O3 are formed in the presence of air. The stretched exponential fluorescence decay profile of Atto647N on NiO NP suggests the presence of a distribution of hole transfer rates. This is in agreement with the observed emission lifetime and intensity fluctuations and non-monoexponential fluorescence decays for individual Atto647N molecules on NiO NP films. A plausible explanation for the heterogeneous hole transfer rates is an inhomogeneous distribution of (defect) sites on the metal oxide due to the processing conditions and a fluctuation in the intermolecular interaction.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been hailed to be important alternatives to conventional solid state devices because of their low cost and ease of fabrication.1–3 DSSCs consisting of n-type semiconductors such as TiO2 and SnO2 are commonly used for energy conversion.3–5 Recently, new photovoltaic devices based on the sensitization of p-type semiconductors (e.g., NiO) by excited organic dye molecules have attracted a lot of attention in both the academic and industrial arenas because of their important role in designing efficient tandem DSSCs composing of a photosensitized n-type semiconductor anode and a photosensitized p-type semiconductor cathode.3,6–8 In order to develop effective p-type DSSCs, it is pertinent to have a better understanding of the interfacial charge transfer processes occurring between dye molecules and p-type semiconductor.
Nickel oxide is the most common semiconductor employed in the fabrication of p-type DSSCs. In particular, non-stoichiometric p-type NiO is chemically stable, possesses a wide band gap and displays low resistivity and high electrical conductivity.9 The electrical and optical properties of NiO have been shown to be affected by the processing conditions. Chattopadhyay et al. have prepared thin films of NiO by utilizing the direct current sputtering technique in different oxygen partial pressures and have demonstrated enhanced electrical conductivity and reduced band gap for NiO synthesized in high oxygen partial pressures.10 Bawendi et al. have observed significant quenching of the photoluminescence of quantum dots (QDs) deposited onto highly conductive NiO thin films as compared to QDs on resistive NiO films.11 Greiner et al. have also shown that the work functions and energy-level alignment of NiO thin films are dependent on the preparation conditions.12
Photophysical studies of organic dye molecules including Coumarin 343,13 porphyrin14 and peryleneimide derivative15 and n-type conducting polymers such as poly(fluorine-bis(1-cyanovinylenethienylene)phenylene) (PF1CVTP)16 on NiO have previously been conducted at the bulk level to elucidate the mechanism of charge transfer between the organic molecule and metal oxide semiconductor. It is found that the photoexcited sensitizers examined were quenched by injecting a hole into the valence band (VB) of the metal oxide (step 2 in Fig. 1). A charge-recombination reaction can subsequently take place between the excited electron in the reduced dye molecule and hole in the NiO VB (step 3 in Fig. 1).6,13–18

Step 1 is photo-excitation of the dye, step 2 is hole injection and step 3 is electron transfer. The dashed lines represent the upward shifted valence band (VB) and downward shifted conduction band (CB) of NiO annealed in a more oxygen rich environment. 
Single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) is a powerful technique used to probe both spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the photophysical behavior of molecules which are not possible from ensemble-averaged experiments.19–21 SMS has been used extensively to examine interfacial electron transfer dynamics from individual dye molecules to n-type TiO2, SnO2 and indium tin oxide (ITO).22–31 In particular, Lian et al. have shown that the quenched fluorescence lifetimes of single sulforhodamine B (SRhB) molecules on SnO2 fluctuate with time and vary from molecule to molecule as a result of both static and dynamic heterogeneity in the interfacial electron transfer between SRhB and SnO2.28 Lu et al. have reported fluorescence fluctuation dynamics for Coumarin 343, zinc-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin and 9-phenyl-2,3,7-trihydroxy-6-fluorone on TiO2 and have attributed the fluctuation behavior to a variation in the electron transfer reactivity.29–31 There are currently only a few single-molecule spectroscopy studies on dye-sensitized NiO. Recently, we have shown that interfacial charge transfer between single CdSe–ZnS quantum dots with NiO nanoparticles results in fluorescence intensity and lifetime quenching, suppression of blinking behavior and enhancement of the dot's survival time.32 Majima and co-workers have also reported the influence of Al2O3 layers in the single-molecule hole transfer dynamics of perylenediimide-sensitized NiO solar cells.33
In this paper, the hole transfer dynamics for a photostable rhodamine-type dye (Atto647N) on thin films of NiO will be investigated at both the ensemble and single-molecule levels. The effects of oxygen on both the composition of NiO during thermal annealing and the dynamics of interfacial charge transfer between the metal oxide and dye molecules will be studied. In particular, it will be shown from the bulk (section 3.1) and single-molecule (section 3.2) measurements that the quenching of Atto647N by NiO is more significant for NiO pre-annealed in air as compared to NiO pre-annealed in vacuum.
2 Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH; pellets, 99.998%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. The carbo-rhodamine dye Atto647N (chemical structure given in Fig. S1, ESI†) was purchased from ATTO-TEC GmbH. All chemicals were used as received.
2.2 Sample preparation
Nickel hydroxide sol was prepared using a method described elsewhere.9,32,34 Basically, 5 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution was added slowly to 10 mL of 0.2 M Ni(NO3)2 solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was allowed to settle overnight, and the Ni(OH)2 deposit was dialyzed against deionized water for 24 h.
For ultrafast transient absorption measurements, NiO nanoparticles were prepared by annealing Ni(OH)2 sol at 350 °C for 12 h in air. NiO films were prepared by drop-casting 20 μL of ∼17 mg mL−1 NiO nanoparticle in methanol on a glass substrate and dried in a vacuum oven. Dye-sensitized NiO films were prepared by drop-casting 20 μL of ∼10−4 M Atto647N solution on as-prepared NiO films and allowed to dry (drop-cast method). In the control experiment, Atto647N film was prepared by drop-casting 20 μL of ∼10−4 M Atto647N solution on a glass cover-slip.
For ensemble time-resolved fluorescence lifetime and single-molecule measurements, nanostructured NiO films were prepared by spin-coating Ni(OH)2 sol onto cleaned glass cover-slips and the Ni(OH)2 sol was subsequently annealed at 350 °C for 3 h in either air in a furnace (Carbolite) or vacuum created by pumping the tubular furnace to a pressure of ∼ 1 × 10−4 mbar. Dye-sensitized NiO films were prepared by spin-coating an aqueous solution of Atto647N (∼10−7 M for ensemble experiments and 4 × 10−11 M for single-molecule experiments) onto NiO nanoparticle films pre-annealed in air or vacuum. Also, control samples were prepared by spin-coating an aqueous solution of Atto647N with the same concentration on cleaned glass cover-slips.
ZrO2 sol is prepared as follows: a mixture containing 50 μL of zirconium(IV) propoxide (70 wt% solution in 1-propanol, Sigma Aldrich) and 2 mL of isopropanol (HPLC/spectro grade, Tedia) was added slowly to a mixture containing 20 mL of deionized water and 200 μL of 37% hydrochloric acid (Panreac) under vigorous stirring. The final solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. ZrO2 sol was concentrated to 6 g L−1 using a rotary evaporator at 60 °C. ZrO2 film was obtained by spin casting 200 μL of 6 g L−1 ZrO2 sol on a cleaned glass cover slip. The as-prepared ZrO2 film was calcined at 350 °C for 3 h.
2.3 Ensemble measurements
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of Atto647N were recorded using a UV-vis absorption spectrometer (Cary 100, Varian) and a fluorescence spectrometer (Eclipse, Varian), respectively. The extinction coefficient (ε) of NiO was determined by measuring the diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of the metal oxide deposited onto a glass cover-slip. By assuming that the geometric thickness of the sample is equivalent to the optical pathlength, ε is estimated using ε = A × M × S × m−1 where A is the absorbance, M is the molar mass of NiO, S is the surface area of sample absorbing light and m is the mass of NiO deposited.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a XPS spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Thetaprobe). A monochromatic Al Kα was used as the excitation source and the binding energy reference for the C 1s is set at 285 eV. The X-ray diffraction pattern of NiO nanoparticles was obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) and Cu Kα radiation. The average NiO crystalline size (D) was estimated using the Scherrer equation: D = 0.89λ/βcosθ, where λ, θ and β are the X-ray wavelength (0.154 nm), Bragg angle (21.69°) and the full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak, respectively.
Spectroelectrochemistry measurements were conducted on Atto647N in acetonitrile solutions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte (0.1 M LiClO4) after deoxygenating by purging with N2(g) at room temperature. Transmission change of dye solution (ΔT = Twith electric-potential − Twithout electric-potential) was recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 750, Perkin Elmer). The working electrode in the flat cell (pathlength ≈ 0.5 mm) was a Pt wire mesh, used in conjunction with a Pt wire mesh auxiliary electrode. The potential was fixed at −1.30 V, which is more negative than the reduction peak potential (∼ −1.27 V) measured with a Pt wire reference electrode. The potential was controlled with a computer-controlled potentiostat (Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 100) with an ADC fast scan generator.
A laser flash photolysis spectrometer (LKS.60, Applied Photophysics), equipped with a Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser (Brilliant B, Quantel), a 150 W pulsed Xe lamp and a R928 photomultiplier, was used to record ns-difference absorption (ΔOD) spectra. Samples were excited at 633 nm and each time-resolved trace was acquired by averaging 10 laser shots at a repetition rate of 1 Hz.
The femtosecond non-degenerate transient absorption experiments were conducted with 150 fs (FWHM), 1 kHz laser pulses. The excitation pulses (650 nm) were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C) which was pumped by a regenerative amplifier (Coherent Legend; center wavelength: 800 nm; power: 1 mJ per pulse). The regenerative amplifier was seeded by an 80 MHz Coherent Vitesse oscillator. The probe pulses (400–750 nm) were generated by focusing a small portion (∼5 μJ) of the fundamental 800 nm laser pulses into a 1 mm-thick sapphire plate. The linear polarization of the pump pulse was adjusted to be perpendicular to that of the probe pulse with a polarizer and a half waveplate. Pump-induced changes of transmission (ΔT/T) of the probe beam were monitored using a monochromator/PMT configuration with lock-in detection. In this case, ΔT = T(t) − T where T is the transmission at time t = 0 (i.e., the time at which the pump pulse irradiates the sample). The pump beam was chopped at 83 Hz and this was used as the reference frequency for the lock-in amplifier.
The time-resolved fluorescence lifetimes of Atto647N deposited on either a glass substrate or a NiO nanoparticle film were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrofluorimeter (FluoroCube, Horiba Jobin Yvon). The samples were excited at 637 nm using a pulsed diode laser (NanoLED-635L, Horiba Jobin Yvon) and the emission was monitored at 680 nm. The fluorescence decay profiles were analyzed using either the Horiba Jobin Yvon Datastation software for single and double-exponential decays or the Fluofit 4.4 software (PicoQuant) for stretched-exponential decays, and the goodness of fit was assessed by considering the reduced chi-square (χ2) value and the randomness of the weighted residuals. All measurements were performed at ambient conditions.
2.4 Single-molecule spectroscopy
Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were performed using a time-resolved confocal microscope (MicroTime 200, PicoQuant). Basically, an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus) equipped with a scanning stage (P-733.2CL, Physik Instruments) was used to detect single molecules. The excitation source used is a 635 nm pulsed laser diode (LDH-P-C-635B, PicoQuant). Circular polarized excitation light was achieved by using half-wave and quarter-wave plates. Circular polarized excitation light passed through an excitation filter (Z636/10, Chroma) before being focused through an oil immersion objective lens (100×, N.A. 1.4, Olympus) which was also used to collect the fluorescence. The fluorescence was then passed through a dichroic mirror (Z638rpc, Chroma) and an emission filter (HQ685/70, Chroma) before being detected by a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD, SPCM-AQR-15, Perkin-Elmer). A Hanbury-Brown and Twiss type coincidence setup was employed for the antibunching experiment where a 50%/50% beam splitter was used to divide the fluorescence signal into two separate SPADs. All measurements were performed at ambient conditions and the data were analyzed using the SymPho Time software (PicoQuant) and Fluofit 4.4 software (PicoQuant). The steady-state ensemble fluorescence spectra of the solid-state samples were measured using this instrument with excitation wavelength = 635 nm.
The defocused wide-field fluorescence microscopy setup consists of a microscope (IX 71, Olympus) and a 633 nm HeNe laser source (Melles Griot). The excitation light was tuned to be circularly polarized using λ/4 and λ/2 waveplates and expanded via a beam expander (ThorLabs) before being focused onto the back-focal plane of an oil immersion objective lens (100×, N.A. 1.3, Olympus). An excitation filter (Z633/10, Chroma) was used to filter the excitation light. The fluorescence was passed through a dichroic mirror (Z633rdc, Chroma) and an emission filter (HQ645lp, Chroma) and subsequently detected by a highly sensitive CCD camera (CascadeII 512B, Photometrics) after magnification with a 3.3× camera lens. The dimension of a wide-field fluorescence frame was measured to be 24.7 × 24.7 μm2 and the integration time of the CCD camera is 34.6 ms per frame.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Ensemble measurements
The time-resolved fluorescence decay profile of Atto647N (10−7 M) spin-coated on a glass substrate (curve A in Fig. 2) is obtained using the TCSPC technique and is well fitted using a single-exponential decay function with a fluorescence lifetime of 3.8 ns, close to the unquenched emission lifetime of Atto647N in water. This indicates that the dye coverage on the solid surface is sufficiently low to avoid self quenching between the Atto647N molecules and eliminates the formation of aggregates. The fluorescence decay profiles of similar concentrations of Atto647N spin-coated onto thin NiO NP films pre-treated by annealing in vacuum and in air are also displayed in Fig. 2. In both cases, the heterogeneous fluorescence decays cannot be properly described using either a single or double-exponential decay function (i.e., χ2 > 1.8 were obtained), hence suggesting the presence of a distribution of emission decay times.
 Fig. 2  Time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles of Atto647N deposited on (A) a glass substrate, (B) NiO NP film pre-annealed in vacuum and (C) NiO NP film pre-annealed in air and the instrument response function (IRF). The corresponding theoretical fits based on a single-exponential decay function for curve A and a stretched exponential function for curves B and C are also shown. The samples were excited using a 637 nm light and the emission was monitored at 680 nm. 
In order to satisfactorily analyze the fluorescence decay profiles of Atto647N on NiO NP (i.e., with 1 < χ2 < 1.2), the stretched exponential function is used to fit the experimental data: (1)where τk is the characteristic time scale of the decay and β is the stretching exponent. The mean lifetime of the distribution is given by 〈τ〉NiO = τkβ−1Γ(β−1), where Γ(x) is the gamma function. From eqn (1), the emission decay of Atto647N on a NiO NP film pre-annealed in vacuum (curve B in Fig. 2) yields τk = 1.1 ns, β = 0.67 and 〈τ〉NiO = 1.5 ns. For Atto647N on a NiO NP film pre-annealed in air (curve C in Fig. 2), the values for τk, β and 〈τ〉NiO are 0.34 ns, 0.66 and 0.46 ns, respectively. It is clear from Fig. 2 and the 〈τ〉NiO values that the fluorescence lifetime of Atto647N molecules is quenched by the NiO NP with significantly more quenching observed for the NiO NP pre-annealed in air as compared to NiO NP pre-annealed in vacuum. Indeed, the average fluorescence quenching rates of Atto647N by NiO NP, calculated from k = 1/〈τ〉NiO − 1/〈τ〉 where 〈τ〉 (= 3.8 ns) is the mean lifetime of the dye on glass, are k = 4.2 × 108 s−1 and 1.9 × 109 s−1 for NiO NP pre-annealed in vacuum and in air, respectively. When a higher concentration (e.g., 10−6 M) of dye solution was spin-coated onto a glass substrate, the resulting time-resolved fluorescence trace deviates from a mono-exponential decay such that one of the lifetime components is <3.8 ns. This is probably due to quenching of the dye emission by defect sites such as aggregates.
The radiative decay constant of an excited state may be perturbed by varying the dielectric constant of the medium.35 The effect of a change in the medium refractive index (i.e., from ∼1.5 for glass to ∼2 for NiO) is examined by measuring the fluorescence decay of a sample prepared by spin-coating a 10−7 M Atto647N solution on an inactive ZrO2 NP film whose refractive index is close to that of NiO. The single-exponential fluorescence decay yields a lifetime of 3.5 ns (Fig. S2, ESI†) which is close to the value obtained for the dye on a glass surface. Therefore, the observed fluorescence quenching on NiO cannot be explained by an alteration in the radiative decay rate and is, instead, attributed to nonradiative processes such as electronic energy transfer (EET) and/or charge transfer.
We will first consider the EET mechanism. NiO pre-annealed in air shows weak absorption in the visible region (Fig. S2, ESI†). This is due to the presence of oxygen-induced defect states.10 The absorption spectrum of NiO in the visible region overlaps with the fluorescence spectrum of the dye (Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that resonance energy transfer from the excited dye molecule to NiO NP may be responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching. In order to determine the extent of EET in the Atto647N-NiO system, the Förster critical radius (Ro ≈ 2.5 nm) is estimated using the PhotochemCAD36 software where the emission quantum yield of Atto647N is taken to be 0.65 and a random spatial orientation factor is assumed (i.e., κ2 = 2/3). By considering the point dipole of NiO to be located at the centre of the NP, the spatial center-to-center separation between the two moieties (R) is approximated by the sum of the radii of the Atto647N molecule (∼0.5 nm) and NiO NP (r).37 The average size (D) of the NiO NP is obtained from the XRD pattern of a NiO NP film pre-annealed in air (Fig. S4, ESI†), and a value of r ≈ D/2 = 7 nm is used to calculate the Förster energy transfer rate constant (keet): (2)where τ (= 3.8 ns) is the emission lifetime of Atto647N on glass. A value of keet = 3.3 × 105 s−1 is obtained from eqn (2) which indicates that the rate of Förster energy transfer is ca. 6000 times slower than the observed quenching rate. In addition, NiO pre-annealed in an environment void of oxygen (e.g., Ar and vacuum) displays an even weaker absorption in the visible region due to the decrease in the number of defect states,10 resulting in a smaller spectra overlap with the emission spectrum of Atto647N. Clearly, Förster-type EET is not able to explain the fast fluorescence quenching observed for Atto647N on NiO. The possibility of energy transfer from the dye molecule to trap states found on the surface of NiO NP is also ruled out since this process is in operation only when the surface is substantially charged via electron injection.38 We conclude that energy transfer most likely does not play a significant role in the fluorescence quenching of Atto647N by NiO NP. This observation is in line with previous studies that have shown that energy transfer can be neglected in the emission quenching of dye molecules (e.g., Coumarin 343, porphyrin, perylenediimide) and conjugated polymers (e.g., PF1CVTP) by NiO because of the weak absorption of the metal oxide and poor spectral overlap in the visible region.6,13–18,32,33
Another mechanism that is used to explain the reduction in the observed fluorescence lifetime is hole transfer from Atto647N to NiO NP as illustrated by the energy level diagram in Fig. 1. In this case, the free energy for hole transfer ΔGoht is calculated using the following equation:6 ΔGoht = Evb − Ered − E00(3)where Evb (= 0.54 V vs. NHE) is the valence band (VB) potential of NiO,29 and Ered (= −0.68 V vs. NHE) and E00 (= 1.89 eV) are the reduction potential and first excited singlet state energy of Atto647N,32 respectively. A ΔGoht value of −0.67 eV is obtained from eqn (3), indicating an energetically favorable hole transfer process from the Atto647N molecule to the VB of NiO. On the other hand, electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band of NiO is not feasible since the corresponding free energy for electron transfer is positive in value (i.e., ΔGoet = 2.02 eV).
A more efficient hole transfer process is observed for NiO NP pre-annealed in air as compared to vacuum. In order to rationalize this behavior, the chemical composition of nickel oxide films prepared in different conditions is studied. The chemical composition of nickel oxide films is analyzed by fitting the experimentally measured Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (peak at binding energy of 855.6 eV) to two overlapping curves with peak positions at 854.6 eV (binding energy for Ni2+ from NiO) and 856.1 eV (binding energy for Ni3+ from Ni2O3) (see Fig. 3).39 The integrated peak area ratios of Ni2+/Ni3+ for NiO annealed in air and in vacuum are determined to be 0.51 and 0.75, respectively, indicating that relatively more Ni3+ is formed in the former. During the annealing process in air, oxygen creates extra vacancies in normally Ni2+ occupied sites causing some of the surrounding Ni2+ to undergo oxidation to form Ni3+ in order to preserve charge neutrality. The doping of nickel oxide films with Ni3+ and Al3+ results in a reduction of bandgap energy and an upward shift of the semiconductor VB.10 The faster hole transfer rate observed for NiO annealed in air may be due to an energetically more favorable hole transfer process resulting from a larger energy difference between the HOMO of the dye and the VB of NiO (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the intraband gap states resulting from the formation of Ni3+ provide extra channels for charge-transfer to take place, hence enhancing the hole transfer rates.
 Fig. 3  Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra of NiO NP films pre-annealed in (a) vacuum and in (b) air at 350 °C for 3 h fitted with curves corresponding to Ni2+ (I) and Ni3+ (II). 
Nanosecond flash photolysis (FP) and femtosecond transient transmission (TT) measurements were conducted to further examine the dynamics of hole transfer between the dye molecule and NiO. Unfortunately, samples used in the TCSPC experiments, prepared by spin-coating a ∼10−7 M Atto647N solution onto a glass or NiO NP film substrate, yielded extremely weak FP and TT signals due to the low surface coverage. This renders the analysis of data difficult. In order to record FP and TT spectra with reasonable signal-to-noise ratios, the density of dye molecules on the substrate must be significantly increased. This is achieved by drop-casting a 10−4 M dye solution onto the substrate. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectrum of the solid-state sample prepared by drop-casting a 10−4 M dye solution on a glass cover-slip. The spectrum is observed to be broader than the absorption spectrum of an aqueous dye solution (∼10−6 M) consisting of only monomeric dye molecules. This indicates that on the glass surface, both monomers and aggregates of some sort (e.g., dimers and higher-order aggregates) may be formed at high surface coverage (note that the UV-vis absorption of a sample prepared by spin-coating ∼10−7 M of dye onto a glass substrate is too weak to be measured). Furthermore, the steady-state fluorescence spectra of both the solid-state sample prepared by spin-coating a ∼10−7 M Atto647N solution onto a glass surface and a dilute dye solution have a maximum intensity at 661 nm (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the emission spectrum of the sample prepared by drop-casting a ∼10−4 M dye solution onto a glass substrate is red-shifted by 31 nm (Fig. 4). The bathochromic shift observed could be due to the transfer of energy from an excited monomeric dye molecule to an aggregate which acts like a defect site, trapping the energy and emitting at a longer wavelength. It has previously been reported that aggregates of rhodamine-type and cyanine-type molecules are easily formed when deposited at high density on solid surfaces.40,41 These aggregates can then act as energy traps to quench both the emission intensity and fluorescence lifetime of dye molecules.40 The TCSPC fluorescence lifetime decay profile of a sample prepared by drop-casting a ∼10−4 M Atto647N solution on a glass cover-slip has a lifetime component that is shorter than the time-resolution of the TCSPC instrument (i.e., 200 ps) and a longer lifetime component of ca. 400 ps (Fig. S5, ESI†). The significantly reduced lifetime values are probably due to the short lifetimes of aggregates and quenched monomers.40,41 Furthermore, TT measurements show that for samples with a high dye surface coverage (e.g., prepared by the drop-casting method), ultrafast quenching of the excited-state of monomeric dye molecules takes place and is due to efficient energy trapping by aggregates located close-by (see ESI†).

Normalized fluorescence spectra of (c) an aqueous solution of Atto647N and solid-state samples prepared by (d) spin-coating a ∼10−7 M and (e) drop-casting a ∼10−4 M dye solution on glass substrates. 
The above results clearly show that at high dye coverage, Atto647N tends to form aggregates when deposited on solid substrates. Therefore, in order to avoid complications arising from the interaction between dye molecules and aggregates, samples prepared by spin-coating a low concentration (≤10−7 M) dye solution onto either a glass surface or NiO NP film should be used. This will allow for a better comparison between the ensemble and single-molecule spectroscopy (see the next section) results. In the rest of this article, we will focus on the photophysical behavior of solid-state samples prepared using low concentrations of Atto647N (i.e., in the absence of aggregates).
3.2 Single-molecule spectroscopy measurements
A number-density analysis was performed on samples prepared by spin-coating a similar concentration (4 × 10−11 M) of Atto647N onto a glass substrate and a NiO NP film pre-annealed in air, and it was found that the average number of detectable single Atto647N molecules in the latter is about 75% of the number of single molecules detected on a glass surface. This is because the surface roughness of the NiO NP film causes a smaller number of dye molecules to be attached onto the substrate and a larger portion of the molecules are therefore thrown away from the surface during the spin-coating process.26

Fig. 5(a) shows a typical fluorescence intensity trajectory of a single Atto647N molecule deposited on a glass substrate. The fluorescence lifetime (τ0.5) for every 0.5 s step size is determined from the single-exponential emission decay profile obtained from the photons found in each time interval (0.5 s) and the data are presented in Fig. 5(a). It is observed that the τ0.5 value does not fluctuate significantly throughout the intensity trajectory and the molecule has a mean τ0.5 value of 4.2 ns. The fluorescence decay profile of the molecule constructed using all the photons detected during its survival time is also best fitted using a single-exponential decay function with a lifetime of τf = 4.2 ns. The τf distribution histogram for 131 single dye molecules is described by a Gaussian function with a mean emission lifetime of 3.9 ns (Fig. S9, ESI†) which is in agreement with the lifetime measured from the bulk experiment.
 Fig. 5  Emission intensity (black) and lifetime (grey) trajectories of single Atto647N molecules deposited on (a) glass and (b and c) NiO NP film pre-annealed in air. The fluorescence decay profiles (d) constructed from photons found in the 0.5 s interval at X and Y of (c) are given by curves X and Y, respectively. Curve Z is constructed from photons emitted during the survival time of the molecule in (c). A single-exponential decay function is used to fit the decay curves X and Y whereas a stretched exponential is used to fit curve Z. The bin-time used is 5 ms. 
The fluorescence intensity trajectory and τ0.5 distribution of single Atto647N molecules on a NiO NP film pre-annealed in air are classified into two categories as illustrated by two molecules in Fig. 5(b) and (c). The single molecule in Fig. 5(b) exhibits τ0.5 values (from single-exponential decays) that do not fluctuate significantly from the mean value of 0.61 ns. The single-exponential fluorescence decay profile, constructed from all the photons detected before photobleaching, yields τf = 0.64 ns.
On the other hand, large fluctuations in both the fluorescence intensity and τ0.5 are seen for the single molecule in Fig. 5(c). In this case, a positive correlation exists between the fluorescence intensity and τ0.5 such that low τ0.5 values are observed for low emission intensities and vice versa. For example, at point X in Fig. 5(c), where the average fluorescence intensity is ∼3.2 counts per ms, the corresponding τ0.5 = 0.87 ns (see the single-exponential decay curve X in Fig. 5(d)) whereas at point Y, with a higher average intensity of ∼11.6 counts per ms, the corresponding τ0.5 is increased to 2.4 ns (see the single-exponential decay curve Y in Fig. 5(d)). The fluorescence decay profile of the molecule, constructed by combining all the photons detected before it undergoes an irreversible photobleaching process at ∼23 s, is given by the decay curve Z in Fig. 5(d). Due to the distribution of lifetimes observed throughout the intensity trajectory, the decay curve Z is best described using a stretched exponential function with τk = 0.74 ns, τ = 0.66 and 〈τ〉NiO = 1.0 ns.
The normalized distributions of the mean fluorescence lifetime of individual molecules (i.e., τf and 〈τ〉NiO) for 154 single dye molecules on NiO NP pre-annealed in vacuum (where 60% of molecules display stretched exponential decay) and 163 molecules on NiO NP pre-annealed in air (where 51% of molecules display stretched exponential fluorescence decays) are given in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. Molecules that show very low intensity counts give rise to mean lifetimes that are shorter than the time resolution of the experimental set-up (i.e., <300 ps), and their number of occurrences is represented by the hatch fill column. It is observed that as the concentration of O2 present in the annealing process increases, the peak of the histogram shifts to a shorter mean lifetime (i.e., ∼1.9 ns and 0.5 ns for NiO pre-annealed in vacuum and air, respectively, as estimated from the Gaussian distribution fit to the histogram), and is accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of molecules displaying a relatively long mean lifetime. For example, 43% and 6% of the total number of molecules studied have mean lifetimes >2 ns when deposited on NiO NP films pre-annealed in vacuum and air, respectively.

Bin-time used is 0.5 ns for (a) and (b). Normalized fluorescence intensity histograms of single Atto647N molecules on NiO NP film annealed in (c) vacuum and (d) air. 
A similar trend is noted for the distribution of the fluorescence intensity (I) of individual molecules, where I is defined by I = (total number of photon counts detected during the survival time)/(survival time) (Fig. 6(c) and (d)). In this case, the proportion of molecules exhibiting relatively high I is significantly lower for NiO pre-annealed in air as compared to NiO pre-annealed in vacuum. For an example, 44% and 7% of the total number of molecules studied have I > 30 counts per ms when deposited on NiO NP films pre-annealed in vacuum and air, respectively.
To ensure that multiple chromophores in the same excitation volume (which can lead to correlated emission intensity and lifetime fluctuations) are not present, antibunching experiment is conducted to confirm that the observed fluorescence originates from a single molecule.42,43 A typical interphoton arrival time distribution of a fluorescent spot on a NiO NP film pre-annealed in air (Fig. 7(a)) displays signature features of a single-photon emitter indicating that only a single dye molecule is emitting in the detection volume. In particular, the ratio of the number of coincident events in the central peak (NC) to the average number of non-coincident events in the lateral peaks (NL) is NC/NL ∼ 0.15 which is smaller than 0.5 (note: in the ideal case, 0.5 ≤ NC/NL ≤ 1 when two or more independent emitters are found in the detection volume). The non-zero, albeit small, coincidence in the central peak for the molecule shown in Fig. 7(a) can be attributed to background–background and background–signal photon pairs.42,43 The histogram of the NC/NL ratio for 45 molecules, shown in Fig. 7(b), clearly demonstrates that close to all of the dye molecules on NiO behave as single-photon emitters. Furthermore, the defocused wide-field patterns of single dye molecules on NiO NP do not vary with time and, therefore, molecular reorientation does not account for the intensity fluctuation (Movie S1, caption given in ESI†).44

The emission lifetime quenching of single Atto647N molecules on NiO NP films is due to hole transfer from the dye to the metal oxide semiconductor (Fig. 1). The single-molecule spectroscopy results are in agreement with the ensemble TCSPC measurements (see Section 3.1) in which a more efficient hole transfer process is observed for NiO NP pre-annealed in air as compared to vacuum. In previous studies, dye molecules (e.g., Coumarin 343, porphyrin, perylenediimide) are strongly anchored onto the NiO NP via a covalent bond, and an ultrafast hole transfer process has been reported to occur within a few hundreds of picoseconds.13–18 Some examples are as follows: hole injection from (i) phosphorus porphyrin to NiO takes place on the 2–20 ps time regime,14 (ii) Coumarin 343 to NiO occurs in ∼ 200 fs,13a and (iii) peryleneimide to NiO occurs within 0.5 ps.45 In all of these studies, the dye is firmly anchored onto the NiO via a covalent bond (i.e., chemisorbed dyes on NiO). The efficiency of charge injection is enhanced when an organic molecule is chemisorbed onto the metal oxide semiconductor.6 This is because of the strong coupling between the two moieties as a result of the formation of a covalent bond.6,46 The presence of the linker and anchoring group therefore helps to enhance the coupling between the dye and semiconductor, resulting in the observed ultrafast hole injection rate. Similarly, probe molecules that are chemisorbed onto a metal oxide experience strong enough coupling to exhibit chemical enhancement via charge-transfer in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS.47 In the case of the system studied herein, Atto647N molecules are deposited onto the NiO NP by spin-coating, without being chemisorbed. Therefore, the observed hole transfer rate is significantly slower than the ones reported previously for chemisorbed systems. We have previously demonstrated slow electron injection from spin-coated Atto647N to the conduction band of n-type TiO2 when the reactivity of the forward electron transfer is low.22 Chen et al. have also reported slow electron transfer from Oxazine 1 to TiO2 and have attributed the observation to the physisorption of the dye onto the TiO2 film.26
The distribution of hole transfer rates inferred from the stretched exponential emission decay seen in the bulk experiment for Atto647N on NiO NP films (Fig. 2) is rationalized by considering the presence of both dynamic and static inhomogeneity in the hole transfer dynamics seen in the single-molecule measurements. The fluctuations in fluorescence lifetime and emission intensity with time within a molecule (Fig. 5(c)) give rise to a dynamic contribution. On the other hand, the emission properties of single molecules vary from molecule to molecule as implied by the broad distribution of mean lifetimes seen in Fig. 6(a) and (b) (i.e., static contribution). Previous single-molecule studies on the charge transfer reaction between dye molecules and semiconductor nanoparticles have clearly demonstrated that a change in the microenvironment is capable of perturbing the electronic interaction between the two moieties, the reorganization energy and the Gibbs free energy for charge transfer.22–33 An inhomogeneous distribution in the chemical composition of the NiO film, resulting from preparation conditions, can provide defect sites that can either promote or inhibit favorable hole transfer electronic coupling and driving force between the two species. Furthermore, given that charge-transfer coupling displays an exponential fall-off with distance, Atto647N deposited onto NiO may experience a small and time-dependent fluctuation in the intermolecular spatial separation which influences the overall electronic coupling. As discussed by Lu et al., the inhomogeneous nature of the electronic coupling leads to a variation in the hole transfer reactivity dynamics that is revealed by the intensity fluctuation observed in the fluorescence time trace trajectories of single molecules.30,31 Heterogeneous forward electron transfer reactivity between encapsulated (single) Atto647N and TiO2 has also been previously reported by us.22
4 Conclusions
The hole transfer dynamics of Atto647N on thin films of NiO nanoparticles has been examined using both time-resolved ensemble-averaged and single-molecule spectroscopy techniques. From the bulk experiments, it is observed that the rate of hole transfer is enhanced for NiO NP pre-annealed in air as compared to NiO NP pre-annealed in vacuum. This is due to the upward shift of the VB of NiO as more Ni2O3 are formed in air (O2) during the processing of the metal oxide. A distribution of rates for hole transfer from dye molecules to NiO is inferred from the stretched-exponential fluorescence decay curve and this observation is in agreement with the results observed in the single-molecule spectroscopy studies. In particular, both static and dynamic fluctuations in the emission intensity and fluorescence lifetime suggest that the microenvironments of individual molecules vary and are responsible for the heterogeneous distributions of hole transfer rates.
