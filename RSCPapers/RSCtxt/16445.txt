Introduction
The global demand for energy and depletion of fossil fuels have triggered the intensive research to exploit clean, abundant, and sustainable energy sources and efficient energy storage devices. Primary renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wave power, and wind energy, are environmentally friendly, but most of them suffer from daily and seasonal intermittence and regional variability.1 To overcome the shortcomings of primary renewable energy sources, tremendous efforts have been devoted to convert renewable energy resources into ideal chemical energy. Among them, electrochemical water splitting (2H2O → O2 + 2H2) is one of the promising solutions to produce clean and sustainable hydrogen fuel.2–4 Electrochemical water splitting is based on two coupled half reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H+ + 2e− → H2) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) at the anode. However, the overall hydrogen production rate is mainly determined by the OER, which suffers from sluggish kinetics involving the four-electron oxidative half-reaction.5 Therefore, an appropriate catalyst is required to accelerate the OER at a low overpotential (η) for enhanced energy conversion efficiency.
Ru/Ir-based oxides have been used as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER with high activity and low overpotential, but their high cost and scarcity are the bottlenecks in large-scale applications.6–8 In this regard, transition metal (TM)-based oxides have been intensively investigated as OER electrocatalysts because they are cost effective, easily synthesized, and environmentally benign, making them optimal alternatives of precious noble metal electrocatalysts.9–11 The typical TM-based oxide (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) electrocatalysts exhibit promising intrinsic electrocatalytic activities and good stabilities, but the confined surface areas and low electrical conductivities hinder their use in practical applications.12–15
Some ternary oxides and layered double hydroxides have been reported to exhibit a superior OER performance. In particular, TM-based ternary oxides with spinel and perovskite structures are considered as the most promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media.16,17 These ternary oxides exhibited better OER electrocatalytic properties compared to binary oxides, where the different metal ions in ternary oxides might play different roles during the OER.11 The incorporation of a specific metal ion into the ternary oxide crystal structure enables the modification of the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and optimization of the binding conditions between the OER intermediate and reactant.11
Recently, the OER electrocatalytic properties of manganese vanadates have been studied based on the compositions of Mn2V2O7 and Mn1.5V1.5O4.18 The investigated Mn2V2O7 phase, which is a typical thortveitite structure (A2B2O7) consisting of edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra and the corner-sharing V2O7 divanadate group, has a narrow band gap energy of ∼1.8 eV exhibiting a high activity for catalyzing the OER.18–20 The electron transfer occurs by excitation of electrons from the high-spin Mn 3d5 orbital at the top of the valence band to the V 3d empty orbital at the bottom of the conduction band, which implies that the continued vanadate network plays an important role in electronic conduction. However, the lack of an extended vanadate network in the Mn2V2O7 phase can hinder the diffusion of electrons through the material. On the other hand, the brannerite structure MnV2O6 has a crystal structure where the layers of edge and vertex bridged VO6 octahedra are extended along the ab-plane,21 and its resistivity and activation energy for charge migration are lower than those of Mn2V2O7.22 p-Type MnV2O6 was found to be a visible-light active photocatalyst for both water oxidation and reduction,21 but the electrocatalytic OER activity of MnV2O6 has not been investigated even though it is expected to show superior OER activity for electrochemical water splitting based on its higher electrical conductivity and lower activation energy for charge migration among the manganese vanadate compounds.
In this study, MnV2O6 is synthesized in the form of nanobelts with a high surface area by a hydrothermal method and combined with commercial graphene nanosheets by a facile and mass-productive high energy mechanical milling process. MnV2O6 nanobelts are chosen because of the unique structural and electronic properties of two dimensional (2D) structures, which lead to exposed active sites and shorter ionic and electronic diffusion paths.23–25 Graphene nanosheets can serve as a support material inhibiting the self-aggregation of electrocatalyst materials and providing numerous pores to promote the mass transfer and the interconnected electron-conductive pathways so as to facilitate the electron transfer during the OER.26–28 The OER activity and long-term stability of MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposites are investigated in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Under the optimized conditions, MnV2O6/graphene exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential along with high stability and durability.
Experimental
Synthesis of MnV2O6 nanobelts
MnV2O6 nanobelts were synthesized by a hydrothermal process. 2 mmol manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)2·xH2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 25 mL of H2O and 4 mmol ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was separately dissolved in 25 mL of H2O at 85 °C. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the NH4VO3 solution was slowly introduced into the Mn(NO3)2·xH2O solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL, which was kept in an oven at 200 °C for 12 h. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with H2O and ethanol, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite
Typically, the as-prepared MnV2O6 nanobelts and commercial graphene nanosheets (Angstron Materials) were dispersed in 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, the solution was transferred into a zirconia jar (80 cm3) with zirconia balls (diameter of 3/8 in.) at a ball-to-powder ratio of 20 (in weight). Wet milling was conducted at 300 rpm for 6 h. After milling, the solution was filtered and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
Material characterization
The phase of the as-prepared MnV2O6 and nanocomposite was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8-Advance, Bruker Miller Co.) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The graphene content in MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposites was measured using an elemental (C, N, S) analyzer (Flash EA 1112, Thermo Electron Corporation). The chemical states of Mn, V, O, and C in the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Sigma probe, ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source. The morphology of the as-prepared MnV2O6 and nanocomposite was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU70, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL).
Electrochemical measurements
The OER electrocatalytic properties were evaluated using a three-electrode system using a potentiostat (Bio-Logic SP-200) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. A Pt wire and Hg/HgO were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To fabricate the working electrode, catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the as-prepared catalyst (20 mg) in a solution composed of 750 μL of deionized water, 200 μL of isopropyl alcohol, and 50 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 100 μL of the catalyst ink was added dropwise onto carbon fiber paper (Toray) and dried under an infrared lamp. Polarization curves were obtained using linear sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 8 mV s−1 and were corrected for the ohmic potential drop (iR) losses, where R is the series resistance of the electrochemical cell as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, ERHE = E versus RHE) using an equation (ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.0591 pH + 0.098). EIS measurements were performed at frequencies ranging from 200 kHz to 50 mHz with an amplitude of 25 mV. In order to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of each sample, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the samples was determined by cyclic voltammetry in the non-faradaic potential region at different scan rates of 20–100 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. The MnV2O6 nanobelts were prepared by a hydrothermal method at 200 °C using Mn(NO3)2·xH2O and NH4VO3 as precursors. The as-synthesized MnV2O6 nanobelts were mixed with graphene nanosheets (10, 20, and 30 wt%) in ethanol using high energy mechanical milling to fabricate MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposites. The graphene content in the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposites measured using an elemental (C, N, S) analyzer was consistent with the starting content.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized MnV2O6 and MnV2O6/graphene (20 wt%) nanocomposite, respectively. Both diffraction patterns were well matched with the monoclinic brannerite structure of MnV2O6 (ICDD # 01-072-1837), indicating that crystalline MnV2O6 was successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method and no phase change occurred during the high energy mechanical milling process. The diffraction peak for graphene at ∼26° was not detected in the pattern of the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite. The intensity of the (−202) peak was relatively strong in both samples implying that the as-synthesized MnV2O6 has an anisotropic morphology, which is aligned or oriented.

The chemical states of the as-prepared MnV2O6 and MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite were examined by XPS and the obtained spectra of both samples were basically identical (Fig. 1b–e and Fig. S1†). The survey scan of the XPS spectra showed the presence of Mn, V, O, and C elements (Fig. 1b). The Mn 2p XPS spectrum exhibited two obvious peaks at 641.5 and 653.4 eV corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively, arising from Mn2+.29,30 The V 2p XPS spectrum presented two peaks at 516.4 and 524.0 eV, originating from V5+, which correspond to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.29,30 The O 1s XPS spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks located at 530.2 eV and 532.4 eV, which can be attributed to the O–H groups and lattice oxygen, respectively.29,30
The morphology of the as-synthesized MnV2O6 and MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite was observed by SEM as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The as-synthesized MnV2O6 showed the belt-like morphology with a length of 5–10 μm (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows that the as-synthesized MnV2O6 nanobelts were homogeneously mixed with graphene nanosheets to form the interfaces between two materials, and the thickness of the nanobelts was tens of nanometers, similar to that of graphene nanosheets (Fig. S2†). The morphology of the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite was further investigated by TEM and the micron-sized MnV2O6 nanobelts were wrapped with graphene nanosheets (Fig. 2c). In addition, the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and EDS mapping images indicated that elements Mn, V, and O were homogeneously distributed throughout the MnV2O6 nanobelts (Fig. 2d–h).

To evaluate the OER catalytic activity of the as-synthesized materials, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature using a three-electrode system. Fig. 3a shows the iR-corrected LSV curves acquired for bare carbon fiber paper (CFP), MnV2O6 deposited on CFP (MVO), and MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposites deposited on CFP with different graphene contents of 10 and 20 wt% (MVO/G-10 and MVO/G-20, respectively) at a scan rate of 8 mV s−1. The overpotential required to reach a current density (j) of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) was used as the established standard for comparison of the catalytic activity. The observed η10 values of MVO, MVO/G-10, and MVO/G-20 were 1256, 424, and 396 mV, respectively. Noticeably, the MVO/G nanocomposites exhibited a much lower overpotential than that of MVO, which clearly indicates the synergistic enhancement of the OER activity by forming the interface between the MnV2O6 nanobelts and conductive graphene nanosheets. In addition, as shown in the corresponding Tafel plots (η vs. log(j)), MVO/G nanocomposites show a much lower Tafel slope of 66 mV dec−1 for both MVO/G-10 and MVO/G-20 than that of MVO of 232 mV dec−1, demonstrating a more rapid kinetics at the surface of the OER process (Fig. 3b). The enhancement of the OER activity of the MVO/G nanocomposites could be attributed to high electrical conductivity and more catalytically active sites of nanocomposites deposited on CFP. When the graphene content in the nanocomposites increased to 30 wt% (MVO/G-30), the observed η10 was 491 mV, which was larger than that of MVO/G-10 and MVO/G-20, and the OER polarization curve was continuously changed with cycles (Fig. S3a†). A similar variation with cycles has been observed in the LSV curve for bare graphene deposited on CFP (Fig. S3b†) and thus, an excess amount of graphene nanosheets present in MVO/G-30 was oxidized similar to bare graphene under an applied potential. Based on the observed LSV curves, 20 wt% of graphene in the nanocomposite was found to be optimal to achieve both good activity and durability, and the obtained OER activity was comparable to the best values for the transition metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites (Table S1†).

Nyquist plots of (c) MVO, (d) MVO/G-10, and (e) MVO/G-20 measured at 1.5464 V, 1.5964 V, and 1.6464 V versus the RHE. The inset in (c) depicts the corresponding equivalent circuit model used to extract the series resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct). 
To investigate the mechanistic basis for the enhanced OER activity of MVO/G nanocomposites, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of all the electrodes were compared. The ECSA values of MVO, MVO/G-10, and MVO/G-20 were estimated by measuring the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) data across a potential range with no faradaic current.31 The CVs were collected at various scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s−1 in the potential range of 1.156–1.246 V versus RHE (Fig. S4a–c†). The difference (Δj) of anodic and cathodic current densities at 1.2 V versus RHE was plotted as a function of scan rate and Cdl was determined as half of the slope of the linearly fitted line (Fig. S4d–f†).32 The Cdl value for MVO/G-10 (8.51 mF cm−2) and MVO/G-20 (12.78 mF cm−2) was much higher than that of MVO (68 μF cm−2). The higher Cdl value and ECSA of the MVO/G nanocomposites can be attributed to the activation of the catalytically active sites on the nanocomposite surface.
In order to further investigate the improved electrode kinetics of the MVO/G nanocomposites, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. Fig. 3c–e show the Nyquist plots acquired at three different potentials of 1.5464, 1.5964, and 1.6464 V versus the RHE for MVO, MVO/G-10, and MVO/G-20, respectively. The corresponding equivalent electrical circuit consists of the series resistance (Rs), which includes the electrolyte resistance, contact resistance, and intrinsic resistance of the electrode, the charge transfer resistance (Rct), and the constant phase element (CPE).33 The Rs value was 4.97, 4.86, and 4.71 Ω for MVO, MVO/G-10, and MVO/G-20, respectively, and it slightly decreased with increasing graphene content. The Rct value was greatly affected by the applied potential, and both the semi-circle diameter and measured Rct decreased with the increasing applied potential. The Rct value acquired for pristine MVO was 16.4, 12.9, and 7.6 kΩ at the applied potentials of 1.5464, 1.5964, and 1.6464 V versus RHE, respectively. The MVO/G nanocomposites exhibited much lower Rct values than the pristine MVO. Specifically, the Rct value at each applied potential was found to be 208.1, 18.4, and 4.7 Ω for MVO/G-10 and 110.8, 11.1, and 3.8 Ω for MVO/G-20, respectively. The obtained Rs and Rct values indicate that MVO/G-20 has the highest electrical conductivity and the most effective electron transfer ability. From the LSV, CV, and EIS results for the MVO and MVO/G nanocomposites, the high catalytic activity of the MVO/G nanocomposites is believed to be derived from further activation of the ECSA on the nanocomposite surface, resulting from the improved electrical conductivity and electron transfer by forming the interface and conductive network between MnV2O6 and graphene nanosheets.
The durability and steady-state electrocatalytic activity are also important and challenging characteristics to realize practical electrocatalysts. For this reason, the stability test of MVO, MVO/G-10, and MVO/G-20 was performed using LSV with a long-term cycling process. Fig. 4a–c show the polarization curves after the 1st and 1000th cycles in the range between 0.646 and 1.646 V versus the RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and their comparison of overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is presented in Fig. 4d. For MVO, a very small shift of the overpotential from 1256 to 1274 mV was observed after the 1000th cycle (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, no shift of the polarization curve was observed for both MVO/G-10 and MVO/G-20, maintaining overpotentials of 424 and 396 mV, respectively, during 1000 cycles. EIS and ECSA measurements were conducted on MVO/G-20 after 1000 CV cycles (Fig. S5a–c†) and the obtained results showed that the Rct and Cdl values were not significantly changed after the cycling test, indicating the high durability and stability of the MVO/graphene nanocomposites. In addition, the preliminary post-mortem characterization of the MVO/G-20 electrocatalyst after 1000 CV cycles was performed using XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS (Fig. S6–S8†), but more detailed studies are required to obtain more insight into the structural and compositional changes of the MVO electrocatalyst during the OER. Based on the LSV curves and continuous CV cycling test, it can be concluded that the MnV2O6/G nanocomposite is an excellent OER electrocatalyst with high durability and high activity for water splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully fabricated a brannerite structure MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite through the facile hydrothermal method and high energy mechanical milling process and introduced it as an efficient OER electrocatalyst for water splitting. The MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite showed an enhanced OER activity, which is believed to be derived from further activation of the ECSA on the nanocomposite surface, resulting from the improved electrical conductivity and electron transfer by forming the interface between MnV2O6 and graphene nanosheets. The MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite deposited on CFP with a graphene ratio of 20 wt% exhibited a superior electrocatalytic OER performance with a low η10 value of 396 mV and a Tafel slope value of 66 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, including high stability and durability even after 1000 CV cycles. The achieved results indicated that the MnV2O6/graphene nanocomposite is a promising candidate as an OER electrocatalyst for water splitting with superior performance and cost-effectiveness.
