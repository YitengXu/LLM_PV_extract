    , Accepted 13th May 2020First published on 14th May 2020AbstractThis study introduces a new concept of reactive carbonate composites (RCCs) for thermochemical energy storage, where a BaCO3–BaSiO3 mixture offers a successful thermodynamic destabilisation of BaCO3 with moderate cyclic stability ∼60%, close to the theoretical maximum when considering unreactive impurities. This research presents an alternative to molten salt based energy storage technology that operates at higher temperature (850 °C) and hence maintains a higher Carnot efficiency at a competitive price level, enabling the development of a thermal energy storage system more favourable than state-of-the-art technology. Finally, the addition of catalytic quantities of CaCO3 to the RCC significantly improves the reaction kinetics (one order of magnitude) through the formation of intermediate Ba2−xCaxSiO4 compounds, which are hypothesised to facilitate Ba2+ and O2− mobility through induced crystal defects.
Introduction
Large-scale storage of renewable energy from solar or wind power is a prerequisite for covering base-load energy demand in the future as these energy sources are intermittent in their nature. Attention is often pointed towards hydrogen as an energy carrier, concentrated solar thermal power, or large-scale lithium battery facilities.1–5 However, cost is a major issue with these storage options. Concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) plants currently store energy using a KNO3/NaNO3 (60:40) molten salt, which has a low specific heat capacity of 1.53 kJ kg−1 K−1, i.e. a low energy density ≤ 413 kJ kg−1 when ΔT ≤ 270 °C, and operates below 550 °C, which leads to a low Carnot efficiency when converting the heat into electricity.6 Although, most research into metal carbonates is focused on CO2 sequestration,7,8 this class of materials have also been identified as promising for thermal energy storage due to their high enthalpy of formation and the low cost.1,6,9–12 The latter suggest to expand the application of thermal energy storage from CSP plants to a new technology defined as a thermal battery, where the energy input may be concentrated solar, industrial waste heat, energy from wind power, photovoltaics etc., which is stored and released through a chemical reaction.13
Witherite, the thermodynamically stable phase of BaCO3, is industrially produced from naturally mined barite (BaSO4) through the reaction with coke, also known as the ‘black ash’ process, and has a reasonable price of ∼$494 USD per metric tonne.14 However, pristine BaCO3 is thermally stable and decomposes at 1150–1400 °C,15 which is, perhaps, too high from an application point of view. Thus, thermodynamic destabilisation of the BaCO3 is necessary. A recent study on: Li2CO3(s) + Li2SiO3(s) ↔ Li4SiO4(s) + CO2(g) ΔH700°C = 109.0 kJ mol−1(1)suggests a destabilised metal carbonate as a thermochemical energy storage material operating at 700 °C,16 however, only 5 cycles were performed at low CO2 pressure (<0.4 bar). A disadvantage of this particular system is that Li is expensive (battery grade, 99.9%, Li2CO3 was on average $17000 USD per metric tonne in 2018, >30 times the price of BaCO3),17 and thus limits its utilisation in large-scale facilities. This study elaborates on the concept and introduces a new reactive carbonate composite (RCC). The incorporation of barium orthosilicate, BaSiO3, improves the thermodynamics of BaCO3 and thus enables the BaCO3–BaSiO3 system to operate in a suitable temperature range between 700–1000 °C as: BaCO3(s) + BaSiO3(s) ↔ Ba2SiO4(s) + CO2(g)(2)
Thermodynamics of the RCC BaCO3–BaSiO3 was evaluated using the software HSC Chemistry.18 The predicted temperature where the reaction has an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar (T1 bar) was determined to be 670 °C with ΔH670°C = 151.9 kJ mol−1 CO2. However, an increased working temperature of 850 °C was selected, where the thermodynamic predictions are peq = 18.1 bar and ΔH850°C = 126.9 kJ mol−1 CO2.
Experimental
Sample preparation
BaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥99%), CaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus), and BaSiO3 (Alfa Aesar) were used as-purchased. BaSiO3 was synthesised in the laboratory by heating a ball-milled 1:1.17 molar mixture of BaCO3 and SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%, nanopowder, 10–20 nm particle size) to 1000 °C for six hours in air.
Samples of BaCO3–BaSiO3 were prepared in various molar ratios, see Table 1, and were ball-milled in stainless steel milling vials with stainless steel balls (10 mm diameter, ball-to-powder mass ratio of 11:1) using an Across International Planetary Ball Mill (PQ-N04). A sequence of 20 min milling and a 1 min break, which is repeated three times to achieve an accumulated milling time of 1 hour, was applied.

Thermal analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA) was simultaneously performed on a Mettler Toledo DSC 1 instrument by heating ∼15–25 mg of sample in an Al2O3 crucible from room temperature to 1200 °C under flowing argon atmosphere (20 mL min−1) at ΔT/Δt = 10, 20, or 30 °C min−1. For comparison, CO2 cycled samples were first absorbed and then analysed at three heating rates (as above) to construct Kissinger plots and determine their activation energy.
Sievert's measurements
Pressure cycling measurements were performed on a HyEnergy PCTpro E&E using a custom built SiC sample holder.19 Samples (typical mass ∼ 2.4 g) were generally heated to 850 °C (ΔT/Δt ∼ 4 °C min−1) at p(CO2) ∼ 1 bar to avoid decomposition of the CaCO3 catalyst. The temperature was kept isothermal throughout the measurements and CO2 pressure cycling was initiated between carbonation at p(CO2) ∼ 21 bar for 12 hours and decomposition at p(CO2) ∼ 3 bar for 12 hours. As reaction kinetics become faster with increasing cycle numbers, the carbonation/decomposition times were adjusted to 1, 3, or 6 hour(s). The samples were cycled from 20–35 carbonation and calcination cycles. At all times, the total gas volume used was 194.06 cm3 (158.43 cm3 reference volume and 35.63 cm3 sample volume) and the non-ambient volume was determined to be between 13.8 to 15.5 cm3. All data was manually corrected from the PCTPro to include the correct volumes and compressibility factors for gaseous CO2.20 The cycling was ceased when the sample was in the absorbed state and cooled under a backpressure of CO2. However, in some cases, samples were decomposed at 850 °C and analysed to determine the reaction decomposition products.
In-house powder X-ray diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction data was collected in-house on a Bruker D8 Advance equipped with a Cu X-ray source (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.540593 Å, Cu Kα2 radiation, λ = 1.544414 Å) in flat-plate Bragg–Brentano geometry. Data were collected in the 2θ range 5–80° on a Lynxeye PSD detector. The as-synthesised BaSiO3 was further investigated by adding a known 21.2 wt% NIST LaB6 standard to quantify the amorphous fraction of the sample.

In situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction

In situ time-resolved synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron, Melbourne, Australia using the Powder Diffraction (PD) beamline.21 The wavelength was λ = 0.825018 Å and data were collected on a Mythen microstrip detector in two different positions with a data acquisition time of 30 s in each position. Samples were packed in quartz capillaries (o.d. 0.7 mm, wall thickness 0.05 mm) and mounted in a custom gas fitting sealed with rubber rings, which was then connected to a gas manifold that provided vacuum or CO2. During data acquisition, the samples were continuously oscillated over 90° to prevent preferred orientation of the particles. Finally, the samples were heated with a hot air blower at ΔT/Δt = 6 °C min−1. Diffraction patterns were quantitatively analysed using the Rietveld method in the software TOPAS (Bruker-AXS).
Scanning electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted using a Zeiss Neon 40EsB equipped with a field emission gun. The SEM images were collected using an accelerating voltage of 5 kV, an aperture size of 30 μm, and a working distance between 2.5–7 mm. SEM samples were prepared by embedding powdered samples in an epoxy resin that was polished using colloidal silica, which were then sputter coated with a 10 nm thick carbon layer.
Results & discussion
Destabilisation of BaCO3 utilising BaSiO3
From TG-DSC data it is evident that BaCO3 is destabilised by BaSiO3, see Fig. 1, where a mass loss (CO2) is detected at lower temperatures. For both pristine BaCO3 and the RCC, BaCO3–BaSiO3 (S1), a polymorphic phase transition is observed for BaCO3 at ∼815 °C from an orthorhombic (space group Pmcn) to a trigonal structure (R3m),22 which has previously been reported to occur at ∼750 °C and 805 °C.23–25 A second polymorphic phase transition is observed at ∼974 °C from the trigonal to cubic structure (Fmm).24–26 The TG data reveal that pristine BaCO3 decomposes above 1000 °C, whereas the RCC initiates decomposition at ∼650 °C, releasing CO2. Hence, the operational temperature of BaCO3 becomes more favourable for applications when destabilised by BaSiO3. Additional information is provided in Fig. S1–S3.†

Cyclic energy capacity studies
The cyclic CO2 storage stability is evaluated from the Sieverts experiments (see Fig. 2). Sample S1 maintains a steady ∼40–45% CO2 capacity during 12 hour calcination/carbonation cycles. The low capacity is partly assigned to slow reaction kinetics during CO2 release and absorption from the pristine BaSiO3–BaCO3 system, see Fig. 3 and S4.† Thus, an attempt to catalyse the CO2 absorption and release was undertaken using CaCO3, which shows excellent kinetics in its pure form.13 Previously, a solid-solution regime has been reported for Ca1−xBaxCO3 above ∼850 °C.27 Thus, it was hypothesised that this solid solution could enhance the CO2 and/or Ba2+ diffusion through the metal carbonate. Addition of 2.5 (S2) and 5 mol% (S3) CaCO3 influences the cyclic capacity to a small extent (∼45% and ∼37% CO2 capacity, respectively). However, the addition of a larger quantity, i.e. 10 mol%, of CaCO3 reduces the CO2 capacity to ∼20–25%. Sample S5 increases in capacity for the first 15 cycles before stabilising at ∼60% and thus proves superior to the other samples (see Fig. 2). The absorption/desorption time was decreased to 5 hours as the sample reached a plateau within this time frame, see also Fig. S4.† Despite the reduction in time, the capacity increases along with reaction kinetics. Hence, an activation of the sample, possibly through the formation of Ba2−xCaxSiO4 (c.f. Powder X-ray diffraction section) and homogenisation of the sample seem necessary.
 Fig. 2  Comparison of the cyclic CO2 storage capacity after calcination in each cycle. S1 is the uncatalysed BaCO3–BaSiO3 while S2–S4 are CaCO3 catalysed with various amounts of CaCO3, while S5 is catalysed with 0.105 mol CaCO3 and contains synthesised BaSiO3. Calcination/carbonation times vary and are indicated in the following way: 2 hours (▲); 3 hours (◆); 4 hours (■); 5 hours (); 6 hours (); 12 hours (●). 
 Fig. 3  Comparison of the reaction kinetics in the 15th desorption highlighting the positive effect of adding CaCO3 to the system. 
Although the CO2 capacity suffers from adding a large amount of CaCO3 to the system, the reaction kinetics improve significantly (see Fig. 3). The difference is apparent in the 15th desorption, where calcination is ∼10 times faster in sample S2 compared to the pristine RCC, sample S1, (∼40 min compared to ∼4.5 hours, respectively). Generally, the calcination reaction kinetics for samples S2 through S5 are more than doubled compared to sample S1 (see Fig. S4†).
Powder X-ray diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) data indicate that the as-purchased BaSiO3 (Alfa Aesar) contains multiple Ba–Si–O compositions (see Fig. S5†), since the as-milled samples (S1–S4) contain major fractions of, e.g. Ba4Si6O16 (barium-poor). Hence, the decreased cyclic CO2 capacity, which is close to half of that expected, is attributed to the fact that the commercial BaSiO3 contains a large amount of impurities, which retards reaction (2). However, quantification of the amorphous fraction is not possible through Rietveld refinement as unidentified crystalline compounds are also present. Sample S5, containing the synthesised BaSiO3, is a more homogenous mixture of BaCO3 and BaSiO3 and hence the cyclic capacity is superior (see Fig. 2 and S6†). However, impurities of Ba4Si6O16 and an amorphous content (likely SiO2) are still an issue (see Fig. S6†), and thus the BaSiO3 content only amounts to 62.1 wt% of what is expected. Hence, the cyclic capacity of sample S5 is theoretically decreased to 62.4%, due to the lower amount of BaSiO3 available for reaction (2), and thus proves that the sample's cyclic stability is close to the theoretical maximum when considering the unreactive impurities. The addition of small quantities of CaCO3 does not influence the PXD pattern of the ball-milled samples due to overlapping Bragg reflections and the smaller X-ray scattering power of Ca2+ compared to Ba2+ (see Fig. S5†).
After CO2 pressure cycling of BaCO3–BaSiO3 (S1) it is evident that reaction (2) is occurring through absorption and desorption of CO2 (see Fig. 4A). However, Bragg reflections from BaSiO3 are still present after CO2 absorption due to an incomplete reaction although an intensity decrease is observed due to consumption. The addition of CaCO3 to the system proved to enhance reaction kinetics significantly during cyclic measurements. The increased kinetics are in-fact not assigned to the hypothesised Ca1−xBaxCO3,27 but to the formation of Ba2−xCaxSiO4 that offers increased cation mobility of Ba2+ as the smaller Ca2+ cation introduces defects in the Ba2SiO4 crystal structure28,29 (see Fig. 4B and reaction scheme (3)). The composition of Ba2−xCaxSiO4 varies depending on the absorbed or desorbed state of the sample and the loading level of CaCO3. Higher loading of CaCO3 leads to a higher fraction of Ba2−xCaxSiO4 after cycling, probably due to an extended reaction between CaCO3 and BaSiO3, which may cause the significantly lower cyclic capacity observed in sample S4. The findings imply that CaCO3 has reacted with BaSiO3 to form Ca2SiO4, which is favourable according to thermodynamic calculations, see reaction scheme (4):18 (1 − x)Ba2SiO4 (s) + xCa2SiO4 (s) → Ba2−2xCa2xSiO4 (s)(3) 2CaCO3 (s) + BaSiO3 (s) → Ca2SiO4 (s) + BaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) T1 bar = 450 °C ΔGr ≈ 0 J mol−1(4)

Reaction scheme (4) suggests that a higher loading of BaSiO3 is necessary to increase the CO2 cyclic capacity, as a part of the BaSiO3 is consumed in this reaction and thus is not available for reaction with BaCO3 to cycle through reaction scheme (2). This is further supported by TGA data on sample S5 after 25 cycles and absorption, where two calcination steps are observed; the first from reaction (2) and the second from leftover BaCO3 (see Fig. S3†).
Insight into the reaction mechanism using in situ powder X-ray diffraction
The in situ SR-PXD data of BaCO3–BaSiO3 (S1) supports the in-house PXD, as the initial sample primarily contains witherite but also a range of Ba–Si–O compounds, i.e. BaSiO3, BaSi2O5, Ba4Si6O16, and Ba5Si8O21 (see Fig. 5). Upon heating, the witherite undergoes a first-order polymorphic transition into its high-temperature polymorph (space-group Rm, BaCO3-HT) between T ∼ 782 and 835 °C. Simultaneously, Bragg reflections from the reaction product Ba2SiO4 appear at T ∼ 782 °C. The Bragg reflections from BaCO3-HT indicate that one, or more, unit cell axes expand while one or more contract as some reflections move towards lower angle and some towards higher angle, respectively. Bragg reflections from BaCO3-HT disappear at T ∼ 940 °C, however, the low temperature polymorph is not re-formed upon cooling, hence it is concluded that BaCO3 is consumed in reaction (2). The slow and continuous formation of Ba2SiO4 at T ∼ 940 °C supports the broad DSC signal previously observed over a wide temperature range as reaction kinetics are slow (see Fig. 1). During cooling, the Ba2SiO4 undergoes thermal contraction. Similarly, in situ SR-PXD data of BaCO3–BaSiO3–0.224CaCO3 (S4) is presented in Fig. S7,† while the main difference at high temperature (850 °C) between samples S1 and S4 is highlighted in Fig. 6. The presence of Ba2−xCaxSiO4 and a lower fraction of Ba2SiO4 in sample S4 is believed to be the reason for the major difference observed in reaction kinetics.

Influence on activation energy
The activation energy, Ea, was determined for the calcination (CO2 release) of BaCO3 in the as-milled and cycled samples of BaCO3–BaSiO3 (S1), BaCO3–BaSiO3–0.052CaCO3 (S2), and BaCO3–BaSiO3–0.105CaCO3 (S5) based on Kissinger's relation: ln[β/Tp2] = −Ea/RTp + A(5)here, β is the heating rate, Tp is the DSC peak temperature for calcination, Ea is the activation energy of calcination, R is the gas constant, and A is a reaction specific constant. The sample (S1) was thus calcinated at three different heating rates, i.e. ΔT/Δt = 10, 20, and 30 K min−1 (Fig. 7a) and the peak endotherm temperature was determined to be 994, 1040, and 1065 °C, respectively. A Kissinger plot was constructed (Fig. 7b), and the activation energy for calcination of the BaCO3–BaSiO3 composite (S1) was determined to 195 ± 7 kJ mol−1. In comparison, the calcination activation energy of pristine BaCO3 has been reported between 283–305 kJ mol−1 (vacuum and argon flow, respectively).24,30 Hence, a significant decrease in the decomposition activation energy is observed in the thermodynamically destabilised BaCO3–BaSiO3 composite. The activation energy was further determined for the BaCO3–BaSiO3 reactive carbonate composite after 35 cycles of calcination/carbonation and it is evident that the activation energy increases slightly to 210 ± 10 kJ mol−1, which agrees well with the rather constant reaction kinetics observed throughout cycling (see Fig. S4†).

(C) The Kissinger plot of BaCO3–BaSiO3–0.052CaCO3 (S2). The slope of the Kissinger plot makes it possible to extract the activation energy, Ea, of calcination. 
The opposite effect is observed for the CaCO3 catalysed sample (S2), where an activation energy for the as-milled sample is determined to be 236 ± 7 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 7c), which is slightly higher than that for the primary BaCO3–BaSiO3 composite (S1). It is hypothesised to be due to either a slight difference in particle size arising from ball-milling or the additional reaction of Ca2+ incorporation into the Ba2SiO4 structure. However, after the conducted cyclic measurements, the activation energy is eventually lowered to 158 ± 5 kJ mol−1 after 34 cycles (see Fig. 7c), which is lower than the uncatalysed sample and in agreement with the observed increase in reaction kinetics, see Fig. S4.† The DSC data for sample S2 is presented in Fig. S8† while the activation energies of sample S5 is presented in Fig. S9.†
Sample morphology
The as-milled samples of BaCO3–BaSiO3(–CaCO3, 2.5, 5, and 10 wt%; S1–S4, respectively) all reveal large particles are present (>10 μm), which are identified through EDS mapping to be Ba depleted and mainly contain Si and O, i.e. SiO2 (see Fig. 8a). The presence of large SiO2 particles are still evident after CO2 cycling of the samples, illustrated by sample S2 in Fig. 8b. Hence, this impurity, present in the commercial BaSiO3, does not participate in the reaction and thus the low cyclic capacity of <50% is believed to be due to the discrepancy in molar ratio between BaCO3 and BaSiO3. The SiO2 was not identified through PXD and is thus believed to be amorphous.

The BaCO3–BaSiO3(synthesised)–0.105CaCO3 sample (S5) does not contain large SiO2 particles, possibly due to the starting reagent being nanoparticle size, and thus the sample is more homogenous and leads to a higher energy capacity through increased reactivity. Generally, sintering seems not to be an issue, as seen in other carbonate systems,9 as the reverse reaction (reaction scheme (2)) ensures segregation of the reactants whilst maintaining a good surface contact. The as-milled sample S5 has calcium and silicon rich regions (see Fig. S10†). However, after cycling and absorption, the elements are well distributed in the sample as evident from Fig. 8c. This may also explain the stabilisation in reaction kinetics after cycling, once the sample morphology is uniform.
Cost analysis
A cost comparison between the developed BaCO3-based thermochemical energy storage material, the state-of-the-art molten salt and a previously suggested Li2CO3-based material is given in Table 2. Although the Li2CO3–Li2SiO3 system shows a good cyclability at ∼100% over 5 cycles at 700 °C, the expensive LiCO3 makes the materials cost for producing a thermal energy storage system capable of storing 1 TJe ∼10 times more expensive than molten salts. Thus, an energy storage system based on this material is unlikely to be commercial. Additionally, the high cyclic stability is attributed to melting of Li2CO3, which enhances CO2 diffusivity, but also increases requirements for the materials container to avoid molten salt corrosivity, i.e. the engineering costs may also be increased. Contrary, the BaCO3–BaSiO3 system materials are ∼40% cheaper than molten salt while the footprint of the system is also reduced (∼1/3), which makes it worth considering as a successor for current technology. The higher operating temperature (850 vs. 550 °C) and thus higher Carnot efficiency is favourable and makes the system compatible with the Rankine–Brayton combined cycle and Stirling engines for thermal to electrical energy conversion.32 Finally, abundance of the materials play a crucial role, i.e. BaCO3 is widely available, whereas shortage of battery-quality lithium and other battery components, e.g. cobalt, may become an issue if large-scale thermal energy storage and electrical vehicles adopt lithium-ion batteries as their main storage system.17,33,34

Conclusions
Thermodynamic destabilisation of BaCO3 is achieved by addition of BaSiO3, which promotes a chemical reaction on CO2 release resulting in a lowering of the decomposition temperature of BaCO3 by more than 350 °C. Hence, BaCO3 is tailored for utilisation in thermal energy storage applications. The commercial sample of BaSiO3 contains a large quantity of impurities, e.g. large particles of SiO2, which hampers the cyclic energy storage capacity of the BaCO3–BaSiO3 system compared to the more pure, synthesised BaSiO3, which provides the highest energy capacity retention, i.e. ∼60%, which is very close to the theoretical maximum determined to be 62.4%. The capacity may be improved by optimising the molar ratio of BaCO3 to BaSiO3 and CaCO3 as the formation of Ca2SiO4 and eventually Ba2−xCaxSiO4 is evident, while unreacted SiO2 is also found in sample S5. Hence, BaSiO3 and BaCO3 are consumed, which leaves a discrepancy in molar ratio causing an energy capacity loss as the pristine BaCO3 is thermodynamically too stable to calcine at the physical conditions applied here. Addition of CaCO3 in various amounts, i.e. 2.5–10 mol%, significantly improves the reaction kinetics by up to 10 times, through the formation of Ba2−xCa2xSiO4 intermediates. However, addition of 10 mol% influences the energy capacity negatively. The possibility to significantly improve reaction kinetics by introducing a second metal carbonate is a new, interesting approach, which opens up new avenues for future research in this materials class for thermal energy storage. Finally, it is proven here that BaCO3 is able to operate at 850 °C, which is suitable in combination with a Stirling engine. However, lowering the temperature to 670 °C where the equilibrium pressure is 1 bar makes it suitable to combine with commercially available steam turbines, and may thus be worth further investigation.
