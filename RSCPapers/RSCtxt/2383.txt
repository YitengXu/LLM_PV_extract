    , Accepted 10th June 2014First published on 12th June 2014AbstractThe oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion containing bimolecular system of acceptor (9,10-dinaphthylanthracene) and sensitizer (Pd(II)tetratolylporphyrin), i.e., upconverted o/w microemulsion, was firstly reported for the triplet–triplet annihilated upconversion (TTA-UC) by temperature effects. The correlation between structure/up-conversion performance of three 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes doped with Pd(II)tetratolylporphyrin were investigated. Under excitation at an ultralow power density at 60 mW cm−2, the up-converted o/w microemulsion emits green-to-blue upconversion and an efficiency (ΦUC) increase is accompanied by an increase in temperature. The maximum ΦUC value for the upconverted o/w microemulsion obtained was as high as 33.12%, which is comparable to its counterpart in a pure organic solvent. Very importantly, there is no need for the upconverted o/w microemulsion to deaerate, which is of critical importance for applications such as upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, the current study represents a simple approach to obtain high TTA-UC without degassing.
Introduction
Two-photon absorption (TPA) is a nonlinear optical process,1–3 in which a molecule simultaneously absorbs two photons via a virtual state toward the excited state and usually results in photon-upconversion. Although TPA-based upconversion exhibits valuable potential applications such as upconversion lasing,4 two-photon polymerization5 and photodynamic therapy,6,7 it always needs very high excitation intensity, as high as hundreds of MW–GM cm−2 (one million times as large as solar energy),8 which leads to a serious limitation for its application. Alternatively, another photon-upconversion mechanism has already received much attention recently, which is called triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion.9,10 TTA upconversion (TTA-UC) is also a nonlinear optical process,11 which involves a bimolecular system (i.e., sensitizer/acceptor). TTA-UC undergoes a series of multiple quantum processes:12 (i) the sensitizer first absorbs one photon to the excited singlet state and goes across its triplet excited state by intersystem crossing (ISC); (ii) then, the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) occurs from the sensitizer to the acceptor, and then two triplet acceptors actualize the triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) with the result that photon-upconversion is produced. Note that such TTA upconversion can be obtained at very low excitation intensity (less than 100 mW cm−2, solar energy is enough);13,14 thus, it could be applied in many practical applications such as photovoltaics,15 photocatalysis,16 photodynamic therapy of cancer,17 and displays18 as well as the solar cells.19 For example, in a single-junction solar cell, the unabsorbed long-wavelength transmission light can be efficiently upconverted into absorbable photons through upconversion materials, which makes its theoretical efficiency reach a 1.33 fold increase in comparison with materials without upconversion.19,20 However, the TTA upconversion materials work efficiently only at shorter wavelengths ≤750 nm.21 Moreover, since TTA-UC relies exclusively on the efficient generation of triplet excited states of both the sensitizer and acceptor, dissolved O2 can strongly annihilate the triplets formed.22,23 Thus, the medium for upconversion must be devoid of oxygen to prevent triplet-state quenching, which is absolutely not ideal for most TTA-UC applications. Although lots of efforts have been made to achieve TTA-UC in an aerated environment by embedding chromophores in rubbery polymeric matrices,24–26 encapsulating chromophores with rigid polymer shells,27−30 loading chromophores into silica nanoparticles,31 as well as even incorporating the upconverting dyes in micellar carriers,32 all of these techniques have shown some intrinsic limitations in either their complicated preparation processes or very low UC-efficiency (less than 6% at an excitation intensity of 100 mW cm−2). Of the mentioned techniques, microemulsification is a simple method, widely used for encapsulation in micelles by surfactants to produce nanoparticles including metals,33 semiconductor nanoparticles34 and polymer-based TTA up-conversion nanoparticles.35 However, to the best of our knowledge, few reports have been published that obtain high TTA-UC efficiency in an o/w microemulsion with temperature effects.
In this paper, we have demonstrated for the first time that an o/w microemulsion can act as an effective medium for TTA-UC performance by temperature tuning. This o/w (oil-in-water) microemulsion using a nonionic surfactant as emulsifier can be reversibly converted into a w/o (water-in-oil) microemulsion with a phase inversion temperature (PIT);36,37i.e., in the upconverted o/w microemulsion, the nanometer-sized droplets of oil containing sensitizer/acceptor pair can disperse into a water-rich continuous phase at room temperature. When the temperature is increased, the nanometer-sized droplets of water conversely be dispersed in an oil-rich continuous phase, in which the soluble sensitizer/acceptor would freely collide with each other. As a result, the enhanced upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) in the microemulsion medium could be comparable to their counterpart in a pure organic solvent. In addition to the obvious advantages offered by an upconverted o/w microemulsion, such as the absence of toxic solutions, ease of fabrication, low cost and stability, the most important thing is that it presents a high upconversion efficiency (e.g., ΦUC = 33.12% at an excitation intensity of 60 mW cm−2) without the need of deaerating, which is of critical importance from a practical point of view.
Experimental
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or Acros Chemical Co. and used without any further purification. The synthesis details of three 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes (DNAMe, DNACl and DNACN) (Fig. 1) can be found in the ESI† section.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes (DNAMe, DNACl and DNACN) and triplet sensitizer (PdMeTPP). 
2.1 Preparation of the o/w microemulsion
Sensitizer (0.12 mM) and acceptor (1.2–48 mM) stock solutions were prepared prior to the experiment by dissolution in toluene and were kept in the dark prior to use.
To obtain the transparent upconverted oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion, 2 mL of the stock solutions were added into deionized water (18 mL) in the presence of Tween-20 (10 mL) at room temperature with stirring under N2 atmosphere. Thus, a series of the upconverted o/w microemulsions were obtained with diameters of 40–60 nm in size (see Fig. S1 in the ESI† section).
2.2 Characterization and measurements
Melting points (m.p.) were recorded on an X-5 melting point measurement instrument (Gongyi City Yuhua Instrument Co., Ltd). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Bruker Avance 300 MHz spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL-III instrument. UV-Vis absorption spectra have been measured with an Hitachi U-3500 recording spectrophotometer from quartz cuvettes of 1 cm path.
Steady-state emission and time-resolved decay curves were measured on an Edinburgh FLS 920 fluorophotometer equipped with a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) card. With the aid of nF 900 software, the prompt fluorescence lifetime (τF) was measured under detection of a nF lamp at room temperature, while the phosphorescence lifetime (τP) and delayed fluorescence lifetime (τDF) were measured at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere, under detection of a microsecond xenon flash lamp (Edinburgh Analytical Instruments, μF 900). The monoexponential fit for prompt fluorescence decay and diexponential fits for phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence decays give acceptable statistic parameters of χ2 < 1.1. χ2 is the “reduced chi-square”. Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were measured using quinine sulfate (in 0.1 mol dm3 aqueous NaOH, Φr = 0.53) as the standard according to a previously reported procedure.38
A diode solid laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2) was used as the excitation source for TTA upconversion, which was observed with PR655 SpectraScan colorimeter. Upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) was obtained relative to rhodamine 6G in ethanol according to eqn (1).24 (1)
Herein, the factor 2 accounts for the fact that two absorbed photons are required to produce one upconverted photon. Φr is the fluorescence quantum yield of rhodamine 6G, which is used as the reference standard (in ethanol, 0.5 μM; Φr = 0.88).39As and Ar are the absorbency of sensitizer and rhodamine 6G at the excitation wavelength, respectively. Fs and Fr are the integrated emission of acceptor and rhodamine 6G at the excitation wavelength, respectively. ηs and ηr are the refractive index of the solvent used in the sample and reference measurements, respectively.
2.3 Upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry
Upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry40,41 was achieved in a three-electrode cell (electrolyte: 1.0 M H2SO4 in H2O) with WO3 film (Eg = 2.7 eV) deposited on ITO glass used as the working electrode, a platinum rod as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) as the reference electrode. Firstly, a diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2) irradiated our upconverted o/w microemulsion to obtain a green-to-blue upconversion. Then, the blue upconversion photoactivates the WO3 working electrode and induces the photoelectrochemistry. The upconverted o/w microemulsion was filled inside a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path under an air atmosphere, which was placed near the working electrode. Thus, the shuttered current/time response of the WO3 photoanode biased to +0.33 V versus Ag/AgCl was recorded by a computer-controlled electrochemistry station.
Results and discussion
3.1 Absorption and emission
Being very interested in the enhancement TTA-UC efficiency (ΦUC), we designed a series of new 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes (Fig. 1), top-end-capped with a naphthyl group at the 9,10-position and flanked with different groups (such as –CH3, –Cl and –CN) at the 2-position of the anthracene ring, whose names are abbreviated as DNAMe, DNACl and DNACN, respectively. The triplet sensitizer, Pd(II)tetratolylporphyrin, abbreviated as PdMeTPP, is also presented.
9,10-Dinaphthylanthracenes show characteristic vibronic absorption bands in the range of 350–450 nm and the emission spectra present peaks at ∼430 nm for DNAMe and DNACl, while DNACN extends out to a longer wavelength at 452 nm due to its increasing molecular conjugation (Fig. 2a). The calculated fluorescence quantum yields (Φf, %) are in order of DNAMe (0.78) > DNACl (0.69) > DNACN (0.63), concomitant to their fluorescence lifetime (τF, ns), which increases from 3.81 ns (DNAMe) to 3.98 ns (DNACl) to 5.31 ns (DNACN) (see Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The yields obtained show that the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracene with a donating group (such as CH3–) at the 2-position exhibits a large radiation probability in comparison with those containing acceptor groups (such as –Cl and –CN). We noticed that the absorption and emission spectra of 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes in the o/w microemulsion medium are similar to those observed when DMF was used as the solvent (see Fig. 2a and S2†).

As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, the absorption spectrum of sensitizer PdMeTPP in the o/w microemulsion shows a 2 nm red-shift in comparison with that observed in DMF. Moreover, the emission bands located at 569 and 611 nm with nanosecond lifetimes were confirmed to be fluorescence decays while the bands located at ∼680 and ∼750 nm with microsecond lifetimes were confirmed to be phosphorescence decays.

 Fig. 3  Absorption and emission spectra of PdMeTPP in DMF and the o/w microemualsion (8 μM, the emission spectra were obtained at the excitation of the Q-band). 
Note that both the fluorescence and phosphorescence maxima of PdMeTPP are very similar in DMF and the o/w microemulsion, but the particular decay times are quite different. Relative to those in DMF, the lifetimes of fluorescence and phosphorescence are decreased in the o/w microemulsion (Table 2), accompanied by a dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3). The reason for these observed differences in the emission decay can be attributed to the confined space and unfree collisions between droplets in the o/w microemulsion opening the triplet state radiative relaxation pathway, which would have influence on the triplet-triplet annihilated upconversion.
3.2 Structure/TTA-UC performances in DMF
Under the excitation of the diode laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2), the green-to-blue upconversion from DNAMe was recorded (Fig. 4), in which the upconverted intensities exhibit almost quadratic integral enhancement (inset) as a function of incident power intensity at 10.89–55.97 mW cm−2. These results strongly suggest that the TTA-UC was a nonlinear optical process (as expressed in eqn (1): two absorbed photons are required to produce one upconverted photon, i.e., a quasi two-photon process).
 Fig. 4  Upconverted intensity of DNAMe following excitation of PdMeTPP (λex = 532 nm) measured as a function of incident power intensity (inset: nearly double logarithm plot of the normalized upconverted emission of DNAMe as a function of the normalized incident power intensity of the laser). 
Since the two-photon process can occur in concentrated solutions, the dependence of upconversion intensity on the concentration of the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes (acceptor) is shown in Fig. 5a–c. With an increase in acceptor concentration from 0.08 to 3.6 mM (doped with PdMeTPP at 8 μM), the upconverted intensities of the three 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes were remarkably increased, showing 14.2-fold (DNAMe), 7.4-fold (DNACl) and 4-fold (DNACN) enhancements. Correspondingly, the efficiencies (ΦUC) gave maximum values at 34.68% (DNAMe), 24.57% (DNACl) and 21.03% (DNACN), respectively (Fig. 6), which correlates with the TTT efficiency (ΦTTT) and TTA efficiency (ΦTTA), as well as the acceptor’ fluorescence quantum yield (Φf)i.e., ΦUC = ΦTTTΦTTAΦf.42

The triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) efficiency (ΦTTT) can be evaluated according to the Stern–Volmer eqn (2), where Po/P is the phosphorescence intensity of sensitizer without and with acceptor. τP and [Q] are the phosphorescence lifetime of sensitizer and the concentration of acceptor, respectively. KQ is the triplet-quenching constant, which can stand for the triplet-triplet energy transfer efficiency (ΦTTT). (2)
Thus, the relationship of Po/P and [Q] for the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes were plotted (Fig. 7) and the calculated triplet quenching constants (KQ) determined to be in the order of DNAMe (7.65 × 108 M−1 s−1) > DNACl (3.89 × 108 M−1 s−1) > DNACN (0.74 × 108 M−1 s−1), which approach the diffusion limit of the DMF solvent (8.3 × 109 M−1 s−1 at 25 °C).43 These results indicate that TTT is a diffusion-controlled process in the present experimental system. Based on the KQ values, one can see that the TTT efficiency (ΦTTT) were in the order of DNAMe > DNACl > DNACN.

The delayed fluorescence decay curves of the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes doped with PdMeTPP indicate that they have dual delayed fluorescence lifetimes (τDF1, τDF1) (Fig. 8a and Table 3), which was attributed to the dual phosphorescence of PdMeTPP (see Table 2). We noticed that the unconverted (residual) phosphorescence of PdMeTPP presents an almost reduced phosphorescence lifetime (τunp) in the presence of the acceptor (Fig. 8b). Furthermore, for the sensitizer PdMeTPP, the unconverted (residual) phosphorescence lifetime increase was accompanied by a decreased delayed fluorescence lifetime from DNACN (2.68, 13.37 μs), DNACl (2.28, 11.64 μs) to DNAMe (0.93, 10.11 μs), which have positive contributions to the triplet–triplet annihilated upconversion efficiency (see Table 3).

Based on the discussion of structure/TTA-UC performance correlations, it was found that the 9,10-dinaphthylanthracene flanked with a donating group (CH3–) at the 2-position exhibits a higher fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) (see Table 1), larger triplet quenching constant (KQ) and decreased delayed fluorescence lifetime (τDF) compared to those with an accepting group (CN– and Cl–). As a result, the efficient upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) could be obtained as high as 34.68% in DMF.
3.3 TTA-UC Performances in an o/w microemulsion
TTA-upconversion performances in an o/w microemulsion containing DNAMe and PdMeTPP were conducted without the need of deaerating. These transparent upconverted o/w microemulsions are stable in the environment for several months and exhibit not only the concentration-dependent upconverted intensity similar to those in a pure organic medium (Fig. S3†), but also temperature-dependent upconverted intensity (Fig. S4†). It is interpreted36 that the o/w microemulsion using a nonionic surfactant as emulsifier can be reversibly converted into a w/o microemulsion with the phase inversion temperature (PIT). Below the PIT the nonionic surfactant forming the microemulsion prefers a high curvature surface around oil, and above the PIT the surfactant prefers a high curvature surface around water.37 The o/w microemulsion possesses confined spaces that block the collision between the sensitizer and acceptor, which is deleterious to the upconversion performance. On the contrary, in the w/o microemulsion with an oil continuous phase, the soluble sensitizer and acceptor are prone to diffusion and collision. Finally, not only the TTT but also the TTA processes are promoted, which make the ΦUC value reach that of its counterpart in a pure organic solvent.
As shown in Fig. 9, the enhanced upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) in the o/w microemulsion was almost the same as that observed in DMF (see inset in Fig. 9, which shows the photographs of the green-to-blue upconversion obtained from DNAMe/PdMeTPP in the o/w microemulsion and DMF). Very importantly, this upconverted o/w microemulsion can maintain a high efficiency (ΦUC = 33.12%) without degassing for several days. In contrast, the efficiency (ΦUC) of its counterpart in DMF decreases to zero within 1.2 hour without degassing (Fig. 10). Moreover, a comparison experiment of DNAMe/PdMeTPP using o/w microemulsion, both with deaeration and without deaeration, further confirmed that the upconverted o/w microemulsion did not need deaeration (Fig. S5†). These observations indicate that the upconverted o/w microemulsion is not sensitive to oxygen, which is of great significance. Moreover, the temperature-dependent upconversion shows that the system with high upconverted efficiency (ΦUC) is more sensitive to the temperature, which can be probably used as a temperature sensor (Fig. S6†).

The inset shows the photographs of the blue upconversion from the systems above (the excitation source was a diode laser at 532 nm and 60 mW cm−2).

The inset is a detailed diagram with the x coordinate range from 0–1.2 h. 
3.4 Upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry
The upconverted o/w microemulsion can be employed as the desired light used in photoelectrochemistry. As shown in Fig. 11a, the green-to-blue upconversion irradiates the WO3 film deposited on ITO, which acts as the working electrode. Since the WO3 photoanode (Eg = 2.7 eV, λab = 459 nm)44 is able to absorb the blue illumination produced by our upconverted o/w microemulsion, the oxidation of water can take place on the WO3 photoanode and the hydrogen can be obtained at the platinum rod electrode. As a result, the shuttered current/time response of the WO3 photoanode biased to +0.33 V versus Ag/AgCl was recorded using a computer-controlled electrochemistry station.

The measurement data (Fig. 11b) show that a larger photocurrent density (Ii = 0.046 μA cm−2) was obtained under the irradiation by the larger upconverted o/w microemulsion (DTAMe/PdMeTPP, ΦUC = 33.12%), while a smaller photocurrent density (Ii = 0.035 μA cm−2) was recorded from the small upconverted o/w microemulsion (DTACl/PdMeTPP, ΦUC = 23.43%), strongly confirming that the upconversion-driven photoelectrochemistry was indeed responsible for the generated photocurrent density. In order to eliminate the photocurrent resulting from the excitation of the diode pumped solid state laser, the contrastive experiments were conducted under identical conditions except for using a quartz cuvette containing only blank solvent. Considering that the upconverted o/w microemulsion is not toxic, it is easy to fabricate and requires no deaeration; thus, the o/w microemulsion can be a suitable medium for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion.
Conclusions
The first report of an effective medium for triplet-triplet annihilated upconversion and the correlation between structure/upconversion performance of three 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes doped with sensitizer (PdMeTPP) have been discussed. It was found that 9,10-dinaphthylanthracene (DNAMe) bearing a donating group exhibits a high fluorescence quantum yield (Φf = 78%) and larger TTT efficiency (KQ, 7.65 × 108 M−1 s−1), in comparison with DNACl (Φf = 69%, KQ = 3.89 × 108 M−1 s−1) and DNACN (Φf = 63%, KQ = 0.74 × 108 M−1 s−1), resulting in efficiency (ΦUC) in the order of DNAMe (34.68%) > DNACl (24.57%) > DNACN (21.03%) in DMF.
The fact that an efficiency (ΦUC) increase was accompanied by a temperature increase for the upconverted o/w microemulsion was attributed to the fact that oil-in-water (o/w) containing the nonionic emulsifier (Tween-20) can be reversibly converted to an water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion with changes in temperature, which promotes the TTT and TTA processes with a result that the upconverted efficiency is enhanced. These observations demonstrate that a thermal-driven upconversion mechanism is functioned. The maximum upconverted efficiency in the o/w microemulsion was obtained as high as 33.12%, which is comparable to their counterpart in DMF (34.68%).
More importantly, there is no need for the upconverted o/w microemulsion to be deaerated, which is of critical importance for their application in photoelectrochemistry. The importance of this study suggests that the upconverted o/w microemulsion provides a simple approach to obtain high TTA-UC efficiency without the need of degassing.
