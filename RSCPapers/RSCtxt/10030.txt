        CdSe
        quantum dot (QD ) sensitized TiO2 films have been fabricated using a one-step microwave assisted chemical bath deposition (MACBD) technique and used as photoanodes for quantum dot sensitized solar cells. This technique allows direct and rapid deposition and a good contact between the CdSe and TiO2 films. The photovoltaic performances of the cells with CdSe deposited at different times are investigated. The results show that cells based on MACBD deposited TiO2/CdSe electrodes achieve a maximum short circuit current density of 12.1 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 1.75% at one Sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), which is comparable with those fabricated using conventional techniques.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention and represent a key class of cell architecture that has emerged as a promising candidate for the development of next generation solar cells.1,2 Energy conversion efficiencies over 11% have so far been achieved for a DSSC using a Ru(II) complex monolayer coated mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystalline film photoanode.3–5 In recent years, quantum dot (QD) semiconductors have also been employed as sensitizers due to their high extinction coefficients, spectral tunability by particle size and good stability.6–15Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are based on the photosensitization of semiconductor photoanodes, typically TiO2, by absorbed QD sensitizers, typically CdS or CdSe. As compared with CdS, CdSe with a smaller band gap (1.7 eV) can absorb a wider range of wavelengths of light, which is advantageous for sensitizers.2,16,17
The working mechanism and energy-band structure of QDSSCs are depicted in Fig. 1, involving the key processes (1)–(7). In brief, electrons, excited from the valance band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the QDs by absorbing light (path (1)), are rapidly injected into the CB of the TiO2 particles (path (2)) and then transported to the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (path (3)). The oxidized QDs are regenerated by accepting the electrons from a counter electrode (CE) (path (5)) via a redox pair (path (4)). However, the charge recombination (paths (6) and (7)) will happen in the meantime and deteriorate the cell performance. Therefore, the improvement of the performance of the QDs and their interconnectivity with the TiO2 substrate will facilitate the electron transfer from the QDs to the TiO2 and decrease the back transport of electrons from the TiO2 to the electrolyte, which is very important for the cell efficiency. Many studies have also been devoted to exploring different fabrication techniques to attach QDs to TiO2. In general, QDs are attached to semiconductor films using two approaches: (1) self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of the prepared QDs onto the TiO2 surface through the linking of bifunctional molecules;18 (2) In situ synthesis of the QDs in the mesoporous TiO2 substrate using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) under normal or hydrothermal conditions.11,18–20 Recently, a combination of the above two techniques has been widely developed for the fabrication of QDSSCs.18,21 Meanwhile, some new techniques such as electrophoretic deposition (ED)22 and spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD)17 have also been applied in QDSSCs.

As an inexpensive, quick, clean and versatile technique, microwave irradiation induces interaction of the dipole moment of polar molecules or molecular ionic aggregates with the alternating electronic and magnetic fields, causing molecular-level heating which leads to homogeneous and quick thermal reactions.23,24 However, the microwave technique is seldom used to coat CdSe QDs onto TiO2 electrodes for QDSSCs, although such a method has been used successfully to fabricate CdSe QDs and multipod nanocrystals.25–29
In this work, we introduce a simple, rapid and effective approach to deposit CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 films for QDSSCs using a microwave assisted chemical bath deposition (MACBD) method. Compared with those conventional methods, the microwave technique can rapidly synthesize CdSe QDs and precisely control their sizes with a narrow distribution, improve the wettability of TiO2 surface and form a good contact between the CdSe QDs and the TiO2 layer due to the rapidly elevated temperature during microwave irradiation. The as-synthesized CdSe QDSSCs show a maximum short-circuit current density of 12.1 mA cm−2, and a conversion efficiency of 1.75% under one Sun illumination.
2. Experimental
The TiO2 electrode was prepared by screen printing TiO2 paste30 onto FTO glass (resistivity: 14 Ω/□, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan). The electrode configuration was a transparent layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 (P25, Degussa) with a mean size of 25 nm and a scattering layer of microcrystalline TiO2 with a mean size of 200 nm (Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd.). The as-prepared electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
Subsequently, CdSe sensitizer was deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes by the MACBD technique. In brief, Se powder (32 mg) was added to a mixture of 10 ml 0.04 M Cd(NO3)2 and 10 ml 0.04 M Na2SO3 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd.) as a precursor aqueous solution. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a vessel of the precursor aqueous solution, and then the vessel was put into an automated focused microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM Co.) and treated at 150 °C with a microwave irradiation power of 100 W for different time periods. In this work, CdSe QD incorporated TiO2 (TiO2/CdSe) photoelectrodes with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20 and 30 min are named as electrodes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The morphology and structure of TiO2 and TiO2/CdSe electrodes were characterized by using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and a JEOL-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), respectively. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the electrodes were detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900).
The CdSe QDSSCs were sealed in a sandwich structure with a 25 μm spacer (Surlyn) by using thin Au-sputtered FTO glass as a counter electrode. Water/methanol (3:7 by volume) solution was used as a co-solvent of the polysulfide electrolyte.31 The electrolyte solution consisted of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl. The active area of the cell was 0.2 cm2 without a mask. It should be noted that methanol oxidation can happen at the electrode and act as a sacrificial donor to the system by scavenging photogenerated holes. However, because of the existence of S2−/Sn2−redox couples which scavenge and transfer most of holes, the contribution to the conversion efficiency from methanol oxidation will be insignificant. The J–V measurement was performed with a Keithley model 2440 Source Meter and a Newport solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel) at one Sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements12,32,33 were carried out in dark conditions at forward bias: 0–0.5 V, applying a 10 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N and FRA2 module).
3. Results and discussion
The cross-section FESEM image in Fig. 2 (a) clearly displays the two layer TiO2 electrode consisting of a 7 μm thick compact P25 transparent layer and a 3 μm thick loose microcrystalline TiO2 scattering layer. Such a double-layer structure favors contact between the substrate and electrode and enhances the light scattering ability, which can improve the performance of the cells.34Fig. 2 (b) and (c) show the FESEM images (top view) of the nanocrystalline TiO2 underlayer and microcrystalline TiO2 overlayer films, respectively. The TiO2 electrode is constructed from a random agglomeration of TiO2 particles. The porous structure of TiO2 favors an easy penetration of electrolyte, as well as Cd and Se precursors, during deposition. Fig. 2 (d) shows the FESEM image (top view) of electrode 3. Compared with the bare TiO2 film (Fig. 2 (c)), a great amount of CdSe nanoparticles were seen to deposit on the surface of the TiO2 film. The composition of the electrode was identified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (d). Quantitative analysis of the EDS spectrum gives a Cd:Se atomic ratio of about 1, indicating that high-grade CdSe particles are formed. Electrodes 1, 2 and 4 have similar FESEM images and EDS results as electrode 3. The result indicates that CdSe QDs are successfully assembled on the surface of TiO2 film via MACBD.

Fig. 3 (a) shows a low-magnification HRTEM image of electrode 3. It is clearly found that the aggregation is composed of small nanocrystalline TiO2 and bigger microcrystalline TiO2 particles. The surfaces of these TiO2 particles are decorated with CdSe QDs (black dots). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the upper right inset in Fig. 3 (a) indicates that the TiO2/CdSe film has a polycrystalline structure. Fig. 3 (b) shows a high-magnification HRTEM image of electrode 3. The lattice spacing measured for the crystalline plane is 0.352 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21–1272). Around the TiO2 crystallite edge, fine crystallites are observed. The crystallites connecting to the TiO2 have lattice fringes of 0.372 nm which are ascribed to (100) plane of CdSe (JCPDS 77-2307). The HRTEM image also indicates that CdSe with a size of about 5–10 nm is presented in a crystalline structure.

Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure TiO2 film and TiO2/CdSe electrodes 1–4. Compared with the absorption spectra of the pure TiO2 film, there is an obvious absorption peak near 700 nm for the TiO2/CdSe films, which can be ascribed to the contribution from the CdSe QDs. The band gap of CdSe QDs corresponding to the absorption edge is about 1.77 eV, which is slightly higher than that of bulk CdSe.35 Therefore, the quantum size effect does not play a significant role here. The absorbance gradually increases with increasing deposition time, indicating that more CdSe QDs have been deposited onto the TiO2 film. This is also confirmed by the color change, observed through the naked eye, from light brown to dark brown for electrode 1 to electrode 4 in the inset of Fig. 4.

The J–V curves of CdSe QDSSCs with electrodes 1– 4 are shown in Fig. 5 (a). The open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all cells are listed in Table 1. The Jsc and Voc of the cell with electrode 1 are 4.77 mA cm−2 and 0.44 V, respectively, resulting in a very low value of energy conversion efficiency (0.70%). When the deposition time is prolonged, Jsc, Voc and η increase obviously and reach maximum values of 12.1 mA cm−2, 0.45 V and 1.75% respectively, at a deposition time of 20 min, and then decrease with a further increase of the deposition time. At the beginning of the deposition, the MACBD process is supposed to increase the coverage ratio of CdSe on the TiO2 surface by replenishing the uncovered area, and the thickness of CdSe layer increases with an increase of deposition time. Such an increment of CdSe loading leads to more excited electrons under the illumination of light, which is advantageous for the photocurrent. An optimum thickness of the CdSe layer is obtained at a deposition time of 20 min, which results in the highest Jsc and η by providing a good interfacial structure between TiO2 and CdSe films and reducing the recombination of the injected electrons from TiO2 to the electrolyte due good coverage of CdSe on the TiO2 surface. However, as the thickness of the CdSe layer increases further, it will be more difficult to transport an electron from the CdSe outer layer into the TiO2 film. In the meantime, the CdSe/electrolyte contacting area will decrease with an increase in the amount of CdSe because more pores are probably blocked by the additional loading of CdSe, leading to unfavorable electron transport at the TiO2/CdSe/electrolyte interface.36,37 This inference was confirmed by the J–V curves of the cells with electrodes 1–4 in dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). The applied voltage required to drive the electrons across the photoelectrodes is highest for the cell with electrode 3, which is due to good coverage of CdSe on the TiO2 surface. This result indicates that the cell with electrode 3 has a superior interfacial structure to inhibit the interfacial recombination of the injected electrons from TiO2 to the electrolyte,38,39 which is also responsible for its higher energy conversion efficiency.

The charge transfer and recombination behavior in the CdSe QDSSCs were further studied by analyzing the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at various applied voltages in dark conditions. Fig. 6 (a) shows the typical Nyquist plots of the cells with electrodes 1–4 obtained at an applied voltage of 0.3 V. The EIS spectra are characterized by the presence of two semicircles in a Nyquist plot.33,34 The high frequency semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interfaces of the electrolyte/counter electrode, and the low-frequency one is due to the contribution from the chemical capacitance of nanostructured TiO2 (Cμ) and the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) between TiO2 and the polysulfide electrolyte.12,33 The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 6 (a).40,41Fig. 6 (b) and (c) show the Rrec and Cμ of the cells with electrodes 1–4 at various applied potentials (0–0.5 V) obtained from EIS fitting. It can be observed that Rrec decreases with an increase of the applied potential, and the cell with electrode 3 shows the highest recombination resistance (i.e., lowest recombination) compared to other cells, which explains the highest Jsc measured for the cell with electrode 3. The result of Rrec is consistent with the dark current measurement in Fig. 5 (b). Fig. 6 (c) indicates that a downward displacement of the TiO2 CB increases with the increase of deposition time. The increasing amount of CdSe with the increasing deposition time prevents direct contact of the polysulfide electrolyte with TiO2, which reduces the TiO2 CB position.34

Table 2 compares the photovoltaic performances of the QDSSCs with the TiO2 electrode, polysulfide electrolyte and CdSe sensitizer fabricated by MACBD and other methods under one Sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). It can be observed that a higher Jsc value of 12.1 mA cm−2 is achieved via the MACBD method as compared with SAM, CBD, combination of SAM and CBD, ED and SPD methods. The higher Jsc and η for the cell using the MACBD method can be ascribed to the following: (i) Microwave irradiation can heat up the aqueous solution quickly and homogeneously due to the penetration characteristic of microwaves and high utilization factor of microwave energy.42,43 Therefore, the nucleation and growth of the CdSe QDs can be over in an extremely short period of time, which is extraordinarily beneficial for reducing the concentration of surface defects of the QDs.44,45 The carrier recombination at the surface defects of the QDs is correspondingly suppressed and thus cell performance is increased.46,47 (ii) It is known that microwave irradiation has been used to prepare hydrophilic nanoparticles48 or to improve the surface wettability of polymers by increasing surface free energy.49 Therefore, easy attachment of CdSe onto TiO2 films and a good contact between them due to the improvement of surface hydrophilicity of TiO2 film may contribute to the increase of Jsc and η.50 In order to confirm the influence of microwave treatment on the surface wettability of TiO2 film, the contact angle (CA) of the TiO2 film was measured with a water droplet of 5 μl at ambient temperature (25 °C) using an optical contact angle meter (Powereach, JC2000D3, Shanghai Zhongchen Co. Ltd.), and the result is shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that the CA obviously changes from 26° to 15° after microwave treatment, indicating the improvement of surface hydrophilicity of TiO2 film. Such an improvement may be due an increase of surface roughness51 and/or the enhancement of free energy due to heat treatment under microwave irradiation.49

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple, rapid and effective MACBD method to deposit CdSe on TiO2 films as photoanodes for QDSSCs. This technique can be used to synthesize CdSe QDs rapidly and suppress their surface defects as well as form a good contact between the CdSe and TiO2 film. A maximum of 12.1 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density and 1.75% conversion efficiency under one Sun illumination has been achieved by using the MACBD method, which is comparable to those using other techniques such as SAM, CBD, a combination of SAM and CBD, ED and SPD. The present synthetic strategy should be a promising fabrication technique for QDSSCs.
