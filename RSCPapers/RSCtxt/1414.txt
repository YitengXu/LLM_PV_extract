    , Accepted 15th July 2011First published on 22nd August 2011AbstractA solid-state composite electrolyte, comprising two ionic liquids and a carbon material, was sandwiched between a dye-sensitized porous TiO2 working electrode and its counter electrode to fabricate a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC); the ionic liquids were 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII, ionic liquid crystal) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4, room temperature ionic liquid), and the carbon materials were carbon black (CB), multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). A cell efficiency (η) of 0.41% was achieved by using the bare 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) as the charge transfer intermediate (CTI); an efficiency of 2.52% was achieved for a solid-state DSSC by the incorporation of carbon black (CB) in the same composite electrolyte. To further improve the cell efficiency, we utilized 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4), a crystal growth inhibitor, as an additive to the electrolyte. The binary CTI (EMII plus EMIBF4) was in the form of a solid, until the weight percentage of EMIBF4 in the binary CTI exceeded the level of 60%. A cell efficiency of 3.09% was obtained using an electrolyte containing the CB and the binary CTI; the binary CTI for this cell contained EMII and EMIBF4 in the ratio of 8/2. When the CB was replaced with MWCNT and SWCNT, the cell efficiency could be improved to 3.53% and 4.01%, respectively. Long-term durability of the DSSC with SWCNT–binary CTI was found to be far superior to that of the cell with an organic solvent electrolyte, and in fact the durability was uninterrupted for at least 1000 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and laser-induced photo-voltage transients were used to substantiate the results.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated using low cost materials, a simple fabrication process, and they exhibit high energy conversion efficiency; these advantages make them attractive candidates for research on next generation solar energy conversion.1,2 However, commercialization of the cells with organic liquid electrolytes was impeded owing to technological problems related to hermetic sealing, precipitation of salts at low temperature and evaporation of liquids at high temperature; long-term stability is thus a major problem with these type of cells. Therefore, p-type inorganic semiconductors,3–5 organic hole conducting materials,6–9 ionic gel electrolytes having a polymer or a gelator,10–13 and ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes containing dispersed nano-components14–19 were recently investigated for preparing the electrolytes. Among these materials, ionic liquids (ILs) are proved to be most attractive for replacing the organic solvents; they are preferred because of their negligible vapor pressure, high thermal stability, wide electrochemical window, and high ionic conductivity.20–24
Zhao et al. fabricated a solid-state DSSC by utilizing an imidazolium-type ionic crystal as the charge transfer layer, and obtained a good cell efficiency of 3.1% under one sun irradiation.25 Ikeda and Miyasaka also constructed a solid-state DSSC with poly(N-vinyl-carbazole) as the hole transporter; the hole transport was however mediated by an alkali iodide coated on the dye-sensitized TiO2. They attained a cell efficiency of 2.0% under one sun irradiation but without the incorporation of volatile components (TBP, iodine) in their device.26 In their further study, a clay-like conducting material was used as the electrolyte for a solid-state DSSC; the electrolyte contained polyaniline-loaded carbon black (PACB) particles and an ethylene oxide-substituted imidazolium iodide; the cell showed an efficiency of 3.48% under one sun irradiation.27 They also used a clay-like conducting material, containing single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), as the electrolyte to construct a plastic, solid-state photocell, which exhibited an efficiency of 1.63% under one sun irradiation.28 Midya et al. synthesized a new class of solid-state ionic conductors based on a structure of carbazole–imidazolium cation, and investigated them for the application in solid-state DSSCs.29 This solid-state electrolyte, containing the designed solid-state ionic conductor and iodine, provided dual channels for hole/triiodide transportation, and rendered a conversion efficiency of 2.85% for its DSSC under one sun irradiation.
This paper reports on the fabrication and photovoltaic performance of an efficient all-solid-state DSSC. The electrolyte of the cell contained SWCNT, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4), where EMII and EMIBF4 constituted a binary charge transfer intermediate (CTI); noteworthy is that the electrolyte contained no iodine and TBP. This study also provides a different approach for preparing the solid-state CTI, in which the organic ionic salts have relatively low melting points (<100 °C), compared to those of many inorganic ionic salts mentioned in the literature,26 which normally have melting points higher than ca. 300 °C. Moreover, the melting point of the CTI was controlled by adjusting the composition of the binary CTI; this approach precludes molecular designs for the organic ionic salts.25 The advantage of this device with SWCNT–binary CTI lies in the fact that all the materials in the electrolyte are thermally stable and that the device shows uninterrupted durability.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials

Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetic grade), iodine (I2, synthetic grade), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (PMII) were obtained from Merck, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) was obtained from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.); 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were purchased from Acros; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4), Ti(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, >98%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), ethanol (99.5%), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%) were obtained from Aldrich. Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT, >90%, specific surface area >300 m2 g−1, diameter: 2 nm, length: 5–15 μm) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT, >90%, specific surface area >170 m2 g−1, diameter: 10 nm, length: 5–15 μm) were supplied by Scientech Corporation (Taipei, Taiwan). Carbon black (CB, 99.9%, ca. 42 nm) was obtained from Alfa Aesar.
2.2 Preparation and characterization of the electrolytes
The electrolyte with a carbon material and the binary CTI was prepared by mixing a solid powder of CB, SWCNT and MWCNT with the binary CTI (EMII and EMIBF4), in the weight ratio of 1:9 for the carbon material and the CTI; the CTI was prepared by mixing various proportions of EMII and EMIBF4. At the same time, ACN was added to the composite to improve the mixing; the ACN was removed by heating the contents at a temperature of 90 °C. Thermal stability of each component in the composite electrolyte was characterized by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TGA-7, Perkin-Elmer). A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Q20, TA instruments) was used to observe the variations in the binary CTI with various compositions. Morphologies of the films were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, NanoSEM 230, Nova™). A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in γ-butyrolactone (GBL, Fluka) was used as the organic solvent electrolyte.
2.3 
          Assembly of the DSSCs
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq.−1, visible transmittance ≥80%, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP (0.084 g) in ethanol (10 ml) to obtain a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and the TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. A 10 μm thick film of TiO2 (Ti-Nanoxide T20/SP, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was coated by the doctor blade method onto the treated conducting glass; a portion of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 was selected as the active area by removing the side portions by scrapping. The TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) in ACN and tBA (volume ratio of 1:1) at the room temperature for 24 h. After the dye-adsorption, a 25 μm thick frame of Surlyn® tape (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was attached on the edges of the TiO2 electrode by heating the tape. The electrolyte, containing a carbon material and the binary CTI, was then put onto the dye-sensitized TiO2 film at 90 °C; the heating was to ensure that the ILs penetrate deep into the porous structure and to remove any residual ACN. The TiO2 electrode with the carbon material–binary CTI was joined with a platinum-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq.−1, visible transmittance ≥85%, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) by means of clamps, and the edges were sealed by an UV glue (Optocast 3410 40K GEN2, Alexander Jewels Co., Ltd.).
2.4 Instrumentation and measurements
The surface of the DSSC was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan). The incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSC were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). The thickness of the TiO2 film was determined using a surface profilometer (Sloan Dektak 3030). EIS was obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC, between the counter electrode and the FTO–TiO2–dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit conditions; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model.30,31
The photovoltage transients of the assembled devices were recorded with a digital oscilloscope (model LT322, LeCroy, USA). Pulsed laser excitation was applied by a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (model Quanta-Ray GCR-3-10, Spectra-Physics laser) with a 2 Hz repetition rate at 532 nm, and a 7 ns pulse width at half-height. The average electron lifetime could approximately be estimated by fitting a decay of the open-circuit voltage transient with exp(−t τe−1), where t is the time and τe is an average time constant before recombination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the components of the electrolytes

Fig. 1 shows the photographs of the EMII. The appearance indicates that the EMII is solid at room temperature, and it becomes a fluid at the temperature of 90 °C. We expected that this type of IL would allow perfect contact between the surfaces of the dye-coated porous TiO2 and the carbon materials at 90 °C, and would therefore function as a CTI. Therefore, we filled the porous structure of the TiO2 with this IL at its temperature of 90 °C and allowed the TiO2 to cool down; the IL became again solid at the room temperature (25 °C), as shown in Fig. 1C. In this way we could fabricate a solid-state DSSC with good contact between the FTO–TiO2–dye electrode and the electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the carbon materials, CB, MWCNT, and SWCNT. All of them have nano-sized particles or tubes; for this reason they were expected to possess high surface area and act as extended electron transfer materials (EETM), as illustrated in Fig. S1†.18,32 Fig. S2† shows thermogravimetric (TGA) traces of the components of the electrolytes used in this study, i.e., EMII, EMIBF4, CB, MWCNT, and SWCNT. All the traces indicate that there is no weight loss of any component for temperatures at least up to 300 °C. This type of high thermal stability is beneficial for the fabrication of a durable DSSC.

3.2 Photovoltaic parameters and EIS data of the DSSCs with CB in their electrolytes

Fig. 3 shows photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with CTIs composed of bare EMII, CB–EMII, and CB–EMII–EMIBF4, in which CB–EMII–EMIBF4 has three different proportions for EMII and EMIBF4 (wt%), as indicated in the figure; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. A higher efficiency of 2.52% was obtained for the solid-state DSSC with CB–EMII, as compared to that of the cell with the bare EMII (0.41%). This enhancement in the performance of the cell with CB–EMII is explained by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 4 shows EIS data (Nyquist plots) of the DSSCs with bare EMII and CB–EMII; the corresponding equivalent circuit is shown as the inset of the figure. Table 1 gives the values of Rct2 and Rdiff of the EIS. In general, the EIS spectra of an FTO/TiO2/dye/electrolyte/Pt/ITO device show three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The ohmic serial resistance (Rs) corresponds to the overall series resistance. The first and second semicircles correspond to the charge-transfer resistances at the counter electrode (Rct1) and at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2), respectively. The third one represents the Warburg diffusion process (Rdiff) of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. In our case the tiny circle in Fig. 4 is composed of both Rct1 and Rct2; this is made clear by showing this portion separately as an inset on the right bottom of the figure. A comparison of this tiny semicircle of CB–EMII with the corresponding semicircle of bare EMII indicates that the charge transports at the interfaces of the counter electrode/electrolyte (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2) in the case of the cell with CB–EMII are very facile. It is to be noted that this beneficial effect of the carbon material is greatly reflected in terms of the Warburg diffusion (Rdiff) of the cell with CB–EMII, which is much smaller than that of the cell with bare EMII. The formation of EETM by the carbon material, CB, in the case of the cell with CB–EMII apparently facilitates the cell charge transfers at the interfaces of the counter electrode/electrolyte (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2), in addition to facilitating the diffusion of charge carriers in the electrolyte.

In our work the conventional diffusion resistance of the redox couple is apparently greatly retarded due to a short length for the diffusion of I− and I3− ions, caused by the carbon material as the extended electron transfer material (EETM) (Fig. S1†), and this is perceived as the reason for the smaller third semicircle for the cell with CB–EMII, compared to the near-infinite line in the case of the cell with bare EMII. The EETM at the counter electrode surface is supposed to extend up to the dye-coated TiO2 film. This EETM enables electron transfer from the counter electrode to the CTI and decreases the charge diffusion length in the electrolyte.
3.3 Physical and thermal properties of the CTI with the addition of EMIBF4 and CB
To further improve the cell efficiency, we utilized 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) as a crystal growth inhibitor. By adding the EMIBF4 to EMII up to 80 wt%, the binary CTI (EMII mixed with EMIBF4) showed no change in color (Fig. S3†). This means that the components of the binary intermediate do not exclude each other even under recrystallized conditions. However, the binary CTI exhibits a solid-like form with the addition of up to 60 wt% of EMIBF4 to the EMII. Fig. 5a shows the bare EMII; it has a rough surface with irregular blocks of crystalline EMII. With the addition of 20 wt% of EMIBF4 into the EMII, the binary CTI shows a smooth surface morphology (Fig. 5b). It is known that ionic crystallization usually prevents the penetration of a solid-state electrolyte into the porous structure of a TiO2 film, and causes a decrease in the photovoltaic performance of the pertinent DSSC.3–5 Inhibition of the crystal growth is, therefore, expected to improve the performance of a solid-state DSSC. In this regard, to investigate the thermal properties of the binary CTI, differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) scans were obtained (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, the melting point (Tm) of a CTI decreases with the increase in the content of EMIBF4, and reaches close to the room temperature at a weight percent of 60% of EMIBF4 (the compositions of EMII and EMIBF4 are the same as those in Fig. S3†). These results are consistent with the observation in Fig. S3†, which exhibits solid state up to the weight percent of 60% of EMIBF4. Thus, the excessive addition of EMIBF4 to EMII (80 wt% of EMIBF4) led to a liquid state for this binary CTI (see Fig. S3†). Besides, we observed that EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2) was in a solid form (Fig. S4†) with the addition of CB, when heated to the temperature of 75 °C, which is higher than the melting point of this binary CTI (∼40 °C, Fig. 6). This implies that the CB plays a role in the physical gelation of the CTI.

3.4 Photovoltaic parameters and EIS data of the DSSCs with EMIBF4 in their electrolytes
It can be seen in Table 1 that the overall power conversion efficiency of the DSSC with 20 wt% of EMIBF4 is 3.09%; this efficiency is higher than that of the cell with CB–EMII, i.e., without EMIBF4 (2.52%). Fig. 7 shows the EIS data of the DSSCs with CB/EMII and CB/EMII/EMIBF4, the latter with various amounts of EMIBF4 (wt%). Table 1 also gives the corresponding fitting values for Rct2 and Rdiff. Smaller Rct2 and Rdiff are observed for the solid-state DSSCs with EMII/EMIBF4, as compared to those of the cell with only CB–EMII; this observation is in consistency with our explanation that the presence of EMIBF4 leads to the reduction of crystallization in the binary CTI. The CTI with reduced crystallization can penetrate deep into the TiO2 and can enhance the cell performance. The enhancement in the efficiency of the solid-state DSSC with 20 wt% EMIBF4 (3.09%), with reference to the efficiency of the cell without this IL (2.52%), is attributed to the reduced crystallization of the binary CTI, which provides better filling of the solid electrolyte into the TiO2 and also lowers the charge transfer resistance for the composite electrolyte containing I− and I3− ions. However, as the content of the EMIBF4 exceeds 20 wt%, the JSC, FF and VOC show a decrease in their values. The decreased JSC can be explained considering that the proportional concentration of I− in the pertinent electrolyte decreases with reduced proportion of EMII in the electrolyte and this decrease leads to inadequate dye-regeneration.32
 Fig. 7  
EIS data of the DSSCs with CB/EMII and CB/EMII/EMIBF4, the latter with various amounts of EMIBF4 (wt%), measured at 100 mW cm−2. 
When the amount of EMIBF4 was increased from 20 to 40 and 60 wt%, the cell efficiency had decreased to 2.33% and 1.87%, respectively, but they also possess lower Rct2 than the cell without this IL (EMIBF4). Kuang et al. reported on a DSSC with an electrolyte containing binary-ionic-liquids (bi-ILs).33 In their study, the relationship between Rct2 and efficiency is the same as in our case, i.e., the efficiency rather increased with increased Rct2. However, they have not discussed this discrepancy. We cited the above example to indicate the possibility that efficiency can increase in some cases despite a high Rct2 value. The reason for such discrepancy is not clear for us at this moment. The higher efficiency of the CB–EMII cell than that of the CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (6/4) cell, despite the higher Rct2 of the former may be explained as follows. It is known that an ionic liquid with high viscosity usually prevents its quasi-solid-state electrolyte to penetrate into the porous structure of a dye-sensitized TiO2 film.33 Here, the presence of EMIBF4 reduces the crystallization in a binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4). The CTI with reduced crystallization can penetrate deep into the dye-sensitized TiO2 and can well cover the surface of the dye-sensitized TiO2. Therefore, the interfacial resistance at the CTI and the dye-sensitized TiO2 (Rct2) reduces greatly. On the other hand, the dye+ regeneration kinetics of redox-inactive ILs (EMIBF4) are slower than those of redox-active ILs (iodide-based ILs) by at least 1000 times.24,33 In our case, the proportional concentration of I− in the electrolyte with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (6/4) decreases with reduced proportion of redox-active EMII (due to the addition of EMIBF4) and this decrease leads to inadequate dye-regeneration, thereby to the recombination of injected conduction band electrons with dye+. This is why the cell with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (6/4) gives a lower JSC and VOC, and consequently a lower efficiency than those of the cell with CB–EMII, despite the fact that the former cell has a lower interfacial resistance at the dye-sensitized TiO2 and the electrolyte (Rct2).
3.5 Photovoltage transients of the DSSCs with EMIBF4 in their electrolytes
In order to have a clear elucidation of the charge transport and recombination processes within the solid-state DSSCs, photovoltage transients of the devices with bare EMII, CB–EMII, and CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2) were measured. When the dye was excited by a laser, the response in terms of photovoltage was instantaneous for all the three DSSCs (Fig. 8). The values of electron lifetime (τe) were found to be 0.59, 0.77, and 1.74 ms for the DSSCs with bare EMII, CB–EMII, and CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2), respectively (Fig. 8). An increase in the τe for the cell with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2), with respect to that of the cell with bare EMII, means that the incorporation of CB and the crystal inhibitor (EMIBF4) in the electrolyte has not only lowered the interfacial charge recombination in the cell but also improved the charge transport in the electrolyte.

3.6 Photovoltaic parameters and EIS data of the DSSCs with different carbon materials in their electrolytes

Fig. 9 shows the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with carbon materials (CB, MWCNT, and SWCNT) and binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4), in which the ratio of EMII/EMIBF4 was fixed to be 8:2. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 9 and Table 2, the cell with SWCNT–binary CTI exhibits the highest efficiency (4.01%), with reference to those of the cells with CB–binary CTI (3.09%) and MWCNT–binary CTI (3.53%). The better performance of the cells with MWCNT and SWCNT is owing to substantial increase in JSC and FF for these cells, with respect to those of the cell with CB. The main reason for these large improvements in JSC and FF can be attributed to the dimensional structures of carbon nanotubes (CNT); these tube-like regular structures of the CNT are known to facilitate the charge transfer from the counter electrode to the CTI. Moreover, SWCNT tend to exhibit p-type nature in conduction and current rectification by adsorbing oxygen from the air;34,35 this means that SWCNT function as hole conductors at the junction of the electrolyte and the dye-sensitized n-type TiO2. The purity of commercially available MWCNT is generally low; in the present case the purity grade is >90%. Commercial MWCNT usually contain amorphous carbon and metallic impurities (used as catalysts for synthesis). These impurities could influence the electrochemical reactions in a DSSC and thereby could lower the photocurrent density of the cell; they could also influence the above mentioned current rectification ability. These are probably the reasons that the DSSC with the SWCNT showed the best performance among the three cells, with an η value of 4.01%.

Fig. 10 shows the EIS data of the DSSCs with carbon materials (CB, MWCNT, and SWCNT) and binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4), in which the ratio of EMII/EMIBF4 was fixed to be 8:2. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. It can be seen in Table 2 that the cell with MWCNT–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2) shows a higher efficiency (3.53%) than that (3.09%) of the cell with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2). The electrolyte in our study is in a solid-state. It is well known that in a solid phase, MWCNT promote the electron transfer.36–39 In this type of solid-electrolyte the charge transfer may occur both through ionic movements and by simple conduction as in a solid medium. This can be a reason for the reduced Rdiff in the case of the cell with MWCNT–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2), with reference to that in the case of the cell with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2). A facile charge transfer in a dye-sensitized solar cell usually renders a higher JSC to the cell. Greatly increased FF and greatly decreased Rdiff with slightly increased JSC have apparently given a higher efficiency to the cell with MWCNT–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2) than that of the cell with CB–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2).

EIS data of the DSSCs with carbon materials (CB, MWCNT, and SWCNT)–binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4), measured at 100 mW cm−2, in which the ratio of EMII/EMIBF4 was fixed to be 8:2. 
As can be seen in Fig. 10 and Table 2, the cell with SWCNT–binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4 = 8/2) shows the smallest Rct2 and Rdiff, compared to these parameters of the other two cells. Apparently improvement in the current rectification and charge transfer has caused decreases in Rct2 and Rdiff and the corresponding increases in the JSC and FF for the DSSC with SWCNT (Table 2). This is in consistency with the highest cell efficiency obtained for the SWCNT based DSSC.
3.7 Long-term durability of the solid-state DSSC
Wang et al.40 also used TGA to show the thermal stability of their electrolyte materials, and studied the long-term stability to confirm the overall stability of their DSSCs. Therefore, the overall stability of the DSSC with the composite electrolyte (SWCNT–binary CTI) is discussed, with the help of Fig. 11. Fig. 11 shows long-term durability data of the DSSCs with an electrolyte containing SWCNT–binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4 = 8/2) and with an organic liquid electrolyte. In this experiment, all cells were simultaneously sealed by Surlyn® and UV glue. The cell efficiency was measured every three days after storing it under the dark at room temperature. Efficiencies were normalized to the average value obtained in the preceding week, because we expected that the cell efficiency reaches a stable value at room temperature in about a week. As expected, the proposed solid-state DSSC showed an excellent durability, when compared with that of the cell with the organic liquid electrolyte. The solid-state DSSC shows an uninterrupted overall efficiency for 1000 h; the cell with the organic liquid electrolyte shows a decrease in efficiency by about 30% after 1000 h, despite the fact that the boiling point of the organic solvent, GBL is as high as 204 °C. These results prove that the all-solid-state DSSC with the SWCNT–binary CTI is free from the problems of leakage and evaporation, as otherwise observed in the case of the traditional DSSCs with organic liquid electrolytes.
 Fig. 11  Normalized efficiencies of the DSSCs with an electrolyte containing SWCNT–binary CTI (EMII/EMIBF4 = 8/2) and with an organic liquid electrolyte, obtained at different periods of time for 1000 h; the efficiencies were all measured at 100 mW cm−2. 
Conclusions
Efficient solid-state DSSCs were fabricated with electrolytes containing different carbon materials and a binary CTI with EMII and EMIBF4. It is established that the carbon material in the composite electrolyte serves simultaneously as the filler for the physical gelation of the electrolyte and as the catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of I3−. Besides, it is also established that the EMIBF4 in the binary CTI serves as an efficient crystal growth inhibitor. Photovoltage transients have further confirmed that the incorporation of the carbon black (CB) and the crystal inhibitor (EMIBF4) has not only lowered the interfacial charge recombination in the cell but also improved the charge transport in the electrolyte. When the CB was replaced with multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) the cell efficiency could be improved to 3.53% and 4.01%, respectively. The highest efficiency of 4.01% was thus achieved for the solid-state DSSC with SWCNT–EMII/EMIBF4 (8/2). Finally, the long-term durability of the DSSC with SWCNT–binary CTI is established to be far superior to that of a cell with an organic solvent-based electrolyte. The DSSC with SWCNT–binary CTI has showed an uninterrupted durability at room temperature for 1000 h.
