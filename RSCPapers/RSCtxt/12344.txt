    , Accepted 26th August 2015First published on 27th August 2015AbstractIn this study, we developed a new cathodic buffer layer consisting of a cross-linked [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (C-PCBSD) matrix and an ionic FPI dopant. The incorporation of FPI can improve the electron mobility via an anion induced charge transfer (AIET) mechanism, while maintaining the solvent-resistant properties of the crosslinked layer. ZnO combined with the C-PCBSD/FPI layer can effectively and universally improve the performance of bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJPSCs), planar heterojunction polymer solar cells (PHJPSCs), and organic metallohalide perovskite solar cells (OMPSCs). Furthermore, the insertion of the C-PCBSD/FPI layer can improve the thermal stability of the device by preventing the residual moisture in ZnO from diffusing into the CH3NH3PbI3 layer in OMPSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic metallohalide perovskite solar cells (OMPSCs) have swiftly emerged as the most promising solution to the energy issue due to the significant progress in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%.1–14 In 2009, Miyasaka and co-workers first utilized CH3NH3PbI3 as a visible-light sensitizer with mesoporous TiO2 as the cathodic buffer layer (CBL) to obtain a PCE of 3.9%.15 Later on, Park and co-workers optimized the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer with a post-annealing treatment on the perovskite thin film to achieve a PCE of 6.5%.16 On the other hand, Snaith and co-workers used 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole-collecting layer to achieve a high PCE of 10%.17 Very recently, Yang and co-workers further improved the performance up to 19% via interfacial layer modifications.18
Along with the performances, the practical uses of OMPSCs rely on the device stability as well as the fabrication cost.19–22 TiO2 has been widely used as the cathodic buffer layer to achieve high-performance CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells. However, the TiO2-coated OMPSCs usually require high-temperature sintering processes that hinder roll-to-roll production.23 Furthermore, TiO2 decreases the device stability due to UV-induced degradation.24 On the other hand, ZnO is another promising CBL candidate for OMPSCs as a result of its good electron mobility.25 However, high sensitivity of ZnO to humidity in nature is also detrimental to CH3NH3PbI3.26
To overcome the humidity issue, deposition of a functional fullerene layer on ZnO to enhance the air-stability might be a good strategy for OMPSCs.27 We recently reported a crosslinked [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (C-PCBSD) interlayer showing hole-blocking ability and facilitating electron transfer in inverted PSCs.28–30 It is envisaged that the C-PCBSD layer can generate a smoother and more hydrophobic surface on ZnO to block moisture and thus improve the device lifetime. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low mobility of the C-PCBSD interlayer may constrain charge collection and transport between the active layer and electrode.31–34 Recently, Jen and co-workers incorporated an ionic fullerene dopant, bis-fulleropyrrolidium iodide (Bis-FPI), into a cross-linked fullerene matrix to facilitate electron transport and provide a conductive pathway via an anion-induced charge transfer (AIET) mechanism leading to much enhanced performance.35–37 Nevertheless, utilization of this method has never been reported in the OMPSCs. In this research, we wish to report a fullerene derivative FPI as shown in Fig. 1, which was doped into a solvent-resistant C-PCBSD layer for the fabrication of the inverted devices of BHJPSCs and OMPSCs.38 The electron mobility of the 50 wt% FPI-doped C-PCBSD layer increases significantly by four times compared to the pure C-PCBSD layer. Because of extra exciton dissociation with reduced series resistance, the device with ITO/ZnO/FPI-doped C-PCBSD/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au exhibited an impressive PCE of 11.9% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69%.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Device fabrication procedures
For the device fabrication of BHJPSCs and planar heterojunction polymer solar cells (PHJPSCs), ITO glass substrates (purchased from Wintek; sheet resistance 30 Ω sq.−1) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath and then dried overnight in an oven at >100 °C. Zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg mL−1) and a small amount of ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-cast on pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 170 °C for 10 minutes in the air to form a ZnO layer with a thickness of 40 nm.39 PCBSD, PCBSD (FPI, 25%), and PCBSD (FPI, 50%) were dissolved in ODCB to a concentration of 0.5 wt%. For devices fabricated with C-PCBSD or C-PCBSD with the FPI dopant interlayer, the solution was spin-cast onto the ZnO layer to form a thin film with a thickness of ca. 10 nm. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 170 °C for 10 minutes in a glovebox for thermal cross-linking. For devices fabricated with a polymer, P3HT (Lumtec Corp.) was dissolved in ODCB (1.5 wt%), and PC61BM (Lumtec Corp.) was then added into the solution to reach the desired weight ratio. For devices fabricated with a low band gap polymer, PBDTTT-C-T was dissolved in ODCB (0.77 wt%), and PC71BM was then added into the solution to reach the desired weight ratio if needed. The solution was stirred at 70 °C overnight and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. The active layers were then spin-coated onto the ZnO layer with desired thickness, and diiodooctane (DIO) was added 3 v% to the solution before spin-coating if using the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM solution.40 The anode made of MoO3 (6 nm) and Ag (150 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask under vacuum (<10−6 Torr).
The procedure of cleaning the substrate, and CBL coating in OMPSCs are the same as in BHJPSCs. The PbI2 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a concentration of 460 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 15 s. After drying for 15 minutes in a glovebox, the substrate was heated in a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 minutes. Then, the substrate was dipped into the solution of CH3NH3I (FrontMaterials Co. Ltd) in anhydrous IPA (10 mg mL−1) for 40 s and washed with IPA. Subsequently, the solution of spiro-OMeTAD purchased from FrontMaterials Co. Ltd (80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 mL 4-tertbutylpyridine and 17.5 mL lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Au (80 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask under vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Each sample consists of four independent pixels defined by an active area of 0.04 cm2.
2.2. Device characterization
The devices were encapsulated and characterized in air under a 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated light source (Yamashita Denso solar simulator). Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 SMU. Solar illumination conforming the JIS Class AAA was provided by a SAN-EI 300 W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated with a Hamamatsu S1336-5BK silicon photodiode. IPCE spectra were measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination by monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110).
2.3. Thin film characterization
Absorption spectra were acquired using a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. For the measurement of electron mobility in BHJPSC devices, the space charge limited current (SCLC) was adopted according to the literature.41 For devices fabricated with C-PCBSD or C-PCBSD with the FPI dopant interlayer, the solution was spin-cast onto the ZnO layer. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 170 °C for 15 minutes in a glovebox for thermal cross-linking. The blend solutions containing P3HT/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) were spin-cast on top of the C-PCBSD layer. Finally, the top electrode, made of Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), was thermally evaporated at a pressure below 10−6 Torr to complete the devices. The electron mobility can be estimated by Mott–Gurney's equation, J = (9εεoμ/8)(V2/L3), where J is the current density, εo is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant of the organic semiconductor blend, μ is the charge carrier mobility, L is the thickness of the active layer and V is the voltage drop across the device. For the measurement of mobility in a pure system, an n-type heavily doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer of 300 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2 was used as the gate electrode and dielectric layer. Thin films of C-PCBSD and C-PCBSD with varying concentrations of the FPI dopant were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating their DCB solution. Gold source and drain contacts (40 nm in thickness) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the organic layer through a shadow mask, affording a bottom-gate, top-contact organic thin film transistor (OFET) device. Electrical measurements of the OFET devices were carried out at room temperature in air using a 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer, Agilent Technologies. The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime by using the equation, Ids = (μWCi/2L)(Vg − Vt)2, where Ids is the drain–source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width (1 mm), L is the channel length (0.1 mm), Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, Vg is the gate voltage and Vt is the threshold voltage.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Solvent-resistant test
In the previous study, the crosslinked PCBSD fullerene network offers a robust and adhesive thin film to improve the contact between ZnO and active layers.27 To study the solvent resistance of the C-PCBSD network with different FPI-doped concentrations, we spin-coated the pure PCBSD, PCBSD with 25 wt% FPI, and PCBSD with 50 wt% FPI onto the glass substrate followed by thermal heating at 170 °C for 15 min for crosslinking. Because FPI can be dissolved by nonpolar (o-dichlorobenzene denoted ODCB) and polar (DMF, isopropanol denoted IPA) solvents used for the processing of an active layer, the absorption spectra of the thin films were monitored before and after washing with ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), IPA and DMF sequentially. It was found that the absorption spectra of the C-PCBSD film remain unchanged before and after solvent rinsing (Fig. 2a), indicating the good solvent-resistance of the C-PCBSD network. Similar results can be seen in the C-PCBSD (FPI, 25%) and C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%) thin films (Fig. 2b and c). This result indicates that the cross-linked network of C-PCBSD can sufficiently protect the embedded FPI dopant from being dissolved by the solvent.

3.2. The mobility effect with different FPI dopant concentrations in the C-PCBSD thin film under SCLC and OFET measurements
Having demonstrated that the C-PCBSD (FPI, 25%) and C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%) films have good solvent resistance to realize the solution-processed layer-by-layer device fabrication, we further investigated the concentration effect of the FPI dopant on the mobility of the C-PCBSD/FPI layer.41 The electron mobility (μe) of C-PCBSD, C-PCBSD (FPI, 25 wt%), and C-PCBSD (FPI, 50 wt%) thin films was measured using SCLC devices. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 1. The undoped C-PCBSD exhibited a μe of 1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating its moderate semiconductor properties in nature. Upon incorporating the 25 wt% FPI dopant, the mobility enhanced to 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, when the dopant concentration increased to 50 wt%, the μe further increased to 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The SCLC electron-only devices ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD with or without FPI/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al with the P3HT:PCBM active layer may not truly reveal the improved mobility of the PCBSD with FPI. To address this issue, we directly fabricated OFET devices using C-PCBSD as an n-type material with or without FPI. We found that the OFET mobility increases by two orders of magnitude from 3.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 8.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the doping concentration increased from 0 to 50%. The results are shown in Fig. S1 and summarized in Table S1.† The undoped C-PCBSD exhibited n-channel OFET characteristics with a μe of 3.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Upon incorporating the 25 wt% FPI dopant, the enhanced μe of 3.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 by two orders of magnitude was obtained. Moreover, when the dopant concentration increased to 50 wt%, the μe further increased to 8.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results indicated that doping is effective for improving the electron mobility of C-PCBSD.

3.3. Device performance of BHJPSCs, PHJPSCs, and the measurement of external quantum efficiency (EQE)
The inverted BHJPSCs using ZnO, ZnO/C-PCBSD, and ZnO/C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%) as the CBLs were first evaluated in the P3HT:PC61BM active layer system. ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) (180 nm)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device A, ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) (180 nm)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device B, and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) (180 nm)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device C were therefore fabricated. The structures of the devices and chemicals are shown in Fig. 4. The J–V characteristics of Devices A, B, and C are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 2. Device A delivered a PCE of 3.5% with a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of 9.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 53%. With C-PCBSD as the interlayer in Device B to suppress leakage current, a higher PCE of 3.6% was reached with a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of 9.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67%. Finally, Device C where C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%) was adopted as the interlayer delivered a higher PCE of 3.9% with a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67%. The improved performance with better current was attributed to the enhanced electron mobility through AIET.

Meanwhile, to further test its universal application, a low bandgap polymer PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. 4c) blended with PC71BM was also employed to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device D. ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device E, and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device F were fabricated. The J–V characteristics of Devices D, E, and F are shown in Fig. 6a and summarized in Table 2. Device D delivered a PCE of 5.8% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58%. In a similar manner, a higher PCE of 6.0% was reached in Device E with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 13.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 57%. A superior PCE of 6.7% was achieved in Device F with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 15.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 56%. The presence of the C-PCBSD interlayer in Device E slightly enhanced the EQE spectra from 500 nm to 800 nm as shown in Fig. 6b and delivered a higher Jsc of 13.28 mA cm−2 than 12.50 mA cm−2 calculated from Device D. Furthermore, the current of Device F increased to 14.82 mA cm−2 when 50 wt% FPI was doped into the C-PCBSD interlayer. Again, the increased photocurrent can be attributed to the improved exciton dissociation and diminished series resistance via the AIET process.

To further confirm the role of the FPI dopant in the C-PCBSD thin film, a planar heterojunction device was fabricated for the purpose of precluding the influence of PCBM. These device architectures are ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/PBDTTT-C-T/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device G, ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD/PBDTTT-C-T/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device H, and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/PBDTTT-C-T/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) denoted as Device I. The J–V characteristics of Devices G, H, and I are shown in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table 2. Device G delivered a PCE of 0.1% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 0.29 mA cm−2, and a FF of 36%. A higher PCE of 0.4% was reached in Device H with a Voc of 0.86 36%. A higher PCE of 0.4% was reached in Device H with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 1.19 mA cm−2, and a FF of 37%. Once again, the presence of C-PCBSD diminished the series resistance and offered extra exciton dissociation with the enhancement of Jsc. More encouragingly, Device I delivered an outperforming PCE of 0.6% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 2.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 34%. The C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%) film with the enhanced mobility via AIET can extract more electron carriers from polymers.

3.4. Device performance of OMPSCs and the measurement of external quantum efficiency (EQE)
The C-PCBSD/FPI system with increasing mobilities indeed enhances the device performance in BHJPSCs and PHJPSCs. It is therefore envisaged that this strategy can be further applied to the OMPSC-based devices. Photovoltaic performances were investigated with the architecture of ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (376 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (253 nm)/Au (80 nm) denoted as Device J, ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD/CH3NH3PbI3 (376 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (253 nm)/Au (80 nm) denoted as Device K, and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/CH3NH3PbI3 (376 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (253 nm)/Au (80 nm) denoted as Device L. The J–V characteristics of Devices J, K, and L are shown in Fig. 8a and summarized in Table 3. Device J delivered a PCE of 7.0% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 54%. This similar device performance coincides with that reported in a recent study by Lee and co-workers.42 A better PCE of 10.2% was obtained for Device K with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64% when a C-PCBSD interlayer was adopted. The higher PCE resulted from the largely improved Jsc, and FF. Taking advantage of the improved mobility, Device L demonstrated an impressive PCE of 11.9% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69%. The result thus showed the potential use of FPI-doped C-PCBSD as the CBL for achieving better PCEs. In particular, as can be seen in Fig. 8b, Device K delivered enhanced EQE values from 350 to 750 nm as compared to Device J. Moreover, when the mobility of FPI:C-PCBSD was improved via AIET, Device L exhibited much higher EQE values from 450 to 750 nm. According to a recent report, it was found that CBLs could affect the thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3. Fig. 9 shows the images of CH3NH3PbI3 films onto ZnO, C-PCBSD/ZnO, and C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/ZnO after annealing treatment at 80 °C for 1 hour. After 1 hour annealing, the CH3NH3PbI3 film directly on ZnO changed color from dark brown to yellow. The yellow region indicated the formation of PbI2 resulting from the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. This result may imply that the residual moisture in ZnO diffuses into the active layer and degrades the perovskite layer. This result is consistent with a recent study by Gong and his co-workers.26 Recently, Kelly and co-workers point out degradation by the acid–base interface between ZnO and CH3NH3PbI3. The presence of C-PCBSD implies a more acidic surface than the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.43 In contrast, the color of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films deposited onto the C-PCBSD/ZnO or C-PCBSD (FPI, 50%)/ZnO layers remained unchanged during annealing treatment. This result demonstrated that the C-PCBSD/FPI system can function as a protecting layer to prevent the CH3NH3PbI3 layer from moisture in OMPSCs.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a new fullerene-based CBL with enhanced mobility by incorporating an ionic FPI into the C-PCBSD network. By taking advantage of the high mobility of the FPI dopant, the 50 wt% FPI-doped C-PCBSD interlayer can substantially enhance the Jsc and PCE in PHJPSCs as well as OMPSCs. Meanwhile, the C-PCBSD network can prevent the residual moisture from diffusing into the perovskite layer, thus improving the thermal stability of the devices. Finally, this strategy offers a universal CBL to enhance the PCEs of BHJPSCs and OMPSCs (5.8% to 6.7% and 7.0% to 11.9%, respectively) by facilitating electron transfer between the active layer and electrode.
