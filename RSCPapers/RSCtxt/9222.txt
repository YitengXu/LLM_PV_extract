Developing effective methods to fabricate high-performance thick-film PSCs is important to meet the requirements of future roll-to-roll commercial production. PffBT4T-2OD (PCE11) as the most promising temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) donor with high crystallinity has achieved high performance at high film thickness; however, it needs high processing temperature which is detrimental for practical production of large-area PSCs. We designed NFAs, ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH containing different side chains. Because of the excellent miscibility of the TDA-polymer PffBT4T-2OD and ZITI-N-R, devices can be fabricated at room temperature, achieving a medium PCE of 8.78% for ZITI-N-CH3-based PSCs, a high PCE of 12.13% for ZITI-N-C8H17-based PSCs and a superior PCE of 13.07% for ZITI-N-EH-based PSCs, which is attributed to the smallest domain size and highest crystallization for the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend. The PCE of 13.07% is the highest among those reported for TDA polymer-based PSCs, which can be maintained at 12.35% at a high thickness of 200 nm. This work provides an important guideline to develop high-performance thick-film TDA-polymer-based non-fullerene PSCs under mild processing conditions.
1. Introduction
With persistent efforts based on material and device engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) has surpassed 16% recently,1–12 which reveals the great potential and bright prospect of this green energy technology in the future commercial market. Besides the energy conversion efficiency, other issues including material cost,13,14 device stability,15–17 large-area fabricability,18–20etc. are becoming increasingly important on the way towards commercial applications. Especially, thick-film PSCs with high PCEs that are insensitive to active-layer thickness are crucial not only for sunlight collection but also for the roll-to-roll process with high product yield rate.21–24
Besides device optimization,25–30 the development of organic photovoltaic materials possessing high crystallinity and high carrier mobility such as polymer donors with strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) properties is a more primary and general approach to achieve high-performance thick-film devices.31–35 By spin-coating a hot solution of a TDA polymer donor and fullerene acceptor on a hot substrate, an optimal nanoscale interpenetrating morphology can be realized resulting in efficient charge carrier transport pathways.36,37 So far, the efficiency record of fullerene-based PSCs certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has been 11.5%, which utilized a material combination of TDA polymer PffBT4T-NU and PC71BM.38 With the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) possessing highly adjustable absorption and energy levels,39–46 PSCs based on TDA polymer donors represented by PffBT4T-2OD (PCE11) and PffBT4T-2DT and NFAs are paid much more attention. PffBT4T-2DT:EH-IDTBR- and PffBT4T-2OD:EH-IDTBR-based PSCs can deliver PCEs of 9.5% and 9.95% with a thin active layer thickness of about 100 nm.47,48 By optimizing device architectures to overcome the space-charge effect, PffBT4T-2OD:EH-IDTBR-based solar cells can maintain a PCE of 9.1% with a high active layer thickness of 300 nm.49 Besides, other NFAs including perylene diimide (PDI) acceptors50,51 and ITIC52,53 have also been matched with PffBT4T-2OD, which, however, leads to low PCEs less than 8%. All of these TDA polymer:NFA-based PSCs still need to be processed at a high temperature of ∼110 °C with efficiencies even lower than those of PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene-based PSCs. Such harsh processing conditions should be avoided for the practical production of large-area PSCs. To fabricate TDA polymer-based PSCs under milder fabrication conditions, some efforts have been made. It was revealed that random terpolymers with varied amounts of thiophene linker that replaces the bithiophene of PffBT4T-2OD can significantly reduce self-aggregation in solution, and the resulting devices can be prepared at room temperature with an average PCE of 9.6%.54 So far, processing these TDA polymer donor-based non-fullerene PSCs under mild fabrication conditions and meanwhile, with high photovoltaic performance at high active layer thicknesses has not been achieved yet.
By introducing the liquid-crystalline small molecule BTR into PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM binary PSCs, the TDA properties of PffBT4T-2OD can be decreased and a PCE of 10.59% can be obtained for the room-temperature processed ternary device, which is comparable to the performance of the corresponding high-temperature processed binary devices.55 We envisioned that suitable non-fullerene acceptors possessing appropriate miscibility with PffBT4T-2OD may offer an opportunity for processing high-performance TDA polymer donor-based PSCs at room temperature. Recently, we developed a series of ZITI-X NIR acceptors (X = S, C, N) with a high structural similarity and varied highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels,56 among which ZITI-N with the highest HOMO energy level matches well with the PffBT4T-2OD donor leading to a small energy loss. To gain better miscibility in the donor:acceptor blend, we designed and synthesized three NFAs ZITI-N-R (R = CH3, C8H17, EH, which refer to the methyl, n-octyl, and 2-ethylhexyl groups) with different side chains. According to the interaction parameter χ,57 compared with PffBT4T-2OD and PC71BM, PffBT4T-2OD and ZITI-N-R exhibit significantly improved miscibility. With the material combination of PffBT4T-2OD and ZITI-N-R, we achieved room-temperature processable TDA polymer-based NFA PSCs. Along with the change of side chains from CH3 to n-C8H17 and EH, the photovoltaic performance is improved from 8.78% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3- to 12.13% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- and 13.07% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSCs. Moreover, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices can deliver a high PCE of 12.35% at a thickness of 200 nm. The performance of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSC is the highest among those of TDA polymer-based PSCs reported to date. Detailed device physics investigations suggest that the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSC shows improved charge carrier mobilities, better charge extraction and collection efficiency and suppressed bi-molecular recombination. Moreover, according to the morphology investigation, the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend possesses a decreased domain size and increased crystallization, which leads to an improved fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc).
2. Results and discussion
The detailed synthetic route towards compounds ZITI-N-R is shown in Scheme S1,† and is similar to the synthesis of ZITI-N.50 The molecular frameworks of these acceptors are identical except that the side chains are different. As shown in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1,† the side chain changes from methyl (R = CH3) to n-octyl (R = n-C8H17) and 2-ethylhexyl (R = EH) corresponding to the acceptors ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH, respectively. Conventional NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy were applied to fully characterize all new compounds. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was applied to investigate their thermal stability under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1†). ZITI-N-EH displays better thermal stability with a higher decomposition temperature (at 5% weight loss) at 352 °C than ZITI-N-C8H17 at 329 °C and ZITI-N-CH3 at 322 °C. The DSC study of ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17 and ZITI-N-EH shows that there is no obvious phase transition during annealing (Fig. S5†). The UV-vis absorption spectra of ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH in solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. S1† and 1b. The three molecules in solution show a similar absorption range of 600–800 nm with similar molar extinction coefficients (ε) of about 3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Notably, compared with the maximum absorption in solution at 747 nm, a significantly red-shifted absorption spectrum is observed in thin films. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH films are estimated to be 1.41, 1.40, and 1.40 eV according to the absorption edges at 879, 883, and 886 nm, respectively. The absorption range of ZITI-N-R films at 600–890 nm are complemented with the TDA polymer donor PffBT4T-2OD in the visible-near-infrared region. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is utilized to evaluate the electrochemical properties (Fig. S1†) and the corresponding energy diagram is presented in Fig. 1c. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH possess similar HOMO energy levels of −5.53, −5.53, and −5.52 eV, respectively. In comparison with ZITI-N-CH3 with a LUMO energy level of −3.82 eV, ZITI-N-C8H17 and ZITI-N-EH show slightly decreased LUMO energy levels of −3.85 and −3.86 eV, respectively, corresponding to the narrower bandgaps.

As shown in Fig. 2a, unlike the PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene blend, which needs to be processed at high temperatures to obtain the optimal morphology because of the strong aggregation of PffBT4T-2OD, the solution of PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-R at room temperature is uniform and stable, which can be spin-coated at room temperature. We calculated the surface tensions of PffBT4T-2OD, PC71BM, ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH from the contact angles of water and formamide (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). To afford an accurate comparison of miscibility, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ of the two blends was further evaluated based on the equation:  (γdonor and γacceptor represent the surface tensions of the neat donor film and acceptor film, and K is a constant).30 As shown in Table S1,† compared with PC71BM, the  of ZITI-N-R decreases, indicating the enhanced miscibility of PffBT4T-2OD and ZITI-N-R.

Bulk heterojunction PSCs are fabricated with a traditional device architecture, indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINO/Al, using PffBT4T-2OD as the donor, and low-bandgap ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH as acceptors, respectively. In this work, all the devices are processed at room temperature. The details of the device optimization processes including donor:acceptor weight ratio, thermal annealing, and layer thickness are shown and summarized in Tables S2–S4.† The optimal treatment conditions involve thermal annealing (TA) at 100 °C, 100 °C, and 80 °C for 10 min for the devices based on PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blends with a thickness of ∼130 nm. The optimized device parameters are summarized in Table 1 and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells are depicted in Fig. 2c. Along with the change of the side chain of ZITI-N-R from methyl to n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl, the Jsc and FF increase from 18.97 mA cm−2 and 56.02% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 to 21.04 mA cm−2 and 71.85% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, and 22.13 mA cm−2 and 73.35% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH. The increase of Jsc is verified by EQE spectra (Fig. 2d). The integrated current densities are 18.62, 20.87 and 21.66 mA cm−2 for the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the measured Jscs with minor errors of 1–2%. Since the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is usually determined by the energy-level difference between the LUMO of the electron acceptor and the HOMO of the electron donor, the Vocs of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH- (0.805 V) and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- (0.802 V) based devices are lower than that of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (0.824 V)-based device, which can be ascribed to the slightly deeper LUMO energy levels of ZITI-N-EH and ZITI-N-C8H17. Compared with the PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM-based device with a large energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − qVoc) of 0.83 eV, it is worth noting that the Elosss for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17 and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH devices are estimated to be as low as 0.60, 0.60, and 0.59 eV. Finally, the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices deliver the highest PCE of 13.07% compared to those of PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-based devices, 12.13% and 8.78%, respectively. Furthermore, the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based device can deliver a high PCE of 12.35% even at a thickness of 200 nm. After the optimization, encapsulated devices were stored in a glove box for 9 days, and the PCE can still be maintained over 95% (Fig. S6†).

To investigate the different performances of these devices, exciton dissociation, carrier transport and recombination processes are investigated. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the optimized cells was measured to examine the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection (Fig. 3a). Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under one standard sun illumination and darkness, respectively, and Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. The ratio of Jph/Jsat can reflect the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density. The Jph/Jsat values are calculated to be 93.07%, 95.68%, and 97.10% under the short-circuit condition and 66.24%, 83.37% and 84.69% under the maximum power output condition for the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17-, and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices, respectively, implying that PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices have the best charge extraction and collection efficiency, which contributes to the highest Jsc. In addition, we measured the light intensity (P) dependence of Jsc and Voc (Fig. 3b and c) to investigate the recombination mechanism. In principle, the recombination parameters (α) defined by equation Jsc ∝ Pα are close to 1.0, suggesting negligible bimolecular recombination. PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices show a higher α value of 0.93 than those of PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- (0.92) and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3- (0.90) based devices. The highest slope for the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based device implies the weakest bimolecular recombination. The relationship of Voc and the light intensity can be expressed as: Voc ∝ nkT/q, where T, q, and k are the temperature in Kelvin, the elementary charge, and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. n is close to 1, implying that bimolecular recombination is a dominant mechanism, and when n is close to 2, trap-assisted recombination is involved. The slopes for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17-, and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices are 1.27 kT/q, 1.24 kT/q, and 1.25 kT/q, respectively, indicating that all the devices show small trap-assisted recombination losses. Moreover, Table 1 and Fig. 3d show improved electron (μe) and hole mobilities (μh), 2.13 × 10−4 and 3.32 × 10−4, 2.45 × 10−4 and 4.25 × 10−4, 2.67 × 10−4 and 4.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17-, and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based devices, respectively. Compared with the pure donor PffBT4T-2OD with high hole mobilities of about 10−2 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1,34 all the blend films show lower hole mobilities, indicating that donor and acceptor materials can be well mixed. Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the enhanced Jsc and FF of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSC can be attributed to the enhanced exciton dissociation, increased carrier transport properties, and reduced carrier recombination.

To explore the origin of the different performances, the blend morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping-mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S4,† all the blend films show smooth and uniform surface morphologies. By changing the side chains of ZITI-N-R from methyl to n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups, the root mean square (RMS) value was reduced from 2.37 nm to 1.29 nm and 1.14 nm. Similar to the AFM images, the TEM image of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend shows the narrowest fibril structure and the smallest domain size compared to the other two blends, leading to good bi-continuous networks with improved carrier transport, and thus synergistically improved device parameters. We further surveyed the morphological details by employing grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). As shown in Fig. 4, the pristine PffBT4T-2OD polymer shows good molecular ordering, as evidenced by strong lamellar (100), (200), and even (300) reflection peaks as well as a particularly strong out-of-plane (OOP) π–π stacking peak, indicating high crystallinity. The ZITI-N-CH3, ZITI-N-C8H17, and ZITI-N-EH films display obvious (100) diffraction at 0.29, 0.31, and 0.31 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and (010) π–π stacking peaks at 1.67, 1.84 and 1.84 Å−1 in the OOP direction, corresponding to the reduced π–π stacking distance of 3.75, 3.41, and 3.41 Å and demonstrating the face-on orientation. When blended with PffBT4T-2OD, the stacking peaks from both the donor and acceptor can be clearly observed, which implies that their crystallinity can be maintained in the blends. The PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH film shows the shortest π–π stacking distance of 3.40 Å compared to those of PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17 (3.41 Å) and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (3.70 Å). Moreover, the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend film shows the highest crystal coherence length (CCL) in the OOP direction of 4.1 nm compared to those of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17 (3.4 nm) and the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (1.9 nm) blend films. The results indicate that the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend shows enhanced π–π stacking features and the highest molecular crystallinity characteristics. RSoXS at 285.2 eV photon energy was applied to examine the phase separation of BHJ thin films. PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 shows a scattering hump at 0.075 Å−1, indicating a domain size of 42 nm. PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17 and PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend films show quite similar scattering features with a scattering hump at around 0.096 and 0.01 Å−1, indicating decreased domain sizes of 32 and 31 nm. These results show that the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend possesses the smallest domain size and the highest crystallinity, which is consistent with its highest Jsc and FF.

3. Conclusions
In summary, to match with the high-crystallinity TDA polymer donor PffBT4T-2OD, three acceptors ZITI-N-R possessing suitable HOMO energy levels and optical bandgaps were designed and synthesized. Their good miscibility with PffBT4T-2OD enable the fabrication of PffBT4T-2OD-based non-fullerene PSCs at room temperature. By changing the side chain of ZITI-N-R from methyl to n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups, the PCE increases from 8.78% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3- to 12.13% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17- and 13.07% for PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSCs. As compared with PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3-based PSCs, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSCs exhibit the highest PCEs with a slightly lower Voc and a significantly increased Jsc and FF. According to the detailed structure–morphology–performance relationship analysis, the slightly lower Voc is due to the slightly low LUMO energy level and the increased Jsc and FF can be ascribed to the optimal phase separation and stronger crystallinity of the PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH blend. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the PCE of 13.07% for the optimized PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH-based PSC is the highest among those reported for TDA polymer-based PSCs. Moreover, the thick-film device of PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH can maintain a high PCE of 12.35% at a thickness of 200 nm. Our work provides a promising way to fully utilize the advantages of TDA polymers for the development of thick-film PSCs under mild processing conditions to meet the requirements of the roll-to-roll large-area production of organic solar cells.

4. Experimental
Materials and general methods
All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Unless stated otherwise, starting materials were obtained from Adamas, Aldrich, or J&K and were used without further purification. Anhydrous THF and toluene were distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. Anhydrous DMF was distilled over CaH2 prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with Bruker Fourier 300 or Bruker Avance 400 spectrometers. Chemical shifts for hydrogens are reported in parts per million (ppm, scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the residual protons in the NMR solvent (CDCl3: 7.26). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts for carbons are reported in parts per million (ppm, scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonance of the solvent (CDCl3: 77.2). The data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet and/or multiple resonances, br = broad), coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and integration. MALDI measurements were performed with a MALDI-FT 9.4 T, Bruker solariX, or MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Autoflex III. Elemental analyses were performed with a Flash EA 1112 Series from ThermoQuest. UV-vis spectroscopy was performed with Jasco V-570 spectrometers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a CHI620D potentiostat. All measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under a nitrogen atmosphere, equipped with a glassy-carbon electrode, a platinum counter-electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. CV was performed with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Shimadzu DTG 60 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere with runs recorded from room temperature to 510 °C.
Fabrication of organic solar cells
The device structures were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (or PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH)/PDINO/Al. Organic solar cell devices were fabricated using ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1), which were cleaned with de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in successive 20 min sonication steps applying a final 20 min oxygen plasma treatment to eliminate any remaining organic component. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was first spin-coated on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the active layers are dissolved in boiling chloroform solution at 80 °C for 5 minutes and then cooled to room temperature, and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The active layers were spin coated from chloroform solution with the same optimal donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1 for both PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (or PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH) blends with a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1 and then treated with thermal annealing at 100 °C, 100 °C and 80 °C for 10 min, respectively. Then PDINO as the electron transporting layer was spin-coated on the active layer at 3000 rpm from alcohol solution. At the final stage, the substrates were pumped down in high vacuum, and aluminum (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer. Shadow masks were used to define the PSC active area (0.05 cm2) of the devices.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of unencapsulated photovoltaic devices were measured under N2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon arc solar simulator (Oriel) with an AM 1.5 global filter operated at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The illumination intensity was corrected by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was calculated using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc, SolarCellScan100).
SCLC mobility measurements
Space charge-limited currents were measured in electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (or PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH)/Al and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-CH3 (or PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-C8H17, PffBT4T-2OD:ZITI-N-EH)/Au. The devices were prepared following the same procedure described in the experimental section for photovoltaic devices, except for the metal electrode. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC current with field dependent mobility, which is described as (1)where J is the current, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
Microstructure investigation
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films were obtained on a NanoscopeIIIa AFM (Digital Instruments) operating platform in tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed on a JEOL 2200FS at 160 kV accelerating voltage. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction characterization of the thin films was performed at the SSRL on beamline 11–3, Standford Synchrotron Radiation Lab. Thin film samples were spin-cast onto PEDOT:PSS covered SiO2 wafers. The scattering signal was recorded on a 2D detector (MarCCD). The samples were ≈15 mm long in the direction of the beam path, and the detector was located at a distance of ≈300 mm from the sample center (distance calibrated using a silver behenate standard). The incidence angle of 0.16° was chosen which gave the optimized signal-to-background ratio. The beam energy was 8 keV. All GIWAXS experiments were done in a helium atmosphere. The data were processed and analyzed using the waxdiff software package.
