1. Introduction
Macrocycles, which are cyclic molecules, have played an important role in modern chemistry, especially supramolecular chemistry and materials chemistry. A variety of macrocycles, such as crown ethers, cyclodextrin, pillar[n]arene, and metal–organic coordination macrocycles, have been synthesized in recent decades and exhibited intriguing applications in the fields of molecular sensing, self-assembly, catalysis, molecular machines and so on.1–3 In fact, the discovery of crown ethers with the ability to recognize alkali metal ions has generally been considered the starting point of modern supramolecular chemistry.4 Thus, the construction of novel macrocycles has received increasing attention from numerous chemists worldwide,5 further promoting the development of supramolecular chemistry and materials sciences.
Recently, BF2-chelated dipyrromethene compounds, called BODIPYs, have attracted increasing attention.6–8 As a porphyrin analogue, BODIPYs have large molar absorption coefficients, high emission quantum yields, tuneable photophysical properties and excellent chemical stability. Based on these outstanding features, BODIPYs are now widely applied in fluorescent sensors, photovoltaic devices, bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and artificial photosynthetic antennas.9 Integrating two or more BODIPY subunits into a macrocycle may result in distinct properties from those of a single BODIPY because (1) macrocycles with multi-BODIPY subunits have more bonding sites to enhance the interactions with guests; (2) the well-preorganized macrocyclic framework could participate in multiple interactions, including electrostatic interactions and C–H⋯π interactions, to bind with more complex guests; and (3) macrocycles that undergo excitation energy transfer could serve as efficient artificial photosynthetic antenna models. In recent decades, people have designed and synthesized a variety of BODIPY-based macrocycles and investigated their photophysical properties and applications. These BODIPY-based macrocycles can be simply classified into covalent and noncovalent macrocycles. Among the BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles, BODIPY units are generally linked by para-phenylene, meta-phenylene, carbohydrate, thioether and some heterocycles, such as pyridine and furan. However, among BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles, metal-coordinated macrocycles constitute the majority because coordination-driven self-assembly has proven to be a simple yet highly efficient approach to prepare various supramolecular macrocycles with predetermined shapes, sizes, and distributions and total numbers of functional groups.10 It should be noted that differences in the linkage moiety have a great impact on the shape, size, photophysical properties, and applications of macrocycles.
In this tutorial review, we will discuss the synthesis, photophysical and photochemical properties and applications of BODIPY-based macrocycles. For clarity, we have classified these BODIPY-based macrocycles based on their synthesis strategies, including covalent synthesis and noncovalent self-assembly.
2. BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles
BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles can be prepared through two different synthetic strategies. In the first strategy, the macrocycles of porphyrin analogues are prepared and then reacted with a boron reagent (usually boron trifluoride ethyl ether) to afford the resultant BODIPY-based macrocycles (Scheme 1a). In the second case, the BODIPY subunits are synthesized first and then the macrocycles are obtained through macrocylization (Scheme 1b). Furthermore, according to the linkage moiety of the BODIPY subunits, BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles could be further classified into conjugated and non-conjugated macrocycles.

(b) Dipyrromethane reacted with BF3·OEt2 to form the BODIPY unit and then the BODIPY macrocycles were obtained through macrocylization. 
2.1 BODIPY-based conjugated covalent macrocycles
In 2004, Sessler and co-workers reported the synthesis of pyrrole-linked covalent BODIPY macrocycles (Fig. 1).11 They first tried to obtain the BF2 complex of tetraarylporphyrins (1a) by treating BF3·OEt2 with octaethylporphyrin (OEP). However, product 1a was very labile and easily hydrolysed to generate B2OF2(OEP) 1b when exposed to water since the porphyrin core is too small to easily complex two BF2 subunits. As shown in Fig. 1, X-ray crystallography analysis of 1b indicated that porphyrin underwent an unusual distortion in which the two pyrrole rings and the in-plane boron were coplanar, whereas the pyrrole rings attached to the out-of-plane boron were tilted away from the plane. These results inspired the authors to design and synthesize the larger expanded porphyrin compounds 2 and 5. When treated with BF3·OEt2, amethyrin 2 and [32]octaphyrin 5 formed their bis- and mono-BF2 complexes 3–4 and 6–7 under standard conditions. The X-ray crystal structures of bis-BF2 amethyrin complex 3 and bis-BF2 [32]octaphyrin complex 6 revealed that complex 3 adopted a bowl-shaped conformation, while complex 6 displayed a figure-eight conformation with strongly twisted bridging dipyrrole units. More importantly, in comparison with the labile complex 1a, complexes 3 and 6 were both stable since the larger separations of the two BF2 groups in the larger amethyrin and [32]octaphyrin macrocycles did not permit the close approach of boron atoms necessary for the formation of B–O–B linkages.

Based on the strategy mentioned above, Sessler and co-workers reported the synthesis of a pyridine-linked BODIPY macrocycle 9 in 2017.12 As shown in Fig. 2, the cyclic precursor 8 was synthesized first and then reacted with BF3·OEt2 to afford the resultant triBODIPY macrocycle 9. The X-ray crystal structure indicated that macrocycle 9 adopted a flattened calixarene-like conformation due to steric hindrance induced by the crowded BF2 subunits (Fig. 2b and c). Fluorescence investigation suggested that the expanded rosarian derivative 8 was nearly nonfluorescent, while the triBODIPY macrocycle 9 was highly emissive, with a peak centred at 612 nm and a strong shoulder at approximately 657 nm in the fluorescence spectrum, which were redshifted compared to those of typical mono-BODIPYs (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the fluorescence quantum yield and the average fluorescence lifetime of triBODIPY macrocycle 9 were calculated to be 0.33 and 6.58 ns, respectively. Notably, the average lifetime of triBODIPY macrocycle 9 was longer than that of typical mono- and bis-BODIPYs. More importantly, the concave nature of triBODIPY macrocycle 9 enables it to complex fullerenes directly without ancillary linkers, such as metalloporphyrinoids and crown ethers, thus potentially acting as a rudimentary photosynthetic antenna and reaction centre model. As shown in Fig. 2e, the addition of Li+@C60 to the solution of macrocycle 9 caused significant fluorescence quenching and decreased the quantum yield from 0.33 to 0.04, which was attributed to the cooperation of static and dynamic quenching. X-ray diffraction analyses of single crystals demonstrated that macrocycle 9 could bind to C60 through π–π, CH–π, and F–π interactions with a binding ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, although 1:1 binding was dominant in solution (Fig. 2f and g). In addition, the fluorescence quenching phenomenon when complexed with cationic fullerene Li+@C60 revealed a possible host-to-guest charge transfer (CT) transition in the complex. Transient absorption (TA) spectra exhibited an absorption peak at 1040 nm, which was ascribed to the radical anion form of Li+@C60, providing strong evidence for the occurrence of CT (Fig. 2h). Further spectral analysis indicated that charge separation was accomplished within 200 fs after photoexcitation and charge recombination occurred with a lifetime of approximately 35 ps. These results indicated that triBODIPY macrocycle 9 could act as an effective photoantenna to drive photoinduced electron transfer when combined with appropriately chosen electron-deficient guests. This research represents the first example of the use of BF2 complexation to create a rigid framework that functions as both a light-harvesting mimic and a receptor for large electron-deficient guests.

In 2010, Nabeshima and co-workers reported the synthesis of para-phenylene-linked BODIPY macrocycles 10–11.13 The dipyrrin macrocycle precursors were treated with BF3·OEt2 to obtain BODIPY macrocycles 10 and 11 with yields of 29% and 99%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, BODIPY macrocycles 10–11 consisted of three BODIPY subunits linked by para-phenylene at the α position of BODIPY. The X-ray crystal structure indicated that macrocycle 11 adopted a planar triangular conformation with a 4 Å cavity, and the electrostatic potential surfaces of fluorine atoms were negatively charged. Based on the above results, the authors further studied the host–guest interaction of 10 and 11 with cationic guests. The UV-vis absorption spectrum showed that upon the addition of Cs+ to 10 and 11 in CHCl3–CH3OH (10:1), the intensity of the absorption peaks at 552 and 531 nm decreased, while the absorption at 540 and 522 nm increased (Fig. 3b). Integration of the results of UV-vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and NMR spectra revealed the strong alkali-metal recognition of 10–11, and a 1:1 complex was formed. Otherwise, both macrocycles exhibited the highest affinity to Cs+ (logKa ≈ 5), which can be ascribed to the size-matching effect because the cavity sizes of 10–11 (4 Å) and the ionic diameter of Cs+ (3.34 Å) were very similar. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and spectroscopic experiments indicated that di-n-butylammonium 12 could insert into the cavities of 10 and 11 to form pseudorotaxanes. The X-ray crystals of pseudorotaxane 11·12 revealed the formation of non-classical BF2⋯H–N hydrogen bonds in the complex (Fig. 3c). This research provided new molecular recognition systems based on BODIPY, which could be applied in the construction of molecular machines.

In 2016, Nabeshima and co-workers reported the synthesis of a series of meta-phenylene-linked BODIPY macrocycles.14 The dipyrrin macrocycle precursors 14–17 were synthesized by an acid-catalysed condensation reaction followed by oxidation with DDQ. Four dipyrrin macrocycles consisting of different amounts of dipyrrin (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) were obtained. The X-ray crystal structure indicated that the size and shape varied significantly according to the number of dipyrrin subunits. The shape of dimer 14 could be roughly considered as a planar rhombus, that of trimer 15 was a nonplanar bowl, that of tetramer 16 was a planar four-pointed star, and pentamer 17 adopted a nonplanar conformation similar to a vertical loop. Theoretical calculations revealed that larger macrocycles were energetically favourable. Spectral measurements showed that the absorption maxima of 14, 15, 16, and 17 were 475 nm, 474 nm, 513 nm, and 513 nm, respectively, indicating that the dipyrrin subunits were not conjugated in the macrocycles. It should be noted that the twisted conformation played an important role in the small π conjugation, which demonstrated the availability of the m-phenylene linker in the preparation of a variety of shapes of macrocycles. Furthermore, dipyrrin macrocycles 15–16 were converted to BODIPY macrocycles 18–20 by treatment with BF3·OEt2. As shown in Fig. 4b, X-ray crystals of the BODIPY macrocycles were obtained and indicated that the shape of BODIPY trimer 18 was a nonplanar bowl, similar to that of its cyclic precursor 15. The BODIPY macrocycle 19, which consisted of two BODIPY subunits and two dipyrrin subunits, adopted an armchair-like conformation. BODIPY tetramer 20 had a four-pointed star shape, which was also similar to that of its cyclic precursor 16. Moreover, the m-phenylene linker had no effect on the photophysical properties of the chromophores, and both BODIPY macrocycles 18 and 20 exhibited large molar absorption coefficients and high fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF = 0.60) (Fig. 5) and can be further used in fluorescent sensors. The research illustrated the influence of the linker on the shapes of macrocycles as well as their photophysical properties, which could lay the foundation for the construction of fluorescent macrocycles.

Even though BODIPY macrocycles 18–20 exhibited excellent photophysical properties, they couldn’t be used as molecular hosts due to that the existence of methyl groups at β positions may disturbed their interaction with guests. Therefore, in 2016, Nabeshima and co-workers reported the synthesis of another type of meta-phenylene-linked BODIPY macrocycles which removed the methyl groups at β positions.15 As shown in Fig. 6, dipyrrin trimer 22 was synthesized by a TFA-catalysed reaction in 16% yield. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that it had a nonplanar L-shaped structure and lost C3 symmetry. Then, after treatment with BF3·OEt2, dipyrrin trimer 22 was converted into BODIPY trimer 25 in 79% yield. The crystal structure revealed that 25 adopted a bowl-shaped conformation and that its convex and concave faces had different local environments. The 1H NMR spectrum suggested that the rate of bowl inversion of BODIPY trimer 25 was very slow and that the activation energy was relatively high (>108 kJ mol−1), which afforded the possibility of realizing unidirectional threading when interacting with asymmetric guests. Due to the six polarized Bδ+–Fδ− bonds similar to that in 10 and 11, BODIPY trimer 25 is expected to be an excellent host for recognizing cationic guests. 1H NMR titration experiments indicated that it can form a 1:1 complex with dibutylammonium cations, and UV/vis titration measurements showed a binding constant of logKa = 5.49(3). The driving force for the formation of the host–guest complex was the BF2⋯H–N hydrogen bond in the complex, and a pseudorotaxane was formed. Then, the asymmetrical guest benzylbutylammonium ion 29 was selected as an axle for unidirectional threading due to the existence of two different local environments for macrocycles in 23 (Fig. 7). 1H NMR spectroscopy and UV/vis titration experiments indicated the formation of the 1:1 complex 25·29, and the binding constant was logKa = 5.48(3). Moreover, only one set of signals was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex, which strongly supported the exclusive formation of one conformational isomer. The unidirectional threading was probably due to the presence of a bulky benzene ring, which allowed only the alkyl side to insert into the cavity of the macrocycle 25. These results pave the way for the construction of artificial molecular machines that can achieve one-way movement fuelled by energy. In addition, BODIPY trimer 25 can recognize adrenaline 30 through multiple interactions, including hydrogen bonding, C–H⋯π interactions and coulomb forces, which afforded the first example of artificial macrocycles for the recognition of natural products through nonselective interactions. Furthermore, the authors reported the synthesis of macrocyclic dipyrrin tetramer 23 and pentamer 24 under the same conditions as used for the synthesis of the dipyrrin trimer 22.16 By treatment with BF3·OEt2, the dipyrrin tetramer 23 and pentamer 24 were converted into BODIPY tetramer 26 and pentamer 28 with yields of 69% and 54%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated that BODIPY tetramer 26 adopted a four-pointed star shape, which was similar to that of 20. BODIPY pentamer 28 in the solid state possessed a uniquely folded conformation with two distinct regions: a bowl-shaped circular framework similar to that of 25 and a loop-like structure. The two different structural regions in 28 allowed the recognition of two dibutylammonium cations 12 with two-step binding constants of logK1 = 6.7 ± 1.0 and logK2 = 3.0 ± 0.1. In addition, 27 was also obtained from the dipyrrin tetramer under suitable reaction conditions, and the X-ray crystallography results indicated that it adopted a folded chair-like conformation. Additionally, BODIPY tetramer 26 and pentamer 28 were both highly emissive, with quantum yields of 0.83 and 0.91, respectively, making them good candidates as fluorescent sensors and light-harvesting mimics.

Ravikanth et al. reported heterocycle (pyrrole and furan)-linked BODIPY macrocycles in 2011.17 As shown in Fig. 8, treating the oxasmaragdyrin precursors 33–36 with BF3·OEt2 provided the resultant BF2 complex 37–40 in 66–76% yield. The BODIPY macrocycles 37–40 exhibited interesting photophysical properties, including strong absorption in the near-red region (λ = 702 nm) and two-fold higher fluorescence quantum yield than their oxasmaragdyrin precursors. In addition, electrochemical experiments indicated that the BODIPY macrocycles 37–40 showed more positive oxidation potentials (∼500 mV) and lower negative reduction potential (∼450–500 mV) than their oxasmaragdyrin precursors, making 37–40 more difficult to oxidize but easier to reduce. Therefore, the macrocycles became more electron deficient after BF2 complexation. Nevertheless, the BF2-smaragdyrin complexes were not suitable for use as fluorescence sensors due to the inner BF2⋯H–N hydrogen bond between BF2 and the pyrrole subunits. Furthermore, BF2–smaragdyrin complexes 37 were converted into B(OR)2 complexes 41–44 by treatment with AlCl3 and appropriate alcohols in CH2Cl2 at refluxing temperature. Upon the addition of F− to 41, the absorption peaks at 446, 475, and 705 nm decreased, accompanied by the appearance of three new peaks at 455, 487, and 720 nm (Fig. 8b), and the binding constant was calculated to be 13000 M−1. In addition, the addition of F− quenched the emission of 41 at 713 nm and induced systematic changes in the oxidation waves (Fig. 8c). Moreover, spectrographic and electrochemical measurements indicated that the B(OH)2–smaragdyrin complex 41 did not respond to other anions, such as Cl−, Br−, I−, HSO4−, and ClO4−. Thus, 41 could realize selective recognition with F−. This research reported the preparation of the first example of BF2 and B(OR)2 complexes of oxasmaragdyrin and investigated the B(OR)2 complexes of oxasmaragdyrin as an exclusive sensor for F−, which paved the way to construct new BODIPY macrocycles for fluorescent sensors.

Based on the above results, in 2017, Ravikanth and co-workers reported the synthesis of oxasmaragdyrin–BODIPY donor–acceptor systems by introducing a BODIPY unit onto the periphery of BF2-chelated oxasmaragdyrin (Fig. 9a).18 The oxasmaragdyrin–meso-BODIPYnyl complexes were reacted with BF3·OEt2 to afford oxasmaragdyrin–BODIPY dyads 45–46, and they were well characterized by 1H, 19F, 11B and 2D NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 9b, the X-ray crystal structure indicated that dyad 45 had a coplanar conformation. Interestingly, when excited at the BODIPY and oxasmaragdyrin absorption peak maxima, the emission was quantitatively quenched, indicating the occurrence of strong charge-transfer-type interactions between the BODIPY and oxasmaragdyrin moieties (Fig. 9c and d). Further computational studies showed that part of the HOMO was on the BODIPY entity, and part of the LUMO was on the oxasmaragdyrin entity, indicating possible charge-transfer interactions within dyads 45–46. Electrochemical studies indicated that BODIPY was a good electron acceptor and that oxasmaragdyrin was a good electron donor. The estimated energy of charge separation was −0.43 and −1.09 eV, −0.43 and −0.77 eV for 45 and 46, respectively, which revealed that photoinduced charge separation was thermodynamically feasible. Furthermore, the resulting femtosecond transient absorption spectrum exhibited no negative peaks corresponding to the emission of BODIPY or oxasmaragdyrin entity, and some new positive peaks appeared at 548, 611, 850 and 1200 nm or at 503 and 1022 nm, providing direct evidence for the rapid formation of the osm˙+–BODIPY˙− charge-separated complex. For 45, the charge separation process was completed within 10 ps, and the charge recombination process took place within 100 ps. In addition, the solvent polarity had a significant influence on the charge separation and recombination process, which was faster in THF due to its polar nature (Fig. 9e and f). Moreover, 45 exhibited higher kinetics values than 46, which was ascribed to the presence of the longer pyrrolyl linker. The ultrafast photochemical process in the oxasmaragdyrin–BODIPY donor–acceptor systems can potentially be applied in light-energy-harvesting materials, which paves the way to develop artificial photosynthesis systems based on BODIPY.

In 2016, Song and co-workers reported the synthesis of BF2-chelated smaragdyrin for the first time and studied its aromaticity switching.19 As shown in Fig. 10a, treatment of precursors 47 and 48 in a nonpolar solvent such as p-xylene yielded the BF2 complex of [22]smaragdyrin 49 with a yield of 13%. X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated that the central core of 49 adopted an almost planar conformation and that an inner BF2⋯H–N hydrogen bond also existed. Through the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), the electronic conjugation of 49 was determined to be 0.611. Further theoretical calculations indicated that the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) value of 49 was large negative, and the anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD) plots showed a clockwise ring current, proving the aromatic character of this compound. Interestingly, the aromaticity of 49 was easily adjusted under suitable reaction conditions (Fig. 10b). For example, treatment of 49 with MnO2 afforded [20]BF2–smaragdyrin 50, and treatment of 49 with methanesulfonic acid removed the BF2 unit to form [20]smaragdyrin 52. [20]smaragdyrin 52 could be further converted to [22]smaragdyrin 51 by reduction with NaBH4. X-ray diffraction analysis of 50 and 52 indicated the planarity of their structures. In addition, 51 also exhibited large negative NICS values and clockwise ring currents, suggesting 51 had aromatic character. However, the NICS values of 50 and 52 were large positive, and the AICD plots showed anticlockwise ring currents, indicating that these compounds are antiaromatic species. It should be noted that 49 and 52 were stable under ambient conditions, while 50 and 51 were not stable. The instability of 51 could be ascribed to the Coulombic repulsion between the inner pyrrolic NH protons and the inner BF2⋯H–N hydrogen bond in 49, which could enhance its stability. Furthermore, investigations on the photophysical properties of 49–52 were performed (Fig. 10f). 49 and 51 exhibited similar strong absorption peaks at approximately 455 and 478 nm, with weak bands at 600–900 nm, and 49 showed two maximum emission peaks at 727 and 800 nm. In contrast, 50 and 52 exhibited broad absorption bands at 376–600 nm, with long tails in the NIR region, and no emission peaks were observed, further proving the antiaromatic character of these compounds, which was consistent with the molecular calculations. In addition, 49 and 50 could readily form a complex with Cu(II) to afford metalation derivative 53 by treatment with CuCl2. X-ray crystallography revealed that 53 was less planar than 49 and 52, and the UV-vis spectra of 53 exhibited peaks similar to those observed for 52. Electrochemical studies indicated that the HOMO and LOMO energy gaps of 49, 50, 52, and 53 were approximately 1.70, 0.74, 1.30, and 1.00 eV, respectively. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) experiments were conducted to study the excited-state dynamics of these compounds. As shown in Fig. 11, 49 exhibited strong ground-state bleaching signals at approximately 470 nm and displayed a relatively long excited-state lifetime of 5.5 ns, which was ascribed to the decay of the S1 state and the subsequent intersystem crossing (ISC) process. 50, 52 and 53 exhibited intense ground-state absorption in the visible region, and a two-step relaxation was involved, which was due to relaxation to the dark S1 state and subsequent ground-state recovery. Therefore, the aromatic character of the macrocycles had a considerable effect on their excited-state dynamics, which could be helpful for understanding the essence of aromaticity and antiaromaticity when constructing new macrocycles for optical applications.

Sankar et al. reported the synthesis of a Möbius-expanded porphyrinoid and investigated its non-aromatic nature in 2020.20 By an oxidation ring closure reaction with Na2Cr2O7 in TFA, precursor 54 formed dimer 56 with a yield of 6% (Fig. 12). Interestingly, X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the dimer was not generally connected in the 2,5-position of the pyrrole but showed a 2,3-pyrrollic connection. The NMR spectrum of 56 was complex due to the asymmetry of the compound, consistent with its crystal structure. In addition, dimer 56 showed a dome-like conformation, and its pyrrole C pointed outward from the core, forming a Möbius topology. Furthermore, the NICS value of 56 was calculated to be δ = +1.41, and the AICD plots indicated that 56 showed a weak counter-clockwise current flow. By means of the HOMA, the electronic conjugation was determined to be 0.46 compared to that of pyrrole. The above results indicated that macrocycle 56 showed weak electronic conjugation and was non-aromatic, which was probably due to the large twist of the pyrrole C. In addition, macrocycle 56 showed a strong absorption at 608 nm and a broad band at 990 nm and was non-emissive, which was obviously different from precursor 54 (absorption at 690 nm and emission in the NIR region), indicating that the formation of a macrocycle disturbed the electronic conjugation. Further calculations of the molecular orbital energies showed that the LUMO/LUMO+1 and HOMO/HOMO−1 orbitals of 56 were non-degenerate, and the absorption at 608 nm was ascribed to the HOMO−2 to LUMO transition. In conclusion, this research reported the first example of a non-aromatic octaphyrin with Möbius topology, which was contributed to the understanding of aromaticity and antiaromaticity of macrocycles.

Wu et al. reported the synthesis of two antiaromatic BODIPY macrocycles and investigated their antiaromatic character and aggregation-enhanced two-photon absorption (TPA) properties.21 With BODIPY 57 and aryl dialdehydes as starting materials, the BODIPY macrocycles were readily prepared through one-pot Knoevenagel condensation with yields of 4.1 and 1.7% for 58 and 59, respectively (Fig. 13). The relatively low yield for 59 was probably due to the enhanced steric hindrance of the larger sulfur atom. NMR spectra and theoretical calculations showed that these macrocycles had antiaromatic properties. For example, the chemical shifts of the vinyl protons located inside the macrocycles were δ = 14.74 ppm and 13.89 ppm for 58 and 59, respectively, indicating the strong deshielding effect of the macrocycles. In addition, the results of AICD plots indicated that the ring currents of both macrocycles exhibited anticlockwise flows. Further NICS calculations indicated that the NICS values of 58 and 59 at the centre of the macrocycles were +14.0 ppm and +8.8 ppm, respectively, indicating a stronger antiaromatic property of 58. All of the above results strongly supported the antiaromatic characteristics of the macrocycles. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the stepwise oxidation properties of the macrocycles (Fig. 13c). 58 showed two main absorption bands at λ = 470 and 576 nm. After oxidation with 4 equivalents of SbCl5, these two peaks disappeared, accompanied by the emergence of three new peaks at λ = 539, 585 and 1437 nm, corresponding to the radical monocationic species. Further oxidation with SbCl5 led to the disappearance of the peak at λ = 1437 nm and the appearance of a new peak at λ = 953 nm due to the formation of dicationic species. This oxidation process also showed an obvious colour change (from green to magenta and then to blue). In addition, macrocycle 59 exhibited oxidation properties similar to those of 58. Due to the closed packing of the macrocycles in solution, the presence of 3D aromatics was very likely. To test this assumption, transient absorption spectroscopy (TA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 14, for the nonaggregated macrocycle 58 in CH2Cl2, the lifetime of the excited state was measured to be 90 ps according to the decay curves of TA measurements. However, the lifetime of the excited state increased to 130 ps when 58 was aggregated in CH2Cl2/hexane (v:v = 1:1), which could be explained by the induced 3D aromaticity and subsequent decrease in the antiaromatic character in the aggregation state. In addition, the increase in the excited state lifetime was much smaller for macrocycle 59 (from 130 ps in CH2Cl2 to 140 ps in CH2Cl2/hexane). Furthermore, the TPA cross section of macrocycle 58 more than doubled in the aggregation state (at λ = 2100 nm, this value increased from 30 GM in CH2Cl2 to 390 GM in CH2Cl2/hexane). These aggregation-enhanced TPA properties strongly supported the existence of 3D aromaticity resulting from the close packing of the antiaromatic BODIPY macrocycles. This research paves the way for the construction of new BODIPY macrocycles for the investigation of 3D aromaticity and for application in nonlinear optical materials.

Shinokubo and co-workers reported the synthesis of butadiyne-bridged antiaromatic BODIPY macrocycles by transition-metal-mediated reactions.22 As shown in Fig. 15, direct homocoupling of the trimethylsilylethynyl-modified BODIPY units 61 by sila-Glaser coupling with CuCl provided the butadiyne-bridged BODIPY dimer 63 and trimer 62 with yields of 27% and 10%, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that dimer 63 adopted a planar and rectangular structure and that trimer 62 exhibited a triangular structure. NMR spectroscopic analysis and nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) of the BODIPY macrocycles (δ = +18.6 ppm for dimer 63 and δ = +4.0 ppm for trimer 62) revealed their strong antiaromaticity. Further spectral studies showed that dimer 63 exhibited a main absorption peak at 522 nm and a shoulder at 936 nm, while trimer 62 had a main absorption peak at 600 nm and a shoulder at 849 nm (Fig. 16). The long absorption maxima in the near-red region as well as the nonfluorescent features of the BODIPY macrocycles indicated their small HOMO–LUMO gaps. Electrochemical studies showed that the HOMO–LUMO gaps of 63 and 62 were 1.44 and 1.45 eV, respectively, which agreed well with the optical HOMO–LUMO gaps (1.32 and 1.46 eV for 63 and 62). In addition, dimer 63 can be hydrogenated at the butadiyne-bridged moiety by treatment with Pd/C. X-ray crystals revealed the step-like structure of the resultant macrocycle 64, and spectral measurements showed a recuperative bright green fluorescence at 543 nm due to the destruction of π-conjugation, which suggested that the linkage moiety has a large impact on the shape and photophysical properties of the BODIPY macrocycles. This research first reported the synthesis of antiaromatic BODIPY macrocycles through transition-metal-mediated reactions and examined the influence of the linker on the photophysical properties of BODIPY macrocycles, which afforded a new method to prepare BODIPY macrocycles for optical applications.

2.2 BODIPY-based non-conjugated covalent macrocycles
Ravikanth and co-workers reported the synthesis of a series of new trans-homoporphodimethenes and their BODIPY derivates in 2018.23 As shown in Fig. 17a, the trans-homoporphodimethene macrocycles 65–68 contained two pyrrole rings and two thiophene rings connected by two sp2 carbon atoms and two sp3 carbon atoms. X-ray crystallography analysis indicated that homoporphodimethene 65 adopted a highly distorted structure like a boat, which was ascribed to the presence of two sp3 carbon atoms in the linkage moiety (Fig. 17b). The absorption spectrum of 65–68 was almost the same as that of the 1:1 mixture of dipyrromethane and dithienylethene, revealing that macrocycles 65–68 were nonconjugated and that the dithienylethene and dipyrromethene moieties maintained their individual properties and showed no communication (Fig. 17c). In addition, only weak emission from the dithienylethene moiety was observed in the emission spectrum of 65, and no emission from the dipyrrin moiety was observed (Fig. 17d). Electrochemical studies indicated that 65–68 were stable under redox conditions. Moreover, homoporphodimethene 65 can act as a fluorescent turn-on sensor to selectively recognize CN− and show no response to F−, Cl−, Br−, CH3COO−, I−, HSO4−, OH−, HPO4− and so on (Fig. 10e and f). The detection limit of 65 for CN− was calculated to be less than 2 μM. Further study of the mechanism indicated that CN− attacked the meso carbon atom of the dipyrrin moiety by nucleophilic addition to form the complex 65·CN−. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 18, homoporphodimethenes 65 can be converted into BF2-chelated BODIPY macrocycle 69 in 60% yield by treatment with BF3·OEt2. The BODIPY macrocycle 69 exhibited strong absorption at 530 nm and redshifted fluorescence bands at 610 nm compared with those of general BODIPY molecules. This large Stokes shift of the BODIPY macrocycle 69 may be due to the existence of substantial structural reorganization in the photoexcited state.

Furuta et al. reported the synthesis of a series of N-confused calix[n]phyrins and their boron difluoride complexes in 2016.24N-Confused calix[n]phyrin (n = 4, 6, 8) compounds 71a–c were synthesized via a cyclization reaction with yields of 2%, 8%, and 3%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 19a, the pyrrole in the N-confused calix[n]phyrins 71a–c was bridged at the α1 and β2 positions, while the pyrrole in the common calix[n]phyrins 70a–c was connected at the α1 and α2 positions. Treatment of the N-confused calix[n]phyrin 71b and 71c with BF3·OEt2 provided BODIPY macrocycles 72 and 73 with N-confused motifs in yields of 59% and 24%, respectively. The 1H NMR spectra indicated that 72 and 73 had symmetric structures. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that hexamer 72 showed a triangular shape and that octamer 73 exhibited a square box-like shape. It should be noted that the size and shape of the BODIPY macrocycles had an important effect on their photophysical properties. Hexamer 72 exhibited a maximum absorption peak at 515 nm with a shoulder band (>550 nm). Octamer 73 exhibited a maximum absorption peak at 534 nm with a shoulder band up to 650 nm (Fig. 19c). The split in the lowest band may be due to exciton coupling between the BODIPY subunits. In addition, 72 and 73 showed maximum emission peaks at 609 nm and 641 nm, respectively, which suggested a large Stokes shift. The absolute emission quantum yield was also tested and calculated to be 0.19 and 0.42 for 72 and 73, respectively, indicating their excellent luminescent properties. In addition, the fluorescence lifetimes of BODIPY macrocycles 72 and 73 were different. The fluorescence lifetime of hexamer 72 followed single-exponential decay and was 14 ns. The fluorescence lifetime of octamer 73 followed double-exponential decay with lifetimes of 8 ns (60%) and 27 ns (40%) (Fig. 19d), which may result from interconversion due to the relatively flexible box-shaped conformation. Moreover, solvent polarity had a considerable impact on the photophysical properties of 72 and 73. For example, the quantum yield decreased to ≈0.001 and the singlet state lifetime to 35 ps in acetonitrile, verifying that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) altered the excited-state structures of 72 and 73. The solid-state lasing capability of the BODIPY macrocycles was also demonstrated (Fig. 19e and f). For 73, the stimulated-emission spectrum became narrow, and the peak intensity was linear as a function of the pump intensity above the lasing threshold (approximately 80 μJ). This research reports the first examples of N-confused BODIPY macrocycles, which showed excellent photophysical properties, including high quantum yield, long emission lifetime and solid-state lasing capability, paving the way to construct new BODIPY macrocycles that can be applied in bioimaging probes, laser dyes, dye-sensitized solar cells and so on.

Burgess et al. reported the synthesis of oligoethylene glycol-substituted aza-BODIPY dyes and investigated their cell imaging behaviours.25 As shown in Fig. 20, precursors 74 and 75 were condensed with ammonium acetate and subsequently treated with BF3·OEt2 to provide two cyclic glycol-substituted aza-BODIPY dyes with yields of 14% and 3% for 76 and 77, respectively. In addition, two acyclic aza-BODIPY dyes 78 and 79 were used as controls. It should be noted that even though the hydrophilic ethylene glycol chain was attached to the aza-BODIPY core, the resultant molecules were not able to dissolve in water. When treated with metal salts such as NaCl and KCl, dyes 76 and 77 showed no complexation. Further theoretical calculations indicated that 76 was too small to bind Na+, and the unsuitable alignment of oxygen atoms in 77 also resulted in low affinity for Na+. The spectroscopic data indicated that the four dyes had similar absorption and emission maxima, except that 77 had a larger molar absorption coefficient (Fig. 21a). In addition, the measured emission quantum yields of the four dyes were found to be similar (ΦF = 0.26–0.29). Then, the dyes were incubated with various cells, such as WEHI-13VAR fibroblast cells, human liver cancer HepG2 cells and human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells, and the results indicated that all the dyes were located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 21b). The ER-targeting effect could be ascribed to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the oligoethylene glycol substituents. These near-red emissive dyes were complementary to the commercial ER probe (blue and green emission) and could be applied to ER staining.

In 2015, Tsuda et al. reported the synthesis of an azobenzene-containing BODIPY macrocycle and studied its photoisomerization behaviour.26 The tetrapyrrolic macrocycle 82 was synthesized through cyclization of the precursor 80 with 81 in 5% yield. As shown in Fig. 22, X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated that the complex 82 adopted a V-shaped conformation. The dipyrromethene moiety was planar, and the azobenzene group was very twisted. Upon irradiation with UV light, a series of new peaks appeared in the 1H NMR spectrum of macrocycle 82, corresponding to the cis-isomer of the macrocycle. Through integration, the ratio of trans- to cis-isomers in the photostationary state was determined to be 6:4. Additionally, the splitting of the gem-dimethyl protons in the 1H NMR spectrum of 82 revealed that the rotation of this group, which was free before UV irradiation, had become restricted. Additional absorption spectra indicated that upon UV irradiation, the intensity of the absorption peaks at λ = 305 and 461 nm decreased slightly, accompanied by a blueshift to 298 nm, which was due to the photoisomerization of the azobenzene group. The small absorption change could be ascribed to the steric hindrance of the macrocyclic ring. In addition, this trans–cis photoisomerization could occur reversibly at room temperature or upon irradiation with visible light. The BODIPY-containing macrocycle 84 was readily obtained by treating 82 with BF3·OEt2 with a yield of 76%. The BODIPY macrocycle 84 had a photochromic property similar to that of 82 with a higher photoconversion efficiency. Due to the presence of the BODIPY group, 84 exhibited a weak emission at λ = 642 nm, and the fluorescence quantum yield was measured to be 0.02 in ethanol. Upon UV irradiation, the fluorescence intensity decreased slightly. In addition, this photochromic reaction was reversible at room temperature, and the half-life at 25 °C in toluene was calculated to be 14 h. The activation energy was estimated to be Ea = 87.1 kJ mol−1 by using the Van’t Hoff equation, and this value was smaller than that of tetrapyrrolic macrocycle 82, indicating its decreased thermal stability. In addition, BODIPY macrocycle 84 can potentially be applied in the construction of light-driven molecular machines.

Xie and co-workers reported the synthesis of carbohydrate-containing BODIPY macrocycles (Fig. 23a).27 The two terminals of the BODIPY units were linked by alkynyl and azido units, followed by a copper-catalysed macrocyclization reaction, providing BODIPY macrocycle 86 with 61% isolated yield. The BODIPY macrocycle 86 could be further converted into its BF(OMe) 90 and BF(OMe)291 derivative through treatment with BCl3 with yields of 31% and 32%, respectively. Interestingly, these carbohydrate-containing BODIPY macrocycles 86–91 maintained the excellent photophysical properties of BODIPY units, including a large molar absorption coefficient and high quantum yield (ΦF = 0.71) (Fig. 23d). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 23b and c, ion recognition studies indicated that BODIPY macrocycle 86 can recognize both anions (F−, CN−) and cations (Cu2+, Fe3+). The addition of F−, CN−, Cu2+ and Fe3+ induced quenching of the emission of 86. Mechanistic studies revealed the sensing of anions via the decomposition of the BODIPY moieties. However, for the recognition of Cu2+ and Fe3+, the triazole ring and carbonyl groups, respectively, of 86 played an important role compared with the open-chain analogues. This research integrated the biomolecule sugar and emissive BODIPY unit into one macrocycle and achieved the recognition of anions and cations, which laid the foundation for the development of BODIPY-modified biomacromolecules for various biological applications.

Bröring and co-workers synthesized a series of acyclic and cyclic dithioaryl-linked BODIPY compounds 92–98 by nucleophilic substitution reactions in 2016 (Fig. 24).2892–98 showed poor solubility in common solvents such as CH2Cl2, MeOH, DMF and DMSO, indicating the possible formation of H-type aggregates. The X-ray crystal structure indicated that linear BODIPY dimers 94 and 95 adopted a stretched-out conformation with a maximum distance between the two BODIPY subunits, which involved almost no communication between the dimers (Fig. 24b). However, cyclic BODIPY dimer 97 adopted a 1,3-alternate saddle conformation. The intradimeric distance between the two BODIPY subunits was 4.6003(1) Å, which indicated their excitonic coupling, and the two BODIPY subunits formed H-type dimers in the macrocycle. Further spectrographic measurements confirmed this assumption. The linear BODIPY dimers 92 exhibited an absorption band at 565 nm, accompanied by a shoulder at the high-energy band. The shoulder resulted from the weak excitonic coupling of BODIPY subunits. Dimers 94 and 96, with longer spacers, showed maximum absorption peaks at 553 nm and 541 nm, respectively, similar to the general BODIPY dyes (at 545 nm). In addition, the emission spectra of 92–96 all showed very small Stokes shifts, and the quantum yield was determined to be 33–44% in toluene. However, the absorption of cyclic BODIPY dimers 97 exhibited an intense band at 539.0 nm and a relatively weak band at 574.5 nm. This 35.5 nm splitting provided tight packing of the BODIPY subunits and the formation of H-type aggregates (Fig. 25). Otherwise, the quantum yield of 97 was <0.01% in both CH2Cl2 and toluene, in agreement with the above result. Moreover, the Kasha model can be used to predict the absorption of all acyclic and cyclic BODIPY dimers. The calculated Davydov splitting for cyclic BODIPY dimers 97 was 47 nm, which differed from the measured value of 35.5 nm, probably due to the inaccuracy of the references used and conformation difference in the solution and crystal state. In any case, this research showed the feasibility of the Kasha model for predicting Davydov splitting within BODIPY macrocycles, which played an important role in studying the self-assembly of chromophores.

Recently, Sara and co-workers reported the synthesis of two new cyclic BF2 arrays of calix[8]- and calix[16]phyrin with strong NIR absorption and investigated their excitonic coupling behaviour.29 As shown in Fig. 26, by condensation of precursor 99 with pentafluorobenzaldehyde, cyclic BODIPY dimer 100 and tetramer 101 were obtained with yields of 5% and 32%, respectively. The 19F NMR spectra of the BF2 subunits of 100 exhibited two signals at −138.1 and −141.5 ppm, respectively, suggesting the asymmetry of the complex. For 101, its 19F NMR showed a broad signal at −140.3 ppm, indicating the symmetry of the complex in solution. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that dimer 100 adopted a gable-like conformation and that tetramer 101 had a box-like structure. In addition, due to its relatively larger macrocyclic framework, 101 showed a larger distance between the BODIPY subunits than 100 (for 101, this distance is 11.429 Å; for 100, it is 7.898 Å), which had a considerable effect on the photophysical properties of the macrocycles. For example, dimer 100 showed a strong absorption peak at 696 nm and two weak bands at 735 nm and 806 nm (Fig. 26c). Tetramer 101 exhibited three absorption peaks at 697 nm, 737 nm, and 776 nm. It should be noted that the molar absorption coefficient of 101 (4.82 × 105 m−1 cm−1) is 2.35 times that of 99 (2.05 × 105 m−1 cm−1) and 1.31 times that of 100 (3.67 × 105 m−1 cm−1) at the maximum absorption wavelength, and 101 showed enhanced light absorption from 250 to 800 nm (almost panchromatic absorption) compared to 99, indicating its potential for light harvesting. Moreover, dimer 100 showed an emission maximum at 840 nm with an extremely low quantum yield (ΦF = 0.003), which was largely decreased compared to that of precursor 99 (ΦF = 0.246), revealing that the lowest electronic state was forbidden. The emission maximum of 101 was located at 793 nm, and the quantum yield was determined to be 0.057, which is larger than that of 100 due to the imperfect alignment of the transition dipole moments of the BODIPY units, indicating that the macrocyclic framework had a substantial influence on the photophysical properties of the macrocycles. Further excitonic coupling calculations revealed that dimer 100 showed two exciton-coupled states (one allowed and one forbidden), and the separation energy was determined to be 1900 cm−1, which was consistent with the result from the experimental spectrum (1960 cm−1). Tetramer 101 showed four exciton-coupled states (three allowed and one forbidden), and the calculated difference between the highest and lowest exciton-coupled states (900 cm−1) was smaller than the experimental result (1460 cm−1), suggesting that the actual molecular structure in solution was different from the optimized result (in the optimized result, the four transition dipole moments were fully cancelled), consistent with its moderate quantum yield in solution. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetimes of 99–101 were determined to be 3.63, 3.04, and 5.04 ns, respectively. The radiative rates were also calculated, and 100 and 101 exhibited smaller rates (0.10 × 107 s−1 and 1.13 × 107 s−1 for 100 and 101, respectively) than 99 (6.78 × 107 s−1). In addition, the results of TA measurements revealed that 100 and 101 exhibited obvious ground-state bleaching signals, indicating that the slow structural relaxation process was predominant in their excited-state dynamics (Fig. 26e). On the other hand, the ground-state bleaching signals of 99, 100 and 101 were not the same, probably due to the relatively rigid macrocyclic frameworks of 100 and 101 compared to that of 99. In conclusion, this research reported two new BODIPY macrocycles with strong NIR absorption, and the excitonic coupling behaviour was studied in detail, which laid the foundation for the construction of cyclic multi-chromophoric systems for light harvesting.

3. BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles
For the noncovalent BODIPY macrocycles, we introduced some metal-coordinated BODIPY macrocycles and a hydrogen-bonded BODIPY macrocycle (Scheme 2). Since coordination-driven self-assembly has been a powerful tool to fabricate various 2D and 3D supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with well-defined sizes and shapes,30,31 the introduction of BODIPY units into various metal-coordinated macrocycles could endow metallacycles with high absorption coefficients and excellent luminescent properties, which can further promote their applications in light-harvesting antennas, bioimaging and PDT.

Pistolis and co-workers reported the first example of a BODIPY-based metal-coordinated macrocycle in 2010.32 As shown in Fig. 27, substituting the fluorine atoms of BODIPY with 4-ethynylpyridine (–CC-Py) led to a new BODIPY-containing pyridine unit 103, in which the angle between the two pyridines was 109.5°. Following coordination with a 90° Pt acceptor Pt(dppp)(OTf)2, the rhombic BODIPY macrocycle 104 was obtained. The macrocycle was well characterized by 1H, 31P, and 13C multinuclear NMR and ESI-MS spectra. Its X-ray crystal structure indicated a planar conformation, and the two BODIPY subunits were almost perpendicular to the rhombic plane. It should be noted that macrocycle 104 exhibited excellent photophysical properties, including a large molar extinction coefficient (εmax ∼ 78000 M−1 cm−1) and brilliant green fluorescence with an extremely high quantum yield (ΦF = 0.86), which overcome the problem that metal coordination usually quenches the emission of chromophores due to the heavy-atom effect or the formation of charge-transfer states. In addition, macrocycle 104 showed a fluorescence lifetime of τ = 6.9 ns and high fluorescence anisotropy (r ≈ 0.37). Further fluorescence polarization spectroscopy studies showed that loss of fluorescence polarization was not observed for 104, indicating that the structure of 104 was maintained in the solution state as well as in the solid state. Moreover, the molecular volume of 104 was calculated to be ∼1690 Å3 in Cl2HCCHCl2 by using the spherical rotor anisotropy model, which was consistent with the molecular volume from the X-ray crystal structure. This research reported the first example of a highly emissive BODIPY-based metal-coordinated macrocycle, which created a route for developing fluorescent SCCs with applications in supramolecular luminescent materials and light harvesting.

In 2012, Pistolis and co-workers reported the synthesis of a hexagonal BODIPY macrocycle.33 As shown in Fig. 28, replacing the fluorine atom of the general BODIPY unit with the –CC–Ph–Pt+ moiety provided the BODIPY-functional diplatinum acceptor 107. Diplatinum acceptor 107 exhibited excellent fluorescent properties with a quantum yield of up to 0.87 even though the Pt atoms bound directly to the BODIPY unit. The X-ray crystal structure revealed that the Pt–B–Pt angle in the diplatinum precursor 106 was 118°. A mixture of 107 with 4,4′-bipyridine afforded the resultant hexagonal BODIPY macrocycle 108. Macrocycle 108 was well characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectra as well as ESI-MS spectra. It should be noted that 108 also showed brilliant fluorescence with a quantum yield of up to 0.88. Time-resolved fluorescence depolarization indicated that the molecular volume of the rotating entity was ≈10.500 Å3, corresponding to the simulated structure of 108 (10.000 Å3). The fluorescence anisotropy of 108 was also measured, and it was determined to be 0.36 ± 0.05 in frozen 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, similar to that of the single BODIPY unit (0.37 ± 0.05), indicating the high degree of orientation of the chromophore dipoles in 108. Thus, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was involved in 108. Furthermore, the rate constant of excitation energy transfer was calculated to be keet = 4.8 × 1011 s−1, which was approximately 3000 times faster than the deactivation rate of the BODIPY subunit, revealing ultrafast energy hopping between neighbouring chromophores. The above result indicated that the cyclic BODIPY array 108 may be an ideal platform to temporarily store incident light energy. Further scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies indicated that BODIPY macrocycle 108 formed tubular assemblies on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (Fig. 28c). This research demonstrates that fluorescent SCCs are a good platform for light harvesting.

Pistolis and co-workers reported the synthesis of a rhombic BODIPY macrocycle and investigated its host–guest behaviour.34 As shown in Fig. 29, stirring BODIPY-based diplatinum acceptor 107 and BODIPY-based dipyridine donor 109 in CHCl3 afforded the rhombic macrocycle 110 containing four BODIPY subunits. Macrocycle 110 was well characterized by 1D and by 2D NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. The NMR spectrum and steady-state absorption spectrum verified the existence of 1,3,6,8-tetrasulfopyrene in the cavitand of the macrocycle 110. Further X-ray crystallographic analysis demonstrated the SO3−⋯Pt+ pairwise electrostatic interactions in the host–guest complex 111 (Fig. 29b). The UV-vis and fluorescence spectra indicated that the absorption of macrocycle 110 was the superposition of the two BODIPY subunits and that guest incorporation had no influence on the absorption of 110. In addition, excitation of the guest also excited the host 110, suggesting the occurrence of guest-to-host energy transfer. Further femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectrum of the host alone indicated excitation energy transfer between the BODIPY subunits (Fig. 29c). In addition, when excitation of the host–guest complex 111 occurred at 380 nm, due to the existence of FRET from the guest to the host, both intra-host and guest–host excitation energy transfer took place. This novel class of unidirectional energy transfer systems can act as new light-harvesting antenna models.

In 2017, Pistolis and co-workers reported the synthesis of a series of Pt-coordinated BODIPY macrocycles and investigated their photophysical properties.35 As shown in Fig. 30, the rhombic, tetragonal and hexagonal BODIPY macrocycles 104, 113 and 114, respectively, were obtained through coordination-driven self-assembly. The angel of the two pyridines in 103 and two di-Pt moieties in 107 was about 109.5° and readily moved close to the typical 90° and 120° through bending of the sp3 hybridized boron arms at suitable conditions, which was essential for the formation of tetragonal and hexagonal macrocycle, respectively, according to the principle of directional bonding.36 Therefore, even though tetragon 113 and hexagon 114 had the same synthetic building blocks 103 and 107, they were provided at different temperatures (ambient and low temperature (−80 °C), respectively). The formation of hexagonal macrocycle 114 may be due to a lack of sufficient energy to bend the angle of BODIPY subunits at low temperature, which is essential for the formation of the entropically favoured tetragonal macrocycle 113. The structures of the three macrocycles were well characterized by NMR and ESI-MS spectra. The steady-state absorption of the macrocycles was the sum of the two building blocks, and the fluorescence spectrum was identical to the BODIPY subunits. The consistent fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetime of the macrocycles also provided evidence that there were no significant ground-state electronic interactions between the BODIPY dipoles. Furthermore, time-dependent fluorescence anisotropy was used to investigate the dynamics of energy transfer and subtle structural distortions of the macrocycles in the solution state (Fig. 26c). Integrating the results of the experiment and theoretical simulations showed that the fluorescence anisotropy transients of the small rhombic macrocycle 104 were static, which indicated that the two BODIPY dipoles were almost perfectly parallel. The above result suggested a lack of structural distortion in rhombic macrocycle 104, and its structure in solution was consistent with that in the crystal state. Compared to the rhomboid, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of tetragon 113 and hexagon 114 exhibited a similar distinct decay, which indicated a similar structural distortion of the two macrocycles. In addition, the intramolecular energy hopping rates of tetragon 113 and hexagon 114 were kept the same, and the time needed to reach excited-state equilibrium depended on the size of the macrocycle (the time was longer in hexagon 114). This research provided a new view of the structure of metal-coordinated BODIPY macrocycles and afforded a novel method to investigate the subtle structural distortions of SCCs in the solution state.

In 2016, Lee et al. reported the construction of the first examples of BODIPY-based Ru(II) and Ir(III) metalla-rectangles and studied their cellular localization and anticancer activities.37 Metalla-rectangles 117–120 were easily synthesized by treating the dinuclear p-cymene complexes (p-cymRu)2(L)Cl2 or (Cp*Ir)2(L)Cl2 with the linear BODIPY ligand. As shown in Fig. 31, the X-ray crystal structures of 118 and 120 verified their rectangle-shaped conformations. The molecular structure of the rectangle was twisted to 99°, which was uncommon in the Ru-based metal complexes. Fluorescence spectral experiments indicated that the metalla-rectangles could maintain the emission property of the BODIPY ligand. After testing their stabilities in biological media, their anticancer activities against cervical (HeLa), breast (MCF-7), lung (A549) and brain (U87) cancer cells were investigated (Fig. 31c). Taking the side effects of the metal-based drugs into consideration, the effect of the metalla-rectangles on normal fibroblast cells (WI-38) was also studied. The results indicated that metalla-rectangles 117 and 119 could selectively kill MCF-7 and that 118 and 120 could selectively kill U87, demonstrating their anticancer potential. Further cell cycle analysis revealed that the selective antiproliferative activity may arise from higher oxidative stress in cancer cells than in normal cells and from the high oxidizing abilities of the metalla-rectangles. Due to the presence of the green emissive BODIPY fluorophore, the cellular localization of the metalla-rectangles 117–120 was investigated using confocal microscopy, which indicated that 117 was mainly located in the nucleus in HeLa cells and 118–120 were predominantly located in the cytoplasm. The reason was likely because 117 had a lower molecular weight, so it showed the highest anticancer activity. The interaction between the metalla-rectangles and DNA was studied by UV spectroscopy, and the hyperchromicity effect probably resulted from electrostatic interactions. In this research, novel Ru(II) and Ir(III) BODIPY macrocycles were constructed through self-assembly of the BODIPY ligand and Ru or Ir metal centre. The resultant macrocycles exhibited selective anticancer activity and could be visualized by taking advantage of the highly emissive BODIPY fluorophore, which provided a new view of Ru- and Ir-based metal drugs. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 32a, Lee et al. designed and constructed thiophene-based BODIPY Ru(II) rectangles 123–126.38 The introduction of a thiophene group into the BODIPY ligand endowed the metalla-rectangles with higher selective anticancer activity due to the disruption of the redox balance in cancer cells induced by the potent antioxidant ability of the thiophene-containing compounds. In addition, in 2018, Lee et al. reported the synthesis of two Ir(III) metalla-rectangles 127 and 128 incorporating the 4-ethynylpyridine-functionalized BODIPY ligand, which exhibited excellent dose-dependent interactions with biomolecules such as DNA and protein (Fig. 32b).39 Apart from the variation in the structure of the BODIPY ligand, Lee et al. also designed and synthesized two new Ir(III) metalla-rectangles, 129 and 130, containing a new benzimidazole-based Ir ligand (Fig. 32c and d). The metalla-rectangles showed enhanced emission compared to the BODIPY ligand and high selectivity against cancer cells.40

In 2017, Lee et al. reported the synthesis of palladium triangular/square macrocycles containing BODIPY ligand, and the behaviours in biological systems were studied (Fig. 33).41 The self-assembly of the BODIPY ligand with the Pd complex was performed in CH2Cl2 at room temperature, which afforded two different species (triangle and square) in less polar solvents, such as CH2Cl2 and CHCl3, but only triangular macrocycles in polar solvents, such as acetone or DMSO. NMR and ESI-MS results strongly supported the above structural conversion. Additionally, the single-crystal structure of the triangular macrocycle 132 was obtained, which provided direct evidence of the triangular conformation (Fig. 33b). Furthermore, the absorption and emission spectra of macrocycles 131–134 were measured, and the results showed no apparent changes compared to the BODIPY ligands. In addition, as shown in Fig. 34, the antiproliferative activities of 131–134 were investigated, and the macrocycles exhibited lower IC50 values against U87 cancer cells than normal lung fibroblast WI38 cells. Additionally, some of the macrocycles, 131, 132 and 133, showed lower IC50 values than the benchmark metal-based chemotherapy drug cisplatin, which suggested their selective anticancer potential. To further investigate the route of action of drugs inside the cell, confocal microscopy studies were performed. The results showed that macrocycles 131–134 were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and that macrocycles 132 and 133 primarily formed nanoaggregates. It should be noted that macrocycle 134 was mostly located near the cell membrane, suggesting high affinity for the cell membrane. In addition, spectroscopic studies demonstrated that macrocycles 131–134 could strongly bind with DNA and protein. This research reports the first example of a Pd-coordinated BODIPY macrocycle, and the investigation of the resultant macrocycles afforded a new view into Pd-based SCCs.

Lee et al. reported the synthesis of heterometallic BODIPY-based molecular squares and investigated their biological activities in 2019.42 As shown in Fig. 35, treating the pyridine-substituted BODIPY ligands with the Pd or Pt iron triflate complex afforded heterometallic Pd–Fe or Pt–Fe BODIPY macrocycles 139–142. All the macrocycles were well characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, elemental analysis and UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. The UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of BODIPY macrocycles 139–142 were almost identical to those of the BODIPY ligands. Furthermore, the biological activities of the macrocycles were studied in vitro, and the results indicated that they showed higher cytotoxicity towards cancer cells but lower cytotoxicity towards normal cells, suggesting their selective anticancer ability. Flow cytometry experiments indicated that macrocycles 139 and 140 induced cytotoxicity through apoptosis, but macrocycles 141 and 142 induced cell death through necrosis. Further cell imaging studies showed that 139–142 were mostly located in the cytoplasm and were not able to penetrate the nuclear membrane.

Cook, Huang, and Yu et al. reported the synthesis of two triangular BODIPY macrocycles 145 and 146 and investigated their application in combined PDT and chemotherapy.43 The pyridine-substituted BODIPY precursor 138 was synthesized through Sonogashira coupling. As shown in Fig. 36, the treatment of BODIPY-based pyridine donor 138 with two different Pt(II) acceptors 143 and 144 resulted in two triangular BODIPY macrocycles 145 and 146, respectively. Macrocycles 145 and 146 were well characterized by NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. After successful construction of the BODIPY macrocycles, studies on their photophysical properties were performed. The macrocycles both showed a strong absorption peak at approximately 556 nm and an emission peak at approximately 577 nm. Even though the Pt atom was directly linked to the BODIPY fluorophore, macrocycles 145 and 146 exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields in various solvents. Encouraged by the excellent photophysical properties, the authors further investigated their applications in cell imaging and in vitro anticancer treatment (Fig. 36b and 37). Considering the solubility and biocompatibility in water, the macrocycles formed nanoparticles first through nanoaggregates. DLS and TEM indicated that the spherical nanoparticles had a diameter of approximately 40 nm, which could allow entry into tumour cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FCM) studies indicated that the nanoparticles showed a faster uptake rate and higher intracellular accumulation than the free BODIPY ligand 138 due to the positive charges of the nanoparticles, which promoted cellular internalization. A 3-(4′,5′-dimethylthiazol-2′-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess the dark cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity of the nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 37, under irradiation, 145 and 146 generated singlet oxygen efficiently from the BODIPY photosensitizer. For example, when treated with the nanoparticles, HeLa cells showed obvious green fluorescence from DCF-DA, a singlet oxygen indicator. Then, combined PDT and chemotherapy in the macrocycles showed an excellent HeLa cell-killing effect (the IC50 values of 145 and 146 were 0.95 and 0.37 μM, respectively), and the combination indexes (CI) were determined to be 0.56 and 0.48, respectively. Furthermore, the nanoparticles also showed superior anticancer efficacy against drug-resistant A2780 cells, which verified that SCCs can potentially act as a promising platform for cancer therapy.

In 2020, Zhao and Liu et al. reported the platinum(II)–acetylide-based BODIPY macrocycles 151–153 and investigated their antitumor behaviour.44 As shown in Fig. 38, treatment of the alkynyl-containing aza-BODIPY precursors 148–150 with the Pt-containing compound 147 provided three aza-BODIPY-containing macrocycles 151–153 through Pt–acetylide coordination. The macrocycles 151–153 were well characterized with 1H NMR, 31P NMR, 19F NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS and high-resolution transition electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Theoretical simulations indicated that 151–153 adopted a planar triangular conformation and AA stacking. As shown in Fig. 39a, studies on the photophysical properties of 151–153 revealed that these macrocycles exhibited excellent photophysical properties such as NIR absorption (maximum absorption peaks at 735, 775 and 760 nm in CHCl3 for 151, 152, and 153, respectively), large molar extinction coefficient (about 70000 L mol−1 cm−1) and NIR emission (maximal emission peaks at 808, 865 and 855 nm, respectively for 151, 152, and 153, respectively). In addition, the quantum yields of 151–153 were calculated to be 0.0457, 0.0889, and 0.0118, respectively, which were lower than their corresponding precursors 148–150, indicating the fluorescence was quenched due to the heavy atom effect of Pt. Furthermore, 151–153 were encapsulated into amphiphilic polymers mPEG–DSPE5000 to investigate their biological applications. TEM and DLS experiments indicated the nanoparticles showed a diameter of about 20–30 nm. Moreover, the nanoparticles showed a good photostability and they were also stable in acidic environment and physiological conditions (PBS containing 10% FBS), which was favourable for cancer phototherapy. Furthermore, studies on the photodynamic and photothermal properties of 151–153-NPs were performed (Fig. 39). The results indicated that both nanoparticles could generate singlet oxygen efficiently and 152-NPs showed the lowest singlet oxygen generation ability probably due to its inherent photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Besides, both nanoparticles exhibited obvious temperature elevation under irradiation and 153-NPs showed the highest photothermal conversion efficiency of 31.1%. It should be noted that the precursors 148–150 showed almost no singlet oxygen generation and relatively low temperature elevation under irradiation. The enhanced singlet oxygen generation ability and photothermal conversion efficiency of 151–153-NPs probably resulted from the enhanced intersystem crossing and subsequent nonradiative decay due to the strong spin–orbit coupling effect of Pt. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate their cancer phototherapy. MTT experiments indicated 151–153-NPs showed a low dark cytotoxicity and they could cause obvious death of HeLa cells under irradiation due to the generation of singlet oxygen and hyperthermia. In addition, flow cytometry experiments indicated 151–153-NPs mainly caused late cell apoptosis by synergistic PDT and PTT and 153-NPs showed the strongest antitumor activity. Further in vivo experiments manifested that the tumors of mouse treated with 153-NPs were almost fully eliminated after secondary treatment, confirming 153-NPs as a promising phototherapy agent for cancer therapy. In conclusion, this research reported the first examples of Pt–acetylide-coordinated macrocycles with strong NIR absorption and the macrocycles showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation ability and photothermal conversion efficiency due to the induction of Pt, which could further be applicated in tumor ablation efficiently, affording a guideline for constructing BODIPY-based supramolecular materials for biological applications.

Baudron and Hosseini et al. reported the construction of Ag-coordinated BODIPY macrocycles and studied the influence of solvent and anion effects on the formation of networks (Fig. 40).45 In contrast to the meso-functionalized BODIPY ligands, the replacement at the 3,5-position provided the cyan-functionalized BODIPY precursor 154, which was readily obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The X-ray crystal structure indicated that ligand 154 had a V-shaped structure. As shown in Fig. 40a, upon treatment with different Ag salts, four [2+2] macrocycles 155–158 with different counter ions were obtained. For compounds 155 and 156, obtained with ClO4− and BF4−, respectively, the macrocycles were packed into extended infinite networks resulting from the Ag–π interaction. The metal centre of Ag was occupied by a chloride atom in ClO4− or CHCl3. For compounds 157 and 158, formed with AsF6− (crystallization from different solvents), the macrocycles were connected by the solvents to result in dimers. Further spectrographic experiments indicated that BODIPY ligand 154 and the macrocycles 155–158 were highly emissive. This research extended the coordination system to Ag, and the further self-assembly of the macrocycles into infinite networks or dimers in the solid state through weak interaction was impressive.

As B can form coordination bonds with N or O, B was also used to construct non-covalent BODIPY-based macrocycles. In 2008, Nabeshima and co-workers reported the construction of a series of cyclic boron–dipyrrin complexes and investigated their interaction with alkali metal ions.46 As shown in Fig. 41, cyclic boron–dipyrrin complexes 160, 161, and 162 were obtained through the reaction of 159 with BCl3 in yields of 2%, 5%, and 0.3%, respectively. Macrocycles 160–162 were well characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS and NMR spectroscopy. X-ray crystallography analysis indicated that trimer 160 adopted a triangular-prism structure and that tetramer 161 showed a square-prism structure. Due to the cavity of 160 was surrounded by catecholate oxygens and electron-rich pyrrolic planes, the host–guest behaviour of 160 with alkali metal ions was studied. The results indicated that there was no interaction between 160 and Na+ because the radius of Na+ (0.97 Å) was smaller than that of the cavity of 160 (1.4 Å). Moreover, 1H NMR titration experiments indicated that 160 could form a 1:1 complex with K+, Rb+, and Cs+, and further experiments revealed the binding constants were calculated to be (1.5 ± 0.6) × 104 M−1, 5.7 × 104 M−1, and 5.5 × 106 M−1, respectively. On the basis of the above strategy, Maeda et al. reported the synthesis of a series of BODIPY-based macrocycles bridged by O–B–O moieties in 2013.47 Treatment of the BODIPY oligomers with bisdiol afforded macrocycles 163a–168a in 20–80% yield. Molecular simulations indicated that 165a and 167a adopted box-like and ladder conformations, respectively (Fig. 42). 164a, 166a, and 168a showed maximum absorption peaks at 501, 525 and 541 nm, respectively, with low quantum yields up to 0.002. The low quantum yields were probably due to their electronic states. In addition, by treatment of BODIPY oligomers with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene, 163b, 164b, 166b, and 168b were obtained with yields of 3–82%. Molecular simulations indicated that 165b and 167b adopted triangular-prism conformations. Further investigations of the photophysical properties indicated that 164b, 166b, and 168b showed maximum absorption peaks at 503, 527 and 542 nm, respectively, with quantum yields of 0.02. In conclusion, these two studies tactfully made use of the B– N and B–O coordination bonds to prepare cyclic BODIPY arrays, affording a new method to construct fluorescent macrocycles for various applications.

González-Rodríguez reported the synthesis of hydrogen-bonded BODIPY macrocycles and investigated their self-assembly and dissociation behaviours.48 As shown in Fig. 43, the chromophore-dinucleoside monomers 169–172 self-assembled into cyclic tetramers through Watson–Crick H-bonding pairs (G–C or A–U). The emission and CD spectra indicated that the macrocycles underwent concentration-dependent self-assembly. At low concentrations, the macrocycles tend to dissociate into monomers, whereas at high concentrations, the macrocycles retained the cyclic structure. The dissociation concentration was different depending on the base pairs and was lower for G–C, which indicated its higher stability. Furthermore, competition experiments by the addition of the FRET-dye-labelled dinucleoside revealed that the competitor acceptor was bonded to the periphery of both the cyclic tetramer and the monomer sides. This article describes a new method to investigate the exchange kinetics in hydrogen-bonded macrocycles by utilizing FRET.

4. Conclusions
During recent decades, a variety of BODIPY-based macrocycles, including covalent and noncovalent macrocycles, have been investigated. For the BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles, the BODIPY subunits were linked by various motifs, and the linkage showed a large impact on the photophysical and photochemical properties of the resultant macrocycles. Although covalent synthetic protocols are popular for the synthesis of such kinds of macrocycles, they may have some disadvantages, such as time-consuming synthetic procedures and unsatisfactory yields. Unlike the BODIPY-based covalent macrocycles prepared through stepwise covalent synthetic protocols, the BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles were synthesized in a straightforward manner, and the yields were nearly quantitative. Based on our systematic investigation and unpublished results, although the reported BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles retained excellent photophysical properties, such as a strong molar absorption coefficient and high quantum yield, the heavy-atom effect arising from the Pt(II)-containing building block for the construction of BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles sometimes induces a significant increase in the amount of intersystem crossing (ISC) due to spin–orbit coupling, which leads to obvious fluorescence quenching of the resultant BODIPY-based macrocycles. Moreover, although the dynamic nature of metal–ligand bonds and hydrogen bonds endows the formation of noncovalent macrocycles with nearly quantitative yields, it also sometimes leads to instability of the obtained macrocycles.
Therefore, in our opinion, four important aspects should be considered in the future development of BODIPY-based macrocycles. First, with the aim of diversifying biological applications, stable, biocompatible, and water-soluble BODIPY-based macrocycles, especially covalent macrocycles, should be designed and prepared. Second, to prepare BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles with high fluorescence quantum yields, the heavy-atom effect arising from the Pt(II)-containing building block needs to be avoided. According to our most recent reports, the construction of BODIPY-containing building blocks with photoinduced electron transfer (PET) properties may be a feasible approach.49 Third, the preparation of BODIPY-based noncovalent macrocycles with improved stability is particularly necessary. The confined self-assembly of functional building blocks in the confined environment, such as the inner cavities of mesoporous carbon or mesoporous silicon, to generate isolated noncovalent macrocycles would be an alternative approach to address this issue.50 Moreover, although metal coordination interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions have been applied to fabricate BODIPY-based macrocycles, other non-covalent interactions such as π–π interactions and host–guest interactions have never been used in the preparation of these macrocycles. A synergetic strategy based on two types of non-covalent interactions may be beneficial to the construction of stimuli-responsive “smart” BODIPY-based macrocycles. In summary, considering the aesthetic structures and widespread applications of BODIPY-based macrocycles, there is no doubt that such macrocycles will attract increasing attention and play increasingly important roles in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, and biological science in the coming decades.
