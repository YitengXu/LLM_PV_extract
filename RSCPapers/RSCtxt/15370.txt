In this study, waste dry cell batteries were used as the source of graphite (G) to synthesize graphene oxide (GO) by the electrochemical exfoliation method. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized from electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) using the modified Hummers’ method. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and conductivity meter were used to characterize G, GO, and rGO. The HTL thin film of Glass/ITO, Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS, Glass/ITO/rGO, Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO surface morphologies were assessed for roughness using atomic force microscopy. The active layer was spin-coated from the blend solution of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F. The HTL of the OSCs fabricated from PEDOT:PSS and the composite PEDOT:PSS:rGO achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.07–6.55%, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.61% to 18.42 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 42–48%, which was consistent with the enhanced hole mobility of 1.67 × 10−5 to 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. These findings indicate that the solution-processed PEDOT:PSS:rGO hole transport material is a promising interfacial material for use in OSCs.
Introduction
Energy is a basic need for the economic and social development of any country.1 However, it is one of the main challenges of the 21st century to devise sustainable solutions to address the energy demands of the world by providing novel and clean technologies. “Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy” has been formulated by the United Nations as Sustainable Development Goal 7.2 The limited supply of non-renewable energy sources (oil, coal, and gas), coupled with their strong environmental impact, such as high emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, SO2) from them, call for the urgent exploration of clean and sustainable energy sources to cope with the great global demand of energy in the near future.3,4 Among the different renewable energy sources, solar energy provides the most viable long-term solution because it is abundant, unlimited, and eco-friendly.5 Therefore, exploring solar energy with photovoltaic (PV) technologies can provide not only a solution to the rapidly growing energy needs, but can also help reduce environmental influences and climate problems induced by burning fossil fuels.6
PV technologies have garnered growing attention owing to their stimulating assets, such as low cost of manufacture, lightweight nature, flexibility, etc.7 Materials with photoactive layers play a vital role in achieving high power conversion efficiency.8 The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs reported to date is greater than 18%.9,10 However, the hole transport layer (HTL) is equally important to obtain high PV performance and long-term stability.11 Furthermore, the HTL has various benefits, such as modifying the energy level alignment of the ITO and the active layer,12 minimizing charge recombination,13 passivizing surface defects, minimizing leakage current,14 and regulating the morphology of the active layer of the OSCs.15 Well-known HTLs that are traditionally used in OSCs include poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymer, which exhibits the required criteria of HTLs in terms of work function, water solubility, and transmittance.16–18 However, the OSCs fabricated from PEDOT:PSS as the HTL are sensitive to high acidity, and their hygroscopic nature reduces the long-term stability of OSCs.19 In addition, they may suffer from relatively low electrical conductivity because the insulating PSS chains lead to reduced efficiency of the OSCs.20,21 To overcome these limitations of PEDOT:PSS, different metal oxide materials, such as MoO3, WO3, and V2O5, have been assessed as potential replacements for PEDOT:PSS.22 However, the thermal deposition of these materials is generally expensive, which hinders the large-scale and in-solution processability of R2R OSCs.23 To this end, many exciting carbon-based materials have been investigated and incorporated to improve the performance and stability of OSCs.24 The addition of highly conductive additive materials to PEDOT:PSS, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),25 is one way to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Using 0.2 wt% MWCNTs as dopants in PEDOT:PSS, the conductivity of the film increased from 0.28 to 9.16 S cm−1, with a slight decrease in optical transmission.25 Chen et al. reported that a blend of PEDOT:PSS and sulfonated carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) improves the hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS from 7.8 × 10−4 to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Consequently, the PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM-based devices was enhanced from 3.10 to 3.90%.26 Graphene oxide (GO) and its derivative are synthesized commonly by different methods, such as the modified Hummers’ method23,27 and the electrochemical exfoliation method,28–30 for use as HTLs. The incorporation of GO and its derivative as HTLs may result in an improvement the efficiency and device stability of OSCs.27,31 For example, Jeon et al. reported that P3HT:PC61BM bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells prepared using thermally annealed GO HTL could score a PCE of 3.98%, which was comparable to the PCE of 3.85% for conventional PEDOT:PSS HTL.32 Graphene (G) and its derivatives have been used as HTL or in the modification of PEDOT:PSS HTL in BHJ-OSCs.32,33 S. Ozcan et al. reported using GO-doped PEDOT:PSS as an HTL in inverted bulk heterojunction of P3HT:PC61BM solar cell, which improved the device efficiency from 2.69 to 2.75%.34 On the other hand, S. Rafique et al. reported using a GO/PEDOT:PSS double-decked layer as HTL for PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells, which led to a PCE of 4.28%; in comparison, GO or PEDOT:PSS HTLs on their own achieved PCEs of 2.77 and 3.57%, respectively.23 The addition of GO to PEDOT:PSS for use as an HTL in a device architecture to be ITO/PEDOT:PSS:GO/PTB7:PC71BM/Al scored a PCE of 5.22%.33 Furthermore, in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ device structure, a PCE of 8.6% was achieved using fluorinated reduced graphene (F-rGO), while the use of PEDOT:PSS as HTL yielded a PCE of 7.9%.35,36
In this study, we present the application of rGO as an HTL in OSCs, where rGO was synthesized from the waste dry cell using a combination of electrochemical exfoliation and the modified Hummers’ methods. As per the best of our knowledge, the rGO synthesized from waste dry cells using the electrochemical exfoliation method has not been used previously as the HTL in OSCs. Therefore, in this study, the conventional PEDOT:PSS doped with rGO to improve the hole mobility and the efficiency of OSCs. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the donor polymer, PTB7-Th, along with the non-fullerene (IEICO-4F) and fullerene (PC71BM) acceptors used in this study. The OSC device fabricated here (ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th: IEICO-4F/Al) from the doped PEDOT:PSS:rGO HTL achieved the highest PCE of 6.55% with JSC = 18.42 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.74 V, and FF of 48% due to the improved hole mobility 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1.

Experimental section
Preparation of graphite
Graphite powder was prepared from used dry cell batteries (R20S D 1.5 V). First, the electrodes were dismantled (separated) from the batteries to remove all kinds of impurities, such as MnO2, metal particles, and carbon. The electrodes were washed and rubbed several times with water.37 After drying, the electrodes were grinded and crushed to produce a homogeneous fine graphite powder as shown in Fig. 2. However, some inorganic material was present in the graphite powder, and thus, the powder was further treated with aquaregia (HCl and HNO3) (3:1) and heated for 2 hours. Finally, it was centrifuged and washed several times in distilled water to restore the pH. The recovered graphite powder was dried at 60 °C for 24 h.37

Synthesis of graphene oxide
The electrochemical exfoliation experiments were carried out with a two-electrode system.38 A graphite rod obtained from the waste dry cell batteries was used as an anode and as the source of graphene. A platinum (Pt) wire electrode was employed as a cathode. The two electrodes were placed parallel with a separation distance of 5.0 cm. The experiments were performed at room temperature by using a low-tension variable voltage supply. A constant voltage of 10 V was applied to the electrodes as shown in Fig. 3.38
 Fig. 3  Experimental setup of the electrochemical exfoliation process. 
For efficient electrochemical exfoliation of graphite, a sodium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide/water (NaOH/H2O2/H2O) solution was used. The precipitate was subsequently collected and washed repeatedly by vacuum filtration with deionized water (DI) and ethanol to remove residual ionic impurities. The obtained powder was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The final mixture was centrifuged and washed with DI water several times. Finally, GO was obtained after drying at 60 °C for 24 h as shown in Fig. 4.

Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide
1 gram of electrochemically exfoliated GO was added to a conical flask containing 100 mL of DI water. Then, 6 mL of hydrazine hydrate was then added to the reaction mixture. The whole setup was placed in an oil bath at 90 °C while stirring for 12 h as shown in Fig. 5. The black material thus obtained was centrifuged and washed several times and dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain rGO.

Results and discussion
Electrochemical exfoliation
In this study, a DC voltage supply was used for a smooth and continuous flow of electrons between the anode and cathode graphite rods.39,40 The synthesis route for the preparation of graphene using electrochemical exfoliation was effective as shown in Fig. 2–5.41 The biases in the applied voltage promoted water reduction at the cathode, leading to the generation of hydroxyl ions (OH−) and the evolution of hydrogen bubbles. The OH− ions adopted the role of nucleophiles in the electrolyte and attacked the edge of sites and grain boundaries of the graphite rod.39,42,43 The solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was allowed to react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form the highly nucleophilic peroxide ion (O22−).42NaOH → Na+ + OH−H2O2 + 2OH− → O22− + 2H2O
The formation of nucleophilic O22− promoted the reaction between OH− and H2O2, which indicated the exfoliation of graphite via electrochemical-potential-assisted intercalation and expansion of the graphite sheets.44 The anodic electrochemical exfoliation of the graphene sheets on the anode took place by the intercalation of negatively charged ion species into the positively charged anode.45 An efficient exfoliation of graphite in the presence of H2O2 was observed as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).46
Optical properties of G, GO, and rGO
To characterize the optical nature of G, GO, and rGO, these materials were dispersed in deionized water (Fig. 6). G showed an absorption peak at ∼272 nm; after oxidation of G to GO, it exhibited an absorption peak at ∼237 nm, which was attributed to the π–π* transition of oxygen-containing carbonaceous bands in GO, such as CC, CO, and C–O.47 The absorption peak of G (272 nm) disappeared in the GO spectrum. The absorption peak rGO was observed at 270 nm, indicating that the absorption peak of GO at 237 nm was red-shifted to 270 nm, and the absorption peak at 307 nm disappeared due to the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups.47 The absorption peak at 237 nm in the GO spectrum was red-shifted to 270 nm in the rGO spectrum. These observations confirmed the reduction of GO and the partial restoration of the π-network of rGO as shown in Fig. 6.47,48 The conductivity of G, GO, and rGO were assessed using a digital conductivity meter (Model 4510 Conductivity/TDS Meter) shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The conductivity of rGO was the highest and was consistent with the values reported in the literature.27,49,50

Furthermore, for application as the HTL, the transmittance spectra of the Glass/ITO, Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS, Glass/ITO/rGO, and Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PESS:rGO films were characterized (Fig. 7). The transmittance spectra of all the films showed a similar transmittance percentage of ≈90% of the incoming light between 400–900 nm. Hence, the rGO doped film of Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PESS:rGO showed transmittance that was comparable to that of the conventional Glass/ITI/PEDOT:PSS film.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

Fig. 8 shows the FTIR spectra of powdered G, GO, and rGO. The characteristics peaks centered at 1396, 1057, and 867 cm−1 in the GO spectrum were due to symmetric aliphatic C–H bending of the methyl groups (–CH3–), C–O stretching vibrations, and aromatic out-of-plane rings with two neighboring C–H groups, respectively.51 The two characteristic absorption bands at 2924 cm−1 and 2845 cm−1 were related to aliphatic asymmetric C–H stretching. Moreover, the bands at 3674 cm−1 were related to the free stretching of non-hydrogen bonded O–H groups belonging to either aldehyde or carboxylic anhydrides.51 The intensities of all spectra were significantly reduced for rGO, which confirmed that GO had successfully transformed to rGO. The peak intensities at 1396, 1057, 867, 2924, 2845, and 3674 cm−1 for the rGO decreased significantly as compared to those recorded for GO, which strongly confirmed the reduction and removal of oxygen-containing functional groups.52

X-Ray diffraction
XRD was used to investigate the crystal phase and to determine the interlayer spacing in G, GO, and rGO.51,53Fig. 9 shows the XRD spectra for G, GO, and rGO. The diffraction peaks of G, GO, and rGO samples were found to be well fitted to the standard XRD patterns of graphite with JCPDS card No. 08-415. In the XRD spectra of G, one sharp peak was observed around 2θ = 26.53°, confirming the presence of a well-arranged layer structure with 0.337 nm d-spacing, along with the (002) orientation. For GO, the 2θ peak showed a small shift to a lower value, which indicated that the graphite was oxidized to GO. Furthermore, the interlayer distance of GO increased with a d-spacing of 0.766 nm. The reason behind an increase in the interlayer spacing was the intercalation of oxide functional groups at the carbon basal plane, such as the epoxy, carboxyl (–COOH), hydroxyl (–OH), and carbonyl (–CO) groups, during the oxidation reactions.51,53 After the chemical reduction of GO by monohydrated hydrazine, the inter-layer structure along with the (002) plane orientation decreased to 0.369 nm. This was due to the elimination of oxygen-containing functional groups from GO and the restoration of π-conjugated graphene (rGO). Furthermore, these observations confirmed the successful reduction of GO to rGO.54

Optical properties of the active layer
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PTB7-Th in a dilute chloroform solution and a thin-film state are shown in Fig. 10(a). The maximum wavelengths in the solution and the film were observed at 690 and 700 nm, respectively. As compared to the solution, the spectra of the film for PTB7-Th were red-shifted due to the enrichment of the electron-rich 2,2′-bithiophene segment. In addition, a more ordered structure and stronger π–π* stacking interactions were noted in the films.55 These are benefits of the high hole mobility and better photovoltaic performance of the copolymer.56,57 The optical gap of PTB7-Th was 1.61 eV as calculated from the onset absorption spectra in a thin film using eqn (S4) (ESI†). Furthermore, the optical absorption spectra of the pristine PC71BM film, ITIC, and PTB7-Th in the thin film were also investigated (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 10  The normalized absorption spectra of (a) the solution and the thin film of PTB7-Th, and (b) PTB7-Th, PC71BM, and IEICO-4F in films. 
The absorption spectrum of ITIC showed a stronger absorption in the region of 500–800 nm and also showed limited complementary absorption spectra with the donor polymer PTB7-Th58 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The absorption onsets of the films were at 780, 980, and 710 nm, which corresponded to the optical gaps of 1.59, 1.27, and 1.75 eV for ITIC, IEICO-4F, and PC71BM, respectively. The PC71BM film exhibited blue-shifted absorption and a larger optical gap as compared with the ITIC, which had a negative effect on the Jsc, indicating that the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) effect weakened in PC71BM and limiting absorption occurred in the visible region.59 Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) showed much more intense and broad absorption spectra as compared to the PC71BM acceptors. The NFAs IEICO-4F covered the entire visible region and extended the NIR spectra to 1000 nm as shown in Fig. 10(b). Therefore, the complementarity of the absorption of IEICO-4F acceptor to that of the donor polymer, PTB7-Th, made it an ideal blend for use in OSCs as compared to the PC71BM and ITIC acceptors as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 10(b).
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTB7-Th as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The oxidation potential of PTB7-Th at the onset was 0.97 eV, and the HOMO energy level was calculated to be −5.37 eV using eqn (S2) (ESI†). On the other hand, the LUMO energy level was determined from the HOMO energy level, where the optical gap was −3.76 eV according to eqn (S4) (ESI†). The LUMO energy level can allow efficient exciton dissociation and electron transfer to IEICO-4F (LUMO at −4.19 eV) or PC71BM (LUMO at −4.06 eV) under identical conditions60 (Fig. 11). As compared to IEICO-4F, the LUMO energy level of the PC71BM acceptor was higher than 0.13 eV, which indicated the OSCs to have higher Voc.61 However, there was still a good energy level alignment between the donor polymer, PTB7-Th, and the acceptor material (IEICO-4F) as per the conventional geometry shown in Fig. 11.

Photovoltaic properties
To explore the photovoltaic properties of a conventional device, the configurations of ITO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-F/Al, ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, and ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al were fabricated as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The active layer was spin-coated from CB and 4% CN solution.62 The performances of solar cells thus produced are presented in Fig. 12 and Table 1. The device, ITO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, that was fabricated without any HTLs, afforded a poor performance of 1.38%. The device, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, showed optimal PCE of 5.07% (Voc = 0.72 V, JSC = 16.61 mA cm−2, and FF = 42%) due to the presence of an HTL based on PEDOT:PSS as compared to the bare ITO. Hence, the HTL is a crucial requirement for the high performance of OSCs. And also, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Al was fabricated as a reference, which scored a PCE of 4.15%.

The device, fabricated from rGO as HTL and a device structure of ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al achieved a relatively low performance of 4.94% (Voc = 0.72 V, JSC = 15.94 mA cm−2, and FF = 43%). This subpar performance was likely due to the poor morphology of rGO that was spin-coated on the surface of ITO and the growth of an in-homogeneous active layer with many pinholes on the HTL. However, the synergistic effect of PEDOT:PSS:rGO composite HTL presented a superior performance as compared to PEDOT:PSS and rGO (Fig. 12(a) and Table 1). The device with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al scored the highest PCE of 6.55% (Voc = 0.74 V, JSC = 18.42 mA cm−2, and FF = 48%). This significant improvement is due to the better PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F interfaces enhancing the exciton dissociation as confirmed by the highest hole mobility of 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).63
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 12(b). The photocurrent of the device, ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, indicated efficient photon harvesting and charge collection, which was confirmed by the higher Jsc of ∼18.73 mA cm−2. The currents calculated from the integrated EQE spectra were consistent with those determined from the J–V measurements (Fig. 12(a) and Table 1). Furthermore, upon a comparison of the photovoltaic parameters, type of active layer, and device structure of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al device with those of the reported device, the former was more related to graphene-based HTLs of the OSCs (Table 2). Therefore, the present work confirmed that rGO synthesized from electrochemically exfoliated GO using the modified Hummers’ method is a promising material for application as the HTL in OSCs.

Hole mobility
The hole mobilities of the devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, and ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al were measured by the SCLC method using eqn (S8) (ESI†).61 The thickness of the active layer measured by the Stylus surface profilometer was 115, 110, and 120 nm for the active layer of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AL, ITO/rGO/AL, and ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/AL, respectively. The hole mobilities of the devices were determined to be 1.67 × 10−5, 1.44 × 10−5, and 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). As compared to the devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al and ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al, the device based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al presented a higher charge carrier mobility. This observation corroborates the higher JSC of 18.42 mA cm−2 and FF of 48% as shown in Table 1. The PEDOT:PSS:rGO composite has a significant effect on the charge carrier mobility in the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F films.
Morphological studies
Photovoltaic performance was markedly affected by the morphology of the active blend layers.70,71 To investigate the surface profile of the HTL, we conducted AFM experiments as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The root mean square roughness (RMS) of the Glass/ITO surface of the film was 5.74 nm as shown in Fig. S7(a) (ESI†). Ice clusters were observed in the topography height image, confirming that the RMS value of the Glass/ITO surface was high. However, for the Glass/ITO surface that was spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS, the RMS values were reduced to 0.9 nm as shown in Fig. S7(b) (ESI†). The PEDOT:PSS improved the bare ITO surface roughness and the HOMO energy level alignment of the donor polymer, PTB7-Th, facilitating the hole transport of the OSCs as shown in Fig. 13 and Table 1. For the Glass/ITO surface that was spin-coated using rGO, the film roughness was reduced to ∼2.00 nm indicating that deposition of the rGO layer planarized the anode surface as shown in Fig. S7(c) (ESI†). However, the composite film, Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGo, significantly reduced the bare ITO film roughness from 5.74 to 0.70 nm as shown in Fig. S7(a and d) (ESI†). This observation indicated that the composite film, PEDOT:PSS:rGO, could effectively reduce the RMS morphology of bare ITO and allow the synergistic hybridization of the two materials, which potentially enhanced the device performance as evidenced in Fig. 13 and Table 1.
 Fig. 13  The topography morphology of atomic force microscopy height images of 2 × 2 μm2 (a) Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film, (b) Glass/ITO/rGO/PTB7Th:IEICO-4F film, and (c) Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7Th:IEICO-4F film. 
Furthermore, the morphology of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, and ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F were investigated as shown in Fig. 12. The RMS values of the topography height image surface of the corresponding devices were recorded to be 1.00, 1.75, and 1.23 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 13(a–c). The FF of the OSCs fabricated from these blends was found to be relatively low due to large phase separation of the active layers, high RMS values, the largeness of the aggregates, and poor interpenetration of the networks of the blended films, which limited the effective exciton dissociation and charge transport/collection.72,73 The device fabricated from ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/AL afforded the highest PCE of 6.55% with improved parameters (JSC = 18.42 mA cm−2, FF = 48%) and hole mobility of 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S6 (ESI†).
Conclusions
rGO synthesized from the electrochemical exfoliation of GO was used as the HTL in the OSC devices, ITO/rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS:rGO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Al. The device fabricated from the composite PEDOT:PSS:rGO HTL achieved the highest PCE of 6.55% with JSC = 18.42 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.74 V, and FF of 48%, which was attributed to the improved hole mobility, i.e., 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, of the OSCs. Collectively, the findings suggest that the PEDOT:PSS:rGO composite thin layer is a promising candidate as an anode buffer layer in conventional non-fullerene organic solar cells.
