    , Accepted 10th February 2019First published on 11th February 2019AbstractThe effect of Pb and La substitution on the thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO oxyselenide has been studied. It is revealed that Pb doping can significantly improve the electrical conductivity due to the increased carrier concentration, which results in a large power factor in the range of 700 to 800 μW m−1 K−2 at 873 K. In particular, the electrical transport properties can be further improved obviously over the entire measured temperature range after replacing some Bi3+ ions with La3+ ions in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. The electrical conductivity has increased from 408 S cm−1 for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO to 594 S cm−1 for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO at 327 K due to the increased carrier mobility. Combining with the moderate Seebeck coefficient which is over 124 μV K−1, the power factor has been significantly improved. An optimal value of 1059 μW m−1 K−2 at around room temperature is achieved for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO and is much higher than most reported values. Additionally, the increased total thermal conductivity for the Pb-doped sample compared with the pristine sample has been suppressed after further doping the La element in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. Therefore, a maximum ZT value of nearly 0.90 at 873 K for the sample Bi0.92La0.02Pb0.06CuSeO has been finally obtained, which is ∼36% and ∼16% higher as compared with those of the La-free sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO and the reported Pb-free sample Bi0.92La0.08CuSeO.
I. Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials can directly and reversibly convert heat energy into electrical energy. They have received great attention because the devices made from TE materials with no moving parts and no emission of any harmful gases have prospects of being green and reliable sources of energy by harvesting waste heat or solar energy.1,2 According to the theoretical efficiency of a TE generator, the conversion efficiency of a TE device is mainly determined by the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) for a given material, as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, κ and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature, respectively. Thus, excellent electrical transport properties along with low thermal conductivities to achieve a high ZT for the material should be required to get a good device.3,4 Among all the TE materials, oxygen-containing TE materials have been considered as promising TE candidates because of their low cost, high thermal and chemical stability, and environmental compatibility.5 However, the simple crystal structure, large bonding energy and light constituting elements of metal oxides which yield a weak phonon scattering cause a relatively high thermal conductivity. In addition, the large electronegativity difference among the constituent elements for oxides leads to more ionic bonding and strong scattering of carriers, resulting in a low carrier mobility and poor electrical transport properties. Therefore, optimizing the electrical and thermal conductivities of oxides simultaneously to obtain a higher ZT value than conventional TE materials6 is challenging.
Quaternary oxyselenide BiCuSeO with a high ZT is realized as a good candidate TE material due to its moderate electrical transport performance, intrinsically low thermal conductivity, and relatively high thermal and chemical stability.7–10 This compound with a complex layered ZrSiCuAs structure as shown in Fig. 1(a) is constituted of conducting (Cu2Se2)2− layers alternately stacked with insulating (Bi2O2)2+ layers along the c axis of the tetragonal cell, which is analogous to the two-dimensional confinement effects.11 Thus, the thermal and electrical transport properties can be decoupled based on this natural superlattice structure constructed from two different layers with distinct functionalities.9 In recent years, by tuning the electrical transport properties and by lowering the thermal conductivity below 1.0 W m−1 K−1, ZT around 1.0 has been achieved, which is much higher than that of most of the oxygen-containing TE materials and makes BiCuSeO a very promising TE material.7 However, when compared to that of the state-of-the-art TE material of lead tellurium, the power factor of BiCuSeO is lower due to the poor electrical conductivity because of the low carrier concentration and carrier mobility. Thus, the improvement of the ZT value is limited. Doping being realized as an important and effective route to optimize the electrical transport properties of TE materials has been extensively studied. Actually, the doping effect on BiCuSeO was widely investigated and the carrier concentration has been optimized by various element substitutions, such as doping at the Bi site by divalent ions (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Yb)12–17 and monovalent ions (Na, K, and Ag),18–20 and at the Cu site by Fe21 and Cd,22 as well as some dual-doping at Bi and Cu sites.23–25 Nevertheless, the carrier mobility is often strongly reduced (1–2 cm2 V−1 s−1) owing to the enhanced scattering originating from acoustic phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering.9,13 Thereby, to further enhance the TE properties of BiCuSeO, research should be focused on the enhancement of carrier mobility besides the increased carrier concentration.

It is known that carrier mobility is closely related to the effective mass and the curvature of conduction valleys. When decreasing the effective mass or increasing the conduction valleys, the carrier mobility could be increased. LaCuSeO with the same crystal structure as of BiCuSeO shows a larger band gap of 2.8 eV.26 According to the band structure calculation, BiCuSeO is a multiband semiconductor.9 The top of the valence band consists of a hole pocket located on the Γ–M line. Other hole pockets can be observed on the Γ–X line and at the Z point, which are located about −0.15 eV below the Fermi level, and they participate in the electronic conduction in some cases.9 Thus, it is expected that La substitution can lead to an obvious change in the band structure and an improvement of carrier mobility, because the top of the valence band could be reduced as the band gap increases, which would lead to the decreasing band offset between the primary and secondary valence bands. The secondary band (light band) will play a noticeable role in heavily doped BiCuSeO and result in a larger carrier mobility. In fact, a clear band change has been evidenced according to the absorption spectral experiment reported by Liu.27 However, it is also revealed that the carrier concentration was reduced due to the La introduction, which might be caused by the changed band structure.27 So, the TE properties can be further improved if the carrier concentration is further optimized together with the enhanced carrier mobility. The Pb element has been dominating as an effective divalent dopant to enhance the carrier concentration of BiCuSeO.28,29 In particular, the carrier mobility is less decreased due to the smaller influence of Pb doping on the local structure of the [Cu2Se2] layer.16,28 Therefore, this information motivates us to tune the electrical transport properties by dual doping of La and Pb in BiCuSeO with an aim to decouple the carrier concentration and mobility. The present work indicates that a large power factor of over 900 μW m−2 K−2 for the doped samples can be obtained thanks to the improved electrical conductivity. By combination of the low thermal conductivity because of the obviously reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a maximum ZT value of nearly 0.90 can be obtained for the sample La0.02Bi0.92Pb0.06CuSeO.
II. Experimental process
Polycrystalline BiCuSeO and LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO (x = 0–0.06) samples were synthesized by combining solid-state reaction and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Stoichiometric mixtures of commercial powders Bi (4N), Cu (3N), Se (4N), Bi2O3 (3N), Pb (4N) and La2O3 (4N) were roughly mixed using a pestle and a mortar for 20 min. Then, they were cold pressed to pellets of ∅ 20 mm and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube with a pressure less than 5 × 10−4 Pa. The tubes were placed in a box furnace and heated at 573 K for 8 h and then at 973 K for 24 h with a heating rate of 100 K h−1. When the tubes were furnace cooled down to room temperature, the products were taken out and ground into powders by ball milling. Finally, the resultant powders were densified with SPS at 973 K for 5 min under a uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa to form column-shaped bulk samples of Φ 10 mm × 10 mm (thickness). Two pieces were cut from one column-shaped bulk to separately measure its electrical conductivity and thermal diffusivity in the same direction, which were along the direction perpendicular to the SPS pressing direction as its anisotropy.
The densities of all the samples were measured by the Archimedes method. The structural phases were identified by using XRD (XRD, Rigaku, Japan). The morphologies of fractographs were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin, Germany), with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) to observe the composition and distribution of the elements. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistance data were recorded simultaneously as a function of temperature from room temperature to 873 K using a Seebeck coefficient/electric resistance measuring system (ZEM-3, Ulvac-Riko, Japan). The data for some samples were also recorded during the cooling cycle to evaluate their thermal stability. The thermal conductivity (к) was calculated using the equation к = DCpd, where Cp is the specific heat capacity obtained from the Dulong–Petit law, d is the density, and D is the thermal diffusivity, which were measured using laser flash equipment (Netzsch Laser Flash Apparatus LFA 457, Germany). The uncertainty of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity measurements is within 5%, and that of thermal conductivity is estimated to be within 8% by considering the uncertainties for D, Cp and d. Therefore, the combined uncertainty for all measurements involved in the ZT determination shown in the plot is estimated to be 15%–20%.
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns for all the bulk samples Bi0.94−xPb0.06LaxCuSeO (x = 0.00–0.06). It is found that all the main peaks can be well matched to BiCuSeO characteristic peaks (PDF #45-0296) with the ZrSiCuAs structure and no second phase is observed. The lattice parameters for all the samples were calculated using XRD patterns obtained from the smooth surface of the bulk. The calculated values for the sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO are a = b = 3.9376 Å, c = 8.9420 Å, which are well consistent with that of the Pb-doped sample and are larger than that of the undoped BiCuSeO sample in the literature.28 The lattice expansion can be explained from the larger ionic radius of Pb2+ (1.29 Å) than that of Bi3+ (1.17 Å).30 In addition, the substitution of Pb2+ for Bi3+ is of aliovalent doping and the electronic charge of each layer would be modified as [(Bi1−xPbx)2O2](2−2x)+ and [Cu2Se2](2−2x)− using the simple electron count according to the defect chemistry. Therefore, the Pb doping would lead to the transfer of holes in the “conductive layer”, resulting in the decrement of the coulombic attraction between the layers and an increment of the c axis. However, the calculated lattice parameters for the La-doped samples Bi0.94−xPb0.06LaxCuSeO (x = 0.01–0.06) are similar to that of the sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO and no obvious difference can be observed by increasing La-doped content. It is reasonable if considering a similar ionic radius of La3+ (1.16 Å)30 to Bi3+ (1.17 Å). Additionally, being different from the Pb doping, the substitution of La3+ for Bi3+ is of equivalent doping, which would have less of an effect on the coulombic attraction between the layers and the lattice parameters.
All the bulk samples are dense. The relative densities are mostly over 95%, which are 8.55 g cm−3, 8.52 g cm−3, 8.33 g cm−3, 8.63 g cm−3, 8.49 g cm−3 and 8.58 g cm−3 for the samples Bi0.94−xPb0.06LaxCuSeO with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.06, respectively. This is consistent with the dense morphologies of the samples as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c), which present the SEM micrographs of the fresh fracture surfaces for the representative bulks Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO, Bi0.92Pb0.06La0.02CuSeO and Bi0.90Pb0.06La0.04CuSeO, respectively. It shows that the grain sizes of all the samples are large, even for the sample with La and Pb doping. This indicates that the grain growth cannot be suppressed after La doping. Most grains in the samples almost exhibit a plate shape with 6–10 μm diameter and 500 nm–2 μm thickness. An obvious orientation arrangement of the grains in some areas can be observed. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b), a representative microstructure image in the local area for the sample Bi0.92Pb0.06La0.02CuSeO has been given. This suggests the existence of slightly preferential orientation in the bulk. Moreover, the composition and the element distribution of Bi0.92Pb0.06La0.02CuSeO were confirmed by EDX, representatively, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Both Pb and La elements can be detected, and all the elements are homogeneously distributed.

Fig. 3 shows the electrical transport properties of all the samples LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO (x = 0–0.06). The properties of the prepared sample BiCuSeO without any element doping are also given. We can find that the sample BiCuSeO shows a lower electrical conductivity below 40 S cm−1 and a higher Seebeck coefficient above 300 μV K−1 in the range of the whole measured temperature because of its large effective mass,7 which induces a lower power factor of 338 μW m−1 K−2 at 814 K. In addition, an increase of both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient can be observed with increasing temperature. Over 400 K, the sample exhibits a semiconducting behavior. These results are consistent with our previous study13 and are also in accordance with most reported values for the pristine BiCuSeO in the literature.7,15 However, after 6% Pb doping at the Bi site, the electrical conductivity has been significantly improved as shown in Fig. 3(a), although the electrical conductivity has reduced with increasing temperature over the entire temperature range. At 327 K, the value is 408 S cm−1, which is one order of magnitude larger than that of the undoped sample. The electrical conductivity of 158 S cm−1 at 863 K is also four times higher than that of the pristine BiCuSeO. The carrier concentration and mobility at room temperature for BiCuSeO and Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO have been calculated using the measured Hall coefficients. The results indicate that the carrier concentration of Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO with 1.65 × 1021 cm−3 is two orders of magnitude larger than that of BiCuSeO with 5.59 × 1018 cm−3, although the mobility of 2.50 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been reduced from 9.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 because of the enhanced scattering originating from acoustic phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering.28 In addition, the effective mass estimated using the Prisarenko relation4 as shown in the following part indicates that the data for the pristine sample and the Pb-doped sample are 3.5m0 and 9.23m0, respectively. This suggests that the effective mass has been increased after Pb doping, which should also be responsible for the reduced mobility. Thus, the increase in electrical conductivity after Pb doping is mainly caused by the great enhancement of the carrier concentration. According to the defect chemistry reaction, as given below, when the Bi3+ site is substituted by Pb2+, redundant hole carriers should be induced in the (Bi2O2)2+ layers. (1)

(d) Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at 327 and 863 K as a function of the La fraction x (atom %) for LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO. 
Thereby, the redundant carriers would transfer to the (Cu2Se2)2− layers, leading to an increase in carrier concentration and hence enhancing the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the increase of carrier concentration is connected to a rapid decrease of the Seebeck coefficient according to the Prisarenko relation,4 which falls below 250 μV K−1 for the Pb-doped sample as shown in Fig. 3(b). However, the decrease is moderate as compared to the large improvement of the electrical conductivity. Therefore, an enhancement of the power factor in the range of 700 to 800 μW m−1 K−2 over the entire measurement temperature has been obtained for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO as shown in Fig. 3(c).
As expected, the electrical transport properties have been further improved obviously after replacing some Bi3+ ions with La3+ ions in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. The electrical conductivities as a function of the La fraction (atom %) at 327 K and 863 K are shown in Fig. 3(d). It is clearly seen that the value has been enhanced when the doped content x = 0.01, which increases from 408 S cm−1 at 327 K and 158 S cm−1 at 863 K for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO to 594 S cm−1 and 202 S cm−1 for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO. When increasing the fraction of the doping element La, the electrical conductivity tends to decrease. Nevertheless, although the electrical conductivity has been reduced from 400 S cm−1 at 323 K to 148 S cm−1 at 863 K for the x = 0.06 sample, the value is still comparable to that of the sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO, suggesting that La, Pb dual-doping is an effective way to enhance the electrical conductivity of BiCuSeO. The Seebeck coefficient of all the samples is positive as shown in Fig. 3(b), indicating a p-type conductive mechanism by holes as the dominant carriers. The values are in the range of 120 μV K−1 to 200 μV K−1 for all the doped samples, and they increase by increasing the temperature. It is also found that the La doping has an effect on the Seebeck coefficient which decreases from 141 μV K−1 for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO to 132 μV K−1 for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO and further to 124 μV K−1 at 327 K as shown in Fig. 3(c). However, the decrease is less when compared to the increased electrical conductivity. By combination of the enhanced electrical conductivity and less reduced Seebeck coefficient, the resultant power factor has been significantly improved. The values for the samples LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO with x = 0.01 are all over 900 μW m−1 K−2. An optimal power factor of 1059 μW m−1 K−2 around room temperature has been achieved, which is 3 times that for the pristine sample and ∼30% higher than that of the La-free sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. The power factor obtained in the present work is also much higher than most reported values, such as those of the Sr-,14 Ca-,13 Mg-,12 Ba-,15 Yb17-doped samples, and Pb and Te co-doped samples.23 Notably, the data for the samples with x = 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 were also recorded during the cooling cycle to evaluate their thermal stability. Similar properties can be obtained as shown in Fig. 3, which indicates that the samples are much more stable.
To identify the transport properties, the Hall carrier concentration (n) and Hall mobility (μ) in the range of 300 to 773 K for the samples LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 are shown in Fig. 4. The carrier concentration below 450 K for all the samples is larger, which is around 1.0 × 1021 cm−3 without no obvious change with doping. Meanwhile, the mobility of all the samples is lower than 5 cm2 V−1 s−1, being indicative of strong scattering against carriers. However, we can find that the hole mobility has been improved after La doping, particularly at a temperature below 450 K. The value for the sample with x = 0.01 has been increased to ∼5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is nearly two times higher than that of Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO with 2.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. A larger electronegativity difference between atoms will cause a larger bond ionicity. Thus, an additional potential field will be generated by the relative displacement between the atoms, which can lead to a strong lattice scattering of the charge carriers and reduce the carrier mobility. In consideration of the larger electronegativity difference of La (χLa ∼ 1.1) between the other elements in the compound BiCuSeO (χBi ∼ 2.02, χCu ∼ 1.90, χSe ∼ 2.55, χO ∼ 3.44), the increased mobility should be caused by the changed band structure since BiCuSeO is a multi-band material. Assuming that the electron conduction occurs within a single parabolic band, the effective mass can be estimated using the Prisarenko relation as follows:4 (2)where S is the Seebeck coefficient, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the carrier charge, h is the Planck constant,  is the effective mass at the Fermi level, and n is the hole concentration. The  for the samples LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO with x = 0.00, 0.02 and 0.04 is 9.23m0, 6.33 m0, and 5.48 m0, respectively, which tends to decrease with increasing the fraction of the doping element La. Fig. 4(c) shows the carrier mobility with the carrier concentration at room temperature. The calculated data of carrier mobility with the carrier concentration were obtained using the SPB model with acoustic scattering.31 Moreover, the data from the literature are also given for comparison.27,28 It can be found that the mobility is larger for the La-doped samples compared to that of the Pd-doped sample. The data at lower carrier concentration is higher than the calculated value, which indicates that the effective mass has been reduced after La doping. Actually, in Liu's report,27 the band structure was calculated by first principles calculation using density functional theory in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). Their results indicate that the band gap Eg increases and the energy separation between two valence bands ΔE at 0 K decreases with La-doping. Thus, these results all suggest that the contribution of the light band for the electrical transport of BiCuSeO increases after La doping. When increasing the La doping content, the mobility is slightly reduced because of the enhanced phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering. Moreover, the carrier mobility also decreased with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of μ can usually be modeled by a power law μ ∼ T−r when one scattering mechanism limits μ for the temperature range of interest, where r is the scattering factor of the carriers. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the T−1.5 relation can be observed for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO, indicating that the scattering of charge carriers is dominated by acoustic phonons. The data change from T−1.5 to T−1.9 can be observed with increasing La-doped concentration. The failure of a single power law to fit the mobility data is likely due to the presence of multiple scattering mechanisms. Anyhow, the enhanced electrical conductivity below 450 K for the La-doped samples as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (d) should be caused by the increased carrier mobility. Above 450 K, the improved electrical conductivity for the La-doped samples results from the increased carrier concentration as shown in Fig. 4(a). Although the carrier mobility decreased with increasing temperature, the carrier concentration of all the samples increased due to the impact of thermal excitation. However, it is interesting that the carrier concentration for the La-doped samples is much higher than that of Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. In fact, no redundant carriers should be induced when the Bi3+ site is substituted by equivalent La3+ according to the defect chemistry reaction. Thus, the increased carrier concentration might be caused by the different electronic structures between Bi and La, since the electronegativity of La of 1.1 is much lower than that of Bi of 2.02, which would induce a weak strength to charges. The magnitude of electronegativity reflects the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons. Thus, a smaller value of La compared to that of Bi in BiCuSeO may release more electrons into the system, which will contribute to the increased carrier concentration as shown in Fig. 4(b) since the conducting carriers include both electrons and holes.

Fig. 5 shows the thermal transport properties as a function of temperature for the samples BiCuSeO and LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO (x = 0–0.06). The total thermal conductivity of the pristine sample decreases with increasing temperature from 0.85 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K to 0.5 W m−1 K−1 at 773 K as shown in Fig. 5(a), which is much lower than the other oxides.5 The low thermal conductivity is mainly related to its unique crystal structure with low Young's modulus and sound speed. After Pb doping, the total thermal conductivity increases to 1.30 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and 0.95 W m−1 K−1 at 873 K, which is also higher than the reported values.16,29 However, the increased thermal conductivity has been suppressed after further doping the La element, and the data reduce when increasing the doped fraction, particularly for the sample with x = 0.04, which shows 1.1 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and 0.75 W m−1 K−1 at 873 K. The total thermal conductivity is usually a sum of electronic thermal conductivity (кe) and lattice thermal conductivity (кl), where кl is the phonon contribution and кe is the electronic contribution. κe can be obtained from LσT, where σ is the electrical conductivity and L is the Lorenz number. Generally, κe can be estimated with L using 1.5 × 10−8 V2 K−2 for a nondegenerate semiconductor and 2.45 × 10−8 V2 K−2 for a degenerate semiconductor. For most TE materials, the true L is in fact lower than 2.45 × 10−8 V2 K−2 particularly at high temperature. L depends on the scattering parameter r and will decrease as the reduced Fermi energy η decreases with increasing temperature. L can be given as:16 (3)

For the L calculation, the reduced Fermi energy η should be obtained firstly; the calculation of η can be derived from the measured Seebeck coefficients by using the following relationship: (4)
where Fn(η) is the n-th order Fermi integral, (5)where e is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, and r is the scattering factor. Assuming that acoustic phonon scattering is the main carrier scattering mechanism, the scattering factor r is −1/2. The Lorenz number can be obtained by applying the calculated reduced Fermi energy η and scattering parameter r to eqn (3). In this work, the obtained Lorenz number L is lower than 2.45 × 10−8 V2 K−2, ranging from 1.78 × 10−8 to 1.45 × 10−8 V2 K−2. κl is estimated by directly subtracting κe from the total thermal conductivity. Fig. 5(b) shows the temperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and the lattice thermal conductivity (κl). κe has been increased after doping due to the enhanced electrical conductivity. κe holds 1% of the total thermal conductivity for the pristine sample, while the ratio rises to ∼20% for all the doped samples. Therefore, one reason for the increased total thermal conductivity after doping originates from the enhanced κe. Additionally, it is found that κl has also been increased unexpectedly after doping compared with the pristine sample. It is reported that the substitution of Pb can modify the crystal structure of BiCuSeO. The α and β Se–Cu–Se angles change with increasing Pb content, resulting in a reduction of the distortion of the CuSe4 tetrahedra.28,29 Thus, this modification of the distortion might weaken the phonon scattering and increase κl. In addition, both Pb and La elements show a light atomic mass compared with Bi, which would also result in a weak phonon scattering. Nevertheless, further study needs to be done to clarify it. However, κl was reduced after doping La at the Bi site in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO and decreased with increasing La content attributed to the increased point defect, which would enhance the phonon scattering. Thus, the suppressed total thermal conductivity for the La and Pb co-doped samples in Fig. 5(a) is caused by the reduced κl.
Combining the electrical transport properties and thermal conductivity, the ZT value was calculated as shown in Fig. 6. The ZT value increases obviously after Pb doping because of the enhanced electrical transport properties. Notably, a further improved ZT over the entire measured temperature can be obtained after La doping. The maximum ZT value is around 0.87 at 873 K for the sample Bi0.92La0.02Pb0.06CuSeO, which is ∼36% and ∼16% higher as compared with those of the La-free sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO and the reported Pb-free sample Bi0.92La0.08CuSeO.27 According to the expression of ZT, the enhanced value benefits from the increased power factor and the reduced lattice thermal conductivity. It should be noted that although the ZT value has been improved, the thermal conductivity of all the doped samples obtained in this work is much higher than the reported values for the La-doped samples27 and Pb-doped samples,16,29 as well as than those for some other doped samples.14,15 One possible reason might be the larger grain size as mentioned above, which produces a weak phonon scattering. Thus, if the thermal conductivity can be significantly reduced by regulating its microstructure, such as introducing nanocomposites, the ZT value can be further enhanced.

IV. Conclusion
Polycrystalline BiCuSeO and LaxBi0.94−xPb0.06CuSeO (x = 0–0.06) samples were synthesized by combining a solid-state reaction and SPS. The phase structure and microstructure were observed, and the TE transport properties in the range of 300 to 873 K have been investigated with an emphasis on the effect of the La doping in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. The results indicate that La doping in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO can effectively optimize its electrical transport properties. The electrical conductivity exhibits an obvious improvement over the entire measured temperature, and it increases from 408 S cm−1 for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO to 594 S cm−1 for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO at 327 K due to the increased carrier mobility. By combination of the moderate Seebeck coefficient, the power factor has been significantly improved. An optimal value of 1059 μW m−1 K−2 around room temperature is achieved for Bi0.93Pb0.06La0.01CuSeO. In addition, the increased total thermal conductivity has been suppressed after doping the La element in Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. As a result, a maximum ZT value nearly 0.90 at 873 K for the sample Bi0.92La0.02Pb0.06CuSeO is obtained, which is ∼36% and ∼16% higher as compared with those of the La-free sample Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO and the reported Pb-free sample Bi0.92La0.08CuSeO. A higher ZT can be expected by further reducing its lattice thermal conductivity.
