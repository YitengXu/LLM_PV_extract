    , Accepted 7th November 2011First published on 13th December 2011AbstractTransition metal oxide nanostructures are current research focus for energy storage applications. We herein report the synthesis of MnO2–NiO nanoflake-assembled tubular array on stainless steel substrate to function as pseudocapacitor electrode by programmed three-dimensional (3D) interfacial reactions, in which the ZnO nanowire array is employed as the low-cost in situ sacrificial template. In this 3D nanoelectrode, MnO2 and NiO nanoflakes share the same “root” and form an integrated hierarchical structure, which adheres robustly to the substrate. Importantly, both MnO2 and NiO contribute to the charge storage. The highly porous structure, which allows easy penetration of the electrolyte, gives additional merits. Detailed electrochemical characterization reveals that the assembled MnO2–NiO array exhibits good rate performance and cycle life. In particular, it displays an areal capacitance that is four orders of magnitude higher than that of carbonaceous materials and significantly superior to those of previous directly-grown pseudocapacitive nanostructure films.
1. Introduction
Driven by growing concerns about the depletion of traditional energy resources and global warming caused by massive CO2 emissions, developing sustainable and clean energy products such as electricity from solar cells and wind has attracted much interest in recent years.1–5 Since most of the sustainable resources are only intermittently available, to promote their full potential utilization, it is highly required to explore advanced energy storage and delivery systems.6,7 For electrochemical energy storage, a critical element in the pursuit of this quest is the design of novel electrode materials.8–10Nanostructures have been demonstrated to be unique in facilitating the mass transport, ion diffusion and electron transfer, thus dramatically boosting the electrochemical performance.11–13 In particular, ordered nanostructures grown directly on current collectors are most helpful to charge carrier transport and stress relaxation.14–22 When combined with highly porous or hollow structural morphologies,23nanostructure arrays represent an attractive architecture for fast reaction kinetics due to significantly enhanced surface area. During the past decade, chemical synthesis such as hydrothermal18–22 and electrodeposition14–16 demonstrated the impressive success in achieving controllable composition and morphology of various ordered electrode materials. However, for some purposes such as optimizing electrode performance, it is desirable to combine merits of individual materials.24–26 In this respect, simple chemical synthesis is not a fitting choice; it is still challenging to develop a facile and general route for producing multi-component nanostructure arrays on large area electrode substrate.
Supercapacitors are one of the most promising candidates to couple renewable energy sources for green transportation and large-scale energy storage, owing to their various desirable characteristics including long cycle life and operation at fast charge and discharge rates.2–7 For example, conventional electric double layer capacitors based on carbon typically have high power density of >10 kW kg−1 and very long lifetime of >106 cycles.7 However, due to the low density and gravimetric capacitance of carbon, the capacitance per unit area (Ca) is generally in the range of 10–40 μF cm−2.27 For applications such as small scale electronics and stationary energy storage devices, the amount of energy stored per unit area is a critical figure of merit, more important than energy per unit mass. As a result, metal oxides such as RuO2, MnO2, NiO, CoOx, and electronically conducting polymers, or their composites, have been used28–33 as they have increased gravimetric capacitance via pseudocapacitive redox reactions and much larger density, thus, it is possible to increase the Ca while keeping similar (or even smaller) film thickness as that of conventional carbon-based electrode. Nevertheless, a literature survey has indicated that the Ca of so far reported directly-grown pseudocapacitive material films/arrays is still in the mF cm−2 region.27,34–37 To potentially increase the Ca, it is necessary to integrate two or more active materials with high redox electroactivity into one ordered nanostructure. By doing this, more space in the electrode films would be efficiently used to store energy and possible synergistic effect between active materials can be utilized.24 With the help of ordered array architecture, we can expect to increase the Ca almost without sacrificing cycle life and rate performance.

        MnO2 and NiO are the two most widely investigated pseudocapacitive materials due to their low cost, high redox activity, environmentally benign nature and natural abundance.26,34 The theoretical gravimetric capacitance of MnO2 and NiO is as high as ∼1370 and 2573 F g−1, respectively. While the individual capacitive property of these two materials has been extensively demonstrated,22,24–26,30,32,34,36,37 no study on their composite's electrochemical capacitance has been reported. In this paper, we present a programmed three-dimensional (3D) interfacial reaction route to fabricate integrated MnO2–NiO tubular arrays, which are constructed uniformly by numerous thin nanoflakes. The developed method can guarantee the successive deposition of structural components and the in situ removal of the template in the absence of any strong acid or alkali, with ease of structural control and high generality. With the smart combination of MnO2 and NiO, a synergistic effect can be observed: the firstly-grown MnO2 flake-assembled array provides a scaffold for the later NiO growth, avoiding the conventional aggregation and ensuring sufficient ion diffusion; while the further introduction of NiO reduces the charge-transfer resistance of MnO2, leading to fast electron transport within active materials. Consequently, the Ca of 0.35 F cm−2 can be achieved, four orders of magnitude higher than the Ca values of carbonaceous materials (10–40 μF cm−2) and significantly superior to those of most reported directly-grown pseudocapacitive nanostructure films (0.5–125 mF cm−2). The nanoflake-assembled tubular structures aligned directly on current collector ensure the large electrochemically active area and enhanced electron collection efficiency, also leading to good rate capability and long cycle life.
2. Experimental
Synthesis
A typical fabrication procedure is shown in Scheme 1. We started with ZnO nanowires, which are a common fabrication template due to its easy availability and dissolution in acid or basic solution. Carbon-coated ZnO (ZnO@C) nanowire arrays on stainless steel substrate (current collector) were prepared according to our previous report.38 Typically, a thin layer carbon with ∼6 nm thickness could be painted homogenously on the hydrothermally grown nanowire surface. To fabricate our MnO2–NiO hybrid tubular arrays, a 3D interfacial reaction protocol was purposely designed. At first, ZnO@C arrays were immersed into a 0.03 M KMnO4 aqueous solution and sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 160 °C for 5 h (Step 1, interfacial reaction between C and KMnO4 to obtain ZnO–MnO2 core-shell array). Then, the sample further reacted in a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 0.5 g Ni(NO3)2 at 120 °C for 12 h (interfacial reaction of Ni3+ and ZnO). This process led to the coating of nickel hydroxide onto the nanowire surface and the in situ dissolution of ZnO (Step 2). An additional annealing process (350 °C for 2 h) in Ar gas was finally carried out to transform nickel hydroxide into NiO as well as to improve the mechanical and electrical adhesion between hybrid structure and current collector substrate. For electrochemical property comparison, pure MnO2 tubular arrays without the second step of NiO growth were also prepared by acid etching (0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution) of ZnO@MnO2 core-shell arrays followed by 350 °C annealing.

Structural characterization
The microstructure and morphology of the product were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D-8 Avance), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010FEF, 200 kV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6700F, 5.0 kV), and Raman spectroscopy (Witech CRM200, 532 nm). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was conducted on an FEI Titan (200 kV) TEM and acquired in scanning TEM (STEM) mode at an equal acquisition time, with a nominal electron beam diameter of ∼1 nm for the measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement were performed on a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Electron, U.K.) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) irradiation.
Electrochemical test
Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760C, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) using a three-electrode mode in 1.5 M LiOH aqueous solution within the potential window of approximately −0.2 to 0.6 V. A piece of ∼2 cm2MnO2–NiO hybrid tubular array on stainless steel foil was directly used as the working electrode. The reference electrode and counter electrode were Ag/AgCl and a platinum plate, respectively. EIS measurements were performed by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at open circuit potential. Prior to the experiments, the array electrode was sealed on all edges except for the working surface area with epoxy resin. Areal capacitance was calculated using Equation: Carea = I·t/(△V·S), where I is the constant discharge current, t is the discharging time, △V is the voltage drop upon discharging (excluding the IR drop), and S is the geometrical area of the electrode. The areal energy density de was calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves according to Equation: de = Carea·(△V)2/2.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD result of the ZnO@C array after the reaction in KMnO4 solution. It is well known that carbon (amorphous carbon, graphitic carbons such as carbon nanotube and graphene) can easily have a redox reaction with KMnO4 even at room temperature, producing MnO2 materials with well-defined morphology (3C + 4MnO4− + H2O = 4MnO2 + CO32− + 2HCO3−).39,40 In our case, the carbon layers uniformly coated on ZnO nanowires serve as a sacrificial template to direct the 3D interfacial reaction. As shown in Fig. 1a, one characteristic peak at ∼12.2° from layered birnessite-type MnO2 (JCPDS No. 80-1098) can be confirmed in addition to those from ZnO and current collector substrate. Raman spectrum in Fig. 1b shows that except for the peaks at 332 and 437 cm−1 of single-crystalline ZnO,38 the others are well indexed to MnO2. Raman bands at 655 and 577 cm−1 can be recognized as the symmetric stretching vibration (Mn–O) of the MnO6 groups and the (Mn–O) stretching vibration in the basal plane of MnO6 sheet, respectively.40 No Raman signals of carbon were detected when the recording wavelength was extended up to 2000 cm−1, indicating the complete consumption of carbon. The obtained MnO2@ZnO core-shell nanowires are still well aligned on the substrate on a large scale, as displayed in Fig. 1c. A close SEM examination demonstrates the uniform coverage of MnO2 nanoflakes on ZnO nanowire surfaces (Fig. 1d and inset). Cross-sectional image of the array shown in Fig. 1e unambiguously reveals the entire and intimate coating of each ZnO nanowire with flaky MnO2. To investigate the oxidation state of Mn and further confirm the composition, XPS of the array was recorded, as illustrated in Fig. 1f. The Mn 2p, Mn 3s and O 1s spectra are individually shown in the inset. The peak located at 529.8 eV is characteristic of O element in oxide.41 The Mn 2p3/2 peak is centered at 642.4 eV and Mn 2p1/2 peak at 654.0 eV, with a spin-energy separation of 11.6 eV, which are in good accordance with previous data observed in MnO2.40,41 The Mn 3s spectrum shows doublet peaks that result from the parallel spin coupling between the electrons in 3s and 3d orbitals. The splitting width is 4.73 eV, indicating that Mn oxidation state is 4 on the basis of an approximately linear relationship between the Mn 3s splitting widths and the Mn oxidation states.42

After the formation of MnO2@ZnO core-shell nanowire array, the second 3D interfacial reaction was applied to fabricate NiO–MnO2 hybrid tubular array. This interfacial reaction is enabled by the mutually promoted reactions of Ni2+ hydrolysis and ZnO etching by H+ ions at the nanowire/solution interface. It is well known that Ni2+ can hydrolyze and give rise to proton (H+), especially under hydrothermal conditions. Since MnO2 nanoflakes grown on ZnO nanowires (Scheme 1, step 1) are interpenetrated and form a highly porous structure, H+ is believed to access nanowire/solution interface very easily, which initiates the dissolution of ZnO nanowires. In turn, the consumption of H+ by interfacial ZnO would accelerate the hydrolysis of Ni2+, in this case, even the concentration of Ni2+ is not as high as the general level for homogeneous nucleation, nickel hydroxide could heterogeneously nucleate at the interface and subsequently stretches out through the voids of MnO2 nanoflake networks. With the continuous dissolution of ZnO in the vicinity of the interface, more and more nickel hydroxides generate due to the accelerated Ni2+ hydrolysis, finally, nickel hydroxide–MnO2 tubular arrays can be obtained. After further annealing, nickel hydroxide is readily converted into NiO, and NiO–MnO2 tubular arrays are attained accordingly. As displayed in Fig. 2a, NiO flexible nanoflakes densely cover on MnO2 and are interconnected crossing the ordered arrays, filling nearly all the void spaces. The underlying MnO2 can still be identified due to the contrast difference, as denoted by dashed circles in Fig. 2b. The flaky morphology of NiO is inherited from nickel hydroxide, which in general grows into two-dimensional nanostructures due to its layered crystal structure. Raman spectrum in Fig. 2c reveals that in addition to the peak at ∼655 cm−1 from MnO2,40 the others can be well indexed to pure NiO. In detail, the first three bands have vibrational origin and correspond to one-phonon (1P) transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) modes (at ∼515 cm−1), two-phonon (2P) TO + LO (at ∼1008 cm−1) and 2LO (at ∼1153 cm−1) modes. The last strong band at 1514 cm−1 is due to a two-magnon (2M) scattering.43 The absence of ZnO Raman peaks reveals the successful dissolution of ZnO single-crystal nanowires, as expected.

It should be pointed out that the second 3D interfacial reaction occurs at the interface between the pre-grown MnO2 and ZnO nanowires, thereby the post-grown NiO nanoflakes have the same “roots” to MnO2 nanoflakes, which would make the hybrid structure highly integrated. Considering that the carbon layer-templated growth of MnO2 is not limited to ZnO nanowire arrays and a variety of hydrolyzable metal salts are available, the combination of the above two interfacial reactions can potentially produce a wide spectrum of functional hybrid nanostructure arrays for various applications in catalysis, sensing and energy conversion and storage, etc. One example could be MnO2/α-Fe2O3 for lithium-ion battery anode material.
The structure and morphology evolution of the hybrid array was further investigated by TEM. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, MnO2 layer of ∼50 nm thickness is deposited tightly on ZnO nanowire after the carbon-templated interfacial reaction. It is noted that some ZnO wires have already been etched at this growth stage, possibly due to the presence of HCO3− in solution (produced from the reaction between carbon and MnO4−). Completely tubular structure is observed after the second interfacial growth, as shown in Fig. 3b. Even with two components integrated, the structure is still highly uniform with straight and clear tube walls. Enlarged TEM image (Fig. 3c and inset) from the tube surface clearly demonstrates that NiO nanoflakes are porous (2–5 nm) but structurally continuous. The pores are generated because of the loss of water from the structure during the thermal decomposition of nickel hydroxide. The flake thickness is determined less than 10 nm from the cross sections (see black arrows). Dark-field STEM image of two tubular structures is selected in Fig. 3d for EDX analysis. Two different positions (P1: inner flakes; P2: outer flakes) were detected and the results are shown in Fig. 3e. Note that carbon and Cu signals are from the carbon-supported Cu grid. While the inner nanoflakes contain both Ni and Mn elements, the outer flakes are lack of Mn, in well coincidence with our structure design protocol and further confirming that the growth of nickel hydroxide started from the MnO2/ZnO interface. The presence of Zn traces should be ascribed to the residual Zn species, but it does not affect the electrochemical performance of hybrid structure.

To test the electrochemical capacitive performance of the MnO2–NiO tubular array, cyclic voltammogram (CV) was firstly recorded at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). The CV of pristine MnO2 tubular array is also shown for comparison. The CV measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system using saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference and platinum foil as the counter-electrode. For pure MnO2, the CV curve exhibits rectangular-like shape without obvious redox peaks; the capacitive behavior of MnO2 can be ascribed to surface cation (Li+) adsorption from electrolyte and possible intercalation/deintercalation of Li+.26 With the NiO integrated, the CV of hybrid array demonstrates distinct difference. While there is no obvious CV shape change within the potential window of −0.2∼0.2 V, a pair of well-defined redox peaks at 0.33 and 0.46 V can be clearly observed, which are due to the reversible reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+ associated with anions OH−: NiO + OH− ↔ NiOOH + e−.30,34 The CV integrated area of hybrid array is apparently larger than that of pristine MnO2 array; this will lead to significant increase in the pseudocapacitance. The specific capacitances of both MnO2–NiO and MnO2 tubular arrays were further calculated from charge-discharge profiles. Fig. 4b presents their charge–discharge curves in the potential range of −0.2∼0.6 V at current density of 8.5 mA cm−2. The voltage plateaus for MnO2–NiO array match well with the peaks observed in the CV curve. The charging/discharging times are nearly the same, indicating superior reversibility of the redox reaction. The Carea is further estimated to be 0.35 F cm−2, which is nearly 3.5 times that of our pristine MnO2 tubular array (0.101 F cm−2). This value is also 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional carbonaceous materials (10–40 μF cm−2) and much greater than previously reported results of most directly-grown pseudocapacitive nanostructure films such as NiO–TiO2 nanotube array (2.5–4 mF cm−2),34Ni–NiO core – shell inverse opal film (∼10 mF cm−2),37TiO2 nanotube film (0.538–0.911 mF cm−2)27 and electrodeposited MnO2 nanosheet film (0.125 F cm−2).36 The high Carea of our hybrid array results from the effective integration of nanoflake-shaped MnO2 and NiO into an ordered and tubular structure directly on current collector. In detail, the constituent high-capacitance pseudocapacitive materials grow densely on entire electrode surface without electrochemically-inert additives; this not only saves the active spaces but might also offer greatly improved electron transfer pathways. Furthermore, the porous nature of NiO nanoflakes and interspacing void formed by interconnected flakes as well as the tubular structure can allow an effective contact between the electrolyte (Li+, OH−) and the two active materials, which guarantees adequate ion supply for redox reactions.

To further understand the fundamental behavior of supercapacitor electrodes, EIS analysis was measured and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. The impedance spectra of hybrid MnO2–NiO and pure MnO2 arrays are almost similar in form with a semicircle at a higher frequency region and a spike at lower frequency. EIS data were analyzed using the complex nonlinear least-squares (CNLS) fitting method26a on the basis of the equivalent circuit consisting of a combined resistance Re (ionic resistance of electrolyte, intrinsic resistance of substrate, and contact resistance at the active material/current collector interface), a charge-transfer Rct, Warburg resistance Zw, and double-layer capacitance Cdl on the grain surface (inset of Fig. 4c). Re and Rct can be obtained from the Nyquist plots, where the high frequency semicircle intercepts the real axis at Re and (Re + Rct), respectively. The slope of the 45° portion of the curve at low frequency is Zw, which is a result of the frequency dependence of ion diffusion/transport in the electrolyte to the electrode surface.24Fig. 4c shows that Re and Zw values are almost the same for both arrays; a major difference is the charge-transfer resistance Rct. The Rct values are calculated to be ∼18.7 and 54 Ω for MnO2–NiO and pristine MnO2 tubular arrays, respectively. This clearly demonstrates that more facile charge transfer is achieved by integrating NiO nanoflakes into the tubular array architecture. The reduced Faraday resistance rendered by the intriguing material combination and the hierarchical structure leads to enhanced electrochemical reaction, contributing greatly to the observed large Carea value of MnO2–NiO hybrid array.
In addition to the much higher Ca, the MnO2–NiO hybrid array also demonstrates superior cycling performance to pristine MnO2 array. Fig. 4d illustrates the discharge capacitance of the above two arrays as a function of cycle number at the current density of 8.5 mA cm−2. The hybrid array exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with only 3.6% deterioration of the initial capacitance after 1500 cycles. The pristine MnO2 array, however, has 9.2% capacitance loss after cycling. It is believed that the intimate “root contact” of NiO flakes with MnO2 flakes and the networking of MnO2 by filling in the array voids with flexible interpenetrated NiO flakes can help to maintain the structural integrity and mechanical adhesion with current collector, thus be beneficial to long-term electrochemical cycling.
Good rate capability is an important requirement for supercapacitors. The MnO2–NiO hybrid array was purposely tested at different current densities and the galvanostatic discharge curves are shown in Fig. 5a. The Carea value versus current density plots are also presented in Fig. 5b, in which the times required for full discharging at each current density are indicated. Since the reversible redox reaction is a highly diffusion-controlled process, the capacitance will decrease at fast charge-discharge rate. The Carea at current densities of 5, 8.5, 15, 20, and 25 mA cm−2 is determined ∼0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.22 F cm−2, respectively. At the current density as high as 25 mA cm−2 (discharge within 8.8 s), 55% of the capacitance at 5 mA cm−2 can be retained, still much higher than state-of-the-art carbonaceous materials and most pseudocapacitive nanostructure arrays.27,34,36,37 We tested the electrochemical performance of pure MnO2 tubular array at higher current densities, but found that its capacitance decreased dramatically when the current larger than 10 mA cm−2 (data not shown). The superior rate capability of MnO2–NiO hybrid tubular array can be attributed to its substantially reduced charge-transfer resistance (ensuring fast redox kinetics) as evidenced by EIS. In Fig. 5b the areal energy density (de) of hybrid array is also plotted versus the current density. The hybrid tubular array consistently demonstrates energy density with the order of magnitude of 10−5Wh cm−2. The de at 5 and 25 mA cm−2 is ∼3.56 and 1.96 × 10−5Wh cm−2, respectively, which are several times that of some carbon fiber and carbon nanotube-based supercapacitors.44,45

To investigate the electrochemical performance of hybrid array at high rates, we further tested the cycling performance at a much larger current density of 15 mA cm−2 (in general, 5–10 times that of commonly used value); the result is shown in Fig. 6a. After 1500 cycles, the tubular hybrid array still retains 87.5% of the initial capacitance with >96% Coulombic efficiency from the 10th cycle (finally 99%). The last 20 charge–discharge curves are also displayed in Fig. 6b, which exhibit almost the same shape, revealing excellent long-term cyclability of the hybrid array electrode even under fast charge–discharge conditions.

4. Conclusions
In summary, MnO2–NiO tubular arrays assembled by thin nanoflakes on current collector have been successfully fabricated based on two-step 3D interfacial reactions using ZnO nanowire arrays as the sacrificial template. The proposed interfacial reaction route is general and might be easily extendable to synthesize various functional hybrid nanostructure arrays. As a demonstration of the application potential, the electrochemical performance of such a hybrid array as supercapacitor electrode was systematically investigated. The results show that MnO2–NiO tubular arrays exhibit much higher areal capacitance than conventional carbonaceous materials and many directly-grown pseudocapacitive nanostructure films; they also displayed good cyclability and rate capability. Our present work indicates that integrated tubular arrays constructed by two or more high-capacitance pseudocapacitive materials hold great promise in thin-film supercapacitors and other kinds of electrochemical devices.
