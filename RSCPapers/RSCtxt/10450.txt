    , Accepted 10th September 2012First published on 12th September 2012AbstractWe synthesized a series of new low-band gap donor–acceptor copolymers containing 4,4′-bis(alkyl)-[6,6′-bithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolylidene]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione. This acceptor unit, so-called dithienoketopyrrole (DTKP), is an analogue of isoindigo, the phenyl rings of which are replaced by thiophenes. Donor moieties such as benzodithiophene, cyclopentadithiophene, fluorene, and dithienothiophene are polymerized with DTKP in an alternating fashion by Stille or Suzuki–Miyaura coupling methods. Exceedingly low-band gaps (Eg = 1.0–1.6 eV) were achieved in these copolymers through internal charge transfer interactions between the donor and acceptor moieties. The structural, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the resultant copolymers were characterized, and field-effect transistor (FET) mobilities were measured. The copolymers showed electronic absorption spectra extending to the near infrared region (600–1400 nm) with absorption maxima at 745–971 nm, along with a low-lying LUMO of −3.8 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated high planarity for the copolymer backbone when compared to that of its phenyl-isoindigo counterparts. FET hole mobilities on the order of 10−4 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained, demonstrating a feasibility to use them in organic photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Harvesting solar energy by photovoltaic cells, which is the cleanest and most abundant energy source, is one of the frontier research topics in modern sciences.1,2 In particular, organic photovoltaics (OPV) have attracted immense interest due to their many advantages over their inorganic counterparts such as flexibility, colorfulness, light weight, solution processability, and large active area.3,4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs has reached as high as 10.3%, as demonstrated by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. in 2011;5 however, the PCE is still almost half of the standard inorganic photovoltaics. Towards the improvement of PCE, materials have to simultaneously meet several strict criteria such as broad and intense photoabsorption, suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels, prompt charge separation, and efficient charge transport. OPVs based on blends of p-type conjugated polymers/oligomers and n-type fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) have been investigated extensively in the past decade.6,7 In this context, low-band gap polymers are particularly important because of their ability to absorb in a broad range of wavelengths including visible, near infrared (NIR), and infrared regions of the solar spectrum. One of the most popular strategies for achieving low-band gap in polymers is to utilize the internal charge transfer interactions through the incorporation of rationally selected donor and acceptor moieties into the polymer backbone in an alternating fashion.8–18
Isoindigo (IDG) is a relatively new molecular unit with strong electron accepting properties and large optical transition dipoles suitable for organic electronic materials.19–23 The presence of strong electron donors in conjugation can induce charge transfer interactions in IDG derivatives, which increase the absorption intensity and push the absorption band to the near infrared region.24 Recent reports revealed that electronic and optoelectronic devices with high PCE and/or charge carrier mobility are fabricated by using isoindigo-based polymers and oligomers.20,25 For instance, M. R. Andersson et al. has reported a PCE of 4.5% for thiophene-IDG copolymer (PTI-1).26 Bithiophene-IDG copolymer (IIDDT) exhibited a hole mobility as high as 1.06 cm2 V−1 s−1.27 Benzodithiophene-thiophene-IDG copolymer (PBDT-TIT) also showed a high PCE of 4.2%.22 The highest PCE of IDG copolymer reported so far is 6.3% realized by terthiophene-IDG copolymer (P3TI).23 There are many examples of IDG-based copolymers in combination with thiophene, fluorene, and phenyl groups.28,29 However, the IDG unit is slightly twisted (vide infra), because of the structural repulsion between the proton of the phenyl and the oxygen of the ketopyrrole moieties. This twist may reduce the donor–acceptor interactions, effective conjugation length, and the stacking interactions of the polymer chains adversely affecting the device performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose to use 4,4′-bis(alkyl)-[6,6′-bithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolylidene]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione units, the so-called dithienoketopyrrole (DTKP), instead of IDG for the development of low-band gap conjugated polymers. DTKP consists of five-membered heterocyclic aromatic rings, which can induce higher planarity to the molecular plane than that of arylene groups, leading to enhanced charge delocalization via a quinoidal structure of the backbone. Since one patent30 describing the synthesis of DTKP and its application to organic electronics was disclosed at the beginning of 2011, no scientific papers have been published yet. However, very recently in 2012, R. S. Ashraf and I. McCulloch et al. have reported the synthesis and field-effect transistor (FET) properties of DTKP-benzothiadiazole copolymers, which revealed an unprecedented ambipolar nature with comparable hole and electron mobilities over 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1,31 demonstrating the intriguing electronic features of the DTKP-based copolymer family.
Here, we report the synthesis of a series of new copolymers with exceedingly low-band gaps consisting of DTKP in conjunction with typical donor units such as benzodithiophene (BDT), cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), fluorene (FLO), and dithienothiophene (DTT). Their optical and electronic properties were investigated and discussed using ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, FET analysis, and density functional theory (DFT).

To ensure the solubility, n-octyl or branched 2-ethylhexyl side chains were attached to the nitrogen atom of 4,4′-bis(alkyl)-[6,6′-bithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolylidene]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione acceptor monomer units. Starting from commercially available 3-bromothiophene, the alkylated thiophen-3-amine monomers 1 and 2 were obtained with 61% and 53% yields, respectively.32 Let us note two cautions: (1) in this copper-catalyzed amination in deanol, the deanol byproduct was easily produced without vigorous stirring, and (2) monomers 1 and 2 quickly decomposed in the presence of light and air. After the cyclization of these monomers, alkylated-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5,6-dione monomers 3 and 4 were obtained with 56% and 51% yields, respectively. These monomers show good stability against exposure to light and air. When the keto parts of monomers 3 and 4 were reduced to yield respective dihydro-monomers 5 and 6, the reported procedure30 did not give the desired products, because the hydrazone intermediate was de-cyclized by heating at more than 50 °C in the presence of a strong base. Instead we used the hydrazine reagent 1,2-bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)hydrazine (BTBSH) for this Wolff–Kishner type reduction. BTBSH was prepared according to the literature method.33 The hydrazone intermediate appended with BTBSH shows higher stability than the hydrazone intermediate prepared by the patent method,30 as evident from the absence of de-cyclization even after heating up to 100 °C with a strong base. The Wolff–Kishner type reduction was monitored by TLC and 1H NMR analysis. As a consequence, the alkylated-4H,6H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-one monomers 5 and 6 were obtained as pale-yellow compounds with moderate yields of 78% and 67%, respectively. The monomers color, however, turned slowly to red, because of the decomposition even under ambient conditions. After the coupling reaction of alkylated-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5,6-dione and alkylated-4H,6H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-one, the obtained monomers 7 and 8 were brominated and (E)-2,2′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(alkyl)-[6,6′-bithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolylidene]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-diones 9 and 10 were successfully obtained as wine-red solids with 76% and 53% yields, respectively. The stanylbenzodithiophene monomers 13 and 14 were prepared according to the literature.10,34–37 The stanyl-CPDT and DTT monomers 15 and 16 were also synthesized by following the reported procedure.38–41 The polymerizations were carried out under Stille cross-coupling reactions or Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling with 1:1 monomer ratio, using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, to give a green material. The crude copolymers were purified by passing through a column filled with metal removal silica gel and followed by precipitation from chloroform solution by adding methanol or acetone to yield grass-green-colored solids. Chemical structures of copolymers are shown in Fig. 1. Copolymers P1, P2, and P3 were soluble in common organic solvents like chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. Copolymers P4 and P7 were soluble in chloroform. On the other hand, the high molecular weight part of the copolymer P5 was insoluble in any solvent and therefore only the oligomer component was purified. Copolymer P6 containing the DTKP unit with all n-octyl side chains was not soluble in any solvents. The chemical structures of the copolymers were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw), number-average molecular weights (Mn), and polydispersity indices (PDI) of the copolymers as listed in Table 1 were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 40 °C using polystyrenes as standards with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. All copolymers show strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation in THF. Thus it was necessary to prepare dilute solutions for the determination of accurate Mw and Mn reflecting the single polymer chain. Hereafter we discuss the optical and electronic properties of the soluble copolymers: P1, P2, and P3.

Polymer thermal stability
Thermal stability of polymers is a very important criterion for their use in electronic devices. Thermal analysis of the copolymers was carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. DSC thermograms of P1, P2, and P3 were featureless from 25 to 300 °C, providing no evidence of any phase transitions. This indicates that these polymers have good thermal stability, suitable for robust organic electronic devices.
Optical properties
Electronic absorption spectra of polymers in the chloroform solutions and drop-cast films were measured, and the details are summarized in Table 1. All polymers exhibited two characteristic absorption bands consisting of a sharp one at the high energy region (350–550 nm) and a more intense, broader one at the low energy region (600–1400 nm). DFT calculations with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) revealed that the polymer absorption consists of two distinct π–π* transitions (Fig. 2 and S1†). The lower energy band corresponds to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state (S0–S1), whereas the higher energy one corresponds to the allowed transition from the ground state to the third excited state (S0–S3). The absorption spectra of P1–P3 in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2a, which are more red-shifted than those obtained from the DFT calculation. The S0–S3 transitions of all three polymers were having similar features with absorption maxima at 434, 460, and 410 nm for P1, P2, and P3 respectively. Interestingly, the absorption features of P1 and P2 (λmax = 859 and 971 nm, respectively) are significantly different from that of the P3 polymer (λmax = 745 nm). Both P1 and P2 absorptions were broad and intense with highly red-shifted over the visible range when compared to that of P3 within the visible region. The nature of the absorption spectra of P1 and P2 at longer wavelengths indicates the possibility of internal charge transfer (ICT) states rather than the S0–S1 transition. It is known that the electron donating abilities of the donor chromophores increase in the order of FLO < BDT < CPDT.14,21,29 Fluorene is a very weak donor and might be unable to form CT complexes with the DTKP acceptor. On the other hand, both BDT and CPDT are strong donors and efficiently form ICT with the acceptor. Accordingly, it is clear that the red-shift in the absorption maximum as well as the absorption intensities of the longer wavelength bands are directly proportional to the strength of donor moieties in these polymers. Further insights into the optical properties were provided from the DFT calculation (Fig. 3). It revealed that the dihedral angle between CPDT and DTKP is <0.04° (P2), while that between BDT and DTKP is 7–12° (P1). Higher planarity between the donor and acceptor moieties in P2 also contributed to its red-shifted absorption maximum relative to that of P1. The absorption spectra of P1–P3 in the film state are shown in Fig. 2b. In the case of P1 and P2, the absorption at longer wavelengths showed a blue-shift of 24 and 23 nm respectively, when compared to that of the solution state. Similarly, the oscillator strength of the longer wavelength peak relative to the shorter one was also decreased in the film state. On the other hand, no shift was observed in the case of P3 in the film state. In addition to that, the relative oscillator strength of the two peaks of P3 remained almost the same. This observation further reiterates that CT complexes were formed in P1 and P2, and are absent in P3. Since the CT state was highly sensitive to the environment, loss of solvation energy due to the absence of solvent could destabilize the CT state, resulting in blue-shift of the absorption maximum and decrease of the oscillator strength of the CT band. However, the onset of the absorption has red-shifted by 50 nm in P3 and by 100 nm in P1 and P2 which could be attributed to the partly enhanced planarization and/or stacking of the copolymers in the film state. The smaller change of the onset for P3 suggests poor stacking in the film state than that of P1 and P2. This could be due to steric hindrance exerted by the alkyl chains at the 9-position of fluorene, which is orthogonal to the polymer π-plane.

The optical band gap energies (Eoptg) of the copolymers were estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra in the film state. All copolymers exhibited Eoptg ranging between 1.0 and 1.6 eV, and the details are summarized in Table 1. Eoptg of P1–P3 were found to be 1.1, 1.0 and 1.6 eV, which were much smaller than those of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT (1.9–2.0 eV). Such low-band gaps in P1 and P2 could be attributed to the presence of the ICT state. It must be noted that even in the case of P3, where the ICT state is absent, the optical band gap is significantly low, indicating the usefulness of DTKP as an acceptor unit for the development of p-type polymers for OPV.
Electrochemical characterization
It is well-recognized that organic semiconducting materials should have delocalized electron-density-state and appropriate levels of HOMO and LUMO to facilitate efficient transport of holes and electrons, respectively. The HOMO levels of polymers were measured as the ionization energy threshold by UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Fig. S5†) and are summarized in Table 1. The ionization energy threshold was estimated to be −4.9 eV, −4.8 eV, and −5.4 eV for P1, P2, and P3, respectively. For comparison, the threshold of P3HT was also measured and it was found to be −4.7 eV. The LUMO levels of the copolymers were estimated by adding Eoptg to HOMO, as listed in Table 1. The energy diagrams of P1 through P3, P3HT, and PC61BM are given in Fig. 4, showing all new copolymers with the deeper HOMO levels than that of P3HT, which is beneficial for obtaining improved open-circuit voltage for the OPV devices.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
To provide more insight into the structural and electronic features of the copolymers, distributions of HOMO and LUMO of P1–P3 were calculated using the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and are shown in Fig. 5a. Interestingly, the HOMO is mostly distributed along the polymer backbone, whereas the LUMO is localized on the DTKP moiety. This is consistent with the HOMO–LUMO distribution observed in several p-type donor–acceptor copolymers. Among the copolymers, better delocalization of HOMO was obtained for P2, which is in accordance with its extended electronic absorption spectrum over the NIR range with the lower Eoptg of 1.0 eV. DFT calculations were also carried out to compare the planarity of the IDG and DTKP containing polymer backbones. The optimized structures of BDT-IDG-BDT and BDT-DTKP-BDT trimers are presented in Fig. 5b. Their structures from the horizontal view clearly indicate that the backbone of the DTKP-containing oligomer has a more planar structure than that of the IDG-containing oligomer. As mentioned in the Introduction section, the steric effect exerted between the proton on the phenyl ring and carbonyl oxygen is responsible for the twisted structure in the IDG unit, which is absent in the case of DTKP. In addition, the large dihedral angle of 23° between BDT and IDG was reduced to 7–12° by replacing IDG with DTKP. These observations revealed the superiority of DTKP over IDG for obtaining low-band gap copolymers with better planarity and extended conjugation length.

Device fabrication and characterization
The semiconducting properties of copolymers were characterized in bottom-gate/top-contact FET devices. They were fabricated by spin-coating onto a SiO2 (200 nm)/n-doped Si substrate, where n-doped Si and SiO2 were used as the gate electrode and dielectric insulator, respectively. In this work, copolymer films were dried under vacuum and measured before and after thermal annealing at 160 °C for 10 min. Fig. S2† shows the transfer curves at a drain–source voltage (VDS) of −100 V or −90 V and output curves at a gate voltage of −100 V or −80 V. All copolymers showed p-channel FET characteristics, which is consistent with the DFT results. The hole mobility (μhole) was obtained from the saturated regime and the values are listed in Table 2. The hole mobilities were increased in the order of P1 < P3 < P2. The CPDT-DTKP copolymer (P2) showed the highest hole mobility of 5.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, reflecting the delocalization of HOMO on the planar backbone structure and consequent good intermolecular overlap of the π-orbitals. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the films are shown in Fig. S3,† in which fiber-like morphologies are manifested in the order of P1, P2, and P3 with surface roughness of 1.4, 1.0, and 0.47 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the more pronounced intermolecular stacking in P1 and P2 than P3 suggested from optical spectroscopy and DFT calculation. In particular, the hole mobility of P2 was increased twice by thermal annealing compared with that without annealing. This trend was observed as well for the IDG containing copolymer.42 The hole mobility of the BDT-DTKP copolymer was still two orders of magnitude smaller than that of BDT-IDG copolymers, where the latter were implemented by octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS) surface treatment, the use of trichloroethylene (TCE) as a solvent, and slow drying under TCE vapor.27 So far there are few choices of the solvent for our copolymers because of the solubility. However, it can be addressed by fine-tuning of the side chain and we believe that the mobilities would be further improved to make these polymers suitable for photovoltaic device applications.

Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Kanto Chemicals, TCI, or WAKO Chemical Co., and were used as received. The hydrazine reagent, 1,2-bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)hydrazine (BTBSH), for this Wolff–Kishner-type reduction was synthesized by the literature method.33 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(n-octyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]dithiophene and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]dithiophene were synthesized by adapting methods reported in the literature.10,34–37 Column chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60N (spherical, neutral) from Kanto Chemicals, or NH silica gel from Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd. Air- and water-sensitive synthetic steps were performed in a dried nitrogen or argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. All monomers were carefully purified prior to use in the polymerization.
Characterization
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL 400SS (400 MHz) or EX-270 (270 MHz) spectrometer operating at 100 MHz for 13C and 270 or 400 MHz for 1H, respectively. The measurements were done at 25 °C in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane or residual chloroform peaks as the internal reference standard for 1H and 13C chemical shifts respectively. Data were represented as follows: chemical shifts in ppm (δ = 0 ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = double-doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, br = broad), coupling constant (J) in Hertz (Hz), and integration. Mass spectra were obtained on a FAB+ MS, JEOL the MS station JMS-700 with m-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the standard matrix. Elemental analysis was performed with a Yanagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd. YANACO CHN CORDER (MT-5) for C, H, and N elements, a Yanagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd. trace element analysis instrument for the S element, and a DIONEX DX-500 for Br and S elements. Molecular weights of polymers were determined using the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method with polystyrene standards. GPC analysis was performed with polymer/tetrahydrofuran (THF) (HPLC grade) solution at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 at 40 °C, on a HITACHI L-2130, L-2455, L-2530 chromatography instrument with Shodex KF-804L/KF-805L (Shodex Co., Japan) connected to a refractive index detector. The purification of tin compounds was performed using the recycling preparative HPLC system on a Japan Analytical Industry Co., Ltd. LC-9210NEXT with JaiGel-1H/-2H (eluent CHCl3). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was performed on a SEIKO Instrument Inc., EXSTAR6000 (DSC6200). Electronic absorption spectra were recorded using a JASCO V-570 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer with 1 cm path length quartz cells for solution and drop-cast or spin-coated films on quartz plates for solid state measurements.

Synthetic procedures for monomers. 
Synthesis of N-octylthiophen-3-amine (1). 
3-Bromothiophene (4.0 g, 2.45 × 10−2 mol), Cu (0.171 g, 2.45 × 10−3 mol), CuI (0.467 g, 2.45 × 10−3 mol), K3PO4·H2O (12.2 g, 4.91 × 10−2 mol), n-octylamine (6.0 ml, 3.68 × 10−2 mol), and deanol (24.5 ml) were added to a 100 ml dried flask at room temperature in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 48.5 h under nitrogen. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. 20 ml of water was added and the mixture was extracted with diethylether (3 × 50 ml).

General procedure for the synthesis of copolymers. 
The synthetic route for copolymers is shown in Scheme 4. Polymerization steps for P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, and P7 were carried out through the palladium(0)-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reactions. Polymerization steps for P3 were performed through the palladium(0)-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. For Stille cross-coupling reaction, 1 equiv. of dibromo monomers and 1 equiv. of bistrimethylstannanyl monomers were added into anhydrous xylene and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (9/1, 0.05 mol dm−3) in a 20 ml Schlenk flask. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (2.5 mol%) was transferred into the mixture in a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 130 °C for 4–6 h, and then an excess amount of bromobenzene and trimethyl(phenyl)tin were added to end-cap the trimethylstannyl and bromo groups for 1 h, respectively. After adding a four times larger amount of xylene than the reaction solution, the reaction mixture was cooled to 40 °C and added slowly into a vigorously stirred ten times larger volume of methanol than the diluted reaction mixture. The polymers were collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. The dried crude polymers were dissolved in CHCl3 (around 200 ml) and further purified by column chromatography on neutral silica gel and six layered interleave NH silica with a NH2 silica gel layer for removing the metallic impurities. The obtained CHCl3 solution was filtered through celite and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The remaining solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of CHCl3 and reprecipitated by six times larger amount of acetone than dissolved solution to remove oligomers. The precipitate was filtered using a membrane filter and dried under vacuum. For Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, 1 equiv. of dibromo monomers and 1 equiv. of diboronate ester monomers were added into anhydrous xylene (0.15 mol dm−3) in a 20 ml Schlenk flask. 3 equiv. of 2 M K2CO3 aq. and 0.2 equiv. of Aliquat 336 were added for base and phase-transfer catalyst, respectively. After mixing all reagents without catalyst, freeze–pump–thaw cycling was carried out three times. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (2.5 mol%) was transferred into the mixture in a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 3 h. The end-cap procedure, reaction processing, and purification were same as that of Stille cross-coupling reaction.

UV photo electron spectroscopy measurement
The optical band gap was determined from the onset of the absorption band edge. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was estimated by UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement. UPS was performed on an AC-2 of RIKEN KEIKI Co., Ltd. For the UPS measurement, thin films of the polymers were drop-cast on an ITO-coated glass surface from chlorobenzene (CB) or CHCl3 solution and it was completely dried before mounting on the spectrometer. Photoelectrons emitted from the film were detected after illuminating the film with UV radiation. Using a photon energy increase with an interval of 0.1 eV, the photoelectron counts were measured.
Organic field-effect transistor (OFET) measurements
FETs were fabricated in a top-contact configuration on a heavily n-doped Si wafer with 200 nm thermally grown SiO2 (the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer is Ci = 17.3 nF cm−2). The substrate surface was treated with piranha solution for 10 min, subjected to cleaning using ultrasonication in deionized water (twice) and isopropanol (twice). The cleaned substrates were dried and then treated with plasma for 20 min. Thin films of the copolymer were deposited on the treated substrates by spin coating (1500 rpm for P1 and P3, 800 rpm for P2) using a 0.5 wt% of P1 and P3 chloroform solution and 1.0 wt% of P2 chlorobenzene solution. On top of the organic film, about 50 nm thick gold was deposited as source and drain contacts through a shadow mask. The channel width (W) of drain and source is 3 mm. The drain–source channel length (L) was changed as 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μm and an optimized length arising from the trade-off between contact resistance and grain size was selected by evaluating the output curve. Characteristics of the FET devices were measured at room temperature under ambient conditions with a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor analyzer system.
Conclusions
DTKP-based new low-band gap polymers were designed and synthesized in combination with various donor units such as BDT, CPDT, FLO, and DTT. The DTKP unit acts as a strong electron acceptor and forms charge transfer complexes with BDT and CPDT. This leads to the enhancement of absorption intensity as well as extension of the absorption spectra towards NIR and IR regions (600–1400 nm), along with lowering HOMO, LUMO, and optical band gap. From the DFT calculation, the DTKP unit and its copolymers have better planarity than that of the isoindigo unit and its corresponding polymers. The preliminary FET experiments exhibited a moderate hole mobility of 5.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2, promising the application of these copolymers in organic electronic devices.
