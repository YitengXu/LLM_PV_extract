    , Accepted 12th October 2010First published on 29th November 2010AbstractIn this work, we use rf magnetron sputtering to deposit at room temperature a ZnO thin film on top of a photoactive material based on P3HT:PCBM blend for organic photovoltaic devices. We investigate the influence of the sputtering conditions on the ZnO crystallinity, on the substrate layer nanoscale morphology and on the photovoltaic device performances. We show that, under appropriate sputtering conditions, the modification of the P3HT:PCBM film causes no functional damage of the photoactive layer, and leads to an improved performance of the photovoltaic devices.
A. Introduction

Zinc oxide (ZnO) has recently received much attention as an interfacial material for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.1,2 This material is well-known as an n-type semiconductor with good optical transparency, which makes it very promising for highly efficient and stable organic devices.3–6 Compared to the more frequently used TiO2 semiconductor, ZnO has a higher electron mobility that can lead to a lower series resistance in the device. Also, the synthesis method of ZnO is easier than that of TiO2, which is essential for industrial applications.7 However, for both materials, a high-temperature annealing step is often required to reach good electronic properties. This requirement hinders the use of flexible substrates and related low-cost roll-to-roll processes.8 Consequently, there is a lot of interest in growing high quality ZnO layers at low-temperature.9 In organic solar cells, ZnO is most often deposited by sol–gel processes that do not provide easily high quality homogeneous thin films with reproducible properties.10 The use of rf magnetron sputtering for ZnO deposition, which is among the most widely used industrial process for large-area coatings, has also been considered recently.11ZnO sputtering has been used successfully to grow, at low temperatures, uniform and homogeneous films with well defined c-axis orientation even when deposited at low temperatures on inorganic and polymer substrates.12 Finally, sputtering is also a compatible technology with roll-to-roll coating processes.13ZnO layers have already been deposited in a one pass room temperature process (without breaking the vacuum) to form transparent conducting electrodes on polymer-based substrate, such as PET, PEN, and polyimide films.14,15 However, the ZnO deposition on conductive organic layers requires a pronounced control of the sputtering conditions in order to preserve the electronic properties of the underlying layer.16Sputtering may indeed damage the organic layers by changing their morphology or by introducing electronically active interface defects.17 For these reasons, sputtering has been avoided so far for growing ZnO on top of the organic layer of organic photovoltaic devices.18
In this work, we used rf magnetron sputtering to grow ZnO on the top of a photoactive substrate of a conventional bulk heterojonction (BHJ) photovoltaic device. We investigate the influence of the ZnO thickness on the crystallinity, on the photoactive layer nanoscale morphology and on the photovoltaic device performance. We show that under appropriate sputtering conditions (optimization of the rf power and Ar pressure not shown here), the deposited top contact ZnO film causes no functional damage of the photoactive layer and favors the improvement of the photovoltaic performance.
(1) Device structure and elaboration
The photovoltaic cells developed here follow a conventional structure where the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-(butyric acid methylester) (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer is positioned between a glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxylenethiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) anode and a low-work-function aluminium (Al) cathode. The ZnO layer is inserted between the BHJ film and the cathode, as shown in Fig. 1.

(2) Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates (CEC20S, ≤20 Ω sq−1, 20 × 20 mm2) from Präzisions Glass & Optik GmbH were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with, sequentially, detergent deionized water (DI water), acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After UV ozone cleaning for 10 min, 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS, from Bayer Baytron Co., was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 15 min. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin-coating from a P3HT:PCBM solution (1:1 weight ratio in dichlorobenzene) to form a 120 nm thick layer. The P3HT (98.5% regioregular from Sigma Aldrich Co.) and the PCBM (PC61BM) (from Solenne BV Co.) were used as received without further purification. The ZnO target used for sputtering was purchased from Neyco Co. and had a purity of 99.999%. The diameter and the thickness of the target are 50.8 mm and 3 mm, respectively. The sputtering process was made using an Ar plasma. Before deposition, a pre-sputtering process was operated for 5 min in order to clean the ZnO target. Once the appropriate sputtering conditions were found all ZnO layers were sputtered at a constant rf power of 100 W. The pressure during deposition was fixed at about 8 × 10−3 Torr and the substrate temperature was kept below roughly 40 °C. A 120 nm thick Al top electrode was thermally evaporated onto ZnO at a pressure of about 2 × 10−6 Torr. Finally, the devices were annealed at 140 °C for 15 min under nitrogen atmosphere. This annealing step is known to improve the performances of P3HT:PCBM based-devices.19 The device active area was about 9 mm2.
(3) Materials and device characterizations
The XRD analysis was recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (40 mA, 40 kV) equipped with a Sol'X detector and using the monochromatic Cu-Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained in tapping mode on a Nanoscope Dimension 3100 from Veeco Instruments. The AFM images were taken on full devices near the Al cathode. Absorption spectroscopy was measured using a conventional UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a JEOL 6700F microscope. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the organic photovoltaic devices were measured with an HP Agilent source measurement unit, under darkness and light exposure. For the latter, a solar simulator under AM 1.5G conditions (Oriel Xenon 150 W) was used. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell using a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device performances were measured under nitrogen atmosphere for each processing condition.
B. Results and discussion

          Growth of ZnO film

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO samples for three different thicknesses of the ZnO layers (20, 54, and 100 nm) and after the thermal annealing step at 140 °C for 15 min. All patterns show diffraction peaks corresponding to ITO, ZnO and P3HT, suggesting a well defined crystalline structure for the main layers of our device. Four ITO diffraction peaks are observed and attributed to the (211), (222), (400) and (411) reflections, suggesting a polycrystalline structure for this layer. The crystallization of the P3HT:PCBM blend is characterized by the (100) P3HT diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.41°, which corresponds to the interchain spacing of 16.32 Å associated with interdigitated alkyl chains.20 The ZnO diffraction pattern is dominated by the (002) peak at 2θ ≈ 34.36° regardless of the ZnO thickness. These peaks are associated with the (002) planes of the ZnO hexagonal phase indicating a textured growth with the c-axis perpendicular to the organic substrate. This can be understood if we keep in mind that the most dense atomic planes in a hexagonal structure are the (002) ones. This is in agreement with other studies showing that ZnO is textured when grown on amorphous substrates.21,22 Using the Scherrer equation,23 we calculated that the average diameter of the ZnO crystallites is almost identical for the three samples (from 13 to 13.5 nm). However, it is important to note a reduction of the X-ray peak intensity by increasing the ZnO thickness from 20 to 100 nm. This suggests (and it will be confirmed further by AFM observations) that the surface morphology of the ZnO layers is strongly dependent on the ZnO thickness. This morphology (roughness/section oscillation amplitude and length period) may either originate from a three dimensional growth (Stranski–Krastanov like) mode of ZnO itself,24 or from the dynamics of the P3HT:PCBM film surface beneath the ZnO layer under sputtering conditions.
 Fig. 2  
            XRD patterns of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO structures. The ZnO layer was deposited by rf sputtering and has thicknesses of 20, 54, and 100 nm. 
The surface morphology of the ZnO deposited on a P3HT:PCBM blend layer was studied by SEM and AFM microscopes. Fig. 3 shows two SEM images (plan and cross-section views) of a 20 nm thick ZnO layer deposited by sputtering on the P3HT:PCBM blend. The film was found to be continuous and dense with streamer-shaped features (Fig. 3a). These features are about 300 nm large and 1 to 3 μm long and are bordered by hollow join boundaries. The cross-sectional SEM picture of the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO stack is shown in Fig. 3b. We observe that the upper interface of the P3HT:PCBM layer presents oscillations with an important amplitude. These oscillations are propagated further by the growth of the ZnO layer, as the ZnO thickness seems uniform all over the sample. In order to i) check if these oscillations are intrinsic to the deposition of the P3HT:PCBM layer or are related to the ZnO deposition, ii) evaluate and describe the roughness before and after the deposition of the ZnO layers, and iii) estimate the roughness dependence on the ZnO thickness, AFM measurements are shown in the following. In addition to XRD, these measurements will help us understanding the growth mechanisms of ZnO on top of the P3HT:PCBM active layer.

Fig. 4 shows the AFM surface typically observed before and after the ZnO deposition on top of the P3HT:PCBM layer. Figs. 4a–c show an homogeneous featureless surface of P3HT:PCBM before ZnO deposition. The roughness is rather small for an organic layer, i.e. lower than 1.1 nm RMS, as given in Table 1.

The second column shows the corresponding 3D images of the considered surfaces: (b), (e), (h), and (k). The third column show a section profile recorded along the white lines in the images from the first column: (c), (f), (i), and (l).

After the deposition of ZnO, the surface roughness increases dramatically up to about 37 nm RMS, a value which seems independent of the ZnO thickness (see Table 1). The streamer shaped features appear for the three samples and suggest a relation between the ZnO and the surface morphology of the P3HT:PCBM layer beneath (see Figs. 4d, g, j and Figs. 4e, h, k). It is fair to assume that the active layer changes its morphology during the ZnO growth, i.e. during the sputtering process. This can be understood if we keep in mind that energetic atoms from the ZnO target, arriving at the substrate, transfer their energy to the P3HT:PCBM layer. This energy may lead to an activation of the dynamics of the polymers (at least near the surface) leading to such streamer shaped features (Figs. 4d, g, and j). This dynamic (which can be regarded in terms of kinetic and potential energy) roughening of the surface evolves in time during the sputtering process. It may include a diffusion of the polymer molecules (monomers) on the surface and/or a reorganization of the polymer (chemical bonds, defects creation/annihilation, etc.). It is therefore possible that a stable state of the polymer inside P3HT:PCBM is fully reached within the time frame needed to grow 20 nm of ZnO. It appears therefore naturally that the roughness is about the same when increasing further the ZnO thickness to 54 and 100 nm (see Figs. 4d, and g). Such an hypothesis is supported by the fact that while increasing the ZnO layer thickness, fewer Zn and O atoms arriving on the film surface transfer their energy directly to the active P3HT:PCBM polymer layer which is responsible for the increasing roughness. The roughness measured on the top of the ZnO layer should be regarded therefore as a result of the increasing roughness due to the polymer dynamics and not to the increased thickness of ZnO. This explains the constant roughness for thicknesses of ZnO larger than 20 nm. The critical thickness above which the dynamics of the polymer is stopped, and above which the polymer roughness is constant, is related to the sputtering conditions. The same behavior is also observed when analyzing the peak-to-peak (PtP) vertical distance in the section profiles recorded for the surface of the four samples (see Figs. 4c, f, i and l). Once the ZnO layer is grown, this vertical distance increases as well (from 6 to about 150 nm). It is important to note that the period length of the oscillation characterizing the section profile of the samples with the 20 nm thick ZnO layer is larger than the corresponding one of the sample with 54 nm of ZnO (Fig. 4f, and i). For this reason, we may also assume that the c-axis of the ZnO textured film is more and more deviated from the z direction when increasing the ZnO thickness from 20 to 54 nm, therefore leading to a reduction of the ZnO (002) main diffraction peak. The situation is similar to that of a film with an increased mosaicity. As the mosaicity increases (in our case the oscillation period length of the P3HT:PCBM upper interface) the amount of ZnO still showing the (002) atomic planes parallel to the substrate surface decreases, which is consistent with the decrease of the (002) XRD diffraction peak.
(2) Optical characterization
In order to analyze the possibility to integrate successfully the ZnO layer in an OPV cell device, the optical properties have been also investigated. The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded for the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO stacks, and shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  The absorption spectrum of the structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO with various ZnO thicknesses (20, 54, and 100 nm). 
As for the XRD and AFM measurements, different ZnO thicknesses (20, 54, and 100 nm) were considered. The reference sample without the ZnO layer (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM) has also been investigated. All samples show three characteristic vibronic absorption peaks of semi-crystalline P3HT at 505, 550, and 600 nm.25 These results are in agreement with the XRD data. A typical optical signature of the PCBM well visible in the reference sample over the wavelength range of 320–400 nm is also observed. The optical spectroscopic measurements in Fig. 5 show a typical signature of the ZnO layers. It indicates a good optical quality of these materials. The optical band-gap of the thinnest ZnO layer (20 nm) can be estimated to be around 375 nm (3.3 eV). This value increases for the 54 nm thick ZnO film, and then decreases again when the thickness increases to 100 nm. The increase of the band-gap can be related to an improved structural quality of the 54 nm ZnO film. Indeed, although the diffraction (002) ZnO peak decreases, it is possible that defects such as oxygen vacancies or interstitial Zn atoms (by far known as the most common defects in ZnO) are reduced when the thickness increases and when the influence of the P3HT:PCBM layer decreases, which leads to an increase of the gap. For the 100 nm ZnO film, it is possible that the concentration of defects increases again which is consistent with the reduced ZnO XRD peak although the ZnO thickness is important. If the density of such defects is large enough, the atomic levels into the ZnO gap could split to form an impurity band. If this band is close enough or is partially superimposed to the conduction band, the resulting band-gap of the material shrinks and becomes smaller. This is probably the mechanism of the band gap decrease for the thickest ZnO film. Finally, an increase in the absorption over the wavelength range of 450–700 nm is found after deposition of the ZnO films. This result suggests that the ZnO films acts as an optical spacer.26

          J–V characteristics
The morphology of the photoactive and interfacial layers can have a strong impact on the photovoltaic properties of our cells. In order to investigate the effects of the ZnO on the electronic transport properties, we have performed current density–voltage (J–V) measurements under illumination (see Section B(3)) with various ZnO thicknesses (20, 54, and 100 nm), as shown in Fig. 6. J–V characteristics of a reference device with no ZnO at the interface are also included for comparison. The obtained Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE deduced from the J–V characteristics are summarized in Table 2.

We find that the short-circuit curent density (Jsc) is enhanced upon ZnO deposition for thicknesses up to 54 nm, reaching a maximum value of 8.67 mA/cm2. This enhancement may be due either to the ZnO layer behaving as an optical spacer (by modifying the electromagnetic field distribution), or to the modification of the surface roughness. The latter may indeed improve the photon harvesting by the active layer and, as a consequence, increase the short circuit current. The decrease in Jsc for the thickest ZnO layer may be due either to unfavorable field distribution or, most likely, to a significant increase in the device series resistance. The more or less pronounced S-shaped J(V) curve points out indeed the existence of an energy barrier at the interface, that impedes efficient charge collection. This barrier increases (in width) with the ZnO thickness and is responsible for the Voc and efficiency drops.27 The ZnO 20 nm thick sample gets the best results in the fourth quadrant of the J–V characteristics (inverse current, forward voltage). Added to the increase in photocurrent, the device allows a better overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the reference sample (from 2.16 to 2.34%.). However, a lower value is observed for the fill factor (FF), which is also due to the forward current behavior usually related to the series resistance in OPCs.28 In order to increase the performances of the OPC, additional studies have to be carried out. For instance, by using moderate thermal annealing, the structural and optical properties of the ZnO layer can be improved, thus increasing the OPV performances. Another way to improve the performances is to dope the ZnO films in order to decrease the series resistance of the OPV devices and help obtaining large FF factors.
C. Conclusion
In summary, rf magnetron sputtering was successfully used to deposit ZnO on top of a photoactive substrate of a conventional BHJ photovoltaic device. The influence of the sputtering conditions for different thicknesses of the grown ZnO layer was investigated. In spite of the modification of the P3HT:PCBM layer nanoscale morphology, J–V characteristics showed that, under appropriate sputtering conditions, the deposited top contact ZnO layers did not cause functional damage and can lead to an improvement of the photovoltaic performances of the device. This work can be extended for further enhanced performances by improving the ZnO film crystalline structure using moderate annealing or by doping the ZnO layer in order to decrease the resistance.
