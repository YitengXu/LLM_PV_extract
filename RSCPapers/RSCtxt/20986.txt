    , Accepted 8th January 2019First published on 9th January 2019AbstractEnhanced efficiency for generating molecular ions is essential for high-throughput and sensitive detection using mass spectrometry in clinical diagnostics and biomarker discovery. In this study, we developed a novel strategy to promote laser desorption and ionization by using photonic crystals as substrates. The WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystal, with a coupling stop band and laser wavelength, significantly enhanced the efficiency of laser desorption and ionization owing to the slow light effect and the porous structure of the inverse opal, which increased the interaction between the laser and WO3–TiO2. Furthermore, stress biomarkers were conveniently measured under atmospheric pressure by using WO3–TiO2 inverse opal as an enhanced substrate to evaluate the impact of chronic unpredictable mild stress. The universal and highly sensitive substrate has promised for application in the highly sensitive detection and quantification of biomarkers.
A photonic crystal is a class of material that can periodically modulate the dielectric constant.1 The resulting photonic stop band gives it unique abilities for the control of light propagation.2,3 Once the frequency of light is located in the band gap, the propagation is suppressed by photonic crystals. A well-known attribute of photonic crystals is the “slow photon effect”, which reduces the group velocity of the photons and light at the high and low energy edges of a photonic stop band.4,5 The photon localization and slow photon effects can greatly enhance the interaction of light and matter.6,7 Owing to this unique feature, photonic crystals have been used to design solar cells,8 water splitting materials,9 light-emitting diodes,10 and fluorescence or SERS sensitivity enhanced materials.11 In addition to the above mentioned photochemical processes, laser desorption ionization (LDI) is an energy transfer process that is used for the desorption and ionization of molecules from a target surface, and is a prerequisite for mass spectrometry (MS). By the interaction of laser radiation with nanomaterials and nanostructures, surface assisted laser desorption and ionization (SALDI) MS was developed as a simple, fast, and accurate analytical technique for the simultaneous detection of various molecules within a wide mass range.12,13 Compared to using organic dyes as the matrices, SALDI-MS not only minimizes the background interference in the low mass range, but also overcomes the problem of the poor repeatability of different locations within a sample. However, up until now, research on SALDI substrates has mainly been focused on the field enhancement, high heating rate and prolongation of the interaction time between the inorganized nanomaterials and the laser so as to promote the desorption and ionization of samples, which is difficult to achieve with high efficiency.14–16 The low efficiency means that SALDI usually needs to be performed in a vacuum environment, limiting the simple and rapid detection capabilities.
From another perspective, SALDI is in essence a photochemical process, but the interaction between the laser pulses and nanomaterials is highly nonlinear. Thus, based on the slow photon effect, the construction of a SALDI substrate with a photonic crystal can promote the efficiency of LDI for mass spectrometric detection. In this study, we proposed a new strategy to enhance the sensitivity of SALDI-MS by using a photonic crystal with an inverse opal structure and achieved detection of convenient stress biomarkers under atmospheric pressure. Here, the inverse opal photonic crystal (IOPC) of tungsten titanium oxide (WO3–TiO2) was prepared to demonstrate photonic crystal enhanced LDI. The porous structure of the inverse opal increased the interaction between the laser and WO3–TiO2.17–21 By coupling the stop band of the photonic crystal and the wavelength of the laser, the slow photons of the laser were mainly localized on the high-dielectric material WO3–TiO2 with a strong UV absorption,22–25 and therefore further enhanced the absorption and conversion of the laser energy.
The WO3–TiO2 IOPC was prepared by replicating polystyrene (PS) opal with WO3–TiO2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The replicated WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs) are shown in Fig. 1a–d, and possess a three-dimensional (3D) highly ordered structure with hexagonal close-packed spherical pores. The pores were interconnected and the porous layer below was also seen clearly. This contributed to the high quality of the PS opal templates (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†) and the uniform infiltration of the WO3–TiO2 precursor. The periodic porous structure endowed the WO3–TiO2 substrates with specific photonic stop bands, which showed reflection peaks in the spectra (Fig. 1e). Under normal incidence, the central wavelength of the stop band and the position of characteristic reflection peak is expressed by the Bragg–Snell equation:26–28 λ = 1.633d × na(1)

(e) The wavelength of the analytic laser (355 nm, purple solid line), the absorbance spectra of WO3–TiO2 (red dashed line), and the reflectance spectra of WO3–TiO2 IOPCs (green solid lines). 
In which, λ is the peak position, d is the center-to-center distance between neighboring spheres or nanopores, and na is the average refractive index of compositions. Therefore, with the increase in the PS particle diameter, the pore diameter of WO3–TiO2 IOPCs is enlarged and the corresponding reflection peak was red shifted. The WO3–TiO2 IOPC with reflection peaks at 305, 387, 427, and 534 nm were replicated from the opal templates with a PS particle diameter of 195, 230, 270, and 330 nm, and denoted as Iopal-195, Iopal-230, Iopal-270, and Iopal-330, respectively.
The phase structures of the WO3–TiO2 inverse opal were demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which showed good crystallization. The XRD pattern of the WO3–TiO2 indicated that TiO2 existed in the form of the anatase phase and rutile phase and WO3 was in the form of the monoclinic phase (Fig. S4, ESI†). The XRD data confirmed the successful preparation of WO3–TiO2. The absence of any diffraction peak ascribed to the crystal phase of WxTi1−xO2 was because WO3 accepted electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to form W (V) and the extra oxygen vacancies. The WO3–TiO2 had a distinct absorption in the ultraviolet region (200–400 nm) with the main absorption edge estimated to be about 418 nm (2.97 eV) (Fig. 1e).

Fig. 2a illustrates the use of the IOPC substrates for laser desorption and ionization. The analyte of the arginine aqueous solution (Arg, 50 mM, 10 μL) was evenly added over the substrates (10 mm × 10 mm) and dried before mass spectrometry detection. When the laser pulse hits the substrates vertically, the ionized analyte will be vaporized and then sucked into the mass analyzer. The performance of WO3–TiO2 IOPC as a substrate is shown in Fig. 2b, in which a significant molecular ion peak was detected at m/z of 175.20 and indicated that the Arg was desorbed and ionized as the proton adduct [M + H]+ by the laser. In contrast, no molecular ion signal of Arg was detected on the ITO glass substrate and a very low signal was observed on the WO3–TiO2 film without the IOPC structure, but a strong background noise was presented on both of them. The results indicated that the interaction of the laser and IOPC substrate promoted the soft ionization and desorption of the analyte.

(b) Mass spectra of Arg using ITO glass, WO3–TiO2 film without an inverse opal structure and WO3–TiO2 opal photonic crystal as substrates respectively. (c) Mass spectra, (d) signal intensity (blue bar) and S/N ratio (pink bar) for a protonated molecule of Arg using the WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystal substrates with different pore sizes. 
To investigate the effect of the photonic stop band on the laser desorption and ionization, WO3–TiO2 IOPCs with different stop band positions were used as SALDI substrates. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the substrate of Iopal-195 presented the strongest intensity for a molecular ion peak of Arg, which was about 8 times higher than the other photonic crystal substrates. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the molecular ion peak of Arg was improved as well as the intensity and was about 7 times higher than the others (Fig. 2d). Obviously, due to the stop band of photonic crystal, the enhancement of laser desorption and ionization contributed to the improvements of both signal intensity and S/N. As shown in Fig. 1e, the wavelength of the laser was at the red edge of the stop band of Iopal-195. Owing to the slow photon effect, the group velocity of the laser was significantly reduced and the slow photons were localized on the WO3–TiO2 framework with a higher refractive index, which significantly enhanced the interaction of the laser and WO3–TiO2. Furthermore, the porous structure of the inverse opal also promoted this approach. As a result, because of the strong absorption of WO3–TiO2 with the 355 nm laser, the high energy coupling and conversion enhanced the efficiency of the laser desorption and ionization. However, the stop bands of Iopal-230, Iopal-270, and Iopal-330 did not couple with the laser wavelength and the absorbance of the WO3–TiO2, and therefore did not present an enhanced laser desorption and ionization by the slow photon effect.
To better understand the efficiency of the laser desorption and ionization, we further investigated the influence of laser pulse energy and the amount of analyte when using WO3–TiO2 IOPCs as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S6 (ESI†), an identified analyte signal of [M + H]+ was presented on the substrate of Iopal-195 when the laser intensity was above 7.8 mW cm−2. The intensity of the [M + H]+ signal increased with the laser energy increase. However, the S/N increased first and then decreased when the laser intensity was above 36.9 mW cm−2 owing to the production of more fragment ions and the ionization of various impurities in the air by the high laser energy. Fig. 3b shows the relationship between the amount of Arg and the analyte signal intensity of [M + H]+. The amount of Arg refers to the molecular amount within the laser spot area (R = 107 μm). It was observed that the signal intensity increased as the amount of Arg increased from 5 to 180 pmol. The picomole magnitude sensitivity was sufficient to detect high and middle abundance biomarkers in actual samples. Here, we demonstrated the convenient detection of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) biomarkers by using WO3–TiO2 IOPC as an enhanced substrate. Depression is a common complex psychiatric disorder, but its pathophysiological mechanism is not yet fully understood. A well validated model of CUMS has been used widely for studying depression as it can mimic several human depressive symptoms.29 The confirmed biomarkers in serum associated with CUMS depression include glucose, glutamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT),30 which are measured using traditional biochemical methods at present. These methods have many problems including tedious sample pre-treatment and long biochemical reaction times. Using the WO3–TiO2 IOPC substrate, we directly detected the [M + H]+ molecular ions of glutamine at m/z of 147.15, glucose at m/z of 181.16 and 5-HT at m/z of 177.22 in a serum sample under an open environment atmosphere (Fig. 3c). However, the quantitative analysis of the biomarkers is not reliable when based solely on the intensity of the MS peak owing to the difference in ion production and collection in different experimental batches. Thus, we added a coupled internal standard quantification to measure the biomarkers in serum. As shown in Fig. 3d, the calibration curves of glutamine, glucose and 5-HT were consistent with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99 by using gluconic acid (25 Mm, 10 μL) as an internal standard. Notably, compared to the traditional biochemical quantitative methods, the experimental time was reduced from hours to several minutes by using the atmospheric SALDI MS.

(b) Signal intensity of the protonated molecule obtained using different analyte amounts and using Iopal-195 as the substrate. (c) Mass spectra of 100 μL mouse serum (concentrated to 20 μL for dripping onto the substrate). (d) Standard curve for the quantitative determination of glutamine, glucose and 5-HT in serum. The curve was prepared by analyzing reference substances of glutamine, glucose and 5-HT. 

Fig. 4 shows a demonstration of the WO3–TiO2 IOPC substrates for monitoring the level of biomarkers in serum from mice and evaluating the impact of CUMS. Glutamine is a main precursor for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamine and glutamate are inter-converted between astrocytes and neurons. This glutamine/glutamate cycle is essential for glutamine homeostasis and neurotransmitter glutamate generation and recycling. For the CUMS model group, the concentration of glutamine was above 1.068 mmol L−1 (Fig. 4b), which was considered to be a compensatory adaptation to counteract glutamate induced neurotoxicity.31 Furthermore, the concentration of glucose increased above 7.564 mmol L−1 compared to the control group (Fig. 4c), suggesting that perturbation of glycometabolism was induced by CUMS.31 Meanwhile, the concentration of 5-HT decreased below 0.026 mmol L−1 (Fig. 4d) as CUMS inhibited the synthesis of tryptophan to 5-HT.32 The results suggested that the progression of CUMS was associated with the perturbation of glycometabolism, amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism. By measuring these biomarkers in serum, we were able to observe a significant difference for the CUMS model group compared to the control group (Fig. 4e). Our IOPC substrate indicated an excellent signal enhancement when applied for the detection of biomarkers from practical samples, suggesting the promise for application of the substrate for the detection and quantification of biomarkers.

In summary, we demonstrated a new strategy to promote laser desorption and ionization using WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals and achieved convenient detection of stress biomarkers under atmospheric pressure. As SALDI substrates, the WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals enhanced the interaction between the laser and the substrates, and transferred the laser radiation energy to the sample molecules to enable them to be desorbed and ionized. The signal intensity of the analyte ion was enhanced when the laser wavelength overlapped with the red edge of the stop band due to the slow light effect. Furthermore, the levels of biomarkers of CUMS in mice serum were conveniently measured under atmospheric pressure by using WO3–TiO2 IOPC as an enhanced substrate to evaluate the impact of CUMS. It is believed that the universal and high sensitivity SALDI substrate could be promising for use in biomarker search and measuring applications using mass spectrometry.
Materials and methods
Materials
Monodisperse polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles were synthesized using boiling soap-free emulsion polymerization.33 Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT, 99.9%), tungsten chloride (WCl6, ≥98.0%) and glutamine (99%) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai). Glucose (AR), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, ≥98.0%) and glucose acid (50% in H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm group (Shanghai), Sigma (Shanghai) and 9 Ding Chemistry (Shanghai), respectively.
Preparation of polystyrene photonic crystal templates
The opal photonic crystal templates were fabricated using the vertical deposition method.34–36 ITO glass substrates were immersed vertically into the colloidal suspension of 0.1 wt% PS nanoparticles in deionized water and kept stationary at 50 °C and 30%RH. After 3–5 days, the deposited PS films were taken out and sintered at 98 °C for 2 h to make the spheres stick together.
Preparation of WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals
WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals were fabricated using template replication.37 The WO3–TiO2 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.8 g WCl6 and 1.36 g TBOT in 9.2 g ethanol and then stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The precursor solution was then infiltrated into the voids of the opals and the excess solution was removed by spinning. After drying at 45 °C for 12 h, the composite opals were calcined at 450 °C for 2.5 h to remove the PS template and obtain the WO3–TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals.
Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a QTRAP4000 Mass Spectrometer (AB SCIEX) equipped with an optical parametric oscillator (Horizon, Continuum, USA). In QTRAP4000, the parameters were set to positive ionization mode, with curtain gas set at 20 psi, ion source gas 1 at 25 psi, and collision energy at 14 V. A full scan was carried out in the range of m/z 50–800 Da. Data processing was carried out using Analyst software (AB SCIEX, version 1.6.2). The optical parametric oscillator was operated at wavelengths of 192–2750 nm, with a pulse length of <10 ns at 10 Hz. The laser energy was set using Q-Switch and is measured using a laser power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs, USA). The S/N was the ratio of the peak intensity of the analyte to the peak intensity of the maximum noise.
Animals
All experiments were carried out on male C57BL/6 mice (12–14 weeks old) purchased from the Animal Center of Jinling Hospital. The mice were housed in a colony room maintained at 24 ± 1 °C with a 12 h light–dark cycle (lights on at 07:00). Mouse chow and water were available ad libitum. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, and followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health.
CUMS paradigm
The CUMS paradigm was conducted as previously described.38 Briefly, the animals for CUMS were exposed to a variable sequence of mild and unpredictable stressors (Table 1).
