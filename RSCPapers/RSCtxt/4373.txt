    , Accepted 2nd April 2014First published on 2nd April 2014AbstractWe present a new type of microstructured TiO2 sea urchin-like assembly, composed of high aspect-ratio nanosheets. We also demonstrate the applicability of these structures as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells, with 9.0% conversion efficiency realized, a considerable improvement over the commercial Dyesol paste (8.2%) under the same conditions. We reveal that this new TiO2 nanostructure is beneficial to enhanced dye loading and efficient light scattering. In particular, the interpenetrating individual sheets of the spheres result in more intimate interparticle connections and provide efficient electron transfer pathways.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized electrochemical photovoltaic cell technology has been recognized as a viable option for power generation.1 Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention over the past two decades on account of features such as shorter energy pay-back time, lower dependence on the angle of incidence of light, insensitivity to temperature changes, easy fabrication on rigid and flexible substrates, and relatively high energy conversion efficiency.2–8 One of the core components in the DSC system is usually a wide-band-gap titanium oxide (TiO2) thin film that serves as a support for the dye molecules and as an electron-transporting medium. Typically, in the photoanode, an insufficient electron diffusion coefficient in electrodes composed of nanometer-sized TiO2 particles is believed to limit the power conversion efficiency. This is because electron collection is determined by trapping/detrapping events at the sites of the electron traps (defects, surface states, grain boundaries, self-trapping, etc.).9 With this as the motivation, there is an overwhelming desire among researchers to design and synthesize materials that simultaneously have large surface areas (to absorb more dye molecules), efficient light scattering capability, and fast electron transport. In addition, the pores formed in the TiO2 layer must be sufficiently large in size, with good connectivity for efficient diffusion of electrolyte components.10 One solution to this requirement is to use one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, which can provide direct channels for the rapid collection of the photogenerated electrons, reduce charge recombination, and simultaneously enhance the electrolyte diffusion.11–15 The typical low surface area of 1D nanostructures, however, leads to reduced dye loading, and hence reduced light harvesting, resulting in lower photocurrents.
Alternatively, bi-layer structured nanoparticle films have been designed to confine the incident light within the photoanode.16–21 Such a configuration, however, increases the thickness of the photoanode film, so that photogenerated electrons at the light scattering layer have to travel a longer distance within the photoelectrode film to reach the current collector electrode and therefore suffer from a high rate of recombination. Many groups have also tried to combine nanometer-sized particles with micrometer-sized particles to make full use of the combined size advantages.22–24 Most of these structures, however, were obtained on the basis of separate TiO2 materials with different morphologies, which unavoidably bring in tedious fabrication procedures.25
In this work, we introduce a novel material structure for use in DSC photoanodes, which consists of hierarchical assemblies of polycrystalline anatase TiO2 nanosheets that appear to resemble sea urchins. These spheres have a bimodal distribution of sizes, leading to both effective dye adsorption and effective light-scattering behaviour, as well as enhanced electronic interconnectivity within the photoanode. An overall energy conversion efficiency of up to 9.0% can be achieved by using these highly connected hierarchical textured TiO2 spheres (HCHTs) as the photoelectrode with the dye N719.
Results and discussion
HCHTs were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of a solution of titanium butoxide (TB) and acetic acid (HAc), which was followed subsequently by calcination at 500 °C. Fig. 1(a) and (c) show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the final product. The thin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can be seen to be the primary building units of these larger structures, with an average thickness of approximately 10 nm. These can be more clearly distinguished in Fig. 1(d) and S1(c),† where they are assembled into hierarchical spheres, in the ESI.† Interestingly, the size distribution in Fig. 1(b) reveals a bimodal distribution centered at ∼0.4 and 2.0 μm. Kuang's group obtained different morphologies and sizes by adjusting the hydrothermal conditions, such as precursor concentrations or reaction temperature.26,27 The microstructure of the hierarchical spheres was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the higher resolution images in Fig. 1(e) and (f), it can be seen that the nanosheets are normal to the sphere surface and are interlocked with the nanosheets of neighbouring spheres. The small features, created by these sheets, also allow for high dye loading, a feature typically counterposed to effective light scattering. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image [Fig. 1(g)] confirms that the calcined hierarchical TiO2 spheres are composed of crystalline TiO2 nanocrystals with a fringe spacing of approximately 3.5 Å, corresponding to the (101) plane of the anatase phase. The related selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1(d) also confirms the polycrystalline nature of the hierarchical spheres, with the three most distinct concentric diffraction rings, moving outward from the centre, assigned to the (101), (103), and (200) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. In addition, the successful preparation of anatase TiO2 is further demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern [Fig. 1(h)] and the Raman spectrum [Fig. S1(e)†].

The formation mechanism of such a nanosheet-based hierarchical structure can be understood by examining precipitates extracted at different stages of the reaction, as shown in Scheme 1. Based on TEM (Fig. S2†), XRD (Fig. S3†), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterizations (Fig. S4†), it can be determined that HAc does not fully react with TB during a short reaction time such as 1 h, and the sample features agglomerated nanocrystals [Fig. S2(a)†]. The presence of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic groups centered at 1566, 1452, and 1421 cm−1 [Fig. S4(b)†] reveals the coordination of HAc with the titanium centres,28,29 indicating the formation of a titanium-containing intermediate (Fig. S3†). With an extended reaction time (5 h), the Ti-complex intermediates assembled to form leaf-like nanosheets through an oriented attachment process, to bear some resemblance to the HCHT particles [Fig. S2(b)†]. This was, however, only seen to be fully complete after 12 h, with urchin-like structures appearing [Fig. S2(c)†]. It should be noted that XRD analysis of these structures (Fig. S3†) reveals that this material still has low crystallinity. Calcination is required to obtain the highly crystalline material, from the decomposition of the as-prepared Ti-complex intermediate spheres to TiO2.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the formation process of HCHT. 
The formation of the leaf-like nanosheets is concluded to occur via acidolysis of TB, catalyzed by HAc through the formation of a Ti-acetate complex. Evidence of this TB–HAc complex is seen with FTIR [Fig. S4(a) and (b)†],30 with a weak band at 1721 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of the CO group of HAc. In comparison with pure TB and HAc, new bands are observed at 3426, 1566, 1452, 1421, and 1259 cm−1. It is well known that acetate ligands are produced by the reaction of TB with HAc and have several modes of coordination, including monodentate and bidentate (chelating and bridging).31–33 The alcohol nC4H9OH is also generated as a by-product in the formation process of these acetate ligands. The peak at 3426 cm−1 (observed for all intermediates) should be assigned to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups on nC4H9OH.34 Moreover, the separation (Δν = 140 cm−1) between 1566 and 1426 cm−1 suggests that some acetate groups act as bridging ligands between two titanium atoms.31–33 The presence of the 1721 cm−1 (CO) band can be attributed to the contribution of monodentate-coordinated acetates, while the weak absorption indicates the small amount of such monodentate-coordinated acetates, therefore, it can be concluded that most of the Ti-acetate complexes are bidentate-coordinated acetates. Through the acidolysis process, the nascent TiO2 nanocrystals are surrounded by numerous bidentate-coordinated acetates. Given the direction of the π–π interactions, amorphous leaf-like nanosheets are constructed by the oriented aggregation of these TiO2 nanocrystals.30 In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the as-prepared precipitates, measured under flowing air (Fig. S5†), indicated that a considerable amount of nC4H9OH (∼29 wt%) was trapped inside the Ti-complex intermediate spheres, and the complete decomposition of the organics occurred at approximately 400 °C.31 Above 400 °C, the weight of the sample remains almost constant. The sharp peak in the differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. S5†) curve, starting at approximately 350 °C, corresponds to the crystallization of the amorphous residue into anatase. Finally, calcination at 500 °C for 3 h resulted in the formation of pure HCHTs, as shown in Fig. 1.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed to obtain the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, porosity, and pore size distribution for state-of-the-art commercial TiO2 screen printing pastes [18NR-T Transparent Titania Paste (hereafter, Dyesol-T) and WER2-O Reflector Titania Paste (hereafter, Dyesol-S), obtained from Dyesol (Australia)], and HCHT materials. As observed in Fig. 2(a), the isotherm of the HCHTs appears to be a Type IV curve with an H3 hysteresis, which is usually ascribed to slit-like mesopores formed by sheet-like particles.35 The two hysteresis loops in the isotherm suggest that hierarchical nanoporous structures exist within the matrix, which can be directly verified by the pore size distribution plot in Fig. 2(b) [determined by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis]. The pore size distribution of the HCHTs ranges between 2 and 100 nm, with a bimodal pore size distribution centered at 2.5 nm and 10 nm (as might be expected given the hierarchical structure). Interestingly, the mean average pore diameter is actually 17.6 nm due to large mesopores with diameters significantly more than 10 nm, accounting for the majority of the slit-like mesopores, which result from the gaps between the randomly assembled nanosheets and can be seen clearly in Fig. S1(b).†,36 In addition, the voids formed by aggregated spheres may also contribute to the large pores [Fig. 1(a)].37 It is well known that for good performance the pores formed in the TiO2 layer must be sufficiently large in size with excellent mutual connectivity for the efficient diffusion of the electrolyte.10 As such, larger pores (between spheres) in HCHTs can serve as “highways” for efficient electrolyte diffusion. The data on the BET specific surface areas, porosities, and roughness factors for the Dyesol-S, Dyesol-T, and HCHTs are summarized in Table 1. The data show that the HCHT film has a larger surface area and higher porosity than the Dyesol film, indicating that HCHTs have higher dye adsorption capability. The roughness factor of the HCHT film being ~1.3 times higher leads to an increase in the light harvesting efficiency due to the larger amount of dye adsorption, which will be further discussed below.

Before BET measurements, all the particles were dried and then calcined at 500 °C for 3 h.

The HCHTs were applied in photoanodes of DSCs. The thickness of the film derived from the spheres was around 15 μm. The morphology of the spherical TiO2 structures is clearly seen in the film prepared from HCHTs [shown in the inset of Fig. 3 and S6(a)†]. For comparison, a Dyesol-based film with a double layer [12 μm transparent layer (Dyesol-T) + 4 μm scattering layer (Dyesol-S)] was prepared under analogous conditions (refer to the Experimental section at the end of this paper). Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the Dyesol-based and HCHT-based DSCs. As listed in Table 2, the Dyesol-based DSCs showed an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.805 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.3 mA cm−2, and an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 8.2%, while the HCHT-based DSCs showed a Voc of 0.850 V, a Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2, and an η of 9.0% under one sun conditions, resulting in a 19.6% and 6% increase in Jsc and Voc, respectively. The remarkable increase in Jsc is probably attributable to the larger surface area due to the hierarchical and mesoporous morphology of the HCHT photoanode, allowing it to take up more dye molecules (5.9 × 10−7 mol cm−2), in tandem with light scattering (discussed in more detail below).

To quantify the dye loading, N719 stained films were exposed to a 0.1 M NaOH solution and the amount of desorbed dye molecules was examined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy [shown in Fig. S6(b)†]. The absorption spectrum of the desorbed dye represents the amount of dye adsorbed at the photoanode. The two spectra show two peaks at 378 nm and 512 nm which are blue-shifted from the original N719 dye absorption peaks, as typically occurs in alkaline solutions.40 In general, as the amount of dye adsorbed increases, more light can be harvested, so that there is a higher photocurrent density.41 The amount of adsorbed dye for the HCHT photoanode (5.9 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is significantly higher than that for the Dyesol photoanode (3.7 × 10−7 mol cm−2), which may contribute to the remarkably improved Jsc for the HCHT-based DSCs.
Even if the dark current cannot be directly related to the back electron transfer process, since the electrolyte concentration in the films and the potential distribution across the nanoporous electrode in the dark current are different from those under illumination, it has been considered as a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the back electron transfer.42 Furthermore, dark J–V curves show that the dark current onset of the HCHT-based DSCs has shifted to a higher potential, and a smaller dark current is produced at the same potential above 0.7 V. These observations indicate a lower recombination rate between transferred electrons and I3− ions for the HCHT.
To investigate the scattering efficiency of the Dyesol and HCHT films, the reflectivity of each film was studied. The inset in Fig. 4 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the Dyesol film and the HCHT film. Both films show highly diffuse reflection capability across most of the visible spectrum. Diffuse reflectivity is observed to be lower for the Dyesol film for wavelengths from 400 nm to 800 nm. It is worth noting that from 600 nm to 800 nm, which is actually the region in which diffuse reflectivity is most critical, as the extinction co-efficient of the dye (N719) is comparatively low, the HCHT film scattered light far more effectively, which gave it a higher probability of being absorbed. Films produced from the HCHT show superior diffuse reflection capabilities for longer wavelengths (600–800 nm) due to the larger particle size, which is comparable to the wavelength of the incident light in question.

Fig. 4 displays the wavelength distribution of the incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for both the Dyesol and the HCHT films. The IPCE is determined by the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of electron injection, and the efficiency with which electrons are collected at the conducting glass substrate, which is strongly affected by the morphology and surface area of the photoelectrode. Both films result in a reasonably broad IPCE response, with the HCHT film giving a higher response across the whole spectrum. Closer analysis (Fig. S7†) reveals the enhancement in IPCE to be most marked at λ > 650 nm. In the short-wavelength spectral region (400–450 nm), the IPCE of the Dyesol film is about 8% lower than that of the HCHT film. In this spectral region, triiodide (I3−) in the electrolyte absorbs strongly, in conjunction with the lower dye loading absorbed, attenuating the amount of light reaching the sensitizing dye and thus limiting the photocurrent. At the maximum value of the IPCE spectra at 535 nm, the IPCE of the HCHT film is approximately 6% higher than that of the Dyesol film.
In order to study the interfacial reactions of photoexcited electrons and better understand the kinetics of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes occurring in DSC operations, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed.43–46Fig. 5(a) presents the Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra obtained under one sun illumination for DSCs assembled with the Dyesol and HCHT films under Voc. The equivalent circuit is shown as the inset and the fitting data are given in Fig. S8† and Table S1.† In general, three semicircles extending from the total series resistance (Rs) can be recognized and fitted according to an equivalent circuit model, where the finite diffusion element is also represented by the shunt resistance and low frequency constant phase element (CPE). The semicircle in the high frequency region represents the impedance corresponding to charge transfer at the counter electrode (Rct1), while those at intermediate frequency and low-frequency regions give information on the impedance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface (Rct2), related to the charge transport/recombination, and the finite diffusion of the electrolyte (Rdiff), respectively.44,46–48 According to the approach of Adachi et al.,49 several parameters related to the properties of electron transport in the semiconductor can be deduced from the Nyquist plot. In particular, the charge transfer (recombination) resistance (Rct2) related to electron–hole recombination can be determined from the central arc diameter. In our case, it was found that the recombination resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (Rct2) for HCHTs was smaller than that for the devices made using the commercial paste, which indicates that electrons are easier to move at the HCHT surface and contribute to the charge transport at the photoanode. The Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 5(b) also illustrate the differences in the electron lifetime for the TiO2 films derived from Dyesol and HCHTs. Three main frequency peaks are observed. These peaks correspond to the charge transfer processes at different interfaces within the DSCs. Interestingly, the maximum frequency in the intermediate frequency regime, which is related to electron transfer in the HCHT-based film, is lower than that for the Dyesol-based film. According to the EIS model developed by Kern et al.,50 the electron lifetime (τeff) of injected electrons in a TiO2 film can be calculated from the low frequency results as: (1)where the characteristic fmax is the maximum frequency in the mid-frequency peak. The middle-frequency peak of the Dyesol particle containing DSCs is at a higher frequency (50.22 Hz) compared to the HCHT-based DSCs (24.93 Hz), indicating a longer lifetime (6.4 ms) for the HCHT (3.2 ms for the Dyesol). Longer electron lifetimes are observed for HCHT-sensitized solar cells, indicating more effective suppression of the back-reaction of the injected electrons with the I3− ions in the electrolyte.

To summarize, based on the above characterizations, HCHT particles have several functions particularly well suited for application in DSCs. This is shown in Scheme 2. The sheet-like building blocks result in a high active surface area, which, in turn, allows for improved dye loading. Concurrently the spheres formed by these sheets are effective light-scattering centres across a broad range of incident wavelengths. Because of the bimodal pore size distributions, the large external pores can serve as “highways” for efficient electrolyte diffusion. Finally, the overlapping and interconnected 2D nanosheets provide improved conduction pathways for electron transfer.

Conclusions
A new type of highly connected hierarchical textured TiO2 sphere (HCHT) was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. The HCHTs with well-defined mesopores simultaneously possess high specific surface area, a pronounced light-scattering effect (especially for λ > 600 nm), and fast electron transport. The DSCs made from HCHTs exhibit a higher energy conversion efficiency of 9.0%, compared to 8.2% for the commercial Dyesol TiO2 double layer photoanode.
Experimental
Synthesis of highly connected hierarchical textured TiO2 spheres (HCHTs)
Acetic acid (HAc, ACS reagent, ≥99.7%) and titanium butoxide (TB, Ti (OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4, 97%, analytical reagent) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and used without further purification. The fabrication of HCHTs from a TB–HAc solution was simply carried out by a hydrothermal approach. In detail, 0.5 mL of TB was added to 30 mL of HAc solution under magnetic stirring and kept for 1 h at room temperature, before being transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel pressure vessel (45 mL capacity, Parr Instrument Company) and heated in an oven to 150 °C for 12 h (heating ramp rate of 1 °C min−1). After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, dried at 90 °C overnight, and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the residual organics.
Preparation of TiO2 photoanodes
To prepare the DSC working electrodes, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the current collector (2.3 mm thickness, 8 Ω sq−1, Hartford Glass) was first cleaned with soapy water for 20 min and rinsed with distilled water, then soaked in acetone and then ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Firstly, the blocking layer solution was created by diluting titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 75% in isopropanol (Aldrich, 32525-2), in absolute ethanol in the volume ratio of 1:9. After drying in nitrogen, the blocking layer was deposited on the clean FTO glass by spray pyrolysis. Then, a layer of TiO2 paste was cast onto the FTO glass plates by the doctor-blade method. The paste fabrication process is as follows: briefly, TiO2 powders (1.0 g) were ground in a mixture of ethanol (20 mL), distilled water (0.833 mL), acetic acid (0.167 mL), terpineol (4 g), and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath and stirred for 1 h. A viscous white TiO2 paste was finally obtained after an evaporation process. After a heating process (at 150 °C for 10 min, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 30 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min) to remove organic substances, the TiO2 films were soaked in 0.02 M aqueous titanium tetrachloride solution (TiCl4) at 70 °C for 30 min. As a final step, the films were washed with water, and then ethanol, dried, and sintered again (500 °C for 30 min).
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The resultant TiO2 films were immersed in a 0.5 mM N719 (Solaronix) dye solution in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile (HPLC, Lab-scan) and tert-butanol (LR, Ajax Chemicals) for about 24 h once the temperature decreased to approximately 110 °C. After dyeing, the samples were taken out of the dye bath, washed with acetonitrile, and dried. The Pt counter electrode was produced using a pre-drilled piece of 2.3 mm FTO glass, coated with one drop of 10 mM platinic acid solution (H2PtCl6) and heated to 400 °C for 20 min. The working electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a spacer of 25 μm Surlyn (Solaronix). An I−/I3− organic solvent based electrolyte solution [85:15 vol% of acetonitrile/valeronitrile, 0.03 M iodine (I2), 0.5 M 4 tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP), 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN)] was introduced via vacuum back-filling. The hole was sealed using another piece of aluminium-backed Surlyn.

The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by using a Bruker Advance X-ray Diffractometer (40 kV, 30 mA) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation at a scan rate of 1° min−1 from 5° to 80° (2θ). The morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7001) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) were determined by using a nitrogen adsorption apparatus (Tristar 3030, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). All samples were degassed at 150 °C overnight before measurement. Dye desorption was performed by dipping the sensitized sample into 0.1 M NaOH in ethanol–water (1:1) solution. The effective dye loading was determined from the absorption value for each NaOH–dye solution according to Beer's law. The light absorption and scattering properties of the samples were investigated by ultraviolet (UV)-visible light absorption/diffuse reflectance spectrometry (Shimadzu UV-3600). Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal (DT) analyses were carried out on a Mettler Toledo GC200 instrument from 25 to 600 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The film thickness was measured with a Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profiler. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter, a simulated 100 mW cm−2 air mass (AM) 1.5 light source (Oriel), and customized LabView software. The device area was masked with a metallic mask slightly larger than the active area. The intensity was adjusted to give 100 mW cm−2 on a calibrated Si photodiode (PECCELL) equipped with a cut-off filter giving a spectral response similar to N719. Incident photon-to-current quantum conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 300 W Xe lamp, a monochromator with sorting filters focused on a spot with additional optics. The short circuit current response of the devices was recorded in 5 nm steps using a Keithley 2400 SMU. The measured currents were referenced to a calibrated Si photodiode (PECCELL).
