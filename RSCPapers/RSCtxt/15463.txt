    , Accepted 13th August 2017First published on 14th August 2017AbstractHole transporting materials (HTMs) play an important role in most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In particular, donor-π-bridge-donor type oligomers (D-π-D) have been explored extensively as alternative and economical HTMs. In the present work, a series of triphenylamine-based derivatives as alternatives to the expensive Spiro-OMeTAD were explored by using first-principles calculations combined with the Marcus theory. The electronic structures, optical properties and hole mobilities of all the molecules were investigated to reveal the relationship between their charge-transport properties and the π-bridge conjugation. The HOMO levels decrease with the extension of the π-bridge conjugation length, which may lead to higher open-circuit voltages. Moreover, we employed a quantum mechanical (QM) methodology to estimate the carrier mobility for organic crystals. Specifically, an orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ) is first applied to quantitatively evaluate the overall carrier mobility of HTMs in PSCs. The theoretically calculated results validate that this model predicts the hole mobility of HTMs correctly. More importantly, it is revealed that enhancing the π-bridge conjugation in HTMs can improve the hole mobility, which will definitely improve the performance of PSCs. We hope that our theoretical investigation will offer a reliable calculation method to estimate the charge-transport properties of novel HTMs applied in perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in particular, methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3 or MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I), have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of low cost and high efficiency.1,2 Methylammonium lead halide perovskites have properties such as broad absorption in the visible region, high charge carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion length.3–5 During the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this type of solar cell has been improved rapidly from 3.8% to above 22.1% as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).1,6,7 Typically, PSC devices consist of multiple inter-stacked materials, namely, transparent electrodes, electron transporting materials (ETMs), perovskite absorbing layers, hole transporting materials (HTMs), and metallic counter electrodes. The active surface area may be enlarged by forming a perovskite layer on a mesoscopic scaffold layer, such as a layer composed of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. Although HTM-free PSCs have been reported to exhibit PCE up to 12.8%,8–11 the most efficient solar cells commonly use HTMs, which play a vital role in enhancing the open-circuit voltage and impeding the charge recombination.12
In general, HTMs can be classified into three categories for perovskite solar cells, including inorganic molecules,12–14 small organic molecules, and conjugated polymers.15,16 Various small molecule HTMs, such as pyrene arylamine derivatives,17 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,18 star-shaped triazine,19 carbazole derivatives,20 butadiene derivatives,21 triphenylamine,22 triptycene,23 tetrathiafulvalene derivatives,24 spiro-based derivatives,25 linear π-conjugated derivatives,22 and oligothiophene derivatives26 have been employed extensively in PSCs. Among all the HTMs, the most common HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) appears to show the best device performance to date. In 2015, Nazeeruddin's group obtained the crystal structure for the first time.6 However, the Spiro-OMeTAD is highly expensive due to the complicated synthetic procedure with low yield and time-consuming purification. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more economical and efficient alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD.
Triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives not only have the advantages of high hole mobility and good thermal stability, but also their energy levels can be adjusted reasonably by changing the molecular structures. Until now, many TPA-based HTMs for PSCs were widely explored. Li et al. reported the effects of the chain extension on the optical properties and hole mobility of a series of H111 derivatives using first-principles calculations combined with the Marcus theory.27 Peak and coworkers synthesized a series of HTMs containing the donor-π-bridge-donor structure with planar configuration.28 The results indicated that the PSCs fabricated with PEH-9 (named P2 as the model molecule in our work) produced an impressive PCE of 16.9%. Oligothiophenes have been extensively used as π-bridges due to their high electron density, charge-carrier mobility, and low aromaticity.29,30 Longitudinal conjugation extension and lateral expansion by thiophene substitution have already been reported.6,31 Previous experimental studies have shown that increasing the π-bridge conjugation length can improve the photovoltaic performance.32,33 However, how π-bridge conjugation theoretically affects the electrochemical properties of the PSCs has rarely been reported. Moreover, the anisotropic mobility as an intrinsic property of organic materials has attracted much attention.34 The anisotropic effects were first observed by Sundar et al. in rubrene crystals in 2004.35 Han and coworkers developed a protocol to simulate the angular resolution anisotropic mobility that is associated with electronic coupling and molecular packing mode.36 Although there are several theoretical studies about anisotropic hole mobilities in organic semiconductors,37–40 a systematic investigation of the anisotropic hole mobilities in PSCs is still lacking.
Herein, thiophene, thienothiophene, dithienothiophene, and terthienothiophene are incorporated into two electron-rich TPA units (Fig. 1) to design new donor-π-donor type hole transporting materials as alternatives to the expensive Spiro-OMeTAD. The conjectural synthetic protocol for the HTMs is illustrated in Scheme S1† according to previously reported procedures.41,42 In the present work, we focus on revealing the influence of π-bridge conjugation on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In the present study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the geometric structures, molecular orbitals, and reorganization energies of four monomers. The absorption and emission spectra were simulated using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The electronic coupling and hole mobility have been predicted based on first-principles calculations combined with the Marcus theory.43,44 Furthermore, we first employed a mobility orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ), aiming at making a thorough and accurate theoretical investigation about the relationship between the charge-transport properties and molecular packing style. The results are expected to be useful for gaining insight into the hole transport properties for the rational design of efficient hole transporting materials.

Computational methods
Theoretical background
Hitherto, two common theoretical mechanisms have been established to describe the charge transport in organic materials, namely, the band-like model and the hopping model.45,46 The hopping model is preferred for predicting hole mobility under ambient conditions. The charge hopping rate (k) can be expressed as  where V is the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules in the crystal structure, λ is the reorganization energy which is computed by the adiabatic potential energy surface method,47,48h is the Planck constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In our work, only internal reorganization energy is considered. The reorganization energy can be expressed as follows:49  where  and  represent the total energies of cationic and neutral species with the geometries of the neutral and cationic species, respectively. E+ and E0 are the total energies of the cationic and neutral molecules in their lowest energy geometries, respectively.
Additionally, the site energies (HRR and HPP), spatial overlap (SRP) and charge transfer integrals (JRP) for one dimer are the essential parameters of electronic coupling (V),36 as shown in the following equation:  
Based on the Einstein relation, the drift mobilities for hole transport of the investigated molecules can be calculated in organic semiconductors:35  where n represents the spatial dimensionality, i is a selected hopping pathway, ri is the charge hopping centroid to centroid distance, and ki denotes the charge hopping rate. Pi is the hopping probability, which can be expressed as  
Han et al. presented a model to simulate the anisotropic mobility (μΦ) by projecting the different hopping pathways.36 The equation of angular resolution anisotropic mobility can be described as follows:  where ri, γi, and θi reveal the intermolecular packing parameters in the organic crystals. γi is the angle of the hopping pathway relative to the transport plane of the organic crystal molecular stacking layer, θi and Φ are defined as the orientation angle of the projected electronic coupling pathways of different dimer types and the conducting channel relative to the same reference axis (commonly using the crystallographic axis), respectively. Thus, the angle between the different pathways and the conducting channel is (θi − Φ). For the hopping pathways on the basal transport stacking layer, the values of γi are 0°.
Computational details
A series of hybrid functionals including BMK, B3LYP, PBE0, and M06-2X together with different basis sets were applied to optimize the ground-state (S0) geometry of the model molecule P2. The calculated results indicate that the HOMO energy of molecule P2 computed at the BMK/6-31G(d) level agrees well with the experimental value (listed in Table S1†). Accordingly, the structures of all molecules in their neutral and charged states were optimized with the BMK functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. All the optimized geometries show no imaginary frequency, which guarantees the local minimum of the potential energy surface. The absorption and emission spectra were simulated at the BMK/6-31G(d) level based on the ground and excited state geometries (shown in Table S2†). The conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) (in a dichloromethane environment) was also taken into consideration.50 All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.51
Moreover, the molecular crystal structure was predicted by using the Polymorph module of the software package Materials Studio 8.0.52 The geometry of the cluster models used in the present study was taken from the BMK/6-31G(d) level. The Dreiding force field was used for the prediction.53 For all the molecules, the polymorph predictor calculations are restricted to the ten most common space groups, P21/c, P, P212121, C2/c, P21, Pbca, Pna21, Cc, Pbcn, and C2. Then, we sorted the obtained crystal structures in terms of their total energies. Based on the crystal structures, we selected the center molecule in the crystal as the carrier donor and took all its neighbouring unduplicated molecules as dimers. By using the visualization tool in the Materials Studio client, we can directly measure the centroid of each molecule and the distance (ri) between two molecular centroids in one dimer. In addition, all the electronic coupling calculations in different molecular dimers were performed by the PW91/TZP method using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package.54 The essential parameters of electronic coupling can be computed through the fragment analysis function in ADF. After the molecular dimer structure is imported into the ADF client, we open the region selecting function to define two different molecular fragments in a dimer and set the calculation option as fragment analysis. Finally, when the ADF calculation is finished, we can directly obtain the essential parameters (HRR, HPP, SRP and JRP) of electronic coupling from the output file. Then, the angular resolution anisotropic mobilities can be obtained by relating the crystal packing and electron coupling V to the outer measuring channel angle Φ.
Results and discussion
Geometrical structures and electronic properties
The optimized geometrical structures of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. S1.† We can find that all molecules have highly planar bridges and two triphenylamine skeletons with propeller-like structures. In π-conjugated oligomers and polymers, it has been demonstrated that the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are among the key factors for illustrating the carrier transport properties.55 To characterize their electronic structures, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the four molecules were investigated and are depicted in Fig. 2. The FMO of all molecules have similar distribution pictures due to their similar donor-π-donor structure.
 Fig. 2  Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) for molecules P1–P4 at the BMK/6-31G(d) level. 
The HOMOs spread over the entire molecule whereas the LUMOs are predominantly located on the π-conjugated bridges and two neighbouring benzene rings. As a whole, the distribution of the HOMOs is more vast than that of the LUMOs for all the investigated molecules, which indicates that all molecules have good hole transport performance, making them potential hole transport materials.
In PSCs, the molecular HOMO level not only reflects the hole injection ability but also determines the open-circuit voltage of the device. A deeper HOMO level offers a higher open-circuit voltage. For HTMs, their HOMO level should be higher than the valence band of perovskites. The LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of perovskites to block the electron transportation from perovskites to the metal electrodes. Traditionally, mesoporous TiO2 is the most widely used electron transporting material in PSCs, with a conduction band minimum of 4.0 eV. In our work, the energy levels of LUMOs are evaluated by using the expression LUMO = HOMO + E, where E is the excitation energy. Fig. 3 and Table S3† illustrate the energy levels of the HOMOs and LUMOs of all molecules at the BMK/6-31G(d) level in CH2Cl2. The energy levels of Spiro-OMeTAD are also investigated for comparison. Their HOMO values follow the order: Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.14 eV) > P1 (−5.23 eV) > P2 (−5.26 eV) > P3 (−5.27 eV) > P4 (−5.31 eV), which match well with those of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). The HOMO values of P1–P4 are lower than those of the reference molecule Spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, the corresponding LUMO levels are much higher than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV). Thus, higher open-circuit voltage can be obtained and the backflow of electrons can also be effectively blocked for all the molecules being used as HTMs.
 Fig. 3  Energy level diagram of each component in a hybrid solar cell. 
In order to study the charge transfer properties deeply, electron density difference plots of all the molecules were calculated. Three parameters including the electron transfer distance (L in Å), the fraction of electron exchange (Δe in |e−|), together with the overlap between the zones of density depletion and increment (Ω, isovalue: 4 × 10−4 e au−3), are summed up in Table 1. Obviously, the electron density depletion (green) mainly localizes on the two triphenylamine units, while the electron density increment (purple) mainly localizes on the π-conjugated spacers. Inspecting the fraction of electron exchange (Δe) for all the investigated molecules, one clear changing sequence is that Δe is gradually enhanced with the π-bridge conjugation length increasing from P1 to P4. What's more, we can observe that the electron transfer distance (L) of P4 (0.777 Å) is the largest, which may be caused by the increased conjugation degree of π-spacers. In addition to Δe and L, the overlaps between the regions of density depletion and increment can also assess well the charge separation. It is notable that Ω changes slightly with the increase of the π-bridge conjugation length. All in all, enhancing the fused thiophene rings of π-linkers is beneficial to produce the separated charge, which is helpful for the application of HTMs in PSCs.

Photophysical properties and exciton binding energy
To gain insight into the optical properties, the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra (shown in Fig. 4) of the molecules were simulated at the BMK/6-31G(d) level based on the ground and excited state geometries, respectively. It has been previously testified that the absorption peak of molecule P2 was consistent with the experimental value. The absorption wavelengths (λabs) and emission wavelengths (λem) along with the Stokes shifts of molecules P1–P4 are presented in Table 2. Apparently, the tendency of λabs is in the following order: P1 (460 nm) < P2 (475 nm) < P3 (490 nm) < P4 (491 nm). Their maximum absorption peaks are all larger than those of Spiro-OMeTAD (384 nm). These peaks probably result from the π–π* electron transition of the molecular conjugated system. Besides, the maximum absorption wavelengths of all the investigated molecules correspond to the dominant transition from HOMO to LUMO. The contribution of HOMO to LUMO becomes smaller and smaller from P1 to P4, and the oscillator strength becomes larger and larger with the extension of the π-bridge conjugation length. As a result, increasing fused thiophene rings of π-linkers can enhance the conjugation of the compound, which is attributed to a bathochromic spectrum responding. Likewise, the emission wavelengths (λem) of the investigated molecules are P1 (604 nm), P2 (633 nm), P3 (648 nm) and P4 (656 nm), respectively. The changing tendency of emission wavelengths is in line with that of absorption peaks. Correspondingly, the Stokes shifts of the investigated molecules as determined using the equation Δλ = λem − λabs are 144, 158, 158, and 165 nm, respectively. A large Stokes shift can undergo much more geometrical changes upon excitation, thus indicating a good molecular flexibility of the excited state.56 In this respect, we conjecture that increasing the fused thiophene rings of π-spacers in small molecular HTMs is an effective approach to obtain high performance PSCs.

To achieve high carrier transport, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into wholly separated positive and negative charges to escape from the Coulomb attraction.57 The exciton binding energy (Eb) is the energy difference between the neutral exciton and the two free charge carriers. It can be described using the following equation: Eb = Eg − Ex = EH–L − E1.58,59Eg (electronic band gap) is replaced by EH–L (energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO), and Ex (optical gap) can be defined as E1 (the first singlet excitation energy). The E1 was computed at the optimized geometry of the first excited state (S1) by TDDFT at the BMK/6-31G(d) level. Relevant data are summarized in Table 3. In the PSCs, an easy charge separation and a low Eb are required to improve the short-circuit current density and carrier mobility. The lower the value of Eb, the easier the electron–hole dissociation is. The values of Eb for molecules P1–P4 are 0.65, 0.65, 0.62, and 0.64 eV, respectively. We note that P1 and P2 have similar Eb, whereas P3 and P4 display lower values. Accordingly, the increase of the π-bridge conjugation length facilitates easier charge carrier dissociation.

Reorganization energy, electron affinity, and ionization potential
Generally, the charge hopping rate depends on two microscopic parameters: the reorganization energy and the effective electronic coupling. The charge mobility can be improved by optimizing these parameters.60 Herein, the reorganization energy can be divided into two parts: external reorganization energy (λext) and internal reorganization energy (λint). λint is a measure of the structural change between ionic and neutral states.61λext represents the effect of the polarized medium on charge transfer. For most organic molecules, λext is small and often neglected (λ ≈ λint).62 Therefore, we mainly study the λint of the isolated organic π-conjugated systems, ignoring the environmental changes and relaxation. In this work, λ was computed at the BMK/6-31G(d) level and the related results are portrayed in Fig. 5. The λ values of all the investigated molecules are 0.416, 0.372, 0.328 and 0.297 eV, respectively. It is evident that the values decrease as fused thiophene rings increase. Normally, a lower reorganization energy ensures a faster carrier transfer.56 The smallest reorganization energy of P4 implies the largest carrier transfer ability. According to the calculated reorganization energies, the hole mobility of the molecules can be obtained using the Einstein equation.
 Fig. 5  Calculated reorganization energies of molecules P1–P4. 
Commonly, the stability of an organic semiconductor can be evaluated by the absolute hardness (η), which is the resistance of the chemical potential to changes in the number of electrons.53,63 The absolute hardness of all the investigated molecules was calculated using the operational definition given by:64η = (IP − EA)/2, where IP represents the adiabatic ionization potential and EA signifies the adiabatic electron affinity. From Table S4,† the calculated absolute hardness values of all molecules are 2.29, 2.18, 2.14 and 2.11 eV, respectively. It is remarkable that P2–P4 possess similar stability owing to their nearly equal values of absolute hardness. More importantly, the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) is used to further explore the isolated molecular stability.65 The ESPs of the four investigated molecules are shown in Fig. S2.† The green colour represents the neutral region, whereas the red colour and the blue colour serve as regions of negative charge and positive charge, respectively. The positive charge is mostly located on hydrogen atoms and benzene rings, while oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen atoms are more negatively charged owing to their strong electron withdrawing ability. For P3 and P4, the negative charges are less distributed on the π-spacers with the degree of conjugation increasing. According to the above discussion, the stronger π-conjugated bridges impart negative charges on most of the carbon and sulfur atoms, which render the oxidation easy.
Hole mobility
The hole mobility is a significant parameter to assess the potential usability of new HTMs in PSC applications. The crystal structures of molecule P2 and Spiro-OMeTAD are extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database; nevertheless, the experimental crystal structure is not available for P1, P3, and P4, so we employed polymorph module to predict the crystal. Choi et al.66 have predicted the crystal structures of two organic pigments with different packing structures and then compared the structures and the simulated X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns with the experimental data. The resulting structures are in good agreement with the experimental structures. Hence, we consider that the method of predicting crystal structures is reliable. The calculated crystal structures of all molecules with the lowest total energies belong to P space groups, and the corresponding lattice parameters are displayed in Table S5 and Fig. S3.† The properties of the molecule Spiro-OMeTAD which are displayed in Table S6† were calculated for comparison. All the investigated HTMs have triclinic unit cells. The crystalline structure of P2 exhibits herringbone packing style, while P1, P3, P4, and Spiro-OMeTAD form a slipped face-to-face π-stacking structure. In organic crystals, one molecule was arbitrarily chosen as the center for the charge transport; neighboring molecules can be characterized as the transverse dimer T, the parallel dimer P, and the longitudinal dimer L. The most important four dimers are shown in Fig. 6. The angles between the hopping pathways of P, T1, T2, and T3 dimer types and the reference axis are marked, which are labeled θP, θT1, θT2, and θT3, respectively. The orientation angle of the conducting channel relative to the reference axis is Φ. The electronic couplings of distinct molecular dimers were theoretically calculated. These four dimers are in the same molecular stacking layer, which indicates that γi are 0°. Therefore, the electronic coupling of the L dimer can be neglected; that is to say, the charge transport between layers is inefficient.
 Fig. 6  The main hole-hopping pathways selected based on the crystalline structures for molecules P1–P4. 
It is worth mentioning that the theoretical method we used to describe charge transport properties is based on sound approximations and assumptions. The purpose of this work is to reveal the structure–property relationship and seek excellent hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells. The centroid to centroid distances (ri, Å), electronic coupling (V, eV), hole hopping rate (kij, s−1), and hole mobility (μΦ, cm2 V−1 s−1) of the hopping pathways selected based on the crystalline structures are listed in Table 4. Indeed, for molecule P2, the reference axis is set as the crystallographic a axis, and the orientation angle of the conducting channel relative to the reference a axis is Φ. The hopping pathways of P, T1, T2, and T3 dimer types are exactly on the a–b plane. We can observe that the predicted hole mobility of P2 (2.32 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) agrees well with the experimental data (3.64 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). It is clear that the hole mobilities of all the investigated molecules are P1 (4.35 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1), P2 (2.32 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), P3 (2.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and P4 (3.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. The trend of hole mobility is consistent with the result discussed above for the reorganization energy. For comparison, the hole mobility of the molecule Spiro-OMeTAD is also predicted. The hole mobility (7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is in good agreement with the experimental value (1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). On the other hand, hole mobility is determined by both the packing mode and the electronic coupling. Particularly, for molecule P2, although the electronic coupling of T2 dimer is much larger than those of other dimers, the crystal structure stacks in herringbone mode with low symmetry, which leads to smaller hole mobility. However, P1, P3, and P4 exhibit a face-to-face stacking structure with high symmetry. For Spiro-OMeTAD, the mobility direction along the T2 dimers produces the largest electronic coupling, which may be due to the face-to-face stacking mode. Importantly, for molecule P4, the mobility direction along the P dimers produces the largest electronic coupling. This phenomenon can be explained based on the mobility orientation function.

Besides, in order to further approach the real state of the materials in practical application, we try to simulate the amorphous state of material P2. Possible hole hopping pathways are displayed in Fig. S4† and the corresponding parameters are presented in Table S7.† We considered all possible packing styles including face-to-face stacking, edge-to-face, edge-to-edge stacking and cross packing. The minimum stacking distance of all the dimers is obtained by potential energy surface scans at the M062X/6-31G(d,p) level. The M062X functional has been verified as the best choice for non-covalent interactions.67 It is clear that the model molecule has the largest electronic coupling and hole hopping rate in pathway 2, which can be explained by the effective face-to-face stacking mode. The model molecule with the slipped π–π packing can also lead to larger electronic coupling. Overall, we infer that the hole mobility is gradually improved as the π-bridge conjugation length of the π-bridge increases.
Conclusion
In summary, four simple triphenylamine-based HTMs as alternatives to the expensive Spiro-OMeTAD were theoretically investigated by increasing the fused thiophene rings of π-spacers for parallel comparison. The computational analysis presented here employs quantum-chemistry combined with the Marcus theory to shed light on the electronic structures, optical properties, reorganization energies, exciton binding energies, and hole mobilities of the studied HTMs. Moreover, an orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ) is first applied to quantitatively evaluate the overall carrier mobility of HTMs in PSCs. It is demonstrated that this model predicts the anisotropic hole mobility of HTMs correctly. The results indicate that molecule P4 has a favorable hole transport capability with hole mobility as high as 3.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Consequently, enhancing the fused thiophene rings of π-linkers in HTMs is beneficial to hole transport, which will definitely improve the performance of PSCs. It is hoped that this theoretical approach can provide guidelines for the further development of molecular HTMs in perovskite solar cells.
