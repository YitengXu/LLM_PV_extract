    , Accepted 17th March 2016First published on 17th March 2016AbstractLaser irradiation as a rapid crystallization approach was successfully introduced to prepare homogeneous, dense-grained CH3NH3PbI3 films. Planar-heterojunction solar cells employing these high-quality films showed the optimal efficiency of 17.8% with a remarkably high open-circuit voltage of 1.146 V.
In the past few years, tremendous attention has been focused on solar cells with organometal halide perovskite due to their rapidly boosted power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost of device fabrication. Based on pioneering work1 and the use of solid state hole transport materials (HTMs),2 the PCE has been boosted rapidly and has exceeded 20.1% in individual devices.3 Such a situation where the PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is boosted so fast has never been seen in the development process of solar cells based on Si, CdTe, CIGS, DSSC and so on.4 By comparison, the high open circuit voltage (Voc) is one of the unique features of PSCs, which can play an important role in the improvement of the PCE, as well as extending PSCs for other applications, such as perovskite–hematite or BiVO4 tandem cells that can be used to drive water splitting.5,6 At present, the alternative strategies to improve the Voc are as follows: (1) selection of a suitable hole-blocking layer (HBL) contact or doping TiO2 to increase the conduction band minimum (CBM) and decrease the valence band maximum (VBM), which can provide a better hole-blocking effect and be still beneficial to electron transfer from perovskite to HBL. As reported, the Voc of devices with Mg-doped TiO2 and Nb2O5 HBL introduced has proved to be about 100 mV higher than that of the devices with pure TiO2.7,8 (2) Choosing a more suitable HTM to reduce the energy loss during the hole transfer from perovskites to HTMs, so widely used Spiro-MeOTAD has been replaced by a series of HTMs with a relatively low highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (HOMO).9,10 (3) Using CH3NH3PbX3−mIm (X = Cl or Br) with the higher CBM and lower VBM as the absorbers for PSCs, which can both increase the carrier injection efficiency and decrease bandgap-voltage offset.11 Moreover, it is also an important strategy to improve Vocvia better passivation, and the reduction of non-radiative losses within the perovskite layer will allow for high-performance devices with Voc possibly exceeding 1.1 V,12,13 and avoid the formation of a TiO2/HTM interface via controlling the crystallization process of perovskite films.14
In the one-step deposition method, perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films with an extremely homogenous, dense surface have been obtained via fast crystallization processes, such as the hot gas-assisted techniques,15 solution-based hot-casting,16 anti-solvent assisted crystallization11 and so on. These methods demonstrated that accelerating the nucleation and crystallization process can improve the uniformity and coverage of perovskite films and therefore enhance the performance of PSCs. As is well known, laser irradiation is an effective mean to induce rapid crystallization of various materials. Since the laser technology emerged in the 1960s, it has been used to process all kinds of inorganic materials. After the pioneering work by Feinleib et al. in 1971 on amorphous semiconductors films,17 many studies have been done on laser-induced crystallization and processing various films in the next 40 years. Thereafter, due to the unique photothermy and photochemical effect occurring when the laser irradiates the films, it has already become an effective way for the crystallization of films, such as semi-conductor Si and Ge, metals and their oxides, selenide, chalcogenides, superconducting compounds and so on. However, it is seldom used in the crystallization of organic semiconductor materials due to a high thermal effect. Fortunately, the reaction or crystallization process of the perovskite film itself is very fast, so the laser irradiation with the continuous and weak power may be a promising way to obtain high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films. Recently, some studies indicated that the residual or unreacted PbI2 can decrease defects and surface states.18,19 Bi et al. also demonstrated that slightly over-stoichiometric PbI2 did not strongly influence the composition and optical properties of the perovskite films but did improve their electric quality, and the highest Voc of 1.17 V was obtained so far for lead iodide-based PSCs.3 Chen et al. have reported that a proper amount of PbI2 species on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 could effectively passivate the perovskite films, leading to reduced recombination on the interface consequently.20 What is interesting is that laser irradiation can produce a thermal gradient distribution, which is beneficial to the formation of a proper amount of PbI2 on the surface of perovskite films. Therefore, if surface self-passivation is introduced simultaneously during the laser irradiation process, the recombination on the interface will decrease and Voc may accordingly increase in the devices. In order to investigate the crystallization effect of laser irradiation more clearly, we expect the pristine film to be still in a non crystalline state. Fortunately, Ahn et al. reported that a pristine perovskite film can be fabricated using a Lewis base adduct of lead(II) iodide,21 which just meets our requirement.
Herein, we used laser irradiation to induce rapid crystallization of perovskite films, and hence obtained successfully homogeneous, dense and pinhole free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. As envisioned, surface self-induced passivation was introduced simultaneously during the laser irradiation process, and as a result, the recombination was reduced in the interface and the Voc of the devices increased. Planar-heterojunction solar cells based on laser irradiation CH3NH3PbI3 (LI-CH3NH3PbI3) pristine films showed an optimal PCE of 17.8% with a high Voc of 1.146 V, which is higher than that of the devices employing thermally annealed CH3NH3PbI3 (TA-CH3NH3PbI3) pristine films.
The change of the crystal structure and optical absorption in pristine films with the laser power density (LPD) were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a very weak (110) diffraction peak of perovskite phase CH3NH3PbI3 was observed in the pristine film, which demonstrated that very little perovskite may form on the surface due to dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) volatilization upon exposure to air. After laser irradiation, the samples showed two major diffraction peaks of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite phase at 14.08° and 28.40° which correspond to (110) and (220), respectively. As for the pristine films after laser irradiation, the relative intensity of the diffraction peaks gradually increased with increasing LPD. However, the diffraction peak of PbI2 was also observed clearly when the LPD increased to 4.2 W cm−2.
 Fig. 1  The XRD patterns (a) and normalized UV-vis absorption spectra (b) of a pristine film and the perovskite films after laser irradiation at different LPDs. 
The normalized optical absorption spectra in Fig. 1(b) revealed that an absorption band edge existed at about 450 nm on the pristine film, and then the intensity of the optical absorption between 450 nm and 800 nm increased with increasing LPD until it reached 4.2 W cm−2. Moreover, the absorption band edge at about 450 nm appeared at the same time the other band edge at about 750 nm did, which implied that the perovskite might form partly on the surface of the pristine film, which agreed well with the results of XRD. Both absorption band edges of about 450 nm and 750 nm suggested that the pristine film is not really amorphous. With laser irradiation, part of the crystal nucleus or crystals in the pristine film absorbed the light and converted it into heat energy, which resulted in the fast volatilization of DMSO. As the LPD increases, light absorption was clearly enhanced at long wavelength bands until the LPD exceeded 3.1 W cm−2. This regular and gradient change suggested that laser irradiation was not only a simple crystallization method but also a controllable strategy. When the LPD further increased to 4.2 W cm−2, the absorption between 520 nm and 780 nm significantly decreased, and a weak absorption band edge appeared around 520 nm. It was ascribed to PbI2 forming on the surface of the perovskite film due to high photothermy leading to evaporation of partial CH3NH3I.
The influence of the LPD on the surface topography of the pristine film was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. As exhibited in Fig. 2(a)–(f), a series of clear changes have taken place on the surface of films with the LPD increasing. When the LPD was 1.36 W cm−2, the grain boundary was not observed clearly and most area of the surface was blur, with some pinholes on it, which suggested that the LPD was relatively weak and the energy of laser irradiation was not enough to make the precursor film crystallize completely. As the LPD increased, more and more heat energy was provided by laser irradiation which improved the crystallization of the pristine film. Therefore, the grain boundary was observed more and more clearly with the grain size increasing gradually. In addition, the pinholes on the surface decreased apparently. As the LPD reached 2.7 W cm−2, the flatter surface and closely arranged crystal grains were observed in Fig. 2(d). However, a rough surface and some pinholes appeared in the film after treatment by laser with a LPD of 3.1 W cm−2, which suggested that the laser irradiation pristine film with the higher PLD would induce distortion of surface structure, because CH3NH3PbI3 itself has poor heat stability. With the LPD further increasing to 4.1 W cm−2, CH3NH3I was sublimated before reacting with PbI2, so the grain size reduced and a large number of pinholes appeared in the film.

We prepared planar-heterojunction solar cells with a structure of FTO/compact TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of LI-CH3NH3PbI3 devices are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). When laser irradiation was 1.36 W cm−2, the corresponding devices showed a rather low short-current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of about 16.42 mA cm−2, 0.923 V, 0.56 and 8.5%, respectively. The PCE was gradually improved from 10.9% to 14.0% with the LPD increasing from 1.58 to 2.01 W cm−2. The optimal LPD is 2.7 W cm−2, and the device achieved a PCE of 16.5%, with Jsc, Voc, and FF of 21.45 mA cm−2, 1.140 V and 0.68, respectively. It is notable that the Voc was significantly increased and reached a maximum value 1.140 V when the LPD increased to 2.7 W cm−2, while the total voltage loss is significantly minimized to 0.41 V (Eg/q − Voc = 0.41 V) with respect to the band gap of 1.55 eV. In the iodide based PSCs, the small voltage loss (0.45–0.55 eV) is the most important nature to enhance the cell performance. Recently, Tress et al. have predicted that the limit of Voc of CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs through electroluminescence and photovoltaic quantum efficiency spectra, and the results demonstrated that the limit for Voc in the case of sole radiative recombination is determined as 1.33 V.13 In our work, the iodide based PSCs gained a high Voc of 1.140 V, which has a gap of 0.19 V from its theoretical maximum. Generally, the offset of non-radiative is about 0.23 V for CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. So the non-radiative losses are clearly reduced.22 However, if the LPD increased further to 3.1 W cm−2, the device showed a PCE of 15.5%, with Jsc, Voc, and FF being 22.20 mA cm−2, 1.014 V and 0.69, respectively. The change of Jsc and FF is negligible, but the Voc reduced dramatically from 1.140 V to 1.014 V compared with the device with the perovskite pristine film under laser irradiation of 2.7 W cm−2. With the LPD increasing to 4.1 W cm−2, the PCE reduced further and only remained at 9.2%. In addition, we investigated the influence of the LPD on the PCE of PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3(b). For low LPD, the devices exhibited poor PCE, which can be ascribed to insufficient crystallization. This result indicated that the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 films was closely related to the performance of the final device. The highest PCE suggested that the optimal LPD is 2.7 W cm−2. With the LPD further increasing, the PCE reduced rapidly due to the low thermal stability of the perovskite films.

Thermal annealing, one of the most commonly used crystallization methods in perovskite films, was applied by many researchers. To illustrate the advantages of laser irradiation, we choose the crystallization method of thermal annealing as a contrast experiment. The surface SEM and the cross-sectional SEM images of AT-CH3NH3PbI3 and LI-CH3NH3PbI3 films are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Besides the grain surfaces of the films becoming smooth after laser irradiation, there was no significant difference compared with the AT-CH3NH3PbI3 films. The optimal PCE is obtained through parameter optimization, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(a). The PSCs based on the AT-CH3NH3PbI3 devices exhibited good performance, and possessed a PCE of 16.5%, with a Jsc, Voc, and FF of 22.87 mA cm−2, 1.097 V and 0.66, respectively. However, the performance improved in the LI-CH3NH3PbI3 devices: the Voc increased from 1.097 to 1.146 V, the FF from 0.66 to 0.68, and the PCE from 16.5% to 17.8%. The J–V curve depending on scan rates and scan direction have been measured, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In addition, there was a negligible change in Jsc due to good crystallinity which has been already realized in the perovskite films via laser irradiation. The results showed that laser irradiation can yield high quality perovskite films with excellent photoelectronic properties, which indicates strongly the potential of laser irradiation as a new technique to crystallize the high quality light absorber layer of PSCs. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Voc of the devices with laser irradiation introduced increased by 49 meV compared with the thermal ones. In order to deny that the result above was an accidental phenomenon, we further made a statistical study by choosing 26 cells for each group. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the average Voc is 1.082 V with the TA-CH3NH3PbI3 devices while that is 1.114 V with the LI-CH3NH3PbI3 devices. In order to further analyze the reason why Voc has increased, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the potential mechanism. Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents the narrow-scan XPS spectra for the Pb 4f and I 3d regions on the surface of the perovskite films prepared via thermal annealing and laser irradiation, respectively. The atomic concentration and the atomic ratio of I/Pb are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The results demonstrated that the ratio of I/Pb reduced from 2.53 to 2.06. The stoichiometric ratio of I/Pb in the perovskite films deviated significantly from 3, which may be derived from CH3NH3I evaporation due to low thermal stability during the laser irradiation process, thus resulting in the formation of PbI2 on the surface of the perovskite films. In order to further confirm that PbI2 on the surface can effectively passivate the perovskite films, EIS was employed to investigate the recombination resistance (Rrec). Previous reports have clearly stated the corresponding relation between semicircles arc and resistance and capacitance in PSCs.23 Generally, the two semicircles are fitted using a simplified equivalent circuit, the first semicircle in the high frequency region is related to the charge at the Ag/HTM interface, while the other semicircle at the middle frequency region is related to the recombination at the TiO2/perovskite/HTM interface.23 As shown in Fig. 4(c), the difference is negligible in the first semicircle arc of LI-CH3NH3PbI3 and TA-CH3NH3PbI3 device, indicating that RHTM is the same. However, there is a clear difference in middle frequency region, which suggests that the LI-CH3NH3PbI3 device has higher Rrec than the TA-CH3NH3PbI3 device does at a 1.0 V bias voltage under dark conditions. In view of the transmission line patterns with a straight line followed by the first arc observed at 0–0.5 V, the Rrec was obtained from the EIS patterns at a 0.6 V to 1.0 V bias voltage (see Fig. S4, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4(d), the Rrec decreases obviously as the bias voltage increases. However, the Rrec of the LI-CH3NH3PbI3 device is always higher than that of the TA-CH3NH3PbI3 device at the same bias voltage. The LI-CH3NH3PbI3 device possesses a relatively high Rrec, suggesting the lower recombination rate, thus resulting in higher Voc. Therefore, a relatively minimal voltage loss is realized via the laser irradiation which could be attributed to the surface self-passivation effect of the perovskite film.

In summary, laser irradiation as an approach of rapid crystallization was introduced successfully to fabricate homogenous and dense-grained CH3NH3PbI3 films. Planar-heterojunction solar cells based on LI-CH3NH3PbI3 devices show an optimal PCE of 17.8% with a high Voc of 1.146 V. Due to the thermal gradient distribution of laser irradiation, a proper amount of PbI2 appeared on the surface, which effectively passivates the CH3NH3PbI3 film and reduces the surface state. The results suggest that suppressing the non-radiative recombination contributes to high performance, which is more critical to improve the Voc in PSCs.
