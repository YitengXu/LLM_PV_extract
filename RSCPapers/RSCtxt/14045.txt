    , Accepted 12th October 2022First published on 25th October 2022AbstractIt is highly desired to synchronously impart wearable, fast-healing, and self-adhesive properties in the biocompatible photoactive hydrogel sensor response to strain and temperature for different practical applications. In this work, we designed a multifunctional polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel with poly(dopamine)-modified carbon nanotubes (PVA/d-CNTs), which possesses a high self-healing efficiency of 83.08% within 5 s and strong adhesion to different substrates. Furthermore, the PVA/d-CNT sensor realizes full-range monitoring of human motion, with a broad strain range of up to ∼300%, and exhibits an impressive thermal response in human body temperature measurement for health information collection. In addition, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel with controllable temperature property quickly heats up to ∼85 °C in 50 s under near-infrared laser irradiation, indicating a potential application in photothermal therapy. Finally, a wireless monitoring system for human motion detection and an alarm circuit for high-temperature warning were implemented in the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor, demonstrating a promising potential application in multifunctional electronic skins, artificial intelligence, and intelligent robots.
Introduction
Wearable sensors have generated tremendous research interest in fields such as electronic skin (E-skin),1 human-machine interfaces,2,3 intelligent robots,4–6 and real-time healthcare monitoring.3,7–11 Among various soft physical sensors, hydrogels with biocompatibility, bionic structure of soft tissues, and tunable mechanical properties rank as promising candidates to mimic human somatosensory functions and perceive a change against stimuli.12–16 Multi-stimuli response integration in a smart sensor with a high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), broad strain sensing range, and high sensitivity is a highly desired goal to indicate healthy conditions and thermal environment in healthcare monitoring.17,18 Guo et al. proposed a zwitterionic hydrogel sensor to distinguish strain, glucose, and temperature information,19 which provided a real-time monitoring strategy for multi-stimuli response distinction in a single device.
Current hydrogel electronics suffer from irreversible damage by stretching, compressing, and piercing; a rapid self-repairing capability enables these devices to return to the original structure and functional state, thus improving the durability, lifetime, and reliability.18,20–22 In addition, strong adhesion is also essential for wearable hydrogel sensors to avoid delamination from human skin, enabling long-term signal acquisitions and high-fidelity signals, such as in electromyography and electrocardiography.20,21 A self-healing and adhesive poly(acrylic acid)-polyaniline binary-networked hydrogel was proposed to extend the sensor service life,18 which required 6 hours to restore 90.8% healing efficiency on rupture. The time-consuming healing speed (normally taking hours) would cause long-term breakdown of the wearable sensors, so elastomers with rapid self-healing property are highly anticipated but face challenges.23 Meanwhile, due to ease of application, spatiotemporal control, and noninvasive characteristics, light has produced far-reaching influence on modern medicine, including tissue engineering, photothermal therapy, and drug release.24,25 For example, a photoresponsive MXene nanosheet-loaded hydrogel dressing would promote skin cell proliferation to achieve wound healing without scarring.26 However, to date, it is still a great challenge to develop multifunctional hydrogel sensors with rapid self-healing as well as strong adhesive and photoactive properties in a single electronic component, which motivates the search for new strategies to facilely prepare high-performance, multifunctional conductive hydrogels.
CNTs not only possess intriguing electronic and mechanical properties for flexible sensor application27,28 but also exhibit great potential as a photothermal agent for wound treatment due to their strong near-infrared laser (NIR) radiation absorbance property.25 Nevertheless, on account of the CNTs' hydrophobic properties, poor solubility makes them difficult to disperse uniformly in a hydrogel network, thus failing to produce a homogeneous conductive hydrogel,27 further impairing their conductive, mechanical, and photothermal performance. Herein, in this study, a stretchable multifunctional photoactive biocompatible PVA hydrogel was proposed via a freeze-thawing method, which consisted of sodium borate, lithium chloride, and CNTs modified by poly(dopamine) (PDA). The resultant multifunctional hydrogel sensor (denoted as PVA/d-CNT hydrogel) simultaneously realized good linearity within a broad strain range (0–300%) for large human motion (e.g., elbow bending) as well as tiny human motion (e.g., swallowing, smile) recognition, satisfactory temperature sensitivity, satisfactory thermosensing (0.027 °C−1), rapid self-healing property (83.08% efficiency after 5 s and 97.42% efficiency after 30 min), strong adhesion, and superior light-to-heat conversion capability (from ∼22 to ∼90 °C within 100 s). Finally, a thermal perception alarm system and a real-time motion monitoring system were built to demonstrate the feasibility of the multifunctional PVA/d-CNT hydrogel in future wearable health-monitoring electronics, E-skin, and soft robot applications.
Experimental section
Materials
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-1799) was purchased from Macleans Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Reaction reagents dopamine (C18H11NO2·HCl, 98%), tris (C4H11NO3, 99%), lithium chloride (LiCl ≈99.9%), sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B4O7·10H2O), glycerine, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs ≥ 95%, length: 10–20 μm, outside diameter: 30–50 nm, internal diameter: 5–12 nm) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. All of these reagents were used directly as received without further processing. Deionized (DI) water was used as a dispersing solvent in all experiments.
Preparation of PVA hydrogel and PVA/d-CNT hydrogel
PVA powder (0.1 g) was added to 10 ml DI water, which was then stirred rapidly at 90 °C for 6 h to obtain a clear and transparent PVA sol. Subsequently, the PVA sol was transferred to a Petri dish and placed into the freezer (−20 °C) for 48 h. After the solution was fully frozen, the frozen PVA gel was thawed at room temperature to acquire the PVA hydrogel. For poly(dopamine) (PDA)-modified CNT (d-CNT) preparation, 0.125 g tris was dissolved in 100 ml deionized water to keep the pH value at 8.5. Then, 0.2 g CNTs and 0.2 g dopamine were dispersed in the above weakly alkaline solution accompanied by vigorous stirring for 24 h. Finally, d-CNTs (Fig. S1a–d†) were obtained after vacuum filtration and drying. Thereafter, for PVA/d-CNT hydrogel preparation, 0.05 g PDA-CNT and 1 g PVA were mixed uniformly in 10 ml deionized water and stirred at 90 °C for 6 h. Then, 0.004 g Na2B4O7·10H2O was introduced into the solution with continuous agitation. Once the reactant was completely dissolved, the hydrogel was prepared by a freezing and thawing method according to the above preparation method for PVA. Later on, the hydrogel was immersed into 1.5 M LiCl for 12 h and 30 wt% glycerol/water to achieve solvent exchange. Lastly, the sample was rinsed with deionized water to remove excess residual ions and obtain the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel.
Characterization
The morphology of CNTs modified by PDA and freeze-dried hydrogel was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100), respectively. Hydrogel samples (25 × 10 × 1 mm3) were placed in ambient atmosphere condition (23 ± 2 °C, RH = 55%) for 4 days for weight loss measurement. The tensile mechanical properties and adhesive strength of PVA/d-CNT and PVA hydrogels were tested on a force gauge (Mark-10) equipped with a motorized standing test (ESM303) at room temperature. The electromechanical sensing properties of the hydrogel sensor were evaluated on a custom-made tensile testing equipment with a digital source meter (KEYSIGHT B2902A) at a 0.1 V voltage. The hydrogel photothermal performance was recorded using a thermal infrared camera (FLIR, Arlington, VA), exposed under a 980 nm laser (MDL-III-980-200 mW) for a period of time at different power densities. For the “artificial fever” experiment, a hair dryer blown towards human skin was employed to increase the temperature to simulate human fever. All human body-related trials were conducted in accordance with the relevant laws. Before participating in the experiment, all subjects gave written informed consent.
Results and discussion
The wearable, self-healing, and adhesive photoactive PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was prepared by using a freeze-thawing method29,30 with the assistance of sodium borate, lithium chloride, glycerol, and PDA-modified CNTs (Fig. 1). The detailed fabrication process of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel is described in the Experimental section. PVA was employed as the crosslinking network because of its ideal biodegradability and biocompatibility.21,28 After freeze-thawing, the phase transformation process of the conductive hydrogel occurred from sol state to gel state (Fig. 1i–iii). The porous network structure in the freeze-dried PVA/d-CNT hydrogel (Fig. S2a†) would enhance the rapid response to stimuli and mechanical stretchability. The moisture retention of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel would be greatly improved by adding the organic solvent glycerin and hygroscopic lithium salt,31–34 which can maintain 82.1% weight after 4 days in ambient atmosphere (Fig. S2d†). As a sharp contrast, ∼71% weight was lost in the absence of lithium chloride and glycerol. To ensure uniform dispersion in the PVA matrix, the CNTs, which determined the change of relative resistance and provided photothermal effect, were modified by PDA for interfacial compatibility improvement between CNTs and PVA.35–37 As shown in Fig. S2b and c,† the d-CNTs dispersed uniformly in PVA matrix, which endowed excellent performance to the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel.

The self-healing property of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel results from the synergistic effect of the dynamic borate bonds of sodium borate and functional groups in PDA.28 On one hand, borate ions provided reversible healing sites that would be complexed with the rich hydroxyl groups in PVA. On the other hand, the abundance of amino and catechol groups in PDA also can construct reversible hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of PVA. In addition, the fracture strain and ultimate tensile stress of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel (475%, 0.68 kPa) were better than the pure PVA hydrogel (377%, 0.62 kPa), derived from the strengthening effect of the PDA-modified CNTs (Fig. S2e†).
Meanwhile, inspired by the adhesion behaviour of mussels, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogels exhibited unique self-adhesion from the catechol groups of PDA chains, which enabled the hydrogel sensor to be directly attached onto human skin (Fig. 2a) and other objects, such as a plastic Petri dish, metal spoon, glass slide, and latex glove (Fig. 2b), without additional adhesive. The adhesion property could be intuitively observed from the peeling process from skin (Fig. 2a). It was clear that there was no residue on the surface after hydrogel removal, providing a route for biological dressing design. A tensile adhesive test was carried out to quantify the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel's adhesion strength to different surfaces (Fig. 2c), where the strong adhesion strength was ∼45.6 kPa for human skin, ∼3.6 kPa for latex glove, ∼18.7 kPa for glass, ∼7.8 kPa for plastic, and ∼3.1 kPa for metal, respectively.

(c) The adhesive strength of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel to different substrates. (d) Repeatable adhesion property of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel to human skin. 
Compared to other substrates, the highest adhesive strength to skin was observed, which mainly resulted from the binding interaction between the catechol groups of PDA and the –NH2 and –SH groups on the tissue surface through Michael addition and the Schiff base reaction.38 It is worth noting that the adhesion strength of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel would decrease with soaking time due to the water content increase and surface chain density decrease of the hydrogel (Fig. S3a and b†). Moreover, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel exhibited repeatable adhesion capability to the surface of different objects. As shown in Fig. 2d, the adhesion strength remained almost constant on human skin over 20 consecutive adhesion/peeling-off tests (see Fig. S4† for other substrate surfaces), suggesting its use as a promising binder and an E-skin candidate. This reversible self-adhesive property facilitated the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel to realize convenient wearing, removal, and accurate motion monitoring.
As an essential component of functional electronic skin, mechanical strain perception is indispensable. The electromechanical performance of the stretchable PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor (Fig. 3a) was evaluated by monitoring its relative resistance change (ΔR/R0) upon different strain changes. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor can monitor various levels of tensile strain from 15% to 300% with excellent reliability, which is comparable with the human motion range. Additionally, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was also sensitive enough to small strains less than 10% for subtle motion detection (Fig. S5†). In the strain sensor field, frequency dependence is considered a major characteristic.39,40 There was no obvious frequency-related peak loss and hysteresis when different tensile speeds from 75 mm min−1 to 175 mm min−1 were applied (Fig. 3d), demonstrating the reliable response of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor to stimuli in practical application.

(b) Relative resistance changes (ΔR/R0) upon four stretching–releasing cycles at strains less than 100% and (c) between 100–300%.

(f) ΔR/R0 as a function of applied strains up to 300% and the corresponding GFs. (g) Relative resistance changes of pure PVA and PVA/d-CNTs at 100% strain. (h) Relative resistance changes of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor during 150 consecutive cycles under 100% strain at a stretching rate of 150 mm min−1. 
Meanwhile, quick response (∼150 ms) and recovery (∼252 ms) time were produced in the hydrogel sensor at 60% strain (Fig. 3e), which facilitated the rapid detection of different motions. Gauge factor (GF) was calculated to evaluate the sensitivity at different strain ranges of ∼0–100%, ∼100–175%, and ∼175–300%, giving ∼1.08, ∼1.04, and ∼1.30, respectively (Fig. 3f). The three linear regions with different slopes stemmed from the change of contact resistance and tunnelling resistance under different strains.27 As shown in Fig. 3g, the PVA/d-CNT sensor performance, in terms of resistance change, was obviously superior to pure PVA hydrogel, which resulted from the synergistic effect of the changes in ionic conductivity and contact conditions of the CNTs for electron conduction upon stretching. Stability and durability are also crucial factors for strain sensor application, and the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor displayed favorable repeatability with inappreciable fluctuation in ΔR/R0 during the 150 consecutive cycles at 100% strain, demonstrating anti-fatigue property for long-term use in practical application (Fig. 3h).
Based on the high sensing performance, including excellent stability, large sensing range, fast response, and good adhesion to human skin, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensors have great potential to monitor a full range of human motions for health evaluation. For instance, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel could be directly adhered to a finger or elbow for large-scale human motion monitoring (Fig. 4a and b) without additional binder or adhesive tape. When the finger was bent from 0° to 90° (Fig. 4a), a step-like ascent in the relative resistance could be monitored and distinguished, respectively. Besides the large-range motion detection, tiny muscle movements in swallowing and smiling (Fig. 4c and d) can also be precisely detected with repeatable electrical signals, indicating that the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor is suitable for healthcare monitoring. To demonstrate the practicability of the real-time detection of human motion, the PVA/d-CNT sensor was integrated into a wireless system consisting of a smartphone and digital multimeter with a bluetooth module (Fig. 4e). The sensor resistance changed stably and regularly with the bending and straightening of the volunteer's index finger, which was real-time monitored and displayed through the mobile phone software (Fig. 4f and Movie S1†).

The inset data displayed on the mobile phone corresponds to the (f) real-time monitoring of finger-bending movements. 
Like the typical self-healing ability of human skin, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel with self-healing property was designed to resist damage and enhance the sensor lifetime. The healable property of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel connected in series with a LED indicator is demonstrated in Fig. 5a and b.

(g) Relative resistance changes of 5 s self-healed PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor over 150 consecutive cycles under 100% strain at a stretching rate of 150 mm min−1. 
After being completely separated, the hydrogel could be healed quickly to light the LED with a driving voltage of 3 V after bringing the two furcated parts together. To deeply evaluate the self-healing process and recovery of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel conductivity, the real-time resistance change was monitored. As a visual demonstration, the damaged hydrogel would self-heal sufficiently for 5 s to withstand a great amount of stretching (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, when the two cut pieces of hydrogel were brought together, the resistance dropped quickly within 1.5 s due to the synergistic effect of dynamic borate bonds and functional groups in PDA with the hydroxyl groups in PVA,28 which resume conductive behavior repeatedly without any external stimulation. The self-healing property of PVA/d-CNTs was comparable or superior to those in other selected important works (Table S1†). Furthermore, tensile tests were also conducted to quantitatively assess the self-healing capacity of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel (Fig. 5e). The original stress–strain curve indicated that the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel could be stretched to ∼450% with a maximal stress of ∼0.65 kPa. The mechanical healing efficiency (ηmec = εh/ε0 × 100%; εh, the stress after self-healing; ε0, the original stress) was employed to assess the mechanical self-healing ability. As shown in Fig. 5e, the mechanical property and ηmec of healable PVA/d-CNTs hydrogel increased with the self-healing time. When the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was cut and then self-healed for 5 s, 10 min, and 30 min, the maximum stress also increased to 0.54 kPa (∼348% strain), 0.58 kPa (∼392% strain), and 0.63 kPa (∼431% strain), corresponding to the ηmec of ∼83.08%, ∼89.23%, and ∼97.42%, respectively. To further assess the healing effect, the sensor performance of the healed PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5f, the sensing performance was quickly and effectively restored after self-healing for ∼5 s. In addition, the performance of the healed PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor was basically the same as the initial state over 150 consecutive cycles under 100% strain (Fig. 5g), demonstrating the excellent self-healing capability of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel.
Human skin detects not only mechanical deformation but also external temperature stimulation to avoid the harm caused by high temperature.41,42 The thermal response sensitivity of the PDA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor was evaluated by referring to the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), which is represented by the slope in Fig. 6a. The resistance of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor decreased with environmental temperature increase (Fig. 6a), which resulted from the increased mobility and concentration of ions in hydrogel sensors with elevated temperatures43 and demonstrated the thermo-sensation property. During both the heating and cooling process, a highly linear thermal response was reflected with TCR values of 2.7% °C−1. To further illustrate the thermosensitive property, the instantaneous resistance variation of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel temperature sensor is exhibited in Fig. 6b. The relative resistance of the PVA/d-CNT sensor increased as it neared the cold source (ice, 0 °C) due to the reduced ionic mobility at lower temperature, reaching the maximum when the ice touched the sensor. Then, the thermosensitive sensor was brought near the heat source (warm water, 40 °C), leading to the decrease of the relative resistance. For the purpose of simulating the human skin application scenario, a beaker filled with warm (40 °C) and cold (30 °C) water, successively, was brought near the PVA/CNT hydrogel sensor (Fig. 6c). The variation of ΔR/R0 displayed distinct divergence and negligible deviation, demonstrating the repeatability, stability, and temperature-discriminating capacity of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel temperature sensor in the response to different temperatures. In terms of the overall performance, including TCR value, temperature-sensing range, self-healing property, and response to strain and temperature stimuli, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel temperature sensor performance was comparable to or better than that of some other reported important temperature sensors (Table S2†).

(b) Real-time relative resistance changes of the PVA/d-CNTs hydrogel sensor approaching a cold source (ice) and heat source (warm water). (c) Instantaneous relative resistance changes of the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor to warm (40 °C) and cold (30 °C) water. (d–f) Current variation after “artificial fever” and bringing down the fever, corresponding to the infrared images of a human wrist. (g) A PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor attached to a finger for heat source sensing, with corresponding photographs of the alarm circuit and LCD screen for warning message display. 
Next, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor was employed as a wearable bracelet to demonstrate the real-time thermosensitive response for human temperature monitoring. The self-adhesive PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was directly attached to a volunteer's wrist, matching the skin temperature quickly within 10 s (Fig. S6†). The hydrogel “fever indicator” was sensitive to skin temperature change, in which current increased from ∼21.3 μA to ∼24.7 μA with temperature increase from ∼36.8 °C to 39.1 °C after the “artificial fever” (Fig. 6d and e). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 6e and f, this “fever indicator” also can reflect the antipyretic process with a current decrease, which was also confirmed by the distinct difference in temperature obtained from the infrared thermal image. In the same way, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor could be adhered to other areas, such as the forehead or armpit, to achieve local temperature capture. Notably, this thermosensitive sensor also can be integrated in the e-skin to realize a high temperature warning function. As displayed in Fig. 6g and Movie S2,† the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was attached to a volunteer's index finger, which was protected against high temperature and connected in series with an alarm circuit with a liquid crystal display (LCD). When the finger touched the heat source (hot water at 80 °C), an alarm message of the word “Hot” would display on the screen immediately to avoid further damage.
Besides the strain and temperature-sensing properties, the multifunctional PVA/d-CNT hydrogel also can act as a photoactive medium to efficiently increase the temperature by utilizing solar energy for healthcare. The increased temperature under exposure to NIR laser light could promote pain relief, wound healing, bone tissue engineering, and cancer treatment by accelerating the microcirculatory blood.25,44–46 The temperature of PVA/d-CNT hydrogel reached ∼80 °C in 50 s and ∼90 °C within 100 s (Fig. 7a and b) under λ = 980 nm laser irradiation (200 mW cm−2), corresponding to the photothermal images for temperature change process in Fig. 7d. The saturation temperature could be easily tuned by controlling the power density, indicating a tunable photothermal property for different applications. It should be pointed out that the pure PVA hydrogel did not exhibit any photothermal conversion, and the PVA hydrogel mixed with individual poly(dopamine) or CNTs exhibited weaker photothermal conversion (Fig. S7†), indicating that the synergistic effect of poly(dopamine) and CNTs were responsible for the efficient photothermal conversion. In addition, for the PVA/CNT hydrogel in which the CNTs were not modified by PDA, mean saturation temperature was 46.6 ± 5.2 °C (Fig. S8a†). In sharp contrast, the PVA/d-CNTs hydrogel exhibited a more homogeneous temperature distribution (87.3 ± 2.3 °C, Fig. S8b†), further demonstrating the uniform distribution of d-CNTs in the PVA hydrogel. The stable photothermal property of the photoactive PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was demonstrated with 30 on/off cycles under 140 mW cm−2 laser irradiation in Fig. 7c. This photothermal conversion effect enabled the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel to serve as an optical sensor for NIR light detection. In addition, due to the good biocompatibility of PVA and CNTs, this multifunctional PVA/d-CNT hydrogel possesses a great promising application in wearable electronic devices.

Conclusion
In summary, a wearable, self-adhesive, self-healing, and photoactive multifunctional PVA/d-CNT hydrogel was successfully fabricated by a facile freeze-thawing method. This hydrogel sensor can be easily tailored and directly attached to human skin to detect the change of human temperature and motions for health information collection. The real-time electrical response to strain can be remotely monitored by wireless communication with a mobile phone, and a warning signal for high temperature can be visually displayed by integrating the PVA/d-CNT thermosensitive sensor into an alarm circuit. Due to the reversible healing sites provided by sodium borate and PDA, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel exhibited fast healing property to extend the service life. Additionally, under NIR laser irradiation, the PVA/d-CNT hydrogel with controllable temperature property would increase from ∼22 °C to ∼85 °C within 50 s, providing a photothermal therapy approach in healthcare by accelerating microcirculatory blood. We believe that the multifunctional PVA/d-CNT hydrogel sensor provides a meaningful and adaptive platform for a wide range of applications, including healthcare monitoring, human-machine interaction, and intelligent robots.
