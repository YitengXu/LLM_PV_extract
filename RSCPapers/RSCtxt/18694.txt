    , Accepted 20th November 2017First published on 20th November 2017AbstractSilver nanotetrahedron (AgNT) two-dimensional arrays on a glass substrate generate nonthermal hot electrons, which induced photocatalytic oxidation of 4,4-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) adsorbed onto its surface. The rate of the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB is found to decrease upon increasing the intensity of the excitation light, unlike traditional photocatalysis reactions. The amount of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP) resulting from the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB is lower than expected, suggesting the partial desorption of DMAB or 4-NTP molecules from the surface of the AgNTs. However, the hot electrons remaining from the photocatalysis reaction thermalize and transfer their energy to the nanoparticle lattices, generating heat. The photothermal heat is sufficient to dissociate the Ag–S bond causing desorption of both DMAB and 4-NTP.
Introduction
When a plasmonic nanoparticle, such as those made from gold or silver, interacts with light at its resonance frequency, a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) field is generated.1–4 The plasmon field of the nanoparticles enhances different optical phenomena that are based on electronic transitions, such as Raman scattering by an analyte located in the domain of the field,5–9 the fluorescence of a fluorophore that is relatively near the nanoparticle surface but at a sufficient distance to permit fluorescence quenching,10,11 light absorption and scattering by the nanoparticles,12 and vibrational spectroscopy through reinforcing the dipole moment of compounds near the surface of the plasmonic nanoparticle.13 Because of the exciting properties of the plasmonic nanoparticles, they were used in many useful applications, such as use as an optical wave guide when the particles are linearly aligned with an equal separation gap,14 a solar cells’ collimator that enhances the efficiency of solar cells via light focusing on a nanoscale,15,16 and optical nanosensing.17–19 Plasmonic nanoparticles were also used in optoelectrical switching when coated with electrochromic materials and in optomechanical switching20–23 when bound to the surface of an elastic polymer substrate.24
The surface plasmon resonance of the excited plasmonic nanoparticles dephases in a few femtoseconds, emitting photons that are observable as scattering, and generating electron–hole pairs that cause light absorption.25 The electrons are excited to energy states higher than the Fermi level, suggesting a nonthermal distribution according to Fermi–Dirac statistics.25 The nonthermal hot electrons can excite electronic or vibrational transitions in molecules adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles, thereby inducing photochemical reactions.26,27 Within a few hundred femtoseconds, due to electron–electron scattering and electron scattering with the surface, the remaining hot electrons thermalize to temperatures that are hundreds of degrees above the surrounding lattice.25,28 One picosecond after the initial excitation of the plasmonic nanoparticle, the thermally hot electrons relax and transfer their energy to the lattice through electron–phonon interactions.25 Finally, the thermal energy dissipates to the surrounding medium by thermal conduction through lattice vibrations.29 The hot electrons of the plasmonic nanoparticles can induce photochemical reactions,26,30–33 such as the photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen26,27 and the heterogeneous photocatalytic epoxidation of ethylene.30 It is unclear whether plasmonic photothermal heating has an impact on the photochemical reaction induced by nonthermal hot electrons.
Plasmonic nanoparticles was used to enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2 2-D layer.34 The hot-electrons of the excited plasmonic nanoparticles enhanced the catalytic efficiency of MoS2 by the charge transfer and by the photothermal heating effect. However, the heat generated by the plasmonic nanoparticles induced the structural phase transition of MoS2 into most active catalytic form. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of the MoS2 was improved by increasing the power of the light that excites the plasmonic nanoparticles.
It is aimed to study the effect of the photothermal heating by optically exciting plasmonic nanoparticles such as silver nanotetrahedrons (AgNTs) on the photocatalytic oxidation of 4,4-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) adsorbed on their surfaces. The photocatalytic oxidation is induced by nonthermal hot electrons produced in the optically excited AgNTs. The remaining hot electrons thermalize and transfer their energy to the nanoparticle lattices, generating heat. To study the effect of increasing the number of hot electrons on the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB adsorbed on AgNTs, time-dependent surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) were collected at different light excitation intensities. The number of hot electrons is directly proportional to the intensity of the exciting light; interestingly, the yield of the product is found to decrease upon increasing the intensity of the exciting light. The decrease in the yield upon increasing the intensity of the exciting light suggests a negative impact of the photothermal heating on the plasmonic photochemical reaction with the AgNTs. As only photons absorbed by the plasmonic nanoparticles, not the scattered photons, are responsible for formation of the hot electrons, the ratio of the absorption spectrum to the scattering spectrum of the AgNT is calculated by using the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) technique.
Experimental
AgNT two-dimensional (2-D) arrays were fabricated by the colloidal overgrowth of a silver hemispherical (AgHS) monolayer on the surface of a glass substrate. The AgHSs monolayer resulted from the annealing of a monolayer assembly of colloidally prepared silver nanodisks (AgNDs).
Colloidal AgNDs were prepared as reported earlier.35 Briefly, 0.12 mL of aqueous 5 mM NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a stirred solution containing a mixture of aqueous solutions of 200 mL from 0.145 mM poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (MW = 55000) (PVP, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.60 mL from 60 mM AgNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 3 mL of 78.35 mM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). After a few seconds, the colorless solution turned purple due to the formation of AgNDs. AgNDs were precipitated out of the solution via 40 min centrifugation at 12000 rpm in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The AgNDs precipitated from 200 mL of solution were dispersed in 50 mL deionized (DI) water. Then, the AgNDs were reprecipitated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 30 min. The AgNDs precipitate was then dispersed in 5 mL ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min. Finally, the precipitated AgNDs were dispersed in 2 mL of ethanol and diluted with 4 mL of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). 2 mL of the AgNDs in chloroform was sprayed over a Nima 611D Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) trough filled with water using a microsyringe. After 30 min, the AgNDs monolayer was transferred to a 2.54 cm × 2.54 cm glass substrate at 0 mN m−1 surface pressure by vertical dipping.
To prepare AgHSs, the prepared AgND monolayer on the surface of the glass substrate was annealed at 200 °C in a furnace for 30 min. AgNDs turned into AgHSs after annealing. The hot substrate was then left inside a desiccator for 30 min to cool. AgHSs on the glass substrate were immersed in a 200 mL boiled solution of 7.5 mM trisodium citrate trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich). While stirring, 3 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the growth solution. After 4 min, the substrate was transferred to 200 mL 60 °C hot DI water and left for 5 min. Finally, the substrate was left to dry inside a desiccator for 2 h.
4-Nitrothiophenol (4-NTP) was adsorbed onto the surface of AgNT 2-D arrays by immersing the glass substrate in 0.1 mM aqueous solution for 12 h. 4-NTP binds to the surface of AgNT through thiol group. However, the thiol group replaces PVP and citrate capping materials. The substrate was rinsed with DI water to remove the unadsorbed 4-NTP. 4-NTP was dimerized into DMAB by irradiation with 532 nm laser of power 2, 4, 10, and 20 mW for 3 min, the laser power was measured after passing through a 50× microscope lens, the laser cross section was 4 μm. DMAB on AgNTs was irradiated with 532 nm laser of power 2, 4, 10, and 20 mW and the SERS measurements were conducted for the DMAB on AgNT arrays using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope. An Ocean Optics HR4000Cg-UV-NIR was used in the optical measurements. A Digital Instruments Dimension-3000 atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to characterize the topography of the nanoparticle arrays. The LSPR extinction, absorption, and scattering spectra of a AgNT with an edge length of 80 nm were calculated using DDSCAT 7.3 software. The dipole density in the shape file is one dipole per nm3. The air and glass dielectric functions were used in the DDA calculation, and circularly polarized light was used for excitation.
Results and discussion
Fabrication of AgNT 2-D arrays on glass substrate
Catalysts and photocatalysts at the nanoscale show excellent efficiency.36 However, due to the small size of the nanocatalyst, recycling after the reaction limits their broad applications.36 Binding the nanocatalysts to a surface of a substrate could be a possible solution for their handling difficulties.37 Different techniques have been used to fabricate nanocatalysts on the surface of substrates.38,39 Substrates coated with nanocatalyst arrays of large surface area are useful for industrial applications. Most of the nanoparticle arrays fabricated by the common lithographic techniques are polycrystalline,40 which is not favorable in many catalytic reactions. However, in many catalytic reactions, the selectivity and activity involve catalysts of characteristic surface atomic density.41 A colloidal chemical technique has been used successfully to prepare nanoparticles of controlled shape, size, composition, and crystal structure.42–44 Assembly of the colloidal nanoparticles on the surface of a substrate improved their catalytic applications.39 The LB technique was used to assemble the colloidally prepared nanoparticles on the surface of different substrates of different dimensions.45 Capping materials are used during the synthesis of nanoparticles to control the shape of the prepared nanoparticles and to stabilize them in the solvent.42–44 Such capping materials bound to the surface of the nanoparticles assist their order inside the LB 2-D assembly and improve their adhesion to the surface of the substrates.20
Colloidally prepared AgNDs capped with PVP were assembled into a monolayer on the surface of quartz substrate using the LB technique.46,47 However, the top face of the AgND is bound with {111} facet while the side is terminated with a mixture of both {111} and {100} facets.48 AgNDs are expected to catalyze successfully reactions that are induced on the {111} surface. The presence of a planar defect in the center of the AgND decreases its thermal stability.48 Thermal treatment of the nanoparticles on the surface of a substrate improves their crystallographic properties and enhances the particle/substrate adhesion force due to the wetting of the melted nanoparticles to the substrate.49 Decreasing the size of the nanoparticle reduces its melting point.50 Melting a nanoparticle of any shape turns it into a thermodynamically stable polyhedral Wulff shape.49 Annealing AgND 2-D arrays on a glass substrate at 200 °C for 30 min leads to the formation of AgHSs on the {111} and {100} facets with equal surface area percent.49 The presence of two different facets on the surface of the nanocatalyst lowers its catalytic specificity.41 Although thermal treatment improves the crystallographic properties and the stability of the nanoparticle on the surface of the substrate, it has a negative impact on the nanoparticle's shape. Fig. 1A shows an AFM image of AgNTs resulting from the overgrowth of AgHSs on the surface of a glass substrate via the reduction of Ag+ using citrate ions. The average edge length of the AgNTs is 80.7 ± 5.6 nm, as obtained from the statistical analysis of the edge lengths of the AgNTs inside the arrays in the AFM image. Fig. 1B is a higher magnification AFM image of AgNTs on the glass substrate. The topographical cross section along the center of a single AgNT is shown in Fig. 1C. The height of the AgNT is ∼80 nm. AgNT is terminated mainly with the {111} facet, making it a good, selective catalyst. Using the overgrowth technique, two goals were accomplished: fabrication of AgNT 2-D arrays of characteristic surface energy and large surface area and strong binding of such arrays with the surface of the substrate. However, the AgNTs resulted from the overgrowth of AgHSs seed crystals, which are strongly bound to the surface of the substrate.

Optical properties of the silver tetrahedral nanoparticle 2-D arrays
The extinction LSPR spectrum of plasmonic nanoparticles consists of an LSPR absorption spectrum and scattering spectrum.51 The LSPR peak position, the ratio between the absorption and scattering spectrum, and the features of the LSPR spectrum depend on the shape, size, and composition of the plasmonic nanoparticle.51 The photons absorbed by the plasmonic nanoparticles only are responsible for the generation of hot electrons, which induce photochemical reactions on the surface of the particles,26,30–33 transfer energy to electronic systems,26,27 or decay into photothermal heating.52 Consequently, it is useful to study the optical properties of the photonanocatalyst. Fig. 2A is the LSPR spectrum of AgNT 2-D arrays on the surface of a glass substrate. The LSPR showed multiple shoulders, which were deconvoluted into four peaks at 489, 438, 392, and 359 nm. To confirm the accuracy of the deconvolution of the experimental LSPR spectrum into four peaks, a DDA calculation was carried out to simulate the LSPR spectrum of a AgNT on a glass slab, as shown in Fig. 2B. Interestingly, the simulated spectrum showed four LSPR peaks at 491, 439, 396, and 356 nm. The theoretical extinction LSPR spectrum of the AgNTs agreed well with the measured LSPR spectrum with minimal error. Fig. 2B is the LSPR absorption and scattering spectrum of a single AgNT simulated by the DDA technique. The good match between the experimental and theoretical LSPR extinction spectra made it possible to confirm the accuracy of the calculated LSPR absorption and scattering spectra. However, most of the extinction spectrum arose from plasmonic light absorption rather than plasmonic light scattering. This makes the AgNTs an efficient photocatalyst for producing hot electrons.

(B) LSPR spectrum experimentally measured (black), theoretically simulated spectrum for 80 nm AgNT: extinction spectrum (red), absorption spectrum (blue), and scattering spectrum (cyan). The majority of the LSPR spectrum of AgNT is based on light absorption rather than light scattering. 
Preparation of DMAB by the photocatalytic dimerization of 4-NTP
DMAB was prepared from the photodimerization reaction of 4-NTP adsorbed on the surface of AgNTs.53–55 The photodimerization reaction is slightly fast, Fig. 3A shows the SERS spectrum of 4-NTP adsorbed on the surface of AgNT 2-D arrays after irradiation with a 532 nm laser with powers 2, 4, 10, and 20 mW for 3 min. Two weak SERS bands are observed at 1190 and 1331 cm−1, which are assigned to the symmetric stretching vibrational modes of ν(C–N) and ν(NO2) of 4-NTP, respectively. A SERS band that appeared at 1145 cm−1 is assigned as a ν(C–N) stretching vibration of DMAB. Finally, two SERS bands are detected at 1443 and 1392 cm−1, corresponding to the ν(NN) stretching vibration of DMAB. The relatively intense SERS bands of DMAB and the weak bands of 4-NTP confirm the high yield formation of DMAB from photodimerized 4-NTP. Finally, two SERS bands at 1577 and 1074 cm−1 are assigned to the ν(C–C) stretching and ν(CH) bending of the aromatic rings of both 4-NTP and DMAB.

It is easy to determine the amount of dimerized 4-NTP into DMAB at different laser excitation powers, because the SERS enhancement depends on the Raman Laser power and the Raman cross section of the 4-NTP is higher than that of DMAB.56 consequently, the efficiency of the photocatalytic dimerization of 4-NTP on the surface of AgNT, at any laser excitation power, can be estimated by dividing the value of the intensity of the SERS band at 1392 cm−1 characteristic for the DMAB by the value of the SERS band intensity at 1331 cm−1 of 4-NTP (see Fig. 3A). The average ratio between the amount of DMAB and the amount of remaining 4-NTP value are 4.0 ± 0.1, 8.5 ± 0.6, 5.8 ± 0.5, and 2.0 ± 0.1 when the photocatalytic dimerization reaction was carried out under laser irradiation powers of 2, 4, 10, and 20 mW, respectively. However, the photocatalytic conversion is increased by increasing the power of the exciting laser from 2 to 4 mW, and then decreased by increasing the laser power to 10 mW. Furthermore, when the laser power was increased from 10 to 20 mW, the ratio of DMAB is decreased.
The nonlinear relationship between the increase of the laser power and the photocatalytic dimerization efficiency of 4-NTP could be attributed to the following: the photodimerization of 4-NTP are induced by the hot-electrons of the excited AgNTs and the number of hot-electrons increases by increasing the power of the exciting laser.3,57 Increasing the number of hot-electrons lead to the increase of the yield of DMAB first. However, when the power of the exciting light was increased further, the unconsumed hot-electrons thermalized the photocatalyst disturbing the orientation of 4-NTP58 and could be the reason of lowering the dimerization efficiency. This is could also be the reason that the SERS bands of 4-NTP did not fully disappear because not all the 4-NTP dimerized, but those with the proper orientation dimerized.56Fig. 3B shows a schematic representation of the photodimerization of 4-NTP on the surface of an excited plasmonic nanoparticle into DMAB.
Photothermal effect on the photocatalysis by the hot electrons of plasmonic nanoparticles
Different photochemical reactions can be catalyzed by optically excited plasmonic nanoparticles.26,30–33,59,60 The effect of unused hot-electrons on the photocatalysis reaction that thermalizes the nanoparticle surface has not been fully addressed. To study the effect of the photothermal heating on the heterogeneous photocatalysis by plasmonic nanoparticles, oxidation of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNTs through thiol groups was used as a model reaction.
Time-dependent SERS was used successfully to probe the chemical and physical changes that take place close to the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles over time.39,55,61 The SERS technique was used to study the photocatalysis induced by plasmonic nanoparticles.39,55 To study the plasmonic photothermal effect on the photocatalysis efficiency of AgNTs, the DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNTs was illuminated with a 532 nm laser with a power of 2 mW, and the SERS spectrum was collected after different times (see Fig. 4A). The intensities of the SERS bands corresponding to DMAB are found to decrease upon increasing the laser illumination time. Fig. 5A shows the relationship between the value of the SERS band intensity at 1392 cm−1 characteristic of DMAB and the irradiation time. Conversely, the Raman band of the stretching vibration of the nitro group of 4-NTP, which appeared at 1340 cm−1, is increased by increasing the laser irradiation time, as shown in Fig. 5B. This suggests that DMAB is oxidized back to 4-NTP as the irradiation time is increased. Recent studies showed that during the oxidation of ethylene on the surface of photoexcited silver nanocubes, molecular oxygen photodissociated into atoms.30 The oxidation of DMAB could be due to one of two causes: (1) formation of atomic oxygen, which oxidizes the DMAB to 4-NTP or (2) injection of the hot electrons into the orbitals of DMAB adsorbed on the AgNT surfaces causing the excited DMAB to interact with atmospheric oxygen.27 The Raman cross section of the 4-NTP is higher than that of DMAB.56 Consequently, the amount of 4-NTP obtained after the irradiation of DMAB is less than expected, which suggests partial desorption of DMAB or 4-NTP molecules from the surface of the AgNTs. This may be due to the photothermal heat generated by AgNTs, which is enough to dissociate the Ag–S bond of either DMAB or 4-NTP. The effect of plasmonic photothermal heating on the photocatalysis oxidation of DMAB adsorbed on AgNTs can be confirmed by increasing the power of the excitation laser.

(E) A depiction of the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNTs induced by the 532 nm laser. Both the 4-NTP and DMAB are possibly desorbed from the surface of AgNTs due to the photothermal heating effect.

Time-dependent SERS spectra of DMAB adsorbed on AgNTs and excited with a 532 nm laser with powers 4, 10, and 20 mW for different times are shown in Fig. 4B–D, respectively. Fig. 5A and B depict the relationship between the characteristic SERS band intensities of DMAB and 4-NTP collected after laser irradiation of varying powers and durations. Irradiation of DMAB adsorbed on AgNTs with the laser with a power of 4 mW led to the increase of the intensity of SERS bands of 4-NTP and a decrease of the SERS band intensity of the DMAB over time. Interestingly, the rate of formation of the 4-NTP as a result of the decomposition of DMAB was found to increase as the power of the exciting laser was increased from 2 to 4 mW. When the power of the exciting laser was increased to 10 mW, the intensity of the SERS bands of DMAB decreased over time at a relatively high rate while the intensity of the Raman band of the product, 4-NTP at 1340 cm−1, did not change. Finally, when the photochemical reaction was carried out at a laser power of 20 mW, the intensity of the SERS bands of both 4-NTP and DMAB were simultaneously decreased as the irradiation time increased. The results of the power-dependent photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB can be summarized as follows, (1) DMAB adsorbed onto AgNTs photocatalytically oxidized to 4-NTP after excitation with a 532 nm laser, (2) desorption of both the reactant 4-NTP and the product DMAB during the photocatalysis was observed at all laser excitation powers used and the desorption rate increased by increasing the power of the laser, and (3) it is suggested that 4-NTP is desorbed from the AgNT surface easier than DMAB because DMAB binds to AgNT through two thiol groups. A scheme depicting the oxidation of DMAB to 4-NTP on the surface of the AgNTs is shown in Fig. 4E.
During the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB to 4-NTP, the dimerization of 4-NTP back into DMAB is, in principle, possible. However, the rate of the photodimerization of 4-NTP is fast. But the molecules with right orientation are only able to dimerize. When the AgNTs are thermalized, the orientations of the 4-NTP molecules are disturbed, lowering the possibility of dimerization. This idea is supported by the SERS measurements, which showed that the oxidation of DMAB dominated over time, and the reverse dimerization reaction had little influence on the oxidation of DMAB.
To study the effect of laser irradiation of different powers on the AgNT arrays, the background under the SERS spectrum was examined over time. However, the background under the SERS spectrum results from the electronic Raman elastic scattering62 and/or the nanoparticles’ luminescence.63 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the as-measured time-dependent SERS spectra of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNT arrays measured at different illumination times with a 532 nm laser with different powers. The SERS background did not change as the irradiation time increased, which suggested that the AgNT did not change during the photocatalysis reaction.
The yield of gas phase photocatalysis reaction by plasmonic nanoparticles was increased by increasing the power of the exciting light.30–33 However, the gas phase photocatalysis reaction proceeds through four different steps, initiated by the collision of the reactants with the surface of the photocatalyst, followed by the adsorption of the gas reactants on the surface of the photocatalyst. Afterwards, the reactants photocatalyzed before desorbed from the surface of the catalyst. The photothermal effect of the plasmonic nanoparticles is likely to increase the number of collisions with the surface of the photocatalyst and subsequent enhancement of the rate of photoreaction, and increases the rate of gas desorption. Consequently, it is not easy to eliminate the effect of collision of the gas reactants with the surface of the photocatalyst, which is not effective in case of the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB on the surface of AgNT. This suggests that, the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB on the surface of AgNT is a simple and useful model reaction for examining the photothermal effect of the plasmonic nanoparticles on their catalytic efficiency.
Conclusions
Time-dependent SERS was used to study the effect of plasmonic photothermal heating by the AgNTs on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of DMAB. DMAB adsorbed on AgNT surface was oxidized to 4-NTP after excitation with a 532 nm laser. However, when the power of the exciting laser power was increased, the amount of photothermal heat generated by the AgNTs increased, leading to desorption of both the DMAB reactant and the 4-NTP product. Desorption of the reactants ultimately lowered the photocatalytic efficiency of the AgNTs.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  AFM image of AgNT 2-D arrays of edge length 80.7 ± 5.6 nm fabricated on the surface of the glass substrate by the overgrowth of AgHSs. (B) Higher-magnification AFM image of the image in (A). (C) Topographical cross sections along the center of a AgNT highlighted by the red circle.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) LSPR spectrum of 80.7 ± 5.6 nm AgND 2-D arrays measured on the surface of glass (black spectrum). The LSPR spectrum was deconvoluted into four different spectral peaks. (B) LSPR spectrum experimentally measured (black), theoretically simulated spectrum for 80 nm AgNT: extinction spectrum (red), absorption spectrum (blue), and scattering spectrum (cyan). The majority of the LSPR spectrum of AgNT is based on light absorption rather than light scattering.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) SERS spectrum of 4-NTP adsorbed on the surface of a AgNT monolayer assembly after illumination for 3 min by a 532 nm laser with powers 2, 4, 10, and 20 mW. (B) A depiction of the photodimerization of 4-NTP when excited with a 532 nm laser.	 

 	Fig. 4  Time-dependent SERS spectra of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNT arrays measured at different illumination times with a 532 nm laser with a power of (A) 2 mW, (B) 4 mW, (C) 10 mW, and (D) 20 mW. (E) A depiction of the photocatalytic oxidation of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNTs induced by the 532 nm laser. Both the 4-NTP and DMAB are possibly desorbed from the surface of AgNTs due to the photothermal heating effect.	 

 	Fig. 5  Relationship between the value of SERS band intensity of (A) the NN bond vibration band of DMAB at 1392 cm−1 and (B) the nitro group bond vibration band of 4-NTP with an irradiation time of DMAB adsorbed on the surface of AgNT 2-D arrays with a 532 nm laser of varying power.
