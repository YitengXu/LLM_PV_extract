    , Accepted 22nd February 2012First published on 24th February 2012AbstractIn this fundamental study, the supramolecular interactions between SWNTs and either symmetrical Zn(II) octa-tert-butylazulenocyanine 1 or a Zn(II) azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine 2 bearing a pyrene unit have been evaluated. The synthetic protocol allowed for the preparation of unsymmetrical azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine molecules, which incorporate reactive hydroxyl functional groups useful for the preparation of more elaborate derivatives, that is, the pyrene containing derivative 2 by an esterification reaction. To shed light onto the mutual interactions between 1 or 2 and SWNT, stable suspensions of SWNT in a mixture of 25% THF and 75% DMF were titrated with variable amounts of 1 or 2. These assays indicate a successful immobilization of azulenocyanine derivatives 1 or 2 onto SWNTs to yield the supramolecular hybrids SWNT/1 and SWNT/2. In this light, the physico-chemical properties of 1 and 2 as well as those of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 were investigated. From these we conclude strong interactions in the ground state, and a rapid charge separation in the excited state of SWNT/1 or SWNT/2. The accordingly formed radical ion pair states decay with lifetimes of 124 and 137 ps for SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, respectively. Finally, SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 were integrated into photoelectrochemical cells, revealing a response throughout the visible and near-infrared with a moderate IPCE maxima of 2.5%.
Introduction
Organic π-conjugated molecules are appealing components for fabricating photovoltaic devices owing to their synthetic versatility, light harvesting capabilities, and potential low cost of manufacturing.1 Although significant achievements have been made in “all-organic” bulk heterojunction2 and dye-sensitized solar cells,3 organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices—made of organic molecules in the active layer—have not yet reached practical power conversion efficiencies to compete with commercial silicon-based solar cells. There is still need for the design of new organic materials for improving device efficiencies. Some evidences suggest that the present limit to increase device efficiency is related to the light harvesting ability of the molecular components of the active layer. To be integrated into solar cell devices, in addition to general requirements such as chemical/thermal stability and good processability, ideal organic dyes should efficiently absorb light throughout a large portion of the solar spectrum, especially in the red and the near-infrared (NIR) regions. Importantly, the NIR features the majority of the sunlight intensity. Not many organic molecules fulfil, however, this requirement and the preparation of stable NIR dyes remains a great challenge.4 Phthalocyanines (Pcs)5 are among the few molecules that reveal an intense NIR absorption, which makes them inevitable “donor” participants in photovoltaics as justified by the number of publications in this field.6
In this context, so-called “push-pull” chromophores have recently reappeared as promising molecules in the development of highly efficient “all organic” and “hybrid” PV devices. It is particularly the efficient electronic communication between the donor and acceptor units through the π-conjugated bridge that determines the appearance of medium-intensity charge-transfer bands extending into the NIR region.
On the other hand, the outstanding electron acceptor features of C60 and its derivatives have been extensively utilized in the fabrication of solar cells, namely in a bulk heterojunction configuration, where they have been blended with semiconducting polymers, or in organic planar heterojunction solar cells together with Pcs. More innovative OPV devices that are currently under investigation are based on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as acceptor material, owing to their unique electrical conductivity (i.e., ballistic) and excellent mechanical properties (i.e., high tensile strength).7 Still, important issues such as improving the solubility and stability of the donor/SWNT hybrids need to be addressed in order to achieve competitive PV devices. It has been shown that non-covalent approaches8—rather than covalent functionalization methodologies—constitute an easy and efficient method leading to stable and processable donor/SWNT suspensions. Nevertheless, immobilizing π-conjugated donors onto the π-conjugated sidewalls of SWNTs by means of π-stacking and/or van der Waals interactions allows the preservation of the intrinsic electronic properties of SWNTs in the resulting hybrids. It has been shown that the interactions between Pcs and SWNTs are intrinsically weak, rendering it necessary to link, for example, pyrene to the Pc to efficiently adhere Pcs to the SWNT surface.9 Unfortunately, this necessity implies a more difficult preparation. Ideally, Pcs should be able to π-interact with the sidewalls of SWNTs by themselves.10
Azulene is a 10-π-electron nonbenzenoid, aromatic compound with unique properties such as remarkable polarizability. The latter is rationalized by polar resonance structures, in which a fused tropylium cation and a cyclopentadienyl anion are formed. Therefore, in contrast to the structurally isomeric and isoelectronic non-polar naphthalene, azulenes feature large dipole moments and, in turn, absorb light in the visible range, from which its remarkable blue color evolves.11
Very recently, a new tetrapyrrole derivative, namely azulenocyanine, formed by four di-tert-butylazulene units fused at the 5- and 6-positions to a tetraazaporphyrin, was prepared by Muranaka et al.12 The metal free tetra-tert-butylazulenocyanine, which is prepared as a mixture of four structural isomers, shows good solubility in organic solvents and very intense/broad absorptions. In fact, azulenocyanines absorb in the UV, visible, and NIR regions—from 300 to 1300 nm—and, as such, bear great potential for efficient light harvesting in photovoltaic applications. The origin of these spectral features correlates well with frontier molecular orbital analyses. These indicate that the small HOMO–LUMO gap (i.e., 1.5 eV), and therefore the intense NIR absorption of azulenocyanine, evolves from a stabilization of the LUMO orbital rather than a HOMO destabilization, compared with Pc HOMO–LUMO transitions/energies. Thus, the observation of absorption bands between Q and Soret bands from 720 to 1050 nm is considered to result from a charge transfer between the fused azulene rings and the 18 electron-π-conjugated aromatic porphyrazine core.13 Notably, an azulene fused phthalocyanine—bearing one azulene and three phthalonitrile building blocks—has also recently been reported.14
In addition to 1, we report on the preparation of new stable NIR absorbing azulenocyanine-phthalocyanines such as the pyrene conjugate 2 (see Chart 1). The azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine 2 described here, includes three azulene and one phthalonitrile group, allowing a strong red shift of the Q band into the NIR region of the spectrum. We also report on the formation of stable SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 hybrids as well as on the photophysical studies that shed light onto the processes taking place between the photoactive components in these supramolecular hybrids. The latter is the basis for exploring the integration of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 hybrids into prototype photoelectrochemical solar cells.

Results and discussion
Synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic approaches en route towards symmetrical azulenocyanine 1 and the unsymmetrically substituted azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine 2. According to the classical methodology typically used to prepare unsymmetrically substituted Pcs, which implies the cross-condensation of two differently substituted phthalonitrile precursors, a 4:1 molar mixture of 1,3-di-tert-butyl-5,6-dicyanoazulene12 and 4-hydroxymethylphthalonitrile15 were reacted under reflux of N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) in the presence of Zn(OAc)2. A dark solid, constituted by a mixture of compounds, was obtained from which the symmetrical Zn(II) azulenocyanine 1 was isolated by column chromatography on silica gel in 34% yield as a first eluting black-colored fraction. The unsymmetrically substituted hydroxymethyl derivative 3 was isolated in 22% yield after evaporating the second black-colored fraction. Azulenocyanine-pyrene 2 was obtained by an esterification reaction of azulenocyanine 3 with 1-pyrenebutyric acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) in 58% yield after purification by column chromatography. Azulenocyanines 1, 2, and 3 were obtained as mixtures of structural isomers, which could not be separated by conventional column chromatography.

All compounds were reasonably soluble in organic solvents and fully characterized by MALDI-MS, 1H-NMR, UV-Vis, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of 1, 2, and 3 are poorly resolved due to aggregation even in coordinating solvents such as d8-THF or 1,4-dioxane-d8 or upon increasing the temperature to 353 K, as previously reported for the Cs isomer of the metal free azulenecyanine.121H NMR spectra of 2 and 3 gave multiplets in ratios of 3:8:4 between 11.4 and 7.8 ppm for three sets of azulenocyanine ring protons, integrating for a total of 15 protons. In addition, 2 showed a multiplet at 8.4–7.8 ppm for 9 pyrene protons and a broad signal at 5.5 ppm corresponding to CH2O protons—see ESI†. Further proofs of the structures of all compounds were provided by mass spectral analysis.
Photophysics

1 and 2 have been characterized in solvent mixtures of 25% THF and 75% DMF, which guarantee the formation of stable SWNT suspensions—vide infra. Fundamental studies of the ground and excited state properties of azulenocyanines have already been published12–14 and thus, in the following, the spectroscopic features of azulenocyanine 1 and azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine 2 are compared. The absorption spectrum of 1 in the solvent mixture shows panchromic absorptions from 270 to 1150 nm with maxima at 303, 403, 575, and 1020 nm as well as a shoulder at 940 nm—see Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum of 2 is slightly different. On one hand, the absorption features of pyrene are discernable in the form of maxima at 277, 327, and 344 nm. On the other hand, the absorption bands of the aromatic macrocycle shift and change in relative ratio when compared to that of 1, due to the formal replacement of one of the fused azulene units by a benzene ring. Nevertheless, the absorption of 2 is also panchromatic and reaches from 270 to 1130 nm with maxima at 302, 389, 569, 890, and 1005 nm and a shoulder at 610 nm. Interesting is the shoulder at 610 nm, which is not seen in 1, and the band at 890 nm, which resembles the shoulder seen in the spectrum of 1 at 940 nm, that dominates the NIR. 1 shows maximum molar extinction coefficients of up to 96.000 L mol−1 cm−1 (i.e., 303 nm) and 58000 L mol−1 cm−1 (i.e., 1019 nm), while 2 features values as high as 86.000 L mol−1 cm−1 (i.e., 302 nm) and 45000 L mol−1 cm−1 (i.e., 890 nm).

In the fluorescence spectrum of 1, for example, upon excitation a 910 nm, a 1050 nm fluorescence band is seen that is followed by a weaker fluorescing band at 1250 nm—see Fig. 2. For 1 and 2, the fluorescence quantum yields are rather low (i.e., ≪10−4). Reasonably resolved spectra required an integration time of 120 s, which rendered it, however, impossible to determine the exact fluorescence quantum yields as well as the exact fluorescence lifetimes. The latter is, however, significantly shorter than the instrumental limits of our TCSPC set up. The fluorescence spectrum of 2 is very similar to that of 1, with emission maxima at 1030 and 1245 nm when excited, for instance, at 910 nm excitation.

After the spectroscopic characterization of 1 and 2, we studied their redox behavior with particular focus on their oxidations. These studies were carried out in deoxygenated dichloromethane containing 0.2 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte with a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and an Ag wire as quasi reference electrode. Ferrocene has been used as an internal reference. Firstly, square wave voltammetric measurements were performed that led to oxidation potentials of +0.20, +0.50, and +1.01 V for 1, while the oxidation potentials of 2 are registered at +0.24, +0.57, and +1.11 V. Cyclic voltammetric measurements corroborate these values and show that the first and second oxidations of 1 and 2 are reversible, while the third oxidation is irreversible for 1 and 2. These findings allowed us to perform spectroelectrochemistry. Here, a Pt gauze was used as working electrode. For 1, the spectra were recorded under oxidative conditions, that is, 15 min of an applied potential of +0.2 V, while for 2 a potential of +0.3 V was applied. 1 and 2 showed distinct changes of their absorption features during the oxidations.
The differential absorption changes were determined by subtracting the initial spectra (i.e., without an applied potential) from the final spectra (i.e., with 15 min of an applied potential)—see Fig. 3. In this regard, the differential absorption spectrum of 1 reveals minima, which are imprints of the ground state bleaching, at 305, 402, 581, 941, and 1031 nm. New absorption bands, representing the absorption of the one electron oxidized form of 1 develop at 345, 461, 520 (shoulder), 647, and 1140 nm. Very similar is the differential absorption spectrum monitored for 2 with minima at 384, 556, 621, 873, and a shoulder at 1020 nm. Here, the newly developed maxima are located at 336, 460, 592, 660, and 1118 nm. These features serve as important fingerprints for the identification of radical ion pair states when combining 1 and 2 with SWNT as electron acceptors.

The differential absorption spectrum (grey spectrum) illustrates the changes in absorption—calculated by subtracting the initial spectra from the spectra recorded after applying the aforementioned potential. 
To investigate the interactions of 1 and 2 with SWNTs, titration experiments were carried out. Towards this end, we used SWNTs suspended in mixtures of 25% THF and 75% DMF, in which SWNTs are readily dispersed affording stable suspensions.9a,e The preparation procedure to obtain these SWNT suspensions includes the following steps—0.2 mg of SWNT were added to about 8 mL of the solvent mixture, sonicated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10 krpm for 15 min for purification. The resulting grayish SWNT suspensions were titrated with increasing amounts (i.e., up to ∼10−6 mol L−1 in the last step) of 1 and 2 in 25% THF and 75% DMF. In Fig. 4 the absorption spectra are surveyed and compared with the spectrum of just 1 in the absence of SWNTs. We also calculated the differential absorption spectra to visualize the absorption shifts—see Fig. S10, ESI†. Clearly visible is an overall broadening of the absorption features of 1. In addition, a red shift is seen. For example, next to the band at 403 nm a shoulder forms at around 420 nm and next to the band at 575 nm a shoulder forms at 610 nm. The largest changes evolve, however, around the band at 1020 nm. The latter shows a bathochromic shift of around 45 nm. When comparing these results with those seen for phthalocyanines, a strong resemblance is concluded. Also for SWNT/Pc hybrids a broadening and a red shift of the Pc's absorption bands were noted.9 Another similarity is the red shift that is associated with the SWNT absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectrum.
 Fig. 4  Titration of SWNTs suspended in 25% THF/75% DMF with increasing amounts of 1. Black: absorption spectrum of 1 (10−6 M). Gray: absorption spectrum of suspended SWNTs. From brown to purple: absorption spectra reflecting the titrations of SWNTs with 1 (up to 10−6 M of 1). 
Here, the SWNT absorption bands shift, for example, from 1312 to 1320 nm.16 In summary, the red shifted absorption bands of 1 as well as those of SWNTs indicate the successful immobilization of 1 onto SWNTs and their mutual interactions. The results for SWNT/2 are quite similar. In particular, the absorption bands of 2 are broadened and red shifted. Likewise, the SWNT absorptions in the infrared region undergo a red shift. Taking the aforementioned into consideration we reach the conclusion that also 2 immobilizes onto the surface of SWNTs. To gain deeper insights into the interactions, we performed fluorescence experiments, where solutions of 1 or 2 were titrated with SWNTs. After taking the initial fluorescence spectra of 1 and 2, 200 μL of a suspension of 0.2 mg SWNT in 2 mL solvent were added, followed by 15 min of ultrasonication. The fact that 1 and 2 are stable under ultrasonication is important. The results of these titration experiments are shown in Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†. Again, the samples were excited at 910 nm to monitor the fluorescence of 1 and 2. The fluorescence band of 1 at 1050 nm is quenched after the second addition step of SWNT. Please note the appearance of distinct SWNT band gap fluorescence. The results for 2 are similar and include a quenched fluorescence band at 1030 nm upon addition of SWNTs. This quenching serves as further evidence for the successful immobilization of 1 and 2 onto the surface of SWNTs.
For further investigations and the implementation of the functionalized SWNT into photoelectrochemical devices, the fabrication of more concentrated SWNT suspensions was required. To this end, we used our recently published procedure for preparing stable SWNT suspensions in the solvent mixture of 25% THF and 75% DMF.9a,e Firstly, a solution of 8 mL solvent including a small amount of 1 or 2 was prepared (∼ 10−6 mol L−1). Secondly, we added 0.2 mg SWNT and sonicated the solution for 15 min. Finally, excess of SWNTs and possible impurities were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10 krpm. The resulting suspensions were stable and absorption spectra verified the presence of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2. These concentrated SWNT suspensions enabled us to study the SWNT's NIR fluorescence and perform transient absorption measurements—vide infra.
In terms of SWNT fluorescence, the fluorescence spectra of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 were compared with that of SWNT/sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in D2O. The preparation of the SWNT/SDBS reference suspensions was similar to the aforementioned procedure with the exception that we employed D2O containing 2 wt % of SDBS. It is well known that in SWNT/SDBS, SWNT are well debundled and, in turn, exhibit strong fluorescence.17 All investigated samples exhibit SWNT ground state absorptions that are similar throughout the excitation area, that is, between 550 and 800 nm. 3-D fluorescence landscapes—Fig. 5—were generated for SWNT/SDBS, SWNT/1, and SWNT/2. SWNT/SDBS, for example, exhibits the strongest fluorescence maxima from SWNT that are ascribed to (9,4), (7,6), (8,6), (11,3), (9,5), (10,5), (8,7), and (9,7), (n,m) are isomeric chiral SWNT. At first glance, the fluorescence of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 is strongly quenched when compared to SWNT/SDBS. Importantly, we consider this as sound proof for mutually interacting SWNT, on one hand, and 1 or 2, on the other hand. A closer look reveals, however, subtle differences in the fluorescent features of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2—Fig. S13, ESI†.
 Fig. 5  Upper part—3D steady-state fluorescence spectra—with increasing intensity from blue to green to yellow and to red—of SWNT/SDBS in D2O. Central part—3D steady-state fluorescence spectra—with increasing intensity from blue to green to yellow and to red–of SWNT/1 in 25% THF/75% DMF. Lower part—3D steady-state fluorescence spectra—with increasing intensity from blue to green to yellow and to red—of SWNT/2 in 25% THF/75% DMF. Please note the different amplifications. 
In particular, the fluorescence bands of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 are red shifted compared to SWNT/SDBS. In addition, the fluorescence intensities of SWNT/1 (i.e., 1130, 1220, and 1310 nm) are notably weaker than those of SWNT/2. The only exception is the fluorescence maximum at 1440 nm, which turns out to be stronger in the case of SWNT/1. This behavior prompts unambiguously stronger interactions in SWNT/1.
Next, femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed with 1 and 2 in the mixture of 25% THF and 75% DMF using 387 nm excitation pulses—Fig. 6. Ground-state bleach is observed across the 475 to 600 nm and 980 to 1025 nm ranges with local minima at 565 and 1000 nm. In addition, we note transient maxima at 445 and 1085 nm, which are attributed to the singlet excited state features of 1. For 2, the singlet excited state features are shifted to the blue—a finding that is consistent with the shifted ground state features. These singlet excited features convert via a very rapid intersystem crossing (i.e., 4.1 ± 0.2 ps) to the energetically lower lying triplet excited features. The corresponding triplet excited state characteristics resemble those of the singlet excited state with the exception of an overall band narrowing and a blue shift (i.e., from 1085 to 1075 nm). The latter reinstate with 12.0 ± 0.2 ps the singlet ground state.
 Fig. 6  Upper part—differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond pump–probe experiments (387 nm) of 1 in 25% THF/75% DMF with different time delays between 1.3 and 12.9 ps at room temperature. Lower part—time absorption profiles at 1000 and 1080 nm monitoring the excited state decay. 
We started our SWNT investigations with SWNT/SDBS upon 387 nm photoexcitation—not shown. The baseline is in the case of SWNT/SDBS replaced with strong bleaching that dominates the differential absorption spectra throughout the visible and near-infrared regions, where absorptive transitions of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs appear, respectively. The major minima are seen at 975, 1020, 1135, and 1260 nm. Multiwavelength analyses of the bleaching characteristics in the near-infrared resulted in two lifetimes—1.2 and 520 ps. Throughout these biexponential decays the original absorption/baseline is quantitatively reinstated.
Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy with SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 in the solvent mixture was employed to substantiate the ultrafast singlet excited state deactivations and, in addition, to characterize the nature of the photoproducts.
The singlet excited characteristics of 1 and 2—despite the presence of SWNT—were registered upon 387 nm photoexcitation of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2—see Fig. 7 and 8. This confirms the successful excitation of 1 or 2. Simultaneously with the singlet excited state decay of either 1 or 2 (i.e., 20 ps), the formation of a new transient species evolves with distinct minima at 550, 950, and 1050 nm as well as maxima at 630 and 1140 nm. Of key importance is the resemblance of these attributes with those of the one-electron oxidized radical cations of either 1 or 2, as they were determined in the aforementioned spectroelectrochemistry measurements.
 Fig. 7  Upper part—differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond pump–probe experiments (387 nm) of SWNT/1 in 25% THF/75% DMF with different time delays between 0.1 and 20 ps at room temperature.

Lower part—time absorption profile at 1080 nm monitoring the charge separation and charge recombination. 
 Fig. 8  Upper part—differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond pump–probe experiments (387 nm) of SWNT/2 in 25% THF/75% DMF with different time delays between 1.3 and 13.0 ps at room temperature. Lower part—time absorption profile at 1080 nm monitoring the charge separation and charge recombination. 
Similarly, the range beyond 1000 nm (i.e., 1000–1600 nm) is important, which immediately after the photoexcitation is dominated by a negative imprint of the SWNT centered van Hove singularities (i.e., 1040, 1155, and 1270 nm). Here, appreciable blue shifts were noted during the transient decay with minima that shift from 1040, 1155, and 1270 nm to 1030, 1120, and 1260 nm, respectively. Implicit are new conduction band electrons—injected from photoexcited 1 or 2—shifting the transitions to higher energies.9 Thus, we reach the conclusion that photoexcitation of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 is followed by a rapid charge transfer. A multi-wavelength analysis of the newly developed charge transfer state reveals its metastable character with decays of 124 and 137 ps for SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, respectively. We would like to point out that a transduction of excited state energy from photoexcited 1 or 2 to SWNT cannot be ruled out.
Photoelectrochemical devices
To test the applicability of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2 in solar cells, electrochemical test cells were constructed. Following a well-known procedure, ITO slides were pretreated—see experimental section. To fabricate photoactive SWNT/azulenocyanine layers on top of the conductive glass, different amounts of SWNT/1 or SWNT/2 containing suspensions (in a solvent mixture of 25% THF/75% DMF) were filtrated onto a 200 μm pore sized PTFE filter, retaining all the functionalized tubes, at the same time removing all excess amount of 1 and 2. Consecutively, the filtrate residue was hot stamped on top of the pretreated ITO at 130 °C under pressure. The resulting slides were covered with a homogenous smooth black film, with average thickness of 300–500 nm depending on amount and concentration of the suspensions. All attempts at spin-coating the material onto ITO were futile, due to the restriction in choice of solvents.
After optical inspection for irregularities they were characterized in terms of absorption (i.e., 560 nm—Fig. S14†) to ensure comparable thickness. In a next step an active layer was defined by removing the SWNT/1 or SWNT/2 films leaving an effective circle of 6 mm diameter.
The devices were investigated by measuring the white light response under AM 1.5 conditions as well as the wavelength dependent IPCE—see experimental section for details. Using optimal absorption, the photoresponse is 25.7 and 19.7 μA cm−2 for SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, respectively—see Fig. 9. The IPCE spectra resemble the broad and featureless absorption spectra of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, that is, a gradual increase in efficiency from the NIR to the visible region with a maximum IPCE of nearly 2.5 percent around 400 nm—see Fig. 10—without revealing distinct features. In line with the photophysical characterization, overall higher values were registered for SWNT/1 than for SWNT/2.

A possible rationale for the better performance is a better interface between SWNT and 1 when compared with that between SWNT and 2.
Conclusions
Interfacing Zn(II) octa-tert-butylazulenocyanine 1 and Zn(II) azulenocyanine-phthalocyanine 2 with SWNTs resulted in suspendable, room temperature stable, and photoactive electron donor acceptor hybrids SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, respectively. The latter were integrated into photoelectrochemical cells. The suspendability and stability of SWNT/1 and SWNT/2, on one hand, was corroborated through spectroscopic and microscopic assays performed at room temperature. On the other hand, a full-fledged photophysical investigation that includes steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements and that were complemented by pump–probe measurements on the femtosecond time scale shed light onto the photoreactivity, namely ultrafast charge separation and hundreds of femtosecond lasting charge recombination. All of the aforementioned turned out to be useful for the construction of prototype photoelectrochemical cells with maximum IPCEs of 2.5%.
Experimental
Synthesis and characterization
1,3-Di-tert-butyl-5,6-dicyanoazulene12 and 4-hydroxymethyl-phthalonitrile15 were synthesized according to literature methods.
Synthesis of Zn(II)azulenocyanines 1 and 3
A mixture of 1,3-di-tert-butyl-5,6-dicyanoazulene (100 mg, 0.34 mmol), 4-hydroxymethylphthalonitrile (13.6 mg, 0.086 mmol) and Zn(OAc)2 (25.3 mg, 0.13 mmol) in DMAE (6 mL) was heated at reflux for 24 h with stirring under argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexanes/dioxane, 4:1). The symmetric Zn(II)azulenocyanine 1 was eluted first, obtaining 35 mg (34% yield), followed by Zn(II)azulenocyanine 3 (20 mg 22% yield).

Synthesis of Zn(II)azulenocyanine 2
A mixture of 1-pyrenebutyric acid (26.3 mg, 0.091 mmol), DMAP (11.1 mg, 0.091 mmol) and DCC (18.7 mg, 0.091 mmol) in THF (3 ml) was cooled to 0 °C under argon atmosphere. A solution of Zn(II)azulenocyanine 3 (100 mg, 0.091 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was then added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h and then warmed up to room temperature. Stirring was continued for 24 h. The solvent was removed, and the residue was washed with MeOH. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with hexanes-dioxane (4:1).
Zn(II)azulenocyanine 2 was obtained as a black-greyish solid (72 mg, 58%). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, THF-d8): δ (ppm) = 11.3–10.7 (m, 3H, ArH), 9.5–8.9 (m, 8H, ArH), 8.4–7.7 (m, 13H, ArH), 5.6–5.2 (m, 2H), 3.7–3.5 (m, 2H), 2.9–2.6 (m, 4H), 2.1–1.7 (m, 54H, alkylH).

Photophysical and electrochemical measurements
THF was of spectrophotometric grade (99.5%), DMF was of ACS spectrophotometric grade (99.8%), dichloromethane was CHROMASOLV® Plus (99.9%) and all were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. SWNTs (HiPCO Batch Nr.: R0510C) were purchased from CNI.
The experiments were performed at room temperature and ambient conditions. Steady-state absorption spectra were measured by a Cary5000 (Varian) two beam spectrometer. NIR emission spectra were measured by a Fluorolog spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). Here, the optical detection was performed by a Symphony InGaAs array in combination with an iHR320 imaging spectrometer. The samples were excited by a 450 W Xenon lamp or the SHG (532 nm) of a Nd/YAG laser. Femtosecond transient absorption studies were performed using 387 nm laser pulses with a 150 fs pulse width (1 kHz, 200 nJ), from an amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (SHG, CPA 2001, Clark-MXR Inc.). For the detection we used a Helios TAPPS from Ultrafast Inc.
Electrochemical measurements were carried out by using a HEKA elektronik HEKA 510 potentiostat/galvanostat with a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and Ag wire reference electrode. Potentials were measured vs. Fc/Fc+ in deoxygenated samples. Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed on a Varian Cary5000 absorption spectrometer with a custom made cell including a Pt mesh working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and a Ag wire reference electrode. The filter for the transfer process was a PTFE membrane filter, Millipore, 200 nm pore size.
The ITO covered glass slides were pretreated by subsequent ultrasonication in water/detergent mixture following acetone and finally isopropanol. A Surlyn® ionomer with 50 μm thickness connects the covered ITO with a Pt(Cl)6 treated FTO counter electrode and simultaneously seals the device. To finalize the test cells, the gaps between the electrodes were filled with an I2 based electrolyte through a hole in the counter electrode (i.e., 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide; 0.03 M I2; 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate; 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile:valeronitrile 85:15). The light source for the solar simulator was a LOT-Oriel Xenon lamp (350–1000 Watt). AM 1.5 conditions are achieved using the appropriate filter and a Newport 1919-C optical power meter. Monochromatic light was obtained via a B&M Spectronic monochromator (600 grooves nm−1 grating, 10 nm bandwidth). All currents were measured and applied by a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter.
