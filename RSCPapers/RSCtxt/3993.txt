    , Accepted 10th August 2017First published on 10th August 2017AbstractSolution processed perovskite semiconductors have developed rapidly over the past decade to yield excellent performance in both solar cell and light emitting diode devices. Both of these device types are prepared using similar materials and architectures, raising the possibility of perovskite based light emitting solar cells. Recent reports have indicated that some low band gap perovskite solar cells are able to emit infrared light efficiently, however, intermediate band gap perovskite solar cells which emit visible light have not, to the best of our knowledge been deliberately designed or extensively characterized. In this work, we have investigated the use of different electron transport layers in order to minimize energetic barriers to electron injection and extraction in methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) films. We demonstrate that through appropriate band structure engineering, MAPbBr3 can be used to make such “peroptronic” light-emitting solar cells, which simultaneously exhibit efficient solar cell power conversion efficiencies over 1% and 0.43 lm W−1 green light emission.

Broader context
Solar cells convert light into electricity, while light-emitting diodes (LEDs) convert electricity into light. These two types of devices share similar designs, but, with few exceptions, cannot efficiently perform both functions. The similar architectures shared between some recently developed perovskite-based solar cells and LEDs raises the question of whether these materials can be used to make single devices that can reversibly transduce energy between light and electricity, or function as light-emitting solar cells. The properties of perovskite materials make them ideally suited to realize this type of “peroptronic” transducer. Recent investigations have demonstrated that perovskite solar cells can efficiently emit infrared radiation, however, visible light emission from perovskite solar cells until now remains a largely unexplored possibility.

In a short period of time, methyl ammonium (MA) lead halide perovskite semiconductors have proven themselves as incredibly effective solar cell (SC) materials1–4 as their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have surpassed every other emerging solar technology and matched the performance of well-established technologies like polycrystalline silicon, CdTe and Cu(InGa)Se2 devices.5 Concurrently, interest in perovskite-based light emitting diodes (LEDs) has grown in recent months6–8 and the performance of perovskite LEDs has also progressed rapidly. Given the similar architectures of perovskite LED and SCs, one interesting possibility is perovskite light emitting solar cells (LESCs), or devices which reversibly transduce optical energy into electrical energy or electrical energy into optical energy.
Although perovskite SCs and LEDs share similarities, they perform fundamentally different functions; the electronic band structures of SCs are designed to make it energetically favorable for electrons and holes to separate and migrate out of the active perovskite layer and towards the electrodes,9,10 whereas LEDs are designed to make it energetically favorable for electrons and holes to migrate towards the active perovskite layer where they combine to emit light. An LESC must be able to perform both functions and act as a reversible opto-electronic transducer; that is absorb light in an active layer and extract photo-generated electron–hole pairs under illumination to generate power, while also being able to inject electron–hole pairs and promote radiative charge recombination in the same active layer when connected to an external power supply. These concepts are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a.

The low exciton binding energies and high charge carrier mobilities of perovskite materials allow them to convert electron–hole pairs into photons and vice versa with minimal energy loss, while at the same time efficiently transporting electrical charges into or out of the active layer. The solution-processability and ability to tune bandgaps throughout the visible spectrum makes perovskite materials uniquely suited for this application and we will refer to this type of perovskite based LESC as a “peroptronic” device.
Recent reports have demonstrated that perovskite solar cells based on CsPbI3 or mixed MA/formamidinium lead halides are able to exhibit excellent solar cell performance as well as efficient light emission at near-infrared wavelengths.11,12 For instance, Bi et al. reported electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 0.5% for infrared LESCs with a band gap of 1.6 eV and photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.9%, but did not report detailed LED characteristics.11 Swarnkar et al. reported CsPbI3 quantum dot LESCs with PCE of 10.8% and electroluminescence near 700 nm, but also did not include detailed LED characteristics.12 Despite these interesting results with infrared emitting solar cells, peroptronic devices which emit light in the visible region and function efficiently as solar cells, to the best of our knowledge, have not yet been reported.
While it is academically interesting to pursue perovskite devices which are able to reversibly convert energy between light and electrical potential, such devices are interesting from practical points of view as well. For instance, solar lamps, which use SCs to harvest solar energy during the day and LEDs to emit light at night have found wide use in consumer and public lighting applications and are envisioned as replacements for oil lamps in developing countries which lack electrical infrastructure, if they can be produced inexpensively.13 Integrating an LESC with a rechargeable battery would allow it to function as a solar lamp with reduced the complexity and cost compared to existing solar lamps. Additionally, LESCs have the potential to greatly improve performance in applications which rely on the weak photovoltaic effect of LEDs, such as fiber optic communications and atmospheric sensors.14,15
To design an efficient peroptronic device, we chose MAPbBr3 as an active layer material, as it possesses an appropriate band gap (Eg, 2.18 eV) for this application. MAPbBr3 absorbs light strongly below 540 nm, which allows it to generate significant photocurrent16,17 and exhibits fluorescence in the middle of the visible spectrum (at ∼520–560 nm), which is desirable for LED devices.18
In general, perovskite SCs tend to exhibit optimal performance when the crystal grain size of the active layer is large, whereas perovskite LEDs tend to perform better with smaller grain sizes and smoother films.19 Thus, the active layer morphology of peroptronic devices must be designed to allow charge separation and charge recombination to both occur with minimal losses. We observed that small grain sizes inevitably led to poor SC performance, whereas intermediate to large grain sizes (greater than ∼100 nm) could produce reasonably good LED performance with the use of suitable buffer layers. Two processing approaches were found to yield MAPbBr3 films with suitable morphologies including a single step20 and two-step21 approach. A one-step, solvent-engineering method involved spin-coating an MAPbBr3 film from a dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide solvent mixture, followed by dropping a non-solvent (chlorobenzene) on the drying film while as it was still spinning. Additionally, a two-step, layer-by-layer method was employed. In the two-step method, a PbBr2 film was first spin-cast from a solution in DMF, followed by conversion to MAPbBr3 by spin-coating a solution of MABr in isopropanol (IPA). A schematic illustration of the device fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1b and detailed film processing procedures are described in the experimental section.
Both techniques yielded functioning LESC devices, however, we observed superior performance in the one-step processed films and we will focus on data for this method. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a MAPbBr3 films processed by the one-step method is shown in Fig. 2a. Characteristics of MAPbBr3 films processed by the two-step method are included in the supporting information (Fig. S1, ESI†). The films exhibit average grain sizes of about 250 nm and 330 nm, for one-step and two-step processing, respectively. The one-step method yields grains which are somewhat smaller, but more closely packed than the two-step method, while the two-step method showed larger cracks between crystal grains. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the one-step method films (Fig. 2b) exhibit peaks at 14.48°, 29.69°, and 45.51° that can be assigned to (100), (200), (300) diffraction planes of the Pm3m cubic structure of MAPbBr3, as well as weaker peaks corresponding to (110), (210), (211) and (220) planes.22 There are no differences in the position of XRD peaks for the two processing methods, however, with the two-step method, we observed very strong diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100), (200), (300) planes. The higher intensity, narrower peak width, and predominance of (100), (200), (300) peaks observed in the two-step method film can be attributed to larger grain size23 and anisotropic growth of the (100) crystal plane relative to the substrate.
 Fig. 2  Material properties. (a) SEM image of solution-processed MAPbBr3 film. (b) X-ray diffractogram of MAPbBr3 layer. (c) Absorption and photoluminescence of MAPbBr3 layer. 
The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of one-step MAPbBr3 films are shown in Fig. 2c. Films processed by one-step and two-step procedures exhibit local absorption maxima 524 and 526 nm, respectively, with fluorescence maxima at 543 and 537 nm, respectively. The Stoke's shift and FWHM of the two-step film (11 nm and 20 nm, respectively) are noticeably smaller than the one-step film (19 nm and 29 nm, respectively). The Stoke's shift and FWHM for one-step films are typical for previously reported MAPbBr3 films,24 however, the two-step film shows a small shift and narrower emission linewidth than usual. The linewidth of emission from MAPbBr3 films has been correlated to Frölich coupling between charge carriers and longitudinal optical phonons.25 It is unlikely that the differences in crystal growth during one-step and two-step processing methods would affect the Frölich coupling constant, therefore, we speculate that differences in the film thickness or dielectric properties may have caused small variations in the emission spectra via optical cavity effects.26 In any case, both processing methods yielded MAPbBr3 films with satisfactory material properties and were used in peroptronic devices.
Successful perovskite based SCs and LEDs both utilize sandwich architectures in which perovskite active layers are nested between charge-selective carrier-transport layers. Of critical importance in the design of LESC devices is choosing carrier transport layers which do not impose significant energy barriers to either the injection of charge carriers or the extraction of charge carriers. Furthermore, the carrier transport layers must possess a high conductivity, to minimize the series resistance in SC operation, while at the same time efficiently blocking carriers of the opposite polarity, in order to ensure that charge carriers are trapped, and forced to radiatively recombine within the perovskite layer under forward bias. Selecting appropriate charge carrier transport layers which fulfill these functions was the most critical design criterion to realizing effective peroptronic devices.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been demonstrated as a hole transporting layer (HTL) which effectively forms Ohmic, p-type contacts in both LED and SC devices while blocking electron back-diffusion, thus we employed PEDOT:PSS coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates as the anodes in our devices. Choosing an appropriate electron transporting layer (ETL) was somewhat more challenging. In LED devices, low conductivity ETLs such as 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBI),27 poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)28 and spirobifluorene29 tend to be favored. These materials possess high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy bands, which trap electrons within the active layer, forcing carrier recombination and consequently luminescence from within the active layer. In the context of SCs however, such high-lying LUMO energy bands are undesirable as they create an energetic barrier (Φext) to the extraction of electrons. In contrast, SCs tend to favor high conductivity ETLs which allow electrons to be rapidly extracted from the active layer, however may introduce an energetic barrier to electron injection (Φinj) from the ETL into the conduction band (CB) of the active layer, and lead to non-radiative recombination in LED devices. Additionally, some popular n-type acceptor materials such as fullerenes or perylenetetracarboxylic acid derivatives which work well in SCs are known to quench electroluminescence in LED devices.30 In this study, we chose to focus on ETLs including ZnO, a wide Eg inorganic semiconductor with high electron mobility, which has been effectively used in both LEDs28 and SCs31 as well as polyethyleneimine (PEI), which has been shown to be an outstanding n-doping/interfacial dipole material in both LEDs and SCs.32
One additional ETL that we found to work exceptionally well, as will be described later, was a polyelectrolyte based on a partially protonated PEI backbone with tetraimadazolylborate anions (PEIBIm4). We designed this ETL with inspiration from conventional perovskite SCs which employ ionically doped HTLs33 and considered that an ionically doped ETL might function well with a perovskite active layer. We also drew from past experience in organic electronics, in which it has been observed repeatedly that conjugated polyelectrolytes and oligoelectrolytes which incorporate the BIm4 anion give rise to large interfacial dipoles34 and outstanding LED, SC and FET performance.35,36 PEIBIm4 was synthesized by preparing the conjugate acid of the BIm4 anion37 and neutralizing it with a basic solution of PEI in IPA. This scheme yielded a polyelectrolyte in which approximately one out of every 6 ethylenimine repeat units was protonated and charge-compensated by a BIm4 anion. Notably, IPA is known as a solvent which is compatible with perovskite films21 and we observed that IPA solutions of PEIBIm4 could be spin-cast on top of perovskite films without adversely affecting the underlying MAPbBr3 layer.
In order to understand the energy band structure of our devices, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) experiments were carried out (Fig. S3, ESI†). The valence band (VB) energies (EVB) of inorganic materials or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) band energies (EHOMO) of organic materials were derived from the Fermi edge of each material relative to a gold reference. Work functions (φ) were derived from the secondary edge (ESE) via the equation φ = hν − ESE, where hν is the energy of the UV light source (21.2 eV). Conduction band (CB) energies (ECB) of inorganic materials or LUMO band energies (ELUMO) of organic materials were derived from the EVB or EHOMO energies, respectively, by subtracting their Egs taken from UV-vis absorption data. These values are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) and were used to construct energy band diagrams (Fig. 3).

Devices using a ZnO ETL have an offset between the ECB of the MAPbBr3 and the ECB of ZnO (Fig. 3a). After electrons are excited to the conduction band of MAPbBr3 by photon absorption, this offset makes electron transfer from the ECB of MAPbBr3 to ZnO energetically favorable, however, it also imposes an energy barrier (Φinj) of 0.71 eV to electron injection, which is expected to hinder LED operation. Devices using a TPBI ETL (Fig. 3b) have an opposite offset between the ECB of the MAPbBr3 and the LUMO of TPBI; this allows facile injection of electrons into the CB of MAPbBr3 under forward bias, but imposes an energetic barrier for extraction of electrons (Φext) of 0.55 eV from the CB of MAPbBr3 in SC operation.
PEI and PEIBIm4 films deposited on MAPbBr3 (Fig. 3c and d) both caused a strong shift in the secondary edge of their UPS spectra. In the context of inorganic semiconductors, this may be interpreted as a change in the work function (WF) or Fermi energy (EF) of the material that is conventionally described by bending of the VB and CB bands. In the context of organic semiconductors, this may be interpreted as a shift in the vacuum energy, or formation of an interfacial dipole. We have chosen to interpret this as a change in the EF and band bending, although either interpretation would be consistent with the observed experimental results. The WF of pristine MAPbBr3 was found to be 5.31 eV, and decreased to 4.86 eV after application of a PEI ETL, and decreased further to 4.64 eV after application of a PEIBIm4 ETL, indicating that both ETLs caused n-doping relative to the pristine film, with corresponding band offsets (Δ) of 0.45 eV with PEI or 0.67 eV with PEIBIm4.
Peroptronic devices were prepared with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr3/ETL/Ag, and characterized as both SCs and LEDs. The current voltage and electroluminescence characteristics for devices based on one-step processed active layers are summarized in Table 1 while the relevant data are plotted in Fig. 4. Although the two-step processed MAPbBr3 active layers appeared to have superior crystallinity, they showed slightly inferior performance, likely due to cracks in the active layer.

The data corresponding to these devices are included in ESI† (Fig. S4 and Table S2). Control devices were prepared using TPBI, which has previously been used effectively in perovskite LEDs as ETLs.27
As expected, these devices yielded reasonably good LED performance with a luminance of over 4000 cd m−2, current efficiency of 0.34 cd A−1 and luminous efficiency of 0.27 lm W−1. The SC performance, however, was rather poor (∼0.2%), presumably due the Φext caused by the high-lying TPBI LUMO band.
ZnO was employed as an ETL which led to good SC performance including a Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of 5.96 mA cm−2, 1.31 V, 0.65 and 5.02%, however, almost no electroluminescence was observed in this device. This behavior is consistent with the large barrier (Φinj = 0.71 eV) for electrons being injected into the conduction band of MAPbBr3. Thus, it is apparent that electrons accumulate at the MAPbBr3/ZnO interface and non-radiatively recombine with holes in the VB of MAPbBr3 under forward bias in this architecture.
We anticipated that PEI, which is known as an exceptionally effective ETL in a variety of devices, might function well in both LED and SC operation.
We found that the performance in LED operation was good (brightness of 6700 cd m−2, current efficiency of 0.56 cd A−1 and luminous efficiency of 0.44 lm W−1) while the SC PCE was modest (0.5%). In particular, a low JSC was produced by SCs incorporating only a PEI layer; considering the low current in these devices relative to other ETLs, it appears that the PEI layer caused an excessive increase in series resistance.
Although the SC performance of peroptronic devices employing PEIBIm4 as an ETL was somewhat less than ZnO, the LED performance was better than any other ETL explored in this study and led to a good balance between LED and SC performance. These devices exhibited SC performance including a Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of 3.1 mA cm−2, 1.05 V, 0.31 and 1.02%, with LED characteristics including a brightness of 8400 cd m−2, current efficiency of 0.57 cd A−1 and luminous efficiency of 0.43 lm W−1. The high performance observed in these devices can be attributed to a larger band-bending effect and higher conductivity for the ionically doped ETL compared to pristine PEI. For comparison, devices incorporating both ZnO and PEIBIm4 layers were investigated. These devices showed intermediate SC performance between ZnO and PEIBIm4 devices, with poor LED performance, indicating that the ZnO in the binary ETL still promoted non-radiative carrier recombination.
We have demonstrated, for the first time, peroptronic devices based on solution processed MAPbBr3 active layer which exhibit photovoltaic PCEs of over 1% and luminous efficiencies of over 0.4 lm W−1. It is apparent that PEI and its derivative PEIBIm4 are able to overcome the problem of simultaneously achieving efficient electron injection and extraction from perovskite active layers. We have interpreted the mechanism of these ETLs as causing an increase in the EF of the MAPbBr3 layer, or n-doping. Considering that no electron accepting material is present, this result implies that these ETLs result in the formation of a MAPbBr3 homojunction, which is consistent with the observation of LESC behavior in some high-quality inorganic semiconductor homojunctions such as GaAs.38 It is worth noting that a hole injection barrier exists between the PEDOT:PSS and MAPbBr3 layers; we anticipate that improved performance can be achieved if the hole injection/extraction issue in this architecture is investigated in greater detail as well.39,40 This type of device opens the possibility for an interesting new range of applications for perovskite semiconductors, such as low-cost optical communications elements or self-powered displays.
Experimental
Materials
Lead bromide (PbBr2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous isopropanol (IPA) and anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used without purification.
Methylammonium bromide (MABr) was prepared by mixing 30 mL CH3NH2 (40 wt% in water, Sigma Aldrich) and 30 mL Hydrobromic acid (48 wt% aqueous solution, Sigma Aldrich) in a 250 mL flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The solid was recovered by evaporation of the solvent under vacuum at 60 °C for 1 h. To purify, the MABr precursor was re-dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl either. Finally, the MABr product was dried at 60 °C under vacuum oven for 24 h.
PEIBIm4 was prepared as follows: the conjugate acid of BIm4 (HBIm4) was first prepared in an adaptation of a previously reported method.37 Briefly, 250 mg NaBIm4 was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water. 825 μL of 1 M HCl was added to this solution via micropipette and the mixture was shaken. A fine white material (HBIm4) precipitated which was collected by centrifuging. The solid was washed three times with 5 mL water, twice with methanol (3 mL) and dried under vacuum to yield 141 mg of HBIm4. To 100 mg of HBIm4, 1.23 mL of a 50 mg mL−1 solution of PEI in IPA was added and the mixture was allowed to stir vigorously for at least 2 h. Some HBIm4 remained un-dissolved. The mixture was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter to yield a clear solution which was diluted with 25 volumes of IPA before being used for device fabrication. Integration of a 1H NMR spectrum indicated approximately 1 BIm4 anion for every 6 or 7 ethylenimine repeat units. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ 7.33 (1H, s), 7.06 (1H, s), 6.88 (1H, s), 2.5–2.8 (8.3H, br).
General methods
Scanning electron microscope measurements (SEM) were performed using an S-4800 Hitachi high-Technology microscope. SEM samples were prepared by spin-coating perovskite precursor solutions onto PEDOT:PSS-coated glass/ITO substrates in the same manner as LESC devices were prepared. For X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, perovskite films were coated on UV-ozone treated glass substrates and diffractograms were collected using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at a scan rate of 2.4° min−1. UV-vis absorption was measured using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer.
Perovskite films
To prepare MAPbBr3 precursor solutions for the one-step method, MABr and PbBr2 were dissolved at a 1.05:1 molar ratio in a mixture of DMF and DMSO solvents (7:3 [v/v]) with a concentration of 37.5 wt%. This solution was stirred with a magnetic stir-bar at 60 °C for 2 h prior to use.
To prepare PbBr2 solutions for the two-step method, PbBr2 was dissolved in a mixture of DMF and NMP (9:1 [v/v]) at a concentration of 367 mg mL−1. An MABr solution was prepared by dissolving MABr in IPA with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Both solutions were stirred with a magnetic stir-bar at room temperature for 2 h prior to use.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 10 min each. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) layer was deposited on cleaned ITO substrates by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. On top of the PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) layer, the perovskite (MAPbBr3) precursor solution (one-step method) was spin-cast at 500 rpm and 3000 rpm for 5 s and 50 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the film was treated by dropping chlorobenzene onto it after 30 s of spinning. The two step method was carried out as follows: a PbBr2 solution was first spin cast at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Directly on top of PbBr2 layer, an MABr solution was dropped and left to stand for 20 s, then the substrate was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Various electron transport layers were deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 40 s as described below. Finally, devices were completed by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) using Ag electrodes with a thickness of 120 nm.
Electron transport layer deposition
On top of the perovskite layer, one of the following ETL solutions was spin cast: A 50 mg mL−1 solution of ZnO NPs in chloroform or 10 mg mL−1 TPBI solution in chlorobenzene or 2 mg mL−1 PEI or PEIBIm4 solutions in isopropanol were spin-cast at 2500 rpm for 40 s. It should be noted that ZnO is known to react with MAPbI3 upon thermal annealing,41 however, we found that the ZnO NP ETL did not noticeably affect the stability of devices if it was deposited on top of the MAPbBr3 layer without thermal annealing.
Solar cell and LED characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2635A Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance was carried out under illumination by an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Apertures (13.0 mm2) made of thin metal were attached to each cell before measurement for J–V characteristics. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained with a PV measurements QE system under ambient conditions, with monochromated light from a xenon arc lamp. The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode and chopped at 100 Hz. LED measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Konica Minolta spectroradiometer (CS-2000, Minolta Co.).

Broader context
Solar cells convert light into electricity, while light-emitting diodes (LEDs) convert electricity into light. These two types of devices share similar designs, but, with few exceptions, cannot efficiently perform both functions. The similar architectures shared between some recently developed perovskite-based solar cells and LEDs raises the question of whether these materials can be used to make single devices that can reversibly transduce energy between light and electricity, or function as light-emitting solar cells. The properties of perovskite materials make them ideally suited to realize this type of “peroptronic” transducer. Recent investigations have demonstrated that perovskite solar cells can efficiently emit infrared radiation, however, visible light emission from perovskite solar cells until now remains a largely unexplored possibility.
