Air humidity can be a water source for producing solar H2. The concept is based on photoelectrochemistry in a gaseous environment using a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as a solid polymer electrolyte and a macroporous semiconductor electrode wrapped in a perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer. A prototype vapor-fed PEC cell using a TiO2 gas-diffusion electrode as an O2-evolving photoanode and a carbon-supported platinum catalyst cathode achieved water splitting to produce O2 and H2, which are physically separated from each other by the PEM. Herein, we demonstrate a PEM-PEC system consisting of a strontium titanate (SrTiO3) nanocrystalline layer decorated on titanium microfiber felt to achieve overall water splitting into H2 and O2 at a ratio of 2:1 on each electrode at an applied voltage of only 0.3 V under gaseous conditions. In comparison with TiO2 electrodes, the SrTiO3 gas-diffusion electrode decreased the external voltage and suppressed the gradual decomposition of the ionomer coated on the photoanode. These differences are because of the cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential and improvement of the Faraday efficiency of O2 evolution, respectively. The interface between the SrTiO3 surface and the ionomer thin film exhibited fast kinetics for O2 evolution from water adsorbates supplied from the gas phase and durability under ultraviolet light irradiation.
Introduction
Using sunlight as an alternative energy source is a challenge for solving the environmental problems related to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that will be encountered in the near future.1 The conversion of solar power to energy carriers, which can be stored and transported for later use, is necessary to mitigate the inherent intermittencies.2,3 Hydrogen (H2) is the simplest energy carrier, which is produced from water and can be efficiently used by fuel cell technologies. However, solar H2 production faces a problem in the cost of photovoltaic power generation. High overvoltage is also required for water electrolysis (2H2O → 2H2 + O2, ΔEo = 1.23 V) owing to the slow kinetics of proton-coupled multielectron transfer in water oxidation. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into H2 and O2 might be a competitively priced technique to convert solar energy into fuel on a large production scale (Fig. 1a).3–6 The key point is the development of low-cost photoanodes for water oxidation to produce O2.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of (a) photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using an n-type semiconductor electrode as the O2-evolving photoanode and (b) a PEC system for water vapor splitting using a macroporous photoanode, a proton exchange membrane (PEM), and a macroporous gas-diffusion cathode. 
PEC H2 production facilities require long sunshine hours and vast land, but there is concern regarding the water supply in arid areas such as deserts. It is considered that the use of water vapor on the sea surface at high relative humidity can solve the problem of water sources in solar water splitting.7–10 When gaseous water in the air is used, it is not necessary to purify seawater by removing salt and impurities, which corrode the apparatus and form by-products. Furthermore, no liquid transport system is required because water vapor is supplied by natural convection of the air over the sea.
Prototype vapor-fed PEC cells for water splitting have been investigated using an O2-evolving photoanode, an H2-evolving cathode, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as a solid polymer electrolyte (Fig. 1b).10–18 Unlike the powdered photocatalyst system, the PEC system can separate the H2 evolved at the cathode from the O2 evolved at the photoanode using a membrane with low permeation rates of the gases.19,20 In an all-solid PEM-PEC system designed for gaseous conditions, we have found that the photocurrent response was drastically enhanced by coating a Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer on the macroporous photoanode owing to the increase of proton conductivity and hygroscopic properties.14–16,21
The PEM-PEC cell using a TiO2 photoanode and a carbon black-supported platinum catalyst (Pt/CB) cathode, both of which are wrapped with the proton-conducting Nafion ionomer, can produce H2 with 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) from water vapor as the hydrogen source.14,15 The Nafion ionomer-coated anatase TiO2 nanotube array (TNTA) achieved an H2 production rate of 600 μmol min−1 with an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 16% at an applied voltage (ΔE) of 1.2 V under 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.14 For a rutile TiO2 thin layer electrode, H2 evolved at 330 μmol h−1 (IPCE = 9%) under 385 nm irradiation.15 However, the PEM-PEC cell using the TiO2 photoanode requires a relatively high ΔE, which is the potential difference between the photoanode and the cathode. We also confirmed that the FE of O2 evolution was slightly lower than 100% and CO2 was generated on the TiO2 photoanode.14,15 The evolution of CO2 is assignable to the undesired oxidation of the Nafion ionomer coating on the photoanode surface.
In this study, we focused on strontium titanate (SrTiO3) as the photoanode in the PEM-PEC system. SrTiO3 is a photocatalyst for overall water splitting into H2 and O2.22–24 It is also used as a host material for visible-light-driven photocatalysts.25–27 The conduction band (CB) minimum of SrTiO3 is suitable for H2 evolution because its flat band potential (Efb) is 0.25–0.30 V more cathodic than that of rutile TiO2 and anatase TiO2 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).28–31 The cathodic shift of Efb may lead to a negative shift of the onset potential (Eonset) of the photoanodic current. Therefore, the ΔE for PEC water splitting using SrTiO3 photoanodes is expected to decrease. We also consider that the SrTiO3 photoanode may show different photocatalytic properties for the undesired oxidation of the Nafion ionomer coating on the surface because it has been reported that the photocatalytic behavior of SrTiO3 is different from that of TiO2.32,33
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of a PEM-PEC cell for water vapor splitting at low ΔE without degradation of the Nafion ionomer, which is an essential material for fabricating a gas–electrolyte–semiconductor interface on the photoanode under gaseous conditions.14–16 For this study, we prepared a macroporous SrTiO3 photoanode by hydrothermal treatment of an anatase TNTA layer decorated on Ti microfiber felt, which was used as a gas-diffusion conductive substrate. The PEC properties of the TNTA and SrTiO3 photoanode were compared both in a liquid aqueous electrolyte and under gaseous conditions with the Nafion ionomer as the solid polymer electrolyte. We applied the ionomer-coated photoanodes to vapor-fed photoelectrolysis of water to investigate the characteristics of the macroporous SrTiO3 photoanodes in the PEM-PEC cell developed for fully gaseous conditions.
Results and discussion
Ti microfiber felt (thickness 0.1 mm, weight 15 mg cm−2, porosity 66.7%)34 was used as the gas-diffusion conductive substrate to fabricate macroporous electrodes with TNTA and SrTiO3 layers. The calculated specific surface area (Scal) of the Ti microfiber was 444 cm2 g−1, assuming a prismatic fiber with a 20 μm diameter from the density of hexagonal α-Ti (4.51 g cm−3). The Scal is much higher than that of a two-dimensional dense Ti plate with the same thickness (45.3 cm2 g−1). The interface area between the substrate and the oxide layer should be large to effectively collect the photoexcited electrons (e−) generated in the photoanode. We fabricated an amorphous TNTA layer by electrochemical anodization of the Ti microfiber felt in ethylene glycol with ammonium fluoride (NH4F) at 50 V for 3 h.14,35 The following annealing was performed in air at 550 °C for 1 h to crystallize TiO2 into the anatase phase. The obtained anatase TNTA microfiber, which is denoted as TNTA-550 (Fig. 2a), was hydrothermally treated in aqueous strontium hydroxide (Sr(OH)2) at 150 °C for 2 h to convert the anatase TiO2 into the SrTiO3 phase.36 The hydrothermally treated sample, which is denoted as STO-hyd, was annealed in air for 1 h at different temperatures (250–650 °C).
 Fig. 2  (a) Photos and (b) XRD patterns of the Ti microfiber after anodization in a fluoride electrolyte and calcination at 550 °C for 1 h (TNTA-550), the sample after hydrothermal treatment of the TNTA in 25 mmol L−1 Sr(OH)2 solution at 150 °C for 2 h (STO-hyd), and the sample after calcination of STO-hyd at 550 °C for 1 h (STO-550). 

Fig. 2b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared microfiber felt samples. STO-550 is the sample annealed at 550 °C. TNTA-550 contains anatase TiO2 (PDF #00-021-1272) in addition to the hexagonal α-Ti (PDF #00-044-1294) of the substrate. The hydrothermal treatment decreased the intensity of anatase peaks and generated peaks assigned to SrTiO3 (PDF #01-070-8508). The intensity of anatase TiO2 peaks in STO-hyd indicates that about 75% of anatase TiO2 was transformed into SrTiO3 by the hydrothermal reaction. The crystalline phase of STO-hyd was not significantly changed by annealing at 550 °C.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the anatase TiO2 and SrTiO3 layers on the Ti microfiber substrate. For TNTA-550, the surface of the microfibers was covered by TiO2 nanotubes with a pore size of about 100 nm and a wall thickness of about 20 nm.14 The length of the TNTA layer was 3–4 μm. STO-hyd also showed a tube-like structure even after the formation of the SrTiO3 crystalline phase. In contrast, calcination at 550 °C collapsed the structure into nanocrystalline particles with an average diameter of 60 nm on top and larger sizes inside the layers. The nanoparticles were vertically connected to each other to form column-like structures in the SrTiO3 layers. Such an interconnected pathway would facilitate the transport of the photoexcited e− to the conductive substrate in n-type semiconductor electrodes.35

The SEM images of STO-550 (Fig. 4) show that the fibrous macrostructure remained after the hydrothermal treatment and the subsequent calcination. The microfibers were uniformly decorated with the SrTiO3 layers, but there were large cracks in the long axis direction. The cracks were formed on the corner of the square cross-section of the Ti microfiber. The cut surface of the microfiber demonstrates that the SrTiO3 layers were vertically grown on the flat side of the prismatic substrate. The average diameter of the microfibers was expanded from the original 21 ± 2 μm to 25 ± 3 μm owing to the growth of the oxide layers with interparticle voids.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) was obtained by nitrogen (N2) adsorption isotherm measurement. The SBET of TNTA-550, STO-hyd, and STO-550 was 4.5 m2 g−1, 1.4 m2 g−1, and 1.6 m2 g−1, respectively. The measured SBET was derived from the oxide layers and the Ti microfiber substrate, but the Scal of the Ti microfiber (0.04 m2 g−1) was very low and below the quantification limit of SBET. Therefore, the SBET of the oxide layers can be estimated from the loading amount of the oxide. The loading amount and SBET of the TiO2 layers in TNTA-550 were 12 wt% and 37 m2 g−1, which agreed well with the reported SBET values of the TNTA (35–40 m2 g−1).37,38 We found that the SBET decreased due to the formation of the SrTiO3 crystalline phase. The SBET of spherical SrTiO3 particles with a diameter D is calculated using eqn (1) with the density ρ = 5.12 g cm−3. SBET = 6/(D × ρ).(1)
The SBET of the SrTiO3 layers, which was roughly estimated to be 7.3 m2 g−1, corresponds to spherical particles of D = 160 nm.
The PEC properties were investigated in an aqueous electrolyte solution (pH 6.7 buffer) in a conventional three-electrode configuration (see Fig. S2†). A silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl, 0.195 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) was used as the reference electrode. Fig. 5 shows the PEC performances of the electrodes in the aqueous electrolyte under UV light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (central wavelength λ = 365 nm, see Fig. S3†). The cyclic voltammograms showed an anodic photoresponse, which is typical behavior of n-type semiconductor electrodes and was attributed to the current flow of photoexcited e− of the CB. The anodic current was attributable to the consumption of photogenerated holes (h+) in the valence band (VB) by water oxidation. The photocurrent density (Jphoto) was saturated at higher anodic potentials indicating the upper limit of the IPCE.

The left-side figures show the cyclic voltammograms at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1. The right-side figures show the current density (J)–time curves at different applied potentials (EAg/AgCl = −0.3, 0, 0.3, and 1.0 V). 
We evaluated the Eonset of the photoanodic current in the backward scan. The Eonset of STO-hyd decreased by 0.2 V after calcination at 550 °C. From a thermodynamic point of view, the Eonset of the photoanode is decreased by the cathodic shift of Efb. However, the Efb values of STO-hyd and STO-550 should be constant because the calcination did not change the SrTiO3 crystalline phase (Fig. 2b). In general, it is rare to observe a clear relationship between the Efb and the Eonset, particularly for polycrystalline photoanode materials. Therefore, the negative shift of Eonset due to calcination is explained by the increase of the crystallinity of the SrTiO3 layers, which decreased the number of recombination sites. Note that it was difficult to reliably measure the Efb of the samples by Mott–Schottky analysis owing to the presence of large capacitance around the Efb (see Fig. S4†). An important point is that the calcination at 550 °C decreased the cathodic current of STO-hyd in the dark, which was assignable to the e− accumulation in the oxide layers rather than H2 evolution. The cathodic Jphoto observed in the reverse scan also decreased due to calcination. These cathodic currents are considered to promote the recombination loss of the photogenerated h+ in STO-hyd at low anodic bias. Therefore, the high crystallinity of the SrTiO3 layers is necessary to reduce the recombination of photogenerated h+ due to the reverse charge flow near the Efb, where the electric field of the space charge layer is weak.
The steady-state photocurrent response was investigated by chronoamperometry at different electrode potentials. The Jphoto at EAg/AgCl = −0.3 V was clearly observed for STO-550, but negligible for TNTA-550 and STO-hyd. In contrast to STO-550, small cathodic currents were observed for TNTA-550 and STO-hyd in the dark (Fig. S5,† the enlargement of the J–time curves at EAg/AgCl = −0.3 V). The cathodic current, which is the charge flow in the opposite direction to the flow of photoexcited e−, promotes the recombination loss of the photogenerated h+. Therefore, the Jphoto of STO-hyd was very low at −0.3 V. In contrast, the absence of the dark cathodic current explains the high Jphoto of STO-550 at low anodic bias.

Fig. 6a summarizes the effects of the applied potential on the IPCE, which is calculated from the steady-state Jphoto [mA cm−2] and the incident light intensity (I0 [mW cm−2]) using eqn (2). IPCE = (1240/λ [nm]) × Jphoto/I0.(2)

(c) Action spectra of (circle) TNTA-550 and (square) STO-550 at ERHE = 0.6 and 0.9 V (I0 < 1 mW cm−2). (d) Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of TNTA-550, STO-hyd, and STO-550. The IPCE of (a–c) was obtained in an aqueous electrolyte (pH 6.7). 
The potential vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (ERHE) can be obtained using the Nernst relationship between pH and the potential vs. Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) in eqn (3). ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.195.(3)
The IPCE of STO-550 was superior to that of TNTA-550 at low ERHE. The steady-state Eonset (V vs. RHE) was estimated to be 0.05 V for STO-550 and 0.25 V for TNTA-550 and STO-hyd by extrapolation. The IPCE of STO-550 monotonically increased with an increase in the ERHE and became saturated at ERHE ≥ 0.9 V. This saturation was not due to the mass transfer limitation since the Jphoto increased with an increase in I0.

Fig. 6b shows the effect of calcination temperature on the IPCE of STO-hyd at different ERHE (see Fig. S6,† steady-state photocurrent response). The best calcination temperature range was 450–550 °C, and calcination at 650 °C decreased the IPCE. The analysis of the XRD patterns indicated that the normalized peak area of SrTiO3 was maximized at 450 °C, but the difference was too small to explain the performance difference (see Fig. S7†). SEM observation showed the gradual change of the tube-like structure to the particulate structure with an increase in the calcination temperature (see Fig. S8†). The photocurrent response at ERHE = 0.3 V was confirmed only for the STO samples with the interconnected nanocrystalline structure providing good e− transport pathways. It is suggested that the high crystallinity and the interconnected structure are important factors for the Jphoto of STO-550 at low anodic bias.

Fig. 6c shows the IPCE action spectra measured under monochromatic light irradiation with different λ. A photocurrent response was clearly observed at λ = 380 nm for both TNTA-550 and STO-550. The IPCE values of STO-550 were lower than those of TNTA-550 in the whole λ at ERHE = 0.9 V. In contrast, there was no significant difference at ERHE = 0.6 V. The IPCE of STO-550 was maximized at λ = 365 nm and the value (23.3%) was higher than that of TNTA-550 (16.6%) at ERHE = 0.6 V. The IPCE values of the SrTiO3 photoanode became lower as the irradiation wavelength became shorter. This behavior is not fully understood, but it might be related to the electronic structure of SrTiO3. The band gap energy (Eg) of SrTiO3 is 3.25 eV (∼380 nm) for indirect transition and 3.75 eV (∼330 nm) for direct transition.39

Fig. 6d shows the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of the sample layers on microfiber felt. The photoabsorption edge was located at around 380 nm and was very consistent with the λ of the photocurrent response in the action spectra. This indicates that the Jphoto is generated by the interband transition of e− from the VB to the CB. The optical Eg calculated from the relative reflectance (R) was found to be about 3.2 eV (see Fig. S9,† Tauc plot for indirect transition), which agreed with the reported Eg of anatase TiO2 and SrTiO3.29,30
The oxide layers on Ti microfibers were used in a photoanode in a vapor-fed PEC system. We fabricated membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using the macroporous photoanode, a Nafion N117 membrane as the PEM, and a film of the Pt/CB catalyst mixed with the Nafion ionomer as an H2-evolving cathode (see Fig. S10†). The fabricated MEA was installed in an H-type dual-compartment glass reactor (irradiation area 1 cm2, see Fig. S11†). The PEC properties were investigated under a continuous flow of argon (Ar) with water vapor (3 vol%, relative humidity > 90%) at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. There was no chemical potential difference between the photoanode and cathode compartments. We also confirmed visually that there were no droplets of liquid water on the MEA in the glass reactor.

Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent response of STO-550 attached on a Nafion membrane in humidified argon under UV irradiation (λ = 365 nm) at ΔE = 1.2 V. The Jphoto of bare STO-550 was very low under gaseous conditions, suggesting the slow kinetics of water oxidation in the absence of an aqueous electrolyte. This indicates that the reaction in the water vapor environment is totally different from the conventional liquid-phase reaction. In contrast, the Jphoto was drastically increased by coating a Nafion ionomer thin film, which was prepared by drop casting 5 wt% ionomer dispersion (5.0 μL cm−2) on each side of the front and back. The solvent was evaporated by heating at 80 °C. Fig. 7b summarizes the effect of ionomer loading on the IPCE of STO-550 after the coating treatment, which was repeated several times through a drying process. The IPCE was drastically increased by the first coating (0.4 mg cm−2) and became saturated at high loading (2.4 mg cm−2) at each ΔE. The IPCE under gas-phase conditions (5–8% at ΔE = 0.3 V) was similar to that of bare STO-550 in an aqueous electrolyte (5.7% at ERHE = 0.3 V, Fig. 6). This indicates that the supply of water as a reaction substrate is sufficient under a flow of 3 vol% water vapor for the ionomer-coated STO-550. The proton-coupled multielectron transfer under completely gaseous conditions is accelerated by the Nafion ionomer coating, which plays the role of the electrolyte. The gas-permeable ionomer thin film coated on the semiconductor surface forms a triple-phase boundary for the vapor-fed PEC reactions. As a result, the PEC performance of the ionomer-coated STO-550 in the gaseous environment was comparable to that of STO-550 in an aqueous electrolyte. The Nafion ionomer thin films were observed by SEM after gold sputtering treatment to suppress the charge up during the observation (Fig. S12†). We confirmed that the surface of SrTiO3 nanoparticles was enwrapped in the ionomer thin films (Fig. 7c and d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping images revealed that some ionomers were segregated in the void spaces and the middle part of the microfiber felt after coating four times (Fig. S13 and S14†). Therefore, the thickness of the ionomer thin film is difficult to estimate, but it is roughly 8 nm assuming that a coating of Nafion (1.98 g cm−3) covers the surface of the oxide layer uniformly and completely.

The adsorption of water on the Nafion ionomer increases the proton conductivity of the macroporous SrTiO3 photoanode. Fig. 8a shows the diffuse reflectance infrared (IR) spectra of SrTiO3 powders under different water vapor pressures, P(H2O). IR absorption of the adsorbed water was observed in the regions of the water bending mode (1580–2200 cm−1) and hydroxyl group stretching mode (2500–3800 cm−1). A band at 1640 cm−1 and a broad band at 2900–3650 cm−1 are attributed to liquid-like water layers (H2O)n adsorbed on the oxide surface.40,41
 Fig. 8  Diffuse reflectance IR spectra of (a) bare SrTiO3 powder and (b) the SrTiO3 powder mixed with a Nafion ionomer (50:50 wt%) at different water-vapor pressures, P(H2O) = 100–2500 Pa. Left-side and right-side figures show the region of the bending mode and OH stretching mode of water. The dashed curve shows the spectrum of the liquid-like water adsorbate (difference spectrum of bare SrTiO3 between 2000 and 2500 Pa). 

Fig. 8b shows the P(H2O)-dependent IR spectra of the SrTiO3 powder mixed with the Nafion ionomer. A broad band at 1740 cm−1 and a broad band at 3100–3750 cm−1 appeared at P(H2O) = 100 Pa. The band at 1740 cm−1 was attributed to the bending mode of water molecules of hydrated hydronium ions, (H3O+)(H2O)n.42–44 The growth of the bending band at 1740 cm−1 with an increase of P(H2O) was accompanied by the appearance of a band at 1620 cm−1 assigned to water layers, which form channels of weakly hydrogen-bonded water adsorbates to increase the proton conductivity.44 Another feature of the weak hydrogen-bond network was observed in the OH stretching region. The broad OH stretching band was shifted to higher wavenumbers compared with the case of liquid-like water layers adsorbed on the bare SrTiO3. The observed blue shift suggests that the hydrogen bonds of the water adsorbed on the ionomer-coated SrTiO3 are substantially weaker than those of the liquid-like water layers.40,41 Therefore, the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules interacting with the Nafion ionomer are significantly different from the intermolecular interaction in the liquid-like water layers. A weak sharp shoulder at 3685 cm−1 observed for the ionomer-coated SrTiO3 also indicates the presence of a “free” OH group not involved in the hydrogen bonding.41
The integrated IR absorption intensities of the water adsorbed on the ionomer-coated SrTiO3 were much higher than those on the bare SrTiO3, indicating that the coated ionomer enhances water adsorption on the surface even at low P(H2O). The Nafion ionomer exhibits a hygroscopic nature enabling it to adsorb low-concentration water vapor in the gas phase. This property would be very important in a PEM-PEC system operated under low humidity conditions.
We performed PEC water splitting using a planar-type dual-compartment stainless-steel reactor with a UV irradiation area of 2.0 cm2 by dosing water vapor (see Fig. S15†). The Ti microfibers decorated with oxide layers were used for the photoanode after the fourth coating of the Nafion ionomer (loading 2.4 mg cm−2). Fig. 9 shows the results obtained using the ionomer-coated TiO2 and SrTiO3 electrodes in the vapor-fed PEC system at different ΔE. The photocurrent initially spiked and gradually decreased to a steady value when ΔE was low. The Jphoto of STO-550 was higher than that of TNTA-550 at ΔE ≥ 0.3 V. The cyclic voltammograms show that the ΔEonset of STO-550 is less than that of TNTA-550 (see Fig. S16†) as discussed earlier.

Fig. 9b shows the formation rates of gases in the PEM-PEC cell analyzed by gas chromatography. The two compartments of the cell were separated by the Nafion membrane sandwiched by the photoanode and the cathode. At ΔE ≥ 0.3 V, the H2 evolution rate in the cathode compartment was consistent with half of the charge flow (e−/2) passing through the outer circuit. This indicates that two-electron reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2) is promoted on the ionomer-coated Pt/CB catalyst. In the photoanode compartment, CO2 was evolved in addition to O2 for the ionomer-coated TNTA-550, but CO2 was below the limit of quantification for the ionomer-coated STO-550. We found that the four-electron oxidation of water (2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+) was promoted over the SrTiO3 photoanode at ΔE ≥ 0.3 V because the O2 evolution rate was consistent with one-quarter of the charge flow (e−/4). Overall water splitting was proved by the ratio of 2:1 for H2 and O2 evolution in the vapor-fed PEM-PEC cell using the SrTiO3 photoanode at ΔE = 0.3 V (see Fig. S17†). In the case of the TNTA, H2 was evolved even at ΔE = 0 V as previously reported.14,17 However, the H2 evolution was not necessarily derived from overall water splitting because the major product was CO2 at ΔE = 0.3 V. This suggests that the coated Nafion ionomer works as a sacrificial e− donor in the case of the Jphoto of TNTA-550 at ΔE ≤ 0.3 V.

Table 1 summarizes the IPCE and FE values for the vapor-fed PEM-PEC cell. The FE was calculated using eqn (4). FE = (ne × F × r)/Jphoto,(4)where ne is the number of e− required to form a product (2 for H2 and 4 for O2), F is the Faraday constant, and r is the rate of product formation. The IPCE of STO-550 (20.2%) was higher than that of TNATA-550 (17.3%) at ΔE = 1.2 V under λ = 365 nm (42 mW cm−2). In the case of the TNTA-550 photoanode, the FE of O2 evolution was less than 100% even at 1.2 V owing to CO2 formation. The oxidative decomposition of the coated ionomer into CO2 is considered to be promoted by radical species such as hydroxyl radicals, which can be generated by one-electron oxidation of water (H2O + h+ → ·OH + H+).45–47 When STO-550 was used as the photoanode, the FE of O2 was almost 100% owing to the absence of CO2 formation. The difference in the reactivity would be dependent on the surface properties of TiO2 and SrTiO3. Further study is required to elucidate the mechanism at a molecular level.

Fig. 10 shows the results of the long term durability test of the PEM-PEC system. Water splitting in a vapor environment was performed using a scaled-up reactor with a UV irradiation area of 16 cm2 (see Fig. S18†). The photocurrent of the ionomer-coated TNTA-550 gradually decreased with the PEC operation time. In contrast, the photocurrent was relatively constant when the ionomer-coated STO-550 was used as the photoanode. The IPCE after the 10 h PEC reaction was 15.5% and 6.3% for STO-550 and TNTA-550, respectively. In the case of TNTA-550, the O2 evolution rate was lower than e−/4 owing to the formation of CO2. The CO2 evolution rate gradually decreased, but the photocurrent also decreased. For STO-550, the O2 evolution rate was almost consistent with e−/4, but a small amount of CO2 formation was observed in this large scale cell. However, the photocurrent of STO-550 was more stable than that of TNTA-550. We also confirmed that PEC water splitting is induced even when the water vapor concentration is 1.4 vol% (relative humidity ∼ 45%) (Fig. S19†).

We performed EDS elemental analysis of the photoanodes after the PEC reaction (Table 2). The decrease of the atomic percentages of carbon and fluorine on the ionomer-coated TNTA-550 indicated the degradation of the coated Nafion ionomer during the PEC reaction. The removal of the Nafion ionomer from the TNTA-550 surface was confirmed using the EDS elemental mapping image (Fig. S20†). Similar behavior was observed for the rutile TiO2 electrode during PEC water splitting under a vapor stream.15 However, there was no significant change for the ionomer-coated STO-550 electrodes before and after the vapor-fed photoelectrolysis of water. The durability of the PEM-PEC system in the water vapor environment was improved by the use of SrTiO3 instead of TiO2 as the photoanode. The photogenerated h+ in the VB of SrTiO3 were selectively used for the four-electron oxidation of water to produce O2 instead of forming radical species to decompose the ionomer. The suppression of CO2 formation resulted in improved durability of the PEM-PEC system under UV irradiation.

Finally, we investigated the effect of light intensity on the photocurrent response (Fig. 11). When the I0 of a UV LED was increased step by step, the Jphoto of STO-550 monotonically increased, but the Jphoto of TNTA-550 became saturated at around I0 = 60 mW cm−2. As a result, the IPCE of TNTA-550 drastically decreased with an increase in I0. This is in contrast with STO-550, which exhibited a relatively high IPCE even under high I0 where a large number of photoexcited e− and h+ were generated. The high IPCE even under high I0 suggests the fast kinetics of water oxidation to produce O2 on the SrTiO3 surface. The high selectivity of O2 evolution is also explained by the fast kinetics of the proton-coupled multielectron transfer process because the water oxidation intermediates might be a reactive species to promote undesired oxidation of the Nafion ionomer. Investigation of the reaction mechanism is planned to further understand the specific properties of the SrTiO3 surface for water oxidation and high selectivity and fast kinetics of O2 evolution.

In this study, we have succeeded in developing a vapor-fed PEM-PEC system for overall water splitting at a low electrical bias of ΔE = 0.3 V. The results provided information to facilitate the design of photoanodes for the PEM-PEC system: (1) Eonset of photocurrent response can be shifted in a negative direction using an n-type semiconductor with a high energy level (more negative) Efb, high crystallinity, and an interconnected nanocrystalline structure, (2) the reaction selectivity of the photogenerated h+ on the photoanode surface affects not only the Faraday efficiency of O2 evolution but also the long-term stability of the Nafion ionomer-coated photoanode in the PEM-PEC system, (3) the water molecules in the gas phase are efficiently adsorbed on the Nafion ionomer thin film, and (4) the SrTiO3 photoanode has good photocurrent response even under high I0, suggesting the fast kinetics of multielectron transfer from the water adsorbate. For further development, we have to use solar energy more efficiently by using narrow gap materials, which should exhibit a high energy level Efb, high charge separation at a low electric field, and high selectivity for O2 evolution. One candidate is visible-light-sensitized SrTiO3, which can be synthesized by metal cation doping.25–27
Experimental
Preparation of oxide-decorated Ti microfiber felt
Sintered Ti microfiber felt (Nikko Techno, Japan) was cleaned in acetone and deionized water before electrochemical anodization to prepare the TNTA on the Ti microfibers. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode system at ΔE = 50 V for 3 h at 20 °C. The electrolyte solution was composed of ethylene glycol (99.5%, Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan), 0.25 wt% NH4F (97%, Wako Pure Chemicals), and 10 vol% H2O. The obtained TNTA layer on the Ti microfiber felt was washed with water, dried at 80 °C, and calcined in air at 550 °C for 1 h to obtain the anatase sample called TNTA-550.
The TNTA-550 was treated in an aqueous solution of 25 mmol L−1 Sr(OH)2 under hydrothermal conditions. The solution was prepared by dissolving 0.6 g of Sr(OH)2·8H2O (90%, Wako Pure Chemicals) in 80 mL deionized water. The TNTA-550 was soaked in the solution and maintained in a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined autoclave under auto-generated pressure at 150 °C for 2 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the sample was washed with water and dried at 80 °C. The obtained SrTiO3 layer on Ti microfiber felt, which is denoted as STO-hyd, was calcined in air at 250–650 °C for 1 h. The samples calcined at 550 °C are denoted as STO-550.
A Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer dispersion (5 wt% in alcohol and 45 wt% water, Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Japan) was used for coating the macroporous electrodes. Drop casting with a coverage of 10 μL cm−2 (5.0 μL cm−2 on each of the front and back sides) was repeated several times after drying at 80 °C for 30 min.
Characterization of the electrodes
XRD measurements were carried out on a SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 200 mA. Calibration curves were obtained from anatase TiO2 and SrTiO3 powders (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan). SEM images and EDS elemental maps were recorded on a JSM-7800F (JEOL, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. SEM images were also obtained on an S-5200 (Hitachi, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Sputter coating of gold was applied for the sample using an E-1010 (Hitachi) to reduce the charge-up of the Nafion ionomer. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the Ti microfibers decorated with oxide layers were measured at −196 °C after evacuation at 200 °C for 2 h (BELSORP-mini; Bel Japan, Japan). Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with an integrating sphere using the Ti microfiber felt on barium sulfate powder as a reference.
IR spectroscopy of SrTiO3 powder
The diffuse reflectance IR spectra of SrTiO3 powder (Wako Pure Chemicals) were measured using an FT/IR-6600 spectrometer (JASCO, Japan) equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The sample (20 mg) was held in a high vacuum cell equipped with a CaF2 window. The background was recorded with the sample in a vacuum (pressure < 10−3 Pa). The intensity of IR absorption was estimated using the Kubelka–Munk equation.
PEC measurements in an aqueous electrolyte
A conventional three-electrode system consisting of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode was used in a one-compartment glass reactor. The electrode potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode is 0.195 V vs. SHE. The oxide-decorated Ti microfiber felt was soaked in an aqueous electrolyte solution of 0.2 mol L−1 sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and 0.1 mol L−1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7). The O2 dissolved in the electrolyte was purged by argon bubbling. The electrode potential was controlled using an ECstat-101 potentiostat (EC Frontier, Japan). Photoirradiation was performed using a 365 nm UV light-emitting diode (LED, NS365L-7SMG, Nitride Semiconductors, Japan) and a 300 W xenon lamp with bandpass filters (MAX-303, Asahi Spectra, Japan). The irradiation area was adjusted to 1.0 cm2 by masking the electrode surface using polyimide film tapes.
Preparation of the membrane electrode assembly
A cathode film was prepared on a polytetrafluoroethylene sheet by a bar coating method using catalyst ink containing 47 wt% Pt/CB (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku, Japan) and Nafion ionomer (weight ratio 1:1). The Pt loading of the film was about 0.15 mg cm−2. The ionomer-mixed Pt/CB film was transferred onto a Nafion membrane (thickness of 183 μm, N117, DuPont, USA) by a hot pressing method at 15 kN and 140 °C. Then, the oxide layer decorated on the Ti microfiber felt was attached to the membrane on the opposite side of the cathode by hot pressing at 10 kN and 140 °C. The prepared MEA was applied for PEC measurements in the gas phase.
PEC measurements in the gas phase
Two-electrode systems were used in an H-type dual-compartment glass reactor (irradiation area 1.0 cm2) and two planar-type dual-compartment stainless-steel reactors (irradiation area 2.0 and 16.0 cm2). The fabricated MEA was sandwiched with two current collectors of a gold-coated copper plate. The current collectors had square window(s) for UV irradiation. Wet-proofed Toray carbon paper (5 × 5 cm, Fuel Cell Store, USA) was used as the gas-diffusion layer of the ionomer-mixed Pt/CB cathode. The MEA for the H-type glass reactor was prepared with a size of 40 × 40 mm2 for the Nafion membrane and 14 × 14 mm2 for the electrodes. The ΔE was controlled using an ECstat-101 potentiostat and photoirradiation was performed using an NS365L-7SMG LED. The MEAs for the planar-type stainless-steel reactors were prepared with a size of 50 × 50 mm2 for the Nafion membrane and 20 × 20 mm2 for the electrodes and a size of 80 × 80 mm2 for the Nafion membrane and 50 × 50 mm2 for the electrodes. The direct-current ΔE between the two electrodes was controlled using a VersaSTAT3 potentiostat (AMETEK, USA). Photoirradiation was performed using 365 nm UV LEDs (custom made lamp; Nitride Semiconductors).
Water vapor was introduced into each compartment by passing argon (20 mL min−1) through a bubbler filled with deionized water at room temperature. The concentration of water vapor was about 3 vol% and the relative humidity was higher than 90%, which was measured by a humidity transmitter (EE33, E+E Elektronik, Austria). The H2 in the cathode compartment was analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD, GC-8A; Shimadzu) equipped with an MS-5A column of an Ar carrier. The O2 and CO2 in the photoanode compartments were analyzed using two GC-TCDs (GC-8A and GC-2014; Shimadzu) with an MS-5A column with an Ar carrier and a Shincarbon-ST column with a He carrier.
Conclusions
Overall water splitting into H2 and O2 with a 2:1 ratio was achieved using Nafion ionomer-coated SrTiO3 microfiber felt as the O2 evolution photoanode in a PEM-PEC cell. Vapor-fed photoelectrolysis of water was induced at ΔE = 0.3 V under UV irradiation at room temperature under atmospheric pressure (IPCE = 3.9% at λ = 365 nm, FE of H2 and O2 ≥ 99%). The overpotential for PEC water oxidation to produce O2 was cathodically shifted by using SrTiO3 layers. Calcination treatment of SrTiO3 enhanced the Jphoto at 0.3 V vs. RHE owing to the decrease of the recombination loss, which is indicated by the decrease of the cathodic current at potentials less than Efb. The coated ionomer was revealed to increase the water adsorption amount in a low concentration of water vapor and form hydrated hydronium ions with weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The proton conductivity of the hydrated ionomer enhanced the proton-coupled multielectron transfer from the water adsorbate by the photogenerated h+ on the photoanode surface in the gaseous environment.
The SrTiO3 photoanode was revealed to suppress the undesired oxidation of the gas permeable ionomer thin film coated on the electrode surface, which easily occurs on TiO2 photoanodes. Because the triple-phase boundary, which is the gas–electrolyte–semiconductor interface, is essential for the charge transfer process in a water vapor environment, the photocurrent of the PEM-PEC system using TiO2 photoanodes gradually decreased with the degradation of the ionomer thin film. In contrast, the vapor-fed PEM-PEC system using the SrTiO3 photoanode was robust and durable (H2 evolution rate = 550 μmol h−1 at ΔE = 1.2 V after 10 h operation). The low CO2 evolution rate indicates the high selectivity for O2 evolution by four-electron oxidation of water molecules adsorbed on the SrTiO3–ionomer interface. The superior photocurrent response even under high incident UV light intensity confirms the fast kinetics of water oxidation to produce O2 over the SrTiO3 surface.
