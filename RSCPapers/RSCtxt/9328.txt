    , Accepted 24th December 2019First published on 26th December 2019AbstractTwo conjugated donor polymers (PBTz-1 and PBTz-2) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thiazolothiazole (TzTz) with different side chain (2-hexyldecyl) positions were designed and synthesized. Both polymers had similar optical and electrochemical bandgaps as well as deep HOMO levels, but significantly different aggregation behaviors in solution and photovoltaic performances in NF PSCs. Combining their absorption spectra, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements, we found that PBTz-1 exhibited stronger aggregation in solution and crystallization in film than PBTz-2. When they were blended with a non-fullerene acceptor (IT-4F), their blend films showed large differences in organizations and morphologies. In PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based PSC was only 6.2%, while the PCE of the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC was up to 12.4%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide interest in both academic and industrial communities due to their unique advantages, such as low-cost production, light weight, flexibility and semi-transparency.1–3 The molecular innovation of active layer materials, which consist of a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor, has driven the development of this field.4–8 Low bandgap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as ITIC, Y6 and their derivatives, were prepared and applied in PSCs.9–12 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs were rapidly increased to 16% in single-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs.13,14 In high-performance PSCs, NFAs usually have strong absorption from 700 nm to the near-infrared (NIR) region. To obtain high circuit-current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) in resulting photovoltaic devices, the corresponding polymer donor requires a wide bandgap (WBG) and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. Unfortunately, not all WBG conjugated polymers with deep HOMO levels can achieve favourable BHJ morphologies with NFAs;15,16 because the planar conjugated backbones of NFAs possess anisotropic charge carrier transporting properties, it is difficult for them to form effective stacking with polymer donors.17 To overcome this issue, polymer donors need to possess suitable aggregation properties in solution.18,19 Therefore, the design of WBG polymer donors with deep HOMO energy levels and suitable aggregation behaviours in solution is of vital importance to achieve high PCEs in PSCs.
Currently, only a few electron-withdrawing units have been used to produce high-performance WBG conjugated polymers (PCEs >12%) in NF PSCs, such as fluorine-substituted benzotriazole (FBTA),20–23 benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),11,24–26 fluorine-substituted quinoxaline (FQX),27 and thiadiazole.28 Thiazolothiazole (TzTz) is another strong electron-withdrawing unit, which has strong crystallization and a highly planar skeleton.29 The design, synthesis, and characterization of TzTz-based polymers have undergone important progress in the past decade.30–33 However, most TzTz-containing polymers exhibit low photovoltaic performances; the best PCEs of TzTz-based polymers are only 7.7% and 11.9% in fullerene derivative- and NFA-based single-junction PSCs.34,35 Three reasons may limit their application in PSCs. (1) Poor solubility: two 3-ethylhexylthiophenes are usually flanked both sides on TzTz to improve their solubility. However, these flexible side chains are too small to provide enough solubility for achieving polymers with high molecular weights. To obtain high molecular weight polymers by the Stille coupling reaction, a tin compound employing large side chains with superior solubility has to be prepared. However, this kind of tin compound is very difficult to obtain in high purity from recrystallization due to its low crystallinity. Considering that most tin compounds are decomposed after purification by column chromatography, the low purity of tin compounds, even if they have excellent solubility, is still not helpful in achieving high molecular weight polymers. (2) High HOMO levels: the HOMO levels of TzTz-based polymers usually locate at −5.30 to −5.45 eV. This is not beneficial to obtain high VOC, especially when TzTz-based polymers are blended with deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level NFAs. (3) Aggregation properties: in NF PSCs, the suitable aggregation behaviours of donor polymers play a crucial role in obtaining favourable BHJ morphologies. Currently, investigation of the relationship between aggregation behaviour and photovoltaic performance in TzTz-based polymers is rare. Therefore, the design, synthesis, and study of novel TzTz-based polymers are essential to address the above issues and further improve their device performances in PSCs.
Based on the above considerations, in this work, we designed and synthesized two WBG conjugated polymers based on TzTz units (PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, Chart 1). 4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene was used as an electron-donating part, because it is one of the popular units to construct conjugated polymers with deep HOMO levels. To improve the solubility and investigate the aggregation behaviours of the resulting polymers, the long side chains of 2-hexyldecyl were grafted onto thiophene in conjugated backbones with different positions (facing the TzTz unit for PBTz-1 and facing the BDT unit for PBTz-2). This minor difference in both polymers had a significant effect on their aggregation properties in solution and photovoltaic performances. After blending with the NFA of IT-4F, the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based device showed a PCE of 6.2%, while the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based device showed an outstanding PCE of 12.4%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the two polymers is shown in Scheme 1. Monomer 5 was synthesized from a commercial material 3-bromothiophene. The Kumada coupling was performed between 3-bromothiophene and fresh (2-hexyldecyl)magnesium bromide to produce 3-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophene (1), which was treated with NBS to yield 2-bromo-3-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophene (2), and then it was converted to 3-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3) by reacting with n-butyllithium and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Subsequently, the condensation reaction was carried out between compound 3 and dithiooxamide to obtain corresponding thiazolothiazole (4). Finally, the desired monomer 5 was obtained via the bromination of compound 4. To obtain different side chain positions of the thiazolothiazole derivative, compound 1 was directly reacted with fresh lithium diisopropylamide and DMF to yield 4-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (6). Subsequently, the condensation and bromination reactions were performed in turn to obtain desired monomer 8. Both polymers (PBTz-1 and PBTz-2) were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction between monomer 5 or 8 and monomer 9. Both polymers have excellent solubility in various solutions such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PBTz-1 and PBTz-2 were determined to be 26.3 and 28.5 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (Đ) of 2.4 and 2.5, respectively, by the GPC method using polystyrene as the standard and o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 145 °C (Table 1). The thermal properties of both polymers were investigated by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Both polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, with 5% weight loss at the same temperature of 433 °C.

Quantum chemistry calculations and optical and electrochemical properties
The only difference in both polymers is the substituted position of side chains; to investigate the geometries of both polymers, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the trimers of both polymers.36 The calculations were carried out using methyl and isobutyl units to replace 2-ethylhexyl and 2-hexyldecyl substituents. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1a and b show that the orientation of alkylated thiophene plays a vital role in affecting the molecular twisting barrier and dihedral angles. For instance, when alkylated thiophene faces the TzTz unit, the optimal dihedral angles are 15° and 25° with BDT and TzTz units, respectively. When alkylated thiophene faces the BDT unit, the optimal dihedral angles are 45° and 0° with BDT and TzTz units, respectively. On the whole, PBTz-2 has a larger twisting barrier than PBTz-1 due to a significantly high twisting barrier in Tz-T2, suggesting that PBTz-2 could have a more stable conformation than PBTz-1. As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimal conformation of the trimer of PBTz-1 shows the twist angles of 5.1°, 17.9°, 18.0° and 1.4° in turn. When the isobutyl group faces the BDT unit, the corresponding twist angles in the trimer of PBTz-2 are 27.7°, 0.6°, 1.9° and 32.9° in turn. These results suggest that PBTz-2 has a more twisted conjugated backbone compared to PBTz-1, but these different twist angles in both polymer main chains have a weak influence on their electron density distributions on their HOMO and LUMO (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The dipole moment of the trimer of PBTZ-1 (0.18 Debye) is significantly smaller than that of the trimer of PBTz-2 (0.89 Debye). The HOMO/LUMO levels were calculated to be −2.71/−5.04 eV and −2.73/−5.01 eV for the trimers of PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, respectively. To explain different bandgaps of both polymers, the energy levels of the donor parts (D1 and D2) and TzTz unit in both polymers (see Fig. S2a, ESI†) were calculated by DFT calculations.37 Compared to D1, D2 has a deeper HOMO level (0.03 eV), which implies that D2 is a slightly weaker electron-donating unit than D1. Consider that the different twisted angels in both polymers will impact on their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) abilities. Thus, these two aspects could determine that the trimer of PBTz-1 (2.33 eV) has a larger band gap than PBTz-2 (2.28 eV).

The optical properties of both polymers were investigated by using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in diluted chlorobenzene solution and film. The corresponding data are collected in Table 1. In diluted chlorobenzene solution at room temperature (Fig. 2a), PBTz-1 exhibits two peaks (α 543 nm and β 587 nm) at long wavelengths. After changing the side chain positions, PBTz-2 shows two slightly bathochromic peaks (α′ and β′) at 552 and 600 nm, respectively. This result implies that PBTz-1 has weaker ICT between electron-donating and electron-accepting units along the conjugated backbone than PBTz-2. On the other hand, the ratio of α/β (1.29) in PBTz-1 is higher than that in PBTz-2 (α′/β′ 1.03), indicating that PBTz-1 has stronger aggregation than PBTz-2 in chlorobenzene solution.38 In films (Fig. 2b), both polymers display slightly broader and red-shifted spectra compared with those in chlorobenzene solution. The optical bandgaps are 1.98 and 1.92 eV for PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the DFT calculations in which PBTZ-1 has a slightly larger bandgap than PBTz-2. To deeply understand the aggregation properties of both polymers, we employed a variable temperature UV-vis spectrophotometer to investigate their absorption spectra. When the solution temperature gradually increased, the absorption intensities of α and β peaks in PBTz-1 were slowly decreased; both peaks still existed even though the solution was heated to 100 °C, while the absorption intensities of α′ and β′ peaks in PBTz-2 were quickly decreased and disappeared at 80 °C. The aggregation of PBTz-2 had been eliminated at 90 °C, which implied that PBTz-1 had stronger aggregation in solution than PBTz-2. This could be attributed to the more planar conjugated backbone of PBTz-1. These results suggested that tuning the position of the side chain in conjugated polymers had a strong influence on their aggregation behaviours.

The electrochemical properties of both polymers were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) from their films as shown in Fig. 3a. The HOMO/LUMO levels of both polymers were estimated from their onset oxidation/reduction potential according to the empirical formula EHOMO/LUMO = −(EonsetOx/Red − E1/2Fc/Fc+ + 4.8) eV. The HOMO/LUMO values were calculated to be −5.52/−3.35 eV and −5.49/−3.43 eV for PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, respectively. These values showed the same tendency as the calculation from DFT results. Among the reported donor polymers in PSCs, such deep HOMO levels are rarely reported. It can be expected to obtain high VOC in the resulting NF PSCs. Additionally, the electrochemical bandgaps of both polymers were deduced to be 2.17 and 2.06 eV for PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, respectively. These values showed the same tendency as their optical bandgaps. These results suggested that the molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers could be further modulated via changing the position of side chains in the conjugated backbone. Fig. 3b shows the energy level diagram of both donor polymers and the NFA (IT-4F). The offsets between the HOMO/LUMO of the donor and the acceptor were calculated to be larger than 0.14/0.71 eV, which indicated that both donor polymers and IT-4F had matched energy levels to achieve efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer in PSCs.

Photovoltaic performances
Considering the deep HOMO levels of PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, we chose IT-4F (see chart 1) as an electron acceptor to evaluate their photovoltaic performances. PSC devices were fabricated using a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al. PSCs were optimized by changing the donor/acceptor weight ratios (w/w), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) volume ratios (v/v) and thermal annealing temperatures for the active layers (Tables S1–S6, ESI†). When the active layers did not use additives, the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based PSC showed the best PCE of 4.91% with a VOC of 0.96 V, JSC of 9.4 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 54.6%, while the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC gave the best PCE of 10.5% with a VOC 0.96 V, JSC of 17.9 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.4%. To the best of our knowledge, the VOC of 0.96 V in the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based device is one of the highest values for the IT-4F-based PSCs reported so far.39 After the addition of DIO into the active layer, the PCE of the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based PSC device improved to 6.2%, with a VOC 0.94 V, JSC of 11.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 59.0%, while the PCE of the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC increased to 12.4% with a VOC 0.92 V, JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.8%. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are displayed in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 2. Compared to the device parameters of both optimal PSCs, they had similar VOC. It should originate from their similar HOMO levels; however, the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based device had significantly high JSC and FF compared to the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based device. Considering that both polymers have different aggregation behaviours in solution and film, the different JSC and FF in both devices could be attributed to their different BHJ morphologies in active layers.

The large different JSC in both polymer-based devices can be confirmed by performing external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement as shown in Fig. 4b. They exhibited a similar wavelength range of 330–850 nm, but the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC had a remarkably high EQE compared to PBTz-1:IT-4F-based devices. The JSC values integrated from the EQE spectra were calculated to be 10.6 and 19.2 mA cm−2 for PBTz-1:IT-4F and PBTz-2:IT-4F-based devices, respectively, which fitted well with JSC acquired in the J–V measurements under 5% mismatch.
Charge generation, transport and recombination
To investigate the charge generation of both polymer-based PSCs, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff). The profiles of Jphversus Veff for both polymer-based PSCs are displayed in Fig. 5a. The photocurrent density (Jph) is calculated according to Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The effective voltage (Veff) is defined as the difference between the compensation voltage (V0, determined when the Jph is zero) and the applied voltage (V). Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density. Under the short-circuit conditions, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC (86.9%) was higher than that of the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based PSC (76.6%). This implied that more efficient exciton dissociation occurs in the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC. The charge carrier mobilities of the pure and blended films were evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements.40,41 As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S7 (ESI†), the PBTz-1 film exhibited a higher hole mobility (μh) of 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the PBTz-2 film (1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). After blending with IT-4F, the hole mobility of the PBTz-1:IT-4F film decreased to 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; at the same time, the electron mobility (μe) was obtained to be 3.9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole mobility of the PBTz-2:IT-4F film improved to 3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, a similar value of electron mobility was observed to be 2.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. More importantly, the PBTz-2:IT-4F film (μh/μe 1.1) exhibited more balanced electron and hole transport than the PBTz-1:IT-4F film (μh/μe 2.8). These results are in good agreement that the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based device had a high JSC and FF compared to the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based device.

To study the charge recombination mechanism in devices, we measured light intensity (Plight) dependent VOC and JSC in both optimal PSC devices.42,43 The slope of VOCvs. Plight is an intuitive method for distinguishing recombination dynamics, and the slopes of 2 kT/q and kT/q represent monomolecular and bimolecular recombination, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the VOC plotted with respect to Plight, which gave the slopes of 1.88 and 1.14 kT/q for PBTz-1:IT-4F and PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSCs, respectively. The result implied that the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based device tended to show monomolecular recombination, while monomolecular recombination is suppressed in the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based device. We also measured the JSCvs. Plight; the relationship of JSC and Plight can be described by the formula of JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where the exponential factor S represents the extent of the bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 5c, both polymer-based PSCs have the same slope of 0.94. The result implied that both polymer-based PSCs have weak trap recombination.
Morphologies of the blended films
To further understand the different JSC, FF, and charge carrier mobilities in both polymer-based devices, we firstly studied the organization of pure polymer and blended films by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements as shown in Fig. 6. In the out-of-plane direction, the PBTz-1 film shows (100) and (010) peaks with corresponding distances of 24.1 Å (0.26 Å−1) and 0.37 nm (1.69 Å−1), which are assigned to chain-to-chain and π–π distances, respectively, while the PBTz-2 film displays (100), (200) and (010) peaks with corresponding distances of 21.7 Å (0.29 Å−1), 9.97 Å (0.63 Å−1) and 0.37 nm (1.69 Å−1). Although both polymers have the same π stacking distance, the (010) peak of PBTz-1 is slightly sharper than that of PBTz-2. The corresponding crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of both polymers are calculated using the Scherrer equation.44 The CCL values of both polymers are 1.6 and 1.4 nm for PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, respectively. These results imply that PBTz-1 has a higher charge carrier mobility than PBTz-2. In the in-plane direction, both polymers do not show π–π stacking, but exhibit apparent lamellar (100) and (200); in particular, PBTz-2 shows a (300) peak. These results imply that PBTz-2 has stronger lamellar stacking than PBTz-1. After blending with IT-4F in the active layer, the PBTz-1:IT-4F film still exhibits clear (100) and (200) peaks in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions, but the (010) peak becomes very weak and broad in the out-of-plane direction, which is why the PBTz-1 blend film has a lower hole mobility than its pure films. In contrast, the PBTz-2:IT-4F film displays weaker and broader (100) and (200) peaks in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions compared to the pure PBTz-2 film, but the (010) peak becomes stronger with a shorter π–π distance of 0.36 nm (1.76 Å−1); thus, the PBTz-2 blended film has a higher hole mobility than its pure film. In brief, the PBTz-2:IT-4F film has strong face-on π stacking than the PBTz-1:IT-4F film, which is very important to achieve higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities, thus yielding a higher FF and PCE in the PBTz-2-based device.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were also carried out for the pure polymer and blend films to probe their surface morphologies as shown in Fig. 7. The AFM images of the pure PBTz-1 and PBTz-2 show similar uniform films with a root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.15 nm and 2.04 nm, respectively. In their blend films, the RMS of the PBTz-1:IT-4F film is significantly increased to 6.87 nm, while the RMS of the PBTz-2:IT-4F film is slightly increased to 3.10 nm. Compared to the PBTz-1:IT-4F film, the PBTz-2:IT-4F film exhibits a more favourable morphology for exciton transportation. In fact, polymer donors with strong aggregation usually show relatively low efficiencies in NF PSCs, due to the formation of the large domain sizes in BHJ morphologies.45–47 The poor morphology of the PBTz-1 T:IT-4F film is a major reason limiting their JSC and FF, thus yielding a low PCE.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported two TzTz-based WBG conjugated polymers, PBTz-1 and PBTz-2, with different substituent positions of long branched side chains. The side chain position has a weak influence on the optical bandgaps and electrochemical properties, but a strong influence on the aggregation behaviours in solution and crystallization properties in film. Both polymers have similar optical bandgaps and molecular energy levels. PBTz-1 with a pair of long branched side chain facing the BDT unit exhibits stronger aggregation properties in solution. Therefore, PBTz-1 shows strong crystallization in film and yields a high charge carrier mobility. PBTz-2 has a suitable temperature dependent aggregation property and gives a decent charge carrier mobility. After blending with IT-4F, the PBTz-1:IT-4F film exhibits weak π–π stacking and high crystallization, leading to a high RMS (6.87 nm) and an unfavourable BHJ morphology; the PBTz-2:IT-4F film shows an enhancement of π–π stacking and weakening of crystallization, leading to a low RMS (3.10 nm) and favourable BHJ morphology. Therefore, the PCE of the PBTz-1:IT-4F-based PSC is only 6.2%, while the PCE of the PBTz-2:IT-4F-based PSC is up to 12.4%. This work demonstrates that controlling the side chain positions on the conjugated backbone is critical in the future design and development of new donor polymers for highly efficient NF PSCs.
