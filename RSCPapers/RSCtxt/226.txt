Such a structural design and synthetic strategy may also be applied to explore other nanocomposites to improve the electrochemical performance.
Introduction
To satisfy the growing market of power sources in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles, high performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are greatly needed.1–6 Because the performance of LIBs is dominated by the electrode materials, commercial graphite with a low theoretical capacity cannot satisfy the need for next-generation LIBs.7 Therefore, exploring new anode candidates with high capacity and good cycle stability is crucial.
Among these candidates, transition metal selenides (TMS) are studied as important members of high-power anodes of LIBs due to their high theoretical capacity, and high electronic conductivity combined with low energy consumption during the electrochemical reaction process.8–14 Unfortunately, serious volume change resulting in poor cycle stability still remains in these electrode materials. Thus, many strategies such as tuning the particle morphology,15,16 construction of TMS with conductive matrixes (carbon,10,12,17,18 graphene,19–21 and carbon nanotubes22,23) and hybridization with other composites24–26 are usually adopted improve the performance of TMS materials. Especially, hybridization with other composites is considered as the most promising procedure, which leads to enhanced cyclabilities, rate capabilities and thermal stabilities.27,28 As a TMS, copper selenide has been studied for high performance solar cells and anodes for lithium and sodium batteries.29–32 However, the drastic volume expansion/contraction during cycling severely prohibits its practical application. To alleviate these issues, Cu2−xSe nanosheets,33 nanorods,14 hierarchical Cu2−xSe,29 CNT@C@Cu2−xSe,34 and Cu2−xSe@C@MoSe2 nanosheets35 have been fabricated to improve the performance. However, the specific capacity and cycle stability are still unsatisfactory.
As an important selenide, 1 mol of Sb2Se3 can react with 12 moles of Li+, resulting in a high theoretical capacity.36,37 Unfortunately, high volume change and poor electronic conductivity lead to sluggish kinetics and limited cycling performance. As a consequence, some conductive substrates such as graphene, amorphous carbon and poly pyrrole are applied to improve the electronic conductivity and enhance the electrochemical performance.36–40 In this work, conductive Cu2−xSe is expected to increase the electronic conductivity of Sb2Se3 and the synergistic effect between the two components can enhance the electrochemical performance. Herein, Sb2Se3 nanoparticles deposited on Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets (Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3) were designed and fabricated by two facile solvothermal processes. The obtained architecture can not only enhance the migration rate of Li+, but also buffer the volume variation and prohibit the aggregation of the nanosheets during the charge and discharge process. Benefiting from these advantages, the obtained Cu2−xSe@C@ Sb2Se3 electrode manifests good cycle stability and rate capacity. When cycled at a current density of 100 mA g−1, a specific capacity of 341 mA h g−1 can be achieved after 100 cycles. Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 delivers a reversible capacity of 153 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets. All the reagents were purchased and used without further purification. And the Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets were fabricated by a one step solvothermal procedure. In the typical process, 0.2 g of copper acetate monohydrate, 0.1 g of sodium selenite and 1.0 g of glucose were dissolved in 18 mL of mixed solution containing 3 mL of distilled water and 15 mL of isopropanol under magnetic stirring. The mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon autoclave and then 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate (80%) was dropped into the reaction system. After solvothermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h, the Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets were collected and washed with distilled water several times.
Synthesis of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 nanohybrids. 0.1 g of the Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets were dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water and 10 mL of 1,2-propanediol. 0.133 g of antimony potassium tartrate, 0.1 g of sodium selenite and 0.3 g of glucose were added into the above solution in turn. After being stirred for 15 min, 1 mL of hydrazine hydrate (80%) was introduced and the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled naturally and the precipitates were collected and dried under a vacuum at 80 °C overnight.
Material characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies of the samples were detected using a FEI Quanta 200F field emission scanning electron microscope and FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin transmission electron microscope. XPS spectra were taken on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi+ X-ray microprobe. The exact composition of the sample was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma (ICP, NexION 300). The electronic conductivity of the sample was measured by the standard four probe method at room temperature.
Electrochemical measurements. CR2025-type cells were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance. To fabricate the working electrode, the active material, carbon black and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 70:15:15 were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and stirred for 8 h at room temperature. The obtained slurry was pasted on clean copper foil and dried under a vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. Then the current collector was cut into a 14 mm disc with a mass loading of ∼1 mg cm−2. The cells were assembled in a glove box filled with ultrahigh purity argon. Pure lithium foil and a Celgard 2400 membrane served as the counter/reference electrode and separator, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3.0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using the same electrochemical workstation in a frequency range of 100 kHz–10 mHz. And the potential was set to be 1.0 V. The galvanostatic charge/discharge behaviors of the electrodes were investigated on a NEWARE battery test system in a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V.
Results and discussion
The synthesis procedure of the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 nanohybrids is shown in Fig. 1. Cu2−xSe@C is fabricated by a solvothermal method using glucose as a surfactant and carbon source, which can be determined by the corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. 2). According to the full width at half maximum, the average grain size of Cu2−xSe@C calculated by the Scherrer equation is ∼41.5 nm. Subsequently, the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 nanohybrids are prepared by using Cu2−xSe@C as a template. As expected, some diffraction peaks assigned to orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS: 15-0861) can be observed except cubic Cu2−xSe (JCPDS: 06-0680). The size and shape of the synthesized sample are characterized by SEM. The SEM images in Fig. 3a and b show a Cu2−xSe@C sheet like structure with a smooth surface and the thickness of the sheet is 50–100 nm. The TEM image in Fig. 3c further confirms the sheet like structure of Cu2−xSe@C. The HRTEM image presents clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.338 nm, which matches well with the (111) plane of Cu2−xSe. Furthermore, a thin layer of amorphous carbon can be observed on the surface of the Cu2−xSe nanosheets. After deposition of Sb2Se3, the surface becomes coarse and the morphology has little change (Fig. 4a and b). From the TEM images of Fig. 4c and d, many light-colored areas appear on the surface of the nanosheets, implying the existence of holes between Sb2Se3 nanoparticles. The lattice spacing of 0.316 and 0.515 nm in the HRTEM images corresponds to the (211) and (120) interplanar distance of Sb2Se3, respectively (Fig. 4e and f). Interestingly, some amorphous region between discernible lattice fringes can be clearly observed, further proving that the separated Sb2Se3 nanoparticles are anchored on Cu2−xSe@C. Such separated nanoparticles increase the contact area between Sb2Se3 and the electrolyte during the lithiation/delithiation process. Fig. 4g shows the elemental mapping of the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 nanosheets, in which Cu, Sb, Se and C are homogeneously distributed in the whole nanosheets. The exact ratio of Cu, Sb and Se in Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 is detected by ICP analysis, which is close to 1.0:0.424:1.141. For Cu2−xSe@C, the ratio of Cu and Se is 1.0:0.508.

The composition and surface state of the samples are measured through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the survey spectrum, the characteristic peaks of Cu2p, Sb3d, Se3d, C1s and O1s are detected (Fig. 5a and b). Fig. 5c displays the C1s spectrum of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3; the four characteristic peaks at 282.8, 284.1, 285.7 and 287.7 eV correspond to C–C, CC, C–OH and OC–OH bonds, respectively.41,42 The C–OH and OC–OH functional groups of amorphous carbon will strongly coordinate with Sb3+ cations and promote the growth of Sb2Se3 on the surface of Cu2−xSe@C. Furthermore, Sb2Se3 can be tightly anchored and the exfoliation of Sb2Se3 from the surface of Cu2−xSe@C will be alleviated due to the strong coordination effect between Sb3+ and the functional groups. From the Cu2p spectrum (Fig. 5d), the peaks appearing at 931.0 and 950.9 eV can be indexed to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively.43 The high-resolution spectrum of Sb3d and O1s (Fig. 5e) shows that the binding energies at 528.8 eV and 530.4 eV are related to Sb3d5/2 for Sb III and V, and the peaks at 537.9 eV and 539.1 eV can be assigned to Sb3d3/2.36,44 The peak at around 529.8 eV can be indexed to O1s. As for the Se3d spectrum (Fig. 5f), the binding energies located at 52.4 and 53.3 eV are ascribed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively.36,45

The electrochemical performance of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 and Cu2−xSe@C is evaluated through the use of CR2025 cointype cells. Fig. 6a displays the first three cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 with a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V. In the first cathodic process, the wide reduction peaks of 1.71–1.22 V are attributed to the Li+ insertion into Cu2−xSe and then conversion into Cu2Se.14,29,35 The reduction peak at 1.12 V can be ascribed to the reduction of Cu2Se to Cu and Li2Se.29 It should be pointed out that the peaks positions of formation of LixSb2Se3 and the reduction of LixSb2Se3 into Sb and Li2Se are closed to that of the transformation of Cu2−xSe to Cu. As a result, no additional peaks can be observed. Observing carefully, the tiny peak at about 0.8 V corresponds to the conversion of Sb into Li3Sb.46,47 In the subsequent oxidation process, the peak located at 1.19 V is related to the dealloying process of Li3Sb.48,49 And another two peaks at 1.90 and 2.23 V are ascribed to the conversion reaction process of Sb to Sb2Se3/or transformation of the metallic Cu to Cu2Se and then to CuSe, respectively.35,46 In the second and third cycles, the reduction peaks shift to high potentials of 1.42 and 2.01 V. For comparison, the CV curves of Cu2−xSe@C are evaluated and presented in Fig. 6b. Three reduction peaks at 1.87, 1.52 and 1.28 V can be observed, which are ascribed to the formation of LixCu2−xSe, Cu2Se and Cu, respectively. The peak at 0.59 V originates from the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. During the anodic scan, the peaks assigned to the oxidation of the metallic Cu to Cu2Se and then to CuSe appear at 1.98 and 2.30 V, respectively. It can be seen that the peak intensities and integral areas of the CV profiles decrease more sharply for Cu2−xSe@C, suggesting the poor cycle stability of the electrode.

(e) Cycle performance of the electrodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1. (f) Rate capacities of the electrodes from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. 
The galvanostatic Li+ intercalation/deintercalation curves of the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 and Cu2−xSe@C electrodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1 are presented in Fig. 6c and d, which is in accordance with the previous CV profiles. The initial discharge and charge capacities of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 are 851 and 650 mA h g−1, respectively, and an initial coulombic efficiency of 76.4% can be achieved. The large capacity loss of 201 mA h g−1 can be attributed to the formation of a SEI film. In contrast, the discharge and charge capacities of Cu2−xSe@C are 716 and 427 mA h g−1, respectively, resulting in the first cycle efficiency of 59.6%. Such increased coulombic efficiency may be attributed to the increased reversibility and the synergistic effect of the two components. Fig. 6e displays the cycle performance of the electrodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Obviously, Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 exhibits the better cycle stability and a reversible capacity of 341 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. For the Cu2−xSe@C electrode and Cu2−xSe@Sb2Se3 (Cu2−xSe@C nanosheets and Sb2Se3 are mixed with a molar ratio of 1.0:0.424), only 98 mA h g−1 and 130 mA h g−1 can be maintained after 100 cycles, indicating that the existence of Sb2Se3 can significantly enhance the cycle stability. The rate performance of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 is further evaluated at various current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6f). Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 delivers specific capacities of 360, 305, 259, 201, and 153 mA h g−1, respectively, while Cu2−xSe@C exhibits discharge capacities of 194, 83, 51, 31 and 27 mA h g−1, respectively. In the presence of Sb2Se3 (Cu2−xSe@Sb2Se3), the discharge capacities are a little higher than those of Cu2−xSe@C (238, 118, 64, 54 and 35 mA h g−1) at the same current densities. When the current density returns back to 100 mA g−1, the reversible capacities of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3, Cu2−xSe@Sb2Se3 and Cu2−xSe@C recover to 315, 93 and 63 mA h g−1, respectively. The results indicate that the synergistic effect of Cu2−xSe and Sb2Se3 can effectively enhance the electrochemical performance. In this work, Cu2−xSe@C with a high electronic conductivity of 102 S cm−1 can serve as a conductive substrate to facilitate electron and charge transfer, which leads to the excellent high-rate capability. From another point of view, the high theoretical capacity of Sb2Se3 will increase the specific capacity of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3. In addition, the amorphous carbon layer between Cu2−xSe and Sb2Se3 can accommodate the volume change and the strong coordination effect between Sb3+ and the functional groups maintains the integrity of the electrode during cycling, which can be ascertained by the SEM images of the electrodes after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 7a and b).

To further investigate the excellent electrochemical performance of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. As displayed in Fig. 8a, the Nyquist plots of the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 and Cu2−xSe@C electrodes possess similar shapes with a straight line in the low-frequency region and a semicircle in the high frequency region. To better understand the impedance spectrum, the EIS spectra are fitted and the corresponding equivalent circuit model is presented in the inset of Fig. 8a, in which Re, Rf and Rct represent the sum of the electrolyte resistance and the ohmic resistance of the cell, the film resistance and the charge-transfer resistance, respectively. CPE-1, CPE-2 and Zw correspond to the constant phase element of the SEI film, the double-layer capacitance and the Warburg impedance, respectively. The fitting parameters of the electrodes are listed in Table 1. Clearly, Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 possesses a smaller Rct value that that of Cu2−xSe@C, indicating the enhanced reaction kinetics of the electrodes. Moreover, the large change of resistance of Cu2−xSe@C reflects the unstable redox reaction during cycling (Fig. 8c). As indicated in previous work, the Li+ diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the square root of the Warburg coefficient (σ), which is equal to the slope of the linear plot of Z′–ω−1/2. As shown in Fig. 8b and d, the slope of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 is much smaller than that of Cu2−xSe@C, which means a larger Li+ diffusion coefficient of Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3. As discussed above, the better electrochemical performance of the hybrids may be ascribed to the following beneficial factors. (1) The Sb2Se3 nanoparticles strongly anchored on Cu2−xSe@C offer sufficient contact between the electrode and electrolyte, inhibit aggregation and accommodate the volume change during cycling. (2) The synergistic effect of the two components and the amorphous carbon layer effectively facilitates the Li+ diffusion rate and lowers the resistance.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a facile synthesis strategy for constructing Sb2Se3 nanoparticles on Cu2−xSe@C with the assistance of glucose. The as-prepared Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 nanosheets can buffer the volume changes, facilitate electrolyte penetration and offer abundant active sites during the lithiation/delithiation process. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the two components and the amorphous carbon can enhance the electrical conductivity and improve the transfer efficiency of the electrons and ions. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the Cu2−xSe@C@Sb2Se3 hybrid delivers a specific capacity of 339 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. At a high rate of 2000 mA g−1, a reversible capacity of 153 mA h g−1 can be maintained.
