    , Accepted 5th November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractDue to their intrinsic properties of ultrahigh carrier mobility and large absorption coefficients, inorganic halide perovskites (IHPs) have gained significant attention recently and have become one of the most competitive and promising candidates for optoelectronic devices. However, owing to large quantities of trap states on surfaces and grain boundaries, solution self-assembly IHP films suffer from low carrier-extraction and transport efficiencies. Therefore, in this paper, bilayer heterostructure photodetectors Au/[CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3]/Au, in which bipolar carrier transporting channels were built, are firstly presented. Under 72.1 μW cm−2 405 nm illumination at 10 V, for the photodetector Au/[CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3]/Au with an optimal precursor molar ratio (CsBr to PbBr2) of 1:1.2, an external quantum efficiency of 2304% with a responsivity of 7.53 A W−1 was obtained. Moreover, an enhanced ON/OFF ratio of >8 × 103 with a high specific detectivity of 5.22 × 1013 Jones was also achieved. Therefore, such an approach of combining a bilayer heterostructure and bipolar transporting channels into one device provides a fairly promising method for high-performance all-inorganic perovskite-based photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Due to their excellent features such as large optical absorption coefficients, facile solution-processable implementation, high charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length and high photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies, metal halide perovskites have attracted great attention in recent years,1–7 which greatly stimulated the interest of researchers to develop perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors (PDs).8–15 However, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are extremely sensitive to ambient temperature and humidity due to the existence of volatile organic constituents, thus severely hampering their practical applications in industry.16 To settle this intractable problem, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites (IHPs) CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have been developed, exhibiting high stability and charge carrier mobility (4500 cm2 V−1 s−1)4 and larger absorption coefficient (∼2 × 1015 cm−1)2 compared with that of their hybrid counterparts.17 Therefore, CsPbBr3 is a pretty ideal and promising material for PD applications. Song et al.18 reported a flexible CsPbBr3 nanosheet based PD, showing excellent stability even after 10000 cycles of bending and recovering procedures. Li et al.19 reported a CsPbBr3 thin film PD with an ultrahigh EQE of 16700% along with a high ON/OFF ratio of 1.06 × 105. Nevertheless, currently the device performance of all-inorganic perovskite PDs is still worse than those of their hybrid counterparts due to the poor quality of solution-processed polycrystalline films.20,21 One essential reason for poor film quality is the much lower solubility of CsBr than PbBr2 in aprotic solvents, which leads to insufficient raw materials during the process of film formation, making the film morphology discontinuous.22 During solvent evaporation, CsBr precipitates rapidly and it serves as growth seeds, forming many small-scale crystals.23 It greatly aggravates the formation of voids and induces large quantities of grain boundaries. These grain boundaries and discontinuous film morphology severely diminish carrier mobility and significantly increase the carrier recombination probability, resulting in poor device performance.24 Hence, high-quality CsPbBr3 polycrystalline film with low defect density and high carrier mobility is an efficient pathway for high-performance PDs. Moreover, another effective approach to enhance PD performance is to integrate the CsPbBr3 layer with other functional materials, namely to build a bilayer heterostructure for PDs.25,26 Till now, perovskite layers combined with several types of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene,27 MoS2,28 WS229 and WSe230 have been reported. However, for transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, a high responsivity can only be acquired under a high bias since the conductivity of the atomic TMD monolayer is very low. For materials with high-conductivity such as graphene, the dark current of hybrid devices is excessively high, resulting in a low ON/OFF current ratio. Besides, rigorous conditions to prepare 2D materials undoubtedly increase the complexity of their fabrication processes. Due to the high mobility of holes, excellent hole-extraction ability and good alignment with perovskites, wide bandgap MoO3 is frequently applied for perovskite solar cells.31–33 Therefore, MoO3 could be an ideal underlayer to be integrated with perovskites for high-performance perovskite/MoO3 heterostructure based PDs. Also, owing to the high mobility of electrons, solution-processability and favorable dispersibility in aprotic solvents, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) can be employed as additives to effectively passivate the perovskite during its crystallization process, and thereby a smooth and compact thin film morphology can be obtained. In this way, perovskite film with a better surface coverage can be obtained, and thereby the stability of perovskite-based PDs can be enhanced.34
Therefore, in this work, colloidal ZnO NPs were used as additives to improve the quality of crystalline CsPbBr3 film and to extract electrons photogenerated in the perovskite layer, and the MoO3 layer was employed as an underlayer to form a CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 bilayer configuration. In this way, the construction of bipolar carrier transporting channels in PDs contributes to efficient charge carrier transport and extraction, endowing PDs with high performance. As expected, all the figures of merit of PDs had been remarkably enhanced after introducing ZnO NPs and the MoO3 layer simultaneously. Thus, this work provides a general strategy for high-performance perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of ZnO NPs
In our experiments, ZnO NPs were synthesized by a sol–gel method according to reported procedures35,36 with little modification. The solution of zinc precursor was prepared by dissolving 3 mmol zinc acetate hydrate in 30 mL of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, 10 mL of a solution of TMAH in ethanol (7.5 mmol) was added drop-wise into the zinc precursor in 10 min under continuous magnetic stirring. The vigorous stirring was continued for 1 h at room temperature, and then the milk-white ZnO NPs were precipitated by adding an excess of ethyl acetate. The as-made ZnO NPs were washed at least 3 times with ethyl acetate and re-dispersed in DMSO to form 0.4 M colloidal solution for further use.
All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin and were used directly without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid precursor solution
CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsBr and PbBr2 in ZnO colloidal solution at different molar ratios (i.e. 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1, 1:1.2 and 1:1.4). It is worth mentioning that the molar ratio of PbBr2:ZnO remained at 1:1 for all solutions. After stirring for 2 h at 70 °C, the transparent solutions were acquired by filtration. The pristine CsPbBr3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsBr with PbBr2 in DMSO at 1:1 molar ratio, followed by the same procedures as above.
2.3 Device fabrication

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the main processing procedures of the CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure photodetector. Firstly, the glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath by using a neutral detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min sequentially, followed by ozone treatment in an UV-ozone cleaner for 10 min (Fig. 1a). Then, these glass substrates were transferred into the evaporation chamber, 100 nm of MoO3 was deposited at a rate of 1 Å s−1 under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa (Fig. 1b), and subsequently, a 70 nm Au interdigital electrode was thermally evaporated under the same vacuum condition via shadow mask defining the channel width of 85 μm and channel length of 956 μm (see Fig. 1c). Afterward, the as-prepared hybrid precursor solutions at various ratios were spin-coated on samples at 2000 rpm for 60 s (see Fig. 1d). Finally, after DMSO volatilization, the samples were annealed at 70 °C for 30 min on a hot plate (see Fig. 1e). Fig. 1f shows the schematic diagram of the photodetector Au/[CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3]/Au.

2.4 Characterization
The absorption properties of nanomaterials and films were measured using a Shimadzu 3600 UV-vis spectrophotometer. PL spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4600). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were characterized using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a ZEISS Sigma 500 field emission SEM. The electrical and optoelectrical characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization system. A 405 nm laser diode was employed as the light source in the measurements. All the characterization was performed at room temperature under ambient air.
3. Results and discussion
XRD patterns of the pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid films are shown in Fig. 2a. From here, one can see four characteristic peaks of the pristine CsPbBr3 film at 15.18°, 21.56°, 30.58° and 43.72°, which correspond to the crystal planes of (001), (010), (210) and (020), respectively, showing a typical orthorhombic structure of CsPbBr3 (PDF#54-0751).22,37 For the hybrid film, apart from peaks corresponding to CsPbBr3, four extra characteristic peaks at 34.44°, 36.38°, 47.56° and 56.66° can be observed, and they can be readily indexed to the crystal planes of (002), (101), (102) and (110) for ZnO (PDF#36-1451).38,39 Moreover, XRD patterns of CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid films with different precursor ratios (K = MCsBr/MPbBr2 = 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1, 1:1.2, 1:1.4) are also shown here, confirming the crystallization of CsPbBr3 in hybrid film, and showing that the orientation growth of CsPbBr3 was not influenced after introducing ZnO NPs, and that the ZnO NPs are stable during the crystallization process. The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of ZnO NPs are shown in Fig. 2c. It is clearly observed that the peak position of absorption and PL locate at 325 nm and 514 nm, respectively, which is consistent with the previous report.40Fig. 2d depicts the absorption spectrum of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film and CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure film. Obviously, there is no difference between CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film, indicating that the introduction of ZnO NPs didn’t affect the absorption characteristics of CsPbBr3. Furthermore, the MoO3 underlayer has little effect on the absorption properties of heterostructure films because the MoO3 bulk material has fairly weak absorption in the visible region. Therefore, their absorption spectra are almost the same.

The steady PL spectra of the CsPbBr3 film, CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film and CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure film are depicted in Fig. 3a. These three samples all display a peak at 533.2 nm without any shift. It is noted that the maximum PL intensity of the CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure film is the weakest one, which is quenched by nearly 30% with respect to that of the CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film and by nearly 50% with regard to that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film. Such a great PL quenching is ascribed to the efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to ZnO NPs and the MoO3 layer, in addition to the effective exciton dissociation which suppresses the recombination of photo-generated carriers.27,29,41 The process of charge carrier extraction and transfer can also be proved by the time-resolved spectra of these three samples, as shown in Fig. 3b. The average lifetime of the CsPbBr3 film, CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film and CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure film is 7.44, 4.68 and 1.81 ns, respectively. The decreased lifetime indicates the efficient extraction and transport of the excited charge carriers. Fig. 3c shows the (Ahν)2 ∼ hν curve of colloidal ZnO NPs, and its inset shows the (Ahν)2 ∼ hν curve of CsPbBr3. From here, the bandgap of ZnO NPs can be figured out as 3.6 eV, which is higher than that of the bulk material (3.2–3.3 eV),42 exhibiting a strong quantum confinement effect. Moreover, the bandgap of CsPbBr3 (i.e. 2.26 eV) is not affected by ZnO additives and the MoO3 layer, as shown in the inset, and this is in good agreement with reported literature.22,43 In order to get a deep understanding of the CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure PD, the energy band of each layer is presented in Fig. 3d. As one can see, here inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 is employed as the light absorber, ZnO NPs as passivating agents and the electron-transporting channels in the perovskite layer, and MoO3 as the hole-transporting channel at the CsPbBr3/MoO3 interface. Therefore, there exist three hetero-interfaces for this configuration, i.e. ZnO/MoO3, perovkskite/ZnO and perovskite/MoO3. Under 405 nm illumination, only the perovskites can absorb the incident light and then generate electron–hole pairs, and other components make no contribution to light harvesting. For pristine perovskite based PDs, these photo-generated electron–hole pairs recombine rapidly, resulting in great loss of photocurrent, and the device performance is hampered. After introducing the ZnO NPs in the perovskite matrix to form a hybrid layer, the photo-generated electrons in the CsPbBr3 layer could transfer to ZnO quickly via the perovskite/ZnO interface, while the photo-generated holes would be trapped in the perovskite, relieving the severe charge carrier recombination. For the hybrid layer, however, the transporting processes of electrons and holes occur simultaneously in the same layer, and a certain degree of recombination loss is always unavoidable. Hence, we employ MoO3 as the underlayer to form a bilayer heterostructure, and as a result, the introduction of the perovskite/MoO3 interface improves the hole extraction and separates the transport routes of electrons from those of holes, alleviating such a loss to a certain degree. In this way, the lifetime of charge carriers could be prolonged as much as possible. It is worth noting that the existence of the ZnO/MoO3 interface made no improvement in the recombination loss. Although a slight increment of dark current is induced after introducing new interfaces in the PD, the photoresponse of the device still can be enhanced significantly.

As we know, the surface morphology and the quality of thin film directly determine its conductivity and play a critical role in device performance. Hence, fabricating a compact, uniform and smooth perovskite film is a direct and effective pathway to improve the performance of CsPbBr3-based PDs. Fig. 4 exhibits the SEM images of the MoO3 film, pristine CsPbBr3 film and CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film with different perovskite precursor molar ratios. The fabricating procedure of MoO3 film is mature and it is easy to get a film with smooth and dense morphology (see Fig. 4a). Firstly, the influence of introducing ZnO NPs on the perovskite film morphology is investigated. For the pristine CsPbBr3 film (K = 1:1), there exist many isolated cubic grains on the underlying surface and it displays a very poor coverage (see Fig. 4b). These grains form as a result of the growth of larger grains at the cost of smaller grains due to their reduced surface energy, which could be attributed to Ostwald ripening.19 After introducing ZnO NPs but without changing other conditions, the surface coverage of the hybrid film (K = 1:1) is markedly improved (see Fig. 4c). Due to their great dispersivity in the perovskite precursor, ZnO NPs possess a fairly uniform distribution in the hybrid film which could fill the gaps between the isolated CsPbBr3 grains and connect them together. In this way, lots of surface traps could be passivated and the originally lumpy morphology could be improved, which is favorable for efficient charge carrier extraction and transport. However, the intrinsic defect density at grain boundaries is still clearly observed and a large portion of the device surface is not covered by the perovskite, hampering the efficient charge transport and increasing the recombination loss.

Afterwards, the influence of different perovskite precursor molar ratios on the morphology of the hybrid film is studied. Hybrid films with different K (K = 1:0.6; 1:0.8; 1:1.2; 1:1.4) are fabricated, and their corresponding SEM images are displayed in Fig. 4d–g. For the cases of excess CsBr (see Fig. 4d and e), one can see that the connected islands are preliminarily formed even if ZnO NPs exist in the films, and a significant part of the surface is exposed without coverage. It is easily observed that the surface coverage of the hybrid film increases with the PbBr2 ratio. When K is increased to 1:1.2 (see Fig. 4f), the film pinholes and gaps are substantially reduced, showing a uniform and dense morphology, and it should be favorable for high device performance. On further increasing K to 1:1.4 (see Fig. 4g), the film coverage doesn’t change obviously but the morphology appears somewhat rough. On the other hand, less CsBr in the PbBr2-rich precursor couldn’t supply sufficient nucleation centers for the crystallization of CsPbBr3, and thus a certain amount of PbBr2 would precipitate on the surface to form the CsPb2Br5 impurity phase, which could be proved by the characteristic peaks of 11.64° and 29.36° displayed in Fig. 2b. However, the formation of the CsPb2Br5 impurity phase would hamper the carrier transporting properties and the quality of the films. In conclusion, with the help of ZnO NPs, an appropriate excess of PbBr2 in the perovskite precursor favors the formation of CsPbBr3 film, and a better morphology can be obtained.
Afterwards, the comprehensive device performance was characterized under 72.1 μW cm−2 405 nm illumination at 10 V. The currents of PDs with the same K (K = 1:1) based on the pristine CsPbBr3 (device A), CsPbBr3:ZnO hybrid film (device B) and CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 bilayer (device C) are shown in Fig. 5a. Obviously, the dark current slightly increases from 4.8 nA to 5.5 nA after introducing ZnO NPs, and it increases from 5.5 nA to 10.7 nA after employing the MoO3 layer. Meanwhile, the photocurrent significantly increases from 0.27 μA to 3.3 μA and then to 43 μA. It is worth noting that the ON/OFF current ratio of device C is two orders of magnitude higher than that of device A. The poor photoresponse of device A indicated that there exist so much trap states in the fabricated film that the charge carriers recombine quickly after their generation. However, the photocurrent is greatly enhanced after introducing ZnO NPs and the MoO3 layer, which could be attributed to the effective charge transfer and extraction at the CsPbBr3/ZnO and CsPbBr3/MoO3 interfaces, respectively. The improved film quality and charge dissociation enhance the PD performance. The responsivity, EQE and D* of the PDs were evaluated according to the following equations:44 (1) (2) (3)where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, Popt is the incident light intensity, A is the effective photosensitive area, h is the Planck's constant, c is the light speed and λ is the wavelength of the incident light. Based on eqn (1) and (2), both the responsivity and EQE of the PD are ∼160-fold that of the reference device, as shown in Fig. 5b. The calculated detectivity D* increases from 2.62 × 1011 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) to 2.80 × 1013 Jones, exhibiting a significant enhancement.

As discussed above, CsBr has relatively low solubility than PbBr2 in aprotic solvents, and it can be precipitated faster during the crystallization process; in this way, it dominates the growth behavior of the CsPbBr3 film. Therefore, it is critical and necessary to explore the optimal CsBr ratio in the precursor solution under the condition of introducing ZnO NPs, which could result in a film with larger grain size and less grain boundaries. Precursors with different molar ratios of CsBr to PbBr2 (i.e. K = 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1, 1:1.2 and 1:1.4) are investigated to optimize the CsBr concentration for device C. The dark current and photocurrent of the PDs with different precursor ratios are shown in Fig. 6. For K = 1:0.6, the largest dark current and the least photocurrent are attained, which are 19.4 nA and 13.3 μA respectively, exhibiting the lowest ON/OFF ratio of 685. The poor photoresponse attributed to the exorbitant CsBr would create high surface defect density, which is resulted from lots of isolated grains. With the increase of the PbBr2 ratio in precursor solution, the dark currents of the corresponding devices decrease and the photocurrents increase, indicating the improvement of film morphology and device performance. Obviously, when K = 1:1.2, the least dark current and the largest photocurrent are obtained, which are 8.6 nA and 72.7 μA respectively, and its ON/OFF ratio is 13-fold that of the PD with K = 1:0.6. But for K = 1:1.4, the device performance decreases, and the reason is that the excess PbBr2 remained at the grain boundaries and the film surfaces can form the CsPb2Br5 impurity phase after the crystallization process, which severely hampers the charge carrier transport.

The comprehensive PD performances with different precursor ratios are shown in Table 1. Obviously, all these EQEs exceed 100%, suggesting the occurrence of photomultiplication. For a photoconductive detector, a gain is acquired when a photon-generated charge carrier can travel through the external circuit multiple times before its recombination; in this case, the charge recombination lifetime is longer than its transit time (i.e. the drift time for charges to travel from one electrode to the opposite one under the applied field).45 In our experiments, we found that the EQE of PDs strongly depends on the PbBr2/CsBr molar ratio. The introduction of ZnO NPs can passivate most of electrons’ trap states; thus there exists a big difference between the charge collection ability for holes and electrons in the perovskite film. For the optimized PbBr2-richer precursor (K = 1:1.2), it could provide an appropriate quantity of Pb2+ cations which work as hole trap states to capture photo-generated holes in the film,45 and those trapped holes close to Au electrodes act as space charges to induce interfacial band bending, leading to efficient electron tunneling injection from the external circuit under illumination, resulting in maximum EQE, and such a kind of phenomena have been reported in organic photodetectors.46,47 Clearly, one can see that all the best figures of merit are obtained for K = 1:1.2 (i.e. the optimal ratio for device C). At a bias of 10 V, the ON/OFF ratio reaches 8453 under 72.1 μW cm−2 405 nm illumination with an EQE of 2304%, a responsivity of 7.53 A W−1 and a specific detectivity (D*) of 5.22 × 1013 Jones. The device temporal response is measured under different biases for 5 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7a, showing desirable reversibility and stability.

(c) I–T curves of the device for 5 cycles at 2 V under 72.1 μW cm−2 405 nm illumination, and the last 5 cycles correspond to the photoresponse after storing for 4 weeks in ambient air. 
Moreover, the response time of the devices is also measured. The rising time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% of the maximum photocurrent, and conversely, the time required for the photocurrent to drop from 90% to 10% is defined as the decaying time. The rising and decaying time of the optimized CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 heterostructure PD are 0.95 ms and 1.74 ms, respectively, at 2 V under 72.1 μW cm−2 405 nm illumination. Moreover, to satisfy the practical requirements of detecting incident light with diverse intensity, a wide linear dynamic range (LDR) is demanded which can be calculated by the following equation: (4)where L is the input light intensity, with the upper and lower limit currents defined by the linear results. As shown in Fig. 7b, the satisfied light intensity of the device ranges from 4.26 × 10−4 to 7.07 mW cm−2, exhibiting a LDR > 84 dB. We ascribe such a high LDR to the excellent quality of the fabricated perovskite absorber, which possesses wonderful light absorption and photoelectric conversion capability.
Also, the I–T curves of the same PD after storing for 4 weeks in ambient air are shown in Fig. 7c; the maximum photocurrent is slightly reduced from 8.73 μA to 8.47 μA, and the device could still maintain 97% of its original performance, implying a remarkable stability of the device. This might be attributed to the combined action of intrinsic stability of CsPbBr3 as well as the introduction of ZnO NPs, which could provide the perovskite film with a better surface coverage. The above results persuasively demonstrate the excellent device performance and superior long-term stability of the device C, enabling its further practical applications. For PDs, actually, it is rather difficult to achieve high figures of merit simultaneously and a series of tradeoffs in all respects should be evaluated. Table 2 summarizes the device performances of CsPbBr3-based photodetectors reported previously. From here, one can see that our CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3 bilayer heterostructure PDs show a better comprehensive performance. Thus, such an approach of combining a bilayer heterostructure and bipolar carrier transporting channels into one device can provide a promising method to build high-performance photodetectors.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed high-performance heterostructure PDs Au/[CsPbBr3:ZnO/MoO3]/Au via introducing ZnO NPs as additives in the perovskite active layer and MoO3 as an underlayer. Owing to the efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to ZnO and charge extraction from the perovskite to MoO3, the pathways of electrons and holes are separated, which could greatly suppress the recombination of charge carriers. In addition, ZnO NPs could passivate the film and improve its quality, contributing to highly efficient charge carrier transport. Herein, all figures of merit of the device have been improved significantly. The device with an optimized precursor molar ratio (K = 1:1.2) shows a maximum EQE of 2304% and a responsivity of 7.53 A W−1 at 10 V, and an ultrahigh ON/OFF current ratio of 8453 and a specific detectivity of 5.22 × 1013 Jones. Fast response speed (rising time and decaying time of 0.95 ms and 1.74 ms, respectively), wide detection range of light intensity (LDR > 84 dB) and excellent long-term stability are also obtained. Therefore, it provides a promising method to build high-performance photodetectors.
