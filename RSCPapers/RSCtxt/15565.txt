    , Accepted 29th September 2011First published on 26th October 2011AbstractDue to their high aspect ratio titania nanotubes have more surface area that enhances their ability towards harnessing light. Herein, we report on a template-assisted method to synthesize branched titania nanotubes anchored on a substrate. The branched structure consists of units of six or more tubes connected at their base; each tube has a dimension of approximately 6 μm long, 600 nm wide and 65 nm thick wall. Our approach takes advantage of hydrothermally processed branched ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays that act as sacrificial templates. After chemical dissolution of the ZnO film that inherently forms during ZnO–NR processing, the titania overlayer is coated atop of the template and annealed at 350 °C to produce the anatase nanostructure. Removal of the template under mild acidic conditions reveals the anatase tubes. The processes employed are well suited for large-scale application. The highly textured surface of the nanotubes also exhibits low reflectivity when compared to its thin film counterpart.
1. Introduction
Recently, numerous studies have indicated that titania nanotubes have improved properties compared to any other form of titania for application in photoelectrolysis,1,2 photocatalysis,3,4 sensing,5,6 and photo-voltaics.7,8 Typically titania nanotubes are fabricated via three main avenues (i) the template-assisted method,9,10 (ii) the electrochemical anodic oxidation method11 and (iii) the hydrothermal method.12,13 Each method has its own advantages and limitations. A reasonable control of the scale of the nanotubes can be achieved by the templating method, although the removal of the template can weaken the mechanical stability of the dense nanotube arrays. Anodic oxidation of titanium foils produces dense and aligned nanotube arrays with high aspect ratios. Nevertheless, mass production is limited as the nanotube formation requires low pH with fluoride containing electrolytes such as HF(aq) which increases health and environmental hazards and the cost of fabrication equipment. Furthermore, the TiO2 nanotubes prepared by anodization require annealing, at elevated temperatures such as 450 °C, to transform them from amorphous to anatase phase.14 Hydrothermal treatment offers a cost effective route towards large scale implementation15 which is modifiable producing well separated, low dimensional and crystallized nanotubes.
However, the long duration of its reactions, the requirement for high concentration of NaOH and the difficulty towards maintaining size uniformity are subjects of concern with the latter method.
A better degree of control of the nanotube–array architecture will impart tunable and functional properties, for example controlling the texture and surface area that in turn can enhance light absorption properties. Much effort has been invested in developing new anodizing procedures aimed at improving the nanotube length and structure.16 However, these dense arrays suffer from bundling17 and formation of precipitates18 that impede electron transport, thus there is a need for discrete architectures. Furthermore, branched architectures have been reported to offer more surface area, for charge separation, than one dimensional structures thereby improving efficiency of the photocatalyst.19,20 Only few reports in the literature report the fabrication of hierarchical arrays21 or Y-branched titania nanotubes22 which are suggested to have better electron transport properties than their 1D counterpart.
Herein, we report the generation of mechanically stable, on-substrate branched TiO2–anatase nanotubes that are microns long with nanometre wall-thickness, and possessing a high degree of porosity. The method encompasses the advantages of large scale implementation of the hydrothermal method, templating, on-substrate growth architecture akin to anodization while limiting their inherent disadvantages. We make use of a hydrothermally grown template of the ZnO branched nanorod structure which takes less time to grow than current methods. The titania nanostructure is formed by dip-coating our substrate into a TiO2 precursor solution. Titania as a photocatalyst relies on its potential to harness solar radiation, a sustainable and renewable energy vector, while maintaining a cost-effective procedure geared towards minimizing our carbon footprint during fabrication is highly sought-after.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), polyethyleneimine (PEI), titanium(IV)-isopropoxide (Ti-Is), acetylacetone, 99% (AcAc), and nitric acid, 69%, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Ethanol, 99.9% (EtOH), and ammonium hydroxide, 25% (NH4OH), were obtained from Merck Chemicals, Germany. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was supplied by Roth, Germany. PEG 400 was purchased from ABCR GmbH & Co KG, Germany. All chemicals were of analytical grade purity. All solutions were prepared with de-ionized water (≥18 MΩ cm).
2.2 Preparation of sol–gel, substrates and templates
Polymeric TiO2 sol–gel was prepared by firstly dissolving Ti-Is (3.56 ml) in EtOH (5 ml) for 5 min. This solution was added drop-wise to a pre-mixed solution of AcAc (0.58 ml) in EtOH (5 ml) and stirred further for 20 min. A pre-mixed solution containing EtOH (4.64 ml) and H2O (0.86 ml) was subsequently added to the above and stirred for 30 min. The light yellow solution was filtered using a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. To prevent cracking PEG 400 (0.02 g ml−1) was added to the filtrate (20 ml) and the polymeric sol was aged for 1 day in the fridge. The titania sol used to coat the template (Tipo) was prepared by hydrolyzing Ti-Is (1.33 ml) with H2O (3.23 ml) with nitric acid as catalyst. The reaction volume was adjusted to 30 ml with EtOH. It was then allowed to react for 45 min after which the sol was filtered using a 0.2 μm nylon syringe filter. The sol was kept at 8 °C and was stable over several months.
The preparation process is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Oxidized silicon wafer was used as substrates. The substrates were cleaned by a snow-jet cleaning process prior to use. Prior to ZnO–NR growth a 250 nm thin layer of TiO2 was processed by sequential spin-coating and subsequent annealing in a pre-heated furnace held at 350 °C for 20 min. ZnO–NRs were grown following the method described previously.23 The substrate was immersed in a flask containing 20 ml of the growth solution (aqueous solution of 12 mM HMTA, 5 mM PEI, 25 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 2.5 mM NH4OH). The covered flask was placed for 1 hour in an oil bath that was preheated to 82–85 °C. Subsequently the templated substrate was rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in air at 50 °C. A low concentration of HCl (1 × 10−3 M, pH = 3) was used to gently etch the underlying ZnO thin films away for 25 min with the solution held at room temperature. The surface was soaked in distilled water held at 40 °C for another 25 min to remove the ZnCl2 formed during etching. Dip coating (DC) was employed to coat the ZnO NR template with a thin TiO2 layer using Tipo sol at a rate of 4 mm s−1. Four sequential layers were needed to enrobe the ZnO NRs, the fourth DC layer was done at a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. After each dip-coating sequence, the films were annealed in a pre-heated furnace held at 350 °C for 10 min. The final annealing was done at the same temperature but for 20 min. The underlying ZnO structure is removed by etching it away with 0.03 M HCl at room temperature (RT) for 25 min and then soaked in water held at 40 °C for another 25 min.

In step (a) three layers of titania are spin coated atop of the oxidized silicon substrate, (b) branched ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) are hydrothermally grown for 1 h at 80 °C, (c) a gentle etching (1 mM HCl) is used to remove the underlying ZnO thin film also produced during step (b). In the last step (d) dip coating is employed to generate the titania overlayer and final removal of the template reveals the branched titania nanotubes. 
2.3 Characterization of the nano-structured surface
The nano-structured surface was characterized using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Ultra Plus, ZEISS, Germany). The samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X'Pert Pro, PANalytical, Holland) in Bragg–Brentano geometry using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.5418 Å and a scanning range of 20–90° 2θ. A Bruker Raman microscope was used to acquire spectra over a range of 70–700 cm−1, with a spectral resolution of 3–5 cm−1, using a backscattering configuration with a 20× objective excited with a 532 nm laser diode. Data were collected on numerous spots on the sample and recorded with a fully focused laser power of 20 mW. Each spectrum was accumulated four times with an integration time of 10 s. The Raman signal was recorded using a CCD camera. The silicon substrate Raman peak position (520 cm−1) was used to calibrate spectral frequency. UV-vis-NIR Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected with an Ocean Optics DH 2000 BAL with Spectralon as reference.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of the template

Fig. 2a shows the SEM micrographs of the branched ZnO–NR structure grown on a thin TiO2 layer supported on oxidized silicon. The individual rod can be described as a frustum of a hexagonal pyramid. They are ∼6 μm in height with a width of ∼600 nm at the top with an approximately 1 μm wide base, where the other branches are connected as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The branches have approximately the same length, which implies concurrent growth. The tapered structures, which consist of numerous stacked nanoplates with hexagonal prismatic faces, can be ascribed to a fast growth rate along the c-axis direction. The latter indicates the inherent anisotropic growth of ZnO is favored along the c-axis and the formation of edge dislocations during a relatively rapid growth can result in the tapered morphology.24,25 The branching observed seems to suggest a radiating growth mode from a common junction. The initially fast nucleation of ZnO nanocrystals and their coalescence (mimicking twinning) on the substrate can explain the formation of branched structures from star-like26 monocrystallite nanorods with incompletely grown crystal planes.27,28 Thereon, the Ostwald ripening process controls the homocentric growth along the c-axis direction as stacking becomes more energetically favorable.25

Fig. 3a shows the Raman spectra obtained on these ZnO NRs. The Raman peaks observed were at 101 cm−1, 144 cm−1, 197 cm−1, 303 cm−1, 397 cm−1, 439 cm−1, 521 cm−1 and 639 cm−1. To clarify our data; we also collected Raman spectra (Fig. 3b–e) on several other surfaces, containing at least one component, in order to validate our assignment. Fig. 3b depicts the spectra of TiO2 layer spin-coated on top of oxidized silicon. Anatase has a tetragonal structure with two TiO2 chemical units in the primitive cell. It belongs to the D194h; space group. Out of the 15 optical modes (1A1g + 1A2u + 2B1g + 1B2u + 3Eg + 2Eu) only the A1g, B1g along with Eg modes are Raman active while the A2u as well as Eu modes are infrared active whereas the B2u mode is both Raman and infrared inactive. We thus assign the peaks observed at 144 cm−1, 197 cm−1, 397 cm−1 and 639 cm−1 in Fig. 3b to the 2A1g, B1g, and Eg modes of anatase. ZnO has a wurtzite structure and belongs to the space group C46v; with two formula units per primitive cell. The predicted Raman active modes are A1 + E1 + 2E2. The two non-polar E2 modes are Raman active, while the A1 and E1 modes are both Raman and infrared active. The high-frequency E2H (439 cm−1) mode involves the vibration of oxygen (O) atoms, while the low-frequency E2L (101 cm−1) mode is associated with the vibration of the zinc (Zn) sublattice.29,30

The reported values corroborate well the peak observed in Fig. 3c for ZnO NRs grown on ZnO thin films (ZnO TFs) atop of oxidized silicon. By comparison to the ZnO NRs, the ZnO TFs, which is depicted in Fig. 3d, show much broader peaks at 101 cm−1 and 439 cm−1. The films are made by sequential spin-coating of the ZnO precursor onto oxidized silicon followed by an annealing step at 85 °C for 10 min. It has been reported in the literature31 that smaller particle size results in asymmetric broadening of the peaks. This implies that a higher intensity observed for the ZnO NR peaks correlates with a better crystallinity of the nanostructure, as substantiated by the SEM micrographs in Fig. 2a. The peak at 303 cm−1 and 521 cm−1 is ascribed to the silicon substrate.32 The subsequent gentle etching procedure, using 1 × 10−3 M HCl, allows elimination of the underlying ZnO TF that forms during the growth of the NRs, without dissolving the latter. This is a necessary step that ensures that the subsequently grown TiO2 will firmly adhere onto the substrate, thereby conferring the necessary mechanical stability to the TiO2 structure towards the final removal of the ZnO–NR template. Furthermore, it conveniently creates pits, as depicted in Fig. 2b, on the ZnO NRs that improve adhesion of the titania layer towards the formation of the branched titania nanotubes. The resulting Raman spectrum of the etched sample, as presented (in red) in Fig. 3e, shows a strong fluorescence. It is reasonable to presume that the presence of ZnCl2, formed by the reaction of HCl with ZnO, gives rise to this fluorescence. Once the substrate is washed, the ZnCl2 is readily dissolved in water and we recuperate a spectrum (orange in Fig. 3f) similar to that observed in Fig. 3a. We have found that the removal of the ZnO TF was a prerequisite to enhance the mechanical stability of the ensuing formation of the branched titania nanotubes.
3.2 Formation of the branched titania nanotubes
Dip-coating is employed to cover the ZnO NR template. The titania overcoat follows the same geometrical shape as its parent mold having a length of about 6 μm with an internal width of approximately 600 nm. The sample was pyrolized at 350 °C and a highly textured branched titania shell is formed over the template as shown in Fig. 4a. The ZnO template is etched away under mild acidic conditions to reveal the branched titania nanotubes, as seen in Fig. 4b. In order to achieve a mechanically stable nanostructure and prevent collapsing of the nanorods subsequent to ZnO etching a critical TiO2 layer/wall thickness has to be reached. In our case we empirically determined (see experimental conditions above) that a minimum wall thickness of approximately 65 nm was necessary for achieving self-standing, branched TiO2 nanostructures (see the inset of Fig. 4b). The nanotubes have a wall thickness of approximately 65 nm with a rough and porous surface that can be potentially useful towards improving the efficiency of the photoactive layer irrespective of its destined application. Our nanotubes have optimum length for certain application, such as dye sensitized solar cells. It has been suggested that efficient cells can be created with more than 4 μm thick TiO2 layers where the electron diffusion length is reported to be within the same magnitude.33
 Fig. 4  SEM micrographs and close-up view (inset) of the (a) titania coated ZnO NR template and (b) branched titania nanotubes. 
Raman spectra were collected on the substrate before (Fig. 5a) and after etching away the ZnO-template (Fig. 5b). The relatively prominent ZnO peaks at 101 cm−1 and 439 cm−1 still observed in Fig.5a are absent in Fig. 5b that solely shows the peaks corresponding to anatase nanotubes and Si substrate. To confirm that we have effectively removed the sacrificial ZnO template we also collected XRD data on both structures. Fig. 5c shows the XRD patterns collected on the ZnO (PDF 003-0888) coated with anatase. Several diffraction peaks are observed, with the (002) reflex being the most prominent, indicating the presence of a wurtzite ZnO structure. Upon removal of the ZnO template the resulting XRD (Fig. 5d) reveals only the anatase (PDF 001-0562) structure. The intense peak observed at ∼69° is attributed to the Si substrate. The absence of rutile structure was observed by the XRD, which is also corroborated by our Raman data.

3.3 Optical properties of the nanostructure
The energy loss due to reflection from the optical component reduces the up-conversion efficiency of the impinging radiation. ZnO nanostructures have been also sought as a potential photoactive material; however, TiO2 has so far provided better solar up-conversion efficiencies.34 Decreasing the amount of solar radiation reflected by a surface has been intensively investigated via the use of anti-reflective coating(s).35,36Fig. 6 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra measured at room temperature. The pale blue spectrum collected on the branched ZnO NR template exhibits an oscillatory structure. The oscillatory structure suggests an interference effect which is attributed to multiple reflection beams from the surface. A suppression of the interference and the reflectance is observed once the surface is coated with TiO2, as depicted by the dark green spectrum in Fig. 6. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the coated titania layer offers a porous surface that has been promulgated to lower the reflectivity of a surface.37 Upon removal of the sacrificial ZnO layer, a lower reflectance of <30% is observed (light green).
 Fig. 6  Diffuse reflectance spectra of ZnO NR template, titania coated atop of the ZnO NR template, branched titania nanotubes and spin-coated titania thin film on oxidized Si. 
This value is lower than the maximum reflectance of 50% and 35% observed (at λ = 400 nm) for the ZnO template and the titania coated template respectively. We have also compared the branched titania nanotubes with titania thin film made by spin-coating of TiO2 sol atop of oxidized Si. The spin-coated TiO2 film (red spectrum) shows a higher reflectance (∼50% at λ = 400 nm) with observable interference fringes due to multiple reflection beams from the surface. In contrast, the presence of branched titania nanotubes promotes lower reflectivity than its thin film counterpart, due to the so-called “Moth-eye” structure effects.38
4. Conclusions
Our results show that we can fabricate branched titania nanotubes. Albeit being an indirect route, the approach described takes considerably less time and less harsh conditions than direct hydrothermal routes to produce titania nanostructures. Following dip-coating a relatively lower annealing temperature of 350 °C is required as opposed to higher annealing temperature required by closely packed anodized titania nanotubes. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first report on an on-substrate branched architecture that could, based on literature data, promote 1D electron transport along the tubes axis but without the bundling effect that interferes with charge separation. This process is not limited to Si-substrates but can be expanded to other substrates. We are currently investigating the use of the zinc chloride by-product towards in situ generation of ZnS quantum dots for dye-sensitized solar cells.
