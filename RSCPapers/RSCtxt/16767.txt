1 Introduction
With interesting size and shape dependent photoluminescence (PL), a variety of research has been carried out on II–VI semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdS, CdSe, and CdTe. They display broad absorption, narrow emission, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) and excellent photostability. They have therefore become promising alternatives to organic chromophores in many applications as light absorbers or emitters, from photovoltaics and light emitting diodes to fluorescent probes for biological imaging.1–4 However, this kind of material has a fatal drawback of containing highly toxic components that severely restricts their possible applications.5,6 As an alternative, CuInS2 (CIS), a I–III–VI2 semiconductor with a bandgap of ∼1.45 eV, does not contain any toxic heavy metals and exhibits the significant quantum confinement effect.5 This material could therefore offer the opportunity to fulfill the potential of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) without the toxicity limitations encountered by II–VI QDs and provide PL emission ranging from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR).
Various synthetic methods to CuInS2 QDs have been reported; however, most of them involved the protective atmosphere (N2 or Ar) and relatively complex operation,7–17 and only one prepared water-soluble CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs in an electric pressure cooker under air atmosphere. The obtained QDs can be directly used in labeling liver cancer cells.18 The down-conversion effect of CIS/ZnS QDs in Si-based solar cells was also been confirmed by Gardelis et al. and an increase of 10.5% in conversion efficiency was realized, however, this marked increase was based on the relatively low initial efficiency (only 8%) of bare cell.19 In this report, we describe the synthesis of bright and photostable CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs with emission ranging from the red to NIR without any inert atmosphere protection via a simple one-pot microwave irradiation (Fig. 1). All the material solutions were loaded into a microwave system under the air atmosphere. The reaction time was reduced largely, and the whole experiment was completed after 40 min. As-prepared CIS/ZnS QDs possess not only a high PLQY (56%) but also a large Stokes shift. The optical properties can be easily tailored by controlling the reaction temperature, reaction time, and the Cu/In ratio. Especially, when they were first embedded into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) transparent matrix to form a composite film as a luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layer for Si solar cell, the conversion efficiency of the cell shows an improvement of 3.8% (from 15.60 to 16.21%) in compared to the one with pure glass on the top.

2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Indium(III) acetate (In(Ac)3, 99.99%), oleic acid (OA, 90%) and n-octadecene (ODE, 90%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Oleylamine (OAm, 70%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Copper(I) iodide (CuI, 98%), zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2, 99.5%), sulfur (S, 99.5%) powder and n-dodecylthiol (DDT, 98.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were used without any further purification.
2.2 Preparation of stock solutions
For the preparation of 0.1 mM Cu–DDT precursor solution. 2 mmol CuI was first loaded in a 35 mL reaction vessel with 20.0 mL DDT. The reaction mixture was then heated to 120 °C for 10 min by the microwave irradiation (Explorer-48, CEM Co.) in the air to yield a clear solution as Cu precursor.
For the preparation of 0.2 mM S–ODE precursor solution. 4 mmol sulfur powder was first loaded in a 35 mL microwave reaction vessel with 20.0 mL ODE. The reaction mixture was then heated to 160 °C for 10 min by microwave in the air to form a transparent solution as S precursor.
For the preparation of 0.4 mM Zn–OAm–ODE solution. 8 mmol Zn(Ac)2 and 6.0 mL of OAm was first loaded in a 35 mL microwave reaction vessel with 14.0 mL ODE. The reaction mixture was then heated to 160 °C for 10 min by microwave in the air to form a clear solution as Zn precursor.
2.3 Microwave-assisted synthesis of CIS and CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs
For a typical synthesis of CIS core QDs, shown in Fig. 1: 0.2 mmol of In(Ac)3, 1 mL Cu–DDT, 0.6 mL OA and 1 mL S–ODE were mixed with 3 mL ODE and 1.0 mL DDT in a 35 mL microwave reaction vessel which was heated to 190–240 °C for 30 s to 10 min by microwave in the air to allow the growth of CIS QDs. Then, it was quickly cooled to 60 °C in 2 min by the high-pressure air. CIS core QDs were obtained. For the synthesis of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs, 3 mL Zn–OAm–ODE stock solution was directly loaded into the as-prepared CIS core QDs solution without any intermediate purification, and subsequently, the mixture solution was heated to 230 °C for 10 min by microwave in the air to produce CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs. Finally, the resultant CIS core and CIS core/shell QDs were purified by the standard precipitation method using acetone as a precipitant, and re-dispersed in chloroform for further characterization and application. Additionally, in order to compare, CIS QDs were also synthesized under Ar protection atmosphere.
2.4 Preparation of QDs LDS layer for Si solar cells
In this paper, we used PMMA as a transparent matrix for encapsulating QDs. As-prepared CIS/ZnS QDs solution was added into the PMMA/CHCl3 sol and uniformly dispersed by ultrasonic concussion. The resultant suspension solution containing QDs was deposited on the slide glass substrate by a spin-coating method at a speed of 2000 rpm for 1 min, resulting in a thin film with homogeneous thickness. In this work, the composite films with various CIS/ZnS QDs concentrations from 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0 to 1.5 mg L−1 on glass were named as Sample 1 to Sample 5, respectively.
2.5 Characterization
The ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis) and PL spectra of as-synthesized QDs were obtained by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-3900) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, FluoroMax-4), respectively. PLQY was calculated by the following equation:20  where D, A, and n represents the optical density, integrated area of PL spectrum, and refractive index of QDs and dye, respectively. The optical densities at the first absorption peak of both sample and dye were kept at 0.05–0.1 for avoiding any significant reabsorption. Rhodamine 6G dissolved in ethanol (QY = 95.0%, λex = 480 nm) was used as a standard dye. The phase constitution was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, V = 40 kV, and I = 40 mA). The morphology and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were investigated by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010). The element compositions were measured by an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) on the TEM. The stability of the CIS/ZnS samples against photo-oxidation was carried out by the method reported in the literature.12 Briefly, the samples were placed into quartz cuvettes with half filled with air and continuously irradiated by a UV lamp of 365 nm (distance between lamp and sample: 25 cm, irradiation power at the sample surface: approximately 8 W). The photo-degradation was monitored by taking PL spectrum at certain time intervals. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurement of solar cells was performed with a Keithley model 2440 Source Meter and a Newport solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel) at one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The active area of solar cell was 4 cm2.
3 Results and discussion
Fig. 2a displays the typical UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of CIS core QDs synthesized in air atmosphere by the microwave irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, the absorption spectra of CIS QDs typically did not show well-defined exciton absorption peaks in the previous reports.16,17 The special electronic properties in comparison to II–VI semiconductor different nanocrystals, and the size/shape inhomogeneity of the ensemble are considered as three possible reasons. However, for CIS QDs presented in this report, a well-defined excitonic absorption peak centered at 499 nm is observed, which suggests the relatively uniform size/shape and composition distribution caused by the rapid and high-efficiency microwave heating. Under 499 nm excitation, a broad PL spectrum peaked at 640 nm is presented. Simultaneously, a large Stokes shift of 4415 cm−1 (548 meV) is accompanied. The value is too large to be attributed to a direct excitonic recombination because the Stokes shift is at most 100 meV for excitonic recombination.21 Thus, it can be concluded that a broad PL spectrum must come from the defect induced emission in these QDs, which is also consistent with the “donor–acceptor pair” model suggested by Krustok et al.22 as well as the “Shockley, Read, and Hall recombination” model reported by Hofhuis et al.23

The previous reports demonstrate that the presence of oxygen during the reaction did seriously harm to the formation and properties of CIS QDs and thus the experiments were carried out under N2/Ar protection atmosphere to keep away from oxygen.21 One of the innovation points of this paper is to synthesize CIS without any inert atmosphere protection via a simple one-pot microwave irradiation. In order to investigate the influence of reaction atmosphere on PL properties of as-prepared QDs, CIS was synthesized under air and Ar atmosphere, and the normalized spectra were shown in Fig. 2b. It can be observed that the absorption and emission spectra of both samples synthesized in air and Ar atmosphere resemble exactly each other independence of reaction temperature, implying that the presence of oxygen during microwave-assisted process does not obviously influence on the particle size and composition distribution of CIS QDs. This is because that the microwave reaction time is too short to make Cu and In oxidized, and the excess DDT and S powder might also be an oxidation inhibitor.
It has been known that a significant challenge for the synthesis of ternary CIS nanocrystals is to control their composition.18,24,25 To finely control the composition of CIS QDs, it is important to balance the reactivity of the two cationic precursors by their ligands, solvent matrix composition, and reaction temperature. Considering that Cu+ ions are very soft Lewis acids, alkane thiols belonging to soft Lewis base is chosen as ligands to suppress the reactivity of the copper ions according to the “hard-soft acid–base model”.5,15 At the same time, another role of thiols is to provide S source instead of a portion of S powder. In view of the above reasons, the effect of S/DDT ratio, reaction temperature and time on PL properties of as-prepared CIS QDs was investigated and results were shown in Fig. 3. The PL properties of the resulting nanocrystals are found to be strongly dependent on the S powder content, and this dependence can be clearly divided into two regions (Fig. 3a and b). If the initial S-to-DDT molar ratio is smaller than 3:7 (x = 0.3), the emission spectrum of nanocrystals exhibits an obvious blueshift from 690 to 635 nm. The reasons include two aspects: (1) high DDT concentration suppresses the reactivity of the copper ions and as a result, the nanocrystals should be indium-rich in comparison to the stoichiometry of CIS. The corresponding band gap increases with the increase of content of indium.25–27 (2) Low S powder content decreases the growth rate and crystalline size of CIS QDs. And thus, this blueshift represents a quantum confinement effect. On the contrary, at an S-to-DDT ratio higher than 3:7, the emission spectrum rapidly shifts to the long wavelength. Difference from the variation of peak position, the PL intensity reaches a maximum at x = 0.5, which may be due to QDs synthesized at this ratio consisting of the expected CIS composition and the relatively uniform size/shape distribution.
 Fig. 3  Evolution of emission spectra, peak position, and PL intensity for CIS nanocrystals with varying S powder content ((a and b): T = 230 °C, t = 10 min), reaction temperature ((c and d): x = 0.5, t = 3 min) and reaction time ((e and f): x = 0.5, T = 230 °C). CuIn(SIxSII1−x)2 was used to describe different S powder content, SI and SII represent the sulfur from S powder precursor and DDT precursor, respectively. 
Same as previous reports, PL properties of the resulting nanocrystals are found to depend on the reaction temperature and reaction time as the initial S-to-DDT ratio was fixed at 0.5 (Fig. 3c–f). With the growth temperature increasing and reaction time prolonging, the emission peak gradually redshifts from 620 to 695 nm (Fig. 3d and f). From TEM results given in Fig. 4, it can be seen that this redshift is ascribed to CIS nanocrystals growing from 2.7 nm of 220 °C to 3.2 nm of 240 °C.
 Fig. 4  TEM of CIS QDs synthesized at 220 °C ((a), inset is the SAED image) and 240 °C (b), respectively. The upper right of (b) shows some 6.8–10.2 nm white precipitations which are proved to be CuxS by EDS spectra of (c). 
These phenomena can be explained from the thermodynamics and kinetics of nanocrystals growing. However, PL intensity does not continuously increases with reaction temperature and time increasing but reaches a maximum at 230 °C for 5 min with a PLQY of 6.9%. Reports from other research groups5,15,28,29 reveal that copper thiolate in nonaqueous solution can decompose into CuxS nanophases at reaction temperatures above 230 °C. Moreover, when the size of formed CIS nanocrystals exceed 3 nm, the nanocrystals are likely to aggregate and precipitate from the solution upon continuous heating. The relative experimental phenomena have been demonstrated by the inset in Fig. 4b and EDS spectra in Fig. 4c which clearly show that the white nanoparticles between 6.8 to 10.2 nm belong to CuxS phase.
For ternary CIS QDs, another important characteristic is that its band gap and emission color can be tuned by tailoring the ratio of Cu/In. Fig. 5a and b present a series of UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of CIS core QDs with different Cu/In ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. The onsets of absorption spectra and emission peak positions of CIS QDs are strongly related to the ratio of Cu/In. The successive blueshifts in absorption and PL spectra are observed with decreasing the molar ratio of Cu/In from 1:1 to 1:4. The corresponding band gap of the CIS QDs calculated from the absorption spectra increases from 2.37 to 2.69 eV, which matches well with the variation of PL spectra and is consistent with the previous reports.24,26,27 As a result, a tunable PL peak from 712 to 610 nm is obtained, as shown in Fig. 5b. These nonaqueous CIS core QDs have a PLQY of 1.6–6.9%, which is strongly dependent on their emission color (Fig. 5c). Finally, optical properties of various CIS QDs prepared in the present work by reasonably controlling S powder content, reaction temperature, reaction time, and molar ratio of Cu to In are summarized in Table 1.

As-prepared CIS core QDs exhibit low PLQY due to a large number of surface defects which can dramatically lower the PL brightness of CIS core QDs. Since CIS and ZnS have the same zinc blende structure and a relatively low lattice mismatch of ∼2.2%, the protective ZnS shell is usually deposited around CIS core QDs to enhance their fluorescence and stability.20,30 The effect of the thickness of ZnS shell on the PL intensity of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs was investigated. Fig. 6 shows UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs with different thickness of ZnS shell. It is similar to the CIS/ZnS system in previous literatures. After the growth of monolayer ZnS shell, the PL intensity of QDs increases twenty times because of evident removal of the surface trap states.24 It is found that the PLQYs of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs can reach as high as 56% after the growth of monolayer ZnS shell. Interestingly, the growth of the ZnS shell from monolayer to double layers results in a decrease of PL intensity and a blueshift of emission peak from the original 675 to 612 nm, as shown in Fig. 6b. Unlike traditional CdS/Se–ZnS core/shell QDs, a redshift of PL peak was usually observed.20,31 A small blueshift of the PL peak position during the ZnS shell growth indicates that a small amount of zinc ions diffuse into the CIS cores, which enlarges the band gap of QDs. This observation is well consistent with those of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs in the previous reports.24,32,33 Red to deep red emission above 610 nm matches well with the spectral response for Si solar cells ranging from 400 to 1000 nm, combining with high PLQY and environmentally friendly host material, so that as-prepared CIS/ZnS QDs as a LDS material is expected to be more efficient for improving the efficiency of the cell.

Fig. 7 presents the XRD patterns of CIS core and CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs synthesized by microwave irradiation at different temperatures. It can be seen that the as-prepared both CIS core and CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs belong to the face-centered cubic phase with the zinc blende structure. Three peaks at 27.6°, 45.8° and 54.5° correspond to (1 1 2), (2 0 4) and (3 1 2) planes, respectively. The growth of ZnS shell leads to a slight shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angle, indicating the formation of the ZnS shell around the CIS cores. In addition to the main CIS crystal phase, an impurity phase of CuxS is also observed for the QDs prepared at 240 °C due to decomposition of copper thiolate at higher reaction temperature, which agrees well with the EDS and TEM results shown in Fig. 4.

Good stability is a prerequisite for QDs to successfully apply to photovoltaic devices. Therefore, the photostability of as-prepared CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs was investigated and shown in Fig. 8. It can be clearly seen that PL intensity of QDs preserves about 84% of initial value and peak emission wavelength only redshifts 3 nm after they were continuously irradiated for 5 h by an 8 W UV lamp of 365 nm under air atmosphere, which suggests an excellent photostability.

The schematic diagram of QDs/PMMA-based LDS layer applying to Si solar cell device is given in Fig. 9. It is well known that Si PV devices do not efficiently respond to photons of all wavelengths. The spectral response is significantly poorer for UV and blue light compared to longer visible wavelengths. Photons in the range of <400 nm interact strongly with the front layers of PV devices and are lost as heat in Si due to their high energy. As-prepared CIS/ZnS QDs were uniformly dispersed into PMMA matrix to form a transparent composite thin film that was applied to the front of Si solar cell as a LDS layer.
 Fig. 9  Schematic of CIS/ZnS QDs/PMMA thin film as a LDS layer for Si solar cell. 
Fig. 10a shows transmissivity curves of different composite thin films. Compared with PL spectra of glass and pure PMMA film, there is an obvious absorption from 350 to 500 nm for QDs/PMMA composite films, which is obviously due to the contribution from CIS/ZnS QDs. However, a decrease in transmissivity is accompanied when QDs concentration is too high and exceeds 1.5 mg L−1 (Sample 5), which finally has a negative impact on the conversion efficiency of the solar cell.34 The J–V curves of the Si solar cells containing different thin films on top are shown in Fig. 10b. The short-circuit density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η) of all the cells are listed in Table 2. It can be observed that the Jsc, FF, and η have obviously increased from 42.03 mA cm−2, 67.52%, and 15.61% for the blank substrate Si solar cell to 43.20 mA cm−2, 68.22%, and 16.21% for the PMMA composite thin film containing 1.0 mg L−1 CIS/ZnS QDs (Sample 4). The high energy UV-blue lights with lower sensitivity to the solar cell are absorbed by CIS/ZnS QDs and converted to red photons with higher sensitivity to the solar cell. These converted photons can be absorbed by Si and converted into useful electrical energy more efficiently. Another positive effect of this conversion is that the resulting red photons are penetrating deeper into Si than the unconverted high energy photons that are in general absorbed near the surface of the cell. This means that the red photons are absorbed nearer the p–n junction of the cell and generate electrons and holes that are efficiently collected under the effect of the electric field of the junction. Both of the above effects cause an enhancement of 3.84% for the conversion efficiency.20 However, the conversion efficiency decreases when the concentration of QDs in PMMA film is further increased to 1.5 mg L−1 (Sample 5). This is because that high QDs concentration leads to poor film quality and as a result weakens the transmittance of the composite film shown in Fig. 10a.

4 Conclusions
Air-stabilized CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs with high photoluminescence were successfully synthesized by a facile air-exposing microwave-assisted route. These QDs do not only possess a high PLQY but also exhibit a large Stokes shift. The effect of CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs as LDS material on Si solar cell devices has been investigated by embedding them in transparent PMMA films. The doping concentration was optimized. The conversion efficiency of the cell under one sun illumination is improved maximally 3.84% as compared to the one with pure glass as the concentration of the dots increases to 1.0 mg L−1.
