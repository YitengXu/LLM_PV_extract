    , Accepted 13th December 2011First published on 30th January 2012AbstractSpherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures with scale of 2–4 μm were prepared by a hydrothermal reaction using bismuth nitrate and ammonium tungstate as raw materials. Ag was deposited on the surface of Bi2WO6via a following facile photoreduction process. The as-prepared samples were characterized by UV-Vis-DRS, BET, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM. The results revealed that the monodispersed metallic Ag nanoparticles with average size of 10–15 nm were deposited on the surface of the spherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the photodegradation of RhB and thiophene under visible light irradiation. The results showed that Ag loading greatly improved the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6, and the content of loading silver has an impact on the catalytic activity of Bi2WO6. The 0.5at%Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 sample exhibited the best photocatalytic activity in both the decolorization of RhB and desulfurization of thiophene. In addition, the mechanism for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 was also investigated by comparison of their PL spectra.
1. Introduction
During the past decades, advances in heterogeneous photocatalysis have received considerable attention focused on the viewpoint of environmental accountability and energy conversion. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been extensively studied because of its high activity, long-term stability, low price and availability.1–3 However, TiO2 has not yet been used in application to industrial wastewater treatment due to its relatively inefficient quantum yield and wide band gap. Therefore, the needs arise for photocatalytic materials which are visible light active to efficiently utilize the solar radiation. Thus, the exploitation of new photocatalysts is compulsory.4,5
As one of the simplest Aurivillius oxides, bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) has received much attention owing to its good photocatalytic performance in water splitting and organic contaminant decomposition under visible light irradiation.6–9 Several research groups have reported that Bi2WO6-based photocatalysts can effectively degrade organic pollutants under visible light irradiation.4–11
The photocatalytic activities of catalysts are seriously dependent on their particle size, morphology, crystallization degree, structure and composition. Therefore, a way to control the size and morphology of Bi2WO6 is important in maximizing the photocatalytic efficiency. To this end, many strategies have been developed to shape-controlled synthesis of Bi2WO6-based photocatalysts.7,11–15 Among these methods, the hydrothermal method is the most predominantly employed method. Up to date, Bi2WO6 samples with different shapes including nanoparticles, nanoplates, and flower/sphere-like, nest/helix-like and nanocage-like superstructures have been obtained by tuning the parameters such as pH values, surfactants or template.8–10,15 It is also known that the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors depends strongly on three factors: adsorption behavior, photo-response region and the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Accordingly, three main strategies have been investigated to improve the activity of photocatalysts. One is to increase the specific surface area of catalystsvia controllable synthesis methods, the second is to extend the photo-response region of Bi2WO6 photocatalysts by doping of nonmetals or transition metals,16,17 and the third is to maximize the separation efficiency and increase the oxidation power of photogenerated carriers. In general, noble metals, such as Ag, Pt, Au and Pd, have been used as electron acceptors to separate the photoinduced hole/electron pair and promote interfacial charge-transfer processes.18–20 Up to date, although many efforts have been made to improve the activity of Bi2WO6 photocatalysts, there are still some drawbacks hindering their lifetimes and the limited region of visible-light photo-response. To meet the requirements of the future practical performance of Bi2WO6 photocatalysts, it is still necessary to design novel Bi2WO6 based photocatalysts to further improve photocatalytic efficiencies. Very recently, Wang and co-workers have reported the preparation of Ag doped Bi2WO6 nanoparticlesvia an alcohol-thermal process and the photocatalysis experimental results revealed that Ag-doped Bi2WO6 exhibited high photocatalytic activity compared with pure Bi2WO6 in inactivation of a bacterium.21 Although Ag doped Bi2WO6 nanoparticles exhibit high photocatalytic activity, they are too small to be recycled. Furthermore, the loaded Ag existed in both the interior and the surface of Bi2WO6 nanoparticles, which is a disadvantage for using Ag particles to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.
In the present study, monodispersed Ag nanoparticles loaded on the surface of spherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures have been synthesized for the first time via a facile photoreduction process from aqueous AgNO3 solution. Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant and thiophene was employed as a simulated fuel oil to evaluate the photocatalytic desulfurization activity of the samples under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the relationship between photocatalytic activity and morphology, energy band structure of the samples and content of loaded Ag was also discussed. The experimental results demonstrated that monodispersed Ag nanoparticle loaded Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in the photo-degradation of RhB dye and thiophene, had high stability and were easy to be recycled.
2. Experimental section
2.1 
          Sample preparation

All chemical reagents in this work were analytical grade and used without further purification. Other chemicals used were all analytical grade. Bi2WO6 was prepared by hydrothermal reaction of ammonium tungstate hydrate ((NH4)10W12O41·5H2O) and bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 2.0 mmol) under autogenerated pressure. The amount of tungsten precursor was 10% excess from the stoichiometric ratio. In a typical preparation process, an aqueous solution of ammonium tungstate hydrate was added drop-wise to a mixture of Bi(NO3)3 and water under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature. The pH value of the resulting white slurry was adjusted to 1.0 using nitric acid, and then was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was filled with the solution to 80% of its volume, and was sealed and maintained at 160 °C for different times. The processing time was 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, respectively. After the reaction, the yellowish white precipitate was separated centrifugally and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times. Then, the products were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 4 h before analysis. The prepared samples were denoted as Bi2WO6-6h, Bi2WO6-12h or Bi2WO6-24h, respectively.

          Silver loaded Bi2WO6 was prepared by a photoreduction process. The obtained Bi2WO6 (1 mmol) was dispersed in water by magnetic stirring, and then appropriate amounts of AgNO3 were added. Then the suspension was irradiated for 3 h using a 500 W Xe-arc lamp under stirring at ambient temperature, and the cut-off filter was used to cut off the light below 450 nm. The obtained Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 was washed with water to remove NO3− ions and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h in air. To investigate the effects of the contents of Ag on the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6, the added contents of Ag in a photoreduction process were varied from 0.25% to 2.0%, so the resulting samples were denoted as 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0at%Ag-Bi2WO6, respectively.

          TiO2−xNx, known for its good photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of pollutants under visible-light irradiation, was prepared as in ref. 22. According to the literature,21 0.5at%Ag doped Bi2WO6 sample was also prepared to compare the photocatalytic activity with our sample 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6.
2.2 Characterization

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out with a Shimadzu XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of the samples was measured by nitrogen adsorption in an ASAP2010 from Micromeritics Instrument Corporation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images were recorded on a PHI-5400 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were taken on a JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope. High-resolution transmission electron (HR-TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on a JEM-2100 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard.
2.3 Photocatalytic experiment.

Photocatalytic decomposition of RhB. 
The evaluation of the photocatalytic performance of samples for photocatalytic decolorization of RhB aqueous solution was performed as follows: A 500 W Xe-arc lamp was used as the visible-light source with a cutoff filter to cut off the light below 420 nm. The suspensions containing 200 mg of photocatalyst and 250 mL fresh aqueous solution of RhB (10 mg L−1) were continuously magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 h to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium of RhB solution. After this period of time, the light source was turned on. During the reaction, 5 mL of samples were taken at given time intervals and then the Bi2WO6 photocatalysts were separated through centrifugation. The supernatant solution was decanted and the absorbance of RhB was determined through its maximum absorption band using a Shimadzu 2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer and the absorption peak at 553 nm was monitored.


Photocatalytic desulfurization. 
Model fuel oil (content of sulfur was settled as 500 μg g−1) was prepared by dissolving thiophene in n-octane.23 The simulated photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization experiments were performed in a closed Pyrex cell of 500 mL capacity. The reaction vessel was fitted with a central 500 W Xe-arc lamp and had inlet and outlet ports for bubbling with air. The suspensions containing 200 mg of Bi2WO6 samples and 250 mL model oil fresh solution were continuously magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium of thiophene solution. Before and during the irradiation, the solution was purged with air. At specific time intervals, 5 mL of samples were withdrawn and then the Bi2WO6 photocatalysts were separated through filtration. Then, the obtained solution was extracted by means of a solution of acetonitrile. The content of sulfur of the model fuel oil was detected by a micro-coulometer.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          XRD and XPS
The phase structure, crystallinity and purity of the as-obtained product were examined by XRD measurements. The lattice parameters, crystallite size and BET specific surface area for the samples are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface areas for Bi2WO6-6h, Bi2WO6-12h, Bi2WO6-24h and 0.5at %Ag-loaded Bi2WO6-12h are 29.2, 28.6, 26.6 and 20.1 m2 g−1, respectively. Their XRD patterns are compared in Fig. 1, and the diffraction peaks can be categorized into two sets: the unmarked peaks at 2θ of 28.3°, 32.8°, 32.9°, 47.0°, 47.1°, 55.8°, 58.5°, 68.7°, 75.9° and 78.5° can be perfectly indexed to an orthorhombic Bi2WO6 (JCPD file no.39-0256), corresponding to the indices of (131), (200), (002), (260), (202), (331), (262), (400), (103) and (204) planes, respectively, while the marked peaks agree well with face-centered cubic Ag corresponding to JCPDS files no. 04-0783 (Fig. 1d). The XRD patterns of different Ag loaded samples are given in Fig. S1†. No peaks of other impurities are detected, indicating satisfactory purity of the products. After refinement, the lattice parameters of the samples are obtained (Table 1). It is clear that there is neglectable change in the lattice parameters between Bi2WO6 and Ag loaded Bi2WO6. Widened diffraction peaks show that the size of the crystalline grain is small. The average crystalline size estimated from the (131) peak is about 16.2, 18.6, 22.6 and 20.1 nm, according to the Scherrer equation for samples Bi2WO6-6h, Bi2WO6-12h, Bi2WO6-24h and 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures. In addition, we can see that the XRD patterns of the products viahydrothermal process for 12 h and 24 h show peaks with a sharp shape and high intensity, which indicated that prolonged hydrothermal time is crucial to enhance the crystallinity of Bi2WO6. Moreover, as can be seen from the XRD patterns, the products have high crystallinity when the reaction time reaches 12 h. This is beneficial for photocatalysts because high crystallinity generally means fewer traps and stronger photocatalytic activity.

Further evidence for the chemical composition and oxidation states of the as-prepared 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 architectures was obtained by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The XPS spectra of 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6-12h are shown in Fig. 2A–2E. It can be seen that the sample contains only Bi, W, O and Ag elements and a trace amount of carbon. The C element is ascribed to the residual carbon from the precursor solution and the adventitious carbon from the XPS instrument itself. Fig. 2B–2E show the high-resolution spectra of the Bi 4f, W 4f, O 1s and Ag 3d regions, respectively. In Fig. 2B, it is obvious that the Bi4f consists of two peaks with binding energies around 159 eV and 164 eV, which correspond to the signals from doublets of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 in the trivalent oxidation state, and no other peak of low oxidation state. The peaks at 37.5 and 35.2 eV, as shown in Fig. 2C, corresponding to W 4F5/2 and W 4F7/2, respectively, can be assigned to a W6+ oxidation state.24 As shown in Fig. 2D, the O element may be divided into two kinds of chemical states: crystal lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen.25Fig. 2E gives the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ag3d. The Ag3d3/2 and Ag3d5/2 peaks are identified at 374.4, 368.2 eV, respectively, suggesting the presence of metal Ag.26,27 Based on the XPS and XRD results demonstrated above, we can conclude that the loaded Ag should be metal Ag. Furthermore, the peak areas were determined for the quantitative elemental analysis of Bi, W, O and Ag in the 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 architectures, and the atomic ratio of Bi:W:O:Ag is 2:1:6.01:0.01.

3.2 
          FE-SEM and TEM observation
The morphology of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 samples was examined by FE-SEM. Fig. 3A–3F shows typical FE-SEM images of the sample by hydrothermal reaction of (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and incubated at 160 °C for different times. It can be clearly seen that the sample of Bi2WO6-6h nanocrystals exhibits nanoplate-like morphology with thickness of 10–20 nm (Fig. 3A–3B). When the reaction time was extended to 12 h, the resulting sample exhibited a spherical architecture with the scale of 2–4 μm (Fig. 3C–3D). Interestingly, the spherical Bi2WO6 architectures have many small secondary nanoplates. Further information about the Bi2WO6 architectures was obtained from FE-SEM images (Fig. 3D) and TEM images (Fig. 3E–3F). From these figures, it can be seen that the spherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures are built up by nanoplates with diameters of 10–20 nm. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 3E) reveals well-aligned clear diffraction spots that can be indexed to the orthorhombic structure of Bi2WO6. The single crystalline nature and parameters of the nanoplates were also confirmed by HR-TEM (Fig. 3F). The spacing of the lattice fringes was found to be about 0.315 nm, as shown in Fig. 3F, which is in good agreement with the d-spacing of the (131) planes of orthorhombic Bi2WO6. The result is well consistent with that of the XRD pattern in Fig. 1. Further prolonging the reaction time to 24 h did not show an obvious change in the size and morphology of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 (Fig. 3G–3H).

Based on the above results and the reported literature,28,29 the morphological evolution of spherical Bi2WO6 architectures is proposed as depicted in Scheme 1. Due to the high intrinsic anisotropic properties of Bi2WO6, the nanocrystals prefer to grow into a two-dimensional plate-like structure during the initial period of hydrothermal treatment (step 1 in Scheme 1), which has also been revealed in earlier literature.27,30 When the hydrothermal time is prolonged to 12 h, the nanoplates self-assemble to spherical nanoarchitectures (step 2 in Scheme 1). This mechanism is different from the oriented attachment,31,32 of which the driving force may be the strong surface energy of the small nanoplates with diameters of 10–20 nm. However, the detailed formation mechanism of the as-synthesized spherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures is still not clear, and further investigation should be carried out.

Fig. 4 shows the FE-SEM and TEM photograph of 0.5at%Ag loaded Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures, indicating 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures with the same morphology as pure Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures (Fig. 4C–4D). Some small spherical particles, about 10 nm, can be clearly observed over the surface of the Bi2WO6 architectures, indicating that Ag nanoparticles were highly dispersed on the surface of the Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures, which is well consistent with the XRD and XPS results.

3.3 Optical absorption of spherical Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures
The optical absorption of the spherical nanoarchitectures was measured using a UV-visible spectrometer. The typical UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectrum (UV-Vis-DRS spectrum) of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 is compared with that of pure Bi2WO6 in Fig. 5. Pure Bi2WO6-12h presents photo-absorption properties from the UV light region to visible light at about 450 nm due to the intrinsic band-gap transition. The absorption spectra of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 are obviously different from those of pure Bi2WO6. The plasmon peak centered at around 500 nm of the Ag nanoparticles is not obvious because the content of loaded Ag is low.21 However, it can be clearly seen that Ag loaded Bi2WO6-12h nanoarchitectures show an obvious absorption band between 450 nm to 700 nm. XRD and XPS results (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) have also proved that it is metal Ag rather than other compounds existing in the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6. So, the absorption band from 450 nm to 700 nm in the visible light region could be attributed to the surface plasmon band of the Ag nanoparticles. The surface plasmon absorption in the metal nanoparticles arises from the collective oscillations of the free conduction band electrons that are enhanced by the incident electromagnetic radiation. For a crystalline semiconductor, the optical absorption near band edge follows the equation αhν = (hν − Eg)n. The value of n decides the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor. According to the equation, the n for Bi2WO6 is 1/2.30 For this reason, the band gap energy can be estimated from a plot of (α)1/2versus the photon energy (inset of Fig. 5). The band gap energies estimated from the intercept of the tangents to the plots are 2.71, 2.68, 2.64, 2.55 and 2.63 eV for samples of pure Bi2WO6, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 at%Ag loaded Bi2WO6, respectively. As can be expected from the absorption spectra, the nanocrystals are yellow in color. Intense absorption bands with a steep edge in the visible light region are observed. These indicate that the visible light absorption band is induced by the band gap transition instead of the transition from impurity levels.

3.4 Photocatalytic activities and mechanism

Rhodamine B (RhB), a widely used dye, was selected as the model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the samples. The photocatalytic performances of the Ag loaded Bi2WO6 with different Ag contents were determined by comparing the degradation efficiency of RhB (Fig. 6). By analyzing the change of concentration of RhB solution vs. illumination time as shown in Fig. 6A, the result well obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics, i.e. ln(Ct/C0) = −kt. Interestingly, it can be observed that when a 500 W Xe-arc lamp was used as the visible light source with a cutoff filter to cut off the light below 420 nm, as-prepared spherical Bi2WO6-12h nanoarchitectures showed a better photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation than samples Bi2WO6-6h and Bi2WO6-24h, which indicates that the morphology and crystallinity have a great effect on the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 photocatalysts. The Bi2WO6-6h nanocrystals exhibit nanoplate-like morphology with low crystallinity, and their photocatalytic activity is lower than that of the spherical Bi2WO6-12h with high crystallinity. With further prolonging the hydrothermal reaction time to 24 h, the specific surface area (SBET) of the sample Bi2WO6-24h decreased, so the photocatalytic activity is also lower than Bi2WO6-12h. Fig. 6B shows the rate constant values (k) of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 series catalysts with different silver content for degradation of Rhodamine B solution. It can be observed that the k value of the 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures is higher than the others, and is nearly three times as fast as that of pure Bi2WO6-12h, which is in accordance with the curves of the catalysts' photocatalytic activities. The inset shows the absorbance variations of RhB solution during the photodegradation experiments. The aqueous RhB solution has the maximum absorbance around 552 nm, and in the presence of 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures, the absorbance decreased, suggesting the adsorption of RhB occurs in the dark. It can be found that 5% of RhB was adsorbed onto the surface of the sample and the remaining RhB was photocatalytically degraded by the 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures quickly. It is well-reported that the RhB photodegradation occurs via two competitive processes: N-deethylation and the destruction of the conjugated structure.33 N-deethylation results in the spectral maximum peak shifting from 552 to 498 nm. After being irradiated for 30 min, about 90% of RhB was degraded by 0.5at%Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 photocatalyst. The color of the solution changed gradually from pink to light green. Further irradiation to 40 min caused the decrease of the absorption band at 498 nm. For comparison, the RhB photodegradation by TiO2−xNx and 0.5at%Ag doped Bi2WO6 was also performed. The results are shown in Fig. S2†. One can see that the degradation of RhB over 0.5at%Ag loaded Bi2WO6 was more rapid than that in the case of TiO2−xNx and 0.5at%Ag doped Bi2WO6.

In order to further exploit the performance of the series of Bi2WO6 samples, an amount of thiophene was added to n-octane to make a solution of model fuel oil containing a definite concentration of sulfur compound, and the mixture was subjected to photocatalytic reaction by using Bi2WO6 as a catalyst under visible light irradiation. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that thiophene shows high stability under visible illumination. But, it was photodegradated rapidly when Bi2WO6 was used as photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of pure Bi2WO6-12h sample could reach 69.4% after being illuminated for 180 min under visible light, and the photocatalytic activities increased with the content of loaded Ag, and reached the best activity when Bi2WO6 was loaded with 0.5 at% Ag, the desulfurization rate of model fuel oil could reach 88.2%. But, the degradation efficiency dropped when the content of loaded Ag was more than 1.0 at%.

The enhanced photocatalytic activities of the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures can be explained by improvement of the charge separation, which is highly dependent on Ag loaded content. When the Ag content is lower than 0.5 at%, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures is enhanced with the increase of Ag content. When the content of loaded Ag is higher than 0.5 at%, the photocatalytic activity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures decreases with the increase of Ag content because the more numerous Ag deposits conversely behave as recombinant centers, encouraging the recombination of charge carriers. The photocatalytic behavior is closely related to the efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole separation and the diffusion from the inner regions to the surface of the grains.
While the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 photocatalyst is being irradiated, CB-electrons of Bi2WO6 easily flow into the metal Ag through the Schottky barrier because the CB of Bi2WO6 is higher than that of the loaded metal Ag, which is consistent with the previous study on electron transfer from a semiconductor (such as TiO2) to a metal (such as Ag, Au).34–36 The process of electron transfer is faster than the electron-hole recombination between the VB and CB of Bi2WO6. Thus, plenty of CB electrons can be stored in the Ag component.35,36 In the present study, the PL spectrum was employed to explain this process. Since PL emission mainly results from the recombination of excited electrons and holes, PL emission spectra are useful in determining the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer, and helpful in understanding the fate of electron-hole pairs in semiconductor particles. A low PL intensity implies a low recombination rate of the electron-hole under light irradiation.37Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the PL spectra of as-prepared pure-Bi2WO6-12h and Ag-loaded Bi2WO6-12h. When the excitation wavelength is 300 nm, Bi2WO6 has a broad blue-green emission peak at 430–530 nm.38 The PL spectrum of the as-prepared Bi2WO6 revealed that three peaks appeared at 423, 485 and 528 nm. It was found that the PL emission spectra of the pure-Bi2WO6-12h and Ag-loaded Bi2WO6-12h photocatalysts showed the main peaks at similar positions but with different intensities. The PL intensity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 is lower than that of pure Bi2WO6, which clearly indicates that the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers between the CB-Bi2WO6 to the VB-Bi2WO6 is greatly inhibited in the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6.

The photocatalytic activity of semiconductors is due to the production of excited electrons in the conduction band, along with corresponding positive holes in the valence band under light irradiation. These energetically excited species are active and capable of initiating many chemical reactions, usually by the production of radical species at the semiconductors surface. However, the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes occurs very quickly. The photocatalytic efficiency depends on the competition between the surface charge carrier transfer rate and the electron-hole recombination rate. If the recombination occurs too fast, there is no time for any other chemical reaction to occur. While the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 photocatalyst was irradiated, the electrons were excited from the valance band to the conduction band. The loaded Ag acts as the electron receptor on the surface of Bi2WO6, which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers between the CB-Bi2WO6 and the VB-Bi2WO6 in the Ag-loaded Bi2WO6. As a result, the electron-hole recombination decreased, which could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity (Fig. S3†), and a VB-hole (Bi2WO6) with a strong oxidation power escapes from the pair recombination and is available to oxidize the pollutant, which explains the reason why the Ag loaded Bi2WO6 sample exhibits higher photocatalysis than the pure-Bi2WO6.
Based on our experiment results and reported literature,34–37 a mechanism is proposed for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures in the degradation of pollutants under visible light irradiation as follows:Bi2WO6 + hv → Bi2WO6 (h+) + Bi2WO6 (e−)H2O → H+ + OH−OH− + h+ → ·OHe− + Ag → Ag(e−)OH + O2 + RhB (or thiophene) → Oxidation products
The stability of the photocatalyst is important for its application. To demonstrate the potential applicability of Ag loaded Bi2WO6 photocatalysts, the stability of the as-prepared 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 spherical nanoarchitectures was investigated. Fig. 9 shows the results of a repeated experiment for the durability of RhB degradation on 0.5at%Ag loaded Bi2WO6. RhB was quickly degraded after every injection of RhB, suggesting that 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 showed relatively stable performance for RhB degradation. After five cycles for photodegradation of RhB, the catalyst did not exhibit any obvious loss of activity, as shown in Fig. 9, confirming that Ag loaded Bi2WO6 spherical nanoarchitectures have high stability and are easy to be recycled. Fig. S4† shows the XRD 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 photocatalyst patterns before and after use. It is found that there is no change in the positions and intensity of all diffraction peaks and there are no other phases detected in the XRD patterns of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the TEM image of the used 0.5at%Ag-Bi2WO6 photocatalyst did not show obvious change (Fig. S5†).

4. Conclusion
Monodispersed Ag nanoparticles with size of 10 nm were loaded on the surface of Bi2WO6 nanoarchitectures by a facile photoreduction process. The photocatalysis experimental results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 is greatly enhanced compared with pure Bi2WO6, and the content of silver has an impact on the catalytic activity of Ag-loaded Bi2WO6. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared 0.5at%Ag-loaded Bi2WO6 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for both the photocatalytic degradation of RhB and thiophene. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the efficient separation and preventing of the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Therefore, the facile photoreduction process using noble metal loaded Bi2WO6 could be a strategy to design new efficient photocatalysts for the destruction of environmental pollutants and photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization of fuel oil.
