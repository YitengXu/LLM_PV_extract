    , Accepted 8th May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractHarvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic technology has become an essential component of future global energy production. Although silicon-based inorganic materials still play a dominant role in the market, problems for inorganic materials-based solar cells mainly lie in (1) the high cost of production and technical difficulties in the fabrication of large-area cells and (2) supply of highly purified silicon. In contrast to inorganic photovoltaic materials, organic/polymer photovoltaic materials have currently become of broader interest owing to their great potential to bring about a major breakthrough in reducing the cost of solar cells. As a promising building block to construct narrow bandgap semiconductors for high-efficiency photovoltaics, structurally well-defined indacenodithiophene (IDT) and its derivatives have inspired great interest in the industrial and academic communities over recent years due to their rigidified and tunable coplanar fused ring aromatic structures, and 3D conformation as well. The aromatic fused-ring blocks efficiently restrain rotational disorder and consequently lower reorganization energy. An encouraging power conversion efficiency of more than 12% has been achieved in the IDT-based polymer solar cells. This review surveys recent research advances in the area of IDT-based conjugated materials for photovoltaic applications. The factors affecting the bandgaps, molecular energy levels, film morphologies, as well as the photovoltaic performance of these materials have also been discussed.Yongxi LiYongxi Li obtained his Ph.D. degree in 2014 from East China University of Science & Technology under the supervision of Prof. Yu Chen.

1. Introduction
Recent progress in organic electronics has ignited great interest not only in the fundamental molecular design of the novel organic/polymeric semiconducting materials (SCMs), but also in the optimal design of device architectures, reliable methods for integrating increasingly complex circuitry onto semiconductor devices (or chips), and large-scale materials processing and thin film fabrication techniques as well.1–14 By using soluble π-conjugated polymer materials as the semiconducting media, flexible and miniaturized electronic devices with simple structures can be fabricated with particular ease through solution processing, resulting in a simplified fabrication process and significantly reduced manufacturing cost. More importantly, the electronic properties of the polymers can be fine-tuned via innovative molecular design cum chemical synthesis strategies due to their remarkable structural flexibility and diversity. Both the p-type (hole-transporting) and n-type (electron-transporting) organic/polymeric semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 1, are expected to play a role in tomorrow's electronics.
 Fig. 1  The road map of organic conjugated semiconductors. 
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept (Fig. 2) has been widely used for mainstream polymer solar cells (PSCs), in which an interpenetrated charge channel connecting the two electrodes was formed by blending of the polymer as an electron donor with an electron acceptor material.15–27 The driving force for the charge transport was ascribed either to the concentration-gradient-induced diffusion or the electric-field-induced drift of charge carriers.28 Very recently, encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.8% has been achieved for single junction cells.29 In the organic photovoltaic technology roadmap towards high PCEs, molecular engineering of conjugated SCMs has become one of the main driving forces to promote the development of PSCs.14,30–38 Design and synthesis of high-efficiency organic/polymeric photovoltaic materials, however, still challenges the ability of materials chemists to translate a number of required characteristics (e.g., high absorption coefficient, high hole (or, electron) mobility and high exciton diffusion length, tunable bandgaps, tailorable frontier molecular orbital energies, optimally ordered film microstructure and morphology, high stability and durability, and others) into specific molecular design and synthesis sequences.

The molecular structure of polymers can be tailored by functionalizing them with electron donors (D) and acceptors (A) of different strengths, spacer moieties of different steric effects for the electroactive pendant groups, or nanostructured electroactive materials. One approach for designing toward highly efficient photovoltaic polymers is the covalent coupling of at least one electron donor with at least one electron acceptor, either directly or through a conjugated bridge.39–46 Since the first report of this strategy in 1992, some functional materials with D–A structures, in which the hybridization of the energy levels of the donor and acceptor moieties results in such D–A systems with unusually low HOMO–LUMO separation, have been extensively studied.47–57 As a result, the bandgaps and energy levels of these polymers can be easily modified by individually tuning the molecular and electronic structures of the donor or acceptor (Fig. 3). The double bond characteristic between the D and A units leads to a more planar configuration to facilitate the π-electron delocalization along the conjugated backbone, suggesting that a smaller bandgap can obtained.58 Basically, the ideal conjugated polymer for BHJ solar cells should have a low-lying HOMO energy level to ensure a high open circuit voltage (Voc), a broad absorption in the range of 300–900 nm to maximize the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and a high charge mobility to improve the fill factor (FF). A “weak donor–strong acceptor” strategy has been proposed to maintain a low HOMO energy level via the “weak donor” and to result in a narrow bandgap by employing a “strong acceptor”.59,60 In addition, the charge mobility, molecular interaction, and stability of a conjugated polymer can also be optimized by appropriate backbone design.

Among various types of conjugated donor molecules, indacenodithiophene (IDT) has been recognized as a promising building block to construct narrow bandgap semiconductors for high-efficiency photovoltaics1,42,48,61–64 due to its coplanar fused ring aromatic structure. Strong intermolecular interactions can afford ordered molecular organization. As shown in Fig. 4, three aromatic rings integrate into a single fused molecular structure in which a bridging atom fixes coplanarity between the rings, maximizing π orbital overlap, as well as reducing conformational energetic disorder. In contrast to the other building blocks (i.e., benzodithiophene (BDT), cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and naphthodithiophene (NDT)), the pentacyclic IDT molecules with a much extended π-conjugated system could produce highly desirable photo-physical and electronic properties such as a low degree of energetic disorder, high carrier mobility and others. Recently, Iain McCulloch and co-workers have developed an IDT-based polymer with hole mobility of up to 3.6 cm2 (V−1 s−1) despite lack of long range crystalline order.65 This surprisingly high mobility in such less crystalline materials is mainly due to the remarkable resilience of the backbone conformation to side chain disorder.66 Another fantastic feature of the IDT unit is that both the choice of bridging atom and the planarity of the substituents projecting from the bridge and/or through electron donation or inductive effects strongly influence the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and distribution. The former influences the degree of aromaticity of the repeat unit, while the latter has an effect on the electron density of the structural unit. In addition, the bridging position also offers an opportunity to covalently graft different side chain groups, typically alkyl chains or aromatic side chains, which can improve solubility and impact polymer thin film morphology, depending on their length and shape. Schemes 1 and 2 give the synthesis routes for the preparation of two typical IDT-based monomers.

Since the first introduction of an IDT unit into photovoltaic materials, hundreds of new IDT-based polymers, which have been synthesized by Stille coupling and/or Suzuki coupling reactions, have been already used to fabricate PSCs in the past 5 years.48,67–69 Interestingly, many highly efficient PSCs reported in recent years have been greatly associated with the IDT-based polymers, suggesting that these materials have currently become one of the major families of polymer photovoltaic materials. Recently, various IDT- and its derivative-based non-fullerene electron acceptors have also been developed for photovoltaic applications.70–72 This review surveys recent research advances in the area of IDT-based conjugated materials for photovoltaic applications. The factors affecting the bandgaps, molecular energy levels, film morphologies, as well as the photovoltaic performance of these materials have also been discussed. Besides, we also summarize the applications of the IDT-based highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors in PSCs.
2. IDT polymers based on various electron acceptors
The ability to absorb light from the near UV up to 700 nm is another major merit of the IDT-based copolymers for photovoltaic applications. The absorption profile can be easily tuned by varying the electron-deficient counterpart, and consequently strong absorption can be achieved in the low-energy region of the visible spectrum. As one of the most promising acceptors suitable for construction of highly efficient photovoltaic materials, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with a relatively high electron affinity has a quasi-quinoidal structure rather than a 10 π electron heteroaromatic system. Its high electron affinity mainly results from the imine functionalities with relatively low energy π*-orbitals. This molecule possesses a relatively low-lying HOMO energy level in the resulting polymers, which is very favorable to achieve a high Voc.39 Ting et al. were the first to synthesize an IDT and BT-based conjugated amorphous polymer (P1, Fig. 5),73 with a high PCE of 6.4%, a larger Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V and a quite high FF of 0.67. Following their report, several state-of-the-art IDT-based conjugated polymers were successfully developed soon after. By adding fluorine atoms to the BT unit, Jen et al. developed two new classical polymers P2 and P3.74 Both of them showed deep HOMO energy levels (−5.38 eV for P2 and −5.48 eV for P3) and narrow bandgaps (1.72 eV for P2 and 1.78 eV for P3). Particularly, these two polymers exhibited strong interchain interaction-induced aggregation, resulting in a high mobility. Their PCE and Voc values are 5.40% and 0.86 V for P2, and 5.10% and 0.92 V for P3, respectively. These results demonstrated that the introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group to the BT unit can not only reduce the LUMO level, but can also effectively decrease the HOMO level of the polymer. However, the relatively large optical bandgaps of P1–P3 make these materials to be unable to absorb light efficiently to generate sufficient charge carriers. A stronger acceptor thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyT) was also developed by replacing benzene in the BT unit with the more electron-deficient pyridine.67 After introducing the more electron-deficient PyT unit, P4 showed a reduced bandgap (1.60 eV) and deep HOMO energy level compared to its BT counterparts. BHJ solar cells based on the blends of polymer and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester) showed a PCE of 3.41% for P4. By using monofluoro-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (FBSe) as the electron acceptor and IDT as the electron donor, a novel FBSe-based polymer (P5) was synthesized via a microwave-assisted palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization.75 This polymer exhibited broad absorption and lower HOMO energy level, resulting in high Jsc and Voc values. Higher PCE of 4.65%, with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 10.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.53, was achieved in a BHJ device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/bis-C60/Ag under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm−2. In 2013, an even stronger acceptor naphtho-[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) (NT) was developed by Huang and co-workers.76 In contrast to BT, this acceptor exhibits an enlarged conjugation length and enhanced planarity, which contribute to improve carrier mobility and reduce the bandgaps (P6).
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures of IDT-based polymers with BT derivatives as acceptors. 
Quinoxaline (Qx) is another widely investigated electron-withdrawing building block for constructing conjugated polymers for PSCs. Although the bandgaps of Qx-based polymers are larger than those of the BT-based ones, their HOMO levels are deeper. This suggested that larger Voc values would be easily achieved in these polymers. For instance, P7 (Fig. 6), which was synthesized from 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline as the acceptor and IDT as the donor,77 showed a large bandgap (1.81 eV), a deep HOMO level (5.33 eV) and a PCE of 5.69%. Two separated phenyl rings on the 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline could, however, induce steric hindrance to interrupt intermolecular stacking between polymer chains, which directly affects the charge transfer abilities of the polymers. To solve this problem, P8 was successfully synthesized by using fused Qx with improved planarity. This material showed good intermolecular packing and charge transport properties due to the extended π-conjugation of the fused Qx. Its bandgap (1.67 eV) is smaller than that of P7 (1.81 eV), and consequently the P8-based BHJ device, in which PC71BM was used as the electron acceptor, exhibited a PCE of up to 6.24%. In order to further reduce the bandgap of the polymer, two more Qx-based polymers, P9 and P10, with dithienobenzoquinoxaline and dithienopyridinequinoxaline as electron-deficient acceptors, were developed. Both P9 and P10 showed red-shifted absorption bands as compared to P7. Their film absorption edges reach up to 780 and 810 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the hole mobilities in these two polymers are as high as 5.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P9 and 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P10, respectively, as a result of their fused planar structure. By blending with PC71BM, the optimized solar cells exhibited a PCE of 6.1% for P9 and 3.2% for P10, respectively.78 Encouragingly, an IDT–thiophene–quinoxaline–thiophene copolymer (P11), in which meta-alkoxy side chains are located on the Qx unit, showed a high PCE of 7.5%.79 Balanced electron and hole mobilities of the P11:PC71BM blends is the key to realizing a good FF. Following this system, Chen et al. developed a new IDT-based fused ladder D–A conjugated polymer P12 (ref. 80) by introducing two fluorine atoms onto the para position of the phenyl rings of diphenylquinoxaline. The incorporation of fluorine atoms gives rise to a deeper HOMO energy level (−5.36 eV) and a higher Voc (0.9 V). The obtained PCE reached 4.6%. The energy levels, Eg and device performances of P1–P12 are listed in Table 1.

3. IDT polymers based on various side chains
By spin-coating or blade-coating a polymer solution (if materials are highly soluble in organic solvents), one can easily fabricate large-area thin film photovoltaic devices. In other words, for solution-processable PSCs the solubility of the polymer is one of the key factors affecting film morphology and device performance. As reported in many literature studies, the introduction of side chains onto the polymer backbone is the most effective way to tune and improve the polymer solubility since the side chains can induce the backbone twisting as well as increase the interchain distance. However, the size and shape of side chains usually play important roles in molecular orientation and π–π stacking of the polymers, and thereby influence the charge transport and the miscibility of the acceptors. As shown in Fig. 7, IDT-based polymers could be divided into two parts. One part concerns substitution of the IDT units by aromatic side chains; the other deals with the grafting of alkyl side chains on the IDT units. To provide more information on the influence of the side chains on the energy levels and photovoltaic performance of the polymer, Table 2 gives some experimental data of the polymers P13–P16.81–84 When compared with P13, the absorption peak of P14 shifts to the red by Δλ = 20 nm; the optical bandgap also decreases from 1.74 eV for P13 to 1.68 eV for P14. These results indicated that the replacement of the aromatic side chains with the alkyl side chains with less steric hindrance would make the polymer backbone easy to aggregate, which will be beneficial for charge transport. Eventually, the P14-based device displayed much higher efficiencies than the P13-based device. A high PCE of 6.1% was achieved with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 13.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 57%.82 A similar trend was also found in P15 and P16. By using the dodecyl side chains to replace the aromatic side chains, the resultant polymer P16 showed a significant smaller optical bandgap (1.37 eV) when compared to P15 (1.59 eV).83,84 In addition, it was also found that the hole mobility of P16 is four times higher than in P15, implying that the optoelectronic properties of polymers can be fine-tuned by choosing appropriate side chains.

4. IDT polymers based on various bridging atoms
Most of the high-performance polymers reported so far for state-of-the-art BHJ solar cells mainly rely on thiophene or thiophene-based heterocycles, in which heteroatoms can not only induce a variety of intermolecular interactions that are essential for achieving excellent device performance, but also could affect electron density and molecular planarity. A series of soluble IDT-BT based D–A copolymers were designed and synthesized, where a single bridging atom in the IDT unit varied from C to Si to Ge (Fig. 8).85–87 As a result, heavy atom substitution leads to the polymer being crystalline. Unlike the amorphous polymer P17, both P18 and P19 show clear indications of semi-crystalline behavior due to the longer C–Si or C–Ge bond relative to the C–C bond, which reduce the steric hindrance from the bulky alkyl side chains. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), a structural measurement technique wherein wide-angle scattering is collected, i.e., large values of the momentum transfer, is perfectly suited for the investigation of the material crystallinity of surfaces and thin films. By comparison with the carbon analogue P17 without any obvious crystallinity, formation of clearly semi-crystalline thin film with the π–π stacking distance of 3.93 Å was found in P19. This result indicated that bridging atom variation in the IDT unit could be used to control the molecular packing behavior of the polymers, but has a little effect on the optical bandgaps. Moreover, a strong correlation between the polymer molecular weight and the absorption and photovoltaic performance has demonstrated that the high molecular weight polymer could provide the best performance in those categories. From the device performance, one can see that the Ge-containing polymer displays a higher PCE of 6.5%, whereas the silicon-containing polymer only gives a PCE of 5.6%.
 Fig. 8  Chemical structures of IDT-based polymers with various bridging atoms. 
In addition to the above-mentioned three elements (C, Si, Ge) as the bridging atoms of the IDT unit, the more electron-donating nitrogen atom can also be the bridging heteroatom of the IDT unit. Incorporation of a strong electron-donating atom would further promote molecular orbital hybridization leading to a reduction in the bandgap of the polymer, and enhance the electron density of the ring. Additionally, the electron-rich nature of the polymer backbone would be favorable for good hole transport. For example, Donaghey et al.88 synthesized a novel electron-rich pyrroloindacenodithiophene (NIDT) in which two pyrrole units were inserted between the thiophene and benzene units. Stille copolymerization of the distannylated NIDT unit, with the electron-deficient dibrominated (BT), difluorobenzothiadiazole, thienopyrrolodione and 1,10-bithienopyrrolodione units afforded a series of low band gap semiconducting polymers, among which the BT-based polymer (P20) showed a pronounced shoulder on the long wavelength side of the absorption maximum, ongoing from solution to thin film, at around 830 nm, which could be indicative of planarization of the backbone and increased π-stacking. In contrast to P17–P19, P20 exhibited the lowest optical bandgap of 1.4 eV (cf. 1.7 eV for P17, 1.8 eV for P18 and 1.7 eV for P19). Its HOMO level (−4.9 eV) was significantly raised in comparison to the C and Si analogues with HOMO levels of −5.3 eV. These results demonstrated that replacing the bridging atom of the IDT unit with nitrogen had a significant effect on the molecular orbitals, resulting in a more planar and fully aromatic molecule. A one-pot cyclization approach to successfully construct a new NIDT structure was also reported by using palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2,2′-(2,5-dibromo-1,4-phenylene)bis(3-bromo-thiophene) with 1-octylnonylamine.89 After that, the same authors synthesized a new copolymer called PBDPTBT, which has a quite similar structure to that of P20, through microwave-assisted Stille polymerization. Its optical bandgap is 1.52 eV, slightly larger than that of P20. As expected, this polymer exhibited a promising hole FET mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a good on-off ratio of 1.5 × 105 under the optimal conditions of annealing at 120 °C for 10 min (for comparison purpose, P20 showed a mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a device with channel length 200 μm, annealed at 200 °C, and displayed an on-off ratio of 104). A BHJ solar cell with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDPTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al exhibited a decent PCE of 3.08%, with a Voc of 0.6 V, a Jsc of 10.34 mAcm2, and a FF of 49.7% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. The lower Voc is ascribed to the high-lying HOMO value. The energy levels, Eg and performance parameters of P17–P20 are listed in Table 3.

5. IDT polymers based on various conjugation lengths
Molecular design of conjugated polymers for high efficiency solar cells involves systematic and complicated engineering. The highly fused aromatic/heteroaromatic units, in which the covalently rigidified adjacent units could prevent rotational disorder to reduce reorganization energy, leading to improved charge carrier mobilities, enhance effective conjugation of the polymer backbone to facilitate electron delocalization.90,91 For example, in order to enhance charge mobility and device performance of the fused-ring polymers, the IDT unit can be further extended by incorporating two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units. The extended IDT system with two outward TT units replacing the thiophene moieties on IDT was designed to form a novel seven-ring indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) donor unit. The copolymerization of IDTT with difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) produced a polymer, P22, with longer effective conjugation and better planarity to improve charge mobility.48 For comparison purpose, the chemical structure of P3 formed by the copolymerization of IDT with DFBT74 is also given in Fig. 5. The extension of the effective conjugation length and planarity improve both chain packing and charge transport. In contrast to P3, the increased orbital overlap between HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P21 contributes to the enhanced absorption coefficient. In addition, P21 also showed higher hole and electron mobilities when compared to P3, suggesting that P21 has higher and more balanced charge mobility than P3 in the BHJ films. The PSC device derived from P21 showed an improved PCE of 7.03% with a large Voc of 0.95 V without using any additives or post-solvent/thermal annealing processes (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of IDT-based polymers with enhanced conjugation length. 
Extending the conjugation length in fused-ring ladder polymers is also an effective way to reduce the bandgap and improve charge transport for high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Although the cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT)-based conjugated polymers exhibited good red-shifted absorption and excellent hole-transporting properties, their quite high-lying molecular orbital energy levels limit the ability to achieve optimal open-circuit voltage in the resultant devices due to the very strong electron-donating ability of the CPDT unit. It would thus be ideal if CPDT can be fused with appropriate ladder-type units to make low band-gap polymers with high charge carrier mobility and good processability. In 2014, Jen and Chen's joint group designed a multi-ring indacenodithiophene-biscyclopentadithiophene (IDTCPDT) donor, where the central IDT core is fused with two CPDT units.42 This large-sized donor can result in such polymers with extended conjugation length and decreased HOMO energy level. This new donor was further lithiated and quenched with trimethyltin chloride to afford IDTCPDT-di-tin which was used to copolymerize with di-iodo-DFBT to give a novel polymer P22 with a lower optical bandgap of 1.59 eV and a hole mobility of 2.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. This material showed a much stronger intramolecular charge transfer effect compared to that of P3, accompanied by a significantly red-shifted absorption, owing to the stronger electron-donating ability of the IDTCPDT unit as well as an increased effective conjugation length and the reduced rotational disorder of the polymer chains. The BHJ device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P22:PC71BM/bis-C60/Ag showed a PEC of 6.46%, with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 14.59 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.59, under the illumination intensity of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm−2. The increased Jsc and FF values should be due to the better light-harvesting ability and higher charge mobility of P22. Very recently, our group also developed another low band gap polymer P23 based on a ten-number-ring ladder-type indacenodithiopheno-indacenodithiophene unit. This polymer exhibited red-shifted absorption and increased charge carrier mobility as a result of the improved planarity and π–π orbital overlap. The corresponding solar cell derived from P23 showed an improved PCE of 5.20% with a large Voc of 0.91 V.
As we mentioned earlier, variation of the bridging atom of the IDT unit could be used to control the molecular packing properties, but has a little effect on the optical bandgap of the resultant polymer. One materials design strategy that has garnered much attention in recent years is the incorporation of selenium in place of sulfur in the polymer backbone to produce the aromatic heterocycle selenophene. In contrast to thiophene, the reduced aromaticity of selenophene increases the ground state quinoid resonance character of the polymers, resulting in improved planarity, increased effective conjugation length, and decreased band gap. One potential problem with selenium-containing polymers arises from an increase in van der Waals forces due to the greater polarizability of selenium. This decreases the solubility of the polymers, relative to thiophene. As a result, it would often be difficult to obtain these polymers with high molecular weights. In order to overcome this problem, Jen et al.47 synthesized the first selenium-substituted IDT-based ladder-type donor–acceptor polymer P24 having molecular weights from 30.1 to 61.8 kg mol−1. This new polymer possessed improved absorption capability over its sulfur analogue in films, smaller optical bandgap (1.68 eV), as well as substantially higher hole/electron mobilities (0.15/0.064 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole/electron charge mobilities of P21 are 0.002 and 0.008 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). Improvement in both hole and electron mobilities (a two-order-of-magnitude increase in the hole mobility and an order-of-magnitude increase in the electron mobility when compared to P21) likely originates from Se–Se interactions as a result of the larger, more-polarizable Se atom as well as the improved orbital overlap from the more coplanar backbone. The enhanced material properties led to an improved PCE of 6.8%, a 13% efficiency improvement over the P21-based devices. Furthermore, upon selenium substitution in donor polymers, a significant increase in the density of charge-transfer states (NCT) correlated with lower Voc for BHJ photovoltaic devices (0.89 V for P24versus 0.97 V for P21).92 Both electronic coupling and NCT are tunable with small changes in the molecular structure, implying that controlling these parameters is a route to intelligent molecular design for higher efficiency photovoltaic devices. Table 4 gives the optical properties, energy levels and photovoltaic parameters of P21–P24.

As is known, the charge carrier mobility of SCMs plays an important role in affecting the performance of organic solar cells since it is directly related to charge transport and recombination. Considering that the intermolecular charge transport in conjugated polymers occurs by the hopping model through the overlapped π-electron orbits between the adjacent backbones, the enhancement of the probability of forming an effective interchain would be the key to improving their mobilities. An efficient way to improve the charge mobilities and also decrease the HOMO energy levels93 is design and prepare two dimensional (2D) conjugated structures. For this reason, Chen and coworkers synthesized a series of 2D IDT-based D–A copolymers (P25–P29) recently.94,95 In contrast to the one dimensional counterpart, the 2D polymers (P25) exhibited 0.27 eV lower HOMO energy levels, resulting in a high Voc of 0.95 V (Fig. 10). These results indicate that the 2D conjugated polymers have a great potential to achieve high Voc and better photovoltaic performance (Table 5).

6. Design and synthesis of the IDT-based non-fullerene acceptors
With the fast development of new organic semiconductor materials and the great improvements in the optimization of device architectures, organic photovoltaics based on composites of a conjugated polymer as the electron donor and a fullerene/fullerene derivative as the acceptor have seen a rapid progress in PCE over the past few years. A champion device efficiency of up to 10.8% has been achieved in a single junction device recently. In comparison with the polymer donor materials utilized for BHJ devices, the development of electron acceptor materials lags far behind the rate of innovation of PSCs. To date, electron acceptors used in the vast majority of PSCs are fullerene and its soluble derivatives (e.g., PC61BM, PC71BM, ICBA and others). These fullerene-based electron acceptors can offer several attractive advantages in the polymer:acceptor blends-based BHJ devices: (1) three dimensional electron transport; (2) multiple reversible electrochemical reductions; (3) high electron mobilities and (4) formation of both pure and mixed domains of the appropriate length scale for charge separation. On the other hand, however, disadvantages of these acceptors, including high cost of purification and production as well as relatively low yields, relatively narrow spectral range of optical absorption compared to the solar spectrum, limited energy level variability due to synthetic inflexibility, device instability resulting from an inherent tendency to undergo post-fabrication crystallization, and others, have also been found in the practical PSCs. In order to address the problems mentioned above, a series of new non-fullerene acceptors,96 including perylene diimide (PDI),97–99 naphthalene diimide (NDI),100–102 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),103 benzothiadiazole (BT),104 boron subphthalocyanine chlorides (BSubPc) and their derivatives,105–109 have been designed and synthesized over the recent years. Among these materials, PDI derivatives with high electron mobility and high electron affinity have been most widely investigated in PSCs. Although PCE over 7% has been achieved in the PDI-based BHJ device, formation of large-scale phase separations in the blend composition, which is due to the high planarity and strong intermolecular interactions of PDIs, easily restrains the charge separation and transport, leading to difficulty in further improving the PCE. A molecular design conundrum for PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors is thus how to effectively suppress the formation of large PDI domains without sacrificing the charge transport ability of PDI.
The greatest challenge facing the research and development of more efficient non-fullerene acceptors is the lack of excellent semiconductors that can integrate solution processability with suitable energy levels and electron-transport properties, as well as with good absorption in the visible and NIR regions. Among all the non-fullerene acceptors reported in the past several years, the promising IDT-based acceptor materials for high performance BHJ PSCs have attracted much attention due to their rigidified coplanar structures, which can efficiently restrain rotational disorder and consequently lower reorganization energy, 3D conformation that is very critical to non-fullerene materials, the fine-tuning of molecular and electronic properties by chemical modification, and huge potential applications. Zhan's group first developed a series of novel IDT-based non-fullerene materials.70–72,110–112 As shown in Fig. 11, for example, M1, in which the IDTT core is end-capped with electron-withdrawing motifs 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (INCN) groups, and with four 4-hexylphenyl groups substituted on it, possesses a strong and broad absorption spectrum with a maximum extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm, low LUMO and the highest HOMO energy levels (LUMO/HOMO: −3.83/−5.48 eV), good electron transport ability (2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 10−4 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for fullerene derivatives) and good miscibility with polymer donors. By blending the low bandgap polymer PTB7-TH (hole mobility: 2.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) with M1, a PCE of up to 6.8% was achieved without any post-treatment.70 Based on M1 as an acceptor, while using different polymer donors, Li113–115and Hou116–118 groups achieved very exciting results. The efficiency of single junction polymer solar cells had already reached up to 12%, which was even higher than the champion devices based on fullerene acceptors. Soon after, Zhan and co-workers also reported a new electron acceptor M2 based on the IDTT core, but using 2-thienyl groups as the side chain. The thienyl side chain can not only downshift molecular energy levels relative to phenyl side-chains, but also are expected to increase intermolecular interactions. As a result, M2 has stronger absorption and higher electron mobility than M1. The M2-based solar cell exhibits PCE as high as 9.6%, which is a promising alternative to those based on fullerene derivatives for high-performance PSCs.
 Fig. 11  Chemical structures of IDT-based non-fullerene acceptors. 
In contrast to M1 and M2, another type of ladder molecular structure based non-fullerene acceptors is A–D1–D2–D1–A. For this kind of molecule, its optical properties and charge carrier mobilities can be changed by modifying D1 or D2 structure. As an example, M3 reported by Zhan et al.70 exhibited broad absorption and high electron mobility. The PSC based on the blends of M3 and PTB7-TH, using a perylene diimide derivative as a cathode interlayer, showed a promising PCE of 6.31%. Very recently, a strong electron-donating alkoxy group was introduced into the D1 unit by Hou and his coworkers. As a result, M4 (ref. 119) displayed marked redshift absorption. By adopting PBDTTT-E-T as the donor, the M4-based fullerene-free PSC showed a maximum PCE of 8.4% with a relatively high Voc of 0.82 V. Moreover, a PCE of 10.7% was recorded in a tandem PSC based on M4. Li and co-workers developed a new selenium based non-fullerene acceptor M5.120 Selenium's larger and looser outermost electron cloud can improve orbital overlap with neighboring conjugated units, and consequently decrease the band gap and increase the carrier mobility. The PSCs based on M5 showed maximum PCE of 8.6%, with a high Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V and a FF of 62.0%. Interestingly, the trade-off features of Jsc and Voc existing in fullerene acceptor based solar cells have been minimized in this system, which is a promising way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs (Table 6).

By using an IDT unit as a core, Zhan et al. designed and synthesized an A–D–A type planar electron acceptor M6 (ref. 112) and M7 (ref. 110) with a relatively high electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 for M6 and 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M7. In addition, M6 and M7 also showed a relatively high LUMO energy level (−3.91 eV for M6 and −3.69 eV for M7). Both molecules adopted a nearly flat backbone configuration with n-hexyl side chains for M6 and hexylphenyl side chains for M7. By blending a middle bandgap polymer PDBT-T1 with M6, a high PCE of up to 8.7% was achieved without any post-treatment. The as-cast PDBT-T1:M6 blended film showed strong “face-on” π–π ordering and an appropriate phase separation scale. Importantly, these results challenge the traditional opinion on non-fullerene acceptors, which must have twisted backbones to suppress self-aggregation and large phase separation and to promote donor/acceptor miscibility. Compared with the electronic absorption spectrum of M7 in dilute chloroform solution, a red-shifted peak of 658 nm with a resolved shoulder was observed in its thin film spectrum. These findings indicate that self-organization behavior does exist in the film. The optical bandgap estimated from the absorption edge (736 nm) of the thin film is 1.68 eV. In contrast to PC61BM:P3HT blended film with a PCE of 3.71%, the BHJ cell based on M7:P3HT blended film gave a PCE of 5.12%. Furthermore, it was also found that the PCE values changed only 10% when varying the thickness of the active layer from 60 to 220 nm, which would be beneficial to scalable roll-to-roll fabrication and device reproducibility.
Very recently, Liao et al. developed a n-type organic molecule M8,121 based on a ten-number-ring ladder-type indacenodithiopheno indacenodithiophene unit (named as IDTIDT, like the “hand in hand” of the indacenodithiophene) as the core with electron withdrawing 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one as end groups. This large-sized IDTIDT can result in lower reorganization energy and narrower bandgap. The eight aryl chains on the highly coplanar aromatic rings of IDTIDT guarantee the solubility and 3D conformation of the molecule. End capping by the strong electron withdrawing unit 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one provides good n-type transport properties. M8 shows excellent planarity and enhanced effective conjugation length compared to previously reported fused-ring electron acceptors. When blended with the polymer PTB7-Th, a power conversion efficiency of 6.5% was achieved with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 14.49 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.48, an energy loss as low as 0.59 eV as well as an external quantum efficiency as high as 63%. The high Voc can be attributed to the very low energy loss of the donor/acceptor pair. M9 (ref. 122) was developed by Li and co-workers. Compared to M8, the new acceptor had improved planarity, increased electron mobility, and decreased bandgap. The PSCs based on M8 exhibited a high PCE of 8.02% with a Jsc of 15.16 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V and a FF of 0.58. Interestingly, it seems that the small HOMO offset resulting in a negligible driving force does not significantly limit the hole transfer in this system evidenced by PL quenching of 86% and EQE of 50–65%. This was the first time efficient hole transfer was achieved despite the HOMO offset being quite small. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of deepened tail states of the HOMO of the donor.
Most of the high-performance non-fullerene acceptors reported so far mainly rely on A–D–A structures. The LUMO levels of acceptors are mainly determined by the A groups, such as the INCN end group. But if the electronegativity of the A group can be reduced, it will be possible to obtain non-fullerene acceptors with an elevated LUMO level and hence improved Voc in PSCs. Hou et al. recently developed two novel methyl-modified INCN based acceptors M10 and M11.116 Due to the small size and weak donating nature of the methyl group, the resulting non-fullerene acceptors showed elevated LUMO levels without introducing too much steric hindrance. Thus, the devices based on M10 and M11 showed extremely high performance. The champion efficiency of 12.05% had been achieved based on M10 as an acceptor. Importantly, the Voc of the devices based on M10 and M11 clearly exhibited improvement compared to the devices based on M1, which indicated that introduction of the weak donor group into the A unit is an efficient way to further improve the performance of the PSCs.
Actually, alteration of flexible side-chains in shape, length, and branch position has not only a significant impact on the intermolecular self-assembly of the conjugated polymers, but also on non-fullerene acceptors. Li and co-workers reported an isomer of ITIC with meta-alkyl-phenyl substitution.115 Interestingly, from the grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies, M12 showed better defined scattering peaks and stronger intensities with a predominant face-on crystalline orientation compared to M1 (as shown in Fig. 12). These long-range order and greater preference for face on orientation lead to higher electron mobility (2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M12 and 1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M1). As a result, the M12 based device showed improved PCE of 11.77% with a Voc of 0.912 V, a Jsc of 18.31 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.55.

7. Summary
As promising conjugated frameworks that can suitably act as electron donors for PSCs, structurally well-defined IDT-based multi-fused ring ladder-type small molecules have exhibited a very bright prospect in photovoltaic applications. Until now, about 100 IDT-based conjugated polymers have already been designed and synthesized. Despite these remarkable results for conjugated polymer donors, the IDT building block also plays an important role in small molecule-based solar cells. Very recently, a great deal of efforts from different research groups has led to significant advances in IDT-based small molecule solar cells.123–127 The PCE value has already exceeded 9% in recently reported devices, which is comparable to the polymer solar cells.128 The rapid development of such systems has likely been facilitated by the high yields and versatile molecular structure (Fig. 13). By copolymerizing such monomers with different conjugated bridges and acceptors, one can achieve a number of IDT-based conjugated small molecules with planar backbones and good solution processability. Their light harvesting efficiency, charge transportation and molecular packing behaviors could be easily fine-tuned via innovative molecular design cum chemical synthesis strategies. Moreover, the small molecules may allow more reproducible synthesis and purification when compared to the polymers. Therefore, a promising way to further improve the performance of organic solar cells is to develop IDT-based small molecule donors to better understand the structure–property relationship.
 Fig. 13  Schematic diagram of typical IDT-based small molecule donor structures. 
Conjugated polymers based on IDT, which exhibited good solubility, broad absorption up to 800 nm and favorable planar backbones, have been widely used to fabricate fullerene-based PSCs. The achieved highest photovoltaic performance of IDT-based donors is almost close to 8%. Besides IDT-based donors, IDT-based non-fullerene acceptors, which are one of the greatest potential promising alternatives to fullerene-based electron acceptors, have also been developed and applied to construct BHJ solar cells recently due to their rigidified coplanar structures, 3D conformation, and tunable molecular structures as well. The aromatic fused-ring blocks efficiently restrain rotational disorder and consequently lower reorganization energy. However, further development of IDT-based electron acceptors still requires a better understanding of the relationships between the molecular structure, material microstructure, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties that are currently available. Future work should be focused on the development of new structures resulting from the modification of the IDT core, especially IDT-based N-type semiconductors with high electron affinities.
