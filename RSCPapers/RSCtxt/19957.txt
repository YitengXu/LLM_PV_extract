    , Accepted 21st November 2013First published on 22nd November 2013AbstractA cheap and easily-available organosulfur compound, guanidine thiocyanate, has been used to synthesize graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a thermally-induced desulfurization and polymerization of the precursor. Photocatalytic activity experiments demonstrated that the g-C3N4 synthesized from guanidine thiocyanate exhibited a much higher H2 evolution rate than the reference sample prepared from dicyanamide. Further improvement in the activity was achieved by optimization of the condensation temperature. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the samples synthesized at a high temperature of 700 °C feature a high crystallinity and a low density of surface defects, with an enhanced optical absorbance extending to the visible light region. As a result, the sample prepared at 700 °C has been found to be 7 times more reactive towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution than the sample polymerized at the normal temperature of 550 °C. Other guanidine halides have also been applied to synthesize g-C3N4 materials, and the structure and activity of the resultant g-C3N4 were compared to the carbon nitride polymer from guanidine thiocyanate.
1 Introduction
The replacement of depletive fossil fuels by clean, sustainable energy sources has been recommended as a promising solution to address global energy and environmental issues.1 Various renewable energies have emerged in the last few decades, including marine tidal energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, wind energy, wave energy, biomass and solar energy.2 Among these, abundant solar energy is of notable importance due to its properties of easy storage and transportation after being converted to chemical fuels, such as hydrogen and hydrocarbons.3 In particular, the production of hydrogen by water splitting via sunlight has been widely investigated due to its vast potential to convert solar energy and water into hydrogen gas as the lightest, clean energy carrier for the future.4
Since the first report of hydrogen evolution through the photo-assisted electrochemical splitting of water on the Pt–TiO2 cell by Fujishima and Honda,5 the design and preparation of highly stable and active semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been considered as one of the most important approaches to capture, convert and store solar energy in the form of the chemical bond of hydrogen gas.6 During the past few decades, a number of solid-state inorganic materials have been reported for splitting water into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, either in the ultraviolet light region or visible light region.6,7 Some materials have successfully achieved overall water splitting at a high quantum yield of 56% at 270 nm as in the case of the NiO and La2O3 co-modified NaTaO3 photocatalyst, highlighting the high feasibility of water photosplitting technology as a future clean energy resource.8 To achieve water splitting more economically, there is a growing urgency to search for a low-cost and earth-abundant material responsive to the visible spectrum, with high activity and stability over a sustained period, but it is still a significant challenge.
Recently, significant progress in heterogeneous photocatalysis has been made using metal-free, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a light-absorbing material to mediate electron and energy transfers for artificial photosynthesis.9 Binary carbon nitride materials are not new materials and their history can indeed be dated back to the 1830s, but only in the past few years have they become a rising star on the horizon of materials science, attracting the worldwide research interest of physicists, chemists, and material scientists owing to their unique properties, as well as their promising applications in optical electronics, mechanic fields, tribology and catalysis.10 It has been reported that pristine g-C3N4 materials have low specific surface areas of <10 m2 g−1 and low catalytic activity. To date, a variety of strategies have been extensively employed to alter their electronic structure and texture so as to improve their photocatalytic performance.11 One prominent way has been achieved by introducing heteroatoms or incorporating appropriate electron-deficient and electron-rich motifs in an alternating fashion into the covalent carbon nitride architectures.12 Another prospective approach involves the introduction of porosity into a carbon nitride material by a hard-templating approach to maximize its surface area, which has also been proved to significantly enhance photocatalytic function.13 It was recently shown that gaseous microbubbles produced during the solution processing of carbon nitride polymers have been successfully used as a soft-template to fabricate a porous polymeric microstructure.14 Ammonia generated through the direct thermally-induced polymerization of urea was used to create nanopores in g-C3N4 frameworks.15 Our group have sought to use simple sulfur-containing organic and inorganic compounds, such as trithiocyanuric acid, thiourea, or ammonium thiocyanate as the precursors for the one-pot production of porous g-C3N4 photocatalysts at high temperatures.12c,16 It was demonstrated that the self-generated sulfur-containing gases have a pronounced positive effect in the condensation process of g-C3N4, modifying both the electronic structure and texture of g-C3N4. These works give us a deep impression that the precursor containing other elements besides the C, N and H elements would provide an extra chemical method to facilitate the thermal condensation process of g-C3N4 and enable structural alternation. It should, furthermore, be necessary to expand this significant approach in general for the synthesis of functional carbon nitride materials for efficient utilization of solar energy in a sustainable fashion. Therefore, the search for new precursors containing foreign heteroatoms for carbon nitride synthesis has sparked much interest. In recent years, although there has been some research investigating new precursors for the synthesis of carbon nitride photocatalysts,17 these works are still scarce.
Recently, Schnick et al. proved the existence of melamine as an important intermediate during the thermal condensation of guanidinium tricyanomelaminate as well as guanidinium dicyanamide.18 The purpose of their work was to find the relevance of their thermal reactivity with respect to the structural identity of g-C3N4, which indicates that guanidinium based chemicals could be converted to molecular building blocks that can further undergo assembly and cross-linking to form covalent carbon nitride networks under certain driving forces, like thermal energy. The wide choice of counter anions of guanidinium-based materials provides additional chemical controls in the synthesis of new carbon nitride structures with desired functions.
In this work, we envision that derivatives of guanidinium salts, e.g., halides, could also be utilized as starting materials for the chemical synthesis of g-C3N4. Herein, the low-cost, widely available, and environmentally benign compound, guanidinium thiocyanate has been used for the preparation of g-C3N4 materials via a thermally-induced desulfurization and condensation approach. The effect of reaction temperature was discussed in this article. The photocatalytic activities of these materials were examined over the hydrogen evolution reaction. Other guanidinium halides were also used as the starting materials and the resultant carbon nitride catalysts were compared to that from guanidinium thiocyanate with respect to the crystal and chemical structures as well as photocatalytic performance.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Guanidine thiocyanate, guanidinium sulphate, guanidine hydrochloride, guanidine carbonate, dicyandiamide and triethanolamine were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. H2PtCl6·6H2O was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts
The g-C3N4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a classic and facile method, which involved directly heating guanidine thiocyanate (GS–CN) at different temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere and then tempering at the same temperatures for 2 h. The catalysts thus prepared were denoted as GS–CNT (where T represents the calcination temperature). Different guanidine precursor salts (such as guanidinium sulphate, guanidine hydrochloride and guanidine carbonate), and dicyandiamide (DCDA) were also heated to 550 °C under the same preparation conditions. The materials obtained from different guanidine precursor salts were successively named HSO–CN, HCl–CN, HCO–CN for convenience, and the material obtained from dicyandiamide was denoted as D–CN for the reference samples.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 irradiation, λ = 1.5406 Å with an accelerating voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Diffuse Reflectance (DR) UV-visible spectra were measured on a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis spectrophotometer with barium sulfate as the reference sample. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected with a Nicolet Magna 670 FTIR spectrometer, and the samples were mixed with KBr at a concentration of ca. 1 wt%. FTIR measurements were conducted on a homemade IR cell closed on each side with CaF2 windows to detect the gas spectra in a static vacuum system. A 100 mg portion of the guanidine thiocyanate sample was added into the tubular elongation of the gas cell, which was evacuated under dynamic vacuum (10−4 Torr) at room temperature for 3 h and subsequently closed by Young valves, and then heated to 773 K by means of a furnace equipped with a temperature controller. Once the designated temperature was reached, the infrared spectra of the gas phase were recorded regularly on a Nicolet 670 FTIR spectrometer with a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans. Elemental analysis results were collected using a Vario MICRO instrument. Raman spectra were recorded on a HR 800 system, HORIBA Jobin Yvon, and employed for the analysis of the chemical structure of the catalyst. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a Thermo ESCALAB250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα line source (200 W). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of surface adventitious carbon. The thermal stability of the as-prepared catalysts was verified using a thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere (Netzsch STA 449C). Throughout this study, the flow of nitrogen gas was fixed at 25 mL min−1 and the heating rate used was 10 °C min−1. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of samples treated initially at 453 K for 8 h were calculated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at 77 K with Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument. Electrochemical measurements were conducted with a BASi epsilon electrochemical system in a conventional three electrode cell, using a Pt plate as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity
Reactions were carried out in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a glass closed gas system. H2 production was performed by dispersing 50 mg of catalyst powder in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing triethanolamine (10 vol%) as a sacrificial electron donor. 3 wt% Pt was loaded on the surface of the carbon nitride sample by the in situ photodeposition method using H2PtCl6. The reaction solution was evacuated several times to remove air completely prior to irradiation under a 300 W Xenon lamp and a water filter. The wavelength of the incident light was controlled by applying an appropriate long-pass cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at room temperature by the flow of cooling water during the reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a 5 Å molecular sieve column, using argon as the carrier gas.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the graphitic packing structures for the GS–CNT materials (see Experimental section for the detailed synthesis and notation of samples) obtained under different temperatures at 450–700 °C. The typical peaks are observed at around 2θ values of 13.0 (100) and 27.4° (002) for all the samples, corresponding to the in-plane periodicity of the nitride pores and the interplanar stacking reflection of the conjugated planes, respectively. It is stressed that a weak new peak at 25.6° appears with the GS–CN450 catalyst, which points to incomplete condensation of it. When the sintering temperature increases, the interplanar stacking distance of the aromatic units layer d = 0.329 nm is compressed to d = 0.322 nm, as evidenced by the (002) peak shifting from 27.0° to 27.7° (as illustrated in Fig. S1†). This fact reveals that the interlayer stacking order of GS–CNT can be improved and its crystal structure tends to become more stable by thermal treatment at high temperatures.19 In addition, the (002) peak becomes narrower and stronger with increasing temperature, further indicating that the crystallinity of the GS–CNT catalysts increases with increasing temperature. The weak peak at 13.0° also increases with increasing temperature, cross-validating the above-mentioned results. Nevertheless, when the treatment temperature is higher than 700 °C, nearly complete decomposition occurred.

A similar structural evolution trend can also be inferred from the FT-IR analysis (Fig. 2) of the catalysts condensed at different temperatures. For the GS–CN450 catalyst, we can not observe the strong absorptions near 2070 cm−1 corresponding to SCN band vibrations,20 suggesting that complete desulfurization takes place at/above this temperature. However, the low temperature condensation of the material results in the weak vibration of the s-heptazine units at 1200–1600 cm−1 and 800 cm−1. This problem can be solved by increasing the condensation temperature to facilitate the condensation of the g-C3N4 network, as justified by the strongest absorption in this region for the GS–CN700 catalyst (in good agreement with the XRD results). The broad peaks at around 3100–3400 cm−1 are assigned to stretching vibration modes for the –NH and –OH of the adsorbed H2O from the air. As shown in Fig. 2, the peaks of GS–CN700 in this region become sharper than those of GS–CN450, which can be attributed to more adsorbed H2O on the GS–CN700 catalyst surface because of its larger specific surface area (as evidenced by Fig. 5(b)).

To further probe the chemical structure of the catalysts, we carried out Raman spectra measurements using a 325 nm UV laser excitation with the catalysts mounted on glass slides. Fig. 3 shows an intense, broad, asymmetric feature in the range of 1200–1700 cm−1, which indicates C–N stretching vibrations and is analogous to the “G” and “D” band profiles observed for structurally disordered graphitic carbon-based materials.21 No bands were observed in the 2000–2500 cm−1 region, indicating the absence of any triply bond CN units or NCN groups within the carbon nitride structure.21c However, two sharp peaks observed at 980 and 690 cm−1 proved the presence of a heptazine ring structure.22 The 980 cm−1 peak can be attributed to the symmetric N-breathing mode of heptazine units, whereas the second peak at 690 cm−1 is a doubly degenerate mode related to in-plane bending vibrations of the heptazine linkages.23 These characteristics are observed for all catalysts and are better defined when the catalysts were prepared at high temperature.

The chemical structure and composition of GS–CN550 were further revealed by XPS measurement. The survey XPS spectrum of GS–CN550 (Fig. 4) reveals the presence of C, N, and O elements with a surface C/N atomic ratio of 0.84 in a semi-quantitative fashion, which is higher than the nominal theoretical value of 0.75 for bulk g-C3N4 (as illustrated in Table 1). No signal assigned to the sulfur species is observed,24 suggesting that the function of the sulfur species in these CN precursors is more to mediate the g-C3N4 condensation/polymerization rather than to dope/modify the carbon nitride matrix during our thermal condensation process. The weak O 1s signal is presumably due to the absorbed H2O molecules on the GS–CN550 surface, as also observed by the above FT-IR analysis. To gain insight into the chemical bonding among the atoms in GS–CN550, the high-resolution spectra of C 1s, N 1s and S 2p are also shown in Fig. 4. There are mainly peaks due to two carbon species present in the C 1s spectrum, and the corresponding binding energies are determined to be 284.6 eV and 288.1 eV. The former peak is typically assigned to sp2 C–C bonds, whereas the latter is identified as sp2-bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN), which is regarded as the major carbon species in the g-C3N4 polymer. Meanwhile, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four components centered at about 398.7, 400.3, 401.4 and 404.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 4(c)). The main signal shows the occurrence of the sp2-bonded N involved in the triazine rings (C–NC, 398.7 eV) and tertiary nitrogen groups (N–(C)3, 400.3 eV) in about the expected ratio. Both of them, together with the aforementioned sp2 C (N–CN), contexture the s-heptazine heterocyclic ring (C6N7) units as elementary building blocks of the g-C3N4 polymers. Another weak peak at 401.4 eV indicates the presence of amino functional groups (C–N–H), originating from the defective condensation of heptazine substructures. In addition, the very weak peak at 404.2 eV is attributed to the charging effects or positive charge localization in the heterocycles.25 It is still emphasized that there is no signal attributed to S 2p (2p3/2 = 164.0 eV) species, even in the carefully-repeated scanning spectrum of S 2p in high-resolution, cross-validating the elemental analysis (EA) results (Table S1†). The difference in the C/N atomic ratio of the catalysts as revealed by XPS and EA analysis comes from the fact that the XPS measurement is a semi-quantitative surface analysis technique. It typically leads to overestimation of the C/N ratio because nitrogen is easier to release as inert N2 gas from the carbon nitride under strong photoelectron beam irradiation. Fig. S2† shows the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of GS–CN550 and GS–CN700. We can calculate the component distribution of N species according to the deconvoluted results, and find that the percentage of the tertiary nitrogen (400.3 eV) components decreases in the order GS–CN700 (20.87%) > GS–CN550 (19.30%). The enhancement in tertiary nitrogen components suggests that the polymerization degree of g-C3N4via full or partial condensation increases.26 Thus, GS–CN700 possesses the higher degree of polymerization . This result is in good agreement with that of the XRD and FTIR analysis results.

Fig. 5 shows the N2 adsorption and desorption analysis and the corresponding surface area of the GS–CNT samples synthesized at different temperatures, together with the thermal analysis of GS–CN550 and GS–CN700 in flowing nitrogen gas. It can be seen that the decomposition of as-prepared GS–CNT occurs at the initial temperature of 550 °C, and the weight of the catalysts decreased rapidly between 600 and 700 °C, eventually resulting in no residue of the material at 750 °C, thus pointing to the complete decomposition and/or volatilization. However, this process was accompanied by the significant enlargement of specific surface area and the generation of nanopores. As evidenced by Fig. 5(a) and (b), a great enhancement of the BET surface area (SBET) as well higher N2 adsorption amount suggested that the GS–CN700 catalyst possessed typical mesopores.

TEM images gave a deeper insight into the thermal decomposition behavior and morphology (Fig. 6). In stark contrast with the GS–CN550 sample, g-C3N4 sheets with much smaller thin nanosheets as well as a worm-like porous structure are visible in the 700 °C condensed catalyst (GS–CN700), owing to the drastic decomposition/delamination of g-C3N4 at higher temperatures (in agreement with the TG results). The merits of this thermal decomposition create the large surface area and the thin nanosheets as well as the porous structure, which have already been demonstrated to be beneficial for photocatalytic activities.27

The identification of the decomposition gas allows us to elucidate the formation process of g-C3N4 during the thermal condensation of guanidine thiocyanate. As illustrated by the in situ FT-IR spectra of the off-gases (Fig. 7), there exist four major gas species in the thermal decomposition products in our instrument detection range, namely, carbon disulfide (CS2) with absorption peaks centered at 1540 and 2171 cm−1, isothiocyanic acid (HNCS) with absorption peaks at 2070 and 2041 cm−1, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) with absorption peaks at 713 cm−1 and ammonia (NH3) with absorption peaks at 3331, 1635, 966, and 925 cm−1.
 Fig. 7  Temperature-dependent FTIR gas spectra collected between 423 and 773 K (back to front). The peak assignments are indicated by arrows. 
Based on the above results, we proposed a tentative formation mechanism for graphitic carbon nitride synthesized from guanidine thiocyanate at high temperature, as demonstrated in Scheme 1. Guanidine thiocyanate can be considered to comprise two components (as illustrated in Scheme 1). The thermal decomposition of guanidine thiocyanate is initiated by the thiocyanic acid (NCSH) that can be partially converted to its isomer, HNCS (as evidenced by the HNCS absorption at the initial temperature of 423 K). Then the two components, guanidine (1) and thiocyanic acid (2), react simultaneously to form different products. Guanidine (1) trimerizes to melamine ((6), 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine) in an exothermic reaction releasing gaseous ammonia. Thiocyanic acid (2) is less stable and dimerizes to (3) that decomposes rapidly into carbon disulfide (CS2) and cyanamide, (NH2–CN). Cyanamide then 1) decomposes to ammonia and hydrogen cyanide and 2) dimerizes to dicyandiamide (4) that reacts via an intermediate (5) to form melamine (6). At higher temperature, melamine (6) further reacts to form condensation products with higher molecular mass, e.g. melam, melem or melon, accompanied by the volatile gas NH3, and finally resulting in the formation of a graphitic carbon nitride framework.

The optical properties of the GS–CNT samples were studied by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence experiments. In Fig. 8, all GS–CNT catalysts show the typical absorption pattern of an organic semiconductor with a strongly expressed band gap adsorption at about 430 nm, due to the excitation of electrons from the valance band to the conduction band of a carbon nitride semiconductor. Their absorption edges are slightly affected by changing the polymerization temperature. Firstly, the band gap energy decreased from 2.82 eV to 2.70 eV with an increase in temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C, owing to the extension of electron delocalization in the aromatic sheets with enhanced structural connections, somewhat similar to the bathochromic shift effect in J-aggregates.13b,28 Further increasing the condensation temperature leads to a slight blue-shift of the optical absorption, for instance, a bigger band gap of 2.89 eV is determined for GS–CN700. This hypsochromic-shift performance is referred to as a size-dependent increase in the band gap due to the quantum confinement effects, because a thinner (or smaller) nanosheet structure is clearly observed in the TEM image (illustrated in Fig. 6). However, the more condensed g-C3N4 structure that induces the H-aggregates’ formation at high temperature is also partially responsible for the hypsochromic-shift in the optical spectrum. Interestingly, only catalysts synthesized at 700 °C showed an additional absorption near 500 nm that is assigned to n–π* electronic transitions involving the N lone pairs.23 These are forbidden for planar symmetric heptazine structures but become allowed as increased condensation causes distortion of the polymeric units.

Fig. 9 shows the PL spectra of different samples using excitation light of 400 nm, showing that the PL intensity increases with increasing temperature from 450 °C to 500 °C, due to the gradual formation of a semiconductor band structure. Then, the PL spectra becomes less intense with further increases in the heating temperatures. Drastic quenching of the photoluminescence intensity of GS–CN700 is observed, implying that the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes are greatly suppressed in the GS–CN700 catalyst. This phenomenon, attributed to the presence of thermally-induced nanostructure, can cause electron relocalization on surface terminal sites, which is believed to promote photocatalytic redox functions.13a,29 Generally, the intensity of the PL peak is also related to the bulk and surface defect concentration of the catalysts.

The charge generation and separation within g-C3N4–water interfaces is the basis for photocatalytic water splitting. The photoelectrochemistry setup provides a simple but powerful tool to monitor this process. Powder catalysts are made as film electrodes on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glass. Then, these film electrodes are immersed into a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, under visible light illumination to generate photocurrents. Fig. 10 shows the transient cathodic photocurrent responses via several on–off cycles for GS–CN550 and GS–CN700 photoelectrodes at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under visible light irradiation, which may directly correlate with the recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Both of the catalysts exhibit prompt and reproducible photocurrent responses upon each illumination. When the irradiation was interrupted, the photocurrent rapidly dropped to almost zero (steady-state value). The photocurrent reverted to the original value once the light was switched back on again. The photocurrent of the GS–CN700 catalyst is about 2.2 times higher than that of the GS–CN550. We believe that such enhancement of the photocurrent probably originates from its better condensation and thinner nanosheets, which could result in better separation of photoinduced charge carriers and more efficient electron transfer at the interfaces.

To gain deeper insights into the charge transport behavior, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. In a Nyquist diagram, the radius of each arc is associated with the charge-transfer process at the corresponding electrode/electrolyte interface with a smaller radius corresponding to a lower charge-transfer resistance. Fig. 11 reflects the fact that the impedance arc radius for the GS–CN700 catalyst is smaller than that of GS–CN550, indicating that GS–CN700 possesses enhanced conductive capability compared with GS–CN550. These results are understandable because GS–CN700 has much thinner nanosheets and nanopores as well as a higher surface area.

The photocatalytic activities of the GS–CNT catalysts were evaluated using the hydrogen evolution reaction. As presented in Fig. 12(a), the H2 production rate increases with each increment of the calcining temperature. The GS–CN700 catalyst shows the greatest activity, and the H2 evolution rate reaches 172 μmol h−1, which is 7 times as high as that for GS–CN550, again reflecting the significance of heat treatment for photocatalyst synthesis. The specific activity normalized to surface area of GS–CN700 still exceeds that for GS–CN550 by a factor of 1.3, indicating that, besides the enlarged surface area, the alternated electronic structure also contributes to enhanced photocatalytic activity. To test the GS–CN700 catalyst stability, a 16 h experiment with intermittent evacuation every 4 h under visible light was performed (Fig. 12(b)). The system produced a total amount of 2.7 mmol of hydrogen gas during the course of the 16 h irradiation without noticeable catalyst deactivation. No N2 evolution was evidenced, indicating the strong binding of N within the covalent structure, even in the higher temperature treatment environment. The turnover number in terms of the total molar amount of H2 evolved with respect to the molar quantity of the used catalyst exceeds 5 after 16 h of reaction, indicating that the reaction indeed proceeds catalytically.

To support the idea that the H2 production proceeds via a photocatalytic process initiated by light absorption on the GS–CN700 catalyst, a wavelength-dependent H2 evolution experiment was performed. In Fig. 13, the amount of H2 evolution decreases with increasing wavelength, and the longest wavelength available for H2 evolution is found to be 550 nm. The obtained profile of H2 evolution corresponds well to the UV-vis spectrum of GS–CN700. These data strongly demonstrate that the H2-evolution process is primarily induced by light-excitation of electrons in the carbon nitride polymer.

The method using guanidine thiocyanate as a starting material for the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride can also be extended to other guanidine halide compounds. This approach widens the range of available precursors for synthesizing graphitic carbon nitride materials. The photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution of the catalysts obtained from different guanidine compounds, together with D–CN (traditional carbon nitride synthesized using dicyandiamide as the starting material) catalyst for comparison is shown in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. S3,† compared to D-CN, no H2 evolution improvement was observed for those catalysts obtained from the other guanidine precursors except for guanidine thiocyanate, while the HCl–CN exhibited comparable catalytic performance. This result indicates that the anions of the guanidine salts are critical for affecting the structure and thus causing the activity of H2 evolution (another investigation is being undertaken to examine the effect of the different guanidine precursors on the H2 evolution rate). The XRD results (Fig. S4†) revealed that all of the guanidine halides can be converted to graphitic carbon nitrides in the thermally-induced polymerization process.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, g-C3N4 photocatalysts have been successfully synthesized from guanidine thiocyanate at different temperatures in nitrogen gas. The presence of the sulfur species offers an extra chemical control for the synthesis of g-C3N4 networks, accelerating the polymerization/condensation of the carbon nitride network. The condensation temperature was found to affect the formation of g-C3N4 greatly. Increasing the heating temperature to 700 °C not only favors the g-C3N4 formation, but also induces a structure peeling effect of the catalyst itself, in situ, creating nanopores and enhancing the special surface area in the bulk carbon nitrides. These integrative factors synergistically result in the overall drastic photoactivity improvement of GS–CN700 towards catalytic hydrogen generation with visible light. Therefore, one can easily optimize the textural, electronic and optical properties of carbon nitride semiconductors by the combination of a sulfur-mediated synthesis and the thermally-induced generation of nanostructures. It is hoped that our work could provide a new precursor for g-C3N4 photocatalysts that can, in principle, be implemented in other applications of catalysis and photocatalysis, such as selective organic photosynthesis and environmental protection.
