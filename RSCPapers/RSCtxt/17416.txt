, Accepted 4th December 2014First published on 4th December 2014AbstractThe metal chalcogenides are excellent choices as absorbers and buffer-layers in thin film solar cells. Versatile chemical approaches provide endless possibilities to prepare metal sulfide precursor solutions. Recently, Cu2ZnSnS(Se)4 thin films have played an important role in fabricating low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells. Here, we present a robust and low-cost 1,2-ethanedithiol/ethanolamine/2-methoxyethanol ternary solution process to prepare Cu2ZnSnS4 precursor solution and high-quality Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films. Low-cost Cu2O, ZnO and SnO are used as the raw materials, which can be easily dissolved in the 2-methoxyethanol solution of 1,2-ethanedithiol and ethanolamine at room temperature in air. By tuning the composition of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin film with a selenization process, an active-area power conversion efficiency of 7.34% has been achieved for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cell.
Introduction
Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) compounds with a kesterite structure have emerged as nontoxic and low-cost absorber materials for next generation thin film solar cells,1–5 and have received increasing attention due to a lab cell efficiency as high as 12.6%.6 Various deposition approaches have been reported to fabricate high-quality CZTSSe absorber layers, including thermal co-evaporation,7 sputtering,8 pulsed laser deposition,9 electrodeposition,10 nanocrystal-based ink approach,11–15 nanocrystal/molecule hybrid precursor ink approach16,17 and molecule precursor solution process.6,18–26 These remarkable approaches have obtained admirable advances in the deposition methods, thin film quality and energy conversion efficiency.1–5 Unlike the CuIn(Ga)Se2 solar cells, the chemical solution-based deposition approaches have the outstanding advantages in energy conversion efficiency for CZTSSe solar cells, which have a great potential for lowering the fabrication costs.5 The most successful solution approach is hydrazine-based solution deposition technology which was first reported by Mitzi et al., i.e. a hydrazine-based particle-containing slurry method,16 then Yang and co-workers developed a hydrazine-based true solution approach.27 Using the hydrazine-based molecular precursor solution process, Mitzi's group reported a world record efficiency of 12.6% for CZTSSe solar cells.6
Based on the coordination mode of metal and ligand, the molecular solution-based approach for CZTSSe solar cell could be classified as four types, i.e., hydrazine-based solution process,6,27 metal salt/thiourea-based solution process,21–24 dithiocarbamate-based solution process25 and thioglycolic acid/ethanolamine-based solution process.26 In this work, we propose a novel and robust solution approach to prepare CZTS precursor solution based on the 1,2-ethanedithiol/ethanolamine/2-methoxyethanol ternary solution system. In the previous works, several groups have exerted huge efforts to study the metal/1,2-ethanedithiol coordination compounds. Holm and co-works first reported the synthesis and structural characterizations of a series of metal/1,2-ethanedithiol complexes in 1986.28 The metal and 1,2-ethanedithiol formed mono-, bi- and trinuclear species by the reaction of Na2(C2H4S2) and metal salts ([Ti(C2H4S2)3]2−, [Cr(C2H4S2)2]2−, [Mn(C2H4S2)2]2−, [V2(C2H4S2)4]2−, [Co(C2H4S2)2]2−, [Co(C2H4S2)2]−, [Zn(C2H4S2)2]2−, [Cd(C2H4S2)2]2−, [Mn2(C2H4S2)4]2−, [Fe2(C2H4S2)4]2−, [Ni2(C2H4S2)3]2−, and [Cu3(C2H4S2)3]3−). After two years, Holmes and co-works synthesized five-coordinated tin compounds [(C2H4S2)2SnSCH2]2[Et3NH]2 using RSnCl3, Na2(C2H4S2) and Et3N+Cl−.29 More recently, Brutchey's group reported a solution approach to rapidly dissolve a series of V2VI3 chalcogenides (V = As, Sb, Bi; VI = S, Se, Te), antimony, tin, tellurium, and selenium, then obtained high-quality chalcogenides thin films using 1,2-ethanedithiol/ethylenediamine binary solvent mixture.30,31 It is worth mentioning that Zhang and co-workers demonstrated the dissolution of elemental Se in oleylamine by dodecanethiol reduction at room temperature, which showed that the thiol and amine mixture solution has a marked dissolving capacity for amorphous selenium powder.32 Here, we present a novel ternary solvent mixture comprised of ethanolamine, 1,2-ethanedithiol and 2-methoxyethanol, which possesses the remarkable ability to rapidly dissolve Cu2O, ZnO and SnO, forming the homogeneous CZTS molecular precursor solution at room temperature. By the standard CZTSSe solar cell fabrication processes using CZTS molecular precursor solution, a power conversion efficiency of 7.34% has been achieved.
Experimental section
Materials
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, 99.99%), zinc oxide (ZnO, 99.99%), and tin(II) oxide (SnO, 99.9%) were purchased from Aldrich. Ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 99%), 1,2-ethanedithiol (HSCH2CH2SH, 99%) and 2-methoxyethanol (HOCH2CH2OCH3, 99%), selenium (Se, 99.9%), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4, 99%), and thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%) were obtained from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Preparation of CZTS precursor solution
First, 4 mL of 2-methoxyethanol, 2 mL of 1,2-ethanedithiol, and 2 mL of ethanolamine were mixed in a 15 mL serum bottle under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, Cu2O (0.252 g, ∼1.76 mmol), ZnO (0.195 g, ∼2.4 mmol) and SnO (0.270 g, ∼2.0 mmol) were loaded into the bottle, then kept stirring until all solid was dissolved. Finally, the CZTS precursor solution was diluted to a total metal concentration of 0.66 M with 2-methoxyethanol, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min prior to spin-casting. All of the procedures were conducted in air.
Deposition of CZTSSe absorber layer and fabrication of solar cell device
CZTS precursor solution was spun on a Mo-coated glass sheet (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm, with ∼1 μm thick Mo) at 2500 rpm for 15 s, followed by a sintering process on a 320 °C ceramic preheated hot plate for 1 min to form CZTS nanocrystal thin film. CZTS nanocrystal thin film with a thickness of ∼2 μm was obtained by repeating eight spin-casting/sintering cycles. Subsequently, four films and 200 mg of selenium powder were sealed in a graphite box (∼60 mm in diameter and ∼50 mL in volume, Fig. S1†) under nitrogen atmosphere, followed by a selenization process at 540 °C for 10 min in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (MTI, OTF-1200X-4-RTP) under nitrogen flow (120 mL min−1). The solar cell device was completed by chemical bath depositing ∼60 nm of CdS thin film (100 mL of deionized H2O), 12.5 mL of NH4OH, 50 mL of cadmium sulfate (0.006 M), and 50 mL of thiourea (3.0 M) in a 65 °C water bath for 15 min, RF-sputtering ∼60 nm of intrinsic ZnO (sputtering power of 100 W, sputtering pressure of 0.5 Pa, and sputtering time of 5 min), DC-sputtering 300 nm of indium tin oxide (ITO) (sputtering power of 100 W, sputtering pressure of 1 Pa, and sputtering time of 3.5 min), and thermally evaporating ∼2 μm of Al grid electrode (thermal evaporation current of 50 A, evaporation time of 2 min). The four devices (an active area of 0.425 cm2 for each cell (95% of total device area)) were isolated by mechanical scribing with a tungsten needle (see Fig. S2†).
Characterizations
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA/DSC 1 STARe of Mettler-Toledo. The thickness of the thin film was measured by a step profiler (AMBIOS, XP-100). The XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010). The sample for EDX measurement was prepared on a glass slide. Raman spectra were recorded using microscopic confocal Raman spectrometry (Labram HR 800) with an excitation of 532 nm laser light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by an ESCALAB-MKII 250 XPS (VG Co., U.K.) using an Al Kα X-ray source. J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Abet Sun 2000; AM 1.5) by a homemade probe station. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE). The external quantum efficiency curve was measured using a Zolix SCS100 QE system equipped with a 150 W xenon light source and a lock-in amplifier.
Results and discussion
Previously, we have reported that many types of metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal salts, and so forth, can be easily dissolved in the ethanol solution of butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA) or 2-methoxyethanol solution of thioglycolic acid and ethanolamine, forming many types of thermally degradable metal–organic molecular precursor solutions.25,26 The high-quality CZTSSe thin films can be easily fabricated by spin-coating and annealing processes, and the power conversion efficiencies of 6.03% and 6.83% for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells have been respectively achieved by tuning the composition of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin films by a selenization process.25,26 In this work, we present a novel 1,2-ethanedithiol/ethanolamine/2-methoxyethanol ternary solution route, and this process offers the remarkable ability to rapidly dissolve Cu2O, ZnO and SnO at room temperature. The inferred reaction mechanism of metal oxides in ternary solvent mixture is shown in the top of Fig. 1. This ternary solvent mixture can be directly used to dissolve many types of metal oxides, including Cu2O, ZnO and SnO, and then forming CZTS metal–organic precursor solution, as presented in the bottom of Fig. 1.

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data for the CZTS precursor (Cu/(Zn + Sn) ≈ 0.80, Zn/Sn ≈ 1.2) is shown in Fig. 2. The TGA sample was prepared from the CZTS precursor solution by removal of all low boiling point organic solvent molecules under vacuum at 100 °C and then heated at 100 °C for 240 min in drying oven. The TGA profile shows that the CZTS precursors are nearly completely decomposed at 320 °C, so we choose 320 °C as the heat treatment temperature. It is worth noting that the TGA profile of CZTS precursors is analogous to those of the other metal sulfides precursors in literature,21–26 since the bond enthalpies of metal–sulfur in various solution systems are similar.

The CZTS nanocrystal thin film on a Mo-coated sodalime glass (SLG) substrate was fabricated by spin-casting the CZTS precursor solution, followed by annealing on a 320 °C hot plate for 1 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. As-prepared CZTS thin film was selenized to form CZTSSe absorber layer under selenium vapor at 540 °C for 10 min in graphite box with 200 mg selenium powder. Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of CZTS and CZTSSe films. Weak and broad peaks of as-prepared CZTS thin film were observed, indicating the formation of tetragonal phase CZTS nanocrystals (Fig. 3a black line). The sharp peaks with high intensity were observed and well indexed to kesterite structure CZTSSe (101), (110), (112), (103), (211), (204)/(220), (312)/(116) and (400)/(008), demonstrating that large densely packed grains in CZTSSe thin film with good crystallinity have been obtained after selenization (Fig. 3a red line). It can also be observed that the main diffraction peaks of CZTSSe obviously shift toward the lower angles compared with CZTS thin films. This is attributed to the expansion of the unit cell volume by the insertion of Se in lattice points.

The phase purity of CZTSSe thin film is critically important to the performance of CZTSSe solar cell. In addition, some binary and ternary chalcogenides, such as ZnS, ZnSe, Cu2SnS3, and Cu2SnSe3, have similar XRD patterns with CZTS and CZTSe, so it is insufficient to effectively identify the phase purity of the CZTS and CZTSSe thin films only by XRD patterns. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful detection tool to determine possible impurity phases such as CuxS, ZnS, SnS2, CuxSe, ZnSe, SnSe2, Cu2SnS3 and Cu2SnSe3. Therefore, the as-prepared CZTS and selenized CZTSSe thin films were examined by Raman spectroscopy, and the patterns were shown in Fig. 3b. The A1 Raman mode frequencies of CZTS is 338.5 cm−1 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 3b black line), consistent with previously reported CZTS values.22,25 The A1 modes are pure anion modes which correspond to vibrations of sulphur surrounded by motionless neighboring atoms. The possible impurity peaks of binary and ternary chalcogenides, including Cu2S, ZnS, SnS, SnS2 and Cu2SnS3, are not found, indicating that the pure CZTS thin film was obtained.25 For selenized CZTSSe thin film, the main peaks are located at 165 cm−1, 190 cm−1, 231 cm−1, and 319 cm−1 (Fig. 3b red line), which are in good agreement with the literature results for CZTSSe.26 No possible impurity phases (Cu2(S,Se)x, Zn(S,Se), Sn(S,Se), Sn(S,Se)2 and Cu2Sn(S,Se)3) could be found in the Raman spectrum of selenized CZTSSe thin film.
Typically, the high efficiency CZTSSe solar cell can be obtained in a wide composition range of CZTSSe thin film around Cu/(Zn + Sn) ≈ 0.75–0.95 and Zn/Sn ≈ 1.1–1.5, and the copper-poor and zinc-rich CZTSSe absorber layer is one of the key factors that affect the efficiency of solar cells. The typical chemical compositions of the as-prepared CZTS thin film and the selenized CZTSSe thin film were shown in Fig. 3c, determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The chemical composition of the as-prepared CZTS thin film is Cu1.98Zn1.25Sn1.0S4.44, which is consistent with the composition of CZTS precursor solution. The selenized CZTSSe thin film has a Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio about 0.94 and a Zn/Sn ratio about 1.22, which is consistent with those previously reported high efficiency CZTSSe devices.18–24 Note that the slight difference of chemical composition between the as-prepared CZTS thin film and the selenized CZTSSe thin film was observed, and the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio significantly increases after the selenization, which is a common phenomenon in selenized CZTSSe thin films.25,26 In addition, the ratio of S/(S + Se) is approximately 4.73%, which is close to those of previously reported selenization process using graphite box.11,26
The valence states of all the elements in the as-fabricated CZTS thin film and the selenized CZTSSe thin film were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S3 and S4†). The Cu 2p XPS spectra of two films similarly displays two peaks at 931.5 eV and 951.5 eV with a peak separation of 20 eV, indicating that the valence states of Cu in the CZTS and CZTSSe films are +1; the Zn and Sn of CZTS and CZTSSe films split into 2p3/2 (1021.0 eV), 2p1/2 (1044.1 eV) and 3d5/2 (486.2 eV), 3d3/2 (494.7 eV) respectively, which suggests that the valence states of Zn and Sn in the CZTS and CZTSSe films are +2 and +4.22
Fig. 4a and b show the representative top-view and cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of as-prepared CZTS thin film on Mo-coated SLG. There are some small cracks on the surface of the as-prepared film. Smooth, cracks-free and pinhole-free CZTS nanocrystal thin film with a thickness of ∼2 μm was formed by consecutive spin-casting and heat treatment processes. After selenization at 540 °C for 10 min, dense and void-free large grains (1–3 μm) are obtained (Fig. 4c). A surprisingly complex internal microstructure for a completed CZTSSe solar cell is shown in Fig. 4d. The columnar bottom layer is MoSe2 and Mo. It can be seen that the CZTSSe layer consists of a fine-grained sub-layer and a large-grained outer layer. The similar bi-layer structure of CZTSSe solar cell has already been extensively observed for nanocrystal-based ink approach and molecular precursor solution approach, perhaps due to the copper-rich growth mechanism33,34 and residues of organic molecules in thermal decomposition process.21–26

The CZTSSe solar cell device structure was glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al, which was according to the classical configurations of CIGS and CZTSSe solar cells.1–5 Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best CZTSSe solar cell measured in the dark and under AM 1.5 illumination. The as-fabricated device exhibits a PCE of 7.34% based on the active area of 0.425 cm2 (Voc = 0.436 V, Jsc = 34.03 mA cm−2, FF = 49.5%). The Voc and Jsc of our device are comparable with other high efficiency CZTSSe solar cells, but the FF is significantly lower than those works in the literature which are generally higher than 60%.1–5 The fine-grained sub-layer in the current CZTSSe thin film may seriously limit the FF of solar cells, which can restrict the transport of photo-generated carriers and form grain boundary recombination.11,25,26 For determining the diode parameters of CZTSSe solar cell, the diode parameters of the shunt conductance G, the saturation current density J0, the ideality factor A and the series resistance R are further extracted from the dark J–V curve according to the literature method. Fig. 5b shows the dark shunt conductance G of CZTSSe solar cell, which was calculated to be 0.4 mS cm−2 by a plot of dJ/dV vs. V. The r(J) curve (r(J) ≡ dV/dJ vs. (J + Jsc)−1) for the same CZTSSe device was shown in Fig. 5c. The series resistance R is 2.1 Ω cm2 and the diode quality factor A is 1.6. Fig. 5d shows the semi-logarithmic plot of J + Jsc–GV vs. V–RJ. The intercept for the dark data gives the reverse saturation current density J0 = 1.6 × 10−3 mA cm−2 and the slope gives A = 1.6, in good agreement with the value obtained from Fig. 5c. The low fill factor is mainly associated with a high series resistance due to the fine-grained sub-layer. An ideal back contact needs to provide impurity-free as well as an “electronically clean” interface that serves as an ohmic contact.6,18 In comparison to previously published result of the record IBM CZTSSe device,6 our ideality factor is also slightly higher, and the diode ideality factor of IBM device is as low as 1.3. Note that the large ideality factor A value and a high reverse saturation current density of our device will lower Voc and FF of the solar cell, and thus affecting the efficiency.

(c) Plot of dV/dJ vs. (J + Jsc)−1. (d) Semi-logarithmic plot of J + Jsc–GV vs. V–RJ; J0 was obtained by the intercept of the linear region of the curve, and the slope is equal to q/AkT. 
Fig. 6 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve for the corresponding CZTSSe solar cell. CZTSSe thin film has a band gap of 1.12 eV determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the absorption edge to find the intercept with the energy axis from the x-axis intercept of [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2 vs. E curve (the inset of Fig. 6), which is close to those of high-performance CZTSSe thin films in literature.17 The diffuse reflection spectrum of the CZTSSe thin film was also measured, as shown in Fig. S5.† The band gap of selenized CZTSSe thin film was calculated to be 1.03 eV by extrapolating the Kubelka–Munk function to K/S = 0. It was found that the EQE starts increasing rapidly at 1100 nm, which is related to the optical absorption of the CZTSSe absorber, reaching a maximum value of 91.4% at 860 nm, and exhibits a wide response and high EQE value (higher than 80%) in the range of 1051 to 533 nm. The attenuation of EQE in the long wavelength region is due to various recombination losses. Our EQE curve shows a strong response at the red portion of the spectrum (λ > 600 nm), indicating a very high collection efficiency due to very weak recombination losses in the bulk and depletion region that leads to long minority carrier diffusion length. Then the EQE drops rapidly at about 500 nm, it is due to absorption losses in the window and buffer layers (ITO, i-ZnO, and CdS). The calculated Jsc from EQE spectrum is 34.34 mA cm−2, which is slightly higher than the measured Jsc under AM 1.5 illumination. It is expected that a significant improvement in device performance should be achieved by optimizing the window/buffer layers and depositing MgF2 antireflection film.6

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a robust and low-cost solution approach composed of 1,2-ethanedithiol/ethanolamine/2-methoxyethanol for preparation of CZTS precursor solution, and then have successfully fabricated high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells. A power conversion efficiency of 7.34% based on active area has been achieved. The PCE could be further enhanced by the optimizing selenization conditions, optimizing the window/buffer layers and depositing MgF2 antireflection layer. Moreover, this solution approach could be extended to produce other earth abundant thin film solar cells, such as Sb2(S,Se)3, SnS, Cu2S, FeS2, Pb(S,Se), Cu2SnS3, CuSbS2, CuBiS2 and Cu2(MII)Sn(S,Se)4 (MII = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni).
