    , Accepted 15th April 2019First published on 15th April 2019AbstractPerovskite materials have been attracting much attention in recent years, especially in the field of energy conversion. However, the inherent disadvantages constrict the development of perovskites. Though many modification strategies have been proposed, the fundamental connection between those modifications and electronic properties is not clear. In this work, we investigated a series of Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites to explore the relationship between chemical components and their electronic properties. We revealed the influence of the components at A and B sites on band gaps and band edge positions by first-principles computations. After summarizing the design rules for RP perovskites, we proposed three new ones, MgSrMnO4, Mg2SrMn2O7 and MgSr2Mn2O7. Computed electronic properties demonstrate that Mg2SrMn2O7 has the suitable band gap and optimal light absorption, while MgSrMnO4 also has the optimal band edge position at the same time. These two new perovskites have desirable potential for application in the field of luminous energy conversion. Therefore, the rules of band engineering can provide guidance for further development of RP perovskites for photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications.
Introduction
After extensive investigations, many representative perovskite materials with excellent practicability were discovered. Particularly in the field of energy conversion, perovskites are the promising candidates for solar cells,1–4 catalysts,5–7 batteries,8–11 and other correlative applications12–14 due to their unique structures and properties. However, the inherent disadvantages of perovskites, such as unsuitable band gaps and environmental instability, are still unresolved.15,16 Two-dimensional (2D) structures based on perovskites could provide optimal band gaps, higher power conversion efficiency and superior stability.17,18 In addition, perovskites of different phases may also have unexpected properties. Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (usually, A = an alkaline earth or lanthanide cation, B = a transition metal, and X = O, Cl, Br, or I) were reported by Ruddlesden and Popper in 1950,19 and the three initial kinds were Sr2TiO4, Ca2MnO4 and SrLaAlO4. Moreover, organic–inorganic RP hybrid perovskites have also been widely reported.15,20–23 As an important kind of layered perovskite, RP perovskites are attractive due to their stability,24 but their low efficiency for solar power conversion is a non-ignorable problem. Fortunately, the properties of RP perovskites can be tuned by changing their chemical compositions, structures and preparation conditions. The variation of RP perovskites attracted the attention of researchers, and there are many experimental and theoretical reports to figure out the relationship between the structures and properties of RP perovskites.21,25–35 By changing the chemical components, Zhang and coworkers reported that there was a fivefold increase in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Sr1.7La0.3Ti0.7Fe0.3O4.36 Recently, Ma et al. have computationally searched for promising lead-free 2D RP hybrid perovskites, and found that the band gaps of lead-free 2D RP hybrid perovskites would decrease gradually as the n value increases.15 Although many excellent modified materials have been predicted and prepared, the fundamental relationship between those modification routes and properties is not completely clear so far. Considering the cost of those trial-and-error experiments, it is essential to establish an all-inclusive theoretical system for designing RP perovskites.
Herein, we substitute the atoms of A and B positions and change the n value of RP all-inorganic perovskites (An+1BnO3n+1, A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba; B = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ge, Zr, Nb, Sn, and Ta, n = 1, 2) since RP hybrid perovskites always have unstable organic layers, and systemically investigate how the A and B components control the properties of bulk RP perovskites and their relative 2D structures by means of first-principles computations. Inspired by the trend concluded from computations, we successfully design new 2D RP perovskites for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications, which further verifies our design rules.
Computational
Density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed by using a plane-wave basis set as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).37 The projector augmented wave (PAW)38 method was applied to deal with the interaction between ions and electrons. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)39 was chosen, with an energy cutoff of 550 eV for the plane wave basis set. The influence of spin–orbital coupling is negligible compared with band gaps, and we did not consider this effect in computations. For a more accurate level of our computations, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional40 was used for band structure calculations. A Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 9 × 9 × 1 was adopted for 2D RP perovskites, and 8 × 8 × 3 and 8 × 8 × 2 k-point meshes were applied to describe the first Brillouin zone of bulk phases. The number of k points would appropriately decrease for the complicated structure. For some bulks with n = 2, we used 5 × 5 × 2 k-point meshes in the HSE06 band structure calculations due to their larger demand for computational resource. A vacuum space of at least 20 Å was inserted between the periodic images, restraining the artificial interaction between them. Electrostatic potential alignments were used to obtain the vacuum level related band edge positions. In order to ensure the structural stability of the designed RP perovskites, the tolerance factor (t)41 reported by Goldschmidt was used. The tolerance factor was computed using the equation:t = (rA + rO)/√2(rB + rO)where rA, rB and rO represent the ionic radii of A, B and O, respectively.
In order to investigate the optical absorption performance, we used the absorption coefficient I(ω) which is defined as:42  
The dielectric constants were divided into real part ε1(ω) and imaginary part ε2(ω):ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)  where εαβ2(ω) presents the imaginary part based on the Kramers–Kronig relationship, while c and ν are the conduction and valence band positions computed at the HSE06 level, respectively, and  is the cell periodic part of the wavefunctions at the location of the k-point.
Results and discussion
Srn+1BnO3n+1
For perovskites, generally, the components of A sites have subordinate influence on the electronic structures;43 thus, we first consider the condition that A sites are occupied by Sr (B = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ge, Zr, Nb, Sn, and Ta). The typical geometric structure of bulk RP perovskites is shown in Fig. 1a, and the 2D layer structure is presented in Fig. 1b. The structures of RP perovskites always have distortions and their phases transform with temperature, i.e., antiferrodistortive (octahedral rotations) and ferroelectric (polar) distortions.35 However, we only considered the tetragonal phase in our computations for the exact analysis of the electronic properties. The suitable range of tolerance factors to perovskite structures is 0.7–1.1.41 From the results shown in Fig. S1,† all the designed Srn+1BnO3n+1 structures satisfy the optimal tolerance factor, demonstrating rational structures.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the bulk RP perovskites that were typically prepared at high temperatures (>150 °C) show I4/mmm tetragonal crystal structures, including the periodic arrangement of A cation layers and B–O octahedral cages.44 The lattice parameters of the high symmetry I4/mmm tetragonal unit cells are shown in Table 1, and our computational results are close to those in a previous report.45 Such unique structures have excellent potential for materials modifications, and various chemical or physical methods can be used to obtain new compounds for advanced applications.30,36,46–49 In particular, it is easy to realize layer structures (Fig. 1b) because of the passable interlayer space between A cation layers and octahedral cages. The lattice parameters (a) of the materials with the same chemical component change slightly when the n values are different, and the 2D structures of Sr2BO4 show smaller lattice parameters. The volume of the octahedral cages also influences the lattice parameters and there is an increasing trend caused by a series of incremental cage centre atoms.

The band structures were investigated to explore the way in which the above-mentioned modification strategies influence the properties of RP perovskites. Interestingly, among those 40 materials, only 16 kinds of perovskites that contain Mn, Ge, Zr or Sn atoms have band gaps, and the rest of the materials are all metallic. The band structures of those candidate materials are presented in Fig. S2,† and Fig. S3† shows the band structures of the rest of the materials. Besides band structures, we also provide the density of states (DOS) for all designed 2D Sr2BO4 in Fig. S4.† There always exist relatively high peaks contributed by the d orbitals of B atoms near the Fermi level in those metallic systems. Also, we calculated the band structure of Sr2TiO4, a kind of widely studied RP perovskite.12,50,51 The calculated band gap is 3.49 eV for 2D Sr2TiO4, and 3.42 eV for bulk Sr2TiO4. These results are close to the experimental values,36 demonstrating the reliability of our computations. For the systematic comparison of the change order of band gaps of different perovskites, the discussion originates from two aspects. First, 14 kinds of perovskites were segmented into four parts (Srn+1MnnO3n+1, Srn+1GenO3n+1, Srn+1ZrnO3n+1, and Srn+1SnnO3n+1) to explore the influence of geometric structures. For Mn-based perovskites, the 2D structures have wider band gaps than the relative bulk perovskites as observed from the results in Fig. 2a, no matter whether the n value is 1 or 2. Moreover, it is easy to find that the structures of Sr3Mn2O7 show the narrowest band gaps. Although Mn and Zr are both transition metals, the variation trends of band gaps are exactly different. For Zr-based perovskites with the same number of octahedral cages, the band gap variation is in contrast to that of Mn-based materials. Ge-based and Sn-based perovskites follow the same rule of band gap change and the bulk structures of compounds (n = 2) present the narrowest band gaps, located in the concave peak of the variation curve. However, the sequence of band gap change found by the comparison of structures has poor universality, so we next compared chemical components. As shown in Fig. 2b, the band gaps of all structures show a tendency to become larger with the increase of the ionic radius of B atoms, indicating that the chemical components are the dominant factors of band gap change. Noticeably, only the Mn-based RP perovskite, 2D Sr2MnO4 (1.09 eV), can satisfy the optimal band gaps for solar cells.

Mn-based and Ge-based perovskites were chosen as the representatives to express the further understanding of electronic structures using the partial DOS (PDOS) shown in Fig. 3, and the results of other structures are shown in Fig. S5.† The valence bands of all Mn-based and Zr-based perovskites are mainly composed of the p orbital of O, and the conduction bands are constructed by the d orbital of Mn or contributed by both the d orbital of Mn and the p orbital of O. However, the components of the VBM and CBM of Ge-based and Sn-based perovskites are different from those of the above two. The components of the VBM of Ge-based structures are only contributed by the p orbital of O, and the p orbital of O and the s orbital of Ge constitute the CBM together. The charge density of bulk structures of Sr2MnO4 and Sr2GeO4 is also presented in Fig. 4, confirming the computed PDOS.

These computed electronic structures demonstrate that the B–O anion octahedron is the main determining factor of the band gap of RP perovskites. However, the A cation has slight influence on the band gap, and the band edges can be modified by different A atoms.43 In particular, for photocatalysis, the band edge plays the key role in their chemical and physical performance. In order to obtain materials with better application potential, we then supplanted the atoms of A positions, choosing ideal A-site ions for the expected materials.
Mgn+1BnO3n+1, Can+1BnO3n+1, and Ban+1BnO3n+1
Considering the above results and the computational cost, we chose 2D structures of RP perovskites (n = 1) to find the ideal A site ion. Taking band gaps into account, we still used the results of the materials with B = Mn, Ge, Zr or Sn. The HSE06 band structures of those systems are shown in Fig. S6–S8.† From Fig. 5 and Table S1,† the results of computed band gaps show a decreasing tendency with the change of A-site ions from Ca2+ to Ba2+, which may be induced by the large nuclear charge of A site ions.43 However, when the A site is occupied by Mg2+, the variation rule of band gaps is different from that of the remaining three d0 elements. Although the B–O anion octahedron still controls the band gaps, the influence of A site ions on band gaps is not negligible while the A site alkaline earth ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+) occupy more percentages of the volume of a unit cell. Moreover, Mn-based perovskites maintain the narrowest band gaps and the band gaps are located in, or close to the suitable range, leading to the expectation that Mn-based perovskites would satisfy the blueprint of functional materials for photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications.

For energy conversion materials, suitable band edge positions predominantly determine their applications. As shown in Fig. 6, for the structures without a magnetic moment (A2BO4, A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba; B = Zr, Ge, and Sn), the CBM positions gradually increase with an upturn in the ion radius of A site cations. In contrast, for Mn-based structures, which have a magnetic moment, the change of the CBM follows a downward trend with the variation of A site cations from Ca2+ to Ba2+, and Mg2MnO4 has the lowest CBM position. The VBM positions maintain the increasing tendency when the A site cations change from Mg2+ to Ba2+. The details of band edge positions are presented in Table S1.† Notably, the CBM and VBM of Mn-based perovskites both have a sharply varying trend compared with those of other structures (the PDOS results of Mn-based structures are shown in Fig. S9†) and when the A site element is Mg, the band edge positions are close to the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O (pH = 0). For an ideal photocatalyst for water splitting, the VBM should be lower than the O2/H2O oxidation potential and the CBM should be higher than the H+/H2 reduction potential. Thus, the closer band edge positions to the water redox potentials means the materials are more likely to be used as catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.

On the basis of the above analysis, some relationships between the three factors (n, A site cations, and the B–O anion octahedron) and properties can be constructed. First, the slight change of the n value cannot play the key role in tuning the electronic structure. It can only reduce the band gap of Mn-based RP perovskites within a small range. Second, the B–O anion octahedron is in a dominant position to control the band gaps while the band gaps become larger with increasing the ionic radius of B atoms. However, the influence of A site cations cannot be negligible; not only band gaps, but also band edge positions have a tight relationship with the A cations. Interestingly, the variation of band gaps and band edge positions of Mn-based perovskites is distinct from that of other B-based structures, and most materials with Mg2+ as A site cations show optimal band edge positions. Considering both the A site cation and B–O anion octahedron, we chose 2D Mg2MnO4 perovskite as the basic model to perform further investigations.
Materials based on 2D Mg2MnO4
As mentioned above, the increase of n value has slight influence on the electronic structure, but it can narrow the band gaps of Mn-based perovskites. As we expected, the band gap of the 2D RP perovskite Mg3MnO7 (1.30 eV) is smaller than that of Mg2MnO4 (1.85 eV) as shown in Fig. 7a, which is in the ideal range. Although the 2D RP perovskite Mg3MnO7 has an unsuitable band edge position, it could be modified. Inspired by double perovskites, Janus structures and the above results, we designed some new materials with unique structures. As one kind of A site atom in the initial materials, Sr has a bigger ionic radius and might result in some unexpected properties. In the previous part of our study, the band edge positions of Mn-based perovskites with Sr2+ were shifted. The three new kinds of 2D perovskite materials, MgSrMnO4, Mg2SrMn2O7 and MgSr2Mn2O7, with Sr2+ replacing some of the primordial A site cations can satisfy our requirement for solar applications. The structures of these new materials are shown in Fig. S10.† The tolerance factor (t) of MgSrMnO4, Mg2SrMn2O7, and MgSr2Mn2O7 is 0.946, 0.910, and 0.982, respectively, demonstrating their structural rationality.
 Fig. 7  (a) Band gaps of Mg2MnO4 and a series of materials derived from Mg2MnO4. (b) Band edge positions of those 2D structures. The royal blue solid lines present the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O (pH = 0), and the redox potentials (pH = 7) are denoted with red solid lines. 
The computed band structures shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that the Sr component always causes a narrower band gap and a higher band edge position. The three materials, Mg3Mn2O7 (1.30 eV), MgSrMnO4 (1.36 eV), and Mg2SrMn2O7 (0.98 eV), have the optimal band gaps for solar cells. Especially, benefitting from the addition of Sr2+, MgSrMnO4 has an ideal band gap for solar cells and a band edge position that can straddle the redox potentials of water at pH = 7. From the computed PDOS shown in Fig. S11,† a higher degree of hybridization between the p orbital of O and the d orbital of Mn is induced by increasing the Mn component, and it changes the band structure of materials. Consistent with our previous prediction, the band structures are mainly controlled by the B–O anion octahedron and slightly influenced by the A site cation. For the structures with n = 1, the VBM is contributed by both the p orbital of O and the d orbital of Mn, but the CBM only relates to the d orbital of Mn. Different from the single B–O anion octahedron structures, the VBM and CBM of Mg3Mn2O7, Mg2SrMn2O7, and MgSr2Mn2O7 consist of the p orbital of O and the d orbital of Mn, respectively. The correlative charge density is shown in Fig. S12† to further demonstrate the band structures of these materials.
For the potential materials for solar applications, the optical absorption performance is a significant factor. In order to obtain an accurate result of the optical absorption, we considered the absorption coefficients of x, y and z directions, since they can approximately represent the light of all directions. All the materials have strong absorption peaks (2.4 × 104 to 1.8 × 105 cm−1) in the range of visible light. MgSr2Mn2O7 has the highest peaks at about 2.2 eV and 3.0 eV in the parts perpendicular and parallel to the z direction, respectively. The optical absorption coefficients of these materials in the visible light range follow the order MgSr2Mn2O7 > Mg3Mn2O7 > Mg2SrMn2O7 > MgSrMnO4 > Mg2MnO4, which demonstrates that the increase of the n value can promote solar absorption. For the double B–O anion octahedron structures, the trend is similar to that of the band edge position. Besides, most materials also show strong light absorption in the near ultraviolet light area (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Optical absorption coefficient of 2D Mg2MnO4 and the materials based on it. The left spectrum is the absorption coefficient I(ω) of the part which is parallel to the x direction or y direction (because all the structures are tetragonal). The right spectrum presents the rest of the I(ω) that is parallel to the z direction. The blank between the red and purple areas is the range of visible light. 
Based on the above analyses, Mg3Mn2O7 and Mg2SrMn2O7 have suitable band gaps and optimal light absorption for solar cells. Although MgSr2Mn2O7 has the strongest optical absorption, it cannot satisfy the band gap requirement. However, MgSrMnO4 has both the optimal band edge position and strong optical absorption in the visible and near ultraviolet regions while the band gap is located in the ideal range of 0.9–1.6 eV (1.36 eV), which is lower than that of well-known perovskites in solar cells, CsPbI3 (1.67 eV), CH3NH3PbI3 (1.52 eV), and FAPbI3 (1.48 eV), and comparable to that of potential inorganic lead-free perovskites (such as SrSnSe3, 1.00 eV).52 Such desirable properties may benefit from the different edge structures of MgSrMnO4. For materials with inappropriate band gaps, the contents of Sr and Mg can be further adjusted to meet the demand. Compared with other RP perovskites, the preparation of MgSrMnO4 is low-cost, and this material is non-toxic. Although this material has not been confirmed by experiments, materials with a similar structure have been successfully prepared.36 Therefore, the 2D RP perovskite MgSrMnO4 is a potential candidate for photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications. Moreover, our design rules have certain significance for exploring new RP perovskites.
Conclusions
In this work, some general rules of RP perovskites have been constructed. First, the slight change of material structures does not change the electronic properties of RP perovskites and the band gaps are mainly dominated by the B–O anion octahedron while A site cations have minor influence on them. The bigger the ionic radii of B atoms, the larger the band gaps. Moreover, for 2D RP perovskites, the band edge positions of the VBM follow an increasing tendency with the augmentation of A site cations at the same time. Besides, the band edge positions depend in part on the magnetic moment. New perovskites were designed to satisfy the demand for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications based on these analyses of the band structure engineering of RP perovskites. Mg3Mn2O7 and Mg2SrMn2O7 are expected to be the promising materials for solar cells, and MgSrMnO4 satisfies both the criteria of ideal solar cells and water-splitting photocatalysts. This work described a clear process of engineering the electronic properties of materials, and the rules of band structure engineering point out a new series of perovskites with excellent application potential and are beneficial to explore more excellent RP perovskites for energy fields.

 	Fig. 2  Band gaps of Srn+1BnO3n+1 computed using HSE06. The green area is the best band gap range of perovskites for solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 3  PDOS of O atoms and B atoms (Ge and Mn). (a) Ge-based structures and (b) Mn-based structures. The red and royal blue lines indicate the p orbital of oxygen atoms and the d orbital of B atoms, respectively. The black dashed lines are the Fermi level.	 

 	Fig. 4  The charge density for bulk structures of Sr2MnO4 and Sr2GeO4 at the VBM and CBM. The isosurface level is set as 0.002 e Å−3.	 

 	Fig. 5  Band gaps of Mgn+1BnO3n+1, Can+1BnO3n+1, Srn+1BnO3n+1 and Ban+1BnO3n+1 (B = Mn, Ge, Sn and Zr, n = 1).	 

 	Fig. 6  Band gaps of Mgn+1BnO3n+1, Can+1BnO3n+1 and Ban+1BnO3n+1 (B = Mn, Ge, Sn, and Zr, n = 1). The royal blue solid lines present the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O (pH = 0), and the redox potentials (pH = 7) are denoted with red solid lines.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Band gaps of Mg2MnO4 and a series of materials derived from Mg2MnO4. (b) Band edge positions of those 2D structures. The royal blue solid lines present the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O (pH = 0), and the redox potentials (pH = 7) are denoted with red solid lines.	 

 	Fig. 8  Optical absorption coefficient of 2D Mg2MnO4 and the materials based on it. The left spectrum is the absorption coefficient I(ω) of the part which is parallel to the x direction or y direction (because all the structures are tetragonal). The right spectrum presents the rest of the I(ω) that is parallel to the z direction. The blank between the red and purple areas is the range of visible light.
