    , Accepted 21st October 2013First published on 22nd October 2013AbstractA C@Ti/anatase nanoporous fiber, where C ions replace the positions of Ti (1–5%) in the lattice, was prepared quasi-in situ by electrospinning a titanate gel containing a polyethylene–polypropylene glycol additive. Compared with immobilized nano-TiO2 and anatase fibers, C@Ti/anatase fibers showed improved optical absorption for visible light. The improved photocatalytic activity of the fibers was further testified by its decomposition of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. The strengthened optical absorptivity was attributed to modifying the energy band structure in the lattice of anatase which results from isotropic and anisotropic stress. Based on analysis by first principle theory calculations, the C@Ti/anatase has been evidenced to be “softer” than the pure anatase ones, and easily affected by micro-residual stress. The lattice parameters of the C@Ti/anatase fibers became distorted when anisotropic compressive stresses were applied, resulting in a narrowed band gap.
1. Introduction
After the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was first published by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 interest in this research field has expanded enormously. As a high performance photocatalyst, TiO2 has been employed to transform and use solar energy, eliminate organic pollutants, and synthesize photochemical products.2 In particular, the photocatalytic removal of pollutants by TiO2, including aldehydes,3 phenols,4 dyes,5 and heavy metal ions,6,7etc., has been explored for several decades. The major obstacle for TiO2 application is its optical absorptivity, which is limited to λ < 390 nm. Thus, approximately 96% of the energy from solar light cannot be used by TiO2. If artificial light is used to replace sunlight, the problem of energy cost would be raised. Commercial TiO2, such as nano-TiO2 particles, scatter easily when they are used in wastewater treatment. Thus, it is a huge challenge to reuse TiO2 from water. Furthermore, the loss of nano-TiO2 may be a potential threat to the water environment.8,9
Fibers and fibrous membranes are easily separated from water treatment devices. Recently, electrospinning was proven to be a simple and versatile method for preparing nanofibers from various materials.10 So far, many metal oxide fibers, including CaWO4,11 MoO3, CuO,12 TiO2,13 SnO2,14 Bi2WO6,15 and ZnO,16 have been fabricated by electrospinning. Some researchers have reported in situ electrospinning for preparing TiO2 nano-fibers/mats. For example, Son et al.17 prepared titania fibers by the electrospinning technique without polymer additives. The innovative direct electrospinning was based on a sol–gel process. Non-woven photocatalytic cellulosic electrospun fibers were also invented for the treatment of solar-light-driven microcystin-LR containing water.18 The fibrous morphology improves the recyclability of TiO2; however, the diameters of the fibers produced are usually several micrometres thick. The big block structure of TiO2 weakens its photocatalytic activity due to the loss of quantum effects.19
Here, we introduce a procedure to prepare C@Ti/anatase electrospun fibers. During the preparation, a polyethylene–polypropylene glycol (PPG) was used as a difunctional additive. Acting as a pore-forming agent, PPG constructs nanopores in the fibers; acting as a carbon resource, PPG transforms into a cation under low oxygen annealing. The nanoporous structure increases the surface area of the fibers and the C dopants strengthen the optical absorptivity of TiO2 under visible light irradiation. Recent studies have shown that carbon doping can effectively improve the photocatalytic capacity of TiO2 under visible light. Lettman et al.20 pioneered C-doping of TiO2 and observed the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol by it. In the manner of CO32− doping, carbon was successfully introduced into an anatase photocatalyst by Sakthivel and Kisch.21 Wang et al.22 also found a typical narrowed band gap of fibrous TiO2 of 0.7 eV while C doping of TiO2 blocks. As well, the visible light response of C-doped TiO2 has been evidenced experimentally.23–25
There remains controversy regarding how C ions affect the optical absorptivity of TiO2. It was believed that C-doping does not affect the electron structure of TiO2 for anion-doped carbon atoms do not invoke any significant structural change of TiO2.26 Some researchers have suggested that isolated band gap states are responsible for visible-light absorption.27,28 Recent experimental studies revealed that C cation-doped TiO2 induces different redshifts of the optical absorption edge.5 Thus, the effects of C doping on the optical absorption spectra of TiO2 remain unclear, since few experimental studies are associated with theoretical investigations, and vice versa. In our case, the related analyses by first principle calculations are carried out based on the crystallization stress of C@Ti/anatase fibers. The effects of strength and axis stress on the lattice distortion and electron density are investigated as well.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
There are two techniques for C doping in TiO2.26 For anion doping, TiC is annealed at high temperatures to >98% TiO2 conversion;29 for cation doping, amorphous TiO2 is doped with carbon from a precursor source such as glucose30 or ethanol.31 In our case, C doped TiO2 was prepared using titanate and a carbon-rich organic additive (polymer such as a C resource). Thus, cation doping (C@Ti) was performed here.
The titanate sol was prepared via a solvent evaporation process in a nonaqueous system using mixed titanate precursors, including tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), ethanol, hydrochloric acid (all of which are from Sinopharm, China), and polyethylene–polypropylene glycol (PEO100–PPO70–PEO100, branded as F127 by BASF, Germany). Other chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments. Nano-TiO2 (P25) was purchased from Degussa (Germany).
2.2 Precursor preparation
In a typical preparation, tetrabutyl titanate was first dissolved in ethanol by stirring at room temperature in a 200 mL beaker. Then, hydrochloric acid solution (12 M) and PPG were added with stirring. The mixture was further stirred until a clear solution was obtained, and then moved to a 100 mL beaker. The optimal stoichiometric coefficient was determined by the titanate sol: TBOT: ethanol:hydrochloric acid:water:PPG = 1:1.13–5:0.55:3–5:0.0012–0.0025. The resulting solution was transferred to a thermostatic mixer and solvent evaporation was performed overnight with stirring at 50 °C until the viscosity reached 6000–7500 cps. Finally, the prepared viscous sol–gel was moved into the electrospinning device.
2.3 Electrospinning
The electrospinning device consisted of a high-voltage power supply and a spinneret with a suction tube and metal target (Fig. S1). The distance between the fixed spinneret and metal collector was 15 cm. A stable jet can be produced following a supply voltage of 35 kV. After about 30 min, the fibers were collected and then incubated at 100 °C for 2 h to dry.
C-doped fibers were obtained by the temperature-programmed carbonization (TPC) of titanate fibers in a flow of 98% argon and 2.0% oxygen (to make a low oxygen environment) in a quartz tube reactor. The loading of as-spun fibers was 1.0 g, and the flow rate of argon was 500 mL (STP) min−1. The sample was heated to the carbonization temperature of 450 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C min−1, and kept at that temperature for 2 h. After rapidly cooling to room temperature in a flow of argon, wheat-colored fibers were obtained. For comparison, pure anatase fibers were prepared by replacing the argon with air under the same conditions.
A detailed immobilization procedure for another contrasting experiment of nano-TiO2, is provided in the ESI.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology and structure of the fibers were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6360LV, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H800, Hitachi, Japan) at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 nitrogen physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). The surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation and nanopore size distributions were calculated by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model from the adsorption branch of the isotherms. Pyrolysis was measured using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA2050, TA, USA); the temperature was increased from 24.6–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained on an X'Pert MDP diffractometer (Philips, Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). XRD peaks were measured via the step-scanning technique: step 0.02°, speed 1° min−1. PC-APD4.0 software was utilized to separate Kα2, 2ω, and β, which were calculated by Philips profile fit. The instrument widened curve g(x) was measured based on the standard sample provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Under the same conditions, the XRD peaks were collected within 2θ = 10°–80°, based on which the broaden curves could be obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on an Axis Ultra electron spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) operated at 250 W. The shift of binding energy was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.5 eV. The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of samples were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Specord 200, Analytik Jena, Germany) equipped with an integrated sphere attachment.
2.5 Calculation of band structure
Calculations were performed using the ABINIT program package. All structural optimizations and calculations on the total energy were carried out using first principle calculations employing the electronic structure method. The electronic structures were calculated under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and the Kohn–Sham (KS) method. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) was employed. The core electrons were replaced with Goedecker's pseudopotentials. The KS orbitals for the valence electrons were expanded using planewave basis sets with a 380 eV cutoff. The Brillouin zone integral was evaluated according to the Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling scheme with the tetrahedron method and Blöchl correction.
The main form of anatase polymers was built in a 2 × 2 × 1 anatase supercell with 24 Ti atoms and 48 O atoms. One Ti atom inside the lattice of this supercell was replaced by C atoms. All the atomic positions were optimized. The optimization was continued until all the forces on the atoms were <0.1 eV nm−1, and the residual stress was <0.002 Gpa. The surface stress was calculated using the above optimized lattice constants. The standard definition of the surface stress was given by Schuttleworth. The change in band energy of a given cell is expressed as GPa. The smearing method of Methfessel–Paxton with r = 0.15 eV was adopted.
2.6 Photocatalytic experiments
The photocatalytic activities of the anatase fibers, C@Ti/anatase fibers, and immobilized nano-TiO2 (Degussa P25) for the decomposition of chlorophenols in aqueous solution were evaluated under visible-light irradiation by a 1000 W Xenon lamp (CHF-XM-1000 W; Trusttech, China) with a cutoff filter at 420 nm (SCF-S50-42 L; Sigma, Koki, Japan). During the study, 5 mg L−1 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and 10 mg L−1 methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution were pre-adjusted to pH 5.0 with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. A fiber membrane (Φ = 100 mm) was placed in 100 mL of trichlorophenol solution in a glass culture dish (Φ = 100 mm). Before irradiation, the solutions were placed in the dark for 30 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. With the lighting on, the pollutant solutions were sampled at different times. After the photocatalytic activity of the fibers was evaluated in a 120 min run, the catalysts were washed with distilled water, dried at room temperature, and then re-evaluated. This process was repeated five times to investigate the anti-inactivation stability of the catalyst. The TCP concentration was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters600, USA) equipped with a Nova-Pak C18 Column (4 μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm). The mobile phase used for HPLC was 20% 0.10 M acetic acid aqueous solution:80% methanol (v/v). The concentration of MO was monitored by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer (Cary50; Varian, USA). Additionally, the mineralization of TCP and MO was quantified by the determination of the residual total organic carbon (TOC).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of the fibers
During electrospinning, significant differences were observed between the pure-polymer spinning and sol–gel spinning in terms of the gelling reaction viscosity, conductivity, and other properties.32 Sol–gel spinning is a dynamic process, involving reactions, and the formation of Ti–O–Ti bands. In the presence of acid and a little water, the sol–gel tended to transform into a Newton fluid or pseudo plastic fluid via chain polymerization, while, with alkali and more water, the sol–gel was inclined to form a thixotropic fluid by network polymerization.33 Only Newton fluids and pseudo plastic fluids were spinnable at certain viscosities. Thus, chain polymerization was necessary for electrospinning the titanate sol–gel. By carefully controlling the addition of water and hydrochloric acid, the titanate solution would transform from the expansion fluid to the Newton fluid, and then convert into the pseudo plastic fluid before finally yielding a gel.
Interestingly, during electrospinning, two types of fibers were obtained from the titanate sol–gel at different gelation stages. After solvent evaporation for 8 h (when the viscosity was 6000 cps), the sol–gel could be electrospun into “cotton like” fibers. The fibers were fluffy floccules and did not adhere onto the collector, which may have been due to the drier surface of each fiber. The average diameter of the fibers after annealing was less than 200 nm (Fig. 1a) and the “cotton like” morphology (Fig. 1b) did not change after annealing. By using a sol–gel with a viscosity of ca. 7500 cps, only fibrous membranes could be obtained (Fig. 1d). The average diameter of the fibers after annealing was ca. 400 nm (Fig. 1c). For immobilization applications, we chose the fibrous membranes to test their catalytic activity. Experimental evidence, however, shows no significant difference in terms of performance between the two types of fibers.

Although the macro-profile of the fibrous membrane did not change significantly after annealing, the membrane shrunk a bit in size, which may be attributed to the removal of PPG and crystallization of TiO2. Thus, TEM was used to observe the internal microstructure of the annealed fibers. As shown in Fig. 2, the size of the nanoscale grains of TiO2 observed was ca. 10–30 nm. The fiber was porous, rather than solid, suggesting the pore-forming function of PPG. It could be further confirmed that the TiO2 crystallized in a homo-dispersed manner and the particles were aggregated together. The particles were certainly microcrystals of TiO2, which could be evidenced by selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The SAED pattern displayed obvious rings, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2, indicating that the particles were non-directional and polycrystalline. Decoupled nanoparticles may be beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction not only because of their large surface area but also their high quantum yield. Compared to the micro-scale TiO2 fibers, the nanoscale particles could minimize recombination of the charge carriers (electrons and holes), and increase the lifetime of the separated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.19

According to the TEM analysis, PPG was removed after annealing, leaving porous structures. However, what the copolymer transformed into and how it did so needs further investigation. Fig. 3 illustrates the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution of the fibers. All samples showed Type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop between the IUPAC H1 and H2 types, indicating a nanoporous nature to the fibers. This was attributed to the aggregation of TiO2 crystallites. The BJH analysis yielded a peak at a pore diameter of 2.6 nm and 7.8 nm for the samples annealed in air and in a low oxygen environment, respectively, suggesting a narrow distribution of the nanopore dimensions. The larger pore sizes of the C doped sample might be due to the preservation of the larger pores by C coating, avoiding the collapse of the porous structure under high temperature annealing. The air-annealed fibers exhibited a higher surface area of 87.5 m2 g−1 than the C doped fibers, perhaps due to the residual C, but still high at 46.2 m2 g−1.

3.2 XRD analysis
The phase transformation between different crystalline TiO2 phases has been discussed in previous research. In our case, to obtain anatase fibers, the annealing temperature was set to 450 °C, a safe temperature from which to form the anatase phase. As shown in Fig. 4, the as-spun fibers showed a phase between amorphous and anatase, although only a peak at 25°, which may be attributed to the (100) plane of anatase, could be indexed. At 450 °C, almost all the amorphous TiO2 grew into the anatase phase (PDF# 21-1272 by Inorganic Crystal Structure Database). The crystalline transformation may lead to strong internal stress and strain. Furthermore, no significant difference between the crystallization of the fibers obtained under different annealing atmospheres was observed. The two fibers were both in the anatase phase with similar crystallinity. Small amounts of brookite (PDF# 75-1582), a metastable phase of TiO2, was found in the two patterns, which might be derived from the anatase transformation. When the annealing temperature was increased to 650 °C, a transformation from anatase to the rutile phase (PDF# 76-0649) occurred. Nevertheless, anatase remained the dominant phase.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the as-electrospun fibers and fibers annealed under different temperatures in air and in a low oxygen environment (argon protection). 
For polycrystalline materials, it has been reported that the effect of residual stress among grains caused by thermal expansion anisotropy could be enhanced by larger grain sizes.34 In our case, anatase may have strong crystal anisotropy under annealing and phase transformation. From the XRD patterns, the peaks shifted slightly, suggesting no macro-stress on the fibrous membrane. However, the intensities of the (101) anatase peak increased and the widths became broader compared to those of the standard anatase powder sample. In general, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak mainly corresponds to the crystal size and internal stress of the anatase particles. The measurements of the FWHM values of anatase (101) peaks were found to be in the range of 0.793–0.827 (2θ°). These values of the FWHM for the fibers are two times larger than that for anatase powder (0.395°), which is assumed to be strain-free.35
It was assumed that the Voigt function36 could be expressed as an experimental curvilinear function of peaks h(x), the instrument broadening function g(x), and structural broadening function f(x). The relationships between them are: hC = gC * fC, hG = gG * fG(1)
Here, * is convolution. Thus the relationship between the Gaussian (subscript G) integrated width βG of h(x), g(x), f(x) and Cauchy (subscript C) integrated width βC was: βfC = βhC − βgC, (βfG)2 = (βhG)2 − (βgG)2(2)
Based on the Voigt function single peak analytical method, it could be supposed that enlarged particle sizes account for the Cauchy component in the structural broaden function f(x), while distorting stress accounts for the Gaussian component. The particle size (D) and distorting stress (e) could be obtained from the two equations below: D = λ/βhCcos(θ)(3) e = βhG/4tan(θ)(4)
Thus, after measuring the peak form and instrumental broaden curves, βhG and βhC could be obtained by shape intermediation. The size of the particles (32.5–50.0 nm) and the distorting stress (0.17–0.25 Gpa) could be calculated and standardized by this means. The residual stress evaluated by the abovementioned method is actually a sum of thermal stress and intrinsic stress.37 Therefore, the nature of the residual stress is determined by the nature and relative magnitude of these two stress components. The thermal stress was produced on the axis of the fiber since the coefficients of thermal expansion of the different-sized fibers are not equal. The stress in our case was much lower than those on the TiO2 films, which may result from the fact that the mismatch was between grains, rather than between films and their substrates, that produced the internal stress.
3.3 Pore-forming role of PPG
Associated with the removal of PPG, the above analysis could also explain the formation of the nanoporous structure inside the fibers. The electrospun fibers were constructed by PPG micelles and titanate gel particles that were associated by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. For a PPG micelle, hydrophobic chains shrink inside the pores, while hydrophilic chains embed into the walls (Fig. 5, left). During the initial annealing, the PPG could support and stabilize the wall structure. After the removal of the solutions, the PPG began to be carbonized and coated onto the walls (Fig. 5, middle). Under capillary forces and crystallization, the porous structure collapsed little by little (Fig. 5, right).
 Fig. 5  Solvent evaporation, carbonization, and crystallization during the annealing of TiO2 fibers with addition of polyethylene–polypropylene glycol. 
Based on the “weakest link theory” (the theoretical model tube is made up of some chains: when the chains are subjected to forces at both ends, one section will break, resulting in the collapse of the whole tube), the hydrophilic chains inside the walls may create fissures for the break.38 Generally, a tube composed of n chains may break by chance: (5)in which, 1 − (Pf)i could be developed by the formula of Tailor, 1 − (Pf)i = exp(−(Pf)i), thus (6)If the density function of the fissures (weakest link) is defined as N(σ), the broken probability per unit length would be: Pf = 1 − exp[−∫ N(σ)dL](7)
The longer the L, the more chances the tube will break. The abundance of hydrophobic chains could not tolerate the crushing stress and resulted in nanoscale particles, rather than bulky grains. It is easy to understand that no macro-stress was reflected in the XRD patterns. Thus, it can be said that the TiO2 fibers obtained by this means could keep their photocatalytic activity and integrity as a fiber well.
3.4 Carbon composition
To identify the existence of C inside the anatase fibers, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs) was employed to analyse the atomic composition of the fibers (Fig. 6, left). The composition rate of C was calculated as ca. 1.0% (the control sample of pure-anatase fibers prepared under the same condition was used as a basic blank). Further investigations via DTA-TG (Fig. 6, right) indicated that, during annealing, the as-spun fibers lost 36.1% of their total weight, of which the evaporation of solvent and initial carbonization caused 35.5% between 25–415 °C. Other weight losses recorded may be due to the burning of resin carbons (0.6%) at 415–823 °C. If the fibers are annealed at low oxygen concentrations, the loss of weight through evaporation may no longer be a dominant contribution. About 6.9% of weight loss occurred between 300–400 °C. In contrast, the air-annealed fibers only slightly lost weight (4.5%). Based on the above results, it could be deduced that the C-doping composition was 1.0%–4.3% in the fibers. However, it is difficult to further determine the accuracy of doping of C by these means since the carbon inside the fibers may be in graphitic, amorphous, and carbonate phases. However, the C replacement of lattice O (C@O) should be almost impossible to occur in our cases.
 Fig. 6  Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs, left) of C@Ti/anatase fibers and differential thermal and thermal gravimetry analysis (DTA-TG, right) of fibers before and after annealing under different atmospheres. 
XPS measurements of the C 1s binding energy confirmed the existence of carbonate in the samples. For the C doped sample, curve fitting peaks at 284.5, 286.6, and 288.3 eV were found (Fig. S2). The peak at 284.5 eV is assumed to be adventitious carbon.39 The other two peaks might suggest the presence of a carbonate species.21 Although external factors could not be neglected in the results, the cation could be confirmed in the anatase lattice, while the anion has not been detected in the same sample. Thus, the C doping mode could be identified as the C replacement of Ti in the lattice –C@Ti.
3.5 DRS analysis
To investigate how C doping affects optical absorptivity, DRS analysis was carried out for the C@Ti/anatase and anatase fibers. As shown in Fig. 7, the wheat-colored C@Ti/anatase fibers can absorb light ranging from 200–465 nm. In contrast, the white-colored anatase fibers can only absorb light in the region λ < 390 nm. The energy band gaps of the samples could be calculated according to the equation40 widely adopted for crystalline semiconductors: α·hυ = A(hυ − Eg)n/2(8)where α, υ, A, Eg, and n are the absorption coefficient, incident light frequency, constant, band gap, and an integer (normally equal to 1, 2, 4, or 6), respectively. Obviously, the band gaps of anatase and C@Ti/anatase fibers are different in the direct/indirect structures. This may be due to the introduction of impurity energy levels between the conduction and valence bands. It was decided that the n values were 2 for the C@Ti/anatase fibers because of the existence of such indirect band gaps.41 Hence, the band gap of C@Ti/anatase (annealed at 450 °C) was determined to be 2.66 eV. The value was similar to that predicted by first principle calculations (see later).

The enhanced optical absorptivity of the C@Ti/anatase fibers could be utilized in the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants. Here, we chose two typical pollutants, TCP and MO, to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the fibers. It has been verified that TCP and MO are both stable under direct photolysis (Fig. 8). In the presence of immobilized nano-TiO2 (Degussa P25), the respective removal rates of TCP and MO were 74.1% and 67.8% within 120 min. The removal rates by pure anatase fibers were close to those by immobilized P25. However, the photocatalytic activity of C@Ti/anatase fibers was much higher than that of the other two. The removal rates of TCP and MO within 60 min were 87.8% and 94.3%, respectively.

The control experiment was carried out under the same conditions without a photocatalyst. 
3.6 Band structure and optical absorptivity
It is known that carbonate is not responsible for the visible light activity.20,42 Kamisaka et al.26 suggested that C-cation-doped TiO2 does not create gap states nor induce visible-light absorption. However, the C@Ti anatase fibers showed a higher photocatalytic activity than that of the pure anatase fibers, which needs further explanation based on semiconductor theory. The electron structure and wave function of C@Ti/anatase were investigated to explain the enhanced optical absorptivity observed. Considering the analyses of characteristics, significant internal stress was introduced into the theoretical calculations. This has not been reported in research related to C-doped TiO2. Here, anatase-TiO2 (tetragonal, space group I41/amd (141), cell lengths, a = b = 0.3784 nm, c = 0.9515 nm, cell angle, α = β = γ = 90°, by Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) was selected as the doping model based on XRD analysis, and was compared to C@Ti/anatase. Anatase crystals could be considered as stacked TiO6 octahedra. The slightly distorted TiO6 octahedra act as building blocks containing four shorter equatorial Ti–O bonds and two longer apical Ti–O bonds.
For a pure semiconductor, the band gap is generally flexible under lattice compression. Based on deformation potential theory,43–45 the band gap (Eg) change under stress could be represented by: Eg(σa,σc) = Eg(0) + baσa + bcσc(9)where Eg(0) is the band gap of the strain-free bulk crystals; and ba and bc are the band gap pressure coefficients (BGPC) of epitaxial and uniaxial stress, respectively. It has been reported that the Eg change of anatase when stress is applied along the weakest direction of the crystals is less than 40 meV Gpa−1.43
Unexpectedly, the lattice of anatase crystals became very “soft” after C@Ti doping. When −0.25–0.25 Gpa isotropic stress was applied to the C@Ti/anatase lattice, the lattices were distorted significantly (Fig. 9, left). The volume of the lattice did not change significantly but the C atom shifted from its original position and raised an axial migration. In contrast, the pure anatase was very “hard” and could maintain most of its lattices under isotropic stress as high as 1.0 Gpa. Furthermore, the band gap of C@Ti/anatase was calculated as 3.64 eV, which is even broader than that of anatase. The result coincides with previous reports that C-cation-doped TiO2 does not produce new gap states.26
 Fig. 9  Lattice distortion of C@Ti/anatase under different isotropic stress (left) and anisotropic stress (right). Red sphere is C atom. The length of the colourful bars represents the relative width of the band gap, and the bar with blue-green zone shows the loss of optical absorption under visible light. xx represents the strain on the [100] direction; yy [010]; zz [001]. The ±0.15 Gpa are compressive strain and tensile strain. 
To find the weakest compressive direction, anisotropic stress was applied to the C@Ti/anatase lattice. As shown in Fig. 9 (right), the bonds of the lattice atoms on the (001) plane vary with compressive strain along the 100, 010, and 001 directions. The bond lengths parallel to the a axial increased with increasing compression strain, while the b parameter decreases with increasing the strain. Correspondingly, the Eg decreased from 3.64 eV to 2.98–3.06 eV. In contrast, the Eg increased to 3.89–3.94 eV when the tensile stress was applied in the 100 and 001 directions. No matter the compressive or tensile stress, the changes in Eg were over 2.0 eV Gpa−1, which is 50 times those of pure anatase.43
On account of the analysis of the density of states (DOS), the higher energy band corresponds to a major valence band contributed to by Ti 3d orbitals; the bottom of the conduction band consists largely of O 2p orbitals. Here C-doping did not change the constitution of the band gap since the C 2p level is located at lower than −6.0 eV, far from the Fermi level (see Fig. 10). However, the valence band split into two distinct peaks in the presence of C doping and gave a narrowed band gap.

Based on crystal field theory (CFT), the degeneracy of the five transition metal ion 3d orbitals would split into t2g orbitals (3dx2−y2 and 3dz2) and eg orbitals (3dxy, 3dxz, and 3dyz) in the O2− ion octahedral crystalline field.46 When the octahedra were deformed, the 3d orbitals distorted correspondingly, resulting in a split of eg orbitals (such as Jahn–Teller distortion for perovskite). In our case, the close contact between C and Ti ions may cause not only distortion of the lattice but also induce splitting of the Ti 3d orbitals. Therefore, the change of band structure aroused by the lattice stress and distortion may explain the reason why the calculated band gap of C-doped TiO2 does not coincide with the experimental results.
4. Conclusion
By electrospinning a titanate sol–gel mixture, nanoporous anatase fibers with cation-doping were obtained. The difunctional copolymer (PPG) templated the nanoporous structure and transformed the material into C@Ti under low oxygen annealing. Both functions, pore-forming and C-doping, would be beneficial to the enhancement of optical absorptivity and photocatalytic activity of the fibers. Adding the recyclability of the fibrous membrane, the C@Ti/anatase fibers may be promising candidates for photocatalysis applications in wastewater treatment.
Theoretically, the band structure of C@Ti/anatase fibers was investigated by first principle calculations. Interestingly, although C-doping did not directly affect the electron structure of anatase, the “softened” lattice of anatase crystals would distort under slight stress and induce the narrowing of the band gap, resulting in enhanced optical capacity. This finding may be helpful in understanding the high photocatalytic activity of doped photocatalysts by considering non-negligible internal stress.
