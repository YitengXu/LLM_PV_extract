    , Accepted 8th January 2022First published on 10th January 2022AbstractThe past several years have witnessed remarkable research efforts to develop high-performance photovoltaics (PVs), to curtail the energy crisis by avoiding dependence on traditional fossil fuels. In this regard, there is an urgent need to accelerate research progress on new low-dimensional semiconductors with superior electronic and optical properties. Herein, combining abundant related PV experimental data in the literature and our systematic theoretical calculations, we propose two-dimensional (2D) InSb/GaAs and InSb/InP-based tandem PVs with high solar-to-electric efficiency up to near 30.0%. Firstly, according to first-principles calculations, the stability, electronic and optical properties of single-layer group-III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) are systematically introduced. Next, due to the high bandgap (Eg) of GaAs and InP being a perfect match with the low Eg of InSb, InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem PVs are constructed. In addition, the complementary absorption spectra of these two subcells can facilitate the achievement of high tandem power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, we have analyzed in detail the influencing factors for PCE and the physical mechanism of the optimized match between the top and bottom subcells in the tandem configurations. Our designed 2D-semiconductor-based PVs can be expected to bring a new perspective for future commercialized high-efficiency energy devices.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaics (PVs) have been regarded as very promising to replace traditional fossil fuels.1 Over the past few decades, silicon (Si)-based solar cells (SCs) have been the main source in the PV market. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in an Si-based single-junction SC means it is still difficult to exceed the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit.2 This is mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, a photon energy larger than the bandgap (Eg) of the semiconductor can lead to thermalization loss because of the extra energy. Secondly, a photon energy smaller than the Eg of the semiconductor can result in absorption loss because the energy cannot reach the bottom of the conduction band.3 Hence, the balance between decreasing the thermalization loss and utilizing more photons can enhance the PCE to potentially surpass the S–Q limit. So far, rapid research advances have been made to try to exceed the S–Q limit, such as intermediate band PVs,4 multiple exciton generation and quantum confinement,5 thermophotovoltaic concentration PVs,6 and multi-junction tandem PVs.7 Among these, a tandem configuration via stacking a top cell with a high-Eg semiconductor and a bottom cell with a low-Eg semiconductor to build a double-junction tandem SC is supposed to be a favored way to raise the PCE.
Tandem PV devices can diminish the thermalization loss in a high-Eg absorber and utilize the absorption spectrum in a low-Eg absorber. The Eg relating to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc) is essential to the tandem PCE. The high-Eg material can catch high-energy photons to generate a large Voc with significantly decreased thermalization loss, whereas the low-Eg material can catch low-energy photons to widen the optical response.8 The most widespread double-junction tandem module incorporates a high-Eg top subcell (about 1.7–1.9 eV) and a low-Eg bottom sub-cell (about 1.1–1.3 eV).9 In past decades, numerous studies on tandem devices,10–13 especially Si-based tandem PVs, to achieve high tandem PCE have been reported, but only a few conform to the industrialization standard attributes for the Eg mismatch between the two subcells.14 Currently, Si/perovskite-based tandem PVs have been extensively studied.15–17 Nevertheless, the stability of perovskite in association with the mobilities of Si and perovskite,18,19 are yet unresolved issues. Thus, it is urgent to seek compatibility between Eg and high charge mobility to acquire high-performance tandem PVs.
Recently, several studies of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based photoelectric devices have been reported, especially in PVs and photocatalysis.20–22 Although the PCEs of 2D material-based SCs can be up to about 20%,23,24 this is still below the S–Q limit. Furthermore, we find that 2D semiconductors possess tunable Eg and higher carrier mobilities,25–29 which will hopefully fulfill the requirements of tandem PVs. Taking the successful application of Si-based tandem PVs into account, therefore, our target is to search for a bottom-cell semiconductor approaching the Eg of Si with the Eg of the top-cell semiconductor matching the bottom material. Meanwhile, the bottom- and top-subcell materials possess higher stabilities and mobilities.
In this work, the stability, electronic, carrier mobility and optical properties of single-layer hexagonal group-III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) are systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The XY monolayers have adjustable Eg ranging from 0.51 to 3.21 eV. Remarkably, the Eg of single-layer GaAs, InP, and InSb are 1.82, 1.80, and 1.23 eV, respectively, which can be available as top- and bottom-cell materials to achieve high-performance double-junction tandem SCs. The top-cell materials (single-layer GaAs and InP) and bottom-cell materials (single-layer InSb) have notable carrier mobilities and absorbance in visible light. Considering the exceptional factors for PCE, we construct InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem SCs with PCEs of 27.8% and 30.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, we have analyzed in detail the factors influencing high PCE and the physical mechanism of the optimized match between the top- and bottom-subcells in the tandem configuration. Moreover, our few-layer or even single-layer GaN polymorphs with space group R3 m have been experimentally achieved.30,31 Therefore, the investigation not only provides a new insight into tandem SCs for 2D semiconductors but also a new opportunity for applications in the energy field.
2. Theoretical methods
2.1. DFT calculation details
Studies of the relaxed and electronic structures of single-layer group-III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb and Bi) are carried out with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) codes.32 The exchange–correlation functional and ion–electron interactions are utilized as Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)33 under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)34 and projector augmented wave (PAW),35 respectively. The valence electrons of XY monolayers are Ga 4s2p1, In 5s2p1, N 2s2p3, P 3s2p3, As 4s2p3, Sb 5s2p3, and Bi 6s2p3, respectively. The plane-wave cutoff energy is 500 eV. The monolayers are optimized until the energy convergence criterion and residual Hellmann–Feynman forces are less than 10−5 eV and 0.005 eV Å−1, respectively. Because of the periodic boundary conditions of our materials, a 20 Å thick-vacuum space is used to avoid interlayer interactions. To decrease the effect of the underestimated bandgaps in the PBE functional, electronic structures are used with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)36 with 25% Hartree–Fock exchange energy for comparison. The 21 × 21 × 1 and 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k meshes within the Brillouin zone are performed based on PBE and HSE06 functionals, respectively. The van der Waals (vdW) correction is contained by the Grimme37 model in the long-range interlayer interaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characteristics
The unit cells of single-layer hexagonal group-III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) with two atoms are presented in Fig. 1a. The atomic positions are fully relaxed at each given monolayer. The equilibrium lattice parameters a, buckling heights h, and bond lengths l of XY monolayers are listed in Table S1,† consistent with previous studies.38–40 The lattice constants of GaY and InY monolayers show a gradual increase owing to the increase in atomic radii from N to Bi. Akin to a, the same trend can be observed in buckling h and bond l. The buckling is marked in Fig. 1a and the numerical value of buckling h is recorded in Table S1.† It is found that XN is a planar configuration, while XP, XAs, XSb, and XBi are in the buckled configurations. This may be attributed to the balance between the electrostatic potential energy of the ions and the sp2- and sp3-bonded hybrid energy, which indicates the tendency of each ion to have a trigonal planar or pyramidal structure.40
 Fig. 1  (a) Top and side views of single-layer group-III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) with a hexagonal honeycomb structure. Meanwhile, the 2D and 3D ELFs for single-layer GaAs are shown in (a) and (b). (c) The calculated phonon spectrum of single-layer GaAs. 
To further study the bonding nature of the monolayers, the Bader charge Q and electron localization functions (ELFs) are calculated. First, the Q is exhibited in Table S1,† which can quantitatively analyze the chemical bond by disclosing the gain or loss of the atomic valence electron. When the anion changes from N to Bi in our binary combinations, the charge transfer is discounted. This means that the greater the electronegativity difference for the XN monolayers, the more ionic charge is embodied in Q listed in Table S1.† Thus, the combination of Q and a makes the buckling energetically undesirable in the XN monolayers. Moreover, electrostatic energy is proportional to Q2/a2. The calculated results show that Q2/a2 decreases with the increasing atomic radii of group-V elements, if cation X is fixed. Therefore, the sp3 hybridization for the heavier elements Y′ (Y′ = P, As, Sb, or Bi) and the lower electrostatic energy (Q2/a2) for the XY′ monolayers also indicate that only XN monolayers possess planar structures.
Then, to uncover the extent of localization of the distribution of electrons and provide insights into the atomic bonding feature in the monolayers, the 2D and 3D ELFs can be seen in Fig. 1a and b, which can provide intuitive physical graphics of the chemical bonds. The upper and lower limits of the ELFs are 1 and 0 that represent the fully localized and delocalized electrons, respectively. ELF = 0.5 expresses the probability of electron-gas-like pairs. Fig. 1a demonstrates the ELF contour map of single-layer GaAs, and the remaining structures are displayed in Figs. S1–9a.† It should be noted that plentiful electrons gather around the center of all bonds rather than around atoms, indicating the steady covalent bonding between pairs of X and Y atoms. This indicates a covalent nature for the X–Y bond in the XY monolayers. The results are consistent with the calculated 3D ELF that is shown in Fig. 1b.
3.2. Stable property
To investigate structural stability, the cohesive energy Ecoh of the XY monolayers is calculated. The Ecoh of GaY (InY) monolayers is within the range of −11.06 (−9.40) to −5.87 (−5.53) eV per atom, which is lower than that of synthesized blue phosphorene (−5.18 eV per atom).41 This indicates that our 2D group-III–V materials have robustly bonded networks. Table S1† also shows that Ecoh increases with the increasing row number of the anion in each X subgroup. This is consistent with the tendencies of a and Q. Moreover, the dynamic stabilities of single-layer III–V materials are verified by phonon spectra. There are three acoustical (LA, TA, ZA) and three optical branches (LO, TO, ZO) for our single-layer XY, as illustrated in Fig. 1c and S10.† These 2D materials (except GaBi) have only slightly negative squares of frequency Ω(k) in the Brillouin zone, implying their dynamic stabilities. The phonon frequencies of transverse and longitudinal optical modes (ωTO and ωLO), coupled with the splitting magnitude Δω = ωLO − ωTO for our XY monolayers are shown in Table S1.† It can be observed that Δω exhibits an identical tendency to the electronegativity trend if the cation is set. Combined with the above Q result, greater charge transfer leads to larger Δω because of the large ionicity in the XN monolayers. Importantly, our few-layer or even single-layer GaN polymorphs (space group: R3m) have been experimentally synthesized.30,31 In summary, with the same elemental materials of group-III–V, our single-layer XY monolayers (excluding GaBi) can be prepared in the foreseeable future.
3.3. Electronic property and carrier mobility
The electronic property is paramount to determine the PV performance based on low-dimensional materials. The projected electronic structures of 2D group-III–V materials based on the PBE and HSE06 functionals are presented in Fig. 2a, S11 and S12.† We can observe that the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of XY materials (except XBi) is mainly contributed by the ms (m = 4 and 5) orbital of X and ns (n = 2, 3, 4, and 5) orbital of Y, whereas the valence-band maximum (VBM) is primarily dominated by the npz orbital of Y. With single-layer XBi, the CBM is mainly attributed to the 6pz orbital of Bi and ms orbital of X, but the VBM is principally ascribed to the 6px orbital of Bi. All of these results are consistent with that of the partial density of states (PDOS) and partial charge densities, which are plotted in Fig. S13.† Furthermore, the semiconducting natures of single-layer GaY (InY) are in the range of 0.11–1.95 (0.17–1.03) eV based on the PBE functional, as listed in Table S1.† Since the PBE method usually undervalues Eg, the HSE06 method is also computed for comparison. The attained Eg of single-layer GaY and InY with the HSE06 functional fall in the range of 0.51–3.21 eV and 0.53–1.80 eV, respectively, which are in good accord with previous results.40

Remarkably, the Eg of GaAs and InP monolayers are 1.82 and 1.80 eV from the HSE06 functional. Such 2D semiconductors with suitable Eg can be perfectly used as top-cell materials when matching low-Eg absorbers are applied in double-junction tandem SCs. The low-Eg of silicon (1.12 eV) is available in double-junction tandem SCs to improve the PCE.1,42 The difference in Eg between single-layer InSb with 1.23 eV and Si is only 0.11 eV. Hence, we predict that the low-Eg of single-layer InSb can associate well with the high-Eg of single-layer GaAs and InP during application in tandem SCs.
The electronic structure of monolayer GaAs is steeper near the CBM than near the VBM, as shown in Fig. 2a and S12,† indicating a smaller effective mass (m*) for the CBM. The 2D and 3D energy–momentum color graphics of our XY monolayers are calculated in Fig. 2 and S1–9(b–e).† Observing the energy–momentum curves, we see that the energies adjoining the VBM (K point) are anisotropic m*, except for XBi monolayers, whereas the energies near the CBM (Γ point) exhibit isotropy. To further accurately verify this, m* is calculated in detail. Meanwhile, owing to the necessity to obtain the carrier mobility stated below, an orthogonal supercell, which reflects the carrier conduction along the zigzag (x) and armchair (y) directions in a visual way, is built as presented in Fig. S14a.† The electronic band structure for the GaAs monolayer in a rectangular supercell is also given in Fig. S14b.† For single-layer GaAs, the energy–momentum curves near the Γ point in Fig. 2b and d indicate isotropy for electrons with an effective mass of 0.06m0. However, Fig. 2c and e show that the identical energy deviation near the K point along x and y directions is really anisotropic for holes with , . As the semiconductors of the top and bottom subcells contain P, As, and Sb elements, as mentioned above, we calculate the carrier mobilities of this element-based 2D group-III–V family, as summarized in Table S2.† The results show that the electron mobilities of our high-Eg single-layer GaAs and InP are up to 1452 and 1479 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 911 and 924 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively; while the hole mobilities, for two such high-Eg materials (single-layer GaAs and InP) achieve 15598 and 33107 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 24479 and 51424 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively. With the low-Eg semiconductor InSb, the obtained electron mobilities are superior to the hole mobilities, that are 2206 and 2155 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively. Compared to Si/perovskite-based tandem SCs, the carrier mobilities of our designed bottom-cell materials (single-layer InSb) and top-cell materials (single-layer GaAs and InP) are more favorable.18,43 The explicit results on mobilities are presented in Table S2.†
After determining the orbital contributions of these structures and excellent carrier mobilities of XY′′ (Y′′ = P, As, and Sb) monolayers, it is necessary to reveal the antibonding and bonding characteristics of projected electronic structures, which can be resolved by the Crystal Orbital Hamiltonian Populations (COHPs).44 It is widely accepted that the bonding and antibonding states are manifested as positive and negative energies in the COHP, respectively. Fig. 3a demonstrates that the X–Y′′ bond is the dominant contributor to the antibonding and bonding peaks located above and below the Fermi level (Ef). The integral of COHP  as a function of energy, is a feature of estimating the bond strength. With a decrease in the electronegativity difference between X and Y′′ atoms, the ICOHP values are reduced, as illustrated in Table S3.† The ICOHP values of every XY′′ monolayer are higher than those of prepared blue phosphorene,41 suggesting that our XY′′ monolayers possess very robust bonding strength. All the results indicate that our XY′′ monolayers prefer covalent bonding interaction, which is consistent with the above-stated ELFs.

3.4. Optical property
To exhibit a high PCE, it is essential for the tandem PV to be capable of absorbing a wide spectrum of solar energy. The optical absorption coefficients of our high- and low-Eg material XY′′ monolayers based on the GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW + BSE)45–47 and HSE06 functionals are considered in Fig. 3b and Fig. S15.† It can be observed that all of the semiconductors achieve 105 optical absorption intensity under both methods. The GW + BSE functional contains electron–electron and electron–hole Coulomb attraction, which is more precise than the HSE06 functional in the description of the absorption spectrum.48 The quasi-particle (QP) correction leads to an increase in Eg, and then a blue-shift of the absorption spectra, but the excitonic effect brings about a red-shift of the absorption spectra.20 The first bright excitonic energies (optical gap, EI) and QP bandgaps (EQP) are displayed in Table S3.† We find that the EIs are comparable with the bandgaps from the HSE06 method (EHSE). Moreover, for 2D semiconductors, there is a strong linear scaling law between EQP and the exciton binding energy (Eb), i.e., Eb ≈ EQP/4.49 Hence, the Eb of both the low-Eg InSb monolayer coupled with high-Eg GaAs and InP monolayers are smaller than those of popular 2D semiconductors.50 Finally, both the low-Eg and high-Eg monolayers have an enormous capability for photo-absorption in visible light, especially under the GW + BSE functional. Therefore, our low-Eg InSb together with high-Eg GaAs and InP can have great potential to be the bottom and top subcells in tandem PVs.
3.5. Tandem PCEs of InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem SCs
We have constructed two tandem PV devices, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In a 4-terminal tandem system, the top subcell and bottom subcell are electrically disconnected; hence the optimizations and extracted output power of such two subcells are separate.51Fig. 4a depicts that the 4-terminal tandem configurations consist of a high-Eg top subcell and a low-Eg bottom subcell. On the basis of our designed tandem structures along with eqn (S1) and (S2),† the maximum PCEs of InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem SCs are computed, accompanied by the corresponding single-junction PVs. Actually, a heterobilayer comprising single-layer InSb and InAs acts as a type-II donor–acceptor interface band heterostructure, as exhibited in Fig. 5a and S16a.† Similarly, single-layer GaAs and GaS associated with single-layer InP and InSe can also serve as type-II band heterostructures, respectively. In the heterobilayer interface, such a type-II heterostructure could accelerate carrier (electron and hole) transport and deviation. According to Scharber et al.,52 the PCEs reach 20.6%, 17.4%, and 20.2% for InSb-, GaAs-, and InP-based single-junction SCs, as well as 27.8% and 30.3% for InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based double-junction tandem SCs, respectively. The accurate numerical values of double-junction tandem PVs are higher than those of single-junction PVs.

(b) Dispersion map demonstrating the tandem PCE versus the top-cell Eg and top-cell CB offsets. 
Next, we will analyze the reasons for this result. First of all, photons with an energy beyond the Eg of photoactive materials (Ephoton > Eg in purple in Fig. 4b) can be utilized and the induced carriers have an energy equal to Eg. The excess energy disappears through thermalization due to excited electrons being drawn back to the CBM. Second, photons with energy below the Eg of the absorbers (Ephoton < Eg in red, Fig. 4b) cannot be employed and finally dematerialize. The Eg of a photoactive material is vital to the PCE of a PV device since both open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are related to the Eg, and are the two pivotal factors for the PCE. In these circumstances, the majority of the solar energy radiation cannot be absorbed due to spectrum loss, because of the limited optical response of semiconductor absorbers. These conclusions are in satisfactory agreement with the results for the relationships among the output power, energy loss of low-Eg and thermalization loss of high-Eg for the absorbers, as illustrated in Fig. S16b.† All these reasons lead to low PCE in single-junction SCs.
To capture solar energy better, two photoactive layers for absorbing high- and low-energy photons are stacked to build double-junction tandem SCs, as shown in Fig. 4a.1,42 In contrast with single-junction SCs, double-junction SCs possess high output power with high- and low-Eg absorbers, low energy loss below-Eg and thermalization (Fig. 4c). The optical responses in such two tandem SCs are displayed in Fig. 4d, where high- and low-Eg absorbers of the solar spectrum are assigned two different colours, integrated with three single-junction SCs for comparison. The GaAs- and InP-based single-junction SCs can absorb only 45.4% and 46.3% of the solar spectrum, respectively, whereas their tandem counterparts absorb 74.5% of solar light. Though the InSb-based single-junction SC can utilize solar light analogous to InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem SCs (74.5%), the high-Eg thermalization loss for the two tandem PVs are far below those of our homologous single-junction PVs. Quantitatively, the PCEs of our tandem PVs are obviously preferable to those of single-junction PVs in approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. From the aforementioned quantitative PCEs, our InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem PVs are up to 27.8% and 30.3% respectively, as specially marked in Fig. 5b. These two efficiencies of InSb-based tandem PVs are far greater than the corresponding single-junction PVs and parallel with that of available PVs (Table S4†), like silicon/perovskite tandem SCs (28.3% and 27.9%),53,54 but superior to BTPV-4F/PTB7-Th (16.4%)55 and amorphous silicon/organic tandem SCs (15.1%).56 Furthermore, ultrathin InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem SCs could be constructed by stacking in a heterostructure manner to prompt absorption of incident sunlight.57,58 Our newly designed tandem PVs could offer a new opportunity to explore compound nanomaterials in commercialized high-performance photovoltaic devices.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have comprehensively discussed a series of 2D III–V materials (XY, X = Ga and In, Y = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) according to first-principles calculations. The calculated results show that XY monolayers possess tunable bandgaps in the 0.51–3.21 eV range. In particular, the bandgaps of single-layer GaAs, InP, and InSb are 1.82, 1.80, and 1.23 eV, respectively, which can favorably be used as top- and bottom-cell materials in obtaining highly-efficient double-junction tandem SCs. Simultaneously, the mobilities of top-cell materials (single-layer GaAs and InP) and bottom-cell materials (single-layer InSb) are up to the order of magnitude of 103 even 104 cm2 V−1 s−1. Our predicted three absorbers show excellent absorbance in visible light. Based on these superior parameters related to high-efficiency SCs, we first designed four-terminal InSb/GaAs- and InSb/InP-based tandem PVs with tandem PCEs of 27.8% and 30.3%, respectively. Hence, our newly designed 2D-semiconductor-based PVs can be expected to bring a new perspective to future commercialized high-efficiency energy devices.
