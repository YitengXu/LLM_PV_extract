Although the certified PCE of PSCs has been enhanced up to 25.5% in the single-junction structure, long-term stability is still a critical restraining factor for their commercial application because the frail stability of organic–inorganic perovskite materials inevitably induces degradation of the photoactive layer, reduction in photovoltaic device performance, and increase in fabrication cost and impact potential applications. Moreover, the degradation of perovskite materials can cause leakage of lead compounds, which will lead to health and environmental issues. Therefore, it is necessary to recycle PSC components used for industrial fabrication. In this review, we discuss the necessity for recycling and different methods for recycling transparent conductive oxide substrates without/with carrier transport materials, toxic lead compounds in perovskites, metal electrodes and monolithic structures. Moreover, the recycling protocol has been discussed according to various stacked architectures. Finally, the outlook of next-stage recycling in perovskite photovoltaics has also been suggested for promoting eco-friendly large-scale fabrication and application.Fengjiu YangFengjiu Yang is a postdoctoral researcher of Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB), Germany.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were first developed in 2009 and have demonstrated a sharp increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.5% in the single-junction architecture.1–5 Derived perovskite photovoltaics has also achieved unprecedented development in PCE, including 29.1% of perovskite/silicon, 24.2% of perovskite/copper–indium–gallium–selenide and 24.8% of perovskite/perovskite monolithic tandem solar cells.3,6 The unprecedented development of PSCs should be attributed to the intriguing properties of perovskite materials, including large light photon absorption,7 high carrier mobility,8,9 long carrier diffusion length of carriers,10–12 tunable bandgap,13–15 low exciton binding energy.10,16 Although the highest efficiency (25.5%) of PSCs is close to the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limited efficiency (30.5%), stability is still a fatal limitation factor for further development because of the apt degradation of perovskite materials caused by internal and external conditions, including the quality of the perovskite crystal phase, perovskite film, ionic migration, ambient humidity, oxygen and thermal stress.
Although countless endeavors have been devoted to improving the stability of PSCs, the longest the encapsulated module PSCs using 2-dimensional (D)/3D (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3–perovskite as the light harvester could sustain one year without a significant decrease in stability at ambient conditions with 55 °C.17 However, the efficiencies reported in this work were only 14.6% and 11.6% on the small and module active areas, which are much far from the requirement for commercial application. The RbI additive-engineered PSCs just maintained 92% after 1000 h under 85°C/85% with 1 cm2 active area and glass encapsulation.18 Other efforts have been made to enhance the stability of PSCs, such as reduction or removal of methylammonium (MA),19,20 2D perovskite interface engineering,21,22 molecule interface passivation23,24 and perovskite precursor modification.25,26 Despite these, the stability still lags behind the requirements for commercial application because the inevitable degradation of perovskite materials triggers the issues of toxic material disposal and rare material consumption.
The mainstream PSCs have the toxic element lead and other non-ecofriendly components, which would inevitably result in toxic substance leakage, environmental pollution and consumption of such materials that especially can remain long-term inside living bodies and cause uncertain effects. Additionally, the application of expensive transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates (such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO),27 indium tin oxide (ITO)) and noble metal electrodes (such as gold, Au) makes up about 15% and 20% of the total cost of PSC fabrication, according to previous calculation,28 which seriously consumes rare resources, especially the noble materials Au and indium. The one-time utilization of these materials tremendously increases the fabrication cost of PSCs and hinders large-scale application. Therefore, it is necessary to recycle the critical components of PSCs to reduce environmental pollution, rare material consumption and fabrication cost for industrial applications.
Based on the aforementioned issues, herein, we have reviewed the progress in recycling PSC components, including TCO substrates (FTO and ITO), TCO substrates with an electron transport layer, lead compounds (such as lead iodide, PbI2), metal electrodes and monolithic substrates with carrier transport layers. We have first reviewed all possibilities of the components to realize a more eco-friendly and low-cost fabrication of PSCs because of their frail long-term stability. Finally, the summary and recycling protocols, as well as the outlook of the next-stage PSC recycling, have also been discussed for further lowering the cost and environmental impact and facilitate potential industrial applications.
2. Importance of recycling
2.1 Degradation process and encapsulation of PSCs
It is known that organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are not very stable because of the organic composition of perovskite materials and their sensitivity to internal and external factors, such as phase behavior,29,30 crystallinity,29 ionic migration (such as iodide and lithium ions),2,31,32 interface properties,31 electrical properties,31 humidity,33 oxygen,34 ultraviolet (UV) light,35 and temperature,36,37 which are critical challenges and must be urgently addressed to improve stability and aid further development and industrial application of PSCs. Moreover, degradation due to moisture happens frequently and usually induces both reversible and irreversible damages in perovskite films,38,39 especially irreversible degradation. For example, MAPbI3–perovskite undergoes degradation after exposure to ambient conditions without encapsulation. This degradation process ends within a few hours and is accelerated by additional factors like light illumination and thermal stress.34,36
The degradation process of MAPbI3–perovskite is usually divided into 4 stages, including the formation of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2 (eqn (1)) in the presence of H2O, the subsequent decomposition of MAI into CH3NH2 and hydroiodic acid (HI) (eqn (2)),40,41 followed by the continuous breaking of HI into H2 and I2 with the help of light and oxygen (eqn (3) and (4)).42 (1) CH3NH3I(aq) ↔ CH3NH2(aq) + HI(aq)(2) (3) 4HI + O2 ↔ 2I2(s) + 2H2O(4)
Along with the degradation process presented in eqn (1), the semiconductor characteristics of perovskite materials gradually deteriorate and reduce the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, including PCE and working stability.
Additionally, the oxidation of carrier transport materials (CTMs) affects the stability of PSCs because most CTMs use at least one organic material, small molecule or polymer, which are usually susceptible to oxidation both in the excited and ground states.43,44 The degradation of CTMs would accelerate moisture and oxygen penetration and induce perovskite decomposition.
Improving the operational stability of PSCs has become an interesting issue. Encapsulation seems to be an effective approach to improve the operational stability of solar cells and prevent some external impacts, such as moisture, oxygen invasion, thermal stress, and mechanical disruptions. A series of encapsulation methods have been developed for various solar cells. These include the structure of glass/ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)/silicon photovoltaics module/EVA/backsheet,45 the structure of glass/EVA or polyvinyl butyral/copper–indium–gallium–selenide photovoltaics module/transparent conductive electrode stack,46 and the architecture of TCO/photoanode/dye-sensitized solar cells electrolyte/photocathode/TCO with surlyn polymer.47 Some encapsulation approaches, such as glass moisture barrier,18 a SiO2 film and a UV-curable epoxy with a desiccant sheet,48 polyisobutylene as the moisture barrier with glass–glass,49 EVA and paraffin as encapsulants,50,51 have also been developed for enhancing the operational stability of PSCs by isolating them from the external environment. Although the encapsulation methods can prevent the PSCs from direct exposure to some external factors, such as thermal stress, oxygen invasion, and mechanical disruptions, the components of PSCs still cannot evade degradation caused by internal/external factors, such as halide segregation,52,53 ionic migration54 and UV light.55
Therefore, treatment after PSC degradation promotes urgent misgiving and washes away the dazzling halo because of the unavoidable degradation of PSCs because of the low stability of halide perovskites and organic CTMs.
2.2 High cost due to raw material consumption
The TCO substrates and metal electrodes are quite expensive and contribute a high fraction of the PSC fabrication cost, as shown by the calculation of the fabrication cost of each PSC piece28 in Table 1. The cost of gold (Au), hole transport materials (HTM) and FTO, ITO are about 25, 40, 100 and 2000 $ per square area according to previous reports.27,28 Additionally, one-time utilization of Au and indium will increase noble material consumption and wastage of rare resources, inducing weak competitiveness of PSCs in the photovoltaics market. Therefore, the recycling approach of PSC components is a valuable and interesting solution to the aforementioned challenges of perovskite material degradation, poor working stability, long-term energy payback and toxicity issue of perovskite photovoltaics.

2.3 Toxicity of lead
In the aforementioned degradation process, the leakage and treatment of lead content have become an inevitable issue because of its toxic nature and resultant environmental pollution. The non-biodegradable property of lead is a critical and prime consideration in ecological pollution, especially that of living beings. Fig. 1 shows the circulation of lead compounds in the human body, including absorption, distribution and excretion.56 As shown in this summary, the intake of lead chemicals can be in three ways: gastrointestinal, respiratory and dermal uptake.57,58 The kinetics of lead compound metabolism can be divided into three compartment-based categories,57,59,60 including blood transport (category one) throughout the body to soft tissues (category two), and finally to the skeleton, with a total encumbrance of 90% for 20–30 years. Additionally, the toxicity of lead compounds has a potential for incalculable effect on human health because even its “hazard level” has not been precisely determined. Some human body functions can be interfered as lead invades and impacts the central nervous, hepatic, hematopoietic and rental systems, causing serious disorders.61 Chronic lead toxicity is quite common and usually happens when blood lead level is about 40–60 μg dL−1, which can result in really severe damages if not treated on time and is usually accompanied by symptoms, such as encephalopathy, persistent vomiting, delirium, lethargy, convulsions and coma.62,63
 Fig. 1  Schematic summary of the lead compound metabolism inside the human body, showing absorption, distribution and excretion. For absorption, each intake route shows the amount of lead compounds that can be absorbed. Lead cannot be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and excreted from the body by feces. Lead can also not be absorbed through the respiratory and dermal routes and leave the body or lost via body movement, respectively. Lead remains inside the body in three compartments made of specific organs before being excreted. Reproduced from ref. 56 with copyright 2016, Springer Nature. 
Based on the several critical factors of PSCs, it is necessary to discuss and develop an efficient approach for recycling to solve the confronted challenges, including the fragile stability and degradation of PSCs, the toxicity of lead compounds and commercial interests and especially achieve low-cost eco-friendly fabrication and potential industrial applications.
3. Recycling the various components of PSCs
3.1 TCO recycling
TCO substrates can be divided into two categories: FTO and ITO, according to the composition. These TCO substrates are the most easily recyclable components of PSCs because the oxide materials are stable and don't need special treatment except for washing the perovskite materials and CTMs with various solvents after PSC degradation. Therefore, the recycling process of TCO substrates has been studied and realized the earliest compared with those involving other components. FTO/glass substrate recycling was first realized by washing the other components from degraded PSC devices via the procedures of dimethylformamide (DMF) immersion, ultrasonication and rinsing in solvents (chlorobenzene, deionized water, ethanol and acetone),64 as shown in Fig. 2a. The re-collected FTO/glass substrate retained almost the same transmittance, composition and sheet resistance as the fresh sample, as shown in Fig. 2b–d. The collected FTO/glass substrate was re-deposited with CH3NH3PbI3xClx–perovskite, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole transport layer (HTL) and silver electrode, which achieved 9.97% PCE comparable with that of the fresh FTO/glass PSCs (11.82%) without an electron transport layer (ETL), as shown in Table 2. The main reduction in performance could be attributed to the slightly increased series resistance and reduced shunt resistance of the recycled PSCs. The increased series resistance of the recycled PSCs had resulted from the slightly increased sheet resistance of the substrate because the other layers are the same, as shown in Fig. 2d and Table 2.

The photovoltaic performance of ETL-free PSCs is still not enough after recycling the FTO/glass, especially with the significant decrease in PCE after recycling. Therefore, Binek et al. also realized the recycling of FTO/glass substrate containing TiO2 as the ETL. The compact TiO2 layer was prepared from the sol–gel precursor solution consisting of a 0.43 mM solution of titanium isopropoxide and a 27.2 mM solution of HCl in 2-propanol. The components MAPbI3–perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, Au and TiO2 were washed or removed by using water, chlorobenzene, adhesive tape and DMF,27 as shown in Fig. 3a. The recycled FTO/glass substrate was dried at 100 °C before re-loading the fresh TiO2 ETL. The PSCs could maintain almost the same performance as the fresh device even after recycling for the 3rd time, as shown in Fig. 3b and c.

To realize ITO recycling from degraded PSCs, potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution has been employed by Augustine et al. as the single solvent to dissolve the aluminium electrode, calcium buffer layer, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), MAPbI3–perovskite and poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOTS:PSS, PH500),65 realizing the recycling of patterned ITO/glass substrate. Synchronized thermography was employed to characterize the electrical uniformity of the sample surface, as shown in Fig. 4a. The ITO substrate exhibited uniform electrical properties when treated with various concentrations of KOH compared with the reference ITO. The electrical uniformity significantly changed with a low-concentration KOH solution except for 1.5 M on recycled ITO substrate, which could have been inefficiently washed and retained some chemicals on the ITO surface. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs decreased from 8.15% to 7.20% after reusing ITO with a KOH concentration of 1.5 M. The FF and JSC were the reasons for performance reduction because of the increase in sheet resistance after recycling, as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4b. Interestingly, the performance of PSCs using 1.5 M KOH pre-treated ITO was higher than that without treatment because KOH could improve the wettability of the component layers.

Although the PSCs could sustain almost comparable photovoltaic performances with those of the fresh TCO/glass substrates, enough reduction of fabrication cost and environmental pollution was not achieved, especially with the wastage of ETL materials and metal electrodes.
3.2 ETL layer recycling
To improve the recycling performance of PSCs and increase the recycling times, TCO substrates with ETL layers have been exploited. A polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF, γ-butyrolactone (GBL) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was introduced by Kim et al. to remove the MAPbI3–perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL, realizing the recycling of the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) transparent layer coated on the FTO/glass substrate after 1 hour of annealing at 500 °C.66 As shown in Fig. 6, the PSCs could sustain a high photovoltaic performance after recycling ten times, except for a slight decrease in fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) because of the change in TiO2 surface morphology after recycling, according to Fig. 5a–d. The authors also demonstrated the reproducibility of this process of recycling mp-TiO2/FTO/glass substrates, and the statistical distribution of the results is shown in Fig. 5e; the PSCs sustained an almost constant performance even after ten rounds of recycling, comparable with those containing fresh mp-TiO2. This was the first time recycling a component of PSC for ten times was realized.

(e) The normalized PCE of PSCs on fresh and ten-time recycled mp-TiO2/FTO/glass substrates. Reproduced from ref. 66 with copyright 2016, Springer Nature. 
At the same time, Kadro et al. realized a much higher PCE after recycling the TiO2/FTO/glass substrate by employing a rapid process for dismantling the Au electrode and dissolving the other components by using chlorobenzene, ethanol and DMF as solvents.67 The achieved TiO2/FTO/glass substrate was re-deposited with MAPbI3–perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrode, achieving almost constant photovoltaic performance after the second recycling process similar to that of the PSCs with fresh TiO2/FTO/glass substrate (16.1% PCE), as shown in Fig. 6. The main reduction was seen in JSC among the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs on using the recycled TiO2/FTO/glass substrate, which could be the impact of perovskite crystallization from the residual solvents used for washing because the recycled substrate was consequently re-fabricated with perovskite without additional treatment.

Huang et al. employed the procedure of DMF immersion, ultrasonication in DMF and chlorobenzene, rinsing in deionized water, ethanol and acetone, and UV light treatment to recycle the TiO2/FTO/glass substrates with planar and mesoporous structures, which prevented lead content leakage, solid waste generation and environmental pollution.68 As shown in Table 2, the photovoltaic performance of the reused planar and mesoporous TiO2/FTO/glass substrates significantly decreased from 14.08% and 14.79% to 11.87% and 11.03%, respectively. The serious reduction in the performance of the recycled substrates could be attributed to the increase in series resistance and reduction in shunt resistance shown in Table 2 due to the surface morphology changes in perovskite films after re-loading twice. Moreover, the slightly increased series resistance of the reused substrates results from the augmented sheet resistance and impacts the performance of PSCs as the other layers are the same.
All the aforementioned explorations concentrate on high temperature and complicated processes for recycling the TiO2/FTO/glass substrates, which also incur additional cost and energy investment. Therefore, Zhao et al. employed the chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach to synthesize superaligned ZnO nanorods as the ETL on rigid and flexible transparent conducting aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) electrodes.69 These ZnO/AZO substrates could be recycled by washing the MAPbI3–perovskite using the DMF solvent and re-depositing the perovskite layer, HTL and Au electrode for new PSCs, as shown in Fig. 7a. The recycled rigid and flexible ZnO/AZO substrate PSCs could achieve slightly lower PCEs of 12.6% and 6.8% compared with those made of fresh ZnO/AZO substrates (13.5% and 7.2%), respectively. Authors also demonstrated the reproducibility of this process on the rigid substrate, indicating the narrow distribution of performance parameters on recycling, as shown in Fig. 7b. The main reduction in the PSC performance was seen in JSC and FF and could be attributed to the residual solvents on ZnO that impact the crystallization of the perovskite. The high bending durability of flexible PSCs was demonstrated, sustaining about 90% after 1000 cycles with a bending radius of 4 mm. This outstanding performance indicates a more useful application of PSC recycling.

3.3 Toxic lead-content recycling
Apart from the ETL/TCO/glass substrates, recycling the most important component made of lead compounds (such as PbI2) is a critical issue with Pb–PSCs because Pb raises concerns about the potential toxicity of perovskite materials and their impact on biological systems and the environment.70–72 Moreover, Pb is the most difficult component to separate and recycle because of solubility and purification issues. Therefore, recycling Pb components is a valuable and challenging topic.
Researchers have employed non-polar solvents, such as chlorobenzene and toluene, to remove the Au/HTL layers.66 Then, they utilized the difference in the dissolution kinetics of polar protic and aprotic solvents using various dipoles, including 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, water, and acetone, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile, γ-butyrolactone, to realize Pb component recycling, respectively. They found that the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) peaks of PbI2–DMF shifted downwards compared with those of the DMF solution, indicating that the polar aprotic solvent DMF could form metal halide–DMF bonds, thus generating a PbI2–DMF structure via the Pb–O bond between the partially negative oxygen atom in DMF and partially positive Pb2+ cations, according to the resonance of DMF. This bonding dissociates the PbI6 octahedral frame to form the skeleton of the organic–inorganic perovskite material, resulting in high solubility of the perovskite materials in polar aprotic solvents. Therefore, they took advantage of this merit of DMF to realize the separation and re-collection of the lead component. PbI2 recycling has also been realized by using methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, ethyl acetate and deionized water to dissolve MAI.67 They found the methanol was the fastest change MAPbI3 into PbI2, following by deionized water, ethanol, 2-propanol, and ethyl acetate. Ethanol would be the best choice because of its lower toxicity to humans and the environment. However, deionized water was preferable for PbI2 recycling because only 0.03% Pb content remained after purification, which is much lower than those obtained with ethanol, methanol and 2-propanol. In addition, DMF contained about 99.8% lead content, which is good for recycling. However, PbI2 in this work could not be directly reused for perovskite fabrication without purification.
The non-volatile property of PbI2 compared with the organic component of perovskite materials favors the recycling possibility of lead compounds,42 as shown in Fig. 8. The PbI2 component remained on the TiO2/FTO/glass substrates after MAPbI3–perovskite degradation and released the volatile MAI. Then, the organic component of MAI was re-spin-coated on the aforementioned substrate with PbI2, which resulted in a perovskite film that could sustain almost the same optical properties, as shown in Fig. 8. The characteristic shoulder absorption peaks of PbI2 blue-shifted from around 750 nm to approximately 500 nm after MAI was evaporated compared with the fresh perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 8c, e and g. However, these absorption peaks could be recovered back at about 750 nm after depositing fresh MAI to form a perovskite film with comparable density, as seen in Fig. 8c, e and g. While the PL intensity of the single-step chloride deposited perovskite film was almost like that of the degraded film, the single-step acetate approach presented the maximum intensity compared with those of the single-chloride and sequential deposition routes, even higher than that of the fresh perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 8d, f and g. This indicated that the single-step acetate approach of recycling the lead source was more easily achievable via scanning electron microscope.

The direct recycling of lead compounds in PSCs was not realized because of the challenges in segregation and purification from the degraded MAPbI3–perovskite. Binek et al. found a special bonding between DMF–PbI2 after washing the MAPbI3–perovskite by using the DMF solvent and realized the re-application of PbI2 after recycling.27 The collected PbI2 was re-dissolved in DMF and deposited on a fresh TiO2 film surface for new PSCs. As shown in Fig. 9a, the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs significantly decreased from 14.6% to 12.1% after the first-time recycling of PbI2, especially the FF and VOC values. However, the perovskite film exhibited almost the same cross-sectional morphology before and after PbI2 recycling, as shown in Fig. 9b and c. The reduction in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs could be attributed to the lower purity of re-collected PbI2 compared with the fresh sample, and this became much better after the recrystallization of PbI2, as shown in Fig. 9a.

The aforementioned direct recycling of lead compounds is quite difficult because of the high purity requirements for the satisfactory photovoltaic performance of PSCs, inducing the inevitable process of lead leakage and treatment. Therefore, the encapsulation of PSCs during working seems a critical means. Generally, glass has been employed as a typical material for encapsulation but the lead leakage was still too high according to the observation under various conditions by Jiang et al.73 At the same time, they found that epoxy resin-based polymers could significantly reduce the lead compound leakage rate from 30 to 0.08 mg h−1 m−2 under simulated weather conditions compared with that using glass, thereby realizing a reduction in environmental pollution. A more safe encapsulation approach and material exploitation would be another interesting research topic for preventing lead compound leakage.
3.4 Metal electrode recycling
Metals, especially Au, are typically used as contact electrodes in high-photovoltaic performance PSCs.2,74–77 The Au electrode contributes 20% of the cost of PSCs because it is an expensive noble material.27,28 Therefore, recycling Au electrodes is critical to reduce noble material consumption, fabrication cost and environmental pollution. Polar aprotic solvents, such as DMF, GBL or DMSO, could also be used to recycle the Au electrode by removing the perovskite layer and HTL (spiro-OMeTAD),66 as shown in Fig. 10. However, the recycled Au electrode could not be directly redeposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum condition without any refining because of the lightweight, the small size of the pieces and impossible direct transfer. The same challenge has been encountered in other work when the authors recycled the Au electrode and could not directly re-utilize it because of the low mass that cannot withstand the suction produced during pumping.67 Some of the organic HTMs could still be found in the Au electrode film and have to be washed by using HCl.
 Fig. 10  Optical images of PSCs before and after selective dissolution. The yellow metal is the Au electrode. Reproduced from ref. 66 with copyright 2016, Springer Nature. 
Hence, it is necessary to develop a novel approach for loading the Au electrode in PSCs that can replace the typical procedure of thermal-high vacuum deposition and realize recycling. A mechanical drying and transfer process has been developed by Yang et al. to load the nanoporous Au (nano-Au) film on a supported membrane film to form the contact electrode of PSCs by utilizing the high specific surface area of the nano-Au film,28 as shown in Fig. 11. This nano-Au electrode enabled the PSCs to achieve a high PCE of 19.0% in the reverse scan, which is comparable with the highest PCE reported for carbon-based PSCs by using complicated multisteps preparation processes.78 This nano-Au film was recycled and reused on fresh PSCs after dissolving the HTL and perovskite films with acetone and drying on a fresh membrane film at room temperature in ambient conditions, as shown in Fig. 11a. The recycled nano-Au film PSCs could realize almost the same performance as that in the first-time utilization (av. 16.45%) and much better than that of the evaporated Au (evap-Au) film, as shown in Fig. 11b and c. Finally, the nano-Au film-recycled PSCs sustained about av. 14.89% PCE after recycling for the twelfth time, which is the highest photovoltaic performance of recycled PSCs and the times of repeated recycling compared with those in other reports, as shown in Fig. 11d and e and Table 2. The main reduction in the recycled nano-Au PSC parameters was the decrease in JSC and FF, which could be attributed to the loss of active area of the nano-Au film and residual chemicals in nanoporous holes of the Au film based on characterization using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This nano-Au film could be employed on a flexible substrate to enhance the bending durability. This novel approach of mechanical transfer of the nano-Au film could reduce the energy and noble metal consumption according to the device cost calculation, thus reducing environmental pollution, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 11f. Moreover, this process solves the challenges in the typical high-temperature and vacuum deposition processes and can possibly be applied in flexible PSCs.

3.5 Recycling of monolithic structure
To simplify the recycling process of PSCs, the re-fabricated monolithic structure has become the preferable selection, including the contact electrode, HTL, ETL and the TCO/glass substrate. A 2 μm thick mesoporous NiO layer was deposited as the back electrode on the TiO2 ETL surface using the printing approach after printing a 1 μm thick Al2O3 spacer layer, forming a monolithic mesoporous structure before perovskite loading.79 Then, the perovskite was deposited on the m-NiO/Al2O3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO/glass substrate to fabricate PSC devices. As for recycling, the perovskite was re-loaded on the above substrate after dissolving the degraded perovskite in DMF, ethanol and drying on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min, as shown in Fig. 12a. The performance of PSCs decreased from 13.6% (fresh) to 12.1% PCE with the recycled monolithic substrate, especially with a reduction in JSC and FF, as shown in Table 2. This recycling approach showed high reproducibility when tested on 10 different devices, as shown in Fig. 12b. The authors mentioned that the reduction in photovoltaic performance after recycling could be attributed to some damages in the m-NiO film during the rinsing process.

(e) IPCE response of the pristine 300/150 cell and recycled cell (1st). Reproduced from ref. 80 with copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. 
Li et al. also employed a monolithic structure substrate to realize the recycling process by sequentially depositing Ni and Au on the top of the mesoscopic layer (mp-TiO2 and mp-Al2O3, ETL) under a working pressure < 6 × 10−6 Torr and realizing the fabrication of the nanoporous NiO/Au electrode (HTL/contact electrode) after annealing under an ambient atmosphere at a high temperature of 500 °C for 45 min,80 as shown in Fig. 12c. Then, the perovskite light harvester was deposited on the monolithic structure to form the complete PSC device. As for the recycling process, perovskite was re-deposited on the monolithic structure after washing the MAPbI3–perovskite material using DMF. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs slightly decreased after recycling the monolithic structure, especially the VOC and JSC values, as shown in Fig. 12d and Table 2. The incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) also exhibited a relatively obvious reduction, as shown in Fig. 12e. The reduction in PSC performance after recycling the monolithic structure could be attributed mainly to the decrease in the specific surface area of the nanoporous-mesoporous films after rinsing the perovskite and the increase in resistance because of the residual perovskite compounds. Moreover, the recombination loss in the reused monolithic mesoporous substrate also would be increased because some PbI2 did not convert into perovskite.
Although the monolithic structure simplifies the recycling process and material consumption is reduced by using inorganic materials, such as HTL, the monolithic porous structure reduces the capacity of perovskite light harvester loading and the ability of photon utilization. Moreover, the high thickness of the porous structure limits carrier transport-diffusion and increases recombination loss, resulting in a relatively unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance compared with the mainstream development of PSCs, especially the JSC and VOC. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a more efficient approach to realizing the recycling of PSCs.
4. Recycling protocol
As mentioned above, although the recycling studies have just started recently, the eye-catching achievements of recycling have accelerated the development of PSCs, as shown in Fig. 13. The recycling process has been studied and realized using several approaches for specific components. In addition, the highest recorded performance of recycled PSCs is over 90% after recycling the twelfth time, demonstrating the feasibility of recycling, eco-friendly fabrication and harmless application. Additionally, the low-cost fabrication approaches of PSCs should be given more attention to reducing consumption at the initial step, such as by using novel ETMs and cheap electrode contacts.78,81–83 However, the recycling cycles should be further increased to shorten the energy-payback time since the PSCs show a fragile stability. Moreover, it is necessary to develop more eco-friendly solvents and techniques to realize the recycling of PSCs.
 Fig. 13  Summary of the normalized PCE of PSCs after recycling using various approaches in comparison with the initial efficiency. P: planar, M: mesoporous and N: nanorods. 
Additionally, the solvents employed for recycling are usually decided based on the nature of components and main goals, as shown in Table 3. The architecture of PSCs also decided the solvent selection. As for the n-i-p structure, DMSO and DMF could be used for only TCO recycling because of the strong polar nature and solubility. However, for the layer-by-layer exfoliation or recycling, adhesive tape, chlorobenzene (such as spiro-OMeTAD) and DMF could be employed to realize the removal of the metal electrode, HTM, lead compounds and ETM (such as TiO2). On the contrary, for the architecture of p-i-n, DMSO, DMF and KOH could be used for only TCO recycling because of high solubility. The recycling process could use tape, chlorobenzene, DMF and acetone to realize the layer-by-layer exfoliation of PSCs with a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer depending on the natures of the recycled layers. However, the recycling process would become more complicated when BCP is replaced with atomic-layer-deposited SnO2. In addition, the utilization of green solvents, such as ethanol, GBL and N,N-diethylformamide,84 for PSC recycling is a critical issue because DMF, DMSO and chlorobenzene can have harmful effects on the biological and environmental systems. Therefore, it is necessary to select appropriate solvents for dissolving different materials and recycling PSC components with an eco-friendly approach. Some challenges of the recycling technology still need further investigation to realize high performance in PSCs after recycling and accumulate scientific research findings for commercial applications, such as structure-dependent recycling routes, solvent exploitation and selection, device performance reduction mechanisms.

5. Outlook
Although perovskite photovoltaic devices have achieved a high PCE of 25.5% for the single-junction and 29.1% for the perovskite/silicon tandem architectures, the frail stability of perovskite materials still hinders further development and industrial application because of the long-term energy-payback. Further, the degradation of lead compounds in perovskite materials usually raises the concern of environmental issues because of potential leakage of lead. Moreover, the application of noble metallic materials significantly increases the fabrication cost and noble material consumption for single-time utilization. Therefore, the recycling process of PSC components has become an interesting research topic for eco-friendly fabrication and application. Although some precious endeavor has been invested in the recycling process, the achievements of recycled PSCs are not satisfactory because of the low photovoltaic performance with the number of recycling cycles and re-application of materials. Hence, it is necessary to invest more effort into recycling research; with this, even the long-term stability issue in perovskite photovoltaics would be solved in the future.
The mechanical transfer of PSC components seems to be a feasible and possible approach to further enhance the PCE by fabricating the carrier transport layer/TCO/glass substrate, perovskite light harvester and carrier transport layer/contact electrode. For instance, the HTL/contact electrode of a copper film can be fabricated with a nanoporous morphology, and one side of the copper film can be attached to the oxide component that acts as the HTL. This copper oxide film can then be transferred onto the perovskite/ETL/TCO/glass substrate to fabricate normal-structured PSCs and realize the mechanical transfer process with the nanoporous Au film, which would possibly improve the photovoltaic performance of recycled PSCs approaching that of the typical fabrication process. Recycling the individual layers would be easier and reduce material consumption. Moreover, it is possible to employ individual layer recycling to fabricate large-scale modules for perovskite photovoltaics and tandem solar cells because of the much higher PCE compared with that of the single-junction, thus realizing industrial production and accelerating commercial applications. Additionally, exploring and employing a more low-cost recycling material, such as carbon-based materials, is another approach to reduce the fabrication cost and metallic material consumption and replace the current expensive noble materials.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic summary of the lead compound metabolism inside the human body, showing absorption, distribution and excretion. For absorption, each intake route shows the amount of lead compounds that can be absorbed. Lead cannot be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and excreted from the body by feces. Lead can also not be absorbed through the respiratory and dermal routes and leave the body or lost via body movement, respectively. Lead remains inside the body in three compartments made of specific organs before being excreted. Reproduced from ref. 56 with copyright 2016, Springer Nature.
