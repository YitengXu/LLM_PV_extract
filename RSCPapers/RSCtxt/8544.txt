    , Accepted 18th March 2016First published on 21st March 2016AbstractA facile, energy-efficient microwave assisted hydrothermal (MW-HT) method has been demonstrated to synthesize hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO nanostructures. The obtained product was characterized using structural, morphological and optical studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The obtained results revealed that nanostructured ZnO possesses good crystalline properties and enhanced scattering ability. The nucleation and crystal growth mechanism for the synthesized ZnO has been investigated by changing the reaction parameters such as microwave power, reaction time and temperature. A systematic investigation has also been carried out on the influence of the reaction parameters upon the photovoltaic performance of fabricated ZnO-based dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It has been observed that ZnO nanostructures prepared in the microwave assisted power mode (300 W at 10 min) exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.12%, which is significantly higher than that of commercially purchased ZnO with a PCE of 1.08%. This could be attributed to the unique hierarchical jasmine-flower-like morphological features of the ZnO nanostructures prepared using a rapid MW-HT method.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), owing to their facile, unique hybrid architecture, relatively low-cost and an eco-friendly fabrication process, have been gaining significant attention as promising candidates for the future clean energy conversion technology.1–5 The core part of DSSCs is made up of a wide band-gap semiconductor photoanode, where structural and morphological tuning significantly influences the cell performance by controlling light collection and charge transport.5 Recently, several metal oxide-based semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, Nb2O5, Bi2O3etc. have been successfully investigated as photoanode materials for DSSCs. A benchmark power conversion efficiency of DSSC more than 12% was reported recently using porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 with Co2+/3+ redox electrolytes.4
Particularly, the ZnO based-photoanode has been gaining much attention, because of its direct and wide band gap (3.37 eV) in the UV spectral region, large exciton-binding energy (60 meV) which enables the persistence of excitonic emission over a wide range of temperatures, strong luminescence, high thermal conductivity as well as mobility (∼115–155 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, ZnO exhibits unique optical and electrical properties, which also make it a suitable candidate for many electronic, optoelectronic, sensor, piezoelectric and varistor devices.6 There have been several scientific reports which demonstrated the successful use of ZnO nanostructures as DSSC photoanodes, however the power conversion efficiencies of ZnO-based DSSCs are found to be low when compared to TiO2.7 This is due to the dissolution of ZnO and the subsequent formation of a dye–Zn2+ complex under acidic conditions, leading to low electron injection from the dye to ZnO. This issue can be ameliorated by reducing the dye-sensitization time that avoids the possible formation of a dye–Zn2+ complex and use of dye molecules with fewer carboxylic groups.8 In addition, the possibility of high electron mobility with reduced electron recombination in ZnO offers profuse scope to enhance the PCE of ZnO based DSSCs.
The PCE of ZnO mostly depends on its structure, morphology, aspect ratio, size, orientation and density of the crystal. Tremendous efforts have been made in recent years for the development of various organized complex, micro or hierarchical nanoarchitectures through self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks. To date, many nanostructures of ZnO have been effectively developed for DSSCs which include dimensionally modulated nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanorods and nanoflowers.9,10 However, the PCE has been hampered by insufficient surface area, poor dye-loading and low light scattering ability.11 Hence, the development of high surface area of photoanodes is desirable for more dye adsorption, which subsequently facilitates enhanced light harvesting ability. To achieve good efficiency, there is a prerequisite for achieving control over carrier recombination. Sakai and Wu et al. used a pre-treated FTO substrate by TiCl4 treatment to lower the possible recombination in photoanodes.12,13 In addition, several synthetic approaches were adopted to prepare one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures such as nanorods and nanotubes that provide a direct electron pathway with reduced recombination and possessing a higher surface area to volume ratio facilitating more dye adsorption.14 Hitherto, PCE values of ZnO reported for DSSCs vary and it exhibits values ranging from 0.02% to 7.5%. Recently, Law et al. demonstrated that their vertically aligned ZnO nanowire array photoanode exhibited a PCE of 1.5%.15 It was later proved that the surface area can be improved by providing additional dimensions to 1-D structures. Ko et al. reported a DSSC photoanode with a hydrothermally grown ZnO nanoforest morphology that showed a maximum PCE of 2.63%.16 Zhang et al. synthesized polydispersed aggregates of ZnO using the sol–gel method and achieved a maximum PCE of 5.4%.17 Moreover, it was also demonstrated that the enhancement in PCE of ZnO was observed owing to the high surface area provided by these hierarchical structures, which is desirable for better dye-loading and strong light-scattering abilities that promote light harvesting. In this regard, development of suitable synthetic strategies is essential for the synthesis of ZnO that could provide enhanced PCE. Although, various types of hierarchical ZnO structures have been prepared by hydrothermal, sol–gel, chemical bath deposition, electro-deposition, and sonochemical methods, they involved multiple steps, resulting in the consumption of more time and energy.18–21 Besides, some methods required organic additives for fine-tuning the morphology.22 These additives often involved careful washing of the synthesized products, as there is a considerable possibility of adsorption of organic molecules on the ZnO surface, thus hampering the PCE. Recently, hydrothermal or solvothermal (HT/ST) methods have been frequently used for the preparation of ZnO nanostructures as they can provide the desirable size and versatile morphologies by controlling the time, temperature and precursor concentrations. However, the complexity and time-consumption limit the applicability of these methods for large-scale production.
Significantly, controlled synthesis of nanostructures with a distinct morphology and particle size using a simple, one-step and energy-efficient method for the preparation of hierarchical ZnO has gained remarkable interest among researchers. Recently, microwave-assisted synthesis has gained massive attraction owing to its advantages such as low-cost, selectivity, high productivity and homogenous volumetric heating compared to the other conventional heating methods.23 Particularly, the method is not only “clean, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient” but also retains the capability of producing high quality functional metal oxide nanomaterials with size, chemical composition, and morphology that can be reliably tuned by changing the reaction conditions.24–34 Hence, the enhancement in product formation and feasibility to tune the morphology could make this synthesis process unique.
Thus in this work, a systematic study on the influence of microwave reaction parameters such as power, temperature and time on the growth of hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO nanostructures has been demonstrated. The possible crystal growth mechanism and the growth-dependent PCE of the ZnO nanostructures as photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells have been discussed in detail. To reduce the recombination of electrons and to avoid the formation of the dye–Zn2+ complex, the fabrication procedure was modified with both TiCl4 pre-treated FTO and dye-sensitization time has also been discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and Methods
All the chemical reactants were used as received without further purification. Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (Himedia, AR) and ammonium hydroxide (Spectrum chemicals, AR) were purchased and used as such. All the synthesis experiments were carried out in double distilled water. The precursor solution for ZnO was prepared by mixing 0.5 M zinc acetate dihydrate and fresh ammonia solutions at a volume ratio of v/v = 1:1 and a pH of nearly 10.
Microwave hydrothermal (MW-HT) processes were conducted by employing an Anton-Paar (Multiwave PRO) microwave reaction system SOLV. Initially, the precursor solution was mixed with distilled water in quartz vessels and subsequently placed on a turntable stage for uniform heating in the Anton-Paar microwave reaction system. The microwave irradiation time which varies with power and temperature was programmed using the Anton-Paar Multiwave Pro software. The automatic temperature and pressure control system allowed continuous monitoring and control of the internal temperature (±1 °C). The preset profile (time, temperature, pressure) was followed by automatically adjusting the applied power (0–900 W and pressure up to 80 bar). The system was operated at a high frequency of 2.45 GHz. After the reaction was completed, the reaction vessels were cooled using an inbuilt fast cooling fan system to ambient temperature. The white precipitate of ZnO deposited at the bottom of the quartz vessel was collected and washed several times by centrifugation with distilled water and finally with absolute ethanol. The obtained white precipitate was used for further characterization and fabrication.
2.2 Dye-sensitized solar cell device fabrication
The procedure for the fabrication of DSSCs was reported earlier.35 Here, 0.5 g of the prepared ZnO sample was dispersed into 4 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication for 10 minutes. Then 1.5 g of terpineol and 0.10 g of ethyl cellulose were added and the solution was again ultrasonicated to form a homogenous viscous paste. The prepared paste was deposited on a cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, purchased from Sigma Aldrich) glass substrate (transparent electrode which has a typical square sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 and an overall transmittance of about 85% in the visible light region) by the doctor-blade method to obtain a thickness of ∼17–22 μm using 3 M scotch adhesive tape into an area of 0.25 cm2 (with proper masking). After air-drying, the coated substrates were sintered at 400 °C for 30 minutes at a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. When room temperature was attained, the substrates were sensitized with 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 30 minutes. After the sensitization, the photoanodes were taken and rinsed with absolute ethanol to remove the additional dye molecules from the photoanode surface. For TiCl4 pre-treatment, the FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 minutes and then washed with water and ethanol.
Platinum (Pt) counter-electrodes were prepared by drop-casting isopropanol solution containing 5 mM H2PtCl6 upon a cleaned FTO-coated glass and subsequently annealing at 400 °C for 20 minutes. While assembling the DSSCs, two electrodes were sandwiched together with Surlyn film of thickness 30 μm as a spacer using two binder clips. The electrolyte solution containing 0.06 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M of iodine solution (I2), 0.10 M guanidiniumthiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15) was introduced between the two electrodes.
2.3 Material characterization
X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis of the prepared samples was carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) produced at 40 kV and 30 mA to scan the diffraction angles from 20–80°. Phase identification of the product was made using standard ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data). The morphology of the samples was analysed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM-SUPRA-55) – Carlzeiss, Germany, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken using a JEOL 3010 with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. Raman and room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Renishaw in Via system with an excitation energy of a 514 nm laser and a Fluoromax Spectrofluorometer (Horiba) respectively. The diffused reflection spectra (DRS) of ZnO were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan).
Photovoltaic (PV) measurements were performed using a Newport® 150 W 96000 solar simulator set at 100 mW cm−2 full spectrum power using an AM 1.5G filter. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were produced using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. To evaluate the performance of DSSCs, a minimum of five sets of DSSC devices were made using identical photoanode materials. The average of PCE values of each photoanode was reported as the final efficiency and the accuracy between each cell was maintained to be nearly 0.02%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure
The present work has demonstrated the systematic studies on hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO samples synthesized by the MW-HT method. The phase purity and morphology of samples were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM and TEM analysis. The mechanism of nucleation and crystal growth for the synthesized ZnO has been studied by changing the reaction parameters such as microwave power, reaction time and temperature. A detailed investigation has also been carried out on the influence of the reaction parameters upon the photovoltaic performance of fabricated ZnO-based dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of all the prepared samples. It was observed that, after 10 min by mixing zinc acetate and fresh ammonia solution a colourless white precipitate was formed. The as-prepared colourless precipitate was further identified using XRD patterns that confirm the orthorhombic lattice structure of wulfingite Zn(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 38-0385) as shown in Fig. 1a. Subsequently, the Zn(OH)2 precipitate in the H2O (high polar solvent) suspension was thermally decomposed under MW-HT reaction conditions by varying the temperature from 50–125 °C with 10 min ramp and 2 min hold at which the microwave power was automatically varied from 150–900 W. The corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1b–e. Additional sets of ZnO samples were prepared by varying the microwave power ranging from 50–300 W at a fixed time of 10 min ramp and 10 min hold and their respective XRD patterns are illustrated in Fig. 1f–i. Significantly, it was observed that the Zn(OH)2 (wulfingite) precipitates were decomposed into crystalline ZnO (zincite) within 4 min at a lower temperature of 50 °C. Furthermore, the crystallinity of ZnO increases with an increase in temperature. While synthesizing in the microwave power mode, a phase-pure ZnO structure was obtained only when the power input was 300 W. XRD patterns of the samples with the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase belong to space group P63mc with lattice constants a = 0.3249 Å and c = 0.5207 Å which is corroborated with standard JCPDS data No. 36-1451.

(j–n) Time-dependent ZnO crystals grown at 2–10 min and an autogenous temperature built during the reaction with a fixed power of 300 W. (o) A comparative plot for variation in FWHM (derived from XRD data) with respect to synthesis temperature (MW-HT) for crystal planes such as (100), (002) and (101). 
No other impurity peaks were detected and thus ZnO obtained via MW-HT has a pure phase. The sharpness and line widths of the diffraction peaks indicated that all ZnO are nanocrystalline in nature.
To explicate the proposed growth process, in-depth time-dependent MW-HT synthesis was performed throughout the ZnO growth processes by fixing the microwave power at 300 W. Fig. 1j–n show the resultant XRD patterns of the samples prepared by varying the reaction time (ramp and hold time of microwave irradiation) from 2 min to 10 min at 300 W (with the autogenous temperature developed inside the reaction vessel of ∼70 °C). It is revealed that with 2 min ramp and 2 min hold, phase pure ZnO crystallized in 300 W power mode at a temperature as low as ∼70 °C. A comparative plot for variation in FWHM (derived from XRD data) with respect to synthesis temperature (MW-ST) for the three crystal planes (100), (002) and (101) is given in Fig. 1o. The calculated FWHM value of the (002) peak is the narrowest compared to other planes of ZnO for all the samples. As the temperature increases, the size of the crystals increases and FWHM value of the 101 peak decreases implying coarsening of crystals with respect to reaction temperature.36 It is also noticeable that the (002) reflection planes of the synthesized products were extremely strong with respect to standard JCPDS data No. 36-1451, revealing the oriented growth of these structures along (001) in the c-axis direction.
The impact of MW-HT reaction conditions (i.e., microwave power, temperature and reaction time) on the morphology of ZnO through different growth stages is also illustrated through a FE-SEM image shown in Fig. 2. The crystal growth stages of ZnO morphologies under different MW-HT synthesis conditions have been observed. Initially, 10 min ramp and 10 min holding time for the microwave reaction in a low power of 50 W gave crystallites with micrometer sized tetragonal morphology seeds as shown in the FE-SEM image of Fig. 2e. When the microwave power was increased from 50 W to 200 W, all the tetragonal shaped seed crystallites began to “blossom” into a well-defined jasmine-flower-like morphology as illustrated in Fig. 2f. Finally at 300 W with an attained maximum temperature of 95 °C, all the micrometer sized tetragonal structures were completely transformed into magnificent jasmine-flower-like structures as revealed from the FE-SEM image of Fig. 2g.

Fig. 2i–k illustrate FE-SEM images of the ZnO growth process at different microwave reaction time modes (i.e., ramp and hold time varied from 2 min to 10 min) with a fixed power of 300 W. When the pre-set ramp and hold time was 2 min, there was no particular morphology formation as shown in Fig. 2i. Significantly, when the ramp time was increased to 10 min with a fixed hold time of 2 min, several thick rod-like structures started to form as shown in Fig. 2j. Subsequently, an increase in the hold time to 10 min caused the transformation of all the rod structures possessing sharp edges, resulting in a flower-like morphology with distinguishable c-axis growth as noticeable from Fig. 2k. The temperature-dependent (ambient to 125 °C) morphology evolution of ZnO for the pre-set time of 2 min ramp and 2 min hold is shown in Fig. 2a–c. At ambient temperature, several crystallites were observed as exhibited in Fig. 2a. As the temperature increased to 50 °C, large crystallites were formed by the aggregation of small crystallites, finally transforming to spectacular flower-like structures made up of perfectly arranged individual sheet-like petals as illustrated in Fig. 2b and c.
Furthermore, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis of ZnO morphological characterization was carried out for samples prepared at 10 min ramp and 10 min hold and a fixed microwave power of 300 W as illustrated in Fig. 3. The obtained HR-TEM image showed the overall jasmine-flower-like appearance with 3–4 μm size, consisting of several rod-like petals having a diameter of 30–40 nm as shown in Fig. 3a and c. The HR-TEM image of the prepared sample (Fig. 3b and d) confirms that ZnO is single crystalline with lattice fringes corresponding to the (002) planes of the ZnO hexagonal phase. The d-spacing value obtained between lattice fringes is 0.25 nm which corresponds to the (002) crystal plane.

3.2 Optical properties
The effect of the synthesis parameters on the optical properties of the prepared samples was analysed using room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the ethanol-dispersed samples, measured at 340 nm and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4a. The PL spectra of the ZnO sample emphatically consist of two bands. The peak obtained in the UV region is due to the band-edge emission which originates from the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers resulting in excitonic emission. Depending on the morphology, these emission peaks are very likely to occur between 370 and 390 nm. The shifting of this peak is also reported due to the changes in the particle size and morphology. Another broad emission peak in the visible region is due to the defects in the crystal structure or the adsorption of excess oxygen on the surface of ZnO. The obtained spectrum indicates different features depending on their morphological variations at respective growth stages. The samples which were prepared by varying the power, time of ramp, hold and temperature exhibited two emission peaks, one in the ultraviolet (UV) region at 385–400 nm (3.35 eV) and another in the broad green-yellow region at 570–585 nm (2.18 eV).6 The defect emission in the visible region is detected due to the nanocrystalline nature of ZnO caused by quenching. The UV peak is attributed to the near band-edge emission (NBE) from the recombination of free excitons through an exciton–exciton collision process.37 The emission peak at 570 nm recognized as deep level emission (DLE) belongs to the impurities and structural defects exhibited by green emission (singly ionized oxygen vacancies) or yellow emission due to interstitial oxygen ions, originating from the radiative recombination of a photon-generated hole with an electron occupying oxygen vacancy.38,39 In lower power and time modes, the PL spectrum of the obtained product exhibits a broad UV-band in the region between 370 and 410 nm and a broad emission peak at around 570 nm (Fig. 4a). As the reaction time or power increases, the broadness of the UV peaks decreases and at 10 min ramp and 10 min hold, a sharp UV emission peak at 386 nm is obtained along with less intense visible emission. The possible reason for the variation of band-edge emission is the presence of various defects in the sample prepared under different MW-HT synthesis conditions.40 The current results clearly show the increase of wurtzite ZnO crystal quality with less surface defects at higher reaction time.
 Fig. 4  (a) Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra and (b–d) Raman spectra of the samples prepared under various MW-HT conditions. 
The ZnO nanoflower sample prepared at 125 °C shows much enhanced, broad UV and defect state luminescence since its synthesis temperature is more compared to other samples.
Raman spectroscopy is considered as a powerful tool to understand the morphology related structural quality of the samples with respect to different molecular vibrations of ZnO. Fig. 4b–d represents the room temperature Raman spectra of ZnO excited using a 514 nm argon laser. Normally, ZnO has a hexagonal wurtzite structure and belongs to the C1(P63mc) space group with a two formula unit primitive cell where all the atoms occupy the C3V sites. The presence of Raman-active modes A1 + 2E2 + E1 for ZnO is predicted by group theory, where A1 and E1 are infrared-active and can be split into transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) components. E2 is the only non-polar Raman-active mode that consists of two additional modes with low and high frequencies.41
In general, the Raman spectra of ZnO consist of a sharp and dominant peak at 439 cm−1 (E2high) which is attributed to the characteristic intrinsic Raman mode of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.41 The high intensity and sharpness of the E2high peak demonstrate the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite phase with good crystallinity. The small vibration peak at 330 cm−1 belongs to the second-order Raman scattering that originates from the multiphonon process (2E2 or E2high − E2low). The peaks at 370 and 570 cm−1 correspond to the polar transverse (A1) and longitudinal (E1) optical phonon modes respectively. In addition the origin of the E1 peak is due to the development of defects such as oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials in the structure.40 Thus, the Raman spectrum is highly sensitive to structural disorder and defects in crystals, the spectra differ for samples prepared under different MW-HT conditions.
From Fig. 4b, under ambient conditions, the spectrum exhibits less intense A1 and E2high peaks, but as the temperature increases to 125 °C, the intensity of E2high peaks also increases, confirming the formation of pure phase ZnO. The lower intensities of A1, E1 and 2E2 peaks compared to the E2high peak demonstrate the higher crystallinity of the sample prepared at 125 °C. When the MW-HT reaction was carried out in a lower power mode of 50 W, characteristic peaks of ZnO were absent. However, when the MW-power is increased to 200 W, A1 and E2high peaks with a similar intensity appeared. Finally at 300 W, highly intense characteristic E2high peaks appeared along with the A1 shoulder peak as shown in Fig. 4c. The change in molecular vibrations with respect to different MW-HT reaction times is displayed in Fig. 4d. Although the XRD pattern of the sample prepared at 2 min ramp and 2 min hold unerringly matches with the standard ZnO JCPDS data, the Raman peaks show the less intense E2high peak at the above mentioned time with more intense defects and oxygen vacancy peaks such as A1, E1 and 2E2. When the ramp time is increased to 10 min, the intensity of all the peaks enhanced with respect to the sample prepared under 2 min ramp and 2 min hold reaction conditions. Finally at a fixed time of 10 min ramp and 10 min hold, the prepared sample showed a sharp high intense E2high peak of characteristic hexagonal phase ZnO.
To investigate the dye-adsorbing capability of the as-synthesized samples, the UV-visible absorption spectra of ethanol solution of the N719 dye desorbed from different photoanodes prepared under various MW-HT conditions are illustrated in Fig. 5. From the spectra obtained, the amount of dye adsorbed on different samples was calculated. The intensity of the residual dye solution shows the maximum value for the ZnO powder prepared at 125 °C (T-125) and at 300 W for 10 min ramp and 10 min hold (T-10-10) and the amount of dye adsorbed was calculated to be 4.79 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 4.76 × 10−7 mol cm−2 respectively. The higher dye-loading capacity of ZnO could be attributed to the hydrophilic surface property of the samples. It is also observed that the sample synthesized both at low power (50 W) and low temperature (50 °C) shows much less dye adsorption that is 3.43 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 3.07 × 10−7 mol cm−2 respectively. Interestingly, as the power increases to 200 W, the dye-adsorption capability also increases to 4.39 × 10−7 mol cm−2. Scattering properties of the synthesized samples were demonstrated using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and are given in Fig. 6. Maximum scattering properties were exhibited by samples prepared at 300 W power for 10 min ramp and 10 min hold and the sample prepared at 125 °C. The DRS spectrum of the sample prepared at a MW-power of 200 W showed lower scattering ability compared to other recorded spectra. Furthermore, the photoanodes with hierarchical ZnO morphology with multi-scattering centres are more desirable for effective utilization of the incident light.41–43 Thus careful analysis of the optical properties of the synthesized samples revealed improved crystal quality with minimum defects for the samples prepared at 300 W for 10 min ramp and 10 min hold time.

3.3 Possible growth mechanism for hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO under various MW-HT conditions
With respect to time, temperature and power-dependent MW-HT reactions, the morphological evolution study of ZnO using XRD, FE-SEM and Raman spectroscopy analysis, the possible hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO crystal growth occurs through a two-stage nucleation and growth mechanism. When ammonia solution is introduced into zinc acetate solution, a sudden precipitation of Zn(OH)2 occurs, which is evident from the XRD pattern obtained for the sample under ambient conditions.44 According to the literature, these hydroxide units undergo immediate dissolution under MW-HT conditions to form a large number of Zn(OH)42− units which act as growth units for ZnO. In addition to Zn(OH)42−, Zn(NH3)42+ growth units are likely to form from the ammonia precursor at high pH.45 Under rapid microwave irradiation, dehydration of both growth units occurs, leading to the formation of small ZnO crystallites, thus initiating the crystal growth.46,47 This ZnO crystal growth initiation can be confirmed by the XRD pattern in Fig. 1b which exactly matches with the standard ZnO JCPDS data. The corresponding FE-SEM images in Fig. 2a and b also support the nucleation and growth process. A burst of the initial homogenous nucleation results in rapid and direct incorporation of all growth units into small ZnO crystallites at an elevated reaction temperature of 125 °C, resulting in several nanostructures oriented along and perpendicular to the c-axis due to the anisotropy of the ZnO crystal structure, which is clear from the FE-SEM image in Fig. 2c.48 Moreover, these oriented structures have high surface energy which makes them thermodynamically unstable. To minimize the surface energy, oriented structures aggregate to form a stable flower-like morphology. The Raman spectra of samples prepared in these temperature ranges indicate the presence of impurities in the sample prepared at 50 °C. The characteristic hexagonal wurtzite ZnO vibrations appear only for samples prepared at higher temperatures (Fig. 4b). Thus it can be summarized that even though ZnO crystal formation occurs at a temperature of 50 °C, the pure phase crystals are obtained upon increasing the temperatures up to 125 °C.
When the MW-HT reactions were carried out in the power mode, the XRD, and Raman spectra indicated suppressed nucleation and growth at lower power. The absence of characteristic peaks in XRD and Raman spectra in Fig. 1f–h and 4c confirms this observation. Interestingly, these impurity peaks in both spectra show gradual suppression as the power increases from 50 to 200 W and they completely vanish in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1i) when the power is increased to 300 W. This is again confirmed by the characteristic molecular vibrations observed in the Raman spectra (Fig. 4c). The corresponding FE-SEM images (Fig. 2e–g) imply the theory of gradual evolution of a flower-like morphology as the power is increased from 50 W to 300 W.
Morphological evolution of ZnO prepared at different microwave irradiation times revealed that even at a lower ramp and hold time of 2 min each the exact crystal structure of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO is formed and is evident from the XRD image (Fig. 1j). Although a pure phase ZnO is formed at lower ramp and hold time, an agglomerated morphology is observed in the FE-SEM image (Fig. 2i) and an impurity dominated vibration peak (2E2) is observed in Raman spectra. When the ramp time is increased to 10 min, rod-like structures are formed that undergo regular arrangement to form jasmine-flower-like ZnO structures (Fig. 2j). During this process, the primary structures formed with many crystalline boundaries and defects undergo surface reconstruction to generate more defined structures with homogenous morphology distribution as a consequence of more time taken for c-axis growth. This growth pattern is evident from XRD (Fig. 1n) and FE-SEM (Fig. 2k) images and is further supported by the Raman spectrum.
3.4 Photovoltaic performance study
Morphology-dependent photovoltaic performance of hierarchical ZnO based DSSCs has been investigated. The obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are illustrated in Fig. 2d, h and i. Initially when the sample synthesized using MW-HT at 10 min ramp and 10 min hold time at a low power of 50 W was used as the photoanode, 0.49% PCE was obtained. When the microwave power was increased to 300 W, a well-defined jasmine-flower-like morphology was obtained with better dye-loading capacity due to the nanocrystalline nature as evident from UV spectroscopy, XRD and Raman spectra and the corresponding PCE was increased from 0.49 to 2.46%. Conversely, when the microwave reaction time is varied (i.e., ramp and hold time varied from 2 to 10 min) at a fixed power of 300 W, a similar trend was observed i.e. an increment in PCE occurred from 0.69% to 2.58%. However, a further increase in microwave reaction time (i.e., >20 min ramp and hold time) inevitably caused a decrease in PCE. The study of temperature-dependent (ambient to 125 °C) PCE of the synthesized sample revealed that as the temperature increases, the corresponding increase in PCE was achieved at a maximum of 1.96% due to well-defined morphological features as supported by XRD and Raman spectroscopic data. Hence, it can be concluded that a higher PCE of 2.58% was achieved by the ZnO flower sample prepared at 10 min ramp and 10 min hold time at a power of 300 W and a reaction temperature of nearly 92 °C (autogenously developed inside the reaction vessel) via the promising MW-HT power mode experimental method. The pre-treatment of FTO using TiCl4 and dye-loading time optimization steps for the photoanode material often improve the PCE.
In this study, when the ZnO-anode was kept for 30 min for dye-loading, the obtained PCE was 3.79% with a much enhanced Jsc of 12.02 mA cm−2 compared to a PCE of 2.58% of the sample without pre-treated FTO. When the dye-loading time was decreased to 20 minutes, Jsc decreased to 11.1 mA cm−2 due to less adsorption of dye molecules on the ZnO surface in the limited dye-loading time. Interestingly, the PCE increased to 4.12% which was attributed to the absence of dye molecule aggregation on the ZnO surface, thus helping to reduce the electron recombination. A further decrease in the dye-loading time from 20 min to 15 min decreased Jsc to 7.17 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.91% was obtained. Furthermore, lower PCE was observed even when the dye-loading time was higher than 30 min and lesser than 20 min. Thus the optimum dye-loading time for the prepared ZnO sample is calculated to be 20 min. The detailed photovoltaic parameters obtained and the J–V curves of the samples synthesized via the MW-HT method are given in Table 1 and in Fig. 7. Besides, the PCE of the DSSCs fabricated using commercially available ZnO was 1.08% which is found to be much lower compared to the values obtained for energy efficient MW-HT prepared samples, that is evident from the J–V curve in Fig. 7. The detailed photovoltaic parameters calculated for five sets of DSSC devices made using identical photoanode materials are summarized in Tables S1–S9 (ESI†).

 Fig. 7  A comparative plot of J–V curves measured under one sun illumination of ZnO-based solar cells fabricated with and without TiCl4 treatment and at different dye-loading times. The inset image shows the photograph of fabricated DSSCs. 
From the photovoltaic performance studies, it is observed that the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs could be greatly influenced by the morphology of the ZnO sample and the morphological features can be tuned subsequently by MW-HT synthesis conditions such as microwave power, time and temperature. The device architecture, TiCl4 pre-treatment of FTO and the dye-loading time are found to be crucial for PCE of the ZnO-based DSSCs. To our knowledge, although many reviews and articles are reported on ZnO based DSSCs, the systematic studies on dependence of MW-HT reaction conditions on power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs were not systematically investigated. In this regard, the present work is significant that we were able to synthesize hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO by the energy efficient microwave assisted hydrothermal method without using any surfactant or structure-directing agents. Furthermore, the efficiency of the DSSCs when using the as-prepared ZnO was superior when compared to commercially available and various solution-processed ZnO morphologies.
4. Conclusions
In summary, well-defined jasmine-flower-like hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were successfully synthesized by a facile and energy-efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal route. The crystal growth mechanism of ZnO was systematically investigated with respect to time, temperature and power-dependent microwave reaction conditions and it was concluded that microwave reaction parameters directly influence the crystallinity and optical properties of ZnO structures. In addition, pre-treatment of FTO with TiCl4 and varying the dye-loading time improve the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs by reducing the dye aggregation and electron recombination in the photoanodes. The hierarchical jasmine-flower-like ZnO prepared with a 10 min ramp and 10 min hold time at 300 W showed a maximum efficiency of 4.12% with a FF of 65.85%. The improved efficiency is due to the assembly of secondary microstructures of hierarchical nanocrystalline flower-like ZnO by many interleaving nanorods which significantly improve light absorption through scattering effects and dye adsorption through the extended surface area. The present study is intended to suggest that this facile, rapid and cost-effective MW-HT process is easy to scale-up for the production of other oxides and sulphides with controlled morphologies for clean solar energy conversion devices.
