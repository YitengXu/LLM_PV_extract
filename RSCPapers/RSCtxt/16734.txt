    , Accepted 25th September 2014First published on 26th September 2014AbstractLayered zinc hydroxide nanocones intercalated with DS− have been synthesized for the first time via a convenient synthetic approach, using homogeneous precipitation in the presence of urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). SDS plays a significant role in controlling the morphologies of as-synthesized samples. Conical samples intercalated with various anions were transformed through an anion-exchange route in ethanol solution, and the original conical structure was perfectly maintained. Additionally, these DS−-inserted nanocones can be transformed into square-like nanoplates in aqueous solution at room temperature, fulfilling the need for different morphology-dependent properties. Corresponding ZnO nanocones and nanoplates have been further obtained through the thermal calcination of NO3−-intercalating zinc hydroxide nanocones/nanoplates. These ZnO nanostructures with different morphologies exhibit promising photocatalytic properties.
Introduction
Layered metal hydroxide salts with the general formula MII(OH)2−xAn−x/n·mH2O (or MII1+x/2(OH)2An−x/n·mH2O), in which OH− deficiency on the host layers is compensated for by coordinated/grafted guest anions (An−), are relatively rare anion-exchangeable hosts, in addition to well-known layered double hydroxides (LDH, MII1−xMIIIx(OH)2An−x/n·mH2O). They have attracted extensive interest because of their rich interlayer chemistry, interacting with both inorganic/organic anions and showing potential for applications in many fields such as drug delivery, catalysis, or as supercapacitors.1–7 In this category, layered zinc hydroxide salts (typical formula: Zn5(OH)8An−2/n·mH2O, A = Cl−, NO3−, etc.) are regarded as one of the most representative structures. The host layers are composed of both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination. Specifically, approximately a quarter of octahedral metal positions are vacant, and a pair of tetrahedral metal atoms, located above and below the missing octahedra, directly coordinate with anions in the interlayer gallery.8–10 The anion exchangeability means they can be used as drug carriers with a controllable release rate, due to their low cytotoxicity in acidic environments.11–16 In addition, layered zinc hydroxide is also widely used as a precursor for the preparation of ZnO, an important semiconductor with a large band gap (3–4.5 eV) and a high exciton binding energy (60–100 meV). ZnO transformed from layered zinc hydroxide via an environment-friendly thermal decomposition route has been thoroughly exploited, owing to its peculiar physical and chemical properties dependent on its size, morphology and orientation.17–20 Moreover, ZnO was also revealed to be a promising photocatalyst with high photosensitivity and a nontoxic nature, which might contribute to solving environmental problems due to its strong oxidizing power and solar energy conversion capabilities.21–23 Layered zinc hydroxides, through a cost-efficient procedure, can also be used to synthesize mesoporous ZnO nanomaterials with superhigh specific surface area, on an industrial scale. Nevertheless, layered zinc hydroxide salts are known for their instability in aqueous solutions even at room temperature. In fact, there are very few studies dedicated to the morphological control of layered zinc hydroxide salts with various interlayer anions or the resulting ZnO obtained through calcination.17,24–26
On the other hand, cylindrical nanotubes and conical nanocones formed by the rolling-up of layered lamellae or nanosheets, exhibiting high aspect ratios and hollow interiors, have been highly popular materials over the past decade due to their fascinating morphology-dependent properties and applications such as in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices, solar cells, and for environmental protection, etc.27–31 Nevertheless, apart from carbon and boron nitride, and cobalt or nickel hydroxide systems reported very recently, there are seldom successes in synthesizing large quantities of nanocones from other layered structures.32–35
In the current work, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy capable of producing unique zinc hydroxide nanocones in large quantities. Similarly to our previous reports on cobalt or nickel hydroxide systems,33–35 layered zinc hydroxide nanocones could be synthesized by utilizing urea as a slowly-releasing alkaline source, together with anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12H25OSO3Na, SDS), via an oil-bath synthetic procedure. It was found that SDS not only directly determined the interlayer spacing through intercalation, but also affected the morphology of the as-prepared layered zinc hydroxide products. DS−-intercalated nanocones undergo an exchange reaction with different anions (Cl−, NO3−, CH3COO−) in ethanol. However, the nanocone morphology would not be maintained if the same exchange reaction was carried out in aqueous solution at room temperature, instead transforming into square-like nanoplate morphology. This aspect reveals a unique feature of zinc hydroxide for facile morphology manipulation and thus provides a novel transformation protocol under mild conditions, e.g. at room temperature. Furthermore, ZnO nanocones and nanoplates could be obtained via the calcination of corresponding layered zinc hydroxide precursors intercalated with nitrate anions. Under the irradiation of UV light, ZnO nanocones and nanoplates were revealed to exhibit remarkable photocatalytic properties for decomposing organic dyes.
Materials and methods
Materials
All reagents used were of analytical grade and were purchased from the Wako Chemical Reagents Company, Japan. Milli-Q water was utilized throughout the experiments.
Synthesis

Synthesis of layered zinc hydroxide nanocones. 
In a typical synthetic procedure, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, urea and SDS were dissolved in a 1000 cm3 two-neck flask with Milli-Q water under nitrogen gas, yielding concentrations of 5 mM, 10 mM and 25 mM, respectively. Then, the mixed solution was heated at refluxing temperature for 5.5 h under continuous magnetic stirring. The final product was recovered by washing with Milli-Q water and ethanol several times and was air-dried at room temperature.


Anion-exchange reaction. 
As-synthesized layered zinc hydroxide nanocones with DS− were dispersed into 100 cm3 of ethanol containing 25 mmol NaNO3, NaCl and CH3COONa, respectively. The vessels were tightly capped and mechanically shaken for several hours at room temperature. The products were filtered and air-dried at room temperature.


Transformation of zinc hydroxide nanocones to nanoplates. 
The layered zinc hydroxide nanocones were dispersed into 200 cm3 of 1 M NaCl aqueous solution without any agitation for 24 h at room temperature. The samples were collected by filtering, washing, and air-dried at room temperature.


Synthesis of ZnO nanocones and nanoplates. 
The as-prepared layered zinc hydroxide nanocones and nanoplates in NO3− form were calcined at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 in air to 200 °C and 800 °C.


Evaluation of photocatalytic performance. 
100 mg of ZnO nanocones or nanoplates were dispersed in 50 ml aqueous methylene blue (MB) with a concentration of 15 mg L−1. The adsorption of MB on the surface of the photocatalysts was facilitated under magnetic stirring in the dark for 1 h. A 500 W Xe lamp (XEF-501S San-ei Electric) was used for UV irradiation of the samples. Samples were placed ∼10 cm from the light source, corresponding to a UV intensity of approximately 1 mW cm−2 at λ < 300 nm, as determined with a spectroradiometer (USR-30 Ushio Electric). The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the aqueous solution of MB was recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis spectrophotometer.

Characterization
Phase identification of the as-prepared samples was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD, with a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer operated at 40 kV/40 mA with Cu-Kα radiation).
The morphology and dimensions of the as-prepared products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6010LA). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained on a JEM-3000F transmission electron microscope.
Metal contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (SPS1700HVR, Seiko Instruments) after dissolving a weighed amount of the sample in an aqueous HCl solution.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out using a Thermo Plus 2 TG8120 instrument in a temperature range of room temperature-1000 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 under air flow.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show typical SEM images, at different magnifications, of the as-prepared zinc hydroxide nanocones obtained through the oil-bath precipitation of zinc nitrate (5 mM) in the presence of urea (10 mM) and SDS (25 mM). It can be seen that a large quantity of uniform conical objects were synthesized. The length of the as-obtained zinc hydroxide nanocones is several micrometers, whereas the average tip and bottom diameters are approximately 0.2 μm and 2 μm, respectively. The hollow interior structure is confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Fig. 1c. A difference in contrast is discernable between the dark periphery and greyish intermediate portion. The wall thicknesses of these nanocones are several hundreds of nanometres. A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of an individual nanocone is given in the top-left inset of Fig. 1c, which can be readily indexed to the in-plane or [001] zone-axis diffraction of hexagonal zinc hydroxide with a lattice constant of a = 0.32 nm. The diffraction rings with d-spacings of 0.27 nm and 0.16 nm correspond to [100] and [110], respectively, indicating that the rolling-up of the hydroxide layers lacks crystallographic interlayer registry. The layered stacking with an interlayer spacing of approximately 3.2 nm is visualized by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image given in the bottom-right inset of Fig. 1c.

The insets in (c) show an SAED pattern and a HRTEM image taken of an individual nanocone. (d) XRD pattern of the as-synthesized zinc hydroxide nanocones intercalated with DS− anions (inset) magnified profile in the region of 30–35° and 55–65°. 
A typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared nanocones intercalated with DS− anions is displayed in Fig. 1d. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed in a hexagonal cell of a = 0.3150 (2) nm, c = 3.1532 (8) nm, consistent with the layered zinc hydroxides reported in the literature.36–38 Sharp (00 l) basal reflections at the low angular range of the XRD pattern reveal the high crystallinity of the sample along the layer stacking direction (c axis). The in-plane diffraction peaks around 33° and 59° in the magnified XRD pattern in the top-right inset of Fig. 1d indicate that layered zinc hydroxide was synthesized by this convenient route. The basal spacing close to 3.2 nm indicates that the DS− anions are likely to arrange in bilayers, similar to previous reports.1,39 The basal spacing (dL) for DS− bilayers in the hydroxide gallery may be expressed as: dL = (0.73 + 2 × 0.15 + 2 × 0.197) + 2 × 0.127 × 12 sinθ, where the thickness of the host layer is taken as 0.73 nm, and the carbon chain length of dodecyl sulphate is around 0.127n nm (n = 12), with a sulphate head of 0.197 nm and an end tail of 0.15 nm.1,40 As a result, the tilting angle of the bistratal DS− chains can be estimated as approximately 35°. According to the results of wet chemical analyses as well as thermogravimetric analysis shown in Fig. S1,† the chemical composition of the as-prepared nanocones was estimated as Zn(OH)1.55DS0.45·0.3H2O (Anal. calcd: Zn, 30.2%; S, 6.7%; ignition loss, 62.4%. Found: Zn, 28.9%; S, 6.31%; ignition loss, 61.8%). The data indicate that the nanocones are layered zinc hydroxide salts with a composition very close to the theoretical formula of Zn5(OH)8DS2·2H2O.
The amount or concentration of SDS surfactant has a great influence on the morphology and phase of the as-prepared products. Without using a surfactant, the products evolved into ZnO nanorods. Fig. 2a depicts a typical SEM image of uniform nanorods with a length of approximate 5 μm. The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2d(i) reveals a hexagonal ZnO structure with lattice constants of a = 0.3259 (1) nm and c = 0.5224 (4) nm. When 12.5 mmol of SDS was used, the majority of the product appeared as hexagonal nanoplates, although a small fraction of nanocones was also observed (Fig. 2b). Upon increasing the amount of SDS to 25 mM, high-purity nanocones were synthesized (Fig. 1a). When the amount was further increased to 50 mM, nanocones were still obtained as the main product, as presented in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2d compares the XRD patterns of the as-obtained samples under different SDS concentrations, which indicates the formation of layered zinc hydroxide salts with similar interlayer spacing under varied amounts of SDS. We speculate that SDS works as both a surfactant and a structure-directing agent for the formation of peculiar nanocones of layered zinc hydroxides, the same as earlier reports on Co–(Ni) hydroxides.34 A relatively low energy barrier with a tubular structure is responsible for the rolling-up of a thin sheet/layer along a conical angle into a nanocone under the template role of SDS.41

Fig. 3a–c shows SEM images of layered zinc hydroxide nanocones exchanged with NO3−, Cl− and CH3COO− using ethanol as the solvent at room temperature. Fig. 3d displays the XRD patterns of zinc hydroxide nanocones intercalated with Cl−, NO3− and CH3COO− anions. The interlayer spacing shifted to 0.90 nm for NO3−, 1.14 nm for Cl− and 1.44 nm for CH3COO−, from the original 3.15 nm for DS− anions. Compared with the previous report on layered Co–(Ni) hydroxide nanocones intercalated with NO3− (0.79 nm), Cl− (0.78 nm) and CH3COO− (0.91 nm), the interlayer spacing of the current zinc hydroxide nanocones is noticeably larger. The reason for this is not yet clear. We speculate that exchange in different solvents, e.g., in ethanol or in water, might contribute to different anion arrangements and consequently interlayer spacings. In fact, the interlayer spacing was reduced to 0.79 nm for the exchange with Cl− if the anion-exchange process was carried out using 1 M NaCl in ethanol–water binary solvents (1:1 v/v) (Fig. S2†). However, the nanocone morphology could not be well retained when water was added to the solvents. It was found that the nanocones deteriorated into irregular nanoplates in the deionized water (Fig. S3a†). In Fig. 4a and b, the conical structure was gradually transformed into monodisperse square-like nanoplates in aqueous 1 M NaCl solution. The lateral length of the square-like plates is approximately 4–5 μm, while the very thin and uniform thickness is estimated to be a few tens of nm. The same morphological change was also observed in aqueous 1 M NaNO3 solution (Fig. S3b†). The SAED pattern collected on an individual nanoplate shown in the inset of Fig. 4c confirmed the single-crystal nature with hexagonally arranged diffraction spots. The slight deviation from an ideal hexagonal symmetry, e.g., into an orthorhombic one, which might be attributed to an occupancy fluctuation or position shift of the Zn2+ in the hydroxide layer, is considered to be responsible for the formation of rectangular platelets. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4d show that the interlayer spacing was reduced to 2.5 nm from original 3.2 nm, revealing a partial de-intercalation of DS− and the possible transformation from a bilayer to a monolayer arrangement in the gallery. The lower DS content was supported by a smaller weight loss in TG analysis (Fig. S4a†). In other words, the anion-exchange process was not fully facilitated in aqueous solutions for zinc hydroxide nanocones, which is significantly different from the previous reports on Co–(Ni) hydroxide nanocones.33–35 Such a unique feature of Zn-based hydroxide nanostructures may be effectively used to apply facile morphological and structural modifications at room temperature.

The layered zinc hydroxide nanocones could be transformed into ZnO nanocones via a simple calcination treatment. In particular, inorganic anion (e.g., NO3−) intercalated hydroxide nanocones show lower pyrolysis temperatures and release less gas content during calcination, as confirmed by the TG analysis shown in Fig. S4b.† They are more suitable for thermal transformation into ZnO nanocones. To preserve the original nanocone structure well, a slow heating rate was also found to be favourable. Fig. 5 shows the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of ZnO nanocones obtained by calcination at different temperatures. The average diameter of the ZnO nanocones is smaller than the starting hydroxide nanocones owing to dehydration and removal of anionic species in the galleries through pyrolysis. The hollow interior nature of the nanocones was identified by TEM characterization, as shown in Fig. 5b and c. In general, the oxide nanocones are polycrystalline, being composed of many tiny particles. The interstices between them may be formed due to the release of foamed water and gas contents. With the increase in calcination temperature to 800 °C, the polycrystalline nanoparticle assembly into a conical framework is obvious (Fig. 5c). The XRD patterns of calcined nanocones obtained at different temperatures given in Fig. 5d can both be indexed to be hexagonal ZnO with almost the same lattice constants (a = 0.32466 (4) nm and c = 0.5197 (4) nm for 200 °C, a = 0.32517 (7) and c = 0.5205 (2) nm for 800 °C).

The photocatalytic performances of the ZnO nanocones and nanoplates were evaluated by examining the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) as a representative pollutant under irradiation by ultraviolet (UV) light. The time-dependences of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the aqueous solutions of MB with 100 mg of ZnO nanocones or nanoplates are compared in Fig. 6. As can be seen from Fig. 6a and b, well-defined absorption peaks of MB positioned at 610 nm and 660 nm rapidly decreased with prolonged time duration. MB was almost completely degraded in an hour, verified by both UV-Vis absorption spectra and photographs shown in the insets of Fig. 6a and b. Compared with a blank experiment without a photocatalyst, the remarkable efficiency of photodegradation within one hour using ZnO nanocones and nanoplates is evident (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO nanocones appears higher than that of the ZnO nanoplates. As the band structures of these ZnO nanomaterials should not differ too much, the reason might be derived from their morphological differences, e.g., specific surface area, exposed crystal facets, etc. It seems that ZnO nanocones exhibit a higher specific surface area than that of nanoplates due to a porous assembly of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is known that the efficiency of photocatalysis is significantly affected by the specific exposed crystal facets. It has been reported that the (002) polar face of ZnO possesses higher activity than that of (100). Consequently, the catalytic activity of hexagonal ZnO would be enhanced with more exposed (002) facets. Based on the XRD patterns for ZnO nanocones in Fig. 5d(ii) and ZnO nanoplates in Fig. S5,† the peak intensity ratios were tabulated in Table S1.† It can be seen that the peak intensity ratio of (100) to (002) is higher in ZnO nanocones than in ZnO nanoplates. In other words, the nanoplates hold a preferred growth tendency oriented along the c axis, which may diminish the proportion of (002) polar faces, namely the exposed (002) facets.42 The above factors might be among the reasons for ZnO nanocones to show a higher photocatalytic activity than that of ZnO nanoplates. This indicates the high potential of altering morphological characteristics for functional optimization, as well as employing ZnO with this unique nanocone structure in photochemical and optoelectronic applications.

Conclusions
In summary, layered zinc hydroxide nanocones intercalated with DS− anions have been synthesized via a convenient and reliable synthetic approach, using homogeneous precipitation in the presence of urea and SDS, in which SDS imparts a significant influence on the synthesis as both a surfactant and a structure-directing agent. These nanocones could be transformed into square-like nanoplates in aqueous solution even at room temperature. Corresponding ZnO nanocones and nanoplates were synthesized through further calcination, which provide convenient and effective routes to design peculiar conical and plate-like functional oxides under mild conditions. The fine control of the morphological features, e.g., nanocone vs. nanoplate, may be employed to tune their properties, e.g., photocatalytic performance. The conical structure with a hollow interior, as well as its nanoplate counterpart, is promising for various applications such as photocatalysis, optoelectronics, biomedicine, etc.
