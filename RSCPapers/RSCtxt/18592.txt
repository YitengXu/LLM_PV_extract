    , Accepted 19th January 2017First published on 19th January 2017AbstractPolymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, i.e. a blend of a p-type conjugated polymer with an n-type semiconductor acceptor, have made rapid progress over the past decade. In comparison with inorganic semiconductor solar cells, PSCs have the advantages of low cost, light weight, solution processability and good mechanical flexibility. In the last few years, various classes of electron-donating polymers have been reported for PSCs. Among them, quinoxaline (Qx) and its derivatives have been widely used as building blocks for optoelectronic applications because they can be easily modified by varying the side chains, such as alkyl chains, conjugated aromatic rings, functional groups, etc. Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11% was achieved for PSCs with Qx-based polymers. This PCE is among the best for PSCs, and it suggests that Qx-based polymers have great potential for highly efficient PSCs. In this article, we review the recent advances in the design and synthesis of such Qx-based conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications. Particular attention is paid to the chemical structures of the polymers including flexible chains, conjugated side chains, functional groups, Qx derivatives and the effect of the molecular structure on device performance parameters. We believe that further development of Qx-based polymers will lead to a PCE >12% in the near future.

1. Introduction
The past several years have witnessed tremendous progress in polymer solar cells (PSCs), owing to numerous advantages compared to other technologies employing inorganic-based solar cells.1–3 Indeed, they have attracted considerable academic and industrial interest due to their simple device structure, light weight, flexibility and low fabrication cost using a simple ambient-condition solution or the roll-to-roll process.4–7 The typical photoactive layer of solution-processable PSCs is composed of a p-type semiconductor (i.e., an electron donor, such as conjugated polymers) and an n-type semiconductor (i.e., an electron acceptor, such as fullerene derivatives).8–12 For the electron acceptor component, the most common and successful n-type semiconductor materials are [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).13–15 The power conversion efficiency (PCE), a key parameter to assess the performance of solar cells (PCE = open-circuit voltage (Voc) × short-circuit current density (Jsc) × fill factor (FF)/input solar power (Pin)),16,17 has increased rapidly from below 1% to over 12% under standard AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination in the last decade.18–49
The most classical photovoltaic device, using soluble poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor, can reach a PCE of nearly 5%.4,50 The absorption edge of the P3HT film is at ca. 650 nm and the visible absorption of PCBM is too weak. The offset energy between P3HT and PCBM is larger than 1 eV, much higher than the offset energy of 0.3–0.5 eV that should be enough as the driving force for exciton dissociation. This large offset energy causes a relatively important voltage loss and thus leads to a lower Voc value (ca. 0.6 V) for the PSCs.51
In this regard, numerous new donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials have been reported towards high performance PSCs. For instance, Jsc over 20 mA cm−2,52–54Voc over 1.2 V55,56 and FF over 75%57–59 have been demonstrated in PSCs. However, due to the interplay of the polymer properties such as absorption and energy levels, the highest Jsc and highest Voc values usually cannot be obtained simultaneously.17,60 In order to achieve the highest PCE, Voc and Jsc should be balanced through rational design of the conjugated polymer materials. Four key elements for designing ideal conjugated polymer donor materials are as follows: (a) broad and strong absorption spectra in the visible and near-infrared region; (b) suitable HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels to ensure a large Voc value, a small energy offset for exciton dissociation and polymer air-stability;15 (c) high and balanced mobilities to enhance the charge transport efficiency to increase the FF and Jsc values; (d) high molecular weight and good solubility in common organic solvents.
On the basis of these requirements, the donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure has been proven to be an effective way to construct ideal high efficiency copolymers. Hundreds of different polymer backbones have been reported so far.3,7,18 Among them, low bandgap polymers containing benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene structural units in the backbone (PBDTTT) and polymers with 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and quarterthiophene building blocks (PffBT4T) were well recognized and frequently reported in the form of various derivatives.42,44 Some efficient strategies were applied to further improve the device parameters such as fused heterocyclic or heteroatom substitution on acceptor units or π-bridges, tuning the structural properties with different side chains, introduction of conjugated side chains, incorporation of functional groups, etc. Besides photovoltaic performance, material cost and a large area device fabrication process should also be considered.61,62 However, some high-performance donor polymers require complicated synthetic procedures.63 Each monomer often requires numerous synthetic steps, which will increase the cost of production.61,62
In the past few years, we realized that quinoxaline (Qx) is a unique building block to construct different optoelectronic polymers as a result of the flat and rigid conjugated structure, so its derivatives have been interesting and widely employed in many fields of applications, for instance in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), in dyes or as ligands in luminescent materials or for metal complication in catalysis.64 In addition, quinoxaline derivatives exhibit broad biological activity including anti-HIV, anti-tuberculosis, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, etc. Moreover, the synthesis and application of quinoxaline derivatives are one of the important research directions.65 Indeed, the Qx building block can be easily modified by attaching various side chains, such as alkyl chains, aromatic rings, functional groups, etc. The synthetic route of Qx is shown in Scheme 1. The Qx unit was obtained from the Schiff base condensation between the aromatic amine and 1,2-diketone. The aromatic amine compound could be prepared through reduction reaction by dinitrobenzene or functionalization of benzothiadiazole, and 1,2-diketone could be easily synthesized by nucleophilic reaction. For example, for compound 5 from route v, the aromatic hydrocarbons were first treated with magnesium in tetrahydrofuran under argon to form the Grignard reagent; then, the reagent was transferred to another flask containing lithium bromide and cuprous bromide dispersed in THF under argon; subsequently, oxalyl chloride was added dropwise into the above reaction mixture, which was separated and purified by silica gel chromatography. The yield of compound 5 was approximately 40%. The resulting conjugated photovoltaic materials were obtained by using Stille coupling or Suzuki coupling, which were the two most popular polymerization reactions.
 Scheme 1  Common synthetic procedures for the Qx monomers: (i) Mg, THF; (ii) oxalyl chloride; (iii) ether; (iv) n-butyllithium, THF; (v) Mg, LiBr–CuBr, oxalyl chloride, THF; (vi) KCN; (vii) DMSO, HBr; (viii) Br2, HBr; (ix) glyoxal, butanol; (x) NaBH4, ethanol; (xi) glyoxal, ethanol, NEt; (xii) acetic acid; and (xiii) Pd-catalyst. 
It is well known that the bandgap decreases linearly as a function of increasing quinoid character of the backbone.66 As shown in Fig. 1, poly(isothianaphthene)s have very small bandgaps, in which the quinoidal character in the aromatic conjugated backbone plays an important role in reducing the bandgap. When carbon atoms on the benzene ring were substituted by nitrogen atoms, the bandgap can be further reduced. Pyrazine has large aromatic resonance energy, which tends to favorably adopt the quinoid form through π-electron delocalization.67 So, the “six-member ring” of pyrazine will stabilize the quinoid structure. At the same time, increasing the quinoidization population in the conjugated polymer will accompany an increase of the backbone planarization which induces strong π–π interactions in the film state. By combining Qx with various donor units from fluorene,68 indacenodithiophene (IDT),69,70 thiophene,71,72 benzodithiophene (BDT),73,74 dithienosilole (DTS)75 and benzothiadiazole (BT),76etc., many kinds of Qx-based D–A copolymers have been developed.

Thus far, several reviews77,78 have partially summarized the development of some Qx-based conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications. The target of this review will focus on recent advances on the design and synthesis of Qx-based conjugated photovoltaic polymers including backbone modulation, manipulation of alkyl chains, introduction of conjugated side chains and incorporation of functional groups. Moreover, we also present Qx-based polymers emerging in fullerene-free PSCs. Hopefully this review will assist readers to better understand the molecular design and structure–property relationship towards developing high performance photovoltaic materials.
2. The strategies for designing quinoxaline derivatives for polymer solar cells
As mentioned before, to obtain high performance PSC donor materials, several aspects must be considered together: broad and strong absorption, suitable and stable energy levels, high mobility and good solubility.79,80 Qx is a typical electron-poor building block for optoelectronic applications. The advantage of Qx is that it can be alkylated to improve the solubility of conjugated polymers without introducing significant steric hindrance. Moreover, conjugated side chains can be introduced to the periphery of Qx which can provide additional control to adjust the energy level, absorption and morphology, resulting in good PCE.81 In addition, backbone modulation or incorporation of functional groups on the conjugated backbone can also improve the active layer's charge mobility, morphology and molecular packing behavior, resulting in a significant increase in the Jsc and FF values.
2.1 Flexible side chains
Flexible chains are the most widely used by the introduction of solubilizing groups in conjugated materials, and the most popular flexible side-chains are the alkyl or alkoxy group. Two key factors may contribute to dissolution of conjugated photovoltaic materials after introducing flexible chains: first, the van der Waals interactions between side-chains and solvent can increase total interaction energy between polymers and solvents. In addition, the molecular arrangements in the solid state can be modified through vibrational motions of flexible chains.82 Generally, linear substituents enhance the degree of crystallinity while the branched chains induce disorder, leading to better solubility when compared to the linear ones. Moreover, the shape and length of the side chains also can influence the absorption spectrum, electron mobility and electronic energy levels of conjugated polymers such as introducing of C–C double or triple bonds on the side chains of conjugated polymers.83–87
Having said that, one of the first copolymers made from fluorene and Qx units (P1, see Fig. 2) was synthesized by Chen's group in 2007.88,89 The PSCs based on the device with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P1:PC61BM (1:4, w/w)/Ca/Al exhibited a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 1.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 27% which gave a PCE of 0.39% (Table 1). Then, poly[N-9-(heptadecan-9-yl)carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-5,8-di(thien-2′-yl)quinoxaline-5′,5′-di-yl] (P2) was synthesized through a Suzuki coupling reaction by Leclerc's group.90 They found that these symmetric copolymers are soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The internal charge transfer (ICT) from an electron-rich unit (carbazole) to an electron-poor moiety (Qx) has been extensively used to obtain low bandgap (LBG) conjugated polymers. The device based on P2:PC61BM (1:4, w/w) showed a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 3.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 56% and a PCE of 1.8%. P2 possesses a higher ionization potential (IP) of 5.46 eV and a higher electron affinity (EA) of 3.42 eV (i.e. lower HOMO and LUMO levels, respectively) when compared with those of P1 (IP = 5.03 eV and EA = 3.23 eV). This fact correlates well with the higher PCE and Voc value obtained for P2-based devices. In addition, higher IP values increase polymer air-stability. Marder et al.91 reported P3 using 3,4,5-tris(dodecyloxy)phenyl-substituted dithieno-[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2,6-diyl (DTP) unit copolymerized with 5,8-dibromo-2,3-didecylquinoxaline. The device with P3:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) as the active layer exhibited a low PCE of 0.57% due to a poor Jsc value of 2.2 mA cm−2, arising from rather low EQEs, a low Voc of 0.439 V owing to the relatively low ionization potential (IP = 5.1 eV) and a FF of 44%. A random Qx-containing polyfluorene (P4) with 30% 5,8-dithienyquinoxaline was reported by Cao and coworkers.78,92 With Ba as the cathode interlayer, the optimal D/A weight ratio of P4:PC61BM was found to be 1:3. It exhibits a PCE of 0.74% with Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 2.02 mA cm−2 and FF = 45.6%. After Ba was substituted by a poly(9,9-bis-[3′-(N,N-dimethyl-N-ethylammonium)propyl]fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene) dibromide (PFPNBr)93 film, the PCE of P4 reached 1.18%.

Cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) based materials have been reported by Turner's group.94 They found that CPDT based materials displayed a wide range of interesting physical properties including high electrical conductivities, low bandgaps and extended π-conjugation. Later, a number of CPDT based alternating copolymers were reported. Moulé et al.95 have described a low bandgap copolymer (P5) with CPDT and bis(ethylhexyl)quinoxaline units. Unfortunately, a moderate Voc of 0.64 V was obtained when combining P5 and PC61BM (1:3, w/w), leading to a PCE of only 0.74%. Janssen and co-workers96 performed several studies on copolymers based on a CPDT unit and five different electron-deficient aromatic units synthesized via Suzuki coupling. The frontier orbital levels of the copolymers were designed to get high Voc values. The device with P6:PC61BM (1:3, w/w) resulted in a PCE over 1% with a Jsc of 5.2 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.61 V and FF of 39%. Ginger and co-workers97 describe BHJ solar cells containing blends of colloidal PbS nanocrystal quantum dots with poly(2,3-didecylquinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-4-octyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2,6-diyl) (P7). They found that the device made from a P7 and PbS blend exhibited external quantum efficiencies (EQE) two orders of magnitude greater than devices made of PbS and conventional polymer (such as P3HT) blends. The device with the P7 and PbS blend exhibited a Voc of 0.38 V, a Jsc of 4.2 mA cm−2, a FF of 34% and a PCE of 0.55%. The coplanarity of the backbone improved the hole mobility of the conjugated polymers. Benzene is a planar compound and its electronic optoelectronic properties can be easily modified through side chains or the conjugated backbone. Introduction of long dialkoxy side chains onto the benzene ring not only makes these materials more soluble but also increases the electron donating ability. Synthesis and characterization of a 1,4-dialkoxybenzene–Qx conjugated copolymer (P8) have been therefore reported by Chen's group.98P8 showed an optical band gap of 1.91 eV, IP = 4.76 eV and EA = 2.56 eV, and its hole field-effect mobility reached 2.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (measured by the organic field-effect transistor method). Under white light illumination of 100 mW cm−2, the device based on P8:PC61BM (1:4, w/w) as the active layer showed a Jsc of 1.55 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.49 V, a FF of 49% and a PCE of 0.40%. In order to modulate the electronic properties, replacing the alkyl group with an alkylthio group was demonstrated to be a useful synthetic strategy. The van der Waals radius of sulfur (∼0.18 nm) is less than that of –CH3 (∼0.2 nm) which slightly reduces steric hindrance compared with alkylthio substituents.99,100 Replacing the alkyl chain with an alkylthio group can also increase the electron donating ability, which could give rise to a larger electron donating effect through a π-resonance contribution from the sulfur atoms.101 Hence, introducing the alkylthio groups to the side chains can exhibit unique optoelectronic properties such as broader absorption spectra and lower HOMO energy level.102–104 Inspired by this strategy, the incorporation of alkylthio side chains onto Qx monomers (see copolymer P9) was reported by Yang's group.105 The HOMO level of P9 down-shifted to −5.29 eV. Using the conventional device structure, the P9:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) device displayed a PCE of 1.37% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 3.35 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50.7%. In order to achieve better charge transport characteristics, it is necessary to increase the interchain π–π interactions of polymers. Moon et al.106 reported a rigid donor unit (quinacridone derivatives) copolymerized with a highly soluble acceptor unit (Qx derivative) to obtain P10. This polymer had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability. According to X-ray diffraction measurements, P10 formed an ordered lamellar structure and displayed conventional edge-on π-stacking. The Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of P10 at a blend weight ratio of 1:3 with PC71BM was 0.81 V, 2.8 mA cm−2, 33.7% and 0.7%, respectively.
2.2 Introduction of conjugated side chains
In 2011, Moon's group107 attached for the first time conjugated side groups (alkoxylphenyl moieties) to Qx to give polymers P11 and P12 (Fig. 3). Absorption measurements revealed that P11 and P12 exhibited broader absorption bands than those of P2 in the range of 450–550 nm. Moreover, P11 and P12 exhibited higher charge carrier mobilities (measured by the thin film transistor method) that are three and two orders of magnitude greater than that of P2 (measured by the OFET method), respectively. In comparison with P2, PSCs based on P11:PC71BM and P12:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) have higher Jsc values of 9.96 and 6.24 mA cm−2, Voc values of 0.82 and 0.81 V, and FF values of 49 and 46%, and thus the PCEs of the P11 and P12 devices reached 4.0% and 2.3% (Table 2). Generally, the introduction of conjugated side chains on the Qx units had a significant effect on not only the absorption spectra but also the charge carrier mobilities, energy levels and microstructures of the active layers.

Andersson and coworkers108 synthesized three conjugated polymers based on a D–A–D structure; the fluorene-based polymers were named APFO-15, 17 and 18 (P13, P14 and P15), with meta-positioned octyloxy, butoxy and no substitution on the peripheral phenyl rings of the monomers, respectively. The optical absorption spectra and molecular energy levels remained almost the same. However, the morphologies and hole mobilities demonstrated a large difference, resulting in obviously different device performances when using PC71BM. The devices using P14 (with short butoxy groups):PC71BM (1:4, w/w) and P15 (no substituents):PC71BM (1:4, w/w) showed a higher PCE of 2.9% (with a FF of 57%, Voc values of 0.99 and 0.97 V, and Jsc values of 5.21 and 5.25 mA cm−2, respectively) than the P13:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) device with a PCE of 2.51%, a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 4.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56%. Meanwhile, higher photovoltaic performances of P13 and P15 have been reported by Inganäs' group68 and Kitazawa' group.109 Devices based on P13:PC61BM (1:3, w/w) and P15:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) gave PCE values as high as 3.7% (with a Voc of 1 V, a Jsc of 6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63%) and 5.5% (with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 9.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.4%), respectively. The polymer P13 reported by Inganäs' group68 possessed a higher molecular weight than that reported by Andersson and coworkers.108 In addition to the fluorene-based copolymers P13–P15, Andersson and coworkers108 also synthesized three phenylene-based polymers (P16, P17 and P18) with octyloxy, butoxy and no substitution, respectively. The phenylene-based copolymers P16, P17, and P18 exhibited lower IP values (5.2–5.3 eV) than those of P13–P15 (5.56–5.59 eV). Compared to the fluorene unit, dialkoxy-phenylene is a more electron rich building block and thereby enhances the D–A character in the polymer backbone, which has a more pronounced ICT and exhibits more broad absorption spectra. However, PSCs based on these polymers with both PC61BM and PC71BM exhibited lower PCEs. P16:PC71BM and P17:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) showed PCE values of 2.47% (with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 4.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 66%), and 2.82% (with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 6.54 mA cm−2, a FF of 60%), respectively, whereas the P18:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) device revealed a PCE of 1.01%, a Voc of 0.51 V, a Jsc of 3.84 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50%. Chen et al.110 also reported phenylene- and fluorene-based copolymers: poly[2,5-didecyloxy-1,4-phenylene]-alt-2,3-bis-[4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thien-2′-yl)quinoxaline-5′,5′-diyl] (P19) with a bandgap of 1.77 eV and poly[9,9-dioctyl fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-2,3-bis[4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thien-2′-yl)quinoxaline-5′,5′-diyl] (P20). When combined with PC61BM, the PCE of the P19:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) based devices reached a value of 0.79% with a lower Voc of 0.67 eV, a Jsc of 3.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 39%, which is a lower value when compared with the PCE of the fluorene-based P20:PC61BM devices (1:1, w/w): a PCE of 1.16%, a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 4.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 36%; and (1:4, w/w): a PCE of 1.75%, a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 6.05 mA cm−2, and a FF of 37%. These examples indicate that PSCs with fluorene-based copolymers showed better performance when compared with corresponding PSCs using phenylene-based copolymers.
Andersson and coworkers111 designed and synthesized a series of D–π–A conjugated polymers consisting of alkoxylphenyl-modified Qx and alkyl-modified carbazole with various side chains (linear chain for P21, branched chains for P22 and P23). With variations of the side chains from a linear chain to branched chains, the HOMO levels of the polymers changed from −5.56 to −5.69 and −5.73 eV, respectively. The devices based on P21, P22 and P23 blended with PC71BM at a 1:3 weight blend ratio gave PCE values of 2.2%, 3.1% and 3.7%, respectively. Devices containing P23 with branched side chains on the carbazole units exhibited higher PCE and Voc values than devices containing P21 with straight side chains. Although P22 and P23 had higher Voc values of 0.8–0.9 V, most of them had large bandgaps above 1.9 eV, which may limit their Jsc. Thus, two new isomeric acceptor units, thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline with meta and para-positioned alkoxy groups on the peripheral phenyl rings copolymerized with carbazole units with branched side chains (PCTTQx-m (P24) and PCTTQx-p (P25)) have been developed by Wang's group.112 Compared to the alkoxyphenyl-substituted Qx-based polymers P22 and P23, the fused planar aromatic ring structures not only decrease their bandgap (∼1.8 eV), but also maintain relatively deep HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV). The PCE based on P24:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) reached a value of 4.40% and was further improved to 5.31% after THF vapor annealing, which was higher than that obtained with P25 (4.43%). Incorporation of π-conjugated fused thiophene rings on the donor unit of a conjugated polymer is another method to improve the performance of photoactive semiconductor materials. Hsu and coworkers113,114 have reported that fused thiophene rings can make the molecular backbone more rigid and coplanar, thereby enhancing effective π-conjugation, extending absorption, lowering the bandgap and facilitating charge transport. Lee's group115 designed a new conjugated polymer PTNDTT-QX (P26) from an alkoxyphenyl-substituted Qx and naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene derivative unit (NDTT). P26 showed a bandgap of 1.77 eV and a HOMO level of −5.24 eV. The device based on P26:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) showed a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 4.52 mA cm−2, a FF of 46% and a PCE of 1.44%. In 2004, a new class of indolocarbazole semiconducting materials was designed by Leclerc et al.116 Because of their relatively low-lying HOMO, thermal stability and high charge carrier mobility (0.2 and 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1) (measured by the OFET method), indolocarbazole units became a popular donor building block to be applied in PSCs. Meanwhile, the reactive groups at the 2,8- or 3,9-linkages of indolocarbazole also allow flexibility for exploring new polymer structures. Then, Chen and coworkers81 developed conjugated polymers based on 2,8- or 3,9-linkages of indolocarbazole and the alkoxyphenyl Qx unit (P27 and P28, respectively). The 2,8-linkage indolocarbazole-based polymer (P27) showed a lower bandgap (2.31 eV) than P28 (2.34 eV), a deeper HOMO level (−5.12 eV) and a higher charge carrier mobility (1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (measured by the FET method). Thus, a higher PCE of 0.87% based on P27:PC61BM (1:4, w/w) has been obtained than the PCE of 0.32% from P28:PC61BM (1:4, w/w). Further enhancement of the PCE of the P27 based device to 1.40% was achieved when PC71BM was used to replace PC61BM in the blend. The significantly higher Jsc of 4.46 mA cm−2 is likely attributed to the considerably higher absorption of PC71BM in the visible region. In order to extend conjugation, Hsu and coworkers117 have designed and synthesized a ladder-type heptacyclic carbazole-dicyclopentathiophene (CDCT-C8) unit in which two outer thiophene subunits are covalently attached to the central 2,7-carbazole core. They got P29 from the CDCT-C8 building block and Qx units. The PCE of P29:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) reached 1.8% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 5.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 40%. An alternating copolymer PECz-DTQx (P30) derived from a 2,6-dihydro-1H-benzo[def] carbazole and a 5,8-dithienylquinoxaline was prepared by Wu et al.118 The 2,6-dihydro-1H-benzo[def]carbazole is a new member of the carbazole family, in which the 4,5-ethylene linkage enlarges the skeleton of carbazole. Moreover, the 4,5-ethylene group has the possibility of being converted into a double bond, from which a novel carbazole with enhanced aromaticity and larger conjugation extent might be afforded. P30 showed a lower HOMO level of −5.15 eV and a broader absorption spectrum with a bandgap of 1.7 eV. With P30:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) as the active layer and Ca/Al bilayer cathode, the PCE was recorded to be 4.52% (Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 9.84 mA cm−2 and FF = 57.4%). When Ca was substituted by a poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl] (PFN) film, the PCE of P30 was improved to 6.07% vs. 4.52% due to obvious increase of the Jsc and FF values (Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 11.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 65.8%).
The pentacyclic indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit was first reported by Wong and coworkers in 2006.119 The extended conjugation and coplanarity make IDT a good building block for D–A copolymers. Meanwhile, IDT-based polymers show high and stable field-effect hole mobilities.120 IDT-based alternating copolymer P31 using phenyl substituted Qx as the acceptor was synthesized by Jen et al. (Fig. 4).121P31 exhibits an optical Eg of 1.81 eV and devices using P31:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) as the active layer delivered a PCE of 5.69% (Voc = 0.87 V, Jsc = 10.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 60%). However, two separated phenyl rings on the 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline could induce some steric hindrance to interrupt intermolecular stacking between the polymer chains. Therefore, they later reported a copolymer P32 made from peripheral tetrahexylbenzyl side chains of the IDT unit and phenanthrenequinoxaline unit. Compared to the nonfused 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, the fused phenanthrenequinoxaline acceptor further increases the coplanarity and facilitates the intermolecular packing. P32 showed a low Eg of 1.67 eV. Due to the increased planarity of the phenanthrenequninoxaline unit, P32 showed a higher hole-mobility than P31. Under the same conditions, the P32:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) based device obtained an increased PCE of 6.24% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64%. Notably, by using a C60 bis-adduct surfactant to modify the energy level alignment at the organic/cathode interface in a conventional BHJ device, the P32:PC71BM (1:3) device also exhibited a high PCE of 6.22% (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 11.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 61%).122 Wang et al.72 reported an easily synthesized D–A photovoltaic polymer, namely poly[2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P33), with a high number average molecular weight (Mn) of 41 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.6. P33 showed promising photophysical properties with a broad absorption spectrum and an optical bandgap of 1.70 eV, meanwhile the HOMO and LUMO levels were located in suitable positions matching with those of PCBMs while keeping a high Voc of about 0.9 V. By optimizing the D/A ratio, the device of P33:PC71BM at a 1:3 blend ratio exhibited a PCE of up to 6.0% (Voc = 0.89 V, Jsc = 10.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 64%). Notably, by addition of 5% (v/v) of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) to modify the morphology of the active layer, the P33:PC71BM (1:2) blend device exhibited a higher PCE of 7.08%.123 Li's group124 first designed and synthesized a novel two-dimensional D–A conjugated copolymer (P34) consisting of electron-rich alkoxyl phenyl side chains and thiophene main chains as an electron-donor group. Because π-electrons are delocalized throughout all conjugated moieties, this polymer P34 possesses a narrow bandgap of 1.59 eV and broader absorption spectrum from 300–778 nm. However, a low PCE of 0.46% (Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 1.88 mA cm−2 and FF = 31%) has been obtained for the P34:PC61BM (1:1) device. Hou and coworkers125 synthesized two alkoxy-substituted Qx-based copolymers (P35 and P36) to explore the effects of changing the position of alkoxy substituents on the peripheral phenyl rings. P36:PC71BM (1:3) with meta-positioned alkoxy on benzene displayed a PCE of 3.97% (Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 9.87 mA cm−2 and FF = 55.1%), while P35 with the para-positioned alkoxy showed a PCE of only 2.93% (Voc = 0.60 V, Jsc = 8.22 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.4%). The results showed that the alkoxy group on the meta-position of the phenyl ring had lower HOMO and LUMO levels resulting in a higher Voc of 0.73 V, while the para-positioned alkoxy based polymer P35 displayed higher HOMO and LUMO levels, therefore a lower Voc of 0.60 V.

In parallel, Wei et al.126 designed and synthesized a new polymer (P37) based on thiophene and thienyl-quinoxaline by replacing the phenyl groups with thiophene rings (see Fig. 5). P37 showed a low bandgap of 1.62 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of −5.06 eV. The device based on the P37:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blend exhibited a PCE of 1.03% (Voc = 0.66 V, Jsc = 3.24 mA cm−2 and FF = 48%). Through solvent annealing for ∼12 h, the PCE of P37:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) reached a value of 1.41% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 3.89 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55%. Compared to D–A copolymers based on phenyl-substituted Qx, the copolymers based on thiophene-substituted Qx showed extended absorption.127 Moreover, when the two thiophene rings are connected by a single bond between the ortho positions, it significantly increases the planarity of Qx and shows a more pronounced red-shifted absorption spectrum. Thus, a series of D–A copolymers PFTTQx (P38) and PFTTPz (P39) have been synthesized by Cao's group.128P39 with a fused structure exhibited a higher hole mobility of 5.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than its analog counterpart P38 (obtained by the space charge limited current method). However, the device of P39:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) exhibited a lower PCE of 2.1% (Voc = 0.85 V, Jsc = 4.7 mA cm−2 and FF = 51%) compared to the P38:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) device with a PCE of 4.4% (Voc = 0.9 V, Jsc = 7.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 59%) due to the poor solubility of P39.
In recent years, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has become one of the most promising electron donor units for photovoltaic applications due to its easy synthesis, relatively easy modification and planar conjugated structures which could be beneficial to electron delocalization. Therefore, Hou and co-workers129 reported two new D–A alternating copolymers (P40 and P41) based on a Qx derivative (DTQx) and alkoxy or alkylthiophene-substituted BDT units. They found that by introducing a two-dimensional conjugated structure by replacing alkoxy groups with alkylthienyl groups, higher hole mobility and higher EQE values of the PSC device were achieved, and therefore a higher Jsc can be realized. Under optimal conditions, a PCE of 5.0% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 10.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.3% was obtained for the P41:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) based device, which is ∼45% higher than that of the device based on P40:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) (PCE = 3.06%, Voc = 0.71 V, Jsc = 7 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.5%). Zhu's group130 designed and synthesized a low bandgap alternating conjugated polymer containing 4,8-disubstituted benzodithiophene-co-2,3-bis(4-methoxylphenyl)-6,7-dioctyloxy-5,8-di(thien-2′-yl-quinoxaline, named PBDTDT(Qx-2)-T (P42). Compared to P41, this copolymer was appended with methoxy groups at the 4-position of the phenyl and octyloxy groups at the 6,7-positions in the Qx unit. Because long branched side chains can weaken intermolecular interactions, introducing short side chains can promote intermolecular interactions, rendering an enhanced Jsc value. A PCE of up to 6.31% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 10.82 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.4% was obtained. Later on, this group131 reported a new copolymer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T (P43) to investigate the influence of side chains of Qx on the photovoltaic performance. P43 exhibited a broad absorption of 300–696 nm, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV and a carrier mobility of 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (measured by the SCLC method). Based on the P43:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) blend, the device exhibited a PCE of 6.9% with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.7%. According to the previous report, Hwang et al.132 found that most of the polymers consisting of BDT and Qx are amorphous or weakly crystalline. Thus, they synthesized two D–A copolymers, PBDT-TATQx and PBDT-TTDTQx (P44 and P45) to investigate the effects of replacing 5-octylthiophene with 5-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the side chains. Because thieno[3,2-b]thiophene has a rigid planar structure with extended conjugation, P45 possesses a lower bandgap at 1.74 eV and a HOMO energy level of −5.40 eV. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using P44 and P45 blended with PC71BM. The devices fabricated from P44:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and P45:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) exhibited PCE values of 2.26% and 3.42%, respectively. Bulky triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) groups on acene derivatives not only improve the solubility and oxidative stability of the semiconductors but also promote the π-orbital overlap. As a result, TIPS-functionalized acenes gained importance as a class of highly soluble, air-stable, high-performance p-type organic semiconductors.133 Hwang and co-workers134 synthesized a TIPS-substituted BDT (TIPSBDT) unit as the electron-donating unit and a Qx derivative as the acceptor, namely PTIPSBDT-DTQX (P46). P46 showed a medium bandgap of 1.81 eV and a deep HOMO energy level at −5.48 eV. The device based on P46:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) showed a PCE of 1.55%, a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 4.74 mA cm−2 and a FF of 42%.

2.3 Incorporation of fluorinated groups
Additionally, introducing fluorine atoms to the backbone or the side chains is commonly used as a fine-tuning method to adjust the physical properties of conjugated polymers, particularly the optical and electronic properties. For example, Kose et al.135 reported two new conjugated polymers (P47 and P48, see Fig. 6) with fluorinated or non-fluorinated Qx units as the acceptor units to investigate the effects of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties. Compared to the non-fluorinated polymer P47, P48 exhibited better thermal and oxidative stability. Fluorine atoms also help the formation of solid state ordering, which involves intra-/inter molecular interactions via C–F⋯H, F⋯S and C–F⋯πF interactions. A narrower absorption spectrum and a lower HOMO level of −5.32 eV can be observed in P48, while the Eg and HOMO level of P47 were 1.81 eV and −5.08 eV, respectively (Table 3).

Jin's group136 synthesized a fluorinated Qx acceptor unit copolymerized with a carbazole unit, namely PCDTQxF (P49). The solid film of P49 showed an optical bandgap of 2.14 eV and a HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV. The device of P49:PC71BM (1:1) showed a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 2.41 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.37, giving a PCE of 0.7%. The devices based on P49:PC71BM exhibited low PCEs due to their poor solubility. In 2012, Chou and co-workers74 synthesized a high performance copolymer P50 based on BDT and Qx, among which the fluorine atom was introduced on the alkoxyl phenyl substituted Qx backbone. P50 had deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels with high charge carrier mobility. Due to the excellent continuous percolation pathways within the polymer/PCBM blend, P50:PC71BM (1:1) showed a PCE of up to 8.0% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.1%. This work achieved a milestone on high efficiency Qx based photovoltaic polymers. Wang's group137 synthesized a series of copolymers from two-dimensional BDT and fluorinated Qx (FQx) with different conjugated side chains (P51, P52, P53 and P54) to investigate the effects of conjugated side chain modulation on photovoltaic properties. They found that the thiophene side group has weaker steric hindrance and smaller dihedral angle than benzene attaching to the backbone. Different the electron-donating abilities and aromaticity between thiophene and benzene greatly affect the electronic properties such as energy levels, bandgap and mobility. Under optimal conditions, P51:PC71BM (1:2, w/w), P52:PC71BM (1:1, w/w), P53:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) and P54:PC71BM (1:1.2, w/w) gave PCE values of 3.96, 6.08, 6.54 and 7.68%, respectively. Hou's group138 reported a series of D–π–A conjugated polymers consisting of alkylthiophene-substituted BDT (BDTT) and Qx derivatives with different amounts of fluorine atoms on the backbone and side chains, PBQ-1 (P55), PBQ-2 (P56), PBQ-3 (P57) and PBQ-4 (P58). The results demonstrated that introduction of a fluorine atom on the backbone and side chains of BDTT and Qx units has little influence on Jsc and FF but is beneficial to reducing the HOMO level, which is helpful to increase Voc. The Voc values of four copolymer devices with PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) were 0.63 V (P55), 0.75 V (P56), 0.79 V (P57) and 0.90 V (P58), respectively, and the PCE values were 5.63% (P55), 6.25% (P56), 7.39% (P57) and 8.55% (P58), respectively. Yang and co-workers139 synthesized two structurally identical fluorinated analogues of P59 (single F) and P60 (double F) by adding F atoms onto the existing Qx acceptor unit within the polymer backbone. The results indicate that an increased number of F atoms of the polymer backbone lowered the HOMO levels more than the LUMO levels, which led to a higher Voc. Thus, the PCE of the PSCs based on P59:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) reached 4.41% (with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51%) without any processing additives, and P60:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) with 2% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) showed 2.71% (with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 6.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48%). Based on P59, Huang et al.71 found that fluorination lowered the HOMO level from −5.36 eV of the non-fluorinated counterpart to −5.51 eV and the relative dielectric constant increases from 4.2 of the non-fluorinated counterpart to 5.5. The device based on the P59:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blend showed a high PCE of 5.27% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 10.11 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.9% after a very short thermal annealing process. Zou's group140 designed and synthesized a new copolymer (PBDTT-ffQx) (P61) based on the BDT derivative as the donor unit and tetrafluoroquinoxaline as a new acceptor unit. They found that introduction of fluorine atoms into the periphery of the Qx unit has significant effects on the HOMO level, morphology and molecular packing behavior, which is beneficial to the Voc and FF. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated from P61:PC71BM blends, using zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) as the electron transporting layers (ETLs), and a superior PCE of up to 8.6% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 14.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70% was obtained after 3% DIO treatment. Zhu and co-workers141 reported a D–π–A type polymer of PBDTT-DTFPQx (P62) composed of a BDTT moiety and a 4-fluorophenyl substituted Qx unit (FPQx) with thiophene as the π-bridge. This polymer exhibited a low bandgap of 1.66 eV, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.52 eV and a hole mobility of 5.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (obtained by the SCLC method). As a result, a high PCE of 7.2% was obtained from the P62:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) blend with an outstanding FF of 73%. Lin et al.142 were interested in extending the structure of the Qx unit, and a new electron acceptor (AM2) based on the Qx unit by adding additional phenyl rings bearing heterocyclic rings and fluorine atoms has been reported. P63 was synthesized from AM2 and BDT with a low optical bandgap of 1.65 eV. The photovoltaic device using a P63 and PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 5.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 40%, leading to a PCE of 1.6%. Using a conformational lock (intra/interchain non-covalent coulombic interactions such as hydrogen bonding), Woo and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of difluoroquinoxaline-thiophene based polymers.143 As shown for P64, four linear octyloxy substituents were incorporated into the meta- and para-phenyl positions of the 2,3-diphenyl-Qx unit to endow solution processability, and the 6,7-position on the Qx unit can be modified by introducing F atoms for modulating the electronic structures via C–F⋯H and F⋯S non-covalent coulombic attraction. The optimized photovoltaic devices based on P64:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) achieved a high PCE of 8% (with a Voc of 0.741 V, a Jsc of 17.19 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63%) with an active layer thickness of ∼270 nm using a conventional device. Yang et al.144 reported a relatively well-defined polymer (P65) with a low content of structural defects containing a fluorinated IDT unit and Qx unit. P65 was synthesized by direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) of two starting β-unprotected thiophene-containing monomers (fluorinated IDT and Qx) with appropriate heating mode. Compared to the traditional polymerization method such as Stille cross-coupling, the device based on P65 prepared by the DHAP method with PC71BM (1:3, w/w) exhibited an improved PCE of up to 5.1% compared to 4.7% for the polymer obtained from Stille polymerization. Two D–A polymers P66 and P67 were polymerized by Stille coupling reactions of the fused Qx acceptor unit (PhenQ) with IDT or selenium-substituted IDT (IDSe) donor building blocks.145 The P66:PC71BM device showed a high PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 11.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65%, which was higher than that for P67:PC71BM (3.93%). Kang and co-workers146 designed and synthesized a new conjugated polymer (PQSS) (P68) with alkylselenophene and a substituted Qx backbone. Because of the presence of alkyl side chains on the selenophene rings, P68 showed good solubility in common organic solvents with a low bandgap of 1.50 eV. The photovoltaic device using the P68:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend film as an active layer exhibited a Voc of 0.40 V, a Jsc of 4.50 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.58 and a PCE of 1.07%. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) was first synthesized by Hou and co-workers.147 BDF has a similar structure compared with the BDT unit, although the oxygen atom has a smaller diameter and higher electronegativity than a sulfur atom. BDF-based copolymers may form a good planar and stacking structure when combined with a suitable acceptor moiety, and then better absorbance and higher mobility are expected.148 An alternating polymer P69 based on two-dimensional conjugated BDF and fluorinated Qx was synthesized by An and co-workers.149P69 showed a narrow bandgap of 1.68 eV and a low-lying HOMO level of −5.30 eV. The performance of PSCs based on the P69:PC71BM (1:1) blend as the photoactive layer exhibited a PCE value of 4.44% with a Jsc value of 8.74 mA cm−2. Wang et al.150 reported a new alternating D–A1–D–A2 copolymer (P70) containing two electron-deficient moieties, isoindigo and fluorinated Qx. They found that fluorine substitution on the weaker Qx acceptor unit is a useful strategy to adjust the energy levels of D–A1–D–A2 copolymers. Thus, a high PCE value of 6.32% was obtained from the P70:PC61BM blend at a weight ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 6).
2.4 Multifused substitution on quinoxaline units and quinoxaline derivative structures
Multifused substitution on Qx units is another important category of conjugated quinoxaline derivative frameworks. These types of Qx structures are made of linearly fused aromatic or heteroatoms connected via sharing endocyclic carbon–carbon double bonds. The rigidified coplanar structures can suppress the rotational disorder of the interannular single bonds of the polymer, which can increase the charge carrier mobility. Moreover, the bandgap can be reduced by elongating the effective conjugation length and facilitating π-electron delocalization.114,151,152
Imine groups (CN) are popular electron-withdrawing segments and can be found in different acceptor-type building blocks, such as benzotriazole, benzothiadiazole, etc. Incorporating solubilizing alkyl chains onto the benzotriazole unit can promote close packing of the polymer chain and improve the photoelectric properties. Zhou and co-workers153 reported P71 (Fig. 7) from a strong electron-withdrawing triazole[4,5-g]-quinoxaline (TQ) (four imine groups in the TQ unit) copolymerizing with a BDT unit to investigate their absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. P71 exhibited a narrow optical bandgap of 1.61 eV and the device of P71:PC61BM (1:0.8, w/w) with ZnO as the cathode buffer layer showed a PCE of 2.2% (Table 4). The introduction of a conjugated alkoxyphenyl group onto the TQ unit lowered the HOMO energy levels of P72 as reported by Tang et al.154 However, an unsatisfactory PCE of 1.4% based on P72:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) was obtained. By using PFN/Ca as a co-interfacial layer, the optimized device reached an improved PCE of 2.24%. Wang's group155 synthesized a new electron accepting building block 5,9-di(thiophen-2-yl)-6H-pyrrolo-[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione (PQD) by substituting the 6,7-positions of Qx with a dicarboxylic imide moiety. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing properties of the two functionalizing groups (Qx and dicarboxylic imide), the intramolecular charge transfer could be enhanced. As a consequence, P73 obtained from the copolymerization of a PQD unit with a BDT unit showed in devices with PC71BM (1:3, w/w) a PCE of 4.9% with a very high Voc of ∼1.0 V. You's group60 proposed a design strategy of a “weak donor-strong acceptor” copolymer to obtain ideal polymers. Thus, stimulated by this strategy, P74 obtained from dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (QDT) copolymerized with 4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) has been reported to maintain a low HOMO level and a low bandgap, which is beneficial for a high Voc and Jsc. Indeed, P74 exhibited a narrow optical band gap of 1.70 eV and a HOMO energy level of −5.46 eV. The device of P74:PC61BM (1:1.2) showed a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 11.38 mA cm−2 and a FF of 45.6%, giving a PCE of 4.3%. Andersson et al.156 reported the synthesis of a polymer (Eg: ∼1.0 eV) (P75) with response in the NIR region. P75 consists of dialkoxyphenylene and thiadiazoloquinoxaline; light absorption and a photovoltaic response up to 1200 nm were demonstrated. The device based on the P75:PCBM (1:4, w/w) blend showed a low PCE of 0.38%, a Voc of 0.34 V, a Jsc of 3.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 34%. However, the bandgap of 1.0 eV was unique for PSCs with photovoltaic responses at long wavelengths. Another new copolymer (P76) based on BDT and bis(2-thienyl)-2,3-diphenylbenzo[g]quinoxaline has been synthesized via a Stille reaction by Hsu et al.157P76 exhibited a large planar conjugated structure and a good hole mobility of 4.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (obtained by the SCLC method). The PSCs based on P76:PC61BM (1:4, w/w) showed a PCE value of 0.53%. Keshtov et al.158 have reported a new low bandgap D–A1–D–A2 conjugated copolymer (P77) containing two electron-deficient moieties, benzothiadiazole (BT) and thiadiazolequinoxline (TDQ). They found that TDQ-based conjugated polymers possess high charge carrier mobility and exhibit strong absorption in the 300–1100 nm wavelength range due to a rigid structure and the presence of the four imino groups of TDQ. After the optimization of weight ratios and solvent concentration, the TDQ-based copolymer possesses superior photovoltaic characteristics with a PCE of 5.30%. Cheng and co-workers151,152 designed and synthesized a nitrogen-bridged pentacyclic D–A copolymer (PFDTPQX) (P78) based on fluorene as the donor unit and dithienopyrroloquinoxaline (DTPQX) as the acceptor unit. They found that nitrogen bridges not only planarize the structure through stronger intermolecular π–π interaction but also induce ICT transitions upon photoexcitation, resulting in enhanced light-absorption ability. The device based on P78:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) showed a PCE of 3.4% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 8.62 mA cm−2 and FF = 55%. An alternating copolymer, P3TPQ (P79), was earlier developed as a p-type photoactive material for PSCs by Wang and co-workers.159 The optical Eg of P79 was determined to be 1.1 eV with a HOMO level of −5.64 eV. Unfortunately, P79:P71CBM (1:3, w/w) showed a low PCE of 0.5% with a low Voc of 0.52 V, a Jsc of 1.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 50%. Huang's group160 designed and synthesized a new building block (NQx) formed by fusing two Qx units together. NQx was copolymerized with BDTT to get P80. Compared with the traditional Qx unit, fused Qx (NQx) leads to a down-shifted HOMO level (by 0.04 eV) while maintaining the same bandgap. As a result, the optimized photovoltaic cell based on the P80:PC71BM blend achieved a high Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 43%, delivering a PCE of 3.4%. P81 has been reported by Hou et al.,161 which consisted of BDT and a thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TPZ) unit. They found that the TPZ unit can reduce the bandgap by lowering the LUMO level and elevating the HOMO energy level of the polymer. Because of the quinoid structure of TPZ, P81 exhibited a broad absorption spectrum extending to 1000 nm. However, the device based on the P81:PCBM blend exhibited a very low PCE of 0.11% due to an extremely low Voc of 0.22 V, a low Jsc of 1.41 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35%. Wei's group162 have synthesized a new polymer (P82) by conjugating the electron-accepting pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP) moieties with the electron-rich cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units through a Stille cross-coupling method. Due to the more electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms in the fused ring, the PP-containing polymers have displayed higher electron-accepting abilities relative to those of Qx-containing polymers.163 The PSC device based on P82:P71CBM (1:4, w/w) showed a PCE of 1.82%, a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 6.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 44.1% (Fig. 7).

3. Application of quinoxaline-based polymers as donors in fullerene-free PSCs
Qx-based copolymer donor materials are usually blended with fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM) as the photovoltaic active layers. Fullerene derivatives are clearly the most common and successful acceptor materials owing to their suitable electron affinity, and isotropic electron transporting properties, as well as the formation of appropriate phase separation.2,15,164 Despite the great progress of fullerene-based PSCs, fullerene materials still exhibit some intrinsic drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible-near infrared region, easy crystallization, and limited tunability of their electronic energy levels. Thus, more and more efforts have been devoted to designing and synthesizing non-fullerene acceptors which can address these issues effectively. Over the past several years, many types of non-fullerene acceptor materials using polymers or small-molecule acceptors containing perylenediimide (PDI),165–167 naphthalene diimide (NDI)168–170 and indacenodithiophene (IDT)171–173 units as core structures have been applied in PSCs. Non-fullerene PSC systems possess several potential advantages: (1) broad absorption and high absorption coefficients can be designed to complement the absorption spectra of donor polymers and enhance light harvesting in the active layer and (2) energy levels can be fine-tuned by structural variations. Thus, the PCE of fullerene-free PSCs has been improved to over 12%.174
For example, a cluster type PDI-based n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors (TPB) was developed by Yu's group, which exhibited a PCE of 8.47%.175 However, reports on PSCs based on n-OS acceptors blended with Qx derivatives were still scarce. Thus, the development of new Qx-based polymers with suitable energy levels and broad absorption could provide new opportunities to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs to match well with non-fullerene acceptors. A P33 (Fig. 4)/poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl-alt-2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl] (Fig. 8, N2200) blend was firstly reported by Mori's group.176 Because N2200 has a high electron mobility (∼0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1) and suitable energy levels (similar to PCBM),177 the device performance was optimized at the D:A blend ratio of 7:3 wt%, giving a Jsc of 8.85 mA cm−2, a FF of 55% and a PCE of 4.1% (Table 5). Yang et al.178 compared the photovoltaic performance of Qx based polymers with different numbers of fluorine atoms on the backbone blended with different molecular weight (Mn) of N2200 as the acceptor. They found that both Mn and F variations strongly influence the charge mobility and morphology of the blend films. As a consequence, a PCE of 7.31% can be reached by blending the optimum F content in P59 with a high Mn (63 kDa) of the N2200 acceptor. Kim and co-workers179 varied the film-processing solvents (chloroform, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,4-xylene) to control the morphology in the P64:N2200 blend for optimizing all-polymer solar cells. The results illustrated all-polymer solar cells with the domain size of ∼30 nm in the active layer using chloroform as the processing solvent, which led to a PCE of 5.11% with a high Jsc. An efficient all-polymer tandem cell using P83:N2200 as the sub-cells has been reported by Yuan and co-workers.180 The tandem cell can enhance absorption and increase Voc which can result in a greatly improved device performance. Through optimizing the recombination layer and sub-cell film thickness, the tandem device based on P83:N2200 showed a PCE of 6.70%. Zou's group181,182 firstly reported two types of medium bandgap polymers (P61 and P84) as the p-type semiconductor with a popular non-fullerene molecule ITIC (shown in Fig. 8) as the n-OS acceptor to investigate their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. The results showed that tetrafluoroquinoxaline (ffQx) based polymers can match well with the ITIC acceptor including absorption spectra, electrochemical energy levels and morphologies. With a traditional photovoltaic device, all the PSCs with the ffQx-based polymers as donors showed PCE values over 8% (8.47% for P61 and 9.12% for P84). Very recently, Hou and coworkers183 reported a series of non-fullerene-based PSCs based on the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC and BDT-BDT-Qx derivatives as the donor polymers. They found that despite the ΔHOMO levels of the blend of donor–acceptor being very small, the device based on the donor/acceptor can still yield high EQE values over the whole spectral response range. For instance, the HOMO level of PBQ-4F (P85) is only 0.04 eV higher than that of ITIC but efficient ultrafast charge transfer occurs. The corresponding device exhibits low exciton recombination and thus a high PCE of 11.34% has been obtained, which is the highest value for BDT-Qx fullerene-free PSCs to date.

4. Summary and outlook
In this review, we provided an overview of the Qx based organic semiconducting materials, and their unique building blocks with interesting molecular frameworks and optoelectronic applications. The Qx building block can be easily modified, including manipulation of flexible chains, introduction of conjugated side chains, incorporation of functional groups, multifused substitution on Qx units and Qx derivative structures. Although flexible chains are the most widely used solubilizing groups in conjugated materials, alkylated Qx-based copolymers did not achieve the desired performance due to the widening bandgap, steric hindrance, unmatched HOMO energy level and morphology for polymer solar cells (PSCs). On the other hand, the introduction of conjugated side chains on the Qx units had a positive impact on not only the absorption spectra but also the charge carrier mobilities, energy levels and microstructures of the active layers in PSCs, which resulted in significant improvements in the photovoltaic performances. Furthermore, introduction of electron-withdrawing side chains (such as F atoms) can effectively decrease the HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers so that the Voc can be increased. In addition, multifused substitution on Qx units is another important category of conjugated Qx derivative frameworks, in which the bandgap can be reduced by elongating the effective conjugation length and facilitating π-electron delocalization. The Qx-based copolymer donor materials also show crucial importance in achieving high-efficiency PSCs with non-fullerene acceptors.
Although the PCE values of PSCs based on Qx-polymers have made tremendous progress in the past several years, they still do not achieve the targeted efficiency and satisfying lifetime.184,185 For high-performance PSCs, the following points need to be considered: a strong and broad absorption band in the vis-NIR region for good sunlight harvesting, the matching of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials for high Voc values and efficient charge separation. Besides these, high purity, good solubility for solution-processing and high charge carrier mobility in PSCs are also critically important for high PCE and printable solar cells. However, due to the constraints originating from the absorption spectrum and internal quantum efficiency (IQE), Jsc is approaching its limitation for Qx-based copolymers. Therefore, it is very important for advancement in device physics to better guide the optimization of molecular design strategies to match with fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. We believe that Qx-based polymers have a bright future for tomorrow's photovoltaics.
