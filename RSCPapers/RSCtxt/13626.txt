    , Accepted 7th June 2019First published on 7th June 2019AbstractThe power conversion efficiency of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been boosted to be comparable with that of commercial silicon solar cells. Although the fabrication cost of solution-processing PSCs can be lower than that of silicon solar cells, PSCs are still facing the big challenge of instability in air due to the presence of organic components in the perovskites. To obtain stable PSCs, fully replacing the A-site organic cations with pure inorganic cations is one of the promising methods. To date, many researchers have studied the inorganic PSCs with astonishing breakthroughs, and the PCE of inorganic lead-based PSCs has exceeded 17%. In this review, the recent progress of inorganic PSCs is summarized and discussed for different perovskite compositions. The challenges of inorganic PSCs are revealed, followed by the outlook of this field.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have emerged to be a promising new photovoltaic (PV) technology of low fabrication cost. With the latest record efficiency exceeding 24%, PSCs rival the established silicon and inorganic thin-film PV technologies on the market. However, the hybrid perovskite materials are unstable under humid and thermal conditions due to the existence of hygroscopic and volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), undermining the application of PSCs. Replacing organic cations with inorganic caesium (Cs+) ions is an effective way to improve the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials. Therefore, continuous efforts have been made toward the construction of efficient and stable inorganic PSCs in recent years. On the other hand, both the stability and PV performance of inorganic perovskites depend significantly on their chemical composition. In this review, the recent advances and the remaining challenges in the field of inorganic PSCs are discussed.

1. Introduction
Due to urbanization and the increasing requirement for electronic products, the global electricity consumption increases rapidly. However, the main electric energy source is fossil fuel, which is limited, and the combustion of fossil fuel will exhaust a great deal of carbon dioxide, exacerbating global warming. The sun, one of the fundamental energy sources for Earth, can provide inexhaustible energy for humans. Thus, the use of a solar cell, a device for direct energy conversion from solar energy to electricity, is a convenient and sustainable method to solve the problems of the energy crisis and global warming. To date, the commercial solar cells are mainly silicon (Si) solar cells which exhibit superior stability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 15–18%.1 However, due to the high melting point of silicon, the device fabrication at high temperature becomes very expensive, diminishing the popularity of Si solar cells.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a new type of promising photovoltaic technology, exhibited a fast improvement in efficiency from 3.8% in 2009 to 24.2% in 2019.2–7 Up to now, the most efficient PSCs (PCE > 20%) have been constructed from organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, ABX3, where A is an organic cation such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+) or their mixture, B is Pb2+and X is Br−, I− or mixture of the two. However, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials suffer from poor stability when exposed to heat, oxygen, moisture and even illumination,8–11 caused by the volatile nature of the organic components. For example, the MAPbI3 can easily decompose to PbI2 and MAI, where the MAI can further decompose to CH3NH2 and HI12,13 or even to CH3I and NH3 at a high temperature, depending on various factors like processing conditions or the nature of substrates and contact materials.12,14–17 Different solutions have been proposed to mitigate these problems, such as compositional tuning of the perovskite layer,12,18 cross-linking of the perovskite film19 or the use of the charge transport materials,20 employing carbon electrodes,21,22 using UV filtering to reduce the damage from the light23,24 and sealing the PSCs.25,26 However, the long-term stability of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs is still unable to meet the requirements for their practical applications.
Higher intrinsic stability of the perovskite materials is achieved when the organic cations are replaced with inorganic caesium ions (Cs+). The inorganic perovskites do not decompose easily in the presence of heat and moisture due to the absence of volatile and hygroscopic organic cations. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to fabricate efficient and stable inorganic PSCs in the past few years (Fig. 1a). The initial all-inorganic PSCs were based on tin-based perovskite CsSnI3, showing PCE of 0.88% in 2012 and 2.02% in 2014.27,28 In 2015, Kulbak et al. reported the first CsPbBr3-based PSCs with PCE up to 5.95% and further demonstrated that the inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite can be thermally stable up to 580 °C, while the organic MAPbI3 starts losing mass at about 200 °C.29,30 The CsPbBr3 inorganic PSCs also display negligible degradation in the humid ambient environment for over three months, demonstrating excellent long-term stability.31 In 2016, the first mixed halide CsPbI2Br-based PSC and the first CsPbI3 QDs-based PSC exhibited PCE of nearly 10%32 and 10.77%,33 respectively. Afterwards, different approaches such as deposition, the use of doping/additives, tuning grain size and interface engineering were explored to improve the efficiency and the stability of inorganic PSCs. Until now, CsPbI3 has been the most promising inorganic perovskite in PSCs with PCE higher than 17%.34 On the other hand, some of the important inorganic perovskites that hold the promise for achieving high PCEs are found with poor structural and chemical stabilities under ambient conditions.35 For example, the black α-phase CsPbI3 can easily turn to yellow δ-phase in air, especially in the presence of moisture. Meanwhile, the lead-free CsSnI3 perovskite is known for the facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in air. These stability problems, undermining the attempts to achieve high device performance, should be fully addressed in future studies.

The current certified record efficiency of organic–inorganic hybrid PSC is shown as a reference (red star). 
In view of the rapid development and the unsolved problems of inorganic PSCs, it is important to have a timely review in this field. Herein, we discuss and summarize the progress of lead-based and tin-based inorganic PSCs. First, the general background information about PSCs including the crystal structure of perovskite and architecture of PSCs is presented. Then, the fabrication methods of inorganic perovskite films are summarized to highlight the benefits of different methodologies. Since the PCE and stability of cesium lead-based inorganic PSCs change with the fraction of iodide to bromide in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 perovskites, we divide perovskites into pure halides and mixed halides to discuss their specific performance and development in detail. After that, the inorganic perovskites with different composition are reviewed, including tin-based perovskites and perovskite derivatives. Finally, the challenges of inorganic PSCs and the future approaches regarding further improvement of PCE and stability are discussed.
2. Basics of perovskite solar cells
2.1. Crystal structure of perovskite materials
The general formula of a typical halide perovskite is ABX3, where the A site is a monovalent cation (Cs+, MA+ or FA+), B site is a bivalent cation (Pb2+ or Sn2+) and X site is a halide (I−, Br− or Cl−), and the crystal structure is illustrated in Fig. 2a.36 The geometric stability of the halide perovskite could be assessed by its octahedral factor μ (Rb/Rx) and the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor τ:37 (1)where Ra is the A-site cation radius, Rb is the B-site cation radius and Rx is the X-site anion radius. A geometrically stable black halide perovskite generally requires 0.8 < τ < 1 (Fig. 2b) and 0.44 < μ < 0.90. A symmetric cubic phase perovskite can be formed for τ factor between 0.9 and 1.0 or at high temperatures, while less symmetric tetragonal or orthorhombic phases are preferred for a lower τ factor or at low temperatures. Perovskites with τ factors at the lower or upper limit of the requirement, such as CsPbI3 (τ ∼ 0.8, Fig. 2c) and FAPbI3 (τ ∼ 1, Fig. 2d), could exhibit a yellow phase at room temperature due to lattice distortion.38,39 There are some perovskite derivatives, such as A2BX6, A2B1+B3+X6, AB2X7, A3B2X9, and AB3X10, but most of their PSCs can achieve only low PCE. A2BX6 refers to the standard perovskite structure with B4+ instead of B2+ cations in the B site and the missing half of the octahedral B-site atom, while A2B1+B3+X6 double perovskite refers to the structure with alternate B+ and B3+ in the B site.40

2.2. Architecture of PSCs
A PSC is a multi-layered device composed of a transparent conducting oxide as a front electrode, a light-absorbing perovskite layer, sandwiched between the N-type electron transport layer (ETL) and the P-type hole transport layer (HTL), and a metal back electrode. As shown in Fig. 2e, the PSC can be fabricated in either a regular n–i–p or inverted p–i–n configuration, and the former can be further divided into mesoporous and planar structures while the latter is usually planar.41 Normally, the ETL contains TiO2, SnO2, ZnO or phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), while the HTL contains 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) or NiOx. The selection of ETL and HTL is based on the workability of the energy-band alignment of the structure and the processing solvents.
2.3. Working principle of PSCs
Solar cells can convert solar energy into electric energy. The sun, as the energy source, is a blackbody with a light spectrum at the temperature of about 5800 K. The solar spectrum on earth's surface varies with the light path length through the atmosphere and AM 1.5 spectrum with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are defined as the standard conditions for the terrestrial characterization of solar cells (Fig. 2f), corresponding to a 1.5 times longer path length of the sunlight than that when the sun is directly overhead.42,43
For the semiconductor-based photovoltaics, photons with enough energy can excite the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band across the bandgap, followed by carrier extraction of both electrons and holes due to the built-in electric fields or diffusion (Fig. 2g). A semiconductor with a low bandgap can absorb more light and generate higher current, but it also affects the output voltage which is limited by the difference of quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes.43,44 On the contrary, a high bandgap will limit the light absorption and the output current. For single-junction solar cells, the optimal bandgap is between 1.1 and 1.4 eV, which can achieve high efficiency of about 33% maximum.43
2.4. Characterization of PSCs

2.4.1. Power conversion efficiency. 

J–V curve. 
The most important parameter of a solar cell is the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which can be obtained from the current density–voltage (J–V) characterization.45 As illustrated in Fig. 2h, under illumination, when a positive voltage is applied, a negative current flows in the circuit, indicating power generation by the solar cell. The PCE is defined as the ratio of the maximum power output (Pout) to the incident light power (Pin) or determined by the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF): (2) (3)where VMP and JMP are the voltage and the current density at the maximum power.

J–V hysteresis phenomenon. 
The J–V hysteresis describes the mismatch of the J–V curves of the same solar cell, measured under different scan conditions (direction, rate, and range), which is a general phenomenon observed in almost all types of PSCs.46,47 The actual origin of the J–V hysteresis is still unclear at present time, which can be attributed to several possible reasons including (1) slow transient capacitive current (non-steady-state photocurrent) resulting from electrode polarization, (2) charge trapping and de-trapping process at the interface and grain boundaries, (3) ion migration in the perovskite film, and (4) ferroelectric effect of the perovskite film. Besides, phase segregation of the perovskite film is also proposed to be a reason for the J–V hysteresis found in organic PSCs.48,49 Accordingly, several methods have been proposed to eliminate the J–V hysteresis, such as improving the quality of perovskite films, enhancing interfacial charge transfer process, and defect passivation. The detailed description of the J–V hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs was published earlier.46,47 Apparently, the J–V hysteresis is unfavourable for determining the real PCE of a PSC, which should be carefully handled during device fabrication and characterization.


2.4.2. External quantum efficiency. 
Another important parameter for is the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is also named as the incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio in solar cells. EQE is defined as the ratio of the number of output electrons to the number of incident photons at different wavelengths. EQE of a solar cell is determined by many factors, such as the absorption of the active layer, exciton generation efficiency, exciton dissociation efficiency, carrier extraction efficiency and the light reflection of the solar cell. EQE can be used to estimate the JSC using the equation: (4)where e is the charge of electron and Φ(λ) is the spectral photon flux of the incident light.50,51

3. Fabrication methods of inorganic perovskite layers
Herein, the perovskite layers are divided into polycrystalline thin films and quantum-dots (QDs) films according to their morphology. The polycrystalline thin films, which are usually used in PSCs, can be fabricated using a solution-processing or a vacuum-processing technique. The QDs film can be fabricated via a solution-processing technique using the QDs solution. The fabrication of inorganic perovskite films is similar to that of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films. The adoption of different fabrication processes commonly depends on the limitation of the perovskite composition. Precursor engineering, solvent engineering, crystallization engineering, and post-treatment can be utilized to improve the film quality.
3.1. Solution processing technique

3.1.1. One-step solution deposition. 
Stoichiometric amounts of PbX2 (SnX2) and CsX are dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a perovskite precursor solution. Then, the perovskite film can be prepared by directly spin-coating the prepared precursor onto the substrate, followed by an annealing process, as shown in Fig. 3a. For tin-based perovskite, additional SnF2, SnCl2 or SnI2 is normally added to the precursor to reduce tin vacancies and avoid the fast oxidation of tin from Sn2+ to Sn4+. To assist with the easy formation of high-quality perovskite films, anti-solvents, such as chlorobenzene or diethyl ether, may be added to the films during spin coating.52–54 For the annealing temperature, all the cesium lead/tin halides require high temperatures to achieve the cubic (α) phase; especially, CsPbI3 needs a temperature above 300 °C.55,56 However, previous papers reported that these perovskites can still maintain dark metastable states, tetragonal phases, or orthorhombic phases at room temperature inside the N2 glovebox or in ambient air.55,57 For CsPbI2Br and CsPbI3, the annealing temperature for dark films can vary from 100 °C to 360 °C based on the preparation method, which will be discussed in detail later. For CsSn(I1−xBrx)3, the annealing temperature is relatively low (70–160 °C) or even room temperature.58

3.1.2. One-step QDs solution deposition. 
This method is commonly used to prepare CsPbI3 perovskite films because smaller crystal size can stabilize the crystal in the dark phase.33,59,60 The QDs are synthesized by adding the Cs-oleate solution to the mixture of PbX2, 1-octadecene (ODE), oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) under different temperature conditions to obtain QDs with different size. Then, the QDs are precipitated by adding ethyl acetate (EA), centrifuged, and dispersed in a non-polar solvent (e.g., hexane) to obtain the perovskite QDs precursor. For deposition, the QDs precursor is spin-coated onto the substrate without annealing, followed by a ligand-exchange process to improve the film conductivity. The film thickness can be controlled by repeating the above process several times. Notably, using the NH4SCN/EA treatment61 or the lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2)/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) treatment62 with annealing, the QDs films can become polycrystalline films.


3.1.3. Two-step deposition. 
As shown in Fig. 3a, the two-step method involves deposition of the PbX2 layer, followed by a reaction with CsX via dip-coating or spin-coating to form the perovskite film. Finally, the perovskite film is annealed to obtain the desired crystal phase. This method is commonly used to fabricate the CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 films because both PbBr2 and CsBr (CsI) exhibit limited solubility in the same organic solvent.29–31,63–66 Other two-step methods were also performed, such chemical vapour deposition (CVD) to replace I− ions in CsPbI3 by Br− ions.67

3.2. Vacuum processing technique
Vacuum deposition enables the researcher to study the perovskite more deeply by controlling the thickness precisely and producing PSCs with more reproducible PCE (Fig. 3b). Vacuum deposition was adopted at the early stages of inorganic PSC production, especially that of CsPbI3 PSCs, because it is a good method to guarantee the construction of a high-quality perovskite film. The vacuum deposition approaches include co-evaporation,68,69 sequential evaporation,70,71 double-layer evaporation,72 and alternative evaporation of PbI2 and CsI, followed by high-annealing temperature of above 300 °C.73,74 There are also a few methods combining the solution and vacuum processes.75
4. Lead-based inorganic PSCs
Lead-based inorganic perovskites typically provide higher efficiency and stability for PSCs than the lead-free perovskites. On the other hand, cesium is the most common element in the A site of perovskites used in high-efficiency inorganic PSCs. For example, CsPbI3-based PSCs have shown PCE exceeding 17%, while the RbPbI3 PSCs can only achieve PCE of 1.04%.76 In this section, we focus on cesium lead halide (CsPbX3)-based inorganic PSCs with different composition of halides in the X site, i. e., CsPbBr3, CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2. The identity of the halide determines not only the light absorption and the structural stability of the CsPbX3 perovskite films but also the photovoltaic performance of the device (Fig. 4a).

4.1. Pure halide perovskite

4.1.1. CsPbBr3. 
Cesium lead bromide perovskite possesses a direct bandgap of about 2.25–2.37 eV, which varies with different fabrication techniques.29,67,77,78 A CsPbBr3 film can absorb light with a wavelength shorter than 540 nm with a characteristic absorption peak at about 520 nm,31,66,79 which disappears gradually upon replacing Br− ions with I− ions (Fig. 4a).80 Since the emission of CsPbBr3 exhibits green light, it is also appealing to be used in light-emitting diodes and lasers.81–84 Due to the limited light absorption, the ideal photocurrent density of CsPbBr3 PSCs can only reach about 9 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 sunlight. On the other hand, the wide bandgap makes CsPbBr3 an excellent candidate for the semi-transparent solar cell or tandem solar cell construction. Normally, CsPbBr3 exists in a yellow orthorhombic phase (Pbnm or Pnma) at room temperature and transitions to the yellow tetragonal phase (P4/mbm) at 88 °C and yellowish-orange cubic phase (Pmm) at 130 °C, showing a negligible change in film colour.79,85 Notably, this compound is the most stable lead halide perovskite material under the ambient conditions.

CsPbBr3 was the first investigated cesium lead halide perovskite due to its high stability in air (Table 1). In 2015, Kulbak et al. reported the fabrication of CsPbBr3-based PSCs with a mesoporous structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/HTL/Au. PCE of 4.92–5.95% was obtained by using spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, and 4,4′-bis(N-carba-zolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) HTLs.29 The devices without HTL can still achieve a relatively high PCE of 5.47% with negligible J–V hysteresis, indicating high hole conductivity of CsPbBr3. In the same year, the PSCs using PTAA as HTL were further optimized and achieved the PCE of 6.2%, which is comparable with that of MAPbBr3.30 Besides, CsPbBr3 was more stable than MAPbBr3 against thermal stress and high-energy electrons (Fig. 4b).
To further increase the stability and reduce the cost of inorganic PSCs, HTL-free and carbon-based PSCs were studied. Chang et al. optimized the conditions, such as the reaction time and temperature for PbBr2 and CsBr, in the two-step fabrication process.86 It was found that when immersing the PbBr2 substrate into the CsBr solution, the most suitable reaction temperature and time are 50 °C and 40 min, respectively, resulting in the PCE of 5.0%. They suggested that either longer reaction time or higher reaction temperature would induce poor morphology of the perovskite film and suppress the hole extraction to the carbon electrode. Liang et al. reported that the carbon-based PSCs with the smooth perovskite films and grain size of up to 1 μm can show a PCE of 6.7% for 0.12 cm2 area and 5.0% for a large area of 1.00 cm2.31 The bare devices exhibited no degradation in a high-humidity ambient environment (RH 90–95%, 25 °C) for over 3 months and at high temperature (RH 90–95%, 100 °C) for about 720 h, which are the most stable PSCs to date (Fig. 4c). Large energy differences between the interfaces of TiO2 (ELUMO = −4.0 eV)/CsPbBr3 (ECB = −3.3 eV) and CsPbBr3 (EHOMO = −5.6 eV)/carbon (WF = −5.0 eV) are unfavourable for the carrier transport and can reduce the device efficiency.87,88 In order to achieve better band alignment to facilitate carrier extraction,89 copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) (EHOMO = −5.2 eV) was inserted between CsPbBr3 and carbon, which successfully boosted the PCE from 3.8% to 6.21%.90 Also, the HTL can establish a Schottky barrier to prevent the direct contact of anode (i.e. carbon) with ETL through the pinholes so that the carrier recombination can be suppressed. The PSCs showed no degradation after a 900 h storage in RH 70–80% at 100 °C, demonstrating the high thermal stability of both CsPbBr3 and CuPc in air.91
The high annealing temperature (250 °C) of CsPbBr3 increases the processing cost of solar cells, reduces the selection of materials for other layers and limits the application in flexible electronics. Our group demonstrated a pyridine (Py)-assisted method to lower the required annealing temperature of perovskite film down to 160 °C and achieved the PCE of 6.04%, which was comparable to that of the control device (Fig. 4d).92Via a pyridine treatment of a wet PbBr2 film inside an up-side-down Petri dish, the PbBr2·(Py)x intermediate film was obtained. The intermediate was able to reduce the activation energy required for crystallization of CsPbBr3via an alternative pathway. Also, the treatment was found to be able to enlarge the grain size at low temperature and change the orientation of the CsPbBr3 film.
Recently, Tang's group developed a new CsPbBr3 PSCs fabrication process and conducting interfacial engineering for better band alignment.65,66,93–101 For example, they reported a multistep solution-processing method for obtaining high quality and purity of CsPbBr3 materials (Fig. 4e).66 This method was similar to the inter-diffusion technique used in hybrid PSCs construction.18 By conducting spin-coating 4 times, the problems of forming CsPb2Br5 or Cs4PbBr6 due to insufficient CsBr or excess CsBr, respectively, can be avoided (Fig. 4f). A ∼5 nm graphene quantum dot (GQD) layer with the energy level of −3.84 eV was inserted between m-TiO2 and CsPbBr3 to reduce the large energy difference, leading to an enhanced electron extraction and PCE. The best device exhibited high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.46 V, high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 8.12 mA cm−2, high fill factor (FF) of 82% and high PCE of 9.72%. Surprisingly, the best device can obtain the high EQE value of up to 93% and extend the EQE range to 550 nm.
To enable smooth energy alignment and fast charge extraction, they introduced a red phosphorus quantum dot (RPQD) layer, a 1.81 eV-bandgap hydrophobic CuInS2/ZnS QD (CISZ-QD) layer, a 2.16 eV-bandgap CdZnSe@ZnSe colloid alloy QD layer or a 2.0 eV-bandgap CsSnIBr2 QD layer at the interface of CsPbBr3/carbon (3 wt% PtNi nanowires doped), which led to the enhanced PCE of 7.86%,9 8.20%,93 8.42%,9 8.65%101 or 9.13%,100 respectively. With a GQD layer at the TiO2/CsPbBr3 interface and a further plasma treatment of the carbon electrode, the device FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2)/GQDs/CsPbBr3/CISZ-QDs/carbon was able to harvest solar energy (PCE: 9.43%) on the perovskite layer and water-vapour energy (0.158 μW) on the back carbon electrode at the same time.96 The devices stored under RH 80%, 25 °C without encapsulation can retain 98% of their initial PCE for 40 days.
By doping the A site of CsPbBr3 with alkali metal cations (Li+, N+, K+, and Rb+), the Cs–Pb, Cs–Br and Pb–Br bonds are strengthened.99 The optimal device constructed from Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 perovskite films achieved a record high VOC of 1.55 V, a high JSC of 7.73 mA cm−2, a high FF of 82% and a record high PCE of 9.86% in CsPbBr3-based PSCs (Fig. 4g) due to the suppressed non-radiative loss and radiative recombination. Meanwhile, the device retained 97% of its initial efficiency after the exposure to air with RH 80% for 700 hours.
In order to boost the light-harvesting efficiency of the CsPbBr3 film, carbon quantum dot (CQD)-sensitized inorganic CsPbBr3 inverse opal (IO) was studied, which was fabricated via a facile spin-coating method using a polystyrene (PS) template (Fig. 5a).77 The CQD/CsPbBr3 IO can slightly reduce the bandgap from about 2.35 eV to 2.25 eV and extend the EQE range to 550 nm so that the generated photocurrent can be increased. Also, the periodically photonic array structure created a photonic band gap, which exhibited an additional absorption peak at 670 nm, as shown in Fig. 5b.

Using the perovskite NCs/QDs precursor is an alternative method to fabricate the perovskite layer, Akkerman et al. developed an environmentally-friendly method to synthesize the 15–20 nm CsPbBr3 NCs by using the low-boiling-point polar/apolar mixed solvents, such as isopropanol, hexane, and butylamine (Fig. 5c).102 It was an annealing-free process for the QDs synthesis and perovskite film deposition because of the exothermic dissolution reaction and high volatility of the toluene solvent. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) the of CsPbBr3 NCs films, prepared by this method (35 ± 4%), is higher than that prepared from the long ligands OA and OAm (∼30%), indicating higher charge-carrier conduction. For resultant PSCs, the perovskite film with nine deposition cycles can lead to the maximum PCE of 5.4% with high VOC of 1.54 V.
Hoffman et al. showed that the annealing process can enhance the crystal growth on the CsPbBr3 QDs films, prepared by using different ligand solvents—OA, ODE and OAm. After adjusting the concentration of the precursor and the thickness of the perovskite film, the best PSC showed the PCE of 5.6%.60 Zhang et al. demonstrated that a very short period (5 seconds) of the NH4SCN/EA ligand solution treatment can efficiently enlarge the grain size of CsPbBr3 QDs films due to surface dissolution and recrystallization at room temperature.61 This ligand solution promoted the establishment of a CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 composite film where a small amount of CsPb2Br5 can help passivate the surface and reduce the number of Br vacancies. By incorporating ETL of ZnO QDs and HTL of spiro-OMeTAD, the device in the ambient air at room temperature can exhibit the best PCE of 6.81%.
As mentioned above, CsPbBr3 can also be used to fabricate tandem solar cells. By using PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) to replace Au electrodes, a semi-transparent CsPbBr3 top solar cell, prepared by vacuum deposition, showed PCE of 5.98% (7.78% for the Au electrode). The PH1000 electrode exhibits a favourable energy level with spiro-OMeTAD and a high average visible transmittance of 80% in the 530–800 nm range. By coupling to an organic bottom cell based on PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F for absorbing in the long wavelength range (Fig. 5d), the four-terminal tandem solar cell can achieve the PCE of 14.03%.103


4.1.2. CsPbI3. 
The bandgap of the cubic phase CsPbI3 perovskite is about 1.73 eV104 with an absorption edge of about 720 nm. The perovskite is black in colour and the maximum attainable current density is about 22 mA cm−2. The black perovskite phase of CsPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable because CsPbI3 strongly prefers the non-perovskite orthorhombic phase (Pnma) at room temperature due to the lower tolerance factor τ of CsPbI3 (0.807) comparing to that of CsPbBr3 (0.824). Therefore, the CsPbI3 perovskite suffers from a higher octahedral rotation distortion and can transform to the orthorhombic phase easily.105 As shown in Fig. 6, the cubic phase of CsPbI3 can only be sustained at high temperature and degrades by decreasing the Pb–I–Pb angle and continuously losing its symmetric structure via a three-step phase transition process during cooling. The structure of CsPbI3 changes from the black α phase (cubic, Pmm) at 360 °C to the black β-phase (tetragonal, P4/mbm) at 260 °C to the black γ phase (orthorhombic, Pbnm) at 175 °C and, finally, to the yellow δ phase (orthorhombic, Pnma) after cooling to 25 °C for several days.55,57,106,107 In other words, CsPbI3 changes from black perovskite (α, β, or γ phase) to yellow non-perovskite (δ-phase) when the [PbI6]4− octahedra change from corner-sharing to edge-sharing octahedra. It was reported in several studies that black CsPbI3 films gradually change to yellow films at room temperature108,109 even in dry air.110 Therefore, for the solar cell applications, it is crucial to prevent the phase degradation from the black phase to the yellow phase.

Researchers found that fabricating CsPbI3 perovskites with smaller grain size can increase the phase stability due to the increased contribution of surface energy.111,112 Ayyub suggested that decreasing the crystal size will force the crystal to maintain the structure with high symmetry (i.e., cubic phase).113 Therefore, researchers adopted a series of methods such as using quantum dots and adding additives of hydroiodic acid (HI), IPA, polymers, sulfobetaine zwitterions, B-site elements, or even water to the perovskite precursor to modify the microstrain or reduce the grain size. After the CsPbI3 perovskite films were stabilized, a rapid improvement in the efficiency of the PSCs from 2.9%108 to 17.06%114 was observed, as shown in Table 2.

In 2015, Ripolles et al. reported that the CsPbI3 films exhibited yellow phase even at the annealing temperature of up to 250 °C and could achieve the black phase perovskite only at 350 °C.115 By incorporating an 8 nm molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) hole transport layer between P3HT and the silver electrode, the best-performing PSCs can achieve the PCE of 4.68%. The high annealing temperature for black CsPbI3 films could be largely reduced from over 300 to 100 °C by using the HI additive due to the induced lattice strain in the resulting perovskite film.108,116 Moreover, the air stability of the black CsPbI3 film could be further improved by an extra IPA treatment.117
In the early studies, it was difficult to fabricate high-quality dark CsPbI3 films via a solution process. Thus, vacuum deposition was commonly adopted and the PCE of around 10% could be achieved. It was reported that the carrier mobilities of the vacuum-deposited and spin-coated CsPbI3 films were about 25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 18 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The carrier lifetime of the vacuum-deposited film exceeded 10 μs, which was 50 times longer than that of the spin-coated one.73 Though the dark CsPbI3 film can be usually obtained at room temperature via the vacuum deposition method, it is identified to be the combination of black cubic phase and yellow orthorhombic phase. Therefore, a high-temperature annealing process is necessary for obtaining the pure-phase CsPbI3 film as well as high device performance.68
As mentioned above, the black-phase CsPbI3 can be stabilized by reducing the crystal size of perovskite. Swarnkar et al. used the perovskite quantum dots in the PSCs (Fig. 7a), obtaining high VOC of 1.23 V and a PCE of 10.77%. The PCE of QD-PSCs was improved during the 60-day storage in dry air, demonstrating excellent stability of the QDs film.33 They further optimized the fabrication process by coating formamidinium iodide (FAI) on the thick CsPbI3 QDs layer. The FAI treatment did not significantly influence the composition of CsPbI3 QDs but doubled the carrier mobility of the perovskite films, resulting in the greatly enhanced photocurrent and a certified PCE of 13.43%.59 Recently, by using a similar fabrication process and Al top electrodes, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reported high PCE of 14.30%.118 It was reported in the previous study that the incorporation μ-graphene (μGF) into the CsPbI3 QDs film facilitated charge transport, suppressed agglomeration of QDs, and prevented moisture from entering, resulting in better performance and stability (Fig. 7b).119

By adding 2D perovskites into the precursor, the crystals of CsPbI3 perovskite films can also be confined to a small scale to improve the stability of PSCs. With the incorporation of equimolar butylammonium lead iodide (BA2PbI4) into CsPbI3, the devices without encapsulation can retain 91% of their initial efficiency after storage under RH 30% for 30 days, though the PCE of the devices is rather low (4.84%).120 Similarly, adding ethylenediamine lead iodide (EDAPbI4) to the CsPbI3 perovskite layer was comprehensively studied by Zhao et al.121 In contrast to materials with mono-functional groups such as BA+ and EA+, the bication EDA2+ with two functional NH3+ groups, was able to cross-link the CsPbI3 crystal units and then stabilized the black perovskite phase. Comparing with the other two bications, 1,4-diaminobutane (BDA2+) and 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)-bis(ethylammonium) (EDBE2+), only EDA2+ can improve the stability of the devices due to the unique (110) layered 2D perovskite arrangement in EDAPbI4 and its ability to reduce the crystal size. With 0.025 mole EDAPbI4 in CsPbI3, the grain size can be reduced from about 300 to 35 nm, further enhancing the stability of the black phase perovskite. The best PSC reached the PCE of 11.86% with high VOC of 1.15 V, and the device lost only 10% of its PCE after being stored in a dark dry box for one month without encapsulation.
After introducing phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) into the perovskite precursor, the quasi-2D PEA2Csn+1PbnI3n+1 perovskite layer (Fig. 7c) was used to improve the device performance and stability.122 The quasi-2D perovskite with a different value of 〈n〉 can be obtained by adjusting the molar ratio of PEA and Cs in the precursor. Due to the quantum confinement effect, perovskite with a smaller value of 〈n〉 (where n ≤ 5) can increase the bandgap and exhibit a blue shift in the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. Because the phase transition of perovskite from cubic to orthorhombic structure was suppressed, the quasi-2D PEA2Csn+1PbnI3n+1 perovskite with 〈n〉 = 60 was identified to be the optimal structure which produces the PCE of 12.4% and sustains its performance longer than the control device. By directly spin-coating PEAI/IPA solution on the CsPbI3 perovskite film, PEA+ can provide surface termination to replace Cs+ on the film surface, leading to defect passivation and stability improvement.123
Apart from adding the 2D perovskite, incorporating the sulfobetaine zwitterion (1.5 wt%) into the perovskite film can decrease the grain size to about 30 nm.112 As shown in Fig. 7d, the zwitterion can electrostatically interact with the PbI2·DMSO colloids, separate the colloids into smaller particles in the precursor solution and isolate the cubic phase perovskite along the grain boundaries to obtain the small grain size. The corresponding PSC, based on the CsPb(I0.98Cl0.02)3 film, can achieve an 11.4% PCE and retain 85% of the initial efficiency after being stored in air with RH 30–40% for 30 days without encapsulation.
The PVP polymer, another material that is able to interact with the CsPbI3 precursor and reduce the grain size of CsPbI3, was studied in detail by Li et al.124 The A-site Cs+ cations interacted with the nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom of the acylamino groups in PVP, inducing shift of peaks in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. That interaction increased the electron Cs+ cloud density of CsPbI3–PVP, decreasing the surface tension as well as the surface energy,125,126 which yielded the stabilized cubic phase of CsPbI3 at room temperature (Fig. 7e). By adjusting the percentage of PVP to 10 wt% and removing the excess PVP by IPA, the best PSC can show a PCE of 10.74% and high stability in air with RH 45–55% without encapsulation (Fig. 7f).
In addition, B-site doping can also modify the photovoltaic response and improve the performance of CsPbI3 PSCs.105 For example, the bandgap of CsPbI3 can be largely reduced from about 1.73 eV to about 1.56 eV by incorporating 4 mol% bismuth (Bi) (Fig. 7g).127 The small radius of Bi3+ ion (103 pm) can increase the tolerance factor τ from 0.81 to 0.84 and structurally induce a small lattice distortion to create microstrain, resulting in stabilized black CsPbI3 at room temperature. By utilizing TiO2 and CuI as ETL and HTM, respectively, all-inorganic CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 PSCs can show stabilized efficiency of 13.17%. On the other hand, doping the Ca2+ ion in CsPbI3 can widen the bandgap and enlarge the grain size while high-performance PSCs can be obtained (Fig. 7h).128 The Ca2+ cations tend to form high bandgap oxides, such as CaO (∼6.3 eV) and CaCO3 (7 eV), on the perovskite surface, leading to surface passivation and recombination suppression, similar to the effect of excess PbI2 in perovskites.129,130 By carefully controlling the trade-off of surface passivation and thickness of the insulating oxide, the devices with 5 mol% Ca2+ cations and 75 nm MgF2 anti-reflection layer on the glass side can exhibit high PCE of 13.5%.
Moisture is typically identified as one of the major threats to the stability of perovskites. Interestingly, Zhao et al. theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that a small amount of water (H2O) in the CsPbI3 precursor with HI can stabilize the black γ-CsPbI3 perovskite film, thereby increasing the device efficiency, which is related to the ionization degree of the precursor solution. A small amount of H2O can provide a strong ionizing medium for DMF and HI, thus promoting the proton transfer reaction in the precursor solution, as described by the following equation: DMF·xHI + xH2O → DMF + xH3O+ + xI−(5)The increase in proton activity and I− concentration causes reduction in the size of PbI2 colloids in the precursor, thereby reducing the crystal size of the perovskite films. Based on the DFT calculations of the effect of crystal surface area on Gibbs free energy, when the crystal size is small enough to achieve high surface energy of about 8600 m2 mol−1, the black γ-CsPbI3 is preferred rather than the yellow δ-CsPbI3 (Fig. 7i). Since γ-CsPbI3 was stabilized, the device efficiency could be improved from 2.91% to 10.15% (11.30% is the best) with the addition of 2 vol% H2O. More importantly, the unencapsulated device showed no efficiency loss after being stored in air with RH 10 ± 5% for over 40 days.131
By using a solution-controlled growth method, Wang et al. reported that the solution process can also produce high-quality perovskite films and these cesium lead halide films can gradually turn dark after spin-coating at room temperature (Fig. 8a).34 This phenomenon reveals that the dark perovskite film can be stable at room temperature due to the natural evaporation of organic solvent. The solvent DMSO can slow down the crystallization rate for mass transport and diffusion in the film, resulting in a high-quality perovskite film. By post-annealing the dark perovskite film at high temperature and incorporating the SnO2 ETL, the CsPbI3 PSC can exhibit superior PCE of 15.7% (certified at 14.67%) and the CsPb(I0.85Br0.15)3 PSC can even display PCE of up to 16.14% (Fig. 8b). The devices showed no efficiency loss after a 500 hour continuous 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a UV cut filter (420 nm) in a nitrogen-filled glove box, demonstrating high photo-stability of CsPbI3 PSCs, prepared via the solution-controlled growth method.

Precursor engineering is also a way to improve the stability of perovskite. By replacing PbI2 with HPbI3 for the precursor of the CsPbI3 perovskite, the unencapsulated devices can sustain above 90% of their initial PCE (9.5% for the best) after storage in dry air of RH 10–20% at 20–30 °C for over 3000 hours (Fig. 8c) or in air with RH 30–90% at 80 °C for 60 hours.110 The HPbI3 can increase the tensile lattice strain of α-CsPbI3, resulting in a reduction of the δ–α transition temperature (from 330 to 200 °C) and a small reduction of the bandgap (from 1.72 to 1.68 eV) (Fig. 8d). The largely improved device stability was associated with the reduced phase transition temperature and smaller crystal size of the perovskite film. By using the precursor of HPbI3+x with the PEAI additives, high PCE of 15.07% was obtained.132 Here, PEAI plays an important role in the crystallization process by interacting with the CsPbI3 crystal and creating steric hindrance to control the growth of the crystal in the orientation of (001), (110), (002), and (220). The steric effect of PEAI also prevents the phase transition of CsPbI3 from the dark phase to the yellow phase, so the devices without encapsulation can maintain 92% of their initial efficiency for over 2 months under ambient conditions with RH 20–30%.
Recently, Wang et al. combined the use of the HPbI3+x precursor with further phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) post-treatment to stabilize the perovskite film.114 By spin-coating the PTABr solution on the prepared perovskite films, gradient Br doping (Fig. 8e) and regrowth of crystals were observed in the perovskite films for passivation, and the hydrophobic PTA cation remained on the surface for moisture isolation. The devices are highly resistant to heat and moisture. More importantly, PSCs based on the stabilized perovskite films can achieve a record high PCE of 17.06% with a record high JSC of 19.15 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8f).

4.2. Mixed halide perovskite

4.2.1. CsPbIBr2. 
When the ratio of iodide to bromide is 1:2, the CsPbIBr2 perovskite possesses a bandgap of about 2.05 eV64 which allows the perovskite to absorb light shorter than 605 nm and generate maximum current density of about 13.5 mA cm−2. CsPbIBr2 appears red in colour in the cubic phase and nearly transparent in the orthorhombic phase. Due to the high content of bromide ions, the CsPbIBr2 devices exhibit much higher stability than the pure iodide-based devices, but the PCE is relatively low. The CsPbIBr2 fabrication methods to date include a two-step fabrication and a one-step fabrication. In order to obtain the desired phase of the perovskite layer, the reported annealing temperatures varied from 135 to 320 °C. Comparing to other cesium lead halides, there are fewer studies on the CsPbIBr2 PSCs, possibly, due to the relatively low PCE (Table 3).

The CsPbIBr2 PSCs were first investigated by Ma et al. in 2016 by using thermal vacuum deposition to evaporate the PbBr2 and CsI precursors.133 By keeping the substrate temperature at 75 °C during the film deposition and 250 °C during annealing, the grain size of the perovskite can be increased to about 500–1000 nm. The devices can achieve the best PCE of 4.7% in the reverse scan without HTL. To avoid the solubility problem of bromide ions, they also demonstrated a two-step fabrication method, including spin-coating of the PbBr2 film and spray-coating of the CsI precursor.64 The optimum conditions involved spraying the CsI precursor on the room-temperature PbBr2 substrate and then annealing the film at 300 °C for 10 minutes. By incorporating the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, the best device can achieve a PCE of 6.3% with negligible J–V hysteresis.
In order to solve the problem of limited solubility of CsX in the organic solvent in the one-step solution process, Jiang et al. introduced new materials, cesium acetate (CsAc) and hydrogen lead trihalide crystals (HPbX3), to perovskite precursors.122 Using this method, they can deposit the perovskite CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 film with all the compositions through one-step deposition, followed by a relatively low annealing temperature of 100 °C. Using this method, they found that CsPbIBr2 is the most beneficial composition and the device can achieve high PCE of 8.54%.
To enhance the poor film quality of the one-step solution processed CsPbIBr2 films, an intermolecular exchange strategy was applied for film preparation by Zhu et al., which involved spin-coating of CsI solution in methanol on the CsPbIBr2 precursor film, followed by a thermal annealing process. The resulting CsPbIBr2 film showed better coverage, larger grain size, and higher crystallinity than the one prepared via the conventional route (Fig. 9a). With the simple device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbIBr2/carbon (Fig. 9b), the optimized PCE of 9.16% was achieved (Fig. 9c).134 By introducing a CsBr interfacial layer between TiO2 and CsPbIBr2 for improved charge transfer, they obtained a 10.71% PCE, which is the highest efficiency reported so far for pure CsPbIBr2-based PSCs.135

Considering that the large bandgap of CsPbIBr2 is disadvantageous for achieving high device performance, efforts have been made to narrow the bandgap via B-site elemental doping. For example, by doping MnI2 into CsPbIBr2 perovskite, the bandgap was gradually decreased from 1.9 eV to 1.75 eV at the 5 mol% doping level.136 Similarly, a bandgap reduction to 1.79 eV was reported as a result of the 10 mol% Sn2+ doping, which led to a red shift of the EQE onset to about 690 nm and a higher JSC of about 14.3 mA cm−2. The devices with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2/carbon can achieve the best PCE of 11.33% with a high VOC of 1.26 V as well as better thermal stability at 100 °C compared to the one of MAPbI3 with encapsulation.137
Recently, CsPb1−xSnxIBr2 with varying x was systematically studied, showing a gradual decrease in bandgap from 2.04 eV to 1.64 eV with the increase of Sn content from x = 0 to 1.138 The XRD patterns revealed good miscibility of CsPbIBr2 and CsSnIBr2 on the hybrid Pb–Sn perovskite films. However, time-resolved PL spectra showed that the addition of Sn deteriorated the non-radiative recombination due to the formation of Sn vacancies. By employing SnO2/C60 ETL and spiro-OMeTAD HTL, CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 was identified as the optimal composition for the photovoltaic device and a PCE of 11.53% was obtained (Fig. 9d–f). More importantly, with illumination under ambient conditions with RH 50–60%, the unencapsulated CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2-based PSC could retain over 90% of its initial efficiency for over 120 minutes, while the PCE of the unencapsulated CsPbIBr2 control device was reduced to 0% after 40 minutes, demonstrating a remarkable improvement in light and moisture stability. A similar stability improvement was also observed for the alloyed Pb/Sn perovskite QDs in which both the pure lead-based and pure tin-based QDs revealed very poor stability.139
Different from the above efforts in obtaining high PCE, Lin et al. performed an interesting study on CsPbIBr2 PSCs with tunable transparency and photovoltaic effect by controlling the phase of perovskite, revealing the possible application in photovoltaic windows (Fig. 10).140 The colour change was achieved by controlling the phase transition of CsPbIBr2 between the high-T red perovskite phase and the low-T colourless phase. To measure the reversibility of the inorganic PSCs, cycling tests were conducted by repeating the process of humid air flow and annealing. The devices with the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film were found to possess the best reversibility and were able to achieve repeatable PCE of about 5%. To construct a semi-transparent solar cell, the aluminium (Al) electrode was replaced by a transparent Al-doped ITO electrode; meanwhile, the PSC achieved the PCE of 4.29%.

4.2.2. CsPbI2Br. 
CsPbI2Br perovskite is a popular composition for PSCs due to better balance between efficiency and stability. Unlike the pure CsPbI3 film, the CsPbI2Br film does not degrade quickly from the dark phase to the yellow phase when stored in a dry environment. The bandgap of the CsPbI2Br perovskite of about 1.92 eV can absorb light with a wavelength shorter than 650 nm and produce the maximum short-circuit current of about 17 mA cm−2. The PCE of the CsPbI2Br-based PSCs is comparable with or even higher than that of some CsPbI3 PSCs (Table 4). With a relatively low bromide content, there is no problem of limited solubility, so the perovskite film can be simply deposited using the most common one-step fabrication method.

In early 2016, perovskite films with the composition of CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 0 < x < 0.33 were first studied using the one-step method. By adjusting the iodide content in the perovskite, a linear trend following the Vegard's law was obtained on the absorbance onset or PL peak against the iodide content. The CsPbI2Br perovskite film was more stable than the CsPbI3 perovskite film during the time-dependent absorbance characterization. By incorporating the perovskite into a typical planar configuration of c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br (∼150 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, the resultant PSCs showed an average PCE of 6.02% and a high PCE of 9.84%.32 A similar study was published nearly at the same time, showing the colour change of perovskite films from yellow to dark when the halide component was changed from bromide to iodide.80 To determine the effect of the PL peak position of CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 against time, strong red shifts were recorded for the fraction of 0.4 < x < 1; a small red shift was observed for x = 0.4 and no change was recorded for the remaining fraction (Fig. 11a). The PL peak shift may be attributed to the phase segregation and the charge carrier recombination at the lower-energy phase.

CsPbI2Br films have shown interesting light-dependent properties. For example, Niezgoda et al. observed a PL red shift under light soaking, corresponding to the de-alloying of the composition from x = 0.33 to x = 0.2 in CsPb(I1−xBrx)3.141 The CsPbI2Br PSCs clearly showed a trend of increasing PCE with increasing exposure time with the highest PCE of 10.3%. Fig. 11b shows that light-induced de-alloying is a reversible process under the alternating exposure to the illuminated and dark conditions. By separately incorporating the perovskite film into ETL and HTL for the PL characterization, de-alloying was found to enhance the hole extraction ability with spiro-OMeTAD instead of the electron extraction ability. However, Zhou et al. demonstrated that the CsPbI2Br perovskite is a light-independent material in the aspects of ion migration and halide segregation.142 By combining the cryogenic galvanostatic test results and the voltage–current measurements, the energy barrier of ion migration of the CsPbI2Br perovskite was calculated to be nearly unchanged under the dark (0.45 eV) and illuminated (0.43 eV) conditions, while the energy barrier of organic MAPbI3 decreased dramatically from 0.62 eV to 0.07 eV. Unlike MAPb(I0.5Br0.5)3, no PL peak shift (Fig. 11c) was observed in the CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 perovskite films, demonstrating the absence of halide segregation in the perovskite films. The best CsPbI2Br PSCs (PCE: 10.3%) without encapsulation exhibited a negligible change in PCE for 1500 hours under a continuous maximum power point tracking test in a nitrogen glovebox (RH 20%), confirming their high photo-stability. We suspect that since the properties of PSCs are highly dependent on the fabrication techniques, different fabrication conditions may induce the discrimination of the above two results. More studies are needed to examine the photo-dependent properties of the inorganic perovskite and the optimum fabrication conditions.
Understanding the degradation mechanism of perovskite films can help researchers solve the stability problem in a more target-oriented way. Mariotti et al. first examined the stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite film upon its exposure to the visible/UV light, water vapour, oxygen, and ozone.143 By combining the results of XRD, visual and optical characterization, water vapour was identified to be fatal for the degradation of perovskite films while long-term (one month) exposure to strong UV light also induced the yellow phase formation. The thermogravimetry (TG) and NMR measurements indicated that there is no water in the yellow phase CsPbI2Br degraded by moisture, indicating that water vapour only initiates the phase transition (degradation) without mixing with the materials. The CsPbI2Br films exhibit high phase reversibility, therefore, although the average PCE of PSCs is lowered from 5.42% to 0.09% by water vapour, it can still recover to 5.42% via re-annealing. The selection of the transport layer is also critical for the stability of PSCs. For conventional PSCs, the typical HTL spiro-OMeTAD requires the Li-TFSI additive to increase conductivity for fast hole extraction.144 However, due to the high hygroscopicity of Li-TFSI, a higher concentration of the Li salt would accelerate the degradation of the device stability.
Improving the perovskite film quality is important for enhancing the device performance. All-vacuum deposition was reported to enhance the JSC and PCE of PSCs to 15.2 mA cm−2 and 11.8% for ITO/Ca/C60/CsPbI2Br/TAPC/TAPC:MoO3/Ag.145 Unlike the organic halides with the gas-like properties, it is easy to control the co-deposition of CsBr and PbI2 in a stoichiometric amount. A very short annealing period of 60 s at 260 °C for perovskite films can enlarge the grain size from about 100 nm to about 3 μm. For the CsPbI2Br perovskite films, fabricated via one-step solution process, the annealing temperature of 280 °C was reported to be optimal to obtain smooth and compact morphology with full coverage. Consequently, the diffusion of humid air into the films was avoided, resulting in much higher stability.146 Although the thin perovskite film (85 nm) may slightly limit the JSC (12 mA cm−2), the device still shows a high PCE of 10.7% and a very high VOC of 1.23 V due to high-quality of the perovskite film that can reduce the charge recombination. Dripping anti-solvent on the spin-coated film was typically used to produce high-quality perovskite films.52,53 Dong et al. reported that green ethyl acetate (EA) was a better anti-solvent for film crystallization than the toxic chlorobenzene (CB) because EA can ensure the formation of larger grains of up to 1.2 μm and fewer grain boundaries and pinhole-free films.147
Perovskite precursor solvent engineering is one of the effective approaches to improve the quality of perovskite films. For example, mixing the solvents DMF and DMSO is beneficial for preparing high-quality thick CsPbI2Br films. Because the precursor materials (e.g., CsBr) exhibit higher solubility in DMSO, the high boiling point and low vapor pressure of DMSO ensure a wide solution processing window.148 For better control of the nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite film, additional heat-processing by hot air flow (HAF) was used by Tian's group, and the influence of DMSO content on the processing window range was studied (Fig. 11a and b).149 It was found that the concentration of the precursor, similar to the solubility limit, can enhance the VOC and PCE of devices because supersaturation can be achieved to promote nucleation and crystallization. Under the optimized conditions of 1 M precursor solution in the mixed solvent of 50% DMSO, a PCE of 12.52% was achieved (Fig. 11c). The research group further showed that the Pb2+ post-processing method of immersing the perovskite film into the lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) methyl acetate solution can effectively suppress the formation of the deep traps by halide ions on the surface, leading to a high VOC of 1.29 V.150
Wang et al. reported another precursor engineering method to fabricate high quality perovskite films.151 More importantly, they successfully reduced the high annealing temperature (>250 °C) of the dark CsPbI2Br perovskite films. By first pre-synthesizing the HPbI3+x compounds and then preparing the perovskite precursor using 2CsI + HPbI3+x + PbBr2, the deposited film was able to turn dark at the low temperature of 100 °C. By further optimizing the annealing temperature of 130 °C and the duration of 6 min, the device can achieve a PCE of 10.5%. The best PSC without encapsulation can still retain a PCE of about 9% after being stored in a dark box with RH 15–20% for one month.
Low-temperature annealing techniques are used for the preparation of flexible PSCs.90,152 The perovskite films prepared by PbX2 and CsX were reported to transform to the dark phase gradually without annealing;34 however, the films may possess a large number of pinholes, which cause short-circuit of the device.152Via the room-temperature solvent (DMSO) annealing (RTSA) treatment, the poor coverage of perovskite film problem can be gradually solved. With low-temperature post-annealing at 120 °C, the CsPbI2Br device can obtain a PCE of 10.4%. By incorporating the a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, the device with the configuration of PET/ITO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/C60/BCP/Ag can still achieve a PCE of 7.3% and show no degradation after 100 bending cycles with a bend radius of 10 mm.
Yin et al. found that the PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) Lewis base adducts improved the perovskite film quality.153 The adducts were obtained by adding toluene to the PbI2 or PbBr2 solution in DMSO, followed by drying the precipitates at 60 °C for 1 day in vacuum. They found that both perovskite films, prepared with and without DMSO-adducts, can gradually turn dark in air (RH 46%) at room temperature (Fig. 11d). With further annealing at 200 °C, the perovskite film, prepared from PbI2(DMSO), PbBr2(DMSO) and CsI, was able to slow down the crystallization rate and enhance crystal growth, resulting in better film quality, such as larger grain size, fewer deep grain boundaries (GBs), smoother surface and a more compact film (Fig. 11e and f). With the benefits of the reduced trap density, prolonged carrier lifetime and better water stability, the best device with an active area of 0.09 cm2 showed a VOC of 1.22 V, a JSC of 15.33 mA cm−2, a FF of 79% and a high PCE of 14.78% with negligible PCE loss after being stored in air (RH 20%) for 500 hours. The devices with 0.49 cm2 and 1.00 cm2 active area exhibited the PCE of 12.80% and 11.61%, respectively (Fig. 11g).
Adding Pb(Ac)2 to the CsPbI2Br precursor is also useful for improving the device performance.154 First, it can stabilize the black perovskite film by reducing the formation energy of α-CsPbI2Br and decreasing the grain size. Second, it leads to the in situ formation of PbO at the grain boundaries after high-temperature annealing, which can promote the interface charge transfer and improve long-term stability of the CsPbI2Br-based PSC.
In addition to precursor engineering, Chen et al. recently reported a decent way for obtaining high-quality CsPbI2Br films,155 which involves a gradient thermal annealing (GTA) process followed by post-treatment of the perovskite film with IPA anti-solvent (ATS) (Fig. 11h). The resulting CsPbI2Br film shows one-micron average grain size and reduced defect density, leading to the best PCE of 16.07% (stabilized at 15.75%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported for the CsPbI2Br-based PSCs (Fig. 11i and j). Furthermore, these devices showed excellent stability against moisture and oxygen and were able to maintain 90% of the initial efficiency after 120 h under the 100 mW cm−2 UV irradiation (Fig. 11k).
In addition, the quality of perovskite films can also be improved by chemical doping. Partial doping of 7.5% potassium (K) cation into the cesium cation at the A site can improve the crystallization process to obtain a uniform and fully covered film.156 The Cs0.925K0.075PbI2Br perovskite film on a c-TiO2 layer exhibited an efficient electron extraction. Thus, the technique was able to enhance the average PCE of PSCs from 8.2% to 9.1% with the best PCE of 10.0% and improve the stability in air with 20% RH.
On the B site, substituting a small amount of Pb with strontium (Sr) can reduce the charge recombination due to surface passivation by Sr (possibly, Sr oxide) on the film surface.157 The PCE of the PSCs prepared at the low temperature of 100 °C can be raised from 7.7% for the control device to 11.3% for the CsPb0.98Sr0.02I2Br device. By doping germanium (Ge) into the B site, the CsPb1−xGexI2Br perovskite can sustain the cubic phase perovskite structure in humid air for 120 hours, much longer than the pure CsPbI2Br (for only 10 minutes).158 Although increasing the content of Ge did not change the bandgap (1.9 eV), VOC of the device was increased gradually from 1.02 V to 1.34 V from x = 0 to 0.3. By incorporating the CsPb0.8Ge0.2I2Br perovskite layer into the SnO2 ETL and poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT)/spiro-OMeTAD HTL, the optimal device showed a PCE of 10.8% with the high VOC of 1.27 V and high stability in high humidity of 50–60%. Xiang et al. reported that doping europium (Eu) into the perovskite films can stabilize the dark phase because the small ionic radius of Eu2+ increased the tolerance factor.159 In addition, the reduction in the grain size of the Eu-doped perovskite films increased the surface energy of the crystal, further stabilizing the perovskite films. Since non-radiative recombination was suppressed and the perovskite crystal was stabilised by doping 0.05 mol Eu2+ into the perovskite, the PCE of devices was increased from 10.21% to 13.71% and the Eu-doped device sustained 93% of its initial efficiency after 370 hours under the 100 mW cm−2 white light LED illumination.
Liu's group introduced a method of doping Mn2+ cations in CsPbI2Br through interstitial sites instead of substitution, resulting in improvements in a series of optoelectronic parameters and device efficiency (Fig. 12a).104 The additional 2% Mn2+ doping into perovskite films led to a small negative shift of the XRD peak at 14.6° due to a slight increase of the lattice constant. The grain size was enlarged to about 1200 nm and more Mn2+ ions were found on the grain boundaries. For the crystalline grain growth driven by Mn2+ cations, a small number of Mn2+ cations can penetrate the perovskite, enlarge the lattice constant and slow down the perovskite crystallization process to improve the crystallinity, while the extra Mn2+ cations can gather on the grain boundaries and passivate the surface. The 2% Mn-doped perovskite film demonstrated better electron extraction, lower trap state density (Fig. 12b), higher built-in potential and longer carrier recombination lifetime, reflecting an enhanced photovoltaic effect. By incorporating a thin CsPbI2Br QDs layer with a HTL of PTAA, the technique can improve the PCE from 11.88% (0% Mn2+) to 13.47% (2% Mn2+) with negligible hysteresis and retain 97% of the initial PCE after the storage for 35 days under RH 25–35% without encapsulation. Following further optimization of PSCs, a heterojunction PSC with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Mn2+-doped CsPbI3 QDs/PTAA/Au demonstrated high PCE of 14.45% (SPO: 14.41%) (Fig. 12c), while the SPO of bare PSCs, constructed from the CsPbI2Br layer and the Mn-doped CsPbI3 QDs layer, was 13.42% and 10.75%, respectively.160 The CsPbI3 QDs become more stable after Mn2+ substitution and SCN− capping. With the FAI and ethyl acetate (FAI-EA) treatment and thickness optimization (300 nm), the CsPbI2Br/CsPbI3 QDs interface can undergo a gradual change in the Br− and I− content for better energy band alignment, which is favourable for carrier extraction, and the PSCs can show the highest PCE by a trade-off of JSC and FF. Although the use of CsPbI3 may influence the stability, the device without encapsulation can still retain 90% of the original PCE after storage in dry oxygen for 20 h.

Recently, an interesting B-site and X-site co-doping strategy was demonstrated for the InCl3-doped CsPbI2Br perovskite, which was able to stabilize the black phase perovskite via structural reconstruction, resulting in remarkably enhanced long-term ambient stability of the perovskite film. Together with the thermal radiation annealing method for obtaining uniform film morphology, PCEs of 13.74 and 11.4% were achieved in devices with areas of 0.09 and 1 cm2, respectively. The PSCs showed no efficiency loss within 80 h in air and only a 20% efficiency loss after a 60 °C heating for 100 h in air.161
Interfacial engineering is also an efficient way to promote the photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br-based PSCs. To alleviate the large energy loss of inorganic PSCs, P3HT was used as HTL for CsPbI2Br PSCs. Greatly reduced electron–hole recombination within the perovskite film was observed due to the passivation of the surface defects by the P3HT film. Furthermore, the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface could be significantly improved by thermal annealing, leading to an enhanced hole-injection. The energy loss between the energy bandgap and the open circuit voltage (Eg–VOC) was reduced, resulting in a record high VOC of 1.32 V. The top performing PSC can obtain a PCE of 12.02% and retain 90% of the initial PCE after being stored for 960 hours at RH 15–40% without encapsulation.62
Very recently, Tian et al. proposed a dual interfacial design for obtaining efficient CsPbI2Br-based PSCs,162 in which SnO2 was used as the ETL and an amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) was introduced at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface; a dopant-free hole-transporting polymer poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT) was used as the anode interlayer. PN4N was beneficial for increasing the crystallinity and the grain size of the perovskite film and reducing the work function of SnO2. Meanwhile, PDCBT with deeper-lying HOMO level allowed better energy level matching at the anode. The synergy of the dual interfacial design leads to a remarkable improvement in the efficiency (PCE > 16%) and photostability of the CsPbI2Br-PSCs.
Employing graded charge transfer process within perovskite films or charge transporting layers offers another opportunity to improve the performance of CsPbI2Br-based PSCs. For example, utilizing a low-dimension perovskite to establish the bulk–nanosheet–quantum dots (3D–2D–0D) configuration (Fig. 12d) can promote hole extraction due to an enhanced built-in electric field.163 By Mott–Schottky fitting to the capacitance–voltage measurements, the 3D–2D–0D structure with smooth energy alignment was identified as having the highest built-in potential compared to other 3D, 3D–2D or 3D–0D structures, resulting in high VOC of 1.19 V. Based on the multi-graded 3D–2D–0D perovskite structure and PTAA HTL, high PCE of 12.39% was obtained. Based on the water contact angle measurements of the perovskite films, the 3D–2D–0D structure clearly demonstrates hydrophobic properties that can prevent serious degradation induced by moisture (Fig. 12e). Consequently, the device without encapsulation exhibits negligible degradation of PCE for 60 days at RH 25–35% and 25 °C (Fig. 12f). Adopting ZnO@C60 bilayer HTL is another method to improve the hole extraction efficiency and reduce current leakage.164 By incorporating the ZnO@C60 bilayer into the 2-step annealed CsPbI2Br perovskite film, the best inverted device shows a high JSC of 15.2 mA cm−2 and a high PCE of 13.3% (Fig. 12g). For devices with a normal structure, the SnO2/ZnO (30/10 nm) bilayered ETL established a smooth cascade energy band alignment to accelerate electron transport, increase recombination resistance (Rrec) and reduce the energy loss.165 Consequently, the device can exhibit a VOC of 1.23 V and a PCE of 14.6%.

5. Lead-free inorganic PSCs
Apart from the cesium lead-based perovskite, there are some perovskites with different composition that can be used as the light absorption layer in solar cells, for example, cesium tin-based perovskites. Exploring different kinds of photoactive materials can increase the feasibility of solar cells. Although lead-based devices have achieved rapid improvement in efficiency, the inherent toxicity of lead is undoubtedly damaging to the environment and potentially dangerous for humans. Therefore, the European Union and many countries had severely restricted the use of lead-based electronic devices, encouraging research of lead-free devices.166
5.1. Tin-based PSCs
By replacing the B-site cation from lead to tin, the properties such as energy bandgap and stability of the cesium tin halide (CsSnX3) perovskite are changed largely. The bandgap of CsSnI3, CsSnI2Br, CsSnIBr2 and CsSnBr3 is about 1.30, 1.40, 1.65 and 1.75 eV,167–169 respectively, which is closer to the ideal bandgap (1.34 eV) of the Shockley–Queisser limit for photovoltaic devices comparing to that of lead-based perovskites.170 Therefore, theoretically, tin-based perovskites are very promising materials for PSC construction.
CsSnI3, a typical perovskite composition for PSCs with a high optical absorption coefficient (about 104 cm−1 in the visible range)171 and low exciton binding energy (about 18 meV),172 exhibits a total of four phases at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 13a, a solid-state reaction of CsI and SnI2 melt leads to the formation of high-temperature (500–708 K) black cubic phase (Pmm, B-α). When cooled, the cubic phase transforms into the tetragonal phase (P4/mbm, B-β) and the orthorhombic phase (Pnma, B-γ) at 380 K and 300 K, successively. The B-γ phase undergoes an easy phase transition to the yellow orthorhombic phase (Pnma, Y) at room temperature upon air exposure, which can convert back to the B-α phase by heating above 425 K under inert atmosphere.167 The 3D structure the B-γ phase and the pseudo-1D double-chain Y phase is metastable and stable at room temperature, respectively.167 Small turbulence of oxygen or water vapour in the ambient air can result in transition from the B-γ phase to Y phase, which is not preferred for light absorption. Also, Y-CsSnI3 further degrades to the zero-dimensional Cs2SnI6 due to oxidation of Sn from Sn2+ to Sn4+.58,167

The tin-based perovskite generates tin vacancies easily, creating high hole density (so-called self-doping effect) and metallic properties which cause the devices to short-circuit or lose efficiency.167,173,174 Sn4+ cations can form oxide or hydroxide layers that accelerate the introduction of oxygen and further decompose the black-phase perovskite film.175,176 Due to the problem of tin vacancies, most inorganic tin-based PSCs showed PCEs of only about 2% to 4%, while the best one achieved the efficiency of only 4.81%.177 The photovoltaic parameters of tin-based PSCs could vary greatly based on different configurations or fabrication conditions. For example, CsSnI3 PSCs can generate high JSC (25.71 mA cm−2) and low VOC (0.38 V)177 or low JSC (10.21 mA cm−2) and high VOC (0.52 V).178 Therefore, due to high instability and low efficiency of cesium tin halide perovskites, there are significantly fewer studies on CsSnX3 compared to CsPbX3. Since the performance of the reported CsSn(I1−xBrx)3 PSCs did not show large variation, the progress of tin-based inorganic PSCs is discussed irrespective of the I–Br composition. The summary of the photovoltaic parameters and the use of additives in tin-based PSCs is presented in Table 5.

CsSnI3 was first used as a solid electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the photoactive N719 dye in 2012.179 Due to the long-wavelength absorption and high hole mobility of CsSnI3, the photocurrent densities of DSSCs were enhanced. In the same year, the CsSnI3 perovskite was utilized as a photoactive layer in PSCs by Chen et al., which was also considered as a Schottky solar cell based on the device configuration of ITO/CsSnI3/Au/Ti (Fig. 13b).27 They fabricated the perovskite films by alternating vacuum evaporation of CsI and SnCl2 layers and post-annealing at 175 °C. However, due to the high series resistance and low shunt resistance, the PSCs could only achieve a low PCE of 0.88%.
Due to the promising bandgap characteristics of CsSnI3 and the improvement of PSC solution processing techniques, CsSnI3 PSCs were further studied by Kumar et al.28 It was found that the addition of tin fluoride (SnF2) to the CsSnI3 precursor led to reduction in the carrier density and an increase in the mobility of perovskite films, implying suppressed Sn vacancies (Vsn) as well as metallic conductivity of CsSnI3. In addition, the density-functional-theory calculations further demonstrated that additional SnF2 can increase the formation energy of Vsn. By adding 20 mol% excess SnF2 to the precursor for suppressing the formation of Vsn and refilling Vsn, the solar cells can show the best PCE of 2.02% with negligible hysteresis in comparison with 3 × 10−4% for the control device (Fig. 13c).
Sabba et al. reported that all cesium tin halide possessed low Urbach energy, implying low structural disorder in Sn-based perovskites.168 The bandgap and the carrier density of CsSn(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites with and without SnF2 as the reducing agent were studied (Fig. 13d). Meanwhile, the addition of SnF2 was found to suppress the formation of CsSn2Br5 in the CsSnBr3 film. Higher Br content in CsSn(I1−xBrx)3 can increase the bandgap of perovskite and, similar to the effect of SnF2, largely reduce the hole carrier density of the perovskite film from 5.28 × 1018 cm−3 for CsSnI3 to 6.32 × 1015 cm−3 for CsSnIBr2, leading to a higher VOC for PSCs. They found that the PSC with the composition of CsSnI2.9Br0.1 achieved the best PCE of 1.76% and all the CsSn(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites presented the first order recombination. The additional SnF2 played an important role in the fabrication of perovskite films since it increased the shunt resistance of resultant PSCs.
The subsequent effects of Vsn suppression by SnF2 on the structural stability, vibrational properties and photoluminescence were studied by Kontos et al. in detail.180 Through the real-time characterizations of the CsSnI3 samples with and without SnF2 after exposure to ambient air, more comprehensive evidence of slowing down of the phase degradation from B-γ CsSnI3 to Cs2SnI6 by SnF2 was observed (Fig. 14a). SnF2 not only reduces the formation of Sn vacancies in the perovskite, but also decreases the work function (WF) of CsSnBr3 from 4.62 eV to 4.52 eV and shifts the valence band maximum (EVBM) from 6.33 eV to 6.10 eV.181 The change of energy bands reduced the energy difference between the CsSnBr3:SnF2 perovskite layer and the adjacent charge transport layers, facilitating the charge extraction in PSCs. The addition of SnF2 can prevent the appearance of zero-valent Sn in CsSnBr3, indicating an enhancement of the stability against the X-ray beam. By incorporating the typical ETL of c-TiO2/m-TiO2 and HTL of spiro-OMeTAD, the CsSnBr3:SnF2-based PSCs can exhibit the best PCE of 2.17%.

Apart from SnF2, the annealing temperature also influenced the performance of solar cells by controlling the number of both tin vacancies and iodide vacancies.182 By performing the XPS analysis of the perovskite, prepared from equimolar CsI and SnI2 in air, the Sn2+/Sn4+ ratio was recorded as 0.26, 1.98, and 0.45 for the temperature of RT, 60 °C, and 150 °C, respectively, demonstrating that moderate annealing temperature is helpful for reducing the Vsn defects, while high annealing temperature accelerates the formation of Sn4+ and triggers the reaction of tin and oxygen to form SnO and SnO2. Via the Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis, I− ions were identified to accumulate at the perovskite/Au interface and form AuI− ions, which diffused into the perovskite and lowered the device performance. Therefore, the PCE of the device was only 0.9%.
Marshell et al. reported several studies on the room-temperature fabrication of perovskite films and the selection of different tin halide reducing agents for CsSnI3 PSCs. They demonstrated that the CsSnI3 perovskite films, fabricated at room temperature, possessed low defect density and, thus, these PSCs exhibited the photovoltaic effect even without the addition of excessive Sn to the precursor.183 By adding SnI2 to the perovskite precursor, the device efficiency was further increased. When they coupled the perovskite film with excess SnI2 to the ETL of C60, a positive vacuum level shift at the CsSnI3/C60 interface increased the VOC of the devices (Fig. 14b). By incorporating with CuI and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), the device with 10 mol% excess SnI2 can achieve the best efficiency of 2.76% at 3 mg ml−1 ICBA and the highest VOC value of 0.55 V at 5 mg ml−1 ICBA.
They further optimized the devices and demonstrated that the inverted device can show a relatively high PCE of 3.56% even without the HTL because of the formation of a thin SnCl2/fullerene interface.58 After comparing the stabilizing effect of different reducing agents (SnF2, SnCl2, and SnBr2) in the perovskite precursor, 10 mol% SnCl2 was identified to be the best for sustaining the B-γ phase in ambient air and obtaining the best CsSnI3 PSCs (Fig. 14c). This is because Cl cannot easily replace large I in CsSnI3, which is favourable for the solid-state diffusion of SnCl2 to fullerene. Moreover, the highly soluble SnCl2 is more beneficial for film processing than SnF2 at room temperature. The excess SnCl2 surrounds CsSnI3 as a very thin layer; meanwhile, some of it diffuses into and interacts with (donate electrons to) the fullerene surface to establish the n-doped fullerene interface which acts as a Schottky barrier to avoid the extraction of electrons by ITO through the pin holes (Fig. 14d and e).
Without the HTL of CuI or PEDOT:PSS, the HTL-free inverted devices were further demonstrated to possess high stability in air.184 This is because CuI fabricated from di-n-propyl sulphide exhibited energy level mismatch with the adjacent layers; it was displaced by the perovskite precursor solvent DMF, while PEDOT:PSS, a hygroscopic material, can worsen the stability of the perovskite device. In addition, the stability of the CsSnI3 film was found to be associated with the pinholes and grain boundaries of the film instead of the crystalline orientation of the film.
The performance of PSCs is dependent on the quality of the perovskite film, which is controlled by the preparation of the perovskite precursor and the configuration of the device. Wing et al. demonstrated the preparation of perovskite precursors by directly dissolving CsSnI3 perovskite powders, which were synthesized from a melting-solidification method, into a mixed polar solvent without using excess SnI2.178 Regarding film deposition, they reported that increasing the annealing temperature of the CsSnI3 perovskite film can stimulate the grain growth and enhance the crystallinity. However, it may also increase the number of the grain-boundary grooves (solid-state dewetting), generate more pinholes, increase the roughness of the film and raise the VSn of the film. As a consequence, the annealing temperature of 150 °C was found to be optimal for promoting the device performance. Regarding the architecture of CsSnI3 PSCs, the mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3 scaffolds on the devices negatively affected their performance. For example, insufficient coverage of the thin CsSnI3 (120 nm) on mesoporous layer caused direct contact of ETL and HTL. In addition, the low crystallinity of B-γ CsSnI3 due to the constrained crystallization scaffold, the non-ideal solid-to-solid interface, and the low-crystallinity impurities of Y-CsSnI3 and Cs2SnI6 on the scaffolds accelerated recombination. Therefore, a planar inverted structure with an HTL of NiOx and an ETL of PCBM was adopted for the fabrication of PSCs without any additional tin halides, resulting in the best PCE of 3.31% and a high VOC of 0.52 V but a small JSC of 10.21 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15a and b).

Adding a small amount of hypophosphorous acid (HPA) to the perovskite precursor is another way to retard the formation of Sn4+, leading to higher stability of the perovskite.185 The HPA with the P–O bond acts as a reducing agent to strongly coordinate with Sn2+ and stabilize the perovskite precursor. Compared to the normal films, the perovskite films with HPA exhibited lower conductivity with reduced carrier density of 1.6 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.5 × 1015 cm−3, leading to suppressed metallic properties and carrier recombination. The perovskite films, prepared using HPA, can eliminate the formation of the SnF2 residue at the grain boundaries and prevent the aggregation and phase separation of SnF2. Previous studies reported that the separated phase of SnF2 may not be beneficial for the performance of solar cells.186–188 By using the concentration of 0.5 μl ml−1 HPA solution (50 wt% in water) for the perovskite precursor, the optimal CsSnIBr2 PSC was obtained with PCE of 3.2% and high thermal stability at 473 K.
The deposition method of perovskite films can directly influence the film quality. Zhu et al. developed a new evaporation-assisted solution (EAS) method, a two-step method, to fabricate uniform, compact and pinhole-free CsSnI3 films, so that the current leakage and carrier recombination could be minimized.75 By spin-coating the SnI2/SnF2 (1:0.3) film on the TiO2 substrate, followed by the thermal evaporation of CsI with different thickness, a 66 nm CsI was produced and found to fulfil the high-quality film requirements. By comparing the PSCs prepared via the EAS method to the devices prepared using the normal one-step and two-step solution methods, the CsSnI3 devices with transport layers of TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD achieved the PCE of 2.23%, 1.34% and 0%, respectively, demonstrating the advantage of EAS method.
In addition, controlling the crystallization conditions can stabilize the tin-based perovskite films. Song et al. demonstrated that using hydrazine (N2H4) gas, a strong reducing agent and a strong base, can inhibit the formation of Sn4+ and enhance the efficiency.189 Due to the strong reducing ability of N2H4, it was introduced into the perovskite film by using a reducing vapour atmosphere method instead of directly adding it to the precursor to avoid reducing Sn2+ to the Sn metal (Fig. 15c and d). The perovskite film was spin-coated under the hydrazine atmosphere, which was created by spin-coating hydrazine on a blank substrate for 5 minutes for vaporization. The possible mechanism for reducing Sn4+ is the following: 2SnI62− + N2H4 → 2SnI42− + N2 + 4HI(6)This method can largely decrease the Sn4+/Sn2+ ratio by more than 20% and reduce recombination. Therefore, the efficiency of CsSnBr3 PSCs can be improved from about 2.36% to 2.82% with the highest PCE of 3.04%.
The fabrication processes and conditions were further optimized and applied to the construction of CsSnI3 PSCs.177 By controlling the CsI/SnI2 ratio from 0.2 to 1.0 (named as 1.0-CsI/SnI2), a ratio of 0.4 was identified as the best condition based on the combined results of a high surface coverage of the perovskite film via SEM, no observed segregation of excess SnI2via XRD and a high shunt resistance. The Fermi level of 0.4-CsI/SnI2 is shallower (−4.5 eV) compared to that of 1.0-CsI/SnI2 (−4.6 eV), indicating that excess SnI2 can reduce the p-doping level of the CsSnI3 perovskite (Fig. 15e). By further enriching the hydrazine atmosphere to reduce the formation of Sn4+ and suppress recombination, the CsSnI3 device can achieve a record high PCE of 4.81% with a high JSC of 25.71 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15f). A previously reported study also indicated that the addition of piperazine in a perovskite precursor can reduce the film conductivity and improve the film coverage; thus, the short-circuit in the solar cells can be avoided.190 After adding 10 mol% SnF2 and 15 mol% piperazine to the 0.4-CsI/SnI2 precursor, the optimal CsSnI3 PSC exhibited the PCE of 3.83%.
Compared to pure CsSnI3, germanium–tin alloy perovskite (CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3) was found to be a better candidate for fabricating stable inorganic lead-free PSCs. Because of the in situ formation of the native oxide (Sn doped GeO2) protection layer after the perovskite film was exposed to air, superior photovoltaic performance and stability of the PSCs were obtained.191 Notably, our group has recently developed a novel protection strategy for fabricating air-stable FASnI3-based PSCs, which was realized by introducing hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid or its salt as an antioxidant additive into the perovskite precursor solution together with SnCl2. The interaction between the sulfonate group (SO3−) and Sn2+ eventually led to the in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain with the SnCl2-additive composite film, which greatly enhanced the oxidation stability of the tin perovskite film. We believe this method should also be useful for obtaining stable inorganic tin-based PSCs.192
If we look back at all the studies on tin-based lead-free PSCs including organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic solar cells, it becomes clear that one major limiting factor for obtaining high-efficiency tin-based PSCs is the significant VOC loss regarding the bandgaps of tin-based perovskites; JSC can easily reach 20–25 mA cm−2, while VOC typically lies in the range of 0.4–0.6 V due to the significant recombination loss of charges caused by the high density of defects in tin-based perovskite films, which can be understood through the following equation:193 (7)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elemental charge, and J0 is the saturation current density induced by thermal generation of carriers. Higher density of defects in a perovskite film increases J0 and, consequently, lowers VOC. The high density of defects in tin-based perovskite films, which is typically up to 1016–1019 cm−3 or even higher, is caused by the chemical instability of Sn2+. In comparison, the defect density in polycrystalline lead-based perovskite films is considerably lower (1015–1016 cm−3).40,194 Therefore, the key to obtaining efficient tin-based PSCs is the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films with low defect density to significantly improve the VOC (e.g. ∼1 V).193 This can be realized by (1) compositional engineering to improve the intrinsic stability and/or increase the defect (Sn-vacancy) formation energy of the perovskite film and (2) the development of advanced antioxidation (or passivation) technologies to prevent the facile Sn2+ oxidation in the perovskite film. In addition, theoretical studies on the defect chemistry/physics of tin-based perovskites are highly desired for guiding the experimental explorations.
5.2. Other ABX3
There are many other photoactive ABX3 perovskites for energy harvesting. However, their performance is much lower than that of caesium lead- and tin-based PSCs. In 2015, Krishnamoorthy et al. found that CsGeI3 possess a suitable bandgap of 1.63 eV for light absorption.195 The rhombohedral crystal structure of the perovskite fabricated (a = 5.98 Å, α = 88.6°) at room temperature is very close to the cubic crystal structure (a = 5.99 Å). Based on the TGA measurements, the inorganic CsGeI3 exhibited high thermal stability up to 350 °C. However, similar to the tin-based perovskite, the high tendency of oxidation of Ge2+ to Ge4+ caused the device to exhibit a low PCE of only 0.11%.
5.3. Perovskite derivatives
The perovskite derivatives include A2BX6, A2B1+B3+X6, AB2X7, A3B2X9, and AB3X10. However, most of their PSCs exhibit low PCE values: AgBi2I7 (1.22%),196 Cs3Bi2I9 (1.09%),197 Cs3Sb2I9 (0.66%),198 and CsBi3I10 (0.4%).199 Interestingly, higher PCE of 4.3% was reported for a new type of silver bismuth halide (Ag3BiI6) with a crystal structure based on edge-shared [AgI6] and octahedral [BiI6] (halide rudorffites), which deserves further exploration in the future.200 In this section, we briefly introduce two relatively common derivatives, which are Cs2SnI6−xBrx and Cs2AgBiBr6.
Since CsSnI3 is oxidized to Cs2SnI6 in air, it is suitable to employ the Cs2SnI6 films for the PSC construction due to the favourable bandgap of 1.3–1.6 eV201–204 and their stable behaviour. Interestingly, the black CsSnI3 films, prepared via vacuum deposition, changed to the Y-CsSnI3 films after several hours and then to the black Cs2SnI6 films after 24 hours in air (Fig. 16a).202 Based on the XRD characterization of the new black films, the ratio of Cs2SnI6 to CsI and the crystallinity of Cs2SnI6 was increasing with time (Fig. 16b). With the optimal thickness of Cs2SnI6 films (300 nm), the TiO2/perovskite/P3HT device obtained a PCE of 0.96%. The same group also explored the feasibility of incorporating Cs2SnI6 films into ZnO nanowire layers and obtained a PCE of 0.86%.205 Lee et al. demonstrated a new two-step method to fabricate the Cs2SnI6 films by e-spraying the CsI on the substrate, followed by drop coating SnI4 on the CsI films.204 Following a series of optimizations of the precursor engineering, film annealing conditions, and interfacial bandgap engineering, the Cs2SnI4Br2 device with an optimal composition of Cs2SnI4Br2 achieved a PCE of 2.02% and high stability for 50 days in air (Fig. 16c).

In 2016, Savory et al. theoretically studied the feasibility of applying double perovskites to the solar cells.206 Cs2AgBiBr6 was employed, which is the most popular composition used for photovoltaic device construction, because it can be simply prepared via a solution method and is stable in air. Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibited an indirect bandgap of about 1.9–2.2 eV207–209 and large exciton binding energy, so it revealed an absorption edge at about 600 nm and a strong exciton absorption peak at about 438 nm in the UV absorption spectrum (Fig. 16d).210,211 Greul et al. demonstrated the deposition of double perovskite films using a spin-coating method.209 When using DMSO as the only precursor solvent to increase the solubility of Cs2AgBiBr6 and a preheating technique to increase the film coverage and quality as well as increasing the annealing temperature to avoid the side phases such as Cs3Bi2Br9 and AgBr, the resultant PSCs can show a PCE of only 2.43% (Fig. 16e), which is limited by the indirect bandgap and high exciton binding energy. Low-pressure assisted methods210 and IPA anti-solvent dropping technology208 are also useful ways to obtain superior Cs2AgBiBr6 film quality, such as high crystallinity and smooth film surface. Although the devices exhibited low PCEs of about 1–2%, high stability in air with RH of 50% or at the temperature of 100 °C was obtained. A recent study suggested that the precise composition stoichiometry is critical for obtaining high quality multicomponent Cs2AgBiBr6 film and in this regard, the solution process was found to be better than vacuum deposition (Fig. 16f).212
6. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, significant progress has been made towards fabricating efficient and stable PSCs based on inorganic CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites. Amongst them, CsPbBr3 with the largest bandgap (Eg ∼ 2.3 eV) is the most resistant to heat, moisture, oxygen and UV irradiation. CsPbI3 with the narrowest bandgap (Eg ∼1.7 eV) suffers from poor structural stability at room temperature in air. Accordingly, the bandgaps and stability of the mixed halide perovskites CsPbIBr2 (Eg ∼ 2.0 eV) and CsPbI2Br (Eg ∼ 1.9 eV) are superior to the bandgaps and stability of the pure halide perovskites. Till now, the highest PCEs reported for the CsPbBr3, CsPbIBr2, CsPBI2Br and CsPbI3 based PSCs were 9.43%, 10.71%, 16.2%, and 17.06%, respectively, almost approaching 60% of the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) efficiency limit (Fig. 1b). The latest record PCE of the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs has reached 80% of the S–Q limit. With similar progress of inorganic PSCs, much higher PCEs could be anticipated in the future. The potential of the lead-free tin-based inorganic perovskites (such as CsSnI3, Eg ∼ 1.3 eV) to obtain high efficiency is seriously undermined by the poor chemical stability of the divalent tin in the perovskite; therefore, the best PCE of only 4.81% was achieved so far. On the other hand, the halide double perovskites offer plenty of chemical combinations for stable lead-free inorganic photovoltaic materials. However, the utilization of these materials in efficient PSCs is rare due to the difficulty in obtaining high quality films and their intrinsic drawbacks of large or indirect bandgaps and large effective mass of charge carriers. In the future, the following aspects should be considered.
For lead-based inorganic PSCs, it is possible to achieve PCEs over 20% with CsPbI3 under optimal conditions due to the suitable bandgap of the material, but the practical use of CsPbI3-based PSCs is hindered by the poor phase stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the phase transition process is required, and then effective phase stabilization methods could be developed (such as composition and dimension tailoring, grain size control, and surface passivation). The efficiency improvement of the bromide and mixed halide perovskite based PSCs could be achieved by bandgap narrowing via the B-site elemental doping. In this regard, Sn-doping should be the most effective way; however, the presence of vulnerable Sn2+ in the perovskites will cause stability problems. Besides, the halide segregation in the mixed halide perovskites and its influence on the device performance and stability should be carefully studied. Furthermore, the potential application of the wide-bandgap CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites in fabricating tandem and semi-transparent PSCs should also be explored.
For tin-based lead-free inorganic PSCs, a significant VOC loss of the current devices must be overcome. We believe it is crucial to reduce the intrinsic high defect density in the perovskite films. To do so, the facile Sn2+ vacancy formation and oxidation should be considerably suppressed. Therefore, promising strategies like composition tailoring (e.g., Sn–Ge alloy perovskite) and antioxidant protection should be investigated in detail. Most of the previous halide double perovskite-based lead-free inorganic PSCs studies are merely based on theoretical calculations. Thus, more experimental studies on the materials synthesis, film preparation, and device fabrication are desired.
At present, there are not enough studies on large-area (e.g., module level) and flexible inorganic PSCs. As the device efficiency and stability keep improving, more studies in these areas are expected in the future. The currently used vacuum deposition and solution-processing methods are suitable for the large-scale fabrication of perovskite films. Though high-temperature (∼300 °C) annealing is typically required for the preparation of CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films, promising progress has been made towards low-temperature (<150 °C) film preparation, offering an opportunity for fabricating flexible PSCs. We suppose that the perovskite QDs ink could be an excellent choice for both large-area and flexible devices. It would be easier to fabricate flexible PSCs by using the inverted p–i–n structures, because the HTLs such as NiOx, PEDOT:PSS, and PTAA can be processed at low temperature. Regarding the normal n–i–p structure, the low-temperature solution-processed TiO2213 and SnO2214 could be good choices for ETLs. Besides, ZnO is also a possible option,215 but the stability of the inorganic perovskite films on ZnO substrates should be carefully examined since ZnO is known to induce the decomposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite due to its basic nature. In addition, graphene and its derivatives may find versatile applications in flexible PSCs as electrode or charge transport materials.216–218
Finally, the development of novel robust charge transport materials, interface modifiers, and functional additives is necessary for improving the efficiency and stability of inorganic PSCs. If a considerable increase in the PCE (e.g., > 20%) occurs in the future, then the long-term stability of the solar cells (with and without encapsulation) is anticipated to be tested under harsh conditions, such as 85 °C and 85% RH with and without light soaking.219

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have emerged to be a promising new photovoltaic (PV) technology of low fabrication cost. With the latest record efficiency exceeding 24%, PSCs rival the established silicon and inorganic thin-film PV technologies on the market. However, the hybrid perovskite materials are unstable under humid and thermal conditions due to the existence of hygroscopic and volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), undermining the application of PSCs. Replacing organic cations with inorganic caesium (Cs+) ions is an effective way to improve the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials. Therefore, continuous efforts have been made toward the construction of efficient and stable inorganic PSCs in recent years. On the other hand, both the stability and PV performance of inorganic perovskites depend significantly on their chemical composition. In this review, the recent advances and the remaining challenges in the field of inorganic PSCs are discussed.
