, Accepted 5th April 2016First published on 8th April 2016AbstractA poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity restricts the efficiency of large scale H2 production from water splitting. Developing highly active, low cost and lasting electrocatalysts has become a top priority. Herein, we have successfully synthesized iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide (Co–Ni–Fe511) nanosheets for the OER. This catalyst exhibits outstanding performance with an overpotential of 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a high polarization current of about 67 mA cm−2 at 330 mV overpotential, a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1, and small degradation after 8 hours of long-term OER operation. In addition, we simulate alkaline water electrolysis at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 at 70 °C in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and the energy consumption of Co–Ni–Fe511 is 45.7 kW h kgH2−1. For comparison, commercial RuO2 consumed 46.8 kW h kgH2−1. This suggests that Co–Ni–Fe511 is more appropriate than commercial RuO2 for water electrolysis in commercial water electrolysis. The high activity, low Tafel slope, good stability and low energy consumption will pave the way for the use of Co–Ni–Fe511 in practical applications.
Introduction
A sustainable supply of hydrogen (H2) for different applications such as fuel cells has been considered a promising alternative to solve global climate change caused by the release of carbon dioxide (CO2). This could be achieved through direct electrochemical or photon driven splitting of water.1–3 Water splitting consists of two processes: the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode in which water is transformed into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (HER, 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−). Meanwhile, the hydroxyl ions produced at the cathode are used at the anode to form oxygen and water molecules (OER, 4OH− → 2H2O + 4e− + O2). Theoretically, the production of hydrogen and oxygen through water splitting could be rather economical and almost limitless due to the endless supply of water. However, hydrogen production is highly restricted by two fundamental limitations in commercial production: the first one is the large overpotential (the gap between the thermodynamic value and the virtual potential to split water) towards HER and OER in alkaline conditions, especially for the kinetically slow OER.4 Since the oxygen evolution mechanism includes several steps which have high reaction barriers, it would lead to a large overpotential to produce hydrogen effectively, hence splitting water to obtain a large scale production of hydrogen will be greatly limited.5 Therefore, OER is also an important step in many significant energy conversion and storage processes.
To date, IrO2 and RuO2 are known as the most efficient commercial OER electrocatalysts. However, even when IrO2 and RuO2 were used as OER electrocatalysts, their lowest potential to obtain hydrogen through splitting water is greater than 1.23 V (the thermodynamic value required to split water through the HER and OER in aqueous medium is 1.23 V). Meanwhile, Ir and Ru are noble metals, not earth-abundant, and hence they are expensive. Using noble metals as catalysts is seriously limited by their scarcity and extremely high cost. These make them less feasible in practical applications. For that reason, extensive efforts have been undertaken to develop low cost, high efficiency and durable electrocatalysts to replace IrO2 and RuO2. Numerous non-precious, earth-abundant first row transition metals and nonmetal materials (N-active materials etc.) show excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER compared with IrO2 and RuO2.6–9 In particular, cobalt, nickel and iron, including their oxides, hydroxides and (oxy)hydroxides have been under intensive scrutiny as low cost catalysts for renewable energy applications. Moreover, they have been reported to have good OER activity in alkaline media.10–16 Among these materials, layered transition metal hydroxides have became the subject of frontier research.17–21 The active sites of layered transition metal hydroxides for OER are surface cations (M), along with a series of intermediates forming (M–OH, M–O, M–OOH, M–OO).22,23 Although there have been numerous efforts to quantify the active sites of layered hydroxides, especially for first-row transition metals in alkaline conditions, the intrinsic activity trends of layered transition metal hydroxides for OER are not still clear.24–26 Many factors such as the catalyst conductivity, electrochemical active area and the structure of the electrochemical catalyst all affect the OER efficiency. In addition, it has been reported that the catalytic activity of cobalt hydroxide could be significantly improved by modifying it with other transition metals such as iron and zinc.27–32 They could possibly change the electronic structure of the catalysts, increasing the electrochemical active sites and conductivity of the electrochemical catalyst.27,31
Inspired by previous reports, a highly active electrocatalyst material of iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheets (Co–Ni–Fe511) for OER was prepared through a one-step solvothermal method. The OER activity of cobalt hydroxide was greatly improved upon the incorporation of iron and nickel. Meanwhile, nickel-doped cobalt hydroxide and iron-doped cobalt hydroxide were also synthesized for comparison. It is shown that the prepared, cost-effective, nanosheet catalyst exhibits a surprisingly high OER catalytic activity, which exceeded the state-of-the-art noble OER electrocatalyst (RuO2) in alkaline media. The OER process occurs with favorable electrode kinetics featuring a low overpotential, high polarization current, small Tafel slopes and low resistance. In addition, the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst shows great durability and low energy cost during long-term cycling under highly alkaline conditions.
Experimental
Synthesis of iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheets
Iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheets were synthesized using a method modified from a previous report.33 Typically, 0.28 g amphiphilic block copolymer polyethylene oxide–polypropylene oxide–polyethylene oxide (PEO20–PPO70–PEO20, Pluronic P123) was added into a mixed solution of 13 g ethanol (EtOH) and 1 g distilled water to form a clear solution with stirring for 15 min, and then 0.125 g Co(Ac)2·4H2O and 0.098 g hexamethylenetetramine were added into the above mixed solution. After stirring for about 15 min, a purple solution was obtained. Next, 19.5 mL ethylene glycol (EG) was added into the above mixed solution. After stirring for 15 min, 0.0248 g Ni(Ac)2·4H2O dissolved in 2.6 g EtOH and 2 g H2O and 0.0404 g Fe(NO3)3·8H2O dissolved in 2 g EtOH were all added into the above solution. Finally, a transparent solution was obtained. The obtained EtOH + EG precursor solution was statically aged for 1 day. After aging, the transparent precursor solution was transferred into a 20 mL autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 5 h. The products were washed with distilled water and ethanol three times, and the brown powders were collected after washing/centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained product Co5xNixFex(OH)15x was named Co–Ni–Fe511 (where 511 is the molar ratio of cobalt, nickel and iron). Iron doped cobalt hydroxide (Co5xFex(OH)13x) and nickel doped cobalt hydroxide (Co5xNix(OH)12x) were named Co–Fe51 and Co–Ni51, respectively. Other ratios of iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide Co5xNiyFez(OH)10x+2y+3z (Co–Ni–Fe5yz) were also prepared by altering the doping ratios of nickel and iron for comparison.
Synthesis of cobalt hydroxide nanosheets
0.2 g P123 was added into a mixed solution of 13 g ethanol and 1 g distilled water to form a clear solution with stirring for 15 min, and then 0.125 g Co(Ac)2·4H2O and 0.07 g hexamethylenetetramine were added into the above mixed solution. After stirring for about 15 min, a purple solution was obtained. Then, 13 mL of ethylene glycol was added into the above mixed solution. After stirring for 30 min, a transparent solution was acquired. The obtained EtOH + EG precursor solution was statically aged for 1 day. Then, the transparent precursor solution was transferred into a 20 mL autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 2 h. The products were washed with distilled water and ethanol three times. Then, the products were collected after washing/centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
Material characterization
The crystal structure and phase composition of the resulting products were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (TD-3500 X-ray powder diffractometer, China) with Cu Kα radiation at 30.0 kV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S4800 microscope (Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2F20 S (USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 KV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained from a Kratos XSAM 800 spectrometer (Manchester, U.K). The infrared spectra were obtained using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Suger Land 6700, TX, USA).
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical experiments were performed in a standard three-electrode system using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm, Switzerland) electrochemical workstation to collect electrochemical data. A glass carbon disk electrode (diameter of 3 mm) and carbon fiber paper (1 mm thick) for the catalyst ink to load on were used as the working electrode, a platinum plate and a Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. Freshly O2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte to study the OER performance, while 6 M KOH aqueous solution was used for the simulated alkaline water electrolysis. Preparation of the working electrodes containing the inks of the catalysts to be investigated was as follows: 3 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 375 μL of water, 125 μL of isopropanol and 10 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Dupont). Then the mixture was ultrasonicated for at least 30 minutes to obtain a homogeneous ink. 2 μL and 100 μL of the dispersive ink were transferred onto the glassy carbon disk (GC) and carbon fiber paper, respectively, leading to catalyst loadings of 0.12 mg cm−2 and 0.6 mg cm−2, respectively. For the XPS analysis and the SEM characterizations of Co–Ni–Fe511 after OER, the catalyst ink was transferred onto ITO. Finally, the prepared catalyst films were dried at room temperature. The faradaic efficiency of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst was measured on a PASCO O2 sensing device (USA). Overall water splitting was conducted in a two-electrode system which was made of an anode (Co–Ni–Fe511) and a cathode (Pt/C 20%). The two-electrode system for comparison was made of an anode (RuO2) and a cathode (Pt/C 20%).
Linear scan voltammograms (LSV) were obtained by sweeping the potential from 0 to 0.75 V vs. Hg/HgO at room temperature with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 to minimize the capacitive current, and we also collected LSV data at 1 mV s−1 for Tafel kinetic analysis. All polarization (LSV) curves were corrected with IR compensation. Chronoamperometry was carried out under a constant overpotential of 290 mV for the catalysts supported on carbon fiber paper. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was measured from the double-layer charging curves using cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates within a small potential range (0.92–1.02 V vs. RHE) where no Faraday redox reactions occur. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at a fixed potential with a 5 mV AC amplitude within the frequency range of 100 to 0.01 kHz. All electrochemical experiments were conducted at room temperature while the simulation of alkaline water electrolysis was performed at 70 °C. The potentials reported in this work were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation, ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.059pH + E°Hg/HgO, where EHg/HgO and E°Hg/HgO represent the potential against the Hg/HgO reference electrode and the standard electrode potential of Hg/HgO at 25 °C (0.098 V), respectively. The equation η (V) = E(RHE) − Eθ was used to calculate the overpotential (η) of the electrocatalysts, where Eθ represents the thermodynamic potential for OER. The linear portions of the Tafel plots were derived from the LSV curves according to the Tafel equation η = blog(j) + a, where j represents the current density and b is the Tafel slope.
Results and discussion
The iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxides were successfully synthesized via an amphiphilic block copolymer and ethylene glycol co-surfactant self-assembly method (see Experimental section for details). We performed X-ray diffraction analysis on Co–Ni–Fe511 to reveal its crystal structure. In the XRD pattern (Fig. 1d), all diffraction peaks are consistent with the α-Co(OH)2 crystalline phase with a typical profile for the hydrotalcite-like structure,34–36 suggesting that the incorporation of iron and nickel into cobalt hydroxide did not result in any additional crystal diffraction peaks. This observation suggested that isomorphous replacement of iron and nickel into the cobalt hydroxide lattice formed a solid solution.37,38 The SEM images (Fig. 1a and b) show that the product consists of thin sheets with sizes of around 1 μm to 4 μm which could be clearly distinguished, and all of the edges of the nanosheets are rolled up due to the surface tension.33 Meanwhile, the thin sheet structure was not substantially changed compared with the morphology of Co(OH)2 (Fig. S1a and b†), suggesting that a solid solution was formed.27 The TEM image (Fig. 1c) also confirms the formation of an ultrathin nanosheet structure, and the corresponding SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 1c) reveals the polycrystalline structure of the Co–Ni–Fe511 material. The composition of the obtained samples were further determined using EDS, as shown in (Fig. 1e); cobalt, iron and nickel were found in the spectrum, suggesting we have successfully prepared ultrathin iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheets.

The FTIR spectrum of Co–Ni–Fe511 is shown in Fig. 1f. Obviously, the FTIR spectrum of the Co–Ni–Fe511 is similar to that of α-Co(OH)2. The large band located at 3436 cm−1 is assigned to the O–H stretching vibration modes of interlayer water molecules and hydrogen atoms which are bound to the OH groups in cobalt hydroxide.34 Similarly, a pair of peaks at around 2925 cm−1 and 2860 cm−1 may be caused by hydrogen bonding in the interlayer, which suggested the existence of interlayer water molecules or infrared active vibrations of the absorbed water.39 The peak at 1630 cm−1 corresponds to the bending modes of the interlayer water molecules.40,41 However, the peak for the bending modes of the interlayer water molecules is different in Co(OH)2 and Co–Ni–Fe511. For Co(OH)2, the peak for the bending modes of the interlayer water molecules is located at around 1600 cm−1, and the strength of this peak for Co–Ni–Fe511 is also decreased compared with Co(OH)2. This may be caused by the inductive effect of the metal atoms, thus changing the electron cloud in the interlayer water molecules. Therefore the characteristic absorption frequency of the bending modes of the interlayer water molecules is changed.
The physical properties of the Co–Ni–Fe511 nanosheets were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which could provide information on the chemical constituents, valence states, and binding energy of the material. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of Co–Ni–Fe511 for the Co 2p, Ni 2p, Fe 2p and O 1s, with the two main 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit lines located at 780.3 eV and 796.5 eV. Moreover, the Co 2p deconvolution spectra (Fig. S2a†) has five peaks at 780.3, 782, 786, 796.5, and 802.5 eV which match well with cobalt hydroxide and could be assigned energy regions. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 2a) shows the binding energy of the octahedral cobalt cation bound to hydroxyl.21,42 Fig. 2b shows the Ni 2p region, which comprises four typical discernible peaks corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 with binding energies located at 855.2 eV and 873 eV and their satellite peaks. It is suggested that nickel is in a bivalent state.8 The Fe 2p spectrum shows a low signal to noise ratio compared with the other spectra of the elements, which may be due to its relatively small content. Two main peaks located at 712.8 eV and 725 eV corresponding to Fe 2p2/3 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, were observed, suggesting that Fe is in the trivalent state.43,44 The O 1s spectra of Co–Ni–Fe511 shows a single peak at 530.7 eV, suggesting the O 1s is in a hydroxide-like surrounding.27

In order to assess the electrochemical catalytic properties of the Co–Ni–Fe511 nanosheets for electrochemical oxidation of water to oxygen, the prepared Co–Ni–Fe511 film on a glassy carbon electrodes was firstly examined using LSV in 1 M KOH solutions. Co–Ni51, Co–Fe51, Co(OH)2, commercial RuO2 (a benchmark catalyst for OER), and the bare polished glassy carbon electrode were tested for comparison. The LSV curves of the above materials in the anodic direction are shown in Fig. 3a. The LSV curves suggested that Co–Ni51, Co–Fe51 and Co–Ni–Fe511 all have a positive effect to improve the OER performance compared with Co(OH)2. Meanwhile, we found that Co–Ni–Fe511 displays a more outstanding OER performance and has the highest polarization current, about 67 mA cm−2 at a 330 mV overpotential, larger than cobalt hydroxide with only iron or nickel doping. The Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst could remarkably reduce the overpotential from 340 mV (Co(OH)2) to 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. However, commercial RuO2 shows a larger overpotential (351 mV) than the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst at 10 mA cm−2. Generally speaking, the effectiveness of the electrochemical catalyst for OER was obtained by calculating the overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is deemed to be equivalent to a 10% solar energy conversion efficiency.45 The LSV data for these catalysts indicated a synergistic effect of iron and nickel to enhance the OER activity of cobalt hydroxide. The LSV data for other ratios of iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide are shown in Fig. S3d†. As the amount of iron and nickel doped in cobalt hydroxide increased, the OER efficiency of catalysts decreased to be even less than the OER activity of cobalt hydroxide.

(d) Faradaic efficiency of Co–Ni–Fe511 at a 340 mV overpotential, the theoretical line suggests a yield of O2 corresponding to a 100% Faraday efficiency. 
To gain more critical insight into the OER reaction kinetics, Tafel plots derived from the polarization curves were established. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding Tafel plots. It can be seen that the Tafel slope decreased from Co(OH)2 (50 mV dec−1) to Co–Ni–Fe511 (43 mV dec−1), suggesting a more rapid OER rate after incorporation of iron and nickel. Moreover, Co–Ni51 and Co–Fe51 also display a smaller Tafel slope than cobalt hydroxide. As we know, a small Tafel slope is more beneficial for practical applications because it could cause a significant increase in the oxygen evolution rate with a slower increased overpotential. We also investigated the electrode kinetics of our electrochemical catalysts using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests at a potential 1.62 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 3c, Co–Ni–Fe511 shows the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and the Rct of our electrochemical catalysts increased in the order Co–Ni–Fe511 < Co–Ni51 < Co–Fe51 < Co(OH)2. The variation in Rct is in accordance with the LSV data, suggesting that the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst has faster electrode kinetics. To investigate the practical use of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst, the faradaic efficiency of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst was also studied. Fig. 3d shows that Co–Ni–Fe511 almost achieves 100% faradaic efficiency which suggests that all the polarization current was derived from producing oxygen. The smaller Tafel slope, lower resistance and high faradaic efficiency indicate more favorable OER kinetics for Co–Ni–Fe511.
The stability of Co–Ni–Fe511 under conditions of continuous oxygen production was also explored using chronoamperometry measurements at 1.52 V vs. RHE for 8 hour in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Co–Ni–Fe511 electrode shows excellent stability with 11% decay compared to the initial value, smaller than cobalt hydroxide (15% decay) (Fig. S3c†). The stability of Co–Fe51 and Co–Ni51 decreased by 23% and 13% (Fig. S3c†), respectively. It is suggested that the iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide provide greater stability than only iron or nickel doped cobalt hydroxide. It is worth noting that the RuO2 catalyst degraded by 59% from its initial value, meaning that the Co–Ni–Fe511 compound is much more stable than commercial RuO2. After the OER stability test, we performed SEM characterization to probe the morphology changes of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst (inset of Fig. 5a). The catalyst displays no obvious morphology change after long-term OER operation, suggesting excellent structural stability of the catalyst. In a word, the high activity, low charge-transfer resistance and excellent stability demonstrate the excellent performance of Co–Ni–Fe511 for OER.
The performance of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst was compared with some state-of-the-art cobalt based catalysts (Table 1). Co–Ni–Fe511 is more efficient than graphene–NiCo2O4 hybrid catalysts.32 It is much better than ZnxCo3−xO4 nanoarrays and spinel type ZnCo2O4.37,46 It is more efficient than Co3O4/N-doped graphene oxide hybrid.47 Co–Ni–Fe511 is also more active than amorphous Co(OH)2 catalysts and CoxSy/N,S co-doped porous carbon, with an overpotentials 72 mV and 182 mV lower than the amorphous Co(OH)2 catalyst and CoxSy/N,S co-doped porous carbon, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2.48,49 All of them require a larger catalyst loading and higher overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under similar operating conditions.

The high performance of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst was compared with novel metal oxyhydroxide catalysts which have turned out to be promising OER catalysts. As we can see from Table S1,† our Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst is also considerably competitive compared to the latest metal oxyhydroxide OER catalysts, which will further promote our Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst for practical application.
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Co–Ni–Fe511, Co–Ni51, Co–Fe51 and Co(OH)2 was investigated; it could be obtained from the electrochemical capacitance of the electrode–electrolyte interface (EDLC). The electrochemical capacitance was determined by measuring the non-faradaic capacitive current associated with the double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependence of the cyclic voltammograms. To measure the double-layer charging from the CV curves, a potential window in which no apparent faradaic processes occur was determined from potentiostatically cycling in the range from 0.92 to 1.02 V vs. RHE, in which the current is mainly attributed to the charging of the double layer. CV cycles of these catalysts in a non-faradaic potential range are shown in Fig. 4a–d. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) directly depends on the ECSA and the scan rate (ν) namely Cdl ∝ ν × ECSA.50 Cdl can be obtained by calculating the slope of the linear relationship shown in Fig. 4e. The capacitance of Co–Ni–Fe511 is 475 μF cm−2, while the capacitance of Co–Ni51 is 294 μF cm−2, 148 μF cm−2 for Co–Fe51, and 120 μF cm−2 for Co(OH)2. After incorporation of iron and nickel, the electrochemical effective surface area of cobalt hydroxide rapidly increased, which may lead to more active sites in the catalyst to subsequently improve the OER activity.

EIS under OER operating process was performed to further investigate the interface reaction and electrode kinetics of these catalysts at different applied potentials. Rct is related to the kinetics of electrocatalysis and a lower value represents a higher reaction rate, which is strongly reliant on the overpotential of OER. Fig. S3a and b† show the EIS data of Co–Ni–Fe511. The EIS Nyquist plots for Co–Ni–Fe511 supported on CFP show a smaller Rct after chronoamperometry measurement. The superior electrocatalytic performance of Co–Ni–Fe511 could be explained by the low charge transfer resistance, which further illustrated the high electrocatalytic performance of the Co–Ni–Fe511 towards OER.
We also utilized the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst to simulate alkaline water electrolysis at 70 °C in 6 M KOH with a continuous current density of 200 mA cm−2 for 10000 s, and 20% Pt/C and a Co–Ni–Fe511 electrodes were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. For comparison, a RuO2 electrode was prepared at the same time. These catalysts were loaded on CFP (0.6 mg cm−2). The bias potentials at different current densities are shown in Fig. 5b. It is worth noting that our Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst needs a lower bias potential to maintain a current density of 200 mA cm−2 than RuO2, as does the electrical energy consumption for H2 production of the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst. According to the electric energy consumption of commercial alkaline water electrolysis systems,51 the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst allows the energy consumption to be reduced to 45.7 kW h kgH2−1 compared with the reported standard energy consumption of commercial alkaline systems (48 kW h kgH2−1 at 60–80 °C at a current density of 200 mA cm−2). However, RuO2 has a larger electrical energy consumption (46.8 kW h kgH2−1), suggesting that our Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst is more suitable than RuO2 when applied to commercial alkaline water electrolysis.

We performed voltammetric analysis to discuss the OER process of Co–Ni–Fe511 and the role of nickel and iron in OER catalysis. Firstly, we collected CV data of the Co(OH)2 catalyst (Fig. S2d†). The first CV cycle of Co(OH)2 displays a pair of redox peaks, but there is a cathodic peak on the reverse sweep which is smaller than the corresponding anodic peak. The following CV cycle shows the same tendency. This redox process could be assigned to an irreversible oxidation of Co(OH)2 to CoOOH via the following reaction: 
Co(OH)2 + OH− ⇌ CoOOH + H2O + e−
(1)
The reaction at higher potential can be assigned to the following reaction: 
CoOOH + OH− ⇌ CoO2 + H2O + e−
(2)
This can be seen in other studies on Co(OH)2 or CoOx films.27,31,43,48,52 Next, we analyzed the CV cycles of Co–Ni–Fe511, Co–Ni51 and Co–Fe51. These catalysts show similar redox characteristics, as can be seen in Fig. 6a. Iron and nickel do not show any redox features, suggesting that the active sites of cobalt hydroxide for OER may not change after iron or nickel incorporation. The XPS data of Co–Ni–Fe511 after OER analysis also agreed with this result. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS (Fig. 6b) spectrum at the surface of Co–Ni–Fe511 after 50 CV cycles was close to the trivalent state, while the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 6c) developed a peak in the oxide-environment shoulder at lower binding energies, which suggested that CoOOH formed at the surface of the initial Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst. In addition, the change in the surface of the Co–Ni–Fe511 nanosheets after 50 CV cycles (Fig. 6d) might also demonstrate the presence of CoOOH on the surface of the nanosheets. However, the valance states of nickel and iron (Fig. S2b and c†) showed negligible change which was consistent with our CV analysis. Moreover the Co2+/3+ oxidation peak of cobalt hydroxide after incorporation of iron and nickel shifted anodically in the potential range, suggesting that iron or nickel changed the electronic structure of cobalt hydroxide. Thus the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ is more difficult, leading to Co3+/4+ which has more oxidizing power and sequentially increased the OER kinetics. This is consistent with related research in which iron substituted the Co2+ sites in cobalt hydroxide or iron substituted the Ni2+ in nickel hydroxide.10,27 Furthermore the LSV data of Co–Ni–Fe511 indicated that the substitution of iron and nickel into the cobalt hydroxide greatly improved the OER activity. Meanwhile, the incorporation of nickel and iron increased the active surface area of cobalt hydroxide, and incorporation of nickel and iron might also improve the defect or edge sites of the CoOOH formed on the surface of the nanosheets which play an importance role in the OER process.

Conclusion
In summary, through incorporation of iron and nickel into cobalt hydroxide, we have successfully prepared a Co–Ni–Fe511 compound catalyst. After incorporation, Co–Ni–Fe511 exhibits excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1 and a low overpotential of 288 mV at a current density 10 mA cm−2, a high polarization current of about 67 mA cm−2 at 330 mV overpotential, making this catalyst competitive amongst excellent OER electrocatalysts. The influence of iron and nickel on the electrocatalytic activity has also been investigated. Moreover the Co–Ni–Fe511 nanosheets display excellent stability, and have a low energy cost when simulating alkaline water electrolysis. The simple preparation method for the Co–Ni–Fe511 catalyst may make it an excellent catalyst for the next generation of energy storage applications.
