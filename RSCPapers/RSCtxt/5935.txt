Here, we study the reactions occurring between CsPbX3 (X = Br, BrI, I) perovskite and metal (M = Ag, Cu, Au) nanocrystals. We demonstrate a fast (<1 hour) optical and structural degradation of the I-containing nanocrystals driven by the formation of metal iodides with reaction kinetics according to the following order Cu < Ag < Au.

Introduction
Metal–halide perovskites are receiving huge attention from the research community as light harvesting materials due to their excellent chemical, optical and charge transport properties.1–9 With their tunable band-gap, relatively large absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths and high defect-tolerance, metal–halide perovskites are approaching the limit of commercial standards for photovoltaic devices in terms of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).10 Along with the advancements in bulk perovskites, colloidal all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently been under intense study.10–12 In addition to the properties listed above, perovskite NCs distinctively exhibit impressive emissive properties, with narrow bandwidths and close-to-unity quantum yields that are accessible throughout the entire visible range.13–16 Thus, they have been successfully tested in a number of applications such as light-emitting diodes,17–19 lasers,20,21 photodetectors,22,23 solar cells24,25 and concentrators,26 and photocatalysts.27–29
Despite such great promise, metal–halide perovskites suffer from poor extrinsic and intrinsic stability.12,30 These issues have been studied under environmental conditions such as heat, illumination and moisture, both in bulk and in NC form.31,32 Additional efforts have been concentrated on the stability of the full device architecture in bulk photovoltaic cells, including the detrimental interaction between the perovskite layer and the metallic back-contact.33–38 In devices containing iodine-based perovskites and silver (Ag) back-contacts, the iodide anion (I−) was found to migrate through the hole transport layer towards the Ag layer, forming AgI at the interface, consequently decreasing the overall PCEs and the device stability.33,34,38 While at first gold (Au) was suggested to be a more viable candidate as a back-contact metal,39 it was later demonstrated that degradation of the perovskite layer due to Au migration occurs under operating conditions.35 On the same basis, copper (Cu) was suggested to be the most stable contact material for using with perovskites in photovoltaic devices.40 While in bulk perovskites, metal-induced degradation has been of concern, the interactions between perovskites in NC form and metals have been mostly investigated for the purpose of tuning the optical properties and include post-synthetic cation–exchange reactions,14,41 doping,42,43 and the formation of perovskite–metal nanoscale heterostructures (Au and Ag).44–46 In all of these studies, the metal was introduced into the colloidal perovskite NC system in the oxidized state as metal halide compounds (e.g. SnBr2, AuBr3, CuBr2, AgI).14,42,45,46 To the best of our knowledge, no further investigations were conducted to observe the stability of perovskite NCs with common electrode metals in their metallic state.
Herein, we aim to extend our understanding of the perovskite–metal chemistry in the nanoscale regime and to elucidate the instability problems that can be caused by such interactions. With this goal in mind, we systematically investigate the reaction among NCs of all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Br, BrI, I) perovskites and three of the most widely used metals as contact electrodes: Cu, Ag and Au. Using a miscellanea of optical, morphological and compositional characterization tools, we demonstrate relatively fast (<1 hour) optical and structural degradation of the perovskite NCs upon the introduction of the metal NCs into the colloidal suspension. The degradation is particularly prominent with the iodine-containing perovskites, driven by the formation of noble metal iodides. Additionally, similar degradation effects are observed in the solid-state when a hole trasporting layer is interposed between the perovskite and metal NCs. These results point out the need for thoughtful considerations while constructing optoelectronic devices out of all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs where the use of contact metals is a necessity.
Results and discussion
The CsPbX3 (X = Br, BrI, I) and metal NCs were synthesized according to the details given in the Experimental section. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the perovskite NCs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A–C. They display a cubic shape with an average side length of 10 nm. Fig. 1D shows the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the perovskites with different halides. CsPb(BrI)3 exhibits a weighted-average PL energy between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, which indicates an equal composition of each halide. TEM images of the Cu, Ag and Au NCs used in this study are reported in Fig. 1E–G. They are all spherical, with an average diameter of 10 nm. Their extinction spectra is shown in Fig. 1H, demonstrating the characteristic localized surface plasmon resonance peaks for each metal. All sample sets exhibit relatively low polydispersity and narrow size and shape distribution (Table S1†). Similar sizes among the samples are crucial to exclude size effects (i.e. faster dissolution of smaller NCs) while comparing reaction outcomes.

The next step involves mixing the synthesized perovskite and metals NCs in solution and following the evolution of the reaction by changes in the PL of the perovskite NCs (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1†). CsPb(BrI)3 is used throughout the rest of this study, as it was found to be the most informative system. Indeed, the presence of both halides facilitates the monitoring of the reaction through compositional changes of the starting perovskite NCs. Fig. 2 reports the PL intensity maps (Fig. 2A–C) and the corresponding 2D plots (Fig. 2D) during the 1 hour following the mixing of the CsPb(BrI)3 NCs with the denoted metals. All systems exhibit a PL shift to higher energies, in the range of 0.2–0.4 eV. Control experiments were performed with perovskite-only samples to confirm that the differences in the optical properties are not caused by the continuous illumination and measurement conditions (Fig. S2†). It was also verified that irradiation contributes only moderately to the reactions, which occur also in the dark (Fig. S3†). The observed PL shift is consistent with I− leaching out of the perovskite structure and the NC composition evolving towards the pure CsPbBr3 NCs (Fig. 1D). Control experiments (Fig. S1†) show immediate quenching and no shift for the pristine CsPbI3 NCs and slower PL changes for the CsPbBr3 NCs upon mixing with the metals, thus supporting the conclusion of higher reactivity for the I− containing NCs. As for the reactivity of the metals with the mixed halide NCs, Fig. 2D suggests an interesting trend of the reaction kinetics which change according to the following order Cu < Ag < Au.

(D) Emission energy versus time for the three systems. Note: The PL intensity changes throughout the experiment, however no conclusion can be derived from them, as a number of phenomena impacts simultaneously the PL, including the compositional evolution towards a Br-rich composition, that has an inherently higher quantum yield, and the formation of transient defect states due to the halide migrations, that would result in quenching. 
Structural, morphological and compositional characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), TEM analysis and energy dispersive X-ray mapping (EDX) to get further insights into the reaction occurring between the perovskite and the metal NCs. The XRD and TEM data (Fig. S4–S7†) complement well the information obtained from the PL experiments. Indeed, the XRD peaks for CsPb(BrI)3 shift to higher angles upon mixing with the metals, which is consistent with having a cubic Br-rich perovskite structure with smaller lattice constants (Fig. S4†). The TEM shows intact cubes, which are presumably Br-rich (Fig. S5†). The XRD signal intensity for CsPbI3 is drastically reduced (Fig. S4†) and no cubes are observed in the TEM upon mixing with the metals (Fig. S6†). On the contrary, the XRD patterns for CsPbBr3 do not show any significant change upon mixing with the metals, neither in intensity or peak shift, which indicates that the shift for CsPb(BrI)3 is indeed related to a compositional change (Fig. S4†). The TEM analysis does show minor degradation in the CsPbBr3 cubes, consistently with their much slower reaction kinetics with the metals (Fig. S6†). As the metal/perovskite NC ratio increases, the XRD data point at a more severe degradation of the perovskite NCs (Fig. S7†). The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 3) confirm the retention of the CsPb(BrI)3 cubic shape. The EDX mapping reveals the presence of the iodine throughout the TEM grid while the bromine is mostly concentrated within the cubes (Fig. S8†), further supporting the hypothesis of selective leaching of the iodide from the perovskite structure. The EDX mapping allows to disregard the possibility of a cation–exchange between noble metals and Pb2+/Cs+ and of metal doping, as no signal from the metals was observed inside the perovskite cubes. It is worth to note that metal doping has been achieved so far through heating of the perovskite NC solution in the presence of metal salts.42,44 These required experimental conditions suggest that it is unlikely to occur at room temperature when mixing two NCs. Nevertheless, only Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure would provide a conclusive proof regarding the absence of any doping. Turning to the metallic NCs, Ag and Cu mostly keep their spherical shape but exhibit a broader size distribution (Fig. S4–S7 and S9†), while the faster reacting Au NCs notably sinter when mixed with the I-containing NCs, as evident by both XRD and TEM data (Fig. S4–S7†).

Lead halide perovskites are known to exhibit mobile halide anions (X−) within the crystal structure.47–49 In the case of all-inorganic perovskite NCs, such as the ones used in this study, these X− anions can shuffle in/out of the NCs by forming molecular complexes with the oxidized form of the oleylamine (OLAM) ligand, oleylammonium (OLAM+).50 This implies a certain equilibrium of X− inside and outside of the perovskite NC. Hence, we propose here that upon the introduction of the noble metals (M) into this colloidal system, following the release in solution of OLAM+X−, metal halide salts, M+X−, form while OLAM+ is reduced back to OLAM. This creates an X− concentration gradient and shifts the abovementioned equilibrium towards X− outside. As more X− leaches out of the NCs, the cubic perovskite structure starts to collapse, eventually leading to a more extensive degradation of the NCs, which occurs only for high concentration of the metals (Fig. S7†). Furthermore, while Br− is expected to be more reactive with metal ions than I−, the stability of the perovskite NCs need to be taken into account. Thus, the higher reactivity of the I-containing perovskite NCs can be rationalized by considering their intrinsic structural instability caused by the relatively larger size of I− and the strain it creates within the cubic perovskite crystal.51
In order to support our hypothesis regarding the formation of noble metal halides, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to look for changes in the chemical environment of Cu, Ag, and Au. As shown in Fig. 4, the pristine metal signals can be assigned to metallic Cu, Ag and Au without any measurable oxide contributions. All three signals shift to lower binding energies upon mixing with CsPb(BrI)3, with a shifting range of 0.2–0.8 eV. While shifts to higher binding energies are expected as one goes from a mixed Br/I halide to a Br-only composition, our observed shifts are larger and cannot be solely explained by such stoichiometric composition changes. Controversies exist in assigning M0 and M+ states, however shifts to lower binding energies have been previously linked to the formation of M+I− on similar systems.34,52 It is also worth to note that the shift becomes larger according to the following order Cu < Ag < Au, which suggests the extent of the chemical interaction between the metal and the iodide anion. Additional analysis on the Pb 4f energy range of the XPS spectra reveals shifts to higher binding energies in all of the peaks upon mixing the CsPb(BrI)3 with the metals (Fig. S10†). This change might be the result of electron density changes accompanying the profound structural transformation of the NCs.

All together, the XPS results suggest the formation of metal iodides. Hence, the observed reactivity of Cu < Ag < Au shown in Fig. 2D can be explained with the hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory. In view of this theory, a stronger interaction is expected between Au and I due to the high polarizability and to their soft Lewis acid and base character, respectively. In comparison, Cu and Ag are less polarizable and harder Lewis acids than Au, thus the interaction with I is expected to be weaker. This explanation is supported by a number of reports in literature where Cu is said to be more corrosion resistant compared to Ag in the presence of halide anions.40,53
Further adding to the mechanistic insights, it is interesting to note that: (i) XRD does not show any peak attributable to MI; (ii) in the EDX mapping, the iodine signal is distributed through the entire TEM grid, not only where the metals are; (iii) the metal size distribution becomes broader with a more drastic change for the Au which sinters. Considering these evidences, we propose a dissolution/reprecipitation mechanism wherein MI transiently form and subsequently decompose in the organic environment with the reducing OLAM redepositing M on the pristine metal NCs with I− left behind acting as a surface ligand (responsible of the observed XPS shifts) and possibly as OLAM+I−. For Au, the sintering is consistent with the phenomena referred to as “nanowelding” and extensively studied in previous work,44,54,55 which has ascribed it to the increased van der Waals forces between Au NCs upon the displacement of the native organic ligands with I−. This effect is only prevalent in Au-perovskite systems, while only minor sintering was observed for Cu and Ag, even at higher metal concentrations (Fig. S11†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, the nanoscale reaction between perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Br, BrI, I) and metal NCs of Cu, Ag and Au was studied by a number of optical, structural and compositional techniques to elucidate the mechanism in such systems. Iodide migration and leaching out of the perovskite NCs towards the metal NCs, forming metal iodides, was found to be the main driving force behind the interaction in this two-component system, ultimately leading to the degradation of the perovskite. Solid state thin films where a 100 nm hole transporting layer (spiro-OMeTAD) is interposed between the CsPb(BrI)3 and the Au NCs behaved similarly to the corresponding CsPb(BrI)3/Au NC mixed solution (Fig. S12†). While the mechanism in thin films needs further investigations, this finding suggests that the degradation results discussed above can be easily translated to a solid state device. By providing insights into the reactions between perovskite and metal NCs, this study offers guidance in the selection of contacts for optoelectronic applications involving perovskite NCs (i.e. solar cells and light emitting diodes) with Cu being preferred to Ag and Au. It also points to the need for developing novel surface chemistries and interfacial barriers on the perovskite NC surface in order to avoid effects of degradation coming from migration of halides out of the perovskite structure.

Synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals

Cesium-oleate precursor. 
In a 50 mL three-necked round bottom flask, Cs2CO3 (0.2695 g), octadecene (13.33 mL), and oleic acid (0.828 mL) were stirred under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. The flask was purged with N2 for 10 minutes and then switched under vacuum. This was repeated three times to remove moisture and O2. The flask was then heated to 150 °C under nitrogen to react the Cs2CO3 with oleic acid. The solution turned clear to indicate Cs-oleate conversion and then maintained above 100 °C to avoid precipitation at room temperature. For the CsPbI3 synthesis, 0.125 g Cs2CO3, 12.4 mL octadecene, and 0.5 mL oleic acid were used.


CsPbBr3 QDs. 
Modifications were made to a previously reported procedure by Protesescu et al.13 A 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask was charged with ODE (25 mL) and PbBr2 (0.35 g) which were subsequently stirred under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. The flask was switched to constant nitrogen flow, and oleylamine (2.5 mL) and oleic acid (2.5 mL) were injected into the mixture. The solution was maintained at this temperature until all of the salt dissolved. The temperature was raised to 160 °C. Cs-oleate (2 mL) was quickly injected into the mixture and reacted for 5 s. The reaction mixture was quenched by submersion into an ice bath and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was disposed, and the precipitate was redispersed in 1 mL hexane. To wash the nanoparticles, acetone (0.4 mL) was added to each centrifuge tube drop-wise, until the solution turned turbid, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. The nanoparticles were collected into 2 mL hexane and stored for later use.


CsPbI3 QDs. 
In an adapted procedure from Swarnkar et al.,25 PbI2 (0.7 g) and ODE (35 mL) were stirred under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h in a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The flask was switched to continuous nitrogen flow. Oleylamine (3.5 mL) and oleic acid (3.5 mL) were preheated to 70 °C and then injected into the mixture. The flask was switched to vacuum until the salt was dissolved. The temperature was raised to 170 °C under nitrogen. As-prepared Cs-OL (5.6 mL) was injected, and 5 s later, the reaction was quenched with an ice-bath. The dark red mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and then washed with 2 mL methyl acetate. The nanocrystals were stored in 2 mL of hexane.


CsPb(BrI)3 QDs. 
CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, resulting in halide exchange.

Synthesis of 10 nm metal nanospheres

10 nm copper spheres. 
Guided by a procedure from Hung et al.:56 trioctylamine (10 mL) was heated to 130 °C in a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask under nitrogen. The temperature was maintained for 30 minutes under nitrogen flow to remove water and oxygen. The flask was cooled to room temperature, and then CuOAc (0.1226 g) and TDPA (0.209 g) were added with rapid stirring. The reaction mixture was flushed with N2 and then rapidly heated to 180 °C. This temperature was maintained for 30 minutes, and then rapidly heated to 270 °C and maintained for 30 additional minutes. The flask was cooled to room temperature, and the reaction mixture was mixed with ethanol and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min to collect the product. The copper spheres were stored in hexane.


10 nm silver spheres. 
With slight modifications to a procedure from Peng et al.:57 a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask was charged with oleylamine (20 mL) and AgNO3 (170 mg) and heated to 60 °C under constant nitrogen flow to dissolve the AgNO3. Once the grains were visibly dissolved, the flask was quickly heated to 180 °C. The temperature was maintained for 1 hour at 180 °C before cooling to room temperature. The mixture was split into two centrifuge tubes, mixed with 20 mL acetone, and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was redispersed in 5 mL hexane. Washing: 5 mL of acetone was to each tube, dropwise, until the solution became turbid, followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 6000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the nanospheres were redispersed in 5 mL of hexane. Size-selective centrifugation: 3 mL of acetone were added dropwise to the nanospheres in hexane. The spheres were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and then the pellet was redispersed in 5 mL hexane. This was repeated, and the second pellet was kept for use in hexane as monodisperse 10 nm silver spheres.


10 nm gold spheres. 
1 mmol of HAuCl4·H2O and 7.5 mL oleylamine were added to 50 mL toluene in a 100 mL flask. The temperature was increased to 110 °C with rapid stirring and under nitrogen. The reaction proceeded for 1 h, turning from clear yellow to dark red, and then was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was split into two centrifuge tubes, and 25 mL ethanol was added to each, followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3 minutes. The nanoparticles were redispersed in hexane.

Preparation of perovskite/metal solutions
All the photoluminescence experiments and structural characterisation were performed with a CsPbX3 (X = Br, I, Br/I):metal (Cu, Ag, Au) NC with concentration ratio of 1:5 and in hexane, unless otherwise stated. NC concentrations were obtained by a combination of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using an Agilent model 5100 and by TEM size analysis. Typical concentrations used for mixing were ∼100 nM for CsPbX3 NCs and ∼500 nM for metal NCs. Equal volumes of both NCs solutions were then mixed in an air-tight UV quartz cuvette for the PL experiments.
Preparation of perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/metal thin films
CsPb(BrI)3 NCs were spin-coated on a glass substrate from a 500 nM 1:1 hexane:octane solution, at 1000 rpm for 45 s. Consecutively, the CsPb(BrI)3 NCs films were treated with one pulse of trimethylaluminium (TMA) in an atomic layer deposition chamber to avoid the dissolution of the NCs in the following processing steps.58 Spiro-OMeTAD (99%, Aldrich) and AuNC layers were then sequentially spin-coated, from a 30 mM chlorobenzene and 500 nM 1:1 hexane:octane solutions, respectively.
Photoluminescence
PL was measured for perovskites and metal–perovskite mixtures continuously over the course of an hour using a PerkinElmer LS55 with a xenon flash lamp. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm for mixtures or bare perovskites of CsPb(BrI)3 and CsPbBr3, and 450 nm for CsPbI3. All experiments were conducted with right-angle collection. For the solution-state kinetic experiments PL spectra were recorded as soon as the NC were mixed and then continuously for 60–70 min. For dark reaction experiments, PL was measured after mixing and setting aside the mixture for an hour. The experiments in solid state samples reported in the ESI† were performed under N2 and the PL spectra were recorded every few hours to assess the changes.
Characterization
High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) was conducted using a FEI Tecnai Osiris transmission electron microscope, which includes a high brightness X-FEG gun, silicon drift Super-X EDX detectors, and Bruker Esprit acquisition software. The microscope was used in scanning mode at a voltage of 200 kV. Samples were diluted and dropcasted onto ultra-thin carbon on Lacey support film. TEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai-Spirit at a voltage of 120 kV. ImageJ analysis was performed with sample size of 100 particles to determine average nanoparticle size and standard deviation. UV-Vis absorption measurements were conducted using a PerkinElmer Lambda Spectrophotometer with deuterium and tungsten light sources. All nanoparticles were diluted with hexane to ∼10 nM for absorption spectra. X-Ray diffractograms were acquired using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS) model with a Cu Kα source. Samples were dropcasted onto p-doped silicon substrates. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements were performed using a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe from Physical Instruments AG, Germany.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A–C) TEM images of cubic CsPbX3 NCs where X = Br, BrI, I, respectively. (D) Their corresponding photoluminescence and absorption spectra. (E–G) TEM images of spherical metal NCs of Ag, Au and Cu, respectively. (H) Their corresponding extinction spectra.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A–C) PL maps over time for the CsPb(BrI)3 NCs upon mixing with (A) Cu, (B) Ag and (C) Au NCs. The mixing was performed at the same particle concentration ratio, i.e. metal:CsPb(BrI)3 5:1. (D) Emission energy versus time for the three systems. Note: The PL intensity changes throughout the experiment, however no conclusion can be derived from them, as a number of phenomena impacts simultaneously the PL, including the compositional evolution towards a Br-rich composition, that has an inherently higher quantum yield, and the formation of transient defect states due to the halide migrations, that would result in quenching.	 

 	Fig. 3  HAADF-STEM images and their corresponding EDX analysis maps for iodine and each noble metal, after mixing (A) CsPb(BrI)3 and Cu NCs, (B) CsPb(BrI)3 and Ag NCs, (C) CsPb(BrI)3 and Au NCs.	 

 	Fig. 4  XPS spectra for (A) Cu 2p (B) Ag 3d and (C) Au 4f regions before and after mixing the metals with CsPb(BrI)3 NCs.
