    , Accepted 20th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractPhotoluminescence active amine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (af-RGO) has been synthesized at room temperature with prolonged sonication to obtain a free floating, hexagonally arranged carbon network having larger dimensions ∼(20 μm × 15 μm) in aqueous medium. The presence of amine in an RGO network has been confirmed by Raman, FTIR and photoluminescence (PL) studies. It has been used as the top layer on c-Si solar cells. Its effect on solar cell parameters was investigated. The effect of dilution (10% to 90%) of aqueous af-RGO and its coverage on c-Si solar cells leading to optimum cell parameters has been studied. The respective reflected and transmitted photon fraction through the af-RGO thin film obtained from a spectral response graph was estimated. The suitability of the synthesized material for c-Si cells has been established through different characterization supports, like height profile and the surface coverage on a polished silicon surface, analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). It was observed that the 50% diluted sample shows the best performance with respect to the baseline parameters of solar cells. An enhancement of 4.6% in short-circuit current density (JSC) and 4.8% in fill factor (FF) was achieved over the baseline parameters of the cell, while dip coating the baseline cell in the optimized dilution of af-RGO.
1. Introduction
Graphene or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has drawn attention in the field of nanoelectronics, solar cells, sensors, super-capacitors, hydrogen storage and many other fields because of its unique two-dimensional geometry with a stable hexagonally arranged atomic array of carbon with very high electrical conductivity.1–5 Graphene layers show notably high electrical conductivity6 and low reflectivity when deposited on the Si surface.7 Very low absorption with high transmittance of 96–98% in the UV-visible region and high electron mobility make them attractive as transparent electrodes in optoelectronic devices.6–9 Recently, the use of graphene layers on graphene–Si Schottky contact solar cells, perovskite solar cells, organic solar cells as well as crystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells with promising results has been reported.10–18 Although good optical transmittance and high electrical conductivity of thin graphene layers are well reported, there are limited studies on the effect of the transparent and conducting properties of the multilayered graphene structures on the front surface of planar and/or textured wafer-based crystalline silicon solar cells.14,15 An efficiency increment from 5.38% to 7.85% was observed on the deposition of graphene at the front surface of planar silicon solar cells, which further increased to 8.94% by SiO2 deposition on the surface of the graphene/Si structure.14 Improvement in the short-circuit current density (JSC) of 7.2% has also been reported to be achieved by light trapping properties of plasmonic Al nanoparticles along with wrinkle-like graphene sheets on the front surface of textured wafer-based c-Si solar cells.15 Many researchers have wet chemically functionalized RGO matrix by incorporating nitrogen-containing groups like primary amine, amide and DMF to develop n-type RGO,19–22 where intense photoluminescence has been found.23–26 W. Zhu et al. has shown that how efficiently photoluminescence conversion has been engineered in solar cell structures to extract an enhanced output.27
In this study, we have investigated the variations of photovoltaic parameters and spectral responses due to the application of multilayer n-doped graphene structures on the front surface of a standard textured c-Si solar cell. Graphene synthesis has been performed by Hummer's method11,12 including simultaneous oxidation and reduction assisted by long-time high-energy ultrasonication to obtain a freely suspended large planar sheet of RGO. Prolonged time has been given during reduction by hydrazine hydrate to incorporate the amine group into the RGO network to develop amine-functionalized RGO (af-RGO). The synthesized material (n-type RGO) is diluted with DI water (18 MΩ) at different concentrations to study the photon transmission through the graphene layers and effective reflection benefit from the surface of the textured c-Si wafer. Photoluminescence of the doped af-RGO has been utilized in a novel approach to harvest high-energy photons. Raman spectral studies, FTIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy have been carried out to confirm the presence of doped af-RGO in the synthesized solution. The synthesized material with different dilutions has been scrutinized by AFM and FESEM to obtain the best coverage of a planar sheet of af-RGO on the top surface of the solar cells by the controlled dip coating technique. The internal quantum efficiency, front surface series resistance and surface passivating properties have been successfully analyzed leading to an enhancement of JSC from 33.28 mA cm−2 to 34.81 mA cm−2 and a fill factor from 72.84% to 76.31% over the baseline solar cell of area 3′′ × 3′′.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals used
Graphite powder of 25 μm diameter (Laboratory Burgoyne Reagents), 98% sulphuric acid (Merck, Emplura), potassium permanganate (Merck), 30% hydrogen peroxide (Merck), hydrochloric acid (Merck, Emplura) and hydrazine hydrate (Sigma Aldrich) were used, as procured, without further purification.
2.2. Amine-terminated graphene (af-RGO) synthesis
2 g of graphite powder has been taken in a 250 ml beaker containing 46 ml of 98% sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and stirred vigorously for ∼2 hours. 6 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was added slowly and the solution was stirred for 30 min at a temperature below 20 °C. A shiny black mixture was obtained, which was stirred for another 2 hours at room temperature for getting a homogeneous suspension to avoid agglomeration. A thick brownish black colloidal solution was obtained. Then 50 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is added and stirred for 1 hour. The graphene oxide solution thus obtained may contain metal traces as impurities, which was eliminated by adding diluted HCl. Then the solution was repeatedly washed with de-ionized (DI) water to obtain bright brownish yellow graphene oxide (GO).11 The synthesized solution was filtered and dried at 50 °C under vacuum to obtain brown coloured GO powder. GO powder is then weighted and diluted with 100 ml of DI water to make the density of the solution 50 μg ml−1 and sonicated for 15 min to get a homogenous suspension. Then the solution was mixed with 20% hydrazine hydrate12 and stirred for ∼12 hours to obtain black paste-like af-RGO.26 The synthesized solution was kept for ∼48 hours, so that precipitation and liquid portions may separate out. A blackish soft precipitate is then collected as af-RGO with 50 μg ml−1 concentration. This solution is kept for further use as a standard as-synthesized solution of af-RGO.
2.3. Material characterization measurement of af-RGO
In order to investigate the presence of af-RGO in the synthesized solution, Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia with a laser line of 514 nm), FTIR (Perkin Elmer, L1600400 Spectrum TWO DTGS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (QM-40, Photon Technology International, PTI) have been carried out to confirm the n-type doping of the RGO achieved by the effect of edge termination of the RGO network by primary amine. The explanation of the material characterization has been discussed in the Results and discussion section. Further support of amine termination and n-doping has been validated by the drop test and the thermoelectric test, respectively, in the ESI.†
2.4. Preparation of dilution based af-RGO samples
DI water has been added to the as-synthesized aqueous af-RGO to make the solution 100%. 10 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, 70 ml and 90 ml of DI water were added to the rest of the as-synthesized aqueous af-RGO solution to make the solution 100 ml (henceforth labeled as S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5, respectively). Concentrations of S1 (90% af-RGO + 10% DI water), S2 (70% af-RGO + 30% DI water), S3 (50% af-RGO + 50% DI water), S4 (30% af-RGO + 70% DI water) and S5 (10% af-RGO + 90% DI water) are 44.87 μg ml−1, 35.04 μg ml−1, 25.12 μg ml−1, 14.91 μg ml−1 and 5.01 μg ml−1, measured by the density measurement technique.
2.5. Solar cell fabrication
Solar cells are fabricated following a standard procedure using p-type boron-doped crystalline silicon (p-type 〈100〉 CZ) wafers (thickness: 180 μm and resistivity 1–2 ohm cm). After saw damage removal by a chemical process, texturization was done by using 2% NaOH and 5% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at 80 °C for 40 min by passing N2 gas through the solution. A conventional POCl3 diffusion was then done at 850 °C in a diffusion furnace (SVCS-SVFUR-AH3) for the formation of the n+ layer followed by Phospho-Silicate Glass (PSG) removal by dipping the wafers in 2% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. Subsequently, the SiN layer of 75 nm was deposited on the n+ layer in the PECVD (HHV PECVD Cluster tool CT 100) chamber. The wafers were now cut into 3′′ × 3′′ dimensions using a laser scriber (Argus YAG laser). After edge isolation by reactive ion etching (RIE), fingers and busbar were screen printed (HORIZON 03Xi) on the front surface by silver paste and screen printing of an aluminum layer on the rear and subsequent drying and firing in an industrial-type conveyor belt 3-zone furnace (HENGLI) to form the rear p-contact. Two separate screen printers each for front and back contacts were used to avoid contamination of the cells. Drying furnaces for drying the pastes at 275 °C for 90 s and a firing furnace (HENGLI) for co-firing at 850 °C for 45 s have been used as the standard firing temperature profile. The width of the silver finger (100 μm) busbar (3000 μm) and the inter-finger spacing (2800 μm) on the front surface were kept optimized and standard as per the reported values.28,29
2.6. Application of af-RGO solar cells
The different af-RGO solutions (S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5) were applied at the end of the cell fabrication process. All the substrates (glass, polished silicon wafer, textured wafers and solar cell) in this experiment were dip coated in desired solutions. The coating technique consists of the following three distinct steps: (i) substrates were dipped into the solution perpendicular to the base of the container with a speed of 0.5 mm s−1 (lengthwise), (ii) substrates kept for 60 s inside the solution and (iii) substrates were taken out perpendicular to the container base with a speed of 0.25 mm s−1 (lengthwise). No additional process has been performed to remove af-RGO from the metal contacts (finger and busbar) during the coating of RGO on complete silicon solar cells as the conductance of RGO layers is better/comparable to silver30 (finger and the busbar printing material), producing no offset in conductivity while collecting a photogenerated carrier during the time of contact type measurements like I–V and EQE. In order to investigate the possible formation of bi/tri-layered graphene and its area coverage due to the coating of af-RGO samples having different dilutions with water on polished and textured silicon wafer substrates, AFM (NT-MDT: Model No. 50BM-4) micrographs have been analyzed and the FESEM (Zeiss: Sl. No. SIGMA-02-87) micrograph has been presented to validate the same. Diluted af-RGO (with DI water) in different volume fractions was coated on c-Si solar cells and dried in a vacuum. Dark and light (1 Sun: AM1.5G) current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of coated and uncoated solar cells were tested using the I–V tool (PET: Photo Emission Tech. Inc.; Model 60623). Reflectance and transmittance studies, and external and internal quantum efficiencies (EQE and IQE) were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu; SolidSpec-3700) and a Bentham PVE 300. The results (reflection, transmittance, JSC–V, EQE and IQE) of before and after coating af-RGO on solar cells are tabulated, compared and discussed analytically in a comprehensive approach in the Discussion section.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the synthesized af-RGO layers
A cleaned glass substrate was dip coated in as-synthesized af-RGO solution and air-dried in desiccators for Raman spectroscopic studies with a laser excitation wavelength of 515 nm (2.41 eV) and the G′-band is investigated as a function of thickness of the graphene layers and is presented in Fig. 1. Each of the de-convoluted Raman spectra shows two peaks: a disorder-induced (D) band and a tangential (G) band. The G band is usually assigned to the E2g phonon of an sp2 carbon atom, while the D band is a breathing mode of κ-point phonons of A1g symmetry. Two distinct peaks at 1335 cm−1 and 1603 cm−1 (Fig. 1) correspond to D and G bands for GO. D and G peaks have shifted to 1328 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 due to the reduction of GO.
 Fig. 1  Raman micrographs with characteristic D and G peaks of synthesized graphene oxide and graphene thin film along with that of a glass substrate. 
Shifting of the G peak in lower frequency confirms the insertion of the electron-donor group (electron doping) in the af-RGO matrix.19 Insertion of a primary amine or an amine-conjugated benzene ring (aniline) as the edge-terminated doping entity shifts the Fermi energy by softening of phonons, causing an increment in carrier mobility. Doping entities bind the core RGO network through π–π interaction.20 The intensity ratio of the D to G band (ID/IG) in af-RGO is found to be 1.54, and in GO this is about 0.87.21 The comparison shows a decrease in the average size of the sp2 domain due to the reduction process. Here the intensity ratio indicates the presence of 2–3 layers of graphene,21 which is further examined by the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies.
The FTIR test has been conducted in transmission mode within a wavelength range of 500 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. It is perceptible from Fig. 2 that the hydroxyl group has been inserted due to the oxidation of graphite powder and the corresponding small sharp peak at 984 cm−1 (due to the O–H bend) and the broad strong peak, with the centre at 344 cm−1 (due to O–H stretch and/or O–H bend), have been found, which is proof of the presence of hydroxyl moieties. Another crucial oxygen group (O) has been incorporated during oxidation. Mostly, the basal plane and the edge of the graphitic plane took part during oxidation, which supports a small blunted peak at 1735 cm−1. One more peak due to aliphatic C–C stretch at 1612 cm−1 signifies that the introduction of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms is proof of attachment of oxygen at the basal plane of the graphitic plane.
 Fig. 2  FTIR analysis of synthesized solution within the range of 500 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 in transmission mode. 
During the general reduction of graphene oxide (presented by a blue line), the hydroxyl peaks (984 cm−1 and 3441 cm−1) and the oxygen peak (1735 cm−1) disappeared, which elucidates the transformation of sp3 to sp2 (C–C) hybridization. In our case, we have incorporated amine as an edge-terminated shell functional group with an RGO core. The reduction of GO took place due to the addition of hydrazine hydrate, and in the same solution, the evolved ammonia (by-product of hydrazine hydrate) is the source of primary amine, which is being attached with the RGO matrix. The orange line shows that the oxygen (1735 cm−1) and hydroxyl (984 cm−1 and 3441 cm−1) groups have been removed elucidating the complete reduction of GO, and the insertion of the amine group by the nucleophilic substitution of an unreacted hydroxyl group at the edge of the RGO further confirms the presence of peaks at 1008 cm−1 (C–N stretch), 1639 cm−1 (N–H bend while substituting the oxygen group by primary amine) and 3295 cm−1 (N–H stretch), which matched with the FTIR data analysis done by K.-Jing Huang et al.22 The drop test given in ESI,† shows that the hydrophilic nature is attained by GO (Fig. S1a) due to the hydroxyl group and ionized oxygen moieties, attached to the unsaturated bond of the carbon by weak bond strength.
Functionalization due to the insertion of a primary amine (Fig. S1b, ESI†) in the network (mainly at the terminating edges) by removing the hydroxyl group from the matrix offering more hydrophobicity than GO and more hydrophilicity than unfunctionalized RGO (Fig. S1c, ESI†) due to the insertion of the least number of amine groups at the basal plane.3
The synthesized material with edge-terminated amine functionalization as a shell in the graphene matrix and the unfunctionalized graphene network as a core exhibits an intense bright visible photoluminescence when exposed under UV excitation of wavelengths of 250 nm, 300 nm and 350 nm and their corresponding emission peaks have been observed within the range of 420 nm to 450 nm, supporting a prominent red shift in photon energy (Fig. 3). Chemical modification of the graphene nanostructure supports an effective orbital resonance of amine moieties with the graphene core allowing a significant modification in its electronic properties. Due to the insertion of the amine group in epoxy or with hydrogen in the RGO matrix, the amine-bonded carbon atoms can be treated as the effective recombination centres.31–33 The emission peaks of RGO lie within ∼412 nm to ∼416 nm when exposed under the laser line of 250 nm to 350 nm. The blue emission which is almost independent of excitation was observed,32,34–36 and hence is attributed to the π–π* transition of CC and δ–π* recombination of CO/C–O–NH2.32,34–36 The electronic transition at localized sp3 dominating clusters leads to the photoluminescence spectra.33
 Fig. 3  Photoluminescence spectra of an af-RGO layer illuminated under light with wavelengths of 250 nm, 300 nm, 350 nm and 400 nm. 
The luminescence of as-synthesized af-RGO shows an emission at ∼415 nm, when exposed to a UV lamp, as shown in Fig. 3. The photoluminescence of the af-RGO depends upon the size, shape, the degree of functionalization and the position of functionalization (whether edge-terminated or basal plane attachment). According to the FTIR data presented in this paper, edge-terminated amine insertion is accountable for the emission in the blue region. This photoluminescence occurs due to the incorporation of defects in the basal graphitic plane, the size confinement effect and the decrease in the size of the in-plane sp2 domains. The emission intensity of 415 nm at 350 nm excitation wavelength energy is noticeable compared to 250 nm and 300 nm wavelength illumination.23–25
3.2. Number of layers and coverage optimization of af-RGO
Polished silicon wafers were dipped into an aqueous suspension of exfoliated af-RGO with various dilutions (S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5) and characterized using an atomic force microscope (NT-MDT) in semi-contact/tapping mode (Fig. 4). We used the AFM tip that is able to measure the thickness in the order of a few nanometers in semi-contact mode.37,38 The layer thickness of the synthesized material has been investigated by height profile (Fig. 4 (column b)) studies derived from the AFM micrograph (Fig. 4 (column a)), where the colour bar has been examined to elucidate the height contour of layers and section profile images of different af-RGO structures. The colour scale of the scheme indicates that the thickness of the layer is around 2 nm corresponding to the formation of bi/tri-layered af-RGO. From the AFM micrograph it can be seen that, with the increase in dilution percentage, the area coverage of the af-RGO film on the silicon surface is decreased, as the degree of agglomeration of the bi/tri-layered af-RGO decreases accordingly.
 Fig. 4  Columns a–d exhibit the corresponding AFM micrograph, height profile, schematic presentation and surface coverage details of the row-wise samples, respectively. Blue and red dots in the schemes (column c) represent the agglomerated af-RGO and bi/tri-layered planar af-RGO of different dilutions. Rows A–C present the detailed information of S1 (90% af-RGO + 10% DI water), S3 (50% af-RGO + 50% DI water) and S5 (10% af-RGO + 90% DI water) coated samples, respectively. 
It is noticeable that the height profile shows a variation from 2 nm to 4 nm, whereas the surface coverage is the highest, i.e. 93% (Fig. 4 (row A)) for the S1 sample, out of which 63.9% surface area is covered by non-agglomerated planar bi/tri-layered af-RGO and the rest is agglomerated bi/tri-layered af-RGO. In contrast, sample S5 shows that the height variation is restricted from 0 nm to 2 nm having the least surface coverage (68.4%), out of which 65.45% surface area is covered by non-agglomerated (planner) bi/tri-layered af-RGO and the rest is agglomerated bi/tri-layered af-RGO (Fig. 4 (row C)). The height variation gradually decreases with increasing dilution percentage leading to a decrease in surface coverage on the silicon substrate (shown in Fig. 4 (columns a and b)).
The dimensions of the af-RGO layers were about 2 μm × 2 μm and were mostly uniform in nature with an average height of 2 nm for sample S3 on polished silicon. In this sample, the optimized dilution af-RGO layers attained a uniform height (Fig. 4 (row B (columns a and b))) of the surface coverage area of 89.7%, out of which ∼80% is covered by the non-agglomerated bi/tri-layered planar af-RGO (Fig. 4 (row B (columns c and d))). It was observed that up to 30% dilution, the film thickness was more or less of the order of 4 nm while for higher dilutions (50–90%), the film thickness reduced to about 2 nm corresponding to 2–3 layered graphene (Fig. 4 (columns a and b)). For 50% dilution, the non-agglomerated graphene area is the highest while the thickness of the layer is lower (∼2 nm) compared to the other dilutions.

Fig. 5 shows the FESEM micrograph of uncoated and graphene-coated textured silicon surfaces for different dilutions (viz., S1, S3 and S5 samples) of planar and tilted surfaces. Tilted FESEM images on the textured silicon surface revealed the edges and surfaces of pyramids. It can be observed that as the dilution increases, the coverage also decreases and at the same time agglomeration also decrease. However, there is saturation of this coverage area increment behaviour. For sample S3, it is observed that the af-RGO layers are distributed uniformly over the silicon surface almost conformal along with some wrinkles and some conglomerations at a few places. In Fig. 5, uniformity of the af-RGO layers has been found to be improved with dilution but optimized with sample S3 (50% af-RGO + 50% DI water), which also bears an excellent agreement with the AFM analysis, discussed previously. The tilted view of the same micrographs reveals that each of the open surfaces of the pyramids is covered by af-RGO uniformly, but the shapes of the pyramids are clearly visible through the af-RGO network. Lowest coverage is revealed for sample S5 as shown in Fig. 5d, which is also shown in the schematic presentation in Fig. 5b, depicting that most of the pyramid surface remains uncovered by the af-RGO.

The left part showing the planar view and the right part displays the tilted view of the same sample. (a) Showing the bare textured silicon wafer (b–d) showing the layer fashion after depositing S1, S3 and S5 on bare textured silicon wafer. 
The total surface coverage due to the coating of af-RGO solution consists of two kinds of layer distributions, which are agglomerated af-RGO and bi/tri-layered non-agglomerated (planner) af-RGO. Each of the diluted solutions is sonicated in a probe sonicator for 30 minutes, allowing the agglomerated af-RGO to open up and be flattened in nature. Fig. 6 depicts the total covered area by af-RGO (both agglomerated and planar bi/tri-layered af-RGO) variation of percentage area with respect to dilution variation of the synthesized samples. With the increment of the dilution, the concentration of af-RGO in the solution reduces which provides a free space in the aqueous medium where agglomeration opened up avoiding further overstacking on the separate adjacent opened bi/tri-layered planar af-RGO matrix in the solution. In this work, we have optimized the concentration of the af-RGO in the aqueous medium by diluting the basic as-synthesized af-RGO solution with de-ionized water. The dilution (concentration) has been engineered in such a way so that the optimized space is offered to the agglomerated af-RGO to open up into a flat layer but avoiding an overstacking on the adjacent flattened and planar af-RGO matrix; this is because of its potential use in solar cells as the layer structure of the af-RGO should be planar in nature, so that light can pass through the layer without much scattering.
 Fig. 6  Percentage of area coverage of different layer distributions of af-RGO against variation of dilution, measured on a polished silicon surface. 
From Fig. 6 it is clear that with the increment of aqueous dilution, surface coverage increases and agglomeration decreases, although this dilution effect has a saturation level. Sample ‘S3’ (with 50% graphene concentration) has been optimized as the best surface coverage with the lowest agglomeration, best suited for solar cell applications on the front surface. These observations are also supported by AFM and FESEM studies. The surface coverage study was made using the image processing software, where the uncovered area, the agglomerated af-RGO area and the bi/tri-layered planar af-RGO areas are separately calculated for each of the image keeping the threshold identical in each case.39 We have scanned the top surface of the af-RGO coated substrate using AFM in semi-contact mode for an area of 10 μm × 10 μm. The AFM micrograph has been exported to image analyzing software ImageJ. Three distinct regions of the images have been identified corresponding to the (i) uncovered area, (ii) planner RGO covered area and (iii) agglomerated RGO covered area. The region-wise area has been calculated using ImageJ software by setting a suitable threshold for the different regions (Fig. S2, ESI†).
3.3. Optical properties of the material for application in solar cells
For the application of graphene on c-Si solar cells, the layer should have the criteria for minimum possible optical absorption and the property of reduced reflectivity on the front surface, a combination of which may make the layer suitable for enhanced injection of incident photons into the solar cells. In order to test any unwanted absorption by the graphene layers, the absorption spectra of the layers deposited on glass were examined by using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.

Fig. 7 shows the percent transmittance of light through the graphene layer on glass for different dilutions of samples (viz., S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5). It is to be noted from Fig. 7 that there are insignificant changes in the transmission of photons through the glass substrate in the wavelength range of 350–1100 nm on the coating of af-RGO with different dilutions in the range of 50% to 90% and thus suitable for solar cell applications on the front surface. However, af-RGO layers become perceptibly absorbing with lesser dilution. These results are also in conformity with the observations reported in the literature,17 where it has been shown that graphene appears to be a transparent electrode material for few layers, while thicker graphene structures may not be suitable due to a non-negligible absorption in the layers.
 Fig. 7  Transmittance curves of graphene on glass for different dilutions. 
Dilution less than 50% shows that the transmittance is hindered due to the presence of agglomerated bi- and/or tri-layered graphene. With the increment of graphene layer thickness, the agglomeration present in the matrix hinders the photons to be injected into the active shallow emitter n+ layer of the solar cell by absorbing photon by the graphene matrix itself. Thus, samples S1 and S2 cannot be used as the potential additional anti-reflecting coating (ARC). In terms of the front surface ARC, S3, S4 and S5 can be used in scrutinizing the transmittance fraction, which are 0.9783, 0.9847 and 0.9907, respectively, and also comparable to the uncoated glass.
To explore the suitability of graphene layers as an additional coating on Si3N4 coated textured silicon for further enhancement of photon transmission into the active silicon, reflectance measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 8. It is observed that the reflectance decreases, in general, upon application of an af-RGO coating on the Si3N4 coated textured silicon surface for every dilution. The decrease appears to be more prominent in the lower wavelength region of 300–400 nm. However, it is to be noted that although there is a decrease in reflection for dilutions below 50%, because of the larger fraction of absorption loss in the af-RGO material. 10% and 23% of absorption loss are observed in the af-RGO material for 30% dilution (S2) and 10% dilution (S1), respectively, as shown in Fig. 7, which depicts the lower photon transmission in spite of the reduced reflection and are not suitable for front surface applications on silicon solar cells.
 Fig. 8  Percent reflectance as a function of wavelength of silicon nitride AR-coated textured Si and the same with af-RGO coating of different dilutions. 
However, the dilutions of 50% (S3), 70% (S4) and 90% (S5) show negligible absorption fractions in the af-RGO layer, which are 0.02, 0.013 and 0.007, respectively. The integrated fraction of injected photons for different dilutions has been calculated using eqn (1) for dilutions in the range of 90–50%, since there is no perceptible photon loss due to absorption in the af-RGO layer for these dilutions: (1)where R(λ) is the reflectance at the wavelength λ, and N0(λ)dλ is the number of photons in the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. The total number of photons of AM 1.5G in the range of 300–1100 nm is calculated to be 2.46 × 1017 cm−2 s−1.
Integrated fractions as calculated from the reflectance curves are found to be 10.71%, 9.47%, 8.23% and 6.76%, respectively, for the uncoated surface and the af-RGO coated surface with 90%, 70% and 50% dilutions, respectively. The increase in the transmission of photons compared to uncoated cells for 50% af-RGO dilution is 2.05% which, in terms of the number of photons, is calculated as 5.04 × 1015 cm−2 s−1. Considering that all the photons are collected (unit internal quantum efficiency), the photo-generated current density would be maximally enhanced by 0.9 mA cm−2 due to enhanced photon injection into the af-RGO layer coating on SiNx coated textured silicon solar cells.
3.4. Electrical properties of the material
One additional beneficial effect of the af-RGO layer on the front surface of solar cells may be the decrease of series resistance due to high conductivity of the layers. This decrease may be due to the conducting paths provided by the graphene layers. This has been examined by depositing af-RGO layers with different dilutions on a glass substrate and measuring the sheet resistance of the layers. For this purpose, the resistance of the graphene layers of dimensions 175 μm and 7.5 μm was measured for a gap of 175 μm between two silver electrodes. The resistivity of the layers for dilutions in the range of 90–50% has been estimated to be in the range of 1.002 × 10−8 Ω cm, which is lower than that of the front silver sheet resistance of silicon solar cells. The calculated electrical loss due to the af-RGO layer shows a decrease from 8.64% to 3.88% due to the application of af-RGO, assuming interconnected electrical lines between the silver finger lines on the front surface of the cells. This points to the fact that the af-RGO layer may effectively reduce the sheet resistance of the front surface leading to an enhanced fill factor of the cells.
3.5. Electrical effect on solar cells
The J–V behaviour (current density vs. voltage characteristics) of graphene on silicon nitride AR-coated textured silicon solar cell structures was obtained to study the solar cell performance enhancements. The results were then analyzed to find out changes in the cell parameters (open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), maximum power output (PM), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η)) as well as that of series and shunt resistances and the reverse saturation current densities in the two-diode model (J01 and J02) due to graphene applications. Fig. 9a shows the J–V characteristics of the silicon solar cells having a graphene layer with 50% dilution. The measurement has been done under the source of AM1.5G, where the incident power is 100 mA cm−2. It is observed that the JSC increased from 33.28 mA cm−2 to 34.81 mA cm−2 due to higher photon injection in the active silicon layer producing higher electron–hole pair generation. The fill factor has also been increased from 72.84% to 76.31% upon application of af-RGO on c-Si solar cells due to the interconnections in between the fingers contributing to the better collection of holes. These two benefits (higher electron–hole pair generation and the betterment of the fill factor) essentially offer the enhancement to attain a better efficiency fraction upon coating sample S3 on c-Si solar cells. The maximum power PM is enhanced from 295 mW to 327 mW, resulting in betterment in efficiency, which is in good agreement with the benefits attained by the solar cells due to dip coating it in af-RGO, as shown in Table 1. The solar cell measurements have been carried out to scrutinize the effect of three different solutions (S5, S4 and S3) on three different solar cells having baseline values close to each other.

Fig. 9b and c shows the devices before and after dip coating in af-RGO solution (S3) while Fig. 9d and e shows the af-RGO under UV and visible light exposure. Under UV exposure, a blue emission can be noticed, ensuring af-RGO as a photoluminescent active potential optical material. Table 1 also shows the measured cell parameters for uncoated and coated cells with non-absorbing af-RGO for dilutions in the range of 90–50% (S5, S4 and S3 samples) showing the improvements due to the coating of the af-RGO layer. It is observed that JSC is increased gradually as the percentage of af-RGO increased in the solution and as the non-agglomerated conformal layer increased gradually, which enable to cultivate higher photo-converted current density.

Fig. 10 shows the enhancement of solar cell parameters with respect to short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η) of the af-RGO front-coated solar cell with different dilutions (from 50% to 90%). From Fig. 10(a) it can be seen that with the increment of af-RGO percentage in the solution, the percentage enhancement values of JSC are 0.893% (from 33.14 mA cm−2 to 33.43 mA cm−2), 1.185% (from 33.28 mA cm−2 to 33.68 mA cm−2) and 4.593% (from 33.28 mA cm−2 to 34.81 mA cm−2) for 90% (S5), 70% (S4) and 50% (S3) diluted samples, respectively, which are in good agreement with the values given in Table 1.
 Fig. 10  Enhancements of (a) JSC, (b) FF, (c) efficiency, (d) PM and (e) VOC of af-RGO coated solar cells with different dilutions over uncoated solar cells. 
With the betterment of layer coverage, the interconnections between fingers attain better ease for the carriers and the equivalent resistance of the finger is minimized, causing better collection, which reflects an increment in the FF percentage as shown in Fig. 10(b) such as 1.405% (from 73.30% to 74.33%), 1.332% (from 72.84% to 73.81%) and 4.764% (from 72.84% to 76.31%) for 90% (S5), 70% (S4) and 50% diluted solutions, respectively, supporting the data given in Table 1. Accumulating both the properties, in terms of integrated photon injection and series resistance minimization, efficiency obtained due to the coating of the 90% (S5), 70% (S4) and 50% (S3) diluted solutions on c-Si solar cells (Table 1) depicts the percentage enhancements which are 2.3% (from 14.74% to 15.08%), 3.16% (from 14.55% to 15.01%) and 10.65% (from 14.55% to 16.10%), respectively, as shown in Fig. 10(c), and shows the same trend as ISC and FF. Maximum power (PM) has noticeably increased from 295 mW to 327.6 mW after applying S3 (50% diluted af-RGO) on solar cells, as shown in Fig. 10(d). No significant changes have been noticed in VOC after incorporating af-RGO into solar cells, as shown in Fig. 10(e). Table 2 shows the derived cell parameters for uncoated and coated cells with non-absorbing graphene for dilutions in the range of 90–50% by fitting two diode model tool in Matlab. It can be noticed that there is a larger increase in the short-circuit current density on graphene deposition onto Si3N4 AR-coated textured Si solar cells compared to that may have been caused by the decrease in reflectance after graphene deposition.

In order to check the reproducibility of the enhancement due to the incorporation of the af-RGO as the top optically active potential layer, we have dip coated the solar cell of area 3′′ × 3′′ in the optimised af-RGO solution (S3) with the same dipping parameters under the same conditions and it was found to be 66% repetitive in terms of solar cell parameters, which matched with the best enhanced data presented in Table 1 for the S3 coated solar cell. We have measured the solar cell parameters of fifteen S3 coated solar cells of equal area with baseline parameters close to each other. The respective solar cell parameters (JSC, FF and efficiency) measured under AM1.5G is presented as statistical bar diagrams in Fig. 11a–c, respectively.
 Fig. 11  (a–c) Showing the statistical record of the JSC, FF and efficiency of all the measured fifteen solar cells. 
It is found that the statistical data of JSC, FF and efficiency from Fig. 11a–c claimed to be close to the JSC (34.81 mA cm−2), FF (76.31%) and efficiency (16.10%) of the S3 coated solar cell stated in Table 1. Solar cell parameters of ten cells out of fifteen cells exhibited a close match with the data for S3 coated cells in Table 1. It is also observable that one cell stood with higher values of solar cell parameters than those reported as the best in Table 1 with S3 coating, but these data have been found for one cell only out of fifteen cells, owing to which we have claimed that the mostly repeatable solar parameters are the best enhanced data with high repeatability.
In order to check the stability of uncoated and af-RGO coated solar cells under the continuous illumination of AM1.5G for 88 hours, the I–V characteristics have been recorded at an equal interval of 8 hours. The efficiency has been calculated and plotted as a function of time (Fig. 12a). We have found a negligibly small (of the order of 0.2% of the original) decrease in efficiency for both the coated and uncoated solar cells.
 Fig. 12  (a) Comparative representation of efficiency of uncoated and RGO coated solar cells under the illumination of AM1.5G. (b) Transport fashion of photogenerated carriers through the af-RGO matrix. 
The visible wavelength regime (∼400 nm to ∼700 nm) is the most crucial, within which the solar cells harvest utmost energy for the generation of electron–hole pairs. At a lower wavelength, an excess energy higher than the band gap energy of silicon accounted for the loss of energy as phonons, responsible for the solar cell heating. The af-RGO layer has successfully converted the spectrum ranging from 250 nm to 350 nm with an efficient light harvest at ∼415 nm. In this circumstance, the photons (∼250 nm to ∼350 nm) absorbed by the af-RGO layers placed on top of the cell red shift around the blue region, thus contributing a maximum number of photons in the visible region producing utmost generation of the electron–hole pairs over the number of generated electron–hole pairs due to the irradiance under AM1.5G. The photons of the ultraviolet region are absorbed by the top region of the solar cells and produce electron–hole pairs, out of which a significant number of holes recombine near the surface of the solar cells. In our coated cells, this surface recombination is suppressed by the photoluminescence benefit of the synthesized af-RGO as a fraction of the UV wavelength (∼200 nm to ∼350 nm) passing through the af-RGO matrix absorbed by the af-RGO matrix gets re-emitted as a light of wavelength ∼415 nm, which is absorbed by solar cells quiet far beneath the surface causing the same number of electron–hole pair generation avoiding a significant hole recombination loss at the surface. Delicately the photon harvest has been maximized to put in more active photo-current generation using this above-mentioned engineering known as PL conversion.
The possible reasons for the enhancement of JSC and FF would be (i) the decrease of series resistance, (ii) reduction of the effective recombination at the front surface due to graphene deposition and (iii) improvement of IQE caused by the scattering by the graphene layer.14 The series resistance (RS), shown in Table 2, shows that with the increment of af-RGO percentage in the solution reduces the series resistance significantly. Series resistance is a summation of the (i) resistance of the silver finger and busbar connection, (ii) resistance between the metal contact and silicon, and (iii) resistance offered through the emitter and base of the solar cell while the photo-generated carriers are being collected. Due to the application of a thin layer of RGO on top of the solar cell, the effective resistance of the top metal contact gets reduced resulting in reducing the series resistance. The coated RGO layer offers a set of alternative parallel low-resistive diagonal short channels between the busbar and the fingers. These parallel channels, represented by red solid arrowhead lines (shown in Fig. 12b), provide a shorter path to the carriers resulting in a smaller series resistance than that of the uncoated solar cell. With the reduction in the series resistance, collections of carriers are being achieved with greater ease. Reverse saturation current density (J01) acquaint with the recombination current density under dark conditions, which suggest the sturdy connection of attaining a mere overview of VOC. With the increment of af-RGO percentage in the solution, the J01 decreases insignificantly as shown in Table 2, reflecting an insignificant benefit incorporating in this case.
Transparent Conducting Electrode (TCE) and Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) like Tin-doped Indium Oxide (ITO) are also widely used in the solar cell structure as top electrode materials, but they have the following limitations. (i) They are brittle in nature,40 (ii) the absorption is ∼15% in the solar spectrum (200–1100 nm)40,41 for a typical layer of 90 nm thickness, (iii) the sheet resistance of ITO used as top contact is ∼50 Ω □−1, and (iv) the production cost of ITO is high in terms of industrial applications.41 On the other hand, material strength of RGO is superior to that of ITO.30,42 RGO is highly transparent (∼97%)8 in the solar regime. It is also very beneficial in terms of sheet resistance (the sheet resistance may go down to 0.11 Ω □−142–44). Moreover, RGO can be processed easily in the lab and industry with considerably small material cost.42
To elucidate the function of graphene layer(s) as a front surface coating on AR-coated c-Si solar cells, a schematic illustration is presented in Fig. 13, which depicts the machinery of solar photon collection (mainly in the visible region) through af-RGO. The actual image (FESEM micrograph) of such graphene-coated solar cells also presents the uniform af-RGO coating on the textured pyramidal surface. The electric field developed at the interface between graphene and the emitter layer may help in the reduction of effective recombination velocity at the front surface causing a decrease in the reverse saturation current density and hence an increase in the open-circuit voltage. The nature of graphene (n-type or p-type) is reported to depend on the synthesis methodology and other surface conditions like adsorbed molecules, etc.3,19–21 In order to investigate the doping type of the synthesized af-RGO, a thermoelectric test has been performed, which confirms that the af-RGO is n-type in nature (Fig. SI3, ESI†).
 Fig. 13  Schematic representation of the graphene layer on ARC c-Si solar cells along with the actual image (FESEM). 
The betterment in the reverse saturation current density (J01) is detectable from Table 2. Experimentally obtained I–V data of three samples (S5, S4 and S3) of coated solar cells, taken under the illumination of AM1.5G, have been fitted with the two-diode model and their reverse saturation current density (J01), diffusion current density (J02), series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSh) have been obtained. With the increase of the dilution of af-RGO, it is noticeable that J01 has been weakened. A noteworthy benefit is being extracted from the table and it is also convincing that after applying af-RGO, a notable reduction in J01 from 1.7049 × 10−14 mA cm−2 to 6.751 × 10−15 mA cm−2 is observed, elucidating the diminishing recombination process inside the active layer. A sturdy effect can be found in terms of RS, as the collection of carriers from the top surface of the solar cell intensely depends upon RS. Lesser RS supports better carrier collection and strongly affects the FF of the cell. The application of af-RGO with higher dilution does not affect the series resistance much (from Table 2). With the highest dilution (S5), RS changed from 1.293 Ω cm2 to 1.12 Ω cm2, whereas with lesser dilution (50%), RS shows a noteworthy benefit as the series resistance reduced to 0.796 Ω cm2 from 1.333 Ω cm2, and provides better carrier collection which in turn improves the FF. J02 is the measure of the number of minority carriers that diffuse into the barrier under dark conditions and states the potential of the barrier height of the junction. It is convincing that the solar cell coated with S3 solution shows the better results in this regard. The application of n-type af-RGO on the n+ emitter improved the strength of the electric field. The negative nature of n-type af-RGO produces an electric field in SiNx which further produces a strong electric field where electrons get collected at its base (considering up-side down), which boosts up the negative charge accumulation at the base of the emitter producing a strong electric field at the junction.
Due to this, holes are being collected at the top of the p-type active silicon layer; recombination due to minority carriers starts diminishing as the barrier potential becomes stronger in nature. It is seen experimentally that the open-circuit voltage is not enhanced significantly which may be caused by the reduction of the effective recombination velocity at the front surface. The observations suggest that no significant reduction in surface recombination velocity is produced by the graphene–emitter interface, and this is also corroborated by insignificant changes in the reverse saturation current densities upon graphene deposition. One of the major reasons for enhancement in JSC and the FF appears to arise from the significant reduction in the front surface series resistance. The series resistance for all cells in the range of 90–50% dilution with water has been observed to decrease (Table 2). Earlier, wrinkles in the front surface layers may cause scattering of the incident photons into the underlying active silicon layer.15,18 The IQE of the fabricated cells was also measured to find out whether the possible scattering from the wrinkled graphene layers plays any role, as shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  External quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) graph of uncoated and 50% dilution of af-RGO coated solar cells. The inset shows the percentage enhancement of EQE and IEQ within the range of 300 nm to 375 nm. 
It is evident from Fig. 14 that both internal and external quantum efficiencies have been enhanced for sample S3 (50% dilution) within the regime of ∼300 nm to ∼400 nm and ∼550 nm to ∼1000 nm. It is also understandable that the increase of the calculated value of IQE in the UV range is due to the decrease in reflectance (Fig. 8) leading to increased absorption in the active layer as a consequence of enhanced scattering in af-RGO.
The corresponding increase in EQE within this range of the sample over the uncoated one is due to the photoluminescence conversion effect (discussed in Section 2.5) through which the surface recombination of holes has been greatly minimized. The inset in Fig. 14 shows the percentage enhancement of EQE and IQE in the UV range of the incident spectrum.
Due to the previously discussed scattering properties of wrinkled graphene on the ARC, the injected photons travel a longer path length in the active silicon layer, causing the generation of a higher number of electron–hole pairs throughout the whole spectrum in the visible and infrared (∼550 nm to ∼ 1000 nm) regimes, which is shown by the increase in both IQE and hence EQE.
4. Conclusions
Wet chemically synthesized af-RGO has been applied on top of the c-Si solar cells by the dip coating technique to extract the benefit in the optical ground as an additional antireflection coating over SiNx and as a photoluminescent converter which converts high-energy photons (of wavelength ∼250 nm to ∼350 nm) to ∼415 nm, enabling them to be absorbed more in the deeper portion of the active silicon layer to reduce the surface recombination loss. In order to provide better conducting path between fingers and busbar of the solar cell and to trim down the electrical loss, 50% diluted af-RGO with a concentration of 25.12 μg ml−1 has been incorporated. Material characterization has been carried out using Raman and FTIR spectrometers. The morphological analyses of the af-RGO solutions with various dilutions with respect to AFM and FESEM have been scrutinized to reduce their agglomeration over stacking and to increase the surface coverage, and the results have been validated from the reflection and transmission studies. This study revealed the enhanced performance of solar cells in terms of ISC, FF and maximum power, which are getting improved from 33.28 mA cm−2 to 34.81 mA cm−2, 72.84% to 76.31%, and 295 mW to 327 mW, respectively, with af-RGO (50% dilution) coated solar cells over the uncoated one. Enhancements observed in ISC and FF are responsible for the improvement in efficiency over the uncoated solar cell. Thus, such dilution effect studies may help to optimize the structural, optical and electrical properties of uniformly thin graphene layers leading to improved c-Si solar cell performances.
