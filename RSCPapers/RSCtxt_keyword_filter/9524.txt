    , Accepted 14th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractBall-in-ball hollow nanostructures (BHSs) based on transition metal chalcogenides hold great promise as electrocatalytic materials for fundamental studies. In this work, we have developed a moderate method to realize the synthesis of transition metal sulfide ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres (Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs). Importantly, it was found that these ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Compared with the ternary Co–WSx and Co–CuSx counterparts, the quaternary Co–Cu–WSx nanospheres exhibited excellent behavior in accelerating the reduction of I3− in DSSCs and expediting the HER in water splitting. Specifically, DSSCs based on Co–Cu–WSx BHSs achieved a splendid power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.61% which was higher than that of Pt (8.24%) under the same conditions. Also, a lower η10 of 82.5 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 53.8 mV per decade were obtained for a Co–Cu–WSx electrocatalyst for the HER in 1.0 M KOH. The present approach is proposed as a new idea for the design of transition metal sulfide hollow nanospheres for different energy conversion applications.
Introduction
Owing to the depletion of petroleum supplies and the increasing contamination of the environment, pursuing new generation energy conversion devices with eminent sustainability has been an extremely urgent mission in recent decades.1–5 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have generally been considered as two environmentally friendly and promising alternative energy sources for the future.6–10 Thus, exploring a variety of abundant, non-noble metal and high-efficiency Pt-like electrocatalysts for DSSCs and the HER has attracted considerable effort due to the major weaknesses of platinum (Pt)/Pt-based alloy materials, such as scarcity, expensiveness and compromised stability.11–16 However, making further improvements to the relatively slow kinetics of non-noble metal catalysts still remains a huge challenge.17,18 Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are highly promising substitutes for Pt and have attracted attention for the catalytic reduction of I3− in DSSCs and for the HER because of their remarkable electronic conductivity, extensive deposits and outstanding redox capacity.19–21
Among the various TMCs, Co3S4 and Cu2S have exhibited splendid catalytic properties as alternatives for noble metals in potential applications such as solar cells.22,23 As a typical TMC, layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) possesses several distinctive features including a large specific surface area, numerous exposed marginal active sites and reasonable mobility, which result in promising electrochemical performances for the redox reaction of I−/I3− in DSSCs and for the HER.24–27 Nevertheless, WS2 belongs to the same sub-family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) as MoS2 and displays similar properties including the recognized shortcoming of poor conductivity. This could be because numerous active sites arise from marginal areas instead of basic planes and the nanosheets have a tendency to aggregate.28–31 Hence, adjusting the nanostructure and coordinating to metal sulfides through chemical doping have been applied to overcome these disadvantages.32,33 There are reports that the formation of multi-element metal sulfides can efficiently improve the catalytic performance with respect to single metal sulfides owing to the synergy of multiple elements.34 Most present reports are about bi-metal/tri-metal sulfides, however the preparation of quaternary metal sulfides with higher catalytic activity via moderate methods remains an enormous challenge.35–37
Hierarchical nanostructures with hollow interior have already become a momentous research topic because of their low density, high surface-to-volume ratio, controllable composition and so on.38–40 The sought-after double-shelled hollow nanostructured materials with multiple morphologies have gradually attracted more extensive research, as their unique structure affords a larger electroactive surface area, lower resistance and clearly defined regions which can be regulated easily. Thus, their special structure makes them candidates for multifunctional materials in energy conversion/storage applications.41,42 Double-shelled hollow nanostructured materials can also synchronously shorten the transportation path for I−/I3− in DSSCs and increase the tolerance of the electrolyte in the HER.43,44 Thereby, increasing attention has been paid to obtaining suitable architectures and specific structure–activity connections using reasonable and controllable methods.45 In brief, developing a facile and scalable strategy to prepare double-shelled quaternary metal sulfides as good Pt-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for both DSSCs and the HER is still a great challenge.46,47
Herein, we design a specific two-step solvothermal method to synthesize new quaternary Co–Cu–WSx double-shelled ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres (named as Co–Cu–WSx BHSs) with enhanced performances in DSSCs and the HER. As expected, the as-synthesized double-shelled nanospheres possess a uniform size of about 600 nm, and the whole sphere is occupied evenly by a multicomponent sulfide which is composed of Co3S4, Cu2S and WS2. Compared with the ternary Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs, the quaternary Co–Cu–WSx BHSs deliver better electrocatalytic performances. The quaternary Co–Cu–WSx BHSs exhibit a favorable PCE of 9.61% in DSSCs, which is better than that of Pt (8.24%) under the same conditions. Moreover, a lower onset potential (25.5 mV) and a smaller value of the Tafel slope (53.8 mV per decade) in 1.0 M KOH can be achieved by Co–Cu–WSx BHSs, further revealing their enhanced electrocatalytic activity and high conductivity for the HER. Finally, there is a great possibility that this approach has further applications in making other multiplex materials with synergistic effects.
Experimental
Synthesis of CoCuW-glycerol precursor
160 mg of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), 132 mg of copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and 40 mg of ammonium metatungstate hydrate ((NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O) were added to a mixed solution of glycerol (8 mL) and isopropanol (50 mL), followed by magnetic stirring for 15 min. Afterwards, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature in a fume cupboard, the obtained CoCuW-glycerol precursor was washed with ethanol several times and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. Likewise, the CoW-glycerol precursor could be successfully obtained through adding 160 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 40 mg of (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O. The fabrication of the CoCu-glycerol precursor was accomplished smoothly by using 160 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 132 mg of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O.
Synthesis of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs
50 mg of the above CoCuW-glycerol product and 150 mg of thioacetamide (TAA) were directly dispersed into 60 mL of absolute ethanol and magnetically stirred for 15 min. After that, the above suspension was transferred into a solvothermal reactor and maintained at 160 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the obtained dark sediment was cooled down to indoor temperature and washed with ethanol, followed by vacuum drying. The syntheses of the Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs were similar to the above procedure. Finally, to improve the crystallinity of the final dark powder, a thermal annealing treatment was carried out at 350 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere.
Electrode preparation for DSSCs
The fabrication of counter electrode (CE) and DSSC loading samples was analogous to our previous work.48 10 mg of the as-synthesized Co–Cu–WSx BHS black powder was evenly distributed in 1 mL of ethanol under ultrasound treatment, and was then spin-coated onto clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm). As a reference, a Pt CE was obtained by calcining chloroplatinic acid on FTO at 450 °C. Afterwards, solar cells with a sandwich-like construction were assembled by using the above CEs, a photoanode and an electrolyte. The TiO2 photoanode was prepared from commercial TiO2 sols (20 nm and 200 nm) via a common screen printing technique, followed by sensitization with N719 dye (0.3 mM in ethanol). The electrolyte was a homogenized acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M DMPII and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine. The mixed solution was added dropwise into the void between the CE and the photoanode. Finally, a DSSC with a sandwich-like construction was made and the active area of each cell was limited to 0.16 cm2 using a metal mask. Five identical electrodes were made to conduct the subsequent tests at the same time, and the obtained test results were averaged.
Electrode preparation for HER
Typically, before ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, 2 mg of the as-prepared Co–Cu–WSx BHS powder was evenly dispersed in a mixture of 40 μL Nafion solution, 92 μL ethanol and 368 μL deionized water. After that, five samples of the suspension (5 μL) were dropped onto five GCEs (glass carbon electrodes, 3 mm in diameter), and the load mass of the samples was regulated at around 0.283 mg cm−2. In addition, a common Pt/C (20 wt%) powder was used as a reference for the HER. All the prepared electrodes were used for the performance tests, and the obtained test results were averaged.
Measurements
Using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation, the relevant electrochemical properties could be studied. The current density–voltage curves (J–V) of the DSSCs were obtained using a standard solar simulator under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2, Oriel 94023A, AAA Class, Newport Corp.). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using symmetric cells at a frequency range of 0.1 to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a mixed acetonitrile solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 100 mM LiClO4.
In a representative three-electrode system, the catalyst loaded GCE, a graphite rod and an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively, and the HER tests were carried out in 1.0 M KOH. The potential was referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the equation E(vs. RHE) = E(vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH + 0.205. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. EIS tests were conducted at a constant over potential and variable frequency (150 mV, 10−2 to 106 Hz), and the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is equal to half of the slope of the line representing the relationship between Δj (Δj = janodic − jcathodic) at 0.15 V vs. RHE and the scan rate. The long-term consistency measurement was implemented at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under continuous CV sweeps (−0.4 to −0.1 V vs. RHE).
Results and discussion
The holistic building-up process of the Co–Cu–WSx BHSs can be broken down into four steps as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, CoCuW-glycerol solid nanospheres with uniform size were synthesized through an appropriate solvothermal approach in a mixture of isopropanol and glycerol. During this process, the cobalt, copper and tungsten ions chelate with glycerol to organize the abundant nuclei, which then grow to form the homogeneous spherical precursor (stage I). Then, in an ethanol solution, S2− released from TAA can react smoothly with metal ions (M2+) on the surface of the CoCuW precursor to form CoCuW solid sphere@CoCuW sulfide core–shell structures. In reality, the sulfidation reaction process can be understood as an ion exchange process (stage II). After further reaction, the outward diffusion velocity of M2+ is faster than the inward diffusion velocity of S2−, resulting in the development of the outer CoCuW sulfide shell and generating a separation between the shell and the CoCuW precursor core. With prolonged heating and further sulfidation reaction, outward diffusion through traversing the growing space becomes rather difficult for M2+.49,50 Meanwhile, the outward diffusion of cationic species still dominates compared to the inward diffusion of anionic ones.51 Hence, a second CoCuW sulfide shell is formed on the outside of the remaining core (stage III).52,53 Finally, the ball-in-ball Co–Cu–WSx hollow spheres are prepared when the ion exchange ends (stage IV). In this synthetic strategy, the formation of the first shell can be explained by the difference in diffusion rate between M2+ and S2−. Similar sulfidation processes generally produce simple hollow structures, forming a single shell and a completely hollow inner,54 possibly because the ion exchange process is repeated within the pre-obtained solid core.55

The detailed structures and surface morphologies of the products with even size were evaluated by SEM images. As shown in Fig. 2a, d and g, the three types of prepared M-glycerol precursors (M = Co–Cu–W, Co–W and Co–Cu) were regularly spherical in shape with diameters of around 600 nm. Significantly, the surface of the Co–Cu–W-glycerol precursor possesses a distinctly rough texture rather than the glossy surfaces exhibited by the other two. After the sulfidation reaction, there is no change in the spheroidal structure, and the outside surface of the spherical nanoparticles becomes rough, effectively leading to an increase in specific surface area. As shown in Fig. 2f and i, the external surfaces of Co–WSx BHSs Co–CuSx BHSs possess visible gaps and uniform distribution, respectively. Meanwhile, a distinctive surface structure with serried and relatively large nanoparticles is exhibited by Co–Cu–WSx BHSs, presumably due to the combination of the Co, Cu and W atoms. Furthermore, from the cracked spheres shown in the SEM images in Fig. S1 (ESI†), a double-shelled construction can be observed for the three ultrasonically treated samples. Thus, the surface morphologies of the double-shell nanospheres may be greatly affected by their distinctive assemblages of elements.

XRD was conducted to explore the composition and crystalline nature of the samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The XRD patterns of the three hybrid materials present several peaks at 26.4°, 31.3°, 37.8°, 50.1° and 54.8° which are due to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0) (5 1 1) and (4 4 0) planes of Co3S4 (ICDD PDF no. 00-042-1448).56 Moreover, some clear peaks in the XRD pattern of Co–WSx at 14.2°, 28.9°, 34.3°, 44.0° and 59.0° correspond to WS2 (ICDD PDF no. 01-084-1399).57 Furthermore, the obvious diffraction peaks of Co–CuSx correspond well to the crystallographic phase of Cu2S (ICDD PDF no. 00-053-0522), where 2θ values of 16.1°, 22.3°, 32.4° and 46.1° coincide with the (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes.58 Meanwhile, the main peaks of Cu2S (32.2°, 36.1° and 46.3°) and WS2 (14.3°, 38.0° and 48.2°) are visible in the XRD pattern of Co–Cu–WSx, supplying evidence for the presence of Co3S4, Cu2S and WS2 in the hybrid. Therefore, tungsten doping is successfully carried out through the facile solvothermal reaction.

The crystal structure and inner morphology of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs were further examined by TEM (Fig. 4). As seen in Fig. 4a, Co–Cu–WSx displays a separation between the outer and inner layers which verifies the characteristic double-shell structure, corresponding to the above SEM images. The thickness of the outer and inner shells is about 25 and 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 4b). The rough shell is strewn with a mass of nanoscale particles which matches the SEM observation well. The high-resolution TEM image shows a lattice spacing of 0.621 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 3) plane of WS2, and interplanar distances of around 0.555 nm and 0.321 nm, agreeing well with the (1 1 1) plane of Co3S4 and the (1 1 1) plane of hexagonal Cu2S, respectively (Fig. 4c). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image exhibits several distinct rings which can be indexed to the (1 1 3), (2 1 0) and (5 1 1) planes of WS2, Cu2S and Co3S4, confirming the polycrystallinity of the Co–Cu–WSx BHSs (Fig. 4d). The spatial distribution of elements was investigated by EDX elemental mapping spectroscopy (Fig. 4e), and there is an even distribution of Co, Cu, W and S elements throughout the entire ball-in-ball construction. Meanwhile, the atomic ratios of Co, Cu and W can be identified using the EDX results shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

XPS (Fig. 5) was employed to determine the surface composition and valence states of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs. The survey spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs prove that Co, Cu, W, S, O and C (as a reference) elements are present in Co–Cu–WSx BHSs via the Gaussian fitting method. In the Co 2p region (Fig. 5a), the two main peaks located at 778.6 and 780.6 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2, and the peaks at 793.7 eV and 796.8 eV are ascribed to Co 2p1/2, which indicates the presence of Co2+ and Co3+. The spectra can be fitted with two pairs of spin–orbit doublets arising from the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 signals and two shake-up satellites, indicating the presence of Co3S4.48 As for the Cu 2p region of Cu2S (Fig. 5b), the binding energies at values of 933.1 eV and 953.1 eV correspond to Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, revealing the presence of Cu in the +1 oxidation state and verifying the formation of cuprous sulfide.59 In the W 4f region (Fig. 5c), three characteristic peaks at the binding energy values of 33.6 eV, 35.5 eV and 37.6 eV, corresponding to W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2 and W 5p3/2, respectively, confirm the presence of W(IV).60Fig. 5d shows the spectrum for S 2p, and the two main peaks at 162.7 and 163.8 eV can be ascribed to the binding energies of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, confirming the presence of divalent sulfide (S2−). Moreover, the peak at 167.1 eV corresponds to higher oxidation state sulfur species.61 Therefore, there are Co2+, Co3+, Cu+, W4+ and S2− ions on the near-surface of Co–Cu–WSx.

The pore characteristics of Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs were explored using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 6. As displayed, the isotherms of all the samples can be assigned as type IV curves with hysteresis loops at P/P0 of 0.4–1, indicating that there are mesoporous structures in all the nanospheres. Meanwhile, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs are 71.7, 49.7 and 49.1 m2 g−1, respectively. Co–Cu–WSx possesses the largest specific surface are, which may be explained by the larger interior space and the lamellar structure of WS2. Besides, the pore size distributions of all the as-prepared samples were calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The approximate pore diameter of around 3.80 nm for the three samples confirms that they have similar pore structures. A higher specific surface area and particular mesoporous structure can increase the contact between the electrocatalytic material and electrolyte ions, which is beneficial in improving the electrocatalytic properties of nanostructured materials.62

The photovoltaic properties of DSSCs grounded on several CEs under 100 mW cm−2 illumination were evaluated using a current density–voltage (J–V) plot (Fig. 7a), and the correlative photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The four curves appear rectangular, indicating the remarkable catalytic behavior of the sulfur compounds, as well as that of Pt. Nonetheless, the composition plays an important role in the photoelectric performances of the DSSCs. It can be seen that the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the four curves exhibit minor differences, showing that the influence of the photoanode and the electrolyte can be ignored.63 The DSSCs employing Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx, Co–CuSx and Pt CEs exhibit progressively decreasing PCEs of 9.61%, 9.14%, 8.56% and 8.24%, respectively. The devices based on the three multicomponent hybrids are superior to that based on Pt because the unique morphology can provide a coarser surface and more electroactive sites. The cell containing Co–Cu–WSx exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance (PCE of 9.61%, Jsc of 17.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.680), which surpasses those of the Co–WSx CE (PCE of 9.14%, Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.673) and the Co–CuSx CE (PCE of 8.56%, Jsc of 16.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.636), due to the unusual hollow structure. This construction may accommodate more I−/I3−, reduce the length of the transfer path and lead to a decrease in resistance in the DSSC. Furthermore, this result also indicates that quaternary metallic compounds may exhibit better electrocatalytic activity than ternary systems. Detailed comparison data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In Table S1 (ESI†), the high PCE of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs indicates their superior cell performance, which surpasses that of many other non-noble metal-based catalysts including CuS/MoS2 nanomaterials, MoS2/Co3S4 composites, and CoS on om-SnO2, as well as hybrids of metal sulfides and carbon materials. This result further supports the findings of this work. Moreover, the PCE after 2000 consecutive CV cycles (Fig. S4, ESI†) is still higher than that of the Pt reference and is maintained at 8.64%. which is 89% of the value before the test, demonstrating high durability. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. S5a and S5b, ESI†) show the variation of the morphology of Co–Cu–WSx after CV measurements. The hollow interior structure exhibits a slight collapse, and whiskers emerge from the surface, yet the ball-in-ball structure is well preserved.

For research purposes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with two symmetric and identical cells to evaluate the charge transfer dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The obtained Nyquist plots for the four dummy cells are displayed in Fig. 7b. It is observed that there are two semicircles on the left (high frequency) and right (low frequency). The high frequency intercept on the x-axis corresponds to the series resistance (Rs), including the sheet resistance of the two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. The left semicircle can reveal the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the CE and the electrolyte as well as the corresponding constant phase element (CPE) representing the double-layer capacitance.64 The semicircle in the low frequency area corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN), reflecting the diffusional resistance of the redox couple (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte. A smaller ZN means that I−/I3− more easily diffuse to the surface of the electrode.65 The Nyquist plots can be analyzed using Z-view software with an equivalent circuit diagram, which is shown as an inset in Fig. 7b. The derived EIS data are listed in Table 2. The four curves exhibit similar Rs values, which means that the effect of Rs is negligible. Meanwhile, a smaller Rct signifies a lower electrical resistivity and a faster charge transfer. The Rct values of the Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx, Co–CuSx and Pt CEs are 1.06, 1.88, 2.37 and 2.76 Ω, respectively, indicating that the Co–Cu–WSx CE exhibits better catalytic activity to increase the reduction rate of I−/I3−.66 The lower Rs and Rct values of Co–Cu–WSx can give rise to a reduction in the internal resistance of the Co–Cu–WSx CE.

Afterwards, using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the reversibility of the as-prepared CEs was characterized in a typical three-electrode configuration. As presented in Fig. 8a, there are two clear pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks in every CV profile. The left pair (Red-1/Ox-1) could correspond to eqn (1), while the right one (Red-2/Ox-2) could correspond to the reaction in eqn (2). The correlation parameters are summarized in Table 2. The catalytic ability for the reduction of I3− has a direct relationship with the cathodic current density (JRed-1) of the Red-1 peak. A higher absolute value of JRed-1 signifies a faster reduction rate of I3−. From Table 2, the CEs based on Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs exhibit negative JRed-1 values, testifying to their high-level electrocatalytic activities. The |JRed-1| values of Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs are 1.73, 1.50 and 1.32 mA cm−2, respectively, confirming the higher catalytic activity of the quaternary chalcogenide for the I3−/I− redox reaction. This phenomenon may be due to the suitable surface topography and the synergistic effect of multiple elements. I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)

At the same time, electrocatalytic performances can also be estimated by another important parameter, peak-to-peak separation (Epp), which is closely related to the reversibility of the electrode reaction. A smaller Epp between the Ox-1 and Red-1 peaks corresponds to superior activity for electrocatalysis.67 The values of Epp are in the sequence Co–Cu–WSx BHSs (227 mV) < Co–WSx BHSs (270 mV) < Co–CuSx BHSs (284 mV) < Pt (302 mV), as shown in Table 2, proving the splendid electrocatalytic properties of Co–Cu–WSx and agreeing with the J–V and EIS results. Fig. 8b exhibits the CV curves of Co–Cu–WSx BHSs at multiple sweep rates. As the scan rate increases from 25 to 150 mV s−1, the peak current values tend to increase, and the anodic/cathodic peaks also shift towards positive/negative directions due to the fast diffusion of I−/I3− on the surface of the counter electrode. This result reveals that the Co–Cu–WSx CE becomes reactive at a higher sweep rate. Further, the results of line fitting between the peak current densities and the square roots of the scanning rates (Fig. 8c) follow the Langmuir isotherm theory. The redox reaction of I−/I3− is only restricted by diffusion.54
The limited current density (Jlim) and exchange current density (J0) in the Tafel curves (Fig. 8d) can be used to further investigate the electrocatalysis of the samples. The results show that Jlim and J0 follow the same sequence: Co–Cu–WSx < Co–WSx < Co–CuSx < Pt. Evidently, Co–Cu–WSx exhibits greater Jlim of 1.98 log(mA cm−2) and J0 of 0.640 log(mA cm−2), revealing its higher diffusion coefficient and greater electrocatalytic ability. This result is in agreement with the above CV results.
As is well-known, the HER performance can be illustrated by the catalytic current at a specific potential. At the same potential, greater current density signifies better HER properties.68 The as-obtained Co–Cu–WSx, Co–WSx and Co–CuSx BHSs were evaluated as electrocatalysts for the HER in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH) with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in a three-electrode setup. In Fig. 9a, the Pt/C electrode displays the lowest ηonset (the potential at which the current density is 1 mA cm−2) which is close to zero, indicating optimal catalytic properties for water splitting. Table 3 displays a detailed comparative analysis of the corresponding data. The ηonset value of Co–Cu–WSx is as low as 25.5 mV (vs. RHE), followed by Co–WSx (51.3 mV) and Co–CuSx (81.0 mV). As an alkaline-efficient electrocatalyst, Co–Cu–WSx exhibits an impressive catalytic performance which may be due to the surface configuration and the impact of multiple elements. At the same time, the catalytic ability for the HER can also be evaluated by η10 (the potential at which the current density is 10 mA cm−2), deemed to be another crucial indicator. The values of η10 follow this sequence: Co–Cu–WSx (82.5 mV) < Co–WSx (121 mV) < Co–CuSx (175 mV), proving the superior HER performance of Co–Cu–WSx in comparison with the other nanomaterials in alkaline medium. A detailed comparison of Co–Cu–WSx with other reported alkaline-efficient Pt-free electrocatalysts for the HER is presented in Table S3 (ESI†). The corresponding Tafel slope and exchange current density (J0) are two additional kinetic parameters during HER catalysis. The former can be used to analyze the HER mechanism, and is calculated as an index to estimate the strength of the electrocatalyst and fitted according to eqn (3) (b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density). A lower Tafel slope implies that the HER rate increases rapidly with an increase in potential.69J0 can reflect the inherent electrocatalytic activity of the electrode ingredients. In general, desirable catalysts for the HER should possess smaller Tafel slopes and larger exchange current densities. η = blogj + a(3)

In Fig. 9b, the Pt/C electrode as a reference yields a minimal Tafel slope (34.2 mV dec−1) in alkaline medium which is similar to the previous report.70 Larger Tafel slopes can be observed for Co–WSx (70.8 mV dec−1) and Co–CuSx (95.9 mV dec−1), while Co–Cu–WSx BHSs exhibit a smaller slope value of 53.8 mV dec−1. The data suggest that the rate-determining step obeys the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (H2O + Hads + e− → H2 + OH−) (called the chemical desorption reaction) in which Hads represents H atoms assimilated on the surface of the catalyst.71 This result shows that the synergistic action of Co, Cu and W elements plays a substantial role in the catalytic process for the hydrogen evolution reaction and that nanoparticles of the right size may expose more active sites because of their adequate surface area, benefiting the production of Hads. The kinetic process of the as-obtained catalysts in the HER can be further investigated through EIS measurements in 1.0 M KOH, and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 9c. Co–Cu–WSx exhibits a satisfactory Rct of 62.0 Ω which is smaller than those of Co–WSx (95.9 Ω) and Co–CuSx (115 Ω), showing its better charge transfer capacity. Electrochemical durability cannot be ignored in practical applications. Fig. 9d presents the polarization curves of Co–Cu–WSx before and after 2000 CV cycles. The ηonset/η10 of Co–Cu–WSx only increased by about 6.5/14.5 mV, demonstrating the excellent stability of Co–Cu–WSx. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. S5c and S5d, ESI†) show that the surface morphology of Co–Ni–MoSx is retained after the stability test.
As mentioned earlier, the excellent electrocatalytic performance may be due to the hollow structure and the synergistic effect of multiple elements. The synergistic effect may be reflected by the following aspects: (i) doping with metal atoms may produce a suitable surface topography. Besides, the metal atoms are evenly distributed and there is no obvious agglomeration throughout the entire sphere, showing the excellent stability.72 (ii) Multiple elements can work together to accelerate the electron transfer rate of the electrode, promoting the collection of photogenerated electrons in an external circuit and the reduction reaction of I3−. These phenomena may inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons, thus reducing the generation of dark current and increasing Jsc in the DSSC.73–75 (iii) The Tafel slope of pure WS2 is large, suggesting that the slow discharge step (H2O + e− → Hads + OH−) is the rate-controlling step of hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the synergistic effect of multiple elements can lower the reaction barrier of hydrogen evolution so that it is less than the barrier of the chemical desorption reaction (H2O + Hads + e− → H2 + OH−), thus decreasing the Tafel slope and overpotential in the HER.76–79 (iv) It is reported that Co atoms may tend to be closer to S atoms, which can reduce the free energy of hydrogen adsorption and enhance the catalytic activity.80
The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated from the double-layer capacitances (Cdl, Fig. 9e) calculated from the CV curves (Fig. S6, ESI†) at a series of different sweep rates. As shown in Fig. 9e, the Cdl values, halves of the straight slopes, are in the order Co–Cu–WSx (7.40 mF cm−2) > Co–WSx (5.12 mF cm−2) > Co–CuSx (3.64 mF cm−2), showing that Co–Cu–WSx BHSs possess more active sites at the solid–liquid interface. Also, the specific ECSA values can be calculated using eqn (4) and (5). ECSA = CdlS/Cs(4) RF = ECSA/S = Cdl/Cs(5)
In these equations, S and Cs are the geometric area of the GCE (0.0707 cm2) and the specific capacitance (assumed to be 0.040 mF cm−2 for a smooth GCE in 1.0 M KOH), respectively.81 After calculation, the determined ECSA values are 13.1 cm2 for Co–Cu–WSx, 9.05 cm2 for Co–WSx and 6.43 cm2 for Co–CuSx. Hence, Co–Cu–WSx displays the highest RF (roughness factor) value of 327, compared with Co–WSx (226) and Co–CuSx (160). The high ECSA and RF may mean that there are plentiful active areas on the boundary surface of the electrode and electrolyte, accelerating the generation of hydrogen. The exchange current density (J0), which was described above, matches the previous test results. The J0 value of Co–Cu–WSx (0.299 mA cm−2) is much higher than those of Co–WSx (0.175 mA cm−2) and Co–CuSx (0.146 mA cm−2), further proving its excellent catalytic capacity for the HER.
Conclusions
In summary, Co–Cu–WSx ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres with a uniform size of 600 nm were successfully synthesized in this work. After a mild two-step solvothermal process, the quaternary nano-catalyst exhibited a special surface texture and superior electrochemical performance for DSSCs and the HER (in 1.0 M KOH), which could be optimized using different combinations of elements. The CE based on Co–Cu–WSx BHSs exhibited a PCE of 9.61%, which is higher than those of ternary Co–WSx (9.14%) and Co–CuSx (8.56%), and Pt (8.24%). Furthermore, as an efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, Co–Cu–WSx BHSs also displayed a lower onset overpotential of 25.5 mV and a small Tafel slope of 53.8 mV per decade. The facile method to synthesize catalysts based on transition metal sulfide-based composite materials reported here can afford a new perspective for the design of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for DSSCs and the alkaline HER.
