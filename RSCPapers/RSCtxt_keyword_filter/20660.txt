    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 24th May 2023AbstractImproving battery stability while maintaining high photoelectric conversion efficiency remains the bottleneck in the current development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Three π-conjugated pyridine-based molecules, pyridine (Py), bipyridine (Bpy), and terpyridine (Tpy), were adopted to passivate the PSCs in recent experiments (J. Chen, S.-G. Kim, X. Ren, H. S. Jung and N.-G. Park, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 4977–4987; J. Zhang, J. Duan, Q. Zhang, Q. Guo, F. Yan, X. Yang, Y. Duan and Q. Tang, Chem. Eng. J., 2022, 431, 134230), in which Bpy works best in terms of photovoltaic properties and moisture tolerance. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we demonstrate that Bpy displays the least structural fluctuation when adsorbed on the perovskite surface, enlarges the bandgap suppressing electron–hole recombination, and exhibits remarkable shielding effects against moisture. The appropriate anchoring ability of Bpy retains robust binding strength and preferable charge transfer ability compared to Py at the interfaces between the passivation molecules (PMs) and MAPbI3. In contrast, although Tpy possesses the strongest charge-transfer capability, it introduces midgap states owing to intense electronegativity, providing additional pathways for nonradiative charge relaxation. Besides, Tpy triggers rapid diffusions of water and larger atomic fluctuations, destroying the structures of the perovskite through the removal of lead atoms. Our computational results not only rationalize the experimental observations but also provide valuable guidance at the atomic level to design novel PMs that endow PSCs with outstanding photovoltaic performance as well as stability against moisture.
1. Introduction
Carbon neutrality has become a collective target for countries worldwide owing to global climate warming. It is imperative to promote the development of green sources of energy such as solar energy. Over the past decade, remarkable properties such as low cost,1 tunable bandgap,2–4 and long carrier diffusion length5,6 have endowed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with great potential applications in future photovoltaic devices.
Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has grown to 25.7%7 for PSCs so far, degradation caused by humidity, UV illumination, and elevated temperature hinders the large-scale commercialization of PSCs.8 Due to the hygroscopicity of the methylammonium cation, the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) is extremely sensitive to moisture. Water interacts with the composition of the perovskite, leading to structural decomposition through different pathways and resulting in different products.9 For instance, Caddeo and co-workers proposed that CH3NH3PbI3 undergoes dissolution with the generation of PbI2 films and solvation of MA and I ions with liquid water.10 Previous research has indicated that MAPbI3 can form monohydrate and dihydrate phases in a humid environment, along with the production of PbI2, CH3NH2, and HI via hydration processes.11 In addition to composition degradation, the presence of H2O also impairs the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.9 An increased content of water in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution causes larger pinholes, which can be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and leads to a decline in the fill factor (FF).12 Several researchers have stated that the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis worsens with increasing ionic migration upon moisture exposure.11,13 The degradation of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) has been observed after H2O ingression.14 Furthermore, defects on the surface and grain boundaries create channels for infiltration of water, accelerating interactions among compositions of the perovskite and leading to more severe moisture degradation15 and deteriorating performance.16
Facing the above-mentioned challenges, additive engineering17–19 has proved to be a brilliant strategy to heal perovskite defects and enhance moisture tolerance. A variety of passivated additive materials such as Lewis acid/base,20 ionic salts,21 polymers,22,23 and self-assembled supramolecules24,25 have been utilized at the interfaces of the perovskite to markedly improve the performance and stability. Lewis bases are able to coordinate with uncoordinated Pb atoms, forming Lewis adducts by donating lone electrons. Pyridine and thiophene, as the first generation of monodentate Lewis bases, were first used to passivate the defects of perovskites in experiments conducted by Noel et al.26 Based on further studies on the structure and properties of Lewis bases, a bidentate molecule, 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MP), was found to increase anchoring strength, promoting the passivation efficacy and stability synchronously.27 In the meantime, other bidentate PMs such as D4TBP28 and 1,10-phenanthroline,29 along with even polydentate natural PMs like caffeine30 and histamine,31 have been gradually applied in experiments, and exhibit outstanding passivation performance.
In addition to experiments, in-depth computational work has been devoted to Lewis base PMs at the atomic level. Zhang et al. conducted theoretical research on thiophene and pyridine on perovskite surfaces, in which they found that thiophene creates a barrier layer to repel water molecules32 and pyridine brings about strong interactions with the perovskite by modifying the perovskite surface structures and elongating the surface Pb–I bond lengths.33 Long and co-workers revealed that thiophene and pyridine reduce nonadiabatic coupling and increase the efficiency of PSCs by affecting the localization of the electron wave functions.34 Additionally, they showed that bidentate Lewis base D4TBP is more favorable than the monodentate ligands pyridine/thiophene for the passivation of MAPbI3 surfaces because the two binding sites provide a good match to the sparse inorganic lattice of the MAPbI3 crystal structure.35 Previous works from our group found that the bidentate molecule 2-MP achieves satisfactory passivation effects because of multiple synergistic interactions with the perovskite surface.36 Moreover, a series of novel 2-MP-based PMs with different lengths of alkyl chains were theoretically designed, where 2-MDEP with moderate lengths of alkyl chains was demonstrated to work best.37 Our latest study further revealed that a larger energy barrier for ion migrations and smaller atomic fluctuations endow 2-MDEP with a more positive improvement in perovskite stability.38
The π-conjugated pyridine derivatives (Py, Bpy, Tpy) not only possess favorable charge transfer at interfaces,39 but also can effectively improve the film quality of the perovskite by modulating grain growth, showing admirable performance in experiments.40,41 According to previous research,27,28,35 PMs with more anchoring sites corresponded to better passivation performance. Py, Bpy, and Tpy (see Fig. 1) act as monodentate, bidentate, and tridentate ligands, and the passivation effect from Tpy to Bpy to Py is supposed to be in descending order with Tpy being the best. Nevertheless, Bpy exhibited the most remarkable performance, especially even surpassing Tpy in experiments.40,41 To be specific, in terms of photovoltaic performance, Bpy is superior to Tpy whether it is at an equal or optimal concentration. Besides, the performance of Tpy declined so heavily that it became inferior to the control group as the concentration increased. Similarly, the moisture resistance of Bpy surpasses Tpy unexpectedly in the early stage.40 The aforementioned abnormal experimental results have aroused our curiosity. Are there any latent rules about PMs?
 Fig. 1  The structures of PMs in this work. 
The experiments mainly focus on the passivation effect on the macroscopic perovskite morphology. Inspired by the above-mentioned anomalous passivation effect among pyridine-based ligands, especially between Bpy and Tpy, in this work, we investigated the geometric structure and electronic properties of pyridine-based passivated perovskites at the atomic level based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as the interaction between the H2O/PMs/MAPbI3 surfaces with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation.
The DFT and AIMD results demonstrate that Bpy with its gentle ligand ability can effectively enlarge the bandgap, prolonging carrier lifetime, and exhibits notable shielding effects against humidity as well as the least structural fluctuations, thus illustrating the superior photovoltaic properties and moisture tolerance of Bpy-containing PSCs. Such suitable coordinate capability provides Bpy with stronger bonding strength and preferable charge transfer compared to Py at PMs/MAPbI3 interfaces and avoids trap states and violent atomic fluctuations like those with Tpy. In contrast, the electronegativity of Tpy is so intense as to create midgap states which accelerate electron–hole nonradiative recombination. Besides, the violent atomic fluctuations induced by Tpy further trigger the collapse of the whole system, weakening its moisture resistance.
2. Computational details
The structures of isolated PMs were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level42,43 using Gaussian 09 software.44 There is no imaginary frequency at the optimized structures, indicating that they correspond to true energy minima. Next, the PM@MAPbI3 systems were constructed by putting one optimized PM molecule (Py, Bpy, or Tpy) on the surface of MAPbI3 in its pseudocubic phase.45 The adsorption geometry optimization and electronic property analysis were implemented using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.46,47 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)48 exchange-correlation functional and projector-augmented wave (PAW)49,50 approaches was employed. The weak van der Waals interactions were treated by the DFT-D3 correction.51 The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane waves was set to be 400 eV. A Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations, respectively. The geometries were optimized until the difference in total energy was less than 10−5 eV and all forces on each atom fell below the threshold value of 0.02 eV Å−1. The relevant calculations were processed with the VASPKIT code.52 The optimized lattice constants for bulk MAPbI3 were a = 6.29 Å, b = 6.27 Å, and c = 6.29 Å, which agrees well with the previous theoretical value of 6.29 Å35 and the experimental results of 6.276 Å.53 The 144-atom (2 × 2) PbI2-terminated (001) perovskite surface is composed of three layers. The bottom layer was frozen, while the others were allowed to relax during the optimizations. Vacuum layers of 20 Å in the z direction were added to prevent mirror interactions. The constants of the repeated slab were 12.58 Å, 12.54 Å, and 32.29 Å along the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
To probe the interactions between a passivated perovskite surface and water molecules, an AIMD simulation was carried out using the CP2K package.54 A cutoff energy for the hybrid Gaussian plane-wave basis was set to 400 Ry to ensure accuracy. A trajectory of 20 ps was obtained in the NVT ensemble based on the Nosé–Hoover thermostat55,56 with a 1 fs atomic time-step and a constant temperature of 300 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure and adsorption energy
Bpy and Tpy have been used broadly as metal chelate agents in the experiments, where N atoms always prefer to remain in the same direction in the complex.57,58 The adsorption configurations for Bpy/Tpy are more complicated than those for Py owing to the molecular flexibility. The directions of N atoms in the same or inverse direction for Bpy/Tpy, and the angle between PMs and the MAPbI3 substrate were considered in our work. The arrangement of conformations was chosen by rotating the PMs about the central Pb of the MAPbI3 surface, which was consistent with the approach in the previous literature.59 The most stable adsorption configurations are presented in Fig. 2. Bpy and Tpy tend to adsorb on MAPbI3 in a tilted orientation, which is similar to other π-conjugated PMs.59–61 As expected, the adsorption configurations with the N atoms of Bpy/Tpy in the same direction have an advantage over those with the N atoms in the inverse direction which are unable to match well with the Pb of MAPbI3.
 Fig. 2  The side and top views of the optimized configurations for PMs@MAPbI3. The yellow transparent circle areas indicate the central Pb. The numbers in red refer to the length (Å) of Pb–N bonds. 
The introduction of PMs causes distortion of the PbI6 octahedron on the MAPbI3 surface and rotation of the MA+ cation, which has been reported by several groups based on simulations62,63 and experimental measurements.64 The influence of Py, Bpy, and Tpy on MAPbI3 is enhanced in that order, which is reflected in the adsorption energy and variations in bond length (see Table 1). The adsorption energy Ead is defined as follows: Ead = EPMs@MAPbI3 − EMAPbI3 − EPMs, where EPMs@MAPbI3 and EMAPbI3 stand for the total energy of the MAPbI3 slab with and without the passivation molecule, respectively, and EPMs is the energy of a single passivation molecule in a vacuum. A more negative value of Ead refers to a stronger adsorption strength. The Ead values for Py, Bpy, and Tpy on the MAPbI3 surface are −1.60 eV, −2.40 eV, and −2.63 eV, respectively, which is significantly more negative than that of the water molecule of −1.00 eV (see Fig. S1†). This phenomenon indicates that the PMs bind to perovskites more easily than water. The interaction is gradually enhanced for Py@MAPbI3, Bpy@MAPbI3, and Tpy@MAPbI3, in that order. As shown in Table 1, the averaged N–Pb distances (2.61 Å, 2.65 Å, and 2.63 Å) are similar, whereas the Pb–I bond lengths (3.19 Å, 3.23 Å, and 3.33 Å) in the vertical direction around the central Pb possess a positive relationship with the number of N atoms. Owing to the larger molecule size from Py to Tpy, the enhanced interaction causes the central Pb to move up rather closer to the MAPbI3 surface, as evidenced by the decreasing trend of N–Pb distances.

3.2. Interfacial properties of PMs@MAPbI3
Interfacial properties play key roles in the fact that ligand passivation engineering can promote optoelectronic characteristics.19,65
The interactions between the PMs and the perovskite surfaces induce charge redistribution.37,66 In order to visualize the interaction and charge transfer property, the charge density difference (CDD) was calculated and is depicted in Fig. 3, where the blue and yellow regions in the 3D isosurfaces correspond to charge depletion and accumulation. It is clear that both charge depletion and accumulation mainly occur around the PMs/MAPbI3 interface. Such a redistribution of charge illustrates that there is strong chemical adsorption between perovskite surfaces and PMs. To identify the direction and quantity of charge transfer, the z-direction planar-averaged CDD and Bader charge are depicted in Fig. 3. Positive value in the yellow rectangular transparent area indicates electron accumulation, and the negative value in the blue transparent area represents electron depletion (hole accumulation). It is apparent that electron depletion occurs mainly in passivated molecules whereas accumulation appears on the perovskite surface, which demonstrates the electron transfer from the PM side to the perovskite side. There is little difference between Py@MAPbI3 and Bpy@MAPbI3, whereas Tpy@MAPbI3 possesses a higher value and a larger integral area in the planar-averaged CDD. 0.09, 0.11, and 0.16 electrons are transferred from Py, Bpy, and Tpy to the perovskite, respectively. The amount of charge transfer from Py, Bpy, and Tpy has a positive relation with N ligands on account of the outstanding charge transfer performance of the π-conjugated pyridine ring. The transfer of charge establishes a dipole and built-in electric field, which facilitates the separation of electrons and holes.67–69 Compared with Py@MAPbI3 and Bpy@MAPbI3, the difference in CDD and charge transfer indicates that Tpy holds the strongest interaction with the perovskite surface.
 Fig. 3  (a) The charge density difference, Bader charge analysis, and (b) planar-averaged charge density difference for PMs@MAPbI3. The number represents the amount of the Bader charge. The positive value (marked in the yellow rectangular region) suggests charge accumulation, and the negative value (marked in the blue rectangular region) refers to the charge depletion. The isosurface level for the charge density difference is set at 0.001 e per Bohr3. 

Fig. 4 presents the band structures and projected density of states (PDOS) of bare MAPbI3, Py@MAPbI3, Bpy@MAPbI3, and Tpy@MAPbI3 systems, respectively. The calculated direct bandgap of bare (001) MAPbI3 is 1.70 eV, which is well consistent with the value (1.70 eV) reported in the previous theoretical study35 and experiment.70 As for the PMs@MAPbI3 systems, Py and Bpy enlarge the band gap of the MAPbI3 slab to 1.82 eV and 1.81 eV, whereas Tpy causes a decrease in the band gap to 1.15 eV. The passivation of Py and Bpy causes the conduction band edge to move up slightly, resulting in an increased band gap of 0.1 eV compared to the bare MAPbI3 surface. The larger bandgap suppresses electron–hole recombination36,71 and prolongs the carrier lifetime. VOC mainly depends on nonradiative recombination centers in the solar cell.9 The experimental observation40 that VOC of Bpy is superior to that of Tpy is consistent with our results. It is worth noting that the introduction of Tpy creates a deep electron midgap state accompanied by a significant band gap reduction for the system, which causes electron–hole recombination.
 Fig. 4  Band structure and projected density of states (PDOS). 
One interesting point is why Tpy generates a deep midgap state for the system. Compared with Bpy, Tpy possesses one more pyridine ring; it needs to be determined whether it is due to its larger total electronegativity derived from an extra N atom. In addition, some passivated molecules with some large electronegative O or N atoms such as caffeine59 and perylene diimide (PDI)72 indeed introduce trap states into the band structure. To verify our hypothesis, a new molecule was designed based on Tpy, in which one of the pyridine rings was replaced by a thiophene ring, named Tpy-1S (see Fig. S2†). The total electronegativity of Tpy-1S is weaker than that of Tpy because of the larger electronegativity in the N atom of pyridine compared with the S atom in thiophene,32,36 and thus the band gap of Tpy-1S@MAPbI3 should be larger than that of Tpy@MAPbI3. The results (see Fig. S2†) show that the introduction of Tpy-1S not only eliminates deep trap states but also enlarges the band gap compared with Tpy@MAPbI3, which is the expected behavior. The band gap of Tpy-1S@MAPbI3 is 1.46 eV which is between the band gap values of 1.81 eV and 1.15 eV for Bpy@MAPbI3 and Tpy@MAPbI3, respectively. Therefore, the intensive coordination ability of Tpy, derived from the more electronegative N atoms, generates an electron trap state.
The charge densities of the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) for PMs@MAPbI3 are plotted in Fig. S3.† The CBM of Bpy@MAPbI3 presents the most localized distribution around PMs between all three systems, which means that the electron and hole are more spatially separated, and the overlaps of wave functions are smaller, slowing down the electron–hole recombination. For Tpy@MAPbI3, Tpy with most N atoms lowers the energy of the electronic levels,34 leading to trap states, and then the CBM localizes away from PMs, while the VBM is close to PMs, leading to a large overlap of the electron and hole wave functions.
3.3. Molecular dynamics of PMs@MAPbI3 with H2O
To probe the resistance of Py-based PMs against moisture on the MAPbI3 surface, AIMD simulations were carried out. Previous works73,74 have demonstrated that water molecules at large coverage form a continuous hydrogen-bonded network with each other, blocking water molecules from diffusion inside the perovskite and slowing down degradation. In previous work,36–38 two PMs corresponded to four H2O molecules. Due to the large size of Py-based PMs, only one PM could be placed on the surface, but we considered two H2O molecules positioned above the central Pb atom of the MAPbI3 surface. The height of the H2O molecules is about 5 Å relative to the PMs, and their absolute height is in the range of 24–26 Å above the MAPbI3 surface. The initial AIMD configurations are shown in Fig. S4.† The energy of the investigated systems oscillates near the equilibrium state in a range of 0.05 eV over the entire trajectory (see Fig. S5†), which means the systems are in a steady state. The persistence of PMs adsorbed on the perovskite surface plays a dominant role in the passivation effect, which can be characterized by the evolution of the distance between the N in the PMs and the Pb on the perovskite surface over time, which is shown in Fig. 5. We can see the fluctuations of the Pb–N distance are negligible for H2O–PMs@MAPbI3, which demonstrates that the PMs are bonded to the Pb of the perovskite so tightly that it is difficult for them to leave the surface under the invasion of water. The fact that H2O molecules are unable to affect the strong Pb–N interaction further confirms our prior DFT calculations, indicating that PMs bind to the perovskite more robustly than water does in humid environments.
 Fig. 5  Variations of the distance between the N atoms in the PMs and the Pb atoms on the perovskite surface for the studied H2O–PMs@MAPbI3 systems. 
The diffusion of H2O molecules into the inner perovskite is the first step in PSC degradation.73Fig. 6 describes the evolution of the height of O atoms in water over time. Snapshots of the AIMD trajectory for H2O–Py@MAPbI3 and H2O–Bpy@MAPbI3 are visualized in Fig. S6.† A water molecule immediately diffuses into the inner region of the bare perovskite system from the early stage of the simulation. Upon introduction of Py, the first water molecule does not penetrate apparently into the interior until 11 ps. Continuous invasions of H2O molecules into the perovskite are not observed over the whole simulation for the H2O–Bpy@MAPbI3 system, which is due to its remarkable hydrophobic properties and bidentate anchoring. In the system with Tpy, at just 5 ps, the first water molecule apparently begins to diffuse into the interior with a rapid trend. Finally, both H2O molecules maintain the deep inner region of the perovskite. The above-mentioned moisture resistance of the passivated systems by AIMD simulations shows that Bpy exhibits outstanding moisture resistance, while Tpy possesses poor moisture tolerance, which is well consistent with the preliminary stage of the experimental observations.40
 Fig. 6  Evolution of the height of the O atoms in water molecules over time. 
The atomic fluctuation is usually used to evaluate the stability relative to the degradation of the system when exposed to oxygen, light, and moisture as reported in the literature.35,75 The boosted fluctuation means accelerated degradation of the perovskites,75 whereas a suppressed atomic fluctuation indicates enhanced perovskite stability.35 The quantitative fluctuation of the system is characterized by calculating the average standard deviation (σ) of the positions for the I/MA/Pb particles, using the following formula:76–78  where rij refers to the position of MA/I/Pb particles i at step j, ri denotes the average location of particles i along m-step AIMD trajectories, and n represents the total number of MA/I/Pb particles in the system.

Fig. 7a shows the average standard deviation of the positions for the I/MA/Pb particles in the studied H2O–PMs@MAPbI3 systems. Compared with Py@MAPbI3 and Tpy@MAPbI3, the system of H2O–Bpy@MAPbI3 exhibits the least structural fluctuation on account of moderate bidentate anchoring. In contrast, the introduction of Tpy induces larger atomic fluctuations in the system, especially for the central Pb. Actually, the variation of the central Pb induced by PMs is the original reason for the fluctuations in the system. The position distributions of the central Pb atom over trajectories for the H2O–PMs@MAPbI3 systems are shown in Fig. 7b. The distribution of the central Pb in the Tpy-passivated system is the most scattered, especially in the z direction. Subsequently, the violent fluctuations of the center Pb further trigger structural disorder in the whole system. When combined with snapshots of AIMD simulation for H2O–Tpy@MAPbI3 (Fig. 8), an unexpected phenomenon is observed: at 5 ps, Tpy “pulls up” the central Pb; meanwhile, the I atom also moves away from the surface.

 Fig. 8  Snapshots of AIMD simulations at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 ps for H2O–Tpy@MAPbI3. 
The ‘stripping’ action of undercoordinated lead from perovskite surface by multidentate ligands was also observed in mixed-halide perovskite LEDs by Snaith et al.79 The height of the O atoms shows that H2O molecules begin to diffuse into the perovskite just right at 5 ps for H2O–Tpy@MAPbI3. This occurs because Pb and I atoms detach from the surface at 5 ps, creating a “hole” in the MAPbI3 surface. Subsequently, water has a chance to diffuse from the hole into the deeper region of the perovskite, accompanied by large structural deformation, which is the beginning of degradation.73 This provides an atomic-scale explanation for the experimental observation of the poor humidity stability of Tpy in the early stages. At about 10 ps, independent PbI2–Tpy complexes are formed. It has been reported29 that other pyridine-based ligands – 1,10-phenanthroline – similar to Tpy, can form a complex with PbI2 (PbI2(1,10-phen)x, x = 1, 2), which is beneficial for achieving more stable PSCs. Therefore, we speculate that the PbI2–Tpy complexes on the perovskite surface not only prevent subsequent penetration of water but also promote its moisture resistance, leading to a progressive improvement in stability in the later periods of experimental observation.40
Our calculations show that bidentate PMs are definitely superior to monodentate ones. Too many electronegative atoms may introduce deep trap states, which should be avoided. In addition, more dispersed anchoring sites are beneficial for preventing stripping behavior from the perovskite surface, like Tpy. Therefore, the characteristics of potential PMs would involve multi-site and scattered anchoring, while avoiding too many electronegative atoms.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we investigated the passivation effects of the Lewis bases Py, Bpy, and Tpy on the geometric structures, electronic properties, moisture tolerance, and structural stability of MAPbI3 using DFT calculations combined with AIMD simulations. As a bidentate ligand, Bpy possesses an appropriate adsorption strength, a larger band gap that suppresses electron–hole recombination, and favorable charge transfer. In comparison, the charge transfer and adsorption capacity of Py are slightly insufficient. Although Tpy possesses the strongest charge transfer ability, it creates detrimental deep trap states that result in a reduced carrier lifetime owing to their intensive coordination capacity. In addition, AIMD simulations illustrate that the diffusion of water into the perovskite surface is not observed by the passivation of Bpy; meanwhile, MAPbI3 passivated by Tpy exhibits the most obvious infiltration of water with a rapid trend, even generating independent PbI2–Tpy complexes, weakening moisture resistance. Furthermore, the least position fluctuations of the PMs@MAPbI3 systems are gained by the passivation of Bpy, followed by Py and Tpy. The too intensive coordination capacity of Tpy leads to violent atomic fluctuations, further triggering the collapse of the whole system. Therefore, for the three pyridine-based PMs, the passivation effect is not always positively correlated with the number of ligands or binding ability. The appropriate anchoring capacity plays a key role in the passivation of MAPbI3. Our study not only renders a reasonable explanation for the observations in experiments by highlighting the moderate coordination capacity but also provides valuable insights into the design of preeminent PMs for high-efficiency photoelectric devices.

 	Fig. 1  The structures of PMs in this work.	 

 	Fig. 2  The side and top views of the optimized configurations for PMs@MAPbI3. The yellow transparent circle areas indicate the central Pb. The numbers in red refer to the length (Å) of Pb–N bonds.	 

Bare slab	—	3.17	—
Py@MAPbI3	2.61	3.19	−1.60
Bpy@MAPbI3	2.65	3.23	−2.40
Tpy@MAPbI3	2.63	3.33	−2.63

 	Fig. 3  (a) The charge density difference, Bader charge analysis, and (b) planar-averaged charge density difference for PMs@MAPbI3. The number represents the amount of the Bader charge. The positive value (marked in the yellow rectangular region) suggests charge accumulation, and the negative value (marked in the blue rectangular region) refers to the charge depletion. The isosurface level for the charge density difference is set at 0.001 e per Bohr3.	 

 	Fig. 4  Band structure and projected density of states (PDOS).	 

 	Fig. 5  Variations of the distance between the N atoms in the PMs and the Pb atoms on the perovskite surface for the studied H2O–PMs@MAPbI3 systems.	 

 	Fig. 6  Evolution of the height of the O atoms in water molecules over time.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 7  (a) The average standard deviation of the positions for I/MA/Pb particles, and (b) the position distribution of the central Pb atom over trajectory for the H2O–PMs@MAPbI3 system.	 

 	Fig. 8  Snapshots of AIMD simulations at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 ps for H2O–Tpy@MAPbI3.
