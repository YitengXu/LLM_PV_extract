    , Accepted 14th March 2023First published on 15th March 2023AbstractWide-bandgap (wide-Eg) perovskites with bandgaps over 1.65 eV have great potential for constructing tandem solar cells (TSCs); however, they still suffer from large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficits. Phase segregation and non-radiative recombination are great challenges for inverted wide-Eg perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve an ideal VOC and long-term operation stability. Herein, we report a synergistic strategy of using lead chloride (PbCl2) and phenethylammonium chloride (PMACl) to introduce chlorine (Cl) into a bulk film and form a two-dimensional (2D) phase at the film surface for 1.73 eV wide-Eg PSCs, which reduce the VOC-deficit from 0.558 V to 0.418 V. Cl in PbCl2 enters the crystal lattice of the perovskite film, reducing the halide vacancies and suppressing ion migration. Meanwhile, PMACl facilitates the formation of a 2D perovskite phase at the grain surfaces, alleviating recombination and improving the stability. As a result, the best-performing wide-Eg PSC with a high VOC of 1.312 V and an efficiency of over 20% is achieved, enabling the fabrication of two-terminal all-perovskite TSCs with a champion efficiency of 26.68%. This work provides in-depth insights into how Cl suppresses phase segregation and non-radiative recombination in wide-Eg PSCs, offering a promising strategy for efficient and stable all-perovskite TSCs.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology applications due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low-cost fabrication processes. Currently, the PCE of a single-junction PSC has been boosted to 25.7%, approaching the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit. Constructing an all-perovskite tandem solar cell (TSC) is an effective route to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. However, wide-Eg (>1.65 eV) PSCs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance with large VOC-deficits (defined as Eg/q − VOC, where q is the elementary charge) and inferior stability, which can be related to the phase segregation and non-radiative recombination. Herein, we report a facile dual chloride additive route to fabricate high-quality wide-Eg perovskite absorbers with alleviated non-radiative recombination, suppressed phase segregation, and improved stability through the synergistic effects of lead chloride (PbCl2) and phenethylammonium chloride (PMACl). We also uncover the mechanisms underlying how chlorides suppress the phase segregation and non-radiative recombination in wide-Eg PSCs. At last, high-performance single-junction 1.73 eV wide-Eg PSCs with over 20% efficiencies and VOC-deficits as low as 0.418 V are achieved, enabling the fabrication of all-perovskite TSCs with a champion PCE of 26.68%.

1. Introduction
Organic metal halide perovskites are promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and low-cost solution processability.1,2 Single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained tremendous development in the past decade with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) boosted to the certified value 25.7%.3 Further improving the performance of single-junction PSCs is challenging and limited by the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) radiative efficiency.4
Tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold a higher theoretical efficiency than single-junction cells by reducing thermalization losses.5,6 Perovskites have a wide bandgap tunability from 1.2 to 3.0 eV, which makes them suitable for all-perovskite TSCs.7–10 A typical double-junction TSC usually consists of a wide-Eg top subcell and a low-Eg bottom subcell, which should have matched current densities between the two subcells for a monolithic configuration.11 Currently, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of high-efficiency all-perovskite TSCs has largely increased by the growth of over 1 micrometer thick low-Eg absorber layers.12 However, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of TSCs is still lower than their theoretical limit, which might be ascribed to large voltage losses of the subcells, especially for the top subcell with a large amount of bromine (Br) leading to phase segregation.13,14 The mixture of iodine (I) and Br usually suffers from severe phase segregation and inferior energy level alignment in wide-Eg PSCs, leading to unsatisfactory VOC losses.14–17 Introducing lead chloride (PbCl2) into wide-Eg perovskites to form triple-halide compositions could alleviate the phase segregation, thus significantly improving the VOC and performance of wide-Eg PSCs and their corresponding perovskite/Si tandem cells.18 Therefore, it is highly desired to uncover the roles of chlorine (Cl) in wide-Eg perovskites and reduce the VOC-deficits (defined as Eg/q − VOC, where q is the elementary charge) to further improve the performance of single-junction PSCs and all-perovskite TSCs.
Strategies such as interface passivation and dimensional tailoring have also been proposed to reduce the VOC-deficits in wide-Eg PSCs.17,19–22 Adding a small amount of large organic cations to three-dimensional (3D) perovskites can help form the two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D phases at the grain surface, which could simultaneously eliminate the defects and improve the stability of PSCs.23,24 Organic spacers, such as phenylethylamine (PEA+) and butylammonium (BA+), have been proved to be efficient passivators in perovskite films.25 Several Cl-containing additives, such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and methylammonium chloride (MACl), have also been employed in precursors to enhance the perovskite crystallinity.26,27 However, the passivation effects of chlorides on wide-Eg perovskite films have rarely been investigated, especially in all-perovskite TSCs suffering from large VOC-deficits.
In this work, we report a synergistic strategy of simultaneously incorporating PbCl2 and phenylalkylamine chloride (PMACl) additives into a 1.73 eV wide-Eg perovskite precursor to effectively improve the film quality. Cl in PbCl2 entering the perovskite lattice forms a triple-halide perovskite film with suppressed phase segregation. Meanwhile, PMA+ could effectively reduce the surface defects and improve the film stability with 2D perovskite phases without sacrificing the carrier extraction dynamics. As a result, the highest VOC of 1.312 V is achieved in our 1.73 eV PSCs, delivering a VOC-deficit as low as 0.418 V, which is among the lowest values of wide-Eg PSCs reported so far. These enable the fabrication of two-terminal (2T) all-perovskite TSCs with a champion PCE of 26.68% by integrating an efficient wide-Eg subcell with a low-Eg tin–lead (Sn–Pb) bottom subcell, as well as improved operational stability of remaining 85% of the initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 300 h.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Photovoltaic performance of single-junction wide-Eg PSCs
We introduced chloride additives into the wide-Eg perovskite precursors through compositional engineering with certain amounts of PbCl2, PMACl, and a mixture of PbCl2 and PMACl (referred to as PbCl2 + PMACl). The introduction of chloride additives has little effect on the bandgaps of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), possibly due to the formation of trace amounts of triple halides (I, Br, and Cl) in the final absorber layers.18 Because the bandgap variation is less than 0.005 eV in perovskite films with and without Cl addition, we unified the bandgaps of all perovskites as 1.73 eV.
We first investigated the effects of additive concentration on the film quality and device performance. Single-junction wide-Eg PSCs were prepared with an inverted structure of ITO/PTAA/PFNBr/perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu, where PTAA is poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], PFNBr is poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide, and BCP is bathocuproine. The optimal concentration of PbCl2 and PMACl was 1 mol% for both types of PSCs (Fig. S2–S7 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†).28 We further optimized the PbCl2 + PMACl (with a ratio of 1:1) content in PSCs and obtained the optimal concentration of 1 mol% (Fig. S8–S10 and Table S3, ESI†), because the overdose led to relatively smaller grains with pin-holes and lower photoluminescence (PL) responses (Fig. S11, ESI†).29
The representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of single-junction PSCs with different additives are shown in Fig. 1a and Table S4 (ESI†). The control PSC has a VOC of 1.172 V, a JSC of 18.14 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 81.7%, yielding a PCE of 17.38%. After PbCl2 incorporation, the device has a highly increased FF to 83.2%, leading to a PCE of 18.19% with a VOC of 1.201 V and a JSC of 18.19 mA cm−2. The PMACl device also shows a significant improvement in both VOC and JSC to 1.278 V and 18.55 mA cm−2, respectively, thus leading to a PCE of 19.22%. The PbCl2 + PMACl device merges the advantages of two additives and achieves the highest PCE of 20.22%, along with a VOC of 1.312 V, a JSC of 18.89 mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.6%.

(e) J–V curves of the champion wide-Eg PSC under reverse and forward scans. (f) VOC-deficit values of inverted wide-Eg PSCs with bandgaps ranging from 1.68 to 1.79 eV reported in the literature. 
The statistics of photovoltaic parameters of wide-Eg PSCs with different additives are shown in Fig. 1b and c and summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). It is clear that the VOCs are significantly enhanced after chloride addition. The PbCl2 + PMACl co-modified PSCs exhibit the highest average VOC of 1.301 ± 0.011 V compared to the others, indicating the best film quality with less energy loss. The FF is slightly improved to over 80% for Cl-modified devices. The JSC gradually increases with the order of control, PbCl2, PMACl, and PbCl2 + PMACl, demonstrating improved light absorption. As a result, the synergistic effects of PbCl2 and PMACl boost the overall PCEs of wide-Eg PSCs to 19.83 ± 0.53% (Table S5, ESI†).
The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots and integrated JSC values of four devices are shown in Fig. 1d. The integrated JSCs are consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. It is interesting to notice that the EQE response at the wavelength region from 600 to 700 nm gradually increases after Cl introduction, contributing to the increasing trend of JSC. We attribute this to the better passivation effect of Cl incorporation in perovskite films with fewer defects, especially at the rear interfaces with reduced non-radiative recombination and improved charge collection.30,31

Fig. 1e shows an optimized single-junction wide-Eg PSC presenting negligible hysteresis, and the J–V details of other PSCs are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S4 (ESI†). A power output of 20.1% was recorded using maximum power point (MPP) tracking under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. S13, ESI†). The VOC of the optimized device reaches 1.312 V, leading to a VOC-deficit of 0.418 V, which is among the lowest values for inverted wide-Eg PSCs with bandgaps ranging from 1.68 to 1.79 eV for potential application in all-perovskite TSCs to date (Fig. 1f and Table S6, ESI†).15,17,21,29,32–46
2.2 Morphology and optoelectronic properties of wide-Eg perovskite films
The morphology and optoelectronic properties of wide-Eg perovskite films are scrutinized to unveil the underlying mechanisms for device performance enhancement. Fig. 2a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of four samples. The averaged crystal size is almost the same for the control (173 nm) and PMACl (176 nm) samples, while it becomes slightly larger to 196 and 191 nm for PbCl2 and PbCl2 + PMACl films, respectively (Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the root mean square (RMS) roughness values are 32.8, 35.9, 18.5, and 26.0 nm for the control, PbCl2, PMACl, and PbCl2 + PMACl films, respectively. The PbCl2 film has the largest roughness possibly due to the formation of PbI2 particles at the film surface. The PMACl and PbCl2 + PMACl films have relatively smoother surfaces, which should be ascribed to the surface polishing effect of PMACl triggering the formation of a 2D phase at the film surface.28,31

(f) PL spectra of wide-Eg perovskite films with different additives. 
In order to dig out the fundamental mechanisms of the crystallization and passivation processes, we measured the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films with different additives and concentrations (Fig. 2b and Fig. S17–S19, ESI†). PbCl2 treatment induces the most pronounced peak around 12.8° representing PbI2, consistent with the SEM images with bright particles. We further confirmed the compositions of these bright particles as generated PbI2via energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements (Fig. S17, ESI†). Moreover, the (110) main diffraction peak at around 20° slightly shifts to a larger angle upon more Cl treatments, indicating the shrinkage of the crystal lattice (Fig. S18, ESI†), which should be ascribed to the successful incorporation of Cl into the perovskite framework.47
We speculate that the PMA+ organic cations with a large molecular size are likely inserted into the layered PbX2 (X = I, Br, and Cl) framework, forming 2D phases of (PMA)2An−1PbnX3n+1 at the grain surfaces, where A is FA and Cs; X is I, Br, and Cl; and n is the layer number.48–50 A corresponding schematic of the mechanisms of the 2D phase formation is displayed in Fig. S19 (ESI†). At a low concentration of PMACl, the amount of 2D phase is likely too low to be detected using XRD characterization (Fig. S20, ESI†). By increasing the concentration of different additives, obvious quasi-2D (n = 2, (PMA)2APb2X7) and/or 2D (n = 1, (PMA)2PbX4) phases were obtained in the PMACl-presented films, as shown in Fig. S21 (ESI†). The PbCl2-incorporated films show no 2D peaks, while the PMACl samples show clear quasi-2D (i.e., (PMA)2APb2X7) peaks at higher additive concentrations (>5 mol%), consistent with those in previous reports.51,52 More interestingly, the PbCl2 + PMACl films begin to show the 2D phase ((PMA)2PbX4) at a certain concentration of 5 mol%; however, the 2D phase changes to a quasi-2D phase ((PMA)2APb2X7) with an increase in the PbCl2 + PMACl concentration. Combined with the aforementioned film surface morphology and device performance, we suppose that a thin layer of 2D phase could passivate the defects and improve the device performance, while a thick 2D layer would sacrifice the device efficiency due to insufficient charge transfer dynamics.
We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to check the compositions of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2c, the control film has no signal of Cl, while the others present distinguishable Cl elements, indicating the incorporation of Cl into the target films.53Fig. 2d shows that the Pb 4f peak shifts to the lower energy region after treatments, indicating the reduced defects of uncoordinated Pb ions.12,54 It is easy to form iodine vacancies in the perovskite lattice, while the presence of Br could alleviate the halide defects due to the combination with uncoordinated Pb.55 The introduction of Cl could further reduce the halide vacancies because of the higher electronic negativity.56 Therefore, the combination of triple halides and 2D-phase surfaces simultaneously passivates the traps and inhibits ion migration, leading to improved crystallinity and quality of wide-Eg perovskite films.
Furthermore, in order to detect the location of Cl in the final films, we investigated the cross-sectional distribution profiles of the control and optimal PbCl2 + PMACl films through time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements (Fig. S22, ESI† and Fig. 2e). The control sample has no Cl in the bulk, while for the PbCl2 + PMACl film, Cl distributes in the whole region across the film in the presence of both I and Br, confirming the coexistence of triple halides in the film.18 Moreover, Cl is more prominent at the bottom and top perovskite/charge transporting layer (CTL) interfaces, indicating that Cl is accumulated at two surfaces due to the presence of a large number of defects that are favorable to bond with the additives.27 The presence of Cl at the interface of perovskite/CTLs could further release the lattice strains, thus reducing the defects and suppressing the phase segregation.47
To further confirm the 2D perovskite phases at the film surface, PL spectra were recorded at the short wavelength region around 480 nm (Fig. 2f).22 The control and PbCl2 films show no emission peaks, implying the absence of 2D phases. However, the PMACl and PbCl2 + PMACl films show a characteristic peak, indicating the existence of 2D and quasi-2D perovskites at the grain surfaces or grain boundaries, consistent with the XRD results discussed above.27
PL and transient PL (TRPL) measurements were conducted to investigate the charge dynamics in wide-Eg perovskites upon Cl treatment. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the PbCl2 + PMACl film has the strongest PL intensity and the longest carrier lifetime of 209 ns compared to others, indicating the most suppressed nonradiative recombination and reduced trap density upon the synergistic effects of PMACl and PbCl2. In addition, the carrier lifetimes of PbCl2 and PMACl films are slightly prolonged to 65.2 and 101.9 ns, respectively, compared to the control one of 59.9 ns (Fig. 3b and Table S7, ESI†), suggesting the insufficient passivation by solely chloride addition.

(c) J–V curves of electron-only devices with different additives based on the SCLC protocol. (d–g) PL mapping images of wide-Eg perovskite films upon different treatments. 
Since wide-Eg perovskites are vulnerable to phase segregation, we further monitored the phase stability of films with different additives upon aging. The PL spectra of four samples after 10 days of storage are shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†). The control sample shows obvious phase separation with two emission peaks, which should be ascribed to the segregated I-rich and Br-rich phases.57 Although PbCl2 or PMACl individually added film has a relatively higher PL intensity than the control one (Fig. S23a, ESI†), they still suffer from halide separation with two distinguishable emission peaks at 717 and 758 nm (Fig. S23b, ESI†), possibly triggered by halide vacancies and ion migration.18,57 Meanwhile, the PbCl2 + PMACl film shows negligible phase segregation with just one peak. We attribute the suppressed phase segregation to the effective passivation of dual chlorides, making them less vulnerable to ion migration.43,55
Moreover, we used the space charge limited current (SCLC) characterization to evaluate the trap density in perovskite films based on the electron-only devices with the structure ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Cu. The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) value of 0.867 V for the PbCl2 + PMACl device is the smallest compared to the others, implying the lowest trap density in the optimized wide-Eg films upon dual chloride addition.58 The SCLC measurements of the hole-only devices also confirmed the lowest defect level in the PbCl2 + PMACl film (Fig. S24, ESI†), since they show a similar trend of VTFL values to that of electron-only devices. Fig. S25 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of PSCs with different additives under dark conditions. The PbCl2 + PMACl device has the lowest dark current, indicating reduced current leakage.59,60
We further conducted the PL mapping to investigate the surface homogeneity of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3d–g. Perovskite films with homogeneous surfaces have retarded phase transitions due to suppressed elementary aggregation.61 The control film without any additive shows the lowest response with nonuniformity, indicating the severe nonradiative recombination of charge carriers and inferior film homogeneity.29 Both PbCl2 and PMACl films show relatively brighter emission color, indicating improved film quality with reduced defects.53 However, they still have dark regions at the film surface, indicating compositional inhomogeneity, which is detrimental to the phase stability. On the other hand, the PbCl2 + PMACl film shows the brightest color and a more homogeneous surface, implying the best film quality with uniform elementary distribution, fewer defects, and suppressed nonradiative recombination.62
2.3 Charge transfer dynamics and stability of wide-Eg perovskite films and devices

Fig. 4a shows the Mott–Schottky plots extracted from the capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements for wide-Eg PSCs.63 The PbCl2 + PMACl device has a relatively higher built-in voltage of 0.875 V than the control (0.674 V), PbCl2 (0.683 V), and PMACl (0.859 V) devices, indicating the highest built-in potential that favors charge separation and transportation. This is consistent with the VOC trend. These results indicate that the synergistic effects of two additives reduce the defects and improve the charge transfer dynamics.62

(b) VOC and (c) JSC of wide-Eg PSCs as a function of light intensity. (d) Nyquist plots of wide-Eg PSCs with different additives. (e) Normalized PCEs versus time under MPP tracking at 1 sun illumination for wide-Eg PSCs with different additives. The devices without encapsulation were measured under 100 mW cm−2 with a LED light source and under inert conditions. (f) Color evolution images of wide-Eg perovskite films with different treatments aged for 180 days under ambient conditions. 
We also characterized the light intensity dependence of VOC and JSC to investigate the charge recombination and transfer in wide-Eg PSCs. The VOC plots of PSCs as a function of light intensity are depicted in Fig. 4b. The VOC follows a linear relationship with the logarithmic light intensity according to VOC = (nkBT/q)ln(I/I0 + 1), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and n is the ideal factor. The n values are calculated to be 1.46, 1.38, 1.27, and 1.19 for the control, PbCl2, PMACl, and PbCl2 + PMACl devices, respectively. The smallest n value for the PbCl2 + PMACl device suggests the lowest Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination,64 in good agreement with the reduced trap density and prolonged carrier lifetime as mentioned above. The JSC plots as a function of light intensity are depicted in Fig. 4c. The JSC follows a linear relationship with Iα, where I is the light intensity. The control PSC has an α of 0.937, while the PbCl2 device and the PMACl device have higher values of 0.969 and 0.984, respectively. The PbCl2 + PMACl device has the highest value of 0.993 close to 1, indicating the largely reduced space charge limited current.65
Electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra were further scrutinized to investigate the charge transfer dynamics in PSCs (Fig. 4d), and an equivalent fitting circuit is shown in Fig. S26 (ESI†). A larger semicircle of the Nyquist plot indicates a bigger recombination resistance.30 The PbCl2 + PMACl target device has the largest semicircle compared to the others, indicating fluent charge transfer with less nonradiative recombination.63

Fig. 4e shows the power outputs of wide-Eg PSCs measured using MPP tracking in a glovebox under 1 sun illumination. The control device shows a sharp performance degradation with only 65% of its initial efficiency retained after 270 h. The PbCl2 device and the PMACl device retained 71% and 81% of their original values, respectively. The PbCl2 + PMACl target device showed an enhanced operational stability of retaining 90% of its initial efficiency after 270 h of illumination. Such operational stability is comparable with those reported ones of wide-Eg PSCs with mixed halides.61 The improved stability should be ascribed to the suppressed defects and phase segregation of the perovskite film with dual Cl additives incorporated.66
We further monitored the long-term stability of wide-Eg perovskite films upon ambient exposure for 180 days with a relative humidity of around 60% and a temperature of about 20 °C (Fig. 4f). The control device and the PbCl2 device showed fast degradation that decomposed to white color within 90 days, indicating the inferior stability vulnerable to moisture and oxygen. However, the PMACl device and the PbCl2 + PMACl device retain dark color with negligible change after 180 days of exposure, possibly due to the presence of a thin layer of 2D perovskites, which could effectively impede the permeation of moisture and oxygen and thus inhibit the decomposition of perovskites.67 This is also evidenced by the well-maintained compact film surface and sharp absorption onset around 730 nm of the PMACl and PbCl2 + PMACl films (Fig. S27 and S28, ESI†), indicating the well-remaining perovskite phase. These results further confirm the important role of 2D perovskite passivation in improving the film quality with reduced trap density and increased stability.66 We also checked the long-term stability of wide-Eg PSCs in the N2-filled glovebox (Fig. S29, ESI†). The PbCl2 + PMACl device retains 89% of its original efficiency after 135 days of shelf storage under an N2 atmosphere.
2.4 Photovoltaic performance of 2T all-perovskite TSCs
We prepared 2T all-perovskite TSCs with the architecture ITO/PTAA/PFNBr/wide-Eg perovskite/C60/SnO2/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/low-Eg perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu, relying on the optimized wide-Eg perovskite subcells paired with the 1.25 eV low-Eg Sn–Pb bottom subcells, where PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate. The photovoltaic performance of single-junction low-Eg PSCs is shown in Fig. S30 (ESI†). A schematic illustration of the TSC structure and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. Our 2T all-perovskite TSCs have a champion efficiency of 26.68 (26.64)%, with a VOC of 2.115 (2.107) V, a JSC of 15.29 (15.41) mA cm−2, and a FF of 82.5 (82.1)% under reverse (forward) scans. However, the control TSC presents a relatively lower performance of 25.14 (24.98)%, with a VOC of 2.041 (2.039) V, a JSC of 15.13 (15.10) mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.4 (81.1)% under reverse (forward) scans (Fig. 5c).

(c) J–V curves of the control and PbCl2 + PMACl 2T TSCs measured under reverse and forward voltage scans. (d) EQE spectra of the top and bottom subcells in the control and PbCl2 + PMACl 2T TSCs. (e) Power outputs for the control and PbCl2 + PMACl 2T TSCs by MPP tracking. (f) PCE histograms of the control and PbCl2 + PMACl 2T TSCs (40 devices in count). (g) Normalized PCEs under MPP tracking for the control and PbCl2 + PMACl 2T TSCs. The devices without encapsulation were measured under inert conditions and under 100 mW cm−2 illumination with a LED light source. 
The EQE-integrated JSCs of the corresponding top and bottom subcells in an optimized TSC are 15.7 mA cm−2 and 15.0 mA cm−2, respectively, showing a higher current density than the control one (Fig. 5d). As shown in Fig. 5e, the 2T all-perovskite TSC exhibits a stabilized PCE of 26.6% measured by MPP tracking, which is among the state-of-the-art all-perovskite TSCs.12,13,51,68 The control one presents an inferior PCE of 25.0%. Moreover, our 2T all-perovskite TSCs are reproducible with an averaged PCE of 25.85 ± 0.84% upon PbCl2 + PMACl treatments, while the control TSCs have an averaged PCE only of 24.13 ± 0.97% (Fig. 5f).
We further tested the operational stability of our 2T TSCs under continuous 1 sun illumination in a glovebox, as shown in Fig. 5g. The unencapsulated PbCl2 + PMACl TSC presents improved stability of retaining 85% of its original PCE after 300 h, while the control one declines to around 72% after 280 h. The improved operational stability of the PbCl2 + PMACl tandem device can be related to the reduced trap density and suppressed phase segregation in the wide-Eg perovskite subcell.
3. Conclusion
We have uncovered the synergistic effects of PbCl2 and PMACl on improving the performance of wide-Eg PSCs as precursor additives. PbCl2 + PMACl facilitates the formation of triple halide compositions and leads to the 2D perovskite phase, thus reducing halide vacancies and suppressing phase segregation, which finally enhances the operational and long-term stability of the corresponding PSCs. 1.73 eV wide-Eg PSCs with a champion VOC of 1.312 V were obtained, presenting a VOC-deficit as low as 0.418 V, which is among the lowest values for inverted wide-Eg PSCs reported so far. Moreover, 2T all-perovskite TSCs achieve a champion PCE of 26.68% and an excellent stability of 85% upon MPP tracking for 300 h. Our strategy provides a facile way for fabricating high-performance wide-Eg PSCs and all-perovskite TSCs with reduced defects and suppressed phase segregation.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology applications due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low-cost fabrication processes. Currently, the PCE of a single-junction PSC has been boosted to 25.7%, approaching the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit. Constructing an all-perovskite tandem solar cell (TSC) is an effective route to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. However, wide-Eg (>1.65 eV) PSCs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance with large VOC-deficits (defined as Eg/q − VOC, where q is the elementary charge) and inferior stability, which can be related to the phase segregation and non-radiative recombination. Herein, we report a facile dual chloride additive route to fabricate high-quality wide-Eg perovskite absorbers with alleviated non-radiative recombination, suppressed phase segregation, and improved stability through the synergistic effects of lead chloride (PbCl2) and phenethylammonium chloride (PMACl). We also uncover the mechanisms underlying how chlorides suppress the phase segregation and non-radiative recombination in wide-Eg PSCs. At last, high-performance single-junction 1.73 eV wide-Eg PSCs with over 20% efficiencies and VOC-deficits as low as 0.418 V are achieved, enabling the fabrication of all-perovskite TSCs with a champion PCE of 26.68%.
