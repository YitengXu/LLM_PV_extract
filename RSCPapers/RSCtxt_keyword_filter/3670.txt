    , Accepted 28th November 2021First published on 29th November 2021AbstractHerein, two simple polymers PFO3 and PFO4 based on furan-3-carboxylate and 3-alkylfuran are developed. PFO3 and PFO4 feature high hole mobility, large dielectric constant and good solubility. Compared to PFO4, PFO3 with shorter oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chains demonstrates a larger absorption coefficient and deeper electronic energy level. The air- and ethanol/water-processed OSCs based on the PFO4:fullerene derivative (PCBO-12) show a modest efficiency of 2.06%. However, PFO3:PCBO-12 OSCs yield a higher efficiency of 3.03% due to the simultaneously enhanced photovoltaic parameters. PFO3- and PFO4-based devices retain 64.5% and 51.2% of their initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 200 h in an inert atmosphere, respectively. Surprisingly, the retained efficiency ratio is increased to 81.6% and 69.1% for PFO3- and PFO4-based devices suffering from discontinuous illumination yet with the same soaking time of 200 h in an inert atmosphere. However, the above phenomenon is not observed for three other photovoltaic systems without abundant OEG groups when adopting discontinuous illumination. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy unravel that the repair efficiency of PFO3- or PFO4-based devices should have resulted from the self-healing of hydrogen bonds in the photoactive layer. Our work will provide guidance for the future design of donor polymers for eco-friendly OSCs featuring high stability.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are one of the most promising renewable energy conversion technologies, which is ascribed to their superior advantages, i.e., light weight, abundant raw materials, and great potential for high throughput production via roll-to-roll technology.1,2 Particularly, OSCs have achieved great progress in terms of device efficiency, which is even comparable with those of their inorganic counterparts.3,4 However, besides the device efficiency, other critical issues of OSCs are paid less attention such as materials cost and benign processing engineering, which also play important roles in the commercialization of OSCs.5
Up to now, the photoactive layer of the-state-of-art OSCs mainly adopted a bulk-heterojunction structure, which is homogeneously composed of a p-type polymer donor and an n-type small molecule acceptor.6,7 It is noted that these efficient photovoltaic materials always consist of multi-fused-ring building blocks, which need tedious synthetic procedures and complex post-purification.8 Obviously, the increasing synthetic complexity and materials cost (>1000 $ g−1) of these efficient photovoltaic materials would be a great hurdle for the large-scale production of OSCs.9,10 Hence, developing simple yet efficient polymers is highly significant for the mass production of OSCs.
Also, high performance OSCs always need halogenated solvents to be processed, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc.11,12 It is noteworthy that those halogenated solvents are not natural in their origin, needing relatively high cost and energy to produce, store and dispose, which is not in accordance with the concept of atomic economy and green chemistry.13 Meanwhile, those halogenated solvents are strictly restricted in most of the countries because they are highly toxic and can cause great harm to human health and the environment (Table S1, ESI†).14–16 In spite of some halogen-free solvents, i.e., toluene, o-xylene, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) having been proposed to replace these halogenated solvents to fabricate OSCs, the reported halogen-free solvents are still inherently toxic and could also pose a threat to people's health (Table S1, ESI†).17–20 Meanwhile, most of these reported halogen-free solvents are also strictly restricted in the semiconductor industry.21 Therefore, developing OSCs that can be processed with truly environmentally benign solvents is greatly indispensable for environmental protection and sustainable development of OSCs.22
Indisputably, water and alcohol are considered as the most promising truly environmentally benign solvents.23,24 To date, some effort has been dedicated to developing photovoltaic materials to fabricate OSCs processed via water or alcohol.25–28 Krebs et al. developed a water-soluble polymer analogous to poly(3-hexylthiophene), and applied aqueous processing to fabricate the corresponding OSCs, which demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.70%. Besides, Woo and Kim et al. reported a benzothiadiazole-based polymer (PPDT2FBT-A) and pointed that PPDT2FBT-A-based OSCs processed via ethanol presented a modest PCE of 0.75%.29 Recently, Woo and Kim et al. further improved the efficiency of OSCs processed via an ethanol/water mixture to 2.51% by optimizing the morphology of photovoltaic layer and developing innovative device engineering techniques.30–32 In spite of the efficiency of OSCs processed with nontoxic solvent being gradually improved, the recorded PCE of the eco-friendly OSCs is still far from satisfactory compared to the OSCs processed via toxic solvents. Therefore, developing novel yet efficient water/alcohol-soluble polymers or innovative new device engineering techniques is highly desired for improving the efficiency of eco-friendly OSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized two simple furan-based polymers PFO3 and PFO4 via grafting of oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chains. PFO3 and PFO4 present good solubility, large dielectric constant, and high hole mobility. However, PFO3 with shorter side chains shows a larger absorption coefficient and deeper electronic energy level than PFO4. Benefiting from those merits, the air- and ethanol/water-processed OSCs based on the PFO3:fullerene derivative (PCBO-12) deliver a PCE of 3.03%, an increase of 47.1% versus PFO4-based devices. PFO3- and PFO4-based devices retain 64.5% and 51.2% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 200 h in an inert atmosphere, respectively. Intriguingly, the retained PCE ratio is increased to 81.6% and 69.1% for PFO3- and PFO4-based devices via discontinuous illumination but with the same soaking time of 200 h in an inert atmosphere. However, the above phenomenon is not observed for the other three photovoltaic systems without abundant OEG groups when adopting discontinuous illumination. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal that the partial self-healing of hydrogen bonds in photoactive layer is responsible for the repaired PCE of PFO3- or PFO4-based devices.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route of PFO3 and PFO4 is outlined in Scheme 1, and the detailed procedures are displayed in the ESI.† As shown, PFO3 and PFO4 were synthesized via five-step procedures, using commercial and cost-effective raw materials. Additionally, each procedure of PFO3 and PFO4 presented a high yield exceeding 80%. The inexpensive raw materials, facile synthetic procedures and high yield enable a low material cost of 44.83 $ g−1 and 44.55 $ g−1 for PFO3 and PFO4 (Tables S2–S4, ESI†), respectively, which are much lower than those of fused-ring copolymers and demonstrate high potential for large-scale production.33 Moreover, the molecular structures of PFO3 and PFO4 were confirmed by GPC, 1H-NMR, FTIR and elemental analysis (Fig. S1–S6, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PFO3 and PFO4 are 13.2 kDa/1.83 and 11.5 kDa/1.75, respectively. Two new polymers not only show good solubility in common solvents, i.e., chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, but also demonstrate good solubility (>5 mg mL−1) in ethanol benefiting from the synergetic effect of the OEG polar solubilizing group and the furan building block.34,35 Beyond that, PFO3 and PFO4 display good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (5% weight losses) over 240 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†), which sufficiently enables them for the fabrication of OSCs.

Theoretical calculation
To firstly provide insight into the difference between PFO3 and PFO4 in terms of molecular structure and energy level, density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G* level was performed, where the polymers are simplified via adopting their dimer model. It is noticed that PFO3 and PFO4 present a small backbone torsion with an average dihedral angle of less than 9.5° (top view, Fig. S8, ESI†), which enables them with an almost linear backbone (side view, Fig. 1). The large conjugated backbone should originate from the synergetic effect of the small volume of furan units and the non-covalent interaction between oxygen and hydrogen (O·····H) existing in the backbone.36–38 Note that the electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PFO3 and PFO4 is mainly delocalized along their molecular backbone, which is favorable for charge transport. Compared to PFO4, both the HOMO level and the LUMO level of FFO3 down-shift, which is ascribed to relatively shorter side chains which have less electron-donating capability on the acceptor part of PFO3 versus PFO4.30 Therefore, a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) could be anticipated for PFO3-based devices.39

Optical and electronic properties
The absorption spectra of PFO3 and PFO4 in ethanol and the film state are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Fig. 2a. Note that PFO4 in ethanol presents a featureless absorption profile along with maximum absorption peaks (λmax) located at 571 nm. However, PFO3 with shorter OEG side chains depicts a red-shift of λmax (596 nm) accompanied by a distinguished shoulder peak appearing at 540 nm. Besides, PFO3 in ethanol depicts a higher absorption coefficient (4.1 × 104 M cm−1) than that of PFO4 (2.9 × 104 M cm−1), which should be attributed to the relatively larger Mn and better conjugated plane of the former, and is beneficial to for harvesting more solar photons as well as improving the current density of the derived OSCs.40 Compared to the absorption in solution, the λmax values of PFO3 and PFO4 in the film state exhibit a bathochromic-shift of about 12 nm and 15 nm, respectively, which is due to enhanced intermolecular interaction and intensified π–π stacking in the film state.41 It is pointed out that a distinguishable vibrionic shoulder peak at 557 nm could be observed for PFO3, which is resulted from molecular aggregation.42 The optical bandgap (Eopt) of PFO3 and PFO4 could be deduced from their absorption onset in the film state, corresponding to 1.89 eV and 1.90 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of PFO3 and PFO4 were investigated via cyclic voltammetry measurements. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the oxidation potentials of PFO3 and PFO4 shift toward higher voltage with values of 0.72 V and 0.61 V in comparison with that of ferrocene (0.21 V), which could deduce the derived HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of −5.31 eV and −5.20 eV for PFO3 and PFO4 (Fig. 2b), respectively, according to the reported method.36 The trend of EHOMO of PFO3 and PFO4 agrees well with the results of DFT calculations. Besides, the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) of PFO3 and PFO4 could be calculated via the equation, ELUMO = EHOMO + Eopt. And the derived ELUMO is −3.42 eV and −3.30 eV for PFO3 and PFO4, respectively. Note that PFO3 grafted with shorter OEG side chains demonstrates deeper ELUMO and EHOMO than PFO4 with longer OEG side chains, which should be attributed to the stronger electron-withdrawing characteristics of the acceptor building block in PFO3 versus that of PFO4 and in favour of obtaining a larger Voc for the corresponding devices.43 As displayed in Fig. 2b, the monoadduct fullerene derivative featuring oligoethylene glycol side chains (PCBO-12, Fig. S11, ESI†) presents a matched energy level (ELUMO = −3.86 eV, EHOMO = −5.71 eV) with PFO3 and PFO4, where the EHOMO offset and ELUMO offset between PFO3 or PFO4 and PCBO-12 both surpass 0.30 eV, resulting in enough driving force for exciton dissociation and charge transfer.44
As shown in Fig. 2c and d, PFO3 and PFO4 present negative surface electrostatic potential (ESP) values along the conjugated backbone, suggesting that PFO3 and PFO4 show typically electron-donating characteristics. Beyond that, a large dipole moment of 6.78 D and 9.83 D could be found for PFO3 and PFO4, respectively. Meanwhile, PFO3 and PFO4 also exhibit a high relative dielectric constant (εr) with average values of 4.49 and 4.83, respectively (Fig. 2e). The large dipole moment and high εr of PFO3 and PFO4 should be attributed to the long OEG side chains featuring many polarized C–O units, which is similar to the work reported by Wang et al.43 The proficient electronic properties of PFO3 and PFO4 impart them with hole mobilities of 7.90 × 10−5 and 9.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1·s (Fig. 2f and Fig. S12, ESI†), which are higher than those of their analogue polymers without OEG groups.45
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of PFO3 and PFO4 were assessed in inverted OSCs with a device configuration of ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a), where PFO3 or PFO4 and PCBO-12 were adopted as the electron donor and the electron acceptor in the photoactive layer, respectively. It is pointed out that the photoactive layer in this work could be simultaneously processed in air and via ethanol/water mixture, which not only gets rid of the dependence on the glovebox, but also reduces the production cost of OSCs. More importantly, the whole fabrication process of devices is benign to both operators and the environment. The details of the device fabrication are shown in SI. When light-soaked under AM1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of devices obtained are depicted in Fig. 3b, c and Fig. S13–S18 (ESI†), and the photovoltaic parameters of optimized devices are summarized in Table 1.

It is noted that the device processed via only ethanol showed a negligible PCE with very low short-shirt current density (Jsc) approaching zero. The origin of the device being out of gear is ascribed to the poor morphology (Fig. S19, ESI†), which should be due to the high volatility of ethanol. After applying the ethanol/water mixture (85:15, by volume) to process the photoactive layer, the efficiency of derived devices could be improved. As exhibited in Fig. 3b, the optimized device based on PFO4:PCBO-12 presents a Voc of 0.661 V, a Jsc of 5.12 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 60.9%, respectively, which endows a modest PCE of 2.06%. In contrast, the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized device based on PFO3:PCBO-12 are improved to 0.716 V, 6.50 mA cm−2 and 65.1%, respectively, which yield a higher PCE of 3.03%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 3.03% should be the highest value of OSCs processed with water/alcohol as the solvent (Table 2).29–32

Note that the higher Voc of the PFO3-based device is originated from the deeper EHOMO of PFO3 versus PFO4, and the increased Jsc of PFO3-based device should partially result from the stronger light-harvesting capability of PFO3 relative to PFO4. Meanwhile, the stronger IPCE spectrum of the PFO3-based device than that of PFO4-based device indicates the efficient charge transport and extraction in the former. In addition, the Jsc values integrated from the IPCE spectra are 5.95 and 4.98 mA cm−2, respectively, for PFO3- and PFO4-based devices, which coincides with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements with acceptable deviation.
Charge dynamics
To gain insight into the effect of charge dynamics on the efficiency of optimized devices, a series of characterization studies were performed. As shown in Fig. 4a, the transient photocurrent (TPC) spectrum of PFO3:PCBO-12 devices displays a more efficient charge extraction evaluated from a smaller photocurrent decay lifetime of 0.17 μs, while the corresponding values increase to 0.39 μs for the PFO4:PCBO-12 devices. Furthermore, the dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Plight) was studied, where Jsc and Plight generally follow a power-law correlation of Jsc ∝ Plightα, and the exponent α value could approach 1 if bimolecular recombination is negligible in devices.46 Note that PFO3:PCBO-12 devices display a suitable α (0.99) closer to 1 compared to that of α of the PFO4:PCBO-12 devices (1.07) in Fig. 4b, indicating that bimolecular recombination is relatively suppressed in the former. The more efficient charge extraction as well as weaker bimolecular recombination of PFO3:PCBO-12 devices should be ascribed to the proficient charge transport, which is confirmed by the more balanced and faster charge mobilities of PFO3:PCBO-12 devices versus that of the PFO4:PCBO-12 devices (Fig. 4c, Fig. S20, ESI† and Table 1).
 Fig. 4  (a) TPC spectra of optimized devices; (b) Plight dependence of Jsc of optimized devices; (c) charge mobility of optimized devices; (d) TPV spectra of optimized devices; (e) Plight dependence of Voc of optimized devices, where their relationship follows the equation Voc ∝ n(kT/q) lnPlight, where n, k, T, and q represent the ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively. In general, the slope of n(kT/q) approaches kT/q when trap-assisted recombination is suppressed; and (f) Jphversus Veff of optimized devices. 
In addition, the transient photovoltage (TPV) spectrum demonstrates a prolonged lifetime of 4.96 μs for PFO3:PCBO-12 devices (Fig. 4d). However, the lifetime dramatically decreases to 1.91 μs for PFO4:PCBO-12 devices, revealing there is serious charge recombination in PFO4:PCBO-12 devices. Furthermore, a larger ideality factor n of 1.94 for PFO4:PCBO-12 devices demonstrates that the trap-assisted charge recombination is more serious than that in PFO3:PCBO-12 devices (n = 1.62).
To further obtain insight into the difference of charge dynamics in two optimized devices, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of optimized devices was measured. As exhibited in Fig. 4f, the Jph of PFO3:PCBO-12 devices can reach saturation (Jsat) of 7.24 mA cm−2 at low Veff, which endows a large exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of 89.8%.47 In contrast, the Jph of PFO4:PCBO-12 devices cannot reach Jsat even at higher Veff, resulting in a lower Pdiss of 74.5% for derived devices, which implies that the dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free charge carriers and then the collection by the corresponding electrodes in PFO4:PCBO-12 devices is inferior to that of the PFO3:PCBO-12 devices. As a result, the proficient charge dynamics of PFO3:PCBO-12 devices should be responsible for its higher Jsc and FF.
Morphological properties
To evaluate the influence of the morphology of the photoactive layer on the charge dynamics of optimized devices, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were conducted. As displayed in Fig. 5a, the PFO3:PCBO-12 film shows a distinct phase separation featuring a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with a suitable domain size of ∼10 nm. In contrast, the PFO4:PCBO-12 film displays a homogeneous morphology but without obvious phase separation (Fig. 5d), which should be ascribed to the better miscibility between PFO4 and PCBO-12. Moreover, some island distribution could be observed for the PFO3:PCBO-12 film (Fig. 5b), leading to a rough surface with a large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.35 nm (Fig. 5c), which correlates with the higher molecular crystallinity in systems (discussed later). However, the PFO4:PCBO-12 film exhibits a featureless surface morphology with a small RMS roughness of 1.46 nm (Fig. 5e and f), which also confirms the better miscibility between PFO4 and PCBO-12. The inferior morphology of the PFO4:PCBO-12 film should be responsible for the inefficient exciton dissociation and charge transport as well as the serious charge recombination in devices.

As shown in Fig. 6, in spite of displaying the identical GIWAXS patterns and profiles, the PFO3:PCBO-12 film presents stronger diffraction peaks along the in-plane and out-of-plane direction than the PFO4:PCBO-12 film. Beyond that, the lamellar diffraction peak (100) along the in-plane and the π–π stacking peak (010) in the out-of-plane of the PFO4:PCBO-12 film are found at 0.19 Å−1 and 2.00 Å−1, which correspond to the lamellar spacing and π–π spacing of 33.1 Å and 3.14 Å, respectively. Compared to the PFO4:PCBO-12 film, the corresponding (100) peak and the (010) peak shift toward larger values of 0.21 Å−1 and 2.05 Å−1 for the PFO3:PCBO-12 film, which results in the reduced lamellar spacing and π–π spacing of 29.9 Å and 3.06 Å, respectively. The results of GIWAXS confirm the higher molecular crystallinity and stronger intermolecular interaction of the PFO3:PCBO-12 film versus the PFO4:PCBO-12 film, which has a positive effect on the improved charge dynamics and the efficiency of derived devices. It is also noted that the π–π spacing of two optimized film is shorter than other reported photovoltaic systems, which should be ascribed to the abundant hydrogen bonds strengthening the intermolecular interaction of PFO3 or PFO4:PCBO-12 systems.48

Device stability
The stability of devices under operational conditions should be evaluated for its importance in the commercialization of OSCs. As shown in Fig. 7a, PFO3-based devices present a degeneration with 64.5% of their initial efficiency being retained after continuous light-soaking for 200 h in an inert atmosphere while the corresponding value of PFO4-based devices declines to 51.2% of their initial efficiency, which should be partially attributed to the relatively lower thermal stability as well as more facile oxidation of PFO4 for its shallower EHOMOversus that of PFO3.49 Moreover, PFO3-based devices could also demonstrate stronger stability than PFO4-based ones in a highly humid environment (relative humidity of ∼60%, Fig. S21, ESI†), which should be due to the weaker hydrophilicity of PFO3 for its relatively shorter OEG side chains.

Interestingly, the PCE of PFO3- or PFO4-based devices is partially repaired when suffering from discontinuous illumination with five intervals of 50 h out-of-gear under darkness (Fig. 7b and Fig. S21, ESI†). And the derived PCE of PFO3- or PFO4-based devices could approach 81.6% and 69.1% of their initial efficiency, respectively. To our surprise, this phenomenon is not observed in the other three different photovoltaic systems without abundant OEG side chains (Fig. 7c, Fig. S22, S23 and Table S5, ESI†).
To better understand the origin of the repaired efficiency, TEM, IR and XPS were implemented to study the variation of morphology and the chemical structure of the PFO3:PCBO-12 film under different conditions. Moreover, for eliminating the influence of the residual water, the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film was dried under high vacuum conditions (10−5 Pa) overnight before measurement.
As exhibited in Fig. 8a d, the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film presents a nano-scale interpenetrating network. And an intense and broad peak located at 3400–3500 cm−1 could be observed for the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film (Fig. 8c f). It is noted that the abovementioned strong peak could also be found for the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film when prepared via chloroform (Fig. S24, ESI†). Moreover, three O peaks of the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film can be found at the binding energy of 531.0 eV, 532.3 eV, and 535.4 eV (Fig. S25, ESI† and Fig. 8j), which corresponds to the C–O, O–H, CO groups existing in the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film, respectively.50,51 Therefore, the peak at 3400–3500 cm−1 should be only attributed to hydrogen bonds in systems rather than the residual water especially considering that the pristine PFO3:PCBO-12 film has been dried under high vacuum conditions (10−5 Pa) overnight before measurement.52

As shown in Fig. 8b, some large aggregation with the domain size exceeding 50 nm could be observed for the aged PFO3:PCBO-12 film after continuous light-soaking (aged CLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film) for 200 h in an inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, the peak intensity of the aged CLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film at 3400–3500 cm−1 is dramatically reduced by 53.2% compared to that of its pristine film. Furthermore, the intensity of the O peak corresponding to the O–H group in the aged CLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film is highly reduced relative to the pristine film (Fig. 8i). The variation of the PFO3:PCBO-12 film with continuous light-soaking should be due to the destruction of hydrogen bonds and then the aggregation of PCBO-12 in systems, and this process could be described as shown in Scheme 2a.53

In contrast, the aged PFO3:PCBO-12 film after discontinuous light-soaking but still with the same light-soaking of 200 h (aged DCLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film) in an inert atmosphere only presents slightly increased phase separation with a domain size of less than 20 nm (Fig. 8e), and still displays a strong peak of hydrogen bonds only dropping by 15.4% compared to its pristine film (Fig. 8f). As exhibited in Fig. 8h, the intensity of the O peak corresponding to the O–H group in the aged DCLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film is somewhat reduced relative to the pristine film. However, the intensity of the O peak corresponding to the O–H group in the aged DCLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film is still stronger than that of the aged CLS-PFO3:PCBO-12 film. Therefore, the change of the PFO3:PCBO-12 film with discontinuous light-soaking should be ascribed to the self-healing of hydrogen bonds and then the inhibition of the aggregation of PCBO-12 in systems, and the process is described in Scheme 2b.
3. Conclusions
In summary, two simple furan-based polymers PFO3 and PFO4 grafting oligoethylene glycol side chains were designed and synthesized. PFO3 and PFO4 feature facile synthesis, high hole mobility, large dielectric constant and good solubility. However, PFO3 with shorter side chains shows a larger absorption coefficient and deeper electronic energy level than PFO4. Consequently, the air- and ethanol/water-processed OSCs based on the PFO3:fullerene derivative (PCBO-12) deliver a higher PCE of 3.03%, increasing by 47.1% relative to PFO4-based devices. PFO3- and PFO4-based devices retain 64.5% and 51.2% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 200 h in an inert atmosphere. Interestingly, the retained PCE ratio could be increased to 81.6% and 69.1% for PFO3- and PFO4-based devices suffering from discontinuous illumination yet with the same soaking time of 200 h in an inert atmosphere, respectively, which is due to the partial self-healing of hydrogen bonds in the photoactive layer. Our work could offer guidance for the future design of donor polymers for eco-friendly OSCs with high stability.
