1. Introduction
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are becoming an alternative to the traditional display and illumination devices owing to their excellent characteristics, including high efficiency, high brightness, great color saturation and tunable color gamut. Among LEDs, quantum dot LEDs (QLEDs) based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have drawn much attention and have been commercialized by some companies, such as Samsung (South Korea) and TCL (P. R. China). However, the synthesis of the traditional core–shell Cd-based QDs requires a harsh chemical environment and complicated procedures, which limits the practical application of QLEDs. On the other hand, the high toxicity of Cd-based materials and devices is an inevitable obstacle for the commercialization.
Recently, great attention has been paid to metal halide perovskite materials and their applications in various optoelectronic fields, such as LEDs,1–4 solar cells,5–7 lasers8–10 and photodetectors.11,12 Especially, the emergence of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (MPbX3 NCs, M = CH3NH3 (MA), CH3(NH2)2 (FA), Cs, X = Cl, Br, I) offers new opportunities for next-generation luminescent materials. What is more, these direct bandgap semiconductor NCs have some intrinsic advantages, such as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching unity, narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 12–40 nm, long exciton diffusion length and high carrier mobility. In comparison with organic–inorganic lead halide (MAPbX3 and FAPbX3) NCs, all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs exhibit even better performance regarding thermal stability, which is a great feature for their applications.13–15 The higher stability of CsPbX3 than that of organic–inorganic lead halides can be ascribed to the high thermal decomposition temperature endowed by inorganic cations. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted into the preparation and application of CsPbX3 NCs since the first successful synthesis by Kovalenko's group in 2015.16 In the same year, Zeng's group17 used these materials to fabricate LEDs. Since then, a new era of QLEDs has been launched. The highest efficiency of electricity-driven LEDs has been updated every year, as shown in Fig. 1, which makes the practical application possible. However, it must be clearly noted that the efficiency and stability of CsPbX3 NCs and the LEDs based on them should be further improved to meet the requirement for commercialization in the future. In this review article, we focus on CsPbX3 NCs and their performance in LED industry. The first part introduces the physicochemical properties, synthesis and passivation approaches of CsPbX3 NCs and the structures of LEDs. In the second section, we discuss the modification of emitting layers to achieve highly efficient and stable CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs. The third section presents the optimization of structures in the LEDs. Lastly, we provide an outlook from our point of view of the possible future advancements in the field of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs.

2. All-inorganic halide perovskite NCs and LED structures
2.1. Physicochemical properties of CsPbX3 NCs
Inspired by the successes of the conventional II–VI and III–V semiconductor QDs, such as CdSe, CdS, PbSe and InP, lead halide perovskite was investigated in the form of colloidal NCs. Compared with the rigorous and inert reaction conditions of traditional QDs, these CsPbX3 NCs could be successfully obtained by some facile approaches under mild conditions, such as room temperature and ambient conditions. CsPbX3 NCs are regarded as very promising materials due to their excellent photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties, such as high PLQY, long charge carrier diffusion length and high mobility.16,18 In addition, CsPbX3 NCs have a wide color gamut that covers the entire visible spectral range from 400 to 700 nm. In the visible light range, the emission line widths are very narrow, typically with an FWHM of 12–50 nm. In addition, the optical properties can also be tuned by the quantum confinement effect. When the NCs have a smaller radius than their Bohr diameter (5, 7 and 12 nm for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively), the quantum confinement effect affects the PL emission.16 As an example, for ultrathin 1D nanowires19,20 and 2D nanoplates,21 the PL emission is blue-shifted to a shorter wavelength range with decreased diameter or thickness (Fig. 2). Beyond the Bohr diameter, the size-dependent confinement is not obvious and could be ignored.

High defect tolerance is an intrinsic advantage of CsPbX3 NCs, which offers strong inspiration in the development of high-efficiency devices. Conventional semiconductors require ultralow impurity density and defect concentrations, which is ppb level, especially for photovoltaic-grade electronic quality. For CsPbX3 NCs, the defect tolerance can reach up to 1–2 atomic%, leading to bright emitters without surface passivation.22 As a result, the PLQY of CsPbX3 NCs is usually higher than that of conventional QDs. From scientists’ points of view, the high defect tolerance is a “fortunate coincidence”, which includes the absence of deep trap states, unique specifics of the bonding and liquid-like crystalline material in the entire NC.
Furthermore, one typical feature of lead halide perovskite materials is the fast anion exchange. The high ion mobility with bulk and nanocrystalline perovskite materials such as MAPbX323,24 and CsPbX325,26 (X = Cl, Br, I) results in the shift of the band structure and electronic properties without the destruction of phase and morphology (Fig. 3). The source of the exchanged halide can be the excess halides in the circumstances or other perovskite materials with different halide compositions. From previous reports and our experience, the halide migration is quick and specific, making the fine tuning of band gap and physicochemical properties feasible and optoelectronic applications promising.

In contrast to conventional semiconductor materials, CsPbX3 crystals are highly ionic compounds.16,27,28 It is thus understandable that these CsPbX3 crystals could be readily and easily formed into highly crystalline NCs. The band gap can also be tuned through ion-exchange even at ambient conditions. Colloidal stability can be enhanced due to the protection effect endowed by the capping ligand. However, their stability has not met the requirement of practical application yet. These NCs are still very sensitive to thermal treatment, moisture, oxygen and light, resulting in short storage and operation time.
2.2. Synthesis approaches of CsPbX3 NCs

2.2.1. Direct preparation. 
The first successful formation of CsPbX3 NCs via hot-injection was reported by Kovalenko's group in 2015.16 This method was carried out at high temperature, in which the inert atmosphere requirement was similar to that in the synthesis of the conventional II–VI and III–V semiconductor QDs. In a typical process, the precursor PbX2 was dissolved in an octadecene, oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) mixture at high temperature (140–200 °C). Then a certain amount of as-prepared cesium oleate was injected into the PbX2 solution. Several seconds later, the reaction was rapidly cooled down in an ice-bath. The resulting product showed high crystallinity and excellent optical properties. Since then, colloidal synthesis has become the main approach for the controllable synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals with tunable component, size and morphology. Lately, solvothermal29 and microwave30 methods have been explored in the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs. On controlling the precursor and reaction conditions, the NCs exhibited various shapes and tunable PL emission. The tedious steps and rigorous condition, however, raised the cost and limited the large-scale synthesis. In addition to these high-temperature approaches, the re-precipitation31 and hybrid-ligand32 methods that can be conducted at ambient conditions and room temperature have been developed. In these methods, Cs and Pb precursors, capping ligands and passivator (if needed) were dissolved in a non-polar solvent under ambient conditions. Then, a polar solvent was employed to precipitate the products, because the solubility of the precursors was much lower in non-polar solvents than that in polar solvents. Also, ultrasonication could produce CsPbX3 NCs,33 in which the precursors in octadecene or mineral oil could be directly transformed into CsPbX3 NCs under sonication. These reactions with mild conditions and simple operation could produce more stable CsPbX3 NCs against air in comparison with the high-temperature manners. However, the moderate crystallinity and monotonous morphology of the resulting NCs could be further improved in the future. Besides the solution-phase techniques, solid- and gas-phase methods have been reported to enrich the preparation ways of CsPbX3 NCs.34–37 From these successful and prosperous manners, it can be found that it is not difficult to obtain CsPbX3 NCs. How to improve their quality, namely the optical properties and durability, is the key point in the present and future work.


2.2.2. Post-synthesis. 
In addition to the above-mentioned direct synthetic approaches, some efforts have been devoted into the preparation of CsPbX3 NCs from the phase transformation of the derivatives, i.e., Cs4PbX6 and CsPb2X5. These CsxPbyXz have identical element compositions and [PbX6]4− units but completely different structures. For CsPbX3, [PbX6]4− octahedra are connected with each other by sharing the corner. In Cs4PbX6, these octahedra are completely decoupled and Cs+ ions are filled in the holes formed by adjacent [PbX6]4− units. CsPb2X5 has a 2D arrangement that possesses crystallographic planes and insertion of Cs+ ions into PbX2 planes. Depending on the way the units are networked, Cs4PbX6, CsPb2X5, and CsPbX3 can be regarded as 0D, 2D and 3D structures, respectively. In contrast to that on CsPbX3, the investigation on Cs4PbX6 and CsPb2X5 is not that deep yet, and their luminescence properties are still under debate. Some reports have referred to their non-luminescence properties because both Cs4PbX6 and CsPb2X5 have a large bandgap, theoretically confirming their weak luminescence emission.38–40 It has been investigated if the conversion between these three structures could be realized under certain conditions. Fig. 4 shows some typical examples about the phase transformation between CsPbX3 and its derivates.27,38–44

2.3. Passivation of CsPbX3 NCs
In Section 2.1, it was mentioned that the ionic property was proposed to simplify the preparation methods and conditions. On the other hand, it brings trap sites as well as poor durability towards moisture, oxygen, heat and light during long-term storage and operation. It is thus suggested to remove the trap defects and overcome their poor stability, especially in optoelectronic applications. Up to now, surface passivation has been exploited to enhance the optical properties and durability, mainly including capping ligand modification, inorganic chemical treatment and encapsulation.
Since the first report on the successful synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs, the OAm and OA pair has become the most commonly used capping ligand due to its strong protection effect.16 However, this pair is not perfect because its insulating features and possible proton exchange would lead to charge transfer blocking, stability deterioration and trap sites augmentation.
To overcome the disadvantages of the OAm/OA pair, some researchers introduced a shorter or branched capping ligand onto the CsPbX3 NC surface to eliminate trapping defects and improve chemical stability. As one of the first reported ligand candidates, the relatively short-chain di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) can be easily attached on the surface of CsPbX3 NCs.45–47 It could favor the removal of trap states and facilitate carrier transport. In some reports, DDAB could conjugate with S2− to form an organic–inorganic hybrid DDA+–S2− pair, which could act as a protective layer, resulting in a significant enhancement of PLQY and photostability.48,49 In parallel with the short-chain ligand, branched molecules such as trioctylphosphine (TOP),50,51 trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO),52 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)53 and 2,2′-iminodibenzoic acid (IDA)54 endowed strong passivation and stabilization effects.
In the fabrication of devices, the ligand density plays an important role in controlling the charge transport capability. The employment of a robustly bound ligand is a feasible way to decrease the high dosage. A typical example is the replacement of the X-type OAm/OA pair, which contributes one electron to the metal–ligand bond, by an L-type ligand that can contribute two electrons to the metal–ligand bond. Since the L-type ligands are neutral two-electron donors with a lone electron pair, they can coordinate with cations and show a stronger binding to the surface than X-type ligands. Zhong and co-workers55 employed solely an amine (OAm, octylamine or undecylamine) as the L-type ligand, which could stabilize the resulting CsPbBr3 NCs at quite a low density of 4.7 wt%. In comparison, the OAm/OA system had a 14.1 wt% residual ligand (Fig. 5a). The lower density of the capping ligands makes these NCs excellent candidates in the device fabrication process. More importantly, the L-type ligand brought near-unity PLQY and high resistance against multistep purification (Fig. 5b–d). From the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was found that a PbBrx-rich surface was more favorable and resulted in a trap-free bandgap with fully delocalized valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) states (Fig. 5e–h). Furthermore, this work verified the strong binding between the sole ligand and surface ions. A similar observation was made in other ligands, such as octylphosphonic acid56 and zwitterionic molecules.57 An elaborate purification process is another feasible way to remove excess ligands. Up to now, methyl acetate,58 ethyl acetate20 and hexane/ethyl acetate mixed solution59 have been introduced into the washing procedure and have displayed an efficacious removal of redundant ligands on the NC surface. Moreover, they could partially remove surface defects and transform the morphology during the purification process.

Furthermore, it has been reported that a Pb-rich or halide-deficient surface would generate shallow traps within the crystalline CsPbX3. It is thus a promising method to remove excess Pb ions and repair the halide defects. Some inorganic chemical could build up a halide-rich surface and repair the surface trapping states, which was confirmed to enhance the optical property. Metal halides, including ZnBr2,60 PbBr261–63 and HBr complex,64 are the most commonly used chemicals to tune the surface component and increase the population of halide ions. Through direct addition or post-treatment, halide ions could be introduced into the system. As a result, the optical property and stability of the resulting product could be dramatically improved compared with that of the pristine ones. In these works, the cation species were not likely to contribute to the passivation. However, some alkaline,65 alkaline-earth66 and noble metal67,68 cations could be introduced into the lattice and surface to decrease the trapping sites. Another approach was the removal of redundant Pb atoms from the surface of CsPbX3 NCs, which could be realized by specific anions such as thiocyanate (SCN−) and tetrafluoroborate.69
Encapsulation into oxides, polymers and semiconductors can help to maintain the original morphology and optical properties of CsPbX3 NCs. More importantly, the additional shell could repair the surface defects and hinder nonradiative recombination to improve the performance of LEDs. More details will be further discussed in Section 3.3.
2.4. LED structures
It is believed that the first LED was invented by a Russian scientist Losev. In the middle 1920s, Losev found light emission from a semiconductor when a current passed through it, and then established the prototype of the first LED.70–72 In 1960s, four groups reported a functional double-layer LED based on GaAs, simultaneously, and opened the door for LED development.73–76 Alivisatos’ group77 first fabricated LEDs based on CdSe QDs in 1994. However, because of the relatively low PLQY of the emitting layer and the unsuitable structure, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was only 0.01%. At the same time, Saito78 introduced a layered perovskite semiconductor (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 into the LEDs. Limited by the technology, this kind of LEDs could only work at liquid–nitrogen temperature. Recently, Tan79 developed a sandwiched LED structure with MAPbX3 film as the emitting layer, which could work at room temperature. The sandwiched structure has been the most commonly used LED construction. In 2016, Zeng's group17 firstly introduced all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs into the fabrication of LEDs with various emission colors.
Generally, LEDs can be divided into two different types depending on the driving force. One works on an active matrix which could be luminescent using electricity. The other one is white LED operated on a passive matrix, which could be activated by UV or blue light. These two LEDs are called electroluminescent (EL) LEDs and white light LEDs (WLEDs), respectively. In the following parts, we will introduce the working mechanism and commonly used structure in EL LEDs and WLEDs.

2.4.1. EL LEDs. 
EL LEDs are also called electrically driven LEDs, which can be used in backlight display, such as in television and cell phone. In parallel with conventional liquid crystal displays (LCDs), EL LEDs are important display modes as well but share some unique advantages, such as lower power consumption, simplified structure, shorter response time, wider view angle and higher contrast. A typical EL LED usually possesses a p–i–n structure, which is comprised of an anode, a p-type hole transport layer (HTL), an emitting layer, an n-type electron transport layer (ETL) and a cathode. Under applied voltage, holes and electrons are injected from anode and cathode and then transferred through HTL and ETL, respectively, into the emitting layer. Consequently, these carriers form excitons and emit photons. Fig. 6c shows the typical materials used for HTL and ETL and their corresponding energy levels. EL LEDs can be classified into two types of structures, namely, formal and inverted device structure, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. Different from the formal LED structure in which holes and electrons transfer from ITO and back electrode, respectively, in the inverted LEDs, electrons are injected from ITO while holes from the back electrode. In some cases, the inverted LED structure could enable balanced exciton formation and lower the turn-on voltage. In the design of formal and inverted LEDs, the materials for HTLs and ETLs are very different, which could be found in Tables 1 and 2.

Inspired by the successful preparation of CsPbX3 NCs, Zeng and co-workers17 used them to fabricate EL LEDs. Limited by the immature technology and lack of experience, the efficiency of the first LEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs was moderate (EQE = 0.12% for green LEDs). Later, more and more attention was paid to this field. As a result, the efficiency kept increasing. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the typical performance of the CsPbX3 NC-based formal and inverted EL LEDs, respectively.


2.4.2. WLEDs. 
Another kind of LEDs is WLED, which has served as an alternative to the traditional incandescent light due to its easy generation, long lifetime and high efficiency in energy consumption. Therefore, WLEDs have attracted much attention in their development and commercialization. Different from an electricity-driven EL LED, a WLED typically consists of UV/blue-emitting chips with coating of either two or three layers of blue-, green-, or red-emitting materials. GaN and InGaN semiconductor chips are adopted as the primary radiation source that can emit near-UV or blue light. Similarly, monochromatic LEDs can be simply fabricated using blue-emitting chips.107 Benefitting from the pure color and excellent color performance, the multicolor monochromatic LEDs can be utilized in the fabrication of six-color multipackage WLEDs, which are promising for the application in pure-color LEDs for LCDs, 3D display and six-colored LED display.
Depending on the application, WLEDs have been further classified into two distinct categories, that is, backlight and lighting. For lighting WLEDs, the most important points are color-rendering index (CRI) and luminescence at 1931 Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinate (0.33, 0.33). When CRI is close to 100, it suggests that the color rendering is optimum. Correlated color temperature (CCT) is a key feature as well. Neutral white (3000–6000 K) and warm white light (<3000 K) are preferable because they can restore true colors and protect human eyes, respectively. In contrast, the cold white one (>6000 K) is too bright and dazzling. YAG phosphor combined with InGaN blue chip is the most general commercial type with a low CRI. With the development of nanomaterials, QDs have been used in LEDs, resulting in both a promising CRI and high luminescence. For the first time, Zhou et al.108 employed CsPbBrI2 NCs as a red-emitting component in YAG-based WLEDs (Fig. 7a–c). The resulting LED had a promising performance with a CRI of 90, CCT of 5907 K and luminescence of 58 lm W−1. Yoon et al.109 employed pure-color CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, Cl/Br and Br/I) NCs and UV-curable binders to successfully fabricate monochromatic LEDs and six-color multipackage WLEDs based on them. This six-color device displayed excellent color quality (CRI of 96) and a luminous efficacy of 62 lm W−1, indicating the possibility of monochromatic LEDs in future displays.

Color saturation, indicating a narrow emission spectrum (higher color purity), and wide color gamut are two important features in backlight display. Color gamut is determined by the positions of red, green and blue in CIE diagram. Color gamut value is regulated by the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC, CIE 1931). The CIE diagram with different color gamuts is shown in Fig. 7d. It can be seen that a narrow emission spectrum endows a larger NTSC color gamut (Fig. 7d). Owing to the superior color purity and tunable color spectrum, CsPbX3 NCs are considered as excellent candidates with an NTSC of up to 150%,110 which is better than that of traditional QDs. Wang and co-workers111 first introduced CsPbX3 NC package on-chip in a backlighting WLED. Its RGB CIE coordinates were (0.69, 0.30), (0.19, 0.73) and (0.14, 0.04), respectively. The color gamut overlap was 113%, which was higher than that of regular phosphor- (86%) and Cd-QD LEDs (104%), as shown in Fig. 7e.

3. Highly efficient and stable emitting layer
Since the first report on CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs in 2015, scientists have put great efforts into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable LEDs. Over the past four years, the maximum EQE of blue, green and red EL LEDs has reached up to 6.2%, 17.4% and 21.3%,32,92,94 which is increased 88-, 145- and 236-fold, respectively. From previous important and impressive reports, we found that the approaches for the enhancement of the efficiency and stability of LEDs could be classified into several categories, including mixed cation, mixed anion, core–shell structure, morphology control, capping ligand type and density, and coating technique of the emitting layer. In the following part, we will introduce more details on these concepts.
3.1. Mixed cations
Prior to the emergence of all-inorganic perovskite NCs, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites, mainly including MAPbX3 and FAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3, FA = CH(NH2)2, X = Cl, Br, I) have been widely investigated in photovoltaic cells, lasers, LEDs and solar cells. In these APbX3 structures, it is feasible to combine different cations and anions in the composition which promotes more possibilities to engineer the band structure and property in various applications. Encouraged by the mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., CsFA,113 CsFA,114 MAFA,115 RbCsMAFA116) in solar cells, Zhang et al.86 firstly employed FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 perovskite materials as the light-emitting layer in LEDs. The FA1−xCsxPbBr3 NCs were successfully synthesized through a modified re-precipitation method with a certain amount of FA and Cs precursors. Since Cs has a smaller ionic radius (1.81 Å) than FA (2.79 Å),117 the crystal lattice of FA1−xCsxPbBr3 NCs shrank with an increased Cs content, as shown in Fig. 8a. In addition to the crystal structure, the introduction of FA played an important role in fine tuning the band structure and PL peak position without external emission, as shown in Fig. 8b and c. As x increased, the VBM position became lower for FA1−xCsxPbBr3 NCs (Fig. 8e). As a result, the hole injection process was facilitated, owing to the reduced hole injection barrier at the interface between the light emitting layer and hole transport layer (Fig. 8d). When x = 0.2, the fabricated LED displayed a high EQE of 2.80% and luminance of 55005 cd m−2, as shown in Fig. 8f. By using similar FA0.15Cs0.85PbBr3 NCs as the light emitting layer, the EQE of the corresponding LEDs could reach up to 16.48%.32 Not limited to FA, but other organic cations such as butyl ammonium (BA) have also been introduced into CsPbX3 to produce Ruddlesden–Popper phase perovskite BA2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 nanosheets, which have shown a promising EQE of 10.1%.94

The toxicity of Pb raises environmental pollution concerns, which has been a significant restriction in the development of lead halide perovskites and their promising applications in optoelectronic fields. Currently, some lead-free perovskites have been successfully prepared to alleviate the toxicity of Pb; however, their unfavorable optical properties and poor stability have resulted in high defect densities and inferior device performance. To decrease the amount of Pb, alternatively, Sun's group118 reported the synthesis of mixed-cation perovskite CsPb1−xSnxBr3 NCs and their application in LEDs for the first time. From their results, the as-obtained product showed composition-dependent optical properties, which provided versatility in the fine tuning of the emission wavelength and related bandgap structure. The maximum luminance and current efficiency could reach up to 1.14 and 3.87 folds improvement, respectively, in comparison to that of pristine CsPbBr3 NCs. However, the detailed mechanism of the enhancement of LED performance was still unclear in this work. In 2017, Wang and co-workers84 fabricated high-performance LEDs with CsPb1−xSnxBr3 NCs as the emitting layer as well. They provided clear evidence that a proper amount of Sn4+ ions could efficiently suppress the formation of trions and meanwhile increase the radiative recombination of single excitons, resulting in a high PLQY of 83% (shown in Fig. 9a–c).

Transition metal Mn is one of the most commonly used dopants for CsPbX3 NCs. Due to the similar valence state and ionic radius of Mn and Pb and the similar bond dissociation energy of Mn–Cl and Pb–Cl,119 Mn2+ could be easily introduced into the CsPbCl3 NC host. With the increasing Mn substitution ratio of up to 46%, the as-obtained product could well maintain its tetragonal crystalline structure and enhance the PLQY from 5% of undoped CsPbCl3 host to 54%.120 By using CsPb1−xMnxCl3 as color conversion materials, a highly stable LED with orange-red emission could be successfully fabricated, as shown in Fig. 9g. Mn2+ could be doped into CsPbBr3 NCs as well. However, the dopant amount was not as high as in the case of CsPbCl3, which was usually lower than 10%, probably owing to the incompatibility of ions. Benefiting from the enhancement in formation energies brought by Mn2+ doping, the CsPb1−xMnxBr3 NCs could function as efficient and stable green-light emitters in LEDs. The maximum EQE was increased from 0.81% for the CsPbBr3-based LED to 1.49% for the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 device (Fig. 9h).83 In addition, the durability against temperature and air has been significantly improved. Interestingly, it can be seen that the Mn emission at ca. 600 nm could be naturally quenched in a Br-rich synthesis, which might provide the chance to enhance the blue-light emission of CsPbCl3 NCs. Fig. 9d–f shows the different PL emission spectra of Mn-doped CsPbX3 NCs. To take advantage of this fact, Mn-doped CsPbClyBr1−y NCs were employed to fabricate a blue LED (Fig. 9i) with an EQE of over 2%, while that of pristine CsPbClyBr1−y NCs was only 0.50%.95 From these works, it can be seen that the benefits of Mn-doped CsPbX3 are not only the energy transfer and emission, but also the improvement in QY and elimination of trap states.
In addition to Sn and Mn, other metal ions have been employed in the modification of CsPbX3 NCs and their corresponding LEDs. It has been widely accepted that pristine CsPbI3 NCs have a moderate optical performance and poor stability due to their intrinsic property. In Rogach's work,104 SrCl2 was used as a co-precursor in the synthesis of CsPbI3 NCs. Thanks to the partial substitution of Pb with Sr, the under-coordinated Pb atoms were removed from the CsPbI3 surface, leading to the increase in PLQY from 65% to 84%. Furthermore, the Sr-doped CsPbI3 NCs showed a reduced VBM, which might be a better energy level structure in LEDs for balancing the transport rate of electrons and holes. Consequently, the EQE of red LED could reach up to 13.5%. Accompanied with the excellent device performance, the addition of SrCl2 could validly protect the NCs from phase transition from cubic α-phase to yellow δ-phase, leading to well-maintained morphology and optical property for 2 months in air. The high stability could be ascribed to the enhancement of the formation energy of CsPbI3 and reduction of structural distortion.121 Ce,93 Ag67 and Al122 have also been reported in the optimization of CsPbX3 NCs, resulting in a great enhancement in the device performance. It should be pointed out that the cation doping probably gave rise to the emission shift. One typical example is Al doping.122 The resulting Al-doped CsPbBr3 NCs showed deep-blue emission at 456 nm while the original CsPbBr3 NCs show green emission at 515 nm. When green CsPbBr3 and blue Al-doped CsPbBr3 were mixed, no anion-exchange could be corroborated, providing more possibilities for fabricating high-efficiency WLEDs in the absence of anion-exchange.
The co-doped cations in the host may offer the opportunity to prepare promising LEDs with unique emission properties. For example, Song et al.123 employed a modified hot-injection method to prepare various lanthanide ion-doped CsPbCl3 NCs. These doped NCs exhibited high PLQY and stable tunable multicolor emissions because they inherited the unique optical properties of lanthanide ions and delivered it to CsPbCl3 host as well. Among them, Ce3+-doped CsPbCl3 NCs displayed stable blue and green emission, while the Eu3+-doped ones showed stable red emission (Fig. 10a and d), which might be a favorable alternative to fabricate WLEDs in the presence of only all-inorganic perovskite. Subsequently, Ce3+ and Eu3+ co-doped CsPbCl3 NCs were constructed and then used in a cool WLED (Fig. 10e), which possessed a high luminous efficiency of 24 lm W−1 and a long-term stability of more than 12 days. Analogously, a cation/anion synergistic exchange strategy was employed to prepare Mn and Zn co-doped CsPbX3 perovskite NCs with strong blue light emission from band edge emission and orange light from Mn dopant, as shown in Fig. 10c.124 Furthermore, the co-doped products had a much higher PLQY compared to that of the single metal (Mn)-doped ones (Fig. 10b). The bright and multi-color PL emission made it feasible to construct WLEDs based on the co-doped CsPbX3 NCs.

3.2. Mixed anions
From Section 2.1, it can be learned that lead halide perovskite with a certain anion component is a feasible option to tune the band gap and physicochemical properties. For example, CsPbI3 has a suitable band gap (1.73 eV) for solar cell application, but suffers from phase instability under ambient conditions. In contrast, the dual halide CsPbBrI2 shows a much higher ambient stability and reasonable bandgap (1.91 eV) for photovoltaic devices.125–127 Another typical example is the mixed halide perovskite MAPbClxBr3−x. A small addition of Cl into MAPbBr3 confers improved carrier recombination lifetime and higher open circuit voltage in the device.128–130 However, the stabilizing and enhancing effect of mixed halides is currently under debate.
The investigations on dual halide perovskites in LEDs are still limited, especially those on all-inorganic perovskite NCs. Nevertheless, they show great potential in promoting the performance and stability, and have thus drawn more and more attention in LEDs. Since pristine CsPbCl3 NCs prepared from the classical hot-injection method show a low PLQY, it is challenging to directly obtain bright blue LEDs based on pure CsPbCl3 NCs. Yang's group131 simply mixed CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 NCs together at a weight ratio of 2:1. As a result of halide migration, CsPbCl2Br1 with blue emission at 470 nm and a much higher PLQY was successfully obtained. Compared to CsPbCl3 NCs, the CsPbCl2Br1 NCs showed a better orderly alignment and dispersity as well as less aggregation in the solution phase, as shown in Fig. 11a and b. Moreover, the uniform small CsPbCl2Br1 NCs formed a very smooth film without any pinholes (Fig. 11c), which promoted the blue LED performance to some extent. The fabricated blue LED based on CsPbCl2Br1 NCs showed a high luminance of 55005 cd m−2, which displayed a significant enhancement in brightness compared to the CsPbCl3 one.

In the first report of CsPbX3 NCs applied in LEDs, Zeng's group17 prepared an orange LED rather than a pure red one because of the notorious instability of CsPbI3 NCs. The partial replacement of I with Br might be a promising approach to overcome the instability of red emitters. Halpert et al.132 produced a series of CsPbBr3−xIx NCs and found that deep red CsPb0.5Br2.5 (roughly) showed a great color stability under different voltages (Fig. 11d–f). Although field-driven halide separation occurred, the great compositional stability of CsPbBr3−xIx NCs was demonstrated and proven to be feasible, which was further confirmed by other groups.105,133
Up to now, the highest EQE of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs is 21.3%, in which the red emitters are dual halide CsPbBrxI3−x NCs obtained through an anion-exchange method (Fig. 12a).92 Two different iodine sources were employed in the preparation of CsPbBrxI3−x NCs, both of which showed a slight difference in the band structure but a similar and superior performance, as shown in Fig. 12b–d. The LEDs exhibited a long operational lifetime of more than 180 min and a slight shift in the operational voltage (Fig. 12e and f). It should be pointed out that most of the anion exchange occurs between periodically adjacent halides, namely CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3, and CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. In the Cl and I case, the excitation transfer from CsPbCl3 to CsPbI3 in solution resulted in blue emission reabsorption and then re-emission in the red region.134

3.3. Core–shell structures
QDs, typically Cd-based QDs, bear some issues hindering their applications, including moderate PLQY and poor stability. In order to achieve better stability and higher PLQY, delicate surface passivation (coating) is often required. In comparison with traditional Cd-QDs, CsPbX3 NCs exhibited a much higher PLQY and stability. However, its modest stability and easy ion-exchange once different halide NCs are used together, resulting from the intrinsic ionic property, are still the major obstacles that limit their practical applications. Parallel with shelling in Cd-based QDs, CsPbX3 NCs that are coated with inert, robust and stable materials could be a good choice to further enhance the stability and prevent the possible ion-exchange for long-term storage and operation.
SiOx has shown promising potential in the protection CsPbX3 NCs from damage and ion-exchange because the oxide has excellent stability against environmental and chemical corrosion and great optical properties. In 2016, Liu111 and Yu135 simultaneously prepared a CsPbBr3/SiO2 core/shell structure by using in-situ synthesis and integration methods, respectively, and then introduced them into the WLED display. The resulting WLEDs had an NTSC value of ca. 120%, which was much higher than that of traditional QDs. Moreover, the lifetime of the WLED device could reach up to 200 h.135 Subsequently, more and more researchers136–144 focused their attention on CsPbX3/oxide (such as AlOx, SiOx and AlOx mixture) core/shell composites and confirmed the great protection effect provided by the oxides in the fabrication of WLED lighting and display and other applications. Among these works, almost all the reported works dealt with the ensemble of multiple CsPbX3 NCs in SiO2 matrix, and the products were always big particles, forming an obstacle in the formation of films with high uniformity. Zhang's group prepared the CsPbX3/oxide Janus structure145,146 followed by the core/shell147 structure at single particle level. Especially, the WLEDs fabricated by the Janus structure demonstrated superior film uniformity and a wide color gamut covering 138% of NTSC standard (Fig. 13a–e). After operating for 1 h, the device still maintained white emission, while that of the naked CsPbBr3 NCs turned into blue light (Fig. 13f).

Embedding CsPbX3 NCs into water-proof polymer matrices is another effective method to enhance the stability, especially water resistance. Various methods such as swelling–shrinking,148 electrospinning,149 microfluidic spinning,150 and recrystallization3 have been employed in the successful combination of CsPbX3 NCs and polymer structures. The products that CsPbX3 was embedded into were polystyrene (PS) beads,148 PS hemispheres,151 PS fibers,149 polyvinylalcohol (PVA) fibers, poly(methyl)methacrylate (PMMA) fibers,150 PMMA spheres,152,153 poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMA),154 ethyl acetate spheres152 and polystyrene-block-poly-2-vinylpyridine (PS-b-P2VP) spheres.155 The luminescence properties and stability varied with the polymer type;156 however, almost every polymer played a significant role in improving the resistance of the composite CsPbX3 NCs and that of the WLEDs based on them against water, polar solvents and thermal treatment. In addition to oxides and polymers, CsPbX3 NCs have been incorporated into CaF2,157 ZIF-8,158 MOF-5,159 anthracene160 and zeolite-Y,161 and have exhibited enhanced performance and stability in WLEDs.
From the above-mentioned cases involving oxides, polymers and other materials, it is easy to find that almost all the CsPbX3 NC-based composites are employed in the fabrication of WLEDs, which could be activated by UV and blue light. So the question remains, could they be used in EL LEDs as emitting layers? The answer might be No, because oxides and most of polymers and organic materials have poor conductivity and carrier transfer capacity in EL LEDs. Semiconductors would be good substitutes for the inert and insulating oxides and polymers. On the other hand, the semiconductor shells should have a suitable bandgap alignment with CsPbX3 NCs to form type I heterojunctions, similar to the CdSe/ZnS core/shell structure with great carrier confinement effect. TiO2,162–164 MoS2165,166 and ZnS167 have been introduced into CsPbX3 NCs in some previous reports, resulting in a type II structure with high interfacial carrier separation. Cs4PbX6 and CsPb2X5, that have the similar ternary crystal structure as CsPbX3, have been employed in the preparation of dual-phase composites and applied as the emitting layer in LEDs. For example, films of CsPbBr3 NCs embedded in Cs4PbBr6 were incorporated in EL LEDs.168 The obtained type I heterojunction could boost carrier recombination as well (Fig. 13g and h). The corresponding LED showed 100- and 68-fold improvement in maximum current efficiency and EQE, respectively. Similarly, other reported LEDs based on CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6169 and CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br580 composites presented enhanced stability and efficiency. It should be noted that the performance of composite-based LEDs was moderate though, which had a very large promotion space.
3.4. Morphologies
Since the first report on CsPbX3 NCs in 2015,16 the most common shape of the as-obtained CsPbX3 NCs is nanocubes, which may be ascribed to their typical cubic phase. In the same year, Zeng fabricated the first LED based on CsPbX3 nanocubes as the emitting layer.17 Since then, various synthesis approaches29–31,33,34,170 have been developed and have shown great potential in the preparation of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs with various morphologies. However, most of the reported LEDs are currently based on the nanocube system, probably owing to their good stability and film-forming property. In our opinion, the morphology plays a significant role in the specialization and optimization of LED performance. In this review article, we will focus more attention on zero/one/two/three-dimensional CsPbX3 NCs and other less common structures.
Zero-dimensional CsPbBr3 nanospheres have been successfully synthesized and applied into the fabrication of high-efficiency LEDs. Tan and co-workers56 employed octylphosphonic acid as a new type of ligand to develop CsPbBr3 nanospheres. Owing to the sphere-like morphology and strong interaction between the ligand and lead atoms, these CsPbBr3 nanospheres could form a uniform and compact film with high PLQY. Thereby, the current efficiency and EQE of the fabricated LEDs could reach up to 18.13 cd A−1 and 6.5%, respectively.
One-dimensional CsPbX3 nanowires and nanorods have received extensive attention in lasers171–173 and photodetectors174,175 due to their long carrier lifetime and fast charge transfer that have arisen from their high aspect ratio. After a literature review, we found that the investigations on LEDs based on CsPbX3 nanorods are currently limited. Yang et al.99 employed a water-triggered approach to prepare CsPbBr3 nanorods with a high PLQY of up to 87% and a PL lifetime of 44 ns. The corresponding formation mechanism and TEM image are shown in Fig. 14a and b, respectively. In addition, this unique post-synthesis endowed the resulting nanorods with a very clean surface due to the ligand detachment at the oil–water surface. The nanorods showed an increase in valence band maximum by 0.18 eV in comparison with traditional nanocubes, leading to a higher hole injection rate in the LEDs. Benefitting from these parameters, a high-efficiency LED was fabricated with an EQE of 8.2% (Fig. 14c). This work helped us to better understand the effect of morphology in the photovoltaic fields.

Two-dimensional CsPbX3 nanoplates have unique arrangement features and high flexibility, so that they can be assembled into ultrathin, flexible, large-area and pinhole-free films. Si and co-workers87 reported CsPbBr3 nanoplates passivated by phenylbutylammonium (PBA) cations (Fig. 15a), which showed a bright green PL emission. The layered perovskite material exhibited high PLQY, narrow emission line widths, low trap densities and smooth surface (Fig. 15b) when formed into the emitter layer. As a result, high-color-purity green LEDs with an EQE of up to 10.4% could be obtained, as shown in Fig. 15c.

The quantum confinement effect endows the CsPbX3 nanoplates with unique properties. For example, CsPbBr3 nanoplates display blue emission when their thickness is less than the Bohr diameter (7 nm for CsPbBr316). Yang et al.21 prepared ultrathin CsPbBr3 nanoplates with tunable thickness and resultant tunable PL emission in one monolayer level, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. Especially, these nanoplates emitted bright blue PL emission. Subsequently, blue LEDs were successfully fabricated for the first time (Fig. 15d). However, the EQE of the blue LEDs was only 0.1%, which was moderate compared to that of the green LEDs. Lately, CsPbBr3 nanoplates were passivated by a HBr complex solution and their PLQY was promoted to 96%. The corresponding LEDs showed a higher EQE of 0.124%.64
More complicated three-dimensional CsPbBr3 nanoflowers (Fig. 16a and b) were successfully prepared by using the transformation between Cs4PbBr6 and CsPbBr3.176 The as-obtained CsPbBr3 nanoflowers had a dodecapod structure, as shown in Fig. 16c. The high PLQY (50%) favored the corresponding WLED with a high 135% color gamut of National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard (Fig. 16d and e). This work may shed light on some unique morphologies and their promising applications in optoelectronic fields.

The self-assembly of building blocks into ordered superlattice architectures is powerful in tailoring the physiochemical properties and gaining fundamental knowledge. Compared with traditional building blocks such as metal and chalcogenide NCs, CsPbX3 NCs are not that feasible to build very complicated structures but rather single-component supercrystals due to their ionic features and moderate stability. Polavarapu et al.177 self-assembled individual NCs into large-sized supercrystals (Fig. 17c) with an obvious redshift PL emission from 512 nm to 535 nm (Fig. 17a). The redshift could be ascribed to the interparticle electronic coupling, as shown in Fig. 17b. Furthermore, LEDs fabricated from CsPbBr3 supercrystals displayed bright green PL, which was closer to the recommended pure green (Rec 2020), compared to the CsPbBr3 NC- and FAPbBr3 NC-based ones (Fig. 17d and e). Similarly, Liao's group178 prepared uniform and flat CsPbBr3 NC films composing of self-assembled NCs. An EQE of over 15% and great operational stability could be realized in the CsPbBr3 supercrystal-based LEDs. In addition to nanocubes, blue-emitting CsPbBr3 nanoplates could be self-assembled into much larger stacked lamellar structures including square-shaped disks and belts with green PL emission (Fig. 17f–h). It should be pointed out that the PLQY increased from 25% to 65% during the self-assembly process. As a result, the stacked lamellar structures could be used as the emitting layer in green high-efficiency LEDs.82

The anion-exchange in lead halide perovskites offers the opportunity to fine tune their PL emission and bandgap. However, it still brings some limitations, for example, the need for conventional phosphors as the red-emitting layer when green CsPbBr3 NCs are employed as the green-emitting source in WLEDs. If Br- and I-based perovskite NCs were embedded in a WLED, a polymer matrix was necessary to prevent the spontaneous anion-exchange process.179 Various morphologies with different PL emissions shed some light in the fabrication of WLEDs. Manna's group180 combined single color blue, green, and orange/red films with CsPbBr3 nanoplates, CsPbBr3 nanocubes and CsPbI3 nanosheets/nanocubes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 18a. An X-ray irradiation method (Fig. 18b) under vacuum was employed to inhibit the anion-exchange between the first layer CsPbBr3 and the second layer CsPbI3. Bright white emission could be realized with the introduction of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs under 365 nm UV light irradiation (Fig. 18c). Along with the above-mentioned morphology cases, CsPbBr3 NCs could be fused into unique porous films with high light harvesting and carrier transport, as shown in Fig. 18d–h.181 These examples suggested the great application prospects of CsPbX3 NCs with various morphologies in optoelectronic fields.

3.5. Capping ligands
Since the first report on CsPbX3 NCs and CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs, the capping ligand on the surface of CsPbX3 NCs was OAm/OA pair in most reports. These long-chain alkyl groups could facilitate the resultant NCs to disperse in various nonpolar solvents very well. However, the proton exchange between OA and OAm could induce their detachment resulting in more trap sites and poor stability during cleaning and long-time storage. On the other hand, large amounts of long-chain organic ligands between the NCs will hinder the charge carrier hopping in solid optoelectronic devices. To further explore the potential of CsPbX3 NCs, especially in the field of LEDs, the ligand issue should be addressed properly.
Surface ligand engineering with new style ligands is a facile and diversified route to enhance the optical properties and carrier transport in CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs. Normally, a third ligand would be incorporated to coordinate with the OAm/OA pair by either direct introduction or post treatment. Bakr's group54 explored a bidentate ligand IDA to passivate the OAm/OA-capped CsPbI3 NCs. Computational simulations showed that the bonding between the perovskite surface and IDA was much stronger compared to that with OA, as shown in Fig. 19a and b. The IDA-treated perovskite NCs had a PLQY of over 95%, which was much higher than that of OAm/OA-CsPbI3 NCs. Moreover, the treated NCs showed a dramatically enhanced durability for more than 15 days. As a result, the as-fabricated red LEDs had a 2-fold higher luminescence intensity than the LEDs based on pristine NCs, as shown in Fig. 19c. The incorporated ligands, such as DDAB, TOP, PMA and methacrylic acid (MA), usually stabilized the NCs by tightening the ligand binding, providing an improved emission property and stability against long-term storage and operation.45,46,51,154,182 On the other hand, some short ligands could remarkably facilitate the carrier injection and transport in LEDs. For example, phenethylamine (PEA) could be introduced on the CsPbX3 surface by using a two-step approach as shown in Fig. 19d. Through the partial replacement of long insulating ligands, fewer trap sites and faster carrier transport could be realized in the corresponding green and red LEDs.90

Instead of the OAm/OA pair, some specific sole/coupled capping ligands could offer advantages in improving the performance of the fabricated LEDs. It has been reported that sole OA,183 octylphosphonic acid,56 zwitterionic 3-(N,N-dimethyloctadecylammonio)-propanesulfonatecould57 and aromatic acid/amine89 could better stabilize NCs in the films at a low concentration, and thus significantly increase the carrier transport. In 2018, Zeng32 developed an organic–inorganic hybrid ligand (OIHL) strategy to improve the performance of perovskite NC-based LEDs to a new standard. The organic ligands (octanoic acid and DDAB) and the subsequent inorganic ligands (metal bromide) simultaneously passivated the surface of CsPbX3 NCs (Fig. 19e). As a result, the superior conductivity and brightness of the NC film contributed to an EQE of 16.48%, as shown in Fig. 19f. Besides, a trimethylaluminum (TMA) crosslinking method was also reported that could provide a natural confinement of injected charges and give rise to a remarkable EQE yield.100
In parallel with diverse ligands, the ligand density could be controlled by purification approaches. It has been proven that the removal of excess ligands without the deterioration of the crystals is a key step in the fabrication of high-efficiency LEDs, as shown in Fig. 20. Through ligand density control, the surface passivation and carrier injection could be balanced. A hexane/ethyl acetate mixed solvent could be used to purify the CsPbX3 NCs and manipulate the surface ligand density.59 The ink stability, PLQY, film uniformity and microstructure could be well preserved after proper treatment by using the mixed solvent. In addition to the hexane/ethyl acetate, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme)88 and methyl acetate,184 mild poor solvents, have been used in multiple wash cycles, which resulted in the high performance of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs. Besides the colloidal purification methods, a solid thermal process followed by an exposure to UV could efficiently remove ligands and prevent the coalescence of QDs and generation of more defects.185

3.6. Coating techniques
In addition to the above-mentioned nature of perovskite NCs and LED structures, the quality of the NC film plays an important role in determining the LED performance. Generally, the quality, including the uniformity and thickness, of the NC film greatly affects the charge transfer and charge balance in multilayered devices. Until now, various solution methods have been adopted in the preparation of a NC film, such as spin coating,17 brush coating,186 drop casting,57 spray printing,187 screen printing,188 and inkjet printing.189 Among these processes, spin coating has been the most widely used one due to its simplicity and operability. However, the large demand for perovskite NCs and limits of the lab-scale fabrication of films are unavoidable problems in developing high-efficiency LEDs and other devices.
In contrast, spray coating is an up-scalable technique that allows the preparation of large-area NC films on various substrates and favors the improvement of waste management. Yang et al.190 employed a spray coating method (Fig. 21a) by using an airbrush equipped with a nozzle to fabricate CsPbBr3 NC films with large surface area. Furthermore, the film thickness could be tuned by controlling the deposition time (Fig. 21c). The material utilization ratio could reach up to 32%, which was usually less than 1% for spin coating. The spray-coated film had an average roughness of 15 nm, which was much rougher than the spin-coated one (Fig. 21b). The relatively rough surface favored larger charge transfer resistance, suggesting a lower recombination rate. Very recently, Do et al.191 utilized a similar spray coating method to fabricate NC films with enhanced stability and efficiency. Besides, screen printing188 and drop casting153 technology were developed to prepare CsPbX3 NC films. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports on different coating techniques are still limited, which inspired us to devote more effort in the exploration of more facile and efficient approaches.

3.7. Stable emitting layer
From the above-mentioned manners, it is feasible to enhance the LED efficiency by tuning the composition (cation, anion and core–shell heterostructure), morphology, capping ligand and coating technique. In these successful examples, the LED durability can usually be significantly improved along with the efficiency. For instance, the partial substitution of Pb2+ with Sr2+ or I− with Br− in CsPbI3 NCs led to an increase in PLQY and prevented their phase transition to the yellow δ-phase as well.104,132,192 Compared to the mixed cations or anions, the encapsulation strategies are more widely investigated. It has been proven that oxide coating is reasonable and effective and can enhance the resistance of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs. In the first stable WLED based on SiO2-coated CsPbBr3 NCs,135 the power efficiency could reach up to 61.2 lm W−1. More importantly, the composite displayed extremely high stability against air and anion-exchange reaction. A little variation in the emission was observed after operation for 10 h, and the half-time could reach up to 227 h. Lately, more and more researches have investigated the CsPbBr3 NC encapsulated into SiO2 and analogous oxides.111,136–146 Similarly, a dense polymer matrix could endow CsPbX3 NCs and the WLEDs based on them with excellent stability against water and UV light illumination.151,152,193 However, the polymer-capped CsPbX3 NCs exhibited poor heat tolerance at high operation current, but could steadily work under low current.150 Besides, the incorporation of other semiconductors could improve the resistance of CsPbX3 NCs as well, such as the derivates (Cs4PbX6 and CsPb2X5),80,168,169 MoS2165,166 and ZnS.167 Up to now, only limited reports have investigated the LED performance based on the CsPbX3–semiconductor system, probably owing to the inferior performance which could be further promoted later. In addition to the above-mentioned oxides, polymers and semiconductors, the CsPbX3 NCs could be encapsulated into various other materials, such as NH4Br framework,194 zeolite161,195 and silicone,196 resulting in highly stable LEDs under ambient conditions.
4. Optimization of the structure of LEDs
From Section 3, it can be learned that various approaches have been developed to enhance the performance of LEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs, including the cation doping, mixed anion, core–shell structure, and ligand control approach. It should be noted that most of the previous reports are mainly concentrated on the modification of CsPbX3 NC emitting layer. Apart from the emitters, the device engineering plays an even more critical role to boost the device performance, because the multilayers in LEDs work together and tune the carrier transport and recombination. In this part, we will focus on some of the typical works on the optimization of the LED structure from the ETL, HTL and interfacial layers.
4.1. ETL engineering
In the first successful LEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs,17 Zeng's group employed 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)-benzene (TPBi) as the ETL, which is the most widely used one owing to its good electron transport capability and energy level match for electron injection. Liu et al.197 introduced tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) into TPBi to form TPBi/Alq3/TPBi layer as a new ETL. Due to the lower electron mobility of Alq3 compared to that of TPBi, the insertion of Alq3 could impede the electron transport and reduce the number of electrons (Fig. 22a). As a result, a more equal electron and hole mobility could be realized that is more ideal for charge balance and the resultant LED performance. Consequently, a pure green emission with an FWHM of 16 nm was obtained (Fig. 22b). The maximum EQE, current efficiency and power efficiency were 1.91, 1.92 and 2.11 folds higher, respectively, than that of the LEDs with the conventional TPBi as the ETL.

(c) Schematic, cross-sectional SEM image and (d) energy band alignment of the heterostructured device with p-MgNiO and n-MgZnO as carrier transport layers.

Considering the inherent chemical instability of polymers and small molecules in the ETL, some researchers selected stable inorganic semiconductors as new ETLs, such as n-MgZnO,102 n-ZnO,98 and Li-doped TiO2.198 For example, MgZnO, an n-type wide band-gap material (Fig. 22c), could be used as the ETL and hole-confining layer because of the matched electron affinity with CsPbBr3 NCs and the deep valence band energy level (Fig. 22d), which allows electrons and holes to recombine more effectively, leading to a maximum luminance of 3809 cd m−2 and EQE of 2.39%. The LEDs could continuously operate for 10 h and more than 80% of bright emission could be maintained, which makes them superior to those constructed with organic carrier layers.
4.2. HTL engineering
Similar to ETLs, inorganic metal oxide materials have been employed as HTLs in CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs to overcome the stability issue. NiO98 and MgNiO102 have been used as HTLs without labile organic compositions. NiOx had a large ionization energy and small electron affinity, which favored the hole transport and electron blocking. Moreover, the higher work function of NiOx could further enhance hole injection compared to the traditional poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophen) polystyr-enesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), resulting in a better charge balance and more radiative recombination. Congreve's group91 compared the roles of inorganic NiOx and the organic bilayer of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine))] Nafion perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) (TFB:PFI) in CsPbX3 NC-based blue LEDs (Fig. 23a–c). No obvious discrepancy could be found from their EL spectra, as shown in Fig. 23d. In comparison, a more conductive structure of the NiOx device demonstrated higher brightness and lower turn-on voltage but a moderate EQE of 0.03%. The TFB/PFI device exhibited better film formation and reduced pinholes, resulting in lower dark current and higher turn-on voltage. As a result, the EQE could reach up to 0.50% (Fig. 23e and f). The TFB/PFI used as the HTL was universal for blue and green devices with various EL spectra, as shown in Fig. 23g. From these results, it can be found that the inorganic and organic HTLs provide strong benefits in different aspects and work as candidates depending on the working conditions and purposes.

4.3. Interfacial layer engineering
To make highly efficient and stable perovskite-based LEDs, appropriate carrier transport layers are important because of their crucial role in energy level matching and protecting the emissive layers. Besides the selection of charge transport layers, the employment of an inorganic103 or organic interfacial layer101,199,200 between the transport and emitting layers is a feasible approach as well. For example, with the incorporation of polyethylenimine (PEI) between ETL and CsPb(Br/I)3 NC film, the CBM reduced by 0.44 eV compared to that with pure ZnO as the ETL (Fig. 24a and b).101 Consequently, electron injection could be facilitated. Similarly, a film that involved perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) was sandwiched between poly-TPD HTL and CsPbBr3 NC layer.199 After PEI modification, the VBM increased by 0.34 eV, suggesting the reduced hole injection barrier aiming to realize the charge balance (Fig. 24c and d). Another important role of the organic PEI and PFI is the prevention of NC charging, which is known as a common source of photoluminescence quenching. In addition, the modification of the electrode and architecture could affect the device performance.201,202

5. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we introduced the physicochemical properties, synthesis and passivation approaches of all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 NCs, and summarized the typical performance of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs in the formal and inverted LED structures. On the way to improve the efficiency and stability, we discussed the modification strategies, namely the optimization of emitting layers and device structures. For the emitting layer, the control over its composition, morphology, capping ligand and coating technique has proven to play important roles in the tuning of LED performance. The device structure including ETLs, HTLs and interfacial layers can be further improved resulting in enhanced LED performance. In spite of the huge success and achievements, there are still plenty of challenges limiting further improvements in this field. Based on our understanding, we will try to predict the possible trend in the development of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs, mainly including the perfection of the device structure, encapsulation of CsPbX3 NCs, preparation of lead-free perovskite NCs and production of large-area and high-quality LEDs at low cost, as shown in Fig. 25.
 Fig. 25  The possible development trend in CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs. 
The performance of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs is the major factor restricting their application and commercialization. Up to now, CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs have shown a maximum EQE of ∼21%,92 which is still far behind that of commercial OLEDs and QLEDs (efficiency over 40%). Especially for the CsPbX3 NCs-based blue LEDs, the highest EQE is only 6.2%,94 far away from the requirement for practical application. Highly efficient LEDs can be realized when devices possess two crucial parameters: highly luminescent nature and reasonable electrical transport features. From this review article, it can be found that LED structures play a key role in the enhancement of device efficiency, because ETLs and HTLs can tune the carrier transport and recombination rates. However, only limited reports have talked about the optimization of LED structures, while most works have focused on the CsPbX3 NC emitting layers. From our point of view, perfection in the structure will be a breakthrough point in CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs.
The poor stability is a primary concern of CsPbX3 NC-based EL LEDs as well. The longest operation lifetime (half-lifetime, T50) is 180 min,92 which is much shorter than that of the state-of-the-art OLEDs and QLEDs with a T50 of more than 300000 hours. These values suggest the large gap compared to OLEDs and QLEDs. The intrinsic ionic nature and possible ion migration of CsPbX3 NCs determine the unsatisfactory durability in the transistor platform. Considering the success in QLEDs, we think that it will be a good idea to coat CsPbX3 NCs with well-designed semiconductor shells to overcome the low stability. The semiconductor shell can not only confine the excited carriers, but also prevent the degradation during the operation process. Owing to the ionic nature of CsPbX3 NCs, it might be difficult to directly prepare a CsPbX3/semiconductor core/shell structure in a single particle level. Recently, Tang et al.203 prepared CsPbX3/CdS core/shell NCs, providing a good example for the encapsulation. But for the practical applications of LEDs, the encapsulation into a highly stable and low-toxic semiconductor shell is still anticipated.
Compared to the traditional Cd-based QDs, the Pb-involved CsPbX3 NCs are less bio-toxic and more eco-friendly. However, as a heavy metal, Pb still seriously threatens the human health, which has become a big problem in the development of CsPbX3. So far, a few lead-free metal halide perovskite NCs have been successfully obtained, including CsSnX3,204 Cs2SnX6,205 Cs3Bi2X9,206 Cs2AgInX6,207 Cs2AgBiBr6,208 Cs3Sb2Br9,209 and Cs2CuX4.210 However, it is difficult to retain the 3D perovskite structure in most lead-free perovskite NCs. The abundant surface defects play a negative role in their band-gap trapping progress.208 As a result, their optical properties and stability are still poor, which limits their application in LEDs. To date, only few reports have discussed the lead-free all-inorganic perovskite-based LEDs,211–213 especially the NC-based ones206 with a moderate performance. The preparation of lead-free perovskite NCs with great physiochemical properties and improved performance in LEDs is in urgent need.
Till now, the CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs are still fabricated on a laboratory scale, partially because of the complicated steps and rigorous conditions in the preparation of the emitting layers and fabrication of LEDs. For example, the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs always requires a tedious purification procedure to the remove excess precursor and capping ligands. For the construction of LEDs, the coating and annealing steps are repeated several times, which will be a heavy burden in the actual production process. Therefore, we hope that the development of large-area and high-quality LEDs can be realized in a large scale with low cost and a simple procedure. For instance, we can try to deposit the layers by using simple dip-coating rather than complex spin coating in the assembly of large-area LEDs.
One bottleneck in the development of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs is the anion-exchange in CsPbX3 with different halides, which makes it difficult to fabricate WLEDs, especially EL WLEDs. From our experience, the above-mentioned encapsulation by semiconductor shells is a simple and feasible method. On the other hand, yellow-emitting CsPbBr3 (PL emission located at ca. 570 nm) can combine with low-dimensional blue-emitting CsPbBr3 NCs (PL emission located at ca. 460 nm) at a reasonable ratio to produce white light. Doping by metal cations can favor the preparation of highly stable yellow-light and blue-light emitting CsPbBr3 NCs, which is the key point towards the fabrication of EL WLEDs. Inspired by Tang's work,214 Cs2AgInCl6 and similar double perovskites with an efficient and stable emission of warm-white light may provide another opportunity for the fabrication of EL WLEDs in the future.
On the basis of the above discussion, we can conclude that although great progress has been made in the study of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs, more efforts should be devoted to exploring their practical applications. In comparison with the development of the traditional Cd-based QLEDs, the rapid growth of CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs is very surprising, which makes us believe that the practical application of the next-generation LEDs could come true over a fairly short time through extensive efforts and rational approaches. We hope the readers could gain some knowledge about the recent progress in CsPbX3 NC-based LEDs from this review article. More importantly, we hope this review article can encourage more readers to devote more efforts into this field and bring a bright future to this field.
