    , Accepted 25th August 2014First published on 27th August 2014AbstractWith a view to broadening the porphyrin light-harvesting cross section and improving mesoporous solar cell power conversion efficiency, pyrene-conjugated porphyrin dyes with various π-spacers between the porphyrin chromophore and carboxylic acid have been designed and synthesized in this study, including tailoring with phenyl (LW17), thiophene (LW18), and 2-phenylthiophene (LW19). These porphyrins show stepwise red-shifted absorption spectra and consistently decreased oxidation potential when the spacer changes from phenyl to an electron-rich unit of thiophene, and to an elongated spacer of 2-phenylthiophene, respectively, for LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes. A mesoporous solar cell based on LW18 dye can achieve an overall power conversion efficiency of 8.7% under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation. The result reveals that both photocurrent and photovoltage can be effectively tuned by changing the spacers. Detailed investigation with transient photovoltage decay measurements provides general information on factors affecting the principal photovoltaic parameters.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention on account of their various advantages, including low cost, ease of fabrication, and modifiable aesthetic features of color and transparency.1 Initial forms of this technology employed ruthenium complex sensitizers, achieving a certified solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 11%.2 However, the relatively high cost and environmental issues of ruthenium complexes encouraged the search for noble-metal-free light-harvesters.3 Porphyrins are particularly promising sensitizers in DSSCs due to their structural similarity to chlorophylls in natural photosynthetic systems, as well as their strong and tunable absorption properties. These properties lead to potential application of porphyrins in several areas, including optoelectronics, chemosensors, and catalysis.4 A new benchmark in DSSCs with overall PCE of 13.0% was achieved by a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) porphyrin (SM315) with a cobalt redox couple.5
Typical porphyrins present poor light-harvesting capability at wavelengths around 500 nm and beyond 700 nm.6 Fortunately, their absorption spectra can be red-shifted and broadened by elongation of π-conjugation, as well as by enhancement of the push–pull character in porphyrins.6 For example, Yeh et al. have proposed a new family of efficient sensitizers (D-π-A style) featuring a zinc porphyrin chromophore as π bridge, as well as donor and acceptor moieties at the meso-position. This creates a judicious directional electron flow from donor to acceptor moiety upon photoexcitation.7 In this case, the effects of an electron-donating substituent attached to the porphyrin chromophore have been addressed extensively,8 and pyrene-conjugated porphyrins have been demonstrated to be efficient donor and π-conjugation moieties. Highly efficient DSSC devices with PCE of over 10% were achieved by incorporating 4-ethynylbenzoic acid as acceptor.9 Meanwhile, it was found that by increasing the electron density of the anchoring group, one could lower a molecule's LUMO energy levels, and extend the light-harvesting area of the dye.10 For instance, oligomerthiophene, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl, diketopyrrolopyrrole, and other functional groups were successfully employed as π-spacers between the porphyrin chromophore and the anchoring group (carboxylic acid or cyanoacetic acid).11 Several investigations indicated that they possess an extended light-harvesting cross section, and therefore an improved device efficiency compared with sensitizers with 4-ethynylbenzoic acid as acceptor.11 More recently, Grätzel et al. reengineered the prototypical structure of the D–π–A porphyrin acceptor by inserting an electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit between the porphyrin chromophore and benzoic acid, affording sensitizers with broadened absorption spectra.12 High efficiency of 13% was achieved with the porphyrin SM315, which was superior to porphyrin SM371 with benzoic acid as acceptor. When the BTD unit was inserted directly between the porphyrin chromophore and the carboxylic acid, the corresponding DSSC was observed with a decreased PCE. In our previous study, the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) response of DSSCs was extended up to 850 nm by inserting an electron-rich unit (such as thiophene, EDOT, CPDT) between the porphyrin chromophore and cyanoacetic acid.13 Unfortunately, a decreased photovoltage was observed which could be ascribed to an increased recombination accelerated by the cyanoacetic acid anchoring group. This result could be also attributed to the H-aggregation of porphyrin dyes with rotary cyanoacetic acid on TiO2 nanoparticles. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Bisquert and Diau.14
As discussed above, a rigid molecular structure is essential for D–π–A porphyrins to reduce charge recombination at the dye-sensitized TiO2–electrolyte interface.15 According to Marcus theory, the electronic coupling between donor and acceptor decreases exponentially with increasing distance between them.16 Charge separation and electron injection after photoexcitation can be affected by tuning the π-spacer. Therefore, the π-spacer between porphyrin chromophore and anchoring group becomes one of the key issues in designing new pigments in order to further improve porphyrin-based DSSC device efficiency.
Herein, we report on an experimental investigation of porphyrin dyes by varying the spacer between porphyrin chromophore and carboxylic acid, with a view to broadening the light-harvesting area, and eventually improving DSSC performance.17 Based on the prototypical structure of pyrene–porphyrin conjugate as donor and π-conjugation moieties, phenyl, thiophene, and 2-phenylthiophene were selected as spacers to construct porphyrin dyes LW17, LW18, and LW19, respectively. LW19 dye is similar to the well-known GY50 dye when the electron-deficient BTD unit is switched with an electron-rich thiophene unit.12b LW18 dye is similar to porphyrin GY21.12 The motivation of our design of D-π-A porphyrin is to investigate the influence of electron-rich units as spacers on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices. These LW17, LW18 and LW19 dyes showed stepwise red-shifted absorption spectra and decreased oxidation potential when the spacer changed from phenyl to thiophene, and to an elongated spacer of 2-phenylthiophene. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) indicated a similar high hot-electron injection yield. Evaluating the porphyrins in DSSC devices, a PCE of 8.7% was achieved by LW18 devices under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation, whereas it was 7.8% for LW17 and 7.3% for LW19 devices. Transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurement was performed to investigate in detail the influence of π-spacer upon the optoelectronic features of porphyrin dyes in DSSCs.
Results and discussion
The molecular structures of LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins are presented in Scheme 1. Bearing the same pyrene–porphyrin conjugates as donor and carboxylic acid as acceptor, the spacer between porphyrin chromophore and carboxylic acid was varied with phenyl, thiophene, and 2-phenylthiophene. Detailed synthetic procedures are described in Scheme 2. The synthetic approach to these ethynyl-bridged porphyrins has been designed on the basis of Sonogashira coupling reaction reported by Lindsey et al.18 The starting reaction between the key precursor of 5,15-dibromo-10,20-bis[2,6-di(dodecyloxy)phenyl]porphyrin zinc(II) (coded as ZnPBr2)19 and 1-ethynylpyrene produced the green intermediate compound Por-1. Then, Por-1 was reacted with 4-ethynylbenzoic acid, 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid, or 4-(5-ethynylthiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid through Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction to obtain LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes. The structure and purity of all the intermediates and final compounds were identified by NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry and FTIR (see Fig. S1–S10 in ESI†).

The absorption spectra of LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins in THF are displayed in Fig. 1 and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. In THF solution, LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins exhibited progressively red-shifted absorption spectra. The maxima in the visible region were found at 469, 470, and 474 nm corresponding to the B band, and 674, 678 and 683 nm corresponding to the Q band, stemming from S0 → S2 transition and S0 → S1 transition, respectively.20 The absorption band of LW18 porphyrin (thiophene) was totally red-shifted compared to LW17 porphyrin (phenyl), indicating a positive effect upon the replacement of phenyl with thiophene. Further red-shifts of the absorption bands were observed in LW19 porphyrin (2-phenylthiophene). The absorption intensity of the B and Q bands decreases in the order of LW19 < LW18 < LW17, accompanying a gradual red-shift of the B and Q bands (LW17 < LW18 < LW19). The spectral change for these porphyrins can be interpreted in terms of decreasing symmetry and extended π-conjugation. These results are well consistent with the literature reports.21

Fig. S11† compares the absorption spectra of the synthesized porphyrins in THF with those on 2.3 μm TiO2 films. Only a short dye soaking time (about 2 min) was allowed, in order to avoid saturation of the B-band absorption. Thus, small amounts of porphyrins were adsorbed onto the TiO2 films. The B and Q bands of the porphyrin-sensitized films were slightly blue-shifted and considerably broadened compared to the solution spectra, indicating a slight H-aggregation of the adsorbed state of porphyrins on TiO2. The H-aggregation of porphyrins occurred when the transition dipole moments of molecules were aligned parallel (“face-to-face”).22

Fig. 2 presents the fluorescence emission spectra of LW17, LW18, and LW19. The major fluorescence emission bands were found at 686, 702, and 725 nm, showing mirror images of their Q bands. The same trend suggests that the various spacers affect porphyrins similarly in both light absorption and emission.

The electrochemical behavior of LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins was explored with cyclic voltammetry.23 The results are presented in Fig. S12† and Table 1. The values of the first oxidation potential (Eox) were calculated to be 0.91, 0.92, and 0.93 V (vs. NHE) for LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes, indicating gradually increasing HOMO energy levels. The HOMO–LUMO gaps were determined to be 1.83, 1.82, and 1.80 eV for the three dyes respectively, by calculating from the intersection of their absorption and emission spectra. Thus, the excited state dye energy levels (dye*/dye+) were estimated to be −0.92, −0.90 and −0.87 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Fig. 3 presents a schematic energy-level diagram of LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins, indicating that efficient dye regeneration and electron injection processes for LW17, LW18, and LW19 dye-sensitized TiO2 systems are all energetically favorable.24

Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level was used to gain insight into the molecular geometry, the molecular orbitals, and the nature of the electronic transition implied in the different absorption bands.25 The electronic orbital distributions and the corresponding energy levels are displayed in Fig. 4 and S13.† The synthesized dyes present a similar conformation, showing a planar pyrene–porphyrin conjugation structure with varying acceptors. The two meso-phenyl substituents bearing two dodecoxyl (–OC12H25) chains at the ortho-position of each porphyrin are perpendicular to the planar porphyrin conjugation. This configuration is beneficial for avoiding steric congestion around the meso-positions. The HOMOs of the new dyes are delocalized through the pyrene and porphyrin macrocycle, while their LUMO levels homogeneously distribute through the porphyrin core and carboxylic acid anchoring group. This configuration benefits an effective charge transfer across the compound upon excitation. The calculated absorption spectra show a first vertical excitation at 585 nm (2.12 eV), 605 nm (2.05 eV), and 611 nm (2.03 eV) for LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes, respectively. This result is consistent with the trend of the experimental values for the lowest-energy Q-bands at 674 nm (1.84 eV), 678 nm (1.83 eV) and 683 nm (1.82 eV) for the three dyes (see Fig. 1). The dipole moments of LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes were computed as 4.34, 5.79, and 4.79 D. The dipole moment is an indicator of push–pull electronic ability. A small dipole moment value corresponds to a weak push–pull character.26

TRPL measurement was performed to investigate electron injection from the photoexcited novel porphyrin dyes to a semiconducting photoanode.27Fig. 5 presents the decay plots of LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes in THF solution and the sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films filled with electrolytes used in the photovoltaic experiment. The TRPL decays of these porphyrins are extremely similar, which can be ascribed to the similar structure of the molecules except for the spacer. By considering the re-convolution of the instrument response function, the fluorescence lifetimes for LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins in THF were evaluated to be 1.325, 1.193 and 0.945 ns, respectively. LW18 and LW19 porphyrins present shorter fluorescence lifetime than LW17, which may be attributed to the twisted molecular structure of the former two dyes possessing a thiophene unit in the spacer. When the dyes were adsorbed onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface, strong quenching of the emission was observed as depicted in Fig. 5. The lifetimes of the excited singlet state of LW17, LW18, and LW19 porphyrins in the adsorbed state were estimated to be 44, 68 and 55 ps, respectively. The accelerated emission decay profiles of the novel porphyrins suggest that electron transfer from the excited state of the dyes to semiconductors is very fast and efficient.

The newly synthesized porphyrins were evaluated with DSSCs. By using an optimized binary solvent system of toluene and ethanol (volume ratio 1:1), the porphyrins were adsorbed onto a bilayer (7.5 + 5.0 μm) titania film to serve as a working electrode. The photovoltaic parameters, i.e., PCE, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF), of LW17, LW18, and LW19 are summarized in Table 2. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra are displayed in Fig. 6. The device based on LW18 (thiophene) exhibited a JSC of 17.27 ± 0.26 mA cm−2, a VOC of 700 ± 6 mV and a FF of 0.71 ± 0.02, giving a superior overall PCE of 8.74 ± 0.22%, while the corresponding values were 15.67 ± 0.22 mA cm−2, 688 ± 10 mV, 0.72 ± 0.02, and 7.81 ± 0.28% for LW17 (phenyl) and 15.42 ± 0.16 mA cm−2, 680 ± 4 mV, 0.68 ± 0.02, and 7.26 ± 0.16% for LW19 (2-phenylthiophene) under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation. For comparison, the reference porphyrin LD14 gave a PCE of 9.01% under similar conditions. These results are quite different from those for the electron-deficient BTD unit-modified porphyrin dyes.5,12 It was reported that the dyes (GY50 and SM315) with BTD inserted between the porphyrin chromophore and benzoic acid achieved a high efficiency of 13%,5,14b which was superior to the porphyrin (SM371) with benzoic acid acceptor. When connecting the porphyrin chromophore to carboxylic acid with BTD, the resulting GY21 porphyrin presented a poor PCE of only 4.8%. In this study, the results of LW17, LW18, and LW19 could be used to compare the effect of electron-rich units on device photovoltaic parameters. When thiophene was used to connect the porphyrin chromophore and carboxylic acid, the resulting LW18 device presented higher JSC values than that of the LW17 device. Insertion of a thiophene unit between the porphyrin chromophore and benzoic acid does not improve device performance. These results indicated that significantly different effects could be achieved when an electron-deficient or electron-rich unit was used to modify the porphyrin dyes. The relatively high JSC observed in the LW18 device might be attributed to an efficient inner charge transfer from the pyrene–porphyrin conjugate to the carboxylic acid through thiophene.12 As shown in Fig. 6b, the onset of IPCE responses of LW17, LW18, and LW19 devices extended from 720 nm, through 730 nm, to 740 nm, respectively, in general agreement with the electronic absorption spectra of dye-sensitized 2.3 μm thick titania films (see Fig. S11†). The extended IPCE of the LW18 device compared to that of the LW17 device should account for the higher JSC. It is worth noting that the LW19 device presented an extended IPCE response compared to the other two. Despite having excellent light-harvesting properties, the LW17, LW18, and LW19 dyes lack absorption in the 480 to 630 nm range, as evidenced by the IPCE spectra in Fig. 6b. The valley in the green spectral region would reduce the device photocurrent and hence the PCE. Co-sensitization is an effective method to avoid this loss, which combines two or more light-harvesters with complementary absorption spectra to realize full-spectrum light-harvesting.29 The VOC of LW18 (700 ± 6 mV) is higher than that of LW17 (688 ± 10 mV) and LW19 (680 ± 4 mV), which is discussed below.

TPD and charge extraction measurements were used to investigate the difference in VOC for DSSCs using the novel porphyrin dyes.28 Usually, a difference of VOC can originate from two major factors: (i) a shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge bending with respect to the electrolyte potential, and (ii) a difference in the e−-TiO2–electrolyte+ recombination reaction. Information about conduction band edge shift and the distribution of trap states of TiO2 could be provided by the chemical capacitance (Cμ).29b As shown in Fig. 7a, the Cμ is almost the same for the three devices at a high given voltage, while the slope of capacitance against open circuit voltage for the LW17 device is smaller than for the other two. This result indicates a steeper drop of the density of states below the conduction-band edge in the LW17 device. The relationship of electron lifetimes and VOC is plotted in Fig. 7b, affording an insight into the electron recombination occurring at the TiO2–electrolyte interface. A longer electron lifetime implies less of a recombination reaction on the dye-sensitized TiO2–electrolyte interface.6a The LW18 device presented an obviously longer lifetime compared to LW17 and LW19, indicating a reduced interfacial charge recombination in this device. The device fabricated with LW19 with the longest conjugation length exhibited the shortest electron lifetime. This result could be explained by the reduced molecule dipole moment of the LW19 dye.30 Therefore, the observed photovoltage variation of devices based on these novel porphyrins could be principally due to a different charge recombination reaction occurring at the dye-sensitized TiO2–electrolyte interface.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of pyrene-conjugated porphyrins with various π-spacers have been designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. As the π-spacer varied from phenyl (LW17 porphyrin), to thiophene (LW18 porphyrin), to 2-phenylthiophene (LW19 porphyrin), the resulting pigments showed stepwise red-shifted absorption spectra and consistently increased oxidation potential. Evaluating these novel dyes in DSSC devices, LW18 with the thiophene spacer showed a superior power conversion efficiency of 8.7% under full sunlight irradiation, higher than that of the LW17 device (7.8%) and the LW19 device (7.3%). This work demonstrates that connecting the porphyrin chromophore and carboxylic acid with an electron-rich thiophene unit is beneficial for both photocurrent and photovoltage.
