However, understanding the AIEE is a challenging task and is necessary for the rational molecular design of emitters. Therefore, in the present study, electron acceptors (–F, –CN, –NO2, and –COOH) on the benzothiadiazole ring have been screened for emission in solution and aggregated phases. Herein, we report QM (DFT/TDDFT) and ONIOM (QM/MM) studies on the four ArO–Btz derivatives in comparison with the parent molecule with typical characteristics of AIEE, optoelectronic and non-linear optical properties. Starting from the optimized crystal structure of the parent compound, the structures of the designed clusters have been pre-optimized with MM and then with QM/MM to explore their absorption and emission in the solid phase. The results indicate that in the aggregated phase, the surrounding environment reduces intra-molecular rotations and molecular motion that lead to enhanced emission. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses reveal that the ground state structure is stabilized from electron delocalization and operative push–pull effects. Interestingly, nitro-benzothiadiazole exhibits prominent AIEE phenomena, with an emission wavelength beyond 700 nm in solution and in the cluster, reinforced by the magnification of its oscillatory strength by 100 times when aggregated. This dinitro-aryloxy-benzothiadiazole derivative is proposed as a near-infrared emitter for dye-sensitized solar cell, optoelectronic, and non-linear optical applications.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as promising alternatives to silicon-based conventional photovoltaic solar cells, primarily due to their non-toxicity, abundance, less-complex fabrication methods, and low cost, whilst possessing decent power conversion efficiency, as reported by O’Regan and Grätzel.1–3 A plethora of iridium and ruthenium complexes have been employed as sensitizers in DSSCs.4–6 However, the limited availability of these metals coupled with their sophisticated synthesis has prompted the need for metal-free organic dyes for DSSC applications.7 In this context, the design of organic fluorophores for optoelectronic applications has seen tremendous growth in recent years.8–11 Organic solar cells derived from fullerenes have been the focal point in organic semiconductors for almost twenty years.12,13 In the last decade, non-fullerene-based acceptors have become important in organic semiconductor devices due to their tuneable molecular architecture, and more importantly, the discovery of non-fullerene acceptors.14,15 These molecules find a wide range of applications in the fields of organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, transistors, and molecular imaging.16–20 The amendable nature of their optical and electronic properties has led to the synthesis of a myriad of fluorescent organic compounds.8,21,22
However, in the solid phase, organic molecules suffer from a reduction in their emission. This arises from intermolecular π–π stacking interactions and molecular motion resulting in non-radioactive decays, a phenomenon also known as aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). To overcome this, research has been directed towards the synthesis of emitters with twisted conformations to restrict molecular rotations and/or vibrations in the aggregated form.23 As a result, the intensity with which these molecules emit light is more pronounced. This effect was first described by Tang's group,24 and is known as aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE). There have been substantial reports of molecules that exhibit AIEE including, tetraphenylene-bonded benzothiadiazole,25 alkynyl-bonded benzothiadiazole,26 and aryloxy-benzothiadiazole27 moieties.
Recently, Pazini et al. developed aryloxy benzothiadiazole (ArO–Btz) based aggregation-induced enhanced emitters which have attracted much attention.28 Designing efficient molecules for better optoelectronic properties requires a comprehensive understanding of the structure at the molecular level. Even though there have been extensive studies on the AIEE behaviour of organic molecules,29–33 tuning the same using appropriate substitutions are limited. In addition to these, the computational modelling of AIEE derivatives requires a better understanding of electronic properties in the solution and solid phases. This triggers our curiosity to envisage the AIEE properties of these ArO–Btz molecules and to gain insights into the structure–property relationship for regulation of their optoelectronic properties. Therefore, in this work, ArO–Btz derivatives are examined as candidates with better emissive characteristics using density functional theory and its time-dependent formulation (DFT/TDDFT) calculations in solution and aggregated phases. The objective of the present work is to (i) computationally design and model aggregated systems to understand their AIEE and (ii) systematically investigate and understand the impacts of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) namely, fluoro, cyano, nitro, and carboxylic acid groups as auxiliary acceptors, on the AIEE property of aryloxy-benzothiadiazole derivatives. Fig. 1 depicts the molecular structures of the compounds. DFT and combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations have been performed to illustrate the role of aggregation on emission. The role of the EWGs on the electronic and optical properties has been investigated using natural bond orbital analysis (NBO) and partial density of state analysis (PDOS). The non-linear optical and optoelectronic properties have been calculated to evaluate their suitability for application in dye-sensitized solar cells.

2. Methodology
Theoretical calculations based on DFT have been performed to divulge the optoelectronic properties of the designed candidates. We have studied the structure–property relationship of the designed candidates in solution and cluster using QM and two-step MM–QM/MM models respectively. The molecules considered in the present study are optimized to understand the electronic structure of the compounds at the singlet ground and excited states at the B3LYP/6-31+g(d,p)34–36 level. The optimized geometries are verified for their lowest minimum structure on the potential energy surface from harmonic frequency analyses. PDOS has been computed to investigate the contribution of atoms to the stabilization of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). The NBO method37–39 has been used to identify the ground state stabilizing interactions and electronic delocalization.40 The non-linear optical property has been evaluated from the first-order hyperpolarizabilities (β) of the molecules. The optimized geometries are subjected to TDDFT41 calculations to simulate the vertical excitations from the S0 → S1 state in gas and solvent phases at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31g(d)42,43 level. The S1 geometry was taken to compute the fluorescence of the molecule. Solvation has been accomplished with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)44,45 wherein the absorption has been recorded in cyclohexane, toluene, dichloromethane, and isopropanol solvents, while the emission was calculated in cyclohexane solvent as reported in the literature.28
To gain insights into the nature of the absorption and emission spectra at the aggregation-induced enhanced emission state, a two-layer ONIOM approach has been adopted.46 This approach requires a cluster of the molecules and an optimum number of molecules for the cluster has to be chosen to model AIEE. Therefore, we have computed the absorption and emission spectra of the parent molecule (HB) on clusters of different numbers of 8, 14, 24, 40, and 78 molecules (ESI,† Fig. S1). The results are compared with experimentally reported values (absorption and emission) and it is found that the 8 molecule cluster yields values closer to the experimental ones. Therefore, the aggregation effect is modeled using the ONIOM46 approach with QM/MM calculations using the cluster of 8 molecules. One molecule in the center is treated at the QM level while the MM level is applied to the remaining seven molecules. Theoretical calculations of the QM region have been done at the DFT/6-31G(d) level whereas the universal force field (UFF) was adopted for the MM region with charge equilibration. In the ONIOM calculations, an electronic embedding scheme was employed; this was adopted to incorporate the electrostatic interaction from the MM system in the QM Hamiltonian which allows the wave function to be polarized.46 Here, the optimization for the ground state geometry is modelled using DFT/B3LYP, whereas absorption (S0 → S1) and emission (S1 → S0) have been calculated using CAM-B3LYP within the TDDFT formalism.
To study AIEE in the aggregated phase for the designed molecules, starting with the optimized cluster of HB, the hydrogens are replaced with the EWGs. However, upon substitution, the packing in the cluster is found to be affected. The substituents are larger than the hydrogens and hence the intermolecular distances in the cluster are greatly reduced, which is to be expected. Therefore, molecular mechanics optimization has been performed with all atoms being treated as flexible in the cluster. This allowed the molecules to adopt equilibrium positions. The MM-optimized structure was then used as an input following the same ONIOM model as adopted for the parent molecule to obtain structural and spectral properties. All structures are confirmed to be the lowest energy structures on the potential energy surface with real frequencies from harmonic frequency analysis. All the calculations have been carried out with the Gaussian 09 program package.47 Gaussview and Chemcraft48 were used to visualize the results.
3. Results and discussion
In the present work, 4-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-7-(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl) benzo[c][1.2.5]thiadiazole (HB) (Fig. 1) is chosen as the reference compound from the reported aryloxy-benzothiadiazole derivatives with ArO–Btz–Ar’ architecture.28 To investigate the role of electron-withdrawing groups in tuning the AIEE character of HB, four new derivatives are designed by substituting the two hydrogens at C13 and C10 on the benzothiadiazole acceptor units with fluorine (–F), cyanide (–CN), nitro (–NO2) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups and are named FB, CB, NB, and CAB respectively. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on the structure–property relationship of the four ArO–Btz derivatives in solution and aggregated phase using QM and ONIOM models respectively, in comparison with HB as the reference for their electronic and optical properties. The individual molecule is referred to as a monomer throughout the study to compare with the cluster.
A. Molecular structures
The geometries of the monomer and clusters are analyzed to study the effect of the substituents. The structure of HB is obtained from its crystal structure (CCDC No. 1973509).28Fig. 2 depicts the optimized geometries of the molecules explored in the present study. The selected bond parameters for the monomers and QM molecules of the clusters are displayed in the ESI,† Table S1 [SIT 1]. For comparison purposes, the molecule is segmented into four fragments, namely Btz, Ar, ArO, and EWG groups for the benzothiadiazole, aryl, aryloxy, and electron-withdrawing groups respectively for comparative purposes. This fragmentation is shown in Fig. 3.

The optimized geometries of the molecules indicate that the Btz core, Ar, and ArO groups are non-planar and they adopt a twisted molecular architecture [Fig. 2]. Upon introducing different electron-withdrawing groups at the C13 and C10 positions, the twisting is intensified. For instance, in the reference HB molecule, the dihedral angle (φ1: C12–O2–C18–C21) is observed to be 98.78° while the same in the designed derivatives is observed to be between 137° and 147°. The maximum extent of twisting upon substitution is obtained for FB while CB shows the lowest angle of 137°. The observed changes between the ArO group and Btz arise from the presence of rotatable O2–C18 and O2–C12 bonds. Interestingly, the dihedral angle (φ2: C7–C9–C15–C16) between the Btz and Ar groups increases when the hydrogens are replaced by the EWGs. In HB, the φ2 is around 39°. However, the order of dihedral angle increases in the designed molecules as follows: HB < FB < CB < NB < CAB. This is in line with the increasing size of the substituents from fluorine to carboxylic acid. The C2–O18 bond of the aryloxy group also deviates from planarity. The dihedral angle between Btz and ArO (φ3: C13–C12–O2–C18) of HB is 1.82°, but it increases in the derivatives as HB < CB < NB < FB < CAB. CAB shows a hydrogen-bonding interaction between oxygen (O2) in ArO and hydrogen in COOH. As a result, φ3 is widened to 125° compared to other designed molecules (∼50°). All these observations indicate that introducing the electron-withdrawing groups on the Btz core results in increasing the non-planarity of the molecules in the isolated state.
In these molecules, the C9–C15 bond connects the Btz and Ar units. This does not undergo appreciable change (∼0.007 Å), though the groups undergo twisting upon substitutions. The O2–C18 bond connecting aryl and oxygen is found to have a slight change in its distance (∼0.015 Å), even though the aryl unit rotates and is found above the Btz plane. The O2–C12 bond connecting the Btz and ArO fragments, in the designed compounds are smaller than the parent compound except for CAB. It changes in the following order: CAB > HB > FB > CB > NB. The increase in CAB is due to the presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid group and O2 (COO–H–O2 = 1.835 Å). Concerning the C = C bonds in the benzene ring of the benzothiadiazole, the C7–C8, C8–C12, C7–C9, and C10–C13 bonds are found to be longer than the C12–C13 and C9–C10 bonds. The observed trend with the carbon–carbon bonds connecting the four units in these molecules as a whole is that the O2–C12, C12–C13 and C9–C10 bonds are shorter than the C7–C8, C8–C12, C7–C9, C10–C13, and O2–C18 bonds. The C–C bond lengths in these compounds are between 1.350 Å and 1.500 Å, implying that these molecules exhibit delocalization of electrons. The electronic delocalization has been dealt with in the upcoming section to understand the effect of the EWGs (Section III.B.).

Fig. 4 depicts the optimized geometries of the designed candidates in the cluster. From Fig. 4, and the computed bond parameters (SIT1), it can be observed that for all the derivatives, the O2–C12 bond is compressed whereas the O2–C18 bond is elongated compared with the HB. In these clusters, the angle (θ) between the Btz and ArO (C12–O2–C18) is larger than in the monomers. Additionally, for all the designed candidates, the dihedral angle between Btz and ArO groups (φ3) and Btz and Ar units (φ2) in the cluster has decreased in comparison with their respective monomeric units. On the other hand, an increase in dihedral angle can be observed between the phenyl ring of the ArO and Btz–O groups (φ1). Again, the C–C bond lengths in the benzene ring of Btz are in line with the observations for the monomers, indicating a delocalized structure. These findings indicate a twisted structure with a reduced non-planarity than the monomer in the aggregated form of the proposed molecules.

B. NBO analysis
To understand the effect of electron-withdrawing groups on the electronic structure, the push–pull effect has been studied for the monomers using NBO analysis. Kleinpeter and his coworkers have quantified the push–pull effect in double bonds in organic compounds and have reported a linear dependence of the occupation numbers on the bond lengths.49–51 Therefore, the push–pull effect in HB, FB, CB, NB, and CAB has been studied and is depicted in Fig. 5 for C9–C10, C10–C13, and C12–C13 bonds. The occupancy numbers (occupancy for anti-bonding orbital/occupancy for bonding orbital) of these three bonds have been calculated and plotted against the bond lengths. The ratio of the occupation numbers of the antibonding orbital (π* or σ*) to that of the bonding orbital (π or σ) gives the occupancy quotient. For π orbitals, the occupation quotient is denoted as  and for σ orbitals, the occupation quotient is denoted as . SIT 2 (ESI†) lists the occupancy number for the selected bonds. From SITs 1 and 2 (ESI†), a direct correlation can be observed between the bond lengths and occupancy numbers. For C10–C13, the bond lengths for the derivatives are more than 1.420 Å. The corresponding occupancy numbers for the C10–C13 bond in the molecules are less than 0.05. On the other hand, the bond lengths for C9–C10 and C12–C13 are less than 1.400 Å and the occupancy number corresponding to these bonds is greater than 0.10. The occupancy number for FB, CB, and NB are higher than HB except for CAB. This is due to the increased bond length as a result of the presence of a hydrogen bond in CAB. From SIT 2 (ESI†) and Fig. 5, the bonds connecting C9 and C10, and C12 and C13 show push–pull effects operating and these are π bonds. However, C10–C13 is a σ bond that shows an increased occupancy number (0.0067 in HB) upon introducing electron-withdrawing groups (to approximately 0.10). For the σ bonds, due to low occupancy in the antibonding orbital, the occupancy number is 10 orders of magnitude less than that of the π bonds. The occupancy numbers for C9–C15 are not found to change significantly with a change in substituents, indicating constancy in the bond lengths, as mentioned in Section 3.1. The percentage of contribution of the p orbital to a bond influences its π character. SIT 3 (ESI†) lists the percentage of the ‘p’ character of selected bonds in the molecules. Within the Btz, the C7–C8, C7–C9, C7–C9, C8–C12, and C10–C13 bonds are σ bonds with partial π-bonding. However, C12–C13 and C9–C10 are π bonds (99% ‘p” character) showing a push–pull effect. Therefore, the introduction of EWGs results in the origin of the push–pull effect at the Btz-OAr linkage in the molecule.
 Fig. 5  Push–Pull effect in the vicinity of the substituents. 
The ground-state molecules thus have shortened Btz–oxygen (C12–O2) and elongated oxygen-phenyl (O2–C18) bonds arising from the push–pull effect. The electronic delocalization arising as a result of the push–pull effect can be observed in the form of the stabilizing interactions from the second-order perturbation theory analysis in the NBO calculations. This is tabulated in SIT 4 (ESI†). The π–π* and n–π* delocalizations are seen in all the designed molecules. In NB, additional n–σ* interactions can also be observed indicative of the presence of a resonance effect in the molecules. Additionally, the ‘p’ character in the hybrid descriptors of O2 in O2–C12 and O2–C18 bonds are presented in Table 1. As expected, the O2–C18 bonds in all the compounds have similar hybrid descriptors for the p orbitals of oxygen (2.14–2.22) in line with their bond lengths. On the other hand, for O2–C12, the p hybrids decrease for the O2–C12 bond, which is in line with the decreasing bond lengths, with an exception for CAB due to the hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atom and the carboxylic acid's proton. As a result, its σ character decreases for CB and NB. These results indicate that the ArO-group contributes to electronic delocalization with the Btz group upon introducing the electron-withdrawing groups for hydrogen. Therefore, it can be inferred that, upon substituting the EWGs for hydrogen, increased conjugation has been achieved.

C. FMO analysis
The reactivity, stability, electronic and optical properties of a molecule can be understood from the analysis of their frontier molecular orbitals.52 The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO & HOMO−1) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO & LUMO+1) are portrayed in Fig. 6. In the parent molecule, HB, the HOMO is delocalized between the Btz and Ar groups, whereas the ArO group makes up HOMO−1. The LUMO is principally positioned over the Btz core. However, the LUMO+1 is spread throughout the molecule. In these molecules, the LUMO is primarily delocalized over the Btz core, however, the LUMO+1 is spread throughout the molecule. This indicates that π–π* transitions (HOMO → LUMO) and weak charge transfer transitions (HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1) are possible. However, in all of the designed molecules, upon introducing EWGs, the ArO group also contributes to the HOMO, which previously had only minor contributions from the oxygen (O2) of the aryloxy group. Upon introducing fluorine for hydrogen, the HOMO−1 and HOMO are spread throughout the molecule, whereas the LUMO is principally found on the Btz core. This gives rise to π–π* transitions. On the other hand, replacing the hydrogens with –CN, –NO2, or –COOH results in the ArO fragment being chiefly responsible for the stabilization of HOMO in addition to it being spread over the molecule. On the other hand, the HOMO−1 is spread throughout the system. The LUMO and LUMO+1 are largely due to the Btz core and the oxygen atom attached to it. As a result, the π–π* transitions are more predominant than charge transfer transitions.
 Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbitals of benzothiadiazole derivatives. 
To quantify the contributions of the fragments to the HOMO and LUMO, PDOS analysis has been carried out using QMForge software.53–55 The computed PDOS is represented in Fig. 7, wherein the lower portion is for the HOMO, while the upper portion is for the LUMO. The corresponding values are given in SIT 5 (ESI†). It can be observed that with an increase in the size of the substituents, the Ar group contributes to the lower amounts in the HOMO. This is due to the increasing dihedral angle (φ2: C7–C9–C15–C16) between the Ar and Btz groups. Interestingly, fluorine has the highest contribution (34%) to LUMO compared to that of all EWGs. Among the different substituents, cyano contributes to 25% of the stabilization of the HOMO in CB which is from the unsaturated carbon–nitrogen triple bond. On the other hand, the cyano, nitro and carboxylic acid groups induce higher contributions from the ArO group for the stabilization of both the HOMO and LUMO. The same observation can be understood from the NBO analysis of the push–pull effect operating in CB, NB, and CAB in Section 3.2. The observations in the FMO diagrams are further substantiated by the PDOS analysis. These observations reveal that the prosthetic nature of the ArO group in HB in contributing towards the HOMO and LUMO has been minimized by allowing it to participate in electronic delocalization.
 Fig. 7  Orbital contribution of Btz, Ar, Ar–O, and EWG towards the HOMO and LUMO. 
The electronic levels of HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 are represented in Fig. 8. From the figure, it can be observed that the HOMO–LUMO gap decreases upon the replacement of hydrogen with EWGs. Of all derivatives, the nitro substituent has the lowest HOMO–LUMO gap with 2.75 eV. The HOMO–LUMO gap in FB and CAB are closer to each other as for CB and NB. The LUMO of these compounds is stabilized as NB > CB > CAB > FB > HB, while the HOMO is stabilized as CAB > NB > CB > FB > HB. It is well known that for DSSC applications, the dye molecules are expected to have a HOMO closer to the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte to favor electron recovery. Alternatively, a LUMO level closer to the conduction band of TiO2 will facilitate easier electron injection to the conduction band.56 For all the designed candidates, the HOMO levels (−6.41 to −5.72 eV) are lower than that for the I−/I3− redox couple (−4.80 eV).57 Therefore, the regeneration of the oxidized dye is thermodynamically favorable.58 On the other hand, the LUMO levels of these systems (−3.26 to −0.83 eV) are higher than the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV).59 Hence, the electron that is excited from the HOMO to the LUMO level can be transferred with much ease to the conduction band of TiO2, more easily in CB and NB. The inferred stability of the molecules is further substantiated by the stabilizing interactions observed in NBO studies [Section III.B. & SIT 4, ESI†]. The EWGs result in increased delocalization by involving the almost non-stabilizing ArO group. As a result, they are responsible for the increased stability of the candidates.
 Fig. 8  Frontier molecular orbitals of the benzothiadiazole derivatives; the HOMO–LUMO gap (in eV) is indicated with an arrow. 
Upon aggregation, the HOMO–LUMO separation in FB becomes greater than HB but reduces for the remaining compounds [SIT 6, ESI†]. For instance, in the cluster, HB has a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.24 eV, and the same increases to 3.32 eV for FB. However, CB and NB are the most stable structures in the clusters, with a HOMO–LUMO separation of 2.86 eV and 2.76 eV respectively, as predicted for the single entity. Again, the LUMO and HOMO levels are stabilized to a greater extent in the designed molecules, indicating an efficient electron transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 and a more favorable regeneration of the dye in the clusters. However, in aggregated form, FB is destabilized from the increased HOMO–LUMO gap. Therefore, the designed candidates (except for FB) in the cluster can be promising materials for DSSC applications.
D. TDDFT studies
To model the excited state properties of absorption and emission, a suitable functional must be selected that will yield results in accordance with the experimental λmax values from the TDDFT calculations.60 Therefore, a set of hybrid, dispersion-corrected, PBE-hybrid, meta-hybrid, τ-dependent gradient-corrected and range – separated hybrid XC functionals (B3LYP,34,36 ωB97XD,61 PBE0,62 M06-2X,63 BMK,64 and CAM-B3LYP42) are employed to compute the absorption maxima of HB in conjugation with the 6-31g(d) basis set [SIT 7, ESI†]. The results reveal that M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and BMK XC functionals predict values with reduced deviations from the experimentally reported HB. The geometry of the S1 state is then optimized at the M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and BMK functionals to compute the S1 → S0 emission. The fluorescence values (λmax) obtained using the CAM-B3LYP XC functional with the 6-31g(d) basis set is closer to the experimental values and is employed for all TD-FT calculations. The recently reported QM/MM calculations employed the 6-31g(d) basis set and hence the same is adopted here for comparing the TDDFT results between the solvent and cluster models.65,66

D.1. Absorption spectra. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the derivatives were recorded in the gas phase and in four different solvents: cyclohexane, toluene, dichloromethane, and 2-propanol, as reported earlier. The TDDFT results of the absorption spectra are given in Table 2 and SIT 8 (ESI†). In solution, the λmax values increase in the following order: CAB < FB < HB < CB < NB. The unmodified parent compound (HB) absorbs at 374 nm in cyclohexane. All transitions are between the singlet ground state (S0) and singlet excited state (S1) and these transitions are allowed, as indicated by the non-zero oscillator strengths. The transition responsible for the absorption maxima is between the HOMO and LUMO levels (95%) in HB. However, when the EWGs are introduced for the hydrogens, the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition also contributes to the absorption maxima. For example, CB shows an intense peak with an oscillatory strength of 0.210 due to HOMO → LUMO (77%) and HOMO−1 → LUMO (16%) transitions. NB tends to show 7% and 4% contribution from the HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1 transition respectively in addition to 79% from the HOMO → LUMO transition. These transitions are due to π–π* excitations. Moreover, the solvatochromism is only ±2 nm. Therefore, charge transfer transitions are not observed.

Pazini et al.28 reported that HB, upon aggregation, tends to show a red-shift in the absorption spectra in the solid phase and our calculations corroborate the experimental findings. For instance, experiments show that HB absorbs at 395 nm in cyclohexane and 406 nm in the solid state. Our calculations show an intense peak at 366 nm in cyclohexane which increases to 398 nm in the aggregated state. In the aggregated form, the λmax is red-shifted for all designed molecules except FB, for which the peak is blue-shifted by 10 nm. This is due to the increased separation between the HOMO and LUMO levels of FB in the cluster [SIT 6, ESI†]. Table 3 lists the key results in the UV-Vis spectrum for the aggregated systems. The excitations are allowed transitions from S0 to S1. The transitions are between the HOMO and LUMO levels in the clusters, which is typically contrasting when considering the monomers, wherein transitions were observed from the HOMO−1 and HOMO levels to the LUMO and LUMO+1 levels. The reason for this lies in the structure of the compound. The dihedral angle (φ2) between the planes consisting of the Btz and Ar groups decreased upon aggregation. However, the dihedral angle (φ1 and φ3) between the ArO and Btz groups underwent small changes when replacing hydrogens with EWGs. This reduction in changes of the dihedral angle between aryloxy and benzothiadiazole groups indicates that the surrounding environment does not freely allow rotation of the aryloxy group as observed in the solution. Slightly increased changes (approx. 10°) can be seen for φ3 of FB and CB. In addition, the frontier molecular orbitals are progressively stabilized for the aggregated phase in comparison to their monomer counterparts as given in SIT 6 (ESI†). Therefore, as a result of aggregation, the decrease in the dihedral angle between the Btz and Ar groups coupled with stabilization of the FMOs and restricted rotation of the ArO group account for the observed red shift in the absorption maxima for CB, NB, and CAB.

D.2. Emission spectra. 
The calculated emission spectra and the corresponding oscillator strengths of the compounds in cyclohexane (for monomers) and aggregated form are presented in Table 4. Emission in these molecules arises due to the S1 → S0 transition and non-zero oscillator strengths indicate that the designed candidates are fluorescent.67 In cyclohexane, the emission for HB is observed around 488 nm which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 485 nm. Upon replacing the hydrogen with fluorine/carboxylic acid groups, this is decreased to 464 nm/467 nm respectively. However, the emission wavelength is red-shifted for CB (570 nm) and NB (756 nm), with a weaker oscillator strength than their counterparts. Upon aggregation, the λmax increased by 20 nm for HB to 508 nm and decreased for fluorine by 13 nm to 451 nm. This is due to the increased HOMO–LUMO gap in the aggregated phase. As a result, fluorine substitution results in a blue shift in the emission, with a slight increase (∼0.1) in the emission intensity (f0) than HB. The cyano substituent, which had caused an increase in the λmax to 570 nm in solution, decreased the emission to 504 nm for the cluster, albeit a stronger oscillator strength for the aggregate than for the monomer. In CB, φ2 is least among all compounds; this indicates a reduction in the non-planarity between the Ar and Btz groups. Hence, CB exhibits enhanced emission with a blue shift upon aggregation. The nitro substituted compound exhibited a λmax at 784 nm, with an oscillator strength a hundred times more in the cluster than in cyclohexane. This indicates the presence of aggregation-induced emission operating in NB. However, in CAB this effect was less observed, even though the emission wavelength had increased by nearly 80 nm from 467 nm to 540 nm. The absence of hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic acid group and ether oxygen could be attributed to this change.

To understand the AIEE nature of the designed compounds, an understanding of the mechanism and the extent to which the intramolecular vibrations and rotations occur in the molecule during the fluorescence from S1 to S0 is necessary.68,69 Reports on the reduction of intramolecular motion and restriction of intramolecular motion being responsible for AIEE can be found in the literature.70,71 This has been accomplished by calculating the root mean squared deviation between the S0 and S1 geometries (Fig. 9). Comparing the ground state and excited state structures, the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) is greater in the case of monomers than the molecule in the QM region of the cluster. It is important to note that the extent to which the RMSD has decreased [ΔRMSD = RMSD (monomer) − RMSD (cluster)] upon aggregation is maximum in NB. This reveals that the molecular motions have been greatly restricted in NB. CB stands in second place for this difference. SIT 9 (ESI†) lists the key bond parameters in the excited state, from which it is evident that the dihedral angle (φ2) between the Btz and Ar groups has decreased for CB, NB, and CAB only upon aggregation but is still far from planarity. Hence a twisted architecture is still maintained. Moreover, the dihedral angles φ1 and φ3 that represent the free rotation of the aryloxy group with respect to the Btz ring are found not to deviate to a greater extent as occurred in solution for the monomer. Hence, upon aggregation, the free rotation of the aryloxy group is also restricted in the excited state. Therefore, the surrounding environmental molecules account for the reduced RMSD of the QM region upon aggregation.72 As a result, there will be a greater possibility for the energy to be emitted radiatively and not utilized for molecular motions (rotations and vibrations), ultimately assisting in enhanced luminescence in the aggregation phase.73,74 Comparing the molecular structures and their fluorescence results from the TDDFT calculations, it is clear that the introduction of nitro groups induces the AIEE effect upon aggregation. The decreased molecular motions when fluorescing from S1 to S0 (from RMSD values for the QM part for the cluster) and reduced ΔRMSD values are responsible for the magnification of the oscillator strength for NB. However, a decrease in the emission wavelength for CB upon aggregation relative to the solution can be observed and the widening of the HOMO–LUMO gap could be one of the possible reasons for this. However, CB also exhibits similar RMSD values between the ground and first excited states and NB showed the second-best ΔRMSD. Therefore, its oscillator strength increases by ten times upon aggregation, and hence, displays an aggregation induced blue shift in emission. Interestingly, NB fluoresces in the near infrared region (>700 nm). On the other hand, it is important to note that FB has comparable ΔRMSD in solution and cluster, and hence neither the fluorine substituent nor its surrounding environment is assistive in promoting AIEE.

E. Optoelectronic properties
To evaluate the optoelectronic application of the designed candidates as dye sensitizers in DSSCs, the first-order hyperpolarizability (β0), light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and radiative lifetime have been calculated75 and are presented in Table 5. Since these organic molecules contain D–A linked units, they usually exhibit non-linear optical (NLO) activity, for which β0 provides a quantitative approach. The first-order hyperpolarizability is a third rank tensor, described by a 3 × 3 × 3 matrix, that can be reduced to 10 components according to Kleinman symmetry.76 From Table 5, the calculated β0 values show an excellent correlation with the HOMO–LUMO gap. For all the designed candidates, the calculated hyperpolarizability values are higher than the parent compound, a finding indicative of their better NLO performance than their parent compound, substantiating the decrease in band gap upon modification of the Btz core with EWGs. The HOMO–LUMO gap is lowest for NB, which demonstrates the best NLO response which is in line with the literature.

Another important factor governing the application of a dye towards DSSC lies in its ability to absorb photons and eject the electron to the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor. This was briefly discussed in Section 3.3, with respect to the energy of the LUMO in each molecule. To further confirm this argument, LHE77 has been calculated for the molecules considered in the present study (Table 5) and it is evident that aggregation has improved their LHE in these designed compounds. This is due to the progressive stabilization of the FMOs upon aggregation. Aggregation also reduced the dihedral angle (ϕ2) between the Btz and Ar group thereby increasing the oscillator strength for the absorption from the HOMO to LUMO.
Moreover, the light-emitting efficiency of these systems has been evaluated by calculating the radiative lifetime (τ) using:77 τ = 1.499/f0E2(1)where E is the emission energy in cm−1 and f0 is the oscillator strength of the electronically excited state. The radiative lifetimes for HB, FB, and CAB are similar in both isolated and aggregated forms. However, CB and NB which have large τ in the monomeric units, show improved results in aggregated form, further indicating that aggregation promotes the emissive property of these molecules. To explain why the radiative lifetime is better in the cluster, it should be noted that the RMSD of CB and NB decreased greatly upon aggregation, indicative that molecular motions are less allowed. In other words, the energy responsible for emission is not emitted non-radiatively. This was mentioned in the previous section and this can be correlated with the increased oscillator strength. While the RMSD decreases in the cluster for CB and NB, for these two molecules their oscillator strength for the S1 → S0 emission has increased (Table 4). The increased oscillator strength and decreased RMSD are responsible for the better radiative lifetimes in the clusters. Therefore, from these observations, cyano and nitro groups improve the AIEE property of the Ar–O–Btz–Ar type of molecules.
In summary, we have attempted to design better emitters with AIEE phenomena by replacing hydrogens with electron-withdrawing groups and their electronic structure has been characterized. This has been studied as an isolated molecule in solution and clusters with the help of QM/MM calculations. To model clusters of the designed candidates, we have performed MM optimization to equilibrate the clusters to reduce unfavorable interactions in the cluster and studied it subsequently with QM/MM calculations. The molecular design should maintain the twisted molecular architecture to avoid π–π stacking but improve upon the existing electronic features. By introducing electron-withdrawing groups as auxiliary acceptors to the benzothiadiazole ring, the acceptor unit is made more electron-deficient, but the twisted architecture is maintained. The nitro group turns out to be the most impactful in enhancing the AIEE phenomenon. The design of AIEE-active compounds has been evaluated by analyzing their electronic structure and how it is affected in the presence of different electron-withdrawing groups. The AIEE property of the designed compounds has been validated with TDDFT calculations in solvent as the monomer and in clusters as aggregates. The emission spectra reveal the changes in the electronic structure of the molecules between the ground and excited-state responsible for the AIEE activity. These are the RMSD, ΔRMSD, and oscillator strengths. Finally, the suitability of the designed compounds for optoelectronic applications has been studied. LHE and radiative lifetime can be employed as parameters to understand their optoelectronic applications. With this approach, we have modelled AIEE for nitro benzothiadiazole and it is found to emit in the near-infrared region.
4. Conclusions
Combining QM and ONIOM (QM/MM) calculations in the ground and excited states, the AIEE of aryloxy-benzothiadiazole derivatives (–F, –CN, –NO2, and –COOH as substituents) has been studied for optoelectronic applications in solution and aggregated phases respectively. Our results show that the derivatives exhibit twisted structures with an electronic push–pull effect which is established by NBO analysis, necessary for the AIEE property and optoelectronic applications. The electron-withdrawing substituents are found to reduce the HOMO–LUMO separation favouring their application as emitters in solar cells. FMO contribution analyses reveal that the aryloxy group stabilizes the NB, CB, and CAB while it is not involved in the stabilization of HB and FB molecules, enhancing its participation in electronic delocalization of the molecule. The designed candidates demonstrate better NLO properties than the parent compound. In solution, the absorption and emission spectra of cyano and nitro derivatives are red-shifted compared to other derivatives. However, upon aggregation, nitro and carboxylic units made the benzothiadiazole a more electron-deficient unit, while the cyano group shifts the emission to lower wavelengths than the parent compound but with a more emissive nature. QM/MM calculations reveal that an increase in the radiative lifetime and light-harvesting efficiency upon aggregation indicates that both cyano and nitro result in better AIEEgenic molecules. Interestingly, when the nitro group is introduced, a near-infrared emission is achieved both in solution and aggregated phase with a nearly non-emissive nitro-Btz displaying strong emission characteristics upon aggregation. The molecular motion in NB has been restricted upon aggregation and hence it emits radiatively displaying greater oscillator strength in the aggregated form. This study reveals that all the designed candidates are qualified to be organic emitters for DSSC applications. In summary, the approach to model AIEE for derivatives without a crystal structure with MM optimization followed by a QM/MM study will enable in designing better candidates for optoelectronic applications. Moreover, RMSD, ΔRMSD, and oscillator strength are useful parameters to explain the phenomenon of AIEE in the designed candidates. A more accurate computational exploration of AIEE could be accomplished by employing molecular dynamics simulations instead of MM optimization and this is in the pipeline.
