    , Accepted 7th September 2018First published on 7th September 2018AbstractThe past two decades have witnessed significant progress in the field of organic electronics, especially polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), which provide a promising opportunity for applications in flexible and wearable devices. Thanks to the efforts of the rapid development of p-type semiconducting polymeric materials and device optimization, an impressive hole mobility over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and power conversion efficiency near 15% have been achieved in PTFTs and PSCs, respectively. However, the development of electron deficient semiconducting polymers for ambipolar/n-type PTFTs and polymer donor–polymer acceptor type PSCs (all-PSCs) lags far behind. Therefore, the design and synthesis of new electron-deficient semiconducting polymers have attracted increasing attention during the past five years. This review attempts to critically summarize the recent molecular design strategies with respect to the electron-deficient semiconducting polymers. These polymers have demonstrated interesting electronic properties and promising performances as active layers in ambipolar/n-type PTFTs and all-PSCs. The molecular structural implications related to the ambipolar/n-type device performances of the PTFTs and all-PSCs are discussed.

1. Introduction
Semiconducting polymers have been receiving considerable attention in both the fundamental sciences and applied research fields due to their tantalizing possibilities used in various organic electronics, such as polymer solar cells (PSCs)1–4 and polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs).5–7 These devices can be implemented into promising integrated applications, such as flexible and washable electricity-generating clothing and skin electronics as shown in Fig. 1.8–10

With the help of modern organic synthetic protocols, high-quality semiconducting polymers can be obtained by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling polycondensation, such as the Sonogashira,11 Heck,12 Suzuki–Miyaura,13 and Stille coupling polycondensations,14 catalyst-transfer condensation polymerization,15–17 and the state-of-the-art direct arylation polycondensation (DArP).18 In parallel with the development of promising electron-rich (donor) building blocks, a significant number of donor–acceptor (D–A) type electron-donating (p-type) semiconducting polymers with a hole mobility over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 in PTFTs19,20 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 15% in PSCs21–26 have been synthesized. However, much less attention has focused on the electron-deficient semiconducting polymers. This is mainly because the development of high-performance electron-deficient semiconducting polymers is still highly challenging due to the following reasons:27,28 (1) a lack of strong electron-deficient building blocks. The useful acceptor units are limited to some dye molecules, such as naphthalene diimide (NDI), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), isoindigo (IID) and their derivatives. In order to develop more promising electron-deficient polymers, the exploration of new acceptor building blocks is highly desired; (2) the synthetic challenges in developing semiconducting polymers with low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The high-performance semiconducting polymers usually possess backbones with an alternating donor–acceptor structure. As a matter of fact, most D–A polymers tend to exhibit ambipolar or rather p-type charge transport properties. This is mainly because the electron-donors, such as thiophene, bithiophene and thienothiophene, lower the electron affinity of the resulting polymers, leading to shallower LUMO levels. As a consequence, it would impair efficient electron transport. Therefore, new polymer backbone design strategies should be developed; (3) limited stability of the devices under ambient conditions. Electron-deficient polymers are vulnerable because the charge carriers can be easily trapped by water and oxygen under ambient conditions, and non-encapsulated semiconducting polymers can hardly maintain n-type characteristics when exposed to air. One solution to solve this problem is to encapsulate the devices. In the case of PTFTs, high performance and stability are achieved by using the top gate/bottom contact (TG/BC) device structure because the dielectric layer, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and CYTOP, also acts as an encapsulating layer on the top of the semiconducting polymer layer. Another solution is to chemically block the reaction between the semiconductor layer and oxygen/water. In other words, polymers should have intrinsically high air-stability. The design and synthesis of new electron-deficient polymers with both deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels is the key to solving this problem.
In order to realize potential p–n-junction-based flexible and wearable electronic device applications, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-like logic circuits,29,30 organic thermoelectrics (OTEs),31–38 all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs),39–46 and organic photodetectors (OPDs),47–51 high-mobility and air-stable electron-deficient semiconducting polymers are in great demand. Therefore, viable approaches toward the design and synthesis of electron-deficient semiconducting polymers have been proposed.52–54
In this review, we will describe the electron-deficient polymers for PTFTs and all-PSCs. PTFTs are voltage-controlled three-terminal switching devices. One typical PTFT device is composed of a gate electrode (Si), a dielectric layer (SiO2), source/drain electrodes (Au) and a polymeric semiconductor layer (see Chart 1 top right corner). According to the polarity of the dominant charge carriers in the transistor channel, semiconducting polymers can be typically classified as p-type (hole dominant), n-type (electron dominant), or ambipolar (both carriers). Since the direction of the current is parallel to the source/drain electrodes, the edge-on packing of the polymer backbone is regarded to be ideal for PTFTs. On the other hand, the active layer of all-PSCs, consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors, is sandwiched between the ITO anode and Ag cathode (see Chart 1 bottom right corner). Since the current flows between the anode and cathode, the face-on packing of the polymer backbone is suitable for all-PSCs.
 Chart 1  Design strategy of electron-deficient semiconducting polymers and the device structures of ambipolar/n-channel transistors and all-polymer solar cells. 
From the viewpoint of the energy levels for the efficient electron injection and transport, an effective approach to achieve promising electron deficient semiconducting polymers is to deepen their LUMO energy levels to near or below −4.0 eV.55 Therefore, the following two effective molecular design strategies could be adopted: (1) introducing electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs, such as fluorine, sp2-nitrogen, and cyano groups) into the D–A polymer backbones; and (2) modifying the D–A polymer backbones by introducing another acceptor building block, namely, the “D–A1–D–A2” backbone strategy or “acceptor dimerization” (vide infra).56 While the former approach may readily give high performance by modifying the backbone of previously reported p-type polymers with high hole mobilities, the introduction of EWGs is sometimes not so straightforward due to the necessity of multistep organic syntheses. On the other hand, the “D–A1–D–A2” backbone strategy or “acceptor dimerization” can be achieved by using a coupling reaction. However, the device performances may not be remarkable in some cases due to other problems, such as non-planar polymer backbones.
Based on the above design strategies, quite a few novel electron-deficient semiconducting polymers have recently been reported. Therefore, it is an appropriate time to summarize the recent results of high-performance electron-deficient semiconducting polymers and discuss their molecular structure–device performance relationships in order to further propose several design guidelines for future material development. In this review, we will focus on the molecular design strategies and molecular structure–device performance (PTFTs or all-PSCs) relationships (Chart 1). Section 2 will discuss the design strategies of the “introduction of electron-withdrawing groups” and Section 3 will focus on the “polymer backbone modification”. Finally, a summary of the remaining challenges is provided.
2. Introduction of electron-withdrawing groups
2.1 Fluorine substitution
The fluorine (F) substitution of semiconducting polymers leads to several unique advantages: (1) F substitution causes little steric hindrance due to its small van der Waals radius (r) of 1.35 Å, which is slightly larger than that of H (r = 1.20 Å);57 (2) F substitution can lower both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which may facilitate the electron injection and transport;58 and (3) F atoms can induce intramolecular or intermolecular F⋯H and F⋯S interactions, which may enhance the backbone planarity and improve the thin film crystallinity.59–63
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers are promising candidates for PTFTs as well as PSCs because of their high charge carrier mobilities, narrow optical bandgaps and high absorption coefficients.64–66 However, the DPP unit is usually copolymerized with a variety of donor-type comonomers, such as thiophene, bithiophene and thienothiophene moieties.67–69 In order to further improve the electron affinity of the DPP-based semiconducting polymers, Thelakkat et al. used the electron-deficient 3,4-difluorothiophene (FT) as the comonomer.70 Therefore, two DPP-based polymers, namely P1-1 without F and P1-2 with F, were synthesized to investigate the effect of the fluorination (Table 1). The fluorinated polymer P1-2 showed a deeper HOMO level of −5.91 eV when compared to its non-fluorinated counterpart P1-1 (−5.75 eV). However, fluorination did not significantly contribute to the lowering of the LUMO energy level in this case. Indeed, P1-1 and P1-2 had similar LUMO levels (−3.69 and −3.70 eV, respectively). Nevertheless, the PTFTs based on the fluorinated P1-2 showed an enhanced n-type charge transport property with a μh/μe of 0.22/0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, its non-fluorinated counterpart P1-1 displayed only a unipolar p-type charge-transport performance.70 The WAXS measurements of the bulk samples revealed that P1-2 had close π–π stacking with a distance of 3.65 Å, which was much shorter than that of the non-fluorinated counterpart (3.86 Å). This result indicated that the introduction of F atoms could induce a higher rigidity of the backbone and stronger π–π interactions.

Another important thiophene-based donor monomer is (E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene (TVT), which has been used to construct a promising π-extended DPP-based p-type polymer (P1-3) with very high hole mobilities ranging from 3 to 8 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported by different research groups.71,72 In order to endow P1-3 with electron charge transport properties, a fluorinated TVT unit, namely, (E)-1,2-bis(3-fluorothiophen-2-yl)ethene (FDTE), was introduced to the polymer backbone, thus forming a fluorinated TVT-polymer P1-4 (Table 1).73 Promisingly, P1-4 displayed a deeper LUMO energy level of −3.44 eV compared to the non-fluorinated P1-3 (−3.35 eV). Furthermore, the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the model compound suggested that hydrogen bonds existed in the FDTE unit. This result implied that the F atom substitution endows the resulting copolymers with intermolecular non-covalent interactions, which could lead to a more planar conjugated backbone conformation. Therefore, P1-4 showed improved ambipolar charge transport properties with the hole mobility up to 4.24 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, an electron mobility of 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was also obtained when the PTFTs were operated under VG from 0 to 100 V. In order to further improve the n-type charge transport properties, Geng et al. reported an (E)-1,2-bis(3,4-difluorothien-2-yl)ethene (4FTVT)-based polymer (P1-5) by increasing the number of F atoms (Table 1).74 Notably, it was found that the reactivity of 4FTVT for direct arylation polycondensation was remarkably high in toluene. DFT calculations indicated that the incorporation of more F atoms in P1-5 would not cause an increase in the dihedral angle of the polymer backbones compared to the non-fluorinated counterpart P1-3. The dihedral angle (θ) between the fluorinated thiophene and neighboring thiophene was nearly 0° due to the intramolecular F⋯S noncovalent interactions according to the DFT molecular geometry optimization results. In both the solution and film states, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption band of P1-5 significantly red-shifted as compared to that of P1-3. The ICT band featured the structured vibrational absorption peaks, indicating that P1-5 had an improved planarity due to the presence of F⋯S noncovalent interactions. Furthermore, P1-5 showed a LUMO energy level of −3.50 eV, which was 0.15 and 0.06 eV deeper than those of P1-3 and P1-4, respectively. All these results supported the higher electron affinity of P1-5. As a result, P1-5 showed ambipolar transistor performances with the dramatically enhanced electron mobility of 5.86 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Besides DPP, isoindigo (IID) has been recognized as another ideal acceptor building block for the PTFTs.75–78 To achieve ambipolar or pure n-type semiconducting polymers based on the IID unit, electron-withdrawing groups should be introduced to further modify the IID unit. Particularly, Pei and co-workers found that introducing two fluorine (F) atoms into the IID core could lower the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and promote the polymer self-organization packing ability, producing P1-6 with promising ambipolar charge transport properties with the μh/μe up to 1.85/0.43 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions (Table 1).79 However, the mobilities are still lower than those of the DPP-based polymers. This might be due to the lower co-planarity of IID-based polymers, which originates from the connection of the benzene ring (IID) and thiophene derivatives. Recently, Geng et al. demonstrated a new strategy, so-called “multifluorination”, which is to introduce F atoms onto both the D and A units.80 Compared with the fluorination either on the D or A unit, “multifluorination” on both the D and A units can not only further lower the frontier orbital energy levels of the IID-based polymers, but also enhance the planarity of their conjugated polymer backbones. Consequently, P1-8 with F atoms on both the IID and TVT units showed an enhanced μe up to 3.50 cm2 V−1 s−1, while its counterpart P1-7 with fluorination only on the IID unit showed a lower μe of 2.77 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, replacing the 4FTVT of P1-8 with 3,3′,4,4′-tetrafluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (4F2T) could produce P1-9 with unipolar n-type charge transport properties (μe = 1.35 cm2 V−1 s−1) measured under ambient conditions.
Besides DPP and IID, the fluorinated benzothiadiazole (BT) and its derivatives represented another important class of acceptor units for the ambipolar/unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers. For instance, by copolymerizing DPP and the fluorinated-BT units, Yang et al. developed two new ambipolar semiconducting polymers (P1-11 and P1-12, Table 1). These polymers were used to investigate the influence of the F atoms on the electron-transport characteristics of the PTFTs.81 Although the fluorinated polymers (P1-11 and P1-12) showed optical properties similar to the non-fluorinated analogue P1-10, a noticeable change in the energy levels was observed by increasing the number of F atoms on the BT unit. Thus, P1-12 demonstrated the deepest HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.48 and −4.22 eV, respectively, due to the introduction of two F atoms. However, the mono-fluorinated polymer P1-11 showed better electron transport properties with the maximum electron mobility of 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1, while its difluorinated counterpart P1-12 exhibited a lower electron mobility of 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1. The authors claimed that this result is attributed to the denser molecular packing and much larger grain size of the thin films of P1-11. In other words, the charge transport properties of the fluorinated polymers are significantly affected by the morphological features besides the energy levels. Thin films with larger grain sizes and nano-fiber-like surface morphologies often showed higher charge transport properties because these morphological features indicated higher crystallinity or better ordering of the polymers.
In addition to the DPP, IID, and BT units, naphthalene diimide (NDI) is a potent acceptor building block. The milestone polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) or P1-13 (Table 1) is a high-performance electron-deficient polymer used for n-channel PTFTs82–84 and all-PSCs.85–93 Further fluorination of the P(NDI2OD-T2) led to a dramatic enhancement of the PCE of the all-PSCs. For example, Jung et al. first reported the fluorination effect of the NDI-based polymer by synthesizing P(NDI2OD-FT2) or P1-14 (Table 1).94 The authors found that fluorination could dramatically increase the fill factor (FF) from 0.56 to 0.63 and realize balanced charge mobilities in the blend with the famous donor polymer PTB7-Th (see Fig. 2f). The PCE of the all-PSC based on P1-14 achieved the high value of 6.29%, while its nonfluorinated counterpart P1-13 showed the lower PCE of 5.28%. Further GIWAXS studies demonstrated that fluorination could result in improved molecular ordering and more face-on oriented crystallites, suppressing bimolecular recombination. When P1-14 was blended with another donor polymer PBDTTTPD (see Fig. 2f), the PCE was still as high as 6%.95 The authors claimed that fluorination enables more efficient charge generation, leading to longer-lived polarons and faster hole transfer due to the improved HOMO/HOMO energy offsets (Fig. 2d and e). This may originate from a favorable film morphology as shown in Fig. 2a–c. While the non-fluorinated polymer (P1-13) blend showed a well-defined phase-separation with larger aggregates (Fig. 2a), the fluorinated polymer (P1-14) blend demonstrated a smoother surface with significantly reduced domain sizes (Fig. 2b and c). Very recently, McNeill et al. also reported the effect of fluorination on the all-PSC performance of NDI-based polymer acceptors with the thiophene-flanked phenyl comonomer.96 Copolymers of the phenyl comonomer with either no fluorination (P1-15), bifluorination (P1-16), or tetrafluorination (P1-17) were synthesized, and the all-PSCs were fabricated by blending with the donor polymer PTB7-Th. It was shown that fluorination increased the PCE from 3.1 (nonfluorinated P1-15) to 4.6% (tetrafluorinated P1-17) mainly due to the dramatic increase in the short-circuit current from 7.7 to 11.7 mA cm−2 as well as an increase in the FF from 0.45 to 0.53. The origin of the improved performances by fluorination is not the ultrafast charge generation kinetics, but instead the improvement of charge generation followed by the charge-collection yield.

Very recently, Wang et al. reported a new fluorinated benzobisthiadiazole (BBT)-based semiconducting polymer, namely, P1-19.97 Although the non-fluorinated counter polymer P1-18 showed a p-type charge transport property in the PTFT, the fluorinated P1-19 displayed a unipolar n-type PTFT behavior due to its deep HOMO (−5.64 eV) and LUMO (−3.87 eV) levels. The latter efficiently blocked the hole injection from the Au electrode and facilitated the electron transport in the PTFT channels, thus leading to the inversion of the charge carrier polarity from p-type to n-type.
2.2 Sp2-nitrogen substitution
Compared to the extensive efforts of the F substitution, the electron-deficient sp2-N approach has been somewhat overlooked. The replacement of benzene rings with pyridine derivatives, the substitution of thiophene rings with thiazole derivatives, or the incorporation of diazole units into a fused ring structure cannot only lower the energy levels, but also improve the planarity of the polymer backbones due to the less steric demand of the sp2-N than the counter C–H moieties.98
The bithiazole unit is regarded as a promising acceptor building block potentially beneficial for the electron transport in PTFTs due to its electron deficiency and trans-planar conformation. Reichmanis et al. reported a facile synthetic strategy (one step) to give 2,2′-bithiazole and copolymerized its structure with the DPP unit to afford poly(dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole-bithiazole), P2-2 (Table 2).99 It was found that the P2-2-based thin-film PTFTs exhibited an electron mobility of 0.2–0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the Ion/Ioff of 1 × 105, while its isoelectronic semiconducting polymer P2-1 composed of an electron-rich bithiophene unit merely displayed hole-transport characteristics.100 However, in this case, the authors used the unusual calcium (work function = 2.9 eV) and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) doped silver (work function = 3.7 eV) as the source and drain electrodes in the PTFT devices, respectively, to suppress the hole transport. When Au was used as the source and drain electrodes in a bottom gate/bottom contact (BG/BC) type PTFT, P2-2 exhibited a slight hole mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the work function of Au close to the HOMO of P2-2. Therefore, to realize unipolar n-type electron-transporting properties, Reichmanis et al. copolymerized the bithiazole unit with dithiazolediketopyrrolopyrrole (DTzDPP) to afford a unipolar all-acceptor type polymer P2-3 (Table 2).101P2-3 displayed a ca. 0.2 eV deeper LUMO level under identical measurement conditions compared to P2-2, indicating a greater and more stable electron transport for the thiazole analogue than the thiophene. The BG/BC PTFTs with Au as the source and drain electrodes showed a unipolar electron mobility of 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1.

To date, most of the high-mobility DPP-based semiconducting polymers contain monomer structures based on a DPP core flanked with five-membered rings, such as thiophene, furan, and selenophene, on both sides.102–104 The five-membered rings have minimal steric effects on the DPP core and thus result in highly-planar DPP-based units. However, these five-membered rings have six π-electrons, resulting in electron-rich aromaticity, and offset the electron-withdrawing nature of the DPP core. To further improve the electron-affinity and lower the LUMO level of the DPP-based semiconducting polymers, Li et al. synthesized P2-4 (Table 2) composed of a more electron-deficient six-membered pyridine ring (PyDPP). The pyridine ring of the PyDPP moiety efficiently alleviated the steric incumbency of the counter benzene ring and deepened the LUMO level to −4.33 eV.105 As a result, the PTFTs based on P2-4 showed ambipolar charge transport properties with the unprecedented high electron mobility of 6.30 cm2 V−1 s−1. Subsequently, Thelakkat et al. also used the PyDPP building block to copolymerize with a thiophene or fluorinated thiophene moiety, producing two promising electron-deficient polymers, P2-5 and P2-6.48 It was found that P2-5 shows a unipolar electron mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, while P2-6 has an electron mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 without thermal annealing optimization. Interestingly, thermal annealing dramatically improved the device performance of P2-5 with the unipolar electron mobility up to 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the P2-6-based device showed a similar mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1.

DPP-based monomer repeat units bearing fused heterocycles, such as thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, have previously demonstrated impressive device performances as p-type semiconducting polymers in both PTFTs and PSCs.106 The fused heterocycle substituent with increased intermolecular interactions through an extended polymer coplanarity was shown to enhance the intermolecular charge-carrier hopping. Therefore, there is a recent trend directed towards the design of n-type semiconducting polymers based on the DPP core with a π-extended electron-deficient flanking unit. For example, Hu et al. reported the design and synthesis of a π-extended quinoline-flanked DPP (abbreviated QDPP) motif and the corresponding copolymer P2-7 (Table 2).107 Compared to the pyridine flanked DPP (PyDPP)-based polymer P2-6, P2-7 demonstrated a wide bandgap and potent electron deficiency. Furthermore, P2-6 tended to form a face-on orientation on the SiO2 substrate, while P2-7 adopted a more edge-on orientation, which is more favorable for the charge transport in the in-plane direction of the PTFTs. As a consequence, PTFTs based on P2-7 showed a siginificantly enhanced electron mobility of 6.04 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Besides the electron-deficient π-extended quinoline-flanked DPP, Chen et al. designed and synthesized a thieno[2,3-b]pyridine flanked DPP monomer (TPDPP) and successfully incorporated it into the polymer P2-8.108 The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-flanked DPP unit has less steric effects than the PyDPP and QDPP units as the five-membered ring of the thiophene moiety does not possess alpha C–H bonds, which cause torsional twisting and increase the dihedral angle between the linked units. As shown in Fig. 3, DFT calculation results demonstrated that P2-8 exhibits very small dihedral angles between the DPP unit and adjacent substituents (thieno[2,3-b]pyridine). This is attributed to the effective suppression of the steric hindrance from the 2-pyridinyl groups. Furthermore, one can also observe the absence of a noticeable steric hindrance between the TPDPP and 3,4-difluorothiophene monomer units (Fig. 3). As a result, a good electron mobility was expected from this highly-planar polymer backbone. Bottom-contact, top-gate PTFTs based on P2-8 were fabricated and a maximum electron mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. Promisingly, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.72% with a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V was achieved when P2-8 was applied to the all-PSCs using PTB7-Th as the polymer donor material.

Wang and Michinobu et al. introduced sp2-N atoms into the TVT unit, producing VTz. Both units were the key monomers of P2-9 and P2-10.109P2-10 showed deeper HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.21/−3.72 eV, respectively, than the TVT-based counterpart P2-9. Bottom-gate top-contact (BG/TC) PTFTs based on P2-10 showed electron-dominated ambipolar performances with a μh/μe of 0.027/0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, while its TVT counterpart polymer P2-9 displayed a unipolar p-type performance with the lower hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1. Besides the energy levels, this result might be due to the polymer packing orientations. The VTz-based polymer, P2-10, showed an edge-on orientation, while the TVT-based polymer, P2-9, had a face-on orientation, revealed by the GIWAXS measurements.
Wang and Michinobu et al. also studied the effect of sp2-N on the PTFT performances using the thiazole spacer in the polymer backbone as shown in P2-11 and P2-12 (Table 2).110 Replacing the thiophene unit with the thiazole unit deepened both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, resulting in their different ambipolar charge transport properties. While p-type dominant PTFT performances with the hole mobility reaching 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed for P2-11, the device based on the sp2-N substituted P2-12 displayed a more evenly balanced μh/μe of 0.45 along with a significantly enhanced μe of ∼0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introducing two sp2-N atoms into the IID unit can improve the electron transport properties. For instance, Yu et al. did computational screening to estimate the effect of introducing sp2-N atoms into the IID-based polymers. A torsion angle of ca. 20–40°, attributed to C–H⋯H–C steric interactions, generally occurs between the benzene and neighboring aromatic rings. Theoretical simulations suggested that the incorporation of a nitrogen atom not only increases the electron-affinity, but also eliminates the undesirable dihedral angles between the comonomers. As a result, the authors synthesized a new 7,7′-diazaisoindigo (7DNIID)-based polymer P2-13.111 Indeed, P2-13 exhibited a very planar backbone, extensive π-conjugation and high crystallinity with ambipolar hole mobilities of 2.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities reaching 0.78 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the top-gate/bottom-contact (TG/BC) configuration tested in air. Subsequently, Wan et al. further copolymerized 7,7′-diazaisoindigo with selenophene or BT to achieve copolymers P2-14 and P2-15, respectively.112 While P2-14 predominantly adopted a face-on packing orientation and exhibited an ambipolar charge transport behavior with the electron mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, P2-15 with another electron-deficient BT moiety adopted edge-on packing textures and exhibited the higher electron mobility of 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Later on, Pei et al. found that 5,5′-diazaisoindigo (5DNIID) is more electron-deficient than 7,7′-diazaisoindigo (7DNIID), because a very low LUMO level of −3.92 eV was determined from cyclic voltammetry.113 Moreover, compared to 7DNIID, the two sp2-N atoms in 5DNIID would not be occluded after introducing alkyl side chains, which is beneficial for the formation of intermolecular N⋯H hydrogen bonds and N⋯S interactions, leading to an ordered molecular arrangement. By using this newly developed 5DNIID building block, P2-16 was synthesized through copolymerizing with the bithiophene unit. Unfortunately, PTFTs based on P2-16 exhibited a typical p-type behavior with the mobility of 0.00127 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much lower than that of the classic IID- and 7DNIID-based polymers. The authors claimed that this unexpected result might be due to the lower crystallinity of P2-16, as a very weak 100 diffraction was found in the XRD measurement.
Recently, the benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (BDOPV), which has four electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups on the backbone and a low LUMO level of −4.24 eV, was developed as an excellent electron-accepting moiety for high-performance PTFTs with the electron mobilities of 1.74 cm2 V−1 s−1.114–116 To further improve the electron transport property of the BDOPV-based polymers, Pei et al. embedded sp2-N atoms into BDOPV, resulting in a stronger electron-deficient building block, diaza-BDOPV (AzaBDOPV) (Table 2).117 By copolymerizing with the bithiophene unit, P2-17 was synthesized. Compared to the original polymer without sp2-N atoms, P2-17 showed a more planar backbone and a lower LUMO level of −4.37 eV. As a consequence, the PTFTs based on P2-17 demonstrated higher electron mobilities of 3.22 cm2 V−1 s−1 tested under ambient conditions. Subsequently, Yu et al. copolymerized AzaBDOPV with electron-deficient comonomers, such as BT and fluorinated BT, to produce two promising n-type polymers, P2-18 and P2-19.118 They fabricated flexible PTFTs with the TG/BC configuration to evaluate the charge carrier transport properties of the two copolymers. The semiconducting layer was spin-coated on PET substrates patterned with Au electrodes. Well-balanced hole/electron mobilities up to 4.68/4.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved in the P2-18-based device, whereas P2-19 exhibited lower but electron dominant ambipolar properties with hole/electron mobilities of 0.19/2.75 cm2 V−1 s−1. The lower hole mobility of P2-19 could be attributed to its low-lying HOMO energy level (0.15 eV deeper than that of P32), which limited hole injection from the Au electrode to the semiconducting thin film.
2.3 Cyano (CN) group substitution
Besides the fluorine and sp2-N atoms, the cyano or nitrile (CN) group is also a strong electron-withdrawing group. The cyano group can effectively reduce the electron density in the aromatic or heterocyclic cores and lower the frontier energy levels by pulling electrons out of the π-conjugated backbone. Although several CN-containing semiconducting polymers have been used as electron transport materials in OLEDs, they are rarely used in n-type PTFTS and all-PSCs.119,120 It should be noted that the incorporation of the relatively large cyano group in aromatic cores can distort the planarity of the conjugated backbone and hinder the close packing between the conjugated polymer backbones.121 Therefore, to minimize the steric hindrance effect, the substitution position of cyano groups should be carefully considered.
Li et al. reported copolymers, P3-1 and P3-2, which are composed of the DPP unit and cyano-substituted thiophene or benzene as the comonomer (Table 3).122 It was found that the incorporation of two cyano groups into the polymer backbone could lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels by about 0.3 and 0.2 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of the cyano group might be beneficial to enhance intermolecular interactions by forming adjacent intermolecular hydrogen bonds. PTFTs with the BG/TC device structure were fabricated and tested under ambient conditions. P3-1 displayed well-defined electron-dominant ambipolar charge-carrier transport characteristics with the electron/hole mobilities of 0.09/0.0017 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, the as-cast thin films of P3-2 exhibited hole-dominant ambipolar charge transport properties. Interestingly, after thermal annealing, PTFTs based on P3-2 displayed electron-dominant ambipolar charge-transport properties. The highest electron mobility reached 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing at 240 °C. Compared to the corresponding non-CN counterpart polymers, which simply displayed a hole-dominant ambipolar behavior, a remarkable inversion from a hole- to electron-dominant charge carrier transportation was observed. This inversion was mainly attributed to the introduction of the cyano groups, which significantly lowered the LUMO levels of the polymers. Therefore, the introduction of cyano groups into an aromatic or heterocyclic core of the polymer backbone is an efficient way to obtain high-performance electron-deficient semiconducting polymers.

In addition to the substitution of cyano groups onto an aromatic or heterocyclic core, the cyano group substitution at the vinylene moiety is a simple but effective molecular design strategy for obtaining high-performance ambipolar/n-type semiconducting polymers. For instance, Kwon et al. reported a new electron-deficient building block based on the cyano-substituted vinylene moiety, namely, 2,3-bis[thiophen-2-yl]acrylonitrile (CNTVT).123 They copolymerized CNTVT with the DPP unit to obtain polymer P3-3 (Table 3). The attachment of only one cyano group in every repeat unit of the polymer backbone can effectively attract electrons through the vinyl linkage without sacrificing the extended coplanar structure of the vinyl backbone as well as the resulting crystallinity of the semiconducting polymer films. As a result, P3-3 demonstated a very high electron mobility of 7.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ambipolar) using the TG/BC PTFTs.
Subsequently, Yu et al. also used CNTVT to copolymerize with the thiazole-flanked DPP.124 Different side chains were attached to tune the interdigitated self-assembly of the synthesized polymers from P3-4 to P3-6.125 The charge transport properties of the polymers were studied in the TG/BC PTFT devices. The highest hole and electron mobilities of P3-4 were 0.772 and 0.494 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Through side-chain engineering, the hole and electron mobilities of P3-5 were improved to 1.46 and 1.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, P3-6 showed the lowest hole and electron mobilities of 0.489 and 0.202 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Later, GIWAXS experiments indicated that the higher PTFT performances of P3-5 might be due to its edge-on packing orientation with the closest π–π stacking distance, promoting the efficient charge carrier transport.
Kim et al. also used CNTVT to copolymerize with IID to synthesize a new electron-deficient polymer P3-7.126 To realize high electron mobilities for the IID-based conjugated polymer, an electron-withdrawing cyano group was incorporated into the vinylene unit, thereby shifting the LUMO energy level for efficient electron-injection from the Au electrodes without disrupting the backbone planarity. In order to further improve the device performances, the authors employed an off-centered spin-coating technique from pre-aggregated solutions with a binary solvent system (a mixture of good and poor solvents). TG/BC PTFTs based on P3-7 exhibited a higher electron mobility of 1.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 than its non-CN counter polymer, which only showed unipolar p-type performances.
Subsequently, Zhang et al. synthesized another new CNTVT-based polymer P3-8.127 Interestingly, P3-8 showed broadened and red-shifted absorption spectra in the solid state compared to that in solutions, suggesting that the planarity of the conjugated backbones was enhanced in the solid state. By using the TG/BC configuration, it was found that the PTFT based on P3-8 exhibited promising and air-stable ambipolar charge transport characteristics with the optimized hole and electron mobilities of 0.0064 and 0.048 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Kim et al. also synthesized CNTVT-NDI copolymers with different alkyl chains attached to the NDI moiety, namely, PNDITCVT-OD (also called P3-8 in Table 3) and PNDITCVT-HD (also called P3-9 in Table 3).128P3-8 and P3-9 possessed almost the same HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The authors fabricated all-PSCs by blending P3-8 and P3-9 with a donor polymer PBDTTTPD. Interestingly, unlike the all-PSCs with typical NDI-based polymer acceptors that generally exhibit FF values lower than 0.55, the devices based on P3-8 and P3-9 showed remarkably high FFs of over 0.65 without using an interlayer modification.129 Density functional theory calculations revealed an increase in the dipole moment change (Δμge) and delocalization of the LUMO upon the incorporation of the cyano-substituted vinylene groups. These changes lead to the high FF of 65% and PCE up to 7.4%. GIWAXS studies indicated that the face-on/face-on alignment between PBDTTTPD and P3-8 (or P3-9) in the blend was anticipated to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination at the donor/acceptor interfaces (Fig. 4). In particular, the P3-9 blend film showed a stronger (010) scattering peak at qz = 1.70 Å−1 with the slightly tighter π–π stacking distance of 3.70 Å than that of P3-8, thus leading to the higher electron mobility, Jsc, and PCE values.

Controlling the polarity (p-type and n-type) of charge carrier transporting polymers is a challenging but essential task for the deep understanding of the intrinsic charge transport behavior. Until now, many ambipolar semiconducting polymers have been synthesized by trial and error experiments. Recently, Kim et al. proposed a facile route for the synthesis of P3-10 to tune the charge polarity by precisely controlling the copolymerization ratio between the electron-deficient (referred as a CNTVT unit) and electron-donating units (referred as SVS).130 By varying the monomer ratio of CNTVT (n-type):SVS (p-type) from 1:9 to 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1, the polarity of the charge carrier transport was gradually converted from hole to electron, and the maximum electron mobility achieved was as high as 6.88 ± 1.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the CNTVT:SVS ratio (9:1) in the TG/BC PTFTs. In addition, the well-balanced μh/μe ratio of 3.15/3.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved when the CNTVT:SVS ratio was 5:5.
Hwang et al. reported a new TVT derivative, namely, (E)-1,2-di-(3-cyanothiophen-2-yl)ethene (2CNTVT), in which the 3- and 3′-positions of TVT were substituted by cyano groups.131 By copolymerizing 2CNTVT with the DPP unit, a new n-type polymer P3-11 was produced. While P3-11 and its non-CN counter polymer showed similar optical bandgaps, P3-11 had significantly deeper HOMO/LUMO energy levels (0.35 eV deeper than its non-CN counter polymer) because of the powerful electron-withdrawing cyano group. The fabricated PTFTs based on P3-11 displayed a high electron mobility, while its non-CN polymer exhibited only unipolar p-type charge transport properties. However, the air stability of the P3-11 devices was still poor. Compared to its p-type non-CN counterpart, the electron transport degradation was much faster. The poor air stability of n-channel PTFTs, e.g., P3-11, was likely due to the generation of trap sites by the reaction with hydrogenated oxygen. This result implies that the 2CNTVT-based polymers would show a better electron injection property from the Au electrode compared to the TVT-based polymers because of their low-lying LUMOs.
In the previous examples, the CN groups were introduced into the donor building blocks. However, it was also possible to substitute them on the acceptor units. For example, a series of cyano-substituted NDI derivatives, reported by the Chi group, revealed a stepwise decrease in the LUMO levels as more cyano groups were introduced into the NDI core.132 The dicyano NDI analogue (2CN2Br-NDI) demonstrated its lowest LUMO level of −4.42 eV, and accordingly, air-stable electron-transporting features with the electron mobility up to 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved. Subsequently, Wang et al. for the first time introduced the dicyano NDI subunit (2CN-NDI) into the polymer backbone by copolymerizing with various donor moieties.133 The resulting 2CN-NDI-based copolymer, P3-12, exhibited an excellent thermal stability and solubility in common organic solvents due to the presence of branched alkyl chains. Besides, it was found that P3-12 possesses a significantly lower LUMO level of about −4.4 eV due to the electron-deficient dicyano NDI unit. Unfortunately, the BG/TC PTFTs based on P3-12 only showed very low electron mobilities of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which might be due to the distorted polymer backbone.
Cyano groups can also be attached to the BT unit to develop unipolar n-type polymers. For instance, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTDCNBT, Table 3) was developed by Heeney and his coworkers.134 In order to investigate the potential of this new acceptor unit in semiconducting polymers, alkylated indacenodithiophene (IDT) and dithienogermole (DTG) derivatives were copolymerized with DTDCNBT, producing P3-14 and P3-16, respectively (Table 3). To fairly compare the properties of the new cyano-containing electron-deficient semiconducting polymers, the fluorinated BT based counter polymers (P3-13 and P3-15) were also synthesized. As a consequence, the CN-BT unit was found to be a much stronger electron acceptor than the BT and F-BT units due to the increase in the electron affinity by approximately 0.4 eV. The charge mobilities of these polymers were evaluated in PTFT devices. It was found that replacing the fluorine substituents with the cyano groups led to a dramatic change in the charge transporting characteristics from p-type to n-type in the PTFTs listed in Table 3. It is remarkable that switching the type of the charge transport could be achieved through a subtle change in the substituents.
3. Polymer backbone modifications
3.1 D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy
Most of the previously mentioned high-performance electron-deficient semiconducting polymers are based on D–A alternating structures. As a matter of fact, most D–A polymers, composed of one electron-deficient unit coupled with an electron-rich moiety, such as thiophene, bithiophene, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, tend to exhibit p-type dominant ambipolar or rather unipolar p-type charge transport properties.135–141 This is mainly because the electron-rich units tend to lower the electron affinity and ionization potential of the resulting polymers. As a consequence, it would impair the efficient electron transport and oxidation resistance.
Alternatively, the acceptor–acceptor combination, namely, D(π)–A1–D(π)–A2, has been regarded as a new design strategy to obtain electron-dominant ambipolar or even unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers.142 For example, Wang and Michinobu et al. adopted the D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy instead of the conventional D–A structure in the polymer repeat unit to achieve unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers based on the BBT and its heteroatom-substituted derivative, SN (P4-1 and P4-3, Table 4).143 The NDI unit was selected as the comonomer due to its excellent electron-accepting properties with deep HOMO and LUMO levels.144–146 Furthermore, the BBT and SN units were subjected to selenium (Se)-substitution, thus leading to two new Se-containing electron-deficient semiconducting polymers (P4-2 and P4-4). Going a step further, the selenium-substitution effects on the optical, electrochemical, molecular packing, and electron-transporting properties of the n-type semiconducting polymers were determined. It was found that the selenium-containing polymers (P4-2 and P4-4) possess narrower bandgaps and deeper LUMO levels than the corresponding counter polymers (P4-1 and P4-3, respectively). Notably, the LUMO of D–A1–D–A2 polymers could be finely tuned by adjusting the electron affinity (i.e., selenium substitution) of one acceptor unit. Based on the GIWAXS patterns, the selenium-containing polymers showed shorter lamellar packing distances due to the stronger Se–Se interactions. For example, P4-2 exhibited a higher crystallinity and stronger tendency toward an edge-on orientation, thus leading to a four times higher electron mobility than its sulfur counterpart (P4-1). Thanks to the D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy, this is the first report that BBT-based semiconducting polymers could achieve unipolar n-channel transistor performances with the electron mobility over 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Subsequently, Wang and Michinobu et al. reported a series of copolymers composed of NDI and BT derivatives based on the regioregular D–A1–D–A2 polymer backbone design strategy (P4-5, P4-6, P4-7, and P4-8, Table 4).147 Furthermore, the effect of different N-substituted positions on the PTFT performances was studied. It should be noted that high-quality semiconducting polymers were obtained through a modified Stille polymerization approach using palladium(0)/Cu(I) as the catalysts. After the introduction of sp2-N atoms, both P4-6 and P4-7 showed lower LUMO energy levels than that of the non-sp2-N based counter polymer P4-5. P4-5 showed a moderate ambipolar μh/μe of 0.19/0.92 cm2 V−1 s−1. In comparison, P4-6, in which the flanked thiophenes of P4-5 were replaced by thiazoles, showed unipolar electron transporting properties with a μe of 0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1. Introducing the sp2-N atom into the electron-accepting BT unit produced P4-7, which showed an even higher electron mobility of over 2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, P4-8 with two sp2-N atoms embedded into a triple-fused-ring structure of a BBT derivative displayed the highest μe of 4.87 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, a weak p-type performance with a μh of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed, which might be due to the relatively high HOMO energy level (−5.45 eV) of P4-8. Therefore, the Si/SiO2 substrate was modified with an amine-tailed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to suppress the hole transport. As a result, the PTFT based on P4-8 showed a unipolar μe of up to 5.35 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a lower threshold voltage of 1 V and higher Ion/Ioff ratio of 107. The remarkable electron mobility of P4-8 was due to its higher crystalline microstructure with a bimodal (edge-on and face-on) orientation and a shorter π–π stacking distance. This study again demonstrated that D–A1–D–A2 is a promising strategy for high-performance n-type semiconducting polymers.
In addition to the NDI-based copolymers, perylenediimide (PDI)-based polymers have been considered to be another class of promising electron-transporting materials because of their good electron mobilities and ease of chemical modification.148,149 Previously, the PDI derivatives were copolymerized with various donors, such as thiophene, bithiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, selenophene, benzo[1,2-c;3,4-c′]dithiophene and indacenodithiophene, to afford D–A polymers.150–154 Because of the larger and more twisted polymer backbones than the corresponding NDI-polymers, PDI-based polymers tended to adopt face-on packing textures, which is more favorable for organic solar cell applications. As a consequence, the all-PSCs based on these D–A type PDI-polymer acceptors demonstrated the PCEs of 1–6%.150–154 In order to achieve better photovoltaic performances, PDI-polymers with higher electron affinities must be developed. Therefore, the D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy was employed. For example, Zhang et al. reported a new n-type polymer P4-10 using a combination of the PDI and DPP moieties (Table 4).155 To fairly compare its property, the NDI-based counter polymer P4-9 was also synthesized. The all-PSCs were fabricated with the conventional configuration by blending with narrow bandgap donor polymers, such as PTB7-Th. The results demonstrated that the all-PSCs based on P4-10 show a PCE of 2.01% with the Voc of 0.68 V, Jsc of 7.06 mA cm−2 and FF of 41.78%. On the other hand, its NDI-based counter polymer P4-9 showed a much lower PCE of 0.30%. The authors claimed that the better performance based on P4-10 might be due to its suitable energy levels, relatively high electron mobility and preferable micro-phase separation. On the other hand, the poor performance of the devices based on P4-9 may be mainly caused by the small difference in the HOMO energy levels between the donor polymer and P4-9. As a result, it was shown that the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers must be carefully regulated by selecting suitable acceptor units in the D–A1–D–A2 backbone in order to obtain a high efficiency of the all-PSCs. Most importantly, it was implied that very narrow bandgap polymers are suitable as acceptor materials in the all-PSCs because of their shallow HOMOs. Based on this knowledge and in order to further develop high-performance all-PSCs, Zhou et al. introduced the electron-deficient 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) unit, instead of DPP, because of its deeper HOMO level (Table 4).156 As a result, a new D–A1–D–A2 type electron-deficient polymer P4-11 was obtained. More promisingly, the authors replaced the PDI with a fused PDI moiety (FPDI) to synthesize a new D–A1–D–A2 type electron-deficient polymer P4-12 (Table 4).156 The optical, electrochemical, density functional theory (DFT) and photovoltaic properties of both polymers and their blended films were systematically investigated. Based on the electrochemical measurements, the LUMO levels of P4-11 and P4-12 were deeper by ca. 0.27 and 0.44 eV than that of PTB7-Th, respectively, while the differences in the HOMO energy levels between PTB7-Th and the polymer acceptors, P4-11 and P4-12, were ca. 0.26 and 0.55 eV, respectively. These energy level differences ensure an efficient exciton dissociation. The all-PSCs based on P4-11 as the acceptor exhibited a promising PCE of up to 4.07%. More promisingly, the P4-12-based all-PSCs displayed a significantly enhanced PCE of up to 6.23%, which is the best photovoltaic performance for the all-PSCs based on the D–A1–D–A2 type polymer acceptors. The authors insisted that the observed lower Jsc value in the PTB7-Th:P4-11 device than that of the PTB7-Th:P4-12 device is partly due to the smaller energy level differences (0.26 eV for HOMOs and 0.27 eV for LUMOs) between PTB7-Th and P4-11, which may affect the efficiency of the exciton separation, thereby resulting in a lower current density.
Other than the NDI and PDI units, azulene was recently reported to be another promising candidate for constructing n-type optoelectronic materials.157–159 To develop azulene-based n-type copolymers, Gao et al. synthesized two new azulene-containing D–A1–D–A2 type conjugated copolymers, P4-13 and P4-14 (Table 4), and they were used in high-performance n-type PTFTs and all-PSCs.160 New azulene derivative-based acceptors, namely, the 2,2′-biazulene-1,1′,3,3′-tetracarboxylic diimides (BAzDIs), were synthesized and copolymerized with TPD and tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) to give P4-13 and P4-14, respectively. The DFT calculations revealed that the electron density distribution of both the HOMO and LUMO was well delocalized over the BAzDI and TPD (or TFB) moieties, indicating that the LUMO levels of D–A1–D–A2 are determined by both acceptor units. Moreover, the calculated frontier orbitals are beneficial for the efficient electron transport. As a result, the PTFTs based on P4-13 and P4-14 exhibited promising electron mobilities of 0.42 and 0.24 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, 2D-GIWAXS indicated that P4-13 has a lower crystallinity than P4-14 (Fig. 5). The authors explained this contradiction from the different molecular weights (Mn); the lower mobility of P4-14 might have originated from its much lower molecular weight (Mn). Furthermore, the differences in both the HOMO and LUMO levels between these two polymers and PTB7-Th were greater than 0.3 eV, which enables the efficient exciton dissociation. Accordingly, the all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th and P4-13 were fabricated and a preliminary PCE of 1.82% was obtained. This result suggests a significant potential as an acceptor of the all-PSCs.

Overall, these studies demonstrated that the D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy is an efficient way of achieving high-performance n-type semiconducting polymers in n-channel PTFTs and all-PSCs.
3.2 Acceptor dimerization
A new design concept to create ambipolar or n-type polymers (Table 5) is the so-called “acceptor dimerization”, first proposed by Liu et al.161–165 This strategy has several unique advantages: (1) acceptor dimerization can lower both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels; (2) unlike EWG substitution, in which a tedious organic synthetic process might be needed, acceptor–acceptor dimers can be obtained by a general homo-coupling reaction. For example, Liu et al. developed a novel bis-diketopyrrolopyrrole (2DPP) acceptor based on the “acceptor dimerization” strategy (Table 5).161 A series of 2DPP-based copolymers (P5-1 to P5-4) with the common thiophene and its derivatives in the main chain were synthesized.161 DFT calculations suggested that 2DPP is a stronger electron-deficient building unit than its DPP-counterpart. Thus, the LUMO energy levels of the 2DPP-polymers were noticeably lowered by ∼0.1 eV compared to those of the corresponding DPP-polymers. All the 2DPP-polymers showed good ambipolar PTFT performances. In particular, P5-2 exhibited a balanced ambipolar performance with the μe of up to 3.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, its counter DPP-polymer showed a hole-dominant transport behavior with a negligible μes. The results demonstrated that the “acceptor dimerization” strategy is a promising approach to improve the electron mobilities in the PTFTs. Subsequently, Liu et al. reported two new polymers, P5-5 and P5-6, by copolymerizing 2DPP with BT or its fluorinated derivative, respectively.162 Both polymers exhibited narrow bandgaps and deep LUMO energy levels of −4.2 to −4.3 eV due to the combination of the strong electron-withdrawing 2DPP and BT units. These polymers were further applied to flexible PTFTs using poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as a substrate. Since both P5-5 and P5-6 possessed a glass transition temperature of 150 °C, annealing at 160 °C promoted the crystallization and led to their excellent ambipolar PTFT characteristics. In particular, P5-5 exhibited a small π–π stacking distance of 3.59 Å and a smooth interface, which were attributable to its high-performance ambipolar properties with the μe of up to 2.58 cm2 V−1 s−1. Unfortunately, the fluorinated polymer P5-6 showed the lower μh/μe of 0.36/0.68 cm2 V−1 s−1. The different mobilities between these two polymers were elucidated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Because of the nature of the TG/BC type PTFTs, the morphology of the top of the polymer films, which directly contacts with the dielectric, is much more important for the carrier transport.163 The AFM images of the films showed that the interface of the P5-5 film (RMS = 0.21 nm) was much smoother compared to that of the P5-6-counterpart. In top-gated PTFTs, smoother interfaces lead to fewer traps for intermolecular charge transport thus resulting in higher mobilities. Very recently, Liu et al. further used the 2DPP unit to copolymerize with the BT unit to afford P5-7.166 DFT calculations of P5-7 showed a very good backbone planarity and strong electron deficiency. Moreover, the introduced BT acceptor could further strengthen the electron affinity of the polymer, thus facilitating the efficient electron injection and transport. As a result, P5-7 exhibited typical ambipolar charge transport characteristics with the high and balanced hole and electron mobilities of up to 3.01 and 3.84 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These mobilities are higher than those of P5-5 and P5-6. Overall, the results demonstrated that the 2DPP acceptor designed according to the “acceptor dimerization” strategy is a promising building block for high-performing electron-deficient semiconducting polymers.

A new regioregular bis-pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (2PT) acceptor was also recently reported by Liu et al. according to the concept of “acceptor dimerization” (Table 5).165 The combination of this novel acceptor and thiophene–vinylene–thiophene donor afforded the new copolymer P5-8.165 The 2PT unit allowed P5-8 to achieve a high electron affinity and extended π-conjugation. DFT calculations suggested that the polymer backbone containing the 2PT unit has a small dihedral angle (θ) of 25° between the two PT units. In addition, P5-8 showed a suitable LUMO/HOMO energy level of −3.66/−5.61 eV, which enables the injection of both holes and electrons from the Au electrodes to semiconductor layers. As a consequence, PTFTs based on P5-8 exhibited excellent ambipolar performances with an electron mobility of 8.94 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a record high electron mobility value among the ambipolar polymers. This result indicated that “acceptor dimerization” is a powerful strategy for producing high mobility n-type polymers.
Another example is the bithienopyrroledione (2TPD) unit. Li et al. reported two new 2TPD-based polymers (P5-9 and P5-10, Table 5) for the PTFTs.166 Both P5-9 and P5-10 showed low-lying LUMO energy levels of −4.01 and −4.10 eV, respectively, due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the 2TPD. As a result, PTFTs based on both polymers displayed electron-dominant ambipolar charge transport properties. However, P5-9 exhibited a higher μe of 1.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of P5-10 (0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1) despite the shallower LUMO energy level. This was probably due to the different polymer packing structures. P5-9 adopted a bimodal packing texture with both edge-on and face-on orientations, which is favorable for the 3-D charge transport, whereas P5-10 exclusively formed an edge-on orientation.
Guo et al. reported bithiophene imide (BTI)-based acceptor building blocks based on the “acceptor dimerization” concept, namely, the C–C connected BTI dimers (2BTI) and its fused version moiety (f-2BTI, Table 5).167 It was found that the f-2BTI-based polymer P5-12 has a smaller bandgap and a lower LUMO level than the 2BTI-based polymer P5-11. PTFTs based on both P5-11 and P5-12 showed unipolar electron mobilities of 0.82 and 1.13 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When blended with the polymer donor PTB7-Th, the all-PSCs based on P5-12 demonstrated a good PCE of 6.85%. It should be noted that this is the highest value of the all-PSCs using n-type polymers other than the NDI- or PDI-polymer acceptors.168–175 However, the all-PSCs based on P5-11 showed nearly no photovoltaic performances. This difference was probably caused by the different crystallinity and polymer packing orientations.176–179 The GIWAXS patterns revealed that P5-12 exhibits a face-on dominant orientation with the in-plane (IP) diffractions up to the second order and a pronounced (010) peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. In contrast, the pristine P5-11 film shows a preferential edge-on orientation with lamellar scatterings up to (500) in the OOP direction. These different GIWAXS patterns indicated a more compact interchain packing and significantly increased film crystallinity of P5-12 as compared to P5-11. The increased crystallinity with a preferential edge-on orientation of the P5-11 film accounts for its improved electron mobility in the PTFTs. Furthermore, geometry optimization by DFT calculations suggested that P5-12 has a more linear and planar backbone than P5-11, thus leading to a higher structural ordering by stronger interchain interactions (Fig. 6). Very recently, Guo et al. synthesized a new acceptor building block, 2,2′-bithiazolothienyl-4,4′,10,10′-tetracarboxydiimide (DTzTI), which is regarded as the sp2-N atom substituted version of 2BTI in P5-11.180 The X-ray crystal structure analysis and physicochemical study revealed that DTzTI is an excellent building block for constructing electron-deficient polymers.181–187 Instead of the alternating polymers (D–A, A–A or D–A1–D–A2 type), a homopolymer of DTzTI, namely, poly(2,2′-bithiazolothienyl-4,4′,10,10′-tetracarboxydiimide) (P5-13, Table 5), was first synthesized. Very excitingly, the TG/BC type PTFTs based on P5-13 exhibited unipolar n-type electron transport properties with an excellent electron mobility of 1.61 cm2 V−1 s−1, low off-currents (Ioff) of 10−10–10−11 A, and substantial current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff) of 107–108. These results indicated that the all-acceptor homopolymers based on the “acceptor dimerization” concept may have distinctive advantages over conventional n-type D–A type copolymers, which suffer from ambipolar transport with a high Ioffs > 10−8 A and small Ion/Ioffs < 105.188–194 Very recently, Wu et al. reported a new acceptor unit, dithienylbenzenebisimide (BBI), which can be regarded as the “fused dimerization” of two electron-withdrawing imide moieties connected through one benzene ring as the core. Polymer P5-14 composed of the BBI and difluorinated-bithiophene units showed a very planar polymer backbone and highly crystalline thin-film structure with the edge-on orientation. Therefore, promising unipolar n-type charge transport properties with the μe of 0.34 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved.195

4. Conclusions and outlook
During the past several years, the field of semiconducting polymers has seen dramatic progress based on the development of new semiconducting polymers. PTFTs with ultrahigh hole mobilities of more than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PSCs with PCEs approaching 15% have been achieved using the state-of-the-art D–A type, p-type polymers. However, their n-type counterparts lag far behind. To develop more electron-deficient (ambipolar or pure n-type) polymers, two main strategies, i.e., the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs: fluorine, sp2-nitrogen, cyano, etc.) and backbone modification (D–A1–D–A2 strategy and “acceptor dimerization”), have been adopted as introduced in this review. From Tables 1–5, it is shown that “acceptor dimerization” would be the most promising strategy to improve the electron mobilities as demonstrated in the case of P5-8 that has a record-high electron mobility (ambipolar) of ca. 9 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, the EWG substitution (F and CN) of the NDI-based polymers is an effective strategy for developing polymer acceptors used in the all-PSCs as shown in the cases of P2-14 and P3-9, which exhibited promising PCEs exceeding 6%. Although we classified some of the electron-deficient polymers into one specific design strategy, several polymers were indeed designed by considering multiple strategies. For instance, P2-18 and P2-19 employed sp2-N, F-substitution and D–A1–D–A2 backbone modification. In addition, P4-7 and P4-8 used both a sp2-N substitution and D–A1–D–A2 backbone strategy. Moreover, P5-13 employed both sp2-N substitution and “acceptor dimerization”. As a matter of fact, employing multiple strategies seems to be more effective than one single strategy with respect to strengthening the electron affinity of the resulting polymers. Therefore, more promising n-type PTFTs and all-PSCs would be produced in the near future.
Although exciting advances have been achieved in this field, several problems must be solved before commercialization of the PTFTs and all-PSCs. (1) A more efficient synthetic process must be developed, since it is still challenging to achieve the mass production of semiconducting polymers based on the present synthetic protocols, which need multistep organic reactions and tedious column chromatography to purify the compounds at each step; (2) a more sophisticated understanding of the charge transport mechanism must be developed. For instance, several high-performance n-type polymers, such as P5-5 and P5-8, adopted bimodal packing textures or even face-on orientation dominant π–π packing structures, which are not favorable for charge-transport in PTFTs according to the classical charge hoping mechanism; and (3) high durable and flexible devices must be developed, since there is a high demand for achieving not only a high-mobility, but also excellent stability in the n-type polymers that are compatible with their p-type counterparts for a variety of real life applications.
Despite the issues mentioned above, electron-deficient semiconducting polymers have certainly made great contributions to the development of organic electronics. The realization of solution-processable, flexible, stretchable and even bio-degradable polymer electronic devices by the combination of p- and n-type semiconducting polymers is quite appealing. By fully solving the remaining problems, a bright future can be envisioned for organic electronics.
