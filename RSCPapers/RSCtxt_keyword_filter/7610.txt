    , Accepted 4th June 2018First published on 5th June 2018AbstractThe effect of co-absorbance on the performance of DSSC devices with a new design of dimer sensitizers possessing a 2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) bridge and various donor groups (carbazole, diphenyl amine, indole) is reported in the present work. The co-absorbent (CDCA = chenodeoxycholic acid) was inserted into the sensitizers and the photovoltaic performance was studied. The co-absorbent had a significant effect on Jsc, Voc and the efficiency. Without incorporation of the co-absorbent, a higher efficiency of around 4.40% is exhibited (Jsc = 9.91 mA cm−2 and Voc = 0.678 V) by the R3 device, while after adding the co-absorbent, we have achieved an efficiency of around 4.44% (Jsc = 10.3 mA cm−2 and Voc = 0.693 V). Structure optimization and energy level calculations were carried out by density functional theory (DFT) with different donor substituents and DPP bridge based sensitizers. The co-absorbent and sensitizer based DSSCs were also characterised by impedance spectroscopy and incident photon to current conversion efficiency measurements.
1. Introduction
Third generation dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an alternative to Si photovoltaic cells due to their effective conversion of sunlight into electricity. The assembling of devices on flexible and rigid substrates reduces the material cost and manufacturing cost in DSSCs compared to those of conventional solar cells.1–4 In DSSCs, illuminated light is absorbed by dyes and the excited electrons are transported to the conduction band (CB) of nanocrystalline TiO2 films. Metal based dyes (e.g. Ru and porphyrin) exhibit the highest PCE in DSSCs due to their broad absorption spectrum and good stability. However, Ru based dyes have some drawbacks, such as a toxic metal ion in the dye skeleton, purification problem of the final product, quite complicated synthesis processes and low yield.2,3 To avoid these problems, different research groups have designed and developed novel and effective metal free dyes that reduce the production cost, provide high molar extinction coefficients and show an appreciable DSSC response.5,6 In addition, in this work, the starting materials used for the fabrication are easily available. The metal free organic dyes have a D–π–A type chemical structure. To date, different types of donor, bridge and acceptor moieties have been used to develop new metal free dyes.7–9
In this paper, we have studied the influence of different donor moiety (carbazole, diphenyl amine and indole) based dyes, substituted with diketopyrrolopyrrole (π-linker) and –CNCHCOOH (anchor). As per the literature, diketopyrrolopyrrole type bridges have been used so far in different metal free dyes for DSSC application.10–16
The order of the red shift of absorbance maxima (λmax) is R3 < R2 < R1 and this λmax depends on the presence of different donor groups and their donating ability. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the various donor moieties substituted on the DPP based sensitizers. For reduced dye aggregation on titania surfaces, we have substituted a diketopyrrolopyrrole π-linker in between the donor and acceptor groups. The carbazole (CBZ) donor moiety based dye exhibited a higher extent of light absorption and longer electron lifetime as well. The photovoltaic device based on the CBZ donor group shows higher photocurrent density (Jsc), photovoltage (Voc) and over-all power conversion efficiency (η) under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination. When we changed the donor moieties in the dye, the physical properties like electron lifetime, mobility, charge distribution between the donor and acceptor groups and their corresponding energy levels were also changed. With the change in the donor moiety on the DPP bridge based dyes, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels were changed due to intramolecular interactions via hydrogen bonding.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure of metal free sensitizers. 
As per the literature survey, dyes based on the same bridge and acceptor groups contain different substituted donor groups, which changes their light absorption properties, Jsc, Voc and PCE.3,6 Further enhancement of the PCE of the photovoltaic devices was due to the mixing of numerous kinds of additives into the sensitizer solution. Gratzel et al. reported that mixing of cholic acid with the sensitizer increases both Jsc and Voc of DSSCs.17 Moreover, co-absorbents, such as DPA, HDMA, DCA, CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid), etc., were also used in the dye solution when a TiO2 photo-anode was incorporated into DSSCs.18–20 Therefore, in this work, to understand the importance of CDCA in the enhancement of DSSCs’ performance parameters, the influence of CDCA on three dyes, intramolecular electron transfer and electron lifetime in photovoltaic devices was studied.21–23
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
Meltonix tape, TiO2 paste and conducting glass substrates (i.e. FTO = fluorine doped tin oxide, 12 Ω cm−2) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. Carbazole (>97.0%), diphenyl amine (>99.0%), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopent[b]indole (96%) were purchased form Sigma Aldrich and phenoxazine (98.0%) and cyanoacetic acid (98.0%) were purchased from TCI Chemical Pvt. Ltd China. N-Bromo-ethane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The 4-bromo-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1-carbaldehyde derivative was prepared according to a reported process.24,25
2.2 Device fabrication
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated by following our previous reported procedure.26,27 In brief, a nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductor thin film (∼9 μm thickness) was prepared on a conducting FTO substrate and the TiO2 electrode was kept overnight on a dye bath (30 mM dye solution prepared in a mixture of ethanol and dichloromethane) for sensitization of the dye. Platinum black electrodes were prepared by spin-coating a Pt-salt solution on a conducting FTO substrate at a stirring rate of 1500 rpm and then annealing it at 450 °C for 10 min inside a furnace. Open devices were fabricated in open air by clamping various dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes with Pt-counter electrodes. Then the liquid electrolyte (redox couple I−/I3− contains BIMI, TBP and I2 (1:1:0.1) in 3-methoxy propionitrile) was filled in between the photoanode and counter electrodes. The active area of the DSSC device was around 0.25 cm2.

2.4 General synthesis procedure for the carbazole based R3 sensitizer
The synthesis of 3,6-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,5-diethyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione molecules (a) was carried out according to a reported process.28,29

Alkylation (compound (b)). 
Compound a (0.5 g) and K2CO3 (0.25 g) were dispersed in dry dimethylformamide (15 ml) at 90 °C for 1 h under an argon atmosphere. Then N-bromoethane was added slowly drop by drop, followed by stirring the mixture at 110 °C for 1 h. After stirring, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water. The precipitate formed was separated out and washed with water, and then dried using Na2SO4. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with hexane/EA as the eluent.


Suzuki cross coupling. 
Equimolar quantities of compound b and 5-formyl thiophene-2-boronic acid were mixed in the presence of a base and refluxed for 12 h. After the refluxing process thiophene moieties introduced an extended pi conjugation into the molecular architecture. The reaction mixture was dumped into water and was separated by mixing with chloroform. After that the crude product was purified by column chromatography.


Donor substituted with a pyrrole derivative. 
A mixture of 4-bromo-2,5-diethyl-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1-carbaldehyde (1.5 g), carbazole (1.65 g), KOH, CuI and 1,10-Phen. was taken together in dichlorobenzene and refluxed for 1 day. After cooling, the insoluble material was filtered under suction and the filtrate was poured into ice-cold water and was extracted with dichloromethane solvent.


Condensation. 
The tetrahydropyrrolecarbaldehyde derivative (0.05 g), cyanoacetic acid (0.045 g) and ammonium acetate (0.06 g) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and acetic acid (1:0.9 volume ratio) under refluxing conditions for 3 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was dumped into ice-cold water. The precipitate formed was separated by filtration and simultaneously washed out with water, ethanol and hexane to afford a brown solid powder. A similar procedure was followed for the synthesis of dyes R1 and R2, by changing the donor moieties.

2.5 Characterization

Structural and optical measurements. 
The structure of our embellished sensitizers was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Bruker Avance IIIHD400 MHz, Micro mass MS Technologies). UV-visible spectra were recorded using a SHIMADZU (UV1800) UV-vis spectrophotometer.


Electrochemistry. 
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was measured using a CHI instrument (CHI-611D) using three electrode systems (non-aq. Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, Pt-disk as the counter electrode and Pt-wire as the counter electrode). TBAP (tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate) salt was used as the supporting electrolyte. The CV data were recorded at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1.


Theoretical calculation. 
A theoretical study (i.e. optimized structure, energy level calculation) of all synthesised sensitizer molecules was carried out using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.


Photovoltaic characteristics. 
The efficiency of the DSSC devices was calculated based on their monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) with a commercial setup (SR 300, Optosolar, Germany, under a 250 W, Xe lamp). The J–V characteristics of the DSSC devices were measured under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) light illumination and recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Interfacial studies of the prepared devices were carried out by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique using an Autolab PGSTAT101 interface (frequency range 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and 10 mV amplitude).

3. Results and discussion
The UV-vis spectra of the sensitizers were recorded in ethanol solution and sensitized on a titania semiconductor surface. It is shown in Fig. 2 along with the parameters presented in Table 1.

The carbazole based R3 sensitizer showed a broad absorption peak at 455 nm, while diphenyl amine and indole based R1 and R2 sensitizers exhibited lower absorption peaks at 423 nm and 436 nm respectively. We attributed the longer wavelength absorbance peak to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor group to the anchoring group. The sensitizer R3 possessed high absorption maxima with a molar extinction coefficient ε = 4501 M−1 cm−1 due to the highly conjugated heterocyclic electron donor (or electron-rich atom available in the skeleton) moiety. Sensitizers R1 and R2 have similar ε values of 3782 M−1 cm−1 and 40120 M−1 cm−1 respectively. The higher ε of the R3 sensitizer compared to those of R1 and R2 is due to the strong π–π* transition. Sensitizer R3 shows a comparatively broad absorption range in the visible region than those of R1 and R2 in solution as well as on the TiO2 semiconductor matrix. The absorption spectra of these dyes sensitized on titania thin films are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption maximum peaks of the R1, R2 and R3 dyes, sensitized on the TiO2 matrix, are located at 455 nm, 458 nm and 480 nm respectively.
For further investigation of the dye skeleton, we have carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) under a nitrogen atmosphere and calculated the band gap and energy levels of the dyes. The CV and relevant parameters of the sensitizers are exhibited in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The calculation of HOMO energy levels from the onset of the oxidation potential (Eonset) of the dyes was performed using the following equation.  
 Fig. 3  CV of D–π–A sensitizers in acetonitrile. 
All dyes possess a quasi-reversible oxidation peak due to electron oxidation coupling, which can be dependent on the oxidation of the donor moieties. HOMO levels of the three synthesised sensitizers are −5.97 (R1), −5.74 (R2) and −5.78 (R3) respectively. These values are lower than the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide redox mediator. The LUMO energy levels of the dyes were calculated from the band gap (determined from UV-vis spectra, Tauc plot) and the equation used is,LUMO (eV) = Eg − HOMO
The LUMO values of R1, R2 and R3 are −3.04 eV, −2.90 eV and −3.06 eV respectively, which are higher than the conduction band of the titania semiconductor. Optimized structures of all sensitizers, their geometries and electronic structures were evaluated using DFT calculated using the Gaussian 09 program with the B3LYP/6-31G basis set.
The optimized structural geometries of all three sensitizers are shown in Fig. 4. Donor moieties (carbazole, diphenyl amine and indole) share the same diketopyrrolopyrrole bridge and –CNCHCOOH as the acceptor group in the metal free donor-bridge-acceptor structure. The geometry of all the optimized dyes clearly depicts that they have a slightly twisted structure and that the strongly diffused π bridge and HOMO levels are situated on the donor moiety. For LUMO levels the energy density is concentrated on the cyanoacetic acid group and the bridge and is slightly diffused into the donor moieties. The energy levels of all three sensitizers are well separated, and therefore efficient charge migration can occur from the donor to the anchoring group in the photoexcited state. Moreover, HOMO to LUMO energy level transfer for dyes R1 to R3 is 82%, 84% and 87% respectively.

The J–V curve in Fig. 5 shows the effect of various substituted donor moieties in the dimer sensitizer D–π–A structure. Among these, the carbazole donor group based sensitizer, R3, exhibited excellent photocurrent efficiency (η = 4.40%, Jsc = 9.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.678 V, FF = 63%) compared to R1 (η = 3.51%, Jsc = 8.44 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.670 V, FF = 62%) and R2 (η = 3.92%, Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.664 V, FF = 63%) based devices. This result indicated that electron generation and injection via intra-molecular charge transfer into the CB (R3) of sensitized titania is more efficient compared to the R1 and R2 sensitizers.
For enhancement of photovoltaic performance, we have incorporated co-absorbent CDCA into all the synthesised sensitizers. Co-absorbent CDCA is a transparent and organic material which is tightly attached to the surface of the TiO2 semiconductor, being able to displace the sensitizer molecules on the TiO2 surface and therefore reducing sensitizer aggregation.17,30 This co-absorbent is used to improve DSSC efficiency due to its capability to hinder sensitizer aggregation, resulting in the increase of electron injection efficiency, thus leading to an enhancement of device Jsc. Moreover, in some cases, the presence of the co-absorbent can also lead to an improvement in Voc, attributed to the reduction of charge recombination. The presence of the CDCA co-absorbent in the R3 device resulted in higher η = 4.44% compared to that of the triphenyl amine based R1 (η = 3.71%) and indole based R2 (η = 4.02%) sensitizers. A highly comparable trend is also observed in the case of Jsc and Voc parameters, i.e. the R3 sensitizer has a Jsc value of around 10.31 mA cm−2, while for R1 and R2 dye sensitized devices, the Jsc values are 8.69 mA cm−2 and 9.62 mA cm−2 respectively.
In theoretical calculations, we got similar trends (compared to J–V characteristics) as well. The effective charge transfer, which increased the Voc of the R3 device, was due to the upside shift of the Fermi level of the TiO2 semiconductor and reduced charge recombination. Furthermore, according to optical data, R3 sensitizer loading on the TiO2 surface is higher which also contributed to the higher ε. The FFs of these three DSSC devices showed rather insignificant difference.
Moreover, IPCE measurements were conducted to examine the conversion of sunlight into electricity in the presence of monochromatic light. The results are presented in Fig. 6. It clearly shows that all three sensitizers can effectively convert visible light into electricity in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm. The IPCE for R3 exceeds 40% in the spectral range of 300–450 nm and reaches its maximum of 45% at 480 nm. The IPCE of R1 and R2 reached its maximum of 38% and 40% at 460 nm respectively. The lower range of IPCE spectra of the R1 and R2 sensitizers was due to their lower ε (according to UV vis spectra, please see Fig. 2). The UV vis spectra also support IPCE results because both measurement trends are similar.

A further study of electron recombination and interface relationship in photovoltaic cells was carried out by EIS measurement at 0.64 V bias and the recorded Nyquist plot is presented in Fig. 7. The Nyquist plot was fitted with an equivalent circuit and electron interface parameters such as the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2 surface, charge transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) were evaluated.31–33 The fitted parameters in the Nyquist plots are depicted in Table 3.

The impedance spectra of the DSSC devices possess two semicircles. The first semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the platinum and redox mediator interface and the second semicircle shows the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) of the sensitizer/TiO2 interface.34,35 Impedance spectroscopy results show that the electron transport property of the CBZ donor moiety based R3 device is high, which has been clearly reflected by the 2nd semicircle in the lower frequency range, and also show that the charge recombination Rrec is higher in the R3 device than in R1 and R2 sensitizer based DSSCs. In Fig. 7, the radius of the second semicircle arc is reduced in the order R3 > R2 > R1. The charge transfer resistance in the Pt electrode is quite similar in the three devices. All these impedance parameters are calculated by fitting the semicircle curves with an equivalent circuit.26,36,37
The Rrec of the carbazole based R3 device is higher compared to those of the other two devices. This fact indicates that the R3 device yields higher Jsc, Voc and efficiency as well. The R3 device has a higher electron lifetime (τe) and its shift to lower frequency leads to a higher τe and it exhibits a larger Voc value. The R3 device gives higher τe on the titania surface with higher frequency maxima in EIS which is the primary reason for the improved performance of the DSSC devices.
4. Conclusions
DSSC devices have been fabricated using dihydropyrrolo-pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) bridge based metal free D–π–A sensitizers with different donor moieties, such as triphenyl amine, indole and carbazole. The effect of different donor moieties on the metal free sensitizers is quite interesting. The R3 device based on the carbazole donor moiety based dye with co-absorbent exhibits a lower degree of charge recombination and enhanced photocurrent efficiency compared to those of R1 (diphenylamine) and R2 (indole) devices. As a result of these variations, the DSSC device based on R3 (carbazole) achieves an excellent performance with Jsc = 10.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.693 V, corresponding to an η of 4.44% under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination. To further enhance the photovoltaic performance a co-absorbent (i.e. CDCA) was incorporated into all synthesised dyes. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that carbazole donor moieties, substituted with a DPP bridge and a –CNCHCOOH sensitizer, are excellent compared to triphenyl amine and indole moieties and this particular type of substituted carbazole donor moiety can be a true commercially potential candidate to increase the efficiency of DSSCs.
