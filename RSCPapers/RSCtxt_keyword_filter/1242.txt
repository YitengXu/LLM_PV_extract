    , Accepted 1st November 2012First published on 26th November 2012AbstractA fused ladder D–A type alternating conjugated polymer, PIDT-FQ, with indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the donor unit and di-fluorophenylquinoxaline (FQ) as the acceptor unit, was synthesized and characterized for organic photovoltaic (OPV) application. Optical measurements indicate that the bandgap of PIDT-FQ was 1.81 eV. The incorporation of fluorine allows the polymer to have a desirable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.36 eV), which suggested that the polymer would exhibit high open-circuit voltages when blended with fullerene as the electron acceptor. We investigate the morphology and performance of OPV based on blended films of PIDT-FQ and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The resulting fine-scale morphology leads to enhanced performance and a high power efficiency (4.6% under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2)) when we used the thermal treatment and solvent annealing process.
1. Introduction
During the last decade, organic photovoltaics (OPV) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their low cost, light weight and capacity for roll-to-roll technology.1–4 Wet-processing is the main advantage of OPV, in which the active layer is the solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend composed of electron-donating p-type conjugated polymers and electron-withdrawing fullerenes. With the innovation of materials and device engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs has been improved to up to 10.6% using new active layer materials5 and tandem architecture.6 This encouraging progress advances such technology towards commercial application. To obtain higher OPV efficiencies, researchers are seeking optimized materials with the aim of improving charge transporting properties, narrowing the band gap (Eg) for better sunlight harvesting, deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels so as to increase the open circuit voltage (Voc) and superior solubility and miscibility with fullerenes, which could provide a well-defined blend morphology for a reasonable fill factor (FF). Because these parameters are often traded-off, it is a great challenge to design and synthesize a material to meet all the challenging points required for highly efficient OPV application. For instance, the decreasing of Eg is usually accompanied by the lowering of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level and/or increasing the HOMO energy level. The excitons will disfavour dissociating when the difference in LUMO levels between the polymer and fullerene pair is decreased. The increasing HOMO energy level results in a lower Voc.
Our previous studies on indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based derivatives have shown efficient OPV characteristics.7–9 The extended π-conjugated ladder structure leads to an improved conjugation length and the co-planarity of the molecular backbones. The resulting alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer of the tetra-hexylphenyl substituted IDT and benzothiadiazole (BT) unit exhibited a PCE of 6.4%.7 More importantly, the derivatives based on tetra-alkyl substituted IDT unit exhibited field-effect hole mobilities as high as 1 cm2 V−1 S−1.10 A high PCE and mobility make IDT a good electron donating (D) co-monomer for D–A based conjugated polymers. Within the class of conjugated polymers for OPV application, quinoxaline has been widely implemented as an electron-withdrawing (A) co-monomer for D–A based polymers.11–13 The quinoxaline unit is an attractive structure because of its facile synthesis and versatility. The introduction of substituent moieties onto the two and three positions of quinoxaline is easy and this advantage allows researchers to modify the solubility, Eg and energy levels of quinoxaline based derivatives.11–13 A PCE of over 6% was achieved by the co-polymerization of tetrahexylphenyl substituted IDT with phenanthrene–qunioxaline.13 Recently, several groups have reported fluorine substituted conjugated polymers for highly efficient OPV application.14–16 The use of fluorine has been proven to be effective in low-lying HOMO energy levels of respective polymers and increasing the Voc of OPV devices. Furthermore, fluorine is smaller in size when compared with other electron withdrawing groups (CN, NO2) and can be easily attached on the backbone of polymers without generating too much steric hindrance.
To investigate the effect of the fluorine atom on quinoxaline based A, herein we have introduced it onto the para position of the phenyl rings of diphenylquinoxaline which was then copolymerized with the IDT donor to obtain a new fused ladder D–A based conjugated polymer (PIDT-FQ;Scheme 1). We expect to further increase the Voc and hence the PCE of the aforementioned polymer due to the introduction of the F atom. As we expected, a deep HOMO of −5.36 eV was obtained and a PIDT-FQ derived device exhibits an improvement Voc of 0.9 V when compared to the Voc of 0.87 of the previous report (PIDT-diphQ).13 The improvement on device performance through morphology engineering is further reported in this study. The result indicates that the F-based polymer is a promising candidate for application in OPV.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials and characterization
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise specified. The compound IDT has been already reported in our previous report.7 The FQ was synthesized according to the literature.111H NMR spectrum was recorded using a Bruker AV-500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded using a Hitachi U-3300 spectrophotometer. The molecular weight of the polymer was measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and polystyrene standards. The glass transition temperature of the polymer was determined by using a Seiko SII-EXSTAR 6000-DSC-6200 instrument under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was estimated by CV using an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3) reference electrode (CH Instruments, Inc). The optical bandgap (Eg) was calculated from the threshold of absorption. The energy level of the LUMO was estimated by subtracting the energy gap (Eg) from the HOMO energy level.
2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
All BHJ OPV cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. Glass/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates [Sanyo, Japan (8 Ω □−1)] were sequentially patterned lithographically, cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min, and treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P-VP AI4083) was passed through a 0.45 μm filter prior to being deposited on ITO (thickness: ca. 30 nm) through spin-coating at 3000 rpm in air; the sample was then dried at 140 °C for 20 min inside a glove box. A blend of PC71BM and a polymer at a defined ratio (1:2.5) was stirred overnight in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), filtered through a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and then spin-coated (1000–1200 rpm, 30 s) on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The device was completed by depositing a 30 nm-thick layer of Ca and a 100 nm-thick layer of Al at pressures of less than 10−6 Torr. For the solvent annealing (SA) process, the devices were placed inside a Petri dish (with a diameter of 10 cm) for annealing with saturated DCB vapor (0.5 mL was added into the Petri dish) for 10 min. The active area of the device was 5 mm2. Finally, the cell was encapsulated using UV curing glue (Nagase, Japan). The current–voltage (I–V) properties of the OPV devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) and a Peccell solar simulator under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell and a KG-5 filter. The morphologies of the polymer films were analysed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a VEECO DICP-II instrument operated in the dynamic force mode at ambient temperature; the etched Si probe exhibited a resonant frequency of 131 kHz and a spring constant of 11 N m−1.
2.3 Synthesis of PIDT-FQ

IDT (0.6g, 0.487 mmole), FQ (5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)quinoxaline) (0.232 g, 0.487 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (0) (17.88 mg, 0.0195 mmol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (47.45 mg, 0.156 mmol) were added to dry chlorobenzene (20 mL). The reaction mixture was purged with N2 and subjected to three freeze/pump/thaw cycles to remove the O2. The mixture was heated in a microwave reactor for 30 min. The deep-blue solution was poured into methanol (1 L) and the dark-blue precipitate was collected on a membrane filter. The polymer was then washed for 72 h through Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone and hexane sequentially; the soluble fraction was then collected through extraction with CHCl3. The extract was concentrated and precipitated into methanol to yield the polymer as a deep-blue product (80%). GPC (THF): Mn = 36100 g mol−1, Mw = 65700 g mol−1, PDI = 1.82; λmax = 585 nm. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 8.03 (s, 2H), 7.92 (s, 2H), 7.71 (d, 4H), 7.52 (s, 2H), 7.09–7.40 (br, 16H), 7.06 (t, 4H), 2.60 (m, 8H), 1.59 (m, 4H), 1.36 (m, 28H), 0.87 (m, 12H).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of PIDT-FQ
The synthetic route of PIDT-FQ is shown in Scheme 1. The FQ was synthesized according to the procedure of previous literature.11 The distannyl IDT was synthesized by following the same method that we reported previously.7PIDT-FQ was synthesized via the Stille coupling polymerization using chlorobenzene as the solvent and Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst under microwave heating, which improved the molecular weights and reduced the reaction times relative to those of conventional heating.17PIDT-FQ shows good solubility at room temperature in organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chlorobenzene. The molecular structure of PIDT-FQ was verified by 1H NMR and UV-vis spectra. The 1H NMR spectrum of PIDT-FQ is shown in Fig. S1.† The peaks at δ 7.06, 7.71 and 8.03 ppm are assigned to the proton resonance of the FQ unit. The residue characteristic peaks at δ 7.92–7.09 ppm can be assigned to the resonance of IDT protons on the thiophene ring, the phenylene ring and the phenyl side groups. There is a peak at δ 2.60 ppm which is attributed to the methylene group attached to the phenyl group. The peaks in the ranges of δ 1.59–0.87 ppm arise from the tetra-hexyl-substituent of the IDT unit. All the integral ratios of the peak areas between the aromatic and aliphatic signals agree with the corresponding molecular structure of the PIDT-FQ. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrenes as the internal standards. The Mw of PIDT-FQ is 36100 g mol−1 with a PDI of 1.82. The thermal transition of the polymer was also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). However, there is no thermal transition in the range from 40 °C to 300 °C.
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PIDT-FQ is shown in Fig. 1. The UV-vis spectrum of the polymer is similar to that of our previous D–A-type polymers,7 with two characteristic absorption bands observed near 415 and 585 nm. We assign the higher-energy absorption bands to π–π* transitions from the IDT unit and the longer-wavelength absorption bands to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) between the IDT unit and the FQ moiety. The optical bandgap (Eg), determined from the onset of absorption is 1.81 eV. The small value of Eg should improve light harvesting and enhance the photocurrent of a device. We determined the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer from cyclic voltammetry and Eg. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were −5.36 and −3.55 eV, respectively. The LUMO is approximately 0.75 eV higher than the LUMO energy level of PCBM; this range is reasonable for efficient exciton dissociation from PIDT-FQ to PCBM. The observed HOMO energy level is generally related to the Voc of the fabricated devices. The result suggested that the polymer would exhibit a high Voc when blended with PCBM as the electron acceptor.

3.2 Organic photovoltaic properties
We fabricated OPV cells having the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm), with spin-coating of the blend from o-DCB solutions (Fig. 2(a)). Fig. 2(b) displays the picture of the as casting blend film from PIDT-FQ:PC71BM with a 1:2.5 weight ratio. The blend film is not uniform, and a lotus like pattern is observed. The corresponding device exhibited an unsatisfactory PCE of 2.6% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), with values of the Jsc, Voc and FF as 6.7 mA cm−2, 0.81 V and 0.47, respectively. (Fig. 3(a), Table 1) The PCEs of these fabricated devices were reproducible, with a variation of only 5% exhibited among five individual OPV devices. This is shown in Table 1, the numbers in parentheses show the average device performance among the fabricated devices. It is well known, that for photoactive layers deposited through spin-casting, kinetic as well as thermodynamic effects determine their morphologies.18 From a thermodynamic point of view, the intrinsic properties of the PIDT-FQ and PC71BM components, such as the Flory–Huggins parameter, interactions and solubility were determined. To get a high quality film, we then tried to manipulate the morphology of the blend film through the film formation process (kinetic factors), such as the solvent evaporation rate and the post-treatment. We found that the blends morphology changed dramatically upon using thermal treatment (TT). The as casting blend films became uniform when we quickly spin coated the films, while the blend solution and the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate was still warm. (Fig. 2(c)) The blend solution and substrate were pre-heated at 70 °C for 5 min before spin-coating. The TT-derived device exhibited an improvement in PCE of 4.2%, with values of Jsc, Voc and FF of 8.9 mA cm−2, 0.89 V and 0.534, respectively. (Fig. 3(a)) The TT process provides a facile way to control the quality of the PIDT-FQ based blend films. Since, for a thin film that was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution from o-DCB, the solvent evaporates slowly and allows equilibrium to be reached. Because the composition of the liquid phase of the o-DCB system reached its equilibrium solubility limit of both PIDT-FQ and PCBM slowly, poor quality films were resulted. The TT process quickens the solvent evaporation rate and allows the blend to solidify quickly and turns out a uniform blend film.

From the device engineering aspects, researchers used the post-treatment (kinetic factors) like thermal annealing,19 solvent mixture,20 additives21,22 and solvent annealing (SA)7 to further control the blend film morphology and hence improve the device performance. In order to get a better PCE, these methodologies were tested (Table S1†). The PIDT-FQ, being an amorphous polymer, does not have observable thermal transitions below the degradation point. Thermal annealing, however, showed no effect on device performance for PIDT-FQ or most other newly synthesized conjugated polymers.7 The change of the solvent mixtures from different ratios of o-DCB and CB only shows negative effects. A strategy based on additives (1,8-octanedithiol and chloro-naphthalene) has been eliminated as a means towards improving the PCE in this polymer system. The device showed a meaningful improvement when we used SA as the post-treatment. The corresponding device exhibited an improvement of the PCE of 4.6%, with values of Jsc, Voc and FF of 9.2 mA cm−2, 0.90 V and 0.556, respectively. (Fig. 3(a)), Table 1). As we expected, a high Voc value was achieved due primarily to the deep HOMO energy level. When compared to a previous report,13 the device exhibited a higher Voc by the incorporation of fluorine. To further confirm the accuracy of the measurement, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device was measured. Fig. 3(b)) displays the EQE spectrum of the SA-derived device. The SA-fabricated device reveals a significant contribution of the EQE in the wavelength between 350 nm and 700 nm and is consistent with the UV-vis spectrum of the blend film (Fig. 1(b)) with the maximum EQE being approximately 58% at 460 nm. Convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux AM 1.5G spectrum gives an estimate for the Jsc under irradiation to be 9.0 mA cm−2. Due to the mismatch between EQE and photon flux AM 1.5G, there is an approximately 2% mismatch between convolution and solar simulator data. We calculated the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from the inverse slope of the respective J–V curves. A decrease of Rs from 17 to 14 Ω cm2 was observed for the cells before and after SA. The phenomenon implies the bulk resistance of the SA-derived device is lower and a higher FF was obtained. A small increase of Rsh from 532 to 540 Ω cm2 was obtained which indicates the defects caused by charge recombination and leakage current is similar.
3.3 Morphology evolution by solvent annealing
To investigate how the morphologies of the blend films evolved over the SA process, we employed AFM in the tapping mode to characterize the behaviour. For direct comparison, we prepared the films for AFM analysis under the same conditions used for device fabrication. Fig. 4 displays the topographical and phase images of the blend film spin-coated from the TT process before and after SA. The morphology in the blend film changed dramatically upon SA. The thin film without SA was rather flat and featureless. The root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness of the film was 0.87 nm. The surface of the SA sample was rougher, with an RMS roughness of 1.86 nm, and it featured a nano-island-like morphology (diameter: ca. 50 nm). Phase images of the two-component blend film provides information regarding the surface hardness and the identity of the fullerene- and polymer-rich domains.23 The phase images in Fig. 4 reveal two distinct feature types in the blend films: dark-colored agglomerates, which we attribute to PCBM-rich domains, and bright regions, denoting the PIDT-FQ-rich domains. A larger phase separation was found for the as casting TT derived film, characterized by the segregation of elongated larger PCBM-rich domains (length >80 nm) surrounded by a continuous PIDT-FQ-rich phase. In contrast, the SA film [Fig. 3(b)] reveals that it consisted of well-defined blends of PCBM domains (having a grain size ca. <50 nm) surrounded by PIDT-FQ domains. The SA process optimizes the blend morphology, leading to better phase separation between polymer chains and PCBM. As a result, the SA blend film has a preferred well-defined morphology to ensure the efficient charge separation and transport required in higher cell performance.

3.4 SCLC hole mobility
Besides the morphology, we suspect the differing hole mobility also contributes to variations in device performance. To evaluate the contribution of polymer mobility, we employed hole-only devices using a high-work-function material, palladium (Pd), as the cathode to block the back injection of electrons. When a sufficient voltage is applied to this hole-only device, the transport of holes through the polymer film is limited by the space charge that accumulates. The space charge limited current (SCLC) is described by the equation  where εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μh is the hole mobility, V is the voltage applied to the device and L is the blend thickness.23Fig. 3(c) displays the experimental dark-current densities of the TT- and SA-derived devices measured in the hole-only devices. The applied voltage was corrected for the built-in voltage (VBI), which we estimated from the difference between the work function and the energy level of the HOMO of PIDT-FQ. The plot of J0.5 with respect to V for the corresponding devices were straight lines Fig. 3(c)); from the slope we calculated the field-independent mobility of the TT- and SA-derived devices to be 2.1 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1 and 3.3 × 10−9 m2 V−1 s−1, respectively. A small increase of the hole mobility is observed after the SA process. The preliminary result indicates that the hole mobility in both devices are within the reasonable range. This suggested that the enhanced PCE of the SA-derived device was due primarily to the well-defined morphology and the higher hole mobility.
4 Conclusions
We have demonstrated a high performance OPV device by using a fused ladder D–A type alternating conjugated polymer, PIDT-FQ. The incorporation of fluorine showed an effective ability to tailor the HOMO energy level of the polymer. A deeper HOMO energy level and higher Voc was observed. When using TT and SA as the post-treatment, the PCE reached 4.6% which is a 77% increase compared with the as casting device. The resulted morphology featured appropriate nano-phase segregation and higher hole mobility. The high Voc and improved device performance make PIDT-FQ a promising candidate for high-performance OPV.
