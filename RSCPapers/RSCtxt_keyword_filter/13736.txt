    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractEffective ternary material systems are usually achieved using a donor/acceptor guest that is structurally similar to the donor/acceptor host to maintain the film-morphology of the host binary blend. In this study, we report an unprecedented ternary material system, PBDB-TF:PBDB-T-SF:Y6, in which PBDB-T-SF is selected as the donor polymer guest of the PBDB-TF:Y6 binary blend. The absorption spectra of both polymers are almost overlapped and their energy levels are similar. However, the side-chains between the host (PBDB-TF) and the guest (PBDB-T-SF) are oriented differently, which modulates the morphology of the polymer phases from nanoscale (10–20 nm) fine fibrils in the host binary blend to an interpenetrating mesoscale polymer-crowd (>100 nm) with reduced phase crystallinity in the ternary blend. As a result, the electrical properties of the active layer are greatly improved: the hole mobility increases more than the electron mobility, resulting in balanced hole and electron mobilities; the monomolecular and bimolecular recombinations are both reduced; the charge carrier extraction is faster and the trap-assisted recombination is reduced, resulting in a longer recombination lifetime of charge carriers (0.19 μs vs. 0.15/0.11 μs). All of these contribute to the concurrently increased device fill-factor and short-circuit current-density, and finally improved efficiency (16.4%). Solid-state 19F magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic microscopy is conducted to probe interaction between the host and guest donor polymers. This study demonstrates that mesoscale morphology such as the polymer-crowd induced by differently oriented side chains of the host–guest polymers can be a morphological feature of active layer toward high-efficiency organic photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have received increasing attention in the past few decades due to their potential as one type of next generation solar cell. In the past two years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached over 14% (ref. 1 and 2) and 17%,3 respectively, obtained from the single-junction and tandem solar cell that uses the ITIC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-n-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3d:2′,3′d′]-s-indaceno[1,2b:5,6b′]dithiophene)4-like molecule as the nonfullerene acceptor material. With the invention of fused benzothiadiazole based nonfullerene acceptors such as Y6 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2, ′′3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))-bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)dimalononitrile),5 the PCEs from single-junction solar cells have reached over 16% very recently.6–8 The great progress in the research of the OPV field suggests a bright future for the fundamental research on OPVs. Nonetheless, the PCE value is yet low compared to other types of solar cells such as perovskite. Synthesis of new OPV materials and the search for new multi-component systems that can effectively improve the PCEs of OPVs remain urgently required.
Ternary9–12 and quaternary13 strategies have been proven effective in boosting the device parameters. In these strategies, the use of guest components allows scientists to have more material choices and hence more mechanism selections to modulate the absorption, bandgap, energy level, and film-morphology of the active layer.14–21 When the structure of the guest component is similar to that of the donor or acceptor host, i.e. the guest and host components (donors or acceptors) are compatible or miscible,22–24 the structural similarity will benefit the guest component to comply with the aggregation of the host, offering maintenance of the homogeneous fine film-morphology of the donor or acceptor phases,25i.e., the formation of alloy-like donor or acceptor phases.26,27 Hence, the advantages of the optical, electrochemical, and film-forming properties of the guest components can be reflected at the device level through mechanisms such as energy transfer28–30 and charge transfer via a cascaded energy level alignment31 or a parallel-like32 model, leading to improved device function, such as increased short-circuit current-density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and even fill-factor (FF). For example, to extend the absorption range, particularly, to more fully cover the near infrared (NIR) solar emission spectrum so as to obtain an increased Jsc, a ternary strategy can be designed by using a narrower bandgap donor or acceptor as the third component.33–43 Well, Voc cannot be increased in this strategy due to the lower-lying level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) required for obtaining the smaller optical bandgap. In this context, another strategy by loading a higher-LUMO-level acceptor44–46 or a deeper-HOMO-level donor47,48 to supply an increased Voc has emerged as an effective ternary approach with the concurrent increase in Jsc and FF in some of the cases.
Let us turn to the recently emerged Y6, again. The Y6 based OPV devices, for example, with PBDB-TF as the donor polymer show a broad and high photon-to-electron response which supplies a promising Jsc, approaching 25 mA cm−2, and again, an excellent value of Voc, ∼0.84 V. Although the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy offset between the donor and Y6 has been optimized (below 0.01 eV), the large LUMO energy offset, however, leaves energy level space to insert a higher-LUMO-level acceptor guest to raise the LUMO level of the alloyed acceptor phase. Based on this consideration, the selection of IDIC, ITCT, BTF (4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole), or PCBM as the guest acceptor material has led to the realization of ternary solar cells with over 16% efficiency.25,49–53 It was observed that the loaded IDIC acted as an additional hole path to generate charge carriers49 and the use of PCBM enabled the reduction of the nonradiative energy loss.51 In the molecular structures, Y6 is somewhat similar to IT-4F54 as both molecules are constructed in the A–D–A type configuration with the electron-accepting (A) unit of INCN (2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile) as the end group. However, their structures are quite different: the electron-rich (D) core structure offers Y6 a bending shape, while giving rise to a quasi-one-dimensional shape for IT-4F. We have made a comparative study on the Y6 and IT-4F based solar cell blend film-morphologies and their device functions. In comparison to the larger and longer fibril structures of the donor phases seen on the IT-4F blends, finer phase-separation and finer and shorter polymer phases were always observed in the Y6 blends. The hole mobility of the Y6 blends was smaller than the electron mobility, and also, it was smaller than the hole mobility observed in the IT-4F blend.25,49,53 As such, increasing the hole mobility so as to obtain balanced hole and electron mobilities with improved charge carrier extraction and reduced recombination is of great importance to achieve improved device function.
Tuning the polymer phase morphology by using a two-donor based ternary strategy can be effective in increasing the hole mobility. Considering the amorphous nature of polymer based photovoltaic materials, increasing the phase crystallinity by inserting a crystalline donor component has been proposed to increase the hole mobility, by which concurrently increased Jsc and FF were obtainable though the absorption spectrum of the third component is overlapped with the host component.55–61 In contrast to that, we report herein the modulation of the polymer phase morphology by using two polymer donors with their side-chains oriented differently. The two donor polymers are PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF, both having identical backbone structures (Fig. 1a), while the side-chains at the 4,8 positions of the electron-donating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) of PBDB-T-SF are differently oriented in comparison to PBDB-TF (Fig. 1b). The loading of PBDB-T-SF as the guest donor polymer not only reduces the polymer phase crystallinity but also tunes the polymer phase morphology, going from the nanoscale (10–20 nm) fibrils observed in the PBDB-TF:Y6 binary film to the mesoscale (over 100 nm) interpenetrating polymer-crowd observed in the PBDB-TF:PBDB-T-SF:Y6 ternary film, by which the hole mobility increases more than the electron mobility and balanced hole and electron mobilities are obtained; the charge carrier extraction is faster and the trap-assisted recombination is reduced; and finally, the electrical properties of the active layer are largely improved, leading to concurrently increased FF and Jsc. Ultimately, over 16% efficiency is obtained in the optimized ternary device.

Results and discussion
In PBDB-TF, the 2-ethylhexyl chain on the BDT unit is conjugated directly to the 3-F-thienyl-2 position via a single carbon–carbon bond, while in PBDB-T-SF, a sulphur atom is inserted between the 2-ethylhexyl chain and the 3-F-thienyl-2-carbon to form a thiol derivative. To get insightful information on the orientation of the side-chains, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to optimize the polymer conformations. The results are given in Fig. 1b. Since the C–S–C bonds are oriented at about 102° from the central S atom, the 2-ethylhexyl chain on PBDB-T-SF is oriented outward the polymer backbone plane at a dihedral angle (θ2) of ∼36.26°, while on PBDB-TF, the dihedral angle (θ2) is ∼3.80°, suggesting the 2-ethylhexyl chain on PBDB-TF can be coplanar with the polymer backbone.
The absorption spectra of the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF are overlapped (Fig. 2a), which can be explained by their identical backbone structures. Therefore, replacement of the weight ratio amount of PBDB-TF with PBDB-T-SF such as in a ratio of 0.85:0.15 does not reduce the solar light absorption by the active layer. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers and Y6 were measured with cyclic voltammetry (CV) from their thin films under the same experimental conditions (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the HOMO/LUMO of PBDB-T-SF is positioned slightly lower than the HOMO/LUMO of PBDB-TF.

Photovoltaic cells with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were fabricated to test the solar cell performance. The ternary solar cell was optimized via changing the weight ratios of PBDB-TF:PBDB-T-SF, while maintaining the total donor:acceptor ratio to be 1:1.2. The optimized device was obtained when the PBDB-TF:PBDB-T-SF:Y6 ratio was 0.85:0.15:1.2 using 0.6% CN as the solvent additive (Table S1†). Table 1 collects the photovoltaic data and Fig. 3a shows the current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized binary and ternary devices. The inset of Fig. 3a shows the histograms of the PCEs of the optimized binary and ternary solar cells. A promising PCE of 16.4% is obtained from the ternary solar cell. We sent the optimal device to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China and received a certified PCE of 15.3% (Fig. S2†). In comparison to the PBDB-TF-based binary device, the PBDB-T-SF based solar cell supplies a little larger Voc, and so, the ternary solar cell shows a slightly larger Voc (0.856 vs. 0.848 V). Again, a little larger Jsc (25.2 vs. 24.8 mA cm−2) is obtained in the ternary device. The Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves is consistent with the Jsc (Table 1) integrated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 3b) spectrum. Although the PBDB-T-SF based solar cell shows a lower FF than the PBDB-TF based one, introduction of PBDB-T-SF as the guest polymer gives rise to a much higher FF (73.6% vs. 76.1%). The series resistance (Rs) obtained directly from the illuminated J–V curve of the optimal device (Fig. 3a) decreases from 4.7 Ω cm2 to 3.6 Ω cm2, and simultaneously, the shunt resistance (Rsh), also obtained from the illuminated J–V curve of the optimal device (Fig. 3a) increases from 0.8 kΩ cm2 to 1.2 kΩ cm2 after 0.15 weight ratio amount of PBDB-T-SF is introduced into the PBDB-TF:Y6 blend. For the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary blend, the Rs and Rsh values are 5.7 Ω cm2 and 0.9 kΩ cm2, respectively. The reduced Rs and increased Rsh are among the reasons for the increased FF in the ternary solar cell (Fig. 3c). The dark J–V curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. S3.† The Rs/Rsh values calculated from the differential resistances (Rdiff)62 (Fig. 3d) are 0.69 Ω cm2/0.22 MΩ cm2, 0.64 Ω cm2/0.42 MΩ cm2, and 0.77 Ω cm2/0.54 MΩ cm2 for the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF based binary and the ternary devices, respectively. The series resistance under the dark conditions changes with the same trend as those calculated from the illuminated J–V curves and the replacement of 0.15 weight ratio amount of PBDB-TF with PBDB-T-SF leads to an increase in the shunt resistance, agreeing with the increase of the device FF.

(c) Plots of FF, Rs and Rshvs. the weight ratios of PBDB-TF:PBDB-T-SF of the ternary solar cells. (d) The differential resistances derived from the dark J–V curves of the optimal binary and ternary solar cells (Fig. S3†). 
The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities estimated with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4†) are 1.58 and 3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDB-TF:Y6 binary blend and 1.08 and 2.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary blend, respectively. The hole mobility is more than 2-fold smaller than the electron mobility for both the binary blends. For the ternary blend, the μh and μe values increase to 4.17 and 4.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities become balanced (μh/μe = 0.85), which is another reason for the increased device FF. Again, the increased hole and electron mobilities may account for the increased Jsc, which can be reflected in the EQE spectrum (Fig. 3c): the loading of PBDB-T-SF as the guest leads to increased EQE both in the polymer absorption region (450–640 nm) and in the Y6 absorption region (660–810 nm).
The photocurrent (Jph) of the optimal binary and ternary devices was calculated from the J–V data measured under the illumination and dark conditions, respectively, and is further plotted in Fig. 4a as a function of the effective internal field (Veff) with Veff = V0 − (Vbias + JphRs) where Vbias is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2. The term JphRs is added to correct the applied bias Vbias for the voltage loss occurring over the series resistance.63 The V0 is 0.93 V, 0.95 V, and 0.97 V for the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF binary and the ternary devices, respectively. At the low Veff scale, the higher Jph in the PBDB-TF based binary device suggests more efficient charge dissociation than in the PBDB-T-SF based binary solar cell. Although the charge dissociation in the low Veff region is lower in the ternary device than in the binary device, the photogenerated charge carriers can be collected more efficiently with the increase of Veff, which can be due to the larger hole and electron mobilities in the ternary blend. In the high Veff zone, the photocurrent of the ternary solar cell is larger than that of the host binary device, for example, at short-circuit, the Jph.sc is 25.67 mA cm−2 for the ternary and 24.82 and 24.15 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF-based binary devices, respectively; at Veff = 2.5 V, the Jph.sat is 26.39 mA cm−2, 25.54 and 24.39 mA cm−2, respectively. The larger Jph.sat value further supports the more efficient collection of the photogenerated charge carriers in the ternary device. As suggested by us previously, the collection of the photogenerated charge carriers at the maximum power point (MPP) can be more correlated with the device FF.25 In this study, the charge carrier collection efficiency at the MPP is 0.884, 0.856, and 0.834 for the ternary and the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF based binary devices, respectively, which is well consistent with the tendency of the device FF.
 Fig. 4  The plots of photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective internal field (Veff) (a), the light intensity dependent Jsc and Voc (b), the decay profiles of transient photovoltage (TPV) (c) and transient photocurrent (d) of the optimized binary and ternary devices. 
The scale of the Jsc, Jph, and FF is also related to the extraction and recombination of the charge carriers, which were probed with the light intensity (Plight) dependent J–V measurements and the data of transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC). The recombination of the charge carriers at open-circuit can be probed by the plots of Voc as a function of Plight (Fig. 4b) according to the equation Voc ∝ (nkT/q)lnPlight, here k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. The fitting n value is 1.08 kT/q for the ternary and 1.21 and 1.22 kT/q for the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF based binary devices, respectively. Normally, the n value is influenced by the monomolecular loss. In some cases, it can be affected by the leakage current, the shunt resistance, and the surface recombination.62 Here, the adjusted R-square obtained from the linear fitting is above 0.997 for the optimal binary and ternary devices, indicating that the leakage current is not a problem for the linear fitting. The n value is >kT/q, suggesting that the surface recombination is not a factor. The ternary device shows a little larger shunt resistance (1.2 kΩ cm2) than the binary devices (0.8–0.9 kΩ cm2), suggesting that the large shunt resistance observed in the ternary can be a factor for the reduced n value. Again, the smaller n value observed in the ternary device indicates that weaker monomolecular recombination (trap-assisted or geminate) is involved in comparison to the host binary solar cell. The trap-assisted recombination in the solar cell device can be probed by the TPV measurements at open-circuit. As shown in Fig. 4c, a slower decay of the Voc is observed in the binary device with PBDB-T-SF than with PBDB-TF as the donor polymer, suggesting weaker recombination included in the PBDB-T-SF based device. When replacing 0.15 weight ratio amount of PBDB-TF with PBDB-T-SF, resulting in the ternary solar cell, an even slower decay of Voc is observed, demonstrating even weaker trap-assisted recombination involved in the ternary compared to the binary devices. The lifetime (τrec) is estimated to be 0.19 μs for the ternary and 0.11 μs and 0.15 μs for the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF based binary devices, respectively, and the longer lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers suggests slower recombination dynamics in the ternary blend, which indicates that charge transfer is further improved by adding the guest donor PBDB-T-SF.
Under the short-circuit condition, the recombination induced by the bimolecular mechanism can be probed by the plot of Jsc as a function of Plight (Fig. 4b) according to the equation Jsc ∝ Pα. The fitting α value is 0.980, 0.962 and 0.943 for the ternary and the PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF based binary devices, respectively. The α value more approaching to unity observed in the ternary device suggests that less bimolecular recombination is involved. The closest value of α to unity can be explained with the balanced hole and electron mobilities observed in the ternary blend.64 The extraction of the charge carriers at short-circuit is further studied with the TPC data. The charge extraction kinetics is reflected in the photocurrent decay as shown in Fig. 4d, and the charge carrier extraction is faster in the PBDB-TF based device, which agrees with the larger charge mobilities compared to the PBDB-T-SF based binary device. With the loading of PBDB-T-SF as the third component, the photocurrent lifetime becomes shorter than the binary devices, suggesting improved charge transport and faster carrier extraction, which is also consistent with the even larger carrier mobilities.
Taken together, as 0.15 weight ratio amount of PBDB-TF is replaced with PBDB-T-SF, forming the ternary blend, the hole and electron mobilities increase and charge carrier mobilities become balanced. Due to the increased charge mobilities, the extraction of the carriers becomes faster, and meanwhile, the trap-assisted recombination of the charge carriers is reduced and the charge carrier lifetime becomes longer, which increases the collection efficiency of the charge carriers, resulting in increased Jsc and FF.
To obtain information about the role of morphology in the improved electrical properties of the active layer, we collected the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 5a–c) of the solar cell blend films of the binary and ternary devices. In comparison to the very fine phase-separated fibril-like film-morphology (10–20 nm) of the PBDB-TF binary blend, particle-like domains with larger domain sizes, typically, 30–60 nm, are observed in the PBDB-T-SF based binary blended film. The finer film-morphology can explain the more efficient charge dissociation observed in the plot of Jph ∼ Veff (Fig. 4a). When 0.15 weight ratio amount of PBDB-TF in its binary blend is replaced with PBDB-T-SF, a much different film-morphology is seen: the polymer molecules (the white fibrils) are crowded into meso-scale ‘polymer-crowd’-like domains with the sizes over 100 nm. The term “polymer-crowd” is used to reflect the morphological features such as a crowd of the polymer chains (molecules) aggregated via their side-chain interactions with the aggregated domain at the mesoscale level. Similarly, mesoscale morphology featuring a neuronal network has been observed in several cases.65,66 The crystallinity of the polymer phases can be reflected in the crystalline coherent length (CCL) value estimated from the graze-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data (Fig. 6 and S5†). The CCL value is 13.5 nm in the ternary blend, which is smaller in comparison to the CCL value (16.2 nm and 14.3 nm) for the PBDB-T-SF and PBDB-TF phases in their binary blends estimated from the lamellar signals appearing at q ∼ 0.28–0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. The decreased crystallinity is associated with the differently oriented side-chains of the two polymers: on PBDB-TF, the side chains on BDT are coplanar with the polymer backbone plane, while on PBDB-T-SF, the side chains are oriented outward the polymer backbone plane at about 36°. When PBDB-T-SF is introduced into the PBDB-TF:Y6 blend as the guest, the ordered packing of PBDB-TF is disturbed when PBDB-T-SF molecules are inserted into the aggregates of PBDB-TF, resulting in swelled polymer phases with reduced phase crystallinity (Fig. 1c). Again, due to the ππ-stacking between the polymer backbones, the polymer molecules are glued together with the formation of interpenetrating 3-D networks of polymer phases, beneficial for the hole transportation. With the formation of the polymer-crowd morphology, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is slightly increased, as revealed from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images (Fig. 5d–i). Formation of the meso-scaled polymer-crowd domains (with volume swelled as the feature after adding PBDB-T-SF) can be one reason of the decrease of charge dissociation. The feature of interpenetrating network can be morphological origin of reduced recombination loss and increased charge mobilities, particularly, the hole mobility, which results in balanced hole and electron mobilities and faster charge carrier extraction. The formation of the mesoscale morphology does not mean the destruction of the nanoscale morphology of the polymer domains. Strikingly, as demonstrated by the AFM pictures of the surface morphology (Fig. 5d–i), the fine morphology of the polymers, both PBDB-TF and PBDB-T-SF, is well maintained, which is consistent with the speculations that both polymers interact through the interactions between the differently oriented side chains and the incorporation of the donor guest (PBDB-T-SF) into the PBDB-TF domain makes the PBDB-TF domain swell up. For the Y6 molecules, the GIXRD data indicate that the ππ-stacking signals of Y6 occur at q ∼ 1.77 Å along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction (Fig. S6†) in comparable intensities, demonstrating that the face-on packing of the Y6 molecules is maintained in both the binary and ternary blends (Fig. 6).

To probe the interactions and structural order between PBDB-TF, PBDB-T-SF, and Y6 and their blends as well, we conducted the solid-state 19F MAS NMR (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic microscopy) experiments. The 1D 19F MAS NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 7. The 19F signal appears at −131 ppm (Fig. 7, black line) for the 19F sites on the fluorinated thiophene of PBDB-TF. For the 19F sites on the fluorinated and thiol-substituted thiophene of PBDB-T-SF, the 19F signal appears at −120 ppm (Fig. 7, red line). In the PBDB-T-SF:PBDB-TF binary blend with a weight ratio of 0.15:0.85 (Fig. 7, magenta line), the 19F signals of the fluorinated thiophene on PBDB-TF and the fluorinated and thiol-substituted thiophene on PBDB-T-SF remain at −120 ppm and −131 PPM, respectively. This indicates maintenance of the local environment of 19F sites on the fluorinated thiophene of PBDB-TF and on the fluorinated and thiol-substituted thiophene of PBDB-T-SF. The 19F peak from the 19F sites on the fluorinated thiophene of PBDB-TF in the PBDB-T-SF:PBDB-TF binary blend is a little broader in comparison to that in the neat PBDB-TF moiety, suggesting a slight decrease in the structural order of the fluorinated thiophene units on PBDB-TF when PBDB-T-SF is introduced to mix with PBDB-TF. The broadening of the 19F signal of the 19F sites on the fluorinated thiophene of PBDB-TF is retained in the PBDB-T-SF:PBDB-TF:Y6 (0.15:0.85:1.2) ternary blend (Fig. 7, violet line), suggesting that the structural order of the fluorinated thiophene units on PBDB-TF becomes slightly decreased in the ternary blend in comparison to that in the pristine PBDB-TF sample.

For Y6, the 19F signals are seen in the range between −115 ppm and −130 ppm, and are partially resolved, peaking around −121 ppm and −124 ppm, respectively. The signals at −121 ppm and −124 ppm are attributed to the 19F sites in different end groups of Y6, rather than the 19F sites at the ortho positions within the same end group of Y6.67 In the PBDB-TF:Y6 (1:1.2) binary blend, the 19F signals at −121 ppm and −124 ppm both displace toward a lower frequency and appear as a single band centred at −126 ppm. The narrowed distribution of the signal intensities reveals the improved structure order of Y6 molecules in the PM6:Y6 blend. In the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 (1:1.2) binary blend, the 19F signals of the fluorinated end groups of Y6 overlap with the 19F signal of the fluorinated and thiol-substituted thiophene of PBDB-T-SF, leading to a broad distribution of 19F signal intensity, ranging from −113 ppm to −131 ppm. Although the evolution of the 19F signal from the fluorinated end groups of Y6 becomes difficult, we can say that the observed 19F signal from the PBDB-T-SF binary blend is mainly contributed by the 19F sites of the fluorinated end groups of Y6 because the 19F sites on Y6 can be more than two-fold richer than the 19F sites on PBDB-T-SF in the 1:1.2 (w/w) blended PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary blend. The 19F chemical shift spectrum of the ternary blend is similar to that of the PBDB-T-SF binary blend, rather than the PBDB-TF binary blend, revealing that the introduction of PBDB-T-SF into the host PBDB-TF:Y6 binary blend can also trigger a re-arrangement for Y6 aggregates going from a PBDB-TF based type to a PBDB-T-SF based analogue.
Conclusions
In summary, we present herein an unprecedented case of ternary solar cells in which we use two polymer donors with their side chains oriented differently to form a special meso-scaled morphology, named polymer-crowd that features domain volume swelled after adding the donor guest. Due to the interpenetrating nature of the donor and acceptor phases originating from this new film-morphology, the trap-assisted monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination are both reduced; the hole mobility is largely increased and hence the charge mobilities become balanced; the charge carrier extraction is faster. As results of these, the device fill-factor is largely improved and the short-circuit current-density is increased because the charge collection becomes more efficient. Finally, an impressive 16.4% efficiency is obtained in the ternary solar cell. This interesting result tells us that besides the well-known phase-separated nanoscale film-morphology, some kinds of mesoscale morphology such as the swollen polymer-crowd observed herein with well interpenetrating networks of the donor and acceptor phases may also be beneficial for the charge dissociation, transport, and collection of charge carriers for realization of high-efficiency organic solar cells.
