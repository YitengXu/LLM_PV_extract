    , Accepted 27th December 2016First published on 4th January 2017AbstractPyrene derivatives show immense potential as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Therefore, this work focuses on the impact of π-spacers on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of pyrene based D–π–A dyes, since the insertion of π-spacers is one of the doable strategies to improve the light harvesting properties of the dye. In this respect, three new pyrene based D–π–A dyes have been synthesized and characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and elemental analyses and EI-MS spectrometry. The selected π-spacers are benzene, thiophene and furan. Compared with a benzene spacer, the introduction of a heterocyclic ring spacer reduces the band gap of the dye and brings about the broadening of the absorption spectra to the longer wavelength region through intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT). Combined experimental and theoretical studies were performed to investigate the ICT process involved in the pyrene derivatives. The profound solvatochromism with increased nonradiative rate constants (knr) has been construed in terms of ICT from the pyrene core to rhodanine-3-acetic acid via conjugated π-spacers. Electrochemical data also reveal that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are fine-tuned by incorporating different π-spacers between pyrene and rhodanine-3-acetic acid. On the basis of the optimized DSC test conditions, the best performance was found for PBRA, in which a benzene group is the conjugated π-spacer. The divergence in the photovoltaic behaviors of these dyes was further explicated by femtosecond fluorescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
Since the pioneering report1 by Grätzel and O'Reagen in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost of production, light weight, colour, flexibility, eco-friendliness, facile cell fabrication and high incident solar light to electricity conversion efficiency. DSCs are composed of three major components: a dye, a semiconductor and a redox-shuttle to return the electrons to the oxidized dye. Among them, the dye molecule is responsible for light harvesting, excitation and charge separation followed by injection of the excited photoelectron into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, which thus plays an imperative role in the device performance. Initially, ruthenium complexes were designed to work as sensitizers in a device and achieved a conversion efficiency of ∼11% under air mass (AM) 1.5 illumination.1–5 After a few decades of efforts, porphyrin-based DSCs have been developed and they achieved an increased efficiency of 13%, which exceeds that of ruthenium complex based DSCs.6,7 Although devices based on porphyrins and ruthenium complexes have exhibited remarkably superior efficiency, the major drawbacks of these dyes are the limited resources, difficulty in the synthetic procedures, hefty purification steps, low yield and environmental risks. Therefore, metal-free organic dyes were considered due to several advantages, such as low cost, facile molecular design/synthesis, larger molar extinction coefficients and easy-to-tune photophysical and redox properties.
The general design of an organic sensitizer consists of a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) framework that can efficiently facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the ground state to the excited state, thereby broadening the molecular absorption spectrum and enhancing the charge carrier mobility.8 In order to achieve the above mentioned strategy, a lot of efforts have been devoted to developing organic dyes such as coumarin, squaraine, indoline, phenothiazine, triphenylamine, fluorene, carbazole and tetrahydroquinoline and they exhibited good solar cell performance.9–19 In 2014, Hanaya et al. reported a novel metal-free alkoxysilyl carbazole as a sensitizing dye,20 which exhibited a light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of over 12%. Later, they made considerable progress in metal free organic dye sensitizers and an impressively high efficiency (14%) was achieved.21,22 Among the D–π–A frameworks reported so far, triphenylamine and cyanoacrylic acid were found to be excellent donor and acceptor units.23,24 The rhodanine-3-acetic acid was also identified as an admirable acceptor unit for D–π–A type dye systems.25
The choice of π-bridging is one of the key factors in obtaining efficient D–π–A dyes. For instance, Arakawa et al. designed coumarin dyes by introducing thiophene moieties into the methine chain of NKX-2311 dye26 rather than by extending the methine unit. This approach enhanced the solar cell performance remarkably up to 7.7%. Lin et al. studied the conjugated linker (benzene, thiophene and furan) effects on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of phenothiazine–triphenylamine based organic dyes.27 Among the dyes investigated, the one with a furan linker showed the best solar cell performance (η = 6.79%). Lu et al. also reported similar observations to those made by Lin et al. that furan and thiophene ring systems in the D–π–A type dye can act as excellent linkers compared to the benzene ring.28 These results clearly indicate that replacing the olefin bridge by aromatic π-bridges will have a promising impact on the overall performance of the device. Previously, we reported a series of pyrene derivatives with an olefin spacer for dye sensitized solar cells.29 The maximum power conversion efficiency of the pyrene dye was 0.84%. From the above observation, we have concluded that to achieve a better excited state and photovoltaic properties of pyrene, an olefinic spacer is not a better choice. To an extent this rationale is correct, which also emphasizes the need to study in detail the effects of rigid π-spacers on the photophysical and photovoltaic properties of pyrene derivatives for solar cell applications. To address the above challenges, we have meticulously engineered the pyrene derivatives (Scheme 1) by incorporation of rigid π-spacers such as benzene, thiophene and furan. We anticipate that the incorporation of rigid π-spacers into the dye core will have desirable effects on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the pyrene derivatives, which in turn will enhance the power conversion efficiency.

Experimental section
Materials
Pyrene-1-boronic acid, 4-bromobenzaldehyde, 5-bromo-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde, 5-bromo-2-furancarboxaldehyde and rhodanine-3-acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as such. Glacial acetic acid and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL), India, and solvents of spectrometric grade were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated.
Instrumentation
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a BRUKER spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C and collected at ambient probe temperature with spectra calibrated to either an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard or to a residual protio solvent. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were collected on a Thermo Finnigan (San Jose, CA, USA) LCQTM Advantage MAX quadrupole ion trap instrument, by infusing samples directly into the source at 20 μL min−1 using a syringe pump, and elemental analyses were performed on a EuroVector-EuroEA3000 CHNS-O analyzer.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes in the solution state were measured using a CARY 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer, whereas the electronic absorption spectra of the dye/TiO2 films were recorded with an Agilent 8453 UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a FluoroMax-4P spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Time resolved picosecond fluorescence decays were obtained using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R3809U) as a detector and a femtosecond laser as an excitation source. The second harmonic (400 nm) output from the mode-locked femtosecond laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) was used as the excitation source. The instrument response function for the TCSPC system is ∼50 ps. The data analysis was carried out using the software provided by IBH (DAS-6), which is based on the deconvolution technique using nonlinear least-squares methods. Femtosecond fluorescence decays were collected using the fluorescence up-conversion technique. In our femtosecond up-conversion setup (FOG 100, CDP, Russia) the sample was excited using the second harmonic (400 nm) of a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics). The fundamental beam (800 nm) was frequency doubled in a nonlinear crystal (1 mm BBO, θ = 25°, φ = 90°) and used for the excitation. The sample was placed inside a 1 mm-thick rotating quartz cell. The fluorescence emitted from the sample was up-converted in a nonlinear crystal (0.5 mm BBO, θ = 38°, φ = 90°) using the fundamental beam as a gate pulse. The upconverted light is dispersed in a monochromator and detected using photon counting electronics. The instrument response function of the apparatus is 300 fs. The femtosecond fluorescence decays were fitted using a Gaussian shape for the excitation pulse.
Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI620B electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc.) in deaerated THF containing 0.10 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte at room temperature. A conventional three-electrode cell was used with a glassy carbon working electrode (surface area of 0.30 mm2), a platinum wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode. The platinum working electrode was routinely polished with BAS polishing alumina suspension and rinsed with acetone and acetonitrile before use. The measured potentials were recorded with respect to an Ag/Ag+ (0.010 M) reference electrode. All potentials (vs. Ag/Ag+) were converted to values vs. SCE by adding 0.2 V. A TG/DTA 6200 (SEIKO) thermal analyzer was used to perform thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a temperature range of 33−700 °C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1) under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Quantum yield measurements
The fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF) of the dyes was calculated by using the following equation: ϕF = (AR/AS)(IS/IR)(ηS/ηR)2ϕR(1)where the subscripts S and R refer to the samples and the reference, respectively. A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, I is the integrated emission area, and η is the solvent refractive index. Coumarin-153 (ϕF = 0.58) was used as a standard for PBRA and fluorescein (ϕF = 0.9) was used as a standard for PTRA and PFRA.
Computational methods
The Gaussian 09 suite of programs were employed in acquiring all the computational results.30 Initially, seven different functionals31–36 such as B3LYP, Cam-B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, PBE, PBE0, and ωB97x-D3 were utilized for computing the absorption spectra of the three dye molecules under investigation. Among the seven different functionals, the hybrid exchange–correlation functional using the Coulomb-attenuating CAM-B3LYP functional with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set was found to predict the absorption spectral values closer to the experimental values. Therefore, the ground state geometries of the pyrene derivatives were optimized by using density functional theory (DFT)37 at a long-range corrected version of B3LYP using the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP) in combination with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set.38 Similarly, the ground state absorption behaviours, vertical excitation energies and various other properties were studied by subjecting the chosen molecules to time dependent-density functional theory39 using the same CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of calculations. In order to study the solvent effects in DFT and TDDFT methods, PCM is known to be the most accurate model. Hence, the self-consistent reaction field–polarisable continuum model (SCRF-PCM)40 was used to examine the solvent effect. In particular, the effects of the THF solvent on the calculated absorption properties of the species were studied. To ensure that all the converged geometries were at energy minima, frequency calculations were computed at each stationary point using the same level and basis set mentioned above.
Cell assembly and characterization
The detailed procedure for making photoanodes is described in our earlier report.29 Briefly, TiO2 paste was coated on TiCl4 pre-treated FTO plates by the doctor blade technique. Then, the plates were sintered in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the binder and solvent and to obtain an electrically-connected network of TiO2 films. After the sintering process, when the temperature of the plate decreased to 80 °C, the plate was immersed in the dye solution in MeOH for 24 h. Excess non-adsorbed dyes were washed with anhydrous MeOH. The area of the prepared photoanode is 0.25 cm2. The platinum catalyst counter electrode was prepared by depositing H2PtCl6·6H2O solution (0.005 M in isopropanol) onto FTO glass and then sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. Finally, the DSC device was fabricated by placing the Pt cathode on top of the photoanode and tightly clipping them together. Then, liquid electrolyte 0.05 M I2/0.5 M LiI/0.5 M 4-tertbutyl pyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile was injected in between the two electrodes. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSCs were measured under 85 mW cm−2 light illumination by using an AUTOLAB12/FRA2 electrochemical analyzer.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
In D–π–A structured dyes, π-spacers play a key role in intramolecular charge transfer as a consequence of their effective light absorption, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. Hence, we have designed a D–π–A dye system which comprises pyrene as an electron donor, rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an electron acceptor and homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic ring systems such as benzene, furan and thiophene as π-spacers. The main objective of inserting a different aromatic ring system as a π-spacer is to improve the charge transfer character of the dye, since benzene, thiophene and furan can provide effective conjugation and lower the energy of charge-transfer transition due to the smaller resonance energy (furan, 16 kcal mol−1; thiophene, 29 kcal mol−1; benzene, 36 kcal mol−1).41 The targeted dyes have been synthesized according to classical reactions, and detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† For the synthesis of PBRA, PTRA and PFRA dyes, the aldehyde precursors were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling method (Scheme 1). The obtained aldehydes undergo Knoevenagel condensation with rhodanine-3-acetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate to yield the targeted dyes. The desired final products were obtained with good yields and well characterized using FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis (Fig. S1–S17, ESI†). Further, the meticulously tailored pyrene derivatives are employed in studying the effect of π-spacers on the HOMO/LUMO energy gap, photophysical and electrochemical properties and, additionally, photovoltaic performances.
DFT studies on molecular geometry and FMO analysis
The accuracy of the computed results always relies on the choice of the best functional in comparison with the experimental results. In this particular work, we have chosen seven different DFT functionals to perform the TDDFT calculations. Table 1 lists the computed absorption maximum (λmax) values along with experimental absorption maxima. Among the seven different functionals, the CAM-B3LYP functional is found to predict the λmax closer to the experimental λmax values. Therefore, all the calculations were performed at CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G** and the results are discussed. The present study is intended to study the effect of different spacers (benzene, thiophene and furan) on the optoelectronic properties. In particular, how the planarity of the entire molecule is affected by different spacers is discussed. The optimized geometries of the three dyes are given in Fig. 1. In PBRA, the benzene ring deviates from the plane of the pyrene core by −50.65° in its ground state. In the case of PTRA and PFRA, the deviation of the thiophene and furan rings from the planarity of the pyrene core is reduced gradually to 44.51° and 21.03°, respectively. This clearly indicates that the introduction of spacers like furan in between pyrene and rhodanine-3-acetic acid enhances the planarity of the entire molecule, and is therefore expected to increase the delocalization of electrons throughout the molecule. This will ultimately enhance the effective charge transfer process throughout the molecule. In order to ascertain this, we aimed to perform the frontier molecular orbital analysis through which one can easily understand the nature of electronic excitation. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on this figure, the dye molecules were found to exhibit effective intra-molecular charge transfer from the donor unit to the acceptor unit though the spacer. The HOMO and the LUMO of less planar PBRA were found to possess the electron density on the donor and acceptor units, respectively, whereas the electron density of PFRA is depleted on the entire molecule which leads to effective delocalization throughout the molecule. Investigating the respective FMO of the dyes (Fig. 2) clearly shows that the HOMO of the lowest energy transition is largely found in the pyrene unit and the LUMO is in rhodanine and spacer units. As we discussed earlier, slight twisting of the molecular geometry from the planarity in PBRA causes discrete intra-molecular charge transfer processes. But in the case of PFRA and PTRA dyes, it seems to have effective charge delocalization throughout the molecules due to a near planar geometry. The investigation of HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 orbitals shows that higher energy transitions become more π → π*. But there is no significant electron density on the anchoring group. This hampers the effective electronic coupling with the semiconductor surface. Further, to compare the effectiveness of the ICT nature within the pyrene derivatives, the Mulliken population analysis42 on the HOMO and LUMO levels of the three dye molecules is carried out (Fig. S18, ESI†). The relative population of donor units (pyrene) at the HOMO level in the PBRA molecule is found to have a maximum value of 90% compared to the other two dyes (72% and 69% in PTRA and PFRA respectively). Similarly, the relative population of acceptor units of PBRA at the LUMO level is associated with the acceptor part of the PBRA. But in the other two dyes, there is an electronic population on the donor part also at the LUMO level. Both FMO and Mulliken population analyses clearly showed that the near-planar structure of PFRA is found to possess effective charge delocalization compared to the other dyes.

Photophysics in solution
The light harvesting properties of the pyrene derivatives were assessed using their absorption spectra and are shown in Fig. 3a. All the derivatives exhibit two major absorption bands around 300–360 and 360–560 nm. Generally, the organic dyes showed two main absorption bands: intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption and π → π* absorption bands.43 Based on this, the short wavelength bands were assigned to π → π* transitions and the longer wavelength bands were assigned to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions. Interestingly, the intensity of the ICT absorption band was higher than that of the π → π* transitions, which is an essential criterion to harvest the visible light efficiently. The absorption maxima (λmax) of PBRA, PTRA and PFRA were 394, 444 and 468 nm respectively. The λmax values of PTRA and PFRA are red-shifted by 50 nm and 74 nm, respectively, compared with that of PBRA. This is due to the better delocalization of electrons over the whole molecule when thiophene or furan was used as the spacer rather than benzene. The molar extinction coefficients at λmax for PBRA, PTRA and PFRA are 3.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1, 4.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 4.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which are much greater than that of the N719 dye (1.47 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 535 nm).44 Among the pyrene derivatives, PFRA absorbs at longer wavelengths with a relatively higher molar extinction coefficient, which is favorable for the better performance of DSCs, as more photons could be harvested.
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption, (b) emission and (c) time resolved fluorescence of the pyrene derivatives in THF. For steady state fluorescence studies, the dyes were excited at their absorption maxima. For time resolved fluorescence studies, the excitation wavelength is 400 nm. 
Further, we computed the absorption spectra of the pyrene derivatives at CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G** under the THF continuum. Here, we considered only the most intense ICT bands rather than the less intense π → π* transitions. The absorption spectra of the lowest energy ICT bands of the three dyes were collected and are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). In all the cases, the lowest energy transition mainly originates from the excitation of electrons from the HOMO to the LUMO. In PBRA, the lowest energy absorption band was observed at 392 nm with an oscillator strength of 1.407. Upon changing the spacer from benzene to thiophene and furan, there is a large bathochromic shift in the ICT band. The order of bathochromic shift is as follows: PBRA < PTRA < PFRA. This trend is consistent with the experimentally observed trend. Among the three dyes, PFRA is found to have the most intense and longest wavelength of 445 nm. This is presumably due to the presence of the furan ring in PFRA which makes the entire molecule have a near planar structure, which leads to low energy transition, thereby increasing the intensity.
Overall, absorption spectral studies illustrate that the furan spacer is much better than the benzene spacer in terms of improving the spectral coverage in the visible light range due to its lower stabilization energy, which ensures more efficient electronic communication between the pyrene donor and the rhodanine-3-acetic acid acceptor.

Fig. 3b presents the emission spectra of the pyrene derivatives in THF measured upon exciting the middle red region of the corresponding absorption. The emission spectra were measured in dilute solution in order to avoid the re-absorption, excimer and concentration effects. The maximum emission wavelengths (λemi) of PBRA, PTRA and PFRA are 539, 559 and 574 nm, respectively. The emission of the pyrene derivatives is very weak and they exhibited very low quantum yields of 0.05 (PBRA), 0.03 (PTRA) and 0.01 (PFRA) respectively. A weak emission of the pyrene derivatives is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). It was previously reported that the ICT is a competitive relaxation process of the singlet excited state and typically reduces the emission.45 The dyes are weakly emissive in nature, and it is very difficult to examine the effect of π-spacers on the excited state using steady state fluorescence studies. Hence, a time correlated single photon counting technique is adopted to study the effect of π-spacers on the excited state of the pyrene derivatives. Fig. 3c displays the fluorescence decays of the pyrene derivatives in THF, which were measured upon excitation at 400 nm. The obtained fluorescence decays were fitted with a single exponential function [F(t) = Aexp (−t/τ)] and the fitted values are given in Table 2. The lifetimes of the pyrene derivatives are in the order: PBRA (1.43 ns) > PTRA (0.47 ns) > PFRA (0.18 ns). In order to achieve an efficient electron injection into the TiO2, the lifetime of the dyes should be very long. Hence, PBRA is expected to inject the electron with long lived amplitude. Although PTRA and PFRA have good light harvesting properties, their excited state lifetimes are shorter; hence a long lived amplitude of electron injection from these dyes cannot be expected.46

Solvatochromic analysis
Generally, D–π–A dyes often exhibit solvatochromism, which is based on the interaction between solvent molecules and the dye.47 Based on the polarity of the solvent used, the solvatochromic changes of these pyrene derivatives were studied. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the pyrene derivatives in various solvents are shown in Fig. S19 and S20 (ESI†). The absorption spectra of these dyes in different solvents remained unaffected by increasing the solvent polarity, which indicates that the interaction of dyes with solvents in the ground state is less significant. The emissive characteristics of these dyes are highly sensitive to the solvent polarity, exhibiting generally positive solvatochromism. The influence of solvent polarity on the optical properties of the pyrene derivatives can be studied using the Lippert–Mataga equation: Δν = νabs − νemi = 2(μe − μg)2Δf/hca3 + C; this equation describes the interaction between the solvent and the dipole moment of the dye.48 In this equation, μg and μe are the dipole moments in the ground and excited states, respectively, h is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, a is the radius of the dye and Δν is Stokes shift, which is calculated from the difference between absorption and emission maxima obtained from the corrected spectra on the wavenumber scale. Δf is called the orientation polarizability, which can be expressed as (ε − 1)/(2ε + 1) − (n2 − 1)/(2n2 + 1), where ε and n are the dielectric constant and refractive index of the solvent, respectively. The Lippert–Mataga plots of the pyrene derivatives are depicted in Fig. 4. It can be found that the plot of Δν against Δf has a positive correlation and is linear with the correlation coefficient R = 0.91. The changes in dipole moment (Δμ = μe − μg) for all the dyes are calculated from the slopes of the linear plots and are listed in Table 2. The estimated Δμ values are more positive and suggestive of a large dipole moment for the molecules in the excited state than the ground state, which is facilitated by the π-bridge between donor and acceptor moieties. Overall, the photophysical studies demonstrate that the decrement in fluorescence lifetime values, quantum yields, radiative rate constants (kr) and profound solvatochromism with enhanced nonradiative rate constants (knr) are interpreted in terms of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the pyrene core to rhodanine-3-acetic acid via extended π-spacers.

Electrochemical studies
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from excited dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2, and from the (I3/I)− redox couple to the oxidized dye molecule, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) of the pyrene derivatives was recorded in THF medium (Fig. S21, ESI†), and the corresponding values are presented in Table 2. The ground state oxidation potentials of PBRA, PTRA and PFRA are +1.10, +1.04 and +0.96 V vs. NHE, respectively. It is clear that π-spacers have a significant effect on the oxidation potential of the pyrene derivatives. Moreover, the oxidation potentials are amply higher in energy than the redox potential of iodide/triiodide (+0.45 V vs. NHE), ensuring sufficient driving force for dye regeneration. On the other hand, the calculated excited state oxidation potentials are placed sufficiently above the TiO2 conduction band edge (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring electron injection from the excited dyes into the conduction band of TiO2. Scheme S1 (ESI†) presents an energy-level diagram of the pyrene derivatives, indicating that both processes (regeneration and electron injection) are energetically favourable.
In addition, driving forces for electron injection (ΔGinj) from the dye excited state to the CB of TiO2, dye regeneration (ΔGreg) from the redox (I3/I)− shuttle (0.4 vs. NHE) and electron recombination (ΔGrec) from the CB of TiO2 to the dye radical cation (Eox) are determined from the following equations and the values are shown in Table 2. ΔGinj = Eox* − ECB(2) ΔGreg = E(I3/I−) − Eox(3) ΔGrec = ECB − Eox(4) The obtained ΔG values are negative, which indicates that all of the processes are thermodynamically feasible and, most importantly, electron injection and regeneration are the dominant processes compared to recombination for these dyes.
Thermal stability
The better thermal stability of the dye is an important factor for the lifetime of the solar cells. Hence, the thermal properties of the pyrene derivatives were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The pyrene derivatives exhibited good thermal stability and the apparent decomposition temperatures of these derivatives are above 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, where over 95% of their mass was retained, as shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†).
TiO2 sensitization
In order to understand the effect of π-spacers on the light harvesting properties of the pyrene derivatives on the TiO2 surface, 4 μm thickness TiO2 films were prepared from a commercially available TiO2 paste (Solaronix SA, Ti-Nanoxide HT/SC series) and they were sensitized in 0.5 mM of pyrene derivatives in methanol at room temperature for 1 h. The absorption spectra of the dyes anchored onto TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 5. Like the solution spectra, the absorption spectra of the pyrene derivatives on the TiO2 surface follows a similar trend: PBRA < PTRA < PFRA. The absorption spectra of the dyes became broadened after adsorption on the TiO2 surface, which should favor the light harvesting of the solar cells and thus increase the photocurrent response region, leading to the increase of JSC.49
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of the pyrene derivatives on TiO2 films. 
Moreover, the absorption maxima of PTRA and PFRA on the TiO2 surface are not altered compared to the solution spectra, which clearly indicate that there is no aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 surface. However, hypsochromic shift is observed for the PBRA/TiO2 film when compared with that in solution, which indicates that the H-aggregation occurs as PBRA on TiO2. The onset spectra of PTRA/TiO2 and PFRA/TiO2 are at 565 and 600 nm, respectively, which clearly indicates that the incorporation of heterocyclic rings as π-bridges improves the light absorptivity of dyes on TiO2 when compared with the benzene π-bridge, which may be beneficial for photon harvesting and hence the photovoltaic performance.
In addition, loading of the pyrene derivatives on the TiO2 surface depends on the concentration of the dye, as is evident from the UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†). The absorption of the sensitized films is increased gradually with the dye bath concentration, reaching saturation at a concentration of about 10–15 × 10−5 M. The equilibrium binding was well described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model.50 The dye coverage (Γ) of the film was obtained from the absorption data of the films (Fig. S23, ESI†) using the formula: A = 1000εΓ, where A is the absorbance, ε is the molar extinction coefficient (M−1 cm−1) and Γ (mol cm−2) the dye coverage on the film. Accordingly, the Langmuir-type isotherm can be expressed as Γ = ΓmaxK[Dye]/K[Dye], where K is the binding constant (M−1), Γmax the maximum dye load on TiO2 and [Dye] is the concentration of the pyrene derivatives. The plot of the concentration of dyes and dye load is shown in Fig. 6. The maximum dye load on TiO2 (Γmax) was determined to be 1.2 × 10−11 mol cm−2 (PBRA), 1.4 × 10−11 mol cm−2 (PTRA) and 1.5 × 10−11 mol cm−2 (PFRA) and the binding constant (K) was determined to be 7.4 × 104 M−1 (PBRA), 6.5 × 104 M−1 (PTRA) and 5.7 × 104 M−1 (PFRA). The calculated binding constant values were in fair agreement with the literature values and it suggests the formation of a dye monolayer at the surface of TiO2, as is usually assumed in dye-sensitized solar cells.51

Photovoltaic performance
The overall computational and spectroscopic results have clearly designated that the synthesized pyrene derivatives can be used for dye sensitized solar cell applications. The typical current–voltage characteristics of PBRA, PTRA and PFRA sensitized TiO2 films using I−/I3− electrolyte are measured under standard AM 1.5G conditions (85 mW cm−2). The corresponding J–V characteristics of the cells are shown in Fig. 7a and photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3.

The PBRA dye gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 3.28 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.522 V and a fill factor of 0.52, corresponding to an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.05%. This result clearly indicates that there is an impact of rigid π-spacers. For instance, previously, we reported that the PCE of PRA (without any rigid π-spacer)29 dye is 0.23%. Inserting a benzene π-spacer in place of the olefin spacer as in PRA dye results in an impressive improvement in the PCE of the PBRA dye. Hence, we expect higher PCE of thiophene and furan connected pyrene derivatives, since compared with the benzenoid moiety, the thiophene and furan can provide more effective charge separation. In contrast, under the same conditions, the PTRA and PFRA dyes exhibit a lower PCE of 0.76% and 0.16%, respectively, although these dyes have higher light harvesting in the longer wavelength region compared to the PBRA (cf. above). However, upon excitation of the pyrene derivatives, the trend of electron migration from the pyrene core to rhodanine-3-acetic acid is as follows: PFRA > PTRA > PBRA. Hence, faster electron injection into the TiO2 as well as faster recombination is observed for these dyes. It is also noted here that the electron injection does not take place through the anchoring group and it occurs via through space.29,52 In order to prove our hypothesis (i.e., a very low open circuit voltage of PFRA, which was ascribed to fast electron recombination), we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As is well known, EIS is a useful method for illustrating the important interfacial charge transfer and carrier transportation processes in DSCs.53 The Nyquist plot and the Bode plot are shown in Fig. 7b and c. The diameter of the semicircle increased in the order of PBRA > PTRA > PFRA, which indicates the photoelectron generation and transport increases in the order of PFRA < PTRA < PBRA, which was consistent with the variation in VOC. In addition, the electron lifetime could be calculated from the angular frequency (ωmin) at the mid-frequency peak in Bode phase plots (Fig. 7c) using the following equation τ = 1/2πf, in which f is the corresponding peak frequency. The calculated electron lifetime values are presented in Table 3. In general, a longer electron lifetime corresponds to the slow recombination and hence a larger value of VOC.54 The electron lifetime follows the trend of PBRA > PTRA > PFRA. The higher electron lifetime of PBRA is due to efficient suppression of the back reaction, which is reflected in the improvement of the VOC. At the same time, the lower lifetime of PFRA indicates the more facile nature of back reaction. Thus, EIS measurements support our hypothesis.
Femtosecond fluorescence decay measurements
Further, in order to rationalize the lower performance of PFRA, we have employed the fluorescence upconversion spectroscopic technique, since this technique55 is most precious for estimating the rate of the electron transfer (ET) process and determining the relationship between ET dynamics and solar cell performance. The fluorescence decay traces of the pyrene derivatives on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles are monitored at their emission maximum. Note that the fluorescence decay measurements were performed with low dye coverage samples and the influence of molecular aggregation is negligible.
It can be noticed from Fig. 8 that the fluorescence decay of PFRA is quite fast on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles compared with PTRA and PBRA. This clearly unveils that the electron injection process is much faster in the PFRA/TiO2 system. The fluorescence decay traces (F(t)) of the pyrene derivatives on TiO2 are fitted with a bi-exponential decay function: [F(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)](5)where A1 and A2 are amplitudes and τ1 and τ2 are the corresponding lifetimes. Average electron injection (τav) time constants were determined using the following equation: (6)The obtained average lifetimes are shown in Table 4. All the dyes exhibited ultrafast (τ1) and slow (τ2) components. The ultrafast component, τ1, is attributed to the electron injection that proceeds through a nonrelaxed ICT state of dyes56 on TiO2, whereas the sufficiently slower component resulted from the relaxed ICT state.57

These data clearly indicate that the PFRA injects electrons very fast, whereas PBRA injects in a slow manner. For an efficient device, electron injection should be very fast; although PFRA obeys this criterion, the recombination is also very fast for PFRA as evidenced from electrochemical impedance measurements. This is the main reason for the lower performance of PFRA. The slow electron injection and slow recombination processes involved in PBRA resulted in the improved power conversion efficiency. A similar type of observation has been reported for porphyrin based devices, i.e., slow electron injection and slow electron cation recombination are responsible for the superior solar cell performance.58
Conclusion
A series of pyrene derivatives containing benzene, thiophene and furan moieties as π-spacers were designed and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied for dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) applications. It was found that the introduction of furan and thiophene π-spacers increases the spectral response range compared with the benzene π-spacer. As a consequence, solar cells based on dyes with furan and thiophene spacers should exhibit higher power conversion efficiency than benzene. In contrast, pyrene with the benzene spacer exhibited improved power conversion efficiency. This is due to the fact that the benzene π-spacer has a slow electron injection and slow recombination rate compared with the heterocyclic π-spacers. As demonstrated, it is vital to have a judicious design on π-spacer modification for high-performance of pyrene based D–π–A sensitizers. Work is in progress to develop efficient pyrene based sensitizers.
