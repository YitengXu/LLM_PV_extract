    , Accepted 24th October 2013First published on 25th October 2013AbstractThe judicious choice of conjugated π-linkers is a critical strategy towards the energy-level engineering of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) sensitizers. Given that the vinyl bond on π-bridge thiophene segment can deteriorate its intrinsic photo-stability, we systematically study three D–D–π–A indoline dyes C-CA, WBS-1T and WBS-1F with different conjugated π-linkers (vinylthiophene, thiophene and furan) for high efficiency, long-term stable dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared with the vinylthiophene unit in C-CA, the conjugated π-linker of the thiophene or furan group in WBS-1T and WBS-1F can improve the solar cell performance with a great enhancement in the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC). As an overall result of the upshift of the TiO2 conduction band (CB) edge and the slow charge recombination, the VOC values are in the order WBS-1F (779 mV) > WBS-1T (756 mV) > C-CA (670 mV). Moreover, the CB edge shift of TiO2 is the major contribution to the large difference in VOC, accounting for 80% of the enhancement. Both the stepped light-induced transient measurements (SLIT) and the molecular dipole simulation are accounted for well by the observed superior photovoltage upon removal of the vinyl group in the conjugated π-linker. The higher molecular dipole moments can bring forth a more effective charge separation between donor and acceptor units, resulting in a remarkable increase in VOC. Using a liquid electrolyte, WBS-1F shows an impressively high efficiency of 9.49% with a high photovoltage of 779 mV. Its efficiency reaches 8.03% with ionic-liquid electrolyte while it reduces to 7.60% after a 1000 h aging test. Our work has shown that for D–π–A organic dyes, the vinyl unit in the conjugated π-linker is detrimental to the molecular dipole moment, the upshift of TiO2 CB edge, and the suppression of charge recombination, as well as the photo-stability.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as next generation photovoltaic devices have attracted increasing scientific interest because of their promising potential to achieve high solar-to-electricity transformation at a low cost, with resource-abundant and lower energy-intensive materials as well as simple manufacture technologies.1 As the key component of DSSCs, organic metal-free donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) sensitizers have been extensively exploited for their environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and more importantly, the flexibility of molecular design with easily tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties.2 With respect to the common triphenylamine donor, the indoline group has shown excellent performance due to its strong electron-donating ability,3 such as the well-known D series of sensitizers (D102, D149 and D205) developed by Uchida et al.3a–c
With our continuous interest in indoline sensitizers, we are also devoted to develop novel indoline dyes with high efficiency and convenient synthesis for practical applications.4 Previously, a carbazole modified indoline dye (C-CA, Scheme 1) was developed as an additional donor for a D–D–π–A system.4d Incorporation of the strong auxiliary electron-donating carbazole unit can successfully broaden the photoresponse area to the NIR region, obtaining a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.53 mA cm−2. It is suggested that the additional carbazole-modified indoline unit can further improve the donor capability. However, its open-circuit voltage (VOC) was only 649–670 mV, much lower than what we estimate from the difference between the iodine redox potential (Eredox) and the TiO2 conduction band (ECB) without considering the movement effect of the band edge (900 mV). Obviously, there is still much room for an increase of VOC. Meanwhile, with the vinyl group in the π-linker, the sensitizer C-CA shows poor stability in the aging test. In this respect, it is necessary to perform molecular engineering with the elaborate option of a conjugated π-linker for the enhancement of both VOC and the photo-stability.5
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes and chemical structures of dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F, and reference dye C-CA: (i) 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid (or 5-formyl-2-furanboronic acid), 1,4-dioxane, Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3; (ii) cyanoacetic acid, CH3CN, piperidine. 
Herein, we present two new indoline dyes also based on the D–D–π–A system (WBS-1T and WBS-1F, Scheme 1), using a thiophene or furan group as the π-linker segment instead of a vinylthiophene group. On account of removing the flexible vinyl group from the backbone, dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F present higher molecular dipole moments, resulting in more effective charge separation between the donor and acceptor units in order to upshift the TiO2 conduction band (CB) edge, which was the major contribution to the increase of VOC. As demonstrated, the optimization of the π-linker segment with a thiophene or furan group can significantly affect the photovoltaic performance, especially for VOC, which is systematically analyzed by joint photophysical, electrical and theoretical studies. As an overall result of the TiO2 CB edge upshift and the slow charge recombination, the VOC values are in the order WBS-1F (779 mV) > WBS-1T (756 mV) > C-CA (670 mV). The CB edge shift of TiO2 is the major contribution to the large difference in VOC, accounting for 80% of the enhancement. Impressively, using liquid electrolyte, WBS-1F shows a promising efficiency of 9.49% with a high photovoltage of 779 mV. When applied in ionic-liquid electrolyte DSSCs, the efficiency reaches 8.03% while it reduces to 7.60% after a 1000 h aging test. Here the molecular tailoring of the conjugated π-linker in D–D–π–A indoline dyes paves the way to realize long-term stable and high efficiency sensitizers with high photovoltage.

HR-MS (FAB+, m/z): [M+] calcd for C36H33N3O3, 555.2522; found, 555.2524.

2.3 Photophysical and electrochemical measurements
UV-visible spectra were determined with a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on Hitachi F-4600 spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms were measured on a CHI660B electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments) using a normal three-electrode cell with a dye-loaded TiO2 electrode as the working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in saturated KCl solution, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphoric was used as the supporting electrolyte. After the measurement, ferrocene was added as the internal reference for calibration.
2.4 Fabrication and measurement of solar cells
Two kinds of TiO2 electrodes were used in this work: 10 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a 4 μm scattering layer were used in the preparation of liquid DSSCs. 6 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a 4 μm scattering layer were used in preparation of ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs. 4 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were used in the SLIT measurements. All these TiO2 electrodes were prepared and modified following a previously reported procedure.6 The thickness of the TiO2 film was measured by a surface profiler (Dektak Co., Ltd, Model DAKTAK II). The dye-loaded electrodes were prepared by dipping TiO2 electrodes (20 mm × 30 mm) into 0.3 mM dye solution (CHCl3–C2H5OH = 2/1, v/v) with 20 mM DCA for 8 h. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min. In this work, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidiazolium iodide, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was used as the liquid electrolyte. The ionic liquid electrolyte consisted of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide/1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide/I2/N-butylbenzimidazole/TBP/GuSCN (20/20/3/4/3/4, w/w) which was slightly modified from the famous ionic liquid electrolyte Z952.7 Although the ionic liquid electrolyte possesses a higher viscosity and a lower diffusion coefficient, the use of a thinner TiO2 electrode can overcome this defect to a considerable extent. Thus, in the measurements of the ionic liquid DSSCs, 6 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a 4 μm scattering layer were used instead of 10 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a 4 μm scattering layer. The concentration of the co-adsorption material DCA was reduced to 10 mM at the same time.
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (OTENTO-SUN II, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference silicon cell (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a monochromator (M10-T, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The intensity of monochromic light was calibrated by a reference silicon cell (S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). Aging tests were performed in a glove box to prevent the effect of H2O. A 300 W xenon lamp (MAX-303, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd) equipped with a 422 nm cut-off filter was adjusted to be 100 mW cm−2 and used as the light source for the 1000 h aging test. Five samples were fabricated and tested for all measurements in this work. Median values were selected to be shown in this paper.
The electron lifetime and electron density in the complete DSSCs were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements (SLIT) of the photocurrent and voltage using a DSSC evaluation system PSL-100 (EKO Co. Ltd.).8 A laser (λ = 660 nm) was used as the light source. The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity which was controlled by adjusting its voltage. The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. Through varying the laser intensity, the lifetime could be estimated over a range of open-circuit voltages by fitting a decay of the photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τ).8 The electron density measurements were performed as follows: the DSSC was illuminated for 5 s while a bias voltage was applied to make the cell open-circuit, then the laser was shut down simultaneously, and the cell was switched from open to short circuit. The resulting current was measured over 25 s and then the electron density could be calculated through integrating the electric charge. All experiments were conducted at room temperature.
2.5 Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculation analysis was performed by hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) with the 6-31G* basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 03 program.9 The z-axis extends out of the plane of the page and the TiO2 surface plane is parallel to the y- and z-axes. Considering their bidentate binding mode, the dye molecules are positioned in such a way that the C2 axis of the carboxylate is parallel to the x-axis. Therefore, their orientations after anchoring to the TiO2 are simulated. The components of the dipoles parallel to the z-axis are fixed at zero.
3 Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of the dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F were straightforward as shown in Scheme 1. The starting indoline intermediate 1 was synthesized according to the procedure reported before.3c,4d All other chemicals, including 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid and 5-formyl-2-furanboronic acid, are commercially available. The 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid (or 5-formyl-2-furanboronic acid) was coupled with indoline intermediate 1 by a Suzuki-coupling reaction. Then the cyanoacetic acid was introduced by the Knoevenagel reaction. Obviously, the quite straightforward synthetic route, and the relatively high overall yield can guarantee convenient scale-up for future commercial use.
As shown in Fig. 1a, WBS-1T and WBS-1F present quite similar absorption spectra due to their similar structures. Owing to the more effective π-electron delocalization of the thiophene unit than the furan unit, a slightly broader spectrum was obtained for WBS-1T. The absorption bands (λmax) of WBS-1T and WBS-1F were found at 523 and 522 nm, while their emission bands (λem) were located at 668 and 664 nm (Table 1), respectively. Compared with C-CA, there is around 10 nm hypsochromic shift in λmax because of the removal of the vinyl group. High molar extinction coefficients were also found for WBS-1T and WBS-1F as 58200 and 57100 M−1 cm−1, which were around 5% and 7% lower than that of C-CA, respectively (Table 1). Due to the aggregation effect, the absorption spectra of all three dyes became broadened when adsorbed onto the 10 μm TiO2 film (Fig. 1b). Moreover, WBS-1T and WBS-1F showed slightly narrower light-harvesting areas than C-CA which is consistent with their absorption spectra in solution.

Cyclic voltammetry was also performed on three dyes to evaluate the possibility of the electron transfer process. The oxidation potential (HOMO) of C-CA was determined to be 0.83 V vs. NHE (Fig. 2). After removing the vinyl unit, the HOMO level of WBS-1T was shifted downward to 0.89 V. Due to the similar electrochemical properties between the thiophene and furan units, WBS-1F presented a similar HOMO level of 0.90 V. The band gap was estimated from the crosspoint of the normalized absorbance and emission spectra as shown in Fig. 1a. According to the lower π-conjugation, WBS-1T and WBS-1F showed higher band gaps of 2.05 and 2.07 V, respectively, resulting in slightly more negative LUMO levels with respect to C-CA. Obviously, the driving forces of all three dyes are high enough (much higher than 0.2 V) for the efficient electron injection and dye regeneration,10 which were affected little by changing the π-linker segment from vinylthiophene to thiophene and furan units (Fig. 2).

In good agreement with the absorption spectra (Fig. 1b), C-CA presented broader incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE). In the region of 610–810 nm, C-CA showed slightly higher IPCE values than those of WBS-1T and WBS-1F. Furthermore, due to the larger π-conjugation, the initial response wavelength of C-CA was determined to be 810 nm, which was bathochromic shifted by about 40 nm with respect to the WBS dyes (Fig. 3a). Thus, it can be predicted that C-CA should present higher JSC than WBS-1T and WBS-1F. It should be mentioned that in spite of the narrower action spectra, the IPCE values of dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F in the high energy range of 400–600 nm were a little higher than those of C-CA, which may compensate for the drawback of the narrow response area to some extent.

The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of liquid DSSCs based on three dyes were performed under AM1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2), and the curves are also presented in Fig. 3b. As previously mentioned, due to the narrower photoresponse area, the slightly lower JSC values of 16.58 and 16.28 mA cm−2 were obtained with dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F, respectively, than that of C-CA (17.46 mA cm−2). In contrast, quite high VOC values were obtained: 756 and 779 mV for WBS-1T and WBS-1F, respectively, which are 86 and 109 mV higher than that of C-CA (670 mV, Table 2), leading to a distinct increase in the overall conversion efficiency (η). It should be pointed out that after further optimizing the preparation conditions of the DSSCs, the VOC of 670 mV of C-CA was obtained in this work, which was higher than the previous result.4d As a consequence, the influence of the conjugated π-linker upon changing from vinylthiophene to thiophene or furan units was predominately advantageous for VOC rather than JSC, that is, it resulted in a large increase in VOC for WBS-1T and WBS-1F (Table 2). It is suggested that the removal of the double bond in the vinylthiophene linker is required to overcome the major limitation of the relatively low VOC for C-CA.

As is well known, VOC is dependent upon the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox), which can be illustrated by eqn (1):2a (1)where ECB is the conduction band edge energy level, β is a characteristic constant of the tailing of TiO2 states, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, n/NCB is the electron concentration in the CB of TiO2, and q is the elementary charge of the electrons. Thus, VOC is dependent upon both the ECB and the electron concentration in TiO2, and the electron concentration is strongly dependent on the rate of charge recombination, which can often be evaluated by the electron lifetime. Accordingly, to further picture the distinct enhancement in VOC by the conjugated π-linker, the VOC and electron lifetime as a function of electron density for three dye-based DSSCs were examined by stepped light-induced transient measurements (SLIT).
As shown in Fig. 4a, VOC as a function of electron density was used to study the CB edge shift. Three identical devices were tested in each case with standard deviations of less than 1%. It can be found that for all DSSCs, the VOC increases linearly with the logarithm of the electron density, exhibiting a similar slope. At a fixed electron density, there is about 66 mV enhancement for WBS-1T with respect to C-CA, meaning that the CB edges of WBS-1T-sensitized TiO2 were significantly lifted after the vinyl group was removed from the π-conjugation segment. Moreover, in the case of WBS-1F, with the use of the furan unit as the π-conjugation segment instead of thiophene, the CB edge enhancement was further enlarged to about 92 mV. This is consistent with the observed VOC (Table 2).
 Fig. 4  (a) Open-circuit voltage (VOC) and (b) electron lifetime as a function of electron density based on WBS-1T, WBS-1F, and C-CA sensitized solar cells. 
On the other hand, the electron lifetime decreases with charge density following a power law relationship with the same slope, suggesting the same recombination mechanism (Fig. 4b).3d At a fixed electron density, the electron lifetimes for WBS-1F and WBS-1T based DSSCs are 11.3- and 6.6-fold, respectively, that of C-CA. Possibly, the one additional vinyl group in C-CA results in the fastest charge recombination rate, while the furan unit could prevent the charge recombination to the largest extent among these three dyes. Given that the VOC values for WBS-1F and WBS-1T are higher than for C-CA by 86 and 109 mV, wherein the CB edges for WBS-1F and WBS-1T are lifted by 66 and 92 mV, the additional contribution to VOC from the repression of charge recombination can be calculated to be 20 and 17 mV, respectively. Consequently, as an overall result of the CB edge shift and the charge recombination, the VOC values of the three dyes (Table 2 and Fig. 3) are in the order WBS-1F (779 mV) > WBS-1T (756 mV) > C-CA (670 mV). This accounts well for the observed superior photovoltage upon removal of the vinyl group in the conjugated π-linker.
As previously mentioned, the CB edge shift of TiO2 is the major contribution to the large difference in VOC, accounting for 80% of the enhancement. It has been shown that the dipole moment along the direction from the sensitizer to the TiO2 (vertical) upon dye adsorption can distinctly induce a CB shift (ΔECB) of the semiconductor as in eqn (2):11 (2)where q is the electron charge, μnormal is the dye vertical dipole moment, γ is the dye surface concentration, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer. Obviously, a large μnormal will be beneficial for the upward shift of the CB edge based on eqn (2). To gain further insight into the different CB edge shifts, theoretical calculation analysis, which is origin-dependent for charged species, was performed by hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) with the 6-31G* basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 03 program.9 The vertical dipole moments of the three dyes at their optimized geometry were calculated, and are shown in Fig. 5. The vertical component of the dipoles (x components) of the three dyes possess the same direction but with different magnitudes (9.29, 7.84 and 5.73 D for WBS-1F, WBS-1T and C-CA, respectively). More precisely, a sharp increase of the dipole moment was found, suggesting that the vinyl double bond in C-CA is not beneficial to the charge separation. Besides the highest dipole moment for WBS-1F, the furan π-linker has a slightly lower tendency to trap the charge from the indoline electrolyte with respect to the corresponding thiophene unit.12 As reported, when adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, the possible non-bonded S–S interaction in the thiophene π-linker dyes may also be detrimental to electron injection of the excited dye into TiO2.13 Although the co-adsorbent of DCA was added to break the π-aggregation, the nonbonded S–S interaction may still exist for its slightly longer action distance. Moreover, the larger vertical dipole moment can also result in a larger adsorption angle (θ, shown in Fig. 5), which will suppress the charge recombination by blocking the redox species from approaching the TiO2.14 Thus, once adsorbed onto TiO2, the largest dipole moment along the direction for WBS-1F led to the largest CB edge shift and the slowest rate of charge recombination of the three dyes, resulting in the largest VOC value (Fig. 3 and 4a). As a result, WBS-1F showed a predominant increase by 109 mV, along with a very promising conversion efficiency of 9.49% (Table 2).
 Fig. 5  Optimized geometrical structures, calculated total dipole moments and adsorption angles of WBS-1T, WBS-1F and C-CA. 
Long-term stability is another very important requirement for the practical applications. Each component as well as the sealing technique of the cell devices can impact its stability to a different extent during long-term application under severe conditions. As the core of DSSCs, the sensitized dye should be stable enough under light irradiation as a precondition for a long-term stable device. For evaluating the practical stability of these three dye-based DSSCs in the long term, the ionic liquid electrolyte consisted of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide/1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide/I2/N-butylbenzimidazole/TBP/GuSCN (20/20/3/4/3/4, w/w) was employed.
As expected, the photovoltaic performance including JSC and VOC in the ionic liquid electrolyte was lower than the previously mentioned volatile electrolyte device. As shown in Fig. 6, the JSC values obtained were 15.09, 14.93 and 15.88 mA cm−2 (Table 3) for WBS-1T, WBS-1F and C-CA, respectively, which are in the same order as those using liquid electrolyte. It should be mentioned that, compared with liquid DSSCs, there was only around 10% decrease in JSC for all three dyes while the TiO2 electrode was reduced from 10 μm to 6 μm, meaning that the change of electrolyte and electrode did not affect the electron transfer and light harvesting much because of the high molar extinction coefficient of the three dyes even with the thin TiO2 film. Among these three dyes using ionic liquid electrolyte, WBS-1F still exhibited the best photovoltaic performance of 8.03%, along with JSC of 14.93 mA cm−2, VOC of 735 mV, and ff of 0.732 (Table 3). Fig. 7 shows the aging test of three ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs under 100 mW cm−2 illumination soaking at 60 °C over a period of 1000 h. Interestingly for dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F, very small decreases in JSC and ff were observed, and the decrease of η was mainly caused by the decrease of VOC. In contrast, all photovoltaic parameters of C-CA decreased seriously under illumination. To further get insight into the distinct difference, the absorption spectra of the three dyes before and after 30 min irradiation without redox electrolyte were examined and are compared in Fig. 8.4b,15 There was almost no change in the absorption spectra of WBS-1T and WBS-1F while the absorbance of C-CA decreased by about 35%. Obviously, C-CA is quite easily decomposed under light irradiation, while WBS dyes show high photo-stability under the same conditions. Accordingly, after 1000 h of illumination, around 5% decrease in η was found for dyes WBS-1T and WBS-1F while there existed about 40% decrease for C-CA (Table 3). Consequently, the removal of the vinyl group in the π-linker segment can distinctly improve the dye photo-stability. That is, the common, stability-reducing double bond on the thienyl π-linker bridge should be avoided.

4 Conclusion
Given that the vinyl bond on the π-bridge thiophene segment can reduce its intrinsic photo-stability, three D–D–π–A indoline dyes C-CA, WBS-1T and WBS-1F with different conjugated π-linkers (vinylthiophene, thiophene and furan) have been systematically studied for high efficiency, long-term stable dye-sensitized solar cells. Instead of the vinyl thiophene unit, the conjugated π-linker of the thiophene or furan group in WBS-1T and WBS-1F can improve solar cell performances with a great enhancement in the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), mostly arising from the CB edge upshift of TiO2 and the slow charge recombination. Among three dyes, the largest dipole moment along the direction for WBS-1F can lead to the largest CB edge upshift, resulting in a preferable charge separation and recombination rate. With respect to the reference dye C-CA, when removing the vinyl bond in the conjugated π-linker, the Voc values of WBS-1T and WBS-1F are sharply increased by 86 and 109 mV, respectively. Notably, with the furan unit as the π-linker segment, WBS-1F displays an extraordinary high efficiency of 9.49% with a high photovoltage of 779 mV. When applied in ionic-liquid electrolyte DSSCs, the furan unit also results in a high efficiency of 8.03% with long-term stability. Based on SLIT analysis and molecular dipole simulations, our work can account well for the observed superior photovoltage upon the removal of the vinyl group in the conjugated π-linker. It is strongly suggested that the vinyl unit in conjugated π-linkers for D–π–A organic dyes is detrimental to the molecular dipole moments, the upshift of the TiO2 CB edge, the suppression of charge recombination between titania electrons and redox electrolytes, and the photo-stability.
