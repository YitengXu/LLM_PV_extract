    , Accepted 20th December 2021First published on 20th December 2021AbstractThe large-scale application of clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems such as water-splitting devices and Zn–air batteries greatly depends on the development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts. Transitional metal sulfides (TMSs) have gained great research interest owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity, adjustable electronic structures, and various crystal structures and phases. Meanwhile, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal precursors for the preparation of TMSs due to the diverse metal nodes, organic ligands, topologies, and morphologies of MOFs. In addition, MOFs could act as hosts for the incorporation of guest molecules, which could further expand the metal types of TMSs.

1. Introduction
The ever-increasing environmental issues caused by burning of fossil has inspired human's awareness of environmental protection, and the realization of carbon neutrality in the middle of this century has been promised by many countries.1–3 To achieve this goal, it is necessary to optimize energy structures via developing green and renewable alternative energies.4–6 Solar energy and wind power are recognized as promising clean energies. However, their widespread applications are limited in the global energy systems due to their instability caused by time and place factors. Fortunately, it is possible to convert these sustainable energy sources into hydrogen or electrical energy using water-splitting devices and metal–air batteries.7–9 Nevertheless, the conversion process is limited by the low energy conversion efficiency due to the sluggish kinetics and large overpotentials of the electrochemical reactions that take place in these energy conversion devices.10–12 Therefore, it is important to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the electrochemical devices to realize lower energy consumption during the conversion process.
Generally, the electrochemical water splitting involves two reactions, namely, hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). In addition, OERs and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are the primary reactions in rechargeable metal–air batteries. Using highly efficient electrocatalysts to decrease the reaction barriers is one of the main strategies to accelerate the electrochemical reactions.5,13,14 Nowadays, state-of-the-art electrocatalysts are mainly precious metals such as Pt (ORRs and HERs), RuO2 and IrO2 (OERs). However, due to the high cost incurred by their “rare earth” status, the wide spread application of these catalysts is severely hindered.15–17 Therefore, numerous efforts were devoted to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts based on earth abundant elements.
Recent investigations have demonstrated that transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are very promising alternatives benefiting from their unique physicochemical properties such as various crystal structures, different crystal phases and adjustable band position and band gap.18–22 Commonly, TMSs consist of a layered structure (MoS2 and WS2) and a nonlayered structure (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn etc.), both of which have unique advantages for electrocatalysis. For example, layered TMSs could expose a large number of edge active sites.23,24 In comparison, it has been proposed that there are a number of dangling bonds on the surface of nonlayered TMS, which could bring in novel electronic characteristics.25,26 In addition, TMSs have many different crystal phases (CoS, Co3S4, Co9S8, and CoS2 for cobalt-based sulfides), which provide opportunities for optimizing the conductivity and band gap of TMSs.27–29 Moreover, TMSs can be easily doped with heteroatoms or form heterogeneous structures, leading to better electronic structures for the adsorption of intermediates.30,31
TMSs can be prepared via a hydrothermal or a solvothermal method, co-precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, ion exchange method, etc.32–36 The electrocatalysis performance of the obtained TMSs has been investigated including phase engineering, composite engineering, and interface engineering. Especially, TMSs derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted widespread attention in the field of energy conversion in recent years.37–40 MOFs are a class of porous materials composed of metal nodes and organic linkers, and the composites and structures of MOFs can be well tailored by properly choosing metal centers and organic ligands. Due to the presence of various metal ions in MOFs, they are ideal candidates to prepare metal compounds such as metal oxides, metal sulfides and metal phosphides.41–45 In addition, the organic ligands in MOFs can be carbonized into carbon in a N2 atmosphere, thereby forming metal compounds/carbon hybrids. Generally, N-coordinated nitrogen-containing ligands and O-coordinated oxygen-containing ligands can be used to synthesise MOFs, which could not only result in different components, structures, and morphologies of MOFs, but also lead to heteroatom doping in carbon to further improve the catalytic performance of the hybrid catalysts. Moreover, the morphology of MOFs can be inherited during the transformation process, which enables the preparation of MOF derivatives with unique structures such as hollow structures that could provide more surface and interfaces for the electrochemical reactions.46–49 Some elegant works have reviewed the progress of porous carbon, metal oxides and metal phosphides derived from MOFs for catalysis and energy storage.43,50,51 Yet to the best of our knowledge, there is no specific review about MOF-based TMS electrocatalysts for the HER, OER and ORR. Considering the increasing research interests and significant progress of MOF-derived TMSs for electrocatalysis, there is a great necessity to provide a systematic comprehension of this potential field.
In this review, the recent progress of MOF-derived TMSs for advanced electrocatalysis including HERs, OERs and ORRs is comprehensively and systematically summarized (Fig. 1). The preparation strategies, structures of the catalysts, catalytic performances and catalytic mechanisms are revealed to give readers a better understanding of this prosperous field. We also paid specific attention to the bifunctional catalytic performance of the catalysts for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn–air batteries. In addition, personal perspectives about the challenges and opportunities for the future development of this field are proposed. We expect this review could initiate more efforts in this emerging research area and new discoveries and breakthroughs could be achieved in the future.

2. A brief introduction to the electrocatalysis processes
As mentioned above, the HER and OER are the basic reactions of water splitting and the OER and ORR are the main reactions of rechargeable metal–air batteries. To design highly efficient electrocatalysts, an understanding of the reaction mechanisms is very important.
The HER is the cathode reaction in water splitting and the process involves two steps. The first step is the Volmer reaction, which is also known as the electrochemical hydrogen adsorption step, where a proton coupled to an electron to adsorb hydrogen atoms on the surface of electrocatalysts. The second step is either the electrochemical desorption (Heyrovsky reaction) or the chemical desorption (Tafel reaction) process depending on the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen.52,53 When the concentration of adsorbed hydrogen is low, adsorbed hydrogen will couple with another electron and combine with another water molecule to release hydrogen, while the two adjacent adsorbed hydrogen atoms combine to form H2 when the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen is high. In an acidic medium, H3O+ in water can be adsorbed on the active sites of catalysts directly and participate in the chemical reaction. While in alkaline media, the decomposition of a water molecule occurs to form adsorbed H on the active sites since there is no direct H3O+. The related reaction mechanisms are listed in Fig. 2. Due to the involved adsorption and desorption of hydrogen, the rate of HER greatly relies on the adsorption free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*), and an ideal electrocatalyst for HER should have a ΔGH* close to 0 eV.54,55
 Fig. 2  Reaction mechanisms of HERs in acidic and alkaline media, and OERs, ORRs, Zn–air batteries, and full water splitting in alkaline media. 
Compared with HERs, OERs taking place at the anode of metal–air batteries and water splitting are more complicated four electron processes. In alkaline media, the hydroxyl group is absorbed onto the surface of electrocatalysts to form M–OH and M–O intermediates, then O2 can be produced by direct combination of two adjacent M–O intermediates or the combination of M–O with OH– to form MOOH intermediate and release O2 further.56,57 Generally, OERs and HERs possess similar evaluation parameters such as onset potential and overpotential, which indicate the potential when the cathode current begins to appear and reach a certain current density. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is usually used to compare the performance of electrocatalysts.58 The Tafel slope and exchange current density are also important parameters to evaluate the activity of an electrocatalyst. The Tafel plot can be derived from the LSV curve according to the formula η = a + blogj, where η is the overpotential, a is a constant related to the temperature, electrolyte and electrode characteristics, and b is the Tafel slope. The Tafel slope not only reflects the reaction kinetics, but also reflects reaction mechanisms.59 When η is 0, the obtained j is the exchange current density, which is a key descriptor to evaluate the catalytic efficiency. The turn over frequency (TOF) is usually used to estimate the intrinsic catalytic activity of electrocatalysts, which indicates the number of reactants that can be converted into the target product per active site and per second.60 Stability is also an important parameter, which is directly related to the service life of an electrocatalyst.
The ORR is a cathode reaction in metal–air batteries and fuel cells, and can proceed via a direct four-electron pathway or a two-electron pathway based on the catalytic activity of ORR catalysts. In fuel cells, the direct four-electron pathway is more desirable, and this process also involves many intermediates and multiple steps (Fig. 2).61 Therefore, optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediates is also an effective means to improve the reaction kinetics of ORRs, which is similar to HERs and OERs. The onset potential, half-wave potential and limited current density are important parameters for evaluating the catalytic activity of ORR electrocatalysts. In addition, the reaction kinetics and electron transfer number can be obtained using the Koutecky–Levich equation based on rotating disk electrode measurements.62
With the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts, overall water-splitting devices and Zn–air batteries are usually assembled to evaluate the practical applications of the catalysts. For overall water-splitting devices, the potential used to drive a certain current density such as 10 mA cm−2 is usually collected to compare the performance of the catalysts. In addition, the faradaic efficiency of the water-splitting devices is usually calculated from collected H2 and O2 by a drainage gas gathering method.63,64 For Zn–air batteries, the open circuit voltage, power density, specific capacitance, and voltage gap between discharge and charge potentials at a certain current density are usually collected for comparison.65,66
3. Metal sulfides derived from MOFs for electrocatalysis
3.1 Metal sulfides derived from MOFs for HERs
TMSs are ideal electrocatalysts for replacing Pt in HERs due to their intrinsic high activity, abundant active sites, and high reserve. However, the low conductivity of TMSs limited their performance.67 Constructing TMSs/carbon hybrids is an effective method to improve the electronic conductivity. For the preparation of TMSs from MOFs, carbon can be derived from the decomposition of organic ligands and TMSs can be obtained by directly calcining MOFs in the presence of S-containing compounds. By solid grinding thiourea with Co-MOFs followed by thermal annealing at high temperatures, Li et al. prepared N, S co-doped carbon-encapsulated Co9S8 nanoparticles, and a low overpotential of 86.4 mV was achieved at 10 mA cm−2 due to the synergistic effect of carbon and Co9S8 active species.68 By thermal annealing ZIF-67 in the presence of S powders, Mujtaba et al. also obtained a Co9S8-decorated N-doped carbon layer, which could effectively catalyze HERs under both acidic and basic conditions.69 He et al. prepared amorphous metal sulfides (CoSx) via controllable electrochemical conversion of ZIF-67, and the optimized catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 168 mV in a neutral electrolyte.70 In addition, the conversion mechanism and correlation between the concentration of S22− sites and the HER activity were revealed, providing a new platform for preparing metal sulfides from MOFs. In another work, Wang et al. found that thiourea could not only lead to the formation of TMSs, but also lead to N doping, and nitrogen-rich CoS2@nitrogen-doped carbon was prepared. Compared with CoS2@nitrogen-doped carbon prepared using a S powder as a sulfur source, N-CoS2@NC exhibited a higher HER catalytic activity due to N doping and more Co–Nx active species.71
Constructing proper nanostructures could improve the catalytic performance of TMSs due to the more exposed active sites and fast mass transport. Using ZIF-67 as the precursor followed by three successive sulfidation processes, Niu et al. prepared CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages. The unique structure endows the catalyst with a high specific surface area of 161 m2 g−1 and much interior voids (Fig. 3a).72 Combined with the chemical compositions and high conductive carbon substrate, CoS2–C@CoS2 exhibited a small overpotential of 79.1 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 51.9 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3b and Table 1).

Doping metal ions into TMSs is an effective strategy to improve their HER performance due to the changed electronic state and band gap of TMSs.73,74 Using MOFs as precursors to avoid the differences in catalytic activity brought by morphology, Du et al. investigated Fe, Ni and Zn-doped Co9S8 nanoarrays via both theory and experiment.75 The H2O adsorption models were optimized and DFT calculations indicated that Ni–Co9S8 showed a stronger chemical adsorption of H2O, which could promote the water splitting kinetics (Fig. 3c–h). In addition, Ni–Co9S8 exhibited a smaller Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen, suggesting a smaller activation energy of transition state species on the Ni–Co9S8 surface during the HER process (Fig. 3i). Moreover, more electrons near the Fermi level were indicated by the density of states (DOS), indicating a better conductivity of Ni–Co9S8. As a result, Ni–Co9S8 exhibited the best HER performance with an overpotential of 90 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3j). The effect of metal ion doping was also demonstrated by Huang et al., where Zn, Ni and Cu-doped Co3S4 were developed for HERs using ZIF-67 as the precursor (Fig. 3k).76 DFT calculations indicated that the doping of Zn2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ could narrow the band gap and lead to the improved excitation of charge to the conduction band, thereby improved conductivity was observed. In addition, Zn-doped Co3S4 exhibited the smallest free energy for H adsorption, suggesting its proper electronic structure for HERs (Fig. 3l). Electrochemical measurements indicate that Zn0.30Co2.70S4 exhibited good HER activity over a wide pH range (Fig. 3m–o).
MoS2 has been considered as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst due to its similar hydrogen adsorption free energy with Pt.77 Therefore, MoS2-based TMSs are extensively investigated for HERs. Tang et al. prepared MoS2/CoS2 nanotube arrays supported on a piece of carbon cloth (CC) using Co-MOFs as the precursor followed by a two-step sulfurization reaction with (NH4)2MoS4 and thioacetamide (TAA) respectively (Fig. 4a).78 The hollow heterostructure exhibited superior HER performance with small overpotentials of 85 and 90 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. The interface interaction of MoS2 and CoS2 was revealed by the shift of XPS binding energies of Co, Mo and S. The DFT calculations indicated that more electrons would accumulate around Co–S bonds at the interfaces, and electrons in the fully empty states are localized at the S–S bridging S22− ligands, which could improve the HER activity (Fig. 4b and c). In addition, a reduced Gibbs free energy for H adsorption was observed, further demonstrating the advantages of the heterostructure (Fig. 4d and e). The synergistic effects of CoS2–MoS2 and Ni3S2–MoS2 were also demonstrated by Hou et al., where polyoxometalate-based MOFs were used as precursors, and low overpotentials for HERs were achieved.79

The HER performance of MoS2/Co3S4 composites was investigated by Lei et al. in a recent work.80 By reacting ZIF-67 with TAA, a hollow Co3S4 polyhedron was obtained first. After further coating MoS2 using Na2MoO4 and TAA, a MoS2/Co3S4 hollow hybrid was successfully prepared. Due to the hollow structure and the interaction of MoS2 and Co3S4, the catalyst exhibited an over potential of 175 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Co9S8–MoS2 composites also exhibited good HER performance, as demonstrated by Ganesan's work, where hierarchical Co9S8–MoS2 nanoboxes were prepared using a ZIF-67 nanocube as the precursor.81 The Co9S8–MoS2 exhibited a small overpotential of 106 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and a small Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec−1. To improve the conductivity of TMSs, Li et al. prepared Co9S8-NC@MoS2 polyhedron using carbonization and sequence hydrothermal sulfurization in the presence of Na2MoO4 and L-cysteine (Fig. 4f).82 The strong interaction of Co9S8 and MoS2 was revealed by XPS measurement, where Co 2p peaks of Co9S8-NC@MoS2 shifted negatively compared with Co9S8/NC (Fig. 4h). Combined with the high conductivity induced by the porous carbon, the Co9S8-NC@MoS2 exhibited good performance over a wide pH range (Fig. 4g).
The important roles of nanostructures and components of TMSs were further revealed by Yang and coworkers.83 Using ZIF-67 as the precursor, a yolk–shelled NC-CoS2@CoS2/MoS2 catalyst was developed by an ion–exchange reaction with (NH4)2MoS4 and a sequence sulfurization reaction with sulfur powders. Compared with the CoS2/MoS2 hollow polyhedron and NC-CoS2@CoS2 yolk–shelled catalysts, NC-CoS2@CoS2/MoS2 exhibited much smaller HER overpotential and electrochemically active surface area, highlighting the important role of conductive carbon and MoS2 (Fig. 4i–k).
Besides introducing MoS2 during the post treatment of MOFs using Na2MoO4 or (NH4)2MoS4, the encapsulation of polyoxometalates into MOFs is also an effective strategy to prepare MoS2 and MSx composites. By incorporating phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA) into MIL-100, Huang et al. prepared Fe–Mo–S in a S-doped carbon substrate by calcining the PMA@MIL precursor under H2S/Ar flow (Fig. 5a).84 Compared with the Mo-free counterpart, the Fe–Mo–S/carbon composites exhibited much better HER activity due to the synergistic effect of the different metal species (Fig. 5b and c).

To further enlarge the synergistic effect of various metal sulfides, TMSs with multiple metal sites were developed. Zhang et al. prepared a ZnxCo1−xMoS3 microbox from the ZnCo-MOF via a liquid precipitation and thermal annealing process (Fig. 5d).85 It was found that the incorporation of Zn could facilitate the absorption of H and improve the conductivity of ZnxCo1−xMoS3, while the free energy of H adsorption in the S-edge decreased after introducing Co. In addition, the substitution of Mo by Zn and Co could create unsaturated S atoms, which could act as active sites and boost the HER performance (Fig. 5e). In another work, the Ni0.15Co0.85S2@MoS2 catalyst was prepared via a hydrothermal reaction of NiCo-MOFs with H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O and thiourea (Fig. 5f).86 The incorporation of Ni could improve the conductivity of the catalyst and activate more defect sites. Combined with the flower-like structure that enables a large electrochemical surface area and the synergistic effect of MoS2 and CoS2, Ni0.15Co0.85S2@MoS2 exhibited a small overpotential of 79 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte.
3.2 Metal sulfides derived from MOFs for OERs
Besides HERs, TMSs are promising electrocatalytic materials for OERs due to their proper adsorption energy for O and OH species.87,88 Using ZIF-67 nanocubes as the precursor, Guo et al. prepared hollow CoS2 nanocubes via an ion–exchange reaction in thioacetamide solutions.89 The hollow nanostructure enabled a large electrolyte–catalyst interaction and a rapid mass diffusion pathway. Combined with highly active CoS2, the CoS2 nanocube only needed 290 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Using a similar anion exchange reaction of Na2S with Co3[Fe(CN)6]2, Cai and coworkers prepared a hollow amorphous CoSx catalyst.90 Extended X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy indicated that there are partly Co–O bonds in the catalyst, and DFT calculations suggested that the incorporation of oxygen into amorphous CoSx could strengthen the adsorption of O-containing intermediates, thereby improving the OER performance of the catalyst accordingly.
The OER performance of TMSs could be further improved by incorporating carbon substrates to improve the electron transfer during the reaction process. In addition, carbon could further prevent the TMS nanoparticles from aggregation. In a recent work, by coating ZIF on the surface of a CdS nanowire followed by thermal annealing, Wu et al. prepared N, S co-doped hierarchical carbon nanofiber-encapsulated Co9S8 nanoparticles for OERs (Fig. 6a).91 During the heat treatment process, the CdS was reduced to evaporative Cd and S diffused into the carbon framework and reacted with Co, forming Co9S8 and N, S co-doped carbon. The evaporation of Cd could further improve the porosity of the carbon. Due to the synergistic effect of hierarchical carbon and Co9S8, the optimized catalyst Co9S8/NSCNFs-850 could afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 302 mV (Fig. 6b and Table 2).

Heteroatom doping is another effective strategy to improve the catalytic activity of TMSs, where the electronic structure of TMSs could be tuned to optimize the adsorption of intermediates.92,93 Wang et al. prepared Fe-doped Co9S8 from Fe-doped Co-MOF nanosheets and investigated the role of Fe doping by DFT calculations (Fig. 6c).94 It has been found that Fe doping could induce a decrease in dxz-orbital density of Co around the Fermi level, probably due to the partial charge transfer from Co2+ to Fe2+ (Fig. 6d). In addition, the d-band center of Fe–Co9S8 shifted away from the Fermi level, which could boost the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates on the surface of the catalyst and improve the OER catalytic activity accordingly (Fig. 6e).
Constructing heterostructures could also alter the electronic structure of TMSs, and the synergistic effect of different components could further improve the catalytic activity.95,96 Using Zn–Co-ZIF as a precursor followed by sulphuration with S powders, Chen et al. prepared Co9S8/Zn–Co–S heterostructure-decorated carbon nanocages (Fig. 6f).97 The carbon substrate could improve the electronic conductivity of the metal sulfides, and the interconnected nanorods that extruded from the rough surface of the carbon polyhedral could facilitate ion and electron transport (Fig. 6g). In addition, the formation of Co9S8/Zn0.8Co0.2S heterostructures induced the enlargement of the lattice parameter, due to the electron injection from Zn0.8Co0.2S into Co9S8. The electrochemical measurement indicated that the overpotential of Co9S8/Zn0.8Co0.2S for OERs decreased greatly compared with single-component catalysts or a mixture of them (Fig. 6h). DFT calculations suggested that the charge injection could decrease the formation energy of *OOH species, therefore promoting the formation of O2 (Fig. 6i and j). In another work, CeOx/CoS heterostructures with abundant grain boundaries and lattice defects were developed and improved OER catalytic performance was achieved due to the lattice strain induced by the strong coupled CeOx/CoS units and the high-energy interfacial structures induced by high-index CeOx nanoparticles.98
Nickel sulfides are also good candidates for replacing RuO2 as promising OER catalysts and the OER performance of nickel sulfides with different crystal phases was also investigated. In a recent work, Wan et al. prepared a hierarchical Ni3S4 architecture using a Ni-MOF as the precursor followed by an anion exchange reaction with Na2S, and the role of Ni3+ for OERs was revealed by both theoretical and experimental results (Fig. 7a).99 By adjusting the reaction temperature, the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio could be effectively adjusted and the catalyst with a higher Ni3+ content tends to exhibit a higher catalytic activity. DFT calculations indicated that compared with Ni2+ coordinated with four S atoms, Ni3+ coordinated with six S atoms showed much lower chemisorption free energy, which could facilitate electron transfer to the surface during the OER process. In addition, the hexacoordinated Ni6 exhibited a longer O–H band distance and a shorter Ni–O band, demonstrating improved activation of the O–H band of the Ni3+ sites (Fig. 7b–d). In another work, Lin et al. prepared a 2D Ni–Ni3S2@carbon nanoplate with a thickness less than 20 nm from MOF nanoplates and the catalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 287 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7e).100 The good performance could be ascribed to the thin 2D morphology that provided abundant active sites, the high conductive graphite carbon layers facilitating the charge transfer from the inner alloy core and the coexistence of Ni particles to lower the resistance.

Ni–Fe-based sulfides were also investigated as potential OER electrocatalysts. Using a NiFe–Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a precursor, Xuan et al. prepared mixed phases of Fe5Ni4S8 and NiS with sea urchin-like morphology in the presence of hydrazine hydrate and sulfur powder (Fig. 7f).101 The important role of both hydrazine hydrate and sulfur powder to obtain this special morphology was revealed via comparative experiments, and LSV measurements demonstrated the advantage of the Ni–Fe–S catalyst. The good OER performance could be attributed to the 3D sea urchin-like morphology that promotes ion and charge transport, the mixed valence Ni and Fe in the mixed phase of Fe5Ni4S8 and NiS, and the conductive carbon layer. In another work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped Ni–Co–Fe–S was developed by Wang and coworkers, and it has been found that the electron transfer among Fe, Co and Ni could result in a change in the band structure and the overlap of electron cloud, which is responsible for the improved OER performance of the trimetallic sulfides.102
Compared with non-self-supporting catalysts, which usually need adhesives to bond them to the working electrode, self-supporting catalysts in situ grown on conductive substrates have several advantages.103,104 On the one hand, the high conductivity of the catalysts could be ensured and the contact area of catalysts and electrolyte are enlarged without the usage of polymer binders. On the other hand, due to the strong anchoring effect, the aggregation of active sites is suppressed. In addition, self-supporting catalysts could guarantee the fast gas escape from the surface and prevent the peeling of catalysts. Therefore, self-supporting catalysts for OERs were investigated extensively. Via in situ growth of CoNi-MOFs on carbon fiber paper (CFP), and sequenced sulfurization treatment, Xie et al. prepared Ni-doped CoS2 on CFP, which exhibited a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2.105 The Ni doping could reduce the size of CoS2 and the CFP could avoid the aggregation of CoS2 nanoparticles, leading to a good OER catalytic activity. Shen et al. prepared N-doped NiFe–S supported on carbon cloth (CC) via one-step carbonization and sulfurization of NiFe-MOFs on CC (Fig. 8a–c). The synergetic effect of Ni and Fe sites, the isolated metal species due to the isolation effect of in situ formed N-doped carbon during the carbonization process, and the high-conductive CC support contributed to its catalytic activity.106

Composite catalysts composed of MOFs and its derivatives have the advantages of more open active sites of MOFs and high conductivity of MOF derivative. Accordingly, He et al. developed Ni-BDC@NiS composites by partial sulfurization of Ni-BDC on a Ni foam (Fig. 8d).107 NiS could improve the conductivity of Ni-BDC and highly porous Ni-BDC could provide rich accessible active sites. In addition, the reaction of TAA with ligands could produce more –OH groups on the surface of the catalyst, which could improve the surface wettability and facilitate water adsorption, thereby enhancing the OER kinetics. The improved catalytic activity of Ni-BDC@NiS was demonstrated by LSV curves compared with NiS and Ni-BDC counterparts (Fig. 8e).
3.3 Metal sulfides derived from MOFs for ORRs
Cobalt sulfides are the most widely investigated TMSs for ORRs due to the intrinsic high catalytic activity of cobalt.108,109 As mentioned above, cobalt sulfides have various crystal phases and the different preparation methods usually lead to different phases, which can result in differences in the catalytic activity. Using ZIF-67 as the precursor, Xia et al. prepared carbon-coated CoxSy (CoxSy@C-z, where z is the sulfurization temperature) by introducing H2S as a sulfur source during the thermal annealing process.110 XRD patterns showed that the obtained products mainly contain Co1−xS. In addition, CoxSy@C-1000 possesses high porosity than other catalysts. As a result, CoxSy@C-1000 exhibited high ORR activity and an efficient four-electron reaction pathway. Using the sulfur powder as the sulfur source and ZIF-9 as a precursor, Zhang et al. prepared high-density CoS1.097 nanoparticles encapsulated in porous carbon (PC–CoS1.097 NCs) by one-step pyrolysis at 900 °C (Fig. 9a).111 N2 sorption measurement showed that the PC-CoS1.097 NCs had a high specific surface area of 172 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.48 cm3 g−1, which could greatly improve the contact of electrolytes and the active materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that the PC-CoS1.097 NCs exhibited an obvious ORR peak at 0.81 V, which is only 47 mV negative than Pt/C, demonstrating the potential of CoS1.097 as an ORR active species.

(m) Open-circuit voltage of ZnS/Co-NSCNTs and Pt/C-based Zn–air batteries. Reproduced with permission: copyright 2021, Elsevier.117 
The ORR performance of CoS2 was also investigated in a recent work, where ZIF-67 was used as a precursor followed by carbonization and vulcanization processes.112 Besides the CoS2 active species, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the presence of high-content pyridinic N and Nx–Co active centers, which could further improve the ORR performance of CoS2@NC. LSV measurements indicated that the half-wave potential of CoS2@NC is only 10 mV smaller than that of Pt/C. In addition, CoS2@NC also exhibited better stability and methanol tolerance.
Co9S8 has been demonstrated to have similar electrocatalytic behaviors to that of Pt. However, its intrinsic low conductivity and small specific surface area limit its performance.113 By decorating cobalt thiourea into ZIF-8, followed by coating a layer of resorcinol-formaldehyde and high-temperature pyrolysis, Zhang and coworkers prepared N and S co-doped hollow porous carbon decorated with Co9S8 (Co9S8@N-S-HPC) (Fig. 9b).114 Co9S8@N-S-HPC exhibited a specific surface area of 519 m2 g−1 with hierarchical pores, which could expose more active sites and enable fast mass transport. When used as an ORR catalyst, Co9S8@N-S-HPC exhibited better onset potential and half-wave potential than Pt/C. Density functional theory indicated that there was a strong electron transfer in d orbitals of Co atoms when Co9S8 was decorated on N-S-HPC, and the synergistic interactions between Co9S8 and N-S-HPC are the key reasons for the improved catalytic performance (Fig. 9c). In another work, by thermally annealing partly sulfurized ZIF-67, Co nanoparticle-embedded carbon@Co9S8 double-shelled nanocages were prepared as highly efficient ORR catalysts (Fig. 9d–f).115 The Co–C acted as a mainly active site for ORRs and Co9S8 could effectively protect the aggregation of active centers. As a result, Co–C@Co9S8 showed decent ORR performance in terms of high current density, low over-potential, and good stability (Fig. 9g).
Besides cobalt sulfides, ZnS was investigated as an ORR catalyst for Zn–air batteries. Using ZIF-8 as a self-sacrifice template, Li and coworkers developed N, S co-doped porous carbon decorated with ZnS (ZnS@NC) (Fig. 9h).116 It was found that the content of ZnS greatly affected the ORR activity of the catalysts probably due to the balance role of ZnS active sites and specific surface area of the carbon. The good performance of ZnS@NC-3 enabled a high open circuit potential of 1.52 V for Zn–air batteries based on the ZnS@NC-3 catalyst and a power density of 176 mW cm−2, demonstrating its practical applications (Fig. 9i and j). In another work, the catalytic activity of ZnS and Co was integrated together by sulphuration of ZIF-8/ZIF-67 composites, and the catalysis role of Co induced the formation of carbon nanotubes during the decomposition of the organic ligand (Fig. 9i–k).117 Due to the highly active catalytic sites and efficient mass transport channels, the ZnS/Co-NSCNTs showed a half-wave potential of 0.871 V. When used as an anode catalyst for Zn–air batteries, a high open circuit potential of 1.52 V and a peak power density of 182.6 mW cm−2 were achieved (Fig. 9m).
3.4 Bifunctional electrocatalysts for HERs and OERs
As illustrated above, the HER and OER performances of TMSs were investigated individually and great progress was achieved in this area. However, for overall water splitting, where the cathodic HER and anodic OER take place simultaneously, it is better that the TMSs have bifunctional activity for both HERs and OERs to simplify the device. Therefore, the bifunctional catalytic activity and overall water splitting performance of TMSs are also explored.

Via in situ growth of Co-MOFs on graphene oxide (GO) sheets, Zhang et al. prepared Co-MOFs@GO and transferred the composite into Co/Co9S8-decorated S, N co-doped graphene sheets by a one-step pyrolysis (Fig. 10a).59 The rich O-containing groups of GO enable the adsorption of Co2+ and in situ growth of Co-MOFs. In addition, the S-containing ligand in Co-MOFs could act as a S source for the formation of Co9S8 and S doping, and N-containing ligands could dope N into the graphene sheet. The optimal catalyst obtained by calcination at 1000 °C (Co/Co9S8@SNGS-1000) could afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OERs at 290 mV and a current density of 20 mA cm−2 for HERs at 350 mV in 0.1 M KOH, indicating its bifunctional catalytic activity (Table 3). In addition, when used as both anodic and cathodic catalysts for overall water splitting, the Co/Co9S8@SNGS-1000 electrode could produce H2 and O2 at a rate of 4.87 and 2.48 μmol min−1 at 1.58 V, demonstrating its practical application (Fig. 10b). Using dual a ligand strategy, Du et al. also prepared a Co-based MOF and transferred the MOF into N, S and O-doped carbon-encapsulated Co/Co9S8 nanoparticles for full water splitting, and a low cell voltage of 1.56 V was achieved at 10 mA cm−2.118

Using ZnCo-ZIFs as the precursor, Yu et al. prepared N, S co-doped carbon nanotube/nanopolyhedron-encapsulated Zn0.975Co0.025S/CoS2 nanoparticles (ZnCoS-NSCNT/NP) via a two-step procedure(Fig. 10c).119 The first calcination in an Ar/H2 atmosphere resulted in the formation of CNT and Co3ZnC/Co nanoparticles and the second calcination with S powder led to the formation of TMSs. Due to the synergetic effect of N, S co-doped carbon, the CNT networks, and the two metal sulfide species, ZnCoS-NSCNT/NP exhibited low overpotentials of 152 mV and 270 mV for HERs and OERs respectively, and the full water splitting device only needed 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10d and e).
To boost the overall water splitting performance, MoS2 is composited with other TMSs by forming heterostructures. Using ZIF-67 as the precursor, Guo et al. obtained hollow Co3S4@MoS2via a two-step temperature-raising hydrothermal process (Fig. 10f).120 Due to the highly active MoS2 for HERs and Co3S4 for OERs, and the hollow structures that exposed abundant active sites, Co3S4@MoS2 exhibited good bifunctional catalytic performances for HERs and OERs in acidic and alkaline media. WS2 is also a good HER catalyst like MoS2. By incorporating phosphor-tungstic acid (PTA) into the cavity of ZIF-67 followed by heat treatment in an Ar/H2S atmosphere, Huang et al. prepared WS2/Co1−xS embedded in N, S co-doped porous carbon.121 The homogeneous confinement of PTA in ZIF-67 could result in the uniform dispersion of WS2 and Co1−xS. Combined with the synergetic effect of the two metal sulfide species, WS2/Co1−xS exhibited good performance for both OERs and HERs.
MoO3 is also a good precursor for the formation of MoS2. In a recent work, Li and coworkers prepared MoO2@MoS2@Co9S8 nanorods using MoO3@ZIF-67 as the precursor followed by carbonization and sulfurization processes (Fig. 10g).122 Except for the highly active MoS2 and Co9S8 species, high conductive MoO2 is formed to bridge less conductive MoS2 to boost charge transport during the electrochemical reaction. In addition, the electron transfer between MoS2 and Co9S8 indicated the synergic effect. Combined with the 2D nanosheet structure, MoO2@MoS2@Co9S8 exhibited good OER and HER performance with low overpotentials of 310 mV and 160 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and a small cell voltage of 1.62 V was achieved at 10 mA cm−2 for full water splitting (Fig. 10h–j). Using a similar procedure except for the introduction of Fe into ZIF-67, Yuan et al. prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes, which exhibited overpotentials of 268 and 105 mV for OERs and HERs and a smaller cell voltage of 1.605 V, indicating the important role of Fe doping.123
Designing self-supporting electrocatalysts to realize a proper triple-phase interface and boost release of gas is very important for full water splitting. Using a Ni foam as a substrate for the continuous growth of Ni(OH)2 and ZIF-67, Song et al. prepared Co-doped Ni3S2 nanoarrays after hydrothermal vulcanization.124 The 3D trunk-brunch structure could facilitate the diffusion of ions and gases, and the Co-doping induced electronic structure change and lattice distortion of Ni3S2, which could greatly improve the catalytic activity of Ni3S2. As a result, Co–Ni3S2/NF exhibited a low voltage of 1.69 V for full water splitting at 50 mA cm−2.
By assembling 2D Ni-doped Co-MOFs on carbon cloth (CC), Chen et al. prepared defect-rich Ni–Co–S nanosheet arrays on CC by calcination and sulfurization processes (Fig. 11a).125 DFT calcinations indicated that more electrons accumulated at the Ni-site of Ni–Co–S and DOS of Ni–Co–S increased, demonstrating a faster electron release and transfer during the electrochemical process (Fig. 11b–d). In addition, the free energy of hydrogen adsorption is smaller after Ni-doping, indicating a more advanced electronic structure (Fig. 11e). Moreover, Ni–Co–S had a larger water adsorption energy, which could boost its HER and OER performance (Fig. 11f). Due to the above-mentioned factors, Ni–Co–S exhibited low overpotentials of 110 mV and 270 mV for HERs and OERs respectively, and a small cell voltage of 1.62 V was achieved for overall water splitting at 10 mA cm−2.

The interface effect and nanostructure effect of the CoS2–MoS2 catalyst were revealed by Li and coworkers, where an etching strategy and sulfurization process was used to prepare CoS2–MoS2 hetero-nanosheet arrays supported on a Ti foil using ZIF-67 as the precursor (Fig. 11g).126 There were abundant heterointerfaces in the nanosheet arrays and due to the different work functions of MoS2 and CoS2, a Schottky barrier could be formed between the two species, which realized self-driven electron injection from CoS2 to MoS2, therefore optimizing the electronic modulation of the composite catalyst (Fig. 11h and i). The 2D hollow arrays could further provide more surface-active sites and facilitate the release of gas bubbles. In accordance, the CoS2–MoS2 could effectively catalyze water splitting at 1.56 V with a 100% faradaic efficiency, as well as good stability for at least 24 h (Fig. 11k–m).
Molybdenum carbide has been demonstrated as a good HER catalyst due to its similar electronic structure to Pt.127,128 In a recent work, by thermal annealing the mixtures of ZIF-67-derived N, S codoped graphitic carbon-coated Co9S8 (Co9S8-NSC), (NH4)6Mo7O28 and glucose, Luo et al. prepared Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C for overall water splitting.129 The interaction of Co9S8 and Mo2C resulted in a higher Co valence and lower Mo valence in Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C, which could simultaneously improve the OER and HER catalytic activity. Therefore, Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C exhibited small OER and HER overpotentials of 293 and 89 mV in 1.0 M KOH and could effectively drive overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.61 V at 10 mA cm−2.
3.5 Bifunctional electrocatalysts for OERs and ORRs
For rechargeable metal–air batteries, ORRs occur during the discharge process and OERs occur during the charge process. The large overpotentials for both ORRs and OERs greatly reduce the working voltage and round-trip efficiency of the batteries. Therefore, the development of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is very important for the practical application of metal–air batteries. Due to the high OER activity of TMSs and high ORR performance of heteroatom-doped porous carbon, it is very attractive to integrate the two components together to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts for both OERs and ORRs.130–132
Using ZnCo-ZIF as the precursor and S powder as the S source, Li et al. prepared Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in a N, S co-doped carbon matrix (Co9S8@NSCM).133 The in situ formation of Co9S8 could guarantee a strong interaction between the carbon framework and Co9S8 to optimize the synergetic effect of the two species. As a result, Co9S8@NSCM displayed a half-wave potential of 0.81 V for ORRs and a low overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm−2 for OERs, demonstrating its bifunctional activity. In another work, by designing 2D Co-MOFs with dual ligands that contained S, N and O elements, Zhao et al. prepared S, N and O-tridoped carbon-encapsulated Co9S8 (Co9S8@TDC).134 Due to the high intrinsic activity of the heteroatom-doped carbon shell and Co9S8 nanoparticles, optimized Co9S8@TDC-900 exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.78 V for ORRs and 330 mV overpotential for OERs (Table 4). In addition, the Co9S8@TDC-900-based Zn–air battery displayed an open circuit voltage of 1.50 V and a peak power density of 101.5 mW cm−2, demonstrating its practical application.

The morphology of an electrocatalyst has great effect on its catalytic performance. In a recent work, by changing the solvent and reaction temperatures, Liu et al. synthesized a series of Co-MOFs with different morphologies and transferred them into Co/CoxSy embedded in S, N co-doped carbon (Co/CoxSy@SNC) (Fig. 12a).135 The different morphologies resulted in various specific surface areas and pore structures, as well as different N configurations, as indicated by N2 sorption and XPS measurements. Co/CoxSy@SNCF-800 (derived from 1D fiber) had the largest specific surface area. In addition, pyridinic N and graphitic N are the main N species in Co/CoxSy@SNCF-800 and Co/CoxSy@SNCN-800 (derived from 1D nanorod), while oxidized N is the main N species in Co/CoxSy@SNCS-800 (derived from 2D nanosheet) and Co/CoxSy@SNCB-800 (derived from 3D bulk MOF). Due to the high specific surface area and favorable N species, Co/CoxSy@SNCF-800 exhibited better ORR and OER performance compared with other catalysts (Fig. 12b and c).

In another work, Co9S8 embedded in earthworm-like N, S-doped carbon nanotubes (Co9S8@CT-800) was developed by annealing UiO-66-NH2-confined thiourea and CoCl2 precursors (Fig. 12d).136 Due to the spatial nanoconfinement during the pyrolysis process, Co9S8 was tightly defined in the carbon shell, therefore rapid electron transfer was guaranteed. In addition, many joints with defects were generated in the nanotubes with an earthworm-like nanostructure, which could harvest lots of active sites. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated the comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and good OER performance of 390 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. The DFT calculations indicated that the formation of *OOH is the rate-determining step for both ORRs and OERs, and compared with N-doped graphene without Co9S8, the energy barrier of Co9S8@CT-800 is much smaller, suggesting the synergistic effect of Co9S8 and N-doped carbon.
By introducing Ce ions during the synthesis of Co-ZIFs, the morphology changes from 3D spherical to 2D “senbei”-like shapes, as observed by Sun et al. (Fig. 12e).137 After sequential carbonization and sulfurization processes, 2D “senbei”-like Co9S8/CeO2/Co embedded in N-doped carbon was developed. The Co9S8/CeO2 heterostructure induced strong electron coupling and electron transfer between Co9S8 and CeO2, as indicated by the shift of Co and Ce XPS binding energies. In addition, lots of oxygen defects were formed due to the fast conversion of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in CeO2. When used as an oxygen electrocatalyst for ORRs and OERs, a half-wave potential of 0.875 V and over potential of 1.60 V were achieved, corresponding to a potential gap of 0.725 V, which was much smaller than other electrocatalysts derived from the same precursor.
As stated earlier, metal ion doping could change the d electronic state and band gap of TMSs, thereby improving the catalytic performance of TMSs accordingly. In a recent work, doping-induced enlargement in the lattice constant was observed by Cai and coworkers, where Ni-adsorbed Zn–Co ZIF was used as the precursor followed by carbonization and sulfurization (Fig. 13a).138 The evaporation of Zn at high temperatures could extend the porosity of Co9−xNixS8/NC and ZIF-derived carbon could effectively prevent the aggregation of TMS nanoparticles. In addition, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra indicated that Ni doping could increase the lattice constant and bond length of the Co–S bond, and therefore, enlarge the O–O bonds adsorbed on the Co sites and boost the cleavage of O–O bonds, leading to fast reaction kinetics. Co9−xNixS8/NC exhibited a large half-wave potential of 0.86 V and good OER performance, which resulted in a high open-circuit potential of 1.37 V for a flexible Zn–air battery, and the Zn–air batteries in series could light LED for more than 3 h (Fig. 13b–d).

Constructing metal/metal sulfide and metal oxide/sulfide heterostructures is also a promising method to improve the catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst. After depositing a layer of potassium–tannic acid (K–TA) on the surface of ZIF-8 followed by the ion-exchange reaction of K+ with Co2+, Guo et al. prepared ZIF-8@Co-TA and transferred ZIF-8@Co-TA into S, N co-doped carbon-encapsulated Co@CoS2 nanoparticles (Co@CoS2@S/N-HCC).139 Due to the high electrical conductivity provided by S, N co-doped carbon and the synergy of metal and metal sulfide species, Co@CoS2@S/N-HCC exhibited good bifunctional catalytic activity for both ORRs and OERs. By stirring the mixtures of H3PW12O40 and ZIF-67, PW12@ZIF-67 was obtained and transferred into carbon-coated CoWO4/WS2 (Fig. 13e).140 In addition, the H3PW12O40 also acted as an acidic etching agent, leading to the formation of a hierarchical flower-like superstructure. When used as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, CoWO4/WS2@C–N exhibited much superior activity to Pt/C and RuO2. The DFT calculations indicated that CoWO4/WS2 is more powerful for adsorbing O2 compared with CoWO4. In addition, the last electron transfer is the rate-determining step for ORRs and the ORR can proceed at 0.85 V, while the formation of the *OOH intermediate is the rate-determining step for the OER and the downhill potential was observed at 1.63 V, which is in accordance with the experimental results, indicating that CoWO4/WS2 is an ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORRs and OERs (Fig. 13f and g).
In another work, Min et al. prepared Co3O4/CoS heterostructures by oxidizing Co–Co Prussian blue analogs (PBA) at 400 °C and vulcanizing obtained Co3O4 with Na2S at 120 °C (Fig. 13h).141 The DFT calculations indicated that the onset potentials of ORRs and OERs for Co3O4/CoS were 0.35 and 0.47 V, much smaller than those for Co3O4 (−0.4 and 0.78 V) and CoS (−0.73 and 2.34 V) (Fig. 13i–q). In addition, Gibbs free energy results indicated that the coupling of Co3O4 and CoS could facilitate the ad-desorption of reaction intermediates and boost the OER and ORR performance accordingly. Electrochemical measurements of Co3O4/CoS demonstrated a half-wave potential of 0.82 V for ORRs and an overpotential of 349 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OERs. In addition, the Co3O4/CoS-based Zn–air battery delivered a high cell voltage of 1.51 V and a peak power density of 168 mW cm−2, demonstrating its practical applications.
3.6 Self-powered water-splitting based on trifunctional electrocatalysts
The high catalytic activity of TMSs for HERs, OERs and ORRs is illustrated, and overall water-splitting devices and Zn–air batteries are also constructed using bifunctional TMSs. To further demonstrate the various catalytic performances of TMSs, trifunctional electrocatalysts and self-powered water-splitting devices based on Zn–air batteries have been recently developed. Using a ZnS nanorod as a template for the in situ growth of ZIF-67 and PDA coating, Li et al. prepared carbon nanotube-supported Co single atoms and Co9S8 nanoparticles (CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT) (Fig. 14a).142 When used as multiple functional electrocatalysts, the CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT afforded a large half-wave potential of 0.855 V for ORRs, small overpotentials of 330 mV for OERs and 250 mV for HERs at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 14b–d). The DFT calculations indicated that the thermodynamic limiting potentials of all ORR steps that ensure downhill in free energy for Co9S8, CoN4, and CoN4 + Co9S8 are 0.1, 0.68, and 0.88 V, respectively, indicating superior ORR catalytic performance of CoSA + Co9S8/HCNTs (Fig. 14e). Meanwhile, the thermodynamic limiting potentials of OERs are 2.09, 1.91, and 1.76 V for Co9S8, CoN4, and CoN4 + Co9S8 respectively, and the CoN4 + Co9S8 also exhibited smaller hydrogen adsorption free energy, suggesting its intrinsic high catalytic activity (Fig. 14f and g).

In principle, the catalytic performance of an electrocatalyst can be enhanced either by increasing the number of active sites or by improving the intrinsic activity of each active site via electronic structural modification. In a recent work, Zhang et al. prepared a carbon nanofiber-supported Co9S8/MoS2 heterostructure nanoarray using Mo-doped ZIF-8/ZIF-67 as the precursor (Fig. 14h).143 Due to the large specific surface area induced by the evaporation of Zn, the unique 3D nanostructure, and the synergistic effect of Co9S8 and MoS2, the catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.82 V for ORRs and low overpotentials of 340 mV and 160 mV for OERs and HERs at 10 mA cm−2. In addition, the trifunctional electrocatalyst enabled a high power density of 222 mW cm−2 for liquid Zn–air batteries, and the Zn–air batteries could effectively drive overall water splitting (Fig. 14i and j).
4. Conclusions and outlooks
Developing low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts is a promising strategy for the large-scale application of clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems including Zn–air batteries and water-splitting devices. TMSs have gained great research interest owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activities, adjustable electronic structures, diverse components, and morphologies. Generally, the performance of TMSs can be improved by increasing the number of active sites via nanostructure engineering and edge engineering, or by increasing the intrinsic activity of each active site via interface engineering, heteroatom doping and so on. MOFs are ideal precursors for the preparation of TMSs due to their various components including diverse metal anodes and ligands. In addition, MOFs could act as hosts to incorporate guest molecules, which could further introduce metal species that are difficult to coordinate with organic ligands. Moreover, the morphology of MOFs can be readily controlled by changing the synthesis conditions such as solvents and temperatures.
In this review, recent progress of MOF-derived TMSs was summarized based on the applications of TMSs including HERs, OERs, ORRs, overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries. In each section, the preparation methods, structures and electrocatalytic activities were introduced and the possible mechanisms underlying the improved catalytic activity were revealed to give readers an overall comprehension on the progress of the MOF-derived TMSs.
Although great progress has been achieved in the development of MOF-derived TMSs, several major challenges still exist in both the academic and industrial viewpoints, and great breakthroughs can be achieved from the following aspects (Fig. 15):
 Fig. 15  Challenges and opportunities for preparing high-performance TMSs. 
(i) Expending the variety of MOF precursors. It is known that one of the main advantages of MOFs is their diversity, which enables MOFs with various metal centers, ligands, and topologies. However, nowadays, most of the MOFs used to prepare TMSs are based on ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, and the metal centers are usually centered on Ni, Co and Mo, which greatly restrict the development of TMSs. Therefore, it is urgent to expend the variety of MOF precursors to develop new TMSs with more diverse morphologies, components, and favorable electronic structures to boost the catalytic performance. Especially, it is proposed that the introduction of In could promote the reversible oxygen electrode reactions of CoIn2S4 and NiIn2S4.144,145 Therefore, developing In-based sulfides from In-MOFs may be a promising strategy. In addition, the carbon substrate derived from the decomposition of organic ligands in MOFs has been demonstrated to have great effects on the performance of metal sulfides/carbon composites. Nevertheless, most of the works are mainly focused on the N species in the resulting carbon. It should be noted that the O atom is also a heteroatom that has distinctive properties from C. Therefore, the role of O species in carbon can be investigated by designing oxygen-containing ligands in MOFs.
(ii) Revealing real catalytically active species. In order to design more superior catalysts, it is important to reveal the catalytic active sites. Till now, theoretical calculations could predict the catalytic active sites on a large extent by optimizing the proper adsorption model and adsorption energy. However, it should be noted that metal sulfides will undergo phase transformation during the catalytic process, especially under oxidation conditions. For example, metal oxides and hydroxides are usually formed after a time of catalytic reaction. However, most of the theoretical models constructed nowadays are still based on metal sulfides rather than metal sulfides with a layer of metal oxides or hydroxides, which may lead to errors in identifying the real active sites. Therefore, it is important to construct more accurate models to predict the active sites.
(iii) Understanding the catalytic reaction processes and reaction mechanisms. As electrocatalysis reactions take place at the three-phase interface and lots of intermediates are involved in the reaction processes, monitoring the reaction intermediates is essential for the understanding of reaction mechanisms. In situ and operando characterization technologies such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ambient-pressure XPS, and electrochemical mass spectrometry (MS) may be powerful tools and the related investigation is rare.
(iv) Expending the applications of TMSs. Nowadays, most of the investigations about MOF-derived TMSs for electrocatalysis are focused on HERs, ORRs and OERs. It should be noted that TMSs have a similar structure to nitrogenase, and therefore, the exploration of nitrogen reduction reaction catalytic activity of TMSs is also meaningful. In addition, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions, which are also a good strategy for the resource utilization of carbon dioxide, involve electron transfer and hydrogenation processes similar to NRRs, and TMSs may have the potential to activate CO2 and transform it into useful chemical fuels.
(v) Developing more advanced bifunctional or multiple functional electrocatalysts. As stated above, HERs and OERs are involved in overall water splitting and OERs and ORRs are involved in rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Therefore, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts is important to simplify the operating systems to reduce the cost. However, the HER, OER and ORR undergo three different catalytic routes, and the increase in one catalytic performance is always accompanied by a decrease in another catalytic activity, which limited the development of excellent bifunctional catalysts. Recently, it has been proposed that single-atom catalysts could realize almost 100% atom utilization; therefore, decorating highly active precious metal single atoms into TMSs may be a good route to improve the performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts. In addition, high-entropy alloys and compounds have shown great potential in diverse fields owing to their distinctive concept and unique properties. By taking advantage of the metallic diversity of MOFs, it is very attractive to prepare high-entropy metal sulfides from MOFs.
