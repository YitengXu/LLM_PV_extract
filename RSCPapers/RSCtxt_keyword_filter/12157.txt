    , Accepted 31st May 2020First published on 1st June 2020AbstractLow-cost poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and its derivatives have been widely used as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, reports on the use of PEDOT-based HTMs in regular PSCs have been rather limited up till now due to the low solubility of PEDOT in organic solvents. In this work, we report three PEDOT derivatives, namely, PEDOT-C6 (P6), PEDOT-C10 (P10), and PEDOT-C14 (P14), with a simple synthetic process by tailoring the length of the alkyl side-chains, and apply them as dopant-free HTMs in mesoscopic n–i–p structured PSCs. It is revealed that the alkyl side-chain length has a significant impact on the film morphology, hole transport capability, and thus the overall solar cell performance. The devices with P10 afford a champion PCE of 16.2% at one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which is significantly higher compared to those based on P6 (12.1%) and P14 (14.8%) under identical conditions. This has been the highest PCE reported so far for dopant-free PEDOT-based HTMs in conventional PSCs. The greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance observed for the P10-based devices is mainly attributed to the superior film formation property and hole transport capability of P10. Furthermore, the devices utilizing P10 also show excellent ambient stability, retaining 75% of their initial performance at a relative humidity (RH) of 80% after 120 h due to the high moisture resistivity of the HTM. The present work provides a new avenue for further developing low-cost, efficient, and stable HTMs in PSCs in the future.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research attention as one of the most promising next-generation solar cells in the past few years.1–4 Currently, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has soared up to 25.2% from the initial value of 3.8% in 2009,5,6 which is attributed to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer, such as high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and long diffusion length.7–14
Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are essential constituents in the state-of-the-art PSCs to achieve high solar cell performance and high stability. They play important roles in extracting and transporting the photo-generated holes from the perovskite to the selective contact electrode.15,16 Up till now, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been the most widely used HTM in PSCs.17 However, the high-performing PSCs based on such a HTM need hydroscopic p-type dopants, such as lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), due to its low hole mobility.18,19 The incorporation of lithium salts accelerates the degradation of the perovskite layer, which is harmful to the device stability.20–22 Moreover, the complicated multistep synthesis process and tedious purification procedures of spiro-OMeTAD also restrict its potential use from a large-scale application point of view. In this regard, a variety of HTMs have been developed and applied in PSCs, including small molecules, inorganic hole conductors, and conducting polymers.23–36
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is a well-known conductive polymer and has been widely used as a HTM in inverted planar (p–i–n) PSCs, owing to its high transparency, low-production cost, suitable energy levels, and solution processbility.37–39 Impressive progress has been made for inverted PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS, showing excellent PCEs of over 21%.40–44 However, PEDOT:PSS is an aqueous colloidal dispersion, which makes its deposition directly on top of the perovskite absorbers in regular PSCs difficult. Therefore, reports on the use of PEDOT-based HTMs in n–i–p structured PSCs have been limited.45–47 Snaith et al. adopted a specifically formulated PEDOT ink, which is a dispersion of PEDOT and a sulfonated block-co-polymer dispersed in toluene, as a HTM in mesoscopic PSCs.45 The devices incorporating the PEDOT-based HTM achieved a maximum PCE of 14.5% with a stabilized power output of only 6.6%. Hou, Brabec, and coworkers further applied a water-free PEDOT dispersion (Clevios HTL Solar 3) as a HTM in planar PSCs, in which low-temperature processed TiO2 was used as an electron-transporting layer.46 The devices presented a maximum PCE of 11.8% and more than 800 h stability under ambient conditions without encapsulations. The PCE was further improved to 14.2% by reducing the acidity of the PEDOT dispersion. Nevertheless, the performance of PEDOT-based HTMs in regular PSCs has been relatively low to date.
Here, we designed and synthesized three water-free PEDOT derivatives, coded as P6, P10, and P14, by varying the length of the alkyl side-chains and applied them as dopant-free HTMs in mesoscopic n–i–p structured PSCs. The aim of this study is to scrutinize the influence of the alkyl side-chain length on the hole transport property, film morphology, and thus the overall solar cell performance. After optimization, the PSCs utilizing P10 delivered a champion PCE of 16.2% at one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which was considerably higher compared to those based on P6 (12.1%) and P14 (14.8%) under identical conditions. Meanwhile, the P10-based devices also showed excellent stability, retaining 75% of their initial performance under ambient conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of 80% after 120 h, which was much improved compared to those containing doped spiro-OMeTAD.
2. Results and discussion
The three PEDOT derivatives PEDOT-C6 (P6), PEDOT-C10 (P10), and PEDOT-C14 (P14) were prepared by a simple bromine-catalyzed polymerization method as presented in Fig. 1, followed by a hydrazine de-doped process.48 The synthetic details can be found in the ESI.† All the polymers obtained are soluble in commonly used organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene, which makes solution processing of these HTMs on top of the perovskite possible. P10 and P14 exhibit higher solubility compared to P6 due to their longer alkyl side-chains. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was utilized to analyze the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of the polymers as shown in Fig. 2a. The Mn values were determined to be 2.97, 3.49, and 4.04 kg mol−1 with PDIs of 1.60, 1.68, and 1.76 for P6, P10, and P14, respectively.

The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three materials in dichloromethane solutions are plotted in Fig. 2b. No significant difference in the absorption peaks is observed for the three polymers. The maximum absorption peaks for P6 and P10 are located at 510 nm and 512 nm for P14, respectively. The bandgaps are calculated to be 1.67 eV for P6 and 1.66 eV for P10 and P14, according to the formula: Eg = 1240/λedge (Eg stands for the bandgap and λedge is the absorption edge of the UV-Vis spectra). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers as shown in Fig. 2c. The decomposition temperatures (Td) are determined to be 246 °C, 248 °C, and 252 °C for P6, P10, and P14, respectively.
Hole mobility measurements were performed for the three polymers using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method as displayed in Fig. 2d and Table 1. P10 exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 among the three polymers, whereas the corresponding values were determined to be 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P6 and 0.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P14. For comparison, the hole mobility of pristine spiro-OMeTAD was also tested and was estimated to be 0.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The relatively high hole mobility makes these three polymers suitable as dopant-free HTMs to be tested in PSCs.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out to evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the polymers as depicted in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.17 eV for P6 and P10, and −5.15 eV for P14, according to the equation φ = 21.21 − (Ecutoff − Ei). Thus, the HOMO energy levels of these three PEDOT derivatives are more positive than the valence band (VB) of the mixed-ion perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−5.65 eV), indicating that they are capable of extracting the photo-generated holes from the latter.49 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of these three materials are determined to be −3.50 eV, −3.51 eV, and −3.49 eV for P6, P10, and P14, respectively, based on the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgaps. All the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of these three polymers are listed in Table 1.

The three PEDOT derivatives were further evaluated as dopant-free HTMs in mesoscopic PSCs based on a configuration of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. The energy level diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of PSCs are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The mixed-ion perovskite crystals are penetrated into the mesoporous TiO2 layer (∼150 nm) and formed a uniform capping layer with a thickness of ∼600 nm. The HTM layer (∼20 nm) is spin-casted atop the perovskite absorber, and then a layer of ∼80 nm gold is thermally evaporated as the back contact electrode.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs based on different HTMs measured at 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) are presented in Fig. 4c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The devices utilizing P10 show the highest PCE of 16.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.3 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65. Inferior photovoltaic performance is observed for the other two HTMs, in particular for P6. The corresponding PCEs of the devices containing P6 and P14 are 12.1% (Voc = 0.93 V, Jsc = 22.4 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58) and 14.8% (Voc = 1.07 V, Jsc = 20.8 mA cm−2, FF = 0.67).

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were implemented for PSCs using different polymeric HTMs as presented in Fig. 4d. Higher IPCE values can be observed for the devices based on P6 and P10 with a maximum value of up to ∼88%. The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE spectra are estimated to be 21.1 mA cm−2 for P6, 22.0 mA cm−2 for P10, and 18.7 mA cm−2 for P14, which are in good agreement with the results obtained from the J–V measurements. The J–V hysteresis effect of PSCs incorporating these three polymeric HTMs was examined as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†). The devices with P10 present the smallest hysteresis index (0.080) compared to those with P6 (0.189) and P14 (0.099).50 The reduced hysteresis index observed for P10-based devices should be largely attributed to the relatively high hole transport property of P10 associated with efficient hole transfer and minimized charge accumulation at the perovskite/HTM interface.51,52 To verify the efficiencies obtained from the J–V measurements, we measured the steady-state photocurrent output of PSCs based on these three HTMs at the maximum power point for 200 s under one sun illumination as displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the corresponding stabilized PCEs are presented in Fig. 4e. The devices with P10 exhibit the highest steady-state efficiency (15.5%) relative to those based on P6 (10.8%) and P14 (13.1%). These results agree well with the PCE values obtained from the J–V measurements. The reproducibility of the devices based on these three HTMs was evaluated on the basis of 20 identical devices as shown in Fig. 4f. The average PCEs are calculated to be 11.4% ± 0.3%, 15.4% ± 0.5% and 13.8% ± 0.5%, respectively.
The surface morphology of a HTM atop the perovskite layer plays an essential role in governing the interfacial charge recombination losses and thus the overall solar cell efficiency. In order to gain insights into the origin of the different photovoltaic performance observed for these three HTMs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) were carried out to study the surface morphology and roughness of the perovskite films with and without HTMs as presented in Fig. 5. The top-view SEM image of the bare perovskite film is quite uniform consisting of 200–300 nm diameter crystals (Fig. 5a). However, the top-view SEM images of these three HTMs on top of the perovskite layer are quite distinct as exhibited in Fig. 5b–d. A lot of pinholes are found for P6, which cannot fully cover the surface of the perovskite layer. In contrast, P10 and P14 films exhibit high uniformity and good coverage atop the perovskite layer. The poor uniformity of P6 should be most likely attributed to its relatively lower solubility. As the alkyl side-chain length increases, the solubility of P10 and P14 is improved, which in turn facilitates the film formation property. Fig. 5e–h display the AFM images of the perovskite films with and without HTMs. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite surface decreases from 25.0 nm (Fig. 5e) to 20.8 nm for P6 (Fig. 5f), 18.2 nm for P10 (Fig. 5g), and 17.3 nm for P14 (Fig. 5h). The smoother and denser films observed for P10 and P14 are strongly correlated with their relatively higher solubility originating from the increase of the alkyl side-chain length as discussed above. The uniformity of the HTM capping layer on top of the perovskite layer has a significant impact on the charge recombination losses at the perovskite/HTM interface and thus the overall solar cell performance. More homogeneous P10 and P14 capping layers can effectively prevent direct contact between the perovskite and the Au electrode.53 This will mitigate the interfacial charge recombination losses, which explains the higher Voc and FF observed for the devices with P10 and P14.

To elucidate the hole extraction capability of the three HTMs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted for the samples composed of glass/perovskite with or without the HTM capping layer. As presented in Fig. 6a, it clearly shows that the presence of the HTMs significantly quenches the PL intensity. The samples with P10 show the strongest quenching ability, indicating that the interfacial hole transfer is the most efficient for this polymer. It is also notable that the samples with P14 present the weakest quenching capability, strongly correlated with its longest alkyl side-chains, which may hamper the intermolecular interaction and the hole transfer and hopping. This may explain the decreased Jsc value obtained for the P14-based devices as compared to those with P10, resulting in a relatively lower overall PCE for the former. Consequently, P10 also shows the fastest PL decay rate among the samples tested, which is in line with the steady-state PL results. The average PL lifetimes are estimated to be 24.3 ns for P6, 18.1 ns for P10, and 29.5 ns for P14 on the basis of a bi-exponential fitting, the results of which are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Overall, the PL results demonstrate that P10 shows the strongest hole extraction capability among the three HTMs, which accounts for the enhanced Jsc value obtained for the devices with P10.

Finally, the stability of un-encapsulated devices with P10 was monitored for 120 h under ambient conditions in the dark (∼80% RH, 20 °C). For comparison, the stability values of PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD doped with Li-TFSI, TBP, and the cobalt(III) complex FK209 were also tested under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the devices with P10 exhibited good long-term stability, retaining 75% of their initial performance during the testing period. In contrast, only 30% initial efficiency was left for those containing spiro-OMeTAD. As presented in Fig. 7c, the spiro-OMeTAD-based devices exhibit a clear color change from dark brown to yellow, indicative of the decomposition of the perovskite. We further evaluated the water resistance of pristine P10 and doped spiro-OMeTAD films. As displayed in Fig. 7d, P10 presents a larger water contact angle of 105.5° relative to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (74.0°), suggesting the high moisture resistivity of P10. Therefore, the much improved ambient stability observed for P10-based devices should be strongly linked to the strong hydrophobic nature of P10, which can effectively prevent the moisture from destroying the perovskite film.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed three PEDOT derivatives P6, P10, and P14 as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs by varying the length of the alkyl side-chains. The influence of the alkyl side-chain length on the hole transport property, film morphology, and the overall solar cell performance was systematically investigated. The devices utilizing P10 delivered a champion PCE of 16.2% at one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which was substantially higher compared to those with P6 (12.1%) and P14 (14.8%). The greatly improved photovoltaic performance observed for P10-based devices is largely ascribed to the collective effect of uniform film formation and efficient hole transport capability. Moreover, the P10-based devices also presented excellent long-term stability, retaining 75% of their initial performance under ambient conditions with an RH of 80% after 120 h, which was much improved relative to those with doped spiro-OMeTAD. This work demonstrates a new design strategy for developing cost-effective and stable HTMs in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
All solvents and chemicals were used as received, including PbI2 (>98% TCI), PbBr2 (>98% TCI), formamidinium iodide (FAI, xi’an pol), methylammonium bromide (MABr, xi’an pol), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) 75% in isopropanol (Tiacac, Sigma-Aldrich), and TiO2 paste (18NR-T, Dyesol).
4.2. Device fabrication
The PSC devices were fabricated as reported previously.32,54 The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) was sequentially cleaned by using detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and ethanol. A compact TiO2 layer was coated on the FTO substrates through spray pyrolysis deposition at 450 °C. The precursor solution was prepared by diluting titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1:9, v/v) and then heating at 500 °C for 30 min in air. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating of the TiO2 paste (18NR-T, Dyesol) diluted in anhydrous ethanol at a ratio of 1:6 by weight at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The layers were then annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite solution (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 was prepared by dissolving FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in a mixed solution of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1, v/v). The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter before use. The perovskite films were prepared using a one-step spin-coating method at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 4000 rpm for 30 s. In the second step, 130 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrates at 15 s prior to the end of the program. The perovskite films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. When the films were cooled down to room temperature, the HTM layer was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films at a speed of 1800 rpm for 30 s. The dopant-free polymeric HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving 7 mg of P6, P10, and P14 in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was composed of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 30 μL FK209 Co(III)TFSI (tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) solution (300 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile), and 18 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, an 80 nm thick gold electrode was covered on the surface by vacuum evaporation.
4.3. Characterizations

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend™ 500 NMR apparatus. Chemical shifts were calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. The UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements were performed using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was implemented using a thermal gravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH TG209, Germany) under N2 from 50 °C to 480 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1. The molecular weights and polydispersity indexes of the polymers were determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at room temperature with THF as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 on an Agilent 1260 instrument coupled with an Agilent RI detector and equipped with four PL gel columns. The HOMO energy levels of the PEDOT films were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with a photon energy of 21.2 V. A sample bias of 5.0 V was applied to observe the secondary electron cut-off edge. The surface morphology images of the perovskite films without and with HTMs were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8220) and atomic force microscopy (Dimension ICON, Bruker, Germany). Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a SpectraPro-2300i spectrometer (Acton Research Co., USA). The stability test was carried out using a humidity chamber at a constant temperature (BPS-100CL, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd, China).
The hole mobility of HTMs was measured by using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. For the hole-only devices, SCLC is described as J(V) = 9εε0μV2/8d3, where ε is the dielectric constant of the material (normally taken to approach 3 for organic semiconductors), μ is the hole mobility, V is the applied bias, and d is the film thickness.32
The J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source-Measure Unit under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) offered by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Newport USA, Model: 94023A) with an AM 1.5 filter (active area: 0.10 cm2). Before the measurement, a Newport calibrated standard Si reference cell (SER. No: 506/0358) was used to calibrate the light intensity. The J–V curves were obtained from forward bias to short-circuit at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1. For the measurements of the hysteresis, the J–V curves were obtained through forward scan (0–1.25 V) or reverse scan (1.25–0 V) at a rate of 10 mV s−1. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a Newport TLS-300XR IPCE/QE measurement kit. A standard silicon cell was used as the reference.
