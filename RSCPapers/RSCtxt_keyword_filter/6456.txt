    , Accepted 25th July 2022First published on 26th July 2022AbstractThe low-cost and environment-friendly solvent processing in organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical for commercial applications. Herein, we selected the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) terpolymers (PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5) as the low-cost polymer donors and the small molecular semiconductor IT-4F as the acceptor to fabricate the OSCs using non-halogenated o-xylene (o-XY) as the processing solvent of the active layer. While introducing the 3-(ethyl carboxylate)thiophene (Th) unit as the third comonomer, terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 exhibited good solubilities in the non-halogenated solvents such as o-XY and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these devices based on PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) reached up to 11.70%, which are comparable with the devices processed from the chlorinated and toxic chlorobenzene (CB) solvent. However, the alternating polymer PBDF4F-based device only had a PCE of 3.32% while processing using the o-XY solvent due to its limited solubility. Furthermore, layer-by-layer devices were also fabricated via the sequential processing steps by dissolving PBDF4F-Th2 (or PBDF4F-Th5) into o-XY and IT-4F into THF. The PCE of 11.19% was obtained from the PBDF4F-Th5/IT-4F device. The high photovoltaic performance in these BDF terpolymer-based OSCs using non-toxic and environment-friendly non-halogenated solvents indicates that the ternary polymerization strategy is an effective route to develop low-cost and efficient BDF polymer donors that can be processed from halogen-free solvents via a simple processing technology.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with the advantages of being low-cost, light-weight, flexible and capable of large-area printing or roll-to-roll processing have received significant consideration as potential alternatives of silicon-based solar cells.1–4 With the synergic optimization of new electron-donor/acceptor materials and device engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been pushed to over 18%, showing a great promise for practical applications.5–9 These state-of-the-art light-harvesting layers in OSCs are mostly processed from halogenated solvents (such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB)) due to their good solubilities to polymer donors and small molecular acceptors, which form the preferred blend morphology.10–14 However, these halogenated solvents are highly toxic and volatile. The use of halogenated solvents in OSCs will produce negative effects on the environment and human health, particularly during the large-area printing and roll-to-roll fabrication, making them unsuitable for industrial production.15,16
Seeking a non-halogenated solvent to process the light-harvesting layer of OSCs will be an ideal alternative to overcome the negative issues of halogenated solvents.17–21 One major obstacle in the use of non-halogenated solvents is their limited solubilities to the polymer donors and small molecular acceptors.21,22 The strong π–π aggregation in these donor and acceptor materials blocks the complete dissolution of the molecular chains into the non-halogen solvent, resulting in the unfavorable blend morphology and poor photovoltaic performance of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. In order to address the solubility issue, a few strategies in terms of materials design and BHJ layer optimization have been adopted with the aim of achieving the high photovoltaic performance while processing the BHJ layer using the non-halogen solvent.23–26 For example, prolonging the length of the flexible carbon side chains in either the donor or acceptor could increase the solubilities in the non-halogen solvent, but the elongated side chain may affect the molecular stacking and blend miscibility.27–30 Another strategy is to introduce the oligoethylene glycol side chains into either the polymer (i.e. poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-benzotriazole) or acceptor (i.e. Y6) to improve the solubilities in non-halogenated solvents.15,31,32 Recent efforts demonstrated that the introduction of third components to break the strong intermolecular interactions of the polymer donor and acceptor in ternary or quaternary BHJ films to ensure their processibility from the non-halogenated solvent also provides an effective way to obtain the promising photovoltaic performance of OSCs.33 The results showed that in order to be processed from the non-halogenated solvents, both the polymer donor and acceptor should afford enough solubility, and in addition, it also needs to form a favorable blend morphology and phase separation in the bicontinuous interpenetrated BHJ layer during the film deposition.34,35 Instead of relying on a trial-and-error method to screen the polymers for an efficient non-halogenated solvent processing OSCs, a better understanding in finely tuning the solubility and film morphology in terms of polymer donor design is therefore highly needed.
Herein, we apply the ternary polymerization strategy by incorporating a 3-(ethyl carboxylate)thiophene (Th) unit into the main chain of poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-co-benzotriazole) polymer (PBDF4F) to regulate their solubilities in non-halogenated solvents and the molecular packing behavior of the terpolymers. By controlling the molar feeding ratio, two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF)-based terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 were synthesized. It is known that BDF polymers possess a more planar and rigid structure as well as a lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level compared with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bithiophene polymers,36–39 and in addition, the furan raw material of the BDF unit can also be obtained from various bio-renewable sources, such as corn, leaves and oat hulls.40–42 These make BDF polymers very promising candidates for developing low-cost and highly efficient OSCs. However, most of BDF polymers (i.e. PBDF4F) only have good solubilities in chlorinated CF and CB solvents and only provide the state-of-the-art photovoltaic performance while processing from these chlorinated solvents.43 However, after introducing the Th comonomer, terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 exhibit satisfied solubilities in non-halogenated solvents such as o-xylene (o-XY) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) for BHJ layer processing. The non-fullerene OSCs with IT-4F as the electron acceptor were fabricated using o-XY as the non-halogen processing solvent of the BHJ layer. The OSCs based on PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F achieved the PCEs of 10.94% and 11.70%, respectively, whereas the PBDF4F:IT-4F device only possessed a PCE of 3.32%. The PCEs of the PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F devices are also comparable or even better than the PCEs (11.20% and 11.14%) that were processed from chlorinated CB solutions. The improved photovoltaic performances of the terpolymer-based OSCs processed from o-XY are mainly due to the formation of the favorable blend morphologies and phase separations in the nanoscale interpenetrating network of the BHJ layer as a result of the enhanced solubilities in o-XY. The charge generation and transport behaviors as well as the miscibility were also investigated to further understand the improved photovoltaic performances. Furthermore, by utilizing the improved solubilities of PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 in the o-XY solvent, the layer-by-layer (LBL) OSCs based on these two terpolymers were also fabricated. The PCEs of LBL OSCs of PBDF4F-Th2/IT-4F and PBDF4F-Th5/IT-4F reached up to 11.19% and 10.79%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the ternary polymerization is an effective strategy in developing high performance BDF polymers with the capability of processing the BHJ layer of OSC from the non-halogenated solvent, and also provides a kind of donor polymer for the non-toxic and environment-friendly large-area processing of OSCs.
Result and discussion
In the terpolymer design, the ethyl thiophene-3-carboxylate unit was selected as the third comonomer and copolymerized into the poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-co-benzotriazole) (PBDF4F) main chain. As shown in Fig. 1a, the terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 have 20 mol% and 50 mol% of Th units, respectively, compared to that of PBDF-4F under the ternary polymerization strategy. Polymers PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 were synthesized by controlling the amount of the Th unit through Stille polymerization according to previous reports.43,44 After introducing the Th unit, terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 exhibit good solubilities in non-halogenated solvents, such as toluene and o-XY, while PBDF4F has a limited solubility in these non-halogenated solvents. These significantly improved solubilities of PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 will therefore facilitate the OSC fabrication using non-toxic and halogen-free solvents. Fig. 1b shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of polymers PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 in o-XY processed films. The terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 exhibit slightly blue-shifted absorption spectra compared to PBDF4F.43 The 0–0 absorption peaks of PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 are located at 592 nm, 583 nm and 577 nm, respectively. The absorption edge of PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 are at 642 nm, 633 nm and 629 nm, respectively, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.93 eV, 1.96 eV and 1.97 eV, respectively. It also shows that the intensity of the 0–0 absorption peak becomes relatively stronger compared to the 0–1 absorption peak with the increase of the Th unit in these polymers, implying the formation of more ordered polymer chains during the film deposition as a result of improved solubilities in o-XY.20,45,46 The absorption spectra of IT-4F, which is selected as the electron acceptor (Fig. 1a), is also shown in Fig. 1b which shows the complementary absorption coverage between the polymer and IT-4F in the region of 400–800 nm, expecting a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) in the OSC.

The energy levels of PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2, PBDF4F-Th5 and IT-4F as well as other related materials are listed in Fig. 1c. Due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the Th comonomer, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 are around 0.06 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively, which are lower than those of PBDF4F. The lower-lying HOMO energy levels in PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 are conducive to the higher Voc values of the OSC. Similarly, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 are also gradually downshifted compared to that of PBDF4F. However, compared to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IT-4F, both terpolymers still have enough HOMO and LUMO energy level offsets with IT-4F for an efficient exciton dissociation.
The photovoltaic performances of terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 with IT-4F as the non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) were characterized by an inverted device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag, in which PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F were dissolved into o-XY. The optimized donor/acceptor blend weight ratio is 1:1.5 with a total concentration of 16–20 mg mL−1. The detailed device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 2a, and the detailed device performances are summarized in Table 1. The PCE of the PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) device processed from the o-XY solution exhibited a PCE of 10.94% with a Voc of 0.836 V, a Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.53%, whereas the PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) device possessed a promising PCE of 11.70% with a higher Voc of 0.883 V, a higher Jsc of 20.90 mA cm−2 and an FF of 63.39%. The PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device processed from the o-XY solvent was also fabricated for comparison. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the PCE of the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device was only 3.32% with a much lower Voc, Jsc and FF compared to that of PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 based devices. The lower efficiency in the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device is mainly ascribed to the limited solubility of PBDF4F in the o-XY solvent, which formed a large phase separation during spin-coating. It can be seen that the improved photovoltaic performance in PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices compared to the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device are contributed by the simultaneously increased Voc, Jsc and FF. The increased Vocs in PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 devices are in good agreement with their low-lying HOMO energy levels. It is noted that the Voc in the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device was also negatively affected by the large phase separation in the film besides the energy level difference.47,48 The improved Jsc and FF in PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices are due to the formation of a more favorable film morphology during the film deposition as a result of the improved solubilities of the terpolymers in the o-XY solvent. In addition, the devices of these three polymers processed from the chlorinated CB solvent were also fabricated for a more direct comparison with o-XY processed devices, and their J–V curves and device data are shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, respectively. The PCEs of PBDF4F:IT-4F(CB), PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(CB) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(CB) devices are 10.17%, 11.20% and 11.14%, respectively. For the PBDF4F:IT-4F(CB) device, it can be seen that Voc, Jsc and FF were increased largely compared to that of the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device, which is due to the better solubility of PBDF4F in the CB solvent and therefore resulted to a higher PCE than that device from the o-XY solution (Fig. 2c). For PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(CB) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(CB) devices, the similar optimized photovoltaic performances compared to the devices processed from o-XY solution were obtained (Fig. 2c), indicating the insensitivity to the processing solvent.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PBDF4F, PBDF4F-Th2, and PBDF4F-Th5-based devices processed from the o-XY solution are displayed in Fig. 2d. All devices had the broad photoresponse at 300–800 nm due to the contribution of the polymer and IT-4F. As expected, the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device exhibited a very weak photoresponse with EQE values below ∼40% in the entire range, which is consistent with the measured low Jsc while processing from o-XY solution. In contrast, a strong photoresponse with EQE values of up to ∼80% in both PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices was obtained. The integrated Jscs from the EQE curves of PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices also agreed well with the values from the J–V measurements. From Fig. 2d, it also shows that the slightly higher Jsc in the PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) device than the PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) device is mainly from the IT-4F.
To gain more insight on the charge generation and exciton dissociation of the terpolymer-based devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) of both devices were measured against the effective voltage (Veff), and their curves are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Jph is defined as the short current density difference under illumination and in dark. Veff is the difference between the applied voltage and the voltage at Jph = 0.49 The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and exciton collection probability (Pcoll) are calculated from the equation Pdiss = Jph/Jsat and Pcoll = Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power conditions, respectively. In the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) devices, Jph is strongly dependent on Veff, and Jph was not saturated even at Veff exceeding 2 V, which can be attributed to the frequent recombination and insufficient transport ability. In contrast, Jph in both PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices reached the saturation status at the lower Veff of ∼1 V, suggesting minimal charge recombination at higher applied voltages. Compared to PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device, both PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices also achieved the higher saturation current (Jsat), indicating the higher exciton generation rate. The PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device had an extremely low Pdiss of 43.45% and a low Pcoll of 30.65%, which can therefore explain the measured low Jsc and EQE values. Pdiss for the PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) device was estimated to be 87.89% and the calculated Pcoll was 72.54%. The PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) device possessed the highest Pdiss of 90.03% and the highest Pcoll of 73.32% among these devices. These results indicate that terpolymer-based devices processed from the o-XY solution have more efficient exciton generation and dissociation at the donor/acceptor interfaces and more effective charge transport and collection, which correspond to their higher Jscs and PCEs. As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(CB) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(CB) devices had the same trends of Pdiss and Pcoll values in comparison with the devices from the o-XY solution. However, due to the improved solubility of PBDF4F in the CB solvent, the PBDF4F:IT-4F(CB) device is therefore expected to obtain a higher Pdiss and a higher Pcoll than that of the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device.
The charge transport properties of the above devices were further investigated in the hole-only device ITO/PEDOT:PASS/active layer/MoOx/Ag and the electron-only device ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFNBr/Al by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method.50 The hole mobility (μh) and the electron mobility (μe) of the device are calculated from the Mott–Gurney equation in the SCLC region (slope = 2).51 As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device had μh of 1.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh ratio of 3.14. The poor charge carrier mobilities and unbalanced charge transport will lead to serious recombination behavior in the blend and result in low FF and PCE. Regardless, PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices exhibited a higher μh of 8.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a much higher μe of 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher charge carrier mobilities and more balanced μe/μh ratios in PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices than that of the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device is therefore ascribed to the measured FF variations. As expected, while processing from the CB solution, the μh and μe of PBDF4F:IT-4F(CB) device were much improved, whereas the mobilities of PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F devices differ slightly when changing o-XY to CB solvent during the process of active layer formation.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the surface morphologies of the active layers in these terpolymer-based devices.52 As shown in Fig. 3a, the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) blend film exhibited a rough surface with a root mean square (RMS) value of 8.82 nm, indicating that there are formation of large aggregates and interrupted nanophase islands in the blend film which will affect the exciton dissociation and increase the possibility of charge recombination.53 As expected, a more homogeneous surface morphology and nanoscale phase separation were observed in PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) blend films with the RMS values of 5.70 nm and 3.77 nm, respectively. Similarly, PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(CB) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(CB) blend films processed from CB solutions also had a smooth surface with the RMS values of 5.60 nm and 4.30 nm, respectively, which confirm their similar aggregation behavior under different solvent treatments. In contrast, the RMS value of the PBDF4F:IT-4F(CB) blend film decreased to 5.59 nm due to the better solubility in the CB solvent.

The miscibility between the polymer and IT-4F was investigated by measuring the contact angles of the neat and blend films and analyzing using the Flory–Huggins theory.54,55 The contact angles of PBDF4F, PBDF4F-TH2, PBDF4F-Th5 and IT-4F neat films were measured using water and glycerol, and the corresponding contact angle values and the relative Flory–Huggins interaction (χ) parameters are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The χ were calculated from the equation , where K is a constant (K = 1), and γ is the surface tension of polymer donor and IT-4F acceptor. As seen from Table S3 (ESI†), PBDF4F and IT-4F exhibited the highest χ of 1.35, which means poor miscibility and is also the reason for the measured high roughness in the PBDF4F:IT-4F blend film. PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 had a gradually decreased χ with IT-4F, indicating that the terpolymers tend to improve the miscibility of the donor polymer and IT-4F in the active layers which will form appropriate donor–acceptor aggregation phases for the efficient charge separation and suppressed recombination and therefore lead to the improved photovoltaic performances in the o-XY processed OSCs.

As encouraged by the promising photovoltaic performance of PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices and the better solubilities of the terpolymers in the o-XY solvent, the LBL typed OSCs were also fabricated. The LBL OSC processed via the sequential coating of the donor and acceptor through an orthogonal solvent is a more feasible strategy to control the aggregation morphology and construct the favorable vertical phase separation with reduced exciton recombination loss in the active layer.56–58 The LBL OSCs have the device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDF4F-Th2 (or PBDF4F-Th5)/IT-4F/MoOx/Ag (Fig. 5a), in which the PBDF4F-Th2 (or PBDF4F-Th5) layer was processed by the o-XY solution and the IT-4F layer was spin-coated from the THF solution. The detailed device fabrication process is shown in the ESI.† The J–V curves is shown in Fig. 5b, and the device data are summarized in Table 2. The LBL OSCs possessed a similar photovoltaic performance with that of the BHJ OSCs. The LBL device based on PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F achieved a PCE of 11.19% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 19.00 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70.09%. Moreover, the LBL PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F device achieved a PCE of 10.79% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 19.51 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.91%. These promising PCEs in these LBL OSCs processed from non-halogenated solvent provide potential material candidates for the simple and environment-friendly OSC processing technology such as slot-die coating.

Conclusion
The ternary polymerization strategy was introduced into the efficient PBDF4F polymer to regulate their solubilities in halogen-free solvents. With the introduction of the Th unit, the terpolymers PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 exhibit much better solubilities in the non-halogenated solvent o-XY. In addition, the terpolymers also possessed the lower-lying HOMO energy levels as a result of the strong electron-withdrawing properties of the ester group in Th unit. The OSCs were fabricated with the polymer donors and IT-4F acceptor. Due to the limited solubility of PBDF4F in o-XY solvent, the PBDF4F:IT-4F(o-XY) device only provided a PCE of 3.32%. However, the PBDF4F-Th2:IT-4F(o-XY) and PBDF4F-Th5:IT-4F(o-XY) devices had much higher PCEs of 10.94% and 11.70%, respectively, with simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF due to the better solubilities and miscibilities of the terpolymers and IT-4F in the o-XY solvent. The devices based on the terpolymers processed from the CB solution were also fabricated for comparison, which showed comparable device performance with that of o-XY processed devices. The LBL devices based on PBDF4F-Th2 and PBDF4F-Th5 as the donor and IT-4F as the acceptor via the sequential processing were also prepared, and PCEs of up to 11.19% were obtained. The exciton dissociation and collection efficiency as well as the charge carrier mobilities, in combination with the morphological and miscibility characterizations, were investigated and showed the importance of solubilities in forming the favorable nanoscale interpenetrating BHJ active layer for efficient OSCs. The results demonstrate that ternary polymerization provides an effective strategy in designing efficient donor polymers for enabling the environment-friendly solvent-processed OSCs. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the BDF polymers have great potential for low-cost and efficient OSCs through the rational molecular design.
