    , Accepted 12th October 2018First published on 13th October 2018AbstractHole transport material (HTM)-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) have shown much promise because of their excellent stability and low cost. However, the most commonly used three-dimensional (3D) MAPbI3 photoabsorber is ambient-unstable and incompatible with the low-cost mass-production of C-PSCs. Considering the proven operational stability of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, we herein attempt to use a series of new 2D–3D hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites in C-PSCs. We find that the fabricated (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 20, 10, and 6) exhibit extremely improved ambient and photo-stability under 60 day-ambient conditions. The HTM-free C-PSCs with a structure of ITO/C60/(EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1/C retain outstanding power conversion efficiency over 11.88%. Particularly, by tuning the stoichiometry of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 to n = 6, the n6-2D device maintains a long-term stability of 93% under ambient conditions after 2160 hours, a thermal stability of 80% after heating at 80 °C over 100 hours, and a photo-stability of 92% under continuous 1 sun illumination over 300 hours, which are apparently superior to those of the MAPbI3 device (i.e. ambient stability of 73%; thermal stability of 9%; photo-stability of 67% after 83 hours). To the best of our knowledge, our fabricated C-PSC with the 2D–3D halide photoabsorber exhibits the best ambient-air-stable performance among all low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs reported so far.
Introduction
Despite the impressive photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 23%,1,2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are poorly stable under operation, failing by far the market requirements.3–5 Various technological approaches have been proposed to overcome the instability problem,6–14 among which carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) without hole transport materials (HTMs) are arguably the most promising for commercialization applications because of their excellent stability, low cost, high performance and simple manufacturing process.7,15,16 Initial work was performed by Han and colleagues who fabricated HTM-free C-PSCs by infiltrating methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) into a three-layer film configuration of TiO2/ZrO2/C with a PCE of 6.6%.17 Then they achieved an improved PCE of 15.6% by adding ammonium chloride into the perovskite precursor solution.18 Most recently, Wang et al. fabricated HTM-free C-PSCs with a complex mesoporous-structured configuration of TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/C, yielding a highest PCE of 17.02% thus far.19 However, all these TiO2/ZrO2/C or TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/C-based devices require a high-temperature annealing procedure (>400 °C) for the purpose of removing the template in the space layer and carbon layer,9,17–25 which will inevitably increase energy consumption and limit mass production on a flexible or plastic substrate.
Commercial carbon paste exhibits the advantages of high conductivity, low cost, good stability, and a low-temperature process (100 °C), which make it an excellent candidate for the cathode of C-PSCs.26 The photovoltaic performance of paintable C-PSCs with the low-temperature-processed carbon paste as the electrode has rapidly developed from 8.31% in 2014 to 14.38% in 2016, but few C-PSCs exhibited highly efficient and systematic stability matching with that of the stable carbon electrode.26–35 Very recently, we employed C60 as the electron transport layer (ETL) to construct an all-carbon-based PSC with a structure of FTO/C60/MAPbI3/C, achieving a champion PCE of 15.38% and an improved stability (5% of efficiency loss after 480 hours in air and under continuous 1 sun illumination (cutoff UV filter, >420 nm) for 180 hours).36 Note that the existing efficiency decay mainly originates from the degradation of the MAPbI3 photoabsorber itself upon exposure to moisture and/or light.37 Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites such as n-butylammonium lead iodide (BA2PbI4) as promising light absorbers have been introduced into photovoltaics due to their higher moisture resistance far above that of the conventional three-dimensional (3D) counterpart i.e. MAPbI3.8,38–47 The Quasi-2D perovskite device with an inverted structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/(BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13/PCBM/Al was reported to achieve an efficiency of 12.52% (PEDOT:PSS = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate).40 A Cs-2D perovskite device achieved an enhanced PCE of 13.68% with a regular structure of FTO/TiO2/(BA)2Cs3x(MA)3−3xPb4I13/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.45 However, such unencapsulated Quasi-2D perovskite devices cannot avoid suffering from ambient-instability owing to the hygroscopic nature of the used organic HTM layer i.e. PEDOT:PSS or Spiro-OMeTAD,48–51 which are incompatible with the stability requirement of PSCs.
In this research context, there is an excellent route to comprehensively enhance the stability of PSCs by introducing moisture-resistant 2D–3D hybrid perovskites into stable HTM-free C-PSCs. Herein we for the first time use 2D–3D perovskites in a stable HTM-free C-PSC architecture to accommodate all practical requirements including outstanding ambient stability and efficiency. A short carbon-chain cation i.e. EA (EA = ethylammonium, C2H5NH3) is introduced into 3D MAPbI3 to create a 2D component and consequently form a series of new 2D–3D hybrid perovskites with the general formula (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.52,53 It is found that the fabricated (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 20, 10, and 6) exhibit extremely improved ambient and photo-stability as characterized by XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM and image measurements under 60 day-ambient conditions. Further, the HTM-free C-PSCs with the structure of ITO/C60/(EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1/C retain outstanding PCE over 11.88%, which is higher than those of the C-PSCs with 2D–3D hybrid perovskites prepared using longer carbon-chain cations i.e. BA (BA = n-butylammonium, C4H9NH3) and PEA (PEA = phenylethylammonium, C8H9NH3). By tuning the stoichiometry of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 to n = 6, the resultant n6-2D C-PSC device retains a long-term stability of 93% under ambient conditions after 2160 hours, a thermal stability of 80% after continued heating at 80 °C over 100 hours, and a photo-stability of 92% under continuous 1 sun illumination over 300 hours, in which all C-PSCs devices are without any encapsulation. Such outstanding stability of n6-2D C-PSC is apparently superior to that of MAPbI3 C-PSC (ambient stability of 73%; thermal stability of 9%; photo-stability of 67% for 83 hours), which is the best ambient-air-stable performance among those of all low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs.26–36
Results and discussion
The pure 2D perovskite (n = 1), EA2PbI4, was deposited by spin coating the precursor solution containing a stoichiometric ratio of lead iodide (PbI2) and EAI in mixture solutions of DMF and DMSO. Generally, the orientation of 2D materials on flat substrates strongly favors growth where the layers orient parallel to the substrate.54 Fig. S1a† shows the top view SEM image of the EA2PbI4 film, which illustrates the structure of the 2D perovskite tending to crystallize in a direction parallel to the substrate. In the case of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, this trend from X-ray diffraction appears to be true only for the n = 1 compound without MA, where preferential growth along the (110) direction occurs, thus exclusively revealing the (00l) reflections.38 A new XRD peak at 2θ lower than 10° representing the crystallographic planes (002) appears in EA2PbI4 perovskite (Fig. S1b†), which had been observed in 2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites recently reported by Stoumpos et al.55 The observed crystallographic planes (002), (004), (006), and (008) in the EA2PbI4 film similar to the BA2PbI4 film reported by Kanatzidis et al. demonstrate the formation of the pure 2D perovskite.38 The additional low-angle XRD peak as well as the morphology of the EA2PbI4 film demonstrate that the EA cation like BA can facilitate the formation of a 2D perovskite structure. Thus, we add the EA cation into MAPbI3 perovskite with the aim of tuning the dimensions (2D–3D) of perovskites and investigating their thermal, photo- and ambient stability together with photovoltaic performance. Four different hybrid perovskites, i.e. (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = ∞, 20, 10 and 6) were prepared by varying the addition amount of EA into the MAPbI3 precursor solution.
XRD measurements were performed for the mixed dimensional (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films to investigate the crystallinity and dimension of the perovskite nanostructure.56 A similar XRD peak at 2θ lower than 10° can still be observed in the perovskite films i.e. (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 6 and 10) (Fig. 1a), demonstrating the 2D component existing in (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 6 and 10) perovskites.38 Furthermore, the n6 film with more EA content exhibits a stronger intensity XRD peak below 10° than the n10 film, indicating a higher amount of 2D component existing in the n6 film. Note that no signal lower than 10° in the n20 film appears due to the low trace amount of EA. Besides, three other dominant planes are observed at diffraction angles (2θ, Cu Kα) of around 14°, 28° and 32° (Fig. 1a and b), representing the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 crystallographic planes (110), (220) and (310), respectively.57 From zoomed-in XRD patterns in the region of 13°–33°, one can see that the three XRD peaks all shift towards lower angles with the increase of EA content doped in MAPbI3 (from n = ∞ to n = 6). This is because that EA (CH3CH2NH3+) is larger than MA (CH3NH3+),58 and the unit cell expands when MA is replaced by EA. According to Bragg's law, a larger d-spacing would lead to the shift of the diffraction peaks to smaller diffraction angles.57

The red arc indicates the inhomogeneous intensity distribution of the Debye–Scherrer-like ring in (d). 
To probe in-depth the crystalline orientation of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites in thin films, we conducted grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements.39Fig. 1c and d show the GIWAXS patterns of 3D MAPbI3 and n6-2D films. The scattering patterns reveal two major characteristics of perovskite films. The MAPbI3 film exhibits continuous Debye–Scherrer-like diffraction rings along extended arc segments whose positions correspond to those of the dominant peaks in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1a and c).59 The rings actually consist of many isotropically distributed spots, indicating significant randomness in the orientations of the grains within the polycrystalline MAPbI3 film (see Fig. 1c). Conversely, as shown in Fig. 1d, the n6-2D film exhibits Bragg spots along the qz direction located in the red arc of the Debye–Scherrer-like ring,39 which indicates a dramatically preferential orientation of the perovskite grains in parallel to the substrate. The observed Bragg spot in the Debye–Scherrer-like ring verifies the 2D–3D hybrid perovskite structure of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 6) films, well consistent with the result obtained from XRD patterns observed in Fig. 1a. UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films were measured and are shown in Fig. S2a–c.† The absorption intensity slightly decreases with increasing EA content (from n = ∞ to n = 6) in (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (Fig. S2a†). Besides, a blue-shift of the absorbance around 750 nm is observed for the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films varying from n = ∞ to n = 6. The band gap energy derived from UV-Vis absorption spectra increases from 1.57 eV for n = ∞ to 1.61 eV for n = 6 (Fig. S2b†).60 Similarly, The photoluminescence spectra of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (Fig. S2c†) shift from 774 nm for n = ∞ to 768 nm for n = 6, which is consistent with the enlargement of the band gap.55 Thus, the increasing ratio of 2D to 3D in the hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites (n decreasing from ∞ to 6) leads to a slight increase in the bandgap and a decrease in light absorbance.
To further verify the location of the 2D perovskite in the photoabsorber layer, steady-state PL spectra of the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films illuminated from the front and back sides of the films were recorded (Fig. S3†). When n = ∞ or 20, almost no difference in the PL spectra appears in two excitations. Combined with XRD peaks of the n20-2D film over 10° toward low 2θ angle shift, EA cation chains in the n20-2D film are most likely to diffuse into the MAPbI3 matrix. As for n10-2D and n6-2D films, several emission peaks at higher energy from front- and back-side excitations were observed, which can be ascribed to the emission from the perovskite phases with n = 2, 3, 4 and 5.61 Particularly, multiple emission peaks of small n values are more obvious from back-side excitations, also implying that the small-n phases may be majorly located near the substrate side and this is consistent with recently reported work.46
We fabricated HTM-free C-PSC devices using the prepared 2D–3D hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films as photoabsorbers with the structure of ITO/C60/(EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1/C (Fig. 2a). Cross-sectional SEM images show the device configuration of the C-PSCs in Fig. S4a and b.† The carbon layer was fabricated by directly printing a commercial carbon paste on the perovskite layer, similar to the reported carbon layer fabrication procedures.35,36 The thickness of the carbon layer is controlled at about 20 μm to efficiently prevent moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with high crystallinity and full coverage were prepared by spin-coating the EAI·MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct in DMF solution with the diethyl ether dripping method during the process (Fig. 1a and S4b†).62 The as-prepared perovskite layer is ∼500 nm in thickness, which functions as the photoabsorber to harvest enough sunlight and simultaneously ensures efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the C60 ETL and carbon electrode. Fig. 2b shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices measured with both reverse and forward scans under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The MAPbI3-based C-PSC (n = ∞) shows the best PCE of 15.04% under the reverse scan with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.058 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.09 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 61.57%. When n = 20, the champion PCE of the n20-2D device declines to 13.91% under the reverse scan, with a VOC of 1.028 V, a JSC of 22.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.59%. The n6-2D device shows a slightly lower PCE of 11.88% than the n20-2D device, with a VOC of 1.018 V, a JSC of 21.14 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.21%. The decrease in the cell photovoltaic performance of the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with increasing EA content originates from the lower absorption coefficient (Fig. S2a†) and poorer carrier transport of the 2D component,8,38 which is a universal phenomenon in the reported 2D–3D hybrid perovskite system39,41 and is discussed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as below.

The long carbon-chain cations such as BA (C4H9NH3) and PEA (C8H9NH3), which have been demonstrated to be able to form a 2D component perovskite,8,38 are also added into MAPbI3 to prepare 2D–3D hybrid perovskite films (n = 6) for comparison in this work. The photovoltaic performances of these three corresponding 2D–3D hybrid C-PSCs (n = 6) are measured and displayed in Fig. S5 and Table S1.† The 2D-BA device shows a PCE of 10.54% under the reverse scan with a VOC of 1.025 V, a JSC of 19.26 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.38%. The 2D-PEA device demonstrates a poorer PCE of 9.46% under the reverse scan, with a VOC of 1.031 V, a JSC of 18.21 mA cm−2, and a FF of 50.40%. As clear as the sun at noonday, the 2D-EA (n = 6) device shows the best photovoltaic performance PCE, FF and JSC among the three 2D–3D hybrid perovskite-based devices, which might be attributable to easier carrier transport and slighter carrier block of the 2D-EA perovskite component that is prepared using shorter carbon-chain cations.
The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding best-performing C-PSCs with (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 are shown in Fig. 2c. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra are 22.82 mA cm−2 for MAPbI3-based, 22.12 mA cm−2 for n20-2D-based, 21.37 mA cm−2 for n10-2D-based and 20.08 mA cm−2 for n6-2D-based C-PSCs, respectively, which are in good agreement with their counterparts measured from the J–V curves and the blue-shift phenomenon observed in the absorption spectra. The stabilized PCE of the best devices with (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 under maximum power point (MPP) tracking was investigated in Fig. 2d. The best-performing MAPbI3 device achieved a stabilized PCE of 14.87%, with a steady-state current density of 18.59 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.80 V. By comparison, the champion n6-2D device achieved a stabilized PCE of 11.59%, with a stabilized current density of 15.25 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.76 V, which agrees well with the slight hysteresis and the PCE value from the J–V curves.
The reduction in JSC and EQE of C-PSCs can be partly assigned to the slightly lower absorption of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 layers from n = ∞ to n = 6 (Fig. S2a†). EIS measurements and steady-state PL spectra are used to study the internal charge transfer and carrier recombination behaviors in C-PSC devices.63 The Nyquist plots for C-PSC devices based on (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 measured under dark conditions at the applied bias voltage (Vappl) of 0.8 V are shown in Fig. S6a.† The obtained data were fitted by using Z-View software according to a simplified equivalent circuit (Fig. S6b†). Fig. S6a† shows a decreasing diameter of the semi-arc for (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices from n = ∞ to n = 6. This indicates that the recombination resistance (Rrec) of C-PSC devices decreases with more EA content. Additionally, the variations of Rrec with (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices measured under different Vappl are shown in Fig. S6c,†31 which are in agreement with that of Rrec measured under 0.8 V. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded from the front side of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films in Fig. S7.† The PL intensity of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films decreased with increasing amount of EA, manifesting that the non-radiative recombination of excitons increased.64,65 Specifically, according to the results from EIS and PL (Fig. S6 and S7†), the recombination resistance of C-PSC devices decreases with more EA content i.e. < <  <  and the non-radiative recombination of excitons increases as the amount of EA increases. As such, the photovoltaic performance of C-PSC devices based on (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 accordingly decreases with more EA content. Such a photovoltaic performance decrease caused by the 2D perovskite that is introduced into the photoabsorber layer has been reported in published papers.39,41 On the other hand, as evidenced by the GIWAXS map (Fig. 1d) and the steady-state PL spectra from the front and back side illumination (Fig. S3†), the 2D perovskite is shown to be oriented parallel to the substrate and majorly located near the substrate side. Such preferential orientation of 2D–3D hybrid perovskites parallel to the substrate could efficiently prevent the erosion from moisture, thus enhancing the device stability, which is also the focus of our work (see subsequent analysis and discussion).
The ambient stability of the involved four different hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = ∞, 20, 10, and 6) is investigated using SEM, images, XRD and UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements under ambient laboratory conditions (30–80% humidity) for up to 60 days. The SEM images of the as-prepared and air-aged (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films are presented in Fig. 3 and S8.† All four fresh films display a flat surface morphology. Note that many obvious pin-holes are discerned in the MAPbI3 perovskite film (see red circles labelled in Fig. S8a†). The moisture easily enters the interior perovskite through pin-hole sites, which will lead to inferior moisture-tolerance of the MAPbI3 perovskite film. As expected, upon exposure to ambient conditions for 60 days, a great number of grains can be observed, spreading from the original grain boundaries to the whole MAPbI3 film (n = ∞), leading to a rough surface. It is worth noting that the grain boundaries disappear completely. The new emerging little grains originate from the decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite by moisture erosion, which is verified by the strong PbI2 peak in the XRD patterns of the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 film (n = ∞) after exposure to ambient conditions for 60 days (Fig. 4). In contrast, other fresh 2D–3D hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite films (n = 20, 10, and 6) all show a compact and well-covered crystal morphology (Fig. S8b–d†), which can efficiently prevent the erosion from moisture. Obviously, the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 20, 10 and 6) at about 14° also increased dramatically compared to the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 film without EA (n = ∞) i.e. 3D MAPbI3 (Fig. S9†), indicating the higher crystallinity of 2D–3D hybrid perovskites than 3D MAPbI3.66,67 On further comparison of n6-2D, n10-2D and n20-2D films, we found that the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak of the n6-2D film is apparently higher than that of the n20-2D film, but slightly lower than that of the n10-2D film. Herein, it is worth noting that a new diffraction peak of the 2D perovskite at below 10° appears. Such 2D crystallographic orientation existing in the perovskite film facilitates the enhancement of film and cell stability.38,46 For the (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 film (n = 20), the larger crystal perovskites are eroded by moisture, giving rise to smaller crystal particles with more grain boundaries, and the original grain boundaries are still discerned after exposure to ambient conditions for 60 days. The XRD patterns of the n20-2D film also demonstrate the maintenance of the pure perovskite composition without PbI2, indicating that this n20-2D film does not decompose in air after storage for 60 days. Moisture erosion is alleviated in the n10-2D film, and the surface still becomes slightly coarser in air, which is in agreement with XRD patterns. As for the n6-2D film, no obvious changes can be observed after 60 day storage, and it still maintains its initial crystal structure and grain boundaries, which indicates its extremely outstanding film stability. In order to unravel the possible degradation pathways of perovskite films, the XRD patterns of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films as a function of storage time under ambient conditions are displayed in Fig. 4.8 The MAPbI3 film gradually decomposed and started to give rise to a slight signal of PbI2 after 4 day storage in air, and then the intensity of the PbI2 peak increased from 4 to 60 days, which illustrates evident degradation of the MAPbI3 film consistent with the SEM images. However, the XRD patterns of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 20, 10, and 6) remained unchanged in air up to 60 days, in which no PbI2 peak is observed. These results verify that the introduction of a 2D component into a 3D perovskite effectively prevents the 3D perovskite decomposition and improves its film stability.

 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of fresh and air-aged (4, 15, 30 and 60 days) (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films in air with a relative humidity of 30–80%. Asterisks denote the major reflections of PbI2. 

Fig. 5 illustrates the evolution of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films under ambient laboratory conditions (30–80% humidity) for up to 60 days.60 The four fabricated (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films all look uniform and black in appearance. The periphery of the MAPbI3 film becomes ashen on the 7th day, which is the signal of perovskite decomposition. Then, the decomposition of the MAPbI3 film is aggravated upon exposure to air for the 15th day. On the 30th day, the whole surface of the MAPbI3 film turns gray, indicating entire decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite. Finally, on the 60th day, the perovskite decomposition is more serious with emergence of white dots in the MAPbI3 film. The evolution images of the MAPbI3 film agree with the observed increasing PbI2 peak intensity in XRD patterns in air for 60 days. By comparison, the periphery of the n20-2D film becomes slightly ashen since the 15th day, and maintains an almost intact profile of the black perovskite phase on the 60th day. Fortunately, the n6-2D film has no obvious change and maintains the black color over the whole surface after being stored under ambient conditions for 60 days, which further indicates the excellent stability of the n6-2D perovskite in air consistent with the SEM images and XRD patterns.

The corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra recorded for the fresh and air-aged (60 days) (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films are shown in Fig. 6.68 The absorption intensity of the n6-2D film is analogous to that of the fresh film from 500 to 800 nm after 60 day storage, and it decreases less than 4% from 400 to 500 nm (see in Fig. 6a), which indicates no obvious change in the perovskite composition of the n6-2D film in air. The absorption composition of n10-2D and n20-2D films reduces by 17% and 35% from 400 to 500 nm after 60 day storage, respectively (Fig. 6b and c). Such a decrease in absorbance can be arising from the moisture erosion of the 3D component in n10-2D and n20-2D films. The absorption of the MAPbI3 film is remarkably quenched (55% quenching) (Fig. 6d), attributable to serious degradation of the MAPbI3 film consistent with the observed SEM, images and XRD variations. The moisture-resistant property of the 2D perovskite may be attributed to the hydrophobicity of the long EA cation chain and the highly oriented and dense nature of the perovskite film, which prevent direct contact of adventitious water with the perovskite.38

Furthermore, the stability of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices was investigated and is shown in Fig. 7 and 8. We firstly performed long-term stability measurements for C-PSC devices stored in air at room temperature without encapsulation where the ambient relative humidity and room temperature were monitored during the course of the experiments (Fig. 7).69 The cell efficiency was periodically recorded as a function of time for the champion device. It can be evidently observed that (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices exhibit improved environmental stability from n = ∞ to n = 6. The PCE of the n6-2D device still retains 93% of its initial efficiency after storage in air up to 2160 hours (90 days), which is slightly higher than that of the n10-2D one (89%). By contrast, the photovoltaic performance of the MAPbI3 device degrades significantly only with 73% of its peak efficiency after 2160 hours, which indicates the instability of pure 3D MAPbI3 as compared with 2D–3D hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1. Fig. 8a shows the thermal stability of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices without encapsulation at 80 °C under dark conditions.45 The C-PSC devices were continuously heated at 80 °C and their PCEs were periodically examined. The efficiency of the n6-2D device shows excellent thermal stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after being continuously heated for 110 hours. The MAPbI3 device shows inferior thermal stability, and its PCE is 80% of its initial efficiency after a short period of 40 hours and drops sharply to only 8.5% of its initial efficiency after 110 hours, which pales in comparison to that of the n6-2D device. Further, we investigated the photo-stability of the MAPbI3 and n6-2D devices without encapsulation by MPP tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination (without a cutoff UV filter) in air with a relative humidity of 30–80% (Fig. 8b).36 The photovoltaic performance of the n6-2D device varies slightly from the initial values over a 300 hour test period. During the aging process, the efficiency of the n6-2D device still maintains 91.8% of its initial value even after 308 hours. On the contrary, the MAPbI3 device shows an inferior photo-stability behavior. The PCE of the MAPbI3 device drops to 80% in a short testing period of only 58 hours and further to 66.5% of its initial value after 83 hours. All the above stability measurements demonstrate that EA cation-induced 2D–3D hybrid perovskite films possess enhanced air, photo and thermal durability. The C-PSC devices employing the 2D–3D hybrid perovskite photoabsorber with PCEs over 11.88% achieve the best ambient-air-stable performance among those of all low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs reported so far.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the excellent photovoltaic performance with PCEs over 11.88% and superior ambient stability, thermal stability and photo-stability of 2D–3D hybrid (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 C-PSCs. By tuning the stoichiometry of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 to n = 6, the surface quality as well as the ambient and photo-stability of n6-2D (EA)2(MA)5Pb6I19 films are extremely improved. As a consequence, the n6-2D device maintains a long-term stability of 93% under ambient conditions after 90 days, a thermal stability of 80% after continuously heating at 80 °C over 100 hours, and a photo-stability of 92% under continuous 1 sun illumination over 300 hours, far superior to those of the MAPbI3 device. To the best of our knowledge, our fabricated C-PSC with the 2D–3D lead halide photoabsorber exhibits the best ambient-air-stable performance among all low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs reported so far. Our work provides a simple and operational avenue to advance perovskite devices toward commercial applications.
Experimental
Device fabrication

Materials. 
ITO glass substrates (15 Ω cm−2) were purchased from ShenZhen South China Xiang Science & Technology Company Limited. C60 was acquired from Luminescence Technology Corp. PbI2 (99.9985%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. CH3NH3I (MAI, 99%) and CH3CH2NH3I (EAI, 99.5%) were purchased from Dyesol and Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp, respectively. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) was acquired from Aladdin. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. The carbon paste was purchased from Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co. Ltd.


Preparation of the (EA)2PbI4 film. 
The (EA)2PbI4 film was fabricated by spin-coating the (EA)2PbI4 precursor solution in a nitrogen-filled glove box at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The film was dried inside the glove box on a hot plate at a temperature of 100 °C for 10 min.


Preparation of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 precursor solutions. 
Firstly, we obtained the MAPbI3 precursor solution by dissolving 159 mg of CH3NH3I and 461 mg of PbI2 in a mixture of 78 mg of DMSO and 600 mg of DMF. The solution was stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. And the (EA)2PbI4 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 346 mg of CH3CH2NH3I and 461 mg of PbI2 in a mixture of 78 mg of DMSO and 600 mg of DMF, followed by stirring overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Prior to film deposition, the MAPbI3 and (EA)2PbI4 precursor solutions were blended to achieve (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with desired EA contents. For comparison, (BA)2(MA)5Pb6I19 and (PEA)2(MA)5Pb6I19 precursor solutions were also prepared similarly to the above method.


Device fabrication. 
ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in an ultrasonic solvent bath of DI water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 minutes each. After drying with nitrogen gas, the ITO glass substrates were exposed to UV Ozone Surface Treatment for 20 minutes to remove the last trace of organic residues. A thin electron transport layer of C60 (35 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions at 3 × 10−6 Torr with a rate of 0.2 Å s−1.70 The different perovskite precursor solutions were deposited by spin-coating on the C60 films at 4000 rpm for 20 s with dripping of 0.5 ml of diethyl ether during the process for rapid vaporization of DMF. After that, the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to form uniform and dense perovskite films. The carbon electrode was simply deposited under ambient conditions by printing the carbon paste on the perovskite layer followed by drying at room temperature for 30 min and then heating at 100 °C for 30 min. The carbon layer thicknesses were controlled at 20–30 μm to endow the carbon electrode with good electrical conductivity.

Characterization
The photovoltaic performances of PSCs were characterized by measuring the current–voltage curves under AM 1.5 G sunlight with 100 mW cm−2 light output using a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A class, America, calibrated by a Newport reference cell), and the data were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter from 1.5 V to −0.5 V with a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1 and a pre-condition of 0.5 s. The active area of the solar cell is ∼0.07065 cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using an EQE system (Oriel instruments) with a 150 W Xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) as a source of monochromatic light. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were characterized by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS). Photoluminescence spectra were obtained on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 with the wavelength range from 700 nm to 850 nm by excitation at 470 nm. The surface morphologies of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite films and cross-sectional profiles of the fabricated C-PSCs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL J-7800F) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The XRD spectra of (EA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) on a Rigaku D/max-2500 VB2+/PC diffractometer in the 2θ range of 10°–40° at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The photo-stability test at continuous MPP operation under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 was carried out in an ambient atmosphere by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium 400147) to fix the voltage at VMPP and then track the current output. The VMPP at maximum power point was determined from the J–V curves. The EIS measurement was measured by applying a bias of the open-circuit voltage with frequencies ranging from 106 Hz to 1 Hz. GIWAXS characterization was conducted in a vacuum using a Xeuss SAXS-WAXS system with an incident angle of 0.4° and a sample–detector distance of ≈110 mm.
