    First published on 22nd August 2017AbstractThe arguments for converting sunlight and H2O to H2 to provide cleaner fuels and chemicals are very powerful. However, there is still no efficient means of direct solar energy conversion to H2 on a large scale despite a large research effort worldwide. This review describes strategies to develop robust devices which exploit the selectivity of a molecular catalyst but avoids the use of sacrificial electron donors by adsorbing them onto an electrode surface. By assembling the photocathodes with photoanodes, the electrons provided by water oxidation are used to reduce H+ to H2. By separating the functions of light absorption, charge transport and catalysis between the colloidal semiconductor and molecular components, the activity of each can be optimised. However, the complexity of the system requires advanced experimental techniques to evaluate the performance. Current understanding of the factors governing electron transfer across the interface between the semiconductor, dye and catalyst is described and future directions and challenges for this field are outlined.

Introduction
There is enormous pressure to deliver an extremely low cost, emission free, highly efficient and sustainable alternative to H2 production from steam reforming.2 H2 can be used (a) directly as a fuel with an energy density more than 15 times higher than batteries and 3 times higher than petrol or (b) as a feedstock employed in synthesis gas for chemicals or ammonia. The demand can be met with water and sunlight but the scientific community have not yet found an efficient technology that can be used industrially. Whilst electricity from solar cells can be used to drive the water splitting reaction (eqn (1)) in a conventional electrolyser, the reduction of protons (eqn (3)) at the surface of semiconductors is slow so a catalyst, typically Pt, is required. A direct photocatalytic alternative would avoid the fabrication and systems costs required with existing technology. A number of different homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches have been used to split water with sunlight. Most homogeneous systems (e.g. molecular or colloidal photocatalysts in solution) rely on a sacrificial electron donor, D, (typically an amine) which limits the efficiency and stability (Fig. 1A and B) despite their good reaction selectivity.1–4 2H2O ⇌ O2 + H2 ΔE = 1.23 V(1)

The first instance of the use of a light-responsive electrode for the photo-assisted decomposition of water is described in the 1960 paper ‘Decomposition of Water by Light’.5 Interest in photoelectrochemistry was sparked by the 1972 paper of Fujishima and Honda, who reported the use of a TiO2 photoanode in an electrochemical cell to split water into H2 and O2, which coincided with the 1973 oil crisis.6 However, despite the intense research activity from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, progress slowed down considerably until the publication of the seminal paper by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991 on dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.7 The key discovery was than a high-surface-area electrode (rather than high purity single crystals) could be used to dramatically increase the performance. Researchers such as T. J. Meyer, T. E Mallouk and D. Gust, A. L. Moore and T. A. Moore have since developed prototype dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical water splitting systems.8–11
A very different approach was developed by Turner based on direct water electrolysis by a GaInP2/GaAs, p/n tandem solar cell.12,13 This approach exploits the stability of p-type semiconductors (e.g. GaInP2) in strong acid under illumination. The solar cell provides the external bias (300 mV) required for water splitting, due to the non-ideal band edges of the photocathode material. The material processing associated with narrow band gap semiconductors, such as GaP, used in heterogeneous systems are a cost barrier despite promising efficiencies. High purity materials are required because the diffusion of electrons in the p-type material is slow so defects in the semiconductor facilitate charge-recombination rather than separation.
Dye-sensitized photocathodes present opportunities to develop tandem dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) or dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPCs).14,15 Unlike conventional PV devices, light absorption and charge transport are performed by separate materials in DSSCs. Light excitation of the dye (D) leads to the formation of its excited state (D*). D* is sufficiently oxidising to accept and electron from the valence band of the NiO to form the charge separated state D−/NiO(h+). The holes (h+) diffuse through the NiO to a back contact, which is typically glass coated with fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO). A reversible redox shuttle (typically I3−/I− to match the best n-DSSCs) then accepts an electron from the reduced dye (D−) to restore D and transports the electron to the counter electrode where the redox mediator is re-oxidised, delivering charge to the external electric circuit. The relative rates of these elementary processes control the efficiency of each step and have a direct impact on the overall efficiency of the cell.
Rather than a reversible redox mediator, DSPCs contain a catalyst, either in solution, co-adsorbed on the surface or covalently bound to the dye. The working principles are shown in Fig. 2. The semiconductor–dye-catalyst approach has advantages which are similar to those of dye-sensitized solar cells, i.e. it is a versatile system in which the components can be fine-tuned to maximise efficiency and lower the materials and processing costs.16 In efficient molecular solar cells, long term stability above 20 years is feasible because the regeneration of the components is fast. Another advantage of incorporating a photocatalytic system for hydrogen evolution (eqn (3)) into an electrochemical device is that it removes the requirement for sacrificial electron donors, as the electrons are supplied by the circuit (i.e. they are provided by the oxidation reaction, eqn (2), at the photoanode).17,18 Additionally, unlike many homogeneous photocatalytic systems which rely on long-lived excited states, the dye injects charge to the semiconductor rapidly upon excitation and is subsequently returns to the ground state by transferring charge to the catalyst. Providing both these processes are efficient, the fast kinetics means dye degradation is less likely to occur.

(9) Reduction of the catalyst by the reduced dye. (10) Reduction of H+ by the catalyst at the cathode surface. The electrons generated by the water oxidation process pass through the circuit to be consumed in the proton reduction reaction. This photocurrent is recorded to evaluate the Faradaic efficiency of the cell. 
For the last twenty five years, most of the work on photoelectrochemical devices using dyes to absorb light and transparent semiconductors to transport charge has been based on TiO2.8,19,20 However, despite enormous effort worldwide, the photoconversion efficiencies are still modest and progress has been incremental. In 1999 He et al. demonstrated that dye-sensitized NiO electrodes can be used to generate a cathodic current and they reported the first p/n tandem dye-sensitized solar cell shortly after.21,22 In 2012, rather than reducing a reversible iodine-based redox shuttle, Li et al. reported the first dye-sensitized NiO photocathode for reducing protons to H2 so that the solar energy can be stored.23 In 2014, the team reported a tandem cell which generates hydrogen at the NiO photocathode and oxygen at the TiO2 photoanode.24 In principle, a device which incorporates both these electrodes connected in series should be more efficient than a single junction device. Firstly, by converting high energy photons on one electrode and lower energy photons on the other, more light can be converted more efficiently. Secondly, generating hydrogen on one electrode and oxygen on another enables the two gasses to be collected separately. The devices, while complex, enable the core processes of light absorption, charge-separation and catalysis to be optimised individually, rather than relying on one material to do all the work. However, the performance of dye-sensitized photocathodes based on NiO lags behind that of TiO2. This review describes recent developments in the field, the challenges faced and future directions.
A. Requirements for the components
1. The semiconductor
The transparent semiconductor donates electrons to the dye molecules when they are excited by light, replacing the sacrificial donor. It also enables the positive holes to diffuse to the charge-collecting substrate, and provides a solid support for the catalyst. Generally, wide-band gap semiconductors, which only absorb UV light, are more photochemically stable than narrow band gap semiconductors, which absorb visible-NIR light. However, few stable and transparent p-type semiconductors are known and the material most commonly used in photoelectrochemical cells is NiO.25 This is because (1) nanoparticles of NiO can be readily made at reasonably low temperatures, (2) the transparency is sufficiently good so that thin films do not compete with the dye for light and (3) the valence band is only ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer26 (ca. 0.5 V vs. NHE27 in acetonitrile) so electrons are readily donated to photoexcited dye molecules adsorbed on the surface.26 The high surface area is key to adsorbing dye molecules sufficiently to absorb all the incident light. At the same time, the porosity should be sufficient that H+ can enter the pores and H2 can diffuse away quickly.
So far attempts to improve the efficiency of NiO photocathodes have mainly concentrated on variation of dyes and catalysts (or electrolytes in DSSCs). However, less attention has been paid to the effect that the preparation method of the NiO electrodes may have on their photoelectrochemical behaviour. This is surprising since it is to be expected that the structural features of the NiO films, such as morphology and porosity, will greatly affect cell behaviour, at least partly, as a result of charge diffusion through NiO particles to the conducting substrate. A review on the synthesis and properties of NiO used in dye-sensitized solar cells can be found in ref. 25. The results of a benchmarking exercise to compare NiO electrodes prepared in different European laboratories can be found in ref. 28. In that study, which compared NiO electrodes in DSSCs and DSPCs, a crystallite size of at least 20 nm, a film thickness of 1–2 μm and a specific surface area above 40 m2 g−1 was found to give the best performance. A TEM image of particles from an example NiO electrode from this study is shown in Fig. 3. This was prepared by applying a precursor solution (NiCl2 and the tri-block co-polymer F108 (poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)) in ethanol and water) onto conducting glass substrates (Pilkington TEC15, sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1) by doctor blade, followed by annealing in a furnace at 450 °C for 30 minutes.28

Thin layers of an insulating material, such as Al2O3, deposited onto the surface of the NiO can slow down back electron transfer and prevent desorption of the dye from the surface.30,31 This approach has been adopted in DSPECs, for example by depositing Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition between the NiO and the dye,32 or between the catalyst and the dye.33 The former is believed to slow down recombination between holes in NiO and electrons in the reduced dye molecules, whereas the latter is believed to slow down charge recombination between NiO and the catalyst.
Shan et al. replaced NiO with nano-ITO.34 In their system, a macro-nanoporous electrode was prepared from an inverse opal procedure. This is designed with large cavities (Fig. 4) to accommodate long chains of the supramolecular dye-catalyst assembly, maximising loading of the catalyst. Carboxyl-modified polystyrene latex spheres (277 nm diameter) were added to a dispersion of In2O3:Sn (ITO) in ethanol (20 wt%, Evonik Industries) mixed with hydroxypropyl cellulose (8.8 wt% suspension in ethanol) at 1:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio. The paste was then spread on conductive glass using the doctor-blade method, dried and then heated to 450 °C for 30 minutes to obtain ca. 6.5 μm electrodes.

2. The dye
The requirements for the photosensitizer are that the highest molecular orbital is below the valence band edge of NiO so that it is reduced upon excitation. A broad absorption band and high extinction coefficient are required to maximise light harvesting and the anchoring moiety must facilitate electron transfer from the NiO. Most dyes which work well in p-DSCs have an excited state oxidation potential >0.6 V lower than the valence band edge and photoinduced charge separation is extremely rapid.35–38 Generally, dyes which have performed well in p-type DSSCs are applied to DSPCs and these are typically organic dyes, although some ruthenium polypyridyl complexes have been used (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The former have larger absorption coefficients due to favourable π–π* transitions compared to MLCT transitions in metal-based dyes. This enables thinner NiO films to be used. The best photosensitizers have a donor–π–acceptor structure, where the HOMO is positioned close to the anchoring group and the LUMO is positioned away from the NiO surface. The potential energy of the HOMO and LUMO can be modulated by adding electron donating or withdrawing groups accordingly.35,39,40 This push–pull structure is thought to promote charge-separation and slow down charge-recombination by holding the dye anion away from the holes left in the NiO. For example, Nattestad et al. reported photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation using dye sensitized NiO without a “catalyst”. The dye PMI-6T-TPA, showed near unity internal quantum efficiency in p-type DSSC.41 In a DSPC the photocathode generated a photocurrent density of 6 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. NHE.42

The anchoring group must form a stable means of attachment to the semiconductor surface and facilitate rapid charge-transfer upon light absorption by the dye. The stability of the dye adsorbed onto NiO under the conditions of photoelectrocatalysis is a fundamental requirement for obvious reasons. Typically the anchor is a carboxylic acid or phosphonic acid, which has a strong affinity for the metal oxide surface. Soaking the NiO film overnight in a solution of the dye in a medium-polarity solvent is usually sufficient to sensitize the electrodes. There is some debate whether the carboxylate anchor is sufficiently stable in aqueous conditions. Ji et al. reported that their ruthenium dye adsorbed to NiO was stable during a 2.5 hour chronoamperometry experiment in pH 7 phosphate buffer.32 Tong et al. demonstrated that their PMI-6T-TPA dye was chemically stable and remained attached to the NiO for several days under basic or neutral conditions, gradually disappearing over 12 days in 1.0 M HCl.42 Click et al. added hydrophobic side chains to the dye to protect the surface and demonstrated that the “push-double-pull” dye BH4-sensitized NiO was stable in a 1 M HCl solution, whereas a NiO film without the dye corroded.43
The typical surface coverage of the dye on the NiO is ca. 10 nmol cm−2 (note that these values are in moles per active area of the film and thus will vary with film thickness).44–46 These are estimated either from the maximum absorbance of the film and the corresponding molar absorption coefficient of the dye in solution, cyclic voltammetry (integrating the charge under a reversible redox wave), or recording the transmittance of the dye solution before and after immersion of the electrode. Care should be taken with the first method to choose an appropriate solvent since many of the dyes used exhibit charge transfer character and solvatochromic behaviour. Queyriaux et al. demonstrated that the surface coverage is dependent on the number of anchoring groups for a series of ruthenium bipyridyl dyes with phosphonate subsitutents.47
3. The catalyst
An advantage of using molecular catalysts is that the electronic properties can be tuned by varying the ligand substituents. The electron acceptor (e.g. a catalyst or redox mediator) must have a reduction potential more positive than the reduction potential of the dye in order for the dye to be regenerated quickly. If this step is not efficient then charge recombination between the reduced dye and the oxidised NiO will occur and this process is often more rapid in NiO-based devices than with TiO2.14,39 The catalyst must also be capable of undergoing two reduction steps without decomposing. Recent efforts have focused on avoiding noble metal catalysts which could potentially limit scale up of the devices. Instead, first-row transition metals are often used, e.g. Co or Ni (Fig. 6). Care must be taken not to apply too negative potentials to the catalyst or decomposition will occur. One of the challenges in evaluating DSPCs is proving that the molecular catalyst is still intact when the device is operating. In the first example reported, a molecular H2-evolving catalyst Co(dmgBF2)2(H2O)2 (dmg = dimethylglyoximato). was deposited by drop-casting a solution on the surface of a P1-sensitized NiO film.23 The maximum photocurrent density under an applied potential of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl increased from ca. 5 μA cm−2 without the catalyst to ca. 25 μA cm−2 in the presence of the catalyst.
 Fig. 6  Structures of hydrogen evolving catalysts used with dye-sensitized photocathodes so far. 
Castillo et al. screened a number of H2 evolving catalysts in acetonitrile solution in the presence of acid using a NiO film sensitized with a ruthenium complex ([Ru((PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(bpy)2](PF6)2).44 In the presence of cobalt macrocyclic complexes e.g. cobaloxime, a cobalt-tetraaza derivative and cobalt polypyridyl derivatives, the authors observed negligible photocurrent (1–2 μA cm−2). In the presence of two Rh polypyridyl derivatives a photocurrent density of 32 μA cm−2 for [RhIII(dmbpy)2Cl2]+ and up to ca. 80 μA cm−2 for [RhIII(dtBubpy)2Cl2]+ was reported. They attributed the difference in behaviour to the reversibility of the CoII/I couple causing rapid back-electron transfer between the complexes and the oxidised NiO. Instead the irreversibility of the two-electron reduction of the Rh complexes (which is accompanies by the release of the two chloride ligands) should slow down the back electron transfer reaction. The Faradaic yield for the formation of [RhI(dmbpy)2]+ was estimated to be 47% after 1 hour, based on the absorption coefficient of the complex at 546 nm. In the presence of HCOOH, the photocurrent increased and Faradaic yield of the hydride, [RhIII(dtBubpy)2(H)Cl]+ was reported to be 85%. The authors suggested that this species accumulated in solution because there was insufficient driving force from the reduced dye to reduce the hydride which would release H2.
When immobilising the catalyst, it is important that the electronic and steric properties are not negatively altered. Several proposed mechanisms for molecular H2 evolution catalysts involve two catalyst molecules, each delivering one electron each.48,49 There are also a several examples of mononuclear hydrogen evolving catalysts.4,50,51 One of the challenges is transferring the performance from an electrochemical cell to a photoelectrochemical cell.
4. The electrolyte
DSPCs operate in aqueous solution and the pH should affect a number of parameters including the catalytic rate, the redox potential of the dye and the position of the valence band edge and the stability of dye adsorption on the semiconductor surface. Therefore it is important to optimise the electrolyte solution to maximise the photoelectrocatalytic efficiency. Contrasting results when changing the pH have been reported in the literature. Castillo et al. observed a decrease in the photocurrent as the pH was decreased, which they reasoned was due to the shift in the flat band potential of NiO to more positive potentials as the H+ concentration was increased.44 Accumulating H+ at the NiO surface could lower the driving force for electron transfer from the NiO valence band to the photoexcited dye. However, Click et al. observed an increase in photocurrent at lower pH values which they attributed to an increase in the rate of hydrogen production.43 They reasoned that the hydrophobic substituents on their dye shielded the NiO surface from H3O+. Kaeffer et al. reported that the use of chenodeoxycholic acid as a co-adsorbent significantly improved the long term photocurrent stability under constant illumination.45
The choice of buffer can have an effect on the performance and stability of the device. When carboxylic acid anchoring groups are used, acetate buffer may be preferred rather than phosphate23,24,32,52 or sulfate33,42,53 buffer to avoid leaching of the dye from the NiO surface.46 Shan et al. found that their phosphonic acid-linked supramolecular dye-catalyst assembly was more stable on nano-ITO when immersed in (2-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 5.1) compared to acetate buffer (pH 4.5).34
B. Device assembly and evaluation
1. Photocathode assembly
DSPCs are typically self-assembled by immersing the mesoporous electrode overnight in a solution of the dye and/or catalyst, often in an organic solvent. Aggregation of the molecular components is often carefully limited by incorporating substituents with sufficient steric hindrance to promote monolayer coverage. The mesoporous metal oxide electrode can be prepared via a number of routes such as screen printing, spin coating spraying or simply spreading the precursor paste onto the glass substrate and removing the excess with a doctor blade. The semiconductor nanoparticles can be prepared hydrothermally and then suspended in a mixture of viscous solvent, surfactants and often cellulose. Alternatively, sol–gels can be prepared using block co-polymer templates (e.g. P123 or F108, polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide, or polystyrene-block-poly-(2-vinylpyridine)). In both cases, annealing at 400–500 °C removes the organic binders and sinters the particles together, forming a porous and conductive network.
2. Photoelectrochemistry
In order to obtain a true systems efficiency, the measurements should be done in a two-electrode configuration as opposed to a three-electrode electrochemical cell. However, at the proof of concept and optimisation stages, photocathodes are evaluated in a three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration, with Pt as the counter electrode (Fig. 7). The cell is illuminated through the dye-sensitized NiO working electrode. The simplest experiment records the current density (J) output under chopped irradiation conditions, while the potential applied (V) between the working and counter electrode is kept constant. Ideally a lamp simulating the AM1.5 solar spectrum is used for illumination, calibrated to an intensity of 1000 W m−2 for measurements at one-sun intensity. Alternatively, a linear sweep or cyclic voltammetry experiments in the dark and under irradiation reveal the bias potential corresponding to the onset of the photocurrent (which generally corresponds to the valence band edge of the NiO) and any background current due to the NiO electrode itself. The J–V characteristics of DSPC can be sensitive to scan rate, preconditioning of the scan (which potential is applied and for how long), as well as changes occurring after repeated scans.
 Fig. 7  Three electrode photoelectrochemical cell for evaluating dye-sensitized photocathodes. 
The efficiency of the photoelectrode, η, is given by (4)where Pin is the illumination intensity and Pmax is the maximum power output of the solar cell at this light intensity. Jmax and Vmax are the current density and voltage, respectively, at the maximum power point.
Another figure of merit is the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), sometimes also called the external quantum efficiency, which describes how many of the incoming photons at one wavelength are converted to electrons: (5)where JSC is the short-circuit current density, Φ is the photon flux, Pin is the light intensity at a certain wavelength λ, q the elementary charge, and h and c are Planck's constant and speed of light, respectively.
This is less often reported for DSPCs compared to photovoltaic devices, but the spectral response is key to demonstrating that the current output corresponds to the absorption spectrum of the dye. IPCEs are recorded by passing the light from the xenon or halogen lamp through a monochromator and recording the current response. An example is provided in Fig. 8. The photon flux of light incident on the sample is measured with a calibrated photodiode, and measurements are typically made at 10 or 20 nm wavelength intervals between 400 nm and the absorption threshold of the dye. It is important to make sure that the measurement duration for a given wavelength is sufficient for the current to be stabilized (normally 5–10 seconds). The magnitude of the IPCE spectrum depends on how much light is absorbed by the photoelectrode and how much of the absorbed light is converted to charge which is collected: IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)·φinj(λ)·φreg·ηCC(λ)(6)where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency and equal to 1 − 10−A with A being the absorbance of the film; φinj and φreg the quantum yields for electron injection and dye regeneration, respectively; and ηCC the charge-collection efficiency.

The inset shows the absorptivity of the NiO film and the dye attached to NiO (dyed film minus undyed film). Reproduced with permission from ref. 42. 
The choice of applied potential in each experiment affects the current response. Typically, an applied potential is chosen where the photocurrents are maximised and are most stable, whilst avoiding significant changes to the background current. In Table 1, the applied bias ranges between ±0.3 V vs. NHE, which are reasonable as they are between the valence band of NiO and the conduction band position of TiO2. Ultimately the applied bias would be supplied by the photoanode in a tandem cell to drive total light-driven water splitting.23,54 Applying a negative bias (e.g. −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) slows the charge recombination reaction between the photoexcited dye and holes in the NiO.33
Once an appropriate potential has been identified, chronoamperometry experiments are usually performed with chopped light to demonstrate the activity of the photocathode in the light vs. in the dark. A smooth shape and absence of spikes in the photocurrent when the light is switched on is consistent with catalysis. Frequently, transient photocurrents are observed as spikes when the light is switched on (Fig. 9).32,33,55 The transient photocurrent may disappear when a more negative bias is applied. These are a result of accumulated charge carriers at the NiO/electrolyte interface. They may be a result of trapped holes, slow kinetics of proton reduction, slow charge-extraction (high transport resistance), fast charge recombination between the electrons in the catalyst and holes in the NiO or poor diffusion in the pores of the semiconductor. Each of these can be ruled out by careful control reactions and removed by engineering the material or by surface treatment.

Over the last 5 years several proof-of-concept examples of dye-sensitized photocathodes for hydrogen evolution have been reported. These are summarised in Table 1. In each case, the photocurrent densities reported have been on the order of 10's of μA cm−2. Gas chromatography is used to quantify the amount of H2 in the headspace of the photoreactor. Alternatively, Clark electrodes or pressure monitoring has been used. Regular sampling or in-line measurements provide information regarding the stability and kinetics. The Faradaic efficiency is the amount of charge converted to H2 (2 electrons per molecule of H2). While the photocurrent density for these systems falls within a similar order of magnitude, reported values for H2 evolution vary from <10% to >100%. Discrepancies in estimating the Faradaic yields when using the Clark electrode may arise from temperature changes, or, when using a GC, from H2 leaking from the cell or syringe, dark current contribution to hydrogen evolution or errors in calibrating the GC. Calibration is usually performed by electrolysis with a platinum electrode in the photoelectrolysis cell (assuming ideal Faradaic efficiency for the Pt electrode) or by dosing known concentrations of H2 into the GC.
The TON and TOF are key figures of merit that are used to compare DSPCs. The first example reported by Li et al. estimated a turnover number of 2 with respect to the catalyst and 6 with respect to the dye.23 Kamire et al. reported a turnover number for their champion device of 1.5 with respect to the catalyst ([Co(dmgBF2)2(H2O)2]).33 The duration of the experiments typically reported for DSPCs are a few hours and clearly improving the stability is an area which requires significant attention. Reasons for the low TON maybe desorption from the surface or photochemical or electrochemical degradation of the molecular components. Low TON usually accompanies sub-optimal Faradaic efficiency.56
4. Co-Immobilised systems
Initial devices used catalysts in solution or drop cast onto the electrode (Table 1, green). One of the challenges to improving the efficiency is overcoming rapid charge-recombination between holes in the NiO and electrons in the reduced dye or catalyst.39,40,58 This is particularly challenging if the photocathode is to be used to drive multiple charge transfer reactions such as H2 evolution or CO2 reduction.59 A simple way to increase the probability of charge-transfer from the dye to the catalyst is to co-assemble them on the surface of NiO to position them close together.24,52 Examples are included in Table 1 (orange). Hoogeveen et al. electrodeposited Pt catalysts on the PMI-6T-TPA|NiO surface by simultaneously applying a potential of −0.14 V and irradiating the dyed NiO electrode.57
A number of studies have reported rapid (t1/2 ≈ 10 ps) formation of a NiO+|Cat− species on excitation of a co-immobilised dye (coumarin 343) and iron catalyst (Example shown in Fig. 10(a)) using transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 10(b)).56,60,61 Recombination has been shown to occur on a much longer timescale (μs–ms) permitting sufficient time for the first step of water reduction (i.e. protonation of the reduced catalyst). A maximum photocurrent density for a co-immobilised photocathode was ca. 13 μA cm−2 under −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl and hydrogen was generated with a Faradaic efficiency of 50% over 1100 s.56 During this time the catalyst TON was ca. 3 but losses of carbonyl bands in the ATR-IR spectrum after the experiment revealed decomposition of the catalyst. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 10(c).

The C343˙− radical mainly absorbs at 600 nm. ∼1 ps after the excitation a new positive band between 410 and 500 nm forms, which persists beyond the time window of the measurement (τ > 2 ns), assigned to the singly reduced [Fe2(bdt)(CO)6] catalyst.

5. Coordination or covalent assemblies
Attaching the catalyst to the periphery of the dye should favour charge transfer to the catalyst and increase the spatial separation between the charges. Examples are shown in Fig. 11 and highlighted in blue in Table 1. Ji et al. functionalised a cyclometalated RuII sensitizer (O22) with a phenylpyridyl ligand with a carboxylic acid anchoring group attached at the anionic phenyl ring and a vinylpyridyl substituent at the 4,4′-bipyridine ligand to facilitate axial coordination of the dye to the cobalt metal centre in a Co(dmgBF2)2 catalyst for hydrogen evolution. This electrode was assembled by soaking the NiO electrode first in a solution of O22 in acetonitrile for 16 hours, followed by an aqueous solution of Co(dmgBF2)2 for 5 minutes to load the cobalt catalyst. Gross et al. used a layer-by-layer assembly method to co-graft their ruthenium dye and nickel catalyst, which employed Zr4+ ions to link the phosphonate units on the dye and catalyst.53 Shan et al. increased the separation between the chromophore and the catalyst by introducing an electron donor in a trilayer structure.34 ITO|-DA-Zr-RuP22+-Zr-NiP2+ electrodes were prepared by sequentially soaking the nanoITO or ZrO2 films in (N,N,N′,N′-((CH2)3PO3H2)4-4,4′-dianiline) (DA, 3.6 mM) for 2 h, ZrOCl2 (3 mM) for 2 h, RuP22+ (0.1 M) for 2 h, ZrOCl2 (3 mM) for 2 h, and NiP2+ (5 mM) (inside a N2 purged glovebox) for 8 h and rinsing with 0.1 M HClO4 solution between switching to different loading solutions. This structure was designed to slow down charge recombination. Reduction of the catalyst may occur from either the dye's reduced or excited state.
 Fig. 11  Reaction schemes illustrating the synthesis of coupled dye-catalyst systems used with dye-sensitized photocathodes so far. O22 was coordinated to the catalyst by soaking the NiO electrode first in a solution of O22 in acetonitrile for 16 hours, followed by an aqueous solution of Co(dmgBF2)2 for 5 minutes. 
Kaeffer et al. covalently linked a cobalt diamine–dioxime catalyst to their metal-free push–pull dye and anchored it through the triphenylamine donor to the NiO using a Cu-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (3 in Fig. 11).45 A similar approach was used by Pati et al. but a copper-free click reaction was used to link the catalyst to the core of the dye (PB-2 in Fig. 11).55 In the latter study, transient absorption spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting was used to probe the charge-transfer dynamics of the dye-catalyst system adsorbed on a substrate (ZrO2 or NiO). These experiments confirmed that rapid electron transfer occurs between the dye to the catalyst (τ = ca. 20 ps) and from the NiO to the dye (τ = ca. 1.2 ps). The relative lifetimes indicate that hole injection occurs first followed by electron transfer to the catalyst. Time-resolved spectral decay profiles revealed a red-shift in the emission which the authors attributed to Förster energy transfer between the adsorbed dye molecules. The transient spectra indicate that hole injection also occurs from the lower energy excited state product (τ = ca. 30 ps). However, a low turnover number (0.05) and unstable photocurrent suggest that there is a bottleneck in the overall system. Proposed reasons include poor infiltration of the electrolyte within the pores, slow second electron reduction of the catalyst or slow rate of catalysis.
6. Tandem devices
To drive the complete water splitting reaction a photoanode and photocathode may be assembled in series so that the electrons generated by the water oxidation reaction are consumed in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Tong et al. assembled a PMI-6T-NDI (Fig. 4) dye-sensitized NiO photocathode, in series with a BiVO4 photoanode, separated by a Nafion membrane, to demonstrate that sustained current (1.8–2.7 μA cm−2, Faradaic efficiency of 80%) could be generated under irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, λ > 420 nm; pH 7 sulphate buffer) without external bias.42 Fan et al. assembled a fully dye-sensitized tandem cell which generated a steady photocurrent density of 25 μA cm−2 under 300 mW cm−2 irradiation and of 12 μA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, λ > 420 nm; pH 7 phosphate buffer). This system used a [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-PO3H2)bpy]2+ photosensitizer on both photoelectrodes, a ruthenium oxygen evolution catalyst on the photoanode and a cobalt hydrogen evolution catalyst at the photocathode (Table 1, Fig. 12). The anchoring group used for both catalysts was a pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid ligand (Fig. 13). A subsequent device developed by the group exchanged the ruthenium dyes for organic photosensitizers, L0 for TiO2 and P1 for NiO.52 The photocurrent density generated by the two-electrode cell (with no external applied bias) under irradiation of both electrodes, separated by a glass frit, (100 mW cm−2, white LED, λ > 400 nm; pH 7 phosphate buffer) was ca. 70 μA cm−2 initially, decaying by about 40% over 10 minutes. The Faradaic efficiency was estimated to be 55%.

C. Challenges and future directions
In both tandem devices described above, the current was limited by the photocathode.24,52 Therefore there is an opportunity to improve the performance of photoelectrochemical water splitting devices by developing better photocathodes. The modular design of the device means that the performance of each component can be improved by systematically tuning the structure. However, ultimately the components must operate in synchrony in the complete device. While the proof-of-concept devices discussed above demonstrate the feasibility of splitting water using a DSPCs, this is an emerging field and significant gaps remain in understanding the fundamental science. A few are included here.
So far, the complementarity of the spectral response of the two photoelectrodes has not been addressed. The photosensitizers used on both NiO and TiO2 typically absorb in the blue-green region. This means there is sufficient driving force for charge transfer between the dye|semiconductor and the dye|catalyst interfaces. However, if the device is to be irradiated from only one side, the two electrodes will be competing for the same photons. A clear example is provided by Li et al. for their organic DSPC (Fig. 12), in which the performance of the tandem device dropped when only one electrode was irradiated at one time.52 The current can be matched by tuning the electrode thickness. However, to increase the efficiency, both electrodes should complement each other, e.g. one absorbing the blue photons, the other absorbing the red photons. This is easy to achieve by tuning the structure of the dye. However, it is not yet clear what driving force will be required to drive the catalysts and therefore what the optimum efficiency will be.
A related approach is to replace the dye with an inorganic absorber such as CdSe quantum dots.62 These are expected to operate with the same working principles as dye-sensitized photocathodes. For example, Ruberu et al. reported such a device for H2 evolution in which the CdSe was capped with 3-mercapto-2,2-bis(mercaptomethyl)propanoate to link the CdSe to the NiO surface.63 The photocathode in the presence of bis(1,2-benzenedithiolate) cobalt catalyst generated a significantly higher photocurrent density compared to the devices above (2 mA cm−2 under 520 nm LED light and an applied bias of −0.28 V versus RHE, 0.1 M KCl with pH 6 buffer in 1:1 CH3CN/H2O solution) and produced H2 with approximately quantitative Faradaic efficiency. These photocathodes are stable for over 16 hours at pH 6 but are unstable at higher pH due to dissolution of the CdSe. Wang et al. have recently reviewed hybrid photoelectrocatalytic devices based on visible-light-absorbing semiconductors, such as p-Si or InP, with immobilised molecular catalysts.64 These differ from dye or quantum dot-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells because the semiconductor performs a dual function of light absorption and charge transport, whereas these processes are separated in DSPCs. Current densities are generally higher for visible-light-absorbing semiconductors, however the stability still requires improvement and their integration in complete PEC cells for water splitting requires further development. In principle, lead halide perovskite absorbers can be applied in PEC cells, however, their instability in water means that their application in water splitting has so far been limited to buried junction devices or PV-driven electrolysis.65
A key challenge for DSPCs is operation in water. Most DSSCs operate in organic electrolytes and moisture is avoided. The best IPCEs (incident photon-to-current efficiency) obtained in p-type DSSCs are ca. 64%.29,41 However, this falls below 10% for DSPCs.32 Example IPCE spectra for a P1-sensitized DSSC and DSPC are shown in Fig. 14. Consequently, the photocurrent density of DSPCs is substantially lower than DSSCs. Optimised DSSCs generate a photocurrent density in excess of 8 mA cm−2.36 The dye-sensitized photocathodes in water splitting devices described above generate 30–1000 times less photocurrent compared to dye-sensitized solar cells in organic solvents. A number of studies have been performed in the presence of organometallic acceptors to quantify the attainable photocurrent generated by the photocathodes at neutral pH or lower. Gross et al. recorded a photocurrent response of 9 μA cm−2 for their photocathode (NiO sensitized with a ruthenium dye) in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor 4,4′-dithiodipyridine at pH 3 and an applied potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE.53 This was enhanced to 14 μA cm−2 for the supramolecular assembly where the nickel catalyst was introduced by coordinating the phosphonate groups on both to Zr4+. The authors suggest that this means electron transfer to acceptor 4,4′-dithiodipyridine is faster than catalysis. Massin et al. recorded enhanced photocurrent densities up to 270 μA cm−2 for their photocathode, sensitized with a donor–acceptor organic dye, in the presence of an irreversible electron acceptor, [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2, compared to a photocurrent density of 10 μA cm−2 in the absence of an electron acceptor under the same conditions (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl).46 No enhancement was observed above 10 mM [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2.46 Queyriaux et al. recorded photocurrent densities between 50 and 190 μA cm−2 for their series of ruthenium bipyridyl-sensitized photocathodes with the same electron acceptor in solution (pH 4.5 and pH 7).
 Fig. 14  Example IPCE spectra for a P1-sensitized DSSC and DSPC are shown (dashed = 1 layer, solid – 2 layer). Reproduced with permission from ref. 29 and 52. 
A very promising result for aqueous p-type dye-sensitized solar cells was reported by Xiang et al.66 Their solar cell sensitized with PMI-6T-TPA and assembled with [Co(en)3]2+/3+ (aq) electrolyte at pH between 8 and 11 gave similar JSC = 5.04–5.35 mA cm−2 and IPCE = ca. 40%. In fact, the best cell efficiency (η = 1.6%, pH 10.05) exceeded their reported value for the same dye and redox mediator in an organic electrolyte.67 The [Co(en)3]2+/3+ complex is unstable at pH < 8. Therefore, further studies like these are required at lower pH, especially as lowering the pH leads to a positive shift in the valence band potential, which could affect the photoinduced charge-separation process. Click et al. applied their “bilayer dye” BH2 to aqueous p-type DSSCs with the traditional I3−/I− redox mediator.68 At pH 5, the solar cell generated a current of 3 mA cm−2. However, they showed that the magnitude of the dark current increases with decreasing pH and this limits the VOC. These results demonstrate that a well-engineered system can generate reasonable photocurrent in water as well as organic solvents. In general, more information is required to understand the effect of water on the interfaces between the semiconductor, molecular components and solvent. From these limited studies, it appears that the performance is limited at low pH due to increased recombination and slower charge injection rather than the stability of the dye on the NiO surface. Coating the surface with Al2O3 as described above, or doping the NiO to lower the valence band edge may restore the photocurrent and improve the performance.69,70
While DSSCs operate by single electron transfer reactions, water splitting requires the transfer of multiple charges (two electrons per H2 molecule, four electrons per O2 molecule). Therefore, DSPCs must facilitate charge accumulation and limit charge-recombination. The modular approach allows for the spatial separation of charges. However, as discussed above, quantum efficiencies of DPSCs lag far below those of DSSCs. For many catalysts, this second reduction step should be thermodynamically more favourable. However, under one sun, each dye is excited approximately once every second so long-lived charge-separated states are required. Alternatively, for high TOF and to compete with recombination, the catalyst needs to be reduced by multiple dyes. To our knowledge, spectroscopic evidence for the second reduction step is still lacking. While there have been many studies of the kinetics of dyes adsorbed on NiO for p-type DSSCs, some in the presence of the redox electrolyte, there are few (if any) which have been carried out in the presence of water (frequently, dried films are used).
Finally, the majority of DSPCs reported have been based on NiO, with few exceptions.34 A handful of alternative p-type semiconductors have been applied in DSSCs and perovskite-based solar cells (for a recent review see e.g.ref. 71). However, these p-type DSSCs typically exhibit improved voltages but lower photocurrents compared to NiO-based devices.72–75 At present it is unclear whether NiO is the best p-type material for DSPCs and a material with better conductivity may help to overcome the dominant recombination processes which limit the performance of dye-sensitized photocathodes in general.
Conclusions
In principle, DSPCs offer a robust, low cost method of storing the energy in sunlight in the form of chemical bonds (i.e. a fuel). However, the challenge of driving two electron reduction to produce hydrogen with visible light still presents a significant challenge. Charge-recombination reactions between the reduced dye or catalyst with holes in the NiO lead to significant efficiency losses in dye-sensitized photocathodes for hydrogen evolution. Engineering of the dye and the interfaces has successfully improved the performance of these devices, however there remains much scope for improvement. Nonetheless, proof of concept DSPC devices have shown that the technology is feasible. It is perhaps too early to judge which of the device designs described here will ultimately give the best performance. Certainly, an efficient device will manage the photon flux and the turnover frequency of the catalyst, while minimising the free energy required from sunlight to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction. Lessons learned from solar cells and electrocatalysis, together with developments in new materials and fundamental photophysics/photoelectrochemistry, can be applied to accelerate progress this emerging field. Exchange of the proton reduction catalyst for a CO2 reduction catalyst could be used to directly generate a carbon-based fuel.

Elizabeth A. Gibson
	Libby Gibson is a Lecturer in Physical Chemistry at Newcastle University. Prior to her current role, she held a University of Nottingham Anne McLaren Research Fellowship and a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship. She obtained her PhD in 2007 from the University of York, supervised by Robin Perutz FRS and Anne-Kathrin Duhme-Klair. Research in her group focuses on solar cell and solar fuel devices that function at a molecular level and challenge the conventional solid-state photovoltaic technologies. Her current ERC-funded project focuses on developing transparent p-type semiconductors for tandem solar cells and artificial photosynthesis.

 	Fig. 1  Typical water reduction systems under development (A) a fully molecular system. (B) A colloidal system, (C) a dye-sensitized photocathode which combines approaches (A) and (B), (D) a monolithic tandem PEC cell.	 
2H2O ⇌ O2 + 4H+ + 4e− E0 = 1.23 V vs. RHE	(2)
2H+ + 2e− ⇌ H2 E0 = 0.00 V vs. RHE	(3)

 	Fig. 2  Device configuration and working principle of a dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPC) for water splitting to H2 and O2. (1) Light is absorbed by the dye (D) adsorbed to the TiO2 surface to generate the excited state (D*). (2) Electron transfer from the excited dye (D*) to the TiO2 conduction band, generating the oxidised dye (D+). (3) Electron diffusion through the mesoporous TiO2 to the conductive glass substrate. (4) Electron transfer from the catalyst to the oxidised dye (D+). (5) Oxidation of water by the catalyst on the photoanode surface. (6) Light absorption by the dye adsorbed on the NiO surface. (7) Electron transfer from the NiO valence band to the excited dye to form the reduced dye (D−). (8) Hole diffusion through the mesoporous NiO to the conductive glass substrate. (9) Reduction of the catalyst by the reduced dye. (10) Reduction of H+ by the catalyst at the cathode surface. The electrons generated by the water oxidation process pass through the circuit to be consumed in the proton reduction reaction. This photocurrent is recorded to evaluate the Faradaic efficiency of the cell.
