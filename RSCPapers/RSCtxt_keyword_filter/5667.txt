    , Accepted 8th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractThe poor stability of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite is one of crucial problems limiting the practical application of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). All-inorganic lead-free perovskite materials, with Cs replacing the organic cations and Sn replacing Pb, have shown great potential in achieving high thermal stability. However, tin-based perovskites have inevitably suffered from severe bulk recombination, attributed to Sn vacancies. In this work, we obtain CsSnIBr2 thin films with low Sn vacancy assisted by the addition of hypophosphorous acid (HPA). The HPA additive here as complexant is demonstrated to be capable of speeding up the nucleation process while inhibiting the formation of Sn4+ during the formation process of CsSnIBr2 thin films. With a mesoscopic architecture, the CsSnIBr2 PSCs exhibit efficiency-loss free in 77 days and remarkably stable power output within 9 hours at high temperatures up to 473 K.
1. Introduction
The recent emergence of organic–inorganic halide hybrid perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) based on ABX3 structure has attracted widespread interest in both scientific and industrial communities. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs grew rapidly from 3.8% to 22.1% in just few years accompanied with the development of the large-area module processing techniques.1–10
Compared to conventional inorganic semiconductors, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have considerably lower thermal decomposition temperatures (∼573 K for the bulk material and 423–473 K for thin films), triggering continuous degradation under high operation temperature and therefore severely limiting the thermal stability of PSCs.11,12 Very recently, Rb+ was introduced in the A position of the ABX3 perovskite structural films so that the stability of the devices were enhanced.13 Further, the all-inorganic halide perovskites, CsPbI3 or CsPbBr3, are thermally stable up to their melting points over 733 K.14 Snaith's group first used CsPbI3 as light absorber in solar cells and achieved a 1.7% efficiency.12 Then they demonstrated highly thermally stable CsPbI2Br films, which worked in solar cells with a stabilized power output (SPO) of 5.6%, confirming its potential for long-term operation.15 In this regard, the substitution of hybrid with all-inorganic halide perovskite absorbers might be one of the radical solutions to overcome the intrinsic thermal degradation problem of PSCs.
On the other hand, non-lead perovskite PSCs incorporating divalent metal cations such as Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb in 3D or lower dimensional perovskite structures have very low efficiencies or poor stabilities.16–18 Although the toxicity of organic–inorganic hybrid MASnI3 perovskite is comparable to the Pb-based perovskites, the all-inorganic Sn-based perovskite, with a much lower solubility in fat, could be less toxic to human body, according to the previous commentary.19 Additionally, the Sn-based PSCs had a wider photoelectric corresponding range, which could bring a higher short circuit current density than Pb-based PSCs.20 Lately, the methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite material performed well as a lead-free light absorber, and a PCE of 5–6% was obtained for the MASnI3-based PSCs.21,22 Afterward, Mathews and co-workers reported a formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) PSCs with an efficiency of 2.1%.23 Therefore, Sn-based PSCs have the highest efficiencies among all the lead-free candidates. But Sn2+ could be easily oxidized into Sn4+, leading to undesired Sn vacancies and severe carrier combination. Thus, SnF2 was usually added to reduce the Sn-cation vacancy. Very recently, an additive of pyrazine was reported in the FASnI3 PSCs, which improved the solubility of SnF2 in the DMSO–DMF mixed solvent and the decrease the Sn4+ vacancy devices achieved a PCE of 4.8%.24 It is worth noting that Cs2SnI6 perovskite is air stable, with a stable valence state of Sn+4.25 However, Cs2SnI6 as an absorber, the PSCs suffered from poor efficiency.26
Combining its advantages in thermal stability, all-inorganic lead-free halide perovskites with Cs replacing the organic cations (e.g. MA+ and FA+) and Sn replacing Pb, might be excellent candidates of photovoltaic application. CsSnI3, as a typical all-inorganic and lead-free halide perovskite material, was first reported to serve as the hole transport material in dye sensitized solar cells, attributed to its high hole mobility at room temperature.27 As light absorber, CsSnI3 solar cells have exhibited a high photocurrent density of more than 22 mA cm−2.26 However, the theoretical open circuit voltage (VOC) of the CsSnI3 PSC is severely limited by intense bulk recombination, which is caused by the Sn vacancies.28 An effective way of boosting VOC is by incorporating of Br, i.e., CsSnI3−xBrx. The introduction of Br was reported to suppress the Sn cation vacancies that are the dominant defects in CsSnI3. With an optimized I/Br ratio of 2/1, a maximum PCE of 1.67% was achieved.29 To date, the Sn vacancy-induced recombination is still a key factor that limits the development of CsSnX3-based PSCs (X = Cl, Br, I).
Principally, a complete isolation from oxygen and water or introduction of reducing agents like SnF2 were effective methods to decrease the Sn vacancy of CsSnX3.27,30 For the former one, the carbon counter electrode (CE) based fully printable mesoscopic PSCs had set a good example. Both the thick mesoporous films and the hydrophobic CE contribute to excellent isolation from ambient air.9 For the later method, the addictive-assisted preparation of the perovskite layer were conducted in the Pb-based perovskites and shown a positive effect on reducing the trap states.31 In this scenario, the introduction of suitable additive in precursor solvent would give rise to the CsSnX3 thin films with decreased Sn vacancy and reduced trap states.
In our work, hypophosphorous acid (HPA) was used as additive in precursor solution to prepare the CsSnIBr2-based mesoscopic PSCs. We assumed that the HPA additive facilitated the nucleation of CsSnIBr2 and, at the same time, acted as a reducing reagent to avoid the oxidation of Sn2+. The additive-assisted preparation method provided a phase-stable CsSnIBr2 film with a significantly reduced concentration of Sn vacancies. Consequently, the vacancy-induced charge recombination was remarkably suppressed so that we could achieve an enhanced efficiency. More importantly, the all-inorganic lead-free CsSnIBr2-based mesoscopic PSCs showed an excellent thermal stability up to 473 K, which could fully meet the industrial standards.
2. Experimental
Devices were fabricated on Fuorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (YINGKOU OPV TCH NEW ENERGY CO., LTD, OPVFTO22-7). Initially FTO was etched with 2 mol L−1 HCl and zinc powder. Substrates were then cleaned and UV treated.
A 40 nm compact TiO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating a mildly acidic precursor solution (including titanium isopropoxide, HCl and ethanol) at 1300 rpm for 60 s, which was then annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 min.7 After cooling to room temperature, a 1 μm thick mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal film (18NR-T, Dyesol) was deposited with screen printing. Li+ and Mg2+ ions modification was prepared by spin-coating a solution of 0.1 M lithium bis(trifuoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 0.03 M magnesium acetate dissolved in water/ethanol (1:1 v/v) on the TiO2 layers at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealing for 30 min at 500 °C. And then a 650 nm thick Al2O3 insulating layer (20 nm γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, Aladdin) was spin coated on the as-prepared TiO2 layers. Then, an approximately 10 μm carbon paste (graphite/carbon black, 4:1, weight ratio) was subsequently printed on top of the Al2O3 layer as a counter electrode.32 The triple layer structure of TiO2/Al2O3/C was sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The CsSnIBr2 perovskite precursor solution contained (1 M) CsI–SnBr2 and (60% mol) SnF2 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 8 μL solution was dropped on the pre-heated substrate of 170 °C, where the carbon area of 1.6 cm2. To prevent the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, we carried out the perovskite fabrication in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The films were annealing at 170 °C for 2 min and then transporting to 330 °C for 2 min.
The cross section of the sample was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7401F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with Smart LAB instruments CuKα beam (λ = 1.54 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra were employed to assess the absorption properties of the perovskite sensitized TiO2 thin film with a Hitachi U-3010 spectroscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI 5300 ESCA PerkinElmer spectrometer and the surface cleaning process was performed with Ar plasma. All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by recording the current through a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at an irradiance equivalent to 100 mW cm−2 generated by using an thermo oriel 91192-1000 simulator, with the intensity calibrated with an VLSI standards incorporated PN 91150V Si reference cell. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, ranging from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz) were measured by ZAHNER CIMPS electrochemical workstation, Germany. Mobilities were determined using the time-of-flight (TOF) method. The flight time, t, which is the time that carriers take to pass through the perovskite layer, was derived from the intersection of the two straight lines in the double-logarithmic plot of the transient photocurrent.
3. Results and discussion
HPA is a gentle reduction agent with the P–O bond that could strongly coordinate with Sn2+ and stabilizes the CsSnIBr2 precursor.33 We first looked into the effect of HPA additive on the absorbance of precursor solution. In the perovskite precursor, 0.5 μL mL−1 HPA solution (50 wt% in water) was added and induced the color of precursor solution changing from bright yellow to dark brown. In Fig. 1a, the UV-vis absorbance spectra showed a slight enhancement of light absorbing at the range of 500–750 nm via adding HPA solution, indicating a generation of new compounds. The zeta potential analyzer results in Fig. 1b showed a clear trend of cluster size enlargement from 0.9 to 6.8 nm when increasing the concentration of HPA from 0.1 to 1.0 μL mL−1. Previous report shows a Sn compound with a cluster structure could be generated via Sn–O–P–O–Sn coordination bond connection.34 Combining the absorption results, here we infer the cluster component would be CsSnX3–HPAy (X = Br, I). Considering that the CsSnIBr2 PSCs were prepared through drop-casting the precursor solution onto the mesoscopic substrates, these tiny clusters with the size of below 5 nm would not block the channels in meso-porous layer.35

In order to perform X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the active absorber embedded in the TiO2/Al2O3 mesoporous films, we peeled off the CE/capping layer and then detected the CsSnIBr2 under-layer, shown in Fig. 2a. Without HPA additive, a cubic phase CsSnIBr2 perovskite layer was obtained with a clear phase separation of SnF2 (24.9 degrees).28,29 In contrast, when the HPA additive was presented, the SnF2 phase separation avoided as well we increased the content of HPA to 1.0 μL mL−1, which exhibits a pure CsSnIBr2 phase.27 We further explored the real effective component in the HPA additive. The same concentration of water was added in the precursor and the as-prepared films showed the SnF2 separation phase as well, which excluded the influence of H2O. A reasonable explanation regarding the HPA suppressing phase separation would be that the formed clusters in precursor solution promoted the growth of perovskite crystals and expelled the redundant SnF2 to the surface of the film. When we flash-annealed the film at a high temperature of over 603 K, the redundant SnF2 was observed as white smoke.

Note that the top capping and carbon layer were stripped by tapes for XRD and UV-vis absorption measurements. 

Fig. 2b demonstrated the optical absorptance of the TiO2/Al2O3/perovskite films after peeling off the surface CE/capping layer. The onset of bandgap of the control film was 1.63 eV, which is consistent with the ref. 36. As for the HPA film, the light absorptance markedly enhanced from 580 to 700 nm and the band edge was slightly extended toward infrared region, resulting from relatively lower trap densities.37
The trap density of the Sn-based perovskite is strongly associated with the Sn4+ content, which can be distinguished by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in Fig. 2c, the main peaks at 495.3 and 486.9 eV were ascribed to the binding energy of 3d3/2 and 3d5/3 for Sn2+, respectively. The fitting peaks situated at 595.9 and 487.5 eV were identified as the binding energy of Sn4+, which was considered as the Sn vacancies. It is worthy of noting that the amount (4%) of Sn4+ in the CsSnIBr2 thin film prepared with HPA additive is much lower than that (23%) of the pristine film. More evidences regarding the HPA additive suppressing defects are provided by the local time-resolved PL decay curves, shown in Fig. 2d. The presence of HPA dramatically retarded the PL decay process with the fast decay component lifetime, τfast, increasing from 0.152 to 0.184 ns, and the slow component, τslow, from 0.76 to 1.10 ns. Therefore, we conclude that the HPA additive effectively reduces the Sn vacancies and the trap densities in the CsSnIBr2 films.
It is worthy of noting that during the flash-annealing process at 603 K, not only the extra SnF2 and Sn4+ products on the surface of the film easily eliminated, but the HPA additive and its oxidation products (e.g. phosphoric acid), with relatively low boiling points at 371 and 431 K, also exhausted. We present the high-resolution XPS spectra of P in Fig. S1,† demonstrating that there was no detectable P in the annealed films with HPA additive.
The results in Fig. 3a show the conductivity to be nearly one order of magnitude lower for the one with HPA additive, which was tested by embedding perovskite thin films between FTO and Au electrodes. The conductivity of the perovskite films decreased on account of the lower Sn vacancies density. In Fig. S2,† we compare the electron and hole motilities of the embedded CsSnIBr2/Al2O3 perovskite films with HPA by time of flight (TOF) measurement. Both the hole and electron mobility of the perovskite film exhibits the values of 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 (V−1 s−1), which is relatively lower than the reports.38 Because the Al2O3 mesoporous layer restrict the growth of perovskite crystal.

The lines correspond to the linear fitting of the data. (c) Electron lifetime and (d) charge recombination lifetime for devices under different bias voltage. 
The charge carrier density of the CsSnIBr2 film was then analyzed by the Mott–Schottky behavior,39 which reflects the modulation of a depletion region (Fig. 3b). In order to ensure the reliability of measurements, we tested the validity of the depletion approximation.40 As shown in Fig. S3,† the depletion were ∼200 and ∼800 nm before and after HPA addition, while the thicknesses of the two absorber layers were both 1.65 μm (SEM images shown in Fig. S4†), thick enough to ensure a full depletion. The charge carrier density can be extracted by the fitting of the capacitance with Mott–Schottky relation, ND = 2/A2eεε0(dC−2/dV), where A is the electrode area, e is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of CsSnIBr2, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum of the CsSnIBr2, C is the capacitance and V is the applied voltage.41 The charge carrier density of the pristine CsSnIBr2 was determined to be 1.6 × 1016 cm−3 with HPA additive, this value was decreased to be 1.5 × 1015 cm−3 with one order of magnitude lower in contrast to the control film.
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate the charge transport, recombination, and accumulation of charges of the perovskite-based mesoscopic devices. The Nyquist plots of devices were acquired in the frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz, under illumination and at a bias of −0.25 V, as shown in Fig. S5.† We use a two lumped RC-circuit in series to fit the impedance data. The arc in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge exchange process at the counter electrodes interface, with two typical impedance elements of charge exchange resistances (RCE) and geometrical capacitance (C); the arc in the middle frequency region corresponds to the charge recombination process at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, where the interfacial recombination resistance (RCT) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) could be extracted.42–44 The electron lifetime τ (τ = RCE × C) in the high frequency region exhibited an exponential decrease with increasing the applied bias, as shown in Fig. 3c. Compared with the control devices showed the HPA devices have a shorter electron lifetime, which suggested a better charge transports and charge collections at the carbon electrodes interface.45 This may result from a better perovskite/carbon interfacial contact as the excess SnF2 is expelled.46 In addition, the charge recombination lifetime τrl (τrl = RCTCμ) in the middle frequency region was determined and shown in Fig. 3d. The HPA device showed a four-fold longer recombination lifetime than that of the control device. In addition, further evidence was provided by the dark current results of PSCs shown in Fig. S6.† With the HPA additive, the dark current decreases to 50% of that of the pristine PSCs. Thus, the HPA as additive significantly enhances the charge collection and reduces the charge recombination by decreasing the trap density of the perovskite film.
The discussion above comprehensively studied the beneficial impact of HPA additive on CsSnIBr2 film. Then we constructed the mesoscopic CsSnIBr2 PSCs and optimized the concentration of HPA, shown in Fig. S7.† With the optimized concentration of 0.5 μL mL−1, the statistics data of photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF, and PCE are shown in Fig. 4a and summarized in Table 1. These results revealed HPA to be an efficient additive in the CsSnIBr2 PSCs. Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of the champion device, scanned at the speed of 0.2 V s−1. The champion device presented a PCE of 3.2% with a JSC of 17.4 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.31 V, and an FF of 0.56, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported PCE for the all-inorganic Sn-based PSCs. Moreover, no obvious hysteresis was observed at various scan speeds (Fig. S8†). The measured JSC is consistent with the integrated JSC of 17.3 mA cm−2, estimated from the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) in Fig. 4c. The CsSnIBr2 mesoscopic PSCs finally achieved a stabilized power output (SPO) of ∼3.3% within 300 s (held at 0.23 V), as shown in Fig. 4d.

The thermal stability study began with the CsSnIBr2 films. We fabricated the perovskite films embedded in a 300 nm thickness Al2O3 mesoporous layer and thermally aged them at the temperature of 358 K. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, after 15 min thermal treatment, the peak located at 24.9 degrees appeared in the case of the pristine CsSnIBr2 films, indicating a SnF2 phase separation. As the time extended, the phase separation further deteriorated. However, with HPA additive, no obvious SnF2 peaks were found during the whole 180 min thermal treatment, shown in Fig. 5b. It was reported that a small amount of SnF2 residue in grain boundary would induce their aggregation and phase separation from the perovskite film in sensitive environment.47,48 Therefore, we infer that in the pristine CsSnIBr2 film without HPA, the residual SnF2 at the grain boundary, which fails to sublimate during the annealing process, trends to gather and slowly phase separate during long-term thermal treatment. But the introduction of HPA additive promotes the migration of SnF2 residues in a synergetic way, resulting in complete elimination and thus contributing to a pure phase CsSnIBr2 perovskite. This inference also explained why the SnF2 phase directly appeared when embedded in the TiO2/Al2O3/C substrate (Fig. 2a) but slowly showed in the Al2O3 substrate during long-term thermal treatment. The former one has a thickness of ∼12 μm, which retarded the complete sublimation of SnF2 and clearly showed the importance of the assistance of HPA additive. It is worth noting that the perovskite phase of CsSnIBr2 is stable up to ∼673 K, proven by the TGA experiments (Fig. S9†), which is much higher than that of MAPbI3 (543 K).49 Also, the DSC plot showed no transformation point from room temperature to 473 K. Thus overall, the all-inorganic lead-free CsSnIBr2 perovskite films can be obtained with HPA additive, and exhibits a stable phase during long-term thermal treatment.

The thermal stability of CsSnIBr2 (compared with MAPbI3) PSCs was tested by vacuum thermostatic system with a vacuum of 10−6 Torr at the temperature of 358, 373, 423 and 473 K. The SPO of devices were recorded under 1 sun illumination for 9 hours, held at the maximum power point (MPP), and the normalized PCE is shown in Fig. 6a. The typical hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells with MAPbI3 as absorber showed a rather poor thermal stability at 358 K, maintained less than 10% after the 9 hours test. On the contrary, the SPO of the pristine CsSnIBr2 solar cells without HPA additive maintained more than 90% at 358 K. The SPO decay mainly occurred at the first 2 to 3 h, probably due to the SnF2 phase separation as we demonstrated. Excitingly, the CsSnIBr2 PSCs with HPA additive performed much more stable, with a best retention rate of 98% at 473 K. The devices showed the absolute SPO values of ∼2.8%, ∼2.5% and ∼2.3% at 358, 423 and 473 K, respectively (Fig. S10†), which were consistent with the PCEs scanned at the temperature from 300 to 500 K (Fig. S11†). Furthermore, the encapsulated cells stored under ambient condition (humidity ∼20%; temperature ∼25 °C) showed an excellent long-term stability over a period of 77 days, maintaining 103% of its initial efficiency (Fig. 6b).

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we employed HPA to induce the generation of the perovskite seeds. As a consequence, the all-inorganic lead-free CsSnIBr2 perovskite films with low Sn vacancies and stable perovskite phase were obtained. The addition of HPA remarkably lowered both the carrier mobility and charge carrier density of the CsSnIBr2 films, which was beneficial to inhibit charge recombination. Thus, the VOC and FF were significantly improved with HPA addictive, achieving an average PCE of 3.0% with the mesoscopic PSC architecture, nearly two-fold of the control devices. More impressively, the all-inorganic CsSnIBr2 PSCs exhibit efficiency-loss free in 77 days and a superior thermal stability with 98% retention of PCE after 9 hours of continuous power output at 473 K. The present study provides an effective protocol for fabricating thermally stable all-inorganic and lead-free perovskite solar cells. Further work with novel charge transport materials to modify energy level and improve efficiency is underway.
