    , Accepted 1st April 2011First published on 3rd May 2011AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells are an increasingly promising alternative to conventional silicon solar cells as a method of converting solar energy to electricity and thus providing an effectively inexhaustible energy source. However, the most efficient of these devices currently utilize liquid electrolytes, which suffer from the associated problems of leakage and evaporation. Hence, significant research is currently focused on the development of solid state alternatives. Here we report a new class of solid state electrolyte for these devices, organic ionic plastic crystal electrolytes, that allow relatively rapid diffusion of the redox couple through the matrix, which is critical to the cell performance. A range of different organic ionic plastic crystal materials, utilizing different cation and anion structures, have been investigated and the conductivities, diffusion rates and photovoltaic performance of the electrolytes are reported. The best material, utilizing the dicyanamide anion, achieves efficiencies of more than 5%.

Broader context
Given the increasingly urgent need for alternative energy sources, new types of solid state electrolytes are desperately needed for a range of electrochemical devices. Arguably, one the most important of these devices is the dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC). For the commercialisation and wide-spread practical use of these new photovoltaics they must offer competitive efficiencies and stabilities, and hence the elimination of liquid electrolytes, which are volatile and prone to leakage, is crucial. Organic ionic plastic crystals are unique solid-state materials in terms of both their mechanical and transport properties; they combine the advantages of fast ion conduction with electrochemical and thermal stability and non-volatility, even above their melting point, thus making them excellent matrix materials for DSSC electrolytes. Furthermore, it is anticipated that solid state electrolytes utilising these materials will be suitable for mechanical printing, which is crucial for the large scale production of DSSCs by reel-to-reel processing.

Introduction
The development of efficient and stable dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as an alternative energy source has been the motivation behind substantial scientific and industrial research in the last two decades. Since their origins in the early 1990s,1 recognition of the potential of these devices as a low-cost alternative to the conventional silicon-based photovoltaics has grown considerably, and their efficiencies can now exceed 11% with liquid electrolytes.2 In parallel with the impetus to increase performance is the clear need to improve the long-term stability of the devices. In this vein, elimination of the volatile organic solvent electrolyte is highly advantageous and there has been considerable attention paid to the use of hole transporting materials or quasi-solid state alternatives such as polymer electrolytes.3–7 An alternative approach that has shown great promise, and is now the focus of commercial endeavors, is the use of ionic liquids, to form either a liquid electrolyte or, when combined with a polymer, a gelled system.8–13 Ionic liquids are ideal electrolytes for electrochemical applications such as DSSCs as they can exhibit exceptional electrochemical and thermal stability and have negligible vapour pressure, thus they do not evaporate from the device with long term use.14,15 Nonetheless, use of these materials in their liquid form does not obviate the problems of leakage from the device. Here we report the development of an alternative class of material for DSSCs, organic ionic plastic crystals, which are structurally analogous to ionic liquids, and thus possess similarly advantageous stability and non-volatility, but with the added advantage of being solid at room temperature.16 The long term stability of ionic liquid-based cells has been demonstrated,11,17 and it is anticipated that OIPC-based devices will be similarly stable. Furthermore, the plasticity of these materials, as a result of disorder within the solid state matrix, allows them to display excellent ionic conductivities and enables diffusion of the iodide/triiodide redox couple through the electrolyte fast enough to produce efficient solid state DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Thermal characterization
Until recently, research into plastic crystal materials has focused on molecular species, such as succinonitrile.18–24 These were first described in detail in the 1960s,25 when a number of features of plastic crystal behavior, such as a low entropy of melting, ΔSf < 20 J K−1 mol−1, were identified. The plastic phase of one of these compounds is commonly reached via one or more solid–solid phase transitions, such as those shown in Fig. 1 for the archetypal organic ionic plastic crystal N-methyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide.26,27 These transitions represent the onset of molecular rotations, effecting the transition from a fully ordered state at low temperatures (Fig. 1) to more disordered states as the temperature is increased. Thus, in the plastic phase the material has a long range order but short-range disorder, as a result of rotational motions of the molecules. The solid–solid phase transitions are frequently associated with large enthalpy and entropy increases, hence the ultimately low entropy of melting. The disorder in the plastic crystals is highly advantageous as it allows for high ionic conductivity and also imparts malleability (hence the term “plastic” crystal), which allows the material to deform without fracture under stress. In addition to ease of handling, in an electrochemical device such as a DSSC, which must operate over a range of different temperatures, these physical properties are highly beneficial as they reduce the problems of poor contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes that can occur during volume changes at different temperatures. The physical properties of these materials, where they are molten at accessible temperatures and also malleable in their solid state, means that these electrolytes should be mechanically printable and therefore suitable for the large-scale assembly of DSSCs by reel-to-reel processing. Thus, plastic crystals offer a unique alternative to polymer-based systems, both in terms of their mechanical and transport properties. Interest in the use of plastic crystals as solid state electrolytes is further driven by the observation that addition of a small amount of another component, such as an acid or salt, can result in orders of magnitude increases in conductivity.16,28–30 For example, addition of a lithium salt to an organic ionic plastic crystal can result in ionic conductivity enhancements of up to several orders of magnitude, giving materials that have recently shown very promising results in lithium battery applications.21,31,32

The figure also shows the crystal structures of the material,27 viewed with a slight skew along the b axis, in phase IV (−120 °C) and phase III (−60 °C), showing the layering of the cations (blue/grey) and anions (green/blue) and demonstrating the increase in disorder as the temperature is raised. The disorder increases with every phase transition until the material is in the melt.27 
The efficacy of using a molecular plastic crystal, succinonitrile, within a solid state DSSC has been reported,33–36 with efficiencies of ∼5% at full sun.36 Higher efficiencies were achieved at lower sun intensities and hence it was suggested that at full sun there is inefficient charge screening of electron transport within the TiO2 film.36 However, the disadvantage to the molecular plastic crystal materials is that they are commonly volatile and flammable above their melting point, which can be relatively low: 57 °C for pure succinonitrile, which decreases to around 40 °C on addition of the other solar cell electrolyte components.36 In contrast, organic ionic plastic crystals retain the non-volatility and non-flammability expected of a salt. They also display the same advantageous physical properties of ionic liquids, such as thermal and electrochemical stability, that have driven the rapid increase in utilisation of ionic liquids in various electrochemical devices. Here we report the first use of these materials (Fig. 2) as solid state electrolytes in DSSCs.

A range of different OIPCs were chosen for this study. The plastic crystal N-methyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, [C2mpyr][NTf2], is an archetypal OIPC27,28,37,38 that is currently being studied for lithium battery applications.32 A change of anion to BF4 gives a plastic crystal that is more plastic; [C2mpyr][BF4] physically flows under pressure and has a very low entropy of fusion (3 J K−1 mol−1), indicating that it is entropically very close to the liquid state in phase I.39 The thiocyanate-based ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate has shown significant promise as a liquid electrolyte for DSSCs,40 and thus the dimethylpyrrolidinium thiocyanate OIPC, which is the highest melting of the pyrrolidinium family (ca. 105 °C),41,42 was included in the study. The OIPC utilising this cation with the hexafluorophosphate anion was included to assess the influence of the anion.43 The dicyanamide anion, which has also been successfully used in ionic liquid-containing DSSCs,44,45 can form very plastic and conductive OIPCs; tetraethylammonium dicyanamide ([Et4N][N(CN)2]) can exhibit rotator and plastic crystal behaviour,46 and has a particularly low entropy of fusion (4 J K−1 mol−1). Finally, [C1mpyr][I] was included to allow assessment of the performance of an iodide-based salt, and this material displays rotator phases and a solid–solid phase transition before melting.47
For the utilization of these materials as DSSC electrolytes, the traditional DSSC additives were used; [C2mim][I] (2.5 M) was used as the iodide source, except with the [C1mpyr][I] OIPC. LiI (0.1 M) and I2 (0.23 M) were also added to the electrolytes, plus N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB, 0.25 M), except with the [Et4N][N(CN)2] electrolyte where no NMB was added due to phase separation. Addition of these extra components can produce additional peaks in the DSC traces of the materials and a depression of the melting point, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI† for [C1mpyr][N(CN)2], but all of the electrolytes remain in the solid state over a suitably wide temperature range. For example, the best performing electrolyte, [C1mpyr][N(CN)2], has a melting point of 87 °C, above which point it becomes an ionic liquid. Nonetheless, the detailed morphology of the electrolyte materials is not necessarily revealed by these measurements; one or more of the added components may exist predominantly at the grain boundaries. The grain boundary region is thought to be an important facilitator of mass transport in OIPC materials since they are more highly defected than the bulk crystal.48 At an extreme these grain boundary regions may represent a separate phase that exists within the bulk solid.
Conductivity
The ionic conductivity of the OIPCs containing the solar cell additives is shown in Fig. 3. A number of the OIPC-based electrolytes display excellent room temperature conductivities, such as the [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] and [C2mpyr][BF4]-based systems that have conductivities exceeding 1 × 10−3 S cm−1. The conductivities of other electrolytes, such as the thiocyanate salt system, are below 5 × 10−7 S cm−1, demonstrating the significant influence that the plastic crystal structure has on the physical properties.
 Fig. 3  The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of the different OIPC-based solid state electrolytes, with [C2mim][I] (2.5 M, except for the [C1mpyr][I] electrolyte where no [C2mim][I] was added), LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.23 M) and NMB (0.25 M, except for the [Et4N][N(CN)2] electrolyte where no NMB was added due to phase separation). 
The rate of the diffusion of the redox couple can be the primary determinant of the efficiency of a DSSC; thus, the diffusion coefficients of these systems were measured using symmetrical cells, at 80 °C, where the OIPC-based electrolyte was sandwiched between two pieces of platinised FTO glass. This allows electrochemical measurement of the limiting diffusion current, and hence the rate of diffusion, of the redox couple within the OIPC electrolytes. From the anodic and cathodic steady-state currents of the steady state voltammogram the diffusion coefficient (D) can be calculated (see ESI†, Fig. S2). These measurements show that the diffusion values of the iodide and triiodide (Table 1) in the OIPCs are relatively high despite the solid state nature of the material. It is this fast ion conduction that makes the use of OIPCs as solid state electrolytes compelling. [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] shows the highest iodide and triiodide diffusivities; this OIPC electrolyte is also the most conductive. The strongest molecular structure influence appears to come from the anion, as four different [C1mpyr] salts can exhibit diffusivities varying by a factor of four.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows determination of the separate resistive processes within the symmetrical cells, thus confirming fast electron transfer at the electrodes. The fitting parameters of the EIS spectra of the different plastic crystal electrolytes, obtained using an appropriate equivalent circuit (see ESI†, Fig. S3), are given in Table 2; Rct is the charge transfer resistance of the electrochemical reaction between the two Pt-electrolyte interfaces, Rs is the series resistance, related to the resistance of the electrolyte and the sheet resistance of the FTO glass, and C is the capacitance. The two dicyanamide plastic crystal electrolytes give the lowest charge transfer resistance, which is particularly advantageous for obtaining the ultimate DSSC performance. However, there is no clear relationship between the charge transfer resistance or series resistance and the nature of the OIPC cation. The series resistance of the symmetric cells containing the [C2mpyr][NTf2], [C1mpyr][N(CN)2], [C2mpyr][BF4] and [C1mpyr][PF6] plastic crystals is lower than those utilizing the [C1mpyr][I] or [C1mpyr][SCN] based electrolytes.

Device performance
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs utilizing the new organic ionic plastic crystal electrolytes is shown in Fig. 4, and the individual parameters are summarized in Table 3. The performance varies significantly depending on the nature of the OIPC, with the [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] electrolyte giving the best performance, at 5.1%. This is consistent with the high diffusion coefficients. However, the trend in short circuit current or photovoltaic performance does not correlate directly with the diffusion coefficients of the different OIPCs. For example, the [C2mpyr][BF4] system allows higher diffusivities than the thiocyanate system but the photovoltaic performance is similar. Indeed, despite considerable study, the physical–chemical relationships that influence the performance of DSSCs containing ionic liquids are also not yet well understood. The [C1mpyr][PF6] OIPC species shows high dark current, which is possibly related to higher recombination rates as the series resistance (Rs, Table 2) is relatively low, and the fill factor is significantly lower as a result. The two OIPC electrolytes that utilize the N(CN)2 anion display the highest open circuit voltages, which is likely to be related to interaction of the anion with the TiO2 surface. The same effect has been observed for DSSCs utilizing the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ionic liquid.45 Ionic liquids that utilise this anion are considered to be somewhat basic in the Lewis and Brønsted senses,49 as a result of their electron donating ability, thus it is expected that these plastic crystals will also have basic character. This is likely to shift the conduction band of the TiO2 to more negative potentials, by charge donation to the TiO2 surface layer, thereby increasing the open circuit voltage. This effect, in combination with the high currents effected by the excellent diffusivities in the [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] electrolyte, allows the device to achieve over 5% efficiency at 100% sun. The photocurrent action spectrum of the DSSC utilising the [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] electrolyte is shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI†. The maximum IPCE is 56.5% @ 535 nm and the Isc calculated from the IPCE spectrum is 8.53 mA cm−2.

At 68% sun intensity, the performance of the device utilizing the [C1mpyr][N(CN)2] is 5.3% (Fig. 5), indicating the additional promise of the devices in low-light applications. The performance of the DSSC shows only a slight diffusion limitation at 100% sun (inset, Fig. 5), which is highly desirable behaviour for a solid state electrolyte as it implies that further modifications of the DSSC, such as the nature of the dye or alterations to the structure or composition of the semiconductor layer, may yield even higher efficiencies. This observation is also in contrast to the behaviour of DSSCs utilizing the molecular plastic crystal succinonitrile, which showed significantly reduced efficiencies at full sun compared to lower light intensities, which was attributed to poor charge screening.36 Ionic liquids generally give good fill factors in DSSCs, which is believed to be result of effective screening of electric charges, with the high ion concentration enabling increased charge separation,50 although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. The ionic nature of the organic ionic plastic crystals is likely to impart similar benefits. Indeed, the fill factors for all of the devices utilizing the OIPCs are over 0.7 (Table 3).

Experimental
Synthesis of the salts was via alkylation of methylpyrrolidine with an alkyl halide to form the halide salt, followed by metathesis into the plastic crystal using a metal salt of the anion and subsequent purification by recrystallisation.39,41,43,51,52 Full synthetic details are given in the ESI†. The composition of the electrolytes is also summarized in the ESI†.
The thermal behaviour of the organic ionic plastic crystal electrolytes was measured by differential scanning calorimetry, in aluminium pans loaded under N2, at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. Low temperature transitions were calibrated with cyclohexane and higher temperature transitions were calibrated with indium, tin and zinc. Peaks at temperatures below the melt originate from solid–solid transitions; the highest temperature solid phase is denoted as phase I, with subsequent lower temperature phases denoted as phase II, III, etc.
Conductivity of the electrolytes was measured by AC impedance spectroscopy using a frequency response analyser (Solartron 1296) with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz and a signal voltage of 0.1 V, from −40 °C to 90 °C at 5 degree intervals controlled using a Eurotherm Model 2204 temperature controller under the Solartron software control. A barrel cell with steel plates was used; the samples were pressed into pellets 13 mm in diameter and with thicknesses of 1–2 mm, accurately measured using a digital calliper, under a N2 atmosphere.
For the solar cell assembly and testing, the working electrodes were prepared by screen printing one transparent layer (∼6 μm each) from a paste of 18 nm TiO2 particles (JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., Kitakyushu-Shi, Japan) onto FTO glass and one scattering layer of 400 nm TiO2 (∼6 μm thick), followed by sintering (working electrode area 0.16 cm2). The working electrodes were also treated with TiCl4. Before dyeing they were heated to 500 °C then 110 °C for 30 minutes each. The electrodes were dyed by immersion into a solution of 0.5 mM N719 dye53 (Dyesol, purified54) in a 1:1 volume mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol and stored for 24 hours in the dark before rinsing with acetonitrile and drying under nitrogen.
The platinised FTO glass counter electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 in isopropanol (0.05 M) at ca. 450 °C for 15 minutes, cooled to room temperature and used immediately. The working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together and sealed with a 25 μm Surlyn (DuPont) gasket and filled with the molten plastic crystal electrolyte by back filling under vacuum. Wires were soldered onto the glass electrodes using an ultrasonic solder.
The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs with the new OIPC electrolytes were measured using simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel solar simulator, with an AM 1.5 filter before the xenon lamp, and a computer controlled potentiostat (Keithley 2400, SourceMeter). The cells were masked by placing in a black metal holder and testing jig that ensured illumination of only the working electrode area and illumination only through the top of the cell, not the sides. Cells were biased from high to low, with 10 mV steps, and the settling time was 1 second. The settling time is the delay between the application of a bias and the current measurement; a comparatively long settling time was required to avoid measurement artefacts due to mass transport of the redox couples in the electrolyte. The power of the simulated light was calibrated with a reference silicon photodiode and the test cells were positioned mechanically to ensure that they were placed in exactly the same position as the calibration cell.
Conclusions
Organic ionic plastic crystals represent an exciting new class of solid state electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells. These materials are quite unique in their material properties and conduction mechanisms and offer a promising alternative to the traditional quasi solid-state systems. The ionic nature of these plastic crystals imparts the additional advantage of non-flammability and non-volatility over the more conventional molecular species. Comparison of a range of different organic ionic plastic crystal materials as solid state electrolytes reveals that the photo-conversion efficiencies of the DSSC devices is not dependent solely on the conductivity or diffusivity of the matrix; for example, the basicity of the dicyanamide anion is a significant factor. The dicyanamide salts show particular promise as new materials for photovoltaic applications, with the pyrrolidinium-based species achieving photo-conversion efficiencies of over 5%.

Broader context
Given the increasingly urgent need for alternative energy sources, new types of solid state electrolytes are desperately needed for a range of electrochemical devices. Arguably, one the most important of these devices is the dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC). For the commercialisation and wide-spread practical use of these new photovoltaics they must offer competitive efficiencies and stabilities, and hence the elimination of liquid electrolytes, which are volatile and prone to leakage, is crucial. Organic ionic plastic crystals are unique solid-state materials in terms of both their mechanical and transport properties; they combine the advantages of fast ion conduction with electrochemical and thermal stability and non-volatility, even above their melting point, thus making them excellent matrix materials for DSSC electrolytes. Furthermore, it is anticipated that solid state electrolytes utilising these materials will be suitable for mechanical printing, which is crucial for the large scale production of DSSCs by reel-to-reel processing.


 	Fig. 1  Thermal behaviour of the archetypal organic ionic plastic crystal N-methyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, [C2mpyr][NTf2]. The figure also shows the crystal structures of the material,27 viewed with a slight skew along the b axis, in phase IV (−120 °C) and phase III (−60 °C), showing the layering of the cations (blue/grey) and anions (green/blue) and demonstrating the increase in disorder as the temperature is raised. The disorder increases with every phase transition until the material is in the melt.27
