Introduction
Solar cells, which convert solar energy into electrical energy, are some of the important solutions to the energy crisis. Recently, lightweight and bendable flexible solar cells have attracted intense interest,1–6 because they are potentially useful for constructing portable and wearable power sources. Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) and nanobelts (NBs) can be employed to fabricate flexible devices. NW/NB based solar cells can serve as novel power sources for nano-optoelectronic systems.7–10 Moreover, various methods have been developed to assemble nanostructures (nanowires, nanobelts, and nanotubes) over large areas, including electrical field assembling,11 microfluidic flowing,12 and bubble expansion processing,13etc. These studies promise a bright future for the application of the NW/NB based solar cells. Schottky junction based solar cells have many advantages over p–n junction based solar cells, such as a simple fabrication process and material universality. For example, they can be made using unipolar semiconductors. However, so far, few studies on flexible solar cells based on NW/NB Schottky junctions have been reported.
CdSe has a direct bandgap of 1.74 eV, and its absorption spectrum covers most part of the solar light wavelength range. Therefore, CdSe is an important material for solar energy conversion applications.14–18 Graphene, a two-dimensional, conjugated, honeycomb lattice structured carbon material, has high electrical conductivity, flexibility, and transparency.19,20 Semiconductor NWs (NBs) are suitable materials for flexible devices.21,22 In this work, we fabricated CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction flexible solar cells on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates for the first time. Herein, graphene is used to replace the metal in conventional Schottky junction devices. The solar cells have an excellent rectification behavior in the dark with a typical on/off current ratio of about 2 × 105. Under air mass (AM) 1.5 global (1.5G) illumination, such typical solar cells exhibit a good photovoltaic (PV) behavior. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and energy conversion efficiency (η) are about 0.31 V, 4.73 mA cm−2, 36.14%, and 0.53%, respectively. The performance of the solar cells does not change obviously under bending conditions.
Experimental section
Both the n-type CdSe NBs and graphene in this work were synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.23,24 For synthesis of CdSe NBs, CdSe (99.99%) powders and indium particles were used as the source and the donor, respectively. Si substrates covered with 10 nm-thick thermally evaporated Au catalysts were used as the substrates. For the synthesis of graphene, a 25 μm thick high purity (99.99%) Cu foil and CH4 gas were used as the substrate and the source, respectively. The system was heated using a tube furnace. Graphene was transferred onto the substrates using the stamp method with the help of PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate).25
As the first step to fabricate the CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction solar cells, a CdSe NB suspension in ethanol was dropped on a piece of the PET substrate. Then, an In/Au (10/100 nm) ohmic contact electrode was made at one end of a CdSe NB on the substrate using UV lithography, thermal evaporation, and lift-off processes. Then, graphene was transferred onto PET to form a Schottky contact electrode on the other end of the CdSe NB using the following patterning process, including UV lithography (SUSS MicroTec MJB4), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Finally, a 100 nm thick Au ohmic contact electrode was fabricated on graphene. A schematic diagram of the device is illustrated in Fig. 2a.
The optical image of the device was taken using an optical microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager A2m). The PL and Raman spectra were collected using a microzone confocal Raman spectroscope (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, LabRam HR800) excited using a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser. The synthesized CdSe NBs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Nova Nano SEM 430) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; FEI Tecnai F30). The electrical properties of graphene were measured using a Hall measurement system (Accent HL5500). The transparency spectrum was measured using a UV-VIS-NIR recording spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3100). Room temperature electrical transport and PV properties of the solar cells were characterized using two semiconductor characterization systems (Keithley 4200, 2400) together with a solar simulator (Newport 91160-1000) with a calibrated illumination power density of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the typical FESEM image of the CdSe NBs. The NBs are about ten to hundreds of micrometers in length, sub-micrometer to several micrometers in width, and hundreds of nanometers in thickness. The typical HRTEM image of a CdSe NB is shown in Fig. 1b. The crystal planes with spacing distances of about 0.71 nm and 0.37 nm are clearly seen. According to the JCPDS card (no. 77-2307), these planes can be indexed, respectively, as {00} and {010} crystal planes of hexagonal CdSe. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in the inset. By carefully checking of the included angles of the SAED pattern and the corresponding spacing distances of the crystal planes, we can index the zone axis of the NB to be [100] and the growth direction of it to be 〈120〉. The corresponding Miller indices are labelled in figures. Fig. 1c shows the typical room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of a single CdSe NB. Only a strong near-band edge emission centered at around 710 nm (∼1.74 eV) is observed, indicating the high quality of the CdSe NBs.26 The typical Raman spectrum of graphene transferred on a Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrate is shown in Fig. 1d. The G peak (∼1588 cm−1) and the 2D peak (∼2649 cm−1) are clearly observed. The intensity ratio of the G peak to the 2D peak (IG/I2D) is about 0.86, indicating the formation of bilayer graphene. A tiny D peak (about 1324 cm−1) is observed, which reveals a small percentage of defects.27,28 The transparency spectrum of graphene is shown in Fig. 1e. The transparency of graphene is high (>97%) in the range with wavelengths longer than 500 nm. The sheet resistance, hole concentration, and mobility of graphene, obtained by the Hall measurements, are about 714.8 Ω sq−1, 9.26 × 1012 cm−2, and 943 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

Fig. 3a shows the room-temperature current (I)–voltage (V) curve of an as-fabricated solar cell in the dark. The I–V curve shows an excellent rectification behavior. The on/off current ratio between −1 V and 1 V is about 2 × 105. For high-mobility semiconductors, such as CdSe, etc., we can use the theory of thermionic emission of electrons to describe the I–V relation of a Schottky junction diode. Therefore, by fitting the measured I–V curve using the equation I = I0[exp(eV/nkT) − 1], where I0, e, V, n, k, and T are the reverse saturation current, the electronic charge, the applied bias, the diode ideality factor, the Boltzmann constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively,29 we can obtain the ideality factor n of about 2.33.

(c) Room-temperature I–V curves of the solar cell at bending angles of 0°, 30°, 65°, 82°, and 105°, as well as after 60 bending cycles. The schematic diagram of the measuring method is depicted in the inset. (d) The energy band diagram of a CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction under light illumination. ΦG is the work function of graphene, ΦB is the Schottky barrier height, Vi is the build-in potential, V is the output voltage of the solar cell, and χS is the electron affinity of CdSe. E0, EC, EV, and EF are the vacuum level, the conduction band edge, the valence band edge, and the Fermi level of CdSe, respectively. 
The room-temperature I–V curve of the solar cell under AM 1.5G illumination is plotted in Fig. 3b. We can see that the device exhibits a clear PV behavior, with the Voc, Jsc, and FF of about 0.31 V, 4.73 mA cm−2, and 36.14%, respectively. The effective Schottky junction area (the overlapping area of the CdSe NB and graphene, where the electrons and holes are separated) used to calculate the current density is about 133.4 μm2, as shown in Fig. 2b. Then we evaluated the solar cell by calculating the energy conversion efficiency using the equation η = FF·Jsc·Voc/Pin, where Pin is the illumination light power density (100 mW cm−2). We obtain the energy conversion efficiency of about 0.53%. Furthermore, as a flexible application, we investigated the performance of the device under different bending conditions. Typical PV behaviors of the solar cell at bending angles of about 0°, 30°, 65°, 82°, and 105° are shown in Fig. 3c. Herein, the bending angle is defined as the corresponding central angle when the bending region is regarded as a circular arc of a whole circle, as shown in the inset. The performance of the solar cell after 60 bending cycles is also shown in Fig. 3c. The energy conversion efficiencies under different bending conditions are given in the legend. We can see that the performance of the solar cell does not change obviously under these bending conditions. We attribute the satisfactory performance of the flexible solar cell to the high quality of the CdSe NB and high transparency and conductivity of graphene, which is used to replace the metal in conventional Schottky junction devices.
The energy band diagram for the CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction is shown in Fig. 3d. Based on this, the mechanism of the Schottky junction solar cell can be explained as follows: a Schottky barrier is formed in the CdSe NB near the interface due to the difference between the work-function of graphene (∼4.66 eV) and the electron affinity of CdSe (∼4.3 eV). Under light illumination, the photo-generated holes (h+) and electrons (e−) in the depletion region and within a diffusion length of the junction are driven by the built-in electric field toward graphene and the CdSe NB, respectively, and produce an output voltage. If the solar cell is open-circuited, the voltage corresponds to the open-circuit voltage (Voc). When the solar cell is short-circuited, the extracted photo-generated electrons and holes will transit through the external circuit to produce a short-circuited current (Isc).
Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated flexible CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction solar cells for the first time. In this work, we used graphene to replace the metal in a conventional Schottky junction. Compared to the traditional metals, graphene has the advantage of high light transparency and flexibility. The CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junctions have excellent rectification behavior with a typical on/off current ratio of about 2 × 105. Under AM 1.5G light illumination, the devices exhibit good PV behavior, with typical Voc, Jsc, and FF values of about 0.31 V, 4.73 mA cm−2, and 36.14%, respectively. The corresponding energy conversion efficiency is about 0.53%. The performance of the solar cells does not change obviously under bending conditions. We attribute the satisfactory performance of the flexible solar cells to the ingenious nanomaterials and Schottky junction device structures employed. Our work shows that the semiconductor NBs (NWs) and graphene are promising building blocks for future flexible devices, and the CdSe NB/graphene Schottky junction solar cells have potential applications in flexible nano-optoelectronic systems.
