    , Accepted 5th December 2013First published on 5th December 2013AbstractMultifunctional all-TiO2 Bragg stacks displaying structural color are fabricated by sequentially spin coating two TiO2 nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes. We find that Bragg stacks generated by simple sequential deposition of the two nanoparticles have poor reflective properties compared to what would be expected based on the optical properties of individual TiO2 nanoparticle layers. This poor photonic property is due to the cross-contamination of neighboring layers during the deposition process; that is, small TiO2 nanoparticles infiltrate the pre-existing TiO2 nanoparticle layers, changing their optical properties. A sacrificial polymer-blocking layer is added between the low- and high-refractive-index layers to prevent their cross-contamination upon fabrication, which, in turn, significantly improves the overall photonic performance of these all-TiO2 Bragg stacks. All-TiO2 Bragg stacks exhibit excellent superhydrophilicity and self-cleaning properties, due to the porosity of the stacked structure and the photocatalytic nature of TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively, enabling patterning of wettability in these multilayer structures. Additionally, we demonstrate that the high quality photonic properties of these all-TiO2 multilayer structures render them ideal for use in enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
Introduction
Bragg stacks (BSs), also known as Bragg reflectors or one-dimensional photonic crystals, have numerous applications including sensing,1–4 energy conversion,5,6 and optical filtering.7,8 These photonic structures are typically composed of periodically alternating layers with different refractive indices.3,9–11 The critical parameters that control the photonic properties of the BS are the thickness and refractive index of each layer as well as the total number of layers. Specifically, by interdependently manipulating the refractive index contrast between alternating layers, the layer thicknesses, and the total number of layers, the BS can be tuned to have a strong reflectance band in the visible region, resulting in the formation of structural color. Unlike pigment-based color which can be degraded by various environmental factors such as ultraviolet light,12,13 structural color has a high stability against deterioration caused by such conditional effects.
One pair of materials that have been widely used to generate BSs with tunable structural color are TiO2 and SiO2.1,10,11,14 These two common oxides are optically transparent in the visible range and have a large difference in their refractive indices (refractive indices of TiO2 and SiO2 are 2.0–2.7 and 1.38–1.48, respectively15–18). Also mesoporous BSs made by depositing alternating layers of SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to possess useful functionalities such as superhydrophilicity and self-cleaning properties, and show tunable optical responses to changes in the environmental factors such as humidity.11,14,19 BSs also recently have been used to enhance the light harvesting efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.5,6,20
The use of SiO2 as the low-index region of TiO2/SiO2-based BSs, however, presents some drawbacks that limit the functionality of these BSs in various applications.21 In particular, the photocatalytic capability and photoconductivity of these BSs are significantly compromised due to the presence of insulating SiO2 layers, which minimizes their effectiveness when used in photoactive devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells, as self-cleaning surfaces, and for water-splitting structures. One way to overcome the drawback of using insulating SiO2 is to generate all-TiO2 BSs with comparable photonic properties. Fabrication of all-TiO2 BSs requires the use of two TiO2 layers with a significant contrast in their refractive indices. Recent studies have shown that BSs can indeed be built by sequentially depositing TiO2 particles with different sizes and shapes22 or by using an evaporation induced self-assembly block copolymer-templated sol–gel method.23 The photonic properties of these all-TiO2 BSs have generally been inferior to the ones generated with alternating SiO2 and TiO2 layers likely due to the small contrast in refractive indices of different layers and the difficulty in precisely controlling the structure and optical properties of each layer.
In this work, we describe a straightforward and robust method to produce high quality all-TiO2 BSs exhibiting structural color by spin coating TiO2 NPs of different shapes and sizes; spherical and discoidal shaped TiO2 NPs are used to form the two differently indexed layers. A critical process that enables the formation of all-TiO2 BSs composed of alternating layers of high- and low-index is to prevent the cross-contamination of the neighboring layers during sequential deposition of the two TiO2 NPs. We achieve this goal by using what we call a sacrificial blocking layer deposited in between a pre-existing low-index layer and a high-index layer to be deposited. The blocking layer is subsequently removed after high-index-layer deposition using calcination in air. All-TiO2 BSs based on this approach have a well-defined reflectance band in the visible region with close to 90% peak reflectance. In addition to brilliant structural color, these BSs exhibit excellent superhydrophilicity and self-cleaning properties owing to the nanoporosity of the structure and the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NPs. The wettability of these BSs can be patterned by hydrophobic modification of TiO2 nanoparticles in the multilayer structures followed by selective removal of hydrophobic moieties using the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that the conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is enhanced by incorporating these all-TiO2 BSs into the photoanodes.
Results and discussion
TiO2 layers with different refractive indices are generated by depositing TiO2 NPs of different shapes. Previous computational studies and experimental work have demonstrated that the shape of particles can significantly affect their packing.24–26 We hypothesize that the spin coating of TiO2 particles of different shapes results in the formation of nanoparticle films with different refractive indices (i.e., porosities). To produce two layers of substantially different refractive indices, we use a spherically shaped TiO2 NP with size ranging between 5 and 15 nm (∼10 nm average), and a discoidally shaped TiO2 NP with a diameter of 30–40 nm and a thickness of ∼10 nm.
To fabricate BSs with desired photonic properties (i.e., structural color), it is critical to understand the optical characteristics of each layer. We use spin coating to generate individual layers of spherical and discoidal TiO2 NPs. Spin coating generates uniform NP films in a short period of time and enables precise control of the thickness of the resulting films.27,28 The film thickness decreases with the rotational speed of spin coating and increases with the concentration of TiO2 suspension (see ESI†). Spin-coated TiO2 NP films are calcined at 500 °C for two hours to remove residual organic compounds in the NP layers and to enhance their mechanical properties. Interestingly, the refractive index of the discoidal nanoparticle film decreases substantially after calcination, which indicates a significant increase in the film porosity, with only a small change in the film thickness (see ESI†). Such changes suggest that the discoidal nanoparticles form some type of a percolated network structure that maintains its structural integrity during the removal of the organic components in the nanoparticle film by calcination.11 Calcination is also an important part of our fabrication protocol used for successfully creating an all-TiO2 Bragg stack, the significance of which we will discuss later. In addition to the thickness and refractive index of these calcined films, we determine the film porosity and the refractive index of the NPs using solution ellipsometry.29
As summarized in Table 1, the refractive index of the spherical TiO2 NP film (1.95) is significantly higher than that of the discoidal TiO2 NP film (1.44). The difference in the refractive indices of these two TiO2 NP films is solely due to the difference in the packing density of the NPs as confirmed by the porosities of the two films (Table 1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of individual TiO2 layers (Fig. 1) also show that the discoidal TiO2 NP film has a higher porosity and larger pores compared to the spherical TiO2 NP film. These results confirm our hypothesis that TiO2 NPs of different shapes pack very differently, resulting in films with very different refractive indices. Remarkably, the refractive index of the discoidal TiO2 NP is greater than that of the spherical TiO2 NP, which again emphasizes that particle anisotropy has a more significant impact on the optical properties of the films than the refractive indices of the individual NPs themselves.

Bragg stacks (BSs) are fabricated by alternately depositing the two types of NPs onto pre-cleaned glass slides via spin coating until the desired number of layers is reached. The spin-coating condition (i.e., RPM) and NP concentrations are tuned to generate high- and low-index layers with thicknesses (hhigh = 64.1 nm and hlow = 86.8 nm) that would result in structural color with a strong reflectance band around 500 nm as determined by the transfer matrix method.30 To maintain the structure and robustness of the TiO2 NP layers, the multilayer structure is calcined at 500 °C for 2 h after spin coating of each layer. Transmittance spectra of all-TiO2 BSs with 5 to 11 layers given in Fig. 2a, display transmittance minima located around 530 nm which decrease with increasing number of NP layers. In this work, “layer” indicates each TiO2 nanoparticle layer, rather than a pair of layers.

Theoretical and experimental transmittance spectra for (b) 9-layer and (c) 11-layer all-TiO2 BSs. 
Comparison of the measured transmittance spectra of these BSs to those simulated based on the refractive indices of the two individual TiO2 NP layers31 shows, however, poor agreement as can be seen in Fig. 2b and c. In particular, the intensities of the transmittance minima in Fig. 2b and c are significantly different from those estimated based on theory. The intensity of the reflectance band is given by the following expression:32 (1)where nh, nl, and ns are the refractive index of the high-index layer, low-index layer, and substrate, respectively, and N is the total number of layers. Considering that the intensity of the reflectance band, R, depends strongly on the ratio of the refractive indices of the two alternating layers, these results seem to suggest that the refractive indices of the two TiO2 layers in the BSs may not be the same as those of individual TiO2 NP films on glass substrates.
We hypothesize that during the deposition of the high-index TiO2 layer on top of the low-index layer, infiltration of the high-index layer NPs occurs into the low-index layer, thereby resulting in the “contamination” of the low-index layer. Because of the larger pore size of the low-index layer, the spherical NPs comprising the high-index layers may penetrate the interstices of the low-index layer during the deposition process due to their comparable sizes. This is evident by examining the pore size of the low-index layer, as seen in Fig. 1a, and comparing this to the size of the spherical NPs (∼10 nm), making it plausible that these spherical NPs may penetrate and fill the voids of the low-index layers. The penetration of spherical NPs into the low-index region would, of course, increase its refractive index and result in smaller contrast in the refractive indices between the two alternating layers, and also potentially blur the sharpness of the interface between these two layers. Diffuse interfaces would lead to diminished reflection since strong reflection occurs through interference of the reflected beams from distinct boundaries between the two regions of refractive indices.
To test this hypothesis, we generate a two-layer film with a low-refractive-index TiO2 layer at the bottom and a high-refractive-index layer on top as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3a. The refractive index of each layer is determined using a two-layer Cauchy model in spectroscopic ellipsometry. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the refractive index of the top layer is similar to that of the spherical TiO2 NP film deposited on a glass slide, whereas the refractive index of the bottom layer (1.74) is significantly higher than that of the discoidal TiO2 NP film deposited on a glass slide (1.44). This result strongly supports our hypothesis that sequential deposition of NPs with significantly different porosity can lead to the contamination of highly porous layers, and thus, the fabrication of a BS with unexpectedly low quality structural color.

(b) Comparison of refractive indices of high- and low-refractive-index films after calcination in a two-layer film to those of nanoparticle (NP) films composed solely of discoidal and spherical TiO2 NPs. 
To prevent the infiltration of spherical TiO2 NPs into the low-index layers, we introduce a polymeric blocking layer between the two TiO2 layers as illustrated in Fig. 4a. We spin coat polystyrene (PS) on top of the low-index layer before depositing the high-index layer. To the best of our observations, we believe that PS fills the interstices of the low-index layer and forms a solid yet relatively thin overcoat layer on top of the low-index layer, preventing the penetration of spherical TiO2 NPs during the subsequent deposition process. The PS layer can be readily removed by calcination at 500 °C in air for two hours, restoring the porosity in the low-index layer. Fig. 4b shows that the refractive index of each layer after calcination in a two-layer film generated with a sacrificial blocking layer is similar to that obtained from the corresponding TiO2 NP layer deposited directly on a glass slide. These results indicate that adding a sacrificial blocking layer prevents the cross-contamination of neighboring layers with a negligible effect on the optical properties of individual layers. It is important to note that although the use of larger spherical TiO2 particles in place of the smaller spherical ones may prevent the contamination of the low-index layer, the high-index layer may become prone to contamination by the discoidal particles due to larger pores present between such large particles. Also, increased scattering by larger TiO2 particles as well as more diffuse interface that may form between large spherical particle- and discoidal particle-layers could potentially have a negative effect on the quality of the BSs.

(b) Comparison of refractive indices of high- and low-refractive-index films after calcination in a two-layer film with a PS-blocking layer deposited as described during fabrication to the refractive indices of discoidal and spherical TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) films. 
Bragg stacks (BSs) consisting of the two TiO2 NP layers are generated with PS-blocking layers in between the low- and high-index layers as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5a. The multilayer structures are calcined after the deposition of each high-index layer, which leads to the removal of the blocking layer and the mechanical reinforcement of the structure. We note that subsequent calcination of pre-existing layers after the first calcination does not alter the optical properties of the two TiO2 nanoparticle layers (see ESI†). Fig. 5b shows the transmittance spectra of all-TiO2 BSs generated with polymeric blocking layers. Compared to the spectra shown in Fig. 2a, the transmittance minima of the new BSs with the same number of TiO2 NP layers are significantly lower indicating a higher film reflectivity. For the 11-layer all-TiO2 BS, the transmittance intensity minimum of about 13% centers around 530 nm, yielding a vibrant yellowish green color as seen in Fig. 5d (see ESI† for a cross-sectional SEM image). Also the spectra of the 9- and 11-layer BSs made with PS-blocking layers show good agreement with the simulated results (Fig. 5c and d). A small difference in the wavelength location of the transmittance minima may be due to differences in the thicknesses of TiO2 layers that are formed on glass slides and on top of another TiO2 NP layer. These results confirm that the use of the sacrificial blocking layers is a critical procedure that enables the formation of high quality all-TiO2 BSs exhibiting structural color.

In addition to the photonic properties of all-TiO2 BSs, these multilayer structures exhibit potentially useful superhydrophilic and self-cleaning properties because of the porosity of TiO2 multilayer structure, and the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NPs.33–35 Time dependent changes in the water contact angle of all-TiO2 BSs (Fig. 6a) show that these structures are superhydrophilic, resulting in contact angle dropping to ∼5° in less than one second. The superhydrophilicity of these all-TiO2 BSs is due to the porosity of these structures and the “nanowicking” of water through the interconnected pores. In addition to the porosity driven superhydrophilicity, the wettability of these all-TiO2 BSs can be further enhanced by UV irradiation.35–37 This superhydrophilicity is an extremely useful property which prevents fogging of these film surfaces by water. Anti-fogging properties could be especially useful since fogging on optical structures such as the BSs we have fabricated can diminish the brilliance of their structural color.

The all-TiO2 BSs also possess self-cleaning properties which are useful for maintaining the photonic properties and the superhydrophilicity of these BSs. To investigate the self-cleaning properties of all-TiO2 BSs, a model contaminant, oleic acid, is spin coated onto the multilayer structures to render the BS surfaces hydrophobic, and, subsequently, the contaminated BSs are illuminated with ultraviolet light. The changes in the water contact angle of the UV-irradiated BSs are plotted in Fig. 6b. After being contaminated with oleic acid, the contact angle on the BSs increases to 45–60°, indicating the loss of superhydrophilicity; however, these structures quickly and fully recover their superhydrophilic behavior after two hours of UV irradiation. The regeneration rate of the superhydrophilic property of the multilayer films increases with the number of TiO2 NP layers.
The combination of hydrophilicity, porosity and photocatalytic activity of these all-TiO2 BSs make them ideal for generating patterns of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.38,39 An entire BS is first functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane via chemical vapor deposition to make the structure hydrophobic. Subsequently, the hydrophobic moieties can be selectively removed by irradiating the sample through a photo mask with a pattern. While such a structure does not show obvious patterning in its dry state (Fig. 7a), when the structure is exposed to a high humidity environment (e.g. achieved either by breathing on the structure or by holding the structure above boiling water), the capillary condensation within the UV-illuminated region makes the pattern appear due to significant contrast in the wettability between different areas in the structure as seen in Fig. 7b. The combination of the photonic properties, nanoporosity and patternability of the all-TiO2 Bragg stacks makes them suitable for colorimetric humidity sensing and may have potential applications in ink-jet printing and microreactors.38,40

One of the most interesting applications of all-TiO2 BSs, we believe, is their use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).41,42 One of the most important components of DSSCs is its photoanode, which consists of a mesoporous TiO2 film. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of a BS on top of a TiO2 photoanode can enhance the light harvesting efficiency by reflecting unabsorbed photons back to the TiO2 photoanode.6,20 One significant problem with common BSs that have been incorporated into DSSCs is that they are made with insulating SiO2 low-index layers, which compromises the photoconduction properties of the BSs and, in turn, those of the photoanodes. Thus, incorporating a high quality all-TiO2 BS can be advantageous in enhancing the device efficiency of the DSSC without compromising photoconductive properties of the photoanode.22
To test the effectiveness of our all-TiO2 BSs in enhancing the efficiency of the DSSCs, we fabricate and characterize a DSSC with a heterostructured photoanode consisting of an organized mesoporous TiO2 interfacial (om-TiO2 IF) layer, a nanocrystalline (NC) TiO2 layer and a 9-layer all-TiO2 BS as the bottom, middle, and top layer, respectively. DSSCs with photoanodes without BSs are also fabricated as control devices for comparison. We obtain the current–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs constructed based on the heterostructured TiO2 photoanodes with a liquid state electrolyte (Fig. 8). The values of the photovoltaic parameters including photovoltage (Voc), photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall conversion efficiency (η) of the tested DSSCs are summarized in Table 2.

The Jsc and η of the om-TiO2 IF/NC TiO2/all-TiO2 BS layer based cell is significantly higher than that of the om-TiO2 IF/NC TiO2 layer based cell as shown in Fig. 8. As demonstrated in our previous reports,20,43 one possible contribution to enhanced device efficiency (η) is the reflection of the unabsorbed photons by the BS layer back to the TiO2 photoanode, which in turn enhances the light harvesting properties of the device, as can be deduced from the enhanced Jsc. Furthermore, enhanced light harvesting could also be due to the additional dye that is absorbed on the all-TiO2 BS layer, which in itself functions as the photoanode and thus contributes significantly to the generation, transport, and collection of photoexcited electrons. Accordingly, by depositing all-TiO2 BS on the heterostructured photoanode, the IPCE value improves from 71% to 82% around 520 nm, indicating the reflection of unabsorbed photons by the Bragg stack leads to enhanced light harvesting by the photoanode.
Conclusions
We have successfully generated high quality all-TiO2 BSs exhibiting structural color by alternately depositing TiO2 NPs of different shapes and sizes. It is critical to prevent the penetration of spherical TiO2 NPs into the highly porous low-index TiO2 NP layer, which we achieve using a sacrificial blocking layer. This approach allows the formation of all-TiO2 BSs with a strong reflectance band. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NPs and the nanoporosity of the BSs impart these periodic multilayer structures with useful self-cleaning and superhydrophilic properties. We also demonstrate these all-TiO2 BSs can be patterned to exhibit selective wetting under humidified conditions and can be incorporated into the photoanodes of DSSCs to enhance the light harvesting efficiency of these devices. We believe sacrificial blocking layers can be useful in generating a variety of multilayered NP assemblies that could be used in applications including photonics, sensing, catalysis, and separations.

Fabrication of all-TiO2 BSs
Before building all-TiO2 NP layers, glass substrates were cleaned with 0.1 M NaOH in a sonicator for 20 min, rinsed with deionized water, and dried with nitrogen. To fabricate the BSs, a spherical TiO2 NP film was first spin coated using 10 wt% suspension on a glass slide, followed by a thermal treatment in a furnace at 500 °C for two hours (heat up rate 5 °C min−1). A discoidal TiO2 NP film was deposited on top of the calcined high-index layer using 7 wt% suspension. A PS-blocking layer was subsequently deposited on top of the low-index layer using 0.75 wt% solution. Next, a spherical TiO2 NP film was spin coated on top of the existing stack. The multilayer stack was then subjected to calcination at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to 500 °C, holding for two hours to remove the PS and mechanically reinforce the multilayer structure. The deposition was repeated until the desired number of TiO2 layers was reached. Spin coating was achieved using a Laurell Technologies Co., WS-400BZ-6NPP/Lite commercial spin coater at a rotational speed of 4000 rpm for 1 min. To control the thickness of each layer, the TiO2 NP suspensions and the PS solution were diluted with deionized water and toluene, respectively.
Self-cleaning property test
The surface of a BS was contaminated by spin coating a 1 wt% solution of oleic acid dissolved in acetone. The contaminated samples were irradiated with ultraviolet light (wavelength = 260 nm). Water contact angle of UV-irradiated structures was measured using a Goniometer (Attension, Theta) every 30 minutes.
Formation of organized mesoporous-TiO2 interfacial layer (om-TiO2 IF layer) (bottom photoanode layer)
Before deposition of the om-TiO2 IF layer, the FTO glass substrates were cleaned with isopropanol and chloroform in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min in each case, respectively. Meanwhile, the om-TiO2 IF layer solutions are prepared using an atomic transfer radical polymerization and a sol–gel process, in which a polyvinyl chloride-g-poly(oxyethylene) methacrylate graft copolymer is used as a structure directing agent, according to a previously reported method.20 Then, as prepared om-TiO2 IF layer solutions were deposited onto the FTO glass pieces at 1500 rpm for 30 s using a SMSS Delta 80BM spin coater. After spin coating, the om-TiO2 IF layers were put into a vacuum oven and treated at 50 °C for 30 min. After being dried in an oven at 50 °C overnight, the samples were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min in order to remove residual organics.
Fabrication of DSSCs
To form the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (NC TiO2 layer), a commercial TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide D20, Solaronix) was cast onto the om-TiO2 IF layer coated FTO glass using a doctor-blade technique in order to obtain smooth and uniform films. Then, the om-TiO2 IF/NC TiO2 layer coated FTO glass substrates were heated to 450 °C for 30 min in air. The 9-layer all-TiO2 BSs were subsequently built onto the om-TiO2 IF/NC TiO2 layer coated FTO glass substrates with the procedure described above. The heterostructured TiO2 photoanodes were sensitized overnight in a Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2 dye (dcbpy = 2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato) solution (N719, 535-bisTBA, Solaronix, 13 mg, dissolved in 50 g distilled ethanol).
DSSC with an active area of 0.40 cm2 was constructed via dropcasting of a liquid electrolyte onto the photoanode and covering the photoanode with a Pt-coated counter electrode, using our previously reported procedure.20,43 DSSCs with liquid electrolyte were assembled using 60 μm thick Surlyn as the spacer between the photoanode and the counter electrode. The inner space of the DSSCs was then filled with a liquid electrolyte solution through a drilled hole in the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte solution was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15). The counterelectrodes were prepared via spin coating of a 4 wt% H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution onto the conductive FTO glass, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min.
TiO2 NP film and DSSC characterization
The thickness, the refractive index, and the porosity of TiO2 NP films were determined using an alpha-SE spectroscopic ellipsometer and the Complete EASE software package (J.A. Woollam). Measurements were performed from 380 nm to 900 nm at an incident angle of 70° and data were fitted using a Cauchy model. The refractive indices were obtained at 632.8 nm and the porosity was measured using a reported method based on solution spectroscopic ellipsometry.29 Transmittance spectra were acquired using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR double port spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Each measurement was deducted by a baseline correction of transmittance of a blank glass slide. Scanning electron microscopy images were taken using a FEI-600 Quanta. Sessile-drop contact angle measurements were made and determined from video files using a Goniometer (Attension, Theta) and Young–Laplace equation in the Attension software package provided by the manufacturer. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs was measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm (K3100) under short circuit conditions using an irradiation of a 300 W Xenon lamp, which was obtained by a series of light filters with different wavelengths. Photoelectrochemical performances were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light intensity was homogeneous over an 8 × 8 in2 area, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate no. C-ISE269) for a sunlight intensity of one (100 mW cm−2). This calibration was verified with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.). The DSSCs temperature was maintained at 25 °C throughout the measurement time using a peltier cooling apparatus. The photoelectrochemical performances were calculated by the following equations: (2) (3)where Jsc is a short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is an open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is an incident light power, FF is the fill factor, η is an overall energy conversion efficiency, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of maximum power output.
