    , Accepted 23rd December 2011First published on 27th January 2012AbstractTwo novel heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizers, TT204 and TT205, containing bulky substituents at the 4,4-positions of the ancillary 2,2-bipyridine ligand, were synthesized and characterized. They exhibit absorption maxima in the visible region at 520–530 nm due to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. The EHOMO and ELUMO values indicate sufficient driving force for efficient dye regeneration by the iodide/tri-iodide redox electrolyte and efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band following photoexcitation, respectively. The performance of these heteroleptic sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells was investigated where TiO2 sensitization was carried out both in the presence and absence of chenodeoxycholic acid. The best efficiency among these sensitizers was recorded in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid which generated a high short circuit current of 18.7 mA cm−2, an open circuit potential of 0.72 V and a fill factor of 73% with a resulting total power conversion efficiency of 9.81% under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination. Comparison with the reference dye C101 indicates that though bulky groups can prevent aggregation resulting in high photocurrents even in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid, they can also lead to lower cell voltages due to inefficient dye packing on the TiO2 surface.
1. Introduction
Since the seminal paper by O'Regan and Grätzel,1 many efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of molecular dyes that are capable of harvesting light and injecting electrons efficiently into the semiconductor metal-oxide conduction band.2–6 A large part of the bibliography dealing with investigations into new sensitizers has focused on ruthenium-based sensitizers.7 The paradigm for this class of dye is generally considered to be N7198 (Fig. 1) and it is still among the most efficient ruthenium complexes used in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs). More recently, sensitizers such as C1019 and B1110 (Fig. 1) have been designed in order to absorb longer wavelengths in the Visible region. This has been achieved through increased conjugation on the ancillary bipyridine ligand by the incorporation of one or more thiophene units. In fact, these novel ruthenium polypyridine complexes show outstanding photocurrents leading to light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of higher than 11%.

Most of the published reports using efficient ruthenium polypyridine complexes require the presence of co-adsorbents (as for example chenodeoxycholic acid) that minimize the formation of molecular aggregates on the surface of the TiO2 nanocrystalline film. Several studies have detailed the negative effect of aggregation on device performance11 and the improvement resulting from using co-adsorbents.12 Bulky groups in the sensitizer molecular structure can also reduce aggregation, however, such groups have not been employed in ruthenium polypyridine complexes and little is known of the effect of such groups on dye packing and cell performance. Alkyl chains have, however, been incorporated into ruthenium complexes on the 4,4′-positions of the 2,2′-bipyridine, as for example in the dye Z907,13,14 leading to improvements in cell stability over long periods of continuous illumination. Moreover, ruthenium complexes have been shown to display improved efficiencies with increasing alkyl chain length.15 Indeed, many research groups have adopted a similar strategy, using alkyl chains in the molecular design of dye sensitizers, with increased efficiencies observed.16–19 The reason for such efficiency improvements has often been cited as the reduction in the back electron transfer reactions between the photo-injected electrons and the oxidized species in the electrolyte. The presence of the alkyl chains retards such interfacial charge transfer recombination reactions leading to an increase in electron lifetime.
The use of more bulky structures present in sensitizers has generally only been exploited for phthalocyanine and porphyrin sensitizers. Mori and co-workers20 increased device efficiency in a series of phthalocyanines bearing bulky aryl groups. The outstanding porphyrin YD-221 bears both alkyl chains and bulky tert-butyl groups. In this paper we report the synthesis and characterization of two novel C101 analogues, TT204 and TT205 (Fig. 2) that contain bulky groups on the ancillary bipyridine ligand. We analyse their performances in DSC devices under working conditions and, moreover, the interfacial charge transfer reactions are investigated. Furthermore, we correlate dye structure with function for these novel sensitizers. This study allows for further understanding of ruthenium complexes in DSCs, which it is hoped will ultimately lead to higher light-to-energy conversion efficiencies and improvements in device stability.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and reagents
Chemicals employed in this work were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as received without further purification. C101 dye was supplied by the EU FP7 research project ROBUST. Dry solvents were purchased from SDS in anhydrous grade and further dried over activated molecular sieves. The monitoring of the reactions was carried out by TLC, employing aluminium sheets coated with silica gel 60 F254 (normal phase) or with LiChroprep RP-18 F254-S (reverse phase), both purchased from Merck. Purification of compounds was performed by flash column chromatography using silica gel Merck-60 (230–400 mesh, 0.040–0.063 mm) or Aldrich Sephadex LH-20. EI-MS spectra were determined on a VG AutoSpec instrument, MALDI-TOF MS and HRMS spectra were recorded with a Bruker Reflex III spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AC-300 instrument with a laser beam operating at 337 nm. Dithranol (1,8,9-anthracenetriol) and PEGNa1000 poly(ethylenglycol)-1000 were used as matrix and internal reference, respectively. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrophotometer from solid samples embedded in pressed disks of KBr.

Synthesis of bipyridines 3 and 4. 

n-Butyllithium (5.72 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 14.0 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1 (for 3) or 2 (for 4) (11.9 mmol) in anhydrous THF (15 mL) at −78 °C under argon atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 30 min and then for 1.5 h at room temperature. The reaction was then cooled again to −78 °C and tributyltin chloride (5.0 g, 15.0 mmol) was added. After stirring for 4 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by adding saturated NH4Cl aqueous solution (5 mL). The mixture was then extracted with CH2Cl2 and dried over MgSO4. After the removal of the solvent, the crude of the corresponding tributylstannylthiophene (10 mmol) was mixed with 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine1 (1.00 g, 3.2 mmol) in 100 mL of dry DMF. The catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 (0.13 g, 0.16 mmol) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at 85 °C under Ar overnight. After vacuum evaporation of DMF, the resulting solid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using CH2Cl2 as eluent to afford 1.15 g (60%) of 3 or 900 mg (55%) of 4 as ivory white solids.

Synthesis of Ru(II) complexes TT204 and TT205. 
Dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer (195.8 mg, 0.32 mmol) and 3 (for TT204) or 4 (for TT205) (0.64 mmol) were dissolved in dry DMF. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h under Ar in the dark. Subsequently, 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine (156 mg, 0.64 mmol) was added into the flask and the reaction mixture was stirred at 140 °C for 4 h. Finally, an excess of NH4NCS (2.0 g, 26.5 mmol) was added to the resulting dark solution and the reaction was stirred for another 4 h at the same temperature. The crude was cooled down to room temperature and the solvent was removed under vacuum. Water was then added to obtain a dark precipitate. The solid was collected by suction filtration, washed with water (200 mL) and Et2O (2 × 60 mL), and dried under vacuum. The crude complex was dissolved in basic methanol (NaOH) and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column with methanol as eluent. The solution obtained was acidified with a mixture of methanol and HNO3 and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude was dissolved in THF (100 mL), and 1 eq of NaOH was added. Then, the solution was washed with brine (2 × 50mL) and the solvent was removed obtaining the complexes TT204 (230 mg, 35%) and TT205 (272 mg, 45%) as brown solids.

2.3 Optical, electrochemical, and spectroscopic measurements
The UV-Visible and fluorescence spectra of solutions in 1 cm path length quartz cells were recorded using a Shimadzu™ UV-1700 spectrophotometer and an Aminco-Bowman™ Series 2 luminescence spectrometer with a temperature controller, respectively. The electrochemical data were obtained by employing a conventional three-electrode cell connected to a Model 600C Series CH Instruments potentiostat. For square wave voltammetry, a platinum wire working electrode, an SCE reference electrode and a platinum mesh as the auxiliary electrode were used. The laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were carried out by the same procedure as Clifford et al.22 employing a PTI nitrogen dye laser and a 150 W tungsten lamp as the light probe. The charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements were carried out with a set-up similar to that employed by O'Regan et al.23
2.4 Device preparation
In the present work two different types of TiO2 films are utilized depending on the measurements being conducted. Highly transparent thin films (4–7 μm) were utilized for L-TAS measurements and also for monitoring dye adsorption kinetics. L-TAS experiments were conducted on devices consisting of transparent TiO2 films with optical densities of around 0.5 a.u. at the maximum absorption wavelength. On the other hand, for efficient DSCs, devices were made using either 6 or 12 μm thick films consisting of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (Dyesol© paste) and a scatter layer of 5 μm of 400 nm TiO2 particles (CCIC, HPW-400). Prior to the deposition of the TiO2 paste the conducting glass substrates were immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) for 30 min and then dried. The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto a conducting glass substrate (NSG glass with 8 Ω cm−2 resistance) using the screen printing technique. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. The heated TiO2 electrodes were immersed again in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled before dye adsorption. In order to reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, a light shading mask was used onto the DSCs, so the active area of DSCs was fixed to 0.16 cm2. The counter electrode was made by spreading a 5 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol onto a conducting glass substrate (TEC15, Pilkington) with a small hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using vacuum, followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min. Dye solutions at concentrations of 300 μM in ethanol (containing chenodeoxycholic acid where indicated) were prepared and the film immersed overnight at R.T. The sensitized electrodes were washed with ethanol and dried under air. Finally, the working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn) frame that melts at 100 °C. For these solar cells the electrolyte used consisted of 1 M dimethyl-methyl imidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.05 M lithium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15). For L-TAS, charge extraction and transient photovoltage measurements, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) was used instead of dimethyl-methyl imidazolium iodide (DMII) in the electrolyte.
2.5 Device characterization
The photovoltaic measurements were carried out with a 450 W xenon light source (Osram XBO 450, Germany) with a filter (Schott 113), whose power was regulated to the AM 1.5G solar standard by using a reference Si photodiode equipped with a colour matched filter (KG-3, Schott) in order to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM 1.5G to less than 4%. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley™ 2400 digital source meter. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was plotted as a function of wavelength by using the light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA), which was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) onto the photovoltaic cell under testing. A computer controlled monochromator was incremented through the spectral range (300–900 nm) to generate a photocurrent action spectrum with a sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 4 s. In addition, photocurrent and continuous irradiated light intensity were measured simultaneously at each wavelength.
3. Results and discussion
The synthetic route to the new ligands involves three main steps, as depicted in Scheme 1. In the first one, thiophene was monoalkylated by a Friedel–Crafts reaction with the corresponding tertiary alcohol (4-propylheptan-4-ol (for 1) or 2-methylhexan-2-ol (for 2)) in the presence of BF3·Et2O. In order to avoid the formation of the respective dialkylated products, thiophene was used in a large excess (solvent). Subsequently, 4,4′-disubstituted bipyridines 3 and 4 were prepared by means of a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine and the corresponding tetrabutylstannylthiophenes. The latter were generated in situ by lithiation of 1 or 2 and quenching with tributyltin chloride. Finally, the ruthenium(II) complexes TT204 and TT205 were prepared in a typical one-pot synthesis24 and were fully characterized by NMR, MS, HR-MS, UV-vis and FT-IR.

 Fig. 3  Absorption and emission spectra of C101 (—), TT204 () and TT205 () in ethanol. 
The broad absorptions for all complexes in ethanol in the visible region centred on 520–530 nm are ascribed to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, which are typical for ruthenium polypyridal complexes. Excitation of this band produces very weak emission at 700–800 nm. The above data for C101 corresponds well with that already reported by Gao et al.9 HOMO and LUMO values calculated were quite similar for these three complexes indicating that the nature of the group on the 2-position of the thiophene unit on the ancillary bipyridal ligand has little bearing on the electronic properties of the dye. Furthermore, EHOMO and ELUMO values indicate efficient dye regeneration by the iodide/tri-iodide redox electrolyte (Eredox = −4.75 eV) and also efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band (ETiO2 = −4.0 eV). A small shift in the absorption and emission spectra of TT204 was observed and it is most likely due to dissociation of protons in solution25 in other words, less number of protons in TT204 compared to the TT205.
The absorption of thin TiO2 films (∼7 μm) was measured with time following sensitization in 300 μM solutions of C101, TT204 and TT205 at R.T. in the presence and absence of 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 4). The adsorption rate constant for each dye onto the TiO2 electrode Kads (min−1) could be obtained by fitting these data to the Lagargren Equation, as has been done previously:26 (1)
 Fig. 4  Absorption measured for 7 μm TiO2 films sensitized at R.T. in 300 μM solutions of C101, TT204 and TT205 in (a) the presence and (b) absence of 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid. Absorption was measured at 528, 523 and 528 nm for C101, TT204 and TT205 films respectively. The line corresponds to the fitting of the data to the Lagargren Equation. 
In the case of the solutions containing chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 4(a)) Kads for all dyes was found to be almost identical (0.014 min−1, 0.014 min−1 and 0.013 min−1 for C101, TT204, TT205 respectively) indicating that the presence of the bulky groups in TT204 and TT205 with respect to the alkyl chain on C101 have little effect upon dye adsorption kinetics. Surprisingly, Kads for films sensitized in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 4(b)) appear quite similar (0.015 min−1, 0.012 min−1 and 0.010 min−1 for C101, TT204, TT205 respectively), despite the absence of any co-adsorbent that can compete for space on the TiO2 film. It is noted, however, that TT204 films generally show lower optical densities than TT205 and C101 films. As all three dyes have similar molar extinction co-efficients (see Supporting Information† and Fig. 2 of Gao et al.)9 this indicates that there are lower dye concentrations on TT204 films. This is especially marked in the case where no chenodeoxycholic acid is present in the sensitizing solution (Fig. 4(b)). This suggests different dye packing on the TiO2. The significance of this is discussed hereafter when comparing Voc for optimized DSC devices.
Laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) was used to measure the photo-induced electron transfer processes occurring at the dye sensitized TiO2 electrode in the presence and absence of redox electrolyte. As can be seen in Fig. 5 the transient decays in the absence of electrolyte show multi-exponential behaviour for all samples as has been observed previously for studies involving similar Ru(II) polypyridine complexes.22,27,28 Moreover, the presence of the bulky groups in the structures of TT204 and TT205 does not appear to have any significant influence over recombination kinetics if we compare the t50% values (∼3.3 and 2.0 ms for TT204 and TT205 respectively) to that of C101 (∼2.4 ms). In the presence of electrolyte the loss of the cation signal due to regeneration of the dye cations by iodide/tri-iodide redox couple appears to be very similar for all samples, indicating that the regeneration efficiency is similar in all cases. This is explained by the HOMO energies (Table 1) obtained for these complexes indicating similar driving force energy for the regeneration reaction in all cases.
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption kinetics of 4 μm TiO2 films sensitized with (a) C101, (b) TT204 and (c) TT205 measured in the presence (red) and absence (black) of electrolyte. Kinetics were recorded at 780nm following excitation at 580nm. 

TT204 and TT205 devices show excellent photocurrents even without the use of co-adsorbents. Table 2 lists the most important parameters for all devices measured in this work. For the 6 + 5 μm devices, only a negligible increase in photocurrent is observed when chenodeoxycholic acid is used indicating that the bulky groups on TT204 and TT205 function just as well as the co-adsorbent in their role of achieving high photocurrents. Both dyes on thicker 12 + 5 μm films sensitized in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid generated high Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2 (TT204) and 18.7 mA cm−2 (TT205) as shown in Fig. 6, which is higher than the published value of 17.9 mA cm−2 for the C101 dye.9 The IPCE recorded for TT204 and TT205 devices (see Fig. 7) concur with the photocurrents listed in Table 2. For the thicker film cells made using chenodeoxycholic acid, Jsc varies negligibly, however, Voc varies to a much greater extent (0.78 V, 0.68 V and 0.72 V for C101, TT204 and TT205 respectively). Particularly striking is the observation of the almost 100 mV difference between C101 and TT204 devices. Previous studies by Durrant and co-workers15,29 investigating the effect of alkyl chain length in ruthenium complexes on cell performance in both liquid and solid-state DSCs showed increasing Voc and efficiency as chain length became longer. This is due to more effective blocking of recombination between the photo-injected electrons in the titanium and the oxidized electrolyte. However, the introduction of increasingly bulky groups into dye structure in this study clearly does not result in the same outcome.

Charge extraction and transient photovoltage studies were carried out in order to investigate electron densities and electron lifetimes in optimized devices composed of 12 + 5 μm thick TiO2 films under operating conditions. Fig. 8(a) illustrates charge density as a function of voltage for the different devices. It is clear that there is very little difference in electron densities between the films indicating that the position of the conduction band edge is similar in all devices. Therefore shifts in the Fermi level cannot explain the differences in voltage observed in these devices. However, electron lifetimes measured at identical electron densities using transient photovoltage measurements (Fig. 8(b)) show a general trend that correlates rather well with the Voc values obtained for these devices, i.e. as electron lifetime gets shorter, Voc decreases.
 Fig. 8  (a) TiO2 electron density versus light bias deduced from charge extraction studies and (b) electron lifetime (τ) versus electron density deduced from transient photovoltage studies for C101, TT204 and TT205 devices made with TiO2 films sensitized in the presence and absence of 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid. 
Though cell voltages (Voc) and electron lifetimes (τ) correlate well for the data presented, it is rather surprising that the bulkier the groups on the sensitizer, the lower the Voc and the shorter τ. Indeed, this is perhaps the opposite of what one might intuitively expect. This observation is particularly pronounced for the 12 + 5 μm cells where the Voc of the TT204 device is nearly 100 mV smaller than that of the C101 device. We attribute this to disordered dye packing on the TiO2 surface when the bulky groups become too big. Moreover, for the thinner 6 + 5 μm cells, devices prepared in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid show poorer Voc in comparison to devices prepared in the presence of this co-adsorbent. This suggests that dye packing on the TiO2 is particularly inefficient in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid and is somewhat confirmed in Fig. 4(b) where the TT204 film shows much lower optical density than either C101 or TT205. This may result in bare areas of TiO2 being exposed to the electrolyte, increasing recombination and lowering cell voltage. This indicates that in addition to its function in DSCs of avoiding aggregation and optimizing photocurrent, chenodeoxycholic acid fulfils a secondary function of facilitating ordered dye packing and optimizing cell voltage.
4. Conclusion
Two novel ruthenium complexes, TT204 and TT205, were synthesized and their properties in solution and in DSC devices investigated and compared against those of C101. These dyes showed outstanding photocurrents even in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid, indicating that the bulky groups can be used as a substitute for co-adsorbents to stop aggregation and achieve high photocurrents. Despite this, C101 devices show higher efficiencies, larger cell voltages and longer electron lifetimes under operating conditions. It is postulated that this is because of inefficient dye packing of TT204 and TT205 on the TiO2 surface caused by the bulky groups present on the ancillary ligands of these dyes. Moreover, devices prepared from films sensitized in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid display both higher efficiencies and cell voltages when compared to devices prepared without this co-adsorbent. This indicates that chenodeoxycholic acid helps form more ordered dye packing on the TiO2 film. Therefore, though bulky groups may be used as an effective strategy to prevent aggregation and improve photocurrent, avoiding the need for the use of co-adsorbants such as chenodeoxycholic acid, such bulky groups may not be conducive to achieving effective dye packing and higher voltages.
