    , Accepted 3rd April 2021First published on 5th April 2021AbstractConjugated polymers with a high absorption coefficient and high charge mobility are essential for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and large area roll-to-roll processing of polymer solar cells. However, only a few conjugated polymers with both properties have been reported so far. Recently, we have reported an innovative naphthyridinedione (NTD)-based highly crystalline polymer (PNTDT-2F2T) with an exceptionally high absorption coefficient (α = 1.6 × 105 cm−1) and charge mobility (μh = 8.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which showed 9.6% PCE with a thick active layer (210 nm). However, the PCE decreases considerably to 7.4% with a thin active layer (80 nm) due to a reduction in the photocurrent owing to the still smaller absorption coefficient and rather larger crystalline domain size of PNTDT-2F2T. To develop a thickness-tolerant high efficiency polymer solar cell aiming at low-cost commercial manufacture, we report a newly designed NTD-based conjugated polymer (PNTD4T-2FB) with an increased absorption coefficient and controlled crystallinity that contains 1,4-difluorobenzene units, in this work. The smaller crystal size (crystalline coherence length (CCL) = 2.20 nm) and higher absorption coefficient (α = 2.0 × 105 cm−1) of PNTD4T-2FB compared to those of PNTDT-2F2T (CCL = 3.19 nm) facilitate charge generation while maintaining a high carrier mobility (μh = 2.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Consequently, the PNTD4T-2FB based device shows improved PCE (10.1%) with a thicker active layer (330 nm) while keeping a PCE of 9.2% for an active layer of only 70 nm thickness as well. Comparative analysis with PNTD4T-B (which does not contain fluorine) suggests that the superior characteristics of PNTD4T-2FB are attributable to the slightly twisted but rigid backbone arising from the S–F intra-molecular non-bonding interaction between 1,2-difluorobenzene and thiophene.
Introduction
Donor–acceptor (D–A) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are the most suitable organic solar cells for commercialization due to their high performance induced by nanometer-scale D–A phase separation that can compensate the weaknesses of organic semiconductors, such as short exciton diffusion length and low charge mobility.1 Importantly, however, efficient charge generation and extraction must be combined with reasonable thickness-tolerance of the active layer for low-cost production of high-performance PSCs. In principle, efficient charge generation can be achieved by enough amount of light absorption and small enough domain size for excitons to diffuse to the D–A interface,2,3 which govern exciton generation and dissociation, respectively. On the other hand, efficient charge extraction, which competes with bimolecular recombination, can be achieved by a high charge carrier mobility and an appropriate BHJ morphology (such as the formation of interconnected D–A domains with high domain purity).3a,b,4,5 Particularly, efficient charge extraction enables the achievement of high efficiency even with thick active layers (>300 nm), which is a crucial prerequisite for large area roll-to-roll processing.6
Recently, non-fullerene acceptor-based solar cells have rapidly improved and achieved high PCEs;31 however, it should be noted that fullerene acceptors show isotropic charge transport and have higher electron mobility than most NFAs. Such properties are advantageous for efficient charge extraction in a very thick active layer.32 In this regard, fullerene acceptors are suitable for thick-film solar cells and are also promising materials as additional acceptors, to compensate for the insufficient charge mobility of NFAs for ternary systems.33,34 In addition, fullerene acceptors are more appropriate to compare the performances of new donor polymers with less peculiarity of structural preference in phase segregation behavior, while the performance of the NFA solar cell is peculiarly varied by the selection of donor polymers.36
Although numerous donor polymers for fullerene-based BHJ PSCs have been reported so far, there have been only 16 polymers exhibiting high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%, to the best of our knowledge (Table S3†).7 Interestingly, these high PCE polymers could be classified into two groups featuring high carrier mobility with low absorbance (Group 1) and high absorbance with low carrier mobility (Group 2). The 7 polymers in Group 1 have absorption coefficients in the order of 104 cm−1 similar to ordinary conjugated polymers, which demand a very thick active layer (≥300 nm)7a–h in spite of their high carrier mobility. Indeed, the light absorbance was insufficient to obtain high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and PCE at the typical active layer thickness (ALT) (∼100 nm).8 However, their high hole carrier mobilities (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), originating from high crystallinity, enable the use of an unusually thick active layer (∼300 nm), which results in a high EQE (>80%) and high PCE (>10%). For example, PffBT4T, a representative donor polymer for thick PSCs, shows optimized PCEs of 10.1% for a 280 nm thick film but only of 6.3% for an 80 nm thin film, respectively (Table S1†). On the other hand, Group 2 polymers with high absorbance and low charge mobility (<10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) should achieve a high EQE (∼80%) and PCE (∼10%) only in thin active layers (∼100 nm).7i–k This can be explained by their more than enough exciton generation followed by an efficient charge dissociation process in the thin film enabled by their smaller crystalline domain size to fit their lower charge mobility. Indeed, the crystalline coherence length (CCL) of PTB7, the representative donor polymer of Group 2 polymers, shows a CCL of 2 nm,11 whilst the Group 1 polymer PffBT4T shows a crystalline CCL of 8.5 nm.7a Therefore, insufficient charge mobility in Group 2 polymer causes a drastic drop in the fill factor (FF) and PCE for the thick active layer because of the decrease in the charge extraction efficiency; e.g. PTB7 exhibits PCEs of 10% (ref. 7i) and 1.14% (ref. 9) for 100 nm and 340 nm thick active layers, respectively.14 Such large variation of PCE as a function of polymer film thickness both in Group 1 and Group 2 polymers is problematic and disadvantageous in large-area fabrication of PSCs that usually leads to significant film thickness fluctuation.6 Therefore, we decided to design a novel high PCE polymer (>10%) with unique thickness-tolerance showing high PCE over the range from 70 nm thin to 330 nm thick films.
In principle, a donor polymer with all aspects of high absorption coefficient, high charge mobility, and small domain size is expected to be suitable for fabricating a thickness-tolerant highly efficient PSC, which is practically very intriguing as no example has ever been shown out of the Group 1 and Group 2 high PCE polymers. One reason for this is a trade-off between polymer design rules for high charge mobility (which requires high crystallinity) and small-sized crystalline domains (which require low crystallinity).10 For another reason, high absorption coefficients in conjugated molecules are very rare; only a few ones, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and indacenodithiophene (IDT), have been reported as building blocks of polymers providing a high absorption coefficient (α ≥ 1.5 × 105 cm−1).12,13 Recently, we could develop a totally new class of bis-lactam building blocks of naphthyridinedione (NTD) and successfully synthesized a NTD-based conjugated polymer with an exceptionally high absorption coefficient (α > 105 cm−1) and high charge carrier mobility (μh > 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).15 So far, only four different structures of NTD-based polymers, which contain benzodithiophene15a and thiophene15b units, have been developed. Among them, PNTDT-2F2T shows the highest PCE of 9.6% for a thick active layer of 210 nm owing to its high charge carrier mobility (μh = 8.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) originating from its structural rigidity and high crystallinity. From the standpoint of thickness tolerance, however, the PCE value still decreases to 7.4% for a thin active layer of 80 nm, but the decrease is less pronounced compared to other high-performance crystalline donor polymers owing to its high absorption coefficient (α = 1.6 × 105 cm−1). We could thus infer that reducing the domain size of PNTDT-2F2T (CCL = 3.19 nm) by small structural tuning could be the viable solution for achieving improved thickness tolerance while keeping the high PCE.
To this end, we designed new NTD-based donor polymers (PNTD4T-B and PNTD4T-2FB) containing two different types of benzene moieties (benzene and 1,4-difluorobenzene, respectively) that induced a somewhat twisted backbone structure replacing the planar 2F2T group in PNTDT-2F2T. Different from the common expectation that a twisted conjugated backbone would decrease the crystallinity, charge mobility, and absorption coefficient,16 PNTD4T-2FB was found to have an exceptionally high absorption coefficient (α = 2.0 × 105 cm−1) and high charge mobility (μh = 2.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) despite its reduced crystallinity and smaller crystal size (CCL = 2.20 nm). Consequently, PNTD4T-2FB yielded a higher PCE (10.1%) for a thicker active layer (330 nm) compared to PNTDT-2F2T. Furthermore, a PCE of 9.2% was demonstrated even with a very thin active layer of 70 nm. To understand these highly efficient and thickness-tolerant characteristics, we investigated the photophysical, morphological, electronic, and photovoltaic properties of these polymers in this study and have discussed the structure–property relationship.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic procedure of PNTD4T-2FB and PNTD4T-B. Both polymers were synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction between 3,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-1,5-dioctyl-1,5-dihydro-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTD2T) as an electron-deficient unit and 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzene (2T-2FB) or ((2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(trimethylstannane) (2T-B) as an electron-rich unit, respectively. The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer were evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard at 90 °C. The Mn and PDI of PNTD4T-2FB are 124 kDa and 4.9, respectively. Unfortunately, PNTD4T-B could not be measured because of its low solubility in chloroform, which however was soluble in dichlorobenzene to make a solar cell device. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). PNTD4T-2FB and PNTD4T-B exhibit exceptionally high and almost identical thermal decomposition temperatures of 445.2 °C and 439.2 °C (5% weight loss), respectively, and no thermal transitions until 300 °C (Fig. S1†); such high thermal stabilities are advantageous for various process temperature ranges and long-term operation by suppressing changes in the BHJ morphology.26

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory were performed to analyze the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and optimized geometry of PNTD4T-2FB and the bond dihedral angle of the 2T-2FB group was reduced (θ3 = 9.0°) owing to the F–S non-bonding interaction (Fig. 1 and S3†).17 This difference in backbone coplanarity can affect the molecular packing structure.10a–e,18 Meanwhile, to compare the theoretical absorption strength of the polymers, oscillator strengths of the S0 → S1 transition (f) were calculated via time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory (Table 1). In addition, to compare f values between the polymers with different repeating dimer lengths, we obtained a normalized f by dividing f by the number of π-electrons (Nπ), because f tends to increase with Nπ for small Nπ (Nπ < 100).12 As a result, PNTD4T-2FB exhibits a higher f/Nπ value than those of PNTD4T-B and even PNTDT-2F2T, implying that the absorption coefficient of PNTD4T-2FB is superior to others.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in a thin film are shown in Fig. 2 Interestingly, unlike typical benzene-containing polymers,16 these polymers show structured vibration peaks (0–0 and 0–1) irrespective of the twist angles. It is noted that the height ratio of 0–0 to 0–1 vibration peaks in PNTD4T-2FB is apparently higher than that in PNTD4T-B due to the higher coplanarity in the former. On the other hand, the structural vibration peaks of PNTD4T-B were destroyed in the blend film with PC71BM, while the peaks of PNTD4T-2FB were preserved (Fig. S2†). This implies that the intermolecular ordered packing structures of PNTD4T-2FB were not destroyed in the blend film, which is favorable for the formation of a pure donor domain, resulting in a lower charge recombination. The optical Eg was evaluated from the absorption edge in the spectrum of the film. Eg values of PNTD4T-2FB and PNTD4T-B were determined to be 1.70 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively, which are larger than 1.53 eV of PNTDT-2F2T. This is presumably due to the fact that the benzene ring disrupts delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the backbone, resulting in shallower LUMO energy levels compared to PNTDT-2F2T (Fig. 1b). The Eg of PNTD4T-B is 0.12 eV larger than that of PNTD4T-2FB (Eg = 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively) (Table 1). This difference in Eg could be attributed to the difference in the effective conjugation length arising from the different backbone coplanarity (Fig. 1).18b,19 In addition, this different backbone coplanarity also affected the absorption coefficients.35 PNTD4T-2FB has a higher absorption coefficient compared with PNTD4T-B due to its higher coplanarity, which is in agreement with the calculated oscillator strength (Table 1). But, it should be noted that the absorption coefficient of PNTD4T-2FB is 2 × 105 cm−1, which is an exceptionally high value, considering that absorption coefficients of most other donor polymers are in the order of 104 with only limited exceptions.14,15,20 Even the absorption coefficient of PNTD4T-2FB is higher than that of PNTDT-2F2T (1.6 × 105 cm−1)15b despite the lower backbone coplanarity compared to that of PNTDT-2F2T, which is consistent with the calculated oscillator strength. PNTD4T-2FB has a lower coplanarity but a tighter S–F non-bonding interaction compared with PNTDT-2T2F (Fig. S3†). Such high absorption strength of PNTD4T-2FB is advantageous for increasing photocurrents, especially in thin films that may cause insufficient light absorption. In addition, the rigid backbone structure with highly photoluminescent NTD units (photoluminescence quantum yield = 99%, see Fig. S8†) is a suitable design for a highly photoluminescent polymer, which can contribute to reducing a non-radiative energy loss in PSCs.27 Meanwhile, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the polymers were determined by the onset oxidation potential of the cyclic voltammetry result. LUMO levels were estimated by subtracting the optical Eg from the HOMO level. PNTD4T-2FB and PNTD4T-B showed HOMO levels at −5.19 eV and −5.33 eV, and LUMO levels at −3.49 eV and −3.51 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1. Interestingly, the difference in HOMO energies is larger than that in LUMO energies. This is probably because the HOMO distributed in the entire backbone is more affected by the different twist angle, by modulating the effective conjugate length. On the other hand, the LUMO level is barely affected because it is localized in the NTD unit (Fig. 1).

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated according to the architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Al.28,29 Details of the device fabrication methods are described in the ESI.† The J–V characteristics of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3a, and corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the device are summarized in Table 2. In addition, the photovoltaic parameters of the devices depending on various active layer thicknesses (ALT) are summarized in Table S4.† The optimal device with PNTD4T-B shows a moderate PCE of 6.5% with the 100 nm thick active layer. On the other hand, the PNTD4T-2FB device exhibits a high PCE of 10.1% with the 330 nm thick active layer, which is higher and thicker than that of PNTDT-2F2T. Such a high PCE for the PNTD4T-2FB device is mainly attributed to the larger light absorption strength of the active layer attributed to the high absorption coefficient of the polymer and thick active layer. As shown in Fig. 3b, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PNDT4T-2FB device are over 70% in the entire absorption range, and particularly, in the short wavelength region from 400 nm to 550 nm, the EQE is over 80% with a maximum value of 84.3%. The PNTD4T-2FB device also exhibits very high internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) above 90% in the entire absorption range and nearly 100% in the wavelength region from 350 to 550 nm. Such high EQE and IQE allow the PNTD4T-2FB device to achieve a high JSC of 18.3 mA cm−2, which is similar value to that of PNTDT-2F2T (JSC = 18.8 mA cm−2), even though the Eg (1.7 eV) is larger than that of PNTDT-2F2T (Eg = 1.53 eV). In contrast, the PNTD4T-B device shows a lower EQE and IQE in the entire absorption region except for the short wavelength region (PC71BM absorption region) where the maximum EQE and IQE are 65% and 90%, respectively. Such unexpectedly high quantum yields in the short wavelength region are presumably due to the fact that the excess photon energy beyond the Eg is efficiently exploited to achieve a high charge generation efficiency.21 Moreover, the high FF with the thick active layer also allows the PNTD4T-2FB device to achieve a high PCE. Indeed, the PNTD4T-2FB device preserves a high FF of 0.70 even at a thickness of 330 nm, while in the PNTDT-2F2T device a FF dropped sharply from 0.70 to 0.62 as the ALT was further increased from 210 to 240 nm even with its high charge carrier mobility (μh = 8.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).15b In the case of PNTD4T-B devices, the drop in FF is more severe; the FF significantly dropped from 0.71 to 0.45 as the ALT was further increased from 100 to 300 nm (Table S5†). This means that the charge extraction process in the PNTD4T-2FB device is more efficient than those in PNTDT-2F2T and PNTD4T-B, of which reason will be discussed shortly. In contrast, an approximately 20 mV decrease in VOC was observed when the ALT of the PNTD4T-2FB device was increased from 70 to 330 nm by more non-geminate recombination in the thick film; this is consistent with the results of previously reported thick active layer studies.7e,14e,30

Interestingly, in the PNTD4T-2FB device, a high PCE of 9.2% was achieved even with a very thin active layer of 70 nm (Fig. 3a). In other words, it maintained 91% of the maximum PCE with a thin ALT of only 21% of the optimal thickness. This is an extraordinary characteristic compared to other high-performance PSCs. For example, as mentioned above, the PCE of PffBT4T, the most successful donor polymer for thick PSCs (Group 1), decreased to 62% (6.3%) of the maximum PCE (10.15%) at a thickness of 28% (80 nm) of the optimum thickness (280 nm) (Table S1†). For PNTDT-2F2T, one of the donor polymers with the highest absorption coefficient, the PCE was reduced to 82% (7.89%) of maximum efficiency (9.63%) at a thickness of 38% (80 nm) of the optimum thickness (210 nm).15b This outstanding PCE tolerance of the PNTD4T-2FB device indicates that the device has remarkably efficient charge generation due to the high absorption strength of the polymer. At 550 nm to 700 nm (the polymer absorption region), the EQEs for the 70 nm active layer are not significantly different from those for the 330 nm active layer (Fig. 3c). In contrast, EQEs below 550 nm (PC71BM absorption region) are much smaller than those for the 330 nm active layer. This means that the high absorption strength of PNTD4T-2FB prevents current loss resulting from film thinning, and it becomes increasingly prominent for thin active layers. Such high PCEs that occur regardless of the BHJ film thickness are advantageous for feasible commercial production on a large scale.6
Morphology investigation
To investigate the intermolecular packing and orientation of pristine polymers and optimized BHJ films, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed. 2D-GIWAXS images and their line cuts of pristine polymer films and BHJ films are shown in Fig. 4 The packing parameters based on GIWAXS measurements are summarized in Table S2.† The PNTD4T-B film exhibits only a strong (100) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction without a distinct (010) diffraction peak, meaning amorphous properties. In contrast, the PNTD4T-2FB film exhibits a strong (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction with a small π–π stacking distance (3.767 Å at qz = 1.668 Å−1), indicating face-on-oriented tight π–π stacking (Table S2†). Importantly, most crystalline polymers for high-performance thick PSCs, including PNTDT-2F2T, exhibit multiple diffraction peaks (h00),7a–h describing a high degree of lamella stacking. On the other hand, the PNTD4T-2FB film exhibits only a (100) diffraction peak (23 Å at qz = 0.27 Å−1) in the out-of-plane and in-plane direction (Table S2†). These results illustrate that PNTD4T-2FB forms a pair of lamellar stacking, not long range lamellar stacking, which facilitates PNTD4T-2FB to form small crystals. The crystalline coherence length (CCL) of the PNDT4T-2FB film was calculated using the Scherrer equation22 to be 2.20 nm, which corresponds to 6.8 π-stacked polymers (Table S2†). This is similar to the morphology of the PTB7:PC71BM based BHJ PSC, a typical high-performance thin PSC, with a CCL of ∼2 nm and a π–π stacking distance of ∼3.7 Å, corresponding to 6.4 π-stacked polymers.11 The PNTD4T-2FB:PC71BM blend film had a CCL of ∼2.73 nm and π–π stacking distance of ∼3.68 Å, which corresponds to 8.4 π-stacked polymers (Table S2 and Fig. S4†). This π–π stacked structure is smaller compared to crystalline polymers for high-performance thick PSCs, for example, PffBT4T with 24 π-stacked structures (CCL = 8.5 nm)7a and PNTDT-2F2T with 9.8 π-stacked structures (CCL = 3.19 nm).15b Based on these results, we suggest that the large twist angle (θ3 = 26.4°) of the benzene–thiophene bond in PNTD4T-B interferes with efficient π–π stacking of the conjugated backbone, but the relatively smaller twist angle (θ3 = 9.0°) of the 1,4-difluorobenzene–thiophene bond in PNTD4T-2FB plays an important role in preventing the formation of the long range lamellar stacking structure and reducing the size of the π-stacked structure. In addition to the high absorption coefficient, this reduced crystal size facilitates charge generation, enabling high PCE even in thin films. Furthermore, this reduced crystallinity is favorable for the formation of a uniform and pin-hole free thin film, which is an important requirement for a high speed roll-to-roll printing technique.6

To further analyze the surface and internal morphologies of the two optimized BHJ films, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. While the AFM topological image of the PNTD4T-B:PC71BM BHJ film showed an unstructured surface, that of PNTD4T-2FB:PC71BM showed a dense and tangled nano-fibrillar structure with a low surface root-mean-square roughness of 1.83 nm (Fig. 5a and b). While the TEM image of PNTD4T-B shows very thin nano-fibrils distributed sparsely, that of PNTD4T-2FB shows dense and interconnected nano-fibrils with a 10–20 nm diameter, which is close to the exciton diffusion length of conventional conjugated polymers (Fig. 5c and d).23 Furthermore, this diameter is consistent with the distance of the pair of lamellar stacking structures calculated from the GIWAXS measurement (Table S2†). Therefore, we can explain that the dense and interconnected nano-fibrils with a small and uniform diameter distribution in PNTD4T-2FB:PC71BM can provide a high charge mobility despite its relatively low crystallinity and smaller crystal size.

The charge carrier recombination characteristics of the optimized blend films were examined by measuring the light intensity dependency of JSC and VOC. The curve was fitted using the power law of the light intensity, where slope (s) in a log–log plot of JSCversus the light intensity indicates the dependence of JSC on bimolecular recombination.24 As shown in Fig. S5,† slope s was fitted with a value of 0.94 and 0.96 for PNTD4T-B and PNTD4T-2FB BHJ PSCs, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular recombination was similar in both devices but was slightly more suppressed in the PNTD4T-2FB device. Furthermore, for the 70 nm-thick PNTD4T-2FB BHJ PSC, the slope was closer to unity, with a value of 0.98. Next, the semilogarithmic plot of VOCversus the light intensity was fitted with the relationship: VOC ∝ nkT/qln(I), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the electron charge, and I is the light intensity.24c,25 The n value reflects the presence of carrier traps in the active layer.25 As presented in Fig. S5,† the slopes for the PNTD4T-B and PNTD4T-2FB devices are 1.163kT/q and 1.042kT/q, respectively. For 70 nm-thick PNTD4T-2FB devices, the n value was further reduced to 1.005. The relatively smaller n value of the PNTD4T-2FB device indicates that trap-assisted recombination occurred less in the PNTD4T-2FB device. These recombination results demonstrate that the charge extraction process in the PNTD4T-2FB device is very efficient despite the much thicker active layer.
The vertical charge mobilities of the pristine polymers and the optimized blend films were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6†). The vertical hole mobilities (μh) of PNTD4T-B and PNTD4T-2FB were measured to be 5.11 × 10−5 and 6.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This trend is also shown in the blend films. The vertical μh and electron mobilities (μe) of PNTD4T-2FB:PC71BM were measured to be 2.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.09 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are similar to those of PNTDT-2F2T (μh = 8.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 2.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). These high and balanced charge mobilities of PNTD4T-2FB:PC71BM were also shown for a thinner film (190 nm) (μh = 1.81 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 2.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). These values are one order higher than those of the PNTD4T-B:PC71BM blend film (μh = 4.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 8.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These high and balanced charge mobilities of PNTD4T-2FB are attributed to the tight π–π stacking and interconnected nano-fibril structure as observed from the GIWAXS and TEM measurements.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a newly designed NTD-based polymer (PNTD4T-2FB) with optimized crystallinity by introducing 1,4-difluorobenzene into its structure. Notably, PNTD4T-2FB shows a higher absorption coefficient (α = 2.0 × 105 cm−1) and a smaller crystal size (CCL = 2.20 nm) compared to those of the previously reported high-performance NTD-based polymer, PNTDT-2F2T (α = 1.6 × 105 cm−1, CCL = 3.19 nm) while maintaining a high carrier mobility (μh = 2.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which facilitate both charge generation and extraction. A comparative study with PNTD4T-B (which does not contain fluorine) suggested that the superior characteristics of PNTD4T-2FB could be attributed to its molecular structure, which is exquisitely controlled by the introduction of 1,4-difluorobenzene. 1,4-Difluorobenzene induced an appropriately small backbone dihedral angle, and provided rigidity to the backbone because of the tight non-bonding S–F interactions between benzene and thiophene. As a result, PNTD4T-2FB outperformed the previously reported PNTDT-2F2T. PNTD4T-2FB-based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 10.1% with an active layer of 330 nm thickness. Interestingly, a PCE of 9.2%, which is 91% of the max PCE, was obtained even with a 70 nm thick active layer, which is 21% of the optimum thickness, unlike other high-performance crystalline donor polymers. Considering the trade-off between molecular designs for small domain size and high charge mobility,10 it is noteworthy that our structural design offers a new route to accomplish both, allowing the fabrication of high-performance thick and thin-film PSCs that could not be obtained from the previously reported crystalline donor polymers.
