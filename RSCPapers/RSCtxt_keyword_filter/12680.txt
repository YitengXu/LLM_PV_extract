    , Accepted 1st June 2016First published on 2nd June 2016AbstractFive wide bandgap conjugated polymers based on diindenocarbazole (DIC) and dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) alternating units have been designed and prepared to investigate the effects of side chains on the photovoltaic performance of the polymers. All the polymers are soluble in common organic solvents and they show similar optical bandgaps of around 2.0 eV as well as deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (below −5.48 eV). Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) using phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor material were fabricated. The side chains on the polymer backbone have a strong impact on the film morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blends. A phase separation with a relatively larger domain size was found for the polymers with longer side chains, while those with relatively shorter alkyl chains could form uniform films featuring a phase separation with a smaller domain size. Finally, PSCs based on PC1BT6:PC71BM exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 7.34% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V. Our results demonstrate that the judicious design of side-chains is effective in improving the photovoltaic performance of DIC-based polymers. With a larger bandgap than P3HT but an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a large Voc, this type of DIC-based polymer should be a promising bottom layer material for tandem solar cells.
Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on p-type conjugated polymers and n-type semiconductors have attracted increasing attention due to their features of being lightweight, flexible, low-cost and having the capability to be fabricated by roll-to-roll printing.1–3 Significant advances in PSCs have been made, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% for single-junction devices have been realized with the development of novel donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers, optimization of device architectures, and interface engineering.4–8 These achievements promise a bright future for PSCs. Many studies have focused on low-bandgap copolymers in order to increase the PCEs of the resulting PSCs by harvesting solar light with an extended spectrum. It is a challenge to increase the PCEs by enhancing the circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) simultaneously. Another effective strategy is the use of a multi-junction device with a tandem structure fabricated by stacking two or more subcells with active layers exhibiting complementary absorption.9 Although there have been quite a few high performance low bandgap copolymers developed in the past decade, the number of high performance wide bandgap copolymers has been limited, especially for copolymers with bandgaps over 2.0 eV. At the same time, compared to the tremendous effort that has been made to design new building blocks in polymer backbones, much less attention has been paid to the study of the side chain effect of polymers on the resulting PSCs.
Side chains are of vital importance in designing polymer semiconductors for modifications of their solubility, crystallinity, morphology, light absorption, intermolecular stacking, and energy levels.10–15 It is well known that unsubstituted conjugated polymers are usually difficult to dissolve in most organic solvents due to their high rigidity and strong inter-chain π–π interactions. When bulky alkyl chains are employed in the polymer backbone, the inter-chain interaction can be weakened and the solubility of the polymer can be improved effectively. However, long side chains may decrease π–π stacking due to steric hindrance, which is not favorable for performance improvement of the materials.16 There have been some successful strategies of side chain engineering reported so far. Taking a benzodithiophene-based copolymer as an example, the introduction of linear alkylthio side chains led to a higher hole mobility and an improved PCE of 9.48%.17 For diketopyrrolopyrrole-based copolymers, when side chains were changed from decyltetradecyl to hexyldecyl, the PCE of the resulting PSCs increased from 3.2% to 7.4% due to the improvement of the active layer morphology for the copolymers based on shorter side chains.18
As a weak electron donor unit, diindenocarbazole (DIC) features a coplanar and extended ladder-type framework, which can elongate effective π-conjugation length and facilitate charge carrier mobility.19 We previously reported that the incorporation of DIC into the polymer backbone could lead to large bandgap copolymers with deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and could make the resulting copolymers promising short-wavelength absorbing materials for tandem solar cells with Voc.19 However, systematic correlations between the alkyl side chains and photovoltaic properties of this type of copolymer have not been disclosed despite the fact that copolymers with even better photovoltaic performance can be expected. Thus, in this work, we varied the alkyl chains on the polymer backbone of DIC-based copolymers in order to improve their photovoltaic properties and to study the side chain effect on DIC-based copolymers. As shown in Scheme 1, we designed and synthesized a series of DIC-based copolymers with different alkyl chains and different anchoring positions on the donor and acceptor units. The photophysical, hole transporting, and photovoltaic properties of the target copolymers were studied in depth. The best PSC based on PC1BT6 and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibited a high PCE of 7.34% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 14.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.2%, which is the highest value obtained for any DIC-based copolymer to the best of our knowledge.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the target polymers are depicted in Scheme 1, and the synthetic details are provided in the Experimental section. The polymers were synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction with Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst. All polymers were purified by precipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform in succession. The synthesized polymers are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results show that the number-average molecular weights (Mns) of PC1BT6, PC2BT6, PC6BT6, PNC2C4BT6, and PC2BT are 42.0, 20.2, 27.8, 25.2, and 11.6 kDa with polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 3.2, 1.7, 1.7, 2.1, and 1.7, respectively (Table 1). The relatively low molecular weight observed for PC2BT is related to the great steric hindrance induced by the bulky hexyl chains both in the acceptor and the donor units, which would restrain close molecular collisions during chain propagation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen suggests that all polymers are fairly stable for PSCs with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 325, 334, 337, 339, and 433 °C for PC1BT6, PC2BT6, PC6BT6, PNC2C4BT6, and PC2BT, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all the copolymers (Fig. S3, ESI†) do not show clear diffraction peaks, demonstrating the amorphous characteristics of all the copolymers.

Optical and electrochemical properties
Absorption spectra of all the polymers in solution or thin films were measured to determine the influence of the alkyl substituent on their optical properties. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the three copolymers in chloroform solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 1, and the detailed absorption data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution consist of two main absorption bands in the ranges of ∼300–450 nm and ∼450–600 nm, respectively. The absorption band at ∼300–450 nm is ascribed to the π–π* transition of the heteroheptacene and the other band arises from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units. All polymers except PC2BT show nearly identical absorption shapes, indicating that the fine tuning of the length of the side chains has a negligible effect on the light absorption of the polymers. In solution, the absorption bands of PC2BT have a slightly blue shift compared to PC2BT6, which can be attributed to poor π–π packing of the heteroheptacene and weak ICT between donor and acceptor units. Alkyl chains anchored to the thiophene rings on the polymer backbone may cause a steric repulsion between the adjacent monomer units and decrease the planarity of the polymer backbone.20 The absorption peaks in the long wavelength region are around 513 nm for PC1BT6, PC2BT6, PC6BT6, PNC2C4BT6, and 509 nm for PC2BT. From solution to thin films, the corresponding absorption peaks red-shifted around 5–15 nm for the copolymers, suggesting a strong inter-chain π–π stacking in the solid state. The absorption edges (λedge) of the five polymers are 616 nm (PC1BT6), 619 nm (PC2BT6), 617 nm (PC6BT6), 621 nm (PC2BT), and 616 nm (PNC2C4BT6), respectively, from which the corresponding optical bandgaps (Eoptg) can be calculated as 2.01, 2.00, 2.01, 2.00, and 2.01 eV, according to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λedge. Obviously, all these polymers exhibit larger optical bandgaps than P3HT (Eoptg = 1.90 eV),21 suggesting their better potential as short-wavelength absorbing materials for tandem PSCs.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties and estimate the energy levels of the polymers. Cyclic voltammograms were performed in a three electrode cell using a platinum electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and a Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in acetonitrile. Under these conditions, the onset oxidation potential (Eox1/2) of ferrocene was −0.02 V versus Ag/Ag+. It is assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are determined from the onset oxidation potential (φox) and the onset reduction potential (φred), according to the following equations:EHOMO = −(φox + 4.82) (eV)ELUMO = −(φred + 4.82) (eV)CV curves are shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant data are outlined in Table 1. Similar to those of the 2,7-carbazole based analogues, the HOMO energy levels of the copolymers are relatively deep-lying, which is beneficial for achieving a high Voc in PSCs. For PC1BT6, PC2BT6, PC6BT6, and PNC2C4BT6, φoxs are located at ∼0.66–0.67 V, which correspond to HOMO energy levels in ∼−5.48 to 5.49 eV. These results imply that fine tuning of the alkyl chain in this family of polymers has little influence on the HOMO energy levels, which matches with the reported results in the literature.22 Meanwhile, it is found that side chains may exert an influence on HOMO energy levels through the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups or through the effect on molecular conformation.20,23,24 Thus, it is reasonable for a decrease in the HOMO energy level from PC2BT6 (−5.49 eV) to PC2BT (−5.54 eV) when changing the side chains from alkoxy to hydrogen atoms and anchoring the alkyl substituents on the thiophene units. On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels of the copolymers are in the range of −3.56 to 3.63 eV, which are sufficiently higher (>0.3 eV)25 than the LUMO level of PC71BM (−4.0 eV)26 to overcome the exciton binding energy.

Charge transport properties
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated with the bottom-gate and top-contact geometry to probe the charge transport properties of the polymers. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer with a surface layer of 300 nm SiO2 was employed as the substrate, which was treated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to form a self-assembled monolayer. Semiconductor polymers were spin-coated from their CB solutions (6 mg ml−1) at 2500 rpm for 60 s onto the dielectric surface, and top-contact source/drain Au electrodes of about 60 nm thickness were deposited through a shadow mask under a vacuum of ∼1.0 × 10−4 Pa. Transistor behavior was observed when applying a negative gate voltage (VGS), indicating that the polymer semiconductors have p-channel characteristics. The mobilities were calculated by plotting I1/2DS with respect to VGS (Fig. S2, ESI†) according to the equation in the saturation regime from the gate sweep:IDS = μCi (W/2L)(VGS − VTH)2where IDS is the drain current; μ is the carrier mobility; Ci is the gate dielectric capacitance (SiO2, 300 nm, Ci = 10 nF cm−2); W and L are the semiconductor channel width and length, respectively; and VGS and VTH are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
Hole mobilities of the pristine PC1BT6, PC2BT6, PC6BT6, PNC2C4BT6, and PC2BT films deduced from the saturation regime were calculated to be 5.8 × 10−4, 3.6 × 10−4, 6.5 × 10−4, 3.4 × 10−4, and 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is known that more bulky side chains may increase the steric hindrance for intermolecular packing, leading to a decrease in hole mobility.27 Thus, PC1BT6 exhibits a higher mobility than PC2BT6, which can be partially attributed to the shorter side chains on the nitrogen atom of the former polymer. However, in going from PC2BT6 to PC6BT6, an increased hole mobility was found, which may be due to the increased molecular weight of PC6BT6 despite its more bulky hexyl side chains. From comparison of PC2BT6 and PC2BT, it is found that the mobility of PC2BT6 is more than 18-fold larger than that of PC2BT, which can be attributed to the different π–π packing induced by the different anchoring positions of side chains. Obviously, the side chains have a strong influence on the mobility of DIC-based polymers, thereby affecting the performance of PSCs based on them. However, all the pristine polymer films have a uniform surface with similar average roughness values in the range of 0.43–0.50 nm as shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Photovoltaic performance and film morphology
PSCs with the device structure of indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (ITO/PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Poly[(2,5-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propoxy)-1,4-benzene)-alt-2,8-(6,6,12,12-tetraethylhexyl-6,12-dihydroindeno(1,2b)fluorene)] (PIFB)/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of these polymers. The blend films of the polymers and PC71BM were spin-coated from a mixed solvent of ortho-dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene (o-DCB:CB = 1:4, v/v) with 0.5% (v/v) 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are plotted in Fig. 3 and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. As expected, all copolymers display a high Voc in a range of 0.95–1.01 V. PSCs based on PC1BT6 exhibit the best performance with a high Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 14.00 mA cm−2, a FF of 55.2%, and an intriguing PCE of 7.34%, which is the highest value for any DIC-based copolymer reported so far. At the same time, the value is among the highest of ladder-type or large bandgap donor materials for PSCs.27–33 As shown in Table 2, the Jsc and FF values of the devices based on PC1BT6, PC2BT6, and PC6BT6 decrease with increasing the length of side chains on nitrogen atoms, resulting in reduced PCEs. It can be attributed to the solubility and Mn differences for these three polymers, which leads to active layers with different phase separation conditions.34,35 It should be pointed out that the device based on PC1BT6 exhibits a lower Voc than the device based on PC2BT6, PC6BT6, or PNC2C4BT6, although all four polymers have almost the same HOMO levels. This could be related to the surface morphology difference of the polymer blends, thereby affecting the energy barrier between the corresponding active layers and the electrodes.36 It is interesting that the photovoltaic parameters of PC2BT6 and PNC2C4BT6 are comparable, although they differ in the length of the side chain on the sp3 carbon atom of the DIC unit. These results suggest that the solubilizing group on the nitrogen atom of the DIC unit plays a critical role in the device performance of the resulting copolymers. Nevertheless, PC2BT-based devices afford a low Jsc of 10.48 mA cm−2 as well as a low FF of 0.38, which may be in part attributed to their low molecular weight and in part due to the less planar polymer backbone caused by the bulky hexyl groups anchored on the thiophene bridge. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) profiles of the PSCs based on the five polymers are displayed in Fig. 4, which show a photoresponse in the range from 300 to 700 nm, consistent with the large-bandgap nature of the copolymers. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G spectrum agree with those obtained from the J–V measurements.

High performance PSCs require nanoscale phase separation with the formation of an interpenetrating network, which enables a large interface area for exciton dissociation and, at the same time, a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes.37–39 To illuminate the relationship between the device performance and the morphology of the corresponding active layer, both tapping-mode AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. The AFM and TEM images of the polymer blends are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S5 (ESI†), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, all the blend films are uniform with average roughness values in the range of 0.22–0.54 nm. In the phase images of the polymer blends, the dark regions can be attributed to PC71BM, whereas the bright regions can be attributed to the polymers. Clear phase separation was observed for all the polymer blends despite the domain size difference of the fullerene and polymer phases. Polymers PC1BT6, PC2BT6, and PC6BT6 share the same molecular structure except for the alkyl chain difference on the nitrogen atom of the DIC unit. In going from methyl to ethyl and to hexyl, phase separation with increasing domain size is observed. Specifically speaking, the blend film of PC1BT6:PC71BM shows a phase separation with a moderate domain size of ∼20 nm, which is favorable for exciton dissociation and charge collection. Thus, a high Jsc and an excellent PCE of 7.34% are achieved for the device based on PC1BT6:PC71BM. However, the film of PC6BT6:PC71BM displays a phase separation with a relatively larger domain size of ∼50 nm. Phase separation with too large a domain size can diminish exciton migration to donor and acceptor interfaces for charge separation, leading to a lower Jsc value. The domain size differences explain the reason why the PCE of the PC1BT6:PC71BM-based PSC is higher than that of its PC6BT6:PC71BM-based counterpart. From the TEM images (ESI†) of the blended films based on PC1BT6, PC2BT6, and PC6BT6, one may also find clusters (PC71BM) with increasing sizes when the alkyl chain on the nitrogen atom of the DIC unit changes from methyl to ethyl and to a hexyl group. Compared with PC2BT6:PC71BM, the blended film of PNC2C4BT6:PC71BM with shorter side chains shows phase separation with a similar domain size of ∼25 nm, which agrees with their approximate Jsc and PCE values. As shown in Fig. 5j, the phase separation for the blended film of PC2BT is less pronounced in comparison with the other four copolymer blends, leading to a much lower PCE of 4.02% for the device based on PC2BT. This observation suggests that the side chains of the polymer backbone can affect the photovoltaic performance of DIC-based copolymers through influencing the morphology of the resultant polymer blends. For DIC-based polymers, when the size of the alkyl chain on the nitrogen atom of the DIC unit was minimized, the resulting copolymer exhibited the best photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
A series of D–A conjugated polymers with different side chains on their backbone were synthesized in order to study the effects of side chains on their photovoltaic properties. The fine tuning of the length of the side chains of the DIC-based copolymers has a negligible influence on their absorption bands and energy levels, but has a large effect on their hole mobilities and miscibility with PC71BM. The copolymers with a shorter length of side chains on their DIC units exhibit a relatively higher hole mobility and better miscibility with PC71BM, consequently leading to a better photovoltaic performance. As a result, PC1BT6 exhibits the best PSC performance with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 14.00 mA cm−2, and a PCE of 7.34%. The PCE value is the highest for all DIC-based polymers reported in the literature. With a larger bandgap than P3HT and an improved PCE combined with an enlarged Voc, this type of DIC-based polymer should be very promising for short-wavelength absorbing materials in tandem solar cells. Furthermore, this work provides a valuable guideline for the design and synthesis of novel polymer donor materials for highly efficient PSCs via side chain engineering.

All of the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Adamas, Alfa Aesar and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from benzophenone/sodium to remove the water, and other solvents were dried with molecular sieves. Compounds 1 and SnA1 were synthesized according to reports in the literature.19,40,41 The synthetic procedure of SnA2 is provided in the ESI.† PC71BM (99%) was purchased from American Dye Source Inc. The synthesis of PIFB has been described by us previously.42
Instruments and measurements

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference, and the peaks are given in ppm relative to TMS. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured using the GPC method with polystyrene standards. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer. TGA measurements were performed on a Netzsch STA449C platform. TEM was conducted on a Tecnai F20 Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope. AFM images were collected by a Veeco Multimode NS3A-02 Nanoscope III microscope.
Fabrication and characterization of the PSCs
Devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer PC71BM/PIFB/Al. ITO glass (15 Ω sq−1) was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 30 min each, then dried overnight in an oven, and subsequently subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 15 min prior to use. PEDOT:PSS was passed through a 0.45 μm filter before being deposited onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The film-loaded substrate was baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the active layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer/PC71BM (20 mg ml−1) in a mixed o-DCB:CB (1:4, v/v) solvent with 0.5% DIO additive was stirred overnight at 50 °C and filtered (0.45 μm filter) before being spin-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Before the aluminium deposition, a conjugated polyelectrolyte PIFB was introduced as an interlayer to facilitate efficient electron injection. The PIFB layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s from a methanol solution (0.3 mg ml−1, containing 5% eq. of acetic acid). Finally, a layer of the aluminium cathode was thermally deposited through a shadow mask under a high vacuum, approximately 1 × 10−5 Torr. Each sample consists of eight independent devices with a fixed active area of 6 mm2. Device characterization was performed under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell. The J–V curves were tested by a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. EQE spectra were measured on a Newport EQE measuring system.
Synthesis

Compound 2b19. 
A dry alumina-supported copper(II) bromide (CuBr2, 6 equiv.; 5.64 g Al2O3/CuBr2 = 2:1, w/w) was added to dry CCl4 (70 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere, then compound 1b (1 g, 1.4 mmol) was dissolved in the suspension solution.
