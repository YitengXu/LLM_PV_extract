    , Accepted 9th March 2016First published on 9th March 2016AbstractThis paper presents the novel use of spray-coating to fabricate organic solar cells on fabrics for wearable energy harvesting applications. The surface roughness of a standard woven 65/35 polyester cotton fabric used in this work is of the order of 150 μm and this is reduced to a few microns by a screen printed interface layer. This pre-treated fabric substrate with reduced surface roughness was used as the target substrate for the spray-coated fabric organic solar cells that contain multiple layers of electrodes and active materials. Fully spray-coated photovoltaic (PV) devices fabricated on fabric substrates have been successfully demonstrated with power conversion efficiency comparable to that of their glass based counterparts. All PV devices are characterised under simulated AM 1.5 conditions. Device morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This approach is potentially suitable for the low cost integration of PV devices into clothing and other decorative textiles.
Introduction
This paper concerns the development of organic solar cells on flexible fabric substrates. The fabric substrate places many constraints on the fabrication of the devices, which means that the existing processes and technologies cannot be simply applied directly onto the textile. The first generation solar cells based on silicon are the market leader in the PV industry.1 However, these first generation cells are rigid and costly, consume high levels of energy in production and are not compatible with textiles. The second generation of thin film based copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium tellurium (CdTe) solar cells is attracting more attention due to reduced material usage, low cost preparation techniques and broad solar coverage, compared to first generation devices. These solar cells have already reached 20% efficiency on rigid substrates.1,2 However, the fabrication of second generation solar cells still involves high temperature treatments and vacuum processes which are incompatible with textile substrates. In addition, there is a growing concern about toxicity and after life disposal, which is a barrier to commercialisation. Third generation solar cells are based on solution processed organic materials that are used to fabricate dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells and polymer based organic solar cells (OSCs).3–5 The low cost preparation techniques are making third generation solar cells more attractive in flexible solar cell applications with excellent potential for large area power generation. In particular, there is considerable ongoing research on OSCs towards improvement of device efficiency and fabrication processes.6–8 These processes and materials do have the potential for the realisation of solar cells on fabric substrates. In recent years, wearable technologies derived from e-textiles have been developed for various applications, for example, medical, sports and military clothing.9–12 The topic of energy harvesting is concerned with the conversion of ambient energy (e.g. kinetic, thermal or light) into electrical energy for use in powering autonomous systems. There is naturally considerable interest in using energy harvesting in wearable applications, which can extend the life, or potentially replace standard battery based power supplies. Fabric solar cells are one form of energy harvesting that has great potential for powering wearable devices. However, incorporating solar cells on fabric substrates is not straightforward. Fabrics are highly flexible substrates with different mechanical structures depending upon, for example, the weave and yarn parameters. The surface of a fabric is rough compared to a plastic substrate such as a polyimide film (Kapton, trade name of Dupont) and its use will limit the maximum temperature that can be used in device processing.
Existing examples of solar cells on fabrics use conventional rigid silicon or plastic solar cells, as standalone PV devices, which are attached (stitched or glued) onto the fabric as a functional patch.13 This approach makes the fabric relatively inflexible and alters the feel of the textile dramatically and the fabric itself has no added functionality. However, a new generation of flexible DSSCs and OSCs offers the potential for integrating the light harvesting capability into the fabric itself providing a low weight solution that maintains the feel of the fabric. Integrating DSSCs and OSCs on fabric substrates has many challenges, such as achieving suitable device flexibility and durability, acceptable conversion efficiency and fabrication using processes compatible with the textile industry.
Research on fabrication of flexible solar cells integrated into fabrics has explored several approaches, especially using organic polymer materials for DSSCs and OSCs. Recently, there have been many published results on yarn based textile DSSCs14–25 that have been woven into textiles. At the same time research studies show that the bending cycles will significantly disable or degrade the PV yarn’s performance.19,21,23 In the conventional DSSCs architecture, there are two fluorine tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates sandwiched together with the introduction of a liquid electrolyte in between them. Approaches to the fabric DSSCs have replaced one of the two FTO coated glass slides with conductive fabrics, for example, carbon nanotube coated fabrics,26 nickel coated woven polyester fabrics27 and graphene coated cotton fabrics.28 However, the fully sprayed DSSCs on fabrics for wearable applications have never been demonstrated, as they used the coated fabrics as a stick-on electrode to the FTO glass substrate, which are neither flexible nor wearable. Fabric OSCs were fabricated using a combination of evaporation and spin-coating by Bedeloglu et al.29–32 This work actually used a non-woven polypropylene textile tape as the substrate which is not representative of typical woven fabrics. These devices did work and achieved 0.2% efficiency, which is the highest value reported to date from a coated organic PV textile. Krebs et al.33 used a standard woven textile and smoothed the surface by laminating a polyethylene film for OSCs. This film has a low surface energy and requires a plasma treatment to enable subsequent films to be deposited. These films were deposited by a combination of screen printing and evaporation and did not function due to short circuiting. Another approach by Lee et al.34 was fabrication of OSCs on a flexible PET/ITO substrate, which was then attached to a conductive fabric which acted as the bottom electrode. This approach does not add functionality to the textile itself and uses evaporation processes for some of the films. Other research has explored fabrication of a functional organic PV fibre which can then be woven into a textile.35–38 This approach demonstrated a maximum efficiency of 0.5%, but the method fundamentally limits the output of the solar cell because once woven into a textile the PV layer is inevitably partially shaded. This approach is also being explored in the European Union funded project Powerweave39 but this has yet to report any results on fibres. Inorganic solar cells on fabrics have been reported only once in the literature; evaporated CIGS PV textiles have been demonstrated by Powertextile Ltd with a reported efficiency of 13%.40 This is a promising value for harvesting energy but the evaporation based fabrication method isn't compatible with large scale textile manufacture and the material toxicity remains a significant concern.
While the organic functional layers in OSCs are deposited using solution-based processes such as spin-coating, spray-coating, precision-die coating, inkjet printing and dip-coating, the cathode and anode metal layers have typically been deposited using vacuum based thermal evaporation.41–45 This was due to the absence of a suitable solution based process for electrodes that give a low work function. Recently, however, several research groups have evaluated silver nanowire (AgNW) solutions for use as flexible electrodes to fabricate OSCs. These have demonstrated a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to those using indium tin oxide (ITO) and other metal evaporated electrodes.46–49 Most recently, Guo et al. reported solar cells on glass substrates fabricated entirely by solution based processing with AgNW as top and bottom electrodes.50,51 However, a detailed study of an entirely solution processed device on a fabric substrate has not yet been demonstrated. Moreover, fully spray-coated OSCs on a standard woven polyester cotton fabric have never been reported.
Among the various solution process techniques, spray-coating can accept a much wider range of rheological dispersions or solutions compared to inkjet printing, which has a strict acceptance range of the functional ink's rheological properties. The principle of spray-coating is to atomise the dispersion or solution, therefore enabling thin films to be deposited which is essential to achieve functional OSCs. Other solution based processes such as spin-coating are not compatible with large scale textile manufacture and dip-coating techniques would consume large quantities of the active material due to the porous nature of the fabric. In this work, we have produced fabric based solar cells using a fully spray-coated method to obtain functional photovoltaic textiles that are processed under low temperature conditions (<150 °C) on a standard 65/35 polyester cotton fabric.
Experimental methods
The approach described in detail below involves using a screen printable polyurethane based interface paste (Fabink-UV-IF1) to smoothen the fabric surface and this is available from Smart FabricInks Ltd. The standard 65/35 polyester cotton fabric was supplied by Klopman International. A metallic AgNW suspension in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), supplied by Nanopyxis, was used as the electron and hole collecting electrodes. A thin electron transport layer of ZnO-NP with an average particle size <35 nm dispersion (40 wt%) in ethanol was supplied by Buhler. The hole transport layer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) dispersion in water was supplied by Heraeus (PH1000). A blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, supplied by Plextronics, was used as the photoactive layer. Kintec supplied patterned ITO glass substrates. These materials were used as supplied with no further modifications being required in order to use them in the spray-coating process. Transmittance measurements were examined using Bentham PV instrumentation.
Fabrication of OSCs by the spray-coating method
The construction of fabric solar cells begins by screen printing interface layers onto fabric substrates. The purpose of the interface layer is to reduce the surface roughness of the fabric and present a smooth layer to support the subsequent spray-coated films. The screen design ensures that the interface layer is only printed where required, thereby maintaining the fabric's flexibility and maximising breathability compared to commercial pre-coated fabrics. The printer squeegee pressure was set to 6 kg and the printing gap was 0.8 to 1 mm. The film was cured with a UV dose of 1500 mJ cm−2 thereby avoiding a thermal curing process that would release potentially harmful volatile organic compounds. The interface layer has a surface free energy of ∼35 mN m−1 which was measured using a Kruss DSA30B tensiometer. This value confirms that the surface promotes the wettability of the majority of solvent-based functional electronic inks, which have a lower surface tension typically around 30 mN m−1. The ink’s wettability, representing the interaction between the ink and substrate, defines the pattern resolution before the curing stage. The interface layer coated fabric substrate (IF fabric) has good thermal resistance and can withstand a processing temperature of 150 °C for up to 45 minutes in a conventional thermal oven without degradation. This is important since it constrains the materials and processes used in subsequent film depositions. The 65/35 polyester cotton fabric is a commonly used textile for standard clothing.

Fig. 1(a) shows a cross-section of the fabrication process, comprising two deposition stages for the interface and one functional layer. Fig. 1 (i)–(iv) show the screen printing of the interface layer on the fabric substrate. As there are typically five functional layers in the solar cell structure, stages (v) to (viii) were repeated 4 more times after the first functional layer deposition to obtain the multilayer spray-coated fabric solar cells shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) shows the plan view of the spray coated solar cells on fabrics with 8 pixels being fabricated in one device. Fig. 1(d) shows the plan rear view of the solar cell fabric substrate, which demonstrates that the addition of the interface and the spray-coated solar cells does not change the feel and appearance of the underside of the fabric. The first functional layer of the fabric solar cell is the bottom electrode comprising AgNW which has better flexibility than evaporated thin metal layers in which micro-cracks can occur during bending.52 The spray-coating distance was initially 15 cm from the spray nozzle to the substrate with a differential pressure inlet/outlet of 0.3 bar. All spray-coating steps were performed under ambient atmospheric conditions. For the preliminary experiment the coating parameters remained the same for the deposition of all the functional layers on the IF fabrics. However, the devices made in the optimised stage have an increased spraying distance to obtain the reduced layer thickness. The spray distance became 20 cm for AgNW, P3HT:ICBA and PEDOT:PSS layers while maintaining 30 cm for the ZnO-NP layer. The spray-coated AgNW layer was baked at 130 °C for 5 minutes in a box oven to obtain an AgNW film with a thickness of ∼100 nm. The ZnO-NP dispersion was successively spray-coated on top of the AgNW bottom electrodes and baked at 60 °C for 10 minutes to obtain a solidified layer. Afterwards, the PV layer of P3HT:ICBA was spray-coated onto the top of the ZnO-NP layer. The deposited layers were subsequently annealed in an argon oven at room temperature, ramping up to 135 °C in 30 minutes, and then annealed for a further 30 minutes. Then, the hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS was spray-coated and baked at 100 °C in a box oven for 5 minutes. To complete the device fabrication, a semi-transparent AgNW electrode was spray-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer.

During processing, the fabric substrates were glued to an alumina tile that supported the fabric keeping it flat for each subsequent functional layer deposition. The performance of the fabric solar cells was tested after peeling off from the alumina tiles. The peeling off angle to the alumina tile is about 60 degrees. In addition, pre-heating the alumina tile under 50 °C on a hotplate facilitated the peeling-off process, minimising potential damage that might be caused by the strain. The standalone fabric solar cells showed good flexibility after peeling off. For the purposes of comparison, we also fabricated the OSCs by spray-coating onto glass substrates using the same parameters. In addition, we also fabricated fabric solar cells utilising a spin-coating and evaporation method. Experimental and fabrication details of the spin-coated fabric solar cells are given in the ESI.† There were 48 devices made for each device type and all spray-coated devices were measured in the ambient atmosphere immediately after fabrication. However, we only report the best performing cell in terms of conversion efficiency for each device type. The measurement results of the other devices show relatively low conversion efficiencies of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower, compared to the best performing device. Differences are due to inconsistent processing and uneven film coverage. The current density versus voltage (J/V) curves of photovoltaic devices were obtained by a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) irradiation using an ABET solar simulator, calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The effective area of each cell was 6 mm2 and was defined by the shadow mask. The surface morphology of the AgNW was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis using a JEOL JSM 7500F instrument. The cross-section of the fabric solar cells was examined by an EVO Zeiss SEM. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to evaluate the surface morphology on each functional layer using a Veeco Innova instrument.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows a cross-sectional view of the woven 65/35 polyester cotton fabric structure with interlacing warp and weft yarns, which illustrates the rough surface profile of the material. Fig. 2(b) shows a cross-sectional view of the fabric after printing of the interface layer with three layers being required to obtain a smooth interface surface with an average thickness of 150 μm. Fig. 2(c) presents an SEM image of an AgNW electrode viewed from above on a fabric substrate using the spray-coating method. The nature of the randomly dispersed AgNW is to form overlapping wires each a few tens of micrometres in length and a few tens of nanometres in diameter. As shown in Fig. 2(d), subsequent deposition of the ZnO-NP layer reduces the surface roughness of the AgNW due to the ZnO-NP filling up the scaffold structure of the AgNW.

Fig. 2(d) clearly shows that the flattened AgNWs were covered by the ZnO-NP and successfully coated by the spray-deposition of a P3HT:ICBA active layer. The PEDOT:PSS layer was difficult to observe in the cross-section image, since it is relatively thin compared to the AgNW film. The P3HT:ICBA blend used in this study generally performs well with thicker films, unlike other high performance organic polymers that require an optimised thickness of around 100–200 nm. The J/V measurements of the solar cells studied in this work are shown in Fig. 3 and 4 and the results are summarised in Table 1. Device type 1 was fabricated on the fabric and gave a maximum PCE of 0.01% with a FF of 0.24, VOC of 0.55 V and JSC of 0.11 mA cm−2, as shown in Table 1. For comparison, device type 2 was spray-coated with the same functional layers on a glass substrate, which gave a maximum PCE of 0.1% with a FF of 0.30, VOC of 0.61 V and JSC of 0.76 mA cm−2. As displayed in Fig. 4, the J/V curve of device type 2 indicates a higher rectification, which suggests better diode behaviour due to the smoother surface of the P3HT:ICBA layer and uniform coverage of the PEDOT:PSS layer. VOC and FF values of the spray-coated OSCs on both fabric and glass substrates are nearly identical, but the JSC is lower for the fabric OSCs. This may be attributed to the peeling-off stage from the alumina tiles after fabrication. Bending caused by the peeling-off stage may generate micro-sized cracks on the conductive and other functional layers, which will increase the resistance across the junction to further reduce the JSC current. Thus device type 1 leads to a higher series resistance compared to its glass counterpart in device type 2. However, it can be seen from the J/V measurement plots that the fabric solar cells did not suffer significantly from peeling-off from the alumina tiles, as shown in Fig. 3. The transmittance spectra of the fully solution processed organic solar cells and the AgNW films are displayed in Fig. 5 alongside a standard ITO electrode for reference. It can be seen that the spray-coated AgNW electrode (sheet resistance = 60 Ω sq.−1 and T = 75% at 550 nm), shows high transmittance characteristics in the visible region of 450–850 nm. However, the AgNW electrode showed a lower transmittance than the ITO film, which is attributed to the increased AgNW density and improved contact of nanowires.

The spray-coated solar cells on glass substrates (device type 2) show a transparency of 47% at 550 nm wavelength. Additionally, device type 2 displayed 60% transparency at wavelengths beyond 650 nm as the P3HT:ICBA layer is largely absorption free and these types of devices are highly favourable for optoelectronic applications such as power generating windows and tandem solar cell devices. As discussed above, the fabric solar cells did function with ZnO-NP and P3HT:ICBA thicknesses of ∼4 μm, as shown in Fig. 6(a)(i). However, these thick layers can cause high resistance across the junction while cells are under operation and this is reflected in the low PCE value of 0.01%. Therefore, thinner ZnO-NP and P3HT:ICBA were targeted for the optimising stage. As shown in Fig. 6(a)(ii), the devices were fabricated with an optimised layer thickness down to hundreds of nm for all the functional layers. It was initially found, however, that the thin ZnO-NP and P3HT:ICBA films fill the scaffold structure of the AgNW but fail to sufficiently separate the top and bottom electrodes which leads to a short circuit.

In order to avoid a short circuit, the bottom AgNW layer was first flattened by compressing the nanowires while annealing the fabric devices at 150 °C for 15 minutes in an oven.47,53 The additional layers were then spray-coated giving the structure shown in Fig. 6(a)(iii). This approach prevented the short circuits and resulted in an increased photovoltaic performance (device type 3 in Table 1). Device type 3 gave a maximum PCE of 0.02% with a FF of 0.25. Remarkably, after optimisation device type 3 demonstrated a two-fold increase of JSC compared to device type 1. The cross-sectional SEM image of device type 3 in Fig. 6(b) clearly shows the individual layers with no interlayer mixing being observed even after greatly reducing the thickness of all the layers. From Table 1, it should also be noted that the series resistance of device type 3 is less than a third of that found for device type 1. This may be due to interlayer mixing between the P3HT:ICBA/ZnO-NP and ZnO-NP/PEDOT:PSS layers which might have occurred in device type 1 but have been avoided in device type 3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements have been carried out on device type 3 to evaluate the surface morphology of each key functional layer in the deposited fabric solar cells. A 5 μm × 5 μm area of the films was scanned by the AFM in tapping mode. The surface roughness of the spray-coated AgNW on IF fabrics exhibited a root mean square (rms) value of 30 nm. The surface roughness of the spray-coated ZnO-NP on AgNW/IF fabrics increases as shown in Fig. 7. The image reveals that the surface roughness has increased with an rms value of 287 nm. Referring to Fig. 8, it can be seen that the P3HT:ICBA film smooths out the surface roughness of the ZnO-NP film. The P3HT:ICBA film contains nanocrystalline grains with an average diameter of about 60–80 nm and the resulting film roughness rms equals 44 nm.

This level of surface roughness is not ideal and may lead to the recombination of holes and electrons and hence a reduced photocurrent. For comparison, we also fabricated OSCs using spin-coating and evaporation methods on fabric (device type 4) and glass substrates (device type 5). Device type 4 used evaporated aluminium as the bottom electrode followed by spin-coated PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:ICBA layers. A semi-transparent top electrode was formed by evaporating 10 nm of calcium and aluminium. Device type 4 gave a maximum PCE of 5 × 10−3% with a FF of 0.26, a VOC of 0.74 V and a JSC of 0.02 mA cm−2, as shown in Table SI1.† Device type 5 was fabricated with a conventional architecture of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:ICBA layers on an ITO glass substrate. The device was completed by thermal evaporation of 40 nm of calcium and 40 nm of aluminium and gave a maximum PCE of 4.5% with a high fill factor of 0.63. The J/V curves of device types 4 and 5 are displayed in Fig. SI1.† Considering the two fabric solar cells (3 and 4) made by different fabrication processes, device type 3 exhibited a higher PCE (0.02%) than device type 4 (5 × 10−3%). The higher series resistance as shown in Table SI1† may explain the reduced PCE in device type 4.
Further work will focus on optimising the thickness of the ZnO-NP and P3HT:ICBA layers in order to improve the collection of electrons from the device and to maximise light absorption respectively. Furthermore, a spray-coated encapsulation layer will be investigated in the future to protect the device and enhance its durability and lifetime. As this fully spray-coated organic solar cell on textile substrate approach is targeting the wearable electronics industry in energy harvesting applications for powering on-body sensors and communications externally, the durability study is essential towards a later stage of this work. We have carried out the initial automated bending test using different radii (2.5 cm, 1 cm and 0.5 cm) of the bending rail in 100 and 200 cycles. The preliminary results show that the performance of the fabric solar cells have lost their photovoltaic functionalities. The main issue that we identified for the cause of failure was the additional materials added for the purposes of testing and protecting the devices. Electrical connection to the electrodes on each device was achieved using a silver epoxy dot for testing purposes. This is a stiff material and bending damaged the functional layers and cell structure. In addition, for the purposes of the cyclical bending test the cells are placed in a pocket in a stretchable textile band and to prevent this from rubbing the layers, a protective UV curable epoxy encapsulation layer was added. However, this was found to be too rigid and caused the device layers to delaminate from the textile substrate destroying the cell structure. However, the encapsulation material on the spray coated solar cells on glass substrates was evaluated in order to determine if it successfully sealed the cells with degrading performance. Cells were fabricated on glass and their efficiency was tested immediately after fabrication but before encapsulation. The cells were then encapsulated and tested again and the PCE was found to be unaffected by the encapsulation process. The encapsulation layer was also found to protect the cells against oxidation with the encapsulated cells demonstrating a performance of 0.1% PCE straight after fabrication and after 4 days' storage in the ambient atmosphere. Un-encapsulated cells were completely non-functional after 4 days' storage in the ambient atmosphere. In order to test the robustness of the functional layers flexible electrical and encapsulating layers have to be used that can themselves withstand the bending test. We are currently reviewing and investigating highly flexible encapsulation transparent layers that minimise the strain force developed in the functional layers during the bending test. Similarly, flexible conductive materials are under investigation and this research is ongoing in order to improve the durability of the fabric solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, fully spray-coated fabric solar cells on standard polyester cotton fabrics have been demonstrated. A standard polyester cotton fabric was pre-treated with a screen printed interface layer to significantly reduce surface roughness and obtain compatible wettability for the subsequent deposition of functional inks. The results gave a maximum PCE of 0.01% for all the solution-processed spray-coated fabric solar cells and 5 × 10−3% for spin-coated fabric solar cells. The optimised spray-coated solar cells on fabric substrates gave a maximum PCE of 0.02% when the thicknesses of the ZnO-NP and P3HT:ICBA layers were reduced. Compressing the bottom AgNW layer during the annealing stage prevents short circuits and lowers the resistance, while reducing the thickness of the ZnO-NP layer in the optimised device also improves device performance. An optimised solution may be used to manufacture energy harvesting textiles to integrate into and supply the power source to wearable electronic systems.
