    , Accepted 11th April 2016First published on 11th April 2016AbstractTwo wide bandgap donor–acceptor type π-conjugated polymers based on dithienobenzodithiophene as the donor unit and difluorobenzotriazole or difluorobenzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit were designed and synthesized. The copolymer based on difluorobenzothiadiazole exhibited more pronounced aggregations in chlorobenzene solutions than that of the copolymer based on difluorobenzotriazole. Both copolymers exhibited relatively wide bandgaps with deep highest occupied molecular orbitals, leading to high open circuit voltages of over 0.95 V for the fabricated polymer solar cells. These copolymers exhibited quite analogous hole mobility of about 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 as measured by organic field effect transistors. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on these copolymers as the electron-donating materials and PC71BM as the electron-accepting material exhibited relatively high performance, with the best power conversion efficiency of 7.45% attained for the copolymer based on the difluorobenzothiadiazole unit. These results demonstrated that the constructed wide bandgap π-conjugated polymers can be promising candidates for the fabrication of high performance solar cells with multi-junction architectures.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest in the past two decades due to their unique advantages of light weight and low-cost production through the use of solution processes.1–4 Recently, power conversion efficiency (PCE) has achieved over 10% for both single junction and multi-junction PSCs.5,6 These achievements are based on the remarkable progress of π-conjugated copolymers with alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) configurations along the polymer backbone, which have proved to be versatile for molecular design and modification.7–14 While tremendous research efforts into conjugated polymers have focused on the development of narrow (Eg ∼ 1.4 eV)15 and medium (Eg ∼ 1.6 eV)15 bandgap conjugated polymers to intensify the harvesting of solar energy, the construction of wide bandgap (Eg > 1.7 eV)15,16 conjugated polymers with high efficiency is of less concern.17,18 While various strategies, such as multi-junction,19,20 ternary blend,21,22 and non-fullerene23,24 solar cells can attain high performance based on complementary absorption of multi-components in the photoactive layer, it is of vital importance to develop new conjugated polymers with relatively wide bandgaps (WBG) to achieve complementary absorption profiles with narrow bandgap counterparts.
Two dimensional benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives have been widely used as weak donors for high performance solar cells,25–29 such as the copolymer of [[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th),30–33 which can achieve high power conversion efficiency of over 10%. A new building block of dithienobenzodithiophene (DTBDT)34–37 has recently emerged, which has extended the π-conjugated length of the BDT unit by fusing an additional thienyl unit. This has been used to construct donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers with improved device performance due to enhanced current density.38,39 For instance, Hou et al. reported a thienyl-substituted DTBDT unit-based copolymer PDT-S-T, which was blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) as the active layer of photovoltaic devices to give a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.79% without using any special treatment.34 Xia et al. demonstrated that changing the groups on DTBDT, which copolymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives, an optimal PCE of 6.39% was achieved from PSCs based on PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16.35 Kwon et al. described copolymers PDTBDT-TTEH and PDTBDT-DTPD using DTBDT as the electron rich unit, and the best performance with PCE of 6.74% with high stability was obtained by blending them with PC71BM in PSCs.34,36 Sun et al. developed the DTBDT-based wide bandgap polymer PDBDT-T1, and high PCEs of 9.74% were achieved when applied in PSCs.37 These achievements suggest that the DTBDT unit can be a promising building block for the construction of high performance polymeric materials for PSCs.
The extensively used electron-accepting units, 5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (FBTz) and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT), have attracted much attention due to their stronger electron-withdrawing properties relative to their non-fluorinated counterparts. A variety of high performance conjugated polymers have been developed using FBTz or FBT as the electron-accepting moiety and BDT, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CDT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS), or tetrathiophene derivatives as the electron-donating unit.40–44
Based on the aforementioned merits of the electron-rich unit of DTBDT and the electron-deficient unit of FBTz and FBT, we herein designed and synthesized two wide bandgap D–A type conjugated copolymers PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT based on DTBDT as the donor unit with FBTz and FBT as the acceptor units, respectively. Both copolymers exhibited relatively wide bandgaps with optical bandgaps of 1.76 eV and 2.02 eV for PDTBDT-FBT and PDTBDT-FBTz, respectively. These copolymers also showed comparable hole mobilities of around 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 as evaluated by field effect transistors. The PSC based on PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM as the photoactive layer exhibited a higher PCE of 7.45% than that of 5.55% obtained from device based on PDTBDT-FBTz, which can be correlated to the slightly narrower bandgap associated with the more extended absorbance than the former.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of monomer and copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. 2-Ethylhexyl-3-hexylthiophene (1) was treated by n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by quick addition of 5,10-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-5,10-dione. Subsequently, a solution of SnCl2 in 10% HCl was added to the reaction mixture, giving 5,10-di(2-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthiophen-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (2) in a moderate yield of 47%. The bisstannyl monomer 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-di(2-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthiophen-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (M1) was synthesized based on similar procedures as a previously reported method in a good yield of 84%.45 The diiodo-monomer 2-dodecyl-5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodo-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (M2) and the dibromo-monomer 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M3) were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.43,46 Palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization of the bistannyl monomer M1 with M2 and M3 gave copolymers PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. Purification of the copolymers was carried out by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform as the eluents. The copolymers can be easily dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene at room temperature.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of copolymers. 
The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of copolymers were measured by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene as the eluent and liner polystyrene as the standard. Mn of PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT was estimated to be 37.1 and 37.8 kDa with polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.5 and 2.8, respectively. The decomposition temperature with 5% weight loss (Td) of copolymers was determined to be higher than 400 °C, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). However, no discernible thermal transition can be obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis in the scanning range from 30 to 300 °C, with the heating/cooling rate of 20 °C min−1 in nitrogen (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Photophysical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of copolymers in chlorobenzene (CB) solution with concentration of about 10−5 g mL−1 and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1a, and detailed parameters of photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1. Both copolymers exhibited characteristic dual-absorption profiles with the high energy band correlated to the π–π* transition, whereas the much stronger low energy band can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer effect. When comparing to the thin film of PDTBDT-FBTz, one observed an approximately 60 nm bathochromic shift in the maximum absorption peak (λfilmmax) for PDTBDT-FBT film. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT are 2.02 and 1.76 eV, respectively, as estimated from the absorption onset in thin films. It was also noted that the UV-Vis spectra are quite comparable in CB solution and thin films for both copolymers, indicating that the polymers probably formed some pre-aggregates in solution due to the strong intermolecular interactions.47

To reveal the formation of aggregation in a solution, temperature-dependent absorption spectra of the copolymers in CB solution were investigated, with relevant UV-Vis spectra of copolymer PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. For the CB solution of PDTBDT-FBTz, it was noted that the 0–0 vibrational peak gradually decreased, whereas the 0–1 peak obviously enhanced when the temperature of the solution increased from 25 °C to 88 °C, which can be attributed to the breakup of aggregation at increased temperatures. In contrast, less pronounced variation of UV-Vis profiles was observed for PDTBDT-FBT copolymer, where the 0–0 peak slightly decreased, whereas the 0–1 peak remained nearly unchanged with the increasing temperature. This observation can be ascribed to the stronger intermolecular interaction of PDTBDT-FBT due to the lack of the alkyl side chain in the FBT unit.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the copolymers. The corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. 2 and detailed electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. For copolymers PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, the oxidation onset potentials (Eox) referred to ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) were estimated to be 1.06 and 1.10 V, whereas the reduction onset potentials (Ere) were estimated to be −1.16 and −0.87 V, respectively. Under exactly the same conditions, the onset of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.39 V relative to a reference electrode. Assuming that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum energy level, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be calculated according to the equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.41) eV and ELUMO = −e(Ere + 4.41) eV. Thus, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.47/−3.25 eV and −5.51/−3.54 eV for PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. It was realized that copolymer PDTBDT-FBT exhibited simultaneously reduced HOMO/LUMO energy levels compared to the copolymer PDTBDT-FBTz. The more pronounced decrease in LUMO rather than HOMO energy level leads to a reduced electrochemical bandgap of 1.97 eV for PDTBDT-FBT, which is slightly lower than that of 2.22 eV for the copolymer PDTBDT-FBTz. This observation is in excellent agreement with the optical properties as measured by the UV-Vis spectra.

DFT calculation
To further inspect the molecular backbone conformation and frontier molecular orbitals of the copolymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the Gaussian 09 package48 by modeling the trimer compounds. Herein, all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl to simplify the calculation. Fig. 3 illustrates the calculated molecular conformation and frontier molecular orbitals of the model compounds. It was noted that both HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the backbone for (DTBDT-FBTz)3. In contrast, HOMO is delocalized across the chain of (DTBDT-FBT)3, whereas the LUMO is mainly located at the electron-deficient FBT moieties, which can be attributed to the stronger electronegativity of the FBT unit. The calculated bandgaps are 2.34 eV and 2.00 eV for DTBDT-FBTz and DTBDT-FBT, respectively, which follow the same trend as the CV experimental results.

It can also be noted that the backbones of these model compounds are quite coplanar, which can be correlated to the existence of the non-bonding interactions of C–F⋯S and C–H⋯N induced by DTBDT units and FBTz/FBT motifs.49,50 In addition, potential energy scans (PESs) were carried out to investigate the relative energy as a function of dihedral angles for the repeating unit of (DTBDT-FBTz)1 and (DTBDT-FBT)1 (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Both model fragments reached two minima, corresponding to the fully coplanar 0°/180° conformations, implying that the conjugated backbone of the two copolymers exhibited excellent rigidity and planarity.
OFET characterization
To investigate the charge transport properties of the copolymers, top-gate bottom-contact (TG-BC) organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with the architecture of Au/polymer/CYTOP/Au were fabricated. The polymer thin films were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 20 min to facilitate the formation of ordered microstructures. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding output and transfer curves. Both copolymers exhibited a remarkable p-type transport behavior with quite comparable hole mobility of 0.09 and 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. The current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff) are in the order of 104–105 for these copolymers. We note that from the perspective of measuring charge carrier mobility, the mobility obtained from OFET measurement only reveals the charge carrier transport in a lateral direction, instead of reflecting the charge carrier mobility distribution in a vertical direction such as in the bulk-heterojunction film in PSC devices.37,43,51–56 Nevertheless, the relatively high hole mobility obtained by OFET measurement indicated good charge transport properties for applications in various organic electronic devices.

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties of the resulted copolymers were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Ca/Al using chlorobenzene as the solvent. The active area is determined to be 0.04 cm2 with a shadow mask. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Our initial effort was carried out by screening the weight ratios of polymer:PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester) of 1:1, 1:1.5, and 1:2. We noted that the best performances can be achieved from the device based on the polymer:PC61BM ratio of 1:1.5 with a PCE of 4.17% for PDTBDT-FBTz and a slightly higher PCE of 5.36% for PDTBDT-FBT. Relevant J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S3 and detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (see the ESI†).
The optimization of devices was initially carried out by thermally annealing the photoactive layer; however, this did not result in an enhanced PCE. Further optimization was performed by replacing PC61BM with PC71BM, since the latter has a broader absorption spectrum. The device performance was greatly improved by virtue of the obviously enhanced short circuit current (Fig. 5a), with the PCE = 5.55% (VOC = 0.95 V, JSC = 9.32 mA cm−2, FF = 62.7%) for PDTBDT-FBTz and PCE = 7.45% (VOC = 0.98 V, JSC = 12.76 mA cm−2, FF = 59.6%) for PDTBDT-FBT (Table 2). Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices consisting of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt) as the photoactive layer. These devices exhibited relatively broad EQE responses from 300 to 700 nm, whereas the device based on PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM exhibited a much broader response relative to that of the PDTBDT-FBTz:PC71BM device. The recorded EQE values reached about 60% in the range of about 350–600 nm for PDTBDT-FBTz and 400–650 nm for PDTBDT-FBT devices. It is also worth noting that the calculated current densities obtained from the J–V characteristics are in good accordance with those of the integrated EQE spectra. Further optimization of device performance by incorporating the solvent additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) did not lead to an increased PCE (see Fig. S4 and Table S2 in ESI†). Nonetheless, the PCE of 7.45% associated with Eoptg of 1.76 eV for copolymer PDTBDT-FBT is among the highest PCE of the wide bandgap copolymers.16–18,32 Thus, it is reasonable to claim that this copolymer could be a promising candidate for application in the construction of multi-junction polymer solar cells.

To study the charge carrier recombination property in the devices, JSC under different light intensities was measured based on the BHJ film comprising polymer:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:1.5. The correlation between JSC and incident light intensity (Pin) can be expressed via JSC ∝ Pαin. As shown in Fig. 5c, the JSC showed a linear dependence on the light intensity for both devices, where the α values are very close to 1, suggesting that bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is negligible in these devices.24,37,57
Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements have been widely used to study the competition between carrier sweep-out by the internal field during the operation of PSCs.58,59 To reveal the charge extraction efficiency of devices based on the resulting copolymers, transient photocurrent measurements were carried out with relevant characteristics shown in Fig. 5d. It was noted that the PDTBDT-FBT-based device showed a photocurrent decay time of 0.20 μs, which was slightly shorter than that of 0.24 μs for PDTBDT-FBTz-based device, indicating more effective charge extraction and thus potentially higher JSC for the PDTBDT-FBT-based device.
Hole mobility
The hole mobilities of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt) blend films were evaluated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al were fabricated, where the thickness was 66 nm and 88 nm for devices based on PDTBDT-FBTz:PC71BM and PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM, respectively. The relevant J1/2–V characteristics are plotted in Fig. 6. The calculated hole mobility of PDTBDT-FBTz blend film is 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly lower than that of 3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDTBDT-FBT. High hole mobility is favorable for the attainment of high current densities.

Morphology
Previous studies demonstrated that film morphologies of the bulk heterojunction layer can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells.60,61 Thus, tapping mode atom force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to inspect the film morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend film. The blend films of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt) were fabricated under exactly the same conditions as those for device characterizations. The recorded AFM topography images are shown in Fig. 7. Distinct film morphology was observed for these blend films. The blend film of PDTBDT-FBTz:PC71BM exhibited comparatively small granular characteristics with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.5 nm (Fig. 7a). In contrast, one can clearly observe some aggregations with fibrous nanostructures across the entire film of the PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM (Fig. 7b), which can be correlated to the stronger intermolecular interactions of the PDTBDT-FBT copolymer. In addition, the PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM copolymers exhibited much rougher film morphology with an RMS value of 4.6 nm.
 Fig. 7  (a and c) AFM topography (5 μm × 5 μm) and (b and d) TEM images of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt) blend films. 
The TEM image of PDTBDT-FBTz:PC71BM blend film exhibited a relatively large domain size associated with the apparent percolated feature (Fig. 7b). In contrast, one observes obvious aggregations with size of about 150 ± 60 nm across the blend film of PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM (Fig. 7d), which could be attributed to the strong intermolecular interactions of PDTBDT-FBT. This observation agreed with the much coarser surface morphology as discerned by AFM. In this respect, there might be still some room for device performance improvement by optimizing the morphology of PDTBDT-FBT:PC71BM, which could be attained by a more rational design of the substitutions of the DTBDT unit62 or by more sophisticated film processing technologies.63
Conclusion
In summary, two wide bandgap conjugated copolymers PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT were designed and synthesized. As FBT exhibited stronger electron accepting ability with respect to the FBTz unit, the replacement of FBTz with FBT in the polymer backbone can increase the intramolecular charge transfer effect from donor to acceptor units, thus the absorption is red-shifted and the energy levels are simultaneously decreased. Both copolymers exhibited planar backbones with remarkable hole mobilities of about 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 as measured by field effect transistors. The best device performance was achieved with PCEs of 5.55% and 7.45% for PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. These results indicated that these wide bandgap copolymers can be promising candidates for the fabrication of high performance polymer solar cells based on complementary absorption properties such as non-fullerene polymer solar cells or multi-junction organic solar cells.
Experimental section
General measurement and characterization

1H and 13C spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer at 500 and 126 MHz, respectively. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). Number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were determined by an Agilent Technologies PL-GPC 220 high temperature chromatograph running in trichlorobenzene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Netzsch TG 209 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured on a Netzsch DSC 204 under nitrogen flow at a heating or cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) data were measured on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode and carried out with anhydrous acetonitrile tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte under nitrogen at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The copolymers were deposited on the working electrode. Potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple using ferrocene as standard. The oxidation potential of ferrocene was set at −4.80 eV with respect to zero vacuum level. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation of EHOMO = −[4.8 + e(Eox − EFc/Fc+)] (eV) and ELUMO = −[4.8 + e(Ere − EFc/Fc+)] (eV), respectively. Density function theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the B3LYP hybrid functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set in the Gaussian 09 package. Potential energy scans (PESs) were performed using redundant coordinate editor and scanning the dihedral angles in 12 steps of 15° increments from 0° to 180°. Atom force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Bruker Multimode8 microscope in tapping mode. TEM measurements were performance on a JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope. The transient photocurrent of devices was measured by applying 580 nm laser pulses with a pulse width of 120 fs and a low pulse energy to the short-circuited devices in the dark. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (SpectraPhysics Spitfire Ace). The photocurrent produced a transient voltage signal on a 50 Ω resistor, which was recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C).
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells (PSCs)
All devices were fabricated using a conventional structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Ca/Al. A 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on an ITO-coated glass substrate that was treated by oxygen plasma for 4 min, then annealed at 150 °C on a hotplate for 20 min. The thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS and active layer were measured by a Tencor Alpha-step 500 Surface Profilometer. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene (CB) solution on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of polymer:PCBM active blend layers was around 80 nm for PDTBDT-FBTz and 100 nm for PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. Finally, the device was finished after a 8 nm calcium and aluminum cathode (80 nm) (thickness monitored with an STM-100/MF Sycon quartz crystal) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (about 1.0 × 10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask defining an active device area of 0.04 cm2. We used a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter to measure current density–voltage (J–V) curves under 1 sun (AM 1.5G spectrum) generated from a class solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Fabrication and characterization of hole-only devices
The hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (80 nm). The thickness of the blend films was 66 and 88 nm for PDTBDT-FBTz and PDTBDT-FBT, respectively. The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under an applied forward bias. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 236 sourcemeter. The mobilities were extracted by fitting the current–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship64 (space-charge-limited current, SCLC).
Fabrication and characterization of organic field effect transistors (OFETs)
OFETs were fabricated in bottom-contact and top-gate geometry. First, the gold film (20 nm) was deposited under vacuum as the source and drain electrodes through a shadow mask on the glass, defining a channel width/length (W/L) of 500/70 μm. Then, the copolymer films (∼30 nm) were spin-coated on the substrates, and the films were annealed at 100 °C for 20 min in nitrogen. A layer of commercially available perfluorinated polymer CYTOP™ (450 nm) was applied by spin coating a diluted CYTOP solution (CYTOP CTL-809M:CT-Solv.180 = 3:1) on the copolymer film at a speed of 3000 rpm for 40 s. Gold film as the gate electrode (40 nm) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (about 1.0 × 10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask. The OFET characterizations were performed in air using a probe station and a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Aglient 4155C).
