    , Accepted 19th August 2012First published on 21st August 2012AbstractNew low band gap copolymers PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT using BDT-T and BT as donor and acceptor, with different π-bridge units thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and thiophene, respectively, were synthesized. The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were characterized. PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT films show broad absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge at over 751 nm, and possess relatively low-lying HOMO levels at −5.11 eV and 5.15 eV. A high hole mobility of 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was recorded for PBDTT–DTTBT, that is two orders of magnitude higher than PBDTT–DTBT (1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is ascribed to the application of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as π-bridge units. The PCE of the PSC device based on PBDTT–DTTBT/PC70BM (1:1, w/w) reached 6.03% with a Jsc of 12.46 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V and a FF of 0.62, while PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM (1:1, w/w) only has a PCE of 2.34% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.495 under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. These results indicate that PBDTT–DTTBT is a promising photovoltaic material. Furthermore, it can be concluded that extending the conjugation of the backbone units, as demonstrated in this work, has little influence on the molecular energy levels, but can be seen as a feasible strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of D–π–A conjugated polymers by enhancing intermolecular interactions.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively investigated in both scientific research and industrial applications during the last decade, because of their potential applications in making large area, light weight, flexible photovoltaic panels through low-cost solution-processable techniques.1 Conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are commonly used as electron donors and electron acceptor materials, respectively, in PSCs with a BHJ structure.2 As it is well known, an ideal polymer electron donor material should possess a broad absorption band with a high extinction coefficient to absorb more sunlight, good mobility to facilitate charge transport, suitable molecular energy levels matching those of the fullerene acceptor, and appropriate compatibility with the fullerene acceptor to form a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network.
The design and synthesis of low band gap (LBG) polymers have been proven to be one of the successful strategies to improve the absorption of the conjugated polymers, because a broad absorption band can be realized by molecular structure design. Therefore, high short circuit density values (Jsc) can be obtained in PSCs based on LBG polymers. One of the broadly adapted strategies to design LBG polymers is to alternate the electron-rich (donor) and the electron-deficient (acceptor) units on the backbones of conjugated polymers.3 Conjugated polymers with alternating D–π–A (wherein π represents a conjugated bridge) architecture are particularly desirable due to the facile tunability of their electronic structures. In order to get D–π–A polymers for efficient PSCs, much effort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of new donor and acceptor building blocks.4 According to the reported work, thiophene or alkylthiophene units are mainly used as π-bridges in D–π–A polymers with efficient photovoltaic properties. Although the π-bridge unit has great influence on the photovoltaic properties of D–π–A polymers, there are only a few studies which focus on it.5,6 LBG polymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT) and bis(thiophen-2-yl)-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) have been designed, synthesized and applied in PSCs. A PCE over 5% has been achieved based on some of these PBDTDTBT-based polymers.7–10 Different strategies have been employed to improve the photovoltaic properties of this type of polymers. For example, Hou et al. reported a PBDTDTBT polymer with a deeper HOMO level;7 Huang et al. used a fused BT named naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5] thiadiazole (NT) to replace the BT unit,8 You et al. introduced fluorine atoms to BT units.9
In this work, we designed and synthesized a new D–π–A polymer in which alkylthiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT-T), benzothiadiazole (BT) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) are used as donor, acceptor and π-bridge units, respectively. As shown in Scheme 1, the TT unit was used as the π-bridge instead of thiophene. As it is known, TT has a rigid and coplanar fused ring, which ensures a highly delocalized π-electron system and strong intermolecular π–π stacking, and thus it has attracted much interest for the construction of high performance organic/polymer semiconductors for applications in optoelectronic devices.11–15 Some conjugated polymers with TT units on their backbones exhibit interesting properties in optoelectronic devices. For example, the field-effect transistor (FET) hole mobility of a conjugated polymer containing a TT unit reached as high as 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1,15 and in an earlier report, when the thiophene bridge was replaced by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, the FET hole mobility can be improved by one or two orders of magnitude,16 from 8.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 or from 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the D–A copolymer PSCs based on TT as donor unit exhibited a high PCE over 5%.14,15 Based on the reported work, we believe that the hole mobility and thus the photovoltaic properties of the polymer will be improved after replacing the thiophene unit by the TT unit. However, fused thiophene oligomers or polymers usually show poor solubility at room temperature. In order to overcome this disadvantage, n-C11H23 groups were introduced onto the 3-positions of TT, and more bulky groups, hexyldecyl, were employed as substituents on the BDT units. Consequently, PBDTT–DTTBT, the new D–π–A copolymer, was designed on account of the above points. As comparison, we also synthesized another new polymer PBDTT–DTBT (shown in Scheme 1), in which the π-bridge unit is thiophene. Consequently, compared with the analogous BT-based polymer, the TTBT-based polymer exhibited higher mobility, higher Jsc and FF, and a much improved PSC performance, with a PCE of 6%.

Results and discussion
Thermal properties
The synthetic routes of the monomers and the polymer of PBDTT–DTTBT were shown in Scheme 2. The polymers have good solubility in chloroform and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) but poor solubility in toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of PBDTT–DTTBT estimated by the GPC method is 31 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.1 (the temperature of the GPC test is room temperature), while PBDTT–DTBT has a Mw of 56 kDa with a PDI of 2.8. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with TGA, as shown in Fig. 1. The TGA plot reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT are 440 °C and 455 °C, respectively. This indicates that both of the two polymers' thermal stabilities are adequate for applications in optoelectronic devices. Through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, neither endo- nor exothermic processes were observed in the range of 30–280 °C (as shown in Fig. S1†).

UV-visible absorption and X-ray diffraction
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra provide information on the electronic structures of the conjugated polymers. Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution and films casted from chloroform solution and o-DCB solution on quartz substrate. PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT exhibit similar optical band gaps, which are 1.65 eV and 1.63 eV, respectively, indicating that the introduction of the extended π-bridge, as shown in this work, has little influence on the optical band gap. As shown in Fig. 2, PBDTT–DTBT shows an absorption peak (λmax) at 555 nm in chloroform solution and an absorption peak (λmax) at 619 nm in solid film casted from chloroform, and the absorption spectra of the films casted from chloroform and o-DCB solution are almost identical. The absorption spectrum of PBDTT–DTTBT in chloroform exhibits a peak at 607 nm, which is ∼60 nm red-shifted compared to that of PBDTT–DTBT, indicating that in solution state, the π-electrons of PBDTT–DTTBT can be delocalized better than in those of PBDTT–DTBT. Very interestingly, for PBDTT–DTTBT, the film casted from chloroform solution displays a different absorption spectrum compared to the film casted from o-DCB solution; the absorption spectrum of the film casted from o-DCB exhibits a strong shoulder peak at 680 nm. According to the reported work, this kind of shoulder peak is observed in the conjugated polymers due to strong intermolecular π–π stacking properties.17 Since o-DCB has a much higher boiling point than chloroform, the slower drying speed of the o-DCB solution gives longer time for the polymer to form a more ordered structure. Compared to the PBDTT–DTBT film processed by o-DCB, the absorption shoulder peak of the PBDTT–DTTBT film indicates that stronger or/and ordered intermolecular interactions might be formed in the PBDTT–DTTBT film due to the introduction of the extended π-bridge units.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have been used to investigate the formation of ordered structures within the thin films. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the films of PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT casted from o-DCB. The films of PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT show peaks at 2θ = 3.96° (corresponding to a d-spacing of 22.9 Å) and 2θ = 3.66° (corresponding to a d-spacing of 24.11 Å), respectively, and it is clear that the peak of PBDTT–DTTBT is much stronger than that of PBDTT–DTBT. Furthermore, the film of PBDTT–DTTBT shows pronounced (200) reflection at 7.89°, while only a (100) peak can be observed in the film of PBDTT–DTBT. The comparison between the XRD patterns of the two films clearly indicates that a more ordered structure can be formed in the film of PBDTT–DTTBT, which may be ascribed to the introduction of the extended π-bridge units. The results obtained from XRD measurements are in agreement with the phenomena observed in UV-vis absorption measurements.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to measure the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymers required for determining the molecular energy levels of the conjugated polymers.18 As shown in Fig. 4, PBDTT–DTTBT presents a reversible p-doping (Eox = 0.37 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+)) and an irreversible n-doping (Ered = −1.41 V vs. Fc/Fc+) process. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymers were calculated from the electrochemical onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered), respectively, where HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) (eV) and LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) (eV).19 The HOMO and LUMO levels, as well as the electrochemical band gap (EECg), of the polymer are −5.11 eV, −3.33 eV and 1.78 eV, respectively, calculated from φox and φred. PBDTT–DTBT presents reversible p-doping (Eox = 0.40 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+)) and n-doping (Ered = −1.48 V vs. Fc/Fc+) processes, and the HOMO and LUMO levels are −5.14 eV and −3.22 eV, and EECg is 1.88 eV.

Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with different D/A (polymer/PC70BM, w/w) ratios of PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 lists the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs fabricated under different conditions. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PBDTT–DTTBT was obtained from the PSC device with a D/A ratio of 1:1, with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 12.46 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.620, leading to a PCE of 6.03%, and the PCEs are reproducible. For example, in more than 20 devices, the average PCE of the PSCs is over 5.9%, and 8 devices are listed (see Table S1 and Fig. S2 in ESI†). Under the same conditions, the PBDTT–DTBT based device gives a PCE of 2.34% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.495, which is quite similar with the reported work.8

The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and the absorption spectra of the PSC devices under different conditions are shown in Fig. 6a and b. Since the absorption at long wavelength range is mainly from the polymer, the PSC device with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 shows the weakest absorbance at long wavelengths and also the lowest quantum efficiency (QE). Since the absorption in the range from 550 nm to 700 nm is mainly PC70BM, the PSC device with a D/A ratio of 1.5:1 shows weaker absorbance and thus a lower QE in this range; the PSC device with a D/A ratio of 1:1 exhibits more efficient QE in the whole response range, and therefore the highest Jsc was recorded under these conditions. It is worth pointing out that the discrepancy between the current density values calculated from the EQE and the J–V measurements is within 3%, indicating that the photovoltaic results are reliable in this work. In comparison with the reported work and the results obtained from this work, PBDTT–DTTBT exhibits much better photovoltaic performance than the PSCs based on PBDTT–DTBT, indicating that the extended conjugation of the backbone units, as demonstrated in this work, can be seen as a feasible method to improve the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers.

Morphology
Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to demonstrate the morphology of the blend films of PBDTT–DTTBT/PC70BM (w/w) with different ratios and PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM (w/w, 1:1). The AFM images under D/A ratios of 1:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1.5 are shown in Fig. 7. As shown, very uniform films can be formed under three different D/A ratios, and the roughness of the films is below 1.4 nm. As shown in Fig. S3,† the roughness of the PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM film is only 0.85 nm, indicating that a uniform film can also be formed in the PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM (w/w, 1:1) blend. Based on all the phase contrast images, the films show similar phase separation properties.

Hole mobility
Hole mobility is an important parameter for conjugated polymer donor photovoltaic materials. Herein, the hole mobility of the PBDTT–DTTBT/PC70BM blend film and the PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM blend film with a D/A ratio (w/w) of 1:1 were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method by a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM (w/w, 1:1)/Au and estimated through the Mott–Gurney equation.20Fig. 8 shows the ln(JL3/V2) versus (V/L)0.5 plot of the blend films. The hole mobilities of the PBDTT–DTTBT/PC70BM blend film and the PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM blend film are 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As reported, the hole mobilities of the two analogous polymers using thiophene as a bridge unit between the BT and BDT units are 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1,8,9 which is comparable with the mobility of PBDTT–DTBT. In comparison with these analogues, the hole mobility of PBDTT–DTTBT is about two orders of magnitude higher, which may benefit from the long range ordered structure of the PBDTT–DTTBT film due to the extended conjugation of the backbone units. The higher hole mobility of PBDTT–DTTBT is desirable for its application as a photovoltaic donor material in PSCs.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized the new copolymers PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT using BDT-T and BT as donor and acceptor, with different π-bridge units TT and thiophene, respectively. The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were characterized. PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT films show broad absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge at over 751 nm, and possess relatively low-lying HOMO levels at −5.11 eV and 5.15 eV. A high hole mobility of 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was recorded for PBDTT–DTTBT, that is two orders of magnitude higher than PBDTT–DTBT (1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is ascribed to the application of TT as π-bridge units. The PCE of the PSC device based on PBDTT–DTTBT/PC70BM (1:1, w/w) reached 6.03% with a Jsc of 12.46 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V and a FF of 0.62, while PBDTT–DTBT/PC70BM (1:1, w/w) only has a PCE of 2.34% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.495 under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. These results indicate that PBDTT–DTTBT is a promising photovoltaic material. Furthermore, it can be concluded that extending conjugation of the backbone units, as demonstrated in this work, has little influence on the molecular energy levels, but can be seen as a feasible strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of D–π–A conjugated polymers by enhancing intermolecular interactions.
Experimental section
Materials
3-Bromothiophene, ethyl 2-mercaptoacetate, Pd(PPh3)4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.; dodecanoyl chloride, 4,7-dibromo[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole were purchased from Acros Chemical Co., and they were used as received. Hexane and THF were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. The other materials were common commercial level and were used as received.
Instruments and measurements

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy measurements were carried out using a Hitachi U-3100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed on a Nanoscope III A (Vecco) AFM in tapping mode. The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by the GPC method, and polystyrene was used as the standard by using chloroform as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA Instruments, Inc., TGA-2050. The CVs were conducted on a CHI650D electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk, Pt plate, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. The potential of the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was internally calibrated by using the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which has a known energy level at −4.8 eV. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS and active layer were determined by an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Agilent B2912A Precision Source/Measure unit. The power conversion efficiencies of the resulting polymer solar cells were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G (air mass 1.5 global) spectrum from a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) using a XES-70S1 (SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., LTD.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photo-beam size). A 2 × 2 cm monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Fabrication of polymer solar cells
Polymer solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/Polymers:PC70BM/Ca(10 nm)/Al(80 nm) were fabricated under the conditions as follows: patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 Ohm per square was cleaned with a surfactant scrub and then underwent a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min, a 40 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and then dried by baking in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. The active layer, with a thickness in the range of 80–90 nm, was then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by casting from a 10 mg ml−1o-DCB solution. Finally, 10 nm Ca and 80 nm Al layers were successively deposited in vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 4 × 10−4 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 4 mm2. Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen drybox containing less than 10 ppm oxygen and moisture.

1.0 mmol of the monomers of 6 and 7 (compound 7 was synthesized according to ref. 22) were put into a three-neck flask. Then the mixed solvents (15 ml toluene and 3 ml DMF) were added under the protection of argon. The solution was flushed with argon for 10 min, and then 30 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added. After another flushing with argon for 20 min, the reactant was heated to reflux for 18 h. Then the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by adding 50 ml methanol, and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. The solid was dried under vacuum for 1 day.
