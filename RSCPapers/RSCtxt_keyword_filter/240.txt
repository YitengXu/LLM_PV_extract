    , Accepted 3rd December 2016First published on 5th December 2016AbstractMetal halide perovskites, particularly lead halide perovskites, have seen extraordinary breakthroughs in photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency swiftly surging to over 22% in the past few years, demonstrating their huge potential for rivalry with crystalline silicon solar cells in terms of production cost and performance for the future photovoltaic market. While a number of recent reviews have provided excellent overviews on the advances of metal halide perovskite materials in photovoltaics, herein we review the perovskite photovoltaics from the perspective of configuration and device design. More specifically, this review is centered on four configurations: rigid perovskite photovoltaics, flexible perovskite photovoltaics, semi-transparent perovskite photovoltaics and tandem perovskite photovoltaics. This review is going to meet the demand behind the industry and scientific community for the realistic application of perovskite photovoltaics in various requirements and circumstances.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, the stunning photovoltaic (PV) performance achieved by metal halide perovskites, including organic–inorganic hybrid lead/tin perovskites and all-inorganic lead/tin perovskites have made perovskite PVs one of the hottest research areas in the scientific community. From the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 9% of the first reported perovskite solid-state solar cells (PSCs),1 the PCE of the perovskite PVs has skyrocketed to over 20%,2,3 which rivals the performance of the leading player in the solar cell market, silicon solar cells, but the perovskite PVs have a much lower production cost. The success of perovskite PVs is partially laid on the foundation that has been built by organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), but more importantly, is attributed to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, such as their high absorption coefficient,4 high charge carrier mobility,5 small exciton binding energy,6 and long balanced electron/hole diffusion length.7
As the PCE of perovskite PVs approaches the Shockley–Queisser limit of around 31% for a single-junction PV based on CH3NH3PbI3 (direct band gap of ∼1.58 eV),8 the race of perovskite PVs to improve their PCE is slowing down. Meanwhile, it has reached a point for the scientific community to think about the realistic impact that perovskite materials can contribute to the world. One promising way is to develop semi-transparent PSCs for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), such as windows, roofs or facades. Another attempt is to design tandem solar cells that can work beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit set for single-junction solar cells.
In this review, we will not repeat the narrative on the morphology control of perovskite films, the working mechanism of perovskite PVs and the hysteresis issue that have been comprehensively discussed in previous reviews.9–11 Instead, we will focus on several classic configurations of perovskite solar cells, including rigid, flexible, semi-transparent and tandem PVs. Thus, this review helps to make a clear image of the structures of perovskite solar cells.
For metal halide perovskites that are targeted in this review, they share a three-dimensional structure with the generic chemical formula, (R–NH3)MX3 where M stands for a metal cation, X for a halogen and R–NH3 for a organic group.12 In some cases, R–NH3 can be replaced by inorganic cations, such as Cs+ to form all inorganic halide perovskites.13 Therefore, three-dimensional metal halide perovskites that are going to be focused on in the review can be abbreviated as AMX3 where A can be an organic group or an inorganic cation (Fig. 1).14

One of the key features of metal halide perovskites is their strong optical absorbance with a high absorption coefficient of ∼104 cm−1 at 550 nm and a broad light harvesting spectrum with an absorption onset of ∼800 nm for MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite,4 which make perovskite PVs free from the configuration limitation set by DSCs.15 More remarkably, a solution-processed MAPbI3 perovskite film can exhibit a charge carrier diffusion length of around 100 nm,16 which is equivalent to the absorbance depth of the perovskite film, and this value can be further extended to over 175 μm for single crystal MAPbI3 perovskite prepared from solutions.17 Furthermore, the solution-processed MAPbI3 perovskite film presents a high charge carrier mobility of over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1,5 and low exciton binding energy in the range of several meV.6,18 The unique photophysical properties of ABX3 perovskites have developed the configuration of perovskite PVs from a sensitized structure,1,16 to a meso-superstructure,19,20 mesoporous structure with a perovskite capping layer,2,3,21 “n–i–p” planar or “p–i–n” inverted planar heterojunction structure,22–25 and simplified thin film structure.26,27
In these configurations, hole transport materials (HTMs) are predominantly made from organic compounds/polymers, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),16,19,20,22,23 poly(triarylamine) (PTAA),2,28,29 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)30,31 with limited demonstrations using inorganic semiconductors, such as CuSCN,32,33 and NiO.34 In contrast to hole selective contacts, electron selective contacts have two big categories: inorganic semiconductors and organic molecules. Both of them have been demonstrated as efficient electron transporters in perovskite PVs. Inorganic semiconductors usually need to be annealed at high temperatures of around 500 °C to form crystals. Therefore, rigid substrates, such as fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass that can stand high temperatures are required. In contrast, organic electron transporters can be deposited on both rigid substrates and flexible substrates as they are processed at low temperatures of around 100 °C.
2. Rigid perovskite PVs
Perovskite PVs with rigid substrates or rigid perovskite PVs can be potentially used as windows or roofs in buildings, whereas perovskite PVs with flexible substrates or flexible perovskite PVs are promising as wallpapers35 or clothing36 to charge portable electronic devices. In order to meet different demands, we categorize perovskite PVs into rigid ones and flexible ones. Rigid perovskite PVs are then divided into inorganic and organic electron selective contacts.
2.1 Inorganic electron selective contacts
A wide spectrum of inorganic materials has been used as electron transport materials (ETMs) in perovskite PVs. TiO2 is a very common and effective ETM.37 Around 15% PCE was reported in perovskite PVs combining a very thin TiO2 ETM (20–40 nm) and a ∼350 nm TiO2 mesoporous layer (Fig. 2a and b).16 The efficiency was further improved to over 18% using hybrid perovskites (FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium) and MAPbBr3 at different ratios) and PTAA in place of spiro-OMeTAD in mesostructured solar cells.28 Later, a high quality FAPbI3 film was deposited by the direct intramolecular exchange process (IEP) of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide (FAI), which in combination with PTAA as HTM in a planar structure produced a PCE of over 20% (Fig. 3a and b).2 More recently, interface engineering of the TiO2 ETM was also reported to be effective in a MAPbI3 planar heterojunction configuration, leading to a PCE of ∼19.3%.22 Yet, it was reported that the TiO2 layer was substantially used not to transport electrons (mesoporous layer), but rather to block the direct contact between the hole transporter and the substrate (compact layer).38 In some reports, Al2O3 and ZrO2 electrical insulators have been proved as successful scaffolds in perovskite PVs with even better ultraviolet light stability.19,39

ZnO has been explored as an alternative electron selective contact to TiO2. Low temperature (∼60 °C) synthesized ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in solvents were spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer without further heating or annealing, achieving a PCE of 16.1% using NiO as a HTM,34 and 15.7% using spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM.40 Apart from nanoparticles, ZnO nanorods grown directly on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass were reported to be efficient photoanodes in perovskite PVs, demonstrating a PCE of 16.1%.41
2.2 Organic electron selective contacts
Fullerenes have been investigated as the standard ETMs in OPVs for many years owing to their strong electronegativity and high electron mobility.42,43 Among fullerene derivatives, (6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been the most popular electron collector.44 Enhanced electron extraction from the photoactive perovskite material to the PCBM was confirmed by the transient photoluminescence (PL), in which perovskite–PCBM hybrid films exhibited faster quenching as the PCBM ratio progressively increased.45 In the bulk heterojunction structured perovskite/PCBM device, the transient photovoltage measurement showed a notably longer carrier lifetime than those without PCBM, leading to a maximum PCE of 14.4%.45 Moreover, the fullerene layer deposited on the perovskite film can effectively passivate the trap states on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials, leading to hysteresis-free PSCs.30 Based on the inverted “p–i–n” planar heterojunction structure using PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as the HTM and ETM, respectively, a PCE as high as 18% was achieved on a MAPbI3−xClx hybrid perovskite film with millimeter-scale crystalline grains prepared from a solution-based hot-casting technique (Fig. 4a and b).31

3. Flexible perovskite PVs
Perovskite PVs fabricated on flexible substrates exhibit some advantages over their rigid counterparts, such as lightweight and bendable characteristics, suitable for roll-to-roll processing. Although inorganic electron transporters prepared at low temperatures have been reported,34,40,41 only a few of them employed flexible substrates.41 Here, we will focus on solution processed techniques, which can lead the perovskite PVs from lab devices into modules.46
Planar perovskite devices on ITO-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates using MAPbI3−xClx hybrid perovskite sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS and PCBM is an attractive design, exhibiting an initial PCE of 6.5%.47 Optimization of the film thickness of each layer in perovskite PVs led to an enhanced PCE of 9.2%.48 Flexible PSCs based on Al doped ZnO (AZO)/Ag/AZO coated PET foil were demonstrated with a PCE of 7% and a robust performance with a decline of 0.1% after 50 bending cycles.49 A much higher PCE of 12.7% was demonstrated adopting a simplified device structure: ITO (PET)/Cl-FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.26 It is surprising that flexible devices without any electron transport layer can perform so well, suggesting efficient transportation of photo-generated charges towards the contact electrode (ITO-PET) within the Cl-doped FAPbI3 layer. Highly dispersed Zn2SnO4 (ZSO) nanoparticles were introduced at low temperature into flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates coated with ITO to improve transmittance of the substrates, which led to a PCE of 14.85%.50 Besides the commercially available ITO on PET/PEN substrates, non-ITO conductive transparent flexible substrates were also reported in perovskite PVs. For instance, the use of a Ag-mesh (FEAM) embedded flexible PET substrate hybridized with PH1000 (a high-conductivity transparent conducting polymer, Clevios) for PSC design has led to an ultrathin flexible device that delivered a PCE of 14.0% with superior durability against mechanical bending over 5000 times.51
More recently, thin (3 μm) highly flexible PSCs were demonstrated by Kaltenbrunner et al.52 The device was composed of a transparent PET electrode of 1.5 μm treated with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to form pinhole-free MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films. Furthermore, a Cr2O3–Cr interlayer was used to protect the Au/Cu top contact from reactions with the perovskite layer, which enabled the devices to operate for days under normal environmental conditions at a stabilized PCE of 12%, a record power-per-weight of 23 W g−1. As shown in Fig. 5, these ultra-lightweight solar cells were successfully used to power a blimp and aviation model. This design may promote future applications of light-weight PVs on unmanned aerial vehicles for environmental and industrial monitoring, rescue and emergence response, and so forth.

4. Semi-transparent perovskite PVs
Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) have received a growing demand over the years. Conventional building envelopes, such as windows and skylights, could be replaced by semi-transparent PVs to provide an additional electricity supplement to the buildings as well as indoor temperature control.
4.1 Semi-transparent perovskite layers
A key factor in the preparation of semi-transparent PSCs is to reduce the film thickness of the perovskite layer. However, the uniformity and denseness of the perovskite film will deteriorate as the film becomes thinner. To solve this problem, a continuous perovskite film of ∼40 nm by the robust thermal evaporation method was designed, achieving a high PCE of 6.4% and a full device average visible transmittance (AVT) of 29%.53 Instead of using a continuous perovskite film, the use of a spontaneous dewetting method could also result in microstructured arrays of MAPbI3 perovskite “islands” that are discontinuous but large enough to allow unattenuated transmission of light between the islands and thick enough to absorb most of the visible light (Fig. 6a and c).54 Based on this discontinuous perovskite film, neutral colored PSCs were fabricated with AVTs tuneable from 7% to 30% and the PCE from 8% to 3.5%, relying on the surface coverage of perovskite islands.54

4.2 Semi-transparent top electrodes
Another factor that limits the development of semi-transparent devices is the employment of metal contact, such as Au, Ag, and Al. Due to their opacity, a thin layer of 10 nm or less was normally deposited for the sake of transmittance of devices. For instance, a novel semi-transparent electrode design was developed, combining a nickel mesh embedded PET film with a transparent conductive adhesive (TCA) that consisted of a mixture of PEDOT:PSS and an acrylic glue (Fig. 7a).55 This electrode was fabricated separately and was then pressure-laminated onto the photoanode at room temperature. An average PCE of 13.3% was demonstrated when illuminated from the FTO side and 9.8% from the Ni mesh side. The nickel mesh embedded PET electrodes were further applied into neutral-colored solar cells using FAPbI3 perovskite islands as a light absorber layer, achieving a high PCE of 5.2% with a full device AVT of 28% (Fig. 7b and c).56 Similarly, to avoid the usage of metal contact, a semi-transparent planar sandwich solar cell that was fabricated by simply laminating an FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/wet HTM with additives and PEDOT:PSS/ITO was also developed.57 It should be noted that as the device AVTs decreased from 17.3% to 6.3%, the corresponding PCE increased from 12.55% and 15.8%. In addition, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used as top electrodes by laminating free-standing films of a CNT network onto MAPbI3 substrates for the development of semi-transparent devices (Fig. 8a and b).58 In the absence of organic HTMs and metal contacts, MAPbI3 and CNTs formed a device with a PCE up to 6.87% illuminated from the FTO side and 3.88% from the CNT side. More recently, silver nanowire (Ag NW) colloidal solution was employed as the top electrode, a remarkably high full device AVT of 46% was achieved with a PCE of 3.55%.59 Other examples of using Ag NWs or graphene have been reported later.60

4.3 Photovoltachromic device-another BIPVs concept
As one of the most promising device concepts for BIPVs, photovoltachromic (PVCC) devices that combine photovoltaic and electrochromic behaviours, enabling adjustable transparency glazing with the coloration process powered by the photovoltaic component have been investigated.61 The device structure is illustrated in Fig. 9. The perovskite-based PVCC was fabricated by laminating two glass electrodes (one was a FTO glass with a secondary ITO conductive layer deposited by electron beam deposition, which was used as the substrate in semi-transparent PSCs; the other electrode was a WO3 coated ITO glass, on top of which was spread a small amount of lithium iodide containing solid polymer electrolyte) by using mechanical pressure in a mild vacuum environment. Two external circuits connected the photoanode of a PSC to the electrochromic electrode (A) and the gold cathode to the secondary electrode (the ITO side of the FTO substrate) of the electrochromic device (B). When the PVCC was illuminated, the device was colored and without illumination, it returned to a neutral color, or the bleached condition. The semi-transparent PSC itself had a neutral color.54 It is important to note that these semitransparent solar cells were connected in parallel to provide a large photocurrent so that the coloring process could take place quickly. Upon activating the self-tinting, the device the AVT dropped to 8.4% with a PCE of 5.5%.

5. Tandem perovskite PVs
Integrating perovskite PVs with high efficient silicon solar cells or thin film solar cells that are of mature technology and under large-scale production is an extraordinarily attractive option, considering the sharp drop in prices of commercial solar modules and low profit margins, and the need for high capital intensity for building new solar factories has constricted the potential investment for new solar technologies. In this regard, an approach that involves upgrading the market-leading photovoltaics instead of displacing them would be the most promising pathway for perovskite PVs to enter the solar cell market.
Recently, experimental attempts have been made to mechanically stack crystalline silicon (c-Si) and perovskite sub-cells into 4-terminal tandem cells or to make monolithic perovskite/silicon or thin film tandem solar cells. Both methods require semi-transparent PSCs with suitable energy bandgaps in order to optimize harvesting of the solar spectrum. Technologies for making semi-transparent PSCs have been summarized in the previous section. Therefore, another thing is to adjust the bandgap of perovskite materials. Normally, the bottom cell made of silicon or copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) has a bandgap of ∼1.1 eV. According to some modeling study,62 the top cell should have a bandgap of 1.7–1.8 eV. As a result, light of a short wavelength or high energy will be utilized by the top cell while light of a long wavelength or low energy will be used by the bottom cell. When it comes to perovskite PVs, the most commonly used perovskite material is MAPbI3, which has a bandgap of ∼1.58 eV.63 More importantly, the bandgap of this material can be continuously tuned up to 2.25 eV by facile substitution of I with Br to form MAPb(I1−xBrx)3.64
5.1 Mechanically stacked tandem cells
Many studies have been conducted on mechanically stacked tandem cells because they have the advantage of manufacturing simplicity and ease of integration. In addition, a mechanically-stacked architecture has lower performance constraints over current-density-matching and the need for tunnel junctions whereas it enables optimization of the top and bottom cells separately. For example, in a mechanically stacked tandem solar cell, current matching between the top and bottom strings of cells could be realized by adjusting the relative top and bottom cell sizes.65 A schematic configuration of a mechanically-stacked tandem cell is given in Fig. 10a.66 In some studies, high-mobility hydrogenated indium oxide (In2O3:H) was used as the transparent rear electrode in a four-terminal perovskite/CIGS tandem cell, leading to a PCE of 20.5%. It is estimated that a PCE of 27.6% could be attained with the MAPbI3 cell as the top cell and c-Si cell as the bottom one.67 In a recent study, a highly efficient perovskite/silicon tandem cell with a PCE of 25.2% was reported, using FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 (with an optimized optical band gap of ∼1.74 eV) as the light harvester in the top sub-cell and a-Si:H/c-Si silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell with a standalone PCE of 19% as the bottom cell.68 To match the long working lifetime of silicon solar cells, McGehee's group developed a thermally and environmentally stable semi-transparent perovskite solar cell and used it in a mechanically stacked tandem configuration with a silicon bottom cell. It was found that the ITO-coated perovskite solar cells demonstrated great promise of stable and efficient single-junction perovskite and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.69

Furthermore, the use of the MAPbBr3 cell in a spectral splitting system boosted the performance of the single MAPbI3 cell by 11%, Si PERL (passivated emitter, rear locally diffused c-Si) cell by 3%, and multicrystalline screen-printed (SP) Si solar cell by 16%, resulting in tandem efficiencies of 13.4%, 23.4%, and 18.8%, respectively.70 The optical splitting system was further investigated using a wide gap amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells or MAPbI3 cells as the top cells and c-Si cells as bottom cells, achieving a PCE of 25% and 28%, respectively.71
5.2 Monolithic tandem cells
For monolithic tandem cells, the practical efficiency limit is higher than that of a mechanically-stacked tandem because the latter has more “transparent” electrodes in the stack that can absorb approximately 5–10% of the incident light per electrode. However, a monolithic tandem requires the engineering of a tunnel junction or recombination layer, the planarization of the surface of the bottom cell to build the perovskite cell, and photon management within the complicated dielectric stack. A successful demonstration of a monolithic or two-terminal tandem cell comprising perovskite and c-Si was realized by Mailoa et al.72 A highly n-doped a-Si:H was used as an intermediate tunnel recombination contact deposited on the diffused p-doped emitter of Si sub-cell. A semi-transparent PSC with Ag NWs as the metal contact was deposited on top of the diffused Si homojunction cell. The monolithic device presented a stabilized efficiency of 13.7% with a Voc of 1.56 V, which is lower than the four-terminal devices.72 Replacing the Si homojunction cell with a Si heterojunction cell (SHJ) as the bottom cell and integrating it with the semi-transparent perovskite sub-cell is one of the ways to improve the performance of monolithic devices as the SHJ cells hold a higher efficiency73,74 (Fig. 10b).
Perovskite/polymer monolithic hybrid tandem solar cells are also under investigation (Fig. 10c). In this configuration, the polymer light absorber that can extend to a long wavelength can be used in combination with MAPbI3 in the bottom and top cells, respectively.75 Under the same principle, perovskite/perovskite monolithic tandem solar cells are also being explored. An example is the MAPbBr3–MAPbI3 tandem solar cell. The top cell was composed of FTO/bl-TiO2/MAPbBr3/wet P3HT or PTAA and used as one electrode. The bottom cell was composed of PCBM/MAPbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO and used as the other electrode. Then the two electrodes were laminated via pressurizing with a double clip.76 Nevertheless, the resulting PCE of the tandem device was still lower than that of the reported standalone MAPbI3 solar cells.
6. Challenges and conclusion
Before seriously considering commercialization of perovskite solar cells, we have to acknowledge that the journey to making practical use of the perovskites is still at its very early stage, and two basic challenges are to be addressed before any high-flying practical application can be achieved.
6.1 Weak moisture tolerability
The instability of perovskite materials upon contact with a polar solvent, such as water has attracted broad attention. Material innovation has been demonstrated to be effective in addressing this challenge.77 Even though a detailed understanding of the degradation mechanism of lead perovskite remains an open debate,78 material design efforts have yielded progress in enhancing the stability of perovskite films. The 2D hybrid perovskite, [PEA]2[MA]2Pb3I10 (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3) has been reported to show no sign on degradation during exposure in an ambient atmosphere for over 40 days,79 which presents much better resistance to moisture than MAPbI3. In another study, SCN− anions are substituted for iodide ions in MAPbI3. The resulting perovskite material was observed to suffer from no significant degradation after exposure to air with a relative humidity of 95% for over four hours, whereas MAPbI3 films degraded in less than 1.5 hours. Solar cells based on this material exhibited a PCE of 8.3%, which was competitive to that of MAPbI3 based solar cells fabricated in the same procedure.80
6.2 Toxicity of lead-contained perovksite
The toxicity issue of lead is another open challenge in this research field.81 Some studies have been done on the investigation of tin-based perovskites, but they demonstrated a lower performance and a poorer stability than lead perovskites.82,83 Recently, a bismuth based hybrid perovskite, MA3Bi2I9, has been reported by Lyu et al.84 Although a low PCE was achieved by MA3Bi2I9, this material exhibits superior stability in air. By substituting MA+ with Cs+, Park and co-workers fabricated Cs2Bi2I9 perovskite based solar cells, increasing its performance to over 1% and exhibiting a robust stability in air.85 Chemical doping with electron-affinity elements to improve the carrier mobility in the bismuth based perovskite is considered to be a potential method to further improve its photovoltaic performance.
In summary, we classified perovskite solar cells into four types based on their configurations: rigid perovskite solar cells, flexible perovskite solar cells, semi-transparent perovskite solar cells, and tandem perovskite solar cells. It is highly believed that perovskite solar cells with a variety of configurations and designs will draw attention from different interests. By summarizing these newly developed designs, this review provides a road map for possible consideration of perovskite solar cells in realistic applications, which will evoke broad interests among researchers and industries.
