    , Accepted 31st October 2018First published on 7th November 2018AbstractRecently, there have been rapid advances in polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors (n-SMAs) due to their outstanding properties. Silicon, which is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, may endow small-molecule acceptors with unique properties, especially when it is incorporated into conjugated backbones. In this work, a narrow band gap n-SMA based on a dithienosilole (DTS) unit incorporating silicon bridging atom, named Si4TIC-F, was designed and synthesized. Si4TIC-F has a rigid, planar conjugated backbone, benefiting intermolecular stacking and charge transport. Pairing Si4TIC-F with a wide band gap copolymer, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-N-(2-hexyldecyl)-5′5-bis[3-(decylthio)thiophene-2-yl]-2′2-bithiophene-3′3-dicarboximide] (PBTIBDTT), achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.2%. The PCE is much better than those of other systems with DTS-based acceptors. Our results demonstrate the potential of the classical DTS unit in constructing new n-SMAs to realize high-performance nonfullerene PSCs, which will help advance the development of PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have advanced substantially due to the rapid development of nonfullerene acceptors, which has been a hot research topic in recent years.1–9 Among those nonfullerene acceptors, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small-molecule acceptors (n-SMAs) have attracted much attention because of their advantages, such as strong light absorption, tunable energy levels, excellent stability and easy accessibility.10–14 In general, A–D–A n-SMAs are composed of an electron-rich central core and two electron-deficient segments, such as 3,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) reported by Zhan and co-workers.15 This type of structure is suitable for charge transfer and manipulating the absorption spectra of the n-SMAs. Therefore, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 13% for single-junction binary non-fullerene PSCs have been realized via designing n-SMAs and proposing appropriate donor/acceptor combinations with matched energy levels and complementary absorption.16–20 Inspired by the improved performance, many efforts have been made to design electron-rich central cores to manipulate the molecular energy levels, absorption spectra and aggregation behavior of the acceptors, which is crucial for increasing the PCEs of nonfullerene PSCs further.
The majority of electron-rich donor cores with planar fused-ring structures are bridged by carbon atoms, including indacenodithiophene (IDT)13,21–24 and indacenodithieno[3,2b]thiophene (IDTT).25–29 Silicon, which is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, may endow molecules with unique properties if it is incorporated into the π-conjugated backbones as a bridging atom.30–35 Dithienosilole (DTS), which is a classical electron-donating building block constructed by fusing a bithiophene with one silicon atom, has been used extensively in D–A copolymers for high-performance PSCs.36–41 Compared with their carbon counterparts, polymers based on the DTS unit show some distinctive optoelectronic properties and aggregation behavior. On the one hand, the introduction of a silicon bridging atom can lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the molecule compared with its carbon analogue due to the interaction of the silicon σ*-orbital with the π*-orbital of the butadiene fragment.31,33,35 The low-lying LUMO energy levels produce molecules with high electron affinity. On the other hand, if silicon is used as a bridging atom bearing bulky alkyl groups, the longer C–Si bond would result in smaller steric hindrance in the conjugated molecule, which is beneficial for π–π stacking and charge transfer.42 Therefore, introducing a DTS unit containing a silicon bridging atom into n-SMAs may be an effective strategy for obtaining high-performance nonfullerene PSCs. Although several acceptors containing the DTS unit have been reported, the PCEs of the devices based on these systems are still low.43–47 Recently, Zhu and co-workers reported two DTS-based acceptors, NFDTS and NSDTSB, and the PCE was greatly improved to 9.60% when the acceptors were paired with a low band gap polymer, PTB7-Th.48 Compared with INCN-F, the INCN-2F electron-deficient group in NFDTS possesses stronger electron-withdrawing properties and can lower the LUMO energy level in NFDTS, which prevents a high open-circuit voltage from being obtained in PSCs. Furthermore, although an octyl side chain can endow n-SMAs with high solubility in common solvents, overly long side chains may reduce the absorption coefficient and restrain intermolecular π–π stacking of the n-SMA. To take advantage of the DTS unit fully, it is necessary to design new n-SMAs based on the DTS unit and find appropriate combinations to extend the application of the DTS unit in n-SMAs, and thus increase the PCEs of nonfullerene PSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a new narrow band gap n-SMA, Si4TIC-F, which consisted of a donor core Si4T unit and two electron-deficient INCN-F end groups, and possessed an extended π-conjugation backbone compared with the DTS unit. The Si4TIC-F film exhibited strong absorption in the 600–900 nm region with an absorption onset at 905 nm, corresponding a narrow optical band gap (Eg) of 1.37 eV. The rigid, planar conjugated backbone benefited the intermolecular π–π stacking and charge transport. Pairing Si4TIC-F with a wide band gap copolymer, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-N-(2-hexyldecyl)-5′5-bis[3-(decylthio)thiophene-2-yl]-2′2-bithiophene-3′3-dicarboximide] (PBTIBDTT, Mn = 44 kDa and PDI = 2.06),49 produced a device with a PCE of 10.20%, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 18.84 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 69.4%, after device optimization. The efficiency is among the highest values for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using DTS-based acceptors.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic route for Si4TIC-F is shown in Scheme 1. The building block of 3,6-dibromo-2,5-bis(3-bromothien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (compound 1) was prepared according to a reported method.50 The donor core of compound 2 was obtained by direct lithiation of compound 1 with n-butyllithium at −78 °C, followed by the addition of dichlorodi-n-hexylsilane, which is different from the reported method.51 The subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of compound 2 yielded compound 3 as a shiny red solid. Finally, the target product, Si4TIC-F, was obtained as a dark red solid by conducting a Knoevenagel condensation between compound 3 and INCN-F. More information about the synthesis and characterization, including NMR (1H, 13C) and mass spectrometry data, is given in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S7). Si4TIC-F was readily soluble in most common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene (CB) at room temperature. The decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis was 393 °C under an inert atmosphere, indicating its good thermal stability (Fig. S8a, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties

PBTIBDTT, was selected as polymer donor due to its appropriate energy level and complementary absorption when paired with Si4TIC-F.
The molecular structures of PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F are shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra of Si4TIC-F film and Si4TIC-F in CB solution and are shown in Fig. 1b. Si4TIC-F in CB solution exhibited a maximum absorption at λ = 733 nm with a high absorption coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In the solid state, Si4TIC-F showed a strong, broad absorption in the wavelength range of 600–900 nm, which is beneficial for utilizing near-infrared photons. In addition, a large bathochromic shift of 90 nm from solution to film indicated the formation of an ordered structure and strong π−π stacking interactions between the conjugated skeletons. The optical band gap (Eg) calculated from the absorption onset (ca. 905 nm) in the film state was 1.37 eV. The small Eg value indicated that Si4TIC-F could be used in semitransparent PSCs and tandem solar cells. The combination of Si4TIC-F and PBTIBDTT provided wide coverage of the solar spectrum due to their complementary absorption spectra.

The frontier orbital energy levels of Si4TIC-F and PBTIBDTT in the thin film were also estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements calibrated with ferrocene (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The onsets of the oxidation potentials of PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F were at 1.09 and 1.20 V, respectively. According to the equation EHOMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox) eV, where Eonsetox is the onset oxidation potential versus Ag/Ag+, the HOMO energy levels of PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F were calculated to be −5.47 and −5.58 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F were calculated to be −3.60 and −4.21 eV, respectively, according to the CV results and the optical band gaps. The LUMO energy offset between PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F was 0.61 eV, which was sufficient to ensure the efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor. However, the HOMO energy offset was only 0.11 eV, which is much smaller than that generally accepted as the empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV for effective exciton dissociation. Interestingly, the hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor also seemed to be highly efficient, as indicated by the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) values. The small HOMO energy offset (ΔEHOMO) between PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F would help to produce PSCs with small Eloss. The energy levels and molecular structure were also calculated by using density functional theory calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. The hexyl chains were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculations. The views of the optimized geometry and the molecular orbital surfaces are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The LUMO is distributed over the entire π-system and the HOMO is mainly distributed on the Si4T unit. The side view of the optimized geometry shows that Si4TIC-F has a rigid, planar conjugated backbone, which favors intermolecular π–π stacking and charge transport.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of Si4TIC-F, bulk heterojunction PSCs with the conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBTIBDTT:Si4TIC-F/N,N′-bis(propylenedimethylamine)3,4,9,10-perylenediimide (PDIN)/Al were fabricated. The PBTIBDTT/Si4TIC-F blend films were spin-coated from CB solution, with an active layer thickness of ca. 130 nm. The ratio of polymer to n-SMAs and the solvent additive content of the active layers were systematically optimized to maximize the device efficiencies. The optimization process is detailed in ESI† and the corresponding parameters are collected in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). The optimal weight ratio of PBTIBDTT to Si4TIC-F was determined as 1:1.5. The PBTIBDTT:Si4TIC-F device (1:1.5, w/w) showed a moderate PCE of 7.59% with Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 16.32 mA cm−2, and FF of 58.8% without post-treatment. The relatively low FF was mainly caused by the unoptimized morphology of the blend film. To increase the PCEs of the PBTIBDTT:Si4TIC-F devices further, a widely used solvent additive, 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), was used to optimize the device performance. The effect of the 1-CN content on the device performance was also systematically examined by adding 0.3%, 0.5%, and 1.0% (v/v) 1-CN to the solution. A greatly improved PCE of 10.20%, a high Jsc of 18.84 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V and a FF of 69.4% were finally achieved using 0.5% 1-CN (v/v) as a solvent additive. The typical J–V curves and corresponding EQE profiles are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The EQE curves showed a broad photocurrent response in the range of 300–900 nm for the device, which was attributed to the complementary absorption of PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F. For the device processed without 1-CN, the EQE values were low over the whole photocurrent response range. After adding 0.5% 1-CN (v/v), the EQE values were increased over the whole photocurrent response range from 300–920 nm and reached the maximum value of 68% at λ = 670 nm. Furthermore, the photocurrent response range was extended slightly from 900 to 920 nm compared with the device processed without 1-CN. For the blend film processed with 1-CN, the normalized absorption peak in the range of 700–900 nm attributed to SNIC-F exhibited increased absorption intensity and a large redshift of ca. 20 nm, which was consistent with the extended EQE profiles (Fig. 2c). This result indicated that 1-CN promoted the aggregation of Si4TIC-F and enhanced the π–π interactions of Si4TIC-F in the blend films. The current density values calculated from the EQE spectra were 18.84 and 16.07 mA cm−2 for the devices with and without 1-CN as the solvent additive, respectively, which matched the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves within 5% deviation. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the devices based on PBTIBDTT:Si4TIC-F were also plotted to study the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties in the devices (Fig. 2d). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under light and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is equal to zero, and Va is the applied bias voltage. The Jph values for both devices were saturated (Jsat) at Veff ∼ 2 V, and the saturation current densities (Jsat) were 17.20 and 19.50 mA cm−2, respectively. The lower Jsat value for the device processed without 1-CN indicated reduced charge generation properties in the device, which may result from the inferior morphology of the active layer. The exciton dissociation probability in these devices was also evaluated based on the charge dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), which were determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat). Pdiss under short-circuit conditions was calculated to be 94.9% for the device processed without 1-CN, which was much lower than that of the device processed with 1-CN as the solvent additive (96.6%). This result indicated that the devices treated with 1-CN showed higher exciton dissociation and more effective charge collection compared with those with no post-treatment, which supported its superior performance.

PL quenching experiments
The PL quenching experiments were performed to understand the charge transfer behavior in the blend films. Fig. 3a shows the PL spectra of pure PBTIBDTT and the blend films processed with and without 1-CN under excitation at 500 nm. The emission spectrum of the pure PBTIBDTT film displayed a strong, broad peak in the range of 600–800 nm. For both the blend films, the PL peaks of PBTIBDTT were strongly quenched, indicating the efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor. The PL spectrum of pure Si4TIC-F and the blend films under excitation at 694 nm were also examined to assess the charge transfer from acceptor to donor (Fig. 3b). Pure Si4TIC-F exhibited an intense emission peak in the region of 800–1250 nm, which was quenched in the blend films processed without and with 1-CN as a solvent additive. This result demonstrated the efficient charge transfer from Si4TIC-F to PBTIBDTT, although the difference between the HOMOs was much lower than the generally accepted empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV. In addition, the emission intensities of both PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F in the blend films processed with 1-CN were slightly higher than the film processed without 1-CN, indicating that 1-CN induced the phase separation.

Charge transport properties
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the devices were studied via the space charge limited current method, using a hole- or electron-only device with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDIN/Al, respectively, to evaluate the charge transport properties of the blend films (Fig. 4). The electron mobility of Si4TIC-F was examined (Fig. S10, ESI†), and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The electron mobility of the pure Si4TIC-F film was 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas in the blend film processed without 1-CN, the electron mobility was reduced to 1.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is probably because the crystallinity of Si4TIC-F was suppressed by PBTIBDTT, which prevents charge transport in the vertical direction. Given that Jsc and FF are heavily dependent on the charge transport properties, inferior electron mobility can partially explain the low PCE of the device processed without 1-CN. Furthermore, the hole mobility of the as-cast films was 2.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. When 1-CN was used as a solvent additive, the electron mobility and hole mobility values of the blend film were increased considerably to 1.23 × 10−4 and 2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved, more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.6) decreased carrier recombination, thereby improving Jsc and FF.

Crystallinity
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to explore the crystalline structure of the pure films and the blend films processed with and without 1-CN. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line profiles of the blend films are shown in Fig. 5. The pure Si4TIC-F and PBTIBDTT films were also characterized to attribute the diffraction peaks (Fig. S11, ESI†). The pure Si4TIC-F film was highly disordered, with strong diffraction signals. For the pure PBTIBDTT film, a (100) lamellar diffraction peak at qz ≈ 2.73 nm−1 [d(100) = 2.30 nm] and a (010) π–π stacking peak at qz ≈ 17.50 nm−1 [d(010) = 0.36 nm] were observed. In the blend films processed without 1-CN, both the low- and high-q regions were dominated by PBTIBDTT diffraction peaks. There was no Si4TIC-F diffraction peak in the as-cast film in either the out-of-plane (OOP) or in-plane (IP) direction, implying that the crystallinity of the acceptor Si4TIC-F in the film was low. This result suggested that the crystallinity of Si4TIC-F was disturbed by PBTIBDTT in the blend films. The low crystallinity of Si4TIC-F contributed to the poor electron mobility, which led to the poor device performance. Adding 0.5% 1-CN produced a much stronger diffraction peak for π–π stacking at qz ≈ 17.76 nm−1 [d(010) = 0.35 nm], to which both PBTIBDTT and Si4TIC-F contributed because their π–π stacking diffraction peaks were close together. Furthermore, in the low-q region, one diffraction peak located at qz ≈ 7.21 nm−1 in the OOP direction and two diffraction peaks at qz ≈ 3.72 and 6.98 nm−1 in the IP direction, which were related to the Si4TIC-F peaks, were observed, indicating that the crystallinity of Si4TIC-F was improved substantially by 1-CN. These results demonstrated that closer molecule packing for both the donor and acceptor was achieved by introducing 1-CN, which agreed well with the improved mobilities and partially explained the increased Jsc and FF and high PCE.

Morphology
To understand the morphological differences in the blend films processed with and without 1-CN, the blend films were examined by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the effect of 1-CN on the photovoltaic performance further. The blend film of PBTIBDTT/Si4TIC-F processed without 1-CN had a relatively smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.10 nm (Fig. 6). With 0.5% 1-CN, the RMS roughness increased to 5.76 nm. More importantly, the TEM images showed a clearer nanofiber structure in the blend film processed with 1-CN, suggesting that 1-CN improved the crystallinity of the donor and acceptor, which was consistent with the PL and GIXD results. The improved crystallinity and phase separation increased the electron and hole mobility, and thus improved the FF and PCE.

Conclusions
A new A–D–A n-SMA based on DTS units incorporating a silicon bridging atom, Si4TIC-F, was designed and synthesized. Si4TIC-F exhibited a rigid, planar conjugated backbone, resulting in a high electron mobility of 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It showed strong absorption across the wavelength range of 600–900 nm with a small optical band gap of 1.37 eV. Therefore, a wide band gap polymer, PBTIBDTT, which possessed complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels, was selected as the donor material. The device based on PBTIBDTT/Si4TIC-F showed a moderate PCE of 7.59% with no treatment. By using 1-CN to optimize the active layer, a high PCE of 10.20% was achieved, which is the highest PCE reported for a DTS-based acceptor. Our results demonstrate the potential of the classical DTS unit in constructing new n-SMAs to realize high-performance non-fullerene PSCs, which will advance the development of PSCs.
