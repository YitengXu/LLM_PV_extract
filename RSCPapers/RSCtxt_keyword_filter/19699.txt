, Accepted 6th May 2014First published on 7th May 2014AbstractWe report a solar-assisted microbial fuel cell (solar MFC) that can produce electricity through coupling a microbial anode with flower-like CuInS2 (CIS) as the photocathode. Scanning electron microscopy images displayed a hierarchical structure of CIS, which would be beneficial to facilitate electron transfer in MFC. The electrochemical and photo-responsive activity of CIS was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and photocurrent tests. We propose a hypothesized mechanism of MFC operation that light-responsive CIS generated electron–hole pairs and triggered bioanodes for electricity generation. LSV curves and photocurrent data displayed the flower-like CIS and showed enhanced photocurrent generation under visible light irradiation. Based on the improved photoelectrochemical properties, the solar MFC achieved a maximum power density of 0.108 mW cm−2 and a current density of 0.62 mA cm−2. CIS as a photocathode presents a comparable power density to Pt/C in MFC.
1. Introduction
The development of new energy solutions with a minimum impact on the environment is critical as the supply of fossil fuels has decreased and environmental problems have intensified in recent years. In this regard, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) hold great potential to address both issues simultaneously by converting chemical energy stored in biodegradable organic matter directly into electricity energy.1–4 However, at present, wide application of this technology is not straightforward because it involves a costly and energy-consuming process.5 Cathode limitation is currently considered as the major limiting factor to reduce device cost and achieve high electricity output.6,7 Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the MFC design of cathodes and catalysts to deal with the poor oxygen reduction rate during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),8 or the high internal resistance of cathode materials,9 and the high cathodic overpotential.10,11 There are many reports on cathode materials, such as platinum (Pt)-loaded carbon cloth or carbon paper,12–14 conductive polymer-coated stainless steel mesh,15 nanostructured MnOX-electrodeposited carbon paper16 and multi-walled carbon nanotube composite-modified carbon cloth.17
In addition to electrochemical methods, efficient electricity generation can also be achieved by incorporating an external required source such as solar energy to facilitate electron transfer with an extra driven force.18 This has led to the development of photocathodes employing semiconductors, which assist cathodic electrocatalytic reactions in the reaction process. With respect to photocatalytic reactions, electron–hole pairs are generated at a semiconductor upon photoirradiation and then the photogenerated holes in the valance band (VB) are transferred to a catalytically active site for redox reactions, while the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) are delivered from the anode to reduce electron acceptors on the surface of cathode.19 So far, several semiconductors have been used for cathodic catalysis in MFCs. Among these, TiO2 (ref. 19 and 20) and Cu2O (ref. 21 and 22) have been used as an efficient photoelectrocatalyst in the cathode reaction. However, because of a relatively wide bandgap, TiO2 suffers from lower quantum efficiency and photocatalytic performance. Cu2O suffers from poor stability due to photocorrosion.23 Therefore, designing a cost-effective and sustainable cathode material is crucial and urgent for the development and scale-up of MFCs.
Recent photoelectrochemical application has tended towards ternary chalcopyrite CuME2 (M = Ga, In; E = S, Se, Te)-type semiconductors, which are considered as potentially less toxic materials. Among the numerous CuME2 compounds, CuInS2 (CIS) has been well studied because of its suitable bandgap for light-harvesting applications. Therefore, CIS with different morphology has presented excellent light absorption properties in solar cells,24,25 for photocatalysis of hydrogen generation,26 and in the optical detection of biological molecules.27,28 Based on the above advantages, CIS could be capable of solar energy conversion in the cathode reaction of MFCs.
Developing a well-controlled morphology of the photocatalysts may furnish us with a promising way for improving cathode performance. Hierarchical-structured porous materials would provide the dispersion of active sites and allow easy transmission of light, and have been included in newly developed energy storage and conversion systems.18,29 Among many types of hierarchically structured materials, flower-like materials have proven to be favorable to the entry of visible light and to enhance light scattering.30,31 Inspired by previous work, herein we design dual-chamber MFCs equipped with a flower-like CIS photocathode.
In this study, we investigated photocatalysis on the cathode reaction by using a flower-like CIS photocathode as an alternative catalyst, comparing it with Pt. Furthermore, it has been reported that CIS displayed light-harvesting properties in the visible-light region,26 indicating the feasibility of CIS for visible-light-activated photocatalytic applications. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and photocurrent tests were employed to confirm the photoelectrochemical properties of CIS, while cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the energy levels in solar-assisted MFC (solar MFC). Based on the process of electron transfer, we proposed hypothesized mechanisms of solar-assisted electron transfer by the flower-like CIS cathode.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reagents and materials
Cuprous chloride (CuCl), indium chloride (InCl3·4H2O), sublimed sulfur and triethylene glycol used in this study were of analytical grade and supplied by Shanghai Chemical Corp. All reagents were used without any purification. Ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm) was used for all experiments.
2.2. Preparation of CuInS2
In a typical synthesis, 1.0 mmol CuCl, 1.0 mmol InCl3·4H2O, and 2.5 mmol sublimed sulfur powders were dispersed in 30 mL of triethylene glycol under stirring and then ultrasonicated for 30 min to form a yellow-green suspension. Afterwards, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the final dark products were collected by centrifuging the mixture, washed with absolute ethanol and distilled water several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight for further use.
2.3. Ink and electrode preparation for CuInS2 photocathode
Catalyst ink formulation used in the MFC tests was made as follows: 20 mg of CIS powder was dispersed in 20 mL of a solvent mixture of Nafion (5 wt%) and anhydrous ethanol (1:9, v/v) for 1 h under sonication.32,33 In the comparison experiment, a commercially available catalyst of 20 wt% Pt/C powder was used to prepare a 1 mg mL−1 Pt/C suspension by following the same procedure as that detailed above.
For MFC cathode fabrication, the inks were spun onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with an active area of 4 cm2, and the catalyst loading on the FTO substrate was 1 mg cm−2.
2.4. MFC construction and operation
All MFC tests were conducted using a dual-chamber MFC. For the anodic chamber, we used Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (ATCC 70050) as the biocatalyst.34 Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was grown in 100 mL of Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) under aerobic conditions at 30 °C for 36 h and then centrifuged and resuspended in 1 L of a nutrient medium35,36 previously purged with nitrogen gas to eliminate oxygen. Lactate (0.02 M) and fumarate (0.1 M) were added to the medium as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. After anaerobic incubation at 30 °C for 48 h, the cells were harvested again by centrifugation and resuspended in the chamber under anoxic conditions.37 The anode chamber was filled with enriched Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells, carbon granules (1–3 mm in diameter), and a nutrient medium containing lactate (0.02 M).
For the MFC set-up, the FTO coated with CIS was used as the cathode (surface area of 4 cm2). Meanwhile, the catholyte in the cathode chamber was a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (0.1 M, pH 7.0). In order to maintain oxygen for the electrochemical reaction, oxygen was purged into the cathode compartment. MFC experiments were carried out in batch mode and configured as a dual-chambered MFC model, which was composed of the cathode and anode chamber pressed together with a net volume of 200 mL. The two compartments were separated by a Nafion 117 membrane 3 cm in diameter. Stainless steel wire and some copper wires were used to connect the circuit. All experiments were performed at room temperature.
2.5. Electrochemical analysis and data acquisition
Photocurrent measurements of CIS were employed using a three-electrode configuration with CIS/FTO or FTO as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and a platinum wire serving as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrode potential and current were controlled by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C, Chenhua Instrument Co., China). A xenon lamp (50 mW cm−2) was used for light irradiation with a filter (λ ≥ 400 nm), and the electrolyte was a PBS solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0). In addition, LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark or under xenon light illumination with the same three-electrode system. In addition, CV measurements were performed to estimate the oxidation and reduction potential at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate dissolved in acetonitrile (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Power density (P = IV/A) for MFCs was measured by a SourceMeter (2400 Keithley, Cleveland, OH), according to the measured voltage (V), current (I = V/R), and surface area of the photoelectrode (A). The maximum power output was determined by the polarization and power density curves.
2.6. Sample characterization
The crystal structure of the sample was investigated by a wide-angle (10–80°, 40 kV per 200 mA) powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement with a polycrystalline X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU, D/MAX 2550 VB/PC, λ = 1.5406 Å). Elemental composition was characterized by energy-dispersive spectra (EDS) with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (Falion 60S) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) using an analyzer (IRIS 1000). The morphology of the CIS/FTO cathode was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a HITACHI S-4800F microscope. An optical microscope (BX51-OOLYMPUS) was used to observe the growth state of microorganisms.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of CuInS2
The structure characterization of the CIS microspheres formed on the FTO substrate was conducted by XRD (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a presents the pattern of CIS immobilized on the FTO substrate (noted as CIS/FTO); the patterns of FTO (Fig. 1b) and CIS (Fig. 1c) are also illustrated in the figure for comparison. In the XRD pattern of Fig. 1c, the peaks at 27.8°, 32.2°, 46.3°, 55.0° and 74.7° can be indexed to (112), (004), (204)/(220), (116)/(312) and (316) crystal planes of chalcopyrite CIS (JCPDS card no. 85-1575), respectively. The FTO substrate shows three typical diffraction peaks at 26.5°, 38° and 51.5°, respectively, which are typical X-ray diffraction peaks of FTO, and this corresponds to the previous report.38 The results suggest that pure CIS was obtained by employing the solvothermal method.

The morphology of the CIS microspheres was examined by SEM (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A displays a panoramic image of CIS, revealing that the sample consists of spherical flower-like hierarchical architectures with an average diameter of about 3 μm. Fig. 2B exhibits the high-magnification SEM image of CIS hierarchical microsphere. It can be noted that flower-like microspheres are built by many interleaving packed two-dimensional flakes. The mechanism for the formation of CIS was proposed as follow: the involved CuS microspheres form in situ and then act as self-sacrificed templates, resulting in flower-like CIS.26 The hierarchically porous structure enabled CIS microspheres with the ability to enhance light harvesting, which makes CIS an effective photocatalyst for solar-assisted applications.18,26,29

According to EDS and ICP-AES measurements, we obtained information about the elemental compositions of as-synthesized flower-like CIS microspheres. Fig. 3 shows a typical EDS spectrum, which confirms the existence of Cu, In and S elements in the as-prepared CIS sample. The elemental compositions of as-prepared CIS were also determined by EDS and ICP-AES, and the results are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the stoichiometric composition in the EDS spectrum results in a Cu:In:S ratio of 1:1.14:2.16, whereas ICP-AES measurements give a Cu:In:S ratio of 1:1.05:1.94. The two methods displayed consistent results with the components.

3.2. Electrochemical property of CuInS2
To confirm the mechanism of electron transfer between the bioanode and photocathode, we measured the redox potential of CIS using its CV electrochemical behavior, which has been proven to be an effective method for the determination of energy levels. From CV spectra, the band-edge positions (i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy position) can be determined. Oxidation potential was correlated with the ionization potential (Ip) and reduction potential with electron affinity (Ea), allowing the band edge positions of electroactive materials to be calculated.39 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be derived from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and onset reduction potential (Ered), respectively, according to equations below:40 
EHOMO = −Ip = −(Eox + 4.72) eV
(1) 
ELUMO = −Ea = −(Ered + 4.72) eV
(2)where the onset of potential values are relative to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The value of 4.72 represents the vacuum level potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (i.e., 0 V vs. NHE ≈ 4.5 eV vs. vacuum) and the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode versus NHE (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl ≈ 0.22 V vs. NHE).40
Fig. 4 exhibited an oxidation onset of CIS at ca. 1.07 V and a reduction onset at ca. −0.76 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, which were measured based on the previous report.36 According to eqn (1) and (2), the HOMO and LUMO levels of CIS can be calculated as −5.8 eV and −4.0 eV, respectively. The oxidation and reduction potentials of CIS vs. NHE can be calculated as 1.29 V and −0.54 V, respectively. The VB of a semiconductor corresponds to the HOMO energy level (oxidation onset), while CB corresponds to the LUMO level (reduction onset). To receive microbial electrons, the semiconductor should have a VB edge more positive than the electrochemical potentials of the bacterial outer membrane c-type cytochrome (Omc) proteins (e.g., −0.1 V vs. NHE has been reported for Shewanella cells).41 To reduce protons generated at the bioanode, the semiconductor should have a CB edge more negative than ORR at neutral pH (0.82 V vs. NHE).18 According to the above principles of electron transfer, the energy positions of CIS could be beneficial for ORR in solar MFCs. The details of energy levels would be displayed in the description of the scheme of solar MFC.

3.3. Hypothesized mechanisms of photocatalytic electron transfer
In an MFC, the cathode carries the electrocatalyst for facilitating the transfer of electrons generated from the anode to the electron acceptor in the electrolyte, thus achieving the electrical circuit. In the dark, CIS catalyst is presumed to be similar to other catalysts such as Pt. However, upon light illumination, electron–hole separation is obtained at the surface of the CIS cathode. The photogenerated electrons from the CB of CIS (ecb−) can reduce the electron acceptors in the electrolyte (such as dissolved O2) at the cathode–electrolyte interface, while the photogenerated holes in the VB (hvb+) recombine with the electrons generated at the bioanode to form the electric circuit.19 In this study, the dual chamber MFC equipped with the flower-like CIS photocathode shows improved performance over the plain cathode MFC, implying the significance of the light-assistant effect of light-responsive semiconductors on MFC systems. Owing to the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of CIS under visible light irradiation, the electrons generated by bacteria on the anode might be driven by the photogenerated holes to transfer more efficiently to the cathode, where the oxygen reduction reaction occurs.21 The whole process could be depicted by the equations below and summarized in Scheme 1.

3.4. Photoresponse of CuInS2
To evaluate the mechanism of the solar-assisted CIS cathode, we collected LSV curves and amperometric I–t plots with a light illumination of 50 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5). Fig. 5A showed LSV curves recorded from CIS/FTO and FTO for comparison. The dark scan of CIS/FTO (black solid line) led to a small current density at 0.1 mA, while under illumination the CIS/FTO exhibited a photocurrent density of up to 0.25 mA (red solid line) at a bias of −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent suggested efficient light absorption of CIS and charge separation at the semiconductor/catholyte interface.21 The inset of Fig. 5A shows the magnified photocurrent of FTO substrates under dark and light irradiation. From the inset of Fig. 5A, it can be seen that the photocurrent of the FTO substrate under light condition is about 0.03 mA, which is slightly higher than that in dark. The amperometric I–t curve (Fig. 5B) collected at an appropriate voltage of −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl with light on–off cycles showed that the CIS photocathode had reproducible photocurrent generation in response to a light illumination of 50 mW cm−2 (curve b). Taken together, the LSV curves and photocurrent data demonstrated that photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be driven by solar light, which indicates that CIS could be beneficial for electron transfer with improved electricity generation.

3.5. MFC performance of CuInS2 photocathode
Fig. 6A displays the Shewanella cells firmly attached to graphite particles. Polarization tests were investigated to evaluate the utility of CIS as a photocathode in MFC. Fig. 6B presents the polarization curves and power density of MFCs. Table 2 summarizes the main parameters obtained from MFC tests. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, these were (1) a MFC using a CIS photocathode at a solar light illumination of 50 mW cm−2 (red solid line); (2) a MFC using a plain FTO photocathode (black solid line); (3) Pt/C as a cathode in MFC (blue solid line). An open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.53 V and short-circuit current density (Isc) of 0.62 mA cm−2 were achieved for the CIS photocathode, while those of 0.46 V and 0.33 mA cm−2 correspond to the bare FTO, respectively. Equipped with the CIS photocathode, the MFC device exhibited a maximum power density (Pmax) of 0.108 mW cm−2, which was two times higher than the plain FTO (0.047 mW cm−2). For comparison, the Pt/C cathode (Isc = 0.72 mA cm−2 and Pmax = 0.123 mW cm−2) was slightly higher than the CIS as the photocathode. These results suggested that flower-like CIS used as the photocathode can be as efficient and comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the curves in Fig. 5C display the performance of MFC with light switching on–off. It can be observed that the current density of CIS/FTO in light (red solid line) presented a significant increase over CIS/FTO in the dark (black solid line). The enhancement confirmed that electron–hole pair separation at the photocathode of CIS was facilitated to release the holes for electrons from the bioanode, at the same time as electrons for the ORR in the cathode, thus improving the electricity generation of MFC. According to the above results, CIS used as the photocathode presents good power density comparable with Pt/C in MFC. This could be attributed to the fabricated CIS sample with flower flakes, and monodispersity may be beneficial to electron transfer under irradiation and thus exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity. Based on the great advantage of the hierarchical architecture, MFCs containing CIS or another semiconductor-coated cathode may offer an effective option for simultaneous electricity production.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the flower-like CIS microspheres could be used as a cathode material for solar MFCs. The hierarchical structure makes CIS as an effective photocatalyst for solar-assisted applications. The flower-like CIS shows enhanced photocurrent generation under visible light irradiation and reveals that CIS could be beneficial for electron transfer and offer enhanced electricity production. The polarization curve and power density tests confirm its feasibility with CIS as a photocathode. The current density, open circuit voltage and maximum power density of up to 0.62 mA cm−2, 0.53 V and 0.108 mW cm−2, respectively, have been achieved in a simple MFC device without any chemical surface modification. The power density is close to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Based on this study, further and systematic investigations are required to fully exploit the potential of this class of photocathode materials.
