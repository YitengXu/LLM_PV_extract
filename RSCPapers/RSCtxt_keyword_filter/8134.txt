, Accepted 20th August 2013First published on 27th August 2013AbstractTandem cells (or multi-junction cells) have been shown to be the most efficient architecture to achieve record performance for most photovoltaic technologies. In fact, tandem architectures allow devices to significantly broaden their overall absorbance spectra providing higher conversion efficiencies compared to individual cells. However, up to now, this has not been true for DSCs where record performances have been always obtained with single cells. This is mainly due to the difficulty of realizing integrated tandem DSC configurations where interlayer losses are minimized. Thus, we propose a new tandem architecture that overcomes the limitation presented so far by tandem DSCs, reporting an efficiency of 6.66% with wide room for improvement. Experimental results are corroborated with two-dimensional device simulations which allow us to understand the working mechanisms and to define optimization routes for this novel architecture. This work opens the way for further optimization of DSC technology, well beyond the actual limits, and also discloses ideas for new possible structures in the related fields of TiO2 tandem catalysts which are important for the realization of solar fuels and electrolyte based devices.
Introduction
Dye Solar Cells (DSCs) represent a very promising photovoltaic technology able to reach power conversion efficiencies of 11.4%.1,2 Fine tuning of the dye absorption properties and the electron diffusion length in the wide-gap TiO2 semiconducting material, imposes an optimum thickness of a few microns for the active layer. However, part of the power spectrum of incident light is lost due to limitations in the amount of dye loading and to the relatively narrow absorption spectra of the dyes. In order to increase light harvesting, several solutions have been proposed in the literature. Multisensitized DSCs3–7 utilize co-sensitization of the semiconductor but are limited by electron diffusion lengths which are typically of the order of tens of micrometers.8 An effective way to improve light harvesting in any photovoltaic devices is through the tandem architecture. This approach can be effectively used also for DSCs, where two cells with different dyes are electrically connected in series or in parallel.9–11 Such an approach has been very successfully used by Yanagida and coworkers9 reaching a power conversion efficiency of 10.6%. Conventional, non-integrated, Tandem Dye Solar Cell (T-DSC) is achieved by piling up two complete devices, a top and a bottom cell (Fig. 1a) and connecting them in a series or parallel configuration by an external circuit. In fact, the presence of a liquid electrolyte does not allow for a layer by layer deposition. The main drawback of this architecture is the presence of an intermediate supporting conductive glass between the active layers, which represents a reflecting/absorbing obstacle for the incoming light also adding unwanted bulk, weight and cost to the structure. A further problem, in the perspective of scaling up the device to fabricate modules and panels, is the external electrical connection between the cells and the additional series resistance introduced by the two intermediate TCOs (transparent conducting oxides). In order to overcome these issues, efforts were performed to fabricate Integrated Tandem DSCs (IT-DSCs). In these structures, the intermediate conductive glass (part of conventional T-DSCs) was removed, with noticeable advantages in terms of cost and weight of the device, feasibility of the scaling up process and, especially, minimising interlayer photon losses.

Bach et al. proposed the pn-DSC architecture12 where two dye-sensitized electrodes are integrated in the same cell: the n-type semiconductor (TiO2) anode and a p-type (NiO) photocathode. However, due to the poor properties of the p-material13 the overall performance of pn-DSC was quite low (2.49%).12 Another configuration was obtained by integrating in the cell a metallic mesh as a third hole-collecting floating electrode.14,15
In this paper we present an innovative architecture for a IT-DSC, (Fig. 1b) which shows a larger efficiency with respect to other IT-DSCs. This new IT-DSC (Fig. 1b) is composed by a top photoelectrode (TPE), fabricated in the same way as in conventional DSCs16 and a bottom photoelectrode (BPE) which is stacked over the Pt/TCO layer. The BPE is spatially and electrically separated from the counter-electrode (CE), thanks to an insulating porous spacer (ZrO2) that covers the CE and supports the BPE. An additional thin layer of porous aluminum is deposited between the BPE and the ZrO2 providing an electron collector for the photogenerated charge carriers and allowing electrical connection of the bottom photoelectrode with the external circuit. TPE and BPE are parallel connected by a vertical conductive contact.
The porosity of aluminum and ZrO2 is required to preserve the percolation of the electrolyte (Fig. 2) towards the platinum and to guarantee an effective dye regeneration.

By integrating the tandem cell, we have estimated, starting from transmission measurements, that the illumination reaching the bottom photoelectrode is about 40% higher in IT-DSCs than in T-DSCs. In fact, a conventional T-DSC (Fig. 1a) needs the intermediate layers (Pt/TCO/glass/TCO) in order to compose a four-electrode device (two PEs and two CEs). Differently, in the proposed architecture the presence of a ZrO2 porous spacer between the BPE and platinized cathode, allows to build on the same substrate a PE and a CE, realizing a three-electrode device (two PEs and one CE).
Experimental
Top electrode and bottom cell fabrication
For both the standard and the integrated DSC configurations, the top nano-crystalline titania layers (nc-TiO2) were prepared by screen printing a TiO2 paste (18NR-T from Dyesol) onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated 2 mm thick glass substrate (NSG TEC 8 Ω/□ from Pilkington). After 15 min drying at 80 °C, TiO2 films were sintered at 480 °C for 30 min. The film thickness was 6 μm measured with a surface profiler Dektak 150 from Veeco. The size of the top photoelectrode (TPE) was set to be 5 mm × 5 mm (0.25 cm2 area). After calcination, the top photoelectrodes were immersed in a dye solution until saturation occurred. The dye used for the TPE was the cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium from Dyesol (N719 dye), in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution. After dyeing, the working electrodes were rinsed with absolute ethanol from Sigma-Aldrich to remove the dye excess before the assembling process. The bottom photoelectrode of standard T-DSC, was fabricated through identical steps.
Platinised counter electrodes (CEs) for the standard top and bottom devices were made by screen printing platinum Pt paste Ch01 from Chimet onto FTO coated glass substrates. The counter electrodes were fired at 420 °C for 15 min.
The same procedure was also used for the CE of the integrated device. An insulating layer was then deposited on the CE by blade coating a ZrO2 paste17,18 followed by a sintering at 480 °C for 30 minutes. The zirconia thickness was 10 μm. Aluminum (100 nm in thickness) was thermally evaporated on top of the ZrO2 layer in high vacuum (10−6 mbar) conditions at 1.1 Å s−1 to create the conductive porous layer. The thermal evaporator was located in a glove-box (N2 ambient). A shadow mask was used during the thermal evaporation in order to define the area of the bottom photoelectrode.
The aluminum conductive layer (≈10 Ω/□) was covered by a TiO2 compact film prepared by spray pyrolysis of titanium-isopropoxide solution in acetylacetone (Sigma-Aldrich) acting as a blocking layer.19 Finally, the titania layer was deposited by blade coating (Dyesol 18NR-T) onto the aluminum layer followed by sintering at 480 °C for 30 minutes. Bottom photoelectrode area was the same as top photoelectrode. After calcination, the bottom photoelectrode was immersed in the dye solution and treated similarly as the TPEs. The dye used for the bottom photoelectrode was [(C4H9)4N]3[Ru-(Htcterpy)(NCS)3] (tcterpy = 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′,2′′-terpyridine) (black dye) in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution.
The two electrodes were finally sealed with a hot-melt 60 micron thick Surlyn thermoplastic gasket (Dupont 1702) taking care of the overlapping of the two active areas. Commercial iodine-based electrolyte HSE from Dyesol was injected by vacuum backfilling process through a hole in the Surlyn gasket which was then sealed by an UV curable glue. Similarly was done for the top and bottom standard cells.
In case of the integrated tandem device, the external electrical parallel connection between the top FTO and the aluminum layer was realized by a silver paste from Dupont.
Electrical measurements
Current–voltage I–V characteristics were performed through a Keithley 2420 Source Meter under AM1.5 G solar simulator SolarTest 1200 from KHS at 1000 W m−2 (1 sun), calibrated with a Skye SKS 1110 sensor. EQE measurements were acquired using a Newport Model 70612 with a 150 W Xe OF lamp coupled with a Cornerstone 130 monochromator 1/8 m and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Measurements were acquired in DC mode without bias illumination and measured in the range 300–800 nm (wavelength steps = 5 nm) at short circuit conditions. A silicon photodiode was used for the calibration.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with bias light intensity steps (0.08–1 sun equivalent) at constant temperature (≈30 °C) and at the open-circuit potential using an Autolab 302N Modular Potentiostat from Metrohm in the two-electrodes configuration. The irradiance value was varied utilizing suitable neutral optical filters. A 10 mV RMS AC perturbation was applied in the frequency range 100 kHz to 50 mHz. The Nova 1.9 software package was employed and ZView software used to fit the data.

In both types of tandem cells, the short circuit current is the sum of the top and bottom currents as in a simple two cells parallel connection. Thus, also the IT-DSC, where the three electrodes share the same electrolyte, can be considered a device composed of two cells that work independently. In both configurations the top cells show a higher JSC with respect to the bottom ones because TPEs are directly exposed to light, whereas BPEs are shaded by them. Moreover, as expected, currents of the top cells for the two configuration have similar values (about 12 mA cm−2).
For what concerns the bottom cells, the JSC of the integrated device (I-bottom) is significantly higher compared to the standard bottom cell (3.1 mA cm−2 and 1.4 mA cm−2, respectively) confirming that the incident light radiation for the former is more intense. Part of this improvement is due to light reflection/scattering of the aluminum layer behaving as a back reflector.
The VOC of the I-bottom is lower than in the standard configuration (Table 1). This behavior was investigated through EIS measurements and can be ascribed to the increased recombination rates and conduction band edge shifts inside the integrated device likely due to the presence of aluminum and zirconia layers.
These electron recombination phenomena are the cause for the non-ideal slope of the I–V curve near the JSC for the bottom cell (Fig. 3) (low shunt resistance). However, the FF of the complete IT-DSC (65%) is not significantly affected, underlying the absence of further shunt and series resistances.
Summarizing, the new architecture allows a better interplay among absorption and electrical characteristics of BPEs and TPEs leading to an overall 10% enhancing of the efficiency passing from 6.07% for the T-DSC to 6.66% for the IT-DSC.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of IT-DSC (Fig. 4) shows the enlargement of the absorbed spectrum in the near infra-red region thanks to the contribution of the black dye at the BPE.

The use of light management techniques20 (such as scattering layers,21,22 photonic crystals,23 co-sensitization,3–7 gratings coupling,24 etc.) and high performance materials/treatments2,25,26 can be employed to further enhance the IT-DSC efficiency.
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the charge transfer proprieties of the IT-DSC compared to the standard T-DSC configuration.27 Cells were measured at VOC under bias light intensity. Fig. 5 shows the impedance spectra taken at 1 sun on TPEs. The fit of the spectra was carried out through the complete transmission line model28,29 which turns into a simplified model for high illumination when the TiO2 is in the conductive state.30 Under this latter condition the typical three-arcs characteristic spectrum is observed. The charge transfer at the Pt–electrolyte interface is described by the resistance RPt (first semicircle to the left of the spectra in Fig. 5). The electron recombination Rrec between the electrons injected in the TiO2 by the dye and the electrolyte acceptor species (i.e. tri-iodide ions) is expressed by the second semicircle.31 Finally, the third semicircle (noticeable in Fig. 5a and c) is the electrolyte diffusion resistance Rd.16,32
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots from EIS measurements performed on the top cell (a), bottom cell (b and b′) and tandem connections (c) of a T-DSC and of an IT-DSC. EIS measurements were performed at VOC under 1000 W m−2 on the top cells. The bottom cells were measured at lower light intensities due to the light absorption of the top layers. Light absorption differs as function of the cell configuration. 
A general overview on the first semicircles of top cells and tandem connections (Fig. 5a and c) shows similar RPt values. This means that the charge transfer at the Pt–electrolyte interface of the integrated devices is not at all hindered by the intermediate layers deposited on the counterelectrode (i.e. ZrO2 and Al), underlining good catalytic proprieties.
The comparison of the third semicircles for the top cells gives an indication on the diffusion properties of the electrolyte in presence of the intermediate layers. Although Rd of IT-DSC is higher than in the standard device (13.5 Ω vs. 7 Ω), this does not influence the overall Rd of the integrated tandem cell (Fig. 5c).
A deviation from the three-arcs EIS characteristic can be noted for the bottom cells (Fig. 5b and b′). In fact, as a consequence of the light absorption by the top layers, a lower light intensity reaches the bottom cells. Under this condition the TiO2 is less conductive30 causing the appearance of a linear trend of the impedance on the second semicircle. This phenomenon is the indication of a resistive electron diffusion behaviour at the photoelectrode and is expressed by the charge transport resistance Rt.16,30,33
The integrated bottom cell presents a smaller second semicircle with a particularly evident linear behaviour compared to the standard one, although it is reached by a higher light intensity. This hints at a lower charge collection efficiency for the integrated bottom cell.
A deeper analysis of the two differently illuminated BPEs can be performed through the plot of photoelectron charge QOC and the Rrec parameter as function of VOC which is varied by changing the light intensity (Fig. 6).33,34
 Fig. 6  Electronic photogenerated charge QOC and recombination resistance Rrec as a function of VOC for the bottom photoelectrodes (BPEs) of IT-DSC and T-DSC. Full and dotted lines are guide to the eye. 
The Rrec vs. VOC trends (Fig. 6) show a much lower recombination resistance for the integrated bottom cell with respect to the standard one. This highlights larger electron reactions at the photoelectrode with I3− ions. At first sight, the lower Rrec could be ascribed to the back-contact structure of the integrated bottom cell.35,36 In fact, here the light hits the TiO2 layer from the opposite side with respect to the electron collecting layer. Hence, electrons have to diffuse through longer distances with respect to the standard bottom cell being more prone to recombinations. Nevertheless, this large Rrec difference can only partially be associated to the back-contact connection, since the TiO2 layer is thin (6 μm) and the black dye has a small molar extinction coefficient. Therefore, the low Rrec for the integrated bottom cell is attributed mainly to the Al–ZrO2–electrolyte interface which influences the whole device, lowering the VOC.
Charge photogeneration at VOC is studied to further analyze the electrochemical properties in the integrated structure.
The photogenerated charge QOC is calculated as τOC × JSC,37–39 where the electron lifetime τOC is obtained by EIS measurements as the product of the chemical capacitance Cμ and Rrec.31,39
τOC, calculated at VOC = 600 mV, gives a low value (16.5 ms) for the integrated bottom cell, whereas it is 115 ms for the standard bottom cell. Nevertheless, QOC at 600 mV is almost 2-fold higher for the integrated bottom cell since the JSC is significantly larger.
For a fixed value of QOC, the VOC of the standard bottom cell is considerably larger. VOC is the difference between the quasi electron Fermi level in TiO2 (EF,n) and the electrolyte redox level.40 Assuming that the electrolyte redox potential for T-DSC and IT-DSC is unchanged, the difference in VOC is ascribed to difference in EF,n. EF,n in the TiO2 is given by the TiO2 conduction band position ECB and by the electron concentration in the TiO2, (ne).41 Therefore fixing QOC value, which can be interpreted as fixing the electron concentration in the TiO2, ne,38,41–43 allows to evaluate the ΔECB shift between the two bottom devices.40,41,43,44
It emerges that the integrated bottom cell has a relevant positive shift of the ECB level with respect to the standard device, likely due to the different photoelectrode architecture. Eventually, this contributes to the VOC decrease.
Summarizing, although the integrated bottom cell suffers an ECB positive shift and a shorter electron lifetime, the much higher incident light reaching the BPE of the integrated configuration results in an overall higher QOC and in a higher efficiency (see Table 1). Therefore solving the issue of the high electron recombination in the bottom layer (i.e. using TiCl4 treatment on TCO and titania surface,25 optimized blocking layer and electrolyte formulation) could further improve the performance of the whole integrated device.
Simulations
The complexity of an architecture such as IT-DSC requires the construction of a large number of prototypes in order to find the optimal fabrication parameters. This is the reason why a simulation tool can be invaluable to discriminate the key fabrication parameters and to find out their optimal values.
The interplay of the different components of a DSC requires the modeling of the entire device in all its parts. We have developed a model for DSCs based on finite element method and drift diffusion equations within the TiberCAD simulation tool.45 The simulator allows to solve the model over a generic mesh in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions. A detailed description of the model has been presented elsewhere.46–49
The correct evaluation of charge photogeneration is a central point in tandem cells, being the photogeneration in the bottom cell strongly dependent on the top cell absorption. The photoelectron generation (G) in the two TiO2 layers are calculated as: 
GTPE(x) = ∫ΦTPE(λ)αTPE(λ)e−αTPE(λ)dλ
(1) 
GBPE(x) = ∫ΦBPE(λ)αBPE(λ)e−αBPE(λ)dλ
(2)where 
ΦTPE(λ) = TTCO(λ)Φ0(λ)
(3) 
ΦBPE(λ) = ΦTPE(λ)Tel(λ)TTPE(λ)
(4) 
TTPE(λ) = e−ATPE(λ)
(5)here Φ0 is the incident light spectrum used in the experiment, TTCO is the transmission spectra of the glass/TCO layer, αTPE and αBPE are the absorption spectra of the dyes in the TPE and in the BPE, respectively.
The spectrum of the light reaching the BPE is calculated considering the light harvested by the first layer of TiO2 (ATPE) and the losses due to the transmission of the electrolyte separating the two photoelectrodes (Tel). The percentage of light lost in the first part of the cell is calculated following the procedure illustrated in ref. 47 discarding the back reflection and the light scattering.
In Fig. 7 experimental and simulated I–V characteristics for single layers and for tandem connections are shown. The simulations were performed using 2D geometries in order to capture the complexity of the real structures. The simulated curve for the top layer is obtained by considering a standard set of parameters,48 with a recombination constant of ke = 4750 (s−1) and electron mobility μe = 1.6 (cm2 V−1 s−1). We have assumed that there are no shunt resistances and no energy shift of the conduction band. We adopt the same parameterization for the bottom layer since the TiO2 paste used in the fabrication process was the same. The simulation of the top cell agrees very nicely with the experimental J–V characteristics, whereas the simulated bottom cell presents a larger VOC respect to the experimental one (around 70 mV larger). This can be likely ascribed to the presence of the zirconium–Al interface and to recombination processes at that interface other than TiO2–electrolyte. Such recombinations were not included in our model.
 Fig. 7  Simulated (continuous line) and experimental (symbol) I–V curves for IT-DSC and its components. Black is the tandem connection, red is the top cell and green is the bottom cell. The blue curve is the ideal curve of the bottom cell corrected with a shunt resistance of 1.4 kΩ. 
These recombination channels can be lumped in a shunt resistance of 1.4 kΩ that, added to the simulation results, permitting to better reproduce the experimental data (see Fig. 7). This value is comparable with the conduction band shift occurring in the integrated bottom cell, suggested by the EIS measurements discussed in the previous section.
The tandem configuration is in good agreement with the experiments with a calculated efficiency of 6.62%.
The simulations are also used to investigate the optimal thickness of the top and bottom photoelectrodes. The efficiency of the IT-DSC is a fine interplay between light absorption of the two single photoelectrodes and their thicknesses. In each single cell, two physical parameters are in competition: the thickness of the active layer, leading to an improve of the light absorption and the diffusion length of electrons in the film. If charges are generated too far from the collection electrode (a distance higher than the diffusion length), they will never be collected and recombine. The maximum efficiency occurs when the absorption and the diffusion length are equal. Moreover, in the IT-DSC the thickness of the top cell will also impact on the efficiency of the bottom cell, and this optimization of the TiO2 thickness of BPE is not independent on the TPE thickness.
In Fig. 8 the IT-DSC efficiency map obtained by varying the thickness of TPE and BPE is shown. In these simulations we have assumed an ideal bottom cell (no shunt resistance and no energy shift of the conduction band). This choice does not significantly change our results considering that the bottom cell contributes to only 12% of the total efficiency and that the effect of parallel resistances and energy shift change only 25% of the bottom cell performances.
 Fig. 8  Efficiency map of the IT-DSC as a function of the thicknesses of TPE and BPE. The color scale (on the right) measures the efficiency in percentage. 
By varying the thicknesses of the two TiO2 layers we obtain a very clear indication of the final geometry optimizing the balance between light absorption and charge collection. A clear maximum of 7.2% is reached for a top layer of 8–10 μm and a bottom photoanode of 14–16 μm. The black dye, with a low molar extinction coefficient, requires a very large TiO2 thickness in order to harvest all the residual light passing through the top cell. Moreover this cell is back contacted, therefore the higher is the penetration of light the closer electrons are generated to the collecting anode.
From simulations it emerges that the increase of the BPE thickness can lead to absorption improvements and, thus, to overall higher cell efficiencies. Moreover, simulation can be used also for choosing the right combination of the dyes able to optimize the spectral coverage of the light absorption.
Conclusion
In this work we propose a new integrated tandem DSC architecture with an efficiency of 6.66%, outperforming other reported integrated tandem DSC.
Differently from the standard tandem DSC, this configuration is composed by two active photoelectrodes and a common counterelectrode. Here, the main innovation is the removal of the intermediate conductive glass which leads to advantages in terms of cost and weight of the device and minimization of interlayer photon losses.
A direct comparison between an integrated and conventional tandem DSC is performed in terms of electrical and electrochemical measurements.
From current–voltage curves, the integrated tandem DSC shows a significant higher short circuit current and a lower VOC which, however, results in a relative 10% higher efficiency than the standard non-integrated device.
Impedance spectroscopy analyses attributes this VOC behavior to the lower electron recombination resistance and to the positive shift of the TiO2 conduction band on the integrated bottom cell. Therefore, by simply optimizing the fabrication of the integrated bottom photoelectrode, better performance could be achieved.
Moreover, by using numerical simulations, efficiency maps of the entire system show that further improvements could be obtained by optimizing TiO2 thicknesses.

 	Fig. 4  External quantum efficiency of the IT-DSC.	 

 	Fig. 5  Nyquist plots from EIS measurements performed on the top cell (a), bottom cell (b and b′) and tandem connections (c) of a T-DSC and of an IT-DSC. EIS measurements were performed at VOC under 1000 W m−2 on the top cells. The bottom cells were measured at lower light intensities due to the light absorption of the top layers. Light absorption differs as function of the cell configuration.	 

 	Fig. 6  Electronic photogenerated charge QOC and recombination resistance Rrec as a function of VOC for the bottom photoelectrodes (BPEs) of IT-DSC and T-DSC. Full and dotted lines are guide to the eye.
