Solar cells based on bBDT(TDPP)2-PC71BM with two different types of side chains exhibit high power conversion efficiencies, up to 5.53%.
Small molecule semiconductors have attracted significant interest as electron donors for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, driven by several advantages vs. their polymeric counterparts, such as monodispersity, easier and more efficient purification, amenability to more characterization methods, and negligible batch-to-batch variations.1,2 Furthermore, small molecule-based solar cells now exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 7.8%.3–5 In this context, π-acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular donors using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the A unit and various thienoacenes such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),6,7 naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (NDT),8 and naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (zNDT)9 as the D unit, have repeatedly proven successful (Fig. 1). However, to the best of our knowledge the benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (bBDT) framework has never been used in molecular OPV donors, despite investigations in D–A OPV co-polymers10–13 and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).14,15 Nevertheless, DFT calculations on bBDT-centered molecules bearing two thiophene-capped DPP (TDPP) acceptor units reveal appealing frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies and planar geometries (Fig. S1, ESI†), rendering the bBDT(TDPP)2 (1) core a promising OPV donor candidate. Considering the importance of solubilizing side chains for the self-assembly and performance of OPV donors,16 we investigated three bBDT(TDPP)2 derivatives, with systematically varied substitution pattern on the bBDT core and on the TDPP units. We report here preliminary findings on the synthesis, charge transport, and OPV properties of these new molecules and their corresponding blends with fullerenes.

The synthetic route to the donor materials 1a–c is summarized in the ESI† (Scheme S1). To characterize the optical properties of 1a–c, UV-Vis spectrometry was carried out on dilute CHCl3 solutions as well as on thin films (Fig. 2A, Table S2, ESI†). The spectra of 1a–c are almost identical, suggesting that the solution electronic structure is essentially substituent-independent. On proceeding from the solution to the film state, the 1a–c optical spectra exhibit an additional shoulder at ∼670 nm while the principal optical onset undergoes a significant red-shift to ∼730 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of ∼1.70 eV. Both effects can be ascribed to extensive molecular aggregation as well as enhanced core planarity in the solid state.17 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 was used to estimate 1a–c FMO energies (Fig. 2B, Table S3, ESI†). CV plots (vs. Fc/Fc+) for 1a–c reveal identical HOMO energies of −5.20 eV. From the CV-derived HOMO energies and the optical band gaps, the LUMO energies are estimated at −3.50 eV, which are comparable to values obtained from the onset of the CV reduction waves (1a: EA = −3.40 eV; 1b: EA = −3.56 eV; 1c: EA = −3.44 eV).

(C) J–V plots for 1a:PC71BM (1:1.5), 1b:PC71BM (1:1) and 1c:PC71BM (1:1)-based inverted OPVs fabricated from CHCl3/DIO (99:1). (D) EQE plots for 1a–c-based solar cells. 
To access the charge transport characteristics, FET and space charge limited current (SCLC) diode mobilities were next measured (Fig. S4 and S5, Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). Bottom-gate top-contact FETs exhibit substantial hole mobilities of μh = 6.39 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1a), 3.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1b), and 1.16 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1c) – among the highest reported for small molecule OPV donors.1,2 In contrast, SCLC measurements reveal lower vertical mobilities for the pristine films, μh = 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1a), 5.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1b), and 5.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1c). These results agree well with grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments, which indicate preferential edge-on stacking of the molecules on the substrate surfaces (Fig. S8, ESI†). In addition to pristine 1 films, the microstructures of the most photoactive 1a–c:PC71BM blend films (see OPV section below) were next investigated, using GIWAXS, bright-field electron microscopy (TEM), and AFM. Comparing blends spun-cast from CHCl3 (1:1–1.5:1 1a–c:PC71BM wt/wt ratio), the GIWAXS data indicate only slight variations in crystalline domain order (Fig. S8, ESI†), while the TEM and AFM images show almost identical morphologies (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6, ESI†) characterized by phase-separated PC71BM clusters (∼50 nm), much larger than typical exciton diffusion lengths. In contrast to the above results, utilization of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive18,19 yields strikingly different blend film morphologies (Fig. 3). TEM and AFM images indicate that 1a films undergo significant phase separation, forming large, rod-shaped crystallites during blend film deposition with DIO. This remarkable crystallization of 1b in these blends is supported by GIWAXS, which yields spectra characterized by a large number of short and long range order diffraction peaks (Fig. 3A). Not unexpectedly for such highly ordered domains, the SCLC hole mobility of the 1a:PC71BM blend increases to μh = 3.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. In marked contrast, an optimal blend morphology maximizing the OPV performance (vide infra) was achieved for 1b:PC71BM films. Instead of large acceptor domains, a nanoscopically phase separated network is formed. GIWAXS data for this blend (Fig. 3B) reveal substantial crystalline domains, ensuring efficient charge transport. Furthermore, the 1b:PC71BM hole mobility evidences only a slight decrease versus that of the pristine film (μh = 4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The solid state morphology of 1c exhibits large PC71BM clusters even after 1% v/v DIO addition (Fig. 3C). However, close inspection of the images reveals areas with nanoscopically intermixed D–A domains, which reasonably explains the OPV performance enhancement (vide infra). Thus, 3,7-dimethyloctyl-substitution on molecular donors 1b and 1c prevents strong aggregation, large-scale phase separation, and the excessive crystallization observed for 1a as well as ensures intercalation of the fullerene acceptor when processed with DIO.20 The in-plane and out-of-plane line cuts of the GIWAXS spectra of films processed with DIO (Fig. S9 and Table S6, ESI†) show different lamellar spacing for the different substituents. Thus, 1a and 1c exhibit a singular lamellar peak with associated distances of 17.4 Å and 20.1 Å, respectively, consistent with the expected chain length dimensions. However, 1b shows two distinct lamellar peaks (17.2 Å and 20.4 Å), the first corresponding to the 2-ethylhexyl chains of 1a and the second associated with the 3,7-dimethyloctyl chain of 1c, indicating formation of two different phases and supposedly less ordered interactions between different types of side chains which may explain the reduced phase separation in the blend. Thus, the side chain mixing in 1b provides the optimum balance between solid-state ordering and donor–acceptor-miscibility in this donor series.
OPVs with inverted ITO/ZnO/1:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag architectures were fabricated and optimized by varying the active layer composition, spin speed and solvent additives for the active layer deposition (Fig. 2C and D). Tables S7 and S8 (ESI†) summarize the present OPV data. Optimal device performances are obtained using active layer blends with 1a:PC71BM = 1:1.5 and 1b/1c:PC71BM = 1:1 wt/wt ratios. The comparable electronic structures and film morphologies of molecular donors 1 and their BHJ blends deposited without DIO (vide supra; Fig. 2 and 3), result in similar illuminated current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. S10 and Table S7, entries 1, 4, 9, ESI†). Thus, comparable open circuit voltage (VOC) values (0.76–0.81 V) and low short-circuit currents (JSC = 3.02–3.62 mA cm−2) constrain the PCE to 1.32%. However, the diverging film morphologies for the blends of 1a and 1cvs.1b, all processed with 1% DIO, result in major OPV performance differences. Despite the greatly enhanced crystallinity of the 1a domains in the blends, which should result in large intra-grain charge carrier mobilities and favorable charge extraction, the performance of the 1a-based blends remains modest with JSC ∼ 4.6 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 39% and a maximum PCE of 1.3%. This undoubtedly results from inefficient exciton splitting due to the macroscopic phase separation. Note that the morphology of 1c-based blends does improve upon DIO addition (vide supra; Fig. 3) and, consequentialy, the corresponding devices exhibit greatly increased JSC = 8.5 mA cm−2, affording PCEs approaching 4%. Most importantly, due to the considerably increased phase interpenetration in the BHJ blend, OPV devices fabricated from 1b:PC71BM with DIO exhibit both dramatically increased JSC = 11.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 63.2% enhancing the overall PCEs to ≥5.5%. These values are among the highest reported for small molecule OPVs and significantly exceed those reported for bBDT-based polymers (PCEs = 1.1–5.2%).10–13
In conclusion, we report fine-tuning the self-organization properties of bBDT(TDPP)2 donor BHJ blends by varying the molecular core structure, the solubilizing side chains characteristics, and the blend processing additive yielding OPVs with PCEs as high as 5.53%. These results can be understood in terms of the particular blend morphologies, charge transport characteristics, and microstructures, again emphasizing the profound significance of side chain architecture in designing new OPV materials.
