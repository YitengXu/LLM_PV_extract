    , Accepted 24th June 2020First published on 25th June 2020AbstractElectron transport layers (ETLs) are critical for improving device performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, a distannylated electron-deficient bithiophene imide (BTI-Tin) is synthesized, which enables us to access structurally novel acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type polymers. Polymerizing BTI-Tin with dibrominated naphthalene diimide (NDI-Br) and perylene diimide (PDI-Br) affords two A–A copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI). The all-acceptor backbone yields both low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for the polymers, which combined with their high electron mobility render P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) as promising ETLs for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). When applied as ETLs to replace the conventional [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) in planar p–i–n PVSCs, the PC61BM-free devices based on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.5% and 20.8%, respectively, with negligible hysteresis. Such performance is attributed to efficient electron extraction and reduced charge recombination. Moreover, the devices based on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs show improved stability compared to the PC61BM based ones due to the higher hydrophobicity of the new ETLs. This work provides important guidelines for designing n-type polymers to replace PC61BM as efficient ETLs for high-performance PVSCs with improved stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are rapidly developing due to their high absorption coefficient,1,2 wide absorption range and long exciton diffusion length of perovskite active layers.3–6 The efficiency of PVSCs has substantially increased from 3.8% in 2009 to greater than 24% in 2019.7,8 Generally, the PVSCs can be divided into conventional ones (n–i–p) and inverted ones (p–i–n) based on their architecture. The inverted PVSCs have attracted more attention due to their low temperature solution processing and reduced device fabrication cost.9–12 In PVSCs, the charge transport layers, namely n-type or electron transport layer (ETL)13–15 and p-type or hole transport layer (HTL)16–21 play critical roles in selectively extracting corresponding photogenerated carriers and transporting them to the respective electrodes, i.e. cathode and anode. While in recent years remarkable progress has been made in the development of HTL materials,16–21 the development of high-performance ETLs is lagging behind. Among them, fullerene and its derivatives, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), remain the most widely used ETLs to date, showing the highest PCEs in inverted PVSCs.22–28 Despite such promising device performance, the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene based ETLs, such as high synthetic cost, low ambient stability, limited energy level variability and poor film morphology, strongly restrict their applicability in PVSCs.29–32 Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop non-fullerene n-type semiconductors as efficient ETLs for enabling high-performance PVSCs.
However, only a few n-type organic semiconductors have been reported as promising ETLs to replace PC61BM in PVSCs till now. Among them, n-type small molecules such as naphthalene diimide (NDI),33–35 perylene diimide (PDI)36–38 and azaacenes derivatives39–41 (Fig. 1a) have been explored as ETLs in inverted PVSCs. However, the PCEs of PVSCs based on these small molecule ETLs are still low, typically below 18%. Moreover, these organic small molecules exhibit significant drawbacks for device fabrication, such as uneven surface, poor film morphology and possible crack formation.13 Compared to small molecules, n-type conjugated polymers have showed higher electron mobility, better film forming property, and stronger hydrophobicity.42,43 Ma et al. first reported n-type polymers as ETLs in inverted PVSCs, but obtained a relatively low PCE of ∼8%.44 A great progress has been made by Yip and co-workers, with PCE improved to 16.7% by introducing an amine-functionalized polymer PFN-2TNDI (Fig. 1b) as the ETL to replace PC61BM in inverted PVSCs, showing a high PCE of 16.7%.45
 Fig. 1  (a) The representative high-performance non-fullerene small molecule acceptors as ETLs in inverted PVSCs; (b) the representative high-performance n-type polymer semiconductors as ETLs in inverted PVSCs; (c) the imide-functionalized all-acceptor n-type copolymers as ETLs in inverted PVSCs reported in this work. 
Recently, the highest PCE of ca. 17% has been achieved with an n-type conjugated polymer P(NDI2DT-TTCN) as the ETL, which contains an electron-withdrawing dicyanothiophene (Fig. 1b) in addition to NDI in polymeric backbone.46 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of polymer P(NDI2DT-TTCN) is −4.14 eV, one of the deepest-lying values among ETLs for PVSC reported to date. Such LUMO level is beneficial to electron extraction from perovskite to the cathode. However, it should be noted that too deep-lying LUMO level may lead to negative effect on the Voc of perovskite solar cells. Hence, the LUMO energy level indeed plays an important role in determining the PCE of perovskite solar cells. As well-known in the field, n-type polymers with suitable LUMO energy levels as ETLs in PVSCs are highly limited and only very few polymer ETLs show promising device performance. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop novel ETLs to further improve PVSC performance. However, it should be pointed out that apart from the LUMO level several other factors also play important role on determining PCE in perovskite solar cells, including electron mobility, passivation effect, thermal property, and film morphology.13,14
To date, the reported n-type polymer ETLs in PVSCs are mostly based on the donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy, which is mainly due to the scarcity of highly electron-deficient building blocks with compact geometry.43,45 However, incorporation of electron-rich donor co-units can lead to elevated FMO energy levels for the resulting D–A copolymers, which may suppress electron extraction and collection and also lead to hole leakage at cathode. In order to improve electron extraction and simultaneously optimize hole-blocking property, the acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type polymers are well desired, which should possess both deep-lying LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).47 The deep-positioned LUMOs should facilitate electron extraction by reducing contact barrier and low-lying HOMOs can effectively block hole leakage to minimize charge recombination at cathode. Hence such semiconducting ETLs may yield improved device performance compared to the typical D–A type polymer ETLs in the fullerene-free PVSCs. However, the development of A–A type copolymers is quite challenging due to the synthetic barrier, including (1) the limited choice of electron-deficient building blocks which can be readily functionalized for typical palladium-mediated polymerization and (2) the reduced reaction activity between acceptor and acceptor, which is generally lower than that between donor and acceptor. As a consequence, the A–A polymers likely have lower molecular weights than the D–A counterpart polymers. In fact, such A–A type copolymers have never been reported for use as ETLs in PVSCs to date even if they hold the desired electrical properties, which hence drive us to explore them for applications in PVSCs.
Some A–A type polymers have been successfully synthesized via Suzuki coupling, Yamamoto coupling or carbon–hydrogen (C–H) activation.48–50 However, these polymerization methods face serious challenges in terms of reactivity and selectivity, which largely limit the diversity of chemical structures and polymer molecular weights. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel distannylated imide-functionalized electron-deficient monomer in high purity, which can be readily polymerized with various electron-deficient dibrominated imide-functionalized co-monomers. The successful synthesis and high reactivity of distannylated electron-deficient bithiophene imide (BTI-Tin) monomer with high purity can enable us to access structurally novel acceptor–acceptor type polymers with optimized property, which in turn results in improved device performance. Such distannylated electron-deficient monomer can enrich the library of n-type polymers, particularly the A–A type copolymers. Fig. 1c shows the chemical structures of the novel BTI-based copolymers synthesized via this protocol. These newly developed P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) contain both electron-deficient imide-functionalized bithiophene imide (BTI) and NDI (or PDI) in backbone. NDI and PDI are known as highly electron-deficient building blocks and have been widely used for constructing n-type polymer semiconductors in organic electronics, particularly n-type thin-film transistors and all-polymer solar cells.51–58 Since its debut,59 BTI has showed a remarkable success in the development of high-performance organic semiconductors over the last decade, and the BTI-based polymers have yielded promising device performance in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),60–62 polymer solar cells (PSCs)63 and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs).64 Combining the advantages of both BTI and NDI (or PDI), the A–A copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are expected to be promising n-type polymer semiconductors. When applied as ETLs to replace the conventional PC61BM, the inverted PVSCs with P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) achieved high PCEs of 19.5% and 20.8%, respectively. The 20.8% PCE is among the highest values in PVSCs using organic materials (both small molecules and polymers) as ETLs. In addition, the solar cells based on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) have demonstrated greatly improved stability compared to the PC61BM based ones.
Results and discussions

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the distannylated BTI monomer and A–A copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI). Stille coupling between the brominated BTI and excessive hexabutylditin as the reactants with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst65,66 was first tried to synthesize the distannylated BTI monomer, however no desired product was found. To our delight, the target distannylated monomer can be facilely synthesized in high purity by lithiating BTI with diisopropylamide (LDA) followed by the treatment with tributyltin chloride (Fig. S3†). The sterically hindered LDA can successfully deprotonate thiophene and keep the carbonyl functionality intact. Based on our experiences, polymerizations using microwave heating typically yield polymers with higher molecular weights than polymerizations using conventional thermal heating. In addition, microwave synthesis can greatly reduce the polymerization time from typical 2–3 days (conventional thermal heating) to a couple of hours. Hence, the two A–A copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) were then prepared via Stille coupling protocol under microwave irradiation and the synthetic details can be found in ESI.† After polymerization, the polymers were purified by successive Soxhlet extractions using methanol, acetone, and hexane as the solvents to remove low molecular weight fractions and impurities. Finally, the dichloromethane (DCM) fractions were collected and reprecipitated into methanol to provide the target polymers. The polymers exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) due to the multiple alkylation sites on the imide groups, which are beneficial to device fabrication. The average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PD) of polymers were measured using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) at 150 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent. Polymer P(BTI-NDI) has an Mn of 27 kDa with a PD of 1.6 and P(BTI-PDI) shows an Mn of 11 kDa with a PD of 1.6 (Table 1). The lower molecular weight of P(BTI-PDI) than that of P(BTI-NDI) is likely due to the higher steric hindrance of PDI than NDI. The more steric demanding PDI can result in reduced reactivity in polymerization. In addition, the higher steric hindrance of PDI can lead to more twisted polymer backbone and hence suppressed aggregation property for the PDI-based polymer, which can in turn mitigate molecular weight overestimation in the GPC measurement. In fact, NDI-based polymers typically show higher Mn than PDI-based analogue polymers as reported in literature.60,67 Although the Mn is not very high, the results indicate a good reactivity of distannylated BTI monomer in Stille coupling for the synthesis of A–A type polymers, particularly polymer P(BTI-NDI). At present, the A–A copolymers are relatively rare, due to the synthetic challenges and associated steric hindrance imposed by typical strong electron-withdrawing groups, although they can exhibit excellent performance in various organic electronics. The biggest challenge for the development of A–A copolymers is the limit choice of stannylated and borylated acceptor monomers with high purity, compact structure, and high chemical reactivity in polymerization reaction. In this work, the good reactivity of BTI-Tin in Stille coupling is beneficial to the further development of structurally novel A–A type copolymers with greatly improved device performance.

Theoretical calculations were performed to gain insights into geometrical configuration and FMOs of both A–A polymers. The geometries are optimized using the Gaussian 09 program at the ωB97XD/6-31G (d, p) level of theory. The N-alkyl side chains were simplified using methyl group to simplify the calculation. Due to the steric hindrance, the dihedral angles between the BTI and NDI (or PDI) moieties are ∼52° and 55° (Fig. 2). Since PDI (or NDI)-based small molecules suffer from strong aggregation, which can lead to unfavorable film morphology and hence negatively affect charge extraction, resulting in declined photovoltaic performance.68,69 In order to overcome this issue by designing and synthesizing ETLs with twisted structures, both polymers can effectively prevent the formation of large aggregates, which should be conducive to the formation of high quality film and improving the device performance of PVSCs.36 Based on the calculated electron density distribution, the LUMOs of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are mainly localized on the NDI and PDI moieties, respectively. It was found that the HOMO is located on the BTI for P(BTI-NDI), whereas the HOMO is delocalized on the whole molecular skeleton for P(BTI-PDI). Despite the more twisted backbone of P(BTI-PDI), the more delocalized HOMO in BTI-PDI than that in BTI-NDI is likely attributed to better matching HOMO energy levels of BTI and PDI moieties than those of BTI and NDI moieties. The calculated LUMO and HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMOs) of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are −3.57/−6.15 and −3.57/−6.00 eV, respectively. Such deep-lying ELUMO/EHOMOs of acceptor–acceptor polymers should be beneficial to collecting electron and blocking hole.

Thermal properties of these A–A type polymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both exhibited high thermal decomposition temperature (Td) with a Td of 405 and 350 °C (Fig. S8a†) for P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), respectively, which should be beneficial to device stability over time.33 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed no obvious phase transition for polymer P(BTI-PDI), indicating that the polymer is relatively amorphous. However, for P(BTI-NDI), a low glass transition (Tg) temperature of 112 °C was detected (Fig. S8b†). When the device is annealed, the low Tg may has a negative impact on the film morphology and molecular packing, particularly in the p–i–n structure where ETLs are deposited on the top of perovskite, this may cause the slightly lower PCE of P(BTI-NDI) than P(BTI-PDI).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) in chloroform solution and as thin film are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymer solutions in chloroform showed two absorption bands, i.e. 350–425 nm and 450–625 nm for P(BTI-NDI) and 350–450 nm and 525–675 nm for P(BTI-PDI). The short one is assigned to the π–π* transition and the longer one is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BTI and NDI (or PDI) units. PDI-based polymer P(BTI-PDI) exhibits highly similar absorption profile and absorption maximum in solution and solid. Such absorption features indicate that P(BTI-PDI) has similar backbone torsion and inter-chain interaction in both states due to the quite large dihedral angle (∼55°) between the PDI and BTI moieties. While polymer P(BTI-NDI) exhibits a larger red-shift from solution to film than polymer P(BTI-PDI), which is attributed to the higher backbone planarity of P(BTI-NDI) than that of P(BTI-PDI) in film state due to the reduced steric hindrance associated with NDI moiety. The optical bandgaps (Eoptgs) were calculated based on the absorption onset of polymer films, which are 1.88 and 1.78 eV for P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), respectively. Despite its more twisted backbone, P(BTI-PDI) showed a smaller Eoptg, which can be attributed to its more extended pyrene core. It should be noted that the A–A type P(BTI-NDI) has a much larger Eoptg (1.88 eV) than the well-known donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymer N2200 (Eoptg = ca. 1.47 eV), attributable to the suppressed ICT character in P(BTI-NDI), although both polymers share the same NDI unit and bithiophene co-unit in the backbone.

Electrochemical properties of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) were probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using ferrocene as the external standard and the corresponding CV curves are plotted in Fig. 3b with the results summarized in Table 1. Both polymers display reversible reduction waves. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) were derived to be −4.09 and −4.01 eV based on the equation of ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred + 4.80) eV, where Eonsetred is the onset reduction potential versus Fc/Fc+. The LUMOs are both well-matched with the conduction band (CB, −3.90 eV) of the perovskite film, which should be beneficial for the electron extraction from perovskite active layer to ETLs (Fig. 3d). The EHOMOs of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are calculated to be −5.97 and −5.79 eV, respectively, based on the equation of EHOMO = ELUMO − Eoptg, much deeper than the valence band (VB, −5.50 eV) of the perovskite film, which should yield a good hole blocking capability. Hence, the appropriately-positioned HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) can facilitate electron extraction, minimize hole leakage, and hence suppress charge recombination at cathode.
The film morphologies of these ETLs deposited on perovskite active layer were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The perovskite film featured a rough surface, after coated with polymer ETLs P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), the surface became smoother and more uniform (Fig. S9†), which should be beneficial for reducing the penetration of external moisture and facilitating electron extraction from perovskite to ETL.46 The cross-section SEM image (Fig. S10a†) further confirms a good coverage of perovskite surface by the polymer ETL. However, the PC61BM covered surface shows distinctive pin holes, likely caused by PC61BM aggregation. Such surface can lead to the perovskite active layer in direct contact between the perovskite active layer and the electrode, which causes current leakage and a higher degree of charge recombination and negatively impacts the long-term stability. Based on the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode (Fig. S10b†), carbon and sulfur elements are present in the P(BTI-PDI) ETL and high quality and uniform perovskite film can be observed from the element maps of Pb, I and Cs. Additionally, the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the polymer packing and crystallinity of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) films, and both polymers exhibited quite amorphous structure without distinctive lamellar diffraction, which is likely attributed to their twisted polymeric backbone (Fig. 2). P(BTI-NDI) shows isotropic diffraction halo, indicative of the random orientation of polymer chains on the perovskite active layer, however P(BTI-PDI) exhibits a distinctive π–π diffraction with the qz at 1.46 Å (Fig. S17†), indicating that the polymer preferentially adopts a face-on orientation, which is favorable for charge transport and is consistent with the higher electron mobility, thus improving the device performance (vide infra).
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated with an inverted device configuration of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/ETL/BCP/Ag (Fig. 3c) to probe the performance of P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) as ETL. The polytriarylamine (PTAA) was used as the hole transport layer (HTL). A thin BCP film (∼8 nm) as hole blocking/electron transporting layer was applied as it could further improve the device performance. In addition, BCP can function as a buffer layer to reduce the damage between ETL and metal electrode.27 The effect of the polymer ETLs thickness on the device performance was investigated and the results are summarized in Fig. S13 and S14.† It was found that P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs with a thickness of 69 and 71 nm afford the optimal performance, respectively. The J–V curves from the best-performing devices are recorded in Fig. 4 and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. By substitution of PC61BM with P(BTI-NDI) ETL, the solar cells show the highest PCE of 19.5% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.10 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 22.7 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.5%. To our delight, the PVSCs with P(BTI-PDI) ETL achieve simultaneously increased performance parameters with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 23.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 79.4%, resulting in a remarkable PCE of 20.8%. The hysteresis of the devices with P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs was investigated in both forward and reverse scan directions. The reverse scan yielded a higher PCE of 19.5% and 20.8%, and the forward scan resulted in a slightly reduced PCE of 19.1% and 20.6% for P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), respectively, suggesting a small hysteresis, particularly for the P(BTI-PDI)-based cells. For comparison, the devices with PC61BM ETLs were also fabricated, the optimal J–V characteristic is shown in Fig. S11.† It was found that the performance of P(BTI-PDI) based device is superior to that of PC61BM based one mainly due to the improved Jsc value, which likely results from the more efficient electron extraction ability of P(BTI-PDI) ETL. In addition, the improved efficiency may also be attributed to the passivation of perovskite surface traps by the coordination between sulfur (S) in BTI unit and Pb. In addition, the carbonyl groups in polymer ETLs can also passivate the traps of perovskite, as reported in our previous study.70,71 The efficiency distribution of PVSCs based on three distinct ETLs is displayed in Fig. 4d, which shows a good reproducibility. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performing devices containing P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs exhibit high values approaching 90% in the range of 450–750 nm (Fig. 4f) and the integrated current-density from the EQE is in good agreement with the Jsc from J–V measurement with a mismatching less than 5%.

Electron mobility (μe,SCLC) of ETLs is a critical parameter for improving the device performance of PVSCs, which was then characterized using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method for both polymers together with PC61BM. The μe,SCLC values were measured to be 4.2 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), respectively, which are higher than that (3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of PC61BM37,38 (Fig. S15†). These results indicate that the newly designed acceptor–acceptor type copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) show advantage in electron transport over PC61BM, despite their twisted polymer backbone, which is beneficial to film morphology as ETL for PVSCs. The improved μe,SCLC of P(BTI-PDI) can be attributed to its increased face-on orientation of polymer chain on the perovskite surface.
To investigate the electron transport dynamic between perovskite film and ETL, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements were carried out for perovskite, perovskite/P(BTI-NDI), perovskite/P(BTI-PDI) and perovskite/PC61BM (Fig. 5a). The pristine perovskite shows a commonly observed biexponential decay with fast decay of τ1 = 44.7 ns and slow decay of τ2 = 1045 ns. For the perovskite film coated with P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs on top, the PL decay time significantly decrease to 2.4 and 0.6 ns for τ1 and 281.7 and 431.1 ns for τ2 (Table S1†), respectively. The much shortened decay lifetime of τ1 indicates that both polymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are efficient to extract electron from perovskite to ETL, and the moderately decreased τ2 of the P(BTI-PDI) containing film demonstrates that nonradiative recombination losses are suppressed at the perovskite/P(BTI-PDI) interface.72 Notably, the P(BTI-PDI)/perovskite film showed a higher PL quenching efficiency than the PC61BM/perovskite film (τ1 = 1.3 ns), implying a more efficient charge extraction from perovskite to the P(BTI-PDI) ETL which is in good agreement with the higher Jsc in the P(BTI-PDI) based devices.

(b) Operational stability of the PVSCs based on PC61BM, P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETL with maximum power point (MPP) tracking at near Vmpp point under continuous 1 sun illumination in ambient environment (∼65–70% relative humidity, 25–28 °C). 
Device stability is another important PVSC parameter relevant for future commercialization. To evaluate the device stability of PVSCs with polymer ETLs, accelerating aging tests were performed for devices with different ETLs using maximum power point (MPP) tracking method at near Vmpp point under continuous 1 sun illumination in ambient environment (∼65–70% relative humidity, 25–28 °C). As depicted in Fig. 5b, the devices based on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) ETLs showed significant improved operational stability than the PC61BM based ones. It was found that the PVSCs with P(BTI-PDI) interfacial layer can remain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 70 h (Fig. 5b), while the efficiency of the PC61BM-based ones dropped to 85% of its original value after 3 h operation under the same condition. To better understand the effects of different ETLs on the device stability, the contact angles of water droplets on P(BTI-NDI), P(BTI-PDI) and PC61BM thin films were measured. As shown in Fig. S16,† the contact angles on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are 101.2° and 103.5°, respectively, which are substantially higher than that (80.7°) on PC61BM. Interestingly, the contact angles on P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are higher than those on common ETLs,45 indicative of the high hydrophobicity of these A–A type copolymers, which could effectively suppress the penetration of moisture into the perovskite active layer and hence yield the improved device stability. The results clearly demonstrate that the two novel polymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) are excellent ETLs which can boost the device stability.
Conclusions
In summary, the distannylated electron-withdrawing bithiophene imide can be readily polymerized with dibrominated NDI and PDI comonomers to yield novel acceptor–acceptor type copolymers P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI). The new acceptor–acceptor design strategy enables P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) with deep-lying energy levels of FMOs (both LUMOs and HOMOs) and high hydrophobicity. More important, improved electron mobility is attained for both polymers, although they feature quite twisted backbone, which is beneficial to film morphology as ETL. Thanks to these advantages, the two polymers were successfully employed as efficient ETLs to replace the conventional PC61BM in inverted PVSCs. The device with these novel ETLs showed superior PCEs of 19.5% and 20.8% with negligible hysteresis for P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI), respectively, while the highest PCE of 20.1% was obtained for the PVSCs based on the conventional PC61BM ETL. Moreover, the devices with P(BTI-NDI) and P(BTI-PDI) as the ETLs exhibit improved device stability compared to the solar cells with PC61BM. This work offers a new molecular design protocol to develop high-performance ETLs for enabling highly efficient PVSCs with improved device stability.
