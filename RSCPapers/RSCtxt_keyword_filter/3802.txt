    , Accepted 19th August 2013First published on 20th August 2013AbstractThieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridged polymer semiconductors, P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), combining a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene donor unit and a benzothiadiazole or fluorinated benzothiadiazole acceptor unit, respectively, were designed and synthesized. The introduction of fluorine substituents remarkably influenced the molecular architecture, optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties of the polymers, as well as the optoelectronic performance of the devices made from these materials. The introduction of fluorine substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit not only down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the organic semiconductor but also enhanced the intra- and intermolecular interactions of the resulting conjugated polymer. As a result, the open-circuit voltage and mobility of corresponding devices based on the fluorinated polymer were enhanced markedly. Power conversion efficiencies of the polymer solar cells based on P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) reached 4.37% and 3.56%, with open circuit voltages of 0.72 and 0.81 V, respectively. The fluorinated polymer exhibited much higher mobilities (4.1 to 6.3 times) than the non-fluorinated polymer, reaching 0.017 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
Special interest is attached to fluorinated functional materials for various applications.1,2 The fluorine atom is an extremely electronegative substituent with a relatively small covalent radius. Fluorination of compounds can lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, as well as enhance the intra- and/or intermolecular interactions. These effects can be employed in tuning the properties of polymer semiconductors applied in optoelectronic devices, such as polymer solar cells and thin film transistors.3–11
We have recently shown a dramatic improvement in the photovoltaic performance of donor–π–acceptor conjugated polymers via π-bridge engineering.12–14 The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) bridge favours the enhancement of photovoltaic properties of the D–π–A copolymers by reducing their band gaps to harvest solar light energy more effectively. But at the same time, the HOMO energy level of TT-bridged polymer upshifts, which causes the decrease of open-circuit voltage of the corresponding polymer solar cells. To counteract this trend, as well as evaluate the effects of fluorination on the properties of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridged conjugated polymers, we designed and synthesized two new TT-bridged D–π–A copolymers, P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), combining the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor unit with benzothiadiazole (BT) and fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) acceptor units, respectively (shown in Scheme 1, compared with the formerly reported P(BDT-TT-BT)13). A hexyl chain was introduced on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ring and two long branched 2-octyldodecyloxy groups on the BDT segment to guarantee solubility of the monomers and polymers for preparation and purification, as well as studying the properties of the polymer semiconductors in solution-processable optoelectronic devices.

Experimental section
Materials
2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (ODBDT) was synthesized according to the procedure described in previous reports.13,15,16 Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) was purified by recrystallization from water before use. Other reagents and solvents were commercial grade and used as received without further purification. All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere.
Measurements and characterization
The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number-average molecular weights (Mn), weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) were measured on a PL-220 (Polymer Laboratories) chromatograph connected to a differential refractometer with polyethylene as reference standard and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as eluent (at 150 °C). All new compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 600 spectrometer at room temperature. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm. Splitting patterns were designated as s (singlet), t (triplet), d (doublet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Netzsch TG209C) measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrometer model UV-3150. Absorption spectra measurements of the polymer solutions were carried out in chloroform at 25 °C. Absorption spectra measurements of the polymer films were carried out on quartz plates with the polymer films spin-coated from the polymer solutions in chloroform at 25 °C. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon electrode, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. Polymer thin films were formed by drop-casting of polymer solutions in chloroform on the working electrode and then dried in air. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films were obtained on a Nanoscope V AFM (Digital Instruments) operating in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of thin films were performed in reflection mode with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) using a Rigaku D/max 2500 V X-ray diffractometer.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ITO glass as a positive electrode, Ca/Al as a negative electrode, and the photosensitive layer between them. The ITO glass was precleaned and modified by a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS, which was spin-cast from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevious P VP AI 4083 H. C. Stark, Germany) on the ITO substrate, and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was about 60 nm. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of polymer and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in chloroform on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Then, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited on the polymer layer by vacuum evaporation under 3 × 10−4 Pa. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured on an Ambios Tech XP-2 profilometer. The effective area of one cell was ca. 4 mm2. The current–voltage (J versus V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer controlled Keithley 236 source measure unit. A xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the white-light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2.
Fabrication of field-effect transistor devices
Thin-film polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs) were fabricated on highly doped silicon substrates with a thermally grown 300 nm thick silicon oxide (SiO2) insulating layer, where the substrate served as a common gate electrode. Prior to polymer semiconductor deposition, the substrates were treated with the silylating agent octyltrichlorosilane (OTS). Thin semiconductor films were then deposited by spin-coating the polymer solutions in chloroform on the substrates. The film thickness was measured by an XP-2 surface profilometer (Ambios Technology). The samples were then dried and annealed in air. Then, source–drain gold electrodes of the transistor were deposited on the polymer layer, by vacuum evaporation under 7 × 10−4 Pa, to form top-contact geometry. The electrical characterization of the transistor devices was performed using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer.

Subsequently, trimethyltin chloride (1 M in THF, 12 mL, 12 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring for another 6 hours, 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) (1.47 g, 5 mmol) and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (0.42 g, 0.6 mmol) were added to this mixture. After flushing with nitrogen for 10 min, the reactant was heated to reflux for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water and brine, then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica, eluting with petroleum ether/toluene (10:1).

Synthesis of the polymer

TTHBT or TTFBT monomer (0.2 mmol) and ODBDT monomer (0.2 mmol) were put into a 25 mL two-neck flask, then 10 mL of chlorobenzene was added. The mixture was stirred and purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes, and then tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (10 mg, 0.01 mmol) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (25 mg, 0.08 mmol) were added. After being purged for 15 minutes, the mixture was heated at 130 °C for 20 hours. The terminal 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene was added first and 2-bromothiophene added 12 hours later as end-cappers. After stirring for another 12 hours, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and then added dropwise to 200 mL methanol. The black precipitate was filtered into a Soxhlet funnel and extracted by methanol, hexane, and chloroform successively. The polymer recovered from chloroform solution was purified by preparative gel permeation chromatography. The product fractions were concentrated and precipitated into a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane. The precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under vacuum.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis routes of the polymers and monomers are outlined in Scheme 2 and Scheme 3. 6-Hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) was synthesized according to ref. 17 in four steps. 5,6-Difluoro-4,7-diiodo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (FBT) was synthesized following a method similar to literature procedures,4 but using stannous chloride dihydrate instead of hydrogen to reduce aromatic nitro group for safe and easy operating. TT was stannylated and coupled to benzothiadiazole halide (BT or FBT) in one pot. The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene substituted benzothiadiazole intermediates were brominated using NBS in chloroform/acetic acid mixed solvent. The resulting monomers TTHBT and TTFBT can be readily purified by recrystallization using DMF or chloroform/DMF. Polymers P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) were synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization. The polymers can be readily dissolved in chloroform, chlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), but hardly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The structures of the polymers were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Thermal behaviour of the polymers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss at 336 °C and 340 °C for P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, the thermal stabilities of the polymers are adequate for their applications in PSCs, PFETs, and other optoelectronic devices.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra for P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) in chloroform solutions and solid films are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λabs), absorption edge wavelengths (λonset), and the optical band gaps (Eoptg). The absorption bands in the range of 350–500 nm and 500–750 nm can be attributed to localized π–π* transition, and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene units and the electron-deficient benzothiadiazole units or fluorinated benzothiadiazole units, respectively. The absorption spectrum of P(BDT-TT-HBT) film was red shifted, and showed a weak absorption shoulder located at 652 nm, in comparison with that of its solution, indicating π–π stacking between the polymer backbones has formed aggregates or ordered packing in the solid film. In contrast, the absorption spectra of P(BDT-TT-FBT) revealed a stronger vibronic shoulder in both solution and solid film states, implying the intense intermolecular interactions. This phenomenon cannot be detected in the thiophene-bridged polymer analogue solution.4 These results indicate that the fluorinated thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridged D–A conjugated polymer was prone to form strong π–π intermolecular interactions, even in solution state, which is beneficial for improving the charge carrier mobility of the resulting polymer films. The optical absorption onsets of P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) films were at 730 and 718 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps of 1.70 and 1.73 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated polymers. From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram, HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be readily estimated, which correspond to ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA), respectively.
Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films are shown in Fig. 3. The onset oxidation potential (Eox)/onset reduction potential (Ered) of P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) are 0.58/−1.17, and 0.66/−1.15 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to the equations:18–22 HOMO = −IP = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV);(1) LUMO = −EA = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV).(2)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) films on glassy carbon electrodes. 
From the values of Eox and Ered of the polymers, the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the electrochemical bandgaps (EECg) were calculated and are listed in Table 1.
The HOMO energy levels of the polymers decreased regularly from13 −5.21 eV for P(BDT-TT-BT) (Scheme 1) to −5.29 eV for P(BDT-TT-HBT), because of the removal of electron-donor octyloxy substituents on BT rings, and then to −5.37 eV for P(BDT-TT-FBT), because of the introduction of the electron-accepting fluorine atom substituents on BT rings. The lower HOMO energy level was propitious to achieve better stability of the corresponding polymers and higher open-circuit voltage of the corresponding bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells.12
Theoretical calculations
To evaluate the impact of the fluorination on molecular architecture and consequently on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single point energies, with a molecular main chain length n = 1, at the b3lyp/6-31+g(2d,p) level of theory in vacuum using the GAMESS program.23–25 The final energies were calculated as the sum of single point and zero point energies. In particular, electron distributions of the HOMO and LUMO frontier molecular orbitals were calculated. Moreover, the little intramolecular steric hindrance alkoxy side chains on benzo[1,2 b:4,5-b′]dithiophene units were replaced by methyloxy groups in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand.
Optimized geometries of the TT-bridged copolymers in the ground state are depicted in Fig. 4. Both of the two conjugated polymers showed nearly straight line molecular chain shape with angles between the bonds across the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridge of 174.56° for P(BDT-TT-HBT) and 175.68° for P(BDT-TT-FBT). The dihedral angles between the TT bridge and the BDT unit were almost identical, 33.89° and 33.82° for P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), respectively. Compared with that of P(BDT-TT-BT) (7.70°),13 the increase of dihedral angles should be attributable to the steric hindrance of hexyl substituents on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge. Because of the hydrogen bonding interactions between fluorine atom on BT rings and neighboring hydrogen atoms on the TT rings, the dihedral angles between the TT bridge and the BT unit was decreased to 1.44° in P(BDT-TT-FBT), compared to that of 9.70° in P(BDT-TT-HBT).

The wave functions of the frontier molecular orbitals of P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) are shown in Fig. 5. As can be observed, the HOMO is delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbone while the LUMO is mostly concentrated on the benzothiadiazole-based acceptor groups. These images provide further evidence of the formation of well-defined D–π–A structure and the intramolecular charge transfer behavior of these two TT-bridged conjugated copolymers (i.e., the HOMO to LUMO transition is a donor to acceptor intramolecular charge transfer).13,14,26

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the effects of fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of the TT-bridged copolymers, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell (PSC) devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. Fig. 6 shows the current density–potential characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer:PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2.

The best PCE values of the PSC devices were obtained with a weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM of 1:1.5 for both TT-bridged polymers. A PCE of 4.37% with Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 10.12 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.60 was achieved for P(BDT-TT-HBT), and a PCE of 3.56% with Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 8.00 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.55 for P(BDT-TT-FBT). Compared with that of P(BDT-TT-BT)-based PSCs,13 the Voc values were increased by 0.03 V and 0.12 V for P(BDT-TT-HBT)- and P(BDT-TT-FBT)-based PSCs, respectively. The enhancement of open-circuit voltage of the polymer solar cells agrees well with the decrease of the HOMO energy levels of the corresponding polymers. However, power conversion efficiency of the P(BDT-TT-FBT)-based PSCs is lower than that of P(BDT-TT-HBT). P(BDT-TT-FBT) showed a lower photocurrent response in the devices than P(BDT-TT-HBT), as can be seen from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves in Fig. 7. The inferior photovoltaic performance of the fluorinated TT-bridged polymer is probably due to its low solubility leading to un-optimized phase separation with PC71BM. In addition, the lower molecular weight, compared to that of P(BDT-TT-HBT), was also disadvantageous for the photovoltaic performance of P(BDT-TT-FBT).

In order to investigate the effect of fluorination of the TT-bridged conjugated polymer on the morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend active layers and consequently on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to study the morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend films. As shown in Fig. 8, root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of AFM topographic images were 2.98 nm and 8.54 nm for the blends of P(BDT-TT-HBT):PC71BM (1:1.5) and P(BDT-TT-FBT):PC71BM (1:1.5), respectively. In organic semiconductors, the excitons generated beyond the exciton diffusion length would be quenched instead of dissociated into free carriers at the donor–acceptor interface. Larger domain sizes will result in less efficient exciton dissociation or charge generation in the bulk.27 RMS of the solar cell active layer based on P(BDT-TT-FBT) was about three times that of P(BDT-TT-HBT). The less efficient exciton dissociation and charge generation should be the main reasons for the lower photocurrent response.

Charge transport properties
To investigate the effect of fluorination of the TT-bridged conjugated polymer on the carrier transport properties of the polymers, bottom gate and top-contact PFETs based on P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) were fabricated.
The carrier mobility of each PFET was calculated according to the equation in the saturation regime from the gate sweep:12,20,28 IDS = μCi(W/2L)(VG − VT)2(3)where IDS is the drain current, μ is the carrier mobility, Ci is the specific capacitance of the gate dielectric, W and L are the semiconductor channel width and length, respectively, and VG and VT are gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
The spin-coated semiconducting polymers were thermally annealed at different temperatures, i.e. 25 °C, 80 °C, 120 °C, 160 °C and 200 °C, for 5 min. The dependence of the hole mobility on the annealing temperature and the detailed performance of the devices are summarized in Fig. 9 and Table 3. The output and transfer characteristics of PFETs based on P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) films, annealed at 200 °C, are shown in Fig. 10. With the increase of annealing temperature from room temperature to 200 °C, hole mobilities of the PFETs based on the polymers improved gradually. After annealing at 200 °C for 5 min, the PFETs showed mobilities double those of the unannealed devices, reaching 0.0038 and 0.0175 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), respectively. At all annealing temperatures, the mobilities of PFETs based on P(BDT-TT-FBT) were much higher (4.1 to 6.3 times) than those of P(BDT-TT-HBT) (Fig. 11).

In order to reveal the reason for the superior mobility of fluorinated TT-bridged conjugated polymers, topographies and microstructures of the PFET active layers were investigated by AFM and XRD.
As the annealing temperature increased, the roughness of the polymer films increased gradually. After annealing at 200 °C, the RMS of the films increased, from 0.76 nm to 0.96 nm for P(BDT-TT-HBT), and from 2.54 nm to 2.85 nm for P(BDT-TT-FBT). As a result, the mobilities of the semiconductor films approximately doubled. At the same time, the polycrystalline grains in P(BDT-TT-FBT) films are much bigger (about three times) than those of P(BDT-TT-HBT), at various annealing temperatures.
X-ray diffraction patterns and detailed XRD properties of the thin polymer films are summarized in Fig. 12 and Table 4. P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) thin films all exhibited distinct diffraction peaks at different annealing temperatures. Before and after annealing at 200 °C, the diffraction peaks both concentrated at the reciprocal vector q = 2.89 nm−1, corresponding to the lattice plane spacing d of 2.17 nm, for P(BDT-TT-HBT); the diffraction peaks concentrated at q = 2.99 and 2.98 nm−1, corresponding to d of 2.10 and 2.11 nm, for P(BDT-TT-FBT).

The diffraction peaks for both polymers increased after annealing at higher temperature. The enhancement of the X-ray diffraction peak intensity upon thermal annealing was due to the reorganization of the semiconducting polymer chains, as well as the growth of existing crystalline regions, during heating. Meanwhile, P(BDT-TT-FBT) films showed much stronger diffraction peaks, at various annealing temperatures, than P(BDT-TT-HBT). It should also be noted that P(BDT-TT-FBT) is more effective for charge transport through molecule chain packing because the π–π stacking distance (d100) of polymer films decreases from 2.17 nm to about 2.10 nm upon the introduction of fluorine substitutions. The variation trend of XRD properties of the polymer films with annealing temperature and the effect of fluorination conformed to those of AFM features and carrier mobility results.
Overall, these results demonstrate that better molecular alignment and more sufficient crystallization occurred in fluorinated thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridged conjugated polymer films. The enhancement of long-range order of the molecule chains was particularly favorable for carrier transport through the π–π stack structure in polymer films.
Conclusion
We designed and synthesized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridged D–π–A copolymers, P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT), using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as donor unit and benzothiadiazole or fluorinated benzothiadiazole as acceptor units, by palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. The introduction of fluorine substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit not only down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the organic semiconductor but also enhanced the intra- and intermolecular interactions of the resulting conjugated polymer. As a result, the fluorinated polymer exhibited superior open-circuit voltage but inferior short-circuit current because of its low solubility leading to un-optimized phase separation with PC71BM. The PCEs of the PSCs fabricated from P(BDT-TT-HBT) and P(BDT-TT-FBT) reached 4.37% and 3.56%, with a Voc of 0.72 V and 0.81 V, respectively. Hole mobilities of the PFETs based on these conjugated polymers increased gradually with the increase of annealing temperature. The fluorinated TT-bridged conjugated polymer showed much higher mobility (4.1 to 6.3 times) than the non-fluorinated polymer analogue, at various annealing temperatures.
