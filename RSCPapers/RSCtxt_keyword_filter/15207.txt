Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the AIE photovoltaic materials show decreased nonradiative energy loss during the energy conversion progress, with improvements in the open circuit voltage and device efficiency.
Reducing energy or voltage loss is imperative for all types of solar cells.1–8 Relative to their inorganic/hybrid counterparts, organic solar cells (OSCs) show larger energy losses of typically >0.53 eV;9 this is one of the main limitations when it comes to further improving the device efficiencies of OSCs. Nonradiative recombination in organic semiconductors under illumination dominates the large energy losses in OSCs.10 The electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies of OSCs are usually below 10−5–10−4%,11,12 which are much lower than those (10−3–10−1%) of solar cells based on inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, such as silicon,13 gallium arsenide,14 and halide perovskites.15 The low EL efficiencies of OSCs mean that there are relatively high nonradiative energy losses in devices.3 The EL efficiencies of OSCs depend on the presence of low-bandgap materials in the blend active layers of OSCs.3 The ideal value for the external electroluminescent quantum efficiency (EQEEL) in an OSC should be close to 20%.16
When conventional organic photovoltaic semiconductors are in the aggregated state, aromatic luminophores with planar and strong intermolecular interactions suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effects, meaning that emission is quenched, either partially or completely.17 ACQ effects in photovoltaic materials lead to relatively large nonradiative energy losses in OSCs, limiting the further enhancement of device efficiencies.18 Opposite to the ACQ phenomenon, aggregation-induced emission (AIE), coined by Tang in 2001, is another photophysical phenomenon associated with chromophore aggregation, in which luminogens show induced or enhanced emission due to aggregates formation.19 Photovoltaic materials with AIE features should have the potential to enhance EL efficiencies and decrease nonradiative recombination in semiconductors and devices, thus promising to push the upper limits of OSC device efficiencies toward the Shockley–Queisser limit (the theoretical limit of efficiency of an ideal single p–n junction solar cell). AIE molecules have been reported in contact layers of perovskite solar cells.20 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports to date on AIE photovoltaic materials designed for reducing nonradiative recombination and decreasing energy losses in OSCs.
Here we develop a facile chemical strategy to create photovoltaic materials with AIE properties via employing tetraphenylethylene (TPE) instead of one of the 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (IC-2F) end-groups of typical fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs), such as IDIC-4F21 and Y622 (chemical structures are shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). Differently to traditional FREAs, which show ACQ effects during the aggregation progress, the TPE-capped photovoltaic materials (IDIC-TPE and Y6-TPE, Schemes S1 and S2, ESI†) showed enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensities in the aggregated state. Furthermore, IDIC-TPE, with proper energy levels, was used in OSCs to obviously enhance the EL efficiencies of OSCs, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination and less nonradiative energy loss.
TPE is a typical propeller-like building block possessing remarkable AIE properties.23 In the aggregation of TPE-containing molecules, the intermolecular π–π stacking and intramolecular motion are restricted because of the highly twisted conformation of TPE, resulting in enhanced PL in the solid state.24 Several fluorophores with donor–acceptor (D–A) structures employing TPE as the electron-donating segment have been reported to show AIE features.15,25,26 Classical FREAs, taking IDIC-4F as an example, are constructed with a fused-core and two electron-withdrawing terminal groups (A–D1–A), in which face-to-face stacking is prone to occur, resulting in severe PL recombination in the aggregated state.27 As shown in Fig. 1a, we constructed IDIC-TPE with an A–D1–D2 structure via replacing one electron-withdrawing group, IC-2F (A), with the AIEgen TPE (D2). IDIC-TPE was synthesized via a facile route, as illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The fused ladder core (D1) was firstly linked with TPE-BPin through a Suzuki coupling reaction with a palladium catalyst to form an asymmetric donor structure. Then the electron-withdrawing group IC-2F reacted with the electron-donor part to offer the target molecule IDIC-TPE through Knoevenagel condensation. Y6-TPE with an A–D1–D2 structure, obtained via replacing one IC-2F group in the Y6 structure with a TPE terminal group, is illustrated in Scheme S2 (ESI†). The chemical structures and exact weights of IDIC-TPE and Y6-TPE have been confirmed via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MALDI-TOF mass spectra analysis. Compared with IDIC-4F, IDIC-TPE exhibits better solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and even hexane, which indicated that the TPE segment weakened the interaction of the conjugated cores.

(b) The absorption spectra of IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE in chloroform solution and as spin-coated films. (c) The photoluminescence spectra (PL) of IDIC-4F (excited at 675 nm for Sol. and 710 nm for Film) and IDIC-TPE (excited at 640 nm for Sol. and 680 nm for Film) in THF solution and as spin-coated films. 
The as-designed IDIC-TPE retained a similar planar conformation of the A–D1 segment as IDIC-4F, as confirmed based on density functional theory calculations (Fig. S2, ESI†). However, the TPE block offered large steric hindrance at the edge of the conjugated structure, indicating that IDIC-TPE could have different stacking formations to IDIC-4F. IDIC-4F had strong absorption in the range from 500 to 700 nm with absorption peaks located at 623 and 675 nm in chloroform (CF) solution (10−6 M), while the absorption spectrum of IDIC-4F film red-shifted to the range from 500 to 800 nm with absorption peaks located at 651 nm and 716 nm. However, as shown in Fig. 1b, IDIC-TPE displayed a single absorption peak at 668 nm in CF solution, and a single peak at 685 nm in film form. The double absorption peaks of IDIC-4F in both solution and as a film derived from its rigid structure and planar conformation, which induced strong intramolecular charge transfer effects,28 while the single absorption peak of IDIC-TPE was attributed to the inhibition of planar aggregation by the spiral-like TPE group. The PL properties of IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE are illustrated in Fig. 1c. Compared to IDIC-4F with an A–D1–A conjugated structure, IDIC-TPE with an A–D1–D2 structure delivered a redshifted emission peak in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (718 nm for IDIC-4F, 744 nm for IDIC-TPE). In thin film form, IDIC-TPE and IDIC-4F had similar emission peak positions at around 760 nm and 805 nm but the peaks showed different relative strengths, which indicated that the emission behavior in the aggregate state should be affected by the TPE segment.
To investigate whether IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE show AIE properties, IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE were dissolved in THF in which different volume fractions of water in THF solution (fw) were used to generate different aggregate states (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S3, ESI†). As fw increased from 0% to 30%, the PL intensity of IDIC-4F increased gradually accompanied by a double-emission-peak characteristic in the long wavelength region. Upon further increasing the water fraction in THF solution, the PL intensity of IDIC-4F decreased dramatically (Fig. 2c). The introduced water increased the solvent polarity and decreased the solubility of IDIC-4F, promoting the aggregation of IDIC-4F from single molecules to multimer clusters, resulting in PL profile variations. However, upon further increasing the water fraction in solution from 30% to 90%, the stronger intermolecular π–π stacking promoted the nonradiative deactivation process and controlled the emission behavior, with severe ACQ effects.29 For IDIC-TPE, the PL profile displayed a slight redshift and exhibited a tendency for the intensity to first decrease and then increase as the water fraction was increased (Fig. 2b). The decreased PL intensity of IDIC-TPE below fw = 50% could be attributed to twisted intramolecular charge transfer, which normally induces redshifted and weakened emission in molecules with distorted D–A architecture.30,31 When the water fraction is further increased to above 50%, IDIC-TPE showed AIE properties with increased aggregated-state emission (Fig. 2d). The TPE segment in IDIC-TPE favored a twisted conformation in the aggregated state, restricting various nonradiative pathways to enhance emission in the film state.32

Y6 is a FREA that was developed in 2019 for high-performance OSCs.22 Different from IDIC-4F with a centrosymmetric structure, Y6 has a crescent skeleton structure which can undergo intermolecular stacking through π–π interactions between the end groups, resulting in continuous and regular three-dimensional (3D) aggregation.33 The cross-stacking of Y6 decreases the nonradiative decay rate and offers long exciton lifetimes, which could result in enhanced aggregation emission.27 A monomer dispersion of Y6 in THF exhibited a wide PL spectrum with maximum emission at 785 nm (Fig. 3a). Upon adding water to the solution, the PL intensity of Y6 exhibited a tendency to first decrease and then increase as the water fraction increased. Y6-TPE showed an absorption peak at 710 nm, which is blue-shifted compared with Y6 (730 nm) in CF solution (Fig. S4, ESI†). Y6-TPE presented a weaker shoulder peak than Y6 at 680 nm, which showed the nonplanar conformation of Y6-TPE caused by the twisted TPE segment.28 Upon forming films, Y6-TPE presented absorption with a smaller redshift than that of Y6, which could originate from lower levels of J-aggregation in Y6-TPE film than in Y6 film.34 Y6-TPE molecules showed obvious AIE behavior, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Y6-TPE displayed weak emission in THF solution, benefitting from the free rotation of the TPE segment, while the PL began to significantly increase with the water fraction in THF solution, and PL intensity of Y6-TPE at fw = 90% was as much as 28 times the PL intensity at fw = 0% (Fig. 3c).

The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of IDIC-TPE (Fig. 4a and Fig. S5, ESI†) and Y6-TPE (Fig. S5, ESI†) were measured through the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The relatively high LUMO energy (−3.37 eV) of Y6-TPE mismatches with the LUMO energy of most high-performance donor materials. It should be noted here that the unexpectedly high LUMO energy level of Y6-TPE deserves to be further investigated in the future. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDIC-TPE were −5.47 and −3.90 eV, respectively, which are lower than those of typical polymer donors, such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6),21 making it a suitable electron acceptor for OSCs. Furthermore, we fabricated OSCs with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE/PDINN/Ag. Although the LUMO energy levels of IDIC-4F and IDIC-TPE are close, the OSC based on PM6:IDIC-4F delivered a much lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) (0.78 V) than that of the OSC based on PM6:IDIC-TPE (0.98 V) (Fig. 4b). However, the electron mobility of PM6:IDIC-TPE is 1.32 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6, ESI†), which would limit effective electron collection in PM6:IDIC-TPE based binary OSCs. Then, IDIC-TPE was also added to a PM6:IDIC-4F blend as the third component to optimize the OSC device efficiency. The ternary OSC with PM6:IDIC-TPE:IDIC-4F (1:0.1:1.2, w/w) showed an improved VOC value of 0.83 V compared with that (0.78 V) of the control binary device based on PM6:IDIC-4F (1:1.2, w/w) (Fig. 4c and Table S1, ESI†). Relatively large nonradiative recombination loss is one of the main factors behind the large voltage losses in high-efficiency OSCs. The VOC loss in an OSC caused by nonradiative recombination can be analyzed according to the equation  (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and EQEEL is the electroluminescence radiative quantum efficiency of the solar cell). As discussed above, AIE properties can inhibit nonradiative recombination during IDIC-TPE aggregation, which indicates that an OSC employing IDIC-TPE could display a relatively high EQEEL value. For the PM6:IDIC-4F-based binary OSC, the measured EQEEL value is 8.8 × 10−7, representing a relatively large nonradiative VOC loss of 0.36 V; in contrast, the device based on PM6:IDIC-TPE showed a roughly two-orders-of-magnitude higher EQEEL value of 3.6 × 10−5, representing a much lower nonradiative VOC loss of 0.26 V (Fig. 4d). Although the PM6:Y6-TPE-based OSC showed a poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.11% due to the mismatched energy levels of PM6 and Y6-TPE, Y6-TPE as an additive in the PM6:Y6 blend still improved VOC by 5 mV, resulting in a slightly enhanced PCE of 16.63% (Table S2, ESI†), relative to a control binary device based on PM6:Y6. These results confirmed that photovoltaic materials with AIE properties could reduce nonradiative recombination, inhibit VOC losses, and boost the device efficiencies of OSCs.

In summary, we introduced a facile method to develop or enhance AIE properties in FREAs via TPE substitution. Relative to devices based on traditional FREAs, OSCs employing the designed FREAs with AIE properties herein showed much higher EQEEL values (increases approaching 2 orders of magnitude), reduced nonradiative recombination, decreased nonradiative VOC loss of 0.1 V, and boosted device efficiencies. Our study indicates that designing organic photovoltaic materials with AIE properties, named AIE photovoltaic materials, is a promising approach for pushing the upper limits of OSC device efficiencies and can create a new direction for realizing lower energy/VOC losses in high-performance OSCs. Some electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorine, cyano, imide, and other groups, can be further attached to the TPE moiety to reduce energy mismatches between the designed acceptors and existing high-performance donors.
