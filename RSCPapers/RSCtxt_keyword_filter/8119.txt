    , Accepted 11th May 2020First published on 12th May 2020AbstractInorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention in recent years due to their excellent thermal stability. The CsPbI2Br PSCs, combining the merits of stable CsPbBr3 and efficient CsPbI3, demonstrate tremendous application potential. In this work, n–i–p structured inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs are fabricated using ZnO as the electron transport material (ETM) and dopant-free PBDB-T and its derivatives as the hole transport materials (HTMs). Alkylsilyl-substituted PBDB-T (i.e.PBDB-T-Si) based devices demonstrate the best efficiency of 15.60% (compared to 14.20% of the PBDB-T based reference device) with an ultrahigh fill factor over 84% due to the deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels, superior hole mobility and quasi-ohmic contact characteristics. However, fluorine- and chlorine-substituted PBDB-T (i.e.PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl) based devices exhibit enhanced open circuit voltages but decreased short circuit current densities due to the unbalanced hole extraction and large leakage current at the interface, giving moderate efficiencies of 14.87 and 14.03%, respectively. Our work provides a sophisticated analysis of various optoelectronic properties of polymeric HTMs and points out that the quasi-ohmic/ohmic contact plays a critical role in determining device performance.
Introduction
Emerging photovoltaic cells, such as organic solar cells (OSCs),1 quantum-dot solar cells2 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs),3 utilize clean solar energy to generate electrical energy and have attracted extensive attention around the world. The best efficiency of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs has skyrocketed with power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25.2%4 due to the merits of tunable optoelectronic properties, excellent solution processability and economic material resources.5–8 Nonetheless, the intrinsic instability of organic components in hybrid perovskites impedes the further commercialization of PSCs. Therefore, thermostable inorganic perovskites obtained by replacing organic cations with caesium (Cs+) have been introduced to withstand extreme thermal conditions over 300 °C.9,10
Although CsPbBr3 PSCs possess exceptionable thermal and moisture stability, they exhibit relatively low PCEs of less than 11% due to their limited absorption spectrum (below 550 nm).11–13 The CsPbI3-based PSCs can acquire considerable efficiency, however the unsatisfactory instability of CsPbI3 due to its heavily deflected Goldschmidt tolerance factor (0.81) can easily convert CsPbI3 from the black α-phase to the non-perovskite δ-phase under nitrogen and ambient atmospheric conditions.14 In consequence, inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br, combining the advantages of the superior stability of CsPbBr3 and high efficiency of CsPbI3, has been introduced to achieve efficiencies over 16%.15–18 Nevertheless, most highly efficient PSCs employed 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluoren (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTM,16–18 which necessarily needs additives of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) to enhance hole mobility and conductivity, and the accompanied hygroscopic and corrosive nature of the spiro-OMeTAD layer can degrade the underlying perovskite films over time.19 Moreover, the undesired long-term oxidation process under an ambient atmosphere further complicates the fabrication process of spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs and enhances the possibility of perovskite degradation, especially for the iodine-rich inorganic perovskites.20,21
Toward this end, researchers have explored a series of dopant-free organic HTMs to fabricate efficient and stable PSCs. Small molecules, such as TAPC,22 Trux-OMeTAD,23 KR321,24 and mDPA-DBTP,25 integrating the advantages of a simple structure and a facile synthesis procedure have been reported. However, the instability and interactive properties of small molecules lead to a quick decrease of device performance, which is not conducive to the long-term and robust stability required for the commercialization of PSCs. Compared to small molecules, conjugated polymers possess relatively higher stability and charge mobility due to the conjugation and π–π stacking of polymeric chains, and the versatile electron-rich functional groups of conjugated backbones and side chains can effectively passivate traps within the surface and grain boundary of the perovskite films.26–31 These polymers containing electron-rich Lewis bases, such as pyridine,32 thiophene33 and amine groups,34 have all been implemented to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. Recently, a π-conjugated polymer, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl)-benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T), which is a typical p-type electron donor used in high efficiency organic solar cells,35 was introduced into PSCs to passivate traps by its electron-rich O atoms, elevate perovskite film quality and enhance charge transfer at interfaces, finally acquiring an efficiency of 19.38% in hybrid PSCs.36 Xue et al.37 employed a series of PBDB-T derivatives as HTMs in PbS colloidal quantum dot solar cells, and the PBDB-T-2F-based devices obtained the best efficiency of 11.2% due to the facilitated charge transfer at the interface of PbS/PBDB-T-2F, demonstrating that PBDB-T derivatives are effective HTMs. Xiao et al.38 synthesized a series of squaraine-based polymeric HTMs for CsPbI2Br PSCs to achieve a PCE of 15.5% benefiting from the passivation effect and high mobility of these HTMs. Thus, the meticulous design and modification of polymeric HTMs will lead to the steady progress of efficient and stable PSCs.28,39
Herein, we fabricated n–i–p type inorganic PSCs with a structure of glass/ITO/ZnO/CsPbI2Br/HTMs/MoO3/Ag using PBDB-T and its derivatives as HTMs. The reference PBDB-T-based CsPbI2Br device obtained an efficiency of 14.20%. After the introduction of fluorine and chlorine atoms, the corresponding PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl based devices obtained an enhanced VOC due to the deeper HOMO energy levels but reduced JSC arising from the large leakage current, giving moderate PCEs of 14.87 and 14.03%, respectively. Nevertheless, the CsPbI2Br device employing PBDB-T-Si as the HTM maintained the high JSC of the PBDB-T-based device and the high VOC of the PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl based devices, thus obtaining a champion efficiency of 15.60% with a high FF over 84%. We attribute the excellent efficiency of the PBDB-T-Si-based CsPbI2Br device to the deep HOMO energy level, superior hole mobility and quasi-ohmic contact characteristic of the PBDB-T-Si HTM. Our work provides a significant insight into the factors of HTMs that determine the efficiency of perovskite photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) and PEDOT:PSS (Clevios AI 4083) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology, China. Caesium bromide (CsBr, 99.99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PBDB-T (Mn: 32 kDa, PDI: 2.5), PBDB-T-2Cl (Mn: 38 kDa, PDI: 2.5) and PBDB-T-2F (Mn: 43 kDa, PDI: 2.3) were obtained from Solarmer Materials Inc., Beijing. PBDB-T-Si (Mn: 33 kDa, PDI: 2.0) was synthesized according to our previous work.40 Zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.99%) was purchased from Aladdin.
Device fabrication
Unless otherwise stated, all fabrication processes were performed according to our previous work41,42 The ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving 200 mg of zinc acetate and 56 μL of ethanolamine in 2 mL of 2-methoxyethanol, which was stirred for at least 12 h before use, then it was spin-coated on ITO and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 1 M PbI2:CsBr (1:1) in DMF:DMSO (1:9) and stirring overnight on a hotplate set at 60 °C. Then, the precursor was filtered and deposited on metal oxide at 1500 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 30 s, then it was blown by a fan for 60 s to remove residual solvent, and finally it was annealed at 50 °C for 30 s until the perovskite films turned light brown and further annealed at 240 °C for 60 s to form a black CsPbI2Br film. 5 mg mL−1 polymer dissolved in chlorobenzene was deposited on the perovskite at 1000 rpm for 40 s. The deposition of all perovskite and polymer films was performed in a N2-filled glovebox.
Characterization
Unless otherwise stated, all the characterization methods and techniques can be found in our previous work.41,43 We used a quantum chemical method that combined density functional theory (DFT) to simulate the changes in electronic structure and crystal structure of PBDB-T and its derivatives. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-corrected functional PBE with a DNP basis set was used to optimize the ground-state geometries and calculate the electrostatic potentials, population analyses and energy levels using Dmol3 code in Materials Studio for all PBDB-T series. Subsequently, the crystal structure prediction of the optimized molecules was carried out by employing the PBE exchange–correlation energy function and the Compass II force field in the polymorph module of Materials Studio. The five most probable space groups (P21/C, P1, P2121, P21 and P2/c) were restricted. Then, the crystal structures with the lowest energies were selected and depicted as stacking modes, where the π–π stacking distance can be identified.
Results and discussion
The conjugated polymers PBDB-T, PBDB-T-2Cl, PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-Si (see Fig. 1a) have mainly been employed as p-type electron donors in organic solar cells.40,44–46 The chemical structure of PBDB-T is composed of 2-alkylthiophene-substituted benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b0] dithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c0]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units. In order to enhance its molecular order and downshift the HOMO energy levels, halogen atoms, i.e. fluorine or chlorine, and alkyl or alkylsilyl side chains are introduced to the conjugated side groups of the BDT unit to synthesize PBDB-T-2F, PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-Si. The energy levels of these polymeric HTM materials are shown in Fig. 1(b) and summarized in Table 1. The deeper HOMO energy levels of PBDB-T-2Cl (−5.51 eV), PBDB-T-2F (−5.47 eV) and PBDB-T-Si (−5.45 eV) than that of PBDB-T (−5.28 eV) (determined experimentally by cyclic voltammograms in literature works) enable better alignment with CsPbI2Br, indicating that a higher VOC can be obtained in the corresponding devices.37,44,46Fig. 1(c) shows the normalized absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these polymeric HTM layers. Compared to PBDB-T-Si with a blue-shifted absorption spectrum, PBDB-T, PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F also have obvious double peaks at ∼580 and ∼620 nm, which can be ascribed to the π–π* transition along the conjugated backbones of these polymers and an interchain π–π* transition arising from the π–π stacking of backbones, respectively.35 Meanwhile, the inconspicuous peak of PBDB-T-Si in the PL spectrum at around 750 nm is consistent with the result of the absorption spectrum.

We proceeded to compute the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTMs using density functional theory (DFT).47 As shown in Fig. 2(a–d), all HTMs exhibit similar electron delocalization properties, and the LUMO and HOMO electrons delocalize around the BDD and BDT units, respectively. The corresponding computed HOMO energy levels are −4.54 eV (PBDB-T), −4.70 eV (PBDB-T-2Cl), −4.68 eV (PBDB-T-2F) and −4.71 eV (PBDB-T-Si), which is consistent with the tendency of energy levels shown in Fig. 1(b) determined from experiments. In order to further investigate the stacking properties of these conjugated polymers, we measured the dihedral angle of different segments in molecules and the π–π stacking distances between adjacent molecules. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the dihedral angle of PBDB-T-Si (3.4°) is lower than those of PBDB-T (6.4°), PBDB-T-2Cl (7.0°) and PBDB-T-2F (6.4°), indicating a better planarity of the PBDB-T-Si molecule. As shown in Fig. 2(e–h), the nearly planar conjugated backbone of PBDB-T and its derivatives forms preferential face-on intermolecular π–π stacks,37 and the decreased π–π stacking distances from PBDB-T (3.6 Å) to PBDB-T-2Cl (3.5 Å), PBDB-T-2F (3.5 Å) and PBDB-T-Si (3.4 Å) indicate stronger π–π stacking within PBDB-T-Si, and therefore enhanced structural order.39,40,48 This enhanced structural order leads to the highest hole mobility of PBDB-T-Si (6.75 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1), in comparison to those of PBDB-T, PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F (3.06 × 10−4, 4.57 × 10−4 and 5.68 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1, respectively). The decreased dihedral angle and π–π stacking distance of PBDB-T-Si are in accordance with the literature finding that the introduction of alkylsilyl can effectively improve the σ*(Si)–π*(C) bond interaction, therefore yielding better structural and steric properties.43,44,49

We continued to fabricate n–i–p type inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs using ZnO as the ETM and the aforementioned dopant-free polymers as the HTMs, with a device structure shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 3(a) plots the best J−V curves of the corresponding devices in reverse scans, with their parameters summarized in Table 1. The PBDB-T-based device exhibits a maximum PCE (PCEmax) of 14.20%, which is associated with a VOC of 1.11 V, a JSC of 15.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 82.5%. After replacing PBDB-T by PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F, the corresponding devices exhibit an increased VOC of ca. 1.20 V, but a decreased JSC of 14.55 and 14.81 mA cm−2, a comparable FF of 79.7 and 83.7%, and consequently a moderate PCE of 14.03 and 14.87%, respectively. Encouragingly, the champion device of PBDB-T-Si shows nearly all the best photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 15.60%, a VOC of 1.20 V, a JSC of 15.47 mA cm−2 and a FF of 84.0%. The elevated VOC of PBDB-T-2Cl, PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-Si based devices arises from the more favorable cascade energy level alignment between CsPbI2Br and the polymeric HTMs. Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S2 (ESI†) plot the best J–V curves of various PSCs from reverse and forward scans, with a certain degree of hysteresis observed for all CsPbI2Br PSCs, a phenomenon that is widely reported in the literature.17,50–52 The hysteresis indices (defined as PCERS–PCEFS/PCERS) of these devices decrease from 21.3% (PBDB-T), 25.9% (PBDB-T-2Cl), and 26.8% (PBDB-T-2F) to 12.4% (PBDB-T-Si), supporting that using PBDB-T-Si not only leads to the highest efficiency but also the least hysteresis. This outstanding hysteresis of CsPbI2Br requires further investigation via bulk or interfacial modifications to reduce defects and balance charge extraction.

(c) J–V characteristic curves and the corresponding logarithmic plots of hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM (∼20 nm)/MoO3/Ag. (d) J–V characteristic curves of hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM (∼150 nm)/MoO3/Ag. 
In order to further investigate the contributors of the enhanced performance and mutative hysteresis, we fabricated hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/MoO3/Ag to probe hole injection and extraction properties using the actual polymer thickness in devices (∼20 nm), which could reflect the charge transport state of polymers in actual PSC devices. Fig. 3(c) shows the J–V curves of these hole-only devices employing an applied voltage from −4 to 4 V, with the negative and positive voltage regions representing hole injection and extraction properties from polymer to metal electrode, respectively. The asymmetric J–V curves of PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F based devices indicate that the hole injection is much slower than hole extraction in PSCs, especially in the PBDB-T-2Cl-based device, and this is extremely likely associated with the reduced JSC and enhanced hysteresis. The PBDB-T-based device shows a symmetric J–V curve, suggesting relatively balanced hole injection and extraction, but the diode-like J–V curve in both the negative and positive voltage regions (also observed for PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F) represents Schottky-type contacts on both sides of the HTMs. Furthermore, the largest current density of the PBDB-T-Si-based device suggests the most effective hole injection and extraction abilities among these HTMs. Meanwhile, the nearly linear J–V curve of the PBDB-T-Si-based hole-only device indicates quasi-ohmic contact between PBDB-T-Si and its adjacent layers. The mobilities of PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F, calculated using SCLC theory based on the dark J–V curves of hole-only devices again but having a much thicker polymer layer (∼150 nm) to ensure precise measurements of mobilities (shown in Fig. 3(d)), are higher than that of PBDB-T but lower than that of PBDB-T-Si (see summary in Table 1), which is quite different from the trend of hole injection/extraction properties. We envisage that although the mobility of the HTM is an important parameter for efficient PSCs, the ohmic or quasi-ohmic (as is the case of this work) contact at the electrode interface plays a significant role in enhancing the device efficiency. Therefore, the quasi-ohmic contact characteristic and the highest hole mobility of PBDB-T-Si decrease the hole transport barrier and balance the charge transport in PSCs, contributing to enhanced efficiency and reduced hysteresis.53,54
Then, we plotted the dark J–V curves of PSCs to investigate the leakage current from carrier recombination and the relation to hole transport barrier.41 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F based devices show one order larger current density at −1 V than those of PBDB-T and PBDB-T-Si based devices, indicating a smaller shunt resistance and therefore a larger leakage current in the former devices. This result agrees with the results of unbalanced charge transport (see Fig. 3(c)) and reduced JSC (see Table 1) in PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T-2F based PSCs. We further investigated the bulk and interfacial transport properties of PSCs under 1 sun illumination from 1 MHz to 100 Hz of the impedance spectra.43 As shown in Fig. 4(b), the impedance plots of all devices exhibit typical semicircles and can be well fitted with the inserted equivalent circuit model. The fitting parameters Rs, Rrec and CPE are the series resistance, recombination resistance and constant phase element, respectively. The Rrec of the corresponding device increases from PBDB-T-2Cl (4440 Ω) to PBDB-T-2F (4814 Ω), PBDB-T (7407 Ω) and PBDB-T-Si (8184 Ω), indicating that a slower recombination rate occurs in devices contributing to a higher performance.

The steady-state PL spectra of the ZnO/CsPbI2Br/HTM films were used to evaluate the charge transport properties. The asymmetric PL peaks (see Fig. 4(c)) arise from the weak contribution of polymer PL ranging from 600 to 900 nm. The most efficient PL quenching of the ZnO/CsPbI2Br/PBDB-T-Si film indicates the fastest charge transport at the interface of CsPbI2Br/PBDB-T-Si, and PBDB-T-2F shows a comparable quenching effect with PBDB-T-Si. The time-resolved PL lifetime spectra (see Fig. 4(d)) show the same trend as the steady-state PL spectra, with the ZnO/CsPbI2Br/PBDB-T-Si film illustrating the shortest lifetime as a result of the most efficient charge transfer from perovskite to charge transport materials.
We finally examined the photostability of perovskite films capped with and w/o polymeric HTMs upon continuous 1 sun illumination under 20–25% RH in an ambient atmosphere by recording the corresponding evolutions of the PL spectra (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The continuously increasing PL emission wavelength results from the photo-induced halide phase separation (especially in an ambient atmosphere), which has been reported in many mixed halide PSCs.55–59 After 60 min of illumination, the PL emission wavelength of ZnO/CsPbI2Br increases from 649 to 667 nm, and the final emission wavelength decreases from 665 and 661 nm with the coverage of PBDB-T-2Cl and PBDB-T, respectively. After depositing PBDB-T-Si and PBDB-T-2F on the perovskite films, the PL emission wavelengths only shift from 649 to 658 nm, indicating improved resistance towards photo-induced halide phase separation. The excess carriers induced by light illumination or applied voltage could cause the degradation of perovskite films,60,61 and the effective charge transport between PBDB-T-Si and CsPbI2Br is beneficial to resisting halide phase separation, which is well consistent with the evolution of PL quenching and emission wavelength results.
Conclusions
In summary, we have employed a series of dopant-free conjugated polymers as hole transport materials in n–i–p structured inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs. The introduction of alkylsilyl groups into the polymeric HTM, which produces PBDB-T-Si, not only leads to a deeper HOMO energy level to acquire a higher VOC but also improves the planarity of conjugated backbones to reduce the π–π stacking distance, thus enhancing the hole mobility and forming quasi-ohmic contact between PBDB-T-Si and the electrode to facilitate charge carrier transport. Finally, the PBDB-T-Si-based champion CsPbI2Br device exhibits a remarkable performance of 15.60%, much higher than that of the PBDB-T-based reference device with a PCE of 14.20%. Although deep HOMO energy levels and high mobilities of PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl are beneficial, the Schottky contact is inferior, which leads to unbalanced hole injection/extraction, a large leakage current and therefore a decreased JSC in the devices. Our work provides a sophisticated analysis of various optoelectronic properties of polymeric HTMs and points out that the quasi-ohmic/ohmic contact is more effective for enhancing device performance.
