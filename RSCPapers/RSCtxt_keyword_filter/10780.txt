    , Accepted 19th November 2018First published on 20th November 2018AbstractFour new hole transporting materials (HTMs), M107–M110, based on thieno[3,2-b]indole cores have been designed and employed in perovskite solar cells. The perovskite solar cells based on M109 exhibit a leading efficiency of 18.14% with a photovoltage over 1.11 V.
Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) are believed to be a promising photovoltaic technology owing to their low costs and high efficiencies.1,2 PSCs have a similar sandwich structure to dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The absorber layer (perovskite) is set in the middle of the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transporting materials (HTMs). Small-molecule HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been widely used in n–i–p cells due to its reproducible and highly efficient properties. Nevertheless, spiro-OMeTAD still has some drawbacks including instability and high cost. To find alternative HTMs for PSCs, different HTMs such as inorganic HTMs,3 small molecules,4–21 and polymers22 have been developed.
Recently, linear, star shaped and branched small-molecule HTMs which are less costly have attracted wide attention.4 Most often, the performance of small-molecule HTMs is closely related to the structure of the central core, which significantly affects the hole-carrier mobility of the HTM layer. It is worth noting that strong intermolecular π–π stacking has been demonstrated to be key for improving hole-carrier mobility. Studies have revealed that electron-rich fused heterocycles such as carbazole and benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene not only favor π–π stacking but are also beneficial to hole extraction.6 Therefore, seeking new electron-rich fused heterocycles with large π-extended conjugation is important.
Thieno[3,2-b]indole has recently been used as a functional material in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The thieno[3,2-b]indole could induce an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect due to a strong electron-donating ability23 and coplanarity,24 leading to an enhancement of photovoltaic performance in OPVs and DSSCs. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the thieno[3,2-b]indole has rarely been used in small-molecule HTMs for PSCs.
In this work, two thieno[3,2-b]indole derivatives, i.e. 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (MPTI) and 4-hexyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (HTI), were employed to construct four new HTMs, M107–110 (Fig. 1). To better understand the uniqueness of the thieno[3,2-b]indole cores, we also prepared reference HTM X257 (Fig. 1), which contains the carbazole core. M107 and M108 contain the HTI core, whereas M109 and M110 incorporate the MPTI unit. We also modified the peripheral donor to tune the HOMO/LUMO level of the HTMs. M108 and M110 contain two different donors, i.e. bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (BMPA) and bismethoxy substituted triphenylamine (BMTPA), while M107 and M109 have two BMTPA units. Significant changes in the energy level and hole-transporting properties occur as a result of the core and donor modifications. We systematically observed that the PSCs based on M107/108 gave poor performances compared to M109/110, demonstrating that the MPTI core outperforms the HTI core. Remarkably, the combination of MPTI core and two BMTPA donors endowed the M109 with superior hole mobility and an appropriate energy level alignment. It turned out that M109 exhibited the best efficiency among these HTMs (M107–M110 and X25), and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.14% was achieved, with an impressive photovoltage of 1.11 V.

As presented in Scheme S1 (ESI†), our synthesis commenced with the coupling of compound 1 with 1,4-dibromo-2-nitrobenzene. Compound 3 worked as the key intermediate for the cyclization and can be easily synthesized through the Suzuki reaction. The following cyclization of compound 3 proceeded smoothly to afford compound 4. Compound 7 can be synthesized through a similar approach. Finally, compound 4 or 7 react with 1-bromohexane or 1-bromo-4-methoxybenzene to give M107–110. Note that the key compound 3 was synthesized in 70% yield, which is much higher than compound 6 (40%). Therefore, the synthetic cost of M107/M109 is lower than that of M108/M110. The details for synthesis and 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Fig. S1–S9) measurements are provided in the ESI.†
The absorption spectra of M107–110 (dissolved in THF) show one distinct absorption band, ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the peripheral donor to the central core. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of M107 and M109 are located at 405 and 403 nm, respectively. The λmax of M108 and M110, on the other hand, are red-shifted to 410 and 412 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a) due to decreased energy gaps (Table S1 and Fig. S10, ESI†). By comparison, the λmax of X25 is only 335 nm, indicating a weaker ICT.

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was further carried out to investigate the HOMO levels of the HTMs (Fig. 2b). The HOMOs of M107 (−5.12 eV) and M109 (−5.14 eV) are much lower than those of M108 (−4.89 eV) and M110 (−4.93 eV) due to the donor difference (Fig. 2c). The upshifted oxidation potential of M107/109 compared to X25 (−5.22 eV) indicates that thieno[3,2-b]indole increases the electron-donating ability of the HTMs, which is beneficial to charge transport in PSCs.
Besides the energy levels, the hole-mobility of these HTMs (without dopant) are recorded (Fig. 2d), and details about the measurements are presented in the ESI.† As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), M107 (1.57 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and M109 (1.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) containing two BMTPA donors display much higher hole mobilities than those of M108 (9.75 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1) and M110 (4.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). We attribute the enhancement of hole mobility in large part to the reduced steric hindrance between the benzene ring and the core.10 As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), there is increased steric hindrance between the thieno[3,2-b]indole and BMPA group in M110, leading to a larger dihedral angle. In contrast, M109 exhibits a more planar structure than M110 due to the introduction of one benzene unit. This planar structure of M109 is beneficial to intermolecular π–π stacking and therefore improves the hole mobility.6 Meanwhile, we found that the core could also affect the hole mobility of the HTMs. M109 and M110, featuring MPTI cores, exhibit slightly improved hole mobilities compared to those of M107 and M108 with HTI cores, respectively. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), M109 incorporating two BMTPA units and the MPTI core exhibits the highest hole-mobility (1.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) among these HTMs, in comparison to a mobility of 1.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the carbazole-based HTM X25.
The frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of the M107–110 were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The isodensity surface plots of the HOMOs and LUMOs for M107–110 are presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The HOMOs of M107–110 are delocalized throughout the entire molecule. In contrast, the LUMOs of M107–110 are largely located on the MPTI/HTI core. Apparently, intramolecular charge transfer takes place from the peripheral BMPA or BMTPA groups to the central thieno[3,2-b]indole cores.6
We further carried out differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S13, ESI†) to unveil the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of M107–110. The Tg values of M109 and M110 are 117.65 °C and 104.39 °C, respectively. Comparing the Tg values of them with those of M107 (84.43 °C) and M108 (66.69 °C) shows that the replacement of MPTI by HTI leads to a decrease in Tg of about 30 °C. Apparently, the alkyl on the thieno[3,2-b]indole may significantly reduce the stability of the resultant devices. Therefore, M109 and M110 are more stable than M107 and M108 because the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline phase is liable to cause performance degradation in PSCs.25 On the other hand, the Tg of M109 (117.65 °C) is slightly higher than that of M110 (104.39 °C) due to extended π-conjugation. Moreover, a similar Tg is observed for X25 (123.73 °C) as compared to M109. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements revealed that HTMs including M107–110 and X25 start decomposing over 410 °C (Fig. S14, ESI†), indicating a good thermal stability of these thieno[3,2-b]indole based HTMs.
The influence of different thieno[3,2-b]indole cores on the transporting properties of the HTMs was evaluated by PSCs. We fabricated devices with a configuration consisting of fluorine tin oxide (FTO)/SnO2 + PCBM/Perovskite/M107–110/Au by a one-step anti-solvent method. The fabrication details are given in the ESI.† All HTMs could form a smooth and compact spin-coated film (Fig. S15, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing PSCs based on M107–110, X25 and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 3a, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1.

The introduction of the amorphous SnO2 layer suppressed hysteresis (Fig. S16, ESI†) and improved the PCE of devices due to a deep conduction band and high electron transporting efficiency.26 The champion devices based on M109 and M110 showed PCEs of 18.14% and 15.32% respectively, which are improvements compared to those of M107 (PCE = 16.88%) and M108 (PCE = 13.68%), respectively. It can be concluded that MPTI outperforms HTI in terms of the photovoltaic performance of HTMs in PSCs. On the other hand, the minor structural difference between the donors also dramatically influences the photovoltaic performance of these HTMs. The PCE of M107 and M109 based PSCs are significantly higher than those of M108 and M110, respectively. M109 exhibits the best photovoltaic performance among these HTMs. The best PSC based on M109 exhibits a short circuit current density (JSC) of 22.71 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 1.11 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, leading to a PCE of 18.14%. The histograms of PCEs for M107–110 based PSCs are shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). An average PCE of 16.27% can be achieved for M109 and over 66% of the fabricated devices can yield a PCE of higher than 16%. It is noteworthy that PSCs based on M109 gave a comparable efficiency to the control device using the spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 18.42%). In contrast, the PSC using X25 exhibits a lower efficiency of 17.09% with a JSC of 22.40 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.09 V, and a FF of 0.70. It should be noted that the PCE of M109 is comparable to or better than other similar linear HTMs with electron-rich cores such as phenothiazine and silolothiophene (Table S3, ESI†). To determine the reliability of the devices, the stabilized efficiency was measured at a constant bias at the maximum power point. As shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†), PSCs based on M109 and M110 exhibited highly stable steady-state photovoltaic performances, with a steady PCE of 17.9% at a bias of 0.902 V and 15.2% at a bias of 0.839 V, respectively. These photovoltaic results suggest that the 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole is an efficient electron-rich core for small-molecule HTMs.
It should be noted that a remarkable photovoltage of 1.11 V was realized using M109 as the HTM, which is even more than those of spiro-OMeTAD and X25, both HTMs display a VOC of 1.09 V. An impressive VOC of 1.15 V was recorded (Fig. 3b) for M109, which is the highest VOC for all studied devices in this work. A statistical analysis of the photovoltage of the fabricated samples is shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†). In addition, the M109-based device exhibited excellent stability with 80% of the initial efficiency retained after 900 h under an inert atmosphere (Fig. S20, ESI†).
The JSC value is significantly enhanced for M107 (22.55 mA cm−2) and M109 (22.71 mA cm−2) based PSCs compared to those of M108 (21.18 mA cm−2) and M110 (21.55 mA cm−2) due to enhanced hole mobility. The PSCs based on M107 and M109 showed higher incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) than those of M108 and M110 (Fig. S21, ESI†), which is in agreement with the trend of experimental results. In order to better understand the difference in the photocurrent, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded. The emission peak of the perovskite was significantly quenched as the studied HTMs were deposited. As presented in Fig. 4a, M107/109 show higher quenching efficiencies than M108/110. A previous study suggested that there are electrostatic interactions between the methoxy group and the perovskite surface.27 In the cases of M109 and M110, the MPTI core contains an –OMe group at the central part of the molecule, which could enhance the HTM/perovskite interactions. Thus, holes from the perovskite could inject more effectively into M107/109. Moreover, the hole transfer yield of X25 (93.8%) is lower than that of M109 (97.5%). An increased JSC for the PSC based on 109 occurs as a result of the stronger hole collection capability at the perovskite/HTMs interface.

As presented in Table 1, M107 and M109 have superior photovoltages compared to M108 and M110, respectively. It can be clearly appreciated that the average VOC values are increased when M109 is introduced into PSCs (Fig. S18, ESI†). The higher VOC values obtained for M107/109 compared to M108/110 could be justified by deeper HOMO energies for the former. Nevertheless, the photovoltage was not determined solely by the measured HOMO level. For example, X25 shows slightly decreased VOC compared to M109, despite possessing a lower HOMO level relative to the latter. To obtain further insight into the origin of the VOC for these HTMs, the open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) was measured. Fig. 4b shows photovoltage decay in the order of M108 > M110 > M107 > M109, the sequence of which is in accordance with charge recombination. However, it can be observed that PSCs based on M109 present higher VOC values at longer times than X25, indicating that the electron lifetimes are increased. The possible sulfur–iodine interactions at the M109–perovskite interface may favour hole extraction,1 which contributes to increased electron lifetimes. Therefore, in the case of X25, VOC is mostly governed by interfacial charge recombination rather than the HOMO level.
In summary, four new hole transporting materials based on thieno[3,2-b]indole cores have been designed and prepared. The arylamine donor as well as the substituent group on the thieno[3,2-b]indole have relevant effects on the hole transporting properties of HTMs. The superior performance of M109 compared to other HTMs in the PSCs is mainly attributed to the improved hole mobility, lower HOMO level and balanced charge transport efficacy. The PSCs based on M109 demonstrate an outstanding VOC of 1.11 V and a high PCE of 18.14%. These results suggest that the thieno[3,2-b]indole derivatives are promising organic materials for designing HTMs.
