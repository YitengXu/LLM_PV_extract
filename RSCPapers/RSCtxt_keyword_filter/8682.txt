    , Accepted 22nd August 2016First published on 23rd August 2016AbstractTwo acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) conjugated molecules DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T, using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the A-unit, ethynylene bridge flanked benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (E-BDT) as the central D-unit, and different 4,8-substitutions on the BDT were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reactions for solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs). The insertion of electron-withdrawing ethynylene bridges (sp hybridization) in the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T molecules leads to planar and enlarged aromatic skeletons, larger band gaps, and deeper HOMO levels. 4,8-Dithienyl substitution on BDT in DPP-E-BDT-T results in additional conjugation extension to give a slightly smaller band gap compared to the 4,8-dialkoxy substitution in target molecules. Bulk heterojunction solar cells using DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T as the donor materials and fullerene acceptor showed a high open-circuit voltage of 0.89 V and moderate current densities of 10.9 mA cm−2. Besides, quite high fill factors (73.6%) could be obtained. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.12% were obtained for DPP-E-BDT-T blends, which is the highest efficiency among small molecules based on DPP and BDT units. In active layer fabrication, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a solvent additive and subsequent thermal annealing treatment was also employed. We saw that these combined treatments led to balanced hole and electron transports, with values around 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the active layers. These results demonstrated that ethynylene bridges in small molecule donors are quite useful, both in tuning the electronic structure and in defining the thin film morphology, thus would be a promising method to enhance photovoltaic performances of the resulting materials.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising renewable energy sources, which have received much attention because of their low cost, lightweight, and high mechanical flexibility.1,2 Progressive achievements have been made in the development of polymer donors for the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer in OSCs.3–5 Meanwhile, donor materials based on solution-processed π-conjugated small molecules (SMs) have also been quickly developed in recent years.6–12 For these small molecules, a well-defined molecular structure, easy purification, and less batch-to-batch variation are the key advantages. Currently, solution-processed OSCs based on SM donors have shown notable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%.13
An acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) conjugation skeleton is an important molecular design for highly efficient SM donors.14–19 For example, Bazan and Heeger et al. have reported a PCE of 8.94% for SM-OSCs based on pyridathiadiazole and dithienosilole A–D–A materials.20–23 Chen et al. have developed a series of A–D–A SM donors based on oligothiophenes or benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) with top PCEs.13,24,25
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), an aromatic heterocycle with two fused electron-deficient lactams, possesses good photo-physical stability and strong light-absorbing and electron-withdrawing abilities. It has been introduced as an important A-unit to construct A–D–A SM donors.26–31 For SM donors with a basic DPP–BDT–DPP skeleton, 4,8-dithienyl substitutions on the BDT unit could show PCEs up to 5.79%.32,33 Thereafter, DPP–BDT–DPP SM donors with longer π-conjugated skeletons have also been demonstrated. In the reports of end-group functionalizations of the DPP on DPP–BDT–DPP skeleton, it was found that PCEs could be slightly enhanced up to 6%.34,35 Another strategy of inserting conjugation bridges between DPP and BDT, however, led to low device performances.36,37 It is a challenging work to further enhance the efficiency of SM-OSCs based on DPP–BDT–DPP SM donors.
In this work, two new molecules, DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T (Chart 1), with π-conjugated ethynylene bridges on both sides of BDTs were designed and synthesized for SM-OSC applications. In the literature, the ethynylene bridges were also utilized to construct some other SM-donors.38–41 The introduction of the ethynylene bridges can bring a few benefits: (1) in chemistry, the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T SM donors were prepared via Sonogashira coupling reactions, in which toxic stannyl intermediates or potentially hazardous lithiation reactions could be avoided;42 (2) electron-withdrawing nature of the ethynylene bridges could lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T SM donors, and thus SM-OSC would be of a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc);43 (3) the ethynylene bridges could result in planar conformations for the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T SM donors due to their cylinder-like π-electron density, thus enhancing intermolecular π–π stacking and facilitating intermolecular charge transport.44,45 Moreover, we introduced 4,8-dialkoxy and 4,8-dithienyl substitution groups on BDT for a comparison study. Solution-processed SM-OSCs with PCEs of 4.19% and 7.12% were achieved for DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T, respectively. Impressively high fill factors (FFs) up to 73.6% were recorded. The nanoscale morphologies of active layers fabricated under different conditions were characterized with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) so as to correlate with corresponding OSC performances.

Unless otherwise specified, all reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich, Acros, and TCI Chemical Co. and were used as received. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried from sodium/benzophenone under N2 before to use. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 were synthesized according to similar procedures in the literature.46,47

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (MS) data were obtained on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III. UV-vis absorption spectra of the solutions/films were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was done on a CHI660A electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) with platinum electrodes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile. Potentials were referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple by using ferrocene as an internal standard.

A mixture of 1 (843 mg, 1.4 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (49 mg), CuI (13.3 mg), THF (70 mL), and triethylamine (35 mL) was purged for 20 min with N2. Trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA, 1 mL, 7 mmol) was added via a syringe, and the sealed reaction was stirred overnight at 60 °C. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the organic phase was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL × 3), washed successively with water, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4.

Synthesis of compound 3. 
Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.1 mL, 1 M in THF) was added to a stirred solution of 2 (310 mg, 0.5 mmol) in THF/CH3OH (55 mL, 10:1). After the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, water was added to quench the reaction. Then the solution was extracted with chloroform, washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 = 3:1) to give the title compound as a red powder in a high yield of 98%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.93 (dd, 1H), 8.80 (d, 1H), 7.64 (dd, 1H), 7.37 (d, 1H), 7.28 (m, 1H), 4.05–3.96 (m, 4H), 3.58 (s, 1H), 1.86 (m, 2H), 1.36–1.23 (m, 16H), 0.90–0.84 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 161.71, 161.53, 141.10, 139.02, 135.76, 134.75, 133.99, 131.00, 130.92, 129.71, 128.54, 126.58, 108.96, 107.95, 85.20, 76.33, 45.93, 39.06, 30.14, 28.30, 23.52, 23.05, 14.02, 10.46.


Synthesis of compound DPP-E-BDT. 
To a 50 mL two-necked round-bottom flask were added 4 (240 mg, 0.4 mmol), 3 (604 mg, 1.1 mmol), anhydrous toluene (25 mL) and triethylamine (12.5 mL), and the mixture was deoxygenated with argon for 30 min before Pd(PPh3)4 (46 mg) and CuI (7.6 mg) were added. Then the mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 72 h under the protection of argon. After cooled to room temperature, the mixture was washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Then the solvent was removed, and the residue was purified by column chromatography with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 = 1:1 to give a black blue solid DPP-E-BDT in a yield of 78%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.94 (d, 2H), 8.88 (d, 2H), 7.67 (s, 2H), 7.65 (d, 2H), 7.44 (d, 2H), 7.27 (t, 2H), 4.22–4.17 (m, 4H), 4.09–3.98 (m, 8H), 1.94–1.84 (m, 4H), 1.74–1.66 (m, 2H), 1.61–1.26 (m, 48H), 1.04 (t, 6H), 0.96 (m, 6H), 0.93–0.85 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): δ 161.69, 161.56, 144.25, 140.98, 138.96, 135.79, 135.19, 133.56, 131.98, 131.5, 131.01, 130.35, 129.76, 128.56, 127.04, 126.21, 122.14, 109.03, 108.07, 91.26, 88.46, 76.47, 46.09, 45.98, 40.69, 39.17, 30.09, 30.39, 30.21, 29.21, 28.36, 23.83, 23.54, 23.13, 23.09, 14.18, 14.07, 14.04, 11.35, 10.48.

Synthesis of compound DPP-E-BDT-T. 
The synthesis and purification of DPP-E-BDT-T were carried out according to the same procedures for DPP-E-BDT with compound 5 (294.7 mg, 0.4 mmol) to replace compound 4, affording the title compound as a black blue solid in 70% yield. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.94 (dd, 2H), 8.90 (d, 2H), 7.86 (s, 2H), 7.65 (dd, 2H), 7.40 (d, 2H), 7.30 (d, 2H), 7.28 (m, 2H), 6.91 (d, 2H), 4.07–3.98 (m, 8H), 2.88 (d, 4H), 1.88 (m, 4H), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.38–1.22 (m, 48H), 1.00–0.94 (m, 12H), 0.92–0.83 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 161.65, 161.55, 146.55, 140.88, 140.03, 139.04, 136.90, 136.11, 135.75, 135.41, 133.48, 131.39, 130.94, 129.75, 129.32, 128.54, 128.18, 127.09, 125.63, 123.99, 123.61, 108.96, 108.07, 91.46, 88.97, 67.99, 46.09, 45.96, 41.49, 39.16, 39.08, 34.29, 32.50, 30.20, 30.08, 29.71, 28.93, 28.35, 28.28, 25.72, 25.62, 23.52, 23.07, 23.05, 14.20, 14.06, 14.03, 10.90, 10.48, 10.46.

Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic cells
The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (∼100 nm)/PFN/Al. Patterned ITO-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15–20 ohm per square was cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 15 min each time and subsequently dried with a nitrogen flow. After treatment with an oxygen plasma for 5 min, a thin layer PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was spin-coated (3000 rpm, ca. 40 nm thick) onto the ITO surface. After drying at 150 °C for 15 min, the substrates were moved into a N2 glove box. Subsequently, the active layer, composed of DPP-E-BDT or DPP-E-BDT-T and PC71BM (1:1, w/w, 16 mg mL−1), was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution at 1400 rpm. For some devices, 0.4 v% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as the solvent additive. Some active layers were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The thicknesses of active layers were about 100 nm as measured by using a profilometer. The ultra-thin PFN cathode interlayer was spin-coated from a methanol solution. And finally, the top electrode Al was evaporated with a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices at 16 mm2.
Space charge limited current measurements
Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobilities of active layers using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device composed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and an electron-only device composed of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al. The mobilities (μ) were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, described by the equation:  where J is the current, E is the effective electric field, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the material relative permittivity, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves.
GIXD characterization
GIXD characterization of the thin films was performed at the Advanced Light Source on beamline 7.3.3, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Thin film samples were prepared on wafer substrates. The scattering signal was recorded on a 2D detector (Pilatus 2M) with a pixel size of 0.172 mm by 0.172 mm. The samples were ∼15 mm long in the direction of the beam path, and the detector was located at a distance of ∼300 mm from the sample center (distance calibrated using a silver behenate standard). The incidence angle of 0.16° was chosen which gave an optimized signal-to-background ratio. The beam energy was 10 keV, operating at top-off mode. Typically, a 10 s exposure time was used to collect diffraction signals. All GIXD experiments were done in a helium atmosphere. The data were processed and analyzed using Nika software package.
RSoXS characterization
RSoXS was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 Advanced Light Source, LBNL. Thin film samples were spin-cast on the top of the PEDOT:PSS covered SiO2 wafers. After that, the BHJ composite films were spin-cast on the top of the SiO2/PEDOT:PSS substrates under exactly the same conditions as those for the fabrication of solar cell devices. Then the BHJ films were floated and transferred onto Si3N4 substrates. The scattering signals were collected in a vacuum using a Princeton Instrument PI-MTE CCD camera.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of two donor molecules, DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T, are presented in Scheme 1. With mono bromide 1 of DPP as the starting material, its Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) in a triethylamine (TEA)/THF mixture readily afforded target compound 2 in a good yield of 90% (Fig. S1†). The further desilylation reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in a THF/MeOH mixture gave compound 3 in a high yield of 98% (Fig. S2†). The second Sonogashira coupling of DPP-E-BDT or DPP-E-BDT-T was carried out in a mixed solvent of TEA and toluene. The final products DPP-E-BDT or DPP-E-BDT-T were obtained with yields of 78% and 70%, respectively, which were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), as shown in Fig. S3–S6.† The two molecules possess good solubility in commonly used solvents, such as THF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and chlorobenzene (CB), which allows their application in photovoltaic solar cells via the solution-processed method. Moreover, DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T were fairly stable, based on almost comparable 1H NMR spectra before and after exposure to the light and air for two months (Fig. S3 and S4†).

Optical absorption and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T in CHCl3 and in thin solid films are shown in Fig. 1. The relevant optical data are summarized in Table 1. In dilute CHCl3 solution, DPP-E-BDT exhibits a main absorption peak (λmax) at 596 nm with a shoulder peak at 563 nm (Fig. 1a). For the DPP-E-BDT-T solution, its absorption becomes broader in the longer wavelengths and the λmax slightly red-shifts to 600 nm, demonstrating the additionally weak conjugation effect from 4,8-dithienyl substitution on the BDT unit. The absorption peaks of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T in solution are obviously blue-shifted compared to molecules with the basic DPP–BDT–DPP skeleton and 4,8-dialkoxy, 4,8-dialkoxybenzene, and 4,8-dithienyl substitutions on the BDT unit.32,33,48 For the film absorptions of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T (Fig. 1b), their main peaks are at 593 and 598 nm, respectively, and new vibronic peaks resulted from molecular aggregations are at 645 and 653 nm, respectively. The absorption edges for films of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T locate at 710 and 727 nm, respectively, and their calculated optical band gaps (Eoptg) are thus 1.75 and 1.71 eV. In the literature, Eoptg values for two DPP–BDT–DPP SM donors with 4,8-dialkoxy and 4,8-dithienyl substitutions on the BDT unit are 1.69 and 1.65 eV,32,33,48 respectively. In general, the insertions of ethynylene bridges in the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T molecules enlarge the aromatic skeletons of the DPP–BDT–DPP SM donors but slightly increase the band gaps, reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of the ethynylene unit.43

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T were determined from their onsets of oxidation potential (Eox) during cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement with an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and an energy level of ferrocene of −4.80 eV as the internal standard (Fig. 2). The Eox values of the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T are 0.62 and 0.61 V, respectively, and their calculated HOMO levels are −5.42 and −5.41 eV, respectively (Table 1). The insertion of ethynylene bridges results in lower-lying HOMO levels if compared with those of the reported DPP–BDT–DPP SM donors.32,48,49 It should be noted that the low-lying HOMO level of a donor molecule is an important factor to achieve a higher Voc. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T are obtained from the difference between the corresponding HOMO level and Eoptg. The deduced LUMO levels for the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T are −3.67 and −3.70 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T SM donors can well match those of the PC71BM acceptor, indicating that effective charge transfers between the donors and the fullerene acceptor may be generated.

Theoretical calculations
The effect of ethynylene bridges in these new molecules can effectively affect the molecular electronic structure. Quantum chemistry simulation was used to understand the physical principles. The optimal geometries of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T were optimized by B3LYP/6-311G*. To reduce the calculation cost, the alkyl side groups were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. 3, the calculated skeletons of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T are quite planar, indicating that introducing ethynylene bridges with cylinder-like π-electron density in the molecules would facilitate planar conformations for the backbones.44 The geometries of the molecules may enhance their intermolecular π–π stacking for better carrier transport. For frontier molecular orbitals of the two molecules (Fig. 3), the electrons in both HOMO and LUMO can be delocalized along the whole planar skeletons.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the two molecules, OSC devices were fabricated using DPP-E-BDT or DPP-E-BDT-T as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (∼100 nm)/PFN/Al, in which an alcohol-soluble polymer PFN was the cathode interlayer that could enhance electron collection at the Al cathode side. The active layer was coated from chlorobenzene solutions at 1400 rpm. A donor/PC71BM ratio of 1:1 was optimal for the OSC performances (Table S1†). In device optimization, 0.4% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as the solvent additive, and thermal annealing (TA) was carried out at 100 °C for 10 min. The measurements of the photovoltaic performances of the OSCs were carried out under illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 4a and c. Their solar cell parameters are listed in Table 2.

For DPP-E-BDT (Fig. 4a), the OSC based on an active layer fabricated with no DIO additive and no TA treatment (as cast) showed a Voc of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 5.81 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.1%, giving a PCE of 2.97%. If TA treatment was carried out for the active layer, the PCE could be elevated to 3.72% mainly due to the Jsc increasing to a value of 7.46 mA cm−2. When DIO was used in device fabrication, Jsc could be increased to 7.37 mA cm−2. However, the PCE of the OSC was 3.05%, due to the low Voc (0.79 V) and FF (52.5%). Interestingly, the combination of the DIO additive and TA treatment could significantly elevate photovoltaic performances of the DPP-E-BDT based OSC. In this combined post-treatment, the Jsc could be further increased to 7.87 mA cm−2 and the FF to 60.4%, yielding a PCE of 4.19%. The averaged PCE based on 10 devices was 4.07%.
For the OSCs based on DPP-E-BDT-T with 4,8-dithienyl substitutions on the BDT unit, the roles of DIO additive and TA treatment were also compared (Fig. 4c). The OSC based on the as-cast active layer could give a large Voc of 0.98 V, a low Jsc of 5.92 mA cm−2, a low FF of 32.9%, and a very low PCE of 1.91%. The TA treatment could increase Jsc to 7.53 mA cm−2 and FF to 55.2%, affording a better PCE of 3.78%. Similar to the case of DPP-E-BDT, the DIO additive could improve the Jsc (8.94 mA cm−2), but reduced Voc (0.85 V) and FF (37.5%). The PCE was 2.85% in DIO processed devices. The combination of the DIO additive and TA treatment gave a good Voc of 0.89 V, a high Jsc of 10.9 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 73.6%, which led to a high PCE of 7.12%. The averaged PCE based on 10 devices was 6.94%, which is 2.5 times higher compared with devices fabricated with no DIO additive and no TA treatment. It should be noted that DPP-E-BDT-T showed the best efficiency so far reported for SM donors with a basic DPP–BDT–DPP skeleton,32–37 demonstrating the importance of the ethynylene bridges. For the related DPP–BDT–DPP molecule without the ethynylene bridges, OSC devices showed lower Voc values of about 0.84 V and FF values less than 59%, giving PCEs ≤5.79%.32
The PCE of 7.12% for DPP-E-BDT-T is about 70% higher than that of 4.19% for DPP-E-BDT, coming from better Jsc and FF values in DPP-E-BDT-T BHJ blends. The results should have originated from structural issues, in which we noted that 4,8-dithienyl substitutions were effective. In fact, this substitution led to the 2-D effect, as reported in BDT-thienothiophene polymer PTB7-Th.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T based OSCs are shown in Fig. 4b and d, respectively. The integrated current density (Jsc (calc.)) values based on the EQE curves for DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T are consistent with their Jsc obtained from the J–V curves under illuminations (Table 2). For the devices fabricated with the DIO additive as well as using TA treatment, the maximum EQEs of 50% and 69% at about 586 nm were obtained for DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T, respectively.
In the literature, chloroform, a low boiling point solvent, was selected as the solvent to cast SM-OSCs.33,35,48 For our DPP-E-BDT or DPP-E-BDT-T, using chloroform as the solvent resulted in a relatively lower efficiency if compared with the chlorobenzene (Table S2†).
The difference in device performances under different processing conditions implies that the active layers would have quite different morphologies, which will be examined in later discussions.
SCLC mobility
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films for the OSC devices were obtained from SCLC measurements with hole-only and electron-only devices. The SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S7† and the corresponding μh and μe are listed in Table 3. In the as-cast thin films, DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T donor phases showed μh of 2.2 × 10−5 and 3.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively while the corresponding PC71BM acceptor phases exhibited μe of 7.0 × 10−5 and 7.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The obviously higher μe than μh indicate that transports for holes and electrons in the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T based active layers are not balanced. The combination of the DIO additive and TA treatment was the best choice for the both DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T. In SCLC measurements, the DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T donor phases displayed μh of 1.0 × 10−4 and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. And the μe from acceptor phase was 1.3 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus DIO additive and TA treatment not only increased both hole and electron mobilities but also resulted in more balanced carrier transports. Relatively, the DPP-E-BDT-T based active layer possessed almost identical μh and μe. The result is also consistent with its very high FF of 73.6% as achieved from the OSC device.

Morphology characterization
The structure orders of DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T in BHJ blends were studied using GIXD. The scattering images and the corresponding line cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5. As seen from the scattering images, DPP-E-BDT in as-cast BHJ blends took a preferred edge-on crystal orientation. A strong (100) diffraction was seen in the out-of-plane direction, located at 0.43 A−1, giving a distance of 1.46 nm. The corresponding crystal size was estimated to be 9.46 nm. A strong π–π stacking peak was seen in the in-plane line cut profile, although the angular spreading was large in 2-D scattering images. The π–π stacking peak located at 1.74 A−1 corresponded to a distance of 0.36 nm. Thermal annealing slightly changed the crystal size (100) plane to 10.83 nm, and π–π stacking remained similar. Thus thermal annealing can be a favorable factor to enhance material crystallization. When DIO is used, the (100) crystal size increased to 13.04 nm, thus it is more efficient in helping the molecule to crystallize. The combined DIO and thermal annealing led to a (100) crystal size of 12.0 nm, which is in between thermal annealing and DIO processing. Thus in this blend, thermal annealing of the DIO processed thin film could lead to new crystallization, yielding small crystals.

The crystallization of DPP-E-BDT-T in BHJ blends is slightly different from DPP-E-BDT. As seen from the diffraction image, DPP-E-BDT-T took a preferred edge-on orientation. However, the intensity of π–π stacking is quite evenly distributed throughout all angles. The (100) stacking located at 0.36 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 1.74 nm. The π–π stacking located at 1.72 A−1, which was slightly larger than DPP-E-BDT. In the as-cast thin film, the (100) crystal size was 8.47 nm. Thermal annealing increased this value to 11.70 nm. DIO processing led to a (100) crystal size of 10.07 nm. The combined DIO plus thermal annealing led to a crystal size of 12.67 nm, which was the largest in this series.
The length scale of phase separation was investigated using RSoXS using carbon k-edge photon energy (284.2 eV). The corresponding scattering profiles are summarized in Fig. 6. It is quite surprising that the two molecules showed quite different results with only a small change in side chain substitution. As shown in Fig. 6a, the alkoxyl substituted DPP-E-BDT, all these four processing conditions gave quite similar scattering results, with a preeminent peak located at 0.013 A−1, giving a phase separation size of 48.3 nm. In DPP-E-BDT-T blends, quite large shifting in RSoXS peaks was recorded. As in the as-cast thin film, a weak scattering peak profile was seen with a broad hump at high angles. Thus the phase separation was quite weak. When thermal annealing was used, an obvious scattering peak showed up at 0.022 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 28.5 nm. The DIO processed thin film showed a scattering peak at 0.0275 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 22.8 nm. The scattering intensity from the DIO case was much lower than the thermal annealed sample, thus thermal annealing was the dominant driving force in this system. When DIO and thermal annealing were used, a much stronger scattering signal was seen at 0.0178 A−1, giving a distance of 35.2 nm.

The combinations of GIXD, RSoXS and device characterization yield intrinsic structure–property relationships in these two BHJ blends. As seen from DPP-E-BDT blends, although DIO and thermal annealing could lead to enhanced crystallization, the global morphology of these BHJ blends was fixed, and thus not much improvement could be obtained when varied processing conditions were used. The ∼50 nm phase separation was not large in the small molecule system, and the crystal size of DPP-E-BDT was about 10–15 nm, thus no huge PCBM aggregation existed. This BHJ is mainly constructed by using the DPP-E-BDT crystal and molecule:PCBM mixed domains. In DPP-E-BDT-T BHJ blends, the donor molecule mixed quite well with PCBM, without showing a pronounced phase separation. Subsequent thermal annealing led to large enhancement in the molecule crystal size, which was associated with the enlarged phase separation. In the device, much better device performances could be obtained. DIO in 0.4% was less effective compared to thermal annealing in DPP-E-BDT-T blends, as indicated from both GIXD and RSoXS. Thus an inferior device optimization was seen. The combined DIO plus thermal annealing treatment led to the best crystallization and the most prominent phase separation, thus the fill factor of the device showed a huge improvement, leading to the highest device performances.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized DPP-E-BDT and DPP-E-BDT-T A–D–A small molecule donors using π-conjugated ethynylene bridges, which can show PCEs of 7.12%, the highest efficiency among SM donors based on DPP and BDT units. Obvious improvement can be obtained by this strategy in device Voc improvement. Thus ethynylene incorporation could lower the HOMO levels of the resulting materials. Different solubilizing side chains were also employed. We see that alkoxyl substitution could lead to better crystallization in BHJ blends, and the phase separation is quite stable when different processing conditions are used. In DPP-E-BDT-T blends, the thienyl substitution on the molecule could largely modulate the crystallization and interaction with PCBM. In the current case, thermal annealing could be quite effective in crystallizing DPP-E-BDT-T and form well-developed phase separation. The resulting BHJ thin film by a combined DIO and thermal annealing treatment leads to balanced carrier transport and an exceptionally high fill factor of 73.6%. Thus a much better efficiency could be obtained.
