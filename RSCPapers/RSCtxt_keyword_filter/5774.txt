    , Accepted 12th March 2015First published on 16th March 2015AbstractAn alcohol-soluble fullerene derivative functionalized with a crown-ether end group in its side chain (denoted as PCBC) was synthesized and applied as a cathode buffer layer in planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells and bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells. It is found that the introduction of the PCBC cathode buffer layer can greatly improve the photovoltaic performance of the planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 15.08%. In addition, the bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM with the PCBC cathode buffer layer also showed a higher PCE of 7.67%, which is improved in comparison with the traditional device with the Ca/Al cathode. This work indicates that PCBC is a promising solution-processable cathode buffer layer material for application in both planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells and bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have witnessed a surprisingly rapid development since Kojima et al. published the first paper in 2009.1 The device configuration has evolved from the traditional dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) to all-solid DSSC, to meso-porous and then to planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells.2–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero-SCs has skyrocketed from 3.8% (ref. 1) reported in the first paper to 20.1% recently.5,6 Their high efficiency has drawn much attention from the researchers in the research fields of DSSCs and polymer solar cells.7–20 On the other hand, polymer solar cells (PSCs), though with relatively low efficiency, still attract great research interest because of their unique features of low cost, light-weight, flexibility and easy large-area printing fabrication.21 Through the research efforts in photovoltaic materials22 and devices,23 the PCE of the PSCs also reached over 10% recently.24–26
The device structure of the planar pero-SCs is similar to the bulk-heterojunction PSCs except that the active layer of the planar pero-SCs is an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductor while that of the PSCs is a blend film of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor. There are two types of device structures for PSCs: one is the conventional PSCs with the transparent ITO modified with PEDOT:PSS as the anode and a low work function metal as the cathode; another is the inverted structured PSCs with ITO covered by a cathode buffer layer (CBL) as the cathode. Correspondingly, there are two types of planar pero-SCs: p–i–n pero-SCs with ITO covered by a p-type anode buffer layer as the anode and n–i–p pero-SCs with ITO covered by an n-type CBL as the cathode.5b
Interfacial engineering has been extensively studied along with the development of planar pero-SCs and PSCs. In conventional PSCs, low work function active metals such as Ca are commonly used as the CBL, but Ca is quite sensitive to oxygen and moisture in air, which results in the poor stability of the devices and the vacuum deposition of Ca is unmatchable with the printing technique for the fabrication of PSCs. LiF has also been used as the CBL in conventional PSCs and in p–i–n pero-SCs.27 However, the insulating LiF as the CBL should be very thin which is very difficult to control in the vacuum deposition and the vacuum deposition is undesirable for future roll-to-roll manufacturing of the solar cells. Therefore, the development of air-stable and solution-processable CBL materials is in great demand. To date, various inorganic28–32 and organic23a,33,34 CBL materials have been explored.
The CBLs in the planar p–i–n pero-SCs and in conventional PSCs play the same role in efficiently collecting and transporting electrons, therefore, high performance CBL materials were developed recently for applications in both p–i–n pero-SCs and PSCs.34 Among the CBL materials, fullerene derivatives show distinguished advantages of high electron mobility and a matching LUMO energy level with the acceptor PCBM used in the pero-SCs and PSCs.34c,d,35–41 In addition, Chen et al. synthesized a polyfluorene derivative with crown-ether side chains for application as a CBL in PSCs, and they observed excellent photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.42 Considering the good performance of the fullerene derivatives and the effect of the crown-ether side chain on the photovoltaic performance of the CBL materials, here we synthesized a new alcohol-soluble fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (18-crown-6)-2-yl methyl ester (simplified as PCBC in the following) with crown-ether as the end group in its side chain, and used it as the CBL in planar p–i–n pero-SCs and conventional PSCs. The PCE of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with PCBC as the CBL reached 15.08% which is slightly higher than that of the device with LiF as the CBL. Conventional PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM with PCBC as the CBL also demonstrated a higher PCE of 7.67% which is also improved in comparison with that of the device with Ca/Al as the cathode. The results indicate that PCBC is a promising solution-processable CBL material for application in both planar p–i–n pero-SCs and conventional PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
All the solvents involved were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2-Hydroxymethyl-18-crown-6 and PbCl2 (99.999%) were bought from Alfa Aesar. P3HT, PBDTTT-C-T, PC60BM and PC70BM were produced by Solarmer Material Inc. (Beijing, China). ITO-coated glass with a resistance of 10 Ω sq.−1 was acquired from CSG Holding Co., Ltd. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was purchased from TCI Development Co., Ltd. (Shanghai).
Synthesis of PCBC
The synthetic route of PCBC is shown in Scheme 1. PC60BM is used as the starting material. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid chloride (PCBA-Cl) were prepared by referring to the previous work.40 Esterification of PCBA-Cl with 2-hydroxymethyl-18-crown-6 afforded PCBC. The structure of PCBC was characterized with an Av400X NMR (Bruker Co.). PCBC has a modest solubility in methanol and good solubility in ethanol, chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The detailed synthesis processes are shown below.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of PCBC. 
0.45 g (0.5 mmol) PCBA and 10 mL SOCl2 were added to 100 mL CS2, and the mixture was refluxed for 21 hours under N2. After the removal of CS2 by evaporation under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was then dissolved in 30 mL dry toluene, and 0.15 g (0.5 mmol) 2-hydroxymethyl-18-crown-6 and 0.12 g pyridine were added. The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, then washed with 30 mL 5% NaOH aqueous solution followed by 30 mL water. The organic layer dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and then the solvent was removed under vacuum to obtain the crude product which was purified by neutral aluminium oxide column chromatography using chloroform as the eluent, resulting in a brownish black solid, PCBC (0.3 g, 51% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 2.15–2.22 (m, 2H), 2.52–2.54 (m, 2H), 2.89–2.93 (m, 2H), 3.58–3.83 (m, 23H), 4.10–4.26 (m, 2H), 7.45–7.49 (m, 1H), 7.52–7.56 (m, 2H), 7.91–7.93 (m, 2H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 22.42, 33.69, 34.05, 51.90, 64.09, 70.00, 70.69, 70.74, 70.83, 70.90, 71.00, 71.08, 79.90, 128.28, 128.47, 132.12, 136.74, 137.58, 138.06, 140.76, 141.01, 142.13, 142.15, 142.19, 142.26, 142.94, 143.00, 143.05, 143.13, 143.78, 144.02, 144.44, 144.52, 144.68, 144.81, 145.05, 145.09, 145.17, 145.21, 145.60, 147.80, 148.82, 172.88.

Preparation of the perovskite precursor
The Cl-doped perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor was synthesized according to the literature.43 To the DMF solution of perovskite, approximately 1% (volume fraction) of DIO was added. The mixture was then stirred overnight at 60 °C to obtain the perovskite precursor. The storage time of the precursor was no more than two weeks in a glove box. Filtration was routinely performed by running through a 0.45 μm filter right before the device fabrication.
Fabrication of solar cells
The solar cells (either planar p–i–n pero-SCs or conventional PSCs) were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/CBL/Al. ITO glass was used as the transparent anode in the solar cells. The glass slides with ITO strips of 2 mm width were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol under sonication for 10 min each. Followed by drying in a nitrogen flow they are then treated with oxygen plasma for 15 min to generate a hydrophilic surface. The PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AI 4083) was adopted as the anode buffer layer, which is directly attached to ITO. The solution of PEDOT:PSS was filtered to remove the possible precipitation and spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 50 s, followed by baking at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The substrates were then transferred into a glove box filled with nitrogen for the rest of the operation.
The preparation of photoactive layers for the PSCs and pero-SCs was slightly different, and the details are shown below. (1) For the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM, the active layer was prepared by spin-coating the solution of P3HT:PC60BM (1:1 by weight) in o-DCB at 800 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were then transferred and kept in a Petridish until the film turned purple. Afterward, they were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, and ready for the next steps. (2) For the PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM, the photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating the blend of PBDTTT-C-T (10 mg mL−1), PC70BM (15 mg mL−1) and DIO (3% by volume) at 900 rpm for 90 s. (3) For the active layer preparation of the pero-SCs, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm for 50 s. The substrates were then thermally annealed at 105 °C for approximately 40 min. Then a PC60BM layer was capped on the perovskite by spin-coating a chloroform solution of PC60BM (typically 15 mg mL−1) at 1200 rpm for 60 s.
For the preparation of the PCBC CBL, the ethanol solution of PCBC with a concentration of ca. 0.2 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on the photoactive layer (N.B.: on the PC60BM layer for the planar p–i–n pero-SCs) by controlling the spin speed and time. Finally, 80 nm of Al was deposited onto the PCBC buffer layer by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 1.0 × 10−4 Pa. During the deposition, a shadow mask was clung to the substrates to define active areas of 4 mm2.
Electron-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/Cs2CO3/P3HT:PC60BM/PCBC/Al for electron mobility measurements. The device fabrication conditions are the same as that mentioned above for the fabrication of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM except for the use of a Cs2CO3 layer instead of PEDOT:PSS. The Cs2CO3 layer was prepared by spin-coating 2-ethoxyethanol solution of Cs2CO3 (0.2 wt%) on an ITO substrate at 3000 rpm and then baking it at 150 °C for 20 min.
Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under simulated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light source was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell before use. The measurements were carried out by keeping the PSCs inside the glove box (an atmosphere of <1 ppm O2 and H2O). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The light intensity was calibrated using a single-crystal silicon photovoltaic cell as a reference. The alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed on a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation in the dark. The ACIS measurements were carried out by applying a bias near the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. A 10 mV ac sinusoidal signal was applied over the constant bias with the frequency ranging from 4 MHz to 0.3 Hz. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-view software. The C–V measurements were recorded at a frequency of 1 kHz and an AC voltage of 50 mV. The DC voltage was swept from −1 to 1 V. The work functions (WFs) were measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on a Bruker Multimode 8 microscope. Platinum-coated probes (ANSCM-PT) with a nominal spring constant in the range of 1–5 N m−1 and a resonant frequency in the range of 48–81 kHz were used. Freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was used as a reference.
Results and discussion
Effect of PCBC CBL on the performance of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM
P3HT and PC60BM are the most representative donor and acceptor materials in PSCs. Therefore, we studied the effect of the PCBC CBL on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM, in comparison with the PSCs with traditional Ca/Al as the cathode. Fig. 1 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with Ca/Al, Al (without CBL) or PCBC/Al (with PCBC as the CBL) as the cathode, in the dark and under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. Herein, the devices with Ca/Al or only Al (without CBL) were studied as a control. The photovoltaic performance data of the PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The device with only the Al (without CBL) cathode showed a PCE of 2.88% with a short circuit current (Jsc), Voc and fill factor (FF) of 9.47 mA cm−2, 0.53 V and 57.0%, respectively. By inserting the PCBC CBL between the active layer and the Al electrode, the device performance significantly improved. The PCE of the PSC with the PCBC CBL increased to 3.63% with a Jsc of 9.47 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.58 V and a FF of 65.5%. Both the Voc and FF increased significantly compared with those of the device without the CBL. While for the PSC with the traditional Ca/Al as the cathode, the PCE we obtained was 3.52%, which is slightly lower than that of the PSC with PCBC as the CBL. The results indicate that solution-processable PCBC can be used as an efficient CBL instead of the unstable active metal Ca in the cathode.

In order to figure out the reason for the FF increase of the PSC with the PCBC CBL, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were deduced from the slope of J–V curves at 0 mA cm−2 and 0 V, respectively. The corresponding data are also shown in Table 1. Clearly, the Rs of the device with the PCBC CBL is the smallest and its Rsh is the largest among the three PSCs. The lower Rs and higher Rsh facilitate the charge separation and transfer, and thus provide a good explanation for the significant improvement of FF for the PSC with the PCBC CBL.
The reduced Rs can also be verified by the J–V curves of the devices measured in the dark, as shown in Fig. 1b. When compared to the control devices, the PSC with the PCBC CBL showed a higher injection current at a positive bias (e.g., 1.5 V), which is consistent with the lower Rs.
The surface morphologies of the P3HT:PC60BM blend films with and without the PCBC CBL on top were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of the blend films with and without the PCBC layer were 15.9 and 19.9 nm, respectively. The smoother surface of the P3HT:PCBM/PCBC film may lead to a better interfacial contact with the upper Al electrode so as to result in a lower Rs of the device.
The electron mobility in the PSCs was measured by using the electron-only devices where the PEDOT:PSS layer on ITO was replaced by low work function (∼2.9 eV) Cs2CO3.44Fig. 2 shows the dark J–V curves (plotted on a log–log scale) of the electron-only devices. The electron mobilities were calculated from the J–V curves of the devices, using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model with the following equation: J = 9ε0εrμVeff2/8L3, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the photoactive layer, μ is the drift mobility of electrons, Veff is the effective applied voltage (equals to the voltage applied minus the built-in potential of the cell), and L is the thickness of the active layer.44,45 The electron mobilities of the PSCs with and without the PCBC CBL are 2.30 × 10−3 and 6.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It should be noted that the value of μ is not for the active layer, but for the device including both the active layer and the buffer layer.45 The calculated μ strongly depends on the interfacial charge transport in the case that the electron transport within the active layer is sufficiently fast and therefore the drift velocity of electrons is dominated by the interfacial electron transport. Upon the incorporation of the PCBC CBL, the electron mobility increases because of the improved interfacial electron transfer due to the better ohmic contact between the photoactive layer and the Al electrode for the devices with the PCBC CBL.

To gain more insight into the effect of the PCBC interlayer on the charge transfer of the devices, the ACIS spectra of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM were measured and compared for the PSCs with and without the PCBC CBL. Fig. 3a shows the Nyquist plots of the PSCs recorded in the dark and with the applied voltage near the Voc (0.58 V). The impedance spectra are composed of two depressed semicircles. From left to right of the plots, the high frequency region in the left part corresponds to the responses of the photoactive layer, and the lower frequency region in the right part of the plots corresponds to the electrode interlayer. The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3b, which consists of an ohmic series resistance (Ros) and two parallel resistance‖constant phase elements (R‖CPE),33,46 was employed to fit the Nyquist plots. Herein, the CPE is employed to describe a non-ideal capacitor with a capacitive contribution CPE-T and the quality factor CPE-P.47 The parameters fitted from the ACIS are listed in Table 2, where the subscript “1” and “2” are used to denote the photoactive layer and electrode interfaces, respectively.

The small Ros values of the two devices arise from the contribution of the resistance of the two electrodes and the external circuit. Similar R1 values are also reasonable for the same active layers of the two devices. It is noteworthy that the resistance R2 (6.33 Ω cm2) of the electrode interfaces in the PSC with the PCBC CBL is much lower than that (13.49 Ω cm2) of the PSC without the PCBC CBL. The results indicate that the introduction of the PCBC CBL significantly improved the ohmic contact (decreased the interface resistance) of the interface between the active layer and the electrode. The better ohmic contact of the electrode interfaces should be beneficial to the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with the PCBC CBL.
In addition to the FF, the Voc is actually also elevated with the insertion of the PCBC interlayer. To build a link between the Voc and the interlayer, the C–V curves (i.e. Mott–Schottky characteristics) of the PSCs were measured, from which the flat-band potential (Vfb) can be obtained. The measurements were conducted in the dark at room temperature and with a frequency of 1 kHz for both the devices with and without the PCBC interlayer. The results are shown in Fig. 4. At low forward bias, C−2 varies linearly according to V; the Vfb can be extrapolated onto the abscissa.48,49 The value of Vfb increased from 0.40 to 0.45 V after the introduction of the PCBC interlayer. Such a voltage difference (50 mV) matches well with the enhancement of the Voc. This result implies that the incorporation of the PCBC CBL onto the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM can not only facilitate the charge transfer, but also contribute to the improvement of Voc. And the enhancement effect can possibly arise from the increased built-in potential due to the formation of the interfacial dipoles.42

Effect of the PCBC CBL on the performance of the PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM
It is clearly shown by the above results that solution-processable PCBC can serve as a promising CBL instead of the active metal Ca in the PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM. To investigate the versatility of the PCBC CBL in the PSCs, we further used the PCBC CBL in the PSCs based on a narrow bandgap polymer PBDTTT-C-T as the donor and PC70BM as the acceptor.50Fig. 5a shows J–V curves of the PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM with Ca or PCBC CBLs, under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2, and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the PCE of the PSC with the Ca/Al cathode was 6.98%, while a PCE of 7.67% was obtained for the PSC with the PCBC CBL. Obviously, the PCE of the PSCs is increased by ca. 10% by replacing Ca with the PCBC CBL. This result indicates that the fullerene derivative PCBC also works well as the CBL in the PSCs based on high efficiency narrow bandgap polymer donors.

Effect of the PCBC CBL on the photovoltaic performance of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs
A suitable solution-processable CBL is also preferable for improving the photovoltaic performance of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs. Considering the good performance of the PCBC CBL in PSCs, we also applied the PCBC CBL in the planar p–i–n pero-SCs with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the active layer and PC60BM as the acceptor layer. Seo et al. demonstrated that LiF as a CBL can greatly enhance the photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs.27a Therefore, we studied the effect of the PCBC CBL on the photovoltaic performance of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs in comparison with the planar p–i–n pero-SCs with the LiF CBL. The J–V curves of the pero-SCs are shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are also listed in Table 3. The PCE of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs is 12.68% for the device without the CBL, 14.82% for the device with the LiF CBL and 15.08% for the device with the PCBC CBL. Without the extra CBL, the highest PCE can reach to 12.68%. The PCE of 14.82% for the planar pero-SCs is comparable with that reported in the literature.27 Obviously, the planar pero-SCs with the PCBC CBL demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance which is slightly improved in comparison with that of the device with the LiF CBL. This result indicates that the PCBC CBL can also be applied to the planar p–i–n pero-SCs to effectively improve the device performance.
When compared with the pero-SC without the PCBC CBL, the photovoltaic performance of the pero-SC with the PCBC CBL is improved significantly with slightly increased Jsc from 21.48 to 22.08 mA cm−2 and greatly improved FF from 60.9% to 69.7%. We think that the performance improvement should also be attributed to the improved interfacial ohmic contact between PCBM and the Al electrode. To confirm this speculation, ACIS measurements were performed on the pero-SCs with and without the PCBC CBL. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1,† the resistance R2 (13.96 Ω cm2) at the active layer/electrode interface of the pero-SC with the PCBC CBL is much lower than that (22.14 Ω cm2) of the pero-SC without the PCBC CBL. The reduced interfacial resistance facilitates extraction and transportation of electrons, which results in the enhanced efficiency of the p–i–n pero-SCs with the PCBC CBL.
Conclusion
An ethanol-soluble fullerene derivative, PCBC, functionalized with a crown-ether end group in its side chain was synthesized and applied as the CBL in bulk-heterojunction PSCs based on P3HT:PC60BM and PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM, and in planar p–i–n pero-SCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. The photovoltaic performances of the devices were characterized and compared with those of the devices without the CBL or with the traditional Ca cathode (for PSCs) and the LiF CBL (for pero-SCs). It was found that the PCBC CBL can improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs and pero-SCs significantly and is superior to the traditional Ca cathode in PSCs and the LiF CBL in planar p–i–n pero-SCs. The PCE of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with the PCBC CBL reached a high value of 15.08%. The results indicate that PCBC is a promising versatile CBL material for bulk-heterojunction organic/polymer solar cells and for planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells.
