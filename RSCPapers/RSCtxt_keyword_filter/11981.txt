    , Accepted 9th February 2017First published on 9th February 2017AbstractAn Sb2S3 absorber layer is coated on mesoporous TiO2 films through a sequential deposition method: SbCl3 aqueous solution is first deposited, followed by reaction with H2S gas and further thermal annealing. Under our conditions, the Sb2S3-based solid-state heterojunction solar cells yield efficiencies of up to 6.27% at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G.
Sensitized solar cells (SSCs) have attracted great attention for next-generation photovoltaics due to the possibility of lower production cost compared to that of current commercial silicon photovoltaics. In conventional SSCs, a wide band gap semiconductor (typically TiO2) is sensitized for light absorption using organic dyes in combination with liquid electrolytes.1,2 Considering the issues of organic dye stability and liquid electrolyte leakage, low band gap inorganic semiconductors such as CdS(e), PbS(e), In2S3, Bi2S3 and Sb2S3 have been explored to replace organic dyes,3–7 and solid electrolytes such as Spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, and CuSCN have been used to replace liquid electrolytes for solid-state solar cells,7–11 commonly known as extremely thin absorber (ETA) or quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells. Among inorganic semiconductor absorbers, Sb2S3 is a promising photovoltaic material due to its high absorption coefficient (1.8 × 105 cm−1 at 450 nm) and mid-range optical bandgap of ∼1.7 eV.12 Moreover, Sb2S3 can be processed through solution deposition, and both sulfur and antimony elements are nontoxic and abundant. Recently, over 7% of power conversion efficiency has been reported for Sb2S3 based solar cells.13
For the deposition of Sb2S3, chemical bath deposition (CBD) has been extensively employed with a solution mixture of antimony chloride and sodium thiosulfate as a precursor source of Sb3+ and S2− ions, respectively. This procedure is usually conducted at low temperatures (<10 °C) for a long time (several hours) for the deposition of Sb2S3 within a mesoporous TiO2 film. Generally, the loading amount of Sb2S3 exponentially increases with the deposition time, and the film quality is strongly dependent on the precise control over the temperature, pH value and additives in the solution.12–20 Meanwhile, the formation of antimony oxides cannot be avoided by the conventional aqueous phase CBD technique, and thus deep traps in the gap state would form in the Sb2S3 film, causing the backward recombination of generated charge carriers.21,22 As an extension of the CBD technique, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) was also used for the deposition of Sb2S3.23 For both the CBD and SILAR, it was reported that the deposited Sb2S3 coating does not cover the TiO2 particles conformally, but rather agglomerates to coat clusters of TiO2.5,16 For improving the deposition of Sb2S3, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique has been developed for the formation of Sb2S3 on a planar or mesoscopic TiO2 film recently.24,25 In this approach, Sb2S3 was deposited on a TiO2 film in a layer by layer fashion through the alternate deposition and reaction of tris(dimethyl)amino antimony and H2S, resulting in pure Sb2S3 conformally coated on the surface of TiO2. In addition, its thickness can be well controlled, depending on the number of reaction cycles carried out. However, 150 cycles are required for the required thickness in the devices.
Herein, we report a simple sequential deposition approach for facile and rapid deposition of Sb2S3 within a mesoporous TiO2 film. In this approach, an antimony salt was first introduced from alcohol solution into a nanoporous TiO2 film and subsequently transformed into Sb2S3 through reaction with H2S with a certain humidity. The conversion occurred quickly—in less than 5 minutes, with homogeneous deposition of pure Sb2S3 within the porous TiO2 film. Moreover, the loading amount of Sb2S3 could be simply controlled through adjusting the concentration of the antimony salt in solution. Using the films, we prepared solid-state solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6.27%, measured under AM 1.5 G conditions.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the formation of Sb2S3 on a mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2)/compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2)/FTO substrate by the sequential deposition method. Here, a porous TiO2 film (∼1.3 μm thick) was spin-coated from a paste made of commercially available P25 powder (Degussa, 25 nm particles) in ethanol on a FTO glass substrate pre-coated with a compact TiO2 film (∼60 nm).26–28 For the deposition of Sb2S3, SbCl3 was first introduced from alcoholic solution into the porous TiO2 films by spin coating, and subsequently transformed into Sb2S3 within the porous film by the reaction between the SbCl3 and H2S in a closed container, where H2S was generated through the reaction of Na2S and H2SO4 in a dilute aqueous solution. We observed that the conversion occurred quickly at room temperature, accompanied by the color change from white opaque to orange. The orange color did not change after 5 minutes, indicating fast and complete transformation of Sb2S3.

Fig. 2a shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films prepared with various concentrations of SbCl3 solutions, with the corresponding photographs shown in the inset. All the films are orange in color with the absorption onset around 600 nm, indicative of the amorphous character.5 The color changed from light orange to dark orange when a higher salt concentration was used during the deposition. At relatively low concentrations, the as-deposited Sb2S3/TiO2 films are orange and transparent, and the absorption was enhanced with the concentration. The results demonstrated that the Sb2S3 was homogeneously coated within the TiO2 film, and the loading amount was increased with the concentration. With further increase of the concentration up to 19%, the film became dark orange and opaque, indicating that Sb2S3 was not formed only within the porous TiO2 film, but also coated on the surface due to the presence of excess SbCl3 at high concentrations. In addition, we tried to deposit SbCl3 on a planar substrate to directly transform it into Sb2S3 without a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, and found that the conversion was not complete under the same conditions. Thus, confining SbCl3 within the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold enhances the rate of conversion to Sb2S3, which is similar to the observation of the deposition of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite through sequential deposition.29 It should be noted that a relative humidity of 50–90% was maintained in the closed reaction container, which is necessary for the quick conversion of Sb2S3 (less than 5 minutes). Otherwise, the reaction could not proceed under a dry H2S flow at room temperature, even with a prolonged reaction time of up to 1 h. This implies that a certain amount of water is required for an efficient ion-exchange reaction between SbCl3 and H2S.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the amorphous Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films prepared from different concentrations (wt%) of SbCl3 solutions (a), and subsequent thermal annealing at 300 °C under a H2S flow (b). 
Due to the amorphous state of the as-prepared Sb2S3, further crystallization was carried out by thermal annealing at 300 °C for 30 minutes in a tube furnace under a H2S flow. After the annealing, the film changed from orange to brown in color, with a red-shift of the absorption edge from approximately 600 nm to 750 nm, indicating successful phase transformation from the amorphous to the crystalline state. Similarly, the color of the film changed gradually from dark brown to grey with the increase of the SbCl3 concentration from 10% to 25%, as shown in Fig. 2b. We also tried to directly transform the as-deposited SbCl3 into crystalline Sb2S3 through the reaction with H2S at 300 °C without the first conversion, and found that the direct conversion was feasible but not complete, even with the reaction time of more than 1 hour. As shown in Fig. S1,† the Sb2S3/TiO2 film, fabricated through the sequential deposition and the subsequent annealing, demonstrates stronger absorption in the entire visible light region as compared with the counterpart fabricated through the direct conversion without the first H2S treatment.
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to investigate the effects of the different salt concentrations on the morphology of Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 3, the Sb2S3/TiO2 films show similar morphologies with the concentrations between 10 and 16 mg ml−1, except for the increase in particle size as the concentration increases, as compared with those of the pure TiO2 film. In addition, we observed that the gaps between the TiO2 nanoparticles became smaller after the deposition (inset of Fig. 3a). Thus, the loading amount of SbCl3 within the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold would increase with the concentration. Accordingly, the loading amount of Sb2S3 could be simply controlled by adjusting the concentration of SbCl3. The result is different from the previous reports for the CBD and SILAR deposited Sb2S3, where the deposited Sb2S3 did not cover conformally on the TiO2 particles, but rather coated on clusters of TiO2.5,16 Different from the reported processes, where the deposition of Sb2S3 on the TiO2 film is strongly related to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth process, the sequential deposition process reported here involved a simple in situ solid–gas reaction between SbCl3 pre-coated on the TiO2 film and H2S under a certain humidity, thus ensuring homogeneous deposition of Sb2S3 on the TiO2 film.

With further increase of the salt concentration up to 19%, additional pebble-shaped Sb2S3 particles were observed to disperse disorderly on the TiO2 surface, and the sizes increased with the concentration. At the concentration of 25 mg ml−1, clusters of Sb2S3 were formed with a large coverage on the surface of the TiO2 film, as shown in Fig. 3f, indicating that the morphology of the Sb2S3 on the TiO2 film is strongly related to the SbCl3 concentration. For checking the distribution of Sb2S3 within the porous TiO2 film, the elemental distribution maps of Sb, S, Ti and O were recorded on the cross section by EDX scan of the cross-sectional FESEM image. As shown in Fig. S2,† a deep penetration of Sb2S3 into the 1.3 μm-thick mp-TiO2 was demonstrated with a homogeneous distribution throughout the mp-TiO2 substrate.
For comparison, the CBD method was also employed for the preparation of Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films according to the previous report.4 As shown in Fig. S3a,† the as-prepared Sb2S3 film is orange in color, similar to that reported previously.7–13 Surprisingly, after further H2S treatment as described above, the film became darker remarkably, with enhanced absorption in the visible spectral region. Accordingly, after the thermal annealing, the enhanced absorption was also observed as compared to the CBD film without the H2S treatment (as shown in Fig. S3b†). The result strongly indicated that an appreciable amount of antimony oxides was generated during the deposition of Sb2S3 by the CBD method, consistent with the previous observations.21,22 The result also demonstrates that the oxides generated during the CBD process could be transformed into Sb2S3 after the additional H2S treatment.12,30 In addition, trace amounts of chlorine were observed in the resulting Sb2S3 film, as shown in Fig. S4.† For checking the purity of Sb2S3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted for the Sb2S3 layer deposited on TiO2 films by two different methods. One was prepared by the conventional CBD method and further annealing at 300 °C under an Ar atmosphere, and the other prepared by the sequential deposition approach as described above. The narrow-scan XPS spectra of Sb 3d are depicted in Fig. 4a. For the CBD sample, the deconvolution of the Sb 3d3/2 core level displays two chemical states of Sb2S3, further confirming that Sb2O3 was present on the surface of the Sb2S3, while the other sample exhibits two sharp peaks, corresponding to a single chemical state of Sb2S3. It is clear that the sequential deposition reported here favors the formation of pure Sb2S3 as compared to the CBD method. Fig. 4b shows X-ray diffraction patterns of the Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films fabricated through the CBD and the sequential deposition. Both the samples show almost identical XRD patterns, exactly matching orthorhombic Sb2S3 (JCPDS No. 42-1393),13 and no significant variation in the lattice parameters was observed in spite of the presence of antimony oxides in the CBD sample as mentioned above. We speculated that the oxide would be in an amorphous state and/or buried in crystalline Sb2S3, and could not be detected here. In summary, the sequential deposition method reported here is facile and rapid for the homogeneous formation of pure Sb2S3 on the TiO2 film, as compared with the CBD and ALD methods reported previously. In addition, our preliminary studies found that this method can be applied to the deposition of other binary chalcogenides such as CdS, SnS, and PbS, and also ternary chalcogenides such as CuSbS2.

Using the Sb2S3-coated TiO2 films prepared by the sequential deposition method, solid-state solar cells were fabricated with poly(3-hexylthiphen) (P3HT) as the hole transport material. Here, the devices were prepared with various concentrations of Sb2S3 solutions used in the deposition (10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25 mg ml−1), and accordingly the devices were denoted as D-10, D-13, D-16, D-19, D-22 and D-25, respectively. For comparison, CBD-based devices were fabricated according to the previous report,5 under identical conditions apart from the method for the deposition of Sb2S3. The maximum power conversion efficiencies are shown in Table 1.

For the devices with the sequentially deposited Sb2S3, we observed that the photovoltaic performance was strongly dependent on the concentrations of SbCl3 solutions. Initially, the value of the Jsc enhanced from 10.15 mA cm−2 to 14.73 mA cm−2 when the concentration of SbCl3 increased from 10 mg ml−1 to 16 mg ml−1, and the Voc increased from 472 mV to 645 mV. The increase in Jsc would be related to the enhanced light harvesting ability of the device due to the increased loading amount of Sb2S3, and the increase in Voc would be explained by low back recombination due to higher coverage of Sb2S3 on the TiO2 surface. However, we observed that the Jsc decreased significantly from 14.73 mA cm−2 to 4.58 mA cm−2 when the concentration further increased from 16 mg ml−1 to 25 mg ml−1. A similar trend was observed in ALD-based Sb2S3 solar cells,24 and could be explained by the reduction of the driving force for interfacial electron transfer associated with the decreasing degrees of quantum confinement.23 In our cases, we observed that additional Sb2S3 particles and clusters were generated and disorderly distributed on the TiO2 film when high concentrations of SbCl3 were employed (as shown in Fig. 3), which would deteriorate charge separation at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface.31 The optimal concentration of the SbCl3 was 16 mg ml−1 for the deposition of Sb2S3 on the TiO2 film, exhibiting a maximum PCE of 6.27%, with a Jsc of 14.73 mA cm−2, a Voc of 645 mV, and a FF of 65.69%, under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5a. For the CBD device, the champion device gave a Jsc of 10.12 mA cm−2, a Voc of 555 mV, and a FF of 54.32, corresponding to a PCE of 3.52%, similar to the values reported in the literature for CBD-based Sb2S3 devices.5,16 It should be noted that current efficient Sb2S3-solar cells usually employed nanoporous TiO2 films with relatively large TiO2 particle sizes (∼50 nm).9,13,20 In this work, the TiO2 film used was fabricated using commercial TiO2 (P25) with small particle sizes (∼25 nm) as shown in Fig. 2. It seems that the deposition of Sb2S3 and the penetration of the hole transport material would be limited within the TiO2 film.27 In addition, further improvement could be expected through modification of the TiO2 film32–35 and optimization of the hole transport material.12,15 Very recently, D. Raptis et al. have proposed an easy and efficient method for the deposition of antimony sulfide on mesoporous TiO2 films through spin-coating its precursor solution (SbCl3 and thiourea in DMF), and the device gave a PCE of 3.5%, comparable with the value (3.8%) of CBD-based devices.36

In order to investigate the light response of Sb2S3 devices, we measured IPCE (incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency), as shown in Fig. 5b. Compared with the CBD-device, the device with Sb2S3 by sequential deposition showed a higher IPCE in the entire spectral regions, although the absorption spectral edges of both the films were the same near 750 nm wavelength. The higher IPCE would be ascribed to the relatively high light harvesting ability and low back recombination of the latter as discussed above.
Conclusions
Herein, we report a sequential deposition method based on an in situ solid–gas reaction for the formation of an Sb2S3 absorber within a mesoporous TiO2 film. Different from conventional methods, this method is facile and rapid for the deposition of pure Sb2S3 without the oxide. In addition, the loading amount of Sb2S3 within the porous TiO2 film can be simply controlled through adjusting the concentration of SbCl3 solution. Moreover, this deposition technique can be applied to other binary chalcogenides such as CdS, SnS, and PbS, and also ternary chalcogenides such as CuSbS2. Using this technique, Sb2S3 based solid-state solar cells were fabricated with a maximum power conversion efficiency of up to 6.27%. This method provides new opportunities for the fabrication of sulfide-based semiconductor devices.
