However, a detailed understanding on the photocarrier dynamics in PSCs consisting of fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETLs is still lacking. Here, we use ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy to analyze the corresponding photocarrier dynamics across fullerene-modified SnO2 ETLs in PSCs. Both the C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA)-modified SnO2 ETL and 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)-modified SnO2 ETL which have a favorable energy band edge alignment to perovskites, result in an enhanced electron injection rate after introducing these two fullerenes into SnO2-based PSCs compared to the SnO2 ETL without modification. Moreover, combining chemical measurements and density functional theory simulation results, it is confirmed that the interfacial chemical bond is tailored between the SnO2 surface and carboxylic acids of CPTA, thus establishing interface dipoles. Due to the existence of interface dipoles, the chemisorption of the CPTA fullerene functions as a recombination suppressor both at the CPTA-passivated SnO2/perovskite interface and inside perovskites. By contrast, the physisorption of the PC61BM fullerene on the SnO2 ETL exhibits relatively high recombination rates both at the SnO2/perovskite interface and inside perovskites. Therefore, the PSC based on the SnO2/CPTA ETL yields a PCE of more than 19%, which is superior to that of the reference PSC using PC61BM as a passivator (<18%). This study describes that interfacial carrier dynamics in PSCs consisting of fullerene-modified ETLs can be clearly resolved using ultrafast spectroscopy, which further provides guidance for future design for interfacial modification of ETLs.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials due to their solution processability, bandgap tunability, large absorption coefficient and long diffusion lengths.1–12 Due to the compositional tailoring of perovskites and design of evolutionary device structures, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exceeded 25%,13 which is comparable to those of commercial crystalline silicon solar cells. The most common architecture of PSCs is constructed with a few-hundred-nanometer-thick perovskite photoabsorber, which is sandwiched between hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs).14 Conventional PSCs usually consist of a TiO2 ETL that requires high-temperature sintering (>450 °C) to obtain the conductive phase.15,16 Such a rigorous process will limit the practical application of PSCs, which restricts its potential for large-scale solution-processing on flexible substrates.17 The recent advance in the development of an innovative ETL inside PSCs is the replacement of TiO2 ETLs with low-temperature processable (<150 °C) SnO2 ETLs.18 In addition to the benefit of processing temperature, SnO2 also exhibits higher carrier mobility and superior ultraviolet light soaking stability compared with its TiO2 counterpart.19–21 Nevertheless, the presence of partially amorphous SnOx at the SnO2 surface leads to the formation of oxygen-vacancy defects, which may act as trap states.22 These defect states may capture electrons that are injected from perovskite crystals, leading to severe electron–hole recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface. Surface passivation of SnO2 using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) consisting of various molecular moieties provides an effective strategy to suppress the formation of defects.23,24 In particular, fullerene-derivatives are the most attractive candidates for surface passivation of SnO2 because of their designable functional groups, high mobility and solution processability.22,25 After modification of SnO2 using fullerene-derivatives, the electron transport from perovskites to SnO2/fullerene ETLs is largely improved, leading to promising PCEs for PSCs.22,25–32 Many research studies have come to the conclusion that suitable interfacial modification using fullerene-derivatives on a SnO2 surface can significantly reduce trap state density and facilitate the interfacial charge transfer.22,25–29,31,32 Most of these studies employed enhanced photoluminescence (PL) quenching or decreased PL decay lifetime to account for the improved interfacial charge transfer efficiencies of PSCs consisting of SnO2/fullerene ETLs.22,26–29,31,32 However, both PL quenching and PL decay lifetime may only provide information on the radiative recombination process of electrons and holes in the perovskite absorber under illumination. Because the performances of PSC devices are largely influenced by the respective processes such as charge separation, carrier injection, and radiative and non-radiative recombination inside devices,33 we may require more sophisticated measurements to gain insight into the corresponding carrier dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes under illumination due to interfacial modification between perovskites and SnO2 ETLs.
In this work, we would like to employ ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy to explore the origin of photocarrier dynamics of both electrons and holes at the interfaces of perovskites and fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETLs and inside perovskites. Recently, it has been reported that SnO2 ETLs modified with a surface-bound fullerene monolayer significantly improved the device performance and reproducibility of PSCs, where the formation of interfacial chemical bonds of passivating fullerene molecules at the SnO2 interface effectively reduces the number of defects and enhances carrier extraction efficiencies.22,25 Herein, two representative fullerene-derivatives C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) and 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were used to modify the SnO2 ETLs in PSCs, respectively. The carboxylic acid (COOH) group of CPTA is covalently anchored at the SnO2 surface with chemical interaction as shown in Fig. 1a, as a result of chemisorption. In comparison, the PC61BM molecule can only be physically coated on the top of SnO2 without forming covalent bonding on the SnO2 surface as shown in Fig. 1b, as a result of physisorption. Through ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we found that both photocarrier injection and recombination processes at the interfaces between perovskites and ETLs behave differently for the PSCs consisting of SnO2/CPTA, SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2-only ETLs. Both the PSC devices consisting of SnO2 ETLs modified with chemisorption (SnO2/CPTA) and physisorption (SnO2/PC61BM) of fullerene-derivatives exhibit enhanced electron injection efficiencies compared to the SnO2-only device without any interfacial modification. By contrast, the PSC device consisting of a SnO2/CPTA ETL exhibits significantly reduced recombination rates both at the SnO2/perovskite interface and inside perovskites, compared to the PSC devices consisting of PC61BM-modified SnO2 and SnO2-only ETLs. The formation of interfacial dipoles at the SnO2/CPTA ETL due to chemical interactions with bond formation between SnO2 and passivating fullerene-derivatives effectively suppresses the back recombination at the ETL/perovskite interfaces. Moreover, the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination time of electrons and holes inside perovskites was also extended in the SnO2/CPTA system. The result shows excellent agreement with underlying PCEs of 19.2% for the PSC consisting of the SnO2/CPTA ETL, 17.9% for the PC61BM-based device and 16.4% for the SnO2-only device. The revelation of the origin of photocarrier dynamics of both electrons and holes in PSCs consisting of fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETLs through ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy highlights that the chemisorption of fullerene-derivatives such as the CPTA passivator at the SnO2 surface can effectively optimize photocarrier dynamics in the SnO2-based PSC, thus providing guidelines for future designing of interface modifiers in high-performance PSCs.

The SnO2 ETL easily undergoes a hydrolysis reaction in air, thus the defect-containing SnO2 surface typically consisting of under-coordinated Sn atoms which form chemical bonds with the OH groups on the SnO2 surface,30 as shown in Fig. 1b. These terminal OH groups have been reported to provide chemical anchoring positions for fullerene passivators.25 Next, we would like to analyze the bonding configurations between SnO2 and different fullerene-derivatives. To create various fullerene passivation configurations at the SnO2 surface, a 2 mg ml−1 CPTA solution in dimethylformamide (DMF) and a 2 mg ml−1 PC61BM solution in chlorobenzene (CB) were, respectively, spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO/SnO2 substrate, and then heated at 140 °C for 10 min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to analyze the interaction between the fullerene and SnO2. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the core level binding energy of the Sn 3d orbital for the SnO2/CPTA film is higher than that for the pristine SnO2 film, which is the evidence of the existence of extra negative charge accumulation around the CPTA-coated Sn atom. It can be explained that CPTA molecules as a Lewis base offer additional lone pair electrons to under-coordinated Sn atoms caused by abundant oxygen vacancies at the SnO2 surface, and thus form aCPTA–SnO2 adduct. By contrast, there is no Sn 3d signal offset for the SnO2/PC61BM and the bare SnO2 samples. The lack of a XPS chemical shift is directly related to the physical attachment between the methyl ester-terminated (COOCH3) PC61BM fullerene and SnO2 film. We further provide the core level binding energy of the O 1s orbital to support the formation of the CPTA–SnO2 adduct, as shown in Fig. S1.† The O 1s peaks at 532.1 eV and 533.2 eV were assigned to terminal OH groups and COO groups, respectively.34 Compared with that of the other two samples, the XPS intensity of the SnO2/CPTA film at 532.1 eV was decreased, indicating that these OH groups at SnO2 surface reacted with CPTA. That is, the CPTA molecule covering on SnO2 increases. The XPS intensity of the SnO2/CPTA film at 533.2 eV (COO group of the CPTA molecule) was thus increased. Moreover, the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that a stronger binding energy of the COOH group from CPTA versus the under-coordinated Sn atom from SnO2 is found as shown in ESI Fig. S2a† as a result of forming a chemical bond.35 The chemical interactions at fullerene/SnO2 interfaces were further revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Fig. 1d shows the FTIR spectra of SnO2 treated with CPTA and PC61BM, respectively. The symmetric CO stretching vibration (1731 cm−1)36 and C–H scissoring vibration (1430 cm−1)37 were detected in both samples due to the presence of these two functional groups in their backbone structures. Only SnO2/CPTA film exhibits a characteristic peak near 1380 cm−1, which is caused by the carboxylic acid stretching vibrations of the symmetric C–OH bond36,38 in CPTA. After the annealing process at 140 °C, the intermolecular interaction between carboxylic acids increases and further forms acid anhydride bonds at 1783 cm−1.36 In addition, these carboxylic acids from CPTA located at the SnO2 surface underwent an esterification reaction with OH groups on the surface of under-coordinated Sn atoms (that is, Sn–OH + COOH–CPTA → Sn–COO–CPTA + H2O), inducing stretching vibrations of the antisymmetric COO group (1624 cm−1)36 in the SnO2/CPTA film. By contrast, because the PC61BM molecule does not have any acid group, there is no chemical interaction between PC61BM and SnO2 as shown in both XPS and FTIR spectra. In the following sections, the SnO2/CPTA ETL represents the electron transporting layer with chemisorption of fullerene-derivatives on the SnO2 surface while the SnO2/PC61BM ETL represents the SnO2 ETL with physisorption of fullerene-derivatives. As a result, the esterification of COOH (terminal group of CPTA) with the OH group on the surface of SnO2 occurred at the SnO2/CPTA interface. After dehydration, the chemical Sn–COO–CPTA bond was generated. By contrast, since the COOCH3 group does not react with the OH group, only physisorption occurred between SnO2 and PC61BM, where the COOCH3 and OH groups were retained.
The fullerene interface modifiers with various passivation configurations were incorporated into the SnO2/perovskite interface in the solar cell structure consisting of indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) anode/fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETL/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) HTL/Au cathode. More details about the device fabrication processes are described in the ESI.† Fig. S3(a)–(c)† show the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of PSCs prepared with different ETLs. These images are quite similar. Therefore, Fig. 2a only provides the SEM image of a representative PSC with the fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETL; the SnO2/fullerene ETL is about 25 nm thick. We further observed the top-view SEM images of the perovskite crystals deposited on various ETLs, as shown in Fig. S3(d)–(f).† The good wettability promotes homogeneous reactions between CPTA and perovskite precursors; thus the growth of perovskite crystals on the SnO2/CPTA ETL obtains a larger domain size than that of the other two substrates. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of best-performing PSCs based on SnO2-only, SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2/CPTA ETLs are shown in Fig. 2b. The corresponding solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. Both the PCEs of PSC devices consisting of fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETLs (CPTA or PC61BM) exhibit improved performance compared to that of the SnO2-only PSC without any interfacial modification. Among these three solar cells, the PSC device with the SnO2/CPTA ETL achieves the best PCE of 19.2% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.67 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 79.5% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.06 V. The PSC incorporating a SnO2/PC61BM ETL exhibits the photovoltaic performance of a JSC of 21.91 mA cm−2, a FF of 77.4%, and a VOC of 1.06 V, yielding a PCE of 17.9%. The SnO2-only PSC device without any interfacial modification shows the lowest PCE of 16.4%. The above result indicates that the PSC consisting of a SnO2/CPTA ETL through chemical passivation on the surface of SnO2 yields the best photovoltaic performance, consistent with a previous report.19 In addition, interface passivation usually has a significant impact on the hysteresis effect of the PSCs. Fig. S4† shows the J–V curves of the SnO2, SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2/CPTA-modified PSCs, when scanning from forward bias to short-circuit (from FB to SC), and then backwards (from SC to FB). The J–V hysteresis observed when using SnO2/CPTA as the ETL is smallest compared to the abnormal hysteresis presented in devices using the SnO2 or SnO2/PC61BM ETLs. This shows that chemical interface modification can greatly reduce hysteresis in PSCs. Furthermore, the various FF values in PSCs were related to the different carrier transport resistance caused by various interfaces between the perovskite and ETLs. As shown in Fig. S5,† the Nyquist curves of PSCs with various ETLs were measured at VOC under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. There was only one arc obtained at high frequency under illumination, referring to the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at the interface between the perovskite and charge transporter in the PSC.39 As a result, the smallest RCT in the SnO2/CPTA system was ascribed to better contact between the perovskite and the chemically modified SnO2/CPTA ETL, leading to a smaller carrier transport barrier at interfaces and the higher FF value. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CPTA-modified PSC is also shown in Fig. S6† with values of >75% at 350–760 nm wavelengths. As shown in Fig. S7,† we carefully prepared more than 10 separate devices to make sure the performance reproducibility of fullerene-passivated PSCs. The statistical trend is highly consistent with the optimal PSCs in Fig. 2b. Accordingly, CPTA is an excellent passivator candidate through chemical bonding with the SnO2 ETL, resulting in an optimized photovoltaic conversion compared to that of SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2-only PSC devices. Fig. 2c exhibits the PL spectra of the corresponding devices consisting of SnO2/CPTA, SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2-only ETLs. For comparison, the PL spectrum of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is also shown. The pure CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite exhibits the strongest PL signal due to the lack of an ETL to extract photogenerated carriers. As a SnO2 ETL is inserted, the corresponding PL intensity of the perovskite film in the SnO2-only device was quenched as a result of enhanced charge separation at the perovskite/SnO2 ETL interface. The PL quenching efficiencies at SnO2/perovskite interfaces are further enhanced after the passivation of SnO2 with PC61BM and CPTA molecules. The enhanced charge separation efficiencies of these devices consisting of surface-passivated fullerene SnO2 ETLs can be further evident from the corresponding TRPL decay curves as shown in Fig. 2d. The TRPL decay curves can be fitted using a bi-exponential function, where each PL decay curve was resolved with two different PL decay lifetimes and their corresponding fractional amplitudes. The fast PL decay lifetime represents the electron injection into ETLs under strong excitation, and the slow PL decay lifetime represents the radiative recombination of electrons and holes under weak excitation.40 Averaging these two components can fully describe the PL decay lifetime. The average PL decay lifetime (τ) was calculated through the amplitude-weighted average of the two above-mentioned fitting lifetimes. The bare perovskite film shows an average PL decay lifetime τ of 150.5 ns, whereas τ exhibits a dramatic decrease for the samples after inserting the ETLs of SnO2 with and without passivation using fullerene-derivatives. The PL decay lifetimes for the SnO2-only, SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2/CPTA samples are 22.8 ns, 18.7 ns and 13.6 ns respectively. The perovskite incorporating the SnO2/CPTA ETL where CPTA is chemically passivated on the SnO2 surface exhibits the lowest PL intensity and the shortest PL lifetime, indicating the most efficient charge separation. The above results of PL quenching spectra and TRPL decay curves also show a consistent trend with the corresponding photovoltaic performances.

Nevertheless, both PL quenching spectra and TRPL decay curves as mentioned above only provide information on the radiative recombination process of remaining electrons and holes in the perovskite absorber after photoexcitation. In practical photovoltaic devices, the photogenerated carrier dynamics are related to several different processes such as carrier generation, charge separation, carrier injection and non-radiative recombination. To gain a more detailed understanding on these mechanisms of photocarrier dynamics due to the passivation of SnO2 using fullerene-derivative molecules, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was employed to explore the detailed carrier dynamics at the fullerene-modified SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface. According to our previous report,41 the detailed experimental setup for transient absorption measurement is described in Fig. S8.† The ultrafast pump-probe studies were performed using a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser delivering a near infrared (800 nm) pulse with a ∼40 fs duration at a 5 kHz repetition rate. The 800 nm laser pulse was split into two pulses with a power ratio of 10:1 using a beam splitter. The 800 nm pulse with higher intensity was focused into a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal for a second harmonic (SH) generation of 400 nm. The 400 nm laser pulse was focused on the sample as a pump pulse after a delay stage, which was used to control the delay time between pump and probe pulses. Meanwhile, the 800 nm pulse with lower intensity (∼5 μJ for pulse energy) was focused on a sapphire plate with a thickness of 2 mm to generate a white light continuum (WLC, 450–775 nm) as a probe pulse. Both pump (400 nm) and WLC probe (450–775 nm) pulses were focused on the sample using a parabolic mirror. The probe pulse transmitted through the sample was guided into a charge coupled device (CCD) camera through an optical fiber and polychromator (CP140, Yobin Yvon). An optical chopper running at 2.5 kHz was used to modulate the pump beam for absorption change measurements between with and without sample excitation. Here, the samples used for transient absorption measurements had the same device architecture as the solar cells. In the experiments, the pump source with a wavelength of 400 nm was used to optically excite electrons to states above the conduction band (CB) of the perovskite layer, leaving behind holes in the valence band (VB). By selecting the suitable wavelengths from the broadband probe light source, we are able to selectively investigate the photocarrier dynamics of both electrons and holes.

Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the two-dimensional (2D) plots of time evolution of transient absorption spectra (ΔA) of the samples SnO2/CPTA/perovskite, SnO2/PC61BM/perovskite, and SnO2/perovskite, respectively. Fig. 3(d)–(f) exhibit the corresponding transient ΔA spectra of these samples at two representative times of 30 ps and 1000 ps, respectively. The ΔA in the wavelength region between ∼550 nm and ∼700 nm is dominated by the positive signal due to the photo-induced absorption (PIA).42,43 When selecting wavelengths shorter than ∼700 nm, the probe light is largely absorbed by photoexcited electrons in the CB, promoting the photoexcited electrons to higher states as electrons in the VB are depopulated by the pump pulse and accumulated near the edge of the CB. These electron transition processes may result in positive ΔA values. By contrast, as the probe light has wavelengths longer than ∼700 nm (i.e., the photon energy of probe light is close to the energy difference between the edges of the CB and VB), there is no absorption and transition of electrons between the CB and VB in a perovskite because the electrons at the edge of the VB are depopulated by the pump pulse. Therefore, the observed carrier dynamic behavior is mainly correlated with holes, where the ΔA is dominated by the negative signal corresponding to the ground state bleach or stimulated emission.42,43

The positive ΔA signals (red color) at shorter wavelengths and negative ΔA signals (blue color) at longer wavelengths (⪆700 nm) are separated by a contour where ΔA = 0 (white area). The corresponding ΔA profiles at 30 ps (blue line) and 1000 ps (orange line) for PSCs using the (d) SnO2/CPTA, (e) SnO2/PC61BM and (f) SnO2 ETLs. 
In order to obtain the dynamics of photoexcited carriers quantitatively, moment analysis was employed to extract the time-dependent numbers of photoexcited electrons and holes from the pump-probe spectra,44 as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). For example, the 0th moment μ0 is the area of the ΔA absorption spectrum, which associates with the number of photoexcited carriers relaxing from some energy states to others.41 Through integrating the positive ΔA signal (red areas along the dashed arrows) in Fig. 3(a)–(c), the total number (i.e., the 0th moment, μ0,e) of photoexcited electrons excited to higher energy states in the CB can be obtained as a function of delay time as depicted in Fig. 4a. Here, the 0th moment, μ0,e, can be fitted using a multi-exponential function to extract the photoexcited electron dynamics at different time scales. The fast relaxation process with time constant τinj is attributed to the injection of the photoexcited electrons from perovskites into the ETLs, while the slow relaxation process with time constant τe,r is mainly attributed to the remaining photoexcited electrons in the CB of perovskites relaxing via non-radiative recombination through trap (defect or impurity) states, grain boundaries, etc.45 For the SnO2-only device, the injection time τinj is ∼1.01 ps which is larger than those of PSC devices consisting of SnO2/CPTA and SnO2/PC61BM ETLs. The electron injection time τinj for SnO2/CPTA and SnO2/PC61BM devices is much shorter and 0.56 ps and 0.63 ps respectively. The result indicates that the surface-passivation with CPTA and PC61BM on SnO2 significantly enhances the injection rate (1/τinj) of photoexcited electrons from perovskites into ETLs. The enhanced electron injection rate after fullerene passivation may be mainly attributed to the effective passivation of oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETLs.25 In addition, it was also reported that the passivation of fullerene-derivatives may further increase the work functions of the SnO2 ETL, giving a more appropriate energy band alignment for electron injection from perovskites into SnO2 ETLs.25 On the other hand, the slow relaxation time τe,r in the SnO2/CPTA-based PSC is 641 ps, which is remarkably longer than that of SnO2/PC61BM-based (τe,r = 450 ps) and SnO2-based (τe,r = 457 ps) devices. This result implies that the photoexcited electrons could stay in the CB of perovskites in the SnO2/CPTA-based device for a longer time. According to the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S9†), it can be known that the crystallinity of the perovskite grown on the SnO2/CPTA ETL is the best one. Better crystallinity has fewer internal defects. Thus photoexcited electrons can survive for a longer time in the SnO2/CPTA ETL-based PSC. To further understand the discrepancy of the corresponding carrier dynamic behaviors of these samples, the hole dynamics of the SnO2/CPTA and SnO2/PC61BM and SnO2-only devices are also revealed. The measured blue areas in Fig. 3(a)–(c) were attributed to the hole dynamics and the total number (i.e., the 0th moment, μ0,h) of holes generated in the VB can be obtained as a function of delay time as presented in Fig. 4b by integrating the negative ΔA signal (blue areas). The 0th moment, μ0,h, can be fitted using a multi-exponential function to extract the hole dynamics. Two relaxation time constants τ1h,rec and τ2h,rec for these samples can be extracted from the decay curves. For the holes in the VB of perovskites after photoexcitation, there are two major possible non-radiative recombination processes; one is the recombination with electrons through traps or defect states within the gap, while the other relaxation process is attributed to the non-radiative recombination with electrons from the interfaces between perovskites and SnO2 ETLs. Typically, the non-radiative recombination process of electrons and holes through traps or defects may exhibit a longer lifetime.46 Accordingly, the relaxation process of holes with a smaller time constant τ1h,rec is mainly attributed to the back recombination with electrons at the interfaces between perovskites and SnO2 ETLs, while the larger time constant τ2h,rec stems from the recombination with electrons through traps or grain boundaries.45 The SnO2/CPTA-based PSC demonstrates a longer recombination time τ1h,rec of 124 ps, compared to the SnO2/PC61BM-based (τ1h,rec = 102 ps) and SnO2-only (τ1h,rec = 73 ps) devices. The result clearly shows that the back recombination rate (1/τ1h,rec) at the interface between the perovskite and SnO2 ETL is largely suppressed in the SnO2/CPTA-based PSC which consists of chemically bound fullerene molecules on the SnO2 surface, as compared to the SnO2/PC61BM-based and SnO2-only PSCs. Moreover, the SnO2/CPTA-based PSC also exhibits a longer non-radiative recombination time τ2h,rec of 1013 ps as compared with the SnO2/PC61BM-based device with τ2h,rec = 838 ps and the SnO2-only device with τ2h,rec = 740 ps, consistent with the observed trend of electron recombination times τe,r as mentioned above. The above result suggests that chemisorption of CPTA molecules on the SnO2 surface can also effectively slow down the non-radiative recombination of holes in the VB with electrons either at the SnO2/perovskite interfaces or through traps and defect states inside perovskites. The above result revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy clearly suggests that the photoexcited carrier dynamics of both electrons and holes in the PSCs consisting of fullerene-derivative modified SnO2 ETLs strongly depend on the bonding configurations of chemisorption and physisorption of these passivation molecules.

(b) The time-dependent number of photoexcited holes (μ0,h) obtained by integrating the blue area in Fig. 3(a)–(c). 
Next, we performed DFT simulations to further understand the effect of bonding configurations of fullerene-derivatives at the SnO2 surface on their charge distributions and corresponding potential profiles after interface modification. Here, we used two functional groups Sn–COO–H and [Sn–OH, COOCH3–H] as shown in Fig. 5a and b to represent the bonding configurations of chemisorption of SnO2/CPTA and physisorption of SnO2/PC61BM, respectively. The terminal functional groups (COOH and COOCH3) were used to replace the entire fullerene molecule to react with the surface of SnO2 for simplification and the dangling bonds were saturated with hydrogen atoms to avoid boundary effects. The different charge plots for these two passivated models of Sn–COO–H and [Sn–OH, COOCH3–H] as depicted in Fig. 5c and d represent the resulting charge redistributions of chemisorption and physisorption of fullerene-derivatives on the SnO2 surface. The charge redistribution on the SnO2 surface after the modification of two functional groups is defined asQ (charge difference) = Q (SnO2 + interface modifier) − Q (SnO2) − Q (interface).

(b) Calculation results show that there is no interaction between the SnO2 surface and COOCH3 group of PC61BM. Charge difference for the SnO2 surface and terminal group of fullerenes in the (c) SnO2–CPTA system and (d) SnO2–PC61BM system. (e) Schematic diagram (left) and corresponding summarized results (right) of the overall photocarrier dynamics of SnO2-based PSCs without (the pristine device) or with fullerene modification (CPTA or PC61BM devices). τinj, τe,r, τ2h,rec and τ1h,rec are electron injection times, non-radiative recombination times through trap states, non-radiative recombination times of electrons and holes in perovskites through trap states and back recombination time at the interfaces, respectively. 
It is clearly shown that in the SnO2–CPTA system (that is, Sn–COO–H), the charge density above the SnO2 surface increases while the charge density below the SnO2 surface decreases. The formation of chemical bonding between Sn and O atoms results in the “pull” of electron density out of the SnO2 surface, increasing its surface potential. In contrast, there is negligible charge redistribution occurring at the SnO2–PC61BM system (that is, Sn–OH and COOCH3–H) as a result of physisorption. The formation of interfacial dipole moments in the SnO2–CPTA system as a result of forming chemically bound Sn–O bonds may effectively prevent the back recombination of electrons injected into the SnO2 ETL with the remaining holes in the perovskite. Therefore, the modification with CPTA on the SnO2/perovskite interface can effectively hinder its back recombination due to the presence of interfacial dipoles at the SnO2 ETL. By contrast, the COOCH3 group covering the surface of SnO2 (SnO2/PC61BM ETL) is a physical adsorption without forming a directional dipole moment so that the effect to prevent the back recombination is not so effective as compared to that in the SnO2–COOH system (SnO2/CPTA ETL). In addition, it is expected that the back recombination rate is reduced for the SnO2/PC61BM device as compared to the SnO2-only device due to the insertion of a passivation layer. The above result clearly explains the observation of a longer hole recombination time in the ultrafast photocarrier dynamic analyses of the device consisting of the SnO2/CPTA ETL compared to those consisting of the SnO2/PC61BM ETL and the SnO2-only ETL. The suppression of back recombination at the interfaces based on the interfacial modification by forming dipoles using the chemically bound fullerene-derivative CPTA can effectively improve the PCE after interface modification. Fig. 5e summarizes the respective processes of carrier dynamics of the photoexcited electrons and holes at the SnO2/perovskite ETL interfaces after modification with fullerene-derivatives CPTA and PC61BM, respectively. Reduced electron injection times (τinj, refer to Process 1) after fullerene passivation can be observed in both samples consisting of chemisorption of the SnO2/CPTA ETL and physisorption of the SnO2/PC61BM ETL compared to that of the SnO2-only device, which is mainly attributed to the effective passivation of oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETLs22,25 and the formation of a more appropriate band alignment between the perovskite and SnO2 ETL after modification.34,47,48 The formation of surface dipoles in the chemisorption of the SnO2/CPTA ETL effectively increases the back recombination time (τ1h,rec, refer to Process 2) at the interfaces between the perovskite and SnO2 ETL as compared to that of the physisorption of the SnO2/PC61BM ETL which lacks formation of directional surface dipoles. In addition, the non-radiative recombination times of electrons (τe,r, refer to Process 3) and holes (τ2h,rec, refer to Process 4) in perovskites through traps or grain boundaries can be also prolonged through chemisorption of fullerene-derivatives on the SnO2 ETL. Consequently, surface bound CPTA acts as an effective chemical passivator in the SnO2 ETL-based PSC to assist in electron extraction, inhibit interfacial back recombination and reduce non-radiative recombination through traps and defects. The origin of the enhanced PCEs of PSCs by surface passivation on the SnO2 ETL with fullerene-derivatives can be clearly revealed and explained by the analyses of photocarrier dynamics of electrons and holes through ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy.
In summary, we have revealed the origin of the photocarrier dynamics of fullerene passivators in the SnO2-based PSCs through the ultrafast pump-probe technique. After chemical modification of SnO2 using CPTA, an interface dipole and an enlarged built-in potential energy are generated at the SnO2/CPTA interface. These results suggested that the SnO2 ETL modified with CPTA in the PSC exhibits efficient electron injection and reduced recombination rates, resulting in a high photovoltaic performance. By contrast, there is only physical interaction between SnO2 and PC61BM (without forming interfacial dipoles), which cannot effectively suppress the recombination rates both at the ETL/perovskite interface and inside perovskites. Our findings clarify the photocarrier dynamics in PSCs consisting of the fullerene-passivated SnO2 ETLs and explain the correlation with the improved photovoltaic performances.
