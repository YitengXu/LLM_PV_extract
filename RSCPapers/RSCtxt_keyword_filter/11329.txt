    , Accepted 2nd June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractThe fluorination of polymer donors through substituting hydrogen atoms by fluorine atoms on aromatic rings have been widely used in highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, this fluorination process suffers from complicated synthesis and low yields. Herein, through replacing the methyl group with a trifluoromethyl group, the feasibility of synthetically-simple fluorination towards high-performance polymer donors is demonstrated. Two structurally similar polymer donors, one having a trifluoromethyl (–CF3) group and the other with a methyl (–CH3) pendant group for comparison, were designed and synthesized. By comparing these two donors, we found that the –CF3 group addition lowered the HOMO energy level and increased absorption through improved intermolecular interactions. Single-junction solar cells based on the trifluoromethylated donor yield a maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.5%, representing a nearly two-fold increase compared with that of devices using the methylated counterpart. These findings reveal great potential of fluorinating polymer donors by the trifluoromethyl group to improve solar cell performance.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture have attracted much attention given their promising application as components for large-area flexible solar panels that can be fabricated through low-cost solution coating techniques.1,2 Recent developments in polymer donors3 and non-fullerene acceptors4–10 have led to a dramatic increase in performance with power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16%.11,12 Ideally, polymer donors should exhibit complementary absorption profiles to acceptors to maximize photo-absorption and current generation. Adding to this selection rule is the need for the energy levels of polymer donors to be appropriately aligned with those of electron acceptors to provide a small but sufficient offset to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation while minimizing energy loss during photocurrent generation.13–19 In addition, favorable mixing of donors and acceptors to form a nanoscale bi-continuous interpenetrating network facilitates charge separation. Finally, balanced electron/hole mobility of donor/acceptor blends is critical for efficient charge transport.
Many design strategies have been developed to alter the optoelectronic properties of polymer donors so that they meet the requirements mentioned above. For example, changing the backbone constituent from benzene moieties to thiophene moieties, tuning side groups from alkyl chains to thienyl chains and adjusting energy levels through introduction of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups have been reported to impact the macroscopic properties of polymer donors.3,20–22 Particularly, introducing fluorine (F) atoms into the conjugated backbone or in the side chain of conjugated polymers has been shown to improve the efficiencies of PSCs when these polymers, as opposed to their unfluorinated counterparts, are introduced as donors. This strategy is based on the high electronegativity of fluorine (4.0 in Pauling scale) which withdraws the electron density from the polymer backbone through an inductive effect although this effect is partially compensated by the resonance electron-donating effect due to interactions of fluorine's lone electron pairs with the π-conjugated system. The overall effect of introducing F atoms lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Consequently, this functionalization strategy has often resulted in improving the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the resulting PSCs.18 Additionally, fluorine can modulate the intermolecular interactions of conjugated polymers by altering their dipole moments, resulting in vastly different aggregation behavior.17
Generally, fluorine is introduced through aromatic fluorination reactions, which require multiple synthetic steps and tedious purification procedures.23,24 Here, aromatic fluorination happens when an aromatic hydrogen atom is substituted by a fluorine atom. As a result, the synthesis of such fluorinated donor materials is costly and time consuming. In order to simplify synthesis, efforts devoted to replacing –F in polymer donors with other readily-introduced electron-deficient groups, like chlorine, cyano, sulfonyl, and so on, have been reported.20,25,26 However, the PSCs that incorporate these non-fluorinated polymers as donors do not exhibit PCEs as high as those that use fluorinated polymers. Hence, it is critical to find an alternative to fluorine substituents without increasing the synthetic complexity.
Trifluoromethylated compounds have found many industrial applications ranging from dyes to pharmaceutics and agrochemicals. The trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) has a significant electronegativity value of 3.5, as measured using the Pauling scale.27 The constituent F atoms are also known to enhance intermolecular C–F⋯H, F⋯S, and C–F⋯π interactions.28,29 Most importantly, –CF3 can be easily introduced using 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol through an esterification reaction. Therefore, it is rational to speculate the feasibility of introducing the –CF3 group, as opposed to fluorine, into the molecular design of conjugated polymer donors. Despite great developments in the design of polymer donors, little work has been carried out in investigating the role of the trifluoromethyl group in polymer donors for solar cell applications.30,31
Herein, we designed and synthesized a trifluoromethylated polymer donor, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(2,5-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)thiophene carboxylate)] (F1), and its methylated variant, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(2,5-(ethyl thiophene carboxylate))] (F0). By comparing these two donors, we demonstrate that the –CF3 group helps lower the HOMO energy level, increase absorption and improve intermolecular interactions. The two polymers were blended with a recently reported non-fullerene acceptor,22IT-4F (3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene), to fabricate PSCs. Optimized F1/IT-4F-based PSCs exhibit a maximum efficiency of 13.5%, with a Voc of 0.933 V, Jsc of 20.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.0%. In contrast, PSCs based on F0/IT-4F blends exhibit a maximum PCE of 4.9%, with a Voc of 0.832 V, Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 44.1%.
Results and discussion
The synthesis routes of F0 and F1 are shown in Fig. 1; synthetic details are included in the ESI.† The electron withdrawing monomer esters (TMe and TFMe) can be easily obtained via an esterification reaction using 2,5-dibromothiophene-3-carbonyl chloride and a corresponding alcohol with high yields (over 90%). Compared to fluorinating the aromatic rings on the conjugated core,3,32 introducing the trifluoromethyl (–CF3) group into the conjugated core is easier. As shown in Fig. 1(d) and S16,† the reported aromatic fluorination of a polymer donor is synthetically difficult. While in our case, non-aromatic fluorination of F0 to F1 needs fewer synthesis steps. Besides, this avoids high-cost and dangerous reagents, such as n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The polymers were prepared by Stille coupling-based polymerization of 2,5-dibromothiophene-3-ester and 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (BDTT). The polymers were then purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexanes and finally extracted using chloroform. We determined the molecular weight of the polymers by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in o-dichlorobenzene at 145 °C with polystyrene as calibration standards. F0 and F1 exhibit number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 37.2 kg mol−1 (PDI = 2.1) and 40.3 kg mol−1 (PDI = 2.0), respectively. Both F0 and F1 are soluble in common solvents, including chloroform (CF), toluene (Tol) and chlorobenzene (CB).

To quantify the energy level differences between F0 and F1, we investigated their electrochemical properties through CV measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the onset oxidation potential of F1 is 0.80 V, which is 0.15 V higher than that of F0. This observation indicates that introducing the electron-withdrawing –CF3 group effectively lowers the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of the polymer donor from −5.35 eV (F0) to −5.50 eV (F1). The LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) are calculated to be −3.35 and −3.53 eV for F0 and F1, respectively, extracted from EHOMO and the optical bandgap. Fig. 2(a) presents the solid-state absorption spectra of the two polymers as well as their solution spectra in chlorobenzene. In the solid state, F0 and F1 show similar broad absorption from 450 nm to 600 nm with absorption edges (λon-set) at 620 nm and 630 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 2.00 eV and 1.97 eV for F0 and F1. Both polymers exhibit strong π–π* transition absorption maxima at around 520 nm (intrachain transition) and 580 nm (interchain transition).22,33F1 is more absorptive, with an absorption coefficient of 1.25 × 105 cm−1, compared to F0 (0.92 × 105 cm−1). Interestingly, the solution absorption profile of F1 is similar to the absorption profile of its solid state, whereas the solution absorption profile of F0 blueshifts substantially. This observation indicates that in solution and at room temperature, F1 remains strongly aggregated. This aggregation persists, even when the solution is diluted to 0.001 mg ml−1 of F1 in CB, as shown in Fig. S6.†

To confirm that the introduction of –CF3 enhances polymer aggregation, we measured the temperature-dependent absorption (TDA) spectra of F0 and F1 in CB. The absorption of F0 solution shows negligible temperature dependence. While for F1 solution, with increasing temperature from 30 to 80 °C, the absorption at 580 nm, which is assigned to interchain aggregation in F1, gradually disappears. This disaggregation, which is thermally reversible, results in a color change of the F1 solution from deep red to orange, as shown in the inset in Fig. 2(d). We attribute this TDA characteristic to the presence of dipole-induced Keesom interactions in F1. This interaction is temperature sensitive, the extent of which drastically decreases at high temperatures, likely as a result of increased twisting and disaggregation of F1.34,35 This Keesom interaction is reversible so F1 re-aggregates when the solution is cooled back to room temperature (Table 1).

To evaluate the electrical properties of F0 and F1 as potential donors in polymer solar cells, we fabricated devices with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The processing conditions for the active layer, including the donor/acceptor (D/A) blend ratio, additive concentration and annealing temperature, were optimized individually (see Fig. S3, S4 and S5 in the ESI†). The device fabrication details can be found in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, and corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. As expected from the lower-lying HOMO level of polymer F1 compared to F0, the best performing BHJ solar cell with F1 exhibits a Voc of 0.933 V that is higher than that of F0-based devices, whose record Voc is 0.832 V. A Jsc of 20.6 mA cm−2 can be achieved with the optimized F1-based device, while the Jsc is 13.5 mA cm−2 for the best performing F0 solar cell. The increased Jsc of the F1-based device compared to the F0 device matches well with the broader and higher EQE response from 300 to 800 nm in F1-based devices, as presented in the EQE curves (Fig. 3b). For the F1-based devices, the EQE values in the range 520–760 nm exceed 75%, and the maximum EQE recorded at 590 nm is 83%. In contrast, the EQE values of F0-based PSCs lie consistently below 60%. The higher EQE values of the F1/IT-4F-based PSC possibly result from its stronger active layer absorption, as shown in Fig. S3.† Consequently, the best-performing F1-based device gives a PCE of 13.5% with a FF of 70.0%. Meanwhile, the best PSC based on F0/IT-4F only shows a PCE of 4.9% with a FF of 44.1%.

Balanced transport of electrons and holes plays a vital role in obtaining high FFs of PSCs.36 Hence, we investigated active-layer mobilities using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole and electron-only devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Al, respectively, to determine the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the corresponding BHJ films (plotted in Fig. S7, ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities of F1/IT-4F films are (2.64 ± 0.45) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and (2.21 ± 0.36) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are both higher than those of F0/IT-4F films (μh = (3.72 ± 0.33) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = (1.10 ± 0.29) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). F1-based devices exhibit more balanced charge-carrier mobilities, which is consistent with F1-based solar cells exhibiting higher FFs.
We investigated the morphological characteristics of the neat films and blends of F1 and F0 with IT-4F through grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS), the results of which are summarized in Fig. 4. All of these films exhibit limited long-range ordering. We made the following assignments, based on the typical packing structure of this class of low-crystalline donor–acceptor polymers.37–40 The GIWAXS pattern of the neat F0 film, as shown in Fig. 4(a), shows a broad reflection at q = 0.37 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, which can be attributed to weak side-chain stacking of F0. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the diffraction of the F1 film exhibits increased ordering compared to the F0 film; in addition to the reflection at q = 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane direction due to side-chain stacking order in F1, we also observe a reflection at q = 1.62 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.88 Å) in the out-of-plane direction, which corresponds to pi–pi stacking characteristic in F1 preferentially normal to the substrate. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the respective blends of F0 and F1 with IT-4F exhibit similar trends; the F1/IT-4F blend film shows enhanced ordering compared to the F0/IT-4F blend film.

To gain an understanding of the structural differences induced by the introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) into polymers at the molecular level, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations of their oligomeric models, the results of which are shown in Fig. 5. Both polymers exhibit a largely planar backbone conformation with a dihedral angle between two adjacent thiophene units of around 5°. The finding that these polymers are conformationally similar is not surprising given that the steric hindrance of –CF3 is not significantly larger than that of –CH3. We calculated molecular energy levels of F0 and F1 based on one to three polymer repeating units, respectively (see in Fig. S15†). However, given its strong electron-withdrawing properties, the introduction of –CF3 leads to lower HOMO/LUMO levels in F1 compared to in F0, consistent with the CV measurements discussed above.

Conclusion
In summary, we introduced –CF3 by a facile and simple fluorination approach to alter the intermolecular packing and optoelectronic properties of a polymer donor. This strategy does not require complicated multi-step synthetic procedures, but it produces a polymer donor that has a lower HOMO energy level, increased absorption, and stronger intermolecular interactions. Concurrent with the changes in these properties is a substantial improvement in device performance when this polymer donor is incorporated into solar cells compared to its methylated counterpart. These findings may contribute to developing new high-performance polymer donor materials through introducing the trifluoromethyl group into other acceptor units.
