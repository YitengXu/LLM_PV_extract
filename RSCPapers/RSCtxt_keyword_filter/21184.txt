    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 15th August 2018AbstractIncorporation of a ternary organic component is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a small molecule luminescent dye, C545T, was first doped into blends of PTB7-Th/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs. It is demonstrated that C545T can disrupt the severe vertical distribution in the binary blend and effectively modulate the novel surface chemical configuration by improving the self-assembly process of the polymer donor, as a result of the good miscibility among the active layer materials and the π–π interactions between PC71BM and C545T. The obtained homogeneously bicontinuous BHJ with numerous interpenetrating nanofibers optimizes the domain size of exciton diffusion and the length of charge transfer. The energy transfer between C545T and polymers changes the transmission path of photo-generated excitons, which together improve the exciton dissociation process and reduce the recombination loss. Champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.69% and 9.42% were achieved by the ternary blends of PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM and PTB7/C545T/PC71BM, respectively, which correspond to a nearly 20% enhancement over their binary counterparts.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are envisioned to be promising candidates for emerging green energy technology owing to their low cost, flexibility, light weight and easy fabrication by the spin-coating process or spraying manufacture.1–4 Despite such merits, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability remain critical obstacles to their further commercialization. Over the years, extensive research has addressed these problems, for example through the synthesis of new non-fullerene acceptors,5 control of the film morphology,6,7 interface engineering,3,8,9 and development of novel device architectures. The most remarkable PCE has exceeded 13% for single-junction binary OSCs in the laboratory.10,11 Undoubtedly, if we continue to improve the efficiency, more attention should be focused on tackling the defects of binary OSCs, such as the low short-circuit current caused by the narrow energy level of organic materials, the unsatisfactory fill factor caused by inevitable morphological defects and recombination traps created during the process of intermixing, and the intermolecular interactions between organic molecules.12–14 The concept of ternary OSCs with two donors and one fullerene acceptor and/or one donor and two fullerene acceptors has emerged as an attractive strategy to overcome the bottlenecks of binary devices while maintaining the simple assembly processing used for single heterogeneous layers, instead of the more complex tandem cells. Several essential factors need to be considered, such as (i) suitable frontier energy levels to facilitate effective photo-charge transport, (ii) a complementary absorption spectrum to achieve optimal light harvesting, and (iii) good miscibility with active layer materials to form nanoscale bicontinuous phase-separated morphologies for efficient charge transport and collection.15 Fortunately, the diverse family of organic photoelectric materials provides a wide range of third components to obtain improved state-of-the-art ternary OSCs.
At present, the charge mobility and active layer morphology are two major factors that can be improved by using the ternary strategy.11,16–20 For instance, Yan et al. reported that a high mobility polymer DPP-DTT can be added into the PTB7/PC71BM system to increase hole mobilities and carrier lifetimes, resulting in the average PCE increasing from 8.75% to 10.08%.16 Recently, Yang et al. demonstrated that carrier photo-generation and the exciton pathway of the PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend could be further improved by introducing the small molecule DR3TSBDT to form a mixed face-on and edge-on alloy film morphology, resulting in a simultaneous increase in the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).21 However, there are few practical ternary strategies that can simultaneously improve the charge mobility and film morphology. Considering that the hole mobility of OSCs is usually much higher than the electron mobility, we should also focus on elevating the electron mobility. The crystallinity of organic molecules is known to have a large effect on the bicontinuous film morphology of nanofibers.22,23 Most small molecules have good crystallinity but easily lead to large crystalline domains, which inhibit charge separation and pumping.24 Polymers usually have better miscibility with fullerene derivatives; however, the crystallization of conjugated polymers is usually poor and insufficient to achieve an optimal film morphology.17 From the above, a ternary strategy that adds a small molecule into the polymer–fullerene system has great potential to obtain an ideal film morphology and improve the performance of the binary device. Cao et al. successfully achieved a high PCE of 11.4% by incorporating a high crystallinity small molecule (BTR) into the PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary system resulting from the higher balanced charge mobility and optimized BHJ morphology.9 However, the mechanism of small molecules in a ternary system is still not thoroughly understood; searching and synthesizing new small molecules suitable for the fabrication of high-performance OSCs is still a formidable challenge.
In this article, a small molecule luminescent dye C545T was successfully added into a polymer/fullerene binary system as a second donor to fabricate ternary OSCs. Poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thio-phenediyl] (PTB7) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) were selected as the polymers based on their excellent photoelectric performance,25 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was selected as the acceptor. C545T was selected for its matching lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level,26 appropriate absorption position and good miscibility with the polymer donor and PC71BM. We demonstrate that C545T can disrupt the severe vertical distribution of the binary devices and arrange a novel chemical configuration on the blend surface. Detailed studies show that the achieved homogeneously bicontinuous BHJ with numerous nanofibers optimizes the interfacial area, which improves the exciton dissociation process and reduces the recombination loss. Moreover, the energy transfer that occurred between donors changes the transmission path of excitons and thus enhances photon absorption and exciton utilization, ultimately resulting in champion PCEs of 10.69% and 9.42% for PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM and PTB7/C545T/PC71BM ternary devices under optimized conditions, which correspond to a nearly 20% enhancement compared with their binary counterparts. This study suggests that C545T can effectively optimize both the morphology and electrical characteristics of OSCs. The structures of most small molecules chosen as the second donor are relatively complex and similar to those of the polymer donors to avoid mixing incompatibilities. To the best of our knowledge, C545T is one of the simplest third components used to fabricate ternary OSCs with the maximum efficiency over 10.5%.9,17,21,27–29
2. Experimental section
2.1 Device fabrication
PTB7-Th and PTB7 were purchased from 1-Material Inc and PC71BM from American Dye Source. C545T and MoO3 were purchased from Xi'an p-OLED Technology Corp. All materials were taken from the same batch and used as received to ensure credible comparisons between the experimental and control devices. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 220 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich, U.S.A) and 62 mg of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A) in 2 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A). The active layer materials (D/A ratio 1:1.5) were dissolved in chlorobenzene with 3% (volume fraction) of 1,8-diodooctane(DIO). The overall donor concentration was 10 mg ml−1 and the solutions were stirred at 50 °C for 24 h under a N2 atmosphere. The pre-coated ITO substrate (10 Ω sq−1) was washed sequentially using detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethanol for 30 min in each step, followed by drying in a drying oven. The dried ITO is subjected to ultraviolet treatment for 20 min and then a ZnO buffer layer was deposited through the solution process at 5000 rpm for 30 s and dried and annealed at 200 °C under an ambient atmosphere for 1 hour immediately. The active layers were spin coated in a glovebox at a uniform speed to yield an average thickness of 120 nm, and then, a hole-transporting layer MoO3 was evaporated. Finally, a thin film (10 nm) of MoO3 and Ag (150 nm) were sequentially thermally deposited on the active layer using a LN-1102SA (Shenyang Vacuum Inst.) under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa to form an active area of 0.02 cm−2.
2.2 Solar cell characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were examined by using a Keithley 2400 under an AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) Oriel Sol3A solar simulator that has been calibrated with an NREL-certified Si-based solar cell. For dark C–V measurements, the dc offset voltage sweep was superimposed by a small-amplitude (100 mV) low-frequency (2 kHz) ac voltage to prevent any influence of the ac signal on the measured capacitance. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency System (PV Measurements, Inc.). IQE data were calculated based on EQE measurements and reflected absorptions. All other measurement specimens in this study were fabricated on quartz glass and characterized in air unless otherwise stated. UV-visible absorption measurements were performed with a U-3900 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer. The thicknesses of active layers were measured by using a step profilometer (AMBIOS-XP2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific EscaLab 250 Xi.
All specimens used for testing the active layer morphology were fabricated using the same process as that for the OSCs. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were characterized by using a MFP-3D-BIO AFM system (Tapping Mode, Asylum Research Instruments Inc) under ambient conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed by using a high-resolution TEM scanning-probe microscopy (SPM) system (Hitachi TEM system at the Institute of Physics (CAS)) at 100 kV. The active layer was deposited on a PEDOT:PSS (60 nm) coated substrate and then immersed in ultrapure water. The hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS will be dissolved in water, causing the active layer to float on the water. The floating active layer was then placed on a holey copper grid and dried in the transitional compartment of a glove box for 30 min.
The charge carrier mobility of the binary and ternary devices was calculated by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Electron-only and hole-only devices were fabricated in the following structures, respectively: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al. The thickness of both the hole- and electron-only active layers was carefully controlled at 100 nm. The recorded current–voltage curves fit well with the Mott–Gurney square law.30 (1)and (2)where εr is the relative permittivity (≈ 3.00 in this study), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (≈8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), V is the applied voltage on the device, L is the thickness of the film (∼100 nm), β is a field-dependent factor that is proportional to the Poole–Frenkel coefficient,31μ0 is the zero electric field mobility and μ is the device field-dependency mobility determined by SCLC curves. The applied voltage was modified with a built-in voltage Vbi (0.0 V for the electron-only devices and 0.45 V for the hole-only devices), which was caused by asymmetric contact between the electrodes.32 The values of μ0 and β can be obtained by linear fitting, and then eqn (2) can be used to finally calculate the electron and hole mobilities of the devices.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photoelectric characteristics
The molecular structures of the PTB7-Th, PTB7, C545T and PC71BM are presented in Fig. 1. We first recorded UV–vis absorption spectra of the individual active layer materials. As shown in Fig. 2a, C545T exhibits a strong absorption intensity in the range of 350 to 530 nm, which perfectly complements the absorption of PTB7-Th and PTB7. Considering that the solar radiation spectrum also has the strongest radiation intensity in the UV region, C545T further enhances the film absorption from 350 to 530 nm on the basis of PC71BM, which may imply that more light energy can be utilized for generating photo-generated excitons.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and LUMO energy level of C545T are −5.54 eV and −2.80 eV, respectively.26 The energy levels of the other active layer materials are illustrated in Fig. 3c. Moreover, the cascaded LUMO energy levels of the active layer materials ensure that the resulting electrons will be smoothly transported from C545T to the acceptor PC71BM. To better study the changes in absorption following incorporation of the third component, we also recorded the UV–vis absorption spectra of ternary blend films with different amounts of C545T while keeping a constant blending weight ratio (wtdonors:wtacceptor = 1:1.5).

Fig. 2b shows that increasing the C545T ratio in the PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend gradually enhances the absorption intensity from 380 nm to 530 nm while simultaneously decreasing the absorption intensity from 530 nm to 750 nm, which is consistent with the observation of the C545T absorption peak at approximately 470 nm and the PTB7-Th absorption peak at approximately 690 nm (Fig. 2a). The attenuation of absorption intensity within the range of 530 to 750 nm can be attributed to the reduction of polymer concentration in the ternary blend. Moreover, the ratio between the part of the spectra that is increased and the part that is decreased is greater than 1 for the devices with 5–15 wt% of C545T, which indicates that C545T will benefit device absorption. Unexpectedly, the absorption of the films with 5–15 wt% C545T shows a similar intensity in the PTB7-Th region and does not diminish with a gradient decrease of PTB7-Th content, resulting in a similar spectral integral area. This phenomenon implies that the doping of C545T can improve the crystallinity of the polymer donor and enhance the photon utilization of the OSCs. However, excessive addition of the small molecule to 20 wt% may introduce large phase-separated domains by affecting the crystallization and arrangement of the polymer donor in the ternary blend, eventually leading to attenuated absorption.12,33 (The absorption spectra of the ternary blends based on PTB7/C545T/PC71BM are given in Fig. S1c in the ESI.†)
Then, we tested the compatibility among the active layer materials by calculating their surface energy levels, because good miscibility is an important prerequisite for the fabrication of ternary OSCs. The surface energies of PTB7-Th, PTB7, PC71BM and C545T were determined by measuring the contact angle of liquid droplets using Berthelot–Young's equation.34 The details of the liquid contact angle are summarized in ESI Table S1,† and the water contact angle images are shown in Fig. 2c. All active layer materials show rather low surface energy (C545T = 34.96 mN m−1; PTB7 = 17.5 mN m−1; PC71BM = 32.78 mN m−1; PTB7-Th = 15.57 mN m−1) as shown in Fig. 2d, originating from their hydrophobic/nonpolar backbones, alkyl side chains and benzene moieties. The similar surface energies suggest good miscibility between the active layer materials as well as strong intermolecular interactions among C545T, PTB7-Th and PC71BM.3,35 Reports have shown that the solubility of fullerene derivatives in ethane (0.087 mg mL−1) and alkyl solvents, such as tetradecafluorohexane (0.04 mg mL−1), is much less than that in benzene (16 mg mL−1), indicating a strong interaction between the PC71BM core and the C545T benzene moiety, rather than the alkyl side.19,36 This conclusion indicates that the strong intermolecular interactions between C545T and PC71BM can be mainly ascribed to the π–π interactions between the PC71 BM core and the C545T benzene moiety. The self-organization of the active layer is known to be influenced by the blend composition and surface energy.3,7,22,37 So the addition of C545T may promote the formation of a novel molecular arrangement inside the active layer by affecting the self-assembly of the blend film.
3.2 Photovoltaic performance
As shown in Fig. 3a, the inverted device configuration was adopted in this study to obtain the best OSC optoelectronic performance. The composition ratio of the active layers was kept at wtdonors:wtacceptor = 1:1.5, and 1,8-diodooctane was used as an additive to attain the ideal film morphology. The doping amount of C545T in the donor component relative to the polymer donor was selectively controlled to be 0% (device A), 5% (device B), 10% (device C), 15% (device D) and 20% (device E). For better comparison, PTB7/C545T/PC71BM ternary devices were also fabricated, and the doping amount was also controlled to be 0% (device I), 5% (device II), 10% (device III), 15% (device IV) and 20% (device V). The binary device based on C5/PC71BM named device O is shown in Table 1. The average efficiency data were calculated from at least ten devices.

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics based on PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM under different conditions are shown in Fig. 4a (J–V curves based on PTB7/C545T/PC71BM are summarized in Fig. S1a†) and the parameter values are summarized in Table 1. Jsc is significantly enhanced after the incorporation of a small amount of C545T (5–15 wt%) into the host blend and decreases with a further increase in the doping amount to 20 wt%. In particular, the Jsc values of device C and device III were increased over 10% of that the binary device A (17.72 mA cm−2) and device I (16.09 mA cm−2) to 20.01 mA cm−2 and 17.70 mA cm−2, respectively. The binary device shows a higher VOC of 0.80 V; as for the ternary device, the VOC value shows little increase compared with the control device, which is attributed to the parallel structure of ternary OSCs whose VOC values would lie in the range between the values of the two sub-batteries.38 The HOMO energy levels of PTB7, PTB7-Th and C545T are −5.15 eV, −5.24 eV and −5.54 eV, respectively(Fig. 3c). Device C and device III achieved optimum efficiencies of 10.69% (VOC = 0.786 V, JSC = 20.01 mA cm−−2, FF = 68.07%) and 9.42% (VOC = 0.733 V, JSC = 17.70 mA cm−−2, FF = 72.64%) due to the simultaneous increase in FF and Jsc. The prominently enhanced efficiency of the ternary devices ultimately benefits from the improvement of the absorption spectrum, the cascade LUMO energy levels and the similar surface energies of the active layer materials. However, a further increase in the C545T content results in a decreased device performance and deteriorated Jsc and FF. The mechanism for the increase in FF and Jsc will be further unraveled in the following measurements.
 Fig. 4  (a) Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics; (b) dark J–V curves; (c) EQE spectra and (d) IQE spectra of PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM ternary devices with different amounts of C545T. 
To better understand the diode mechanism of the devices upon C545T incorporation, we examined the single logarithmic dark current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding films using the Shockley diode equation:15,39  where q is the electron charge, T is the temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant, RS is the series resistance and RSH is the shunt resistance. As shown in Fig. 4b, all the devices with C545T show a relatively lower leakage current, which indicates that the ternary devices with C545T have a larger RSH resistance because the leakage current is limited by the shunt resistance as shown in Table 1. Considering that the larger RSH usually means less carrier recombination loss, the doping of C545T can effectively inhibit the recombination process and facilitate carrier transport in the blend, which results in an increased Jsc and FF.15 Furthermore, the smaller RS value also leads to a reduced RS implies that the ternary OSCs have a lower semiconductor bulk resistance and a better metal/semiconductor contact interface;39 as a result, the device shows an enhanced JSC.
The EQEs of ternary devices A–E are presented in Fig. 4c. The calculated integral values of the EQE curves matched the measured Jsc with a deviation of less than 6%. The EQE values for devices B–E were enhanced over the whole spectral region especially in the range of 350–550 nm, which is consistent with the enhanced absorption spectrum and Jsc of the ternary devices. Meanwhile, the EQE peak in the UV region (∼460 nm) of the binary reference is slightly blue-shifted after doping small molecules due to the strong absorption of C545T in the region. It is known that the EQE of the OSCs is determined by the device quantum effects (IQE) and absorption. So the IQEs of the ternary devices were also measured to explore the original possibility of the EQE enhancement. As presented in Fig. 4d, the obvious enhancement of IQE values in the C545T absorption range suggests that the EQE enhancement at 380–550 nm is a result of the combination of C545T absorption and efficient exciton dissociation.40 Moreover, the IQE curves of the ternary devices with 10 wt% and 20 wt% amount of C545T show a similar peak intensity from 550 nm to 750 nm and both exceed 90% compared to nearly 80% of the binary device, which implies that almost all of the photons absorbed by the polymer were converted into free charge and successfully captured by the electrodes. The absorption and IQE tests reveal that the unexpected EQE enhancement in the PTB7-Th absorption regions mainly originates from induced C545T, which greatly promotes the exciton dissociation and charge extraction of the polymer donor in an uncertain way. (The dark current J–V and EQE curves for devices I–V are summarized in Fig. S1b and S1d.†)
In order to better investigate the working mechanism in this ternary OSC system, the individual PL spectra of the PTB7-Th and C545T films were recorded to study whether the energy transfer could occur or not. As shown in Fig. 5, because the emission spectrum of C545T overlapped with the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th, the PL spectra of the PTB7-Th/C545T blend films with different doping ratios of C545T were also investigated. Fig. 5 shows that by increasing the doping amount of C545T in the blend, the emission peak of PTB7-Th increased continuously, while emission of C545T diminished completely, which proved that energy transfer from photo-excited C545T to PTB7-Th occurred.41,42 The occurrence of energy transfer indicates that the increased photo-generated excitons from C545T can enhance Jsc in two possible pathways. Energy transfer from photo-excited C545T to PTB7-Th occurs, followed by efficient charge dissociation and extraction at the PTB7-Th/PC71BM interface as confirmed by the EQE and IQE enhancement from 550 to 750 nm where PTB7-Th showed strong absorption. Alternatively, excitons generated by C545T could also directly separate at the C545T/PC71BM interfaces due to the cascade LUMO energy levels and eventually collected by the electrodes, which can explain the significantly increased EQE from 380 to 550 nm. Considering that the energy transfer in the ternary system can also be beneficial to separate the excitons between the host donor/receptor interfaces and relax the strict energy level gradient requirement,41 the addition of C545T may benefit the active layer to promote the separation of excitons and reduce the recombination loss.

3.3 Active film distribution and morphology
TEM analysis was performed to study the influence on the active layer morphology and phase separation upon adding C545T to a binary reference. The TEM images for binary or ternary films with different doping amounts are shown in Fig. 6. The bright and dark regions appearing in the image correspond to the polymer donors and PC71BM-rich domains (widths of 5–15 nm), respectively.

We note that a slight polymer fiber structure appears in the binary blend, which is also accompanied by serious PTB7-Th cloud aggregation on the film surface (Fig. 6a). The ternary films with C545T, by contrast, exhibit an obvious fibrous morphology with a homogeneously bicontinuous pattern, especially devices B–D. The calculated surface energies indicate the good miscibility among the active layer materials, which is crucial for the formation of a BHJ in the nanomorphology.7,22 Because TEM is also a powerful technique to identify polymer and fullerene aggregation in the film,43 these images indicate that C545T can not only promote the formation of bicontinuous interpenetrating BHJ structures with well-sized nanoscopic fibers but also inhibit the aggregation of polymer (PTB7/PTB7-Th) or PC71BM on the film surface. For most organic materials used in OSCs, the exciton diffusion length is approximately 5–10 nm, and the geminate charge-capture radius is >15 nm,22,44 so the ordered nanostructure with optimized domain widths (5–15 nm) will guarantee effective exciton capture and separation, and the bicontinuous network with optimized domain lengths will ensure that the obtained carriers can be effectively delivered to the electrodes; as a result, the JSC and FF have been enhanced along with a reduced RS and increased RSH. However, larger domains (widths ∼50 nm) were observed when doping 20 wt% C545T into the film (Fig. 6f).
The water contact angles (WCAs) of the binary and ternary films were also measured to further investigate the concentration changes of each component on the film shallow surface, due to the apparent different surface energies between the active layer materials.44 Generally, the closer the WCA is to a pure component, the more the component is distributed on the surface of the blend film. As shown in Fig. S2,† the WCA of the binary film is closer to that of pure PTB7-Th and much larger than that of pure PC71BM (Fig. 2c), proving that more PTB7-Th and less PC71BM are distributed on the surface of the blend, which is consistent with the TEM observations. This phenomenon can also be proved by the fact that inverted devices usually show a vertical distribution gradient of the polymer donor at the film top and aggregation of the fullerene derivative underneath, as shown in Fig. 3b Case 1.23 However, the WCAs of the ternary blends with C545T underwent significant changes compared with the binary reference although with a small amount of small molecule (Fig. S2†), indicating that C545T can influence the film surface distribution and the vertical concentration gradients of the polymer donor. Park et al. reported that the vertical component distribution in the film can be dynamically adjusted by adding different amounts of the small molecule F-ADD into the blend and successfully obtained a homogeneous BHJ distribution along the vertical direction,19 which exhibited better photovoltaic performance than the devices with vertical gradients.
The WCAs of the two-donor blends were also measured to prove that C545T can effectively promote the formation of a homogeneous BHJ distribution in the film shallow surface. Considering that both polymer donors PTB7-Th and PTB7 contain BDT units, we also add C545T into the binary systems without BDT, such as PDPPTPT/PC71BM. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the devices was significantly reduced after the addition of C545T, implying that there is indeed a specific interaction between C545T and BDT units that can greatly affect the adjustment of C545T on the BHJ morphology. This special interaction will enable C545T to be evenly interspersed between the polymer PTB7-Th instead of forming a serious vertical distribution, as PC71BM does. As shown in Fig. S3,† the addition of C545T can effectively reduce the WCA of the donor blend, even at small amounts. The homogeneous distribution of C545T will also drive the symmetrical allocation of PC71BM in the active layer owing to the strong π–π stacking interaction between C545T and PC71BM,19 which modulates the formation of a homogeneous BHJ distribution on the shallow surface, as shown in Fig. 3b Case 2, and the enhanced IQE of the ternary devices should be directly attributed to the novel active layer morphology. The molecule distribution of the ternary film was further investigated via XPS experiment. Fig. 7(a) and (b) respectively show the XPS curve of the control film and 10% C545T containing film. For the control film, the O atom presented a proportion of 4.90% without any N atom peak, while the ternary film shows a discernible N atom content of 1.44% and a reduced O atom of 4.20%. Because the N atom only pertains to C545T, we conclude that the introduction of C545T can disturb the molecule distribution of the ternary film, which is consistent with the surface energy analysis. The reduced O atom contents implying the dispersed small molecule can suppress fullerene aggregation. Besides, the F atom content increased from 1.17% to 1.42%, indicating that the inserted C545T facilitates the crystallization of the polymer, which is beneficial to charge transfer.

To further confirm the changes in the distribution and molecular orientation of the BHJ, we utilized GIXRD to characterize the packing condition in the binary and ternary blends. All blends showed the same peak at 19–21°, which revealed a short π–π distance for PTB7-Th and PTB7.45–47 The PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary film revealed a π–π stacking (010) peak about 20.18° corresponding to a d-spacing of 4.40 Å as shown in Fig. 7(c). When 10% C545T was added in the binary system, the crystallization peak moved to 19.70° coupled with a larger d-spacing of 4.51 Å. The broadened d-space indicating the gathering of PTB7-Th on the film surface has been optimized. These results correlate well with the formation of homogeneous nanofibrous BHJ morphology. Furthermore, the distribution intensity has been increased from 88.56 to 104.36, suggesting that the crystallinity of the polymer has been enhanced after 10% C545T was added in the control film. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the PTB7:PC71BM system as shown in Fig. 7(d). The optimized molecular stacking distribution in the ternary film disrupts the original intermolecular arrangement of the binary film and improves the self-assembly process of the polymer, which work together to facilitate the formation of the nanofiber structure and bicontinuous interpenetrating BHJ morphology. Corresponding to the film morphology analysis, the nanofibers on the film surface also provide numerous pathways between the active layer and buffer layer for more efficient charge transport and pumping. All these studies together lead to the simultaneously enhanced FF and Jsc.
The 2D and 3D AFM height images of the active layer films are shown in Fig. 8. The binary film without C545T clearly exhibits a more coarse and spiky appearance, with a root-mean-square (Rms) roughness of 1.659 nm (Fig. 8a), and the roughness is significantly reduced when the active layer is doped with C545T (Fig. 8). The reduced Rms illustrates that a much smoother and planar surface morphology could be obtained for C545T doped ternary OSCs, which coincides with the lowered RS values of the ternary devices identified in the dark J–V measurements. The change in the film surface roughness is also strong proof that C545T can effectively adjust the arrangement and distribution inside the blend by improving the self-assembly of the polymer donor.7,22,37 In detail, the addition of C545T improved the severe vertical distribution of the binary blend, resulting in a more homogeneous active layer morphology, which inhibited surface aggregation thus leading to a smoother surface. Fig. S4† shows the enlarged parts of AFM images for the control and 10% C545T doped ternary films. It is obvious that the addition of C545T suppressed the adverse aggregations. When further increasing the doping amount to 20 wt%, although the BHJ film shows a larger rough area (RMS = 1.637 nm), as depicted in Fig. 8e, it is still more smooth than the binary reference (RMS = 1.659 nm). This implies that the phase separation domains caused by excessive doping are very small, as shown in Fig. 5f and are not large enough to seriously affect the surface smoothness of the blend film. (The TEM and AFM images of the ternary blends based on PTB7/C545T/PC71BM are summarized in Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI.†)

3.4 Charge dynamics and exciton recombination
The addition of C545T affects the vertical concentration distribution of the polymer donor at the top and aggregation of the fullerene acceptor underneath, which has been reported to facilitate carrier transport and reduce recombination.23 Therefore, it is important to ascertain the influence of C545T on the charge dynamics and exciton recombination of the host system. We first independently calculated the hole and electron mobilities of the binary and ternary devices by using the SCLC method.30–32
As shown in Fig. 9a and b, the recorded curves can be fitted well with the SCLCs given by the Murgatroyd equation, and all related parameter values are summarized in Table 2. The electron mobilities clearly changed with different amounts of C545T under a typical electric field of 1 × 105 V cm−1. With an increase in the C545T contents, the electron mobility increased continually until the concentration reached 15%. With further adding the content of C545T, the electron mobility decreased slightly which is attributed to oversize phase separation. However, the decrease in the hole mobility should be attributed to the fact that the decrease of polymer concentration in the ternary blends will reduce the hole pumping capacity of PTB7-Th from PC71BM. Notably, a more balanced electron and hole mobility was obtained when the doping amount was approximately 10 wt% as shown in Fig. 9c, which is in good agreement with the highest Jsc and PCE value being obtained at this content. However, introducing more C545T to 20 wt% led to a simultaneous reduction in the electron and hole mobility, in accordance with the poorer performance, which may be due to slight phase separation, as observed in the TEM images.

More insight into the influence of C545T on light absorption and charge generation was also achieved by determining the saturation current density (Jsat) of the binary and ternary devices. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves for the devices used in this study are presented in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  (a) Measured Jsc values as a function of light intensity. (b) Measured Voc values as a function of light intensity. (c) Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics. 
The measured photocurrent is defined as Jph = JL – JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under one sun illumination and darkness, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Vb − Va, where Vb is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.12 In general, all photo-generated excitons are assumed to be dissociated and collected at the electrodes at high Veff (0.5 V in this study), so that Jsat can be determined by the total amount of absorbed incident photons. The J–V curves indicate that the Jph values of device C and device III with 10 wt% C545T quickly saturate for Veff > 0.5 V, showing a Jsat value of 209 A m−2 and 179 A m−2, respectively, which is in contrast to the slightly field-dependent character of the binary devices with a low saturation current of 180 A m−2 and 168 A m−2, respectively. The increased Jsat with C545T addition suggests increased overall exciton generation in the ternary devices,48 which due to C545T improves the absorption utilization of the polymer by adjusting the distribution of the active layer.
The well-known dependence of the J–V characteristics on the light intensity reveals useful information about the recombination loss.2,49–51 Therefore, we also measured the JSC and VOC values at various light intensities (from 0.9 to 100 mW cm−2) to investigate the monomolecular and/or bimolecular recombination processes that may occur inside the active layers. Monomolecular recombination usually refers to geminate recombination between the electron–hole pair before dissociation and/or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination with the shallow traps created by interfacial defects, while bimolecular recombination generally refers to the recombination of free charges in the active layer.2 Bimolecular recombination can be considered negligible if the generated excitons are swept out prior to recombination under short-circuit conditions. This will result in a value of the exponential factor α close to unity, where α is the fitted slope of the double-logarithmic linear dependence of JSC on the light intensity.49 As shown in Fig. 10a, the α values for the ternary devices (10 wt%) based on PTB7-TH/C545T/PC71BM and PTB7/C545T/PC71BM are 0.967 and 0.932, which are larger than those of the binary reference devices (α = 0.944 and 0.926, respectively). This result indicates that the ternary devices have relatively weaker bimolecular recombination loss at the BHJ donor/acceptor interface, which agrees well with the improved FF and JSC values for the devices with C545T.
The recombination process was also studied by analyzing the VOC as a function of light intensity, independent of photo-generated charge carriers and Jsc, as shown in Fig. 10b. According to the previously published work, the slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity is equal to kT/q when bimolecular recombination is dominant. Moreover, the slope may be greater than kT/q in the case of monomolecular recombination, especially trap-assisted SRH recombination.33,50,51 Notably, the PTB7-TH/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM binary devices exhibited a strong VOC dependence on light intensity, with slopes of 1.94 and 2.2kT/q at high light intensities (>10 mW cm−2), while the ternary devices with C545T (10 wt%) showed smaller slopes of 1.49 and 1.9kT/q, respectively, in the overall range of light intensity. This result implies that the binary references show stronger SRH monomolecular recombination processes, especially at low light intensities (<10 mW cm−2), while the devices with C545T did not suffer such losses due to the optimized domain length and width of exciton diffusion. In short, we can affirm that C545T effectively passivates the impurity surface trap states to suppress not only bimolecular recombination but also interfacial trap-captured recombination (SRH), leading to excellent device performance and enhanced device shunt resistance, which is consistent with the results of the analysis of the dark J–V characteristics and IQE enhancement.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we successfully developed a novel ternary OSC system with improved efficiency by incorporating a luminescent dye C545T into PTB7-Th/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM host blends. C545T can be homogeneously interspersed around the polymer donor and modulate the chemical phase distribution in the shallow surface of the blend due to the good miscibility among the active layer materials and the π–π stacking interactions between the benzene moiety of C545T and PC71BM. The optimized BHJ morphology greatly increases the interfacial area and energy transfer occurring between donors changes the transmission path of excitons, resulting in enhanced photon absorption, balanced carrier mobility and depressed exciton recombination. The ternary devices with 10 wt% amount of small molecules exhibited better photovoltaic performances with champion PCEs of 10.69% and 9.42% for PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM and PTB7/C545T/PC71BM, respectively, which correspond to nearly a 20% enhancement over their binary counterparts. Ongoing research will continue to explore new luminescent dyes that can be used as ternary components in an effort to apply this novel concept to the development of highly efficient OSCs.
