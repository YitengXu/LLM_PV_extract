    , Accepted 27th July 2016First published on 27th July 2016AbstractThe peculiar photobehaviour of a symmetrical arylenevinylene anthracene derivative bearing mild electron donors (alkoxy groups) at the sides of its structure has been fully comprehended through this study. An investigation into the effect of solvent polarity and temperature on the stationary fluorescence spectrum allowed a clear dual emission to be revealed. A further valuable insight was obtained, thanks to the employment of ultrafast spectroscopies. Fluorescence up-conversion measurements and the Time Resolved Area Normalised Spectra analysis provided a clear-cut proof of the presence of two distinct fluorescent states (1A* and 1B*), with 1A* being responsible for the steady-state emission in highly polar and viscous media. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra were acquired in several organic solvents of different polarity and viscosity. Interestingly, the lifetime of 1A* was found to be dependent on solvent viscosity whereas the lifetime of 1B* showed a trend which matches the change in solvent polarity. Indeed, the Density functional theory calculations predicted a structural rearrangement in the fully relaxed lowest excited singlet state. The 1A* → 1B* transition is thus likely accompanied by large amplitude motions of the molecular structure, with the 1B* state also exhibiting a small intramolecular charge transfer character. The investigated flexible quadrupolar D–π–D system arouses therefore great interest as a novel material for applications in organic electronics and photonics.
Introduction
During the last few years chemists have been paying increasing attention to organic materials characterised by an extended π-conjugation for their promising applications in molecular electronic devices, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), field effect transistors and organic photovoltaic cells.1–6 In this regard, soluble small molecules have great potential and surely offer advantages over polymers in terms of easy synthesis and purification and generally high charge carrier mobility.7–9 Moreover, the presence of electron-acceptor and electron-donor units in organic conjugated molecules may induce intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes following photoexcitation, making these systems of potential interest new, highly performing and low cost non-linear optical (NLO) materials.10,11
Recently, anthracene has been proved to be an exceptional building block to obtain molecular structures, which are very appealing for organic electronics12–14 as well as for the development of fluorescent sensors.15–17 Anthracene derivatives containing electron donor and acceptor substituents have shown in many cases remarkable two-photon absorption properties18,19 which were enhanced upon increasing the donor/acceptor strength,20 the π-conjugation21 in anthracene centred cruciform molecular structures.22,23 Such compounds have been successfully employed in two-photon excited bioimaging and photodynamic therapy.24 Push–pull anthracene based fluorophores have exhibited environment sensitive emission,25,26 the position of the fluorescence spectrum being significantly red-shifted and the fluorescence quantum yield largely reduced upon increasing the solvent polarity as a consequence of ICT. The investigation into the solvent and temperature effect on the spectral and photophysical properties of various flexible anthryl donor/acceptor compounds27,28 has been proved to be valuable to reveal the presence of twisted ICT states or highly polar intramolecular exciplexes.
In the past few years, we reported on the synthesis, spectra and photophysics of conjugated anthracene-based compounds, studied both in solution29,30 and in thin films31,32 by means of steady-state and nanosecond resolved spectroscopic techniques. These anthracene derivatives are promising solar absorbers in organic photovoltaic cells. A new approach to enhance the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices has been the preparation of ternary blends of fullerene as acceptors and two of these small conjugated molecules as donors, which by having complementary absorption spectra allow a wider range of the solar radiation spectrum to be covered.32,33 The excited state deactivation of these mixtures in thin films has been found to involve an efficient quantitative energy transfer among the singlet excited states of the donors. This mechanism can be of great interest in enhancing sunlight harvesting.34
Among these compounds, the most peculiar behaviour has been found for 9,10-bis-{(E)-[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]vinyl}-anthracene, i.e. an arylenevinylene derivative featuring an anthracene core (Anth in Chart 1).32 This system exhibits a broad and weak fluorescence band in chloroform but a sharp and intense emission in thin films. The emission enhancement in thin films, counterintuitive with respect to the more common quenching effect observed when passing from fluid solution to the solid state, makes this compound enormously appealing for applications in optoelectronics.35,36 However, the reasons underlying this particular phenomenon have not been completely understood up to now. Few hypotheses have been proposed in a previous work of ours32 to make an attempt to rationalise the abnormally broad emission band recorded for this compound in solution, but there are some open questions which still need to be faced and answered. The possible presence of different conformers in dynamical equilibrium in fluid solution (in the solid state the aggregation could force the molecules in a more planar conformation) was evaluated, but the possibility of a photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer or the emission coming from an upper excited state was also taken into account.

In the present work, a detailed investigation was carried out on the effect of solvent polarity and solvent viscosity, as well as the effect of temperature on the spectral and photophysical properties of Anth. This molecular system is characterised by a π-electron rich central anthracene chromophore together with lateral phenyl groups bearing weak electron donor alkoxy substituents (a quadrupolar like D–π–D structure).37,38 A deep insight into its excited state deactivation mechanism was achieved by employing not only stationary and nanosecond resolved spectroscopies but also state-of-the-art femtosecond resolved techniques, both in absorption (pump–probe) and in emission (fluorescence up-conversion), coupled with density functional theory calculations.
Results and discussion
Absorption and fluorescence: solvent effect
Absorption spectra of Anth were recorded in several solvents of different polarity and viscosity; the results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and summarised in Table 1. Just a small red shift and no spectral enlargement of the absorption band were observed upon increasing the solvent dielectric constant (ca. 10–15 nm maximum displacement when going from the non-polar isopentane to the highly polar dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, with FWHM being 4260 and 4110 cm−1 in isopentane and dimethyl formamide, respectively). These findings suggest that the absorption transition has a negligible charge transfer character for this compound, which bears only weak electron donor substituents.

Differently, an important effect of solvent polarity was revealed on the emission spectral shape and maximum position. In order to clearly describe this complex fluorescence behaviour, it might be helpful to discuss separately what was observed in non-polar, sparingly polar and highly polar solvents (see panels A, B and C of Fig. 1, respectively). In the least polar solvents among those taken into consideration (isopentane, cyclohexane and decahydronaphthalene) the emission spectrum is centred around 615 nm. Upon dissolving Anth in slightly more polar media, such as toluene or diethylether, and in an isopentane/diethyl ether/ethanol (EPA) mixture, the fluorescence band undergoes a bathochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity (λmax = 630, 650 and 665 nm, respectively) and an enlargement toward the longer wavelength region of the visible spectral range. These spectral features could indicate a certain charge transfer character of the state responsible for the emission in these solvents, as observed in previous works concerning organic compounds bearing donor–acceptor chromophores.39,40
 Fig. 1  Normalised emission spectra in solvents of different polarity (solvent abbreviations are listed in the Experimental section). 
In solvents of intermediate polarity (such as anisole, chloroform, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran) the emission band is centred around 650 nm, exhibiting a small solvent dependence, and is exceptionally large showing a shoulder around 540 nm, which was instead absent in diethylether and EPA.
In highly polar media the shoulder around 540 nm is even more apparent and the molecule shows a clear dual emissive behaviour.41,42 Two emissions centred at 560 and 680 nm are readily visible in the fluorescence spectrum recorded in dichloromethane. It is noteworthy that upon increasing the solvent dielectric constant (that is from dichloromethane to dichloroethane, acetone, dimethyl formamide up to dimethyl sulphoxide) the bathochromic emission decreases in relative intensity with respect to the blue shifted fluorescence. The emission band indeed shows an impressive narrowing, with the fluorescence at ca. 540 nm becoming the only one observed in the most polar media. The slight red-shift of the hypsochromic band detected in dimethyl sulphoxide is probably due to its high dielectric constant and polarizability, which might induce a certain stabilisation of the upper emitting state analogously to the much stronger effect observed for the lower energy state emitting above 600 nm.
It has to be pointed out that the lack of wavelength effects on the fluorescence spectra and the good overlapping of the fluorescence excitation and absorption spectra suggest that just one absorbing species is present in solution (or different conformers exhibiting similar absorption features) and that the two observed emissions must be related to excited state processes. These results were obtained in all the investigated solvents and a representative example is shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2).
All the fluorescence spectra showing dual emission were fitted by two Gaussians to discriminate the contributions of the two emitters (1A* and 1B*) to the fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF,A and ϕA→B × ϕF,B, where ϕA→B represents the quantum yield of the 1A* → 1B* process). A suitable fluorescence quantum yield of 1B* (ϕF,B in Table 1) was then calculated assuming that the deactivation of 1A* takes place exclusively by fluorescence to the ground state and conversion into 1B* (ϕA→B = 1 − ϕF,A; see kinetic scheme in Chart 2). ϕF,A is rather low in all the investigated media. The fluorescence quantum yield of 1B* is remarkable in the least polar media (ca. 0.3) and is progressively quenched upon increasing the solvent dielectric constant, being reduced about two orders of magnitude in the more polar solvents (ϕF,B is 0.003 in dimethyl formamide).
 Chart 2  Kinetic scheme for the excited state deactivation of Anth. 
No significant trans → cis photoisomerisation is found to be operative for Anth in all solvents, its disappearance yield being 1 × 10−4 and 2 × 10−4 in cyclohexane and dimethyl formamide, respectively. This evidence, together with the relatively low triplet yield previously measured in cyclohexane (0.01),29 points to a prevalent deactivation of the singlet excited state through internal conversion. The efficiency of internal conversion, the only decay pathway competitive to fluorescence for this molecule, is further enhanced in the more polar solvents.
The positive solvatochromism of the fluorescence of 1B* with increasing solvent polarity is quantified in Fig. 2 according to the following equation:43 (1)with νF being the fluorescence maximum, a the Onsager radius, ε the dielectric constant (with ε0 its value in void space), n the refractive index, Qg the quadrupole moment of the ground state, Qe the quadrupole moment of the excited state. The absolute value of the slope in eqn (1) in the case of Anth is about half with respect to the values obtained using the same equation for symmetric quadrupolar compounds reported in the literature to show a significant ICT character.43

Analogous small positive fluorosolvatochromic effects and quenching of ϕF upon increasing the solvent polarity were previously observed and related to ICT even in the case of a chromophore44 structurally similar to Anth and in the case of its corresponding dipolar monobranched system.45
Temperature effect
In order to get a deeper insight into these striking solvent effects on the fluorescence properties, the effect of temperature on the emission was investigated in EPA and anisole. The EPA mixture was selected as solvent because it allows a large temperature range to be explored and it is able to form a transparent rigid matrix. The emission spectrum in EPA at room temperature shows the prevalent contribution of the bathochromic emission at 665 nm, as previously discussed, but important changes in the spectral shape were revealed upon decreasing the temperature (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). Upon lowering the temperature to 200 K a shoulder around 530 nm becomes progressively more apparent. At 180 K this blue shifted emission is the predominant one and the 650 nm centred fluorescence appears as a clear but less intense shoulder. The two spectra at 200 and 180 K (dark yellow and blue traces in Fig. 3) exhibit a noticeable dual emission. The 650 nm shoulder diminishes in intensity upon further lowering the temperature. At 120 K (pink spectrum in Fig. 3) the 530 nm emission is the only one experimentally observed. In the rigid matrix (orange and olive spectra at 81 and 77 K in Fig. 3) the spectrum undergoes an additional blue shift up to ca. 500 nm. At every temperature investigated no significant wavelength effect on the excitation spectra was revealed (see Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that just one species is responsible for light absorption even when an evident dual emission is detected. From all these spectral features it is possible to infer the presence of two distinct fluorescent states produced upon photo-excitation. The state responsible for the red-shifted emission prevails at room temperature, but it is inhibited at low temperatures.

Moreover, the experimental fluorescence efficiency significantly enhances at low temperatures (see Table 2), reaching a value close to unity at 77 K. A treatment of ϕF,A data (with ϕF,A and ϕF,B in Table 2 being retrieved as already described by spectral deconvolution through a two Gaussian fitting of the emission bands) in the range of temperatures 220–120 K according to the Arrhenius equation is reported in Fig. 4. From the trend of ϕF,Avs. temperature, an activation barrier (likely torsional) of ca. 3 kcal mol−1 was estimated for the population of the red emitting state in the EPA mixture.
 Fig. 4  Plot of the fluorescence quantum yields according to the Arrhenius-type equation. 
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured at the two distinct emission wavelengths of 540 and 660 nm by the nanosecond resolved single photon counting technique in the investigated temperature range. The kinetics were analysed through the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM, see the detailed description in the ESI†), able to provide the lifetime distribution that adequately describes the observed radiative deactivation. Between 298 and 180 K the 540 nm fluorescence decay occurs faster than the experimental temporal resolution. Conversely, the 660 nm decay is longer and well fitted by the MEM analysis considering one lifetime distribution (Fig. S4, ESI†) centred at the values τF,B listed in Table 2. τF,B lengthens significantly upon lowering the temperature. The rather broad lifetime distributions probably reflect the many conformational states that Anth is expected to have in its ground state, as revealed by a previous computational study.29,32
At 160 and 140 K the MEM analysis revealed a peculiar behaviour in the fluorescence kinetics (see Fig. S5, ESI†), the decay being slowed down. For example, at 140 K (Fig. S5, ESI†), a distribution of decay times centred at 0.33 ns was revealed for the 540 nm kinetics, whereas the 660 nm kinetic trace analysis undisclosed the presence of a 0.51 ns centred distribution of rise times together with a 1.6 ns centred distribution of decay times. When considering the MEM analysis results for the decay kinetics recorded at 540 nm (wavelength closer to 460 nm, typical of the LED employed in these measurements), a contribution of the excitation light to the broadening of the distributions toward shorter lifetimes (0.01–0.1 ns) cannot be excluded. This rise and decay dynamics is in agreement with the presence of two fluorescent states, with the one emitting at 540 nm being the precursor of the species emitting at 660 nm. At 120 K and in a rigid matrix, analogous kinetic traces were recorded at 540 and 660 nm, which indeed were fitted considering the same distribution of decay times (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). This finding is in agreement with the presence of only one emitting species at very low temperature; in fact, the fully relaxed excited state cannot be populated under these experimental conditions.
Starting from the values of fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF,A and ϕF,B) and lifetimes (τF,A and τF,B) measured in EPA as a function of temperature, the evaluation of the radiative rate constants (kF = ϕF/τF) was carried out for both emitting states (see Table S1, ESI†). For the emission at 660 nm the spectrum at room temperature was exploited and the result is kF,B ≅ 0.5 × 108 s−1. For the emission at 540 nm the spectrum in a rigid matrix was used and the result is kF,A ≅ 5 × 108 s−1. Thus, a difference of one order of magnitude in the fluorescence rate constants suggests the presence of two states with a substantially different electronic nature.
The effect of temperature on the fluorescence emission was also studied in anisole (Fig. S8, ESI†). This solvent has been chosen because it allows temperatures higher than 298 K to be investigated. The spectrum undergoes broadening toward higher energy upon decreasing the temperature and reduction in width when the temperature is raised. These spectral features demonstrate that high temperatures favour the population of the species emitting at longer wavelength and vice versa.
Femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion and transient absorption
A clear-cut proof of the presence of two distinct emitting excited states emerged from fluorescence up-conversion kinetics acquired in a wide spectral range in anisole and toluene. In anisole (Fig. 5, inset of panel B), the kinetics recorded on the blue wavelength side show a fast decay occurring within tens of picoseconds and those on the red side show a rise taking place on an analogous time scale followed by a slower decay. The reconstructed emission spectra undergo a significant bathochromic shift in time. The Global and Target Analysis of the acquired data revealed that the best fitting is obtained when considering three consecutive exponential components characterised by lifetimes of 6.3, 38 and 380 ps and by Species Associated Spectra (SAS) centred at 530, 540 and 675 nm, respectively. The progressive red shift of the SAS maximum of the three components could be related to the occurrence of either some relaxation processes or population dynamics.

Moreover, the Time Resolved Area Normalised Emission Spectra (TRANES),46,47 reported in the lower panels of Fig. 6, show an initial continuous shift toward lower energies (compatible with solvation dynamics and/or vibrational cooling associated with the first transient of 6.3 ps) and an isoemissive point at 583 nm at longer delays, greater than 30 ps after light excitation. The latter is an unambiguous sign of the presence of two emissive electronic states, one evolving into the other, characterised by lifetimes of 38 and 380 ps, as they are the only two species present in solution at delay times longer than 30 ps (see Fig. 6, upper panel). The SAS positions of these two transients nicely match the two emissions revealed to differently contribute to the stationary fluorescence in various solvents or at different temperatures.
 Fig. 6  TRANES analysis of the fluorescence up-conversion data in anisole: concentration profiles of the transients obtained by Target Analysis (upper panel) and TRANES evolution over time (lower panels) in the 0.91–12 ps delay time interval (lower left panel) and in the 34–100 ps delay-time interval (lower right panel). 
Analogous results were obtained in the less polar toluene (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†) where the two distinct emitters exhibit lifetimes of 30 and 1700 ps and SAS centred at 550 and 650 nm, respectively. The latter transient shows a significantly longer lifetime with respect to that determined in anisole, which well agrees with the value obtained by nanosecond single photon counting measurements (see Table S2, ESI†). Other lifetime values obtained by fitting the up-conversion data (shorter components) could not be revealed by the nanosecond resolved fluorescence measurements due to the limited time-resolution (0.2 ns) of the latter.

Fig. 7 shows in detail the femtosecond transient absorption data obtained in anisole. The Global and Target Analysis of the data undisclosed the presence of four exponential components characterised by lifetimes of 0.35, 5.5, 37 and 450 ps (see panel C of Fig. 7). These time constants are in good agreement with those obtained from the fluorescence up-conversion measurement, with the only exception being the shortest component, which previously was not observed because of the reduced temporal resolution of the ultrafast emission apparatus with respect to the transient absorption set-up. The first three exponential components show rather similar SAS (see panel C of Fig. 7), characterised by a stimulated emission band progressively red shifting from 530 to 560 nm and by an excited state absorption band centred around 670 nm. These spectral features reflect that observed at early delay times in the time-resolved spectra (see panel B of Fig. 7) and allowed the three transients to be assigned to dynamics occurring within the same excited electronic state reached upon excitation: the 0.35 and 5.5 ps transients are associated with solvation dynamics (inertial and diffusive solvation)48,49 coupled with vibrational cooling, and the 37 ps transient with the relaxed excited state populated through light absorption (1A*) and responsible for the ca. 540 nm stationary emission. In line with the indications got from the TRANES analysis of the fluorescence up-conversion data, the 450 ps component is instead related to a different state (1B*), emitting at longer wavelengths. The SAS of this long-living component shows a broad and exclusively positive signal centred at 640 nm (blue trace in panel C of Fig. 7), whose intense excited state absorption prevails over its stimulated emission.

The effect of solvent polarity and viscosity on the excited state dynamics was deeply investigated by means of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Analogous transient spectra and spectral evolution in time were observed in all the investigated media and the results are summarised in Table S3 (ESI†). This finding suggests that the excited state deactivation mechanism is not much affected by changes in solvent properties and that the same relaxation processes and excited states are involved regardless of the medium. However, the excited state lifetimes were found to be strongly dependent on the solvent. The investigation of the effect of solvent polarity and viscosity proved to be revealing in order to get valuable information about the nature of the two emitting states. As for the state populated by light absorption (1A*), its lifetime exhibits values of tens of picoseconds in all the investigated solvents and does not show a trend with solvent dielectric constant (Fig. 8). Differently, its lifetime seems to be affected by solvent viscosity (η): in fact, longer lifetimes (114 and 47 ps) were measured in the most viscous media (decahydronaphthalene, η = 2.415 cP and dimethyl sulphoxide, η = 1.991 cP), even though they are characterised by very different polarities and the shortest lifetimes were obtained in the least viscous media among the investigated solvents (15 ps in isopentane, η = 0.225 cP; 11 ps in diethylether, η = 0.242 cP; 14 ps in acetone, η = 0.303 cP). Solvents characterised by a similar dielectric constant (such as diethylether and anisole) nicely show 1A* lifetimes in trend with their different viscosity (37 ps for anisole and 11 ps for diethylether).
 Fig. 8  Decay times 1A* and 1B* determined from transient absorption data as a function of solvent viscosity (left graph, best fitting according to eqn (2)) and polarity (right graph, showing a monotonic trend of τBversus (ε−1)/(2ε + 1)). 
The viscosity dependence of τA can be described using the equation:50 τ(η) ≈ ηα(2)A value close to 1 for the α parameter determined from fitting eqn (2) to the data of Anth (Fig. 8) indicates that the 1A* → 1B* transition is likely accompanied by structural rearrangements and large amplitude motions of the excited molecule. The longest living transient 1B* shows a lifetime which is substantially decreased (of almost two orders of magnitudes) upon increasing the solvent polarity: from 3300 ps in isopentane, to 1450 ps in toluene, 380 ps in chloroform, 170 ps in dichloromethane, down to 81 ps in dimethyl formamide (see Table S3, ESI†). The trend of this lifetime value with solvent dielectric constant51 is rather uniform (Fig. 8), with few exceptions probably due to specific interactions with the solvent (diethylether and EPA) or the high solvent polarizability (dimethyl sulphoxide). This result may suggest a certain intramolecular charge transfer character of this state (1B*).
Fluorescence rate constants for the 1A* and 1B* states in different solvents were calculated by using their fluorescence quantum yields and by employing the lifetimes retrieved for the corresponding transients by femtosecond absorption measurements (see Table S4, ESI†). As discussed above for the results obtained in EPA, the rate constant for the 1A* state is always about one order of magnitude higher than that calculated for the 1B* state.
Quantum mechanical calculations
Density functional theory calculations gave further information on the structural and electronic properties of the ground and relaxed excited electronic states. The optimised ground state geometry was calculated in cyclohexane, acetone and dimethyl formamide (see Fig. 9 and Table S5, ESI†). In all cases the molecule appears to be rather symmetrical in terms of spatial arrangement of the two styryl alkoxy substituted phenyl arms with respect to the central anthracene but not planar. The two lateral arms are indeed tilted (dihedral angles are reported in Table S5, ESI†) from the plane of the central chromophore. A similar geometry was predicted by the calculations for the relaxed S1 state in cyclohexane, still symmetrical and slightly more planar with respect to the corresponding S0 (Fig. 9). A significantly different structure is obtained when considering the optimised geometry for the lowest excited singlet state in polar solvents (dimethyl formamide and acetone, see Fig. 9), pointing out that a structural rearrangement especially involving one of the two arms (dihedral angle θ′ in Table S5, ESI†) takes place during the excited state relaxation.
 Fig. 9  Optimised geometries in cyclohexane and dimethyl formamide calculated by DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) (S0) and TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) (S1, shadowed). 
It is noteworthy that a fully symmetrical charge distribution between the two arms (X and Z, see Table S5, ESI†) with respect to the central aromatic part (Y) is revealed for the ground state of Anth by the Mulliken Charge analysis (Table S6, ESI†). This finding parallels the low value of the dipole moment obtained for the ground state of this highly symmetrical quadrupolar system (ca. 0.3 D, reported in Table S5, ESI†). Just a small charge shift takes place during light absorption (see data related to the Frank-Condon excited state in Table S6, ESI†) whereas interestingly the symmetry of the charge distribution is broken in the relaxed S1 in polar solvents (acetone and dimethyl formamide), with the latter becoming a slightly polar state (S1,OPT in Table S6, ESI†).52 It has been reported that TD-DFT calculations may fail in providing a correct description of charge transfer excited states.38 It might be particularly the case when considering neutral compounds bearing weak donors/acceptors. The polar character of the fully relaxed S1 state of Anth might be somehow underestimated by the computations. A small ICT character of this D–π–D quadrupolar system bearing mild donors such as the alkoxy groups would be in agreement with the low TPA cross section measured for this compound by means of two-photon excited fluorescence measurements (ca. 1.6 GM at 825 nm, a signal could be acquired in the 825–1000 nm range).53 These preliminary measurements showed that the recorded nonlinear excitation spectrum compared with the corresponding one-photon absorption features the onset of a new intense band in the region around 800 nm, indicating the presence of new transitions allowed by different selection rules as often observed for symmetric compounds.43
The calculated absorption spectra at the DFT level in cyclohexane, acetone and dimethyl formamide are in good agreement with their experimental counterparts (Table S7, ESI†). S1 is always described by an HOMO–LUMO configuration (Fig. S11, ESI†); the absorption and emission transitions are mainly localised on the anthracene (Fig. S12, ESI†), with the scarce involvement of the double bonds in the photoinduced charge migration being in agreement with the experimentally revealed negligible photoisomerisation. The predicted emission transition in cyclohexane (Table S7, ESI†) is close in energy to that experimentally revealed for the fluorescence of 1A*, whereas the predicted emission matches that of 1B* in polar media (acetone and dimethyl formamide). These findings may indeed suggest that two distinct excited states are involved in the photoinduced dynamics of Anth, with one being structurally analogous to the ground state and the other, obtained through an asymmetrical conformational rearrangement, being favoured in polar media. The results obtained by the calculations are in good agreement with the experimentally observed solvent viscosity dependence of τA and with the temperature effect on the fluorescence from which a torsional activation barrier for the 1A* →1B* transition was determined.
Experimental
The investigated compound (Anth, shown in Chart 1) was synthesized following previously reported procedures.29,32 Measurements were performed in various solvents (Fluka, spectroscopic grade): isopentane (IP), cyclohexane (CH), decahydronaphthalene (DHN), toluene (Tol), anisole (An), diethyl ether (DEE), chloroform (CHCl3), ethyl acetate (EtAc), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), acetone (Ac), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and a mixture of 5:5:2 (v/v) isopentane/diethyl ether/ethanol (EPA).
A Perkin-Elmer Lambda 800 spectrophotometer was used for the absorption measurements. The fluorescence spectra, corrected for the instrumental response, were measured using a Spex Fluorolog-2 F112AI spectrofluorimeter. To discern the contribution of distinct states, in some cases the emission spectra were plotted as a function of wavenumbers and fitted by two Gaussians by using the MatLab software. Dilute solutions (absorbance < 0.1 at the excitation wavelength, λexc) were used for fluorimetric measurements. The fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF, uncertainty ±10%) was determined at λexc corresponding to the maximum of the first absorption band. Tetracene (ϕF = 0.1754 in aerated cyclohexane) was used as a fluorimetric standard. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using the single photon counting method through an Edinburgh Instrument 199S spectrofluorimeter, equipped with a LED source centred at 460 nm, with a 0.2 ns temporal resolution. Measurements at different temperatures were performed using a cryostat (Oxford Instruments DN 1704). The kinetic traces were analyzed by means of the Least-squares and the Maximum Entropy methods. The latter was applied by using the MEMEXP Software available online.55,56 The Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), which is based on the simultaneous maximization of the entropy (S) and minimization of Poisson deviance (C), gives back the distribution of lifetimes, as well as the number of transients (family of distributions around an average time) needed to describe the spectroscopic kinetics. These distributions describe the probability of having different lifetimes.57–60 Further details regarding the MEM analysis are given in the ESI.† For photochemical measurements, a xenon lamp coupled with an interferential filter (λexc = 436 nm) and potassium ferrioxalate in 0.1 N sulphuric acid as an actinometer were used. The photoreaction (solute concentration ∼10−4 M) was monitored spectrophotometrically.
The experimental setups for femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion measurements have been widely described elsewhere.61–63 Briefly, the 400 nm excitation pulses of ca. 40 fs are generated using an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system (Spectra Physics). The transient absorption setup (Helios, Ultrafast Systems) is characterised by a temporal resolution of ca. 150 fs and a spectral resolution of 1.5 nm. Probe pulses are produced in the 475–750 nm range by passing a small portion of 800 nm light through an optical delay line (with a time window of 3200 ps) and focusing it into a 2 mm thick Sapphire window to generate a white-light continuum. In the up-conversion setup (Halcyone, Ultrafast Systems) the 400 nm pulses excite the sample whereas the remaining fundamental laser beam plays the role of the “optical gate” after passing through a delay line. The fluorescence of the sample is collected and focused onto a BBO crystal together with the delayed fundamental laser beam. The up-converted fluorescence beam is focused into the entrance of a monochromator by a lens, and it is then detected using a photomultiplier connected to a photon counter. The temporal resolution of the up-conversion equipment is about 250 fs, whereas the spectral resolution is 5 nm. Ultrafast spectroscopic data were fitted by Global and Target Analysis using the Glotaran software.64
Quantum-mechanical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.65 Density functional theory (DFT) based on the CAM-B3LYP method was used to optimize the geometry and to obtain the properties of the substrates in the ground state while the lowest excited singlet states were characterized by time dependent (TD) DFT CAM-B3LYP excited-state calculations.66,67 In both cases a 6-31G(d) basis set was employed. Solvation effects of cyclohexane, acetone and dimethyl formamide were included in the calculations by means of the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM).68 Calculations were carried out on a molecular structure with the C6H13 groups replaced by the CH3 ones.
Conclusions
A comprehensive investigation of the solvent effect on the spectra, photophysics and excited state dynamics of an alkoxy substituted quadrupolar symmetric D–π–D system was carried out in this work, allowing still open questions regarding its peculiar photobehaviour to be satisfactorily answered. Fluorescence emission spectra were indeed found to be strongly dependent upon solvent polarity. In particular, in polar solvents a clear dual emissive behaviour was revealed, with the bathochromic band becoming progressively less intense upon increasing the solvent polarity and a blue shifted emission becoming the prevalent one in these media. Relevant spectral modifications in the fluorescence were observed also upon decreasing the temperature in the EPA mixture. The red-shifted emission prevails at room temperature, but it is replaced by a hypsochromic fluorescence at low temperatures. These findings indicate the presence of two distinct fluorescent species (1A* and 1B*) responsible for the blue and red emissions, respectively, with the population of 1B* being inhibited in a rigid matrix and its fluorescence properties (maximum position and quantum yield) affected by solvent polarity. The presence of two different fluorescent states was unambiguously proved by femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements revealed that 1A* and 1B* are involved in the excited state deactivation in all the investigated media. Moreover, the lifetime of 1A* (tens of picoseconds) depends on solvent viscosity whereas the lifetime of 1B* is sensitive to solvent polarity (from several nanoseconds in non-polar to tens of picoseconds in highly polar solvents). A structural rearrangement from the ground state to the relaxed excited state optimised geometry is indeed predicted by the density functional theoretical calculations particularly in polar solvents, suggesting that large amplitude motions occur after light absorption when passing from 1A* to 1B*. Considerable experimental evidence points to a small ICT character of state 1B*, which may be underestimated by the calculations.
In conclusion, this study has shed new light on the photoinduced dynamics of Anth. A two-excited state model is totally adequate for its description and furnish a satisfactory explanation for the interesting aggregation-induced emission observed in thin films (where structural rearrangements are inhibited as well as population of 1B*). Such findings make this flexible compound really appealing for applications in organic electronics and photonics.

 	Fig. 4  Plot of the fluorescence quantum yields according to the Arrhenius-type equation.	 

 	Fig. 5  Fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy in anisole (λexc = 400 nm): (A) contour plot of the experimental data, (B) time-resolved emission spectra recorded at increasing delays after the laser pulse (inset: decay kinetics at meaningful wavelengths, with a linear scale for the first picoseconds and a log scale for longer times), and (C) Species Associated Spectra (SAS) calculated by target analysis.	 

 	Fig. 6  TRANES analysis of the fluorescence up-conversion data in anisole: concentration profiles of the transients obtained by Target Analysis (upper panel) and TRANES evolution over time (lower panels) in the 0.91–12 ps delay time interval (lower left panel) and in the 34–100 ps delay-time interval (lower right panel).	 

 	Fig. 7  Pump–probe absorption (λexc = 400 nm) in anisole: (A) contour plot of the experimental data, (B) time resolved absorption spectra recorded at different delays after the laser pulse. Insets: Decay kinetics recorded at meaningful wavelengths and (C) Species Associated Spectra (SAS) of the decay components obtained by target analysis.	 

 	Fig. 8  Decay times 1A* and 1B* determined from transient absorption data as a function of solvent viscosity (left graph, best fitting according to eqn (2)) and polarity (right graph, showing a monotonic trend of τBversus (ε−1)/(2ε + 1)).
