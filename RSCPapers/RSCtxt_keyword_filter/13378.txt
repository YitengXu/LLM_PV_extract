    , Accepted 31st August 2021First published on 7th September 2021Abstract“Giant” core/shell quantum dots (g-QDs) are promising candidates for emerging optoelectronic technologies thanks to their facile structure/composition-tunable optoelectronic properties and outstanding photo-physical/chemical stability. Here, we synthesized a new type of CuInTeSe (CITS)/CdS g-QDs and regulated their optoelectronic properties by controlling the shell thickness. Through increasing the shell thickness, as-prepared g-QDs exhibited tunable red-shifted emission (from 900 to 1200 nm) and prolonged photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes (up to ∼14.0 μs), indicating a formed band structure showing efficient charge separation and transfer, which is further testified by theoretical calculations and ultrafast time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. These CITS/CdS g-QDs with various shell thicknesses can be employed to fabricate photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, exhibiting improved photoresponse and stability as compared to the bare CITS QD-based devices. The results indicate that the rational design and engineering of g-QDs is very promising for future QD-based optoelectronic technologies.
Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted intense interests owing to their outstanding optical properties such as size-tunable emission, broad absorption spectrum, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY),1 facilitating their widespread usage in various optoelectronic technologies, such as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs),2–4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),5 photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for hydrogen production6 and QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).7 However, to date, one of the crucial challenges for colloidal QDs is the intrinsic instability induced by the high surface sensitivity to the surrounding environment (e.g. oxygen, light, moisture), leading to low physical-and chemical-stability that have a deteriorative effect on the performance and long-term operation for a variety of QD-based optoelectronic devices.8–12
Core/shell heterostructure engineering is a promising technique to optimize and enhance the photophysical properties of QDs.13,14 An inorganic shell grown on the core QDs provides a surface “barrier” which reduces the interaction between the core and the surrounding environment. The shell can efficiently passivate the surface traps/defects to alleviate the non-radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers, thus resulting in improved PLQY, reduced photobleaching and enhanced photophysical-and chemical stability.7,15 Among all kinds of core/shell QDs, the thick-shell QDs (with typical shell thickness larger than 1.5 nm), also referred to as “giant” core/shell QDs (g-QDs), have emerged as outstanding building blocks serving as light harvesters and emitters in various biomedical and optoelectronic applications.16–19 In these g-QDs systems, the core QDs are well protected with thick-shell cladding, exhibiting superior photophysical- and chemical stability as compared to plain QDs.7,20,21 An attractive feature of g-QDs is that their band structure can be engineered via tuning the composition of the core/shell materials, the shell thickness and core size.8 For instance, a typical CdSe/CdS g-QDs system has demonstrated a quasi-type II band structure, wherein the holes are confined within the core and the electrons are delocalized into the entire core/shell region.22,23 This reduced spatial overlapping of electrons and holes along with high-efficiency photoinduced exciton generation and long charge carriers lifetime are favorable for photovoltaic applications.24,25
In recent years, ternary I–III–VI2 QDs such as CuInX2 (X = S, Se, Te) have drawn tremendous research interests for optoelectronic applications due to their narrow band gap for broad light absorption and facile composition-tunable optical properties.26 Specifically, CuInTe2 possesses a smaller bandgap of ∼1 eV (bulk) than the CuInS2 and CuInSe2 counterparts, which is more favorable for broadband optoelectronic devices.27 Nevertheless, due to the instability of Te, CuInTe2 normally shows poor and unnoticeable optical properties with low photo/chemical stability. Alloyed CuInTeSe (CITS) QDs exhibit enhanced optical properties with respect to CuInTe2; however, when used to fabricate photovoltaic cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low (3.1%).28 Rational construction of CuInTeSe-based g-QDs is promising to further optimize the optoelectronic properties with improved photo/chemical stability, wavelength-tunable emission and tailored band structure (e.g. quasi-type II) for boosted performance in various photonic technologies.
Here, we successfully prepared a novel heterostructured CITS/CdS g-QD and investigated related morphology as well as crystal structure at diverse growth stages. The steady-state absorption and emission spectra revealed the shell thickness-correlated optical properties, wherein the PL emission red-shifted and the excitonic lifetime prolonged with incremental shell thickness, which demonstrated the quasi-type II band structure for effective spatial charge carrier separation in these g-QDs. The processes of excited states generation were further probed through time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, illustrating the ultrafast carrier dynamics in the core/shell heterostructure, especially exciton delocalization. Such g-QDs were then applied as light absorbers in a solar-driven PEC system, showing boosted photocurrent densities and device durability under standard AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
Experimental section
Materials
Copper(I) iodide (CuI) (≥99.99%), indium acetate (InAc3) (≥99.99%), sulfur (S) (≥99.99%), tellurium (Te), selenium (Se), cadmium oxide (CdO), oleylamine (OLA) (technical grade, 70%), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT), 1-octadecene (ODE) (technical grade, 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP) (97%), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), toluene, methanol, acetone were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Titania 18NR-AO paste was purchased from Dyesol (Queanbeyan, Australia). The Ti-Nanoxide BL/SC solution was purchased from Solaronix. All chemicals were used without further purification.
Synthesis of heterostructured CuInTeSe (CITS)/CdS g-QDs
CITS QDs were first synthesized by the approach described elsewhere.28 In a typical procedure, a mixture of CuI (0.4 mmol, 76 mg), InAc3 (0.4 mmol, 116 mg), 4 mL of DDT, and 2 mL of ODE were degassed at 90 °C for 1 h in a 25 mL flask I. Subsequently, the reaction solution cooled down to the room temperature under the N2 atmosphere and 0.8 mL of 0.5 M TOP-Te was injected into the solution. Meanwhile, 0.4 mL of 1 M TOP-Se was dispersed in 8 mL ODE in 25 mL flask II at 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. 3.4 mL of solution in flask I was rapidly injected into the flask II when it was heated to 250 °C under the nitrogen atmosphere. The mixed solution was then cooled down to 200 °C for 1 h reaction. As-prepared CITS QDs were centrifuged and purified with ethanol and re-dispersed in toluene for further characterization.
The CITS/CdS g-QDs were prepared using a modified procedure from previous work.29 Typically, 2 mL of purified CITS QDs acting as seeds were dissolved in ODE. 0.2 M Cd-oleate was prepared by dissolving 4 mmol of CdO in 8 mL of OA and 12 mL of ODE at ∼210 °C. 0.2 M of S precursor solution was prepared by 2 mmol of S dissolving in 2 mL of TOP and 8 mL of ODE. The mixture of 0.2 M Cd-oleate and S acting as precursors were injected into the reaction solution at 185 °C with a rate of 0.05 mL min−1 and raised the temperature to 215 °C for reaction with specific precursor volumes (details for synthesis of core/shell g-QDs are listed in Table S1†). After the reaction, the resulting QDs were purified with toluene and ethanol for further characterization.
Device fabrication and PEC measurement
The QDs-sensitized photoanode devices with 2 ZnS SILAR treatment were fabricated by the approach reported in the literature.30 The PEC measurements (J–V curves etc.) were measured with a three-electrode system along with a Class AAA Solar Simulator (SAN-EI, XES-50S1).31 For each measurement, a Si reference diode was used to calibrate the standard 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The evolution of H2 gas was measured using a GC (Shimadzu GC-2014) and the samples for measurement were collected using an airtight syringe.
IPCE calculation
The IPCE at each wavelength was calculated from the equation: (1)where λ corresponds to the incident light wavelength (nm), J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) at wavelength λ under illumination, and Ilight is the incident light irradiance intensity (mW cm−2).
The faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated from the equation: (2)where V(measured gas) and V(calculated gas) are experimental and theoretical volume of H2. Q represents the charge passed through the electrode, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), n represents the moles of electrons per mole of gas (n = 2 for H2), and Vm is molar volume of gas at room temperature (24.5 L mol−1). Theoretical molar production values of H2 were calculated according to the cumulative charge by means of chronopotentiometric analysis.
Characterization
The SEM images and EDS mapping were measured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI Inspect F50). The TEM images of QDs were obtained using Tecnai G2 F30 and Talos F200C Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscopes (FEI, USA). XPS spectra were acquired by a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS spectrometer. XRD patterns were obtained via a D8 ADVANCE X-ray Diffractometer from Bruker with Cu-Kα radiation between 10° and 70°. UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra was recorded using a TU-1810 Spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument, China). PL spectra and PL lifetime of the QDs in solution were acquired via a FLS 920 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 420 nm laser and an InGaAs NIR detector (Edinburgh Instrument, UK. The femtosecond broadband pump–probe measurement was carried out using specific set up with pump/laser sources.32
Results and discussion
Heterostructured CITS/CdS g-QDs were prepared through a facile two-step synthetic method.6 Briefly, the CITS QDs were firstly prepared by using a hot-injection method and served as seeds to further grow the CdS shell via a dropwise injection approach.15 The CdS shell thickness was controlled by varying the amount of injected Cd and S precursors (detailed information was summarized in Table S1,† the sample labels of S0–S5 refer to injected volume of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL, respectively). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of as-prepared CITS core QDs (S0) is displayed in Fig. S1a,† exhibiting an approximately pyramidal geometry with average sizes of ∼2 ± 0.5 nm (corresponding size distribution is provided in Fig. S2a†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of core QDs (Fig. 1g) shows typical distinct peaks which dovetail well between the crystalline planes of chalcopyrite structured CuInTe2 (#JCPDS 82-0450) and CuInSe2 (#JCPDS 40-1487).33,34 Moreover, the crystal structure of the core QDs is probed using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs. As shown in Fig. S1b,† the interplanar distance of 0.34 nm in the core QDs is indexed between the (112) planes of CuInSe2 and CuInTe2.35 XRD and TEM characterizations demonstrate that the as-synthesized core QDs is comprised of quaternary alloyed CITS.28,33

In Fig. 1a–c, representative TEM images of the as-obtained S2, S3 and S4 core/shell g-QDs show a pyramidal geometry with increasing QD sizes of 4 ± 0.5, 7 ± 0.5 and 8.5 ± 1 nm, respectively. The size distribution of all the core/shell g-QDs at different growth stages (from S1 to S5) are shown in Fig. S2.† The increasing sizes of core/shell QDs with continuous precursor injection indicate the successful growth of shell materials around the core QDs. The inset HRTEM images in Fig. 1a–c exhibit a typical lattice spacing (0.33 nm), which matches the (111) plane of CdS with zinc blende (ZB) phase.36 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of CITS/CdS QDs from S1 to S5 (Fig. S3b, Fig. 1d–f and Fig. S3d†) further demonstrated the growth of ZB phase CdS shell. As compared to S0 QDs, the XRD patterns (Fig. 1g) of S1 and S2 QDs revealed gradually diminished peaks of (112), (204) and (312) planes of typical CITS patterns, indicating the weaker signal of CITS core QDs with the growth of the CdS shell. Finally, the XRD patterns of S3, S4 and S5 g-QDs exhibit three prominent peaks indexed to (311), (220) and (111) planes of ZB phase CdS from the shell.37 The representative patterns of the core [e.g. (112) plane] QDs shift to the patterns of the core/shell [(111) plane of CdS] QDs with increasing shell thickness in Fig. 1g, which is in good accordance with the results obtained from the HRTEM and SAED of S0 to S5 QDs as well. As calculated from the XRD patterns, the CITS/CdS core/shell QDs exhibited decreasing lattice parameters of the main crystal planes (Table S2†) with thicker CdS shell, which is due to the smaller lattice constant of CdS than CITS. Moreover, the EDS spectra of core (Fig. S4†) and core/shell QDs (Fig. S5†) demonstrate the existence of all the elements including Cu, In, Se, Te, Cd and S in the QDs, which is consistent with the high-resolution XPS spectra of CITS/CdS core/shell QDs (Fig. S6†).
The evolution of morphology, size distribution and crystalline structure from CITS core QDs to CITS/CdS core/shell g-QDs was briefly and schematically illustrated in Fig. 1h. In the initial growth stages from S0 to S1, the shell materials were coated on the core CITS QDs, leading to the approximately pyramidal shape of S1 QDs. Subsequently, the g-QDs present a uniform pyramidal structure and larger sizes from the growth stages of S2 to S5 QDs. Meanwhile, the crystalline structure of QDs transforms from chalcopyrite phase alloyed CITS to the ZB phase CdS after shell coating, as demonstrated by the SAED and XRD patterns.
As-synthesized heterostructured g-QDs exhibit tunable optical properties with diverse shell thicknesses, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a displays the absorption spectra of the g-QDs with continuous shell growth. Prior to the shell coating, the S0 core QDs exhibit a distinctive broad absorption [from visible to near-infrared (NIR) region] without obvious excitonic peaks. On the contrary, after the coating of the CdS shell, as-obtained core/shell g-QDs present blue-shifted light absorption with obvious enhancement in the UV-visible region. Such absorption feature of core/shell g-QDs in the visible region is consistent with the characteristic absorption spectrum of CdS,38 which is expected to dominate from S3 QDs. The results demonstrate that the UV/visible absorption and the normalized NIR absorption (inset of Fig. 2a) in such CITS/CdS g-QDs are derived from the dominant thick CdS shell and CITS core, respectively. The absorption of CdS shell in UV/visible range gradually enhanced with increasing shell thickness. To make the exciton peaks more visible, we normalized the absorption spectra of QDs at 400 nm and labeled the peaks using red dashed box, as shown in Fig. S7.†

(d) Schematic diagram for the band structure evolution of CITS/CdS g-QDs with increasing shell thickness. 
We further roughly evaluated the bandgaps of core and core/shell QDs based on the Tauc plot analysis of QDs’ absorption spectra (Fig. S8†). The bandgap values of the CITS/CdS core/shell QDs continuously increase due to the growth of CdS shell materials with larger band gap than that of the CITS core materials.

Fig. 2b presents the emission spectra of the g-QDs with various shell thicknesses, and the specific emission peak positions are summarized in Table S3.† The bare CITS QDs show a typical NIR emission peak at ∼845 nm (Fig. S9†), which is in accordance with previous work.28 In comparison, the core/shell g-QDs depict a red-shift of emission peaks from ∼915 to ∼1200 nm (S1 to S5) with persistent growth of CdS shell. Such red-shift of PL peaks with growing shell thickness in the g-QDs systems is ascribed to the formed quasi-type II band alignment of CITS and CdS, in which the electrons delocalize in the whole CITS/CdS core/shell region and the holes are localized in the CITS core.39,40 This conclusion is further demonstrated by the transient PL lifetime measurements as shown in Fig. 2c. The average PL lifetimes of S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 g-QDs (Table S3†) also prolonged with increasing shell thickness, which were measured to be ∼10.5, 11.9, 12.2, 12.4, and 14.0 μs, respectively. As a result, the large Stokes shift can be achieved in such CITS/CdS g-QDs, which is more prominent in the g-QDs with thick shell (i.e. S4 and S5 g-QDs). This is induced by the gradually blue-shifted light absorption in the UV-visible region and the red-shifted emission in the NIR region with increasing shell thickness.
Generally, the electronic band structure of g-QDs is strongly associated with the core size and shell thickness. In our CuInTeSe/CdS g-QDs, with the increasing CdS shell thickness over the CITS core, the conduction band offset between core and shell gradually decreases and the electrons are prone to delocalize into the whole core/shell region, while the holes are still confined in the shell, thus leading to the change of the electronic band structure from type I to quasi-type II band alignment, as illustrated in Fig. 2d.
The PL quantum yield (QY) of QDs was measured and listed in Table S3.† The initial shell coating (thinner shell) in S1 and S2 QDs can give rise to higher QY due to the gradually effective shell passivation, while the QY decreased from S3 to S5 QDs owing to the newly induced defects/traps in the thicker CdS shell.14,41 The red-shifted PL emission peaks and extended PL lifetime of these core/shell g-QDs with incremental CdS shell thickness have demonstrated the quasi-type II band structure in such CITS/CdS g-QDs.42–44 Moreover, the pyramidal shape of the g-QDs leads to more efficient spatial electron–hole separation for as-measured ultralong PL lifetime.6 Such lifetime of ∼14.0 μs is comparable among the previous reported CdSe/CdS, CISeS/CdSeS/CdS, PbSe/CdSe/CdSe, CuInSe2/CuInS2, and InP/CdSe g-QDs,6,7,15,45,46 as compared and listed in Table S4,† implying efficient electron–hole separation/transfer to achieve high-performance photovoltaic devices.47
Time-resolved optical pump–probe spectroscopy is widely used for investigating the charge carrier dynamics in various optoelectronic materials.32,48 Investigating the photo-induced carrier dynamics in core/shell CITS/CdS g-QDs with unique quasi-type II band structure can provide a fundamental understanding of their optoelectronic applications. The TA measurements of all samples were performed with a pump wavelength of 500 nm (pulse energy, 0.9 μJ). Fig. 3a and d exhibit the 3D (transient time delay vs. wavelength vs. intensity) TA spectra of S0 core QDs and S4 core/shell g-QDs recorded from 850 to 1300 nm. The TA spectra of QDs show two conspicuous features: a negative absorption of the bleaching signal around 900 nm and a broad positive absorption signal from 1000 to 1300 nm. The negative signal around 900 nm is assigned to the ground state bleaching (GSB), which is due to the removal of the occupied valence band (VB) population and state-filling of the electron in the conductive band upon excitation.48 The negative signal reduced by the band edge bleach corresponds to the narrow bandgap transition of the core QDs in the NIR region. The broad positive TA in the infrared range of 1000 to 1300 nm is attributed to the photoinduced excited state absorption (ESA) involving excited charge carriers.49 Due to the photoinduced charge transitions in the core QDs, in which the degeneracy of the VB is high because of the hole localized on the copper atom, a broad and featureless ESA was observed.50,51

(c) Fitted TA dynamics probed at 900 nm, 1000 nm, 1100 nm and 1200 nm. Ultrafast time-resolved TA spectra for S4 g-QDs in (d) three-dimensional (3D) mapping and (e) at various time delays. (f) Fitted TA dynamics probed at 900 nm, 1000 nm, 1100 nm and 1200 nm. 
The dynamics of GSB around 900 nm is exponential with three lifetime components, as shown in Fig. 3c. The fast carrier relaxation on the time scale is less than one picosecond. The recovery on a time scale of a few picoseconds is attributed to the photoinduced exciton decay. The subsequent recovery is due to the photoinduced carrier recombination process. As summarized in Table S5,† the negative absorption decay of the core (photo) bleaching signal around 900 nm was fitted with the lifetime components: the hot carrier relaxation (426.2 fs), the photoinduced exciton decay (11.81 ps) and the photoinduced carrier recombination (267.9 ps).
As compared to the S0 core QDs showing fast photoinduced exciton decay (e.g. 5.42 ps at 1100 nm) and charge recombination process with a time scale of tens picosecond (e.g. 81.5 ps in 1100 nm), the S4 core/shell QDs exhibited a similar process of GSB, but a prominently different process of ESA with the shell coating. The recovery curve of ESA was fitted with the lifetime components (Table S5†): a prolonged lifetime of photoinduced excitons (such as 36.8 ps at 1100 nm) and the prominently extended process of photoinduced excitations including trapped electron and charge recombination, which is longer than 10 ns (at 1100 nm) that out of the measurement time window. Fitted decay dynamics of the representative QDs (S0 and S4) are shown in Fig. 3b, c and e, f. The dynamics of GSB exhibited the similar fast carrier cooling and recombination processes in the both QDs. While the longer decays of ESA indicated the population of electron was reinforced, which provided the striking evidence for enhanced electron delocalization and decrease of trap states after shell coating.52,53 As displayed in Fig. S10, Fig. 3f and S11,† the TA spectra and corresponding recovery profiles of ESA decay illustrate the suggested mechanism of extended lifetime for photoinduced exciton generation and separation. The tremendous prolonged delay time of the photoinduced exciton is attributed to the excitons delocalization in the core/shell QDs because of the quasi-type II band structure.54,55
To complement the characterization and the discussion on the prolonged lifetimes of the heterostructured g-QDs, we conducted a theoretical study of this core/shell g-QDs system. We model the g-QDs as continuous material systems supporting discrete electronic states constrained by the geometry and different properties of the compositions of the heterogeneous QDs. We solve the Schrödinger equation numerically, using COMSOL Multiphysics, in the systems defined by potential wells with values extracted from materials’ band energies and extending spatially over the pyramidal QD geometries. We thus obtain the appropriately normalized wavefunction of the conduction band for the system under quantum confinement, ψe(r), from which we can study its spatial extension. The delocalization of the excited electronic states strongly affects the lifetimes of the optically excited states in the QD, i.e. the probability of electron–hole recombination. The higher the spatial overlap between the excited electron and the hole, the higher the probability of a recombination event occurring. In particular, this can be modeled by the overlap integral for the QD, OI, calculated as (3)which depends on the overlap integral of each individual recombination center, (4)
In order to understand eqn (3) and (4), we should note that we are modelling the recombination processes as being dominated by events occurring at crystal impurities. These have energies in the middle of the semiconductor bandgap, and are spatially located at the QD's core.56 As noted in the integral in eqn (1), we assume that these impurities are homogeneously distributed across the core's volume and model their wavefunction as (5)
The parameters used in eqn (3)–(5) are the total number of impurities, Nimp, the volume of the QD's core, Vcore, the impurity's position, rimpurity, the magnitude setting the scale of the hole's size, Lh = 0.3 nm, and the coefficient A used to fulfill the normalization condition for the hole's wavefunction . However, by considering the more realistic case of impurities acting as recombination centers, we are not strongly departing of the general ideal case with no impurities, because the spatial extension of the holes does remain strongly localized at the QD's core, as shown by Fig. S12.†
A relevant property of the g-QDs studied in this work is their characteristic tetrahedral shape, which we reproduce in our theoretical calculations. The models used in the calculations and their material composition are depicted in Fig. 4a, with the sizes of the different components of the models being listed in Table S1,† following closely the values extracted from the experimental characterization of the samples. All corners in the structures were rounded with a radius of 0.2 nm, to avoid the spurious effects of unphysically sharp features on the wavefunction distribution. We find the first excited state of each QD model by considering that the electronic states are constrained by a step-like potential characteristic of type-I core–shell systems, and obtaining the values of this potential at each material region from values reported in the existing literature.57–60 The summary of these values can be found in Tables S6 and 7,† which also includes the effective masses of the charge carriers in these materials.
 Fig. 4  Theoretical calculation of the CITS/CdS g-QDs. (a) Geometrical models of the original CITS QD (S0) and the series of heterostructured g-QDs ordered by increasing size (S1–S5). As depicted, all of the core–shell g-QDs include a CITS core and a CdS outer shell. (b) Probability density for the 1s electrons at the central cross-section of the S5 g-QD. The arrows represent the paths chosen to represent the data in panel c. (c) Probability density of the 1s electrons in all the systems (S0–S5) along the three high symmetry paths depicted in panel b. As the shell layers grow, the electronic states modeling the first unoccupied states become more delocalized across the structure. (d) Comparison between 1/OI (calculated with eqn (1)) and the average lifetimes measured in the experimental samples, showing the theoretical model that considers the overlap between the electrons and the core impurity holes wavefunctions qualitatively reproduce the upwards trend in lifetime with respect to shell thickness. (e) Surface map at the outer surface of the S5 g-QD, showing the probability density of the electrons modeling the excited states in the QD. Due to the geometrical proximity of the CIST core to the surfaces, the delocalized states will preferentially leave the g-QDs through the pyramids’ faces centers. This is schematically illustrated with 3D arrow flowing from the maximum of |ψ|2 at one of the four faces of the QD. 
The results from these simulations support the experimental results, wherein the increasingly large heterostructured g-QDs should display longer lifetimes of their optically excited states, as we can gather from the summary of results presented in Fig. 4. Although the wavefunction of the excited electron remains centered at the core of the QD, as shown in Fig. 4b and as one would expect from at type-I system, the data represented in Fig. 4b and c clearly show how the electron cloud delocalizes across the QD as we consider the larger models with increasing shell thickness. A comparison with the smaller degree of delocalization of the holes in the system (Fig. S12†) points out that this system would behave as a quasi-type II heterojunction. As discussed above, the information about the spatial extension of the electrons wavefunction is used to obtain the overlap integral with the impurity holes (eqn (1)), so that we can study the evolution of the value of 1/OI, which should be proportional to the lifetime of the excited state. The theoretical results indeed line up with the experimental data, as shown by the qualitative agreement between them in Fig. 4d. We can see how the modeling of the increasing size of the CdS layers do increase the 1/OI, matching the tendency of the experimentally measured lifetimes.
A particularly interesting property arises from the particular geometrical structure of these heterostructured g-QDs. Given their growth into tetrahedral structures, their CIST core does remain closer to the outer faces of the structure than to its vertices. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, this also suggests that the excited electronic state, which extends itself from its center at the core, will have a larger probability of being injected into the QD's environment by traversing through the faces of the structure than through its corners or vertices. This is particularly relevant because it can inspire the rational design of possible superstructures, constructed with these nanoparticles as fundamental components, and obtaining higher light conversion efficiencies.
These quasi-type II g-QDs with ultralong lifetime present great potential for photonic conversion applications such as solar-driven PEC cells.61 Employing these g-QDs as light absorbers, we fabricated a solar-driven PEC cell for H2 generation according to the method reported in our previous work.6 The thickness of the QDs/TiO2 film was estimated to be ∼16 μm by using cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. S13a.† Moreover, the EDS mapping of the photoanode in Fig. S13b–k† revealed the uniform loading of core/shell g-QDs in the mesoporous-TiO2 film, indicating an effective sensitization to form QDs/TiO2 heterostructures for efficient electron transfer. Fig. 5a displays the scheme and working principle of a typical QDs-based PEC cell. When the QDs-sensitized photoanode is exposed to light, the photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated from the QDs, wherein the photogenerated holes were efficiently extracted by the sacrificial agents (Na2S/Na2SO3) in the electrolyte, whereas the electrons migrated from QDs to the TiO2 and the counter electrode (Pt) for the production of hydrogen by water reduction.62,63

(b) Photocurrent density-applied bias dependence (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) of S4 g-QDs-sensitized photoanode in the dark, under constant and chopped illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). (c) IPCE spectra of S0 and S4 QDs-based PEC devices. (d) Photocurrent density decay of the S0 core and S4 g-QDs-based PEC device under constant light irradiation. 
The device performance of g-QDs-based PEC cells was examined by a typical three-electrode system using g-QDs-sensitized photoanode as the working electrode. The J–V curves were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry measurements under dark, continuous light and chopped illuminations (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 5b displays the PEC performance of S4 g-QDs based photoanode. No obvious photocurrent density was observed throughout the dark curve measurement. However, during continuous light irradiation, the photocurrent density gradually started to boost with increased applied bias (V) versus RHE and a maximum photocurrent density of ∼4.5 mA cm−2 was acquired. This value of photocurrent density was found to be much higher than the photocurrent density of S0 (core) QDs-based photoanode, which was found to be only around 0.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. S14†). For comparison purposes, we summarized the performance of recent g-QDs-based PEC systems in Table S8.†6,15,64–66 The maximum photocurrent density of our S4 g-QDs-based sample is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art g-QDs-based PEC cells.
Furthermore, the PEC performance of S1, S2, S3 and S5 g-QDs-based PEC photoanodes were also measured and photocurrent densities of QDs-based PEC devices were obtained, respectively (Table S9†). These results reveal that the S4 QDs are the g-QDs system with optimized optoelectronic properties and quasi-type II band structure, wherein the electrons and holes possess large spatial separation, as indicated by the ultralong lifetime. The S5 g-QDs-based PEC cell showed lower photocurrent density, which is attributed to the formation of new defects/traps in the case of thicker shell in g-QDs systems, which leads to non-radiative recombination and hampers the efficiency of PEC cells.65,67 To confirm the origination of photocurrent, the incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of S0 and S4 QDs-based PEC cells were evaluated from visible to the NIR region (Fig. 5c), showing largely enhanced conversion efficiency of S4 QD-samples in the visible region and decreased efficiency in the NIR region with respect to S0 QD-samples, which is corresponding to the absorption spectra of QDs.68 Moreover, we measured the IPCE spectra of S5 g-QDs-based PEC device (Fig. S15†), showing overall lower IPCE values than that of the optimized S4 g-QDs-based sample, which is consistent with the lower photocurrent density measured for the S5 g-QDs sample. The decreased IPCE value may be attributed to the poor photoinduced charge transfer dynamics within the QDs/TiO2 heterostructure and the interfacial charge dynamics between the QDs and the electrolyte.
The photocurrent density decay versus time was obtained for the S4 g-QDs-based photoanode under constant light illumination of up to 2 hours (Fig. 5d). As compared to the core QDs, the core/shell structure g-QDs exhibited enhanced device stability. The photocurrent density of S4 g-QDs based photoanode decayed with time and retained about ∼60% after 2 hours, while the photocurrent density of the core QDs exhibited a fast decay with only ∼30% remaining. The stability test verified the as-prepared core/shell QDs-photoanodes secure better device stability than that of the bare QDs under photo-irradiation. We estimated the amount of hydrogen production by S4 based PEC cell via using a gas chromatography (GC) system. The theoretical and experimental amount of hydrogen are shown in Fig. S14f.† Based on these results, the Faraday efficiency (F.E.) was calculated to be around ∼60%. These results allow us to infer that the optimized core/thick-shell g-QDs endowed the improved photo/chemical stability and tailored optical properties, which are very promising for future solar energy conversion applications with similar mechanism of PEC cells, such as QDSCs.
Conclusion and perspectives
In conclusion, novel CITS/CdS g-QDs possessing diverse shell thicknesses were synthesized via a simple two-step approach. As-synthesized g-QDs display a pyramidal geometry with ZB phase shell. These g-QDs exhibit red-shifted NIR PL emission (reaching up to 1200 nm) and prolonged lifetime (∼14.0 μs) with growing shell thicknesses, demonstrating the construction of quasi-type II band structure. In addition, the time-resolved spectroscopy results revealed the dynamics of photoinduced exciton generation and charge transfer processes in this core/shell heterostructured system. The theoretical modeling also supports the conclusion that the first excited electronic state becomes more delocalized as we consider larger g-QDs, therefore increasing their excitonic lifetimes. A PEC cell fabricated based on these g-QDs show a maximum photocurrent density of ∼4.5 mA cm−2 under standard AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and outstanding device stability. Our results imply that manipulating the optoelectronic properties of g-QDs is beneficial to boost the performance of QDs-based photonic devices. The tunable NIR photoluminescence and long lifetime feature of our g-QDs are promising for applications in NIR biomedical imaging, optical communication and various NIR optoelectronic devices (e.g. LEDs).

 	Fig. 4  Theoretical calculation of the CITS/CdS g-QDs. (a) Geometrical models of the original CITS QD (S0) and the series of heterostructured g-QDs ordered by increasing size (S1–S5). As depicted, all of the core–shell g-QDs include a CITS core and a CdS outer shell. (b) Probability density for the 1s electrons at the central cross-section of the S5 g-QD. The arrows represent the paths chosen to represent the data in panel c. (c) Probability density of the 1s electrons in all the systems (S0–S5) along the three high symmetry paths depicted in panel b. As the shell layers grow, the electronic states modeling the first unoccupied states become more delocalized across the structure. (d) Comparison between 1/OI (calculated with eqn (1)) and the average lifetimes measured in the experimental samples, showing the theoretical model that considers the overlap between the electrons and the core impurity holes wavefunctions qualitatively reproduce the upwards trend in lifetime with respect to shell thickness. (e) Surface map at the outer surface of the S5 g-QD, showing the probability density of the electrons modeling the excited states in the QD. Due to the geometrical proximity of the CIST core to the surfaces, the delocalized states will preferentially leave the g-QDs through the pyramids’ faces centers. This is schematically illustrated with 3D arrow flowing from the maximum of |ψ|2 at one of the four faces of the QD.
