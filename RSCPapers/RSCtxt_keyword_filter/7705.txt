The introduction of RGO nanosheets substantially improved the performance of 2D porous Co3O4 nanoflakes as counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSCs with this Co3O4@RGO CE displayed a power conversion efficiency of 5.79%, which is greatly higher than that of pure Co3O4 CE (1.2%) or pure RGO CE (2.2%), and even comparable to that of the conventional Pt CE (6.16%). At the same time, with the addition of RGO, the electrochemical stability of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids is also greatly improved. This work gives an idea on how to take the advantage and to avoid the disadvantage of 2D nanoflakes by introducing RGO nanosheets. Meanwhile, the experimental result demonstrates that Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are advanced CEs in DSSCs and may open a window for potential applications in any other related fields.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) featuring pollution-free nature, low consumption and simple fabrication procedures have received much more attention as a potential candidate for new solar energy source devices.1–4 In typical DSSCs, a counter electrode (CE, usually Pt) is a crucial component governing the electrochemical performance. It not only collects the electrons from the peripheral circuit, but also behaves as a catalyst for the redox couple regeneration.5,6 Since Pt is a noble metal with high price and limited availability, it is not a suitable alternative CE.7,8 Fortunately, many explorations have been launched to find candidates. Some metal oxides such as TaO,9 WO2,10 ZnO,11 Nb2O512 and Bi4Ti3O1213 have been investigated and tried to substitute for Pt as promising electrode materials due to their large abundance and good stability.
Among many metal oxides, Co3O4 has not been reported as a CE before. Nevertheless, owing to its good electrochemical capability, it has been widely used in supercapacitors,14 lithium ion batteries15 and electrocatalytic system.16 Hence, we successfully prepared 2-dimensional (2D) porous Co3O4 nanoflakes (Co3O4 NFs) via a simple hydrothermal reduction process and applied them as CEs in DSSCs. The photovoltaic performances demonstrate that, however, these nanoflakes have quite a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only about 1.20%. Morphology observations revealed that the as-synthesized 2D porous Co3O4 NFs stacked and aggregated together. The specific structural restriction is detrimental to the diffusion of the triiodide electrolyte. In our previous work, NiCo2O4 nanobelts anchored on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets as CEs demonstrated attractive properties.17 As a new member of the carbon material family, RGO has become a attractive material in recent years due to its large specific surface area, extraordinary chemical stability and outstanding electrical properties.18 Based on those considerations, we would like to introduce RGO into the 2D nanoflakes to overcome their aggregation, and take the advantage of the synergistic effect of RGO into the 2D nanoflakes as well.
Herein, 2D porous Co3O4 NFs anchored on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Co3O4@RGO) have been fabricated via a facile hydrothermal reduction process. As seen in Fig. 1, the samples were then coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass to construct CEs. Compared with the pure Co3O4 NF, the Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids have a larger specific surface area, which not only offer more electrocatalytic active sites but also help in the electrolyte adsorption.19,20 The DSSCs equipped with Co3O4 NF CEs showed a low PCE of 1.20%. With the introduction of RGO nanosheets, the DSSC with the hybrid CE substantially achieved a PCE of 5.79%, which is even up to 94% of that of Pt (6.16%). Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test revealed that the existence of RGO nanosheets also improves the stability performance of Co3O4 NF for catalyzing triiodides and has a great electrochemical rate for the oxidation reduction reaction.

2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of 2D porous Co3O4 NFs
2D porous Co3O4 NFs were synthesized by annealing after a hydrothermal process. Typically, 0.58 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in distilled water (30 mL). After being stirred to form a transparent solution, 8 mL of 2-aminoethanol were added into the solution, followed by magnetic stirring for 2 h. After that, the mixture was moved into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL capacity) to be sealed and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the bottom sediments were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and water a few times in turns. Then the achieved precursor was dried at 60 °C for 8 hours in an oven. To obtain pure 2D porous Co3O4 NFs, the powder was heated at 350 °C in air for 2 h at a slow annealing rate of 2 °C min−1.
2.2 Synthesis of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids
The graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) were synthesized by applying a modified Hummers procedure.21 As shown in the detailed operation, firstly, 20 mL of H3PO4 (85%) and 180 mL of H2SO4 (98%) were mixed in a steady rate to form a smooth intermixture. The mixture was then transferred to a 50 °C oil bath with continued stirring. Secondly, 1.5 g natural graphite powder and 9 g KMnO4 were added into the above mixture in turns gradually and slowly to maintain the temperature at about 50 °C. After that, the mixture was stirred for 6 h under the same conditions. Thirdly, 200 mL of diluted H2O2 were injected into the mixture using a needle tubing until the color changed from black to bright yellow. After that, the mixture liquid exhibited no bubbles together with another 3 h stirring. Finally, after being cooled to room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugal separation and washed with deionized water several times until the supernatant was close to neutral. The obtained GO was dispersed in distilled water for further use.
The Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids were prepared via a facile hydrothermal reduction method (150 °C, 5 h) by using the as-fabricated 2D porous Co3O4 NFs and GO aqueous suspension as the original materials. In detail, 0.1 g Co3O4 NFs were dispersed in distilled water (30 mL) under continuous stirring, then 6 mL of GO suspension (7.6 mg mL−1) were added to the solution. After mixing and treating with ultrasonic stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred to the autoclave for a hydrothermal reduction step. Here, the functional groups (like –OH and –COOH), which existed on the basal plane and edge of GO nanosheets, would be eliminated. So the GO was reduced to become RGO.22 Finally, the products (Co3O4@RGO) were obtained by a lyophilization process for about 1 day.
2.3 Material characterization
The crystalline structures of Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrid samples were characterized using a X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu K radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The microstructures and their energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were characterized on an automated surface area and pore analyzer (Beishide 3H-2000PS1). The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs were evaluated by using a solar light simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., LTD, XES-402S-CE) and a digital source meter (Keithley 2410) under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and AM 1.5. CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization curves were measured on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium CIMPS-1).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are shown in the left area of Fig. 2. The dominant broadened peaks at about 19.1°, 31.5°, 37.0°, 45.1°, 55.2°, 59.6° and 65.2° are unambiguously indexed to (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) of spinel cobalt oxide (JCPDS Card No. 74-1657). No other obvious peaks are detected for the two samples, indicating that there are no impurities in the as-synthesized material.23 Besides, the XRD pattern of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids does not exhibit any distinct carbon-related peak. The phenomenon may be attributed to the XRD diffractometer limitation. The relatively large amounts of Co3O4 NF recede the diffraction intensity of the low loading of RGO.24,25 The Raman spectrum is one of the key proofs to prove the presence of RGO. As shown in the right area of Fig. 2, the Raman spectra of the Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids display the same stretching vibration peaks at 187, 473, and 680 cm−1. The three peaks correspond to F2g, Eg, and A1g modes of the crystalline Co3O4 phase, respectively.26 Meanwhile, two peaks at about 1334 cm−1 (D band) and 1592 cm−1 (G band) are easily found in spectra of both RGO and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids. The two bands can indicate the presence of graphene and the intensity ratio between D and G bands manifests that GO has been reduced.27 As a consequence, the Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids have been successfully fabricated.

The morphologies of 2D porous Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are investigated using SEM and TEM. Fig. 3a and c show microstructures of 2D porous Co3O4 NF. It can be seen that the as-prepared Co3O4 NF look like leaves without a fixed morphology and regular size, but with a uniform thickness of 10 nm. Furthermore, a lot of holes can also be easily found in the nanoflakes. However, the nanoflakes stack and hold together irregularly. This situation curbs their large specific surface area, which can be confirmed by the BJH method below. The inset in Fig. 2c shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, which reveals the single-crystalline nature of Co3O4 NF. The SEM and TEM images of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are shown in Fig. 3b and e. The 2D porous Co3O4 NFs separate and adhere to RGO nanosheets. The EDX spectrum of the Co3O4@RGO indicates the presence of Co, O and C elements. The reason for the formation of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids may be attributed to the interplay of many functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxy couple and hydroxyl existed on GO nanosheets with the surface of Co3O4 NS.28 During the hydrothermal reduction, unpaired π electrons arose on account of the removal of functional groups, which were more easily combined to the surface atoms of Co3O4 NS.29Fig. 3f shows an HRTEM image of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids. Clear lattice fringes of about 0.46 nm correspond to the space distance of (111) planes of spinel cobalt oxide, which confirms the XRD result above.

The nitrogen adsorption and desorption properties of Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are shown in Fig. 4a. The BET surface area of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids is 44.7 m2 g−1, which is about 1.5 times higher than that of Co3O4 NF (31.3 m2 g−1). This means that Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids can afford more electrolyte adsorption sites than Co3O4 NF. The result can also evidence the difference of the microstructures between the two samples. The BJH method was used to calculate the pore size distributions of Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids. As shown in Fig. 4b, the pore size distribution with maxima at about 2.8 and 3.5 nm can be revealed by the curves of the samples, respectively.

EIS measurements can effectively reveal the interfacial charge transfer process and electronic conductivity. As Fig. 5 shows, the far left intercept on the horizontal axis can be defined as the ohmic series resistance (Rs), which is attributed to lead connection and substrate resistance outside a circuit. The semicircle belongs to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), which emerges at the CE/electrolyte interface. The low-frequency region is assigned to the redox couple in the electrolyte, which is defined as the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN).30 The corresponding values are presented in Table 1. The ZN value of Co3O4@RGO is the smallest, which means that the composites have a fastest diffusion velocity of the triiodide.31 Meanwhile, Co3O4@RGO has the lowest Rct (1.26 Ω). In contrast, Rct of Co3O4 is quite large (994.12 Ω), because irregularly aggregated 2D nanoflakes limit the transmission rate of the electrolyte. The result indicates that the Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids have the highest catalytic competence among these CEs.32

To further investigate the transferring properties of the I−/I3− redox couple on the four CE surfaces, Tafel polarization curves of various CEs are presented in Fig. 6. The slope of the cathodic branch is defined as the exchange current density (J0) and the intersection of the cathodic branch and the Y-axis represent the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim). The Co3O4@RGO exhibits the largest J0 than the other CEs, indicating that Co3O4@RGO possesses the best diffusion velocity for the reduction of triiodide in the electrolyte.33 The result is consistent with the above EIS analysis, which can be estimated using the following formulae, (1) (2)where n is the number of electrons, which transfer between the electrode and electrolyte, R and T are the gas constant and thermodynamic temperature, F and NA are the Faraday and Avogadro constants. D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, C is the iodide/triiodide concentration and l is the electrode gap. According to the above analysis, ZN of the Co3O4@RGO CE is the smallest than other CEs. This makes the diffusion rate of the triiodide quicker. Therefore, D of Co3O4@RGO is large and prompts Jlim of Co3O4@RGO to have a large value in turn. Furthermore, the Co3O4@RGO has the minimal Rct. This is the reason why Co3O4@RGO has the highest value of J0.34

Fig. 7 shows J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with different CEs. Table 1 lists the photovoltaic parameters. Owing to the structural constraints, Co3O4 NFs show an extremely low photovoltaic performance (PCE = 1.20%) with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.66 V, a fill factor (FF) of 24.47% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.43 mA cm−2. The introduction of RGO nanosheets into Co3O4 NFs leads to a significant performance boost; Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids produce a Voc of 0.79 V, a FF of 61.54% and a Jsc of 11.91 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.79%, which is about 5 times that of Co3O4 NF and up to 94% of the Pt CE (6.16%). Due to a lower FF of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids than that of Pt, the PCE of the former is smaller than the latter.

In Fig. 8, similar to that of Pt, CV cures of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids reveal obvious redox peaks (Ox 1/Red 1), which can be described by the reaction in eqn (1). I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(3)

It can be noted that Co3O4@RGO has a peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of 0.41 V, which is higher than that of Pt CE (Epp = 0.29 V), indicating that Co3O4@RGO possesses relatively slow kinetic reduction capability. This is one reason that causes Co3O4@RGO to have a relatively low FF.35,36 However, compared with Co3O4 NF and RGO, the electrocatalytic ability of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids has a quite large advance. RGO gives an Epp of 0.53 V, which is higher than that of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids. Co3O4 NF shows the highest Epp, which is more than 0.8 V. Meanwhile, RGO has weak redox peaks; Co3O4 NF exhibits much more weak peaks. The cathodic peak current densities (Ipc) indicate the catalytic abilities of the electrodes for triiodide reduction in DSSCs. For RGO, the Ipc value (1.03 mA cm−2) is obtained, which is higher than that of the Co3O4 electrode (0.34 mA cm−2). Upon combining RGO with Co3O4 NF, Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids possess the highest intensity (2.39 mA cm−2), which is also higher than that of Pt (1.96 mA cm−2), indicating that Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids have a better electrocatalytic ability.37
The high performance of Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids can also be reflected by CV measurements. In Fig. 9, 15 cycles of CV curves of Co3O4 NF and Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids are shown. It is obvious that no apparent change in peaks is observed for Co3O4@RGO nanohybrids, indicating that the Co3O4@RGO nanohybrid CE is more stable for catalyzing triiodides than Co3O4 NF.38

4. Conclusions
In summary, this study offers a facile method to prepare 2D porous Co3O4 NF. Meanwhile, on account of the structural constraints of the nanoflakes, we introduced RGO nanosheets into 2D porous Co3O4 NFs to improve the performance as CEs in DSSCs. The Co3O4@RGO nanohybrid gives a PCE (5.79%), which is about 5 times that of Co3O4 NF (1.20%). Furthermore, CV tests demonstrate that the introduction of RGO nanosheets also improves the stability performance for catalyzing triiodides and has a relatively better electrochemical rate for the oxidation reduction reaction. This work gives an idea to utilize the advantage and avoid the disadvantage of 2D nanoflakes. Meanwhile, the experimental result develops a good alternative CE material in oxide and thus may open a window for potential applications in DSSCs and any other related fields.
