    , Accepted 9th December 2015First published on 10th December 2015AbstractWe have demonstrated organometallic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on Au decorated TiO2 nanofibers and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). A power conversion efficiency of 14.92% was achieved, which is significantly higher than that of conventional mesoporous (mp) TiO2, as well as TiO2 nanofiber-based devices. The present synthetic process provides new opportunities for the development of efficient plasmonic PSCs based on metal oxide nanofibers. Solar cells based on these architectures exhibit a short-circuit current density JSC of 21.63 ± 0.36 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.986 ± 0.01 V and fill factor of 70% ± 3%, which provide a power conversion efficiency of 14.92% ± 0.33% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. The results of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy and solid-state impedance spectroscopy (ssIS) revealed that PSCs based on Au-decorated TiO2 nanofibers exhibit a low recombination rate. The present results are much higher than those for reported PSCs based on a Au@TiO2 electron-transporting layer (ETL).
Introduction
Recently, organometallic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have opened new approaches towards efficient and stable solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSC). A blocking TiO2 (Bl-TiO2) layer, mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2), organometallic halide perovskite sensitizers (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), a hole-transporting material (HTM) (spiro-MeOTAD) and a counter electrode (Au) are the key components of a PSC.1 Optimization of the stoichiometry of perovskite and its deposition and the uniformity and thickness of each layer are the key factors of the experimental process for achieving good efficiency. After the breakthrough in efficiency reported by Gratzel et al. (2013) and Snaith et al.,1–3 extensive study has been started once again into dye-sensitized perovskite solar cells.2–8 However, the efficiency of such solar cells varies (9% to 15%) between researchers.9 Several researchers used different device configurations and different organometallic halides for the improvement of power conversion efficiency [Cl, Br and I]. Moreover, hybrid perovskite has recently been synthesized with tuning of the band gap [CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx].10 Recently, Seok et al. reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.1% based on formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskites.11
It is well known that organometallic trihalide (I, Cl and Br) perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, herein referred to as MAPbI3, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, herein referred to as MAPbICl, and CH3NH3SnI3, herein referred to as lead-free perovskite) are of great interest in sensitized solar cells and these materials display excellent photon conversion efficiency that exceeds 15%.2–4 Moreover, these materials have excellent electronic properties with solution-based processability.
Recently, a few reports have been available on perovskite solar cells based on Al2O3,12 NiO,13 ZnO14 and graphene/TiO2.15 Moreover, a few reports have been available based on rutile TiO2 nanorods16 and anatase nanotubes.17 Recently, we have synthesized MAPbI3 perovskite nanoparticles from a γ-butyrolactone (GBL) solvent and successfully employed them in low-temperature-processed 1D TiO2 nanorod arrays with a PCE of 13.45%.18,19 Furthermore, zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) nanofibers have been used and displayed a PCE of 7.38%.20 Therefore, the fabrication of perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanofibers opens a new approach to efficient PSCs. Furthermore, it is also well known that metal nanoparticles (NPs) have a very high absorption coefficient and scattering cross-sections, which can be tailored throughout the visible region to the near infrared (NIR) by varying their size and shape. These nanoparticle films are created via a fast, scalable, electrostatic self-assembly method that provides well-defined inter-particle distances. These optically homogeneous films absorb up to 37% of incident photons at the respective surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelengths. The spectral photocurrent response of the solar cells closely follows the absorption spectrum of the metal NP layers. TiO2 nanofibers facilitate direct pathways for the rapid collection of photogenerated electrons, which could improve the photovoltaic performance of the device. Recently, Snaith et al. used Au@SiO2 and Ag@TiO2 NPs in PSC and obtained PCEs of 11.4% and 16.3%, respectively.21a,b Chander et al. studied Au–TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with CsSnI3 as a hole-transporting material (HTM) and obtained a PCE of ∼4.2%.21c However, these reports are very different from the current investigation.
Herein, we report an in situ synthesis method of Au-embedded TiO2 nanofibers by an electrospinning technique to enable plasmon-enhanced generation of charge in PSC. SPR from metallic nanostructures can provide significant control over the optical field and the prospective utilization of metallic nanostructures may enhance the absorption of light in TiO2 nanofibers and perovskite. Therefore, PSC is attracting mounting interest towards efficient building photovoltaic (BIPV) technology.
Results and discussion
The PSCs fabricated in the present study are composed of an Au@TiO2 nanofibers/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD heterojunction, which is deposited on a FTO substrate and a thermally deposited gold electrode. Fig. 1(a) presents a cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of the fabricated perovskite device. The appropriate thickness of each layer confirms that the device is optimized, with a layer of 300 nm of Au@TiO2 with perovskite and an HTM layer of 200 nm. The highly magnified FESEM image shows that perovskite materials well covered the surface of Au@TiO2 nanofibers. The formation of phase-pure MAPbI3 was optimized by non-washing and washing treatment with MAI followed by XRD analysis‡ (ESI Fig. S1(a)†). Our results indicated that the sample that was recrystallized from diethyl ether and annealed at 110 °C has a pure tetragonal phase with high crystallinity (ESI Fig. S1(b)†). The deposition of perovskite onto the Au@TiO2 surface is confirmed by TEM (inset of Fig. 1(b)) with EDS elemental analysis (ESI Fig. S2†). HRTEM analysis confirms that the deposited Au@TiO2, as well as perovskite, is highly crystalline in nature (ESI Fig. S3 and S4†). The surface areas of bare TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers were measured to be ca. 35.5 and 22.8 m2 g−1, respectively, and were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S5.†

We also confirmed that the deposited perovskite was uniformly distributed throughout the surface of Au@TiO2 nanofibers by performing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with elemental mapping via energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) (ESI Fig. S2†). The results of FESEM show that the perovskite material that was deposited onto the TiO2 surface is uniformly deposited (ESI Fig. S6†). After deposition of the HTM layer, islands that are several micrometers in size were covered onto the perovskite/Au@TiO2 layer (ESI Fig. S7†). This architecture facilitates excellent wettability of the HTM layer and perovskite. Optimization of the thickness of the HTM layer has a strong effect on the FF as well as the current density (JSC) of the devices. Moreover, we optimized the thickness of the HTM film and varied the composition of HTM.
As described in the abovementioned configuration, Au@TiO2 facilitates enhancements in the improvement of JSC and VOC as well as FF. It is also beneficial in the improvement of results of electron lifetime via a reduced recombination rate. To evaluate the effect of Au NP in perovskite solar cells, we have prepared Au-decorated TiO2 nanofibers via an electrospinning technique and used them as an ETL.

Fig. 1(c) shows a schematic of a PSC based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers. In a solar cell, the Fermi level of Au NPs contacts that of the semiconductor due to the balance of electron density on the surface. The energy level, E, which refers to the expected value of the dipole induced by surface plasmon resonance, is governed by the work function of Au NPs. SPR of gold NPs induces a dipole, which acts as an energy level to support the transition of photoelectrons. Photoelectrons are then transferred from the SPR level of the gold NP to the conduction band of the semiconductor. Photoelectrons are injected into the anode and are prevented from returning due to a Schottky barrier. Fig. 1(d) represents the energy level band diagram of a PSC based on Au@TiO2. In a basic PSC, when photonic energy illuminates this device, perovskite absorbing materials absorb the photons to generate electron–hole pair excitons. The excitons dissociate at the TiO2/perovskite interface. The dissociated electrons will flow towards the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to FTO, whereas holes travel through the HTM layer and reach the Au counter electrode. In the case of a PSC based on Au@TiO2, the excited electron–hole pairs from the perovskite/TiO2 interface as well as photons absorbed by Au metal NPs can easily transfer to the CB of TiO2. This phenomenon enhances the light-harvesting ability of perovskite solar cells via SPR of Au metal NPs. Plasmonic coupling between Au NPs promotes electron transfer into the CB of TiO2. In plasmonic solar cells, incorporated metal nanoparticles may play several roles: (i) to increase the harvesting of light owing to the strong near-field effects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR); (ii) the generation of hot electrons by surface plasmon excitation; and (iii) to act as sites for electron recombination.21a These factors can competitively have an impact on the performance of the device. Au NP-decorated TiO2 nanofibers provide an SPR effect and result in an improvement in light harvesting. Fig. 1(e) shows an image of the fabricated perovskite solar cell.
In Fig. 2a we show absorption spectra of bare TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers. A small plasmonic peak is observed at around 539 nm for the Au NPs,21a which indicates the successful production of Au NPs. Furthermore, TEM and STEM/EDS mapping show successful implantation of Au NPs on TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 2b and c).

A detailed mechanism of electron transfer and LSPR is presented in Fig. 3(a). In plasmonic solar cells, metal nanoparticles could enhance the absorption in the solar cell by either scattering light to enable a longer optical path length, by a dipole–dipole interaction and resonant energy transfer, or by near-field coupling between the surface plasmon polariton and the excited state of perovskite. First, the Au NPs generate localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which can enhance the absorption of light in the visible region. In the present case, we have used Au NPs-embedded TiO2 nanofibers for perovskite solar cells and the LSPR effect on the surface of Au provides additional electrons to TiO2 by a diffusion process. Herein, three mechanisms occur simultaneously. In the first mechanism, electrons from the LUMO of perovskite are transferred to the CB of TiO2via a tunnelling effect across Au NPs.22a In the second mechanism, excited electrons from perovskite are injected into Au NPs (not the excited SPR level of Au NPs), which leads to the accumulation of electrons in Au NPs. This causes an increase in their Fermi level to more negative potential until it matches the Fermi level of TiO2, whereupon a rapid transport of electrons from Au NPs to the CB of TiO2 occurs. In the present case, the Au NP–TiO2 interface acts as a Schottky barrier, which reduces electron recombination from the CB of TiO2 to the HOMO of perovskite.22b These electrons will further transfer to FTO to produce a photocurrent. In the third mechanism, in visible light, photon absorption induces a strong LSPR phenomenon at the Au–TiO2 interface, which enhances the generation of electron–hole pairs. The electrons generated by the LSPR effect diffuse into the CB of TiO2 nanofibers, which enhances the photocurrent in PSCs. However, the reverse transport of electrons from TiO2 to Au NPs is restricted by the Schottky barrier that is formed, which is denoted by red dotted arrows. This excited SPR-level state cannot accept or allow electrons. However, a more negative potential leads to a restriction of the back reaction from the SPR level to MAPbI3 or from the CB of TiO2 to the Fermi level by an SPR effect. Therefore, these excited electrons are transferred to the CB of TiO2. The holes that are generated in Au travel through the HTM to the counter electrode and undergo recombination. Moreover, the Au NPs facilitate spatial charge separation, which prevents the direct recombination of electrons and holes from TiO2 and the perovskite layer. This process further increases the PCE of Au@TiO2-based perovskite solar cells. However, in the case of a larger amount of Au NPs, this reduces electron transfer from perovskite to the CB of TiO2.22c The mechanism of electron generation and transformation can be represented, as shown in Fig. 3(b). To study the effect on devices processed in situ based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers, we added various amounts of HAuCl4·3H2O to the TiO2-PVP precursor and deposited Au@TiO2 nanofibers. The wt% amount of Au NPs in TiO2 nanofibers varied from 0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%.

(c) J–V curves of Au@TiO2 nanofiber-based perovskite solar cells at various wt% concentrations of Au. 
Furthermore, we studied the effect of various wt% of Au NPs in TiO2 on PSCs.22dFig. 3c shows J–V plots of perovskite solar cells based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers. The wt% of Au varied from 0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%. More details are given in the Experimental section. PSC devices that were based on 0.1 wt% Au@TiO2 nanofibers exhibited VOC = 0.853 V, JSC = 19.62 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.6, leading to a PCE of 10.04%. The sample that was fabricated from 0.2 wt% Au@TiO2 displayed a PCE of 11.74% with VOC = 0.915 V, JSC = 20.06 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.64. In the case of the device based on 0.3 wt% Au@TiO2, this exhibited a PCE of 14.37% with VOC = 0.986 V, JSC = 20.83 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.70. This increase may be due to the plasmonic effect of Au NPs in TiO2 nanofibers. For samples with an further increase to 0.4 wt% and 0.5 wt% Au@TiO2, PCEs of 12.38% and 9.52% were exhibited. Moreover, it is also noted that the fill factor of both samples displays a slight decrease compared with the values of JSC and VOC. The larger amount of Au NPs reduces electron transfer from perovskite to the CB of TiO2 and provides recombination centres; therefore, the FF of devices with both 0.4 wt% and 0.5 wt% Au was drastically decreased. Table 1 presents the solar cell parameters of the best optimized plasmonic devices.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices with and without Au NPs were investigated in the dark and under a solar irradiance of AM 1.5G. The solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 4(a) presents typical J–V plots of optimized devices based on TiO2 nanofibers (pink triangles) and Au@TiO2 nanofibers (violet circles). By controlling all the optimized parameters for nanofibers based on 0.3 wt% Au@TiO2, the current density that was exhibited was increased from 19.14 mA cm−2 to 21.63 mA cm−2 with VOC = 0.986 V and FF = 0.70. The total power conversion efficiency (η) of the device based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers was 14.92%. This increase was due to the plasmonic effect of Au nanoparticles on TiO2. The plasmonic coupling between Au NPs promotes electron transfer into TiO2. It was also found that the value of VOC increased for a perovskite solar cell based on Au@TiO2. From the dark J–V curve it is observed that the dark current decreased for the Au@TiO2 sample, which indicates an increase in the value of VOC. To understand the role of the ETL in detail, we recorded the dark current of each device, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The dark current indicates the charge recombination behavior of the PSC. The J–V curve of the device based on bare TiO2 nanofibers measured in the dark shows an onset of the dark current at ∼0.550 V, whereas in the case of the device based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers the onset shifts to over 0.755 V, which indicates a reduction in the reverse flow of electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to perovskite or the hole-transfer material owing to spatial charge separation caused by LSPR. This may lead to an increase in the open-circuit potential. Similarly, in the present case, the value of VOC of the device based on Au@TiO2 has increased from 0.853 V to 0.986 V. From Fig. 3(a), it is clear that the PSC based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers exhibited a much lower dark current density compared with the PSC based on bare TiO2 nanofibers. Therefore, it is clear that the charge recombination rate for the device based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers is much lower than for that based on bare nanofibers. Au NPs enable the suppression of charge recombination, which restricts the reverse reaction from FTO/Au@TiO2 nanofibers to the perovskite layer and spiro-MeOTAD. This suppression of charge directly affects the values of VOC and JSC of the device; therefore, the values of VOC and JSC of the PSC based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers increased from 0.953 V to 0.986 V and 19.52 mA cm−2 to 21.63 mA cm−2, respectively.

To confirm this, we measured the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the fabricated devices. Fig. 4(b) shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the respective devices as a function of the wavelength. The IPCE spectra would provide detailed information on the effective light-harvesting capability of the perovskite-based solar cells. Both devices show that the generation of photocurrent starts at ∼800 nm, which is in agreement with the band gap of MAPbI3. The Au@TiO2 nanofiber sample exhibits an IPCE of 93%, whereas the sample based on bare TiO2 nanofibers displays an IPCE of 80% in the visible spectrum.
The values of JSC were estimated using the following IPCE equation:23,24 (1)
The calculated values of JSC were 16.50 mA cm−2 and 20.13 mA cm−2 for perovskite devices based on TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers, respectively. The slightly lower current density that was obtained from IPCE measurements compared with that from the J–V curves can probably be attributed to surface trapping by the TiO2 transporting layer. To further investigate the stability and reproducibility of the fabricated perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanofibers and Au-decorated TiO2 nanofibers, we fabricated a number of devices under the same conditions. Fig. 4(c and d) shows histograms of the average power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. In general, >75% of devices exhibited a PCE of >11% and >14% for bare TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers, respectively. Devices based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers exhibited superior PCE with lower deviation. These results demonstrate that our developed method is promising and reproducible.
Elemental analyses of the prepared device based on FTO/Au@TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au were carried out using cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and elemental mapping (ESI Fig. S9†). EDS mapping of the elements confirmed that the perovskite + Au@TiO2 contained Ti, O, Au, Pb, and I. It was also noted that the atomic wt% ratio of Pb to I was ∼1:3, which confirms the stoichiometry of the deposited MAPbI3 material. The elemental composition displays excellent stoichiometry throughout the surface. For a further in-depth investigation of the atomic ratios and band bending in TiO2, Au NP and MAPbI3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed (ESI Fig. S9†). Full XPS spectra of the MAPbI3/TiO2 nanofibers (pink line) and MAPbI3/Au@TiO2 nanofibers (violet line) are presented in Fig. S9a.† Ti 2p, O 1s, Au 4f, Pb 4f and I 3d core energy-level spectra are shown in Fig. S9(b–f),† respectively. The presence of Au NPs can be observed via the XPS peaks of Au 4f at 82.59 and 86.23 eV, which are attributed to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively. Both the peak positions and spin splitting of 3.64 eV are characteristic of metallic gold (Fig. S9d†). A highly magnified cross-sectional FESEM image shows that the HTM layer displays good penetration with the active layer of perovskite and Au@TiO2. The compactness of the HTM layer facilitates excellent extraction of holes from the perovskite active layer and transfer to the counter electrode.
For comparison, we also prepared PSCs based on mp-TiO2 and Au@mp-TiO2. The device based on standard commercial mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) (18-DNR, Dyesol) displayed a short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) of 19.14 mA cm−2, 0.835 V, 0.58 and 9.23%, respectively. The device based on Au–TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited values of JSC = 18.39 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.795 V, and FF = 0.49, leading to η = 7.16% [ESI Fig. S10a†]. However, this is lower efficiency compared with bare mp-TiO2 samples. This may be due to the direct addition of HAuCl4·3H2O to a standard TiO2/ethanol solution. Therefore, we again synthesized Au NPs using a standard chemical procedure.22e More details are mentioned in the Experimental section. The diameters (d) of particles, which ranged from 35 to 100 nm, can thus be calculated from the position of the absorption peak according to the following eqn (2): (2)where λspr is the wavelength of the absorption peak and the values of λ0, L1 and L2 were taken from the previous literature for a particle size of >25 nm.22d The calculated particle size of Au NPs was about 58 nm in diameter with an absorption peak at ∼535 nm. The inset of Fig. 5a shows well-dispersed Au NPs in an ethanol solvent. Furthermore, the particle size of the synthesized Au NPs was confirmed by TEM analysis. Fig. 5(b–d) shows the TEM analysis of Au NPs and the TEM micrograph of a single Au NP is highly consistent with optical data. The desired amount of these Au NPs was dispersed in mp-TiO2/ethanol paste and spin-coated on a FTO substrate. Annealed FTO/Au@mp-TiO2 electrodes were used for the fabrication of a solar cell. The device based on TiO2 nanofibers exhibited values of JSC = 19.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.953 V, and FF = 0.60, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.16% (Fig. S10b†).

From the abovementioned results, we conclude that the increase in current density may be attributed not only to an increase in the excitation of perovskite by the effects of LSPR associated with near-field enhancement and scattering, but also to the generation of additional photocurrent owing to the LSPR-induced direct transfer of hot electrons from plasmonic structures to the conduction band of TiO2. The FF of the device based on Au@TiO2 displayed a drastic increase from 0.58 to 0.70, which may be due to the low recombination rate compared with bare samples. The architecture of the device based on Au@TiO2, which comprised highly crystalline TiO2 nanofibers, provides low grain boundaries, which result in rapid electron transport. Moreover, the nanofibers provide an effective large surface area and the excellent pore filling of the HTM layer results in low interfacial resistance. We optimized the thickness of the HTM layer with the help of the spin-coating speed (ESI Table S1†). From Table S1† it is clear that the values of FF as well as JSC of the PSC based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers drastically increased compared with those of bare samples, which is due to a decrease in the recombination rate. This architecture facilitates a high current density as well as FF.22 The optimized best performances of the devices exhibit conversion efficiencies of 11.16% and 14.92% for bare TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers, respectively.
The hysteresis behavior of the fabricated devices was studied with a scanning delay of 40 ms in forward and reverse-scan mode. Fig. 6 shows J–V curves that were recorded under forward and reverse-bias conditions. Table 3 summarizes the calculated JSC, VOC and FF parameters. The forward scan provided values of VOC = 0.898 V, JSC = 18.57 mA cm−2, and FF = 59% with η = 9.83%. The reverse scan exhibited a drastic increase in η, up to 11.16% (VOC = 0.953 V, JSC = 19.52 mA cm−2, and FF = 60%). On the other hand, a PSC based on Au-decorated TiO2 nanofibers exhibited values of PCE = 12.24% and 14.92% for the forward and reverse scan, respectively. The main cause of the increase in PCE is the values of FF and JSC. The forward scan of the cell based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers provided values of VOC = 0.951 V, JSC = 20.16 mA cm−2, and FF = 64%, leading to a PCE of 12.27%. The reverse scan exhibited an increase in PCE to 14.92%, with VOC = 0.986 V, JSC = 21.63 mA cm−2 and FF = 70%. From the hysteresis study, it is clear that the hysteresis tolerance in Au@TiO2 nanofibers is much less than in a PSC based on bare TiO2 nanofibers. The effects of the nanofiber diameter, compact deposition and thickness of the photoelectrodes may be helpful for avoiding this hysteresis issue.

To investigate the effect of Au NP in PSC in detail, we obtained optical absorption spectra as well as photoluminescence spectra of samples of perovskite solar cells. Fig. 7(a) presents the UV-Vis spectra and photoluminescence (PL) response of electrodes based on perovskite/TiO2 nanofibers and perovskite/Au@TiO2 nanofibers. At a glance, it is clear that there is no significant change in the absorption coefficient between samples of perovskite/Au@TiO2 nanofibers and bare nanofibers. This may be due to the small amount of Au metal NPs loaded on TiO2 nanofibers and the higher absorption coefficient of perovskite film compared with Au metal nanoparticles. The increase in photocurrent density and reduced recombination rate were further explained by PL quenching. PL measurements reveal that the intensity of the emission peak at 775 nm was drastically reduced for the Au@TiO2 sample owing to the influence of Au metal NPs, which quench PL at room temperature. This PL quenching indicates that the rate of charge recombination is reduced drastically in Au@TiO2 nanofibers. We suggest that the better separation of charge carrier, which has been observed in a progressive manner from as-deposited nanofibers to Au@TiO2 nanofibers, is due to reduced grain boundaries between TiO2 and perovskite and a defect-free interface between the Au@TiO2 nanofibers and perovskite, which is further enhanced by Au nanoparticles.13 It is well known that PL quenching is caused by rapid charge transfer at interfaces. Therefore, Au NPs are helpful for rapid charge transport, enhanced photocurrent in the device and improvements in the ability for charge generation and collection. To study the dynamics of electron lifetimes between the devices, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the TRPL spectroscopic analysis of perovskite electrodes based on TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers. TRPL measurements are useful for quantitative information on the yield of light-induced charge separation. The TiO2/perovskite samples exhibited a time constant of τe = 6.53 ns, whereas the Au@TiO2 nanofibers exhibited a value of τe = 16.53 ns. It is well known that the longer lifetime of charge carriers that is observed with devices based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers indicates a much lower defect concentration. The higher electron lifetime is responsible for the low recombination rate. In the present investigation, we have prepared Au NPs-decorated TiO2 nanofibers, wherein the Au NPs facilitate a higher optical near-field effect, which results in a higher photocurrent. These devices based on Au@TiO2 have additional electrons owing to Au metal NPs. These additional electrons fill some of the trap sites in the TiO2 nanofibers so that the number of available trap states might have been reduced, which can lead to reduced recombination. The increase in photocurrent density is likely to be in part related to the rapid transport rate, associated with the efficiency of charge collection. Owing to the significant decrease in the recombination rate, the time constant increases dramatically in Au@TiO2 compared with perovskite devices based on bare TiO2.

The right-hand side shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the respective samples. Excitation was at 532 nm using a Nd-YAG laser. (b) Transient PL decay profiles obtained at 775 nm upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation at λ = 470 nm. 
To study transient properties, we carried out the solid-state impedance spectroscopy (ssIS) technique. The ssIS method can be used to separate processes that occur on different characteristic timescales in solar cells, such as carrier conductivity, recombination resistance, and chemical capacitance.25,26 The ssIS analyses were performed in the dark on these devices to further understand the effect of Au nanoparticles. Fig. 8(a) presents a Nyquist plot measured at a voltage bias of 0.9 V. Usually, a Nyquist plot for DSSCs shows two distinct semicircles at lower and higher frequencies. The first semicircle at high frequencies is attributed to charge transfer resistance at the gold back contact and the second semicircle at low frequencies is attributed to charge transfer resistance between TiO2/FTO and the hole-conductor or perovskite absorber. In conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, the second semicircle arises due to an electron back-reaction from the conduction band of TiO2 or FTO to the redox mediator.27,28 However, in the present case, the semicircle that occurs at high frequencies vanishes for both nanofiber-based perovskite devices. In other words, the absence of transmission line (TL) behavior, which arises from electron transport resistance, is likely due to the very thin TiO2 films that were employed.27 Consequently, the low electron transport resistance does not allow the adequate resolution of any TL feature. It is also well known that the value of Rrec is inversely proportional to electron recombination. Therefore, the simplified circuit model shown in Fig. 8(c) represents the case in which no TL is observed. In the solar cell with the perovskite absorber, the dominant pathway of electron loss is the recombination of electrons from the titanium dioxide film to the hole conductor.29,30

(Note: the impedance spectra were obtained in the dark at different biasing potentials with intervals of 0.05 V.) (c) Equivalent-circuit model employed for the impedance analysis of the perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers. (d) Open-circuit voltage decay measurements. The inset shows the electron lifetimes calculated from OCVD measurements. 
This recombination lowers the steady-state electron density in the TiO2 film, which affects the open-circuit potential of the device. The impedance semicircle corresponds to the internal resistance of the TiO2/perovskite absorbing layer interface. The diameter of the semicircle for Au@TiO2 nanofibers is smaller than that for devices based on bare TiO2 nanofiber, which indicates a slower recombination rate and smaller internal resistance. The Au@TiO2 nanofiber ETL possesses superior charge-injection characteristics. Similar behaviour has been observed in measurements of the dark current during IS analysis (ESI Fig. S11†). In this equivalent-circuit model (Fig. 8(c)), the high-frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plots is attributed to the diffusion of holes through the HTM, which is modelled by HTM resistance, RHTM, in parallel with HTM capacitance, CHTM. The lower-frequency semicircle is attributed to recombination resistance, Rrec, in parallel with chemical capacitance, Cμ, which is related to the electron Fermi level in TiO2.
To understand the effect of Au NPs on TiO2 nanofibers on improved photovoltaic performance, measurements of photovoltage decay were performed to investigate the charge transport and recombination properties of the perovskite photoelectrodes based on TiO2 and Au@TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 8(d)). The electron lifetimes (τn) could be derived from the photovoltage decay curve according to previous reports.31,32Fig. 8(d) shows photovoltage decay plots and electron lifetimes as a function of photovoltage (inset). It is observed that the photovoltage of the Au@TiO2 nanofiber electrode decays slower than that of the bare TiO2 nanofiber electrode, which also displays a longer electron lifetime at equal potentials. The decreased electron lifetime of the bare TiO2 nanofiber electrode means a higher charge recombination rate and lower charge collection efficiency than those of the Au@TiO2 nanofiber electrode. These results indicate that the enhancement of perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanofibers is attributed to both enhanced light absorption and reduced charge recombination. It is well known that solar cells based on MAPbI3/perovskite are quite unstable in a liquid electrolyte but in contrast are much more stable in a solid-state configuration based on a spiro-MeOTAD HTM. Fig. 9 shows the stability in air of the fabricated perovskite devices. For the evaluation of device stability, we stored the devices in a Petri dish covered with Al foil in air at room temperature without encapsulation. The values of VOC and JSC of both devices were stable up to 300 h and slight decreases were observed thereafter. However, the stability of these devices can be improved by encapsulation. Moreover, it is noted that the FF of the Au@TiO2 nanofiber-based device is more stable than that of the bare nanofiber-based device. Therefore, the efficiency of both devices decreases after 300 h. Overall, it is observed that perovskite solar cells based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers are much more stable. This might be due to the low degradation of MAPbI3 perovskites. However, after certain hours, both our devices exhibit lower efficiency. This might be due to Au NPs; however, at the moment, this type of behavior is not clearly understood. This study is under way in our laboratory.

Conclusions
In summary, PSCs based on TiO2 nanofibers and Au@TiO2 nanofibers ETLs have been successfully demonstrated, which display improved photovoltaic performance. This improvement is not only applicable to the enhancement of light absorption, but also contributes to reduced charge recombination in Au@TiO2 nanofiber electrodes, which suggests that Au@TiO2 nanofibers could be a promising ETL layer to improve efficiency further. Encouraging photovoltaic performance with a photocurrent density of 21.63 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 14.92% was demonstrated for PSCs based on Au@TiO2 nanofibers. We suggest that the present method is an alternative method of synthesizing ETL layers for plasmonic perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
First, laser-patterned, FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC15, Pilkington) were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline aqueous washing solution, rinsed with deionized water, ethanol and acetone, and subjected to treatment with O3 for 30 min. A 20–40 nm thick compact layer of TiO2 was then deposited on the substrates by spin-coating of 0.15 M and 0.3 M commercial solutions of titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39 volume ratio) as a precursor and subsequently annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 500 °C for 20 min.
Deposition of mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer
A layer of mp-TiO2 composed of particles with a size of 20 nm was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 15 s using commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol (2:7 weight ratio). For the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles, HAuCl4·3H2O was directly added to the mp-TiO2 solution and spin-coated on a FTO/Bl-TiO2 substrate. After drying at 125 °C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 °C, baked at this temperature for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. However, this method is not convenient for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles with mp-TiO2. Therefore, we have followed the method of synthesizing Au nanoparticles.22
Synthesis of Au@mp-TiO2 electrodes
Initially, Au NPs were synthesized by a chemical route. In typical experiments, a 1 mM aqueous solution of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) was boiled for 30 min under reflux. About 2.5 mL of a 1% w/w aqueous solution of trisodium citrate dihydrate was added simultaneously under magnetic stirring over a period of 20 min. The obtained clear red solution was slowly cooled to room temperature. About 2.5 mL of a 5% solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in deionized water was added to the abovementioned red solution and further stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min and the synthesized Au NP dispersed in ethanol. The desired amount of this solution of Au NP was mixed with commercial mp-TiO2/ethanol paste and spin-coated onto a FTO/Bl-TiO2 substrate. After drying at 125 °C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 °C, baked at this temperature for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. The film with deposited mp-TiO2 and Au@mp-TiO2 was again treated with TiCl4.
Deposition of TiO2 nanofibers

Chemicals and materials. 
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (PVP K90, MW = 130000), ethanol (Daejung), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4, Junsei) and acetic acid (Kanto Chemical) were used as initial precursors for the deposition of nanofibers. All these chemicals were used without further purification.


Preparation of TiO2 feeding solution. 
In a typical experiment, 3 g PVP was dissolved in 27 g ethanol under vigorous stirring. Then, a 6 mL solution of Ti(OiPr)4 was dissolved in an equal volume of acetic acid and ethanol. These two solutions were kept separately for constant stirring for 24 h. The clear solution of Ti(OiPr)4 was mixed with the ethanolic solution of PVP drop by drop and finally stirred for a further 5 h to obtain a colloidal solution.33


Preparation of TiO2 and Au@TiO2 nanofibers. 
The abovementioned prepared electrospinning solution was carefully sucked into a 5 mL glass syringe and fixed horizontally arranged electrospinning equipment (SGE Analytical Science). The positive electrode was connected to the needle of the syringe containing the precursor solution. The drum rotating speed (400 rpm) and the distance between the anode and cathode (15 cm) were kept constant. The spinning rate was kept at 1.0 mL h−1 by a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific). For the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles, HAuCl4·3H2O was added to the electrospinning solutions and the solutions were then instantly loaded into a syringe. Au-embedded TiO2 nanofibers of different compositions were synthesized by the addition of various amounts of HAuCl4·3H2O to the TiO2-PVP precursor solution at loading ratios of 0.1 wt% to 0.6 wt%. In this investigation, we added different quantities of a solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (0.0042, 0.0084, 0.0126, 0.0168, 0.0210, and 0.0252 g) to 3 mL TiO2-PVP precursor solution to deposit TiO2 nanofibers. These nanofibers were further used for perovskite solar cells and new results for Au nanoparticles versus TiO2 nanofibers have been added in a revised manuscript. At this point, an electric field potential of 9 kV was applied between the needle tip and a grounded substrate at a distance of 15 cm. Finally, after heat treatment at 500 °C for 3 h in air, reflective white and bluish Au-embedded TiO2 nanofibers (Au@TiO2 nanofibers) were obtained (ESI Fig. S12†). The temperature of thermal annealing was optimized by TGA analysis (ESI Fig. S13†). The crystallinity and composition of the nanofibers were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS mapping analysis (ESI Fig. S14, Fig. S15, and Fig. S16†). A paste of synthesized bare and Au@TiO2 nanofibers was prepared using terpineol and ethyl cellulose in an ethanol solvent and used for spin-coating.


Preparation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). 
Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by the dropwise addition of hydriodic acid (aqueous, 57 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) to a solution of methylamine (aqueous, 40 wt%, TCI Chemicals) in an ice bath. The ice-cold solution was stirred for 2 h and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (95 mbar vacuum, 400 rpm rotation). The white product was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized using diethyl ether.19 Fresh white crystals were washed three times using diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum for 24 h. The resulting white solid product was further used for the synthesis of MAPbI3.
The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of MAI and lead iodide (PbI2) (Aldrich, 99.999%) in anhydrous γ-butyrolactone (40% by weight, Sigma-Aldrich) at 70 °C and stirred for 12 h. The prepared yellow solution was further filtered twice using a syringe filter (Whatman GD/X PVDF, pore size 0.45 μm). The clear yellow solution was dripped on top of a mp-TiO2 film and the film was soaked for 1 min and then spun at 2000 rpm for 45 s and 3000 rpm for 45 s at one ramp rate. The film was placed on a hotplate at 95 °C for 10 min to form dark brown crystalline MAPbI3.34 We investigated and optimized the best performance based on measurements from thermogravimetric analysis (ESI Fig. S17†).
The hole-transport material (HTM) was prepared by a standard procedure reported elsewhere with a few modifications.2,20,35 A total of 180 mg 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Merck) was dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich) with the addition of 37.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg mL−1) in acetonitrile and 17.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich). (Please note that HTM is not stable for a long time; therefore, we prepared a fresh solution of HTM before each experiment.) The MAPbI3 + TiO2 composite films were coated with HTM solution using a spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30s. We took precautions for proper pore filling. Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. For the counter electrode, an 80 nm thick layer of Au was deposited on the top of the HTM overlayer by thermal evaporation (growth rate ∼0.5 Å s−1). For comparison, we also prepared and characterized devices based on commercial P25 paste and Au@TiO2 (ESI Fig. S18, Fig. S19 and Fig. S20†). An XRD analysis of mp-TiO2 deposited on glass and FTO substrate is shown in Fig. S21.† The active areas of all devices were 0.09 cm2 and measured without masking.
