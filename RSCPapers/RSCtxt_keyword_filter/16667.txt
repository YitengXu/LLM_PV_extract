    , Accepted 10th July 2012First published on 10th July 2012AbstractWe report on the synthesis and characterization of a donor–acceptor ruthenium polypyridyl complex as a photosensitizer for p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The electrochemical, photophysical, and photovoltaic performance of two ruthenium-based photosensitizers were tested in NiO-based DSSCs; bis-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)2N-(1,10-phenanthroline)-4-nitronaphthalene-1,8-dicarboximide ruthenium(II), ([Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)](PF6)2) and tris-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)3 ruthenium(II), [(Ru(dcb)3)Cl2]. The presence of an electron-accepting group, 4-nitronaphthalene-1,8-dicarboximide (NMI), attached to the phenanthroline of [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ resulted in long-lived charge separation between reduced [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ and NiO valence band holes; 10–50 μs. In the reduced state for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+, the electron localized on the distal NMI group. In tests with I3−/I− and Co(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-bipyridine)32+/3+ electrolytes, [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ outperformed [Ru(dcb)3]2+ in solar cell efficiency in devices. A record APCE (25%) was achieved for a ruthenium photosensitizer in a p-type DSSC. Insights on photosensitizer regeneration kinetics are included.
Introduction
For the last two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been an increasingly large sector of research focussed on the capture and conversion of solar energy into electrical and chemical potential.1–3 The long-studied topic made a massive leap in both efficiency and research interest with the discovery by O'Regan and Grätzel4 in 1991. They succeeded in converting light to electrical power with a good efficiency using a nanocrystalline n-type semiconductor coupled with a photosensitizing ruthenium dye. The mechanism consists of electron injection from the ruthenium dye to the semiconductor conduction band. Since Grätzel's report, many studies have followed to characterize and improve n-type DSSCs.5,6
More recently, a handful of groups have turned their attention to the complementary process on p-type semiconductors where hole injection into the valence band of the semiconductor results from light absorption by the photosensitizer, in contrast to electron injection into n-type semiconductors.7–10 Together, these processes can be combined into one system to produce a tandem cell with the capabilities surpassing the Shockley–Queisser limit.11,12 For tandem cells to become a reality, the p-type and n-type half-cell processes should be comparable in photocurrent. Currently, n-type DSSCs are several times more efficient than their p-type counterparts, putting the impetus on increasing the efficiency of the p-type cells.
The most efficient p-type DSSCs have been fabricated using mesoporous NiO material. Although improvements have been measured,13 these cells are plagued with low efficiency values, partly due to rapid (ps) recombination of the semiconductor hole with the reduced dye.13 To overcome this fundamental obstacle in the p-type system, work has been done to increase the lifetime of the reduced dye and semiconductor hole. Previous work has shown an increase in lifetime with chromophores that localize the excess electron farther away from the semiconductor surface.8,11,14 Significantly longer charge separation can be achieved in dyes with charge transfer (CT) character, the longest being with weakly coupled, separate acceptor units. The latter have been long-lived enough to allow the use of redox couples other than I3−/I−,15,16 most notably cobalt polypyridine complexes that have recently given breakthrough results in TiO2 DSSCs and could then allow extension to tandem cells with CoIII/II.17,18
Ruthenium polypyridine complexes are interesting in this regard, as they have intrinsic CT character. They also have rather broad absorption bands and offer tunability of the ligands for further optimization. Ruthenium dyes as photosensitizers have been reported for p-type DSSCs, but with modest results.19 This study presents a p-type DSSC utilizing a Ru-based photosensitizer with an appended acceptor group, 4-nitro-naphthalene-1,8-dicarboximide (NMI). Similar to the study using organic dyes, increased DSSC efficiencies were observed with this photosensitizer-acceptor dyad and a CoIII/II electrolyte compared with cells fabricated using a model ruthenium polypyridyl complex. Complementary kinetic studies were performed to identify processes that improve or compromise efficiency in the cells. A combination of faster regeneration rates and decreased recombination rates resulted in the increased efficiency for the sensitizer containing an appended electron acceptor group. We present evidence that suggests recombination with Ru-based sensitizers on NiO is intrinsically slower than with simple organic dyes.20–22
Experimental
General methods
Solvents and chemicals were 90% grade or higher and used without further purification. Preparative column chromatography was carried out using silica gel (Merck Kieselgel, silica gel 60, 0.063–0.200 mm).
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for 1H were acquired on JEOL Eclipse β 400 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were referenced to residual proton-solvent references (1H: CDCl3: 7.26 ppm, DMSO: 2.54 ppm).
Synthesis and characterization

2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid. 
4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (2 g, 13.8 mmol) was stirred in sulphuric acid (60 mL) at 70–80 °C. Potassium dichromate (13 g, 43.8 mmol) was added slowly over 2 h, maintaining the temperature between 70–80 °C with a ice bath. The mixture turned rapidly from a purple solution to green. Then, the mixture was poured over 300 mL of ice/water affording a light green precipitate. The precipitate was isolated by vacuum filtration. The solid was washed in water and refluxed in 50% conc. nitric acid (60 mL) for an additional 2 h. The cooled reaction mixture was poured onto ice water (500 mL). A white precipitate (3.0 g, 91%) was isolated and washed with water.

N-(1,10-Phenanthroline)-4-nitronaphthalene-1,8-dicarboximide (NMI). 
4-Nitronaphthalene-1,8-dicarboxyanhydride (374 mg, 1.54 mmol) and 5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline (300 mg, 1.54 mmol) were refluxed in ethanol 99.5% (50 mL) for 2 days. Petroleum ether at 0 °C was added to promote crystallization. After filtration, the filtrate is rinsed with a mixture of petroleum ether and cold ethanol to give the final compound without further purification.

Bis(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)2dichloro ruthenium(II), (Ru(dcb)2Cl2). 
2,2′-Bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (748 mg, 3.06 mmol), LiCl (130 mg, 3.06 mmol) and RuCl3 (425 mg, 1.50 mmol) are mixed together and refluxed in DMF (10 mL) for 2 days. The solution was cooled to room temperature and acetone (20 mL) was added to initiate recrystallization. The black powder (300 mg, 53%) which formed was used without further purification.

Ru(dcb)2Cl2 (200 mg, 0.3 mmol) and NMI (127 mg, 0.3 mmol) were added to a solvent mixture (4:1) acetic acid–water (20 mL) and put in a microwave reactor at 100 °C for 1.5 h. The solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by a silica gel chromatography column (acetonitrile–water–KNO3aq; 100:10:1). The counter ion was exchanged with PF6− by recrystallization with an aqueous solution of KPF6 to produce the correct complex (120 mg, 30%).

Electrochemistry
All electrochemical measurements were conducted in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, spectroscopic grade). Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using an Autolab potentiostat with a GPES electrochemical interface (Eco Chemie). The working electrode was a glassy carbon disc (diameter 3 mm, Alumina polished prior to use) with a non-aqueous Ag+/Ag reference electrode (CH Instruments, 0.01 M in AgNO3 in acetonitrile) and the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple in acetonitrile as an external standard. All solutions were prepared from dry acetonitrile in 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Fluka, electrochemical grade).
Photoelectrochemical characterization
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and current/voltage (I/V) measurements were performed as previously reported.8
Solar cells preparation
Preparation and assembly of the sandwich solar cells followed methods previously described.23 1 g NiCl2 anhydride and 1 g F108 polymer were dissolved in a mixture of 3 g of deionized water and 6 g of 99.5% of ethanol. The resulting green viscous solution was sonicated overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 3 hours to sediment out undissolved NiCl2 and amorphous NiO. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as three separate batches for use as doctor-blading paste. Mesoporous NiO electrodes were prepared by spreading the doctor-blading paste onto conducting F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass masked with adhesive tape and sintered in a furnace at 440 °C for 35 minutes.
After dyeing the mesoporous NiO electrodes in ethanolic solutions of each photosensitizer, solar cells were constructed by heat sealing the thermoplastic Surlyn between the NiO electrode and a pre-drilled platinised counter-electrode. The electrolyte solution was introduced into the cell through holes in the counter-electrode. To complete the solar cell, the holes in the counter-electrode were heat sealed with Surlyn and a glass microscope cover slip.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Excited state difference spectra and kinetics were measured on previously reported nanosecond transient absorption spectrometers.24 Pump powers ranged between 70–90 mW with a spot size of about 3 mm.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The preparation of ([Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)](PF6)2), (dye 2), is depicted in Scheme 1. First step of the dye 2 synthesis consists of a two-day condensation between 5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline and excess dicarboxylic anhydride to give our target acceptor ligand, NMI-phen.25 The NMI-phen ligand is coordinated to the Ru(dcb)2Cl2 by heating with microwave irradiation to produce the desired ruthenium polypyridyl complex dye 2.

Electronic absorption properties

Fig. 1 depicts the absorption spectra of [Ru(dcb)3]2+ (black) and [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)](PF6)2 (red) in comparison with the NMI-phen free ligand (blue) in a MeCN–H2O 3:1 mixed solvent. The electronic transitions are assigned based upon comparisons of the spectra. Absorptions from the NMI-phen ligand were centered around 280 nm and 335 nm and were assigned as π–π* transitions of the NMI and phen moieties of the ligand, respectively.25 Both ruthenium-based complexes showed a strong feature near 295 nm that was assigned as the dcb ligand-centered π–π* transition. Both also showed broad bands in the visible region that peaked around 470 nm, attributed to well-established metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) transitions.26

Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of NMI-phen and [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ were explored by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1‡). Table 1 shows the half-wave potentials (E1/2 = (Ea + Ec)/2) observed in acetonitrile with a 100 mV s−1 scan rate. NMI-phen0/− and [RuII(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+/+ possess two comparable reversible reductions at around −0.9 V and −1.15 V, which are attributed to the first and second reduction of the NMI unit. An irreversible reduction for [RuII(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]+/0 occurred at −1.5 V. A reversible oxidation is present for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]3+/2+ at 1.34 V corresponding to the RuIII/II oxidation. When comparing the two ruthenium complexes, [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]3+/2+, is more easily oxidized than [Ru(dcb)3]3+/2+. The presence of the electron withdrawing NMI group on the former complex apparently has a larger effect on the ruthenium electron density than the two carboxylic acid groups of the third dcb ligand of the latter complex.

Spectroelectrochemistry
The difference spectrum for reduced NMI-phen has been collected using spectroelectrochemistry and is shown in Fig. 2. From electrochemistry, we know that the first reduction on the [RuII(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ complex is on the NMI-phen ligand. Signals arising from the reduced ligand can be expected to show up in the reduced complex as well. As shown in Fig. 2, the reduced NMI-phen shows strong absorption in the visible, with rather sharp peaks at 470 nm and 560 nm, as well as a broad absorption in the 700–950 nm region. This is in good agreement with previous reports and indicates that the electron in the reduced species is localized on the NMI-phen and not the dcb ligand.25,28 This provides the spectroscopic tag needed to distinguish the reduced dye from the excited complex (Fig. S5‡). The reduced species is used to measure the regeneration process.

Photovoltaic measurements

Fig. 3 shows efficiencies of absorbed photon-to-current conversion comparing [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ and [Ru(dcb)3]2+ with two different electrolytes I3−/I− and CoIII/II. The standard redox mediator in n-type DSSCs is I3−/I−. However, for p-type DSSCs, higher VOC values have been obtained with CoIII/II containing electrolytes8 and has recently shown significant promise in n-type DSSCs,29 producing a cell with an overall efficiency of 12.3%.30 As seen in Fig. 3, we observe low values of absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE = 5–6%) with the two complexes when using the I3−/I− redox couple (solid lines). Only a small difference in efficiencies can be seen between the sensitizers with I3−/I−. In contrast, a much larger separation is seen with the CoIII/II redox couple [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+, where dtb is 4,4′-ditertbutylbipyridine (dashed lines). [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ shows an APCE of ca. 25% while [Ru(dcb)3]2+ gives an APCE of only 1%. This dramatic increase in photon-to-current conversion efficiency is attributed to the presence of the appended electron acceptor, NMI. This improvement shows the potential benefit of using a CoIII/II electrolyte for p-type DSSCs and the opportunity it provides for the use of dyes with more negative reduction potentials.

Photovoltaic performance parameters of solar cells sensitized with the two ruthenium complexes are summarized in Table 2. The accompanying current–voltage characteristics of the dyes under AM 1.5 and in the dark are given in the ESI (Fig. S6‡). As shown through APCE measurements, the cell performance from [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ with the appended electron acceptor shows improved photon-to-current efficiency as compared to [Ru(dcb)3]2+. The improved [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ performance may be explained by the presence of NMI-phen. Charge recombination between the reduced sensitizer and the NiO valence band hole is known to be very fast and distance dependant in previously studied NiO DSSCs.8 In the present case, negative charge is expected to localize on the NMI acceptor, which increases the distance between the negative electron and the positive hole on the NiO. This stabilizes charge separation and increases the lifetime of the NiO hole. As described below, a series of transient absorption measurements were performed in order to correlate the APCE improvements with lifetimes of associated processes.

Improvement in APCE moving from the control to the appended ruthenium complex is significantly increased with the CoIII/II redox mediator. Overall photoconversion efficiencies, η, differ by more than one order of magnitude between the two complexes. The largest improvement is represented by the open-circuit voltage Voc. [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ displays a Voc of 195 mV, when [Ru(dcb)3]2+ has a Voc of only 15 mV. Maximum short circuit current and open circuit voltage, respectively Jsc and Voc, are improved for the system with [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ as a dye. Low fill factor (ff) and overall efficiency values are expected from the intrinsically low light harvesting efficiencies (LHE) of these p-type DSSCs. NiO films are known for low levels of dye loading due to their necessary thin layers. Thin films are required due to transparency and stability issues. The lack of material on the surface – along with the lower absorptivity of the ruthenium complexes compared to the organic counterparts – can explain the small LHE, which leads to rather low values of both the Voc and Jsc also with the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ dye (cf. ref. 8, 11, 31).
Transient absorption
The differences in photovoltaic performance for the two photosensitizers can be explained through examination of two competing reactions involving the reduced [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ on NiO. It has been shown for a range of different types of dyes that hole injection from the excited photosensitizer into the NiO valence band occurs predominantly on the sub-ps time scale.8,13,14,31–34 This means the reduced dye forms well before the nanosecond time resolution of our present experiment. From this reduced species chemisorbed to the NiO surface, recombination and regeneration are the two mechanisms for ground state recovery. First, recombination will short circuit the cell by allowing the NiO hole and reduced sensitizer to geminately react. This is detrimental to the APCE and overall efficiency of the cell. Second, regeneration by electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the CoIII complex promotes the flow of charge through the cell and increases the APCE and device efficiency.
Recombination times have been measured using nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy on assembled cells dyed with the respective photosensitizers and filled with an inert electrolyte (no redox mediator). In this configuration, the intrinsic dynamics associated with each sensitizer are modulated only by attachment to the NiO surface. Under these circumstances, the reduction of the sensitizer through hole injection and recombination between the reduced photosensitizer and valence band hole in NiO were observed.
In the experiments on NiO, we see no evidence for the excited-state of [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ (spectra shown in ESI Fig. S5‡) on any time scale within our temporal resolution (ca. 10 ns), which suggests that hole injection/sensitizer reduction occurs on a timescale of less than 10 ns.
The transient spectral measurements showed a peak at 490 nm, a shoulder around 560 nm, and an increasing absorption from 700 nm towards the red detection limit (Fig. 4) matching the spectroelectrochemical data of the NMI-phen ligand for the reduced species (Fig. 2). These corresponding features were observed in the transient absorption data for the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ complex when attached to NiO.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ on NiO in an electrolyte with no redox couple, at time delays of 100 ns (red), 500 ns (yellow), 10 μs (green), and 100 μs (blue) after the excitation pulse. 
By comparing the transient spectra of the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ complex on NiO and the spectroelectrochemistry of NMI-phen in solution with literature values for similar reduced NMI molecules, it is apparent that for both [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ and NMI-phen, reduction is localized entirely on the NMI group.25,28 This tells us that the transient species observed within the first few hundred nanoseconds after photoexcitation is due to the reduced NMI group in the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ complex. NiO holes absorb throughout the visible region, more towards the blue35 and should give broad, indistinct contributions to the transients. All these signals disappear on the time scale of tens of microseconds, which is attributed to recombination between the NiO hole and the reduced NMI group on the dye.
The control [Ru(dcb)3]2+ complex showed smaller signals over this wavelength range. The peaks at 510 nm and just below 400 nm, together with a ground state bleach around 470 nm (on top of the NiO(+) absorption), are attributable to the reduced complex [Ru(dcb)3]+. The smaller signals may be due to more rapid recombination components for [Ru(dcb)3]2+ than for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+, which is attributed to the reduced NMI in [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ being situated further from the NiO interface than the reduced dcb in [Ru(dcb)3]2+.
From electrochemistry and comparison of the electrochemically reduced species to the photoexcited species, the excess electron can be said to be localized on the NMI unit, and the [Ru(dcb)3]2+ species, respectively. These observations represent the first spectroscopic identification of the reduced Ru-based photosensitizer on NiO. With this signal, a time constant for recombination can be positively established.
Single wavelength kinetic traces were therefore collected (Fig. S4‡). The kinetic processes for recombination could not be modelled by simple mono- or multi-exponential decay functions, but the data were well fit by the Kohlrausch–William–Watts function; also known as a “stretched exponential” and given as eqn (1) (1)where A is the pre-exponential factor, τ is the empirical lifetime, and β determines the extent of stretching for the exponential decay. The average time constants, 〈τ〉, for the decay traces were extracted using a table of gamma functions, Γ. 〈τ〉 represents the weighted average time constant in a given distribution and is determined by the β value.

Tables 3 and 4 show the decay fitting parameters and the 〈τ〉 associated with ground state recovery. For cells with no redox couple, this process is achieved entirely through dye−/NiO(+) recombination. With a redox mediator present, decay of the reduced dye is due to both recombination and regeneration processes. Table 3 shows the parameters associated with recombination, while Table 4 lists parameters for the combination of recombination and regeneration.

As can be seen from Table 3, the average recombination time, 〈τ〉, for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ is an order of magnitude slower than for [Ru(dcb)3]2+. This can be attributed to the longer distance of the excess electron from the NiO surface when localized on the NMI-phen. A larger distance from the NiO decreases the electronic overlap necessary for rapid electron recombination, effectively slowing down the process and extending the lifetimes of the reduced photosensitizer and the hole in the substrate. Lengthening of the recombination timescale can, by itself, increase efficiency by allowing for a higher yield of hole transport through the substrate and regeneration of the sensitizer by the electrolyte.

Table 4 shows the fitting parameters for cells made with the [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ redox couple. Both recombination and regeneration processes are occurring in this configuration. Once again, average times are given for each complex and the trend is opposite to that seen for recombination alone. Whereas the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ recovery time decreases by an order of magnitude upon addition of Co3+/2+, the [Ru(dcb)3]2+ shows no significant change in recovery time.
Comparison of the given average times 〈τ〉 from Tables 3 and 4 show that for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ on NiO, the rate in presence of Co3+/2+ is an order of magnitude faster than without Co3+/2+. This implies the average rate of regeneration is much faster than that of recombination, which will have a marked positive effect on the overall cell performance. Additionally, the lifetimes of the reduced species for the [Ru(dcb)3]2+ complex are similar with and without the [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ redox mediator. This indicates that very little regeneration can occur with this cell configuration. These differences between the complexes are in qualitative agreement with the differences in APCE values using the [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ redox mediator. Whereas the maximum APCE is only ca. 1% for [Ru(dcb)3]2+ it is ca. 25% for [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ (Fig. 3).
From the ten-fold shorter average lifetime of the reduced [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ in the presence of [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ one may at first expect an APCE value around 90%. There are several possibilities why this is not the case. First, there may still be some losses at longer time scales due to hole–electrolyte recombination, although these reactions have been shown to be inefficient for many sensitized NiO systems.16 Second, the kinetics measured here are strongly heterogeneous and the dyes reacting fastest in recombination may not be the ones reacting fastest with the electrolyte; therefore it is difficult to predict an exact yield. Third, there may be dye–NiO recombination reactions on a time-scale faster than resolved in the present study. Previous results have shown recombination reactions for a variety of dyes on NiO-electrodes on the sub-nanosecond timescale, and it is possible that this occurs to some extent also in these complexes. Nevertheless, they are at least greatly mitigated compared to the cases with perylene diimide and coumarin sensitizers,13 as we could clearly observe the reduced [Ru(dcb)3]2+ on the ns time scale. Moreover by the addition of an electron-accepting group to the complex, removing electron density from the interface between the photoanode and the photosensitizer, we could further slow down recombination and increase regeneration by the [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ electrolyte.
Finally, we note that regeneration with Co3+ is about one order of magnitude faster than for previous organic dyads on NiO that had a naphtalenediimide (NDI) acceptor on a peryleneimide dye, although E0 for the NDI couples are almost identical (due to the nitro group in the present case). Moreover, the Ru2+ unit is charged and would repel the Co3+ electrolyte. It is possible that the faster regeneration instead is because the present NMI unit is less sterically hindered than the previous NDI that has an octyl substituent. We also speculate that the [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ geometry on NiO may be more orthogonal to the surface and thus more favorable for Co3+ access. With four carboxylic groups [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+ can bind in different ways, with NMI closer to the surface or more orthogonal to it. It is conceivable that the former case results in much faster recombination and that the recombination and regeneration processes observed here on the microsecond timescale relate mainly to the complexes in the orthogonal geometry. This would also explain why the APCE is much lower than the ca. 90% that the regeneration vs. recombination rate suggests. Further work with ultrafast spectroscopy may be able to elucidate both the injection and possible sub-ns components of recombination dynamics.
Conclusions
The work presented in this paper has shown the potential improvements that can be made to the efficiencies of p-type NiO DSSCs by understanding competing kinetic processes and using synthetic design to favor the desired process. It has been shown that the addition of an electron accepting ligand on a ruthenium(II)-based photosensitizer increases the efficiency of the cell by two processes: first, the recombination time is increased, providing more time for the flow of the hole to the back contact of the photoanode to occur. This was determined from the observation of a reduced transient species for Ru-based sensitizers, which was done for the first time in p-type cells. Second, the timescale for regeneration of the reduced sensitizer occurs faster for the appended complex. Processes occurring on the sub nanosecond timescale have yet to be fully characterized as a function of sensitizer. This work is planned and will provide increased insight into the kinetic “leaks” affecting the efficiencies of these NiO/Ru-based sensitizer cells.
A significant improvement in overall efficiency as well as IPCE have been observed from the replacement of [Ru(dcb)3]2+ with [Ru(dcb)2(NMI-phen)]2+. It is clear that the extra electron accepting ligand plays a dramatic role in increasing the efficiency of these cells. Electronic separation of the electron from the NiO surface along with the energetic matching of the [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+ redox couple show a dramatic improvement in both cell efficiency and kinetic competition, similar to what has been reported for organic dyes on NiO.8,31,32
Increased improvement of these efficiencies and the ratio of rates through synthetic design hold the promise of closing the gap between n-type and p-type DSSCs that is necessary to the success of tandem cells.
