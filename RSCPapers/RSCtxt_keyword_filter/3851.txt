    , Accepted 11th December 2014First published on 11th December 2014AbstractWe present here the feasibility of growing well-aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays by a dc reactive magnetron sputtering strategy for flexible dye-sensitized solar cells. These flexible devices yield an efficiency of 5.3% in comparison to 1.2% from traditional TiO2 nanoparticles by a low-temperature technique.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising solution to energy depletion, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction.1–5 They are electrochemical devices directly converting solar energy into electricity with advantages such as relatively high efficiency, low fabrication cost, environmentally friendly operation, and scalable components. Although a power conversion efficiency of 13% has been recorded for transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass substrate DSSCs,6 flexible DSSCs offer unique advantages over classic rigid solar panels in cost-effectiveness, flexibility, lightweight, roll-to-roll processability, and wide applicability. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in cheaper, flexible DSSCs using transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated plastic electrodes (using polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) in place of glass.7,8 Nanocrystalline TiO2 anodes for conventional DSSCs are usually prepared by coating a TiO2 paste containing organic binders onto a TCO glass substrate, followed by sintering at 450–550 °C.9 Removal of organic residues and crystal transition of TiO2 to anatase type can be carried out during a high-temperature process. The remaining challenge associated with the fabrication of flexible DSSCs is identifying techniques that reduce the sintering temperatures because plastic-substrates such as ITO–PEN or ITO–PET suffer structural or chemical changes due to higher temperature (>150 °C). Alternatively, the low-temperature (<150 °C) processes can maintain high transparency of plastic-substrates,10,11 but generate other problems. For example, low-temperature processes cannot remove organic binders from TiO2 films, leading to the formation of cracks during drying, and thus increase electrical resistivity. Decreased adhesion and a poor electrical contact between TiO2 nanoparticles and the substrate are other unresolved issues in low-temperature processing. More importantly, the sluggish crystal structure of rutile cannot transit into robust anatase when processed below 400 °C.12
Some alternative approaches to the preparation of nanocrystalline TiO2 without high-temperature sintering have been developed. Mechanical compression is one of the widely employed techniques for fabricating flexible DSSCs on plastics. Arakawa et al. applied a uniaxial pressure of 100 MPa on a dried TiO2 film for elevation of particle–particle and film–substrate connectivity.13 An optimal power conversion efficiency of 8.1% was determined which was the highest value recorded for flexible DSSCs employing the mechanical compression method. Microwave irradiation is a good approach for necking TiO2 nanoparticles without damaging plastic substrates. A conversion efficiency of 2.2% was obtained by Uchida et al. for a microwave irradiated ITO–PET supported TiO2 film at 28 GHz frequency.14 A new “lift off” technique was developed by Dürr et al., using slurry containing organic binders and employing high-temperature sintering for the preparation of flexible TiO2 films.15 The proposed “lift off” technique involves the calcination of the TiO2 film on a rigid substrate and transfer to a plastic substrate, yielding an efficiency of 7.3% in the work. Moreover, electrophoretic deposition,16 chemical sintering,17 and spray deposition18 have also been used for preparing plastic supported TiO2 films. A magnetron sputtering technique has been previously utilized to deposit a TiO2 layer on a conductive glass substrate for DSSC applications;19 however, a high temperature of 300 °C is required to realize this process. The main limitation of the traditional magnetron sputtering approach is fabrication of TiO2 nanoparticle layers instead of well-aligned nanostructures. Although the efficiency of flexible DSSCs has been markedly enhanced, it is still lower than that of rigid DSSCs. With an aim of further improving the photovoltaic performances of flexible DSSCs, it is a prerequisite to minimize the processing difference between flexible and glass substrates.20 There is a remaining problem for the flexible DSSCs using plastic supported TiO2 nanoparticle films: electrons released from excited dye molecules are injected into TiO2 nanoparticle films. The random walk of an electron through TiO2 nanoparticle networks may experience a million trapping events before percolating to the collecting electrode.21 One solution to this impasse is to decrease the diffusion length by creating independent pathways. To do so, well-aligned TiO2 nanostructure arrays are ideal for restricting electron annihilation. To date, anodization of Ti into anatase TiO2 is a popular method because of its realization in designing TiO2 nanotube arrays.22,23 However, the interfacial resistance between TiO2 and the substrate is expected to be too large to yield a high efficiency.
In the search for new routes of designing efficient TiO2 films on plastic substrates, we report for the first time the attainment of well-aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays on a ITO–PEN substrate by a dc reactive magnetron sputtering technique. Two typical characteristics of this technique have been summarized: (i) a sintering process is not required because of 84% anatase and 16% rutile TiO2 nanocrystallites and close contact with plastic substrates and (ii) the high orientation of TiO2 nanorods promotes the electron transfer along conducting channels. Flexible DSSCs employing TiO2 nanorod arrays display enhanced photovoltaic performances and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 5.3%.

Fig. 1a and b show the representative top-view SEM photographs of as-synthesized aligned TiO2 nanorods over a wide area. The SEM examination illustrates that the TiO2 nanorod arrays have rough tips, while the aligned nanorod arrays with an average thickness of 550 nm are confirmed by the cross-sectional images shown in Fig. 1c. The rough surfaces of aligned TiO2 nanorods are expected to provide a large surface area for dye loading, whereas the vertical growth of TiO2 nanorods on the ITO–PEN substrate can markedly reduce the electron loss during the transfer of photogenerated electrons along such nanostructures.24 It is expected to enhance dye loading and therefore photovoltaic performances of DSSCs by elevating the TiO2 nanorod thickness. However, the TiO2 array thickness cannot be arbitrarily increased due to limited endurance capacity of the sputtering system. If intermittent deposition is applied, there is an obvious interface between two neighboring TiO2 layers which is expected to bring a large resistance for electron transfer, as shown in Fig. 1d.
 Fig. 1  (a) and (b) Top and (c) and (d) cross-sectional SEM views of the ITO–PEN plastic supported TiO2 nanorod array. Image (d) was obtained for the intermittently deposited sample. 
After being carefully scraped from the substrate and dispersed in ethanol solution, the TiO2 array was subjected to TEM observation. Fig. 2a and b display the low-resolution TEM images of the aligned TiO2 nanorods, giving long-range ordered structures instead of physical stacking of TiO2 nanoparticles, and significant titanium and oxygen peaks in the EDS spectrum shown in Fig. 2d. And the loose stack of the TiO2 nanorod arrays is favorable to dye diffusion and adsorption. The clear lattice fringes observed in Fig. 2c indicate that the resultant TiO2 nanorods have good crystallinity. The interplanar spacing of d101 derived from the lattice fringes is 3.45 Å for the anatase phase and 3.51 Å for the rutile phase. The results indicate that as-obtained TiO2 nanorods have mainly anatase crystal structures and grow along the (101) direction.25 The growth of the aligned TiO2 nanorods may be demonstrated by the Thornton structure zone model.26 Briefly, “island” growth dominates the growth process due to a larger cohesion energy than the adhesion energy between atoms.27 At a high sputtering pressure, the surface adatom mobility is very low as proposed by Thornton theory.26 In this way, the sputtered TiO2 nanoparticles may combine and grow into columnar structures.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.3, 37.9, 48.2, 54.0, 55.1, and 62.8° in the pattern of aligned TiO2 nanorods are attributed to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) planes of crystalline anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 77-0443), respectively, whereas the peak at 2θ = 27.5° is attributed to the (110) face of the rutile phase.28 The XRD result demonstrates that the resultant TiO2 nanorod array includes both anatase and rutile phases. The mass fraction of rutile, XR, can be obtained by the following equation:29XR = [1 + 0.79(IA/IR)]−1, where IA and IR represent the XRD intensities corresponding to anatase (101) and rutile (110) reflections, respectively. The aligned TiO2 nanorods synthesized by dc reactive magnetron sputtering contain 84% anatase and 16% rutile and 49% anatase and 51% rutile traditional TiO2 nanoparticles by a low-temperature process. It has been known that the combination of anatase and rutile TiO2 can provide better performance with respect to power conversion efficiency than either anatase or rutile TiO2.30 Due to the band gap overlap of rutile and anatase TiO2, the photogenerated electrons from organic dyes can be easily transferred from their valence bands to their conduction bands.31 Moreover, the anatase phase is beneficial for reducing crystal defects for dye recombination, and the rutile phase can enhance the electron transfer along conducting channels from TiO2 nanocrystallites.32 Therefore, the mass ratio of rutile to anatase has a significant influence on photovoltaic performances, in the current work, the rutile-to-anatase ratio of 1:5 for aligned TiO2 nanorods is better than 1:1 for traditional TiO2 nanoparticles. From UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra shown in Fig. 3b, no obvious alteration in the shape is observed for both TiO2 nanocrystallites. In comparison with traditional TiO2 nanoparticles, the absorption edge of aligned TiO2 nanorods undergoes a blue shift, yielding a band gap (Eg) of 3.17 eV (the Eg for traditional TiO2 nanoparticles is 2.94 eV).33 Due to the fact that Eg values for the two crystal phases match, enormous heterojunctions between anatase and rutile TiO2 may form at the phase interfaces for accelerating electron transfer.34,35 The Raman spectrum of aligned TiO2 nanorods is shown in Fig. 3c, yielding characteristic bands at 397, 518, and 640 cm−1 for B1g, A1g, and Eg modes of the anatase phase. No characteristic band for the rutile phase is detected due to the limitation of the equipment in such a low mass fraction; however, a weak band for the rutile phase is observed at 447 cm−1 in low-temperature processed TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the intensities of the anatase phase are lower and the peaks redshift to a lower wavenumber for TiO2 nanoparticles in comparison with aligned TiO2 nanorods.

Fig. 4a compares the characteristic J–V curves for the DSSCs with aligned nanorods and traditional TiO2 nanoparticles. The cell device with the TiO2 nanorod array anode yields a η of 5.3% (Jsc = 13.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 54.5%) under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) global sunlight, which is at a very high level for flexible DSSCs.36–39 In comparison with the η of 1.2% (Jsc = 3.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.64 V, FF = 53.6%), all the photovoltaic parameters have been significantly enhanced. The Jsc reflects the density of electrons injected from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. The photogenerated electrons suffer from shorter diffusion lengths in the aligned TiO2 nanorod photoanode. Under full sunlight, an average injected electron may experience a million trapping events before either percolating to the collecting electrode or recombining with the I3− species.40 Therefore, the shortened pathway shown in Fig. 4d is expected to provide elevated electron accumulation on the conduction band of TiO2 and separation with the I3− species.21 Moreover, the less number of crystal defects due to an increased anatase fraction is also favorable to reduce the electron loss. The Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential energy of the electrolyte. However, the real Voc of a solar cell is generally smaller than this theoretical limit. One of the reasons for this is a backward reaction between electrons and I3− ions. Due to the fact that the conduction band of rutile TiO2 is lower than that of the anatase phase, leading to a higher theoretical Voc value for the DSSC with aligned TiO2 nanorods. In addition, the shortened pathway and less number of defects are also crucial for the enhancement in the real Voc value. The FF value is dependent on the cell resistance. As shown in Fig. 4d, the large interfacial resistance between TiO2 nanoparticles can both provide traps for the electron loss and elevate the cell resistance. Additionally, the low-temperature sintering for photoanode assembly results in a poor contact between TiO2 and the ITO–PEN substrate. Therefore, the DSSC employing aligned TiO2 nanorods has a lower cell resistance and FF value, which can be confirmed by the Nyquist EIS spectra. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the Nyquist EIS spectra of the flexible DSSCs employing aligned TiO2 nanorods and traditional TiO2 nanoparticles, yielding Rct2 values of 46.5 and 122.2 Ω cm2, respectively. A low Rct2 means the electrons can easily transfer to the FTO layer along TiO2 nanocrystalline channels. From this view, the electron is expected to have a longer lifetime because of fewer traps for the electron loss. The Bode EIS spectra shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†) can be employed to assess the average electron lifetime (τ) in the TiO2 anode. The τ value is 73 μs for the solar cell with TiO2 nanoparticles, where it has been markedly enhanced to 333 μs for the aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays. The shortened diffusion length, lower TiO2/TiO2 interfacial resistance, and less number of crystal defects have been considered as three crucial origins for an enhanced electron lifetime. Fig. 4b presents the IPCE spectra of DSSC devices with two photoanodes. The broad IPCE curves, covering the spectrum from 400 to 800 nm, exhibit an IPCE value of ∼75% for the cell with aligned TiO2 nanorods in the visible-light region, which is much higher than ∼35% for the solar cell with the traditional TiO2 nanoparticle anode. The results from IPCE measurements reveal that the number of electrons produced in the external circuit is larger using the TiO2 nanorod array photoanode,41 which is consistent with the corresponding value of Jsc.

With the aim of determining on–off and multiple start performances of the DSSCs with two photoanodes, the on–off switches in the time slot of 0–250 s were measured by alternately illuminating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) the devices at an interval of 25 s and 0 V, as shown in Fig. 4c. A sharp increase and no delay in photocurrent density suggest a fast start of cell operation at irradiation. No obvious reduction in photocurrent density in each “on” state indicates no apparent electron recombination kinetics. However, the photocurrent densities decrease by 1.6% and 11.4% for the cells with aligned TiO2 nanorods and traditional TiO2 nanoparticles after five on–off cycles, respectively. This result demonstrates that the synthesis of TiO2 nanorod array photoanode obtained by dc reactive magnetron sputtering is promising for robust flexible DSSCs.
In summary, we have demonstrated that well-aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays with 84% anatase and 16% rutile phases can be realized by a dc reactive magnetron sputtering strategy for flexible DSSC applications. Due to the shortened diffusion length, lower TiO2/TiO2 interfacial resistance and less crystal defects, a power conversion efficiency of 5.3% is measured under one sun illumination in comparison with 1.2% for the cell with traditional TiO2 nanoparticles fabricated by a low-temperature technique. Moreover, the virtues of fast on–off and multiple start stability motivate the potential applications of such aligned TiO2 nanorods in robust flexible DSSCs and other photovoltaic cells. The research presented here is far from being optimized but the new concept along with impressive performances promise the TiO2 nanorod array anodes to be strong candidates for use in robust flexible DSSCs. Further studies are now in progress to extend this approach to other aligned photoanodes with polymorphs for the perovskite solar cell or quantum dot solar cell applications.
