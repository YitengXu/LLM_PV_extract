    , Accepted 22nd January 2020First published on 25th January 2020AbstractA simple one-pot heat-up method has been developed to synthesize Cu4SnS4 nanoplates with highly exposed (002) surfaces. Temperature-dependent phase transformation from monoclinic Cu1.94S to orthorhombic Cu4SnS4, and eventually to partially triclinic Cu2SnS3 has been observed. It is revealed that the Sn4+ existing in the laminar structure of Cu1.94S nanoplates starts being incorporated into the Cu1.94S crystal structure at a temperature of around 220 °C, and form pure orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 nanoplates at 260 °C. As the orthorhombic structure of Cu4SnS4 is metastable, it undergoes a phase transformation to the more stable Cu2SnS3 phase at a higher reaction temperature of 270 °C. Furthermore, the size and thickness of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates can be well tuned by the amount of Sn content in the initial reaction mixture to form Cu1.94S nanoplates. Additionally, the formation of Cu1.94S nanoplates is essential for the formation of pure Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals at a fixed reaction temperature. UV-vis and Mott–Schottky analysis show that the as-prepared orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 nanoplates exhibit n-type semiconducting behavior with a band gap of about 1.65 eV. The valence and conduction band potentials have also been determined via theoretical calculations. We believe that our synthetic method and findings will be attractive for the synthesis of other copper-based chalcogenide nanoplates as well as their potential catalytic applications.
Introduction
Copper chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) and their multinary derivatives are an extraordinarily interesting class of materials with a wide range of attainable stable crystal phases.1 The I–IV–VI ternary compound CuxSnSy, with suitable band-gap in the range of 1–1.7 eV,2,3 along with outstanding optical and electronic properties, is attractive for efficient solar energy conversion and storage.3–8 Furthermore, the low-toxicity and earth-abundant composition9 make CuxSnSy a promising semiconductor material for wide range of applications. However, the crystal structure of CuxSnSy is quite complex due to the changeable valence state of Sn and with different stoichiometry of Cu, Sn and S. In the solid state, five stable phases of ternary CuxSnSy have been reported in the temperature range of 400–650 °C: Cu4SnS4, Cu2SnS3, Cu2Sn3S7, Cu5Sn2S7, and Cu10Sn2S13.3,10 Amongst them, Cu2SnS3 is the most commonly explored phase, while Cu4SnS4 is emerging to be of interest for energy storage,8,11–13 hydrogen evolution,14 thermoelectrics15,16 and to some extent in photovoltaics3,5 due to its low thermal conductivity and appropriate band gap. However, it remains a challenge to control the crystal phase as well as the morphology of the products.
Bulk Cu4SnS4 compound is generally synthesized by solid-state reaction from stoichiometric mixtures of the elements or from Cu2S/SnS2 mixtures at elevated temperatures of 700–850 °C.12,15 A few studies have reported on the synthesis of Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals or thin films using solvothermal/hydrothermal processes14,17,18 chemical bath deposition,3,19,20 sputtering21etc. Avellaneda et al. prepared Cu4SnS4 thin films and investigated their photovoltaic applications that showed a built-in potential of 1.1 V for CdS/Cu4SnS4 junction.3 Photovoltaic property of Cu4SnS4 has been investigated with a power conversion efficiency of 2.34% under the standard AM 1.5 condition.5 Furthermore, Chen et al. have synthesized size-controllable, oil-soluble and nearly monodisperse Cu4SnS4 QDs using an improved hydrothermal method with water–oil two-phase reaction system.18 Liu et al. have studied the control of shapes and phases of Cu–Sn–S nanocrystals by varying both the precursors and reaction temperature.22 Meanwhile, controllable synthesis of copper-based ternary and quaternary semiconductor nanoplates with oriented growth is of great interest to investigate their optical and photoelectrochemical properties.23 To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis and formation mechanism of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates as well as their optical properties have not been previously reported.
Previously, researchers have observed that uniform Cu1.94S nanoplates could be obtained with Sn–X binding to the surface of nanoplates, aiding in the formation of 2D structure as well as self-assembly.24 Further incorporation of Sn or Sn + Zn into Cu1.94S result in the phase transformation from Cu1.94S to Cu3SnS425 and Cu2ZnSnS4,26 respectively. Furthermore, kuramite Cu3SnS4 and mohite Cu2SnS3 nanoplatelet have been synthesized using covellite CuS as templates.27 Post-synthetic incorporation of Sn into copper sulfide has been shown to be an effective way of producing CuxSnSy and the product is sensitive to the crystal structure of copper sulfide and the source of Sn.25,27 Moreover, the controllable synthesis of multinary sulfide semiconductor nanocrystals has long been investigated, with the results demonstrating that the properties of the semiconductor is dependent on its crystal structure, morphology, composition, etc.28–32 Herein, we report on our recent results on Cu4SnS4 nanoplates prepared by using Cu1.94S nanoplates as templates. Our investigation indicates that the existing Sn4+ in solution can be incorporated into the Cu1.94S nanoplates at a specific reaction temperature, resulting in the formation a new orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 structure. Moreover, the morphology of the resulting Cu4SnS4 retain the shape of the nanoplates with enlargement in the thickness. The size and thickness of the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates can further be tuned via changes in the initial content of Sn4+ during the reaction. We have investigated the structural transformation of monoclinic Cu31S16 to orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 and the related optical band structure of the resulting nanoplates. Our findings can be helpful in realizing the formation of other complex chalcogenide nanoplates.
Experimental section
Materials
Copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2, Aladdin, 97%), tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O, 99%), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, Aladdin, 98%) were used without further purification. Other chemicals were all of analytical grade.
Synthesis of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates
All the experiments were carried out in a fume hood under inert N2 atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. The Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals were prepared via a simple one-pot heat-up method. In brief, 0.21 g copper(II) acetylacetonate (0.8 mmol), and 0.14 g tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (0.4 mmol) were added into a 100 mL four-neck round-bottom flask containing 20 mL 1-dodecanethiol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min with nitrogen purging and gradually heated to 120 °C and kept for 20 min. Subsequently, the solution was continued to be heated to 200 °C and maintained for 60 min. Then, the reaction system was gradually heated up to final reaction temperatures of 220, 230, 250, 260 and 270 °C and maintained for 30 min. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, centrifuged and washed thrice with hexane.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the products was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-Smart Lab Advance) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5408 Å) as the X-ray source. The morphology of the nanocrystals was studied using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). Copper foil with carbon film was used as substrate for TEM measurement. The UV-vis absorption spectra were collected using a UV-vis spectrometer (Varian Cary 300). The oxidation states of elements Cu, Sn and S present in the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance was recorded on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660E) in a standard three-electrode cell. The working electrode was prepared by spray-painting Cu4SnS4 nanoplates suspension on indium tin oxide glass (ITO) glass, followed by annealing under Ar atmosphere at 300 °C for 30 min. Platinum plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The Mott–Schottky curve was recorded in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH = 7 and frequency of 1000 Hz.
Results and discussion
The crystal structure and morphology of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1a, the major diffraction peaks can well be indexed to orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 (JCPDS card no. 27-0196, space group Pnma (62), a = 13.57, b = 7.69, c = 6.42 Å). As shown in Fig. 1b and c, uniform nanoplates are observed both in the SEM and TEM images over a large area, indicating homogeneous growth of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates using the as-formed Cu1.94S nanoplates24,26 as template. The nanoplates are formed mostly with triangular and hexagonal shapes, with some nanoplates oriented perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 1d and e). The three-dimensional micrograph of nanoplates can also be seen from different perspective in the TEM image (Fig. S1†). As shown in the size distribution histogram of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates (Fig. 1f), the lateral size and thickness of individual nanoplates is about 66.9 ± 8.4 nm and 17.3 ± 2.2 nm, respectively. The thickness of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates is about twice the thickness of Cu1.94S nanoplates (lateral size of 55.1 ± 4.2 nm and thickness of 8.1 ± 0.7 nm),26 which further confirms the growth of Cu4SnS4 with incorporation of Sn into the Cu1.94S at a reaction temperature of 260 °C.

The HRTEM images of the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates lying flat on the substrate, and those standing on end perpendicular to the substrate are shown in Fig. 2a and d. The lattice distance is measured to be 0.34 and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (220) and (002) planes of Cu4SnS4, respectively. It also indicate that the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates are bound by {002} planes as the top and bottom surfaces. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images of the lattices are shown in Fig. 2b and e, indicating the nanoplates being viewed along [001] and [10] direction of orthorhombic Cu4SnS4. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 2d) and corresponding FFT image of the side-view indicate that the nanoplates grow along the <001> direction. Fig. 2c and f illustrate the crystal structure of Cu4SnS4 viewed from [001] and [10] direction, respectively.

In order to investigate the formation mechanism, we have studied the crystal structure evolution of nanocrystals synthesized at different reaction temperatures. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of products synthesized at different reaction temperatures of 220, 230, 250, 260, and 270 °C, respectively. When the reaction temperature is maintained at 220 °C for 30 min, the major diffraction peaks of products are observed at 46.2 and 48.5°, which match well with the monoclinic Cu1.94S phase (JCPDS 34-0660). This indicates that at 220 °C, the Sn–DDT complex still exists in the laminar structure of as-formed Cu1.94S nanoplates. When the reaction temperature is increased to 230 °C, additional peaks at 26.3 and 26.6° are noticeable, which correspond to the two main diffraction peaks of orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 phase (JCPDS 27-0196). It demonstrates that the lowest reaction temperature for Sn4+ to diffuse into the Cu1.94S nanoplates and form Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals is around 230 °C. The peaks of Cu4SnS4 become stronger at reaction temperature of 250 °C. Note that, there exists an extra peak at 27.5°, which can be ascribed to a trace amount of orthorhombic Cu3SnS4 (JCPDS 36-0217) existing in the products. The extra peak disappears at 260 °C, and all the observed peaks match well with orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 phase (JCPDS 27-0196), indicating the formation of phase-pure Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals at this temperature. Interestingly, with even higher reaction temperature of 270 °C, higher intensity for peaks at 28.3, 47.2, 56.0° are observed, which correspond to the (1) (010) and (10) planes of triclinic Cu2SnS3 (JSPDS 27-0198). Thus, during the simple heating up process of the reaction system from 200 to 270 °C, we observe two distinct phase transformation processes, that is from monoclinic Cu1.94S to orthorhombic Cu4SnS4, and finally partial transformation to Cu2SnS3. The corresponding crystal structures of Cu4SnS4 and Cu2SnS3 are shown in Fig. 3b and c.

Djurleite (Cu1.94S) is a semiconducting metal chalcogenide compound with a cationic deficiency structure. The space group of Cu1.94S is monoclinic, with lattice parameters of a = 26.897, b = 15.745, c = 13.565 Å, α = 90°, β = 90.13°, γ = 90°. At temperatures above 125 °C, Cu1.94S has only 85% of the copper sites occupied in the hexagonally packed framework of sulfur atoms.33 This makes the Cu atoms in Cu1.94S behave virtually like “fluid” as is supported by the fact that djurleite has a high ionic conductivity above 100 °C. Thus, djurleite is an ideal host for forming multinary semiconductors with unique physical properties.25 Gao et al. have reported at an elevated reaction temperature of 200 °C and prolonged reaction time of 4–10 h, Sn atoms can be incorporated into the copper vacancy sites in Cu31S16 and transform the crystal lattice of Cu31S16 to give rise to the orthorhombic phase Cu3SnS4.25 Thus, with even higher reaction temperature (260 °C) and obviously much faster cation exchange process, orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 could be obtained in our experiment. Similar cation-exchange-induced phase transformations with a growth model of binary Cu–S to ternary Cu–Sn–S to quaternary Cu–Zn–Sn–S has also been reported by Tan et al.34
The crystal structure of Cu1.94S is quite complex, containing 32 sulfur atoms and 62 copper atoms in a unit cell. It should be noted that most of the Cu atoms (88.7%) have three coordination, 8% of Cu have four coordination and 1.6% of Cu have two coordination. Since Cu atoms with coordination less than four are not stable at higher temperatures, Sn will diffuse into the unit cell of Cu1.94S with partial replacement of Cu with increasing reaction temperature. During this process, the symmetry of the unit cell increases, thus the lattice parameters of Cu4SnS4 (a = 13.57, b = 7.69, c = 6.42 Å) is about half of Cu1.94S (a = 26.897, b = 15.745, c = 13.565 Å). Furthermore, the ionic radius of Sn4+ (55 pm for CN = 4) is smaller than that of Cu+ (60 pm for CN = 4), rendering the diffusion of Sn and replacement of Cu occur easily. While Sn and Cu adopt different valence states and coordination, it is not a simple replacement, but with simultaneous dissolution of Cu atom.
As can be seen from Table 1, the unit cell of Cu4SnS4 is closely related to that of Cu1.94S. The β angle for djurleite Cu1.94S is 90.13°, which is quite close to 90° for orthorhombic Cu4SnS4, making the structural transformation from monoclinic Cu1.94S to orthorhombic Cu4SnS4 occur quite readily.
Based on the octet rule, if the sum of the valence electrons, ∑, of the cations surrounding an anion divided by the anion's coordination number plus the number of the anion's valence electrons is equal to eight, then that structure will be in a low energy state because the anion is in a closed-shell state.35 In the orthorhombic structure of Cu4SnS4, there are three different S sites, namely S(1), S(2), S(3), and the ratio of S(1):S(2):S(3) equals to 2:1:1. All of the S sites are surrounded by metal atoms (M, Cu and Sn) to form SM4 or SM5 clusters with different combinations. The ∑ values of S(1)–[4Cu, Sn], S(2)–[3Cu, Sn], and S(3)–[4Cu, Sn] clusters, are 8, 7, and 8, respectively for the orthorhombic structure of Cu4SnS4. Thus, the average sum of the valence electrons, ∑, divided by coordination number is equal to 1.64. This value plus the number of the anion's valence electrons (6) is equal to 7.64, which is less than 8, indicating that Cu4SnS4 in the orthorhombic structure is not a stable structure. Interestingly, we have observed that Cu4SnS4 will partially convert to Cu2SnS3 (a = 5.413, b = 5.413, c = 10.824 Å; α = β = γ = 90°) at higher reaction temperatures, which is consistent with the predicted result.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 4) has been performed to confirm the oxidation states of the elements Cu, Sn and S present in Cu4SnS4 nanoplates. The XPS peak software was used for the spectra calibration and data fitting. Fig. 4a displays the XPS survey spectrum of Cu4SnS4, which shows signals attributed to Cu, Sn, S, C, and O. High-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Sn 3d, S 2p, and O 1s have been measured to determine the oxidation states of these elements (Fig. 4b–d and S2†). The peaks of Cu 2p appear at 932.2 eV (2p3/2) and 951.9 eV (2p1/2) with a separation of 19.7 eV, which is in accordance with the value of Cu(I). The high resolution XPS spectra of Sn shows two peaks at binding energies of 486.2 and 494.8 eV, which can be assigned to Sn(IV) with a peak separation of 8.6 eV. The sulfur is confirmed by peak splitting of 1.6 eV and two peaks located at 161.1 and 162.7 eV, which can be attributed to the presence of S2−. The peak positions of Cu 2p, Sn 3d, and S 2p are in good agreement with literature reports.17,18 No other valences, such as Cu(II), or Sn(II), are observed. As shown in Fig. S2,† the O 1s spectrum with a characteristic peak located at 532.0 eV can be ascribed to the water molecules absorbed on the surface.17,36

We have found that the thickness and size of the as-synthesized nanoplates can be well controlled with different amount of SnCl4·5H2O precursor used for the reaction, as shown in Fig. 5a. As shown in Fig. 5b, with either less (0.2 mmol) or more (0.6 mmol) Sn precursor, the product obtained at 260 °C is composed of a mixture of Cu2SnS3 and Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals. With excess Sn precursor (0.6 mmol), the nanoplates are mainly composed of Cu2SnS3. More interestingly, with excess Sn precursor (0.6 mmol), larger nanoplates with lateral size of ∼120 nm are obtained (Fig. 5c). As the crossection image of thin nanoplates is difficult to image using TEM, we are unable to obtain their exact thickness. Smaller nanoplates of ∼25 nm in length and ∼10 nm thickness are observed when using 0.2 mmol SnCl4·5H2O as precursor (Fig. 5d). This may be due to the fact that when using 0.8 mmol Cu(acac)2 as precursor, 0.2 mmol SnCl4·5H2O is just the exact amount based on stoichiometry for the formation of Cu4SnS4 nanocrystals. Thus, any extra available Sn precursor can act as shaping ligands resulting in the formation of nanoplates with larger lateral size. This observation is in accordance with our previous work on synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystals using Cu1.94S nanoplates as starting material.26 However, changes in Sn concentration during the reaction can not only influence the morphology of the nanoplates but also the crystal structure. Thus, both the crystal structure and morphology are sensitive to the amount of Sn precursor used for the reaction.

During the synthesis of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates, we have maintained the reaction system at an intermediate temperature of 200 °C for 60 min to form the Cu1.94S nanoplates as initial seed nuclei. For comparison, controlled experiments have been done by directly increasing the reaction temperature from 120 °C to the reaction temperature (250, 260, and 270 °C) and maintained for 30 min. Interestingly, we notice that without the formation of Cu1.94S template, the product is composed of a mixture of Cu4SnS4 and Cu2SnS3 at reaction temperatures from 250 to 270 °C, as shown in ESI† Fig. S3. This indicates that the initially formed monoclinic Cu1.94S nanoplates aid in the formation of orthorhombic Cu4SnS4. Otherwise, the more stable phase Cu2SnS3 coexists with Cu4SnS4.
It is well known that the positions of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potentials are important for determining the photocatalytic properties of a semiconductor. We have used UV-vis spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky plot analysis to investigate the optical property and band potentials of the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates. The optical characteristics of as-synthesized Cu4SnS4 nanoplates has been studied by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 6a). The as prepared Cu4SnS4 nanoplates exhibit board absorption in the visible region. The band gap is determined by plotting (Ahv)2versus hv (A = absorbance, h = Planck's constant and v = frequency) and extrapolating the linear portion of the spectrum in the band edge region. The band gap for Cu4SnS4 nanoplates is determined to be 1.65 ± 0.25 eV. The Cu4SnS4 nanoplates when dispersed in hexane and sonicated for 10 min forms a dark brown color solution, which indicates a strong absorption at visible wavelengths.

In order to determine the location of band edges of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates, we used the electrical impedance spectroscopy technique referred to as Mott–Schottky analysis. The measurement of differential capacitance as a function of potential vs. SCE is performed in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH = 7 and frequency of 1000 Hz. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Mott–Schottky plot shows a positive slope, indicating n-type semiconducting behavior of Cu4SnS4. The flat-band potential can be estimated from the extrapolation of the linear portion in the plot of 1/C2vs. potential (V) to the x-intercept, and is determined to be −0.26 eV vs. SCE and +0.19 eV vs. NHE. It is accepted that the flat-band potential is very close to the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductor.37 Thus, the VB is about +1.84 eV with the band gap of 1.65 eV from UV-vis spectra.
In addition, the band gap positions of VB and CB potentials of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates have been calculated according to the following equations:38,39 (1) EVB = ECB + Eg(2)where ECB, EVB, χ, and Eg are the CB potential, VB potential, absolute electronegativity, and band gap energy of the semiconductor, respectively. EC is about 4.5 eV, which is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale. The χ, calculated to be 5.16 eV, is the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of constituent atoms, for which the absolute electronegativity of copper, tin and sulfur are 4.48 eV, 4.30 eV, and 6.22 eV, respectively. The UV-vis spectra shows the band gap of Cu4SnS4 is about 1.65 eV. According to eqn (1) and (2), the CB and VB potentials of Cu4SnS4 are determined to be −0.16 and +1.48 eV, respectively. Based on the calculated results, the electronic band structure of Cu4SnS4 can be obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration for the calculated electronic band structures of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates. 
As noted that VB and CB potentials from the Mott–Schottky analysis are slightly higher than the calculated values. Thus, the relative locations of valence band (VB) maximum for Cu4SnS4 nanoplates was further determined via the XPS valence spectra. As displayed in Fig. 8, the Cu4SnS4 nanoplates has distinct VB with the edge of maximum energy at about +1.24 eV. Therefore, according to the band gap, the CB minimum of Cu4SnS4 nanoplates is −0.41 eV. As noted, the CB and VB potentials are somewhat sensitive to the measurements with a differential value of about 0.2–0.36 eV.

Conclusions
In summary, Cu4SnS4 nanoplates have been synthesized via a simple one-pot heat-up method using Cu1.94S nanocrystals as nuclei. The phase transformation monitored during the heating up process indicates that Sn4+ are gradually incorporated into the as-formed Cu1.94S nanoplates with increasing reaction temperature. Phase-pure Cu4SnS4 nanoplates are obtained at 260 °C for reaction time of 30 min. Our investigations also suggest that both the crystal structure and size of the nanoplates are dependent on the amount of Sn4+ used for the reaction. Excess Sn4+ aids in the formation of thinner and larger nanoplates, while less Sn4+ results in the formation of smaller and thicker nanoplates. Additionally, at higher reaction temperature (270 °C) or without the formation of Cu1.94S nuclei, the more stable Cu3SnS4 phase is formed during the reaction process. The as-prepared Cu4SnS4 nanoplates with band gap of ∼1.65 eV and suitable electrical properties are attractive for photocatalytic applications. With earth-abundant and non-toxic composition, Cu4SnS4 has potential to be an environmentally-friendly photocatalyst. The synthesis strategy and findings will be relevant for the controllable synthesis of other copper chalcogenide nanocrystals as well as their photocatalytic applications.
