    , Accepted 20th May 2020First published on 21st May 2020AbstractA series of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) were prepared by using J71 as the donor and non-fullerene materials, namely, BTP-BO-4Cl or ITIC or their mixture as the acceptor. The BTP-BO-4Cl- and ITIC-based binary OPVs exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.63% and 10.46%, respectively, resulting from the different open-circuit voltages (VOCs) of 0.881 V vs. 0.941 V, short-circuit current densities (JSCs) of 22.88 mA cm−2vs. 15.39 mA cm−2 and fill factors (FFs) of 57.79% vs. 72.34%. Meanwhile, BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC exhibited apparently complementary photon harvesting ranges, which were conducive to improving the photon harvesting of ternary active layers with different ITIC contents in the acceptors. An optimized PCE of 13.65% was achieved from the ternary OPVs with 60 wt% ITIC content in the acceptors, mainly benefiting from the markedly increased VOC and FF, compared with that for the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs. Over 17% improvement in PCE was obtained by incorporating 60 wt% ITIC in the acceptors, indicating that the ternary strategy can be an efficient and simple method to improve the performance of OPVs.
Introduction
In recent years, great progress has been achieved in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with narrow optical band gap organic semiconducting materials as active layers, exhibiting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16%.1–4 The photon harvesting range of organic semiconducting materials is usually less than that of inorganic semiconducting materials, which limits the photon harvesting of organic active layers consisting of one donor and one acceptor. Enhanced photon harvesting of active layers is the precondition for achieving efficient OPVs. The ternary strategy provides an efficient and simple method to enhance the photon harvesting of the active layers with two donors or two acceptors.5–7 The third component plays versatile roles in improving the performance of OPVs, such as enhancing photon harvesting,8–10 increasing the photon utilization efficiency through energy transfer or charge transfer,11–13 optimizing the phase separation of ternary active layers,14–16 and increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ternary OPVs by minimizing energy loss.17–19 The optical band gap, energy level alignment, absorption coefficient and charge mobility of the third component should well match with those of the host binary OPVs. Meanwhile, the compatibility of used materials is a vital factor to achieve efficient ternary OPVs with excellent phase separation of active layers for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. The photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit current density (JSC), VOC and fill factor (FF) of the corresponding binary OPVs should be fully evaluated for selecting the materials to prepare efficient ternary OPVs. The complementary photovoltaic parameters of two binary OPVs can be appropriate to select well-matched materials; the advantages of the photovoltaic parameters of binary OPVs may be well recombined into one cell by employing the ternary strategy.20,21 The ternary strategy can be a good candidate to improve the performance of OPVs with simple cell fabrication.
In this study, a series of J71-based normal structured OPVs were prepared with BTP-BO-4Cl or ITIC or their mixture as the acceptor.22–24 The chemical structures of the used materials and the device structure of OPVs are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The polymer J71 exhibits relatively strong photon harvesting ability in the spectral range from 450 nm to 600 nm. BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC exhibit different photon harvesting ranges in the long wavelength range, resulting in markedly different JSCs of 22.88 mA cm−2 and 15.39 mA cm−2 for the BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC-based binary OPVs, respectively. Apparently complementary absorption spectra of neat J71, BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC films could be observed, as exhibited in Fig. 1c. The two J71-based binary OPVs also exhibited different VOCs due to the different lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC. The LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the used materials are exhibited in Fig. 1d. The relatively large FF of 72.34% for the ITIC-based OPVs indicated efficient charge transport channels in the J71:ITIC active layers. The morphology of the ternary active layers could be optimized by adjusting the ITIC content in the acceptors, which is one of the prerequisites to achieve efficient OPVs. An optimized PCE of 13.65% was achieved for the ternary OPVs with acceptors having 60 wt% ITIC, corresponding to over 17% improvement in PCE in comparison to that for the two binary OPVs.

Results and discussion
The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the binary and ternary OPVs were measured under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light having 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, as exhibited in Fig. 2a. The BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs exhibited a PCE of 11.63%, resulting from a JSC of 22.88 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.881 V and FF of 57.79%. Furthermore, 10.46% PCE was achieved for the ITIC-based binary OPVs along with a JSC of 15.39 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.941 V and FF of 72.34%. There were apparently complementary photovoltaic parameters between the two binary OPVs. An optimized PCE of 13.65% was achieved for the ternary OPVs with 60 wt% ITIC in the acceptors, resulting from the JSC of 21.33 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.912 V and FF of 70.31%. Compared with the JSC of the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs, the decreased JSC of the ternary OPVs was mainly due to the weakened photon harvesting in the long wavelength range with less BTP-BO-4Cl content in the active layers. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the binary and ternary OPVs were measured (Fig. 2b). It was apparent that the EQE values in the long wavelength range over 730 nm markedly decreased with the increase in the ITIC content in the acceptors. Meanwhile, the EQE values in the spectral range from 600 nm to 730 nm gradually increased on increasing the ITIC content in the acceptors up to 70 wt% and then decreased with the further increase in ITIC. Well balanced photon harvesting of the ternary active layers could be achieved with 60 wt% ITIC content in the acceptors. To better understand the gradual decrease in JSC with more ITIC content, the EQE spectral difference (ΔEQE spectra) between the ternary OPVs and the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs was investigated, as shown in Fig. S1.† Every EQE spectrum of the ternary OPVs exhibits small differences compared with that of the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs in the wavelength range of 300–730 nm and remarkable differences are observed over 730 nm. The ΔEQE values over 730 nm were negative and decreased with the decrease in the BTP-BO-4Cl content in the active layers, supporting the gradual decrease in the JSC of the ternary OPVs. Efficient hole and electron transport channels could be formed in the J71:ITIC active layer due to the relatively high FF of the ITIC-based binary OPVs. The FFs of the ternary OPVs simultaneously improved on increasing the ITIC content in the acceptors, indicating that ITIC can be an excellent morphology regulator to optimize the morphology of ternary active layers. The similar LUMO levels of BTP-BO-4Cl and ITIC were beneficial to the electron transport in the ternary active layers. The gradually enhanced FFs of the ternary OPVs could be due to the optimized phase separation of the ternary active layers by incorporating ITIC as the morphology regulator. To support the dependence of the variation in the FF of the ternary OPVs on the ITIC content in the acceptors, series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) were calculated according to the light J–V curves of OPVs.25,26 For ternary OPVs, RS exhibited a decreasing trend with the increase in the ITIC content; meanwhile, RSH exhibited the opposite trend. The gradually decreased RS and increased RSH could well support the gradually enhanced FF along with the increase in the ITIC content in the acceptors. It is well-known that the VOC of OPVs, especially that of OPVs with the same cell structure, is mainly determined by the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. The gradually increased VOCs of the ternary OPVs can be well explained from the relatively high LUMO levels of ITIC compared with that of BTP-BO-4Cl, indicating that an alloyed state is formed between ITIC and BTP-BO-4Cl. A very similar phenomenon has been commonly reported for the ternary OPVs working under an alloyed state.26–29 The key photovoltaic parameters of the OPVs are summarized in Table 1. Over 17% improvement in PCE can be achieved by recombining the advantages of the photovoltaic parameters of the two binary OPVs into one cell.

To deeply study the influence of the ITIC content on the OPV performance, the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the binary and optimized ternary OPVs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 3a. The Jph of OPVs was achieved by calculating the current density difference between the standard light illumination condition and dark condition.30,31Veff is defined as the difference between V0 and V (Veff = V0 − V), where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, and V is the applied voltage.32–34 When Veffs are larger than 0.3 V, the Jphs of all OPVs reach a saturated state defined as Jsat. The Jsat of the optimized ternary OPVs was less than that of the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs and larger than that of the ITIC-based binary OPVs, which corresponded well to the JSCs of the corresponding OPVs. It should be highlighted that the Jph of the optimized ternary OPVs could rapidly reach the saturated state compared with that of the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs, indicating that the charge transport and collection efficiency in the optimized ternary OPVs could be improved by incorporating 60 wt% ITIC in the acceptors. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be evaluated according to J#ph/Jsat and , respectively.35–37 Here, J#ph and  are the Jph values under short-circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively. The detailed Jph values at different conditions are summarized in the inset of Fig. 3a. The ηcoll of 79.6% and ηdiss of 94.1% markedly improved in the optimized ternary OPVs in comparison to 65.2% and 86.6% for the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs, respectively, suggesting that ITIC can be considered as a morphology regulator to optimize the phase separation of ternary active layers. The J–V curves of the binary and optimized ternary OPVs were measured under different light intensities from 100 mW cm−2 to 1 mW cm−2, as exhibited in Fig. S2.† According to the J–V curves of the typical OPVs under different light intensities, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the light intensity of typical OPVs is described in Fig. 3b, which obeys the expressions JSC ∝ Plightα and VOC ∝ βKTq−1lnPlight, respectively.38–40 When the α and β values are equal to 1, the bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination in the active layers, respectively, can be negligible.38–40 The α values were 0.954, 0.962 and 0.970 for the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs, optimized ternary OPVs and ITIC-based binary OPVs, respectively. The β values were 1.56, 1.39 and 1.24 for the BTP-BO-4Cl-based binary OPVs, optimized ternary OPVs and ITIC-based binary OPVs, respectively. The bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination in the active layers can be suppressed by the incorporation of ITIC, which can well support the increased FF of the corresponding OPVs.

To further investigate the underlying reason behind the improvement in the performance of ternary OPVs due to the incorporation of ITIC, the charge mobility in the active layers was studied by employing the space charge limit current (SCLC) method.41–44 Hole-only and electron-only devices were designed as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDIN/Al, respectively. The dependence of ln(Jd3/V2) on (V/d)0.5 for the devices is shown in Fig. 3c and d. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were evaluated according to the following formula:45  Here, εr is the dielectric constant of the used materials, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, μ represents the charge mobility, V represents the applied voltage and d represents the active layer thickness. The μh and μe values for the optimized ternary active layers were 3.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, the μh value was between 3.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the J71:BTP-BO-4Cl active layers and 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the J71:ITIC active layers; also, the μe value was between 1.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the J71:BTP-BO-4Cl active layers and 2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the J71:ITIC active layers. Meanwhile, μh/μe for the optimized ternary active layers was 1.69, which was in between 2.01 for the J71:BTP-BO-4Cl active layers and 1.54 for the J71:ITIC active layers. The μh/μe values were observed to be closer to 1 with more ITIC content in the acceptors, suggesting more balanced charge transport in the active layers with more ITIC content. The slightly increased values of μh and μe and the closer to 1 μh/μe values for the optimized ternary active layers further indicated that the phase separation of the ternary active layers could be optimized by incorporating ITIC as the morphology regulator, which could also support the increased FF values of the ternary OPVs.46
The morphology of the binary and ternary blend films was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images of the blend films with different ITIC contents are exhibited in Fig. 4. The bright and dark regions in the TEM images represent the donor and acceptor domains, respectively, due to their different electron densities.47–49 Relatively large bright and dark domains can be clearly observed from the TEM image of the J71:BTP-BO-4Cl blend films, which is disadvantageous to exciton dissociation and charge transport. Tiny bright and dark domains can be clearly observed from the TEM image of the J71:ITIC blend films, which is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the J71:ITIC blend films. It is apparent that the morphology of the blend films can be markedly adjusted by incorporating ITIC as the third component, as observed from the TEM images of the blend films. The phase separation of the blend films can be gradually optimized by increasing the ITIC content, which can be confirmed from the calculated exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. The gradually optimized phase separation of the ternary blend films well agrees with the increased FFs of the ternary OPVs along with the increase in the ITIC content in the acceptors.

Conclusions
In summary, efficient ternary OPVs were achieved with J71 as the donor and ITIC:BTP-BO-4Cl (60:40, wt/wt) as the acceptor, exhibiting a PCE of 13.65% along with the JSC of 21.33 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.912 V and FF of 70.31%. The performance improvement of the ternary OPVs should be mainly attributed to the well optimized phase separation of the active layers with 60 wt% ITIC in the acceptors, resulting in a significant increase in FF from 57.79% to 70.31%. The gradually increased VOCs of ternary OPVs were achieved by incorporating ITIC, which can be well explained by the slightly high LUMO levels of ITIC compared with that of BTP-BO-4Cl. In fact, the increased VOC and FF of the optimized ternary OPVs can well compensate for the slightly decreased JSC of the ternary OPVs. Over 17% improvement in PCE can be achieved by employing the ternary strategy; this indicates that the ternary strategy can be an efficient method to improve the performance of OPVs with simple device fabrication.
