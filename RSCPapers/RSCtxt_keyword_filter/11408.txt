    , Accepted 3rd August 2018First published on 6th August 2018AbstractTwo fullerene/non-fullerene hybrids were designed and synthesized for polymer solar cells as small molecule acceptors. Polymer solar cells based on J71:A2 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.52% with the open circuit voltage at nearly 1.0 V. The success of the hybrids may pave a new way for small molecule acceptors.
A significant breakthrough has been made in the last two decades in the development of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the advantages of light weight, easy process, flexibility and low cost.1–6 In the traditional PSCs, conjugated polymers are used as p-type materials (donor) and fullerene derivatives as n-type materials (acceptor) in the photoactive layer. Fullerene derivatives as acceptors are still positioned as the yardstick for an in-depth understanding of charge generation and recombination due to their high electron mobility and electron affinity.7 However, there are many drawbacks for fullerene acceptors such as poor absorption in the visible region and the difficulty in adjusting the energy levels.8–10 In addition, due to large energy loss, fullerene acceptors face a great challenge in further improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE).11,12 This has motivated chemists to develop new acceptor materials for further advancement of PSCs.
Recently, a kind of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) containing altered donor–acceptor structures has begun to garner increasing attention.13,14 In these structures, the absorption and energy levels can be tuned through the intramolecular charge transfer interaction and the internal donor–acceptor polarization. Numerous works have been focused on the development of NFAs based on an electron-donating extended fused ring as the core and electron-withdrawing groups as the end groups.15–18 These acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type NFAs can be easily synthesized and purified. Zhan and co-workers designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor, named ITIC, which introduced a bulky seven-ring fused core (indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (IDTT) and was end-capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IDM) groups.8 ITIC possesses a strong and broad absorption from 500 nm to 800 nm and appropriate energy levels matched with poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th). PSCs based on ITIC and PTB7-Th blended films exhibited a PCE of 6.80%. After the success of ITIC, considerable modifications of ITIC on the core, side chains and end groups were employed to further enhance the photovoltaic performance.19–22 Up to now, PSCs based on NFAs have achieved a PCE of over 13% through continuous efforts in material design and device engineering.23,24
Chemists now have realized that high efficiency NFAs require a balance between solubility, aggregation tendency, electron mobility and molecular miscibility with donors in addition to energy levels and absorption. However, at the current stage, both fullerene derivatives and non-fullerene small molecule acceptors show characteristics fulfilling some of the requirements and limitations in other aspects. So even though small molecule acceptors have achieved great progress, the next generation of small molecule acceptors still need to be developed to overcome the bottleneck of PSCs. Based on the above considerations, we designed and synthesized two PCBM/ITIC hybrids, named A1 and A2 (Scheme 1), with the intention of combining the optoelectronic properties of PCBM and ITIC. C60 was employed as one of the terminal acceptor units for the two hybrids to enhance the absorption at 300–500 nm. On the other hand, the bulk C60 unit may help keep the distance of the donor and acceptor to control the aggregation and reduce charge carrier recombination. The two hybrids introduced the fused ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) and IDTT as the core, respectively. The linear conjugation unit linked to C60 could guarantee the solubility and enhance the compatibility of the donor and acceptor materials, which may benefit the formation of nanoscale interpenetrating networks. Further modifications on the fused ring and terminal group of the linear conjugation part make it possible to broaden the absorption and tune the energy levels as well as the morphology for improving the photovoltaic performance of the acceptor materials.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of A1 and A2. 
The synthesis routes of the intermediates and final products are shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† The detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations are also exhibited in the ESI.† The intermediates 2/4 were obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction using 1/3 and IDM as starting materials, respectively. The target products A1/A2 were synthesized by refluxing C60-fullerene, N-methyl glycene and 2/4 in toluene, respectively. A1 and A2 were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF and elemental analysis. The two compounds have good solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform and toluene. As shown in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†), both A1 and A2 exhibited a good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures over 300 °C. The absorption spectra of A1 and A2 in chloroform (Fig. S2, ESI†) and thin films (Fig. 1a) were measured (Table 1). In solution, A1 and A2 both showed absorption in the range of 300–500 nm and 500–800 nm. The absorption in the high-energy region can be attributed to fullerene, while the low-energy absorption arises from the intramolecular interaction between the core and IDM. The absorption of the two hybrids obviously combines the absorption characteristics of fullerene and ITIC. When compared with the absorption in solution, the absorption of A1 and A2 in films displays redshifts of 26 and 48 nm, respectively, owing to the intermolecular stacking interaction. The absorption of A2 is much stronger than that of A1 from 550 nm to 750 nm owing to the stronger electron-donating ability of the central core in A2, which is useful for harvesting light. The optical band-gaps of A1 and A2 calculated from the absorption in films are 1.55 and 1.61 eV, respectively.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of A1 and A2 were determined via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†) and calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels of A1 and A2 are estimated to be −5.15/−3.73 and −5.37/−3.67 eV, respectively. This reflects that A2 possesses upshifted LUMO levels relative to A1. The higher LUMO levels of A2 as an acceptor may lead to enhanced Voc in photovoltaic performance relative to the optoelectronic device based on A1. The electron mobilities (μe) of A1 and A2 (Fig. S4, ESI†) were measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/A1 or A2/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al.25 The electron mobilities of A1 and A2 were estimated to be 3.54 × 10−5 and 9.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher electron mobility of A2 may benefit charge transport and reduce charge carrier recombination.
Density functional theory (DFT) was applied to analyze the distribution of energy levels for the two molecules (Fig. 1c and d). The LUMO energy levels of A1 and A2 are mainly located on the fullerene unit. However, the HOMO energy levels of A1 are mainly distributed on the IDT and thiophene units while those of A2 are on the IDTT unit. This may hint that photoinduced charge transfer occurred from the core to the fullerene unit. On the other hand, the value of the dihedral angle between IDM and thiophene is 0.25° for A1 while the dihedral angle between IDM and IDTT is as large as 16° for A2 (Fig. S5, ESI†). Obviously, the thiophene spacer in A1 reduces the intramolecular twisting between the IDT and IDM units. This indicates that the introduction of thiophene may influence the π–π stacking and lead to different aggregation behaviours.
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of A1 and A2 as acceptors, BHJ PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71:acceptor/PDINO/Al were fabricated and measured under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), where PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate). J71 was chosen as a donor due to its complementary absorption with the acceptors (Fig. S6, ESI†). The optimal PCEs were obtained when the weight ratio of J71:acceptor was 1:1 and with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive treatment. The J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2. The PSCs made from J71 and A1 yielded a Jsc of 5.71 mA cm−2 and FF of 29.57%. However, when the acceptor was replaced with A2, the Jsc and FF increased dramatically to 11.63 mA cm−2 and 39.63%, respectively. Thus, the PCE was improved from 1.63% for J71:A1 to 4.52% for J71:A2. This may hint that the morphology is more favorable in the active layer of the device based on J71 and A2. Notably, both of the devices obtained a high Voc of nearly 1.0 V. The Voc of the devices based on the hybrids is higher than those of the devices with PC61BM and ITIC as acceptor materials, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). Estimated from the equation of Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc,26 the energy loss of the devices based on A1 and A2 was 0.58 and 0.63 eV, respectively. The low energy loss was related to the suppressed nonradiative recombination losses due to the low optical band-gaps in films and high voltages of the devices.

The EQE curves (Fig. 2b) of PSCs based on J71/A1 and J71/A2 both exhibited a wide photoresponse in the region of 300–800 nm. The maximum EQE values of A2 were as high as 60%, two times higher than that of A1 (30%). The higher EQE values of A2 suggested that the photons absorbed by the acceptors were more efficiently converted into electrons. Besides, the integrated Jsc values were in agreement with the values obtained from J–V curves.
The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the optimal active layers were also measured using the SCLC method to evaluate the charge transport property. The fitted curves are shown in Fig. 2c and d and the μh and μe are summarized in Table 2. The hole and electron mobilities of J71:A1 are 3.41 × 10−5 and 1.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The blended film of J71:A2 showed a relatively higher μh (1.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (5.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). A smaller ratio of the hole to electron mobility (μh/μe) was obtained for J71:A2 (2.36) than that of J71:A1 (2.84). The higher μh and μe and more balanced μh/μe of the A2 based device can be attributed to the improvement of charge transport and collection, thus leading to a higher Jsc and FF.
The morphologies of the optimal active layers were measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 3. The two acceptors both show a good miscibility with J71, which is essential for practical use in PSCs. The J71:A1 film exhibits a rough surface with the root-mean-square (RMS) value of 0.68 nm while the J71:A2 film shows a smooth and uniform morphology with a smaller RMS value of 0.49 nm. This indicates that a more homogeneously distributed morphology is formed in the active layer of the A2 based device, which will enhance exciton dissociation. The rough surface for the blends of J71 and A1 may indicate large domain size and phase separation. The distinct variation in the morphology may result from the different aggregation behaviour due to the change in the chemical structures of the acceptors.

In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, ternary organic solar cells based on PTB7-Th:A1/A2:PC71BM were prepared. The related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). After adding 20% A1 into PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the PCE was improved from 8.28% to 9.25%. Similarly, when the weight ratio of PTB7-Th:A2:PC71BM was 0.9:0.1:1.5, the PCE was increased by 8.75%. The PCEs were effectively enhanced by fabricating ternary organic solar cells.
In summary, two PCBM/ITIC hybrids as small molecule acceptors (A1 and A2) based on C60 and IDM as terminal groups were designed, synthesized and characterized. A1 and A2 used IDT and IDTT as the core, respectively. The absorption of the two acceptors combined the absorption properties of PC61BM and ITIC. Compared to A1, A2 possesses a stronger absorption ability, higher LUMO energy level and higher electron mobility. As a result, PSCs based on J71 and A2 achieved a PCE of 4.52% with Voc of 0.98 V and Jsc of 11.63 mA cm−2, respectively. The PCE is among the best results for fullerene and non-fullerene hybrids reported so far. The devices based on A1 and A2 both obtained a low voltage loss (0.58 eV for A1 and 0.63 eV for A2). This work may pave the way in the design of hybrid small molecule acceptors for PSCs. More work on the optimization of the hybrids is under way in our laboratory and further improvement of the PCEs may be realized in the near future.
