1. Introduction
The development of electrochemical energy storage devices with prominent performance or special features has always been a hot research topic to meet the requirement of the rapid advances of electronics over decades.1,2 Flexible energy storage devices are currently dominating this research area due to the rise of wearable electronics and medical implants, which are much more challenging than the conventional devices as electrochemical properties are no longer the only concern.3,4 An ideal flexible energy storage device should be able to withstand various levels of deformation like stretching, bending, or even compressing that the wearables may encounter during practice, and yet remain stable and durable in their electrochemical properties. To achieve this, components in the device including electrodes, electrolyte, separator, and current collectors should be soft and compatible with each other in terms of both electrochemical and mechanical properties to prevent the degradation of electrochemical efficiency caused by delamination of components during movement.
Electrolytes are one of the most important components in energy storage devices since they are responsible for ionic transportation within the device and to a great extent, determine the performance of the device including cycling stability, electrochemical stable potential window (ESPW) and ionic conductivity. However, traditional liquid electrolytes have revealed their unsuitability in playing a role in flexible wearables by their reported potential hazards such as leakage problems and fast evaporation of the electrolyte materials.5,6 The constrains of liquid electrolyte, in turn, fostered the development of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). GPEs contain immobilized liquid electrolyte in the host composed of one or more polymer matrices. Different from solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) or liquid electrolytes, GPEs generally possess better mechanical integrity than liquid electrolytes, and more desirable ionic conductivity than the SPEs, and separators are not needed as they could act as electrolyte and separator at the same time. Besides, since narrow operation voltage of aqueous electrolyte has been a hindrance for the development of high-energy density batteries, the incorporation of polymers can reduce the amount of free water, and thus widen the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) window.
However, GPEs are not perfect. On the road to the development of flexible energy storage devices, GPEs have been facing plenty of challenges such as low mechanical strength with insufficient crosslinking,7 poor interface between electrodes and electrolyte under mechanical strains,8,9 and the potential loss of electrochemical performance upon bending or stretching.10 These issues severely limit the flexibility or performance of the energy storage devices using GPEs, and have to be overcome in order to obtain high performance GPEs in flexible energy storage technologies.
In this review, challenges and the corresponding solutions of GPEs in flexible energy storage devices will be highlighted. Additionally, strategies to improve the performance of the GPEs are covered. For instance, ultra-tough/stretchable self-healing GPEs,11–14 the ‘all-in-one’ design,15 and the GPEs with superb electrochemical performance by modifying the fabrication method or material choice7,16 will be explored. In the latter part of the sections, GPEs with additional functions such as electrochromic properties14,17,18 and extreme temperature tolerance19–23 will be reviewed. Finally, the existing challenges and the prospect of GPEs development will be discussed.
2. Materials selection for hydrogels and additives/fabrication strategy
Hydrogels constitute networks of hydrophilic polymers, which enabled it to store high volume ratio of water within the framework. With the aid of crosslinking among the polymer chains, the hydrogel can absorb more than 800% of water without dissolving.
Since hydrogel have shown high modifiability in terms of properties by various molecular designs, they have been widely applied in plenty of research fields such as tissue engineering,24 soft robotics,25 pressure sensing devices26,27 and ionotronic devices28 with the desired characteristics. When hydrogels are applied in energy storage devices like supercapacitors and batteries, the first and foremost required feature is high ionic conductivity. In this aspect, hydrogels prevail over other solid materials as they can hold a large amount of ionic solution within the polymer matrix, which enables satisfying conductivity and dimensional stability of the device.
Hydrogels are generally composed of polymers with hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, and amino groups. These water-loving functional groups help in terms of water storage and structural integrity by the weak physical hydrogen bond. The typical hydrogel host polymer and their features are listed in Table 1. Besides the commonly used synthetic polymers like PVA and PAAm, biopolymers have been gaining attention in recent years as environmental benignity has become one of the biggest concerns in sustainable development. Polymer extracted from nature such as cellulose, chitosan, chitin, and alginate were frequently adopted in research of eco-friendly devices due to their abundance and biodegradability.29–31 In particular, a micro-supercapacitor was developed using sodium alginate as a bio-hydrogel electrolyte by Guo et al.32 The concentrated Na-alginate hydrogel outperformed the commonly used PVA/H2SO4 hydrogel by allowing a much wider operating voltage window to 1.6 V than 0–1 V of PVA/H2SO4 hydrogel when tested as a symmetric micro-supercapacitor with MoO3−x nanorods as the active material of electrodes. Moreover, the Na-alginate hydrogel electrolyte delivered better cycling stability due to its neutral properties instead of the acid gel electrolyte.32 These studies with natural polymers have shown their advantage and opened the gate for eco-friendly development for hydrogel applications.

The mechanical properties of hydrogels depend greatly on the crosslinking methods, which can be generally categorized into permanent crosslinking (such as covalent bond) and reversible crosslinking with hydrogen bond, ionic bond, hydrophobic association, or chain entanglement. Although hydrogels formed with the abovementioned linkages exhibit mechanical properties at a certain level, it is still far beyond the requirement in toughness and elasticity for wearable applications. Hence, to maximize the strength of the hydrogel, the double-network (DN) structure is one of the most adopted approaches to produce hydrogel with robust strength yet retaining its softness by dissipating energy through reversible connections. For instance, a DN PAAm/carrageenan hydrogel was synthesized, and the combination of both covalent and ionic crosslinking enabled the hydrogel to be stretched to 20-fold of its original length and demonstrated a high fracture energy of ∼9500 J m−2.33
Besides mechanical robustness, other desired properties can also be adjusted in order to achieve the demands for specific applications. For the boomingly developed flexible electronics, durability is the foremost important criterion as they are expected to withstand deformation during practical usage. In view of this, researchers have taken a step further, to endow the hydrogels with self-healing ability so that they can be returned to their original status and make their contribution again. Self-healing is a process that generally involves reversible bond within the hydrogel, which allows the re-connection of molecular chains upon contact (sometimes accelerated with the assistance of external energy). The common interaction includes hydrogen bond, ionic bond, supramolecular and hydrophobic bond.34 Therefore, PVA is one of the most used polymer hosts for developing self-healing hydrogel as it has abundant –OH groups, which enhance the hydrogen bond between polymer chains. However, hydrogels healed merely by the non-covalent interactions are usually unsatisfying in terms of mechanical properties despite the rapid recovery. The combination with supplementary force is required for robust self-healing hydrogel.35 As shown in Fig. 1a–c, when PVA was copolymerized with agarose and crosslinked with the presence of a strong dynamic covalent bond (borate bond), the hydrogel can be healed in 10 s and the strength was 100% recovered.36 This research has demonstrated the synergic effect between strong dynamic borate bond (that enables rapid self-healing property) and hydrogen bond (that helps to maintain the structure of the hydrogel).

Apart from deformation, conventional hydrogels have been challenged by their functionality under extreme temperatures. Due to the significant water content of hydrogel, freezing is the least desired phenomenon that happens at sub-zero temperatures as it causes loss in flexibility and strength. Solutions corresponding to this obstacle have been raised by researchers by either reducing the water concentration in the hydrogel or strengthening the intermolecular force among water molecules. The former can be achieved by introducing EG into the polymer matrix to inhibit the formation of ice crystal lattice37 and the latter can be accomplished by imbibing the hydrogel with concentrated solution so that the freezing point of the hydrogel can be lowered by the dominating macromolecular forces. As reported by Zheng et al.,38 the concentration of KOH was found to be critical regarding the hydrogel mechanical properties. As visually demonstrated in Fig. 1d and e, by increasing the concentration of KOH to 5 M, the PAMPS hydrogel could remain flexible and achieved peak ionic conductivity at −20 °C, which shows the possibility of tunable properties related to ion concentration.
Besides the ordinary features, controlling chromatic properties of hydrogels has attracted the interests of researchers due to its vast potential applications such as smart windows and strain sensors. Chromatic transition is a process that leads to the change in the colours of a substance, which can be induced by applying voltage, differed temperature, and pressure. Meng et al.39 have developed an electrochromic hydrogel with PNIPAm that can undergo phase transition from a highly transparent state to a private state with zero-transmission. Such excellent performance relied on the combination of the thermo-responsiveness of PNIPAm adjusted by the concentration of LiClO4, combining with the electrochromic WO3 film so that two private states with white scattered light transmitted and zero transmission dark state can be achieved.39
Quasi-solid hydrogel electrolytes create infinite possibilities of electrochemical energy storage devices in terms of their features. The abovementioned works offer a few glimpses of overcoming the limitations of GPEs by material choice and fabrication strategies, also revealed the potential of multifunctional energy storage devices. In the following section, the recent application of hydrogel in supercapacitors and batteries will be discussed in detail.
3. Hydrogel electrolytes for supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are generally categorized into two types, pseudocapacitor and electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC), according to their charge storage mechanisms. Pseudocapacitor stores energy through the faradaic reactions of the electrode materials (mostly metal oxides and conductive polymers) while EDLC stores energy through the electrostatic interaction of the charges between the electrolyte and the electrode (mostly carbon or its derivatives).8,40–42 These two types of supercapacitors can also be combined as the hybrid supercapacitor that performs more outstandingly than its original component by coupling of redox materials and carbon-based materials as electrodes.43 Electrolyte is critical in a supercapacitor as it determines the capacitance and operating voltage of a supercapacitor.22 To pursue excellence in all-round performance, gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are getting attention for flexible or wearable electronics. Among them, hydrogel electrolytes are being extensively studied for their high ionic conductivity, intrinsically favorable mechanical properties and the simplicity of fabrication. Moreover, appealing features have been added to the hydrogel electrolytes to enable vast possibilities in smart electronics. In this section, the recent progress of developing hydrogel polymer electrolytes for supercapacitors will be discussed. The typical performances and the additional functions of the supercapacitors are summarized in Tables 2–5 and 6 respectively.

3.1 Hydrogel electrolyte for EDLCs
Typical hydrogels are usually soft, or even weak when absorbed large amount of water. This is not favorable as GPEs for flexible electronics as they may not be able to withstand deformation and ultimately lead to severe performance degradation. Hence, improving mechanical properties has been one of the most significant issues of GPEs design and development. The ultra-tough GPEs are usually reinforced by auxiliary physical bonding such as ionic bond so that energy can be dissipated by the reversible sacrificial bond. PAAm has often been used as one of the networks in such structure.7,9,44–46 For example, Zhi et al.46 reported an extremely tough dual-network GPE with covalently crosslinked PAAm and ionically crosslinked alginate by Al3+. The combination of the two networks has effectively improved the toughness of the hydrogel and thus it can act as the protection layer between the electrodes. The assembled supercapacitor can withstand fierce mechanical stresses like being stepped on for 6 days and being run-over by 50 cars consecutively for 1 hour. Such mechanical robustness was achieved by the recoverable ionic network that could effectively dissipate energy and the large hysteresis with neglectable permanent deformation. It endows the Al-alginate/PAAm hydrogel with a tensile modulus of 429.8 kPa and allows the gel to be completely compressed without visible cracks. More surprisingly, the reported Al-alginate/PAAm hydrogel possesses anti-cut property. As shown in Fig. 2, a 10 mm-thick gel was cut with a blade without leading to any damage, which shows its super effective energy dissipation ability. In terms of electrochemical properties, the Al-alginate/PAAm GPE delivered high ionic conductivity of 29 mS cm−1 due to the high solution content of the as-prepared gel. The ion transport capability can be retained even being 50% compressed or 100% stretched. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves have also proved the stability of Al-alginate/PAAm GPE by showing capacitance close to the initial one under different levels of deformations.

Lately, hydrophobic association was applied in hydrogels as a physical crosslinking method, a dual network agar/hydrophobically associated polyacrylamide (HPAAm) GPE was reported by Zhi et al.44 The energy dissipating agar bundles allow the GPE to restore its original size after being repeatedly stretched up to 500%. Besides dimensions stability, the ionic conductivity of the agar/HPAAm was also retained at 2 S cm−1 after 5000 stretching cycles, which suggested its suitability for the practical application.
The preceding works have demonstrated fabricating high-strength hydrogel electrolyte with dual-network (DN) structure and showed the remarkable electrochemical performance of the DN GPEs. In addition to the dual-network structure, there are some other approaches to fabricate GPEs with extraordinary strength. For instance, Wang et al.45 presented a crystal-type composite gel with NaAc salt, AAm monomer and 3-dimethyl ammonium propane sulfonate (DMAPS) as an electrolyte for supercapacitor. The crystallization of the highly concentrated salt solution in the precursor mixture was initiated by the small particle seed on the surface of the hydrogel. In Fig. 3, it could be observed that the compression modulus increases when the mass ratio of NaAc salt was increased, and a maximum compression modulus of 474.24 MPa was achieved when 1.6 wt% of NaAc was added, although with less toughness, which indicated that the crystal structure is beneficial in enhancing compression strength. Not only the enhanced compressive strength, the NaAc crystal also endowed the crystal-type hydrogel with extreme temperature tolerance from −40 to 80 °C by the dissolution–crystallization transition.

(c) Compression modulus of the NaAc crystal gel of 10 cycles from 20 °C to 80 °C. Adapted with permission from ref. 45. Copyright 2019 John Wiley and Sons. 
On the other hand, delamination during deformation is one of the most neglected issues, which could be possibly caused by the weak adhesion between electrodes and the gel electrolyte or the strain mismatch of two materials. This problem was noticed by Xie et al.9 and they have therefore developed a skin-inspired surface-microstructured tough agar/polyacrylamide (AG/PAAm) hydrogel electrolyte by simply roughening the hydrogel surface and subsequently coating a layer of activated carbon. The microstructured hydrogel surface facilitated the ionic conductivity by demonstrating a decrease in charge transfer resistance (from 3.4 Ω to 1.4 Ω) compared with the pristine one. Even after 500 cycles of stretching, the ionic conductivity of the AG/PAAm gel was not affected and 80% of the capacitance could be retained over 6000 GCD cycles at a current of 1.25 A g−1. Therefore, the proposed AG/PAAm GPE with stable performance upon stretching has provided a new skill for fabricating highly stretchable supercapacitors with stable interfaces.
Apart from enhancing the interface between GPE and electrodes, merging the components can be an alternative. Yin et al.15 have fabricated an all-in-one supercapacitor by coating a layer of polypyrrole on the surface of a PVA–H2SO4 hydrogel by strong hydrogen bond. The resulted ‘all-in-one’ hydrogel demonstrated excellence in mechanical properties by preventing delamination upon 70% compressive strain, 110% tensile strain and 180° twisting. The integration of electrodes and electrolyte can improve not only the flexibility but also the electrochemical performance. Since the polypyrrole electrode layer has tightly adhered onto the PVA–H2SO4 electrolyte surface, the areal capacitance retained 48 mF cm−1 (96% of the original areal capacitance) under 70% compressive strain and shown exceptional cycling stability by 97% retention of areal capacitance after 10000 cycles. This special ‘all-in-one’ structure endowed the supercapacitors with extra flexibility and softness, suggesting their potential application in skin-tight wearables.

3.1.1 Multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte for flexible EDLCs. 
As mentioned above, researchers have been devoted to developing high-performance flexible supercapacitors that could survive under severe conditions in order to fit the practical requirement of the users. In addition to high strength, flexible GPEs were endowed with self-healing ability so that the lifespan of the device could be prolonged automatically after deformation. Similar to the ultra-tough hydrogel, most of the self-healable hydrogels are fabricated based on DN structures, so that the reversible bonding can be used for dissipating energy or re-construction to achieve self-healing effect. Some of the self-healing processes require external energy sources such as heating and irradiating. With the aid of such stimuli, the healing process is generally more rapid.47,48
For example, Chen et al.47 produced a nanocomposite hydrogel by copolymerizing 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm) with LAPONITE® and graphene oxide (GO) as crosslinkers. A supercapacitor was assembled by attaching two CNT films on both sides of the pre-stretched (900% strain) hydrogel electrolyte. The synthesized GPE shows an intrinsic stretchability of 1173% and tensile strength of 34 kPa. With the presence of GO, the photothermal property of the gel was enhanced and it can be healed within 20 min by either infrared light irradiation or heating, which promote the re-crosslinking between poly(DMAAm-co-AMPS) chains and the crosslinkers. Unlike the traditional planar flexible supercapacitor with flat layers, this assembling method exhibited higher capacitance when being stretched from 0 to 800% tensile strain due to the increased contact area between electrodes and electrolyte when the wrinkled CNT film was flattened. Apart from stretchability, this structure can also enhance the healing quality by providing large surface areas for contact during healing. It allows the recovered supercapacitors to withstand a tensile strain at 900% like the freshly prepared gel, and only 15% of capacitance was lost.
To achieve speedy self-healing, zwitterions can be employed in the GPEs for their static interaction. Liu et al.,49 fabricated a self-healable polyampholyte hydrogel electrolyte P(AA–DAC) by copolymerizing with acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DAC) with the addition of lithium chloride anhydrous salt. The P(AA–DAC) hydrogel performed fast recovery after damage intrinsically due to its supramolecular interaction. The storage modulus and loss modulus can be recovered to the original value after being stretched under 100 to 800% strain within 10 seconds. More interestingly, it was found that electrolytes in thermodynamic equilibrium state deliver the highest ionic conductivity due to the full expansion of P(AA–DAC) chains and the dissociation of water molecules. The supercapacitor assembled with the P(AA–DAC) GPE exhibited high areal specific capacitance of 297 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.8 mA cm−2, in which 70% of the capacitance can be retained after 7000 charge/discharge cycles.
In addition to superior mechanical properties, hydrogel electrolytes have surpassed traditional aqueous electrolyte by the capability of working under extreme temperatures. Resistance to extreme temperature is crucial because the formation of ice or evaporation of solvent is likely to deteriorate the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, researchers have been developing extreme temperature resisting hydrogel electrolytes in order to overcome this problem. Ethylene glycol (EG) is commonly used as one of the solvents in the extreme-temperature resistant hydrogel formation owing to its low-temperature resistance.22,50 Liu et al.50 fabricated the PVA-based low-temperature tolerant GPE by using H2O/EG as a dispersion medium, and the effect of different H2O/EG ratio was studied. It was discovered that the best anti-freezing property of organohydrogel electrolyte can be achieved by using 33.3% EG and 66.6% water as it possesses the highest capacitance retention from room temperature to −40 °C.
Although free water was considered an essential component in GPEs for enhanced ionic conductivity, the decomposition of free water is the major cause for narrow ESPW, which greatly limits the energy density of the supercapacitors. Therefore, the free water in GPEs should be reduced or immobilized to maximize the compatibility between GPEs and high-performance electrodes. For instance, the concept of water-in-salt electrolytes could be utilized in GPEs. With this method, the operating voltage window could be widened and at the same time, the ionic conductivity can remain high due to the abundance of the ions.

3.2 Hydrogel electrolytes for pseudocapacitors or hybrid capacitors
For pseudocapacitors, redox reaction taking place at the electrode surface acts as the fundamental process for energy storage. In the work of Zeng et al., PEDOT and redox couple were introduced at the electrode–electrolyte interface. It endowed the supercapacitor with prominent specific capacitance (232 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1), energy density (3.6 μW h cm−2) and long cycle life (over 5000 cycles). At the same time, the use of double-network PAAm/sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel electrolyte for the all-hydrogel supercapacitor enabled the supercapacitor to be easily stretched to 2400% strain and achieve compressive stress of 952 kPa at 90% compressive strain.55
The redox reaction at the electrode surface can be facilitated by employing redox mediator that gives fast and reversible redox reaction, which contributes to pseudocapacitance and improve ionic conductivity concurrently. Hydroquinone (HQ),41,56 phenylenediamine57 and phosphomolybdic acid40 are reported as effective redox mediators that can be used for enhancing the properties of hydrogel electrolyte by researchers. Jayalekshmi et al.56 adopted HQ as a redox mediator in the PVA–KOH–HQ GPE film. It was discovered that PVA–KOH hydrogel become fully amorphous after adding HQ based on the result from X-ray diffraction (XRD); while the maximum ionic conductivity of 53 mS cm−1 was obtained for 0.2 g of HQ content as the ionic transportation is favored by the segmental motion of amorphous polymer. The supercapacitor assembled with PVA–KOH–HQ also delivered satisfactory energy density and power density are 5 W h kg−1 and 689.58 W kg−1 respectively.
A zinc-ion hybrid capacitor using ZnSO4/PAA hydrogel as electrolyte was fabricated by Chen et al.16 A uniform layer of Zn act as the battery type electrode and a rGO/CNT composite fibre was the capacitor type-positive electrode. The use of ZnSO4/PAA GPE exhibits better electrochemical performance than the commonly used ZnSO4/PVA hydrogel electrolyte. The ZnSO4/PAA electrolyte was fabricated with a facile method of radical polymerization of PAA hydrogel, followed by soaking in 2 M ZnSO4 solution until equilibrium, which is dually crosslinked by the inherent covalent bond of PAA chains and the hydrogen bond among the PAA chains. The double network structure of the ZnSO4/PAA GPE allows it to be stretched up to 2500% strain at a maximum tensile stress of 250.1 kPa. PAA is rich in hydrophilic –COOH groups that can trap water including dissolved Zn2+ within the hydrogel. This characteristic greatly facilitates the ionic conductivity of the ZnSO4/PAA GPE to 21.7 mS cm−1, which is more than ten times higher than that of ZnSO4/PVA GPE (2.0 mS cm−1) according to their experimental result. The high compatibility between ZnSO4/PAA GPE and the electrodes delivered superb cycling stability, and the capacitance of the assembled capacitor remained at 98% after 10000 charging/discharging cycles. More surprisingly, the electrochemical properties could be maintained even under elongation, and the ionic conductivity of the ZnSO4/PAA GPE could be retained at 19.8 mS cm−1 even being stretched under 250% elongation, which demonstrated its ability in being adopted in wearable electronics.16

3.2.1 Multifunctional hydrogel electrolytes for flexible pseudocapacitors. 
Hydrogel electrolytes in flexible supercapacitors with additional functions are gaining more attention due to their potential in versatile applications in smart devices. Apart from charge carrying, novel hydrogel electrolytes have been designed with multifunction such as self-healing ability, responsiveness to stimuli, and resistance to extreme conditions in order to fit the trend of fast-developing smart electronics.
A PVA-based heat-healing hydrogel was fabricated with a facile method of physically mixing in room temperature by Hou et al.,58 forming a tough hydrogel by the synergistic effect of NaCl and glycerol on PVA. The increase of NaCl concentration induces the ‘salting out’ effect that facilitates the entanglement of PVA chains. The PVA chains can then be crosslinked by forming hydrogen bond with glycerol. It was discovered that the addition of NaCl can effectively enhance both the strength (0.57 MPa of tensile strength and 575% elongation at break) and the ionic conductivity (92.5 mS cm−1) of the PVA–NaCl–glycerol hydrogel. Moreover, the hydrogel demonstrated excellent heat healing ability by the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds, and the healed hydrogel can recover to 70% and 95% of the original strain and stress of the as-prepared sample.
However, temperature or irradiation-induced self-healing processes are sometimes inconvenient since the healing process has to be initiated passively. Therefore, self-healing process carried out under ambient conditions is of great interest and has been extensively studied. The spontaneous self-healing abilities are commonly achieved by the recovery of hydrogen bond upon recontact,2,11–13,59–62 and the efficiency can be further boosted by employing different molecular designs. For instance, Zhou's team63 applied hydrophobic interaction of the disassociated dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid micelles to fabricate the self-healable PAA-based GPE for supercapacitors. Polyacrylic acid/octadecyl methacrylate (PAA/OMA) hydrogel was incorporated into a vinyl treated sponge as S-PAA hydrogel by strong covalent bond. The as-prepared hydrogel manifested maximum strength of 2.2 MPa. Once the hydrogel was cut and reconnected, the polymer chains aggregate at the fracture interface induced by the interaction with the dissociative micelle, and the S-PAA hydrogel was healed without visible linkage tail in 30 minutes in room temperature. It shows only 23% loss in strength after healing. The supercapacitor assembled with the S-PAA hydrogel shows capacitance of 368 F g−1 at 0.1 mA and there is no loss in capacitance observed from the healed hydrogel.
Besides, swift-healing GPE can also be achieved by using strong reversible interaction instead of conventional hydrogen bond. A borax-crosslinked zinc-salt containing PVA/nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) hydrogel was fabricated by Wong et al.64 Borax in this GPE plays an important role in enabling the dynamic association between PVA and NFC, this reversible crosslinking between B(OH)4 and hydroxyls greatly reduced the healing time to 20 s or less without visible cracks. It was used as the electrolyte for a zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor, which achieved a high specific capacity of 56.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2, and exhibited extraordinary capacitance retention of 95.3% after 5000 cycles.64 In addition, GPE crosslinked with ionic interactions can also achieve exceptional performances.10,65 For example, a tear-resistant all-in-one supercapacitor was fabricated by Tang et al.65 using polyacrylate hydrogel (PAA@Co2+) as electrolyte and PANI as gel electrodes. Metal coordination was found between AA and Co2+, which contributed to the dynamic chemical interactions within the hydrogel components and ensures a stable interface between electrodes and electrolyte. The cut PAA@Co2+ hydrogel electrolyte can recover to its original configuration in 5 min without external stimuli. The supercapacitor built with the PAA@Co2+ GPE shows enhanced specific capacitance of 162 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with almost no degradation after being bent, stretched, and self-healed.
Meanwhile, a polyacrylic acid hydrogel electrolyte crosslinked by Fe3+ (Fe3+–PAA) has shown more than self-healing ability. The as-assembled supercapacitor with the PAA-based GPE can be self-charged by harvesting electrical energy during mechanical deformation driven by triboelectric effect, and the energy can be stored as electrochemical energy for power supply.66 As shown in Fig. 4, the supercapacitor consists of four main components, including the high-performance triboelectric nanogenerators, the triboelectric friction layers, magnetic electrodes, and the PAA-based hydrogel electrolyte. Electron transfer within the triboelectric friction layers is triggered upon compression and is transformed into electrochemical energy that stores in positive and negative electrodes that can be charged up to 1.6 V within 31 min under periodic compression. The effective self-healing ability of the assembled supercapacitor was demonstrated. By virtue of the free Fe3+ in the electrolyte, the cut surface can be joined quickly by the ionic association between Fe3+ and the COO− on the PAA backbone. More intriguingly, the positive and negative electrodes are made by coating magnetic graphene oxide on stainless-steel fabric, which allows the instantaneous connection of electrodes after broken, and enables precise alignment of cut surface and facilitates the healing process.66

As mentioned in the previous section, EG was often used as a solvent for extreme-temperature resistant GPEs. For example, Qu et al.20 reported a GPE fabricated with methacrylated graphene oxide (MGO) crosslinked PAAm that works under extreme temperature from −30 °C to 100 °C. The dried MGO–PAAm hydrogel formed by radical polymerization was soaked into a 10 wt% EG/water solution of sulfuric acid as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The as-prepared gel can remain intact and elastic under −30 °C due to the formation of glassy state between EG and water so that ice crystallization below 0 °C was prevented. Similarly, compressibility was retained after heated at 100 °C for 30 min due to the high water retention capacity attributed to the strong EG–water interactions. More surprisingly, 84.7% and 94% of its original specific capacitance can be retained at −30 °C and 100 °C respectively, as shown in Fig. 5d.

In addition to adopting EG/water mixture as solvent, Wang et al.67 applied Hofmeister effect to fabricate a PVA-based GPE with high mechanical safety. Hofmeister effect is commonly known as the effect of salt ions on the solubility of the hydrophilic polymers. As shown in Fig. 5e, the PVA hydrogel was formed using AAm monomer as a precursor mixed with PVA-1788. After polymerization, the as-prepared PVA/PAAm hydrogel was soaked in 5 M (NH4)2SO4 solution. The Hofmeister effect with the existence of (NH4)2SO4 solution has increased the crosslink density of the PVA/PAAm hydrogel and endowed it with superior mechanical performance. The maximum strength of the as-prepared gel reached 44.8 MPa at a strain of 88.3%, and shock-resistant property was demonstrated by being operated normally under hammering. More surprisingly, an unprecedented operating temperature can be achieved by the modified PVA hydrogel. The supercapacitor with the PVA GPE can function at temperatures above −25 °C as shown in Fig. 5f, and the PVA hydrogel possesses ablation resistance that allows it to act as a protective layer that coat on the surface of the supercapacitor and function steadily in butane flame over 1000 °C. Hofmeister effect has enhanced not only the mechanical properties of the PVA-hydrogel, but also the ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivity of the PVA hydrogel can be boosted by reducing the PVA content, and the optimum PVA content of 6% was selected considering the effect to mechanical properties and the satisfactory ionic conductivity of 38.1 mS cm−1.67
In addition to that, hydrogel electrolytes have been endowed with more functions for wider applications in flexible supercapacitor. For instance, Takshi et al.18 developed an electrochromic PANI composite GPE with solar energy harvesting ability using PANI containing PVA hydrogel, in which emeraldine salt (ES) was produced in the presence of ammonium persulfate. Therefore, the ES form of PANI acts as the photoactive material in the gel electrolyte, and the mechanism of the charge storage is explained in the following redox reaction, which shows high stability by retaining more than 99% of capacitance after 1000 cycles in cyclic voltammetry.  
To examine the electrochromic properties, a hybrid device was fabricated by sandwiching the PANI composite gel between two electrodes (a fluorine-doped tin oxide and a porous CNT-based electrode). It was shown that the open circuit voltage across the cell increased from 92 mV (under dark condition) to 137 mV (under light condition) in 400 s. The voltage dropped in the slow rate of 10 mV in 600 s in dark, which shows the energy storage ability for a certain period. More importantly, the energy harvesting ability can be further enhanced by adding dye material to the gel. As shown in Fig. 6, the gel was transparent with 64% transmittance around 564 nm at 0.0 V and instantaneously turned dark with almost zero transmittance at 2.0 V. This study demonstrated a facile production of an electrochromic solar energy harvesting GPE, and its multifunctionality allows it to be widely applied in functional supercapacitors.18

From the above section, the state-of-the-art GPEs for pseudocapacitors were discussed.
It is inspiring that breakthroughs have been made in terms of flexibility, strength and interesting additional functions of supercapacitors. Nevertheless, as a crucial parameter, most of the research here only tested the supercapacitors for 1000 to 8000 cycles. Therefore, prolonged cycling stability could be a key focus for next generation supercapacitors. Also, although the stretchability of the GPEs and the performance of the pseudocapacitors during bending were shown, the electrochemical performance of the GPEs upon stretch were seldom evaluated. For wearable electronics or flexible gadgets, stretching is an inevitable circumstance during actual application. Therefore, apart from bending, capacitance retention after long cycles of stretching should also be tested to exhibit the durability of the devices.

4. Hydrogel electrolytes for metal-ion batteries
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been dominating the industry for decades due to their unprecedented energy density. Despite their excellent electrochemical performance, researchers are still striving to innovate, and trying to tackle the intrinsic safety issues of Li-ion batteries. Thermo-responsive flame-retardant release and battery shut-down mechanism are the example for the recent advances,69 which pushes the applications of Li-ion batteries to reach new heights. However, Li-ion batteries are still comparatively costly due to the depletion of materials, which arouses the development of alternatives such as Na-ion batteries, Al-ion batteries and Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs).70 Apart from that, growing interest can be observed for conversion chemistry-based lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries in recent years due to their high specific capacity (1672 mA h g−1) and low price of sulfur.71,72 GPEs were also adopted in Li–S batteries to solve some of the intrinsic problems such as the capacity fades induced by the dissolution of polysulfide. For instance, the shuttle effect has been prevented by adopting polymers with strong chemical adsorption properties73–75 and single-ion conducting GPEs.76 Since the development of flexible Li–S batteries with GPEs are still in its infancy, LIBs and ZIBs will be the focus in this section.
To enable energy storage, metal-ion batteries are generally composed of three basic building blocks: an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte. GPEs can act as electrolyte and separator at the same time. Rechargeable batteries store energy through reversible chemical reactions. During discharge, the anode material is oxidized, and the metal ions migrate from the anode to the cathode and vice versa. The ion flow thus induces the flow of electrons in the circuit and generate energy. Therefore, the compatibility between electrodes and electrolyte is crucial for battery performance.
Apart from electrochemical properties, all kinds of batteries are facing another challenge of the transition from rigid batteries to flexible batteries. To achieve high flexibility that can be repeatedly stretched or deformed, conventional liquid electrolyte is longer adopted due to their instability. Therefore, hydrogels have become the most suitable candidate as they deliver liquid-like ionic conductivity while proving solid mechanical support. Moreover, hydrogel electrolytes have been proved effective to suppress metal dendrite growth of electrodes, which can help to improve battery safety. In this section, the typical properties and application of GPE in different types of batteries will be discussed in detail (Tables 7 and 8). Meanwhile, the additional functions of the batteries will also be discussed and summarized in Table 9.

4.1 Hydrogel electrolytes for flexible Li-ion/Zn-ion batteries
Hydrogels electrolytes were usually functionalized by absorbing salt solution for ion transportation within the polymer matrix. However, water is not always desired in a battery as it leads to narrow stable voltage window and may be evaporated easily, hence affecting the performance of the batteries. This issue was overcome by Niederberger et al.,77 fabricating PAAm GPE with the ‘water-in-salt’ (WiS) approach. The water content in the polymer matrix was replaced by highly concentrated (22 M) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution gradually upon evaporation of water. The as-prepared PAAm-WiS electrolyte shows a broadened working window of 2.98 V (between 1.95 and 4.93 V) compared with conventional aqueous electrolyte because the solvation process of LiTFSI can effectively suppress the decomposition of water. A high ionic conductivity for Li+ of the PAAm-WiS electrolyte of around 10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1 was measured in the temperature range of 20 to 80 °C. Together with its high stretchability of at least 300% strain, it is competent to work as an electrolyte for a flexible Li-ion battery. Moreover, the PAAm-WiS GPE was highly compatible with the LiMn2O4 cathode and the ε-LixV2O5 anode by allowing the redox reaction of the cathode to be carried out as well as under organic solvent. The assembled battery shows a reversible capacity of 28 mA h g−1 when it was stretched to 50%, proving its functionality upon mechanical stress.77
In addition to the above mentioned ‘water-in-salt’ strategy, hydrogel electrolytes with 3D nanostructured have also been investigated by researchers due to its ability to enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes. Yu and his team78,79 have developed a 3D garnet framework polymer electrolyte and a 3D nanostructured hydrogel with Li0.35La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) as nanofiller. Both exhibited enhanced ionic conductivity for high-performance Li-ion batteries. The flexible 3D garnet framework hydrogel electrolyte for a Li-ion battery was fabricated by gelating LLZO precursors (LiNO3, La(NO3)3·6H2O, Zr(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and PVA with glutaraldehyde. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, compared with the nanoparticle-based polymer electrolyte, the 3D garnet framework based polymer electrolyte was highly porous and the garnet branches were interconnected within the framework. A continuous Li+ conduction pathway was constituted and the ionic conductivity can be boosted. According to the test result, the 3D structured GPE demonstrated a high conductivity of 8.5 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is around 6 times higher than that of the nanoparticle-based GPE. Apart from electrochemical ability, the as-prepared 3D structured hydrogel electrolyte also exhibited outstanding physical properties such as high flexibility for being bent and rolled and high thermal stability by remaining intact after heating at 400 °C (as shown in Fig. 7c). The as-mentioned characteristics indicate that the 3D structure can effectively improve the overall performance of a hydrogel electrolyte.79

Developed from primary batteries, rechargeable zinc-ion batteries have been gaining attention due to their promising performance, high safety, and relatively low cost. The application of Zn-ion batteries has been widened by the emergence of flexible batteries, and accordingly, soft yet tough hydrogel polymer electrolytes with superior performance have been developed by researchers. A high-performance zinc-ion yarn battery based on PAAm GPE was developed by Zhi et al.80 It was found that the as-prepared PAAm GPE possesses satisfying tensile strength of 273 kPa and high stretchability up to 3000% strain due to the intrinsic property of PAAm and high ionic conductivity of 17.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The PAAm GPE was combined with yarn electrodes to fabricate a rechargeable Zn/MnO2 battery as illustrated in Fig. 8a and b. The assembled battery delivers a high specific capacity of 302.1 mA h g−1, volumetric energy density of 53.8 mW h cm−3 and excellent cycling stability of retaining 98.5% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at a high current rate of 2 A g−1. It can also remain high capacity under various deformation status as shown in Fig. 8c. More intriguingly, the yarn battery exhibits superior waterproof property by being able to function normally under deionized water for 12 hours continuously while retaining 96.5% of the initial capacity. The yarn structure of the battery has demonstrated its good wearability by its tailorability that can be applied easily in different electronic wearables.80

To achieve high mechanical and electrochemical performance, concentrated solution is often involved during the fabrication of GPEs. Adding concentrated KOH is one of the most used approach due to its facility and effectiveness.81–84 For instance, Zhi et al.82 reported a solid electrolyte with superior electrochemical performance composed of sodium polyacrylate (PANa) hydrogel. The as-synthesized PANa hydrogel exhibited super-absorbency that allows the gel to reach an equilibrium state in one day after absorbing 52 times its weight of the concentrated solution (0.2 M Zn(CH3COO)2 + 6 M KOH). The PANa hydrogel also exhibited high water retention of 97.2% under exposure in the air after 185 hours. Such endowment was verified to be contributed by the strong electrostatic interaction between PANa and water molecules in a salt solution, which could remain the solvent-accessible surface area for PANa at a high level. The combination of the micropores structure and the excellent water retention ability of the polymer has drastically improved the ionic transport. As a result, a high ionic conductivity of 0.17 S cm−1 was achieved. In addition, the negatively charged acrylate ions in the polymer backbone prohibited the growth of zinc dendrite. Therefore, the zinc–air battery with PANa as GPE was able to retain 73% and 65% of the initial capacity after 10000 and 16000 cycles. The ultralong stability of the PANa GPE was indicated. Nevertheless, GPEs with high ionic conductivity is fat from enough as a competent candidate for novel flexible batteries, unless they are equipped with extraordinary mechanical properties. As a brief summary, the electrochemical and mechanical performance of GPEs in ZIBs are summarized in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Summary of the ionic conductivity and tensile strength of different GPEs for ZIBs.80,83,85,89–92 
Apart from post-treatment with high concentration salt solution, using concentrated solution as a medium for polymerization is also an option for improving the mechanical properties and electrochemical performance of the GPE. Zhi et al.85 fabricated a highly concentrated dual-ion electrolyte that possesses high discharge voltage of nearly 1.9 V that contributed 63.5% of the battery's energy, which overcome the problem of unsatisfactory discharge voltage of zinc-ion batteries.85 Similar to Niederberger et al.,77 ‘water-in-salt’ concept was applied for the GPE formation. The polymerization of PAAm was carried out in a highly concentrated solution with 21 M LTFSI and 2 M Zn(OTf)2, which can greatly expand the voltage window and effectively suppress dendrite formation during zinc plating/stripping process. When it was assembled as a battery, a high specific capacity of 146.9 mA h g−1 was achieved at 0.2 A g−1. More intriguingly, the highly concentrated hydrogel electrolyte shows evaporation resistance in ambient environment by not only retaining its water content, but also absorbing moisture from the surroundings, which indicated its high stability when applied for flexible devices as the electrochemical performance will not be influenced by the evaporation of water during use even without sealed packaging.85
Besides, hydrogels with high mechanical performance can also be facilely fabricated with dual-network structure. For example, a super-tough Zn–MnO2 battery was developed by Zhi et al.86 with a double crosslinked hydrogel electrolyte composed of covalently crosslinked PAAm network and ionically crosslinked alginate chains. The double network (DN) structure has greatly enhanced the mechanical strength of the hydrogel with a modulus of 51.83 kPa, so that it can withstand a series of severe deformation such as cutting, folding, pressing, squeezing, twisting and hammering. More importantly, the reported DN GPE delivers a high specific capacity of 300.4 mA h g−1 at 0.11 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 82% after 500 cycles at 0.88 A g−1 charge–discharge rate.
In another work, PAAm was used for fabricating a mechanically enhanced hydrogel electrolyte with the addition of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC).87 The assembled flexible battery was sewn with stitches afterward to enhance the shear tolerance. The as-prepared gel performed enhanced mechanical property by being easily stretched to 1100% strain with a strength of 158 kPa, which is contributed by the intertwining effect and hydrogen bond between PAAm and NFC networks. Moreover, larger pores can be formed with the addition of cellulose and stabilized by the NFC polymer so a high ionic conductivity of 22.8 mS cm−1 can be achieved. The zinc/MnO2 battery assembled with the as-prepared PAAm/NFC GPE, which shows unique sewability by retaining 88.5% of its original capacity after 120 stitches. More than that, the stitches can effectively reinforce the layers, enabling the secure lamination between electrode and electrolyte layers under 43 N. This property has exhibited its suitability in the application for wearables.87
In addition to cellulose, gelatin-based hydrogels were also employed in flexible zinc-ion batteries due to their biocompatibility and their unique thermo-reversibility.88,89 Liu et al.88 has fabricated a cutting resistant ZIB with gelatin hydrogel electrolyte (GHE) with ionic conductivity of 6.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 delivered by the porous structure of gelatin hydrogel. It was reported that the cooling temperature for the solid hydrogel formation plays a crucial part in the strength of the GHE, lower cooling temperature is beneficial to the mechanical strength since the gelatin molecules could be localized more orderly. Additionally, the reported GHE exhibits stability in water, it can function normally when it was immersed in water, the capacity can be restored to the original level by soaking in the aqueous electrolyte for 24 hours, which indicated that this GHE is a reliable candidate material for safe flexible batteries.88
This section has illustrated different means for improving primary GPE performance from using additives to employing natural materials, where the latter is currently a hot topic as sustainable development is a big trend in today's society. However, researchers have taken a step further to study additional functions for metal-ion batteries, their findings will be discussed in the following sections.
4.2 Multifunctional hydrogel electrolytes for flexible metal-ion batteries
Apart from developing hydrogels with robust mechanical properties, self-healing hydrogel electrolyte have also been extensively studied as an alternative to prolong the durability of flexible batteries. A water-in-salt hydrogel electrolyte with PAAm, chitosan and tetraethoxysilane was reported by Tang et al.,93 the proportion of water was kept low with this approach, and unwanted reactions could be eliminated. Apart from the high ionic conductivity (51.3 mS cm−1) and broad electrochemical window (2.6 V) benefited by the ultra-high loading of salt, the as-prepared gel electrolyte demonstrated out-standing self-healing ability under ambient in 20 minutes due to the abundant hydrogen bond, and the ionic conductivity of the healed hydrogel shows ignorable degradation in ionic conductivity, and the Li-ion battery assembled with the electrolyte shown excellent durability for delivering high energy density of 110.7 W h kg−1 for 2000 cycles.93
Since the self-healing of hydrogel is commonly contributed by the reversible hydrogen bond upon contact of the cut parts, and a certain period of time is usually required for complete recovery. However, such recovering speed may not satisfy the demand for flexible wearables during continuous movement. To address this issue, Liu et al.94 reported a PVA based hydrogel with NFC/PANI/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite that healed by itself without any external stimuli in 3 minutes. The secret of the speedy recovery lies in the borax in the PVA precursor solution. Didiol–borax complex was formed as shown in Fig. 10a and b, which enhanced the gelation of PVA solution. Coupling with the unique structure of PANI, the cut hydrogel can be healed in a comparatively short time. It is worth mentioning that the PVA hydrogel with NFC/PANI/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite possesses high conductivity 8.15 × 10−3 S cm−1, which was enhanced by the increasing amount of PANI, it was believed that the high conductivity was attributed by the continuous transporting path created by the evenly distributed NFC/PANI nanocomposite. Moreover, this hydrogel was enabled with magnetism by doping MnFe2O4, reaching a maximum saturation magnetization of 5.22 emu g−1, such multifunctional hydrogel shows potential for being applied in electrochemical devices especially hydrogel electrolyte.94

(e) Digital photo of the battery self-healed with dislocation powering the LED light bulbs. Adapted with permission from ref. 95. Copyright 2019 John Wiley and Sons. 
In addition, a PVA based self-healable hydrogel was also adopted for developing an ‘all-in-one’ zinc-ion battery that can perform self-healing even when the cut surface was mismatched parallelly due to its unique architecture.95 In this study, PVA/zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (PVA/Zn(CF3SO3)2) was fabricated by freeze/thaw method, in which crystallinity of PVA was hindered by the incorporation with Zn(CF3SO3)2. It in turn boosts the ionic conductivity up to 12.6 S cm−1. The PVA/Zn(CF3SO3)2 was then assembled as a battery with zinc anode and PANI-based cathode. The GPE shows extraordinary stability by retaining 97.1% of the initial specific capacity (79.5 mA h g−1) after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1, and the power density of the assembled ZIB can reach 5089 W kg−1. More intriguingly, as shown in Fig. 10c–e, the battery can still maintain its specific capacity after 3 cycles of healing, and the performance was not greatly affected even the hydrogel electrolyte was not healed in a well-aligned state.95
Another example of self-healable hydrogel electrolyte was developed by Huang et al.92 through crosslinking PANa hydrogel with ferric ion by simply polymerizing NaOH neutralized acrylic acid monomers with ferric chloride (FeCl3).92 The ionic interactions between the ferric ions and the PANa chains have greatly facilitated the recovery of the broken hydrogel, which enabled the PANa hydrogel with much higher tensile strain and strength of ∼1000% and 205 kPa after healing respectively, while the PANa without ferric ions shows merely 63% of tensile strain and 30 kPa strength. As mentioned by other researchers, PANa hydrogel shows excellence in alkaline resistance.82,96 Therefore, Huang et al. have made good use of this property by imbibing the PANa GPE with high concentration (6 M) of KOH, resulting in high ionic conductivity and capacity. Combining both, the reported NiCo‖Zn battery featuring PANa GPE demonstrated superior durability for flexible electronics by retaining 87% of its original capacity after 4 cycles of healing.
Another huge challenge for aqueous-based flexible batteries is the limited operating temperature. Most of the aqueous electrolytes like hydrogel suffer from freezing under extremely low temperature and thus jeopardizes their electrochemical performance and mechanical properties. Therefore, hydrogel electrolytes with anti-freezing (AF) or wide operating temperature were developed by researchers. One of the extremely-low-temperature bearing hydrogel electrolyte was developed by Zhi et al.37 for a flexible rechargeable Zn/MnO2 battery. The AF PAAm-based hydrogel was fabricated by introducing EG based waterborne anionic polyurethane acrylates (EG-waPUA) as a precursor that copolymerize with AAm monomer through free radical polymerization. The as-prepared hydrogel demonstrates out-standing mechanical performance due to its dual-network structure. When the weight percent of EG-waPUA reached 24%, the EG-waPUA/PAAm hydrogel shows freezing resistance at −20 °C, which allows the hydrogel to maintain a high conductivity of 14.6 mS cm−1. This intriguing property was induced by the robust interactions among the molecules that can effectively disrupt the formation of crystal lattices. As shown in Fig. 11a, after being kept in −20 °C for a day, the EG-waPUA/PAAm hydrogel still exhibits a high level of flexibility by bearing deformation caused by bending, twisting, and even compressing. Coupling with flexible cloth electrodes of zinc and MnO2, the EG-waPUA/PAAm hydrogel was used as an electrolyte to assemble the flexible battery. The anti-freezing ability of the hydrogel electrolyte endowed the battery with electrochemical performance under sub-zero temperature. A high specific capacity of 226 mA h g−1 was exhibited at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 at −20 °C, while the battery with ordinary PAAm hydrogel electrolyte shows almost no capacity as the migration of zinc ions is greatly inhibited by freezing of the hydrogel. Moreover, it shows highly stable performance under severe deformation at −20 °C, such as hammering and compressing as shown in Fig. 11b and c, indicating its reliability in extreme conditions.37

Another hydrogel electrolyte with exceptional operating temperature range was fabricated with PANa. Incorporated with a high concentration of KOH, the PANa hydrogel can maintain its stretchability with 900% strain at −50 °C and the battery assembled with this hydrogel can operate well from −20 °C to 50 °C.97 The secret of such remarkable properties lies in the highly concentrated solution imbibed by the hydrogel. It effectively reduces the freezing point of the hydrogel as the water molecules tend to form macromolecules with metal ions, weaker intermolecular force was therefore formed. Also, the water content in the hydrogel was low as it was already saturated with ions. Like many other hydrogels containing concentrated solution, the as-prepared hydrogel has demonstrated high ionic conductivity of 5.7 S m−1, 12.6 S m−1, 16.3 S m−1 at −20 °C, 24 °C and 50 °C respectively. Furthermore, the NiCo‖Zn battery assembled with the PANa hydrogel electrolyte exhibits high adaptability at different current and retain high capacity of 100 mA h g−1 upon fast charging at 36C. With the merit of freeze resistance, the NiCo‖Zn battery assembled with the PANa hydrogel performed high cycle stability at −20 °C, and 87% of the capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles and allow steady charging at high rates.97
Besides tension failure that happens within the hydrogel electrolyte, lamination failure is another typical kind of deformation that greatly deteriorates the performance of the batteries. To tackle this problem, a hydrogel diode electrolyte with tunable interfacial adhesion was developed by Zhou et al.98 by laminating hydrogels with opposite charges together as shown in Fig. 12a. (3-Acrylamidopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (APTQ+) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt (AMPS−) were used as positively and negatively charged monomer respectively, and mixed with neutral monomer AAm in agarose hydrogel matrix. The attached hydrogel diode shows a high peeling force of around 63 N m−1 and is able to hold a weight of 10 g as shown in Fig. 12b. Such incredible adhesion was induced by the coulombic interaction between opposite charges in the interface of the hydrogel diode and the efficient dissipating energy in the hydrogel matrix. The adhesion magnitude in the interface can be tuned by altering the electric field. The robust adhesion between hydrogel electrolyte and metal electrode endowed the assembled Cu/Zn battery with an ultra-stable power output over 2000 stretching of 50% strain and 60° bending (Fig. 12c).98 More intriguingly, this hook-and-loop structure can effectively prevent self-discharging during storage by separating the battery into two parts, enabling long-term storage without degradation of performance.

In contrary to the extreme temperature insensitivity mentioned above, some hydrogel electrolytes are endowed with sol–gel transition features upon temperature change for specific aims. For instance, Zhi et al.99 developed a flexible cable Zn/CoFe(CN)6 battery using modified PAAm hydrogel that performs sol–gel transition upon temperature change as electrolyte. Poly(ethylene oxide)53–poly(propylene oxide)34–poly(ethylene oxide)53 (F77) possess unique sol–gel transition property, which turns into liquid upon cooling to 0 °C and gels at room temperature. To achieve this property, 4 M Zn(OTf)2 was added into F77, and the PAAm hydrogel was coated with the F77 solution so that the interfacial contact between the surface of the electrode and electrolyte can be enhanced. Moreover, the F77 skin was proved having no effect in the redox reaction. Instead, the F77 skin has greatly increased the specific capacity by 18.73% to 142.34 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and can achieve a high capacity of 110.95 mA h g−1 even at 5 A g−1, demonstrating outstanding rate capability.99
Apart from enhancing interfacial contact, the sol–gel transition can also be applied in batteries for the sake of safety. Zhi et al.100 have fabricated a fast-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNA) hydrogel electrolyte for a zinc/MnO2 battery, which turns into a stationary hydrogel that restricts the ion transference. As shown in Fig. 13a and b, under low temperature, the hydrogel bond between PNIPAM chain and water molecules are dominant and the copolymer tends to form micelles to allow free flow of the polymer solution. When the polymer solution is heated, the hydrogen bond breaks and the hydrophobic force of isopropyl groups prevail, that turns out forming precipitation of gel. Upon heating, the impedance largely increases from 153 Ω (20 °C) to 995 Ω (70 °C), and charging will be inhibited at 70 °C, which effectively prevented the problem of thermal runaway.100

A highly compressible rechargeable Zn/MnO2 battery with PAAm hydrogel electrolyte was developed by Zhi et al.101 The PAAm was intrinsically compressible due to the strong covalent bonding and abundant H-bond in the polymer matrix. As shown in Fig. 13c, when the hydrogel was compressed with reciprocating strain from 0 to 77.8%, the resistance of the hydrogel decreased from 36.84 to 7.12 Ω, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. The assembled battery manifested a specific capacity of 277.5 mA h g−1 at 1C and shown steady performance over 1000 cycles at 4C. Apart from being a promising energy storage system, the compressible battery was assembled with a flexible piezoresistive sensor to form a smart wristband, as shown in Fig. 13d and e, which can effectively detect the pressure exerted to the wristband from a current signal of 0.3 to 4 Hz.101
From the above discussion, the recent progress of Li-ion and Zn-ion batteries are summarized. Many of the above work emphasized on the application of wearables, however, scarcely a research has tested the batteries with the real-life circumstances such as multi-directional stretching and washing. The flexible batteries would be a more convincing candidate for wearables electronics if the durability in daily wear was demonstrated.
Albeit the fascinating achievements in electrode materials, the development of GPEs is relatively still in its fledgling stage. From the discussion above, the recent achievements of hydrogel electrolytes for supercapacitors and metal-ion batteries have been presented, in terms of the advances in electrochemical performance, mechanical performance and multifunctional properties. Although a lot of effort has been put into improving the ionic conductivity of GPEs by increasing the conductive species within the polymer matrix, which is still far from achieving the ionic conductivity of aqueous liquid electrolyte (7.1 × 10−3 to 6 S cm−2).102 Moreover, to satisfy the emerging demand of flexible devices, GPEs are reinforced with higher crosslinking degrees so that ultra-stretchable or high strength can be achieved. Unfortunately, ionic conductivity is often sacrificed with this method. A balance should be achieved between the two critical properties of GPEs for future advancements. On the other hand, to realize fully flexible devices, stretchable electrolytes should not be the sole focus. In the work mentioned above, conductive textile materials are often utilized as a carrier for the active materials. The textile materials like carbon cloths are indeed soft and flexible, however, they are generally non-stretchable, which cannot fully exhibit the superior performance of the device under deformation. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the development of stretchable electrodes.
5. Summary and outlook
Electrolyte plays a crucial role in electrochemical energy devices, as it promotes the diffusion of ions and determines electrochemical window, which in turn, has a great impact on their electrochemical performances such as cycling stability and energy density. In this review, the recent development of hydrogel electrolytes for various devices was discussed. Researchers have shown the potential of hydrogels serving as a promising component in high-performance devices with high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window, and high energy density. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of hydrogels were greatly improved from their pristine state by double-network structure, endowing them with high flexibility and toughness while retaining softness. The combination of the above properties of hydrogels has broken the constraints of conventional liquid electrolytes to enable highly stretchable supercapacitors/batteries with superior performance. Concurrently, the fast-developing functional storage devices have pushed the development of hydrogel electrolyte one step further with additional functions like self-healing ability, extreme condition tolerance, electrochromic behavior, and sol–gel transition protection. Although GPEs were extensively studied in recent years and have been modified with additional features, there are still some inadequacies to be fulfilled. Future research should pay more attention to the following concerns.
1. The water content of hydrogel electrolyte should be carefully designed. The water contained in hydrogel may evaporate quickly without additional treatment or packaging, which leads to the reduction of ionic conductivity and cycling stability upon usage. This could be achieved by introducing species with strong interaction energy with water molecules, which can either be the host polymer network or a solvent. Apart from that, electrolysis of water could lead to a ceiling of ESPW (1.23 V), which highly constrains the practical voltage and energy density of the supercapacitors/batteries. In fact, this problem can be precluded by adopting the ‘water-in-salt’ strategy, the high concentration of salt can effectively suppress the decomposition of water and enable broad ESPW. Future research toward this direction may achieve flexible high-performance devices without restriction of rigid packaging. Therefore, water inside the hydrogel should be carefully controlled according to different target properties.
2. Sustainability should be considered when selecting the host polymer for hydrogel electrolyte. Albeit with rechargeability, energy storage devices must reach the end of their performance and be disposed eventually. This can probably increase the burden of the environment and cause pollution. To follow the trend of sustainable development, research should be focused on the use of biomaterials extracted from nature or the synthesis of bio-degradable synthetic polymers. Although biomaterials like cellulose, alginate, and chitosan were utilized as hydrogel electrolyte, strong acid or alkali is often present in the system to maintain high electrochemical performance. Attention should be paid to their replacements.
3. Multi-functional conductive hydrogels should be focused for developing novel devices with collective functions, widening the potential applications in various fields and conditions. Although diverse properties of hydrogel such as electrochromism, self-healing ability, and extreme temperature tolerance were developed and reviewed in this article. There is still room for exploration of novel properties that can be potentially combined with GPE as innovative gadgets. For instance, the combination of flexible GPE with stimulus responsiveness can potentially be applied in artificial muscles or actuators for soft robotics.
4. The mechanical properties of GPE should be improved for prolonged practical applications. Hydrogels are indeed flexible in nature that allows stretching with high strain. Nevertheless, not all the stretchable hydrogels can be recovered to its original state after the release of force, which affects the stability of performance as the deformation might cause the delamination of the assembled device. For those elastomeric hydrogels, fatigue will be resulted after repeated stretching of around 1000 cycles, which is not sufficient to support the daily deformation of wearable electronics. Self-healing ability has been extensively studied for GPE, usually still requires external energy sources such as heating or irradiation. Moreover, complete recovery takes a certain period of time, which is not ideal for wearables as continuous movement hinders the re-connection of the broken interface. Therefore, timely healing process is of utmost importance. Supramolecular interaction among molecules can help to achieve fast recovery, which deserves to be focused on for the future development of self-healing GPE.
