The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the G/Si solar cells were in the range of 1.94–2.66%. Four volatile oxidants HNO3, HCl, H2O2 and SOCl2 were employed to treat the graphene films in the G/Si solar cells, and the PCEs could be greatly enhanced after being treated by all the volatile oxidants and SOCl2 doping showed the best improvement. A solar cell with an initial PCE of 2.45% could be increased to 5.95% upon SOCl2 doping treatment. The PCE stability of the volatile oxidant-treated cells was also investigated. The PCEs decreased with time, while SOCl2 and HCl showed much better PCE stability than HNO3 and H2O2.
Introduction
Solar energy is supposed to be the most viable choice to satisfy our clean energy demands.1 However, energy produced from sunlight is still low in our worldwide primary energy consumption, resulting from the high cost and inadequate efficiencies of existing solar cells.1 Exploitation of the new generation of photovoltaic cells, incorporating nanostructures (nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, quantum dots, etc.) into solar cell devices, is promising for inexpensive and large-scale solar energy harvesting and conversion.2–9 Graphene is a rapidly rising star for photoelectrical applications,10 due to its two-dimensional characteristics,11 high transmittance (97.7% at 550 nm),12 extremely high carrier mobility,13 high specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1),14 and excellent mechanical flexibility,15etc.
In particular, graphene has shown potential applications in organic solar cells16,17 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),18,19etc. In organic solar cells, graphene is mainly used as a substitute for ITO as a transparent electrode.17 In DSSCs, graphene can be used as a transparent electrode to replace ITO, a counter electrode to replace a platinum electrode, or an additive in a mesoporous semiconductor (usually TiO2) layer to promote electron transport.10,20 However, in the above mentioned applications, graphene does not participate in the photogeneration process. In our recent work, graphene/silicon (G/Si) heterojunction solar cells were assembled.2,21 Graphene not only serves as a transparent electrode for light transmission, charge collection and transport, but also as an active component to participate in the photogeneration process.2 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the first G/Si solar cell was quite low (∼1.7%).2 We found that the PCEs of the solar cells could be further enhanced by atom doping (e.g. boron doping) and molecular doping (e.g. HNO3 doping) of the graphene films.22,23 The PCEs of the solar cells could be increased from 1.3% to 2.3% by boron doping of the graphene films.22 While the PCEs of the solar cells could be increased from 2.90% to 4.35%, and from 1.29% to 1.58%, respectively, by HNO3 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonic acid molecular doping of the graphene films.23 HNO3 doping is more attractive due to the remarkable enhancement in PCE.23 There are many volatile oxidants that have similar properties to HNO3, such as SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl; however, the effect of these volatile oxidants on the as-assembled G/Si solar cells has been rarely investigated. Moreover, it is also worthwhile to investigate the differences in the effects of these volatile oxidants on the G/Si solar cells.
In this work, twelve G/Si heterojunction solar cells were assembled by transferring graphene onto n-Si. The original PCEs of the G/Si heterojunction solar cells were in the range of 1.94–2.66%. The assembled cells were divided into four groups, and the effects of HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl on the G/Si heterojunction solar cells were investigated. The PCEs could be increased to 213.1%, 230.0%, 212.2% and 211.6% of their original values by HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl respectively. A typical cell with an initial PCE of 2.45% could be improved to 5.95% by SOCl2 treatment. Although the PCEs of SOCl2-treated G/Si solar cells are still lower than bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide [((CF3SO2)2NH)] (TFSA) treated ones,5 and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs)/Si solar cells,4 it has its own advantages. DWCNT/Si solar cells show high efficiencies (∼13.8%),4 but the growth temperature for the DWCNT membrane is relatively high (∼1150 °C) and as-synthesized DWCNTs need some post-treatments, such as long time H2O2 (∼24 h) and HCl (∼24 h) treatments to remove catalyst residue.4,24 Moreover, films composed of DWCNT networks exhibit a lot of interspaces between bundles, resulting in a surface coverage of Si by DWCNT films of less than 100%,4,24 which is bad for the further increase in the PCE. As to graphene, the growth temperature is relatively low (∼1000 °C), and Si could be totally (100%) covered by graphene. TFSA is not easy to manipulate, thus it is a complex process for its doping of graphene, like dissolving TFSA in nitromethane and then spin-casting this solution on graphene.5 While the doping process is greatly simplified by volatile oxidants like SOCl2.
The efficiency stabilities of the volatile oxidant treated cells in air were also investigated. SOCl2 and HCl treated cells showed relatively better stability than those doped with HNO3 and H2O2. This work is meaningful and important for the development of graphene-based photovoltaics.
Experimental
Graphene synthesis and characterization
Graphene film was synthesized by chemical vapour deposition using acetonitrile as the precursor.25 Cu foil was used as the substrate, located in the middle of a quartz tube reactor, and gradually heated up to 900 °C in an Ar (300 mL min−1) flow. H2 was introduced into the reactor when the temperature reached 900 °C, and the Cu substrate was annealed at 900 °C for 1 h to homogenize the crystal grain. After that, the temperature was raised to 1000 °C over 10 min. Then acetonitrile was fed into the reactor at a feed rate of 0.01 mL min−1 in an Ar (2000 mL min−1)/H2 (30 mL min−1) flow for 5 min. When the feeding of acetonitrile was stopped, the Cu foil was withdrawn to the low-temperature zone of the reactor quickly to allow a fast-cooling of the sample. As-synthesized graphene film was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010), and microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (Renishow RM 2000, 514.5 nm laser). An optical transmission spectrum of the graphene film was taken by a UV-2450 UV/vis optical spectrometer. The sheet resistance of the graphene film was measured using a four-probe resistivity test system.
Solar cell assembly and evaluation
As-synthesized graphene film was cut into pieces with sizes of ∼6 mm × 6 mm and then etched in a mixed solution of FeCl3/HCl. After 2–5 hours, the Cu substrate could be completely etched away, and the graphene films were floating on the surface of the FeCl3/HCl solution. After being rinsed with deionized water several times, the graphene film was transferred to n-type Si (with a square window of 3 mm × 3 mm surrounded by insulating silicon dioxide). The n-Si substrate covered with graphene film was heated up under a filament lamp to evaporate the water. Then the n-Si substrate was glued to a piece of Cu foil with silver paste, and the Cu foil was used as an electrode for the solar cell test. Finally, silver wire was glued to the front electrode (graphene film) with silver paste as another electrode for measurement. The assembled solar cell devices were evaluated with a solar simulator (Newport, at AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter.
Volatile oxidant treatment
Volatile oxidant treatment of the assembled G/Si solar cells was carried out by placing the assembled cells above a vial containing HNO3 (65 wt%), HCl (36 wt%), H2O2 (30 wt%) or SOCl2 (99.5 wt%) for 1 min.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1(a), TEM measurement of the graphene film shows that the graphene surface is very clean and almost free from impurities. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the sample is shown in Fig. 1(b). The symmetric hexagonal diffraction spots indicate that the structure of the sample is a graphene lattice.26 Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the structure and quality of the sample. A D-band could be observed in the Raman spectrum (Fig. 1(c)), which is mainly due to the defects caused by nitrogen doping.25 A sharp 2D band (∼2650 cm−1) and large I2D/IG ratio (∼1.72) could be observed in Fig. 1(c), demonstrating the graphene films are mainly few-layered (≤3 layer).25,27,28 The graphene sample shows high transparency in the UV-Vis range with transmittances up to 92% at 550 nm wavelength, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The sheet resistance of the graphene sample is 1053 Ω sq−1. The highly transparent and conductive nature of the graphene sample makes it appealing for G/Si solar cell applications.

Twelve G/Si solar cells were assembled and tested, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of each cell are listed in Table 1. The PCEs of the cells are in the range of 1.94–2.66%. These G/Si cells were numbered and divided into four groups, and each group was treated by HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl, separately. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of treated cells are listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the PCE could be increased to 213.1%, 230.0%, 212.2% and 211.6% of their original ones, respectively, upon HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment. The light current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of 1#, 4#, 7# and 10# solar cells before and after volatile oxidant treatment are shown in Fig. 2. The light J–V curves of other cells before and after volatile oxidant treatment are shown in Fig. S1.† As shown in Fig. 2(e), the PCEs of 1#, 4#, 7# and 10# cells are greatly enhanced upon volatile oxidant treatment. The PCE enhancement of the volatile oxidant-treated cells is mainly due to the enhancement in FF and Voc (Fig. 2 and Table 1). A pristine G/Si cell (4#) shows a Jsc of 17.65 mA cm−2, FF of 35.4%, Voc of 412.1 mV and PCE of 2.58%; the PCE of this cell increased to 5.95% after SOCl2 treatment, with a Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2, FF of 60.6%, Voc of 547.8 mV.

The remarkably enhanced efficiency by volatile oxidant treatment could be attributed to the following three factors. First, volatile oxidant treatment could increase the work function of graphene films. It has been reported that HNO3 treatment could increase the work function of graphene by p-doping.23 As demonstrated in our recent work, increasing the work function of graphene film is beneficial to get a larger built-in voltage of the G/Si Schottky junction.29 And a larger built-in voltage of the Schottky junction results in a larger Voc.2 It can be calculated from Table 1 that the Voc of the solar cells have an increase of 98.0, 120.6, 87.9 and 113.1 mV, respectively, after HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment. It is clearly shown that SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment could also increase the work function of the graphene film by p-doping, and SOCl2 has the best enhancement.
Second, there is an increase in the conductivity of the graphene films upon volatile oxidant treatment. It was reported that the graphene conductivity could be greatly increased by HNO3 treatment because of p-doping.30 However, there are few reports about the effect of SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl on the graphene conductivity. The sheet resistance of the pristine graphene film is 1053 Ω sq−1, while the sheet resistance could decrease to 581, 514, 650 and 598 Ω sq−1, respectively, after HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment (Fig. S2†). So it is clearly shown in our work that SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment also increased the conductivity of graphene which is good for the decrease in internal resistance (Rs) of the solar cell.
Third, volatile oxidant treatment could improve the quality of the G/Si Schottky junction and reduce the Rs of the solar cell, thus the FF is improved. Dark current density–voltage curves of 1#, 4#, 7# and 10# cells before and after volatile oxidant treatment are shown in Fig. S3.† The diode ideality factor (n) of the Schottky junction could be calculated by linear fit of ln(dark current, I) versus voltage.4 As shown in Fig. 3, the n of 1# cell has been improved from 3.79 to 1.33 (upon HNO3 treatment), 4# cell has been improved from 3.83 to 1.41 (SOCl2 treatment), 7# cell has been improved from 3.80 to 1.38 (H2O2 treatment), and 10# cell has been improved from 3.83 to 1.42 (HCl treatment). The result means the Schottky junction quality has been improved after volatile oxidant treatment.31 In addition, a linear fit of dV/d(ln(I)) versus I gives the Rs of the Schottky junction.2 The Rs of 1# has dropped from 58.6 Ω in the pristine cell to 47.8 Ω upon HNO3 treatment, 4# dropped from 58.5 Ω to 46.5 Ω upon SOCl2 treatment, 7# dropped from 68.6 Ω to 49.2 Ω upon H2O2 treatment, and 10# dropped from 58.1 Ω to 44.3 Ω upon HCl treatment, as shown in Fig. 4. The improvement of the Schottky junction quality and the decrease of Rs are beneficial to the improvement of FF.4,5 The FF of all the cells are enhanced by the volatile oxidant treatment, as can be seen from Table 1.

After volatile oxidant treatment, the treated cells were kept in ambient conditions for 8 days. The stability of volatile oxidant treated G/Si cells was tested by recording a series of J–V curves on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 8th days. The light J–V curves of 1#-HNO3, 4#-SOCl2, 7#-H2O2, and 10#-HCl cells during the 8 days in air are shown in Fig. S4.† The calculated cell parameters during 8 days are shown in Fig. 5. The PCEs of the volatile oxidant treated cells decrease with the extension of storage time in the air (Fig. 5). The drop in the PCEs is mainly due to the decreases of FF and Voc, as shown in Fig. 5. The degradation of cell performance is supposed to result from the volatilization of the volatile oxidant. In the previous work about HNO3 doping of CNT/Si solar cells, the persistent doping of CNTs and the efficiency stability could be achieved by encapsulating the cells with polymer (e.g. polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)).32 For practical application, the environmental stability of the G/Si cell efficiency upon doping might also be solved by encapsulating the as-assembled cells into some polymers, such as PDMS.32

To investigate the stability differences between HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treated cells, the light J–V curves of the other eight treated cells were also recorded after 8 days storage in the air (Fig. S5†). The corresponding cell parameters of all the treated cells after 8 days storage in air are listed in Table 2. It can be calculated from Table 1 and Table 2, compared with the original solar cells, that the PCEs of HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treated cells retained an enhancement of 13.6%, 21.7%, 7.4% and 17.6%, respectively, after 8 days storage in the air. The Voc of HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treated cells retained an enhancement of 45.3, 80.4, 12.6 and 65.3 mV, respectively, after 8 days storage in the air. The results show SOCl2 and HCl treated solar cells have relatively better stability.

Conclusions
G/Si Schottky junction solar cells were assembled by transferring graphene film onto n-Si. The PCEs of as-assembled G/Si cells are in the range of 1.94–2.66%. HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl molecular doping could increase the work function and conductivity of the graphene film, reduce the Rs and improve the quality of the G/Si Schottky junction. Thus the efficiencies of the G/Si solar cells are greatly enhanced by the volatile oxidants. The PCEs could be increased to 213.1%, 230.0%, 212.2% and 211.6% of their original values by HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2, and HCl treatment, respectively. One cell shows an initial PCE as high as 2.45% and up to 5.95% upon SOCl2 treatment. The PCEs of the volatile oxidant treated cells decreases with the extension of storage time in the air, and SOCl2 and HCl treated cells show relatively better stability than HNO3 and H2O2 ones. Molecular doping might be an effective way to realize high-performance graphene-based photovoltaic devices.
