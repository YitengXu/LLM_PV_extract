    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 28th June 2017AbstractHerein, eight metal-free organic dyes (YH-1–YH-8) containing olefin or acetylene as π-spacer linkages in a triarylene bridge were synthesised. Moreover, two dyes (1N-PPP and 1N-PPS) without olefin and triple bonds as π-spacer linkages were used as references. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes were characterised, and the dyes were then used to fabricate dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). We demonstrated the use of a D–π–A dipolar system by employing arylamine derivatives as an electron donor, triarylene with iterative olefin or acetylene as a π-bridge, and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor. YH-1 had olefin as a repeating unit in the triarylene bridge and exhibited broad absorption, favourable short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), and favourable open-circuit voltage (Voc) when used in a film morphology with DCA as a coabsorbent. The optimal device exhibited a Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 650 mV, and a fill factor of 0.67, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.08%. The photophysical properties of the DSSCs were analysed using time-dependent density functional theory with the B3LYP functional.
1 Introduction
Very recently, the limited stock of fossil fuels and global CO2 emissions have led to the investigation and development of renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Solar energy is generally acknowledged as a potential alternative energy source. In the past two decades, dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) based on nanocrystalline TiO2 and photosensitisers have received significant attention because they are easy to fabricate, are colourful, transparent, and low-cost devices, and can be scaled up.1–4 DSSC devices utilising ruthenium-based polypyridyl complexes exhibit a power conversion efficiency of more than 11% under AM 1.5 conditions.5–8 Diau and Yeh et al. have used a porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and achieved a maximal performance of 13% with Y123 in a cocktail system.9 A previous study has reported a metal-complex sensitiser; however, the synthesis route to the sensitiser was complicated, its purification was difficult, low yield was obtained, and sources of the metal were limited. Metal-free organic dyes are environmentally friendly, have a high molar extinction coefficient, can be synthesised at a low cost, have high structural flexibility, and can be used in a variety of sensitisers. Most organic sensitisers with high efficiency contain dye molecules with linearly shaped structures comprising a strong D–π–A dipole with an electron donor D, a π-bridge, and an electron acceptor A. Numerous metal-free organic dyes have been investigated, and they exhibit a high performance level similar to that of the ruthenium-based complexes.10–17 Yano and Hanaya used an alkoxysilyl anchor dye (ADEKA-1) as a cosensitiser, and highest performance reported to date (i.e., 14%) with LEG-4 in metal-free organic dyes was achieved.18
To achieve an optimal D–π–A photosensitiser for DSSCs, it is critical to improve the power conversion efficiency of the cell. The π-bridge is a crucial factor in DSSCs not only because it connects D and A in the electron channel, but also because a conjugated chromophore with light harvesting ability improves the short-circuit current (Jsc). Numerous studies have been focused on conjugated π-bridges, with the π-bridge unit in the sensitiser mainly composed of anthracene,15,19–23 benzene,24,25 benzothiadiazole,26–29 diketopyrrolopyrrole,30–32 furan,33,34 pyrrole,35,36 and thiophene,37,38 all of which exhibit C–C linkages. However, some π-spacers exhibit a low degree of π-conjugation along the main chromophore through the C–C linkage that may reduce their electron injection efficiency.20,39 In previous studies, the expansion of π-conjugated chromophores yielded higher Jsc, which was often accompanied by a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc). The effect of Voc on device performance was mostly been attributed to the electron lifetime, which was the time taken for the electrons from the excited state of the photosensitiser that were injected into nanoporous TiO2 to recombine.40,41Voc results of previous reports can be summarised as follows: (i) the conduction band edge of TiO2 is downshifted by the electron acceptor species. (ii) Bulky triarylamine donors and alkyl substituents result in higher Voc and a longer electron lifetime because of the enhanced surface blocking effect. (iii) The dye structures yield interactions between the electrolyte and dye, hence producing numerous electrolyte acceptor species at the interface and enhancing electron recombination. (iv) Dye structures that exhibit favourable film morphology cover the TiO2 surface more completely, thus preventing direct contact with the electron acceptor of the electrolyte.
Although some reports show impressive dye skeletons and good performance, these dyes have a complicated synthetic route and an overall low yield.15–17,42 We have previously reported a simplified triarylene π-bridge using a C–C single bond linkage (1N-PPP and 1N-PPS) that possesses different π-conjugated chromophores (phenylene/thiophene) and a slight twist in the bridge moiety.25 However, the influence of double and triple bond linkages in a triarylene bridge for DSSCs has been rarely discussed. In this study, we designed and synthesised eight YH-series dyes (YH-1–YH-8) containing olefin or acetylene as the π-spacer linkage in the triarylene bridge. We also investigated the effect of different dye structures on the charge recombination rate and the electron lifetime and evaluated how the film morphology with the co-absorbent enhanced the performance of the resultant DSSC devices. We also discovered that the thiophene moieties could enhance light harvesting, but the sensitisers with thiophene spacers exhibited lower Voc than the dyes with phenylene π-bridges; this has been discussed in the section Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. The synthesis procedures are described in Scheme 1; all structures were confirmed using spectroscopy.

2 Experimental
2.1 Characterization and reagents
All reactions and manipulations were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and solvents were freshly distilled according to standard procedures. 1H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker (AVIII HD 400) spectrometer with CDCl3, THF-d8, or DMSO-d6 as the solvent. Chemical shifts (δ) were obtained downfield from the peak with respect to tetramethylsilane. Absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer, and emission spectra were obtained using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer. Redox potentials were measured through cyclic voltammetry using a CHI 620 analyser. All measurements were performed in tetrahydrofuran solutions containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte under ambient conditions after purging for 10 min with N2. Furthermore, the conventional three-electrode configuration was employed, comprising a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode calibrated using ferrocene/ferrocenium as the internal reference. Mass spectra were obtained using a JEOL JMS-700 double-focusing mass spectrometer.

2.2 Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (FTO glass, Solaronix TCO22-7; sheet resistance = 7 Ω square−1) and titania oxide pastes of Ti-nanoxide T/SP and R/SP were purchased from Solaronix. A thin film of TiO2 (10–12 μm transparent layer +5 μm scattering layer) was coated onto a 0.28 cm2 FTO glass substrate, which was then immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M dye sensitiser for 12 h, rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile, and dried. Another piece of FTO glass with a 100 nm-thick layer of sputtered Pt was used as a counter electrode. The active area was controlled at a dimension of 0.28 cm2 by adhering a 60 μm-thick piece of polyester tape to the Pt electrode. The photocathode was placed on top of the counter electrode and tightly clipped to form a cell, and an electrolyte was injected into the seam between two electrodes. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP; 0.5 M) was used as an electrolyte. Devices composed of the commercial dye N719 under the same conditions (3 × 10−4 M, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) were used as references. The cell parameters were obtained under incident light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (as measured using a thermopile probe; Oriel 71964) that was generated using a 300 W solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator 9043A, Newport) and passed through an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel 74110). The light intensity was further calibrated using an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150) and adjusted to 1.0 Sun. The monochromatic quantum efficiency was obtained using a monochromator (Oriel 74100) under short-circuit conditions. The electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSSCs were obtained using an impedance/charge extraction method (CEM)/intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) analyser (Zahner Ennium).
2.3 Quantum chemistry computations
The structures of the dyes were optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) hybrid functional. For the excited states, a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional was employed. All analyses were performed using the Q-Chem 3.0 software. The frontier orbital plots of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (hereinafter referred to as HOMO and LUMO, respectively) were drawn using GaussView 04.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The structures of the dyes are illustrated in Fig. 1, and their synthesis procedures are presented in Scheme 1. The YH-series contained olefin or acetylene as the π-spacer linkage in the triarylene bridge between the arylamine donor and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in the sensitiser. The synthesis of the dyes began with 4-bromo-diarylaniline yielding the aldehyde group of compound 2 through formylation. The aldehyde group extended the π-bridge through Wittig and Heck reactions to yield compounds 4 and 5. The π-spacer linkage of acetylene was constructed by repeating the Sonogashira reaction to yield compounds 10 and 11, and all aldehyde groups were verified using proton NMR (ESI). The compounds 4, 5, 10, and 11 that contained aldehyde groups were used to yield final products through Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Herein, eight final products were obtained with high yields of cyanoacrylic acid acceptor units that were easily purified. The structures of the eight compounds were characterised using spectroscopy.

3.2 Absorption spectra
The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of all sensitisers in CH2Cl2 solution are presented in Fig. 2, and the parameters of the sensitisers are listed in Table 1. The YH-series sensitisers exhibited two or three broad, high-intensity absorption peaks within the range of 344–504 nm. The short wavelength region (265–383 nm) was attributed to the localised π–π* transitions, whereas the long wavelength region (405–490 nm) was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. Compared to those of 1N-PPP and 1N-PPS, on extending the π-conjugation via insertion of a π-spacer linkage, the absorption spectra of the metal-free organic dyes were red-shifted by approximately 30–64 nm with respect to those in the solution, except for YH-5, which had a slightly blue-shifted spectrum. The ICT absorption band was stronger when the olefin bonds were used as π-spacer linkages as compared to that when triple bonds were used as π-spacer linkages; this indicated that the complete conjugation of olefin linkages enhanced π-overlapping and led to increased red-shifting and an extensive absorption region. Hence, YH-1–YH-4 exhibited broader, high-intensity ICT transitions and approximately 25–87 nm red-shifted ICT transitions in a CH2Cl2 solution. The acetylene moiety was more electronegative than the olefin bonds, and the electronegativity of the triple bonds weakened the electron-withdrawing ability of the electron acceptor because of the opposite dipole moment of the triple bond and electron acceptor. Thus, the absorption spectra of the dyes with triple bonds blue-shifted as compared to those of the dyes with double bonds.19,43 Absorption photocurrent (Jsc) and the intensity of absorption exhibited the same π-spacer linkage trend for dyes in solution.

Compared to the absorption spectra obtained in methylene chloride, the absorption spectra of all the dyes on the TiO2 film exhibited red-shift and spectral broadening because of intermolecular J-aggregation of the sensitizer or strong interaction between the dye and semiconductor surface when the former was anchored onto the TiO2 surface.19,43,44 The absorption spectra of sensitizers with alkoxy long chains were broader than those without, representing an advantageous spectral property for light harvesting (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the dyes absorbed on TiO2. 
3.3 Electrochemical properties
The first oxidation potentials Eox corresponding to the HOMO level of the photosensitisers were measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S28, ESI†). Herein, two long hexyloxy chains in the arylamine donor moiety strongly affected electron delocalisation and oxidation potential, increased the HOMO energy level to 0.29–0.32 eV, and reduced the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The introduction of olefin and acetylene moieties as π-spacer linkages had nearly no effect on the HOMO energy level of the dyes; however, it reduced the energy gap, indicating that coplanarity and π-conjugation in the triarylene bridge increased. Compared to the introduction of acetylene as a π-spacer linkage, the introduction of the olefin π-spacer linkage slightly increased the HOMO level. The lowest ionisation potentials of the dyes in CH2Cl2 solution decreased in the following order: YH-5 ≈ YH-7 > YH-1 ≈ YH-3 ≈ 1N-PPS ≈ 1N-PPP > YH-6 ≈ YH-8 > YH-2 ≈ YH-4 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S31, ESI†). Moreover, the LUMO levels of the dyes were estimated according to Eox and zero–zero band gaps at the onset of the absorption spectra (Table 1). The hexyloxy chains in the arylamine donor group and the bridge with the thiophene unit reduce energy gap energies. YH-1 and YH-2 had narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, a trend consistent with the wider absorption ranges illustrated in Fig. 4. This trend was also confirmed using theoretical calculations, as discussed in the following section.

3.4 Computational analysis
The effect of the use of the dyes YH-1-8 on the device performance was further explored through theoretical models. Complete geometrical optimisations were performed using TDDFT with the B3LYP functional in combination with the standard 6-31G(d) basis set within Q-Chem 3.0.45 The use of olefin or acetylene as the π-spacer linkages in the triarylene bridge led to similar coplanarity, as demonstrated by the optimised structure determined using theoretical computation (Fig. S25, ESI†). The frontier orbital electron distributions of the dyes are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. S26 (ESI†). The electron densities in the HOMO and LUMO were mainly distributed around the triphenylamine donor moieties and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor moieties, respectively. Previous relevant studies have reported that a disturbance to charge delivery, either through a distortion of the molecular geometry or intramolecular aggregation, may reduce charge migration rate. As long as the charge-separated state has a long lifetime, high device quantum efficiency can be achieved.39,46 A delicate balance between charge separation and recombination must be maintained by modifying the molecular structures, bulky structures, and hydrophobic long chains that may reduce intermolecular aggregation and dark current.
 Fig. 5  The frontier HOMO and LUMO of YH-series dyes estimated by time-dependent DFT/B3LYP (6-31G* basis set). 
The difference in the Mulliken charge distributions of the ground state (S0) and excited state (S1) according to the estimate generated using TDDFT/B3LYP is presented in Fig. 6 and Table S2 (ESI†). Dyes containing alkoxy chains exhibited optimal charge separation in the ICT state (bar chart, Fig. 6) because the chains enhanced the electron-donating ability of the arylamine donors.
 Fig. 6  Difference of Mulliken charges between the ground state (S0) and excited state (S1 and S2) estimated by the time-dependent DFT/B3LYP model. 
Photoexcitation pumps an electron from HOMO to LUMO and thus shifts a considerable number of electrons from the donor to the acceptor. Consequently, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of dyes YH-2, YH-4, YH-6, and YH-8 that contained alkoxy chains was lower than that of the dyes YH-1, YH-3, YH-5, and YH-7 that did not contain alkoxy chains. Therefore, the ICT band in the even-numbered dyes exhibited a bathochromic shift as compared to that in the odd-numbered dyes. A similar trend was identified for the dipole moment (YH-2: 11.6309 D > YH-1: 9.7556 D) and CT transition excitation in the YH-series sensitisers (Table S1, ESI†).
The transition probability was estimated according to the excitations using TDDFT/B3LYP, and the calculated oscillator strength (f) is presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The f values for the lowest-energy ICT transitions (S1 state) were relatively high, ranging from 0.58 to 0.98. The results were consistent with the absorptivity of the dyes in solution.
3.5 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photosensitisers of the designed DSSCs were absorbed on the TiO2 surface using a standard procedure. The electrolyte used to investigate the performance of the devices contained LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), and TBP (0.5 M) in MeCN. Experiments involving coabsorption were conducted using deoxycholic acid (DCA). The incident photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCEs) and photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve of all dyes were measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2). The short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical photocurrent density (η) are summarised in Table 1, wherein N719 serves as a reference dye.
The J–V curve and IPCE of all the devices are plotted in Fig. 7. An apparent improvement of 2–53 mV in Voc was observed for dyes YH-1, YH-3, YH-5, and YH-7 without long alkoxy chains as compared to the Voc obtained without DCA coabsorbent (Table 1). Favourable morphology and coverage of the dyes on the TiO2 film reduced Li+ or I3− ions in contact with the TiO2 surface, enhancing Voc because of an improved surface blocking effect and subsequently increasing the gap between the conduction bands of TiO2 and electrolyte.47–49 The dyes YH-1, YH-3, YH-5, and YH-7 without long alkoxy chains had higher Voc than other dyes with alkoxy chains; this indicated that the former dyes reduced dark current in the devices by substantially reducing the charge recombination rate.
 Fig. 7  
J–V plots and IPCE of DSSC devices of YH-1-8 without DCA co-absorbent. The plots were obtained under a light intensity of 1.0 Sun. 
We modified the structures of the dyes using thiophene moieties as π-bridges near the anchoring group. Thiophene moieties can enhance light harvesting. However, the organic dyes with thiophene spacers exhibited lower Voc than those with phenylene π-bridges. Dyes with more active sulphur sites had a higher tendency to form dye–iodine complexes because of the strong interactions between iodine and sulphur atoms.50
Compared to the devices using reference dyes (such as 1N-PPP or 1N-PPS) without double or triple bond linkage units, the devices using double-bond dyes had dramatically improved energy conversion efficiency η because of a large enhancement of Jsc (YH-1 and YH-3). However, the introduction of triple bonds reduced η because of a low Jsc (YH-5 and YH-7). This lower Jsc was because of the fact that these dyes had narrower absorption spectra than the dyes with double bonds, and this result was consistent with the dye loading results for the dyes on TiO2 films (Table 1). After adding DCA (10 mM) as a co-absorbent to all YH-series dyes, the Jsc and quantum efficiency of the resultant DSSCs improved; however, YH-5 and YH-7 still displayed lower Jsc than YH-1 and YH-3. Results for the dyes with and without DCA co-absorbent are shown in Table 2. Moreover, it was observed that the olefin π-spacer linkages of organic dyes showed better light harvesting effect than triple bond π-spacer linkages of organic dyes.

Previous reports have revealed that long hydrophobic chains may prevent contact between I3− ions and the TiO2 surface, and in this study, the compounds with long chains exhibited higher Voc than the sensitisers without long chains.10,51,52 However, the introduction of long hydrophobic chains may not always improve Voc because some studies have reported higher Voc when fewer or no long alkyl chains have been used.53–55 Our investigation revealed that sensitisers without long alkyl chains had higher Voc (YH-1, YH-3, YH-5, and YH-7); this indicated that the HOMO energy level of the sensitisers was near the I−/I3− energy level, which might reduce dye regeneration and increase the charge recombination rate.
The morphology of the sensitisers on the TiO2 surface is also a crucial factor for optimising the performance of DSSCs. The sensitiser must be placed sufficiently vertical on the TiO2 film to prevent intermolecular aggregation that causes dark current. We also investigated whether adding DCA as a coabsorbent prevented the horizontal alignment of the sensitiser on the TiO2 surface. For dyes that cannot form high quality films, addition of DCA can effectively improve dye alignment and consequently reduce the charge recombination rate.56–58
Addition of DCA (10 mM) to all dyes improved the quantum efficiency of the resultant DSSCs by 1–33% (Table 2). DSSCs containing YH-1 and YH-2 exhibited dramatic enhancements of 15.3% and 32.9%, respectively. It's observed enhancement of YH-1, YH-2, YH-5, and YH-6 by using DCA co-absorbent in Fig. S30 (ESI†), dyes with the thiophene moiety showed lower Voc because of the strong interactions between iodine and sulphur atoms. Addition of DCA can be suppressed to form dye–iodine complexes and good morphology on the TiO2 film. Addition of DCA considerably increased Voc and Jsc, indicating an improvement in dye morphology. Thus, the addition of DCA coabsorbent enabled the more vertical alignment of the dye on the TiO2 surface. This effect was confirmed by the higher resistance of the DSSCs determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as presented in the following section. The optimal photovoltaic efficiency was obtained for YH-1, with a Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 650 mV, and an FF of 0.67, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.08% (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  
J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with and without DCA co-absorbent at a light intensity of 1.0 Sun. 
3.6 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electron lifetime by CEM/IMVS
EIS was performed to further illustrate the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs. Nyquist and Bode plots were constructed under a forward bias and dark conditions (Fig. 9). Semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots for each sensitiser, which were associated with transport at the TiO2/electrolyte/dye interfaces. A larger semicircle corresponds to larger charge recombination resistance at low frequency, indicating a lower charge recombination rate and smaller dark current.59 The radii of the semicircles increased in the order of YH-1 < YH-5 < YH-3 < YH-7 and YH-2 < YH-6 < YH-4 < YH-8, which were consistent with the Voc trends of the dyes. The electron diffusion lifetime (τe) of the device was estimated by fitting the equation in a Bode plot, and a shift to a low frequency (f) corresponded to a longer electron lifetime. YH-3, YH-4, YH-7, and YH-8 displayed higher Voc than the dyes without DCA coabsorbent addition, indicating a lower charge recombination rate (Fig. 9b). Particularly, YH-7 (34.9 ms) and YH-8 (37.2 ms) had the highest Voc, as verified by the Nyquist and Bode plots with the largest semicircles and longest electron lifetimes, respectively.

(a and b) Nyquist plots (i.e., minus imaginary part of the impedance −Z′′ vs. the real part of the impedance Z′ when sweeping the frequency). (c and d) Bode phase plots at −0.73 V bias in the dark. The electron diffusion lifetime τe = 1/2πf. 
We further validated the correlation between Voc and the electron lifetime of a device. The electron lifetime (τr) was measured using IMVS, and the results are presented in Fig. 10. The electron lifetime reduced in the order YH-7 (40.59 ms) > YH-3 (35.80 ms) > YH-5 (31.33 ms) > YH-1 (27.39 ms) for the devices under the same light intensity and with DCA addition, which was consistent with the data obtained from the Bode plot fits. Voc is defined as the energy gap between the Fermi levels of TiO2 and the redox couple of the electrolyte.60,61 A positive shift in the conduction band of TiO2 may reduce Voc and the electron lifetime. YH-7 and YH-3, which did not contain more active sulphur sites of thiophene moieties to form dye–iodine complexes, had reduced charge recombination and a higher electron lifetime than the other dyes. CEM revealed that the conduction band edge of TiO2 was more downshifted for YH-1 and YH-5 than that for the other dyes, which again was consistent with the Nyquist plots. YH-3 without DCA coabsorbent exhibited a favourable Voc of 695 mV and an overall conversion efficiency of 6.47%.

4 Conclusions
We demonstrated that a simple D–π–A dipolar system and high-performance DSSC can be achieved using olefin or acetylene as the π-spacer linkage in the triarylene bridge. Herein, eight metal-free organic dyes (YH-1–YH-8) were synthesised. The olefin π-spacer linkages of YH-1–YH-4 exhibited broader, high-intensity absorption than the acetylene-based linkages in CH2Cl2 solution and a higher IPCE and short-circuit photocurrent density. Organic dyes containing thiophene moieties with more active sulphur sites had a higher tendency to form dye–iodine complexes because of the strong interactions between iodine and sulphur atoms. Thus, organic dyes possessing thiophene spacers displayed lower Voc than those with phenylene π-bridges. YH-3 without the DCA coabsorbent exhibited a favourable Voc of 695 mV and an overall conversion efficiency of 6.47%.

YH-1 contained thiophene spacers and displayed a low Voc of 635 mV, but thiophene moieties might enhance light harvesting. YH-1 had olefin as a repeating unit in the triarylene bridge and broad absorption, leading to improved Jsc and film morphology with the DCA coabsorbent and resulting in favourable Voc. A typical device fabricated using YH-1 had a Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 650 mV, and an FF of 0.67, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.08%.
