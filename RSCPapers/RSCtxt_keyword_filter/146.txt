    , Accepted 21st February 2020First published on 21st February 2020AbstractDual molecular engineering of alkyl side chains and halogen accepting ends of asymmetric fused-ring acceptors has been proposed for controlling aggregation for optimized organic solar cells (OSCs). Fluorination or chlorination on end-capped groups are explored along with linear octyl (C8) or branched 2-butyl-1-octyl chain (BO) substitution on the donating core. The inherent features of the larger Cl atom and longer C–Cl bond markedly extend the backbone stacking area and thus enhance molecular aggregation, while bulky BO chain exert a heavier steric shielding effect on backbone stacking. Consequently, IPTBO-4Cl shows properly weakened intermolecular interaction for balanced molecular aggregation. IPTBO-4Cl when blended with a PM6 polymer donor delivers a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15% and a 72.6% fill factor (FF). Expectedly, fluorinated IPT-4F bearing shorter C8 chains outputs a good PCE nearing 15% with a 74.2% FF. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 15% is by far the highest for asymmetric FRA based OSCs. By contrast, IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4F with either excessively strong or weak aggregation result in relatively low photovoltaic performance. Our results demonstrate controlling aggregation via delicate molecular engineering is an undeniably effective way to achieve efficient OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have undergone great advancement in the past few years with the combined efforts from materials development, device engineering and physics.1–5 Typical bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) structured OSCs possess an active layer usually composed of a blend of electron donors and acceptors. With booming polymer donors and fused-ring acceptors (FRAs), OSCs have broken power conversion efficiency (PCE) records, over 16% in single-junction binary and ternary devices.6–14 Compared with fullerene derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors show attractive advantages, such as diversified molecular structures, tuneable optical absorptions and energy levels as well as and balanced solubility and aggregation.15
FRAs are the most remarkable nonfullerene acceptors and have constantly refreshed PCE records for OSCs.10–12,16–19 Generally, FRAs containing a fused-ring electron-donating core and two electron-accepting flanks realize enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to broaden optical absorption and thereby improve the conversion of solar energy. The most widely used donating blocks for constructing FRAs include thiophene (T), thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (TTT), benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol (DTP).20–27 These aromatic rings fused with a conjugated donating core inevitably lead to a rigid planar backbone. Besides, the electron-withdrawing end-capped groups, for example, 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) and its fluorinated or chlorinated derivatives, would greatly extend the conjugated backbone and induce an excessive aggregation tendency. Inappropriate aggregation damages BHJ morphology, and thus becomes an obstacle for the improvement of OSCs.
Alkyl- or aryl-based side chains are widely introduced on FRAs to promote solubility, fix optimal configuration, and weaken the momentum of spontaneous and excessive molecular aggregation.28–38 ITIC series are representative of classic and efficient FRAs, which were designed with four side chains sticking out from two sp3-hybridized carbons in an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core.39–42 The intrinsic steric effect forces these chains to hold up at both sides of the rigid plane of the fused-ring core. These side chains with strong steric hindrance play an important role in inhibiting molecular aggregation while improving solubility. It should be noted that side chain engineering aimed at these bulky four-chain systems usually requires modification of at least two (four, in most cases) chains simultaneously,43,44 which could increase the cost and difficulty of synthesis. What is more, it may induce tremendous changes of molecular characteristics such as solubility, optical absorption, intermolecular interaction, and BHJ morphology properties. How to regulate molecular aggregation by side chain engineering in fine and convenient ways is a challenge for materials chemists. Note that some side chains in FRAs are modified on sp2-hybridized carbon or nitrogen atoms, showing smaller steric hindrance than that of a pair of chains attached on one sp3-hybridized carbon. In most cases, these chains show lateral stretch conformation relative to the conjugated plane and only provide partial function against molecular aggregation. Though the modification of the side chains is relatively moderate, the final performance of OSCs could be dramatically improved.
Side-chain engineering on DTP with sp2-hybridized nitrogen has been proved promising to construct new organic semiconductors due to their excellent electron-donating ability.45–48 Our group has developed indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) (INP) based symmetric FRAs with a pair of linear or branched N-alkyl chains. Consequently, INPIC-EH and INPIC-BO with branched chains obtain an obviously lower PCE than INPIC-4F equipped with two linear octyl chains (C8).49 Meanwhile, we found that the replacement of fluorine atoms of INPIC-4F with chlorine gave the resulting molecule extremely poor solubility and strong crystallinity, so that it was difficult for device fabrication. However, when two branched 2-butyl-1-octyl (BO) side chains were introduced into N-positions of the INP core, the resultant IPIC-4Cl exhibited better PCEs in OSCs than INPIC-4F.50 Given the above consideration, modifying N-alkyl chains in FRAs is a facile and efficient approach to tackle the problem of balancing solubility and aggregation in backbone engineering.
Asymmetric FRAs such as TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F with asymmetric electron-donating cores are still attached with symmetric p-hexylphenyl groups.51 Because the common blocks of T, TT, and TTT can be directly fused into asymmetric FRAs without attaching any extra side chain, their design of asymmetric FRAs does not need to consider the symmetry of side chains. However, DTP bearing one sp2-N atom must be bonded to a side group to form an integrated and usable block. It means that fusing single N-alkyl DTP into a core backbone not only fabricates an asymmetric core but also creates an asymmetric side chain configuration for the whole molecule. Meaningfully, we only need to manipulate one N-alkyl chain in the single side of the whole backbone to fine tune the molecular characteristics. In recent years, research studies on asymmetric FRAs are springing up, however, the configuration study on asymmetric side chains of these FRAs remains severely insufficient. Compared with usual symmetric side chain systems, asymmetric side chain engineering aimed at single N-alkyl chains could have a dramatic impact on molecular stacking and aggregation no less than asymmetric backbone engineering.
Recently, our group has successfully explored N-alkyl DTP to synthesize a series of asymmetric FRAs. Among them, asymmetric IPT-2F delivered a 14% PCE when blended with PBDB-T as a polymer donor while symmetric INPIC-4F yielded a moderate PCE of 13.13%, indicating the huge potential of the asymmetric configuration.52 In this work, in order to downshift the molecular energy level and increase the redshift of optical absorption, difluorinated IC (IC-2F) and dichlorinated IC (IC-2Cl) were used as stronger electron-withdrawing groups to synthesize two asymmetric groups IPT-4F and IPT-4Cl containing a C8-DTP based core (IPT). Meanwhile, asymmetric IPTBO-4F and IPTBO-4Cl with a BO-DTP-based core (IPTBO) were designed and synthesized to explore the steric effect of branched side chains on molecular aggregation and device performance. IPT-4Cl shows a stronger tendency of aggregation and crystallization than IPTBO-4Cl. The optimized PM6:IPTBO-4Cl-based devices, as expected, achieved a higher PCE of 15% with an effective improvement in the fill factor (FF) relative to the IPT-4Cl-based devices. In contrast, IPT-4F and IPTBO-4F showed a converse device response of PCE and FF. The PM6:IPT-4F-based devices exhibited a PCE of 14.96% with a higher FF than that of PM6:IPTBO-4F-based devices. The matching and compatibility between N-alkyl chains and end-capped groups certainly deserve further exploitation in the design of photovoltaic materials (Scheme 1).

2. Results and discussion
2.1 FRA synthesis and physio-chemical properties
The synthetic route toward the four asymmetric FRAs is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis of the IPT-CHO block is elaborated in our recent work.52 We constructed the IPTBO core by adopting a similar approach, where Stille coupling, Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization and Vilsmeier reaction were involved. The targets IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl were finally synthesized in ∼80% yields via Knoevenagel condensation between IPT-CHO (or IPTBO) and IC-2F or IC-2Cl. All synthetic procedures and characterization data are provided in the ESI,† with NMR spectra and mass spectra shown in Fig. S1–S17.† A visualized difference of the aggregation of FRAs with different alkyl side chains and accepting end groups can be observed from their optical photographs of pristine solids precipitated from dichloromethane/methanol (DCM/MeOH) solutions. As shown in Fig. S18,† IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, and IPTBO-4Cl reveal homogenous particle images in dark blue and red color, while IPT-4Cl shows heavy aggregates. These FRAs have good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) over 335 °C (corresponding to 5% weight loss) in TGA analysis (Fig. S19A, ESI†).
The IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl revealed a corresponding solubility of 258, 358, 128, and 191 mg mL−1 in chloroform under ambient conditions. Both fluorinated end groups and branched BO side chains endow FRAs with much higher solubility. Elution using dichloromethane/petroleum ether (2/3 v/v) shows the decreasing trend of polarity with the employment of BO chains and chlorinated end groups Fig. S19B (ESI†). Upon elution with a bad solvent system (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether = 1:10 v/v), we find that the degree of spot tailing presented a negative correlation with solubility. In particular, IPT-4Cl could not be eluted with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:10, v/v) at all, indicating that IPT-4Cl molecules tend to aggregate (Fig. S18†) and had strong interactions with the silica gel substrate. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis shows that pristine IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, and IPTBO-4Cl have abundant historical effects (Fig. S20, ESI†). However, after eliminating the historical effects by heating, only IPTBO-4F presents melting and crystallization behaviors, which are probably attributed to the existence of long BO side chains to alleviate the molecular aggregation of the FRA molecules. In particular, IPT-4Cl didn't show any enthalpy change peak within the range of the allowed test temperature, indicating the formation of tight aggregates with deeply confined side chains and backbones.
Optical absorption spectra of four FRAs in chloroform solution and in thin films at room temperature are shown in Fig. S19C (ESI†) and Fig. 1a, respectively. According to the figures and data listed in Table 1, we find that the length of N-alkyl chains has little effect on the maximum absorption peak (λmax) and optical band gap (Eoptg) of the FRAs. From the solution to film state, the λmax values of IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl exhibit a considerable redshift with 59 and 58 nm, respectively, larger than the values of 49 and 54 nm for IPT-4F and IPTBO-4F, suggesting stronger intermolecular interactions of chlorinated FRAs. As expected, compared with IPT-4F and IPTBO-4F in the film state, IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl have a larger absorption edge (λonset) and narrower Eoptg values, which can be contributed to the enhancement of the ICT effect. An energy level diagram of the FRAs is shown in Fig. 1b, with cyclic voltammetry curves presented in Fig. S19D (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels are calculated from ionization potentials and electron affinities and calibrated by the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1.

FRAs with an IC-2Cl acceptor end tend to contribute much increased short-circuit current density (JSC) values in OSCs due to a stronger ICT effect in comparison to IC-2F based ones.53,54 However, the accompanied downshift in LUMO levels leads to reduced open-circuit voltage (VOC). By investigating the reported FRAs of ITIC-4X and BTP-4X (X represents F or Cl), we find that these chlorinated acceptors show noticeably downshifted LUMO levels by 100 meV.9,53 Compared with our fluorinated FRAs (IPT-4F and IPTBO-4F), the chlorinated counterparts show slightly downshifted LUMO levels by 30 and 10 meV for IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl, respectively. It is worth noting that the introduction of BO chains elevates LUMO levels slightly, which may also be beneficial to the VOC of the OSCs.
2.2 Theoretical calculation study
The end group IC-2Cl has been used as a strong electron-withdrawing unit in several efficient FRAs.55–57 The IC-2Cl with a large dipole moment can provide the FRAs with a more advantageous ICT effect than IC-2F.53 It is known that the Cl atom obviously has a larger van der Waals radius than the F atom, and the C–Cl bond is longer than the C–F one. Certainly, when compared with IC-2F based FRAs, their IC-2Cl based counterparts exhibit a larger molecular surface area and thus afford larger planum to enhance molecular aggregation and stacking. However, the visualized acceptor size has been rarely calculated and definitely expressed. Herein, with the aid of Multiwfn software and VMD software,58,59 we conducted the theoretical calculation of molecular size and surface electrostatic potential (ESP) with the definition of the electron density level of 0.001 e Bohr−3 as the van der Waals surface. All the calculation methods are presented in the ESI.† As we can see from the ESP diagram in Fig. 1c, the DTP-T-4Cl backbone decorated by IC-2Cl has an observably greater distance between two opposite halogen atoms than the IC-2F-based DTP-T-4F backbone. The maximum backbone distances of DTP-T-4Cl and DTP-T-4F are 34.84 and 33.29 Å, respectively, and their difference reaches 1.55 Å (roughly equal to the C–F bond length). The surface area of the DTP-T-4F and DTP-T-4Cl backbones is calculated to be 757.7 and 810.6 Å2, respectively, and the latter is 7 percent larger than the former. Under the same side chain combination, FRAs with a larger size and area of the conjugated plane can hold stronger aggregation and stacking, which may damage the blend morphology and phase separation. These differences in molecular size can explain the lower solubility and stronger aggregation of IC-2Cl-based FRAs. This behaviour is extremely obvious for IPT-4Cl, which bears short C8 side chains but larger Cl accepting ends.
In order to suppress the strong aggregation of FRAs, the introduction of bulky branched side chains such as BO chains to the FRA backbone is one of the simplest and most easily accessible approaches. At present, the simulation research of side chain conformation is still superficial and unvalued. Here, to simplify the calculation, we extracted two fragments (DTP-C8 and DTP-BO) from IPT and IPTBO to explore the steric effect of N-alkyl chains (Fig. 2). Via spinning the C–N bond to scan the rotamers, the minimum energy points (P1 and P2 for DTP-C8 and T1 and T2 for DTP-BO) were observed from energy curves against torsion angle. The corresponding side chain conformations are presented with three perspectives. As shown, the preferred lateral stretch conformations relative to the conjugated plane are observed for the well-aligned C8 chains, which exerts negligible impact against molecular aggregation. However, one arm of the branched BO chain can stretch to the positions that are approximately perpendicular to the backbone plane, which would effectively suppress molecular aggregation. It should be noted that the out-of-plane conformation of the branched BO chains is taken under the condition of aryl chain hindrance. These preferred C8 and BO conformations may explain the differences of solubility and aggregation of the four acceptors. At the same time, since the backbone of DTP-T-4F has a smaller backbone plane, the introduction of bulky BO chains may unduly weaken the intermolecular interaction.
 Fig. 2  Theoretical simulation of optimal N-alkyl chain conformations by a potential energy surface scan for a (A) linear octyl chain based fragment and (B) 2-butyl-1-octyl chain based fragment. 
Based on the above discussion, the size and shape of N-alkyl side chains and halogen end-capped groups may have combined effects on molecular aggregation and stacking behaviours. We assume the bulky BO chains have actual steric hindrance to obstruct backbone stacking like the p-hexylphenyl chains, but the C8 chains can't generate the same obstacle. Then we make an assumption that the maximum bare length (Lb) of the backbone's flank plane can extend to two different positions for C8 and BO-based cores, as shown in Fig. 3. Due to the hindrance of the BO chains, the Lb at the DTP side of IPTBO-4F and IPTBO-4Cl is obviously shortened compared with that of IPT-4F and IPT-4Cl. The total Lb of the two flanks is estimated to be 28.01, 24.31, 29.56, and 25.85 Å for IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl, respectively. IPT-4Cl, with the biggest total Lb could induce the strongest aggregation, and further harm the blend morphology. After replacing the C8 chains in IPT-4Cl with the BO chains, the resulting IPTBO-4Cl shows a better solubility and weakened crystallinity. By contrast, with the smallest total Lb, it could be hard for IPTBO-4F to form effective stacking arrangements. IPT-4F and IPTBO-4Cl with a median total Lb may possess an optimal balance of solubility, aggregation and stacking.

2.3 GIWAXS measurement of the pristine FRAs
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to evaluate the calculations and predictions of the pristine molecular stacking behaviors. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding 1D profiles are shown in Fig. 4. The pure films of the four acceptors have an approximate (010) π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.77–1.78 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which is associated with a stacking distance of 3.54 Å via d = 2π/q. However, the pure IPTBO-4F film has the weakest (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction among the four acceptors, along with a particular edge-on lamellar stacking peak at 0.33 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting a loose stacking and multiple stacking order.

Compared with fluorinated acceptors, IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl possess not only pronounced (010) π–π stacking peaks and (100) lamellar stacking peaks, but also a relatively low sensitivity to the intervention of the bulky BO chains. The IPTBO-4Cl film shows a slightly weakened intensity of π–π stacking diffraction, and is accompanied by a smaller qxy = 0.31 Å−1 than the qxy = 0.32 Å−1 of IPT-4Cl, corresponding to a (100) lamellar spacing of 10.1 and 9.8 Å−1, respectively. The larger area of the conjugated backbone resulting from bigger Cl atoms and C–Cl bond length has a major impact on the enhancement of face-on π–π stacking. In addition, the intervention of BO chains in stacking behaviors is more efficient for the DTP-T-4F backbone than the DTP-T-4Cl backbone, which could be explained by the larger dipole moment of 1,2-dichlorobenzene than the 1,2-difluorobenzene isolated molecule.60 The enhanced dipole moment provides extra driving force for molecular stacking. On the whole, these results are in accordance with the above molecular characteristics, theoretical calculations and assumption.
2.4 Photovoltaic performance
As these FRAs have low HOMO energy levels, PM6 with matched energy levels was selected as the polymer donor. The photovoltaic properties of these asymmetric FRAs were evaluated with a conventional device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:FRA/PDIN/Al. The optimum active layers were obtained by spin-coating the PM6:acceptor (1:1, w/w) mixture solution in chloroform, followed by carbon disulfide vapour treatment for 60 s, then thermal annealing at 80 °C for 5 min. Device construction details can be found in the ESI,† and the J–V curves and statistics are presented in Fig. 5A and Table 2. Finally, an optimal PCE of 15% with a VOC of 0.893 V, and a JSC of 23.15 mA cm−2 along with an FF of 72.57% was obtained for the IPTBO-4Cl-based OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, a 15% PCE is by far the highest PCE value for binary OSCs with asymmetric FRAs (Table S1, ESI†), and exceeds the 14% PCE of PBDB-T:IPT-2F-based devices as earlier reported by our group.49 The PM6:IPT-4F-based devices also yielded a good PCE of 14.96% with a VOC of 0.914 V, a JSC of 22.08 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.15%. By contrast, IPTBO-4F- and IPT-4Cl-based devices achieved relatively lower PCE values of 14.67% and 14.40%, respectively. Because the length of N-alkyl side chains did not make arresting differences in VOC and JSC, lower FF values become the decisive factor, reducing the photovoltaic performance for IPTBO-4F and IPT-4Cl based OSCs. As shown in Fig. 5B, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the four optimized OSCs exhibit a strong photoresponse in a long-wavelength range. Impressively, IPTBO-4Cl-based OSCs show over 80% EQE from 570 to 790 nm. The JSC obtained from J–V measurements are well consistent with the JSC values integrated from the EQE curves (within 3.3% mismatch).

The effect of N-alkyl chains on electron transport properties of the four asymmetric FRA films was investigated with the space charge limited current (SCLC) test. The calculated electron mobilities (μe) were 5.84 × 10−4, 3.65 × 10−4, 6.99 × 10−4, and 5.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl, respectively (Fig. S21A, ESI†). As expected, the steric hindrance of the bulky BO chains brings down the μe values, no matter for the fluorinated or chlorinated acceptors. Excitingly, the μe values seem to have a close correlation with the total Lb discussed above, which means that the assumption of Lb is reasonable and the N-alkyl chains have a certain influence on electron mobility. A smaller C8 chain ensures stacking compactness, and larger chlorinated end groups extend the area of intermolecular interaction, thus resulting in better μe values. As shown in Fig. S21B, C and Table S2 (ESI†), the blend films of PM6:IPT-4F and PM6:IPTBO-4Cl show better electron mobilities. In addition, one of the key factors of OSC performance is the balance of hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe). The μh/μe values of the blend films based on IPT-4F and IPTBO-4Cl (1.41 and 1.58, respectively) are more balanced than the values of IPTBO-4F- and IPT-4Cl-based blends (1.59 and 1.82, respectively). The balanced μh/μe value would be due to the suitable and coordinating blend aggregation behaviour, which is condutive to yielding a high FF.
The exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection of the optimized devices is also investigated (Fig. S22 & S23 and Table S3, ESI†). The curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) show that all devices reached the saturation current density (Jsat) at low Veff. Jph/Jsat values under short-circuit conditions and all achieved a close dissociation efficiency of 96%, and Jph/Jsat values under maximal power conditions possess higher charge collection efficiency for PM6:IPT-4F and PM6:IPTBO-4Cl devices. The effect of bimolecular recombination behaviour on current extraction can be described by JSC ∝ PS.61–63 A linear relation between JSC and P (light intensity) represents the slope (S) equal to 1, which means that charge extraction is not affected by bimolecular recombination. The devices based on IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl show the S values of 0.982, 0.976, 0.967, and 0.977, respectively (Fig. 5C). The relatively low S values of the IPTBO-4F- and IPT-4Cl-based devices mean that charge recombination at short circuit is somewhat limited by bimolecular recombination. The trap-assisted recombination behaviors for the fluorinated and chlorinated acceptors are compared separately (Fig. 5D). The IPT-4F-based devices feature a smaller slope of 1.06 kT/q than 1.11 kT/q for IPTBO-4F-based devices, whereas a lower slope of 1.11 kT/q for IPTBO-4Cl-based devices was found in comparison to 1.18 kT/q for IPT-4Cl-based ones. The bigger slopes of IPTBO-4F and IPT-4Cl are indicative of more trap-assisted recombination, which means that trap states cause damage to the charge carrier, thus inducing to a lower FF.64,65 The above results indicate that both recombination behaviors drag the performance of IPTBO-4F- and IPT-4Cl-based devices down simultaneously.
2.5 Blend morphology and aggregation
In order to analyse the morphology characteristics, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. S24 (ESI†), the pristine acceptor films of IPT-4F and IPTBO-4Cl exhibit moderate phase separation. However, the IPTBO-4F film can hardly form a distinct phase pattern from its phase image. In contrast, an IPT-4Cl film shows an obviously granular phase, indicating a strong aggregation property. For blend systems, the influence of BO intervention on blend morphologies is clearly different for the acceptors equipped with fluorinated or chlorinated end-capped groups (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  (A–D) AFM height images of the optimized blend films, (E–H) AFM phase images of the optimized blend films. 
The PM6:IPT-4F film shows a thick but relatively sparse fibril texture, indicating a suitable aggregation and phase separation, while the PM6:IPTBO-4F film shows close-grained fibril-like phases.66 The weak self-aggregation capability of IPTBO-4F makes the blend fail to form an efficient acceptor accumulation phase, which indicates IPTBO-4F formed rich interactions with polymer segments and thus good miscibility among them to show small phase separation. Note that the AFM images of the pristine PM6 film (Fig. S25, ESI†) are roughly similar to the images of the IPTBO-4F film. For a high miscibility blend system, the aggregation characteristics of PM6 could dominate the blend morphology. By comparing the four phase images, we can find that the blend film of PM6:IPT-4Cl shows the thickest and densest fibril texture, suggesting the existence of strong aggregation tendency. In this case, IPT-4Cl and PM6 reveal a synergy to enhance blend aggregation and stacking. By contrast, a more balanced micro-phase separation with a promotional Rq value is exposed in the IPTBO-4Cl-based blend, thus providing enough channels for charge transport and inhibiting recombination losses.31 As seen from the TEM images presented in Fig. S26 (ESI†), the PM6:IPT-4F film shows a stronger aggregation along with deep channel textures, while the PM6:IPTBO-4F film does not form a distinguishable phase or fibril shape. Both IPT-4Cl- and IPTBO-4Cl-based blend films exhibit close fibril channels, however, the latter has an obvious phase separation, which tallies with the AFM analysis.
Further, the stacking characteristics of the blends were assessed by GIWAXS measurements. From PM6:IPT-4F to PM6:IPTBO-4F, an enhanced (010) π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction is found, but, along with a down shift peak from qz = 1.75 Å−1 (d = 3.59 Å) to qz = 1.72 Å−1 (d = 3.65 Å), as shown in Fig. 7. The enlarged distance suggests a decreased tightness of blend π–π stacking for PM6:IPTBO-4F. Meanwhile, the weak self-aggregation ability and excessive miscibility make IPTBO-4F attach to PM6 conjugated segments more favorably, which enhances the intermolecular stacking between PM6 and IPTBO-4F. Besides, the (100) lamellar stacking peak of PM6:IPTBO-4F in an edge-on orientation (qz = 0.31 Å−1) is quite strong, which exerts an adverse effect on charge transport. The (010) peak position presents similar qz values of 1.77 and 1.76 Å−1 for IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl, respectively. The (010) diffraction intensity of the IPTBO-4Cl-based blend dropped significantly, which means the introduction of the BO chains effectively restrains strong π–π stacking of the blend system. In addition, the (100) lamellar stacking signal in a face-on orientation is located at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) and qxy = 0.31 Å−1 (d = 20.3 Å) for IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4Cl, respectively, which indicates a compact lamellar stacking.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a series of fused-ring electron acceptors featuring asymmetric dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-phenylene-thiophene cores to balance the aggregation effect by combined molecular engineering of N-alkyl chains and end-capped groups. Productive calculations were performed to analyse and predict the combined effect of the backbone size and N-alkyl chain conformation on molecular stacking and aggregation. The introduction of large chlorine substituents in terminal groups notably extends the backbone stacking area and enhances molecular aggregation. In order to restrain excessive aggregation, IPTBO-4Cl with an intervention of bulky BO chains was designed, and the resulting PM6:IPTBO-4Cl devices yielded an excellent PCE of 15%. However, for smaller fluorinated conjugated backbones, a straight C8 chain with quite low steric hindrance is more proper to form moderate and efficient stacking. The OSCs based on IPT-4F also achieved a PCE close to 15% with a high FF of 74.2%. To the best of our knowledge, a 15% PCE is among the highest values for binary OSCs based on asymmetric FRAs. By contrast, the aggregation intensity of IPT-4Cl and IPTBO-4F deviates far from the optimal range, thus inducing undesirable blend morphologies and charge transport properties. For the design of high-efficiency FRAs, both side chain and the terminal group engineering are equally important and need combined consideration, so that the resulting FRA-based OSCs can achieve a satisfactory photovoltaic performance.
