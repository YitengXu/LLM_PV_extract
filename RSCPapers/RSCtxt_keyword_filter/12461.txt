In the absence of noble metals, a high quantum yield of 42% was achieved at 420 nm.
Conversion of solar energy to chemical energy by producing hydrogen fuel from water splitting has been one of the attractive strategies to address the environmental crises and energy shortage issues.1 Since the first discovery by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,2 semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting have been extensively studied. Great efforts have been devoted to developing strategies for improving the efficiency of the photocatalysts. One commonly used method for controlling the band structure is forming solid solution between wide and narrow band gap semiconductors.3 Cd1−xZnxS is one of the most extensively studied sulfides solid solution due to its controllable band structure and excellent performance under visible light irradiation.4 However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 evolution for these solid solutions is far from satisfying level owing to the rapid recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes in photocatalysts. Therefore, it is highly desirable to optimize the photocatalytic system, aiming not only to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, but also to facilitate their transport pathways. One strategy is to modify the surface of photocatalysts with co-catalysts (normally noble-metals such as Pt and Pd) by forming Schottky junctions and lowering the activation potentials for H2 evolution. To reduce the cost of photocatalytic H2 production, it is necessary to explore alternative inexpensive co-catalysts. Recently, some transition-metal compounds such as MoS2, NiS have been found to be potential co-catalysts for water reduction.5
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of molecular metal-oxo cluster compounds based mainly on Mo, W, V, Nb and Ta elements, exhibit remarkably rich redox and photochemical properties.6 Among POMs, polyoxoniobates are of particular interest for photocatalysis because some dense niobates have been used for overall water-splitting photocatalysts. Recently, several molecular photocatalytic systems based on polyoxoniobates and polytantalotungstates have been studied for water splitting into H2.7 However, their large band gaps make them only UV-active and have to be assisted by noble metal Pt cocatalyst. In addition, the low yield of these crystalline compounds limits their practical application. Our recent researches found that POMs could act as electron acceptors to promote the power conversion efficiency of semiconductor thin-film solar cells.8 However, POMs are rarely used in semiconductor-based photocatalytic H2 production systems.9 Therefore, we attempt to introduce the effect of POMs on the photocatalytic H2 evolution systems of semiconductors.
Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a low-cost and stable K7HNb6O19–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S photocatalytic system. It is shown that the activity of Cd0.65Zn0.35S is enhanced by the presence of the polyoxoniobate K7HNb6O19 (Linqvist structure,10 denoted as Nb6) and NiS as cocatalysts. The H2 evolution rate is increased to 3.4 times that of Cd0.65Zn0.35S. With the optimization of the concentration of the sacrificial reagents, a high quantum yield of 42% at 420 nm was achieved without any noble-metal co-catalyst. The high photocatalytic activity arises from the positive synergetic effect between Nb6 and NiS in the cocatalysts, which serve as electron collectors and active adsorption sites.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cd0.65Zn0.35S samples exhibit hexagonal phase as shown in Fig. S1.† The successive shifts of the XRD patterns, compared with pure CdS, indicate that the crystals obtained were not a mixture of ZnS and CdS, but Cd1−xZnxS solid solution.4a The weak signals of NiS in the Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample indicate that NiS could possibly adopt a rhombohedral structure.5b No characteristic diffraction peaks associated with Nb6 was observed, suggesting that Nb6 is highly dispersed on the surface of Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample.11 The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of Cd0.65Zn0.35S and Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S were displayed in Fig. S2.† The Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample has an absorption edge at about 540 nm, with an energy gap estimated to be 2.46 eV. What's more, an enhanced absorption was observed in the spectrum of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S in the visible light region from 500 nm to 800 nm, which is attributed to the NiS loaded on Cd0.65Zn0.35S.12
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were carried out to determine the surface chemical compositions and electronic state of the as-prepared samples. The survey scan spectrum (Fig. S3a†) confirms the presence of Cd, Zn, S, Ni, Nb and O in the composite sample, which indicates the successful synthesis of the Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S composites. The peak located at 1023.3 eV in Fig. S3b† corresponds to the Zn 2p3/2 level, and the two sharp peaks at 405.2 and 412.0 eV are attributed to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 level, respectively. Meanwhile, the binding energy values for Ni 2p and Nb 3d (Fig. S3b†) are in agreement with the data reported in the literature.5b,13 In addition, the two subpeaks at 161.2 and 162.4 eV can be assigned to S 2p in Cd0.65Zn0.35S and NiS, respectively (Fig. S3a†).5b The XPS results confirm that Nb6 and NiS were successfully loaded on the surface of Cd0.65Zn0.35S and no valence change was found after they were introduced into the composite photocatalysts. However, slight binding energy shifts for Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, compared with pure Cd1−xZnxS,4c might derive from the electronic interactions among Nb6, NiS and Cd0.65Zn0.35S.
The SEM image reveals that the Cd0.65Zn0.35S nanoparticles are in the range of 110–230 nm (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig 1b, aggregated NiS nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of Cd0.65Zn0.35S. And Nb6 was dispersed on the surface of Cd0.65Zn0.35S and NiS nanoparticles (Fig 1c). The presence of NiS on the Cd0.65Zn0.35S surface is further evidenced by the HRTEM images (Fig. S4†). Although the HRTEM image does not show lattice fringes corresponding to Nb6, the existence of Nb is evidenced from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (Fig 1d). It is suggested that amorphous state Nb6 exists in the as-prepared Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S. These results are in accordance with the XRD and XPS analyses.

Fig. 2 shows the rate of H2 evolution on the pristine Cd0.65Zn0.35S solid solution and Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S photocatalysts, together with that on NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, Nb6/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, Nb6–Pt/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, NiS and Nb6 for comparison. As seen in Fig. 2, no H2 was detected when NiS or Nb6 was alone used as the photocatalyst, suggesting that both NiS and Nb6 are inactive for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light. Cd0.65Zn0.35S alone shows activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution with a rate of 982 μmol h−1 g−1. After loading 1 wt% of NiS on Cd0.65Zn0.35S, the rate of H2 evolution on NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S is increased to 1.29 mmol h−1 g−1. When 1 wt% Nb6 is further introduced into NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, the H2 evolution rate is remarkably increased to 3.34 mmol h−1 g−1, which is about 3.4 times that obtained on the pure Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample and 2.6 times that of NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S. However, as for the Nb6/Cd0.65Zn0.35S system in the absence of NiS, the photocatalytic H2 production activity decreased compared with that of pure Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample owing to the lack of active sites for H2 evolution. The excellent photocatalytic activity of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S is even higher than that on Nb6–Pt/Cd0.65Zn0.35S. These results indicate that three components Nb6, NiS and Cd0.65Zn0.35S are well matched in the photocatalyst system with Nb6 and NiS as electron collectors and active adsorption sites. Photocatalytic activities of NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S photocatalysts with different NiS contents have also been investigated and the sample with 1 wt% NiS gave the highest H2 production. Therefore, 1 wt% NiS was applied in all Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S composites.

To optimize the photocatalytic conditions for the highest hydrogen yield, the amount of Nb6 loaded on NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S have been investigated. The rate of H2 evolution on Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S samples with different amount of Nb6 were shown in Fig. S5.† After loading only 0.5 wt% of Nb6 on NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S, the rate of H2 evolution is increased from 1.29 mmol h−1 g−1 to 2.01 mmol h−1 g−1. With the increase of the amount of Nb6, the rate of H2 evolution on Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S is increased further and achieves a maximum of 4.16 mmol h−1 g−1 when the loading amount of Nb6 on NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S is 2 wt%. However, when the amount of Nb6 is above 2 wt%, the hydrogen evolution rate of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S decreases. It is supposed that excessive Nb6 will become the recombination centers for photogenerated carriers as electron trap filling sites.8
In order to promote the reducing half reaction in water splitting process, the effect of the concentration of sacrificial reagent was also studied. As shown in Fig. S6,† the remarkably improved H2 evolution activity (7.06 mmol h−1 g−1) was achieved on Nb6 (2 wt%)–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S photocatalyst when the concentration of the sacrificial reagents increases from 0.1 M Na2S/0.1 M Na2SO3 to 0.25 M Na2S/0.35 M Na2SO3. However, further increasing the concentration of sacrificial reagents hardly improved the activity. The apparent quantum yield (QY) using the optimized photocatalyst was 42% at 420 nm, which is close to the highest efficiency for Cd1−xZnxS-based photocatalysts ever reported.14
A tentative mechanism proposed for the high H2 production activity of the Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample is illustrated in Fig. 3. Under visible light illumination, the valence band (VB) electrons of Cd0.65Zn0.35S are excited to the conduction band (CB), creating holes in the VB. The CB electrons of Cd0.65Zn0.35S can be injected into Nb6 because the Nb6O198−/Nb6O199− redox potential (−0.38 eV) is lower than the CB of Cd0.65Zn0.35S. Then NiS is proposed to be able to trap the electrons, forming at first the intermediate HNiS (reaction (1)), and then electrochemically release H2 (reaction (2)),12 though NiS occupies much lower CB position compared to the reduction potential of H+/H2.

The process is similar to the cathodic H2 evolution reactions in electrolysis. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes will migrate to the surface to react with the sacrificial agents. The realization of such a high efficiency might be due to a synergetic effect between Nb6 and NiS on Cd0.65Zn0.35S, including the suppression of charge recombination, improvement of interfacial charge transfer, and an increase in the number of active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers.
Metal sulfides are usually not stable during the photocatalytic reaction and subjected to the photocorrosion. Fig. S7† shows the stability test of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S samples for hydrogen evolution. The photocatalytic activity of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S did not show any deactivation in the first 6 h and then decreased slightly after 8 h in one continuous reaction (12 h). The decreased activity could be ascribed to the reduced concentration of sacrificial reagents. After a continuous reaction for 12 h, the photocatalyst was centrifuged and then stored overnight. The next day the photocatalyst was redispersed in a new reaction solution with fresh sacrificial reagents. The photocatalytic activity of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S was recovered in the third cycle and even higher than the first cycle, which might be due to the reorganization of the active sites on the surface of the photocatalysts.15 A similar activity was obtained as for the fourth cycle, which implied the composite photocatalyst Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S has an enhanced photostability.
In order to understand the effect of Nb6 and NiS in the photocatalytic activity, the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) measurements16 and photoluminescent (PL) measurements were performed on the powder samples of the Cd0.65Zn0.35S, NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S and Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S. As shown in Fig. S8,† the weak photovoltaic response band of Cd0.65Zn0.35S appears at 300–550 nm, which can be mainly assigned to the electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band. By contrast, the photovoltaic response band of NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S became stronger. The strongest photovoltaic response of Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S suggests that the positive synergetic effect between Nb6 and NiS can promote the separation and transfer of photoinduced electron and holes in Cd0.65Zn0.35S. In addition, the fluorescence of NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S and Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S is clearly quenched compared to that of Cd0.65Zn0.35S (Fig. S9†). The photoinduced electron transfer from CdS to NiS and/or Nb6 should be responsible for the fluorescence quenching. Therefore, the introduction of Nb6 and NiS in the composite photocatalyst could effectively suppress the charge recombination, leaving more photoinduced electron to form reactive species, which in turn results in high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate.
In conclusion, the enhanced performance of photocatalytic H2 evolution was achieved under visible light over Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S using a feasible coprecipitation-surface loading strategy. The as-prepared Nb6–NiS/Cd0.65Zn0.35S sample reached a high H2 evolution rate of 7.59 mmol h−1 g−1 with 2 wt% Nb6 and 1% NiS loaded and the QY of 42% at 420 nm. This work represents a significant advance in preparation of Cd1−xZnxS based composite catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution by using POMs and transition-metal sulfides as cocatalysts.
