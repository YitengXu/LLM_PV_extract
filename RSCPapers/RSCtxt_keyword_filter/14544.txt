The non-volatility, good solvent properties and high electrochemical stability of ionic liquids make them attractive solvents in contrast to volatile organic solvents. Despite this, the relatively high viscosity of ionic liquids leads to mass-transport limitations. Here we review recent developments in the application of different ionic liquids as solvents or components of liquid and quasi-solid electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells.Mikhail GorlovMikhail Gorlov was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and received his PhD in Chemistry from the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology in 2002. He was a postdoctoral fellow (2003–2004) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, and he is currently a researcher at the Inorganic Chemistry Department, KTH. His research interest focuses on the syntheses of new ionic liquids and their application as electrolyte media for dye-sensitized solar cells.Lars KlooLars Kloo received his PhD in Inorganic Chemistry at Lund University, Sweden, in 1990, and moved to his current position as Professor in Inorganic Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm in 1998. During 1991–95 he was, for shorter or longer periods, a visiting scientist in other laboratories in the UK, USA and New Zealand. His interest in ionic liquids dates back to the end of the 1980s, when he started to use such media both as electrolytes and for inorganic synthesis of new organometallic and inorganic compounds and materials.
1. Introduction
Solar radiation has a great potential as source of energy. Solar energy is typically referred to as a source of “renewable” energy, although it for practical reasons rather should be regarded as an inexhaustible source for energy conversion. Nevertheless, for this reason a large number of academic and industrial research groups investigate the possibility to construct new photovoltaic devices (as alternatives to the well-developed, but relatively expensive, silicon solar cells) for the conversion of solar energy to electricity or alternatively to fuels. After the discovery of a principally new type of solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 much effort was invested to make this type of molecular devices more efficient and stable. Up to now, maximum light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 11% at full sunlight (100 mW/cm2) have been recorded.2 Moreover, long-term stability tests (prolonged illumination and thermal stress) show promising results.2
Generally, a DSSC consists of a photoanode (WE) with a thin layer of nanostructured wide band-gap semiconductor attached to the conducting substrate (TiO2 has been almost exclusively used as a semiconductor in high performance DSSCs) and a monolayer of organometallic or organic dye D adsorbed onto the nanoparticles of the semiconductor (Fig. 1). Photoexcitation of the dye molecules (eqn (1)) is followed by ultrafast injection of the electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor (eqn (2)). The electrons are withdrawn to an external circuit and returned to the system by reduction of an oxidized component of the electrolyte redox couple RC+ (eqn (3)). The oxidized dye D+ is finally regenerated by the reduced component of the redox couple RC (eqn (4)). D/TiO2 + hν → D*/TiO2(1) D*/TiO2 → D+/TiO2 + e−/TiO2(2) RC+ + e−/CE → RC(3) D+/TiO2 + RC → D/TiO2 + RC+(4)

Up to now, the most efficient DSSCs are based on nanostructured TiO2 as a semiconductor, ruthenium(II) bipyridyl complexes as sensitizers, and electrolytes consisting of volatile organic solvents with an iodide/triiodide redox couple.2
In spite of the promising efficiency and long-term stability of DSSCs, there are several factors limiting their industrial application, such as:
 
• ruthenium(II) dyes are expensive and sensitive to water and oxygen;
• the use of iodide/triiodide as redox couple limits the performance (open-circuit voltage) of the device;
• the use of volatile organic electrolytes makes encapsulation of DSSCs difficult.
 
Attractive alternatives to volatile organic solvents are non-volatile, room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs). Ionic liquids possess high chemical and thermal stability, relative non-flammability and wide electrochemical window.3 Ionic liquids are composed of aromatic or non-aromatic organic cations and various anions (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Examples of the cationic and anionic parts of ionic liquids. 
Ionic liquids based on imidazolium salts have been widely used as solvents for DSSCs. However, the relatively high viscosity of this type of imidazolium ionic liquids appears to limit their use because of transport limitations: diffusion coefficients of the redox-couple components (I3−) in ionic liquid electrolytes are about 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those in volatile organic solvents. As a consequence, the efficiency of the reduction of oxidized dye D+ by the reduced form of the redox couple is limited, especially at high illumination intensities, thus decreasing the overall performance of the DSSCs.
In general, ionic liquids were studied in DSSCs first of all as non-volatile solvents for electrolytes, in contrast to commonly used organic solvents, such as acetonitrile. An alternative way to solve the problem of slow diffusion of ions in viscous solvents such as ILs is to use organic or inorganic hole-conductor materials. Unfortunately, low hole-conductivity, formation of crystals in the cell and poor semiconductor-electrolyte interface interaction so far has limited their use.
It is important to note that in spite of high volatility of organic solvents such as nitriles, many IL electrolytes are diluted with organic solvents. The decrease of viscosity is not the only factor. Thus, it was found8 that a high concentration of imidazolium iodides leads to effective quenching of the dye molecules (eqn (5)): D*/TiO2 + 2I− → D−/TiO2 + I2−˙(5)
Moreover, a reduced D− does not effectively inject electrons into the semiconductor. According calculations, approximately 25% of the ruthenium dye Z907Na undergoes reductive quenching in the presence of pure 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMImI).8
In spite of these difficulties, much progress has been achieved in the synthesis of low-viscosity ILs and their application as solvents for electrolytes in DSSCs. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the application of ionic liquids as solvents or components of liquid and quasi-solid electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells. The results from literature are also in a compressed form summarized in Tables 1 and 2, where the former table is dedicated to results for ILs as pure electrolytes, whereas the latter contains results from quasi-solid electrolytes based on ILs.
2. Ionic liquids as solvents for electrolytes
2.1. Electrolytes based on imidazolium ionic liquids
Room-temperature ionic liquids based on imidazolium cations (Table 1) were realized to be promising solvents, alternative to volatile organic solvents, such as nitriles, more than ten years ago.4 Room-temperature molten salt systems based on 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (HMImI) in combination with the ruthenium-based dye N-3, Ru(L)2(SCN)2 (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, Fig. 3), have been used to scrutinize the performance characteristics, the stability and the mass-transfer effects in DSSCs.4

          Cell performance showed high stability, with an estimated sensitizer turnover in excess of 50 million. An investigation has been carried out on the physical–electrochemical properties of HMImI and its mixtures with organic solvents, such as acetonitrile, and with other lower viscosity ILs, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate (EMImTf). On the basis of the measurements of diffusion coefficients of I3− in pure HMImI, it was proposed that electron exchange, a Grotthus-type charge carrier mechanism, influences the overall transport with increasing iodine concentration.4 This may be represented as follows:I3− + I− → I−–I2⋯I− → I− ⋯I2–I− → I− + I3−
Later, it was confirmed that triiodide might be transferred to the counter electrode not only by diffusion, but also by a Grotthus-like, non-diffusional hopping mechanism.5 The effect of the viscosity of IL electrolyte has been investigated on the performance of DSSCs (Fig. 4). Both the short circuit photocurrent and conversion efficiency increase with decreasing viscosity of the ILs. A conversion efficiency of 2.1% was observed for a cell of EMImF·2.3HF in combination with the ruthenium-based N-3 dye at 100 mW/cm2 light intensity.5
 Fig. 4  Ionic liquids used in ref. 5. 

Imidazolium iodide ionic liquids have a relatively high viscosity, and, as consequence, mass-transport limitation problems restrict the use of these ILs as solvents for electrolytes. A large progress was achieved through the use of mixtures of imidazolium iodides and low-viscosity ionic liquids. Thus, an ionic liquid electrolyte composed of 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMImI) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMImSCN) was used in combination with the Z-907 dye (Fig. 3).6 The electrolyte contained a co-adsorbed spacer, 3-phenylpropionic acid, which increases the photocurrent. Efficiencies of the cells are found to be 7.0 and 7.7% at 1.0 or 0.1 sun illumination, respectively. The viscosity of EMImSCN is 21 cP and the diffusion coefficient of triiodide is 2.95 × 10−7 cm2/s, which is 1.6 times higher than that in the pure PMImI electrolyte.
Different additives have been used in ionic liquid electrolytes in order to enhance photocurrent or photovoltage. The use of organic nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as tert-butylpyridine61–63 and N-alkylbenzimidazoles,64 results in an improvement of the open-circuit voltage. It is believed that these compounds, being Lewis bases, are absorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor. As a consequence, the conduction band edge of the semiconductor is shifted, thus improving the photovoltage. N-Donor additives may also react with components of the electrolytes. For instance, it was recently found that N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) forms a crystalline product in organic and ionic liquid electrolytes; this crystalline material was identified to be (NMBI)6(NMBI-H+)2(I−)(I3−).65 Another important additive, controlling the self-assembly of the dye molecules, is guanidinium thiocyanate.60 Guanidinium cations are absorbed together with the dye molecules thus facilitating the formation of a compact monolayer.
An ionic liquid electrolyte composed of PMImI, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMImDCN), and lithium iodide was combined with an amphiphilic polypyridyl ruthenium-based sensitizer, Z-907, to obtain a solar cell based on a solvent-free electrolyte that had an efficiency of 6.6% at 100 mW/cm2, and >7.1% at lower light intensities.7 Two electrolytes were investigated: electrolyte A (0.1 M I2, 0.45 M NMBI in PMImI/EMImDCN, 13 : 7 by volume) and electrolyte B containing lithium iodide (0.1 M I2, 0.1 LiI, 0.45 M NMBI in PMImI/EMImDCN, 13 : 7 by volume). Laser transient absorbance measurements revealed that a significant enhancement of the device efficiency, after adding LiI to the ionic liquid electrolyte, could be ascribed to an increase in the electron injection yield and dye regeneration rate.7 In addition, the diffusion coefficient of triiodide in electrolytes A and B is found to be 4.4 × 10−7 cm2/s, which is 2.3 times higher than that in the pure PMImI electrolyte.
A 7.4% power conversion efficiency at air mass (AM) 1.5 full sunlight was reached with a solar cell employing a binary ionic liquid electrolyte composed of PMImI and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide (EMImTCM) in combination with the amphiphilic ruthenium complex NaRu(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate)(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2, coded as Z-907Na.8 The viscosity of EMImTCM is 18 cP at 22 °C, which is much lower than the viscosity of PMImI (880 cP). The electrolyte, based on PMImI/EMImTCM (1 : 1 by volume) also contained an organic additive, 1-N-methylbenzimidazole, playing the role of Lewis base and thus interacts with the TiO2 surface. The photovoltaic parameters Jsc, Voc, FF and η measured at 100 mW/cm2 were found to be 12.8 mA/cm2, 752 mV, 0.764 and 7.4%, respectively. Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric, nanosecond laser transient absorbance, and photovoltaic measurements show that a high iodide concentration is required for dye regeneration to compete efficiently with charge recombination.8
Ionic liquids based on the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation were investigated by Dai et al.9 The effect of three different anions, tricyanomethanide, dicyanamide and thiocyanate (Fig. 5), on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells were studied. Both the short circuit photocurrent and conversion efficiency increased with decreasing viscosity of the ionic liquids. A conversion efficiency of 2.1% at 30 mW/cm2 light intensity was observed when the ruthenium-based dye N-3 was used as sensitizer for the cell containing the tricyanomethanide IL, which has lowest viscosity among the three ILs. The efficiencies of 0.7 and 1.7% at the same light intensity were observed in the case of dicyanamide and thiocyanate ILs, respectively, as electrolyte.9
 Fig. 5  Low-viscosity ionic liquids used as solvents. 
A stable dye-sensitized solar cell was obtained using a new binary IL electrolyte system based on PMImI and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate.10 Photoanodes containing Z-907(Na) sensitized titanium dioxide were fabricated and DSSCs resulted in a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 6.4%, increased to 7.0% (measured at 100 mW/cm2 light intensity) when 3-phenylpropionic acid was used as a co-adsorbent/co-sensitizer.10
A highly efficient nanocrystalline DSSCs (8% efficiency at a light intensity of 99 mW/cm2), based on an amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer [Ru(4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-bis(p-hexyloxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2], coded as K-19 (Fig. 6),11 and a robust electrolyte (PMImI/3-methoxypropionitrile mixture) were reported. Long-term stability tests showed that device degradation was negligible following 1000 h of visible light soaking at 60 °C.12
 Fig. 6  The structure of the K-19 dye. 

          Imidazolium salts containing the interhalogen anions IBr2− or I2Br− have been synthesized and used as components of IL electrolytes for encapsulated monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells.13 Indications of an equilibrium between different forms of XY2− anions in solution are observed, which may indicate the presence of different redox-active species in the electrolyte. Overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies up to 6.4%, 5.0% and 2.4% at 100 mW/cm2 were achieved by using electrolytes based on interhalogen ionic salts and γ-butyrolactone, glutaronitrile or native ionic liquids as solvents, respectively. In terms of stability, the cell performance lost 9–14% of the initial efficiency after 1000 hours illumination at 35 mW/cm2.
In order to improve the performance of DSSCs containing ionic liquid electrolytes, various blocking layers may be used on the photoanode. Thus, thin Nb2O5 films act as a potential blocking layer when deposited between an F-doped tin oxide layer and a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer, improving Voc and the conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells with HMImI electrolytes in combination with the ruthenium-based sensitizer Z-907.14–16 Using Nb2O5 films, the efficiency may be enhanced from 2.8% (no blocking layer) up to 4.8% measured at 100 mW/cm2.
In order to improve properties of ionic liquids, the cationic part may also be modified. Thus, allyl-functionalized imidazolium salts, such as 1-allyl-3-ethylimidazolium iodide and 1-allyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, have been prepared and used in electrolytes for DSSCs.17 These salts have melting points close to room temperature and show properties of supercooled fluids if heated above their melting points. DSSCs containing electrolytes, based on allyl-functionalized imidazolium salts, in combination with the new ruthenium-based sensitizer K-60 (Fig. 7) show an efficiency up to 6.8% at 100 mW/cm2 as well as good long-term stability.17
 Fig. 7  The structure of the K-60 dye. 
Ionic liquid electrolytes were tested not only in combination with ruthenium-based dyes, but also together with metal-free organic sensitizers. Thus, the mixture of three imidazolium-based ionic liquids, PMImI, EMImTf and EMImTFSI (TFSI = bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), were used in conjunction with the organic indoline-based dye D-149 (Fig. 8).18 It was found that the thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film affects the photovoltaic characteristics due to limitations of the diffusion of I3− ions. Viscosities and diffusion coefficients of I3− in the acetonitrile electrolyte are 1.4 cP s and 1.63 × 10−5 cm2/s and in the ionic liquid electrolyte the corresponding values are 118 cP s and 2.48 × 10−7 cm2/s. Photovoltaic parameters for the IL-based electrolyte at 100 mW/cm2 are Voc = 612 mV, Isc = 16.13 mA/cm2, FF = 0.676, η = 6.67%.18
 Fig. 8  The structure of the indoline-based dye D-149. 

          Imidazolium ionic liquid electrolytes have also been used in combination with the organic dyes shown in Fig. 9.19 The multicolored solar cells were connected in series, and an efficiency of 2.1% at 1 sun radiation was achieved. The total semiconductor area was 25 cm2. The authors note that the length of the alkyl chain in imidazolium iodides, as well as the concentration of I2, plays a crucial role in this system. BMImI was found to be the best IL solvent; the optimal molar ratio BMImI : I2 was deduced to be 100 : 2.19
 Fig. 9  Organic dyes used in combination with ILs electrolytes. 

          Metal ions present in an IL electrolyte affect the performance of the DSSC. It was found that the addition of a small amount of CuI to an HMImI-based electrolyte leads to an enhancement of efficiency from 3.5% to 4.5%, probably because of adsorption of Cu+ onto the TiO2 porous film.20
A recent study was performed in order to compare imidazolium ILs electrolytes and organic volatile solvents containing electrolytes.21 Three electrolytes were studied: electrolyte 1 (mixture of PMImI–EMImSCN as solvent, 0.5 M NMBI and 0.12 guanidinium thiocyanate (GuanSCN) as additives, and 0.2 M I2), electrolyte 2 (PMImI as solvent, 0.5 M NMBI as additive, and 0.2 M I2), electrolyte 3 (3 : 1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile, 0.6 M PMImI, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as additive, and 0.03 M I2). The K-19 dye was used as sensitizer (Fig. 6). Important general conclusions were made on the basis of impedance spectroscopy studies: the authors note21 that the main limiting factors in the IL-based solar cells in comparison to volatile nitrile-based cells are the higher rate of recombination and lower rate of injection of charge (probably due to competitive absorption of light by I3−, slower dye regeneration, faster self-recombination of the dye and a shift of the conduction band of TiO2).
The use of the ionic liquid crystal, 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide with iodine as an electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells leads to a high short-circuit photocurrent density and a high light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. This is probably caused by a self-assembled structure of the imidazolium cations, resulting in a high conductivity of the electrolyte.22,23 The authors note that the diffusion coefficient of triiodide D in C12MImI/I2 (4.2 × 10−8 cm2/s) is larger than that of C11MeImI/I2 (3.2 × 10−8 cm2/s), whereas the viscosity of C12MeImI/I2 is 2.5 times larger than that of C11MeImI/I2.
2.2. Other types of ionic liquids
Apart from alkylimidazolium ionic liquids, other types of room-temperature molten salts have been tested as electrolytes. Thus, trialkylsulfonium ILs of the general formula (R2R′S)I have been prepared and successfully used as solvents for the electrolytes.24–26 An efficiency up to 3.7% at 0.1 sun was reached with methyldibutylsulfonium iodide (B2MS)I as electrolyte in combination with the ruthenium-based dye N-719.24 Electron transport and recombination in DSSCs based on trialkylsulfonium ILs electrolytes were investigated.25 It was found that the most viscous IL electrolytes show a limitation of the photocurrent due to a low diffusion coefficient of I3−. The electron lifetime was dependent on the type of cation in IL.25
Metal-iodide-doped trialkylsulfonium iodides and polyiodides have also been studied.26Copper and silver iodides were used as metal-containing additives. The highest over-all conversion efficiency of 3.1% at 0.1 sun was achieved with a (B2MS)I–AgI–I2 electrolyte.26
Asymmetric phosphonium ionic liquids have been prepared and used as electrolyte components for DSSCs.27,28Isobutyltrihexyl phosphonium iodide (IH3PI) shows the highest ionic conductivity at room temperature; the overall performance of solar cells with the ruthenium-based sensitizer N-3 and PC–AN electrolyte containing IH3PI–I2 was found to be 5.9% at 8.9 mW/cm2 light intensity.28
Tetraalkylammonium iodides (NR2R′2)I (R and R′ varied from CH3 to C6H13) have been synthesized and studied as electrolytes for DSSCs.29 Under illumination at 10 mW/cm2 intensity, the highest power conversion efficiency of 2.4% was obtained with dimethyldihexylammonium iodide (M2H2N)I–I2 (10 : 1) electrolyte containing TBP as additive, which may be compared to an efficiency of 5.4% obtained from similar cells with 3-methoxypropionitrile based electrolyte tested under identical conditions. The best efficiency obtained with a soft solid electrolyte, (E2H2N)I–I2 (10 : 1) with TBP, was 2.3%.29
Pyridinium ILs containing the interhalogen anions IBr2− or I2Br− have been prepared and used as solvents or components of electrolytes for DSSCs.13Glutaronitrile-based electrolytes with the [BPy]I/[BPy]IBr2 redox couple have shown a 4.5% efficiency at 1 sun illumination.
3. Quasi-solid electrolytes
In spite of great advantages with the use of ionic liquid electrolytes, it may still be desirable to replace a liquid electrolyte by a solid or gel-like electrolyte. The main motives for such a replacement arise from concerns regarding manufacturing procedures and long-term stability when a liquid electrolyte is used. A large number of publications during the last decade was devoted to the development of new solid or quasi-solid materials which may be used as electrolytes for DSSCs. Most of these materials are based on ionic liquids (Table 2). Three general approaches were introduced: the use of gelators, the use of inorganic materials for solidification of liquid electrolytes, and polymerization in IL media. However, one should in these cases formally no longer regard the ionic liquid as an ionic liquid; instead, it is essentially an electrolyte based on an organic salt dispersed in the polymer or gel used, which in reality differs little in its function from any other, inorganic or organic, salt except in terms of solubility and co-solvent properties.

Gel electrolytes consisting of ionic liquids, such as PMImI, and different gelators are reported. The gelling agents are composed of poly(vinylpyridine) (PVP) and HOOC(CH2)nCOOH (n = 4, 7, 10, 14). Gelation is caused by the reaction between PVP and the dicarboxylic acid.30
The resulting gel electrolytes were tested in combination with the ruthenium-based N-3 dye. The efficiency of the ionic liquid electrolyte before gelation was 5.2%. After gelation, the efficiency decreased to 3.4% (HOOC(CH2)12COOH) and 4.4% (HOOC(CH2)16COOH), respectively. This decrease in performance is associated with a decrease in diffusion properties of the redox-active species: the diffusion coefficient of I3− in gelated electrolytes is about 10–20% lower than that in the corresponding ionic liquid electrolyte before gelation.
A similar approach was described in refs. 31–34. PMImI was solidified with PVP and 1,2,4,5-tetra(bromomethyl)benzene (TBMB) according Scheme 1, right. Solar cells containing gel electrolytes and the N-3 dye were tested. The solidification was carried out by heating the cells after the gel electrolyte precursors were inserted into the cell in order to assure sufficient contact between the gel electrolyte and the nanoporous TiO2. An anomalous phenomenon was noted: the performance of gel electrolytes usually decreases when the amount of gelators is increased, but when 1,2,4,5-tetra(bromomethyl)benzene provides the three-dimensional ionomer gel, the photocurrent density increases from 6 mA/cm2 to 10 mA/cm2 (at 100 mW/cm2) when the amount of the gelator is increased from 1.5% to 4.5%. This observation was explained by a decrease of interfacial resistance between the gel and the electrodes.31

Gelation processes in IL electrolytes. 
An amphiphilic organogelator (Fig. 10) was used in low concentrations (2%) in order to solidify electrolytes based on PMImI and EMImSCN ionic liquids.35 The sol–gel transition temperature was 108 °C. The diffusion coefficient of I3− in the IL electrolyte PMImI/EMImSCN and the corresponding gelled electrolyte was found to be 3.95 × 10−7 cm2/s and 3.59 × 10−7 cm2/s, respectively. DSSCs containing gel electrolytes in combination with the K-19 dye (Fig. 6) showed an efficiency of 6.3% at full sunlight irradiation. Long-term stability experiments (light soaking accelerated stress at 60 °C for 1000 h) showed promising results.35
 Fig. 10  Amphiphilic organogelator used in ref. 35. 

Polymer electrolytes based on HMImI and crosslinked gelation agents have been prepared and used for quasi-solid DSSCs.36 The polymer electrolytes contained iodine, NMBI, LiI and two constituents in HMImI. The first constituent is a polypyridyl-pendant poly(amidoamine) dendritic derivative (PPDD), shown in Fig. 11. The second constituent is a multifunctional halogen derivative, such as 1,4-dibromobutane or PEO with iodine atoms on the chain ends. It was shown that PPDDs may be used for solidification of ionic liquid electrolytes by in situpolymerization.
 Fig. 11  
Gelation agents used in ref. 36, 
As sensitizer, the ruthenium-based dye N-3 was used. The efficiencies of the cells were in the interval 2.7–3.0% at 100 mW/cm2. Gel electrolytes may retain over 90% of the ionic liquid electrolyte performance.36
An ionic polymer electrolyte was prepared by in situ thermal polymerization of (hexa)(oxyethylene)methacrylate dissolved in HMImI.58 Quasi-solid state DSSCs based on this electrolyte and the ruthenium dyeTBA N-3 were made without any sealing. The performance of the cells was 3.8% at 1 sun illumination. A reference organic liquid electrolyte, based on methoxyacetonitrile, showed 6.5% efficiency. The long-term stability, however, is much better for the polymer electrolyte: cells, which retained 90% of the initial efficiency after 80 days at room temperature.58

        Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) has been used as polymer matrix for polymer electrolytes.37 Thus, polymers PEO : KI : I2 were doped with the EMImSCN ionic liquid. Solar cells prepared with the polymer electrolytes and the ruthenium-based sensitizer N-3 show efficiencies up to 0.6% at 100 mW/cm2 irradiation.37,38
A polymer material based on PEO and imidazolium chloride, 1-oligo(ethylene oxide)-3-methylimidazolium chloride (Fig. 12) has also been used as a matrix for electrolytes for DSSCs. The influence of PEO molecular weight and imidazolium group of the ionic liquid on the different characteristics of the electrolyte (ionic conductivity, diffusion coefficients of the redox species) as well as over-all performance of the solar cells were investigated.39 In combination with the sensitizer N-3, a maximum performance of 3.1% was reached at 100 mW/cm2 irradiation by using electrolyte with PEO(750)MImCl. It is important to note that the polymeric electrolyte based on PEO(750) showed a much lower efficiency of 1.9% than that of the imidazolium-based electrolyte PEO(750)MImCl.

Quasi-solid electrolytes based on 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium dihydrogenphosphate (PMImDP), iodide-triiodide ILs and α-zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP) have been described (Fig. 13).40 In combination with the ruthenium-based sensitizer N-719, the photoenergy conversion efficiency of the cells containing 6% α-ZrP increases by a factor of >2 to 2.61%, as compared to DSSCs without α-ZrP. This difference is explained by interaction between the additive tert-butylpyridine and α-ZrP leading to an enhancement of the diffusion coefficient of I3− and, as a consequence, photocurrent. The highest diffusion coefficient of I3− (2.89 × 10−7 cm2/s) and photocurrent density (1.02 mA/cm2) are reached at an optimal concentration of α-ZrP (6%).40
 Fig. 13  Quasi-solid electrolytes composed of ionic liquids and α-ZrP in ref. 40. 
Grätzel et al. reported the preparation of an ionic liquid polymer gel composed of PMImI and poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP).41 It was employed as quasi-solid-state electrolyte in solar cells in combination with the Z-907 dye showing an over-all conversion efficiency of 5.3% at 100 mW/cm2 illumination.41 The calculated diffusion coefficient of I3− was 1.9 × 10−7 cm2/s.
Similar electrolytes based on 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide and PVDF-HFP (5 wt%) (Fig. 14) show an overall conversion efficiency of 6.1% at 100 mW/cm2 illumination in conjunction with the Z-907 dye.42 The authors note that the I−/I3−redox couple can diffuse freely in the liquid domains surrounded by the three-dimensional network of the PVDF-HFP (the diffusion coefficient of I3− was 3.6 × 10−6 cm2/s). It should be noted that these DSSCs show very high long-term stability under thermal stress and light soaking.42
 Fig. 14  Composition of the gel electrolyte used in ref. 42. 

        Imidazolium ionic liquids and fumed silica nanoparticles were used for the preparation of quasi-solid state electrolytes.43,44 Thus, gel electrolytes, based on PMImI and SiO2nanoparticles (12 nm particle size, 5 wt%) were prepared by sonication of an SiO2-PMImI mixture. The calculated diffusion coefficient of I3− was 1.9 × 10−7 cm2/s. DSSCs with the Z-907 dye and gel electrolyte show a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency up to 6.1% at 1 sun irradiation.43
A similar approach to solidify IL electrolytes was published by Zhao et al.: fumed silica nanoparticles (5 wt%, 10 nm particle size) were mixed under sonication with the IL electrolyte (PMImI/3-methoxypropionitrile mixture, 13 : 7 by volume) to produce a stable quasi-solid state electrolyte.44 DSSCs based on this electrolyte and the N-3 dye show an overall conversion efficiency of 5.3% at 100 mW/cm2 illumination.
TiO2-based, dye-sensitized, quasi-solid-state solar cells have been constructed by employing a nanocomposite organic/inorganic gel electrolyte made by the sol–gel method. The nanocomposite gel is based on the product of solvolysis of tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), while its organic subphase is a mixture of a surfactant (Triton X-100), propylene carbonate, iodine, and PMImI (Fig. 15). Improved results were obtained by adding NMBI. The dye N-3 was used in combination with the gel electrolytes. A maximum efficiency of 5.4% was achieved at 96 mW/cm2 illumination.45
 Fig. 15  Composition of the organic/inorganic gel electrolyte in ref. 45. 
Fumed silica nanoparticles (9 wt%) were used to solidify an electrolyte based on imidazolium or potassium iodides, iodine and poly(ethylene oxide dimethyl ether) (PEODME, Mw = 500 g/mol).46 Amorphous silica nanoparticles with a surface area of 255 m2/g were introduced into the system in order to create a three-dimensional network. In combination with the N-3 sensitizer an efficiency of 4.5% at 100 mW/cm2 was achieved.

Dye-sensitized solar cells using ionic liquids, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (alkyl: C3–C9), were fabricated with and without a low molecular weight gelator (Fig. 16).47,48

Gelator and IL-composed gel electrolyte used in refs. 47 and 48. 
An energy conversion efficiency of 5.0% was obtained from a quasi-solid-state DSSC using HMImI. The gelation of these ILs demonstrated a better high-temperature durability without decreasing the solar cell efficiency. The short-circuit currents (JSC) obtained from these DSSCs were about 70% of that obtained from DSSCs using an organic liquid electrolyte. Viscosities of the IL electrolytes decreased with increasing I3− concentration and alkyl chain length. The JSC values measured increased with increasing I3− concentration up to 0.7–1.4 M, depending on the alkyl chain length. The JSC values measured showed the same tendency as estimates from a model in which the redox couple is transported by diffusion in the electrolytes. These results suggest that the slower diffusion of I3− to the counter electrode limits the JSC values and that a larger amount of I3− would be required to maintain efficiency. However, increasing the concentration of I3− to more than 0.7–1.4 M resulted in a decrease in JSC. At the optimized concentration of I3−, the influence of the light absorption of I3− was estimated to cause 13% of the decrease in photocurrent. In order to the estimate the electron diffusion length in the TiO2electrode, the electron diffusion coefficient (D) and electron recombination lifetime τ were determined, showing a faster D and a shorter τ in the IL electrolyte than in an organic electrolyte (OE). The higher D was caused by the higher concentration of cation in the IL electrolyte. However, the lower τ was caused by the higher concentration of I3− and showed a dependence on concentration. Thus, the electron diffusion lengths (L) in the DSSC using the IL electrolyte were shorter than that using the OE. The shorter L also reduced the JSC of the IL electrolyte just as an increase in I3− concentration. In addition, an increase of alkyl chain length increased τ. This result explains the highest efficiency observed in HMImI. During the durability test of the DSSC at high temperature, a decrease of the efficiency of the cell using IL electrolyte was observed in 1000 h. The change of I3− concentration with time revealed that the gelation of the electrolyte depresses a decrease of I3− concentration caused by sublimation of I2. The authors note that a depression of the sublimation of I2 is an important factor to improve the high-temperature durability in non-volatile ionic liquid electrolytes.47,48
Supramolecular electrolytes based on PMImI, I2 and poly(ethylene glycol) with hydrogen bonding (PHB) (Fig. 17) have been described.49 Efficiencies up to 3.3% were achieved by using these electrolytes in combination with a N-719 ruthenium dye.
 Fig. 17  Component of supramolecular electrolytes used in ref. 49. 
Highly efficient, all-solid-state solar cells, containing electrolytes with succinonitrile as solid solvent and N-methyl-N-butyl-pyrrolidinium iodide/triiodide as redox mediator have been fabricated.50 The diffusion coefficient of I3− was relatively high (2.2 × 10−6 cm2/s). An efficiency up to 6.7% at 51.9 mW/cm2 was reported (the ruthenium-based dye N-719 was used); at full sun irradiation the efficiency decreases to 5%, probably due to the inefficient charge screening of electron transport in the nanocrystalline film.50
A new approach to the preparation of quasi-solid DSSCs was proposed by Kato et al.51 TiO2nanoparticles were modified with imidazolium salts (Fig. 18). The main difference between the previously described gel electrolytes and this system is that the imidazolium cations are bound to TiO2nanoparticlesvia Ti–O–CO bonds. The length of the alkyl chains plays an important role in such gel-like electrolytes. In combination with the N-3 dye, an efficiency up to 5% at 1 sun irradiation was achieved.51
 Fig. 18  TiO2nanoparticles modified with imidazolium salts used in ref. 51. 
Ionic gels have also been prepared from agarose (Fig. 19), natural polysaccharide, and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium salts.52 The gels showed sufficient mechanical strength even though a very small amount of agarose was added (1.0–1.5 wt%). The photon to electron conversion efficiency of the DSSCs containing ionic gel electrolyte was 2.93% at a light intensity of 100 mW/cm2. The efficiency of the cells with a gel electrolyte is just slightly lower than that of the corresponding liquid electrolyte based on an PMImI ionic liquid.52
 Fig. 19  Structure of agarose. 
Quasi-solid electrolytes based on the EMImI ionic liquid and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) were successfully used in combination with the ruthenium-based N-3 dye as sensitizer and titanium phthalocyanine (TiOPc) as co-adsorbent (Fig. 20).53 An impressive efficiency of 7.13% was achieved (Jsc = 20.0 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.69 V, FF = 0.52). The DSSC device using TiOPc displays a higher power conversion efficiency than those without TiOPc, most likely because of a decrease in electron transfer distance at the interface adsorption between the TiO2 film and the polymer electrolyte.
 Fig. 20  Structure of the titanium phthalocyanine complex used in ref. 53. 

Trimethoxysilane derivatives of PMImI (TMS-PMImI) have been synthesized (Fig. 21).54 Mixed with iodine, it was used as a gel electrolyte in DSSCs through sol–gel condensation offering in practice solid-state devices with overall efficiencies of 3.2%. The specific conductivity of the gel electrolyte was increased by the addition of iodine and also by an increase in temperature. Variations to the cell performance were also examined by the addition of organic and inorganic acids to the electrolyte.54
 Fig. 21  
Trimethoxysilane IL used in the gel electrolyte of ref. 54. 
Different nanocomposites have been prepared on the basis of imidazolium ILs. An organic–inorganic material (Fig. 22) was synthesized by the sol–gel route using TMS-PMImI as precursor.55,56 Overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency up to 3.1% was achieved using this material in combination with the ruthenium-based dye N-3.
 Fig. 22  Nanocomposite used in the refs. 55 and 56. 
Plastic and solid-state DSSCs based on carbon nanotubes and imidazolium ILs were recently fabricated.57 The highest conversion efficiency recorded was 2.3% under a simulated sunlight intensity of 23 mW/cm2.
Nanocomposite gel electrolytes were prepared by dispersion of different inorganic materials, such as carbon nanotubes, other carbon nanoparticles or titanium dioxide nanoparticles, into EMImTFSI.59 In all cases, the performance of the DSSCs based on such nanocomposite gel electrolytes was higher (up to 5% at 100 mW/cm2) than that of cells based on a pure ionic liquid electrolyte (4.2% at 100 mW/cm2), despite lower viscosity of the latter electrolyte systems. It was shown by impedance measurements that the resistance of non-doped ionic liquid electrolytes is higher than that of the ionic nanocomposite gel electrolytes.59
Concluding remarks and future prospects
The unique properties of ionic liquids embracing negligible volatility, very high thermo- and electrochemical stability, the ability to dissolve a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds attract much attention of research groups working in the dye-sensitized solar cell field. Ionic liquids may be denoted “tunable” solvents – their physico-chemical properties can be varied by modification the anionic and/or cationic components. Relatively low viscosity and hydrophobicity, desirable for solar cell applications, may be achieved using this approach. It has been shown that ionic liquids are not only perfect solvents for liquid electrolytes in DSSCs, but also irreplaceable components of gel-like or quasi-solid electrolytes.
When reading the summary of DSSC performance in this review, a mild warning is at place. More specifically, the absolute efficiency values given in Tables 1 and 2 should be taken with some reservation. By optimization of the conditions of efficiency determination, the values can be increased by at least 1–2%. Factors, such as solar cell area, quality of glass and type of conducting glass as well as counter electrodes and light filtering and masking are all important. Since it is normally not known to which degree such optimizations have been made, differences of a few percent in reported efficiencies may be insignificant in the sense that they do not communicate any information regarding the inherent properties of the components used or tested.
The long-term instability of DSSCs remains one of the most important factors limiting their industrialization. In general, one can see two reasons for long-term instability of DSSCs: (a) poor encapsulation of the cell leading to the evaporation of the electrolyte, and (b) chemical processes taking place in the electrolyte or at the solid/liquid interfaces leading to a degradation of the dye, components of the electrolyte or surface of the counter electrode. The use of ionic liquid exclude the first problem, whereas the nature of undesired chemical processes depends on the specific total system employed.
Here, we also see the future developments of electrolytes in general, and ionic liquids in particular, for the use in DSSCs. It is notable that the DSSCs studied so far essentially as the same as those optimised for use with a volatile organic solvent as the base ingredient for the electrolytes. The replacement of the organic solvent for electrolytes based on ionic liquids might be regarded as an ad hoc modification. Very little effort has been devoted to the optimisation of the electrode materials or sensitizing dye to this new class of electrolytes. Therefore, the initial studies that constitute the major part of this review are mainly devoted to the fundamental properties of ionic liquids; a first generation of investigations.
The future, later generation studies, will have to address the specific interactions between the ionic-liquid electrolytes and the working as well as counter electrodes. Such investigations are likely to not only include additives or dopants to the electrolytes, but also a search for completely new and adapted dyes, redox agents as well as electrode materials in order to fully exploit the potentials of the ionic liquid electrolytes and their derivatives.

Mikhail Gorlov	Mikhail Gorlov was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and received his PhD in Chemistry from the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology in 2002. He was a postdoctoral fellow (2003–2004) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, and he is currently a researcher at the Inorganic Chemistry Department, KTH. His research interest focuses on the syntheses of new ionic liquids and their application as electrolyte media for dye-sensitized solar cells.
Lars Kloo	Lars Kloo received his PhD in Inorganic Chemistry at Lund University, Sweden, in 1990, and moved to his current position as Professor in Inorganic Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm in 1998. During 1991–95 he was, for shorter or longer periods, a visiting scientist in other laboratories in the UK, USA and New Zealand. His interest in ionic liquids dates back to the end of the 1980s, when he started to use such media both as electrolytes and for inorganic synthesis of new organometallic and inorganic compounds and materials.
