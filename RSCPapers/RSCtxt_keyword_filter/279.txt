    , Accepted 4th April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractTo achieve efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs), it is important to increase the optical absorption coefficient and charge mobility of photovoltaic materials for obtaining a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in the devices without sacrificing the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel narrow bandgap n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors named POIT-M and MOIT-M by modifying the side-chains of IT-M from para-hexylphenyl to para-hexyloxylphenyl and then to meta-hexyloxylphenyl. Due to the synergistic effects of introducing oxygen atoms and varying substitution positions on the phenyl side-chains, MOIT-M shows a significantly improved absorption coefficient, stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction, increased crystallinity and higher electron mobility in comparison with IT-M and POIT-M, which helps to gain higher Jsc and FF in PSCs. These special features combined with the complementary absorption of the MOIT-M acceptor and wide bandgap polymer PTZ1 donor resulted in a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.6% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8% for the PSCs processed with simple thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for additive-free PSCs and significantly higher than those of the PSCs based on PTZ1:IT-M (9.1%) or PTZ1:POIT-M (9.7%). Our results indicate that side-chain engineering is an effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of n-OS acceptors in PSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the electron acceptor, such as small molecules (SMs)1–7 or polymers,8–14 have emerged as a hot-topic of attention. Compared to conventional fullerene acceptors, n-OS acceptors have unique advantages, such as highly tunable frontier energy levels, optical absorption and crystallinity, large raw material selections and low cost production.1–14 So far, by fine chemical modification and reasonable matching of high-performance acceptor and donor materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been promoted to 10–13% in PSCs.15–23 Among the n-OS acceptors, an acceptor–donor–acceptor structured acceptor named ITIC with a narrow bandgap (NBG)1a has become one of the representative acceptors in highly efficient PSCs. When ITIC was blended with wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors, the blend films showed a wide and complementary light absorption range of ca. 300–780 nm, and thus high PCEs of 10–11% with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) were obtained in PSCs.17,24,25 To further promote the device efficiency, Hou et al. elevated the LUMO level of ITIC by introducing a methyl substituent at the end-groups.26 As a result, in comparison with ITIC, the PSCs based on IT-M with one methyl substituted end-group (see Fig. 1a) show an increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.90 to 0.94 V and an improved PCE from 11.22% to 12.05%. However, the introduction of methyl at the end-groups will weaken the intramolecular D–A electron push–pull effect. As a result, IT-M shows a blue-shifted absorption spectrum in comparison with ITIC. Moreover, it is difficult to further improve the PCEs of the IT-M-based PSCs due to the restricted absorption coefficients and electron mobility of IT-M.

It is well known that the design of high efficiency active materials should consider the complicated and confusing relationship between the various properties of active materials and their photovoltaic performance. As a convenient and effective molecular modification strategy, side-chain engineering has been extensively explored to tune the physical properties of conjugated polymers.27–32 Especially, attaching alkoxyl side chains can not only improve the molecular energy levels but also enhance the intramolecular interaction, crystallinity and charge mobility of the polymers.33–37 For example, a polymer named PMOT5 was reported by introducing 4-methoxythienyl onto a benzodithiophene (BDT) unit and showed a higher absorption coefficient, intermolecular π–π stacking interactions and charge mobility in comparison with the thienyl control polymer PBDTBDD.33 As a result, the PMOT5-based PSCs showed a higher PCE of 9.25% in comparison with the PBDTBDD-based PSCs (6.77%).33 Recently, a polymer PBDTEDOT-FBT by introducing 3,4-ethylenedioxythienyl (EDOT) onto a BDT unit was also developed and showed satisfied absorption and higher crystallinity in comparison with its counterpart without an EDOT substitution, and eventually achieved a high PCE of 10.11%.37 However, as a simple and effective molecular modification strategy, alkoxy side-chain engineering focuses on polymer donors, but is seldom used in n-OS acceptors.
Moreover, changing the alkyl substituent position has also been widely used to optimize the performance of organic photovoltaic materials, which is attributed to its multiple synergistic effects on the molecular solubility and photoelectric properties, and even the active layer morphology.27–29 For example, Yang et al. reported an efficient n-OS acceptor m-ITIC by replacing para-alkyl in phenyl of ITIC with meta-alkyl.32 Compared to ITIC, m-ITIC showed a higher absorption coefficient in films, stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interactions, increased crystallinity and higher electron mobility. And the m-ITIC-based PSCs gained a significantly improved PCE of 11.77% compared to its counterpart ITIC (10.57%).
Herein, we systematically studied the synergistic effect of the introduction of oxygen atoms and the change of the substituent position of alkoxy side-chains on the performances of n-OS acceptors. As shown in Fig. 1a, two novel n-OS acceptors named POIT-M and MOIT-M were synthesized by using side-chain engineering of IT-M from para-hexylphenyl to para-hexyloxylphenyl and then to meta-hexyloxylphenyl. The synthetic routes of POIT-M and MOIT-M are displayed in Fig. 1c, and the detailed synthesis processes are recorded in the Experimental section. Compared to IT-M, POIT-M with substituents containing hetero-atomic oxygen shows a slightly improved absorption coefficient, crystallinity and electron mobility, and slightly lower energy levels. Due to the synergistic effects of varying substitution positions and introducing oxygen atoms onto the phenyl side-chains, MOIT-M with meta-hexyloxylphenyl substituents shows an obviously increased absorption coefficient, intermolecular π–π stacking, crystallinity, and electron mobility, and slightly deeper energy levels compared to IT-M and POIT-M, which helps to gain higher Jsc and fill factor (FF) in devices. The photovoltaic performance of MOIT-M combined with our recently developed WBG polymer PTZ1 (ref. 38) (see Fig. 1b) as a donor achieved a PCE of up to 11.6%, which is among the highest PCEs reported for additive-free PSCs and significantly higher than that of the PSCs based on IT-M (9.1%) or POIT-M (9.7%) as an acceptor.
2. Results and discussion
In both solutions and thin films, IT-M, POIT-M and MOIT-M show almost the same absorption profile with red-shifted and broadened film absorption, as shown in Fig. 2a. In films, the three n-OS acceptors have an absorption onset at ca. 775 nm, corresponding to a small optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.60 eV, which is complementary to that of the WBG polymer PTZ1 film from ca. 400 to 775 nm. Notably, as shown in Fig. 2b, compared to the IT-M film (1.38 × 105 cm−1), the POIT-M film displays a slightly improved maximum absorption coefficient (1.48 × 105 cm−1) at ca. 695 nm, while the MOIT-M film shows a significantly enhanced maximum absorption coefficient (1.88 × 105 cm−1), which means that the meta-hexyloxyl side-chain modified MOIT-M has strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions and crystallinity.32 When PTZ1 and MOIT-M are mixed as the active layer for PSCs, the higher absorption coefficient is beneficial to capture more solar photons, and ultimately an increased Jsc and PCE values can be gained.

The molecular energy levels of the three n-OS acceptors were measured by electro-chemical cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), and the corresponding schematic diagrams are plotted in Fig. 2c. It is found that the energy levels of the acceptors can be reduced by introducing oxygen atoms and changing the substituent position of the side-chains. Compared to the PTZ1:IT-M pair with the HOMO/LUMO offsets of 0.27/0.52 eV, the HOMO/LUMO offsets of the PTZ1:MOIT-M pair are increased to 0.30/0.55 eV, which provides a greater driving force for efficient charge separation at the D/A interface and thus helps to improve the Jsc value of devices.
The optimal molecular geometries of the three n-OS acceptors were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and showed nearly planar molecular backbone configurations in the side view images (Fig. 2d). Notably, for the top view, compared to IT-M with irregularly stretched hexylphenyl substituents, POIT-M and MOIT-M with oxygen atoms introduced into the substituents show a more regular hexyloxylphenyl orientation. Moreover, compared to POIT-M with an outward extension of the side chain orientation, the meta-hexyloxyl modified MOIT-M shows inward constriction of the side chain orientation, which will facilitate the intermolecular π–π stacking interactions and crystallinity of MOIT-M so as to increase the absorption coefficient and electron mobility.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)15,21 was performed to probe the influence of alkoxy side-chain engineering on the π–π stacking interaction and crystallinity of the three n-OS acceptors (see Fig. 3). In the in-plane (IP) direction, compared to IT-M with a broad (100) diffraction peak at 0.335 Å−1 and a lamellar distance of 18.73 Å, POIT-M and MOIT-M show a stronger and tighter (100) diffraction peak at 0.337 and 0.339 Å−1 and a smaller lamellar distance of 18.59 and 18.50 Å, respectively. Moreover, in the IP direction, MOIT-M shows a larger crystal coherence length (CCL) of 6.06 nm compared to POIT-M with a CCL of 5.01 nm. In the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, compared to IT-M and POIT-M, MOIT-M shows a significantly stronger (010) diffraction peak, which indicates a stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction. The above results show that MOIT-M has a stronger intermolecular interaction, higher crystallinity and more ordered molecular orientation compared to IT-M and POIT-M, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption coefficient and molecular geometries from DFT calculations. In addition, using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method,24,30 it was found that the meta-hexyloxyl modified MOIT-M possesses a higher electron mobility (μe) of 8.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than its counterparts IT-M (3.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and POIT-M (6.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (see Fig. S2a in the ESI†).

PSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated to probe the influence of alkoxy side-chain engineering of the acceptors on the photovoltaic performance. The optimized active layers were obtained from the blend solution of 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (CB) with a D:A weight ratio of 1:1, and then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 4a, and the detailed photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. Because the three n-OS acceptors have similar LUMO levels, these PSCs show an almost constant Voc of 0.96–0.98 V. Compared to the PTZ1:IT-M-based control devices, the PTZ1:POIT-M-based PSCs exhibited a slightly enhanced Jsc from 14.9 to 15.4 mA cm−2 and FF from 62.2% to 65.1%, which is attributed to the slightly increased absorption coefficient and more regular orientation of POIT-M in comparison with IT-M. Due to the obviously improved absorption coefficient, regular and inward constriction of the side-chain orientation, stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction and increased crystallinity of MOIT-M compared to POIT-M, the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs exhibited a significantly increased Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.8% compared to the PTZ1:POIT-M-based PSCs. As a result, the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs show a PCE of up to 11.6%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for additive-free PSCs and is significantly higher than those of the PSCs based on IT-M (9.1%) or POIT-M (9.7%) as an acceptor. High Voc is beneficial to the devices to obtain a low energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc).39 Here, these PSCs show a similar Eloss of 0.62–0.64 eV because the Voc did not change much, which is very close to the empirical limit value of 0.60 eV. The above results indicate that the meta-hexyloxyl side-chain engineering of the n-OS acceptors can significantly improve the Jsc and FF values of the PSCs without sacrificing the Voc by the reasonable molecular design. Moreover, PSCs with Ca as a buffer layer were fabricated. As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI,† the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs show a PCE of 9.5%, which is also higher than those of the PSCs based on IT-M (8.3%) or POIT-M (8.7%) as an acceptor. Furthermore, PSCs based on PBDB-T as a donor were also fabricated. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2 in the ESI,† the PBDB-T:MOIT-M-based PSCs show a PCE of 10.7%, which is also higher than those of the PSCs based on IT-M (9.7%) or POIT-M (10.0%) as an acceptor.

To confirm the Jsc values of the PSCs, external quantum efficiency (EQE) tests were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4b, the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs show a higher photon response in the whole wavelength range compared to the PSCs based on PTZ1:IT-M and PTZ1:POIT-M, especially in ca. 600–730 nm that belongs to n-OS acceptors, which is consistent with the UV-vis tests (see Fig. 2b). Notably, the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSC also shows a significantly higher maximum EQE value of 78% at ca. 610 nm in comparison with the PSCs based on PTZ1:POIT-M (69% at 611 nm) and PTZ1:IT-M (69% at 600 nm). The integrated Jsc values were 14.2, 14.7 and 16.6 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on PTZ1:IT-M, PTZ1:POIT-M and PTZ1:MOIT-M respectively, which are in good agreement with the J–V tests within a 5% mismatch. The higher FF of 68.8% for the PSCs based on PTZ1:MOIT-M is partly attributed to the high and balanced charge mobilities. As shown in Fig. S2b and c in the ESI,† the μh/μe values of the PTZ1:IT-M, PTZ1:POIT-M and PTZ1:MOIT-M blend films were estimated to be 1.28 × 10−3/2.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.79 × 10−3/3.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.84 × 10−3/5.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 by using the SCLC method, respectively. The higher and more balanced μh/μe values in the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend films are beneficial to reduce space charge accumulation and thus improve charge extraction. Notably, in comparison with the PTZ1:IT-M and PTZ1:POIT-M blend films, the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film displays a stronger and tighter (010) peak in the OOP direction of the GIWAXS 2D-profiles (see Fig. 3c), and also shows a stronger and sharper (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction of the line-cuts (see Fig. 3d), which indicates that the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film still possesses stronger intermolecular π–π interactions and higher crystallinity, and thus improves charge mobilities.
The charge generation and dissociation processes of devices are studied by plotting the curves of photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the PSCs.40 The calculation methods and parameter definitions are described in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 4c, under the maximum power output and short-circuit conditions, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were calculated to be 74.8/87.5%, 87.8/92.7% and 91.5/94.6% for the PSCs based on PTZ1:IT-M, PTZ1:POIT-M and PTZ1:MOIT-M respectively, implying that the device with MOIT-M as an acceptor has more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes. The relationship of Jph with light intensity (P) was defined as Jph ∝ PS,41 and plotted to further study the charge recombination process in PSCs (see Fig. 4d). S values of the fitted lines in logarithmic coordinates close to 1 imply that the device has weak bimolecular recombination. The PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs show an S value closer to 1 (0.992) compared to the PSCs based on PTZ1:IT-M (0.983) and PTZ1:POIT-M (0.989), suggesting that the PSCs with MOIT-M as an acceptor has less bimolecular recombination. Notably, the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film also showed higher photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency compared to the PTZ1:IT-M and PTZ1:POIT-M blend films (see Fig. 5), regardless of the excitation wavelength of the n-OS acceptors or polymer donor, indicating that the PSCs with MOIT-M as an acceptor has more efficient photo-induced exciton dissociation and charge transport behavior.

The surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films were also probed. In the height images of atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see Fig. 6a–c), the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film displays a smoother surface with a smaller roughness value of 0.864 nm compared to the PTZ1:IT-M (0.938 nm) and PTZ1:POIT-M (1.01 nm) blend films. Moreover, in the phase images of AFM (see Fig. 6d–f), in comparison with the PTZ1:IT-M and PTZ1:POIT-M blend films, the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film shows a well-developed fibrillar structure with a suitable fiber size. In the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (see Fig. 6g–i), the PTZ1:MOIT-M blend film also shows obvious phase separation with a suitable fiber size, which is well consistent with the AFM test results and is favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation in PSCs and thus improves PCE values.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, two novel n-OS small molecule acceptors named POIT-M and MOIT-M were designed and synthesized by using side-chain engineering of IT-M from para-hexylphenyl to para-hexyloxylphenyl and then to meta-hexyloxylphenyl. Due to the synergistic effects of inserting oxygen atoms and varying the substitution position on the phenyl side-chains, MOIT-M shows a higher absorption coefficient, stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction, increased crystallinity and improved electron mobility in comparison with its counterparts IT-M and POIT-M, which helps to gain higher Jsc and FF in PSCs. As a result, the PTZ1:MOIT-M-based PSCs show a PCE of up to 11.6% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for additive-free PSCs and significantly higher than those of the PSCs based on IT-M (9.1%) or POIT-M (9.7%) as an acceptor. The results indicate that side chain engineering is an effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of n-OS acceptors in PSCs.

POIT-CHO

Compound POIT (1.50 g, 1.38 mmol) and 50 mL dry THF were mixed at −78 °C under argon protection, and 1.73 mL of n-butyllithium (4.15 mmol, 2.4 M in hexane) was slowly added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then stirred at −78 °C for 1 h and at RT for 1 h. Subsequently, N,N-dimethylformamide (0.35 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at RT. Then, the mixture was extracted with CHCl3, and the combined organic phase was washed with brine three times. The resulting crude compound was purified by using silica gel to give a yellow solid (1.07 g, 68%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), (ppm): 9.88 (s, 2H), 7.94 (s, 2H), 7.16 (s, 2H), 7.09 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 8H), 6.82 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 8H), 3.90 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 8H), 1.75–1.63 (m, 8H), 1.37 (dd, J = 18.9, 12.7 Hz, 8H), 1.29–1.25 (m, 16H), 0.88 (t, J = 6.2 Hz, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), (ppm): 182.79, 158.56, 154.98, 149.24, 146.99, 144.40, 141.80, 140.03, 136.35, 133.71, 129.84, 129.00, 117.80, 114.58, 67.96, 62.37, 31.55, 29.22, 25.73, 22.59, 14.02.
