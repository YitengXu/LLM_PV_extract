    , Accepted 23rd January 2018First published on 23rd January 2018AbstractWe have synthesized a novel kind of fused pentacyclic small molecule acceptor (IDIDT-C8) with cis-arranged alkyl side chains for the first time. Specifically, four aliphatic groups were introduced on one side of the diindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene unit to construct the molecular backbone with cis-arranged side chains. Such cis-arranged alkyl side chains can play a significant role in adjusting the crystallinity and molecular packing styles. Therefore, the formation of large molecular aggregations can be suppressed in the photoactive layer. Accordingly, polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with polymer PBDB-T as a donor and IDIDT-C8 as an acceptor show a maximum power conversion efficiency of 10.10% with an FF of 65.9%, a Jsc of 15.81 mA cm−2, and a high Voc of 0.97 V, which are among the highest values for single-junction PSCs with fused five-ring electron acceptors up to now.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with advantages of low cost, light weight and flexibility are a cost-effective alternative for utilizing solar energy.1–5 In the past few decades, great effort has been made to develop polymer donors for fullerene acceptor based PSCs, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% has been achieved.6–11 The weak absorption of fullerene derivatives in the visible region caused a limitation for further improving the PCE of PSCs. In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors, especially fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs), have attracted great attention in recent years due to their merits of tunable energy levels, controllable absorption characteristics and facile purification.12–18 FREAs with a hexacyclic, heptacyclic, or nonacyclic core (e.g. thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–thiophene (4T), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene) (IBDT), and fluorenedicyclopentathiophene (FT)) have exhibited excellent performance, and their highest PCEs are 10.43%, 13.1%, and 11.2% respectively.19–21 However, the synthesis of large fused ring acceptors is usually complicated. For practical applications, it is highly required to develop high efficiency and easily synthesized electron acceptors with fewer fused rings. Unfortunately, the reported FREAs based on a fewer fused ring core such as tricyclic and pentacyclic units with a PCE over 10% in single-junction PSCs are currently very few.22–25 Recently, it was found that the position of alkyl chains could influence the molecular packing, microstructure and charge mobility of organic semiconductors.26,27 Single crystal structures of compounds with an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) central core carrying trans-arranged alkylphenyl side chains revealed that such molecules are packed in a slipped stacking arrangement through edge-to-edge overlap of the terminal thiophene rings with a plane-to-plane distance of about 3.50 Å, whereas compounds based on a diindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene (DIDT) unit carrying cis-arranged alkylphenyl side chains showed only partial overlap of terminal phenyl rings in an anti-parallel manner with a plane-to-plane distance of about 3.52 Å, revealing that the π–π interaction is weaker in a cis-arranged configuration than that in a trans-arranged one.27 Considering that substitution at different sides of the molecular backbone (cis- or trans-substitution) may influence the crystallinity and aggregation of FREAs, which could play an important role in the photovoltaic properties of FREAs, here cis-arranged alkyl side chains were introduced for the first time onto the core unit when designing FREAs. We thus designed and synthesized a new small molecule acceptor (IDIDT-C8) with cis-arranged alkyl chains to adjust the molecular packing, tune film the morphology, and improve the device performance. Specifically, four aliphatic side chains are introduced onto the DIDT unit in a cis-arranged style and two electron-accepting 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) units are linked to the donor core through a thiophene bridge. Compared with other high-efficiency FREAs, the synthesis and purification of IDIDT-C8 are relatively simple, which is beneficial for commercialization.
Here, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) (Fig. 1) was chosen as the polymer donor to blend with IDIDT-C8 to serve as the active layer of photovoltaic devices. The PSCs with the as-cast PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 as the active layer exhibit a PCE of 7.65% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 14.65 mA cm−2, and an FF of 56.5%, which are much higher than those of the other existing PSCs with similar fused pentacyclic acceptors with trans-arranged side chains such as IEIC1 and IFTIC.28,29 Furthermore, a high PCE over 10.10% was achieved after optimization by using a solvent additive, with a higher Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 15.81 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.9%. Such a PCE value is among the highest values for single-junction PSCs with fewer-fused-ring electron acceptors up to now. These results indicate that introducing cis-arranged side chains in the planar backbone is an effective strategy for designing simple but high-performance non-fullerene acceptors with fewer fused rings.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route of IDIDT-C8 is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed procedures are provided in the ESI.† The aldehyde intermediate DIDT-C8-CHO was prepared by Suzuki coupling of DIDT-C8 and 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst precursor. The target molecule IDIDT-C8 was obtained in a yield of 65% by end-capping with INCN. IDIDT-C8 is readily soluble in common solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The chemical structure of IDIDT-C8 was verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that IDIDT-C8 has a good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss at around 331 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies revealed that IDIDT-C8 has a melting peak at 227 °C and a crystallization peak at 148 °C, indicating that IDIDT-C8 has a good crystallinity (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Photophysical properties and frontier energy levels
As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), IDIDT-C8 in chloroform solution exhibits a strong absorption band in the 500–750 nm region with a high maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 655 nm. We found that IDIDT-C8 has a slight absorption dependence on temperature. With increasing the temperature, the IDIDT-C8 solution shows a slightly blue-shifted absorption peak with a decreased intensity. The absorption spectra of PBDB-T and IDIDT-C8 as thin films are shown in Fig. 2a. IDIDT-C8 as a film exhibits a broader absorption band in the range of 500 to 800 nm with a peak at 668 nm. The absorption coefficient of IDIDT-C8 as a neat film was also measured to show a maximum value of 1.04 × 105 cm−1 at 668 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The optical bandgap of IDIDT-C8 was calculated to be 1.63 eV according to the equation: Eg,opt = 1240/λonset, indicating that IDIDT-C8 is a narrow-band-gap acceptor material. The absorption data are summarized in Table 1.

The electrochemical properties of IDIDT-C8 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S3, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated to be −5.50 and −3.86 eV for IDIDT-C8 according to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset,ox/red + 4.71 eV).30 The energy levels of PBDB-T were also measured under the same conditions to make a clear comparison. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated to be −5.23 and −3.42 eV, respectively, thus facilitating both electron transfer (from PBDB-T to IDIDT-C8) and hole transfer (from IDIDT-C8 to PBDB-T). The energy level diagrams are presented in Fig. 2b and the related data are summarized in Table 1.
The chemical geometry and frontier orbital energy levels of IDIDT-C8 were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level when replacing n-octyl with methyl for simplification (denoted as IDIDT-C1).31 The optimized geometries of the model compound in the ground state were calculated and the relaxed potential energy scans (PESs) were also performed to evaluate the conformational preference of the indanone and the thiophene segments as shown in Fig. 3a. The results indicated that the preferential configurations are structures with dihedral angles of 0° and/or 180° and there is an energy gap of about 1.39 kJ mol−1 between them. According to the calculated results, IDIDT-C1 could be locked in an energy preferred planar conformation through the noncovalent S⋯O interaction (see Fig. 3b), since it has a lower total energy.32,33 In a further step, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.40 and −3.28 eV, respectively, which are fairly close to the experimental data measured by the CV method. In this preferential configuration, the dihedral angles between the thiophene and DIDT units of IDIDT-C1 molecules are measured to be only 6.5° and 7.5°, respectively. Such a relatively planar structure is beneficial to lower the reorganization energy of molecules, which is beneficial for electron transport.32

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layers (PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8)/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and evaluated. The solvent, additives, active composition (donor:acceptor weight ratios), and spin coating rates were systematically investigated. The preparation procedure of the device and details of the optimization process are described in the ESI (Tables S1 and S2†). The photovoltaic data with/without the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) are summarized in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The optimal donor:acceptor ratio for IDIDT-C8 based devices is 1:1.5 (w/w). PSCs with the as-cast PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 as the active layer exhibited a high PCE of 7.65% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 14.65 mA cm−2, and an FF of 56.5%. After the addition of 0.7% DIO, PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 based devices showed a higher FF of 65.9%, an enhanced Jsc of 15.81 mA cm−2, an elevated Voc of 0.97 V and thus an improved PCE of 10.10%. The improved parameters after adding a small amount of DIO can be mainly attributed to the optimized morphology of the active layer, which forms a suitable nanophase separation.34,35 The maximum EQE values reached 68% for PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8. The EQE curve exhibited a strong response from 500 to 800 nm, originating from complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor materials (Fig. 2a). The calculated Jsc values are consistent with the measured Jsc ones within 5% error.

Charge mobilities
The hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 (1:1.5)/MoO3/Au (hole-only device) and Al/PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 (1:1.5)/Al (electron-only device). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the hole and electron mobilities of IDIDT-C8 based devices were calculated to be 2.03 × 10−5 and 1.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After the addition of 0.7% DIO, the optimized PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 blend film exhibited a hole mobility of 2.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The relatively balanced charge transport (μh/μe, 1.17) of the PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 blend film is beneficial to achieving higher FF and Jsc values for the devices.
Morphology characterization
The surface morphology of the PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 active layer was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the TEM images, we can see that the IDIDT-C8 based blend film exhibited a finely dispersed phase separation with thick fibrils of PBDB-T surrounded by uniformly continuous acceptors, which is different from some other FREAs with trans-arranged side chains also using DCB as the processing solvent, causing large aggregations in the active layer.32,36,37 As shown in Fig. 5, the PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 blend has a rough surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 1.61 nm. After the addition of DIO, the domain size became apparently larger with the surface roughness increased to 3.53 nm indicating slightly enhanced aggregation which would benefit the charge transport and less recombination.38,39

To understand the molecular packing styles in films, we perform grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The integrated scattered intensities and the two dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of neat PBDB-T, neat IDIDT-C8 and their blends with and without DIO are shown in Fig. 6. In the in-plane (IP) direction, PBDB-T shows pronounced laminar packing diffraction peaks with a (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1. Along with the laminar peaks, π–π stacking at 1.77 Å−1 (corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.55 Å) can be clearly seen in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The result indicates that PBDB-T is more prone to adopt a predominantly face-on crystalline orientation. It also can be seen that the acceptor IDIDT-C8, which has cis-arranged alkyl side chains, tends to form a face-on orientation relative to the substrate with a π–π stacking peak at 1.78 Å−1 (corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.53 Å). The integrated intensity of the π–π stacking (010) peak was fitted to a Gaussian profile to calculate the crystalline correlation length (CCL), a parameter related to the size of a crystallite.40 Generally, a larger OOP CCL is beneficial for charge transport characteristics and crucial for achieving higher charge mobility in PSC materials.41,42 Interestingly, we find that the CCL in the (010) direction of IDIDT-C8 is as high as 30.07 Å, implying that cis-arranged chains could result in a significantly high degree of self-organization and crystallinity.43 The blend films of PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 exhibit strong favourable “face-on” oriented molecular packing with the lamellar peak located at q ≈ 0.29 Å−1 and the π–π stacking peak located at q ≈ 1.73 Å−1. In DIO processed blends, the predominant face-on orientation remained, which is beneficial for the vertical charge transport.44,45 In addition, it is worth noting that a lamellar peak emerged at q ≈ 0.40 Å−1 in the OOP direction together with some relatively weaker peaks in the IP direction indicating that the addition of DIO induced the crystallization of the acceptor and a twinning crystal may be formed. Meanwhile, a higher CCL (30.63 Å) of the PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 blend with DIO was obtained compared to that of PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 without DIO (25.93 Å), indicating that larger crystallites were formed in the blend film spin-coated from solutions with the DIO additive, thus leading to higher charge mobilities.46,47

Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel FREA IDIDT-C8, which is composed of a central diindeno[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]thiophene core, two thiophene spacers and two INCN end groups, was facilely synthesized. For the first time, four alkyl chains were introduced at one side of the central conjugated backbone to form cis-arranged side chains to tune the solubility, molecular packing and film morphology. The formation of large molecular aggregations can be suppressed in the IDIDT-C8 based active layers as verified by the TEM measurements. When DIO was adopted as a solvent additive for depositing the photoactive layer, IDIDT-C8 exhibited a good crystallinity and tends to organize in a face-on orientation, leading to an enhanced electron mobility. After optimization, the devices based on PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 achieved a high performance of 10.10% with a high Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 15.81 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.88%. This result indicates that attaching alkyl side chains with a cis-arranged configuration is an effective way for designing high-performance fewer fused-ring acceptors.
