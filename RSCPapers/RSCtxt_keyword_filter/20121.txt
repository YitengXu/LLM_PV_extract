    , Accepted 3rd October 2005First published on 13th October 2005AbstractTiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) with large aspect ratio and large specific surface area were prepared from P25 (Nippon Aerosil) and applied to dye-sensitized titanium dioxide solar cells (DSSCs). Optimization of fabrication conditions, i.e., pH of the starting paste, sintering temperature for the TiO2 electrodes, electrolyte compositions of DSSCs gave the high conversion efficiency with improved open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) when compared to DSSCs made of P25. The evaluation of dye adsorption and the photo-injected electron transport such as electron diffusion coefficient (D) and electron lifetime (τ) in TNTs electrodes revealed that the higher efficiency resulted from increase of electron density with keeping much longer τ in TNTs electrodes than in P25 electrodes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attractive alternative for light to electricity conversion applications due to their practicable high efficiency and cost effectiveness.1–3 DSSCs were generally constructed with a dye-adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 electrode, electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples and a Pt coated counter electrode. The mesoporous TiO2 electrodes composed of particles with nano-morphology are sintered on a transparent conductive glass, leading to a huge surface area more than 1000 times larger than the projection surface.
The diffusion electron transport mechanism plays a decisive role in the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes because of absence of an electrical potential gradient in the films4–6,11 and the electron transport dynamics in the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes have been studied by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS),4–10 time-resolved photocurrent measurements,10–13 and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry.10,14,15 Several groups have reported that diffusion coefficients of electrons in the mesoporous TiO2 film are much lower than those in a bulk crystal,6,10,11,16,17 which have been explained based on the electrons diffusing models in the conduction band having charge traps.6,16,18–20 It has been roughly assumed that the trap sites could be caused by grain boundaries between nanoparticles, oxygen defects, and TiO2 amorphous layer.21,22
An electron injected from dye molecules into TiO2 nanoparticle composed of 10 μm thick mesoporous film is required to pass through more than 106 particles with grain boundaries until reaching the conductive substrate.23 In order to improve the electron transport property of mesoporous TiO2 electrodes by reducing such boundaries, use of TiO2 nanomaterials having higher aspect ratio should be preferable as electron transporting morphology. Adachi et al.24 reported that DSSCs made of the sol–gel method based TiO2 nanoparticles with netted nanowire structure can achieve high energy conversion efficiency. On the other hand, TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) reported by Kasuga25,26 have higher aspect ratio (
				ca. 12.5) and larger specific surface area (over 250 m2 g−1) than the conventional nanoparticles. However, the first application of Kasuga’s TNTs electrodes to DSSC had fell short of the expectation that effective dye-adsorption on TNTs leads to the improvement of energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs.27 In the meanwhile, our recent mechanistic studies on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes suggest that electron transport properties of TNTs electrodes should be evaluated in terms of photovoltaic characteristics of electron lifetime and their diffusion.
In this paper, the optimal conditions for the fabrication of DSSCs with keeping TNTs morphology were explored and the electron transport properties in TNTs electrodes were evaluated and improved by comparing to those of P25 electrodes. Finally, DSSCs using TNTs electrode were optimized to give the respectable energy conversion efficiency of 7.1% while DSSCs using P25 electrodes gave 6.2%.
Experimental
The electrodes made of TNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electron transport property of the TNTs electrode had been evaluated for the first time by measuring the electron diffusion coefficient (D) and the lifetime (τ) at the same time by SLIM-PCV method28 that was developed recently.
Preparation of TNTs electrodes
TNTs were synthesized according to the method reported by Kasuga et al.26 P25 TiO2 powder (Nippon Aerosil; average particle size of 21 nm in diameter) was used as a starting material. P25 (1.5 g) was added to 10 M NaOH aqueous solution (100 mL) in a 250 mL Nalgene® flask. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 110 °C for 20 h in an oil bath. Then, the obtained mixture was washed with distilled water until the conductivity of the washing solution reached less than 70 μS cm−1. Moreover, 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution (150 mL) was added to the mixture for dispersing by ultrasonication. The materials were washed repeatedly with distilled water until the conductivity of the washing solution reached less than 10 μS cm−1. Finally, the TNTs of white precipitate were separated by using a centrifuge. The formation of TNTs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi, H-9000) photographs and electron diffraction of the resultant powder. Mesoporous electrodes were fabricated by spreading a paste composed of aqueous solution containing TNTs. As for the typical preparation of the starting paste, the white TNTs precipitate was mixed with PEG (Mw: 20 000, 0.75 g), acetic acid (0.1 mL) as paste A or acetic acid (0.1 mL) and nitric acid (0.2 mL) as paste B, then dispersed by using a paint shaker (Red Devil 5400) in the presence of ZrO2 beads (3 mm), giving paste A and B that showed pH = 3 and pH = 1, respectively.
TNTs pastes were spread on a transparent conducting glass (F-doped SnO2, sheet resistance 10 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass) by doctor blade technique. Namely, both edges of the conducting glass substrate (2.5 × 7.5 cm2) were covered with one layer of adhesive tape (Scotch, 3 M) with a thickness of 40 μm. Then a drop of the paste was applied to one of the bare edges of a FTO substrate, and flattened with a glass rod by sliding over the tapes, followed by drying at room temperature. These predried electrodes were sintered at 400–550 °C for 30 min in air. After cooling to 100 °C, the resulting electrodes were immersed in an acetonitrile/2-methyl-2-propanol (1/1) solution of 50 mM cis-dithiocyanate-N,N′-bis-(4-carboxylate-4-tetrabutylammoniumcarboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II)
					(N719, Ruthenium 535 bis-TBA, Solaronix) overnight for dye adsorption. Then the electrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile and dried at room temperature.
Electrodes composed of commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Nippon Aerosil) were used for comparison. The electrodes were prepared from a colloidal suspension of P25 using the doctor blade technique.
To improve photovoltaic performance, TiCl4 treatment2 was conducted after the sintering of electrodes, i.e., an aqueous solution containing 0.05 M TiCl4 was dropped onto the TNTs or P25 electrodes, and then placed in a closed chamber with water vapor. After keeping at 70 °C for 30 min the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and sintered again at 550 °C for 30 min in air.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The dye-adsorbed mesoporous electrode faced to a platinum-sputtered conducting glass (F-doped SnO2, sheet resistance 10 Ω per square, Asahi Glass) as a counter electrode. A drop of electrolyte solution (e.g. 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in methoxyacetonitrile (MAN) referred to Electrolyte (1) was introduced into the clamped electrodes to form the solar cell. The effective area of the cell was fixed to 0.25 cm2.
For measurements of electron transport property, sealed cells were fabricated. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode were combined together and sealed by using thermal adhesive films (HIMILAN 1652, Mitsui-Dupont Polychemical, 50 μm of thickness). The electrolyte solution was injected from the hole on the counter electrode. Then the hole was sealed with HIMILAN and a cover glass (Iwaki glass).
Measurements
Crystal structures of the sintered electrodes were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with Cu Kα radiation (λ
					= 1.54 Å) using a diffractometer (Rigaku, Multiflex). The morphology of the mesoporous electrodes was characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, SM-6700F). The surface area and porosity of the films were measured using a Quantachrome, AUTOSORB-1 (the nitrogen adsorption method) after degassing at 300 °C for 1 h in a vacuum. The amount of adsorbed dye on the film was estimated by measuring light absorption at 500 nm of the dye molecule that was dissolved from the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes into 0.1 M NaOH aq. solution. Electrode thickness was determined using a surface profiler (Sloan, Dectak3). Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, Yamashita Denso, YSS-50A) at 25 °C. The solar simulator was adapted to the Japanese industrial standard for amorphous solar cells for cell efficiency determination. The solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) is defined by the following equation:η
						=
						JscVocFF/I0
						× 100where I0 is the photon flux (e.g., ca. 100 mW cm−2 for AM 1.5), Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density under irradiation, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor. Those parameters can be evaluated from photocurrent–voltage curves of the solar cells.
Electron diffusion coefficients and electron lifetimes in the TiO2 electrodes were measured by SLIM-PCV (stepped light induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage) method. The theory and the detail experimental condition of the measurements were described elsewhere.28 The transient photocurrent decay was obtained by reducing the intensity of the diode laser (Coherent, Lablaser, λ
					= 635 nm) by a step function on a function generator (Toho Technical Research, FG-02), then, recorded through a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570) on a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS3052). The transient photovoltage decay was monitored through a differential amplifier (5307, NF Electronic Instruments) on a digital oscilloscope.
In both measurements, the laser intensity was controlled by neutral density filters. All measurements were performed on at least two cells whose thickness of TiO2 film was kept in the range of 4.5 ± 0.5 μm.
Results and discussion
1. Characterization of mesoporous electrodes composed of TNTs
The white powder as prepared showed almost the same selected-area electron diffraction pattern to that previously reported as TNTs.26 The tube morphology with approximately 10 nm in diameter and several hundred nanometers in length was confirmed by TEM observation. Therefore, we concluded that the powder used in this research had enough purity as TNTs.

Fig. 1 shows low and high magnification SEM images of the electrodes made of paste A or B sintered at 500 °C. The low magnification images indicated that the surface of the electrode with paste B (Fig. 1b) was quite smooth whereas that of paste A showed many cracks (Fig. 1a). From the high magnification image, the highly dispersed TNTs in the electrode made of paste B were observed (Fig. 1d). In contrast, the electrode fabricated with paste A consisted of large aggregates of TNTs (Fig. 1(c)). The difference in morphology between two electrodes is due to dispersion conditions of the pastes. Under keeping pH ∼ 1 of the starting TNTs paste, the surface of TNTs has a more positive charge by adsorption of a proton and then the TNTs would be kept dispersed well while sintering. The morphology of the resulting TNTs electrodes affected dye adsorption on them. From the light absorption of the dye molecules dissolved from the dyed electrodes, the amounts of dye molecules on the electrodes prepared using paste A and B were estimated to be 0.87 × 10−7 mol cm−2
					μm−1 and 1.5 × 10−7 mol cm−2
					μm−1, respectively. This result indicates that the highly porous structure of TNTs electrode is preferable for deep penetration of dye molecules and their adsorption.

The surface area, the porosity and the amount of adsorbed dye molecules on the electrodes made of paste B at various sintering temperatures are shown in Table 1 together with one example of P25 electrode. As sintering temperature increased from 400 to 550 °C, the surface area remarkably decreased from 288 to 113 m2 g−1, resulting in the decrease of dye adsorption. The decrease of the surface area could be caused by neck growth23 between TNTs and by structure transformation from nanotube to nano-rod-like. The surface area, porosity and amount of adsorbed dye molecules in the TNTs electrodes were found superior to those of the P25 electrode, independent of sintering temperature.

Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the electrodes made by paste B at various sintering temperatures. All peaks from the electrodes showed good agreements with anatase phase. The electrode sintered at 400 °C had broad peaks at 25 and 48° corresponding to (101) and (200) of anatase TiO2, then the crystallinity of the anatase phase was enhanced by elevating the sintering temperature to 500 °C.

2. Photoelectrochemical characterization as dye-sensitized solar cells

2.1. Effect of morphology of TNTs film. 

Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on the electrodes fabricated using paste A or B after sintering at 500 °C and Electrolyte 1 under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The electrode constructed with paste B showed about 2 times higher Jsc value than that of paste A, giving higher conversion efficiency η. This difference of Jsc is interpreted mainly as the difference in the amount of adsorbed dye molecules on the electrodes mentioned above. Therefore, the electrodes fabricated by paste B were used for further investigation.

2.2. Effect of sintering temperature. 
The photovoltaic performance (i.e. Voc, Jsc and FF) and I–V characteristics of the DSSC based on the electrode made by paste B or P25 at various sintering temperatures under AM 1.5 irradiation are given in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Electrolyte 1 was used as an electrolyte of the cells. The Jsc values remarkably increased with increasing sintering temperature despite the decrease of the amount of adsorbed dye (Table 1). Consequently, the total conversion efficiency increased remarkably from 0.47% for 400 °C to 5.4% for 550 °C (Table 3). The improved Jsc is probably caused by enhancement of electron transport ability on the electrode due to neck growth24 between TNTs (Table 1) and the decrease of defects in the electrode (Fig. 2). The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on the electrodes sintered at temperatures more than 550 °C was almost the same as that sintered at 550 °C. Hereafter, our discussion will be based on the electrode sintered at 550 °C (denoted as a TNTs electrode). In the case of the cells based on P25 electrodes, the performance showed no significant change at sintering temperature above 450 °C. Therefore, the sintering temperature of P25 electrodes was fixed at 450 °C.

When the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was compared using either TNTs or P25 electrodes, the lower Jsc together with the higher FF of the cell with TNTs electrodes led to a nearly comparable value of the energy conversion efficiency to that of P25 electrodes. Although the amount of the adsorbed dye of the TNTs electrode was about 1.5 times larger than that of the P25 electrode (Table 1), the DSSCs based on TNTs electrodes showed lower Jsc value. This phenomenon would imply that the adsorption state of dye molecules or cations that come from the electrolyte to the surface of anatase TNTs is quite different from that of P25 nanoparticles.


2.3. Effect of Li cation concentration in electrolyte. 
The TiO2 adsorptive chemical species in electrolytes play an important role in photovoltaic performance of DSSCs as described in the literature.29–36 Those effects can be interpreted by the change of conduction band potential (CBP) of TiO231 since uniform potentials are formed inside TiO2 nanoparticles due to quantum effect. In order to improve the Jsc values of DSSCs fabricated using TNTs electrodes, the influence of the electrolyte composition had been investigated. In the case of Electrolyte 1, the adsorptive species are tBP, Li cations and DMPIm cations. Li cations adsorbed on the TiO2 surface and/or intercalated into the TiO2 shift positively the CBP of the TiO2 electrodes, resulting in enhancement of the electron injection yield from excited dye molecules to the TiO2 electrode.31 Alkylmethylimidazolium cations such as DMHIm and DMPIm cations prefer to adsorb on TiO2 surface and show the same tendency to the photovoltaic performance as Li cations.33,34 However, the effect of DMPIm cations on the CBP of TiO2 seemed to be smaller than Li cations at the same concentration.34 In contrast, tBP adsorbed on the TiO2 surface shifts the CBP of TiO2 negatively due to its basicity and improve Voc in compensation with decrease in photocurrent.35,36
Therefore, the composition of Electrolyte 1 was modified by eliminating tBP and optimizing Li cation concentration for promoting the electron injection yield from sensitizing dye molecules to TNTs electrodes. The total concentration of the iodide ion was maintained at 0.7 M by varying the ratio of DMPImI to LiI in the electrolyte.

Fig. 5 and Table 3 show the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on TNTs or P25 electrodes at various concentrations of Li cation under AM 1.5 irradiation. The DSSCs with P25 electrodes showed increase of Jsc and decrease of Voc as the concentration of Li cation increased. Consequently, increase of Li cation concentration without tBP caused lower efficiency than Electrolyte 1. These phenomena are attributed to the positive shift of CBP of P25 electrodes and are consistent with the literature mentioned above.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent–voltage curves obtained from the cells with (a) P25 and (b) TNTs electrodes at various Li+ concentrations. 
With regard to the DSSC fabricated with TNTs electrodes, the Jsc value increased remarkably with addition of a Li cation. In addition, interestingly, the Voc value was almost constant in spite of increase in Li cation concentration up to 70 mM. As a result, the energy conversion efficiency showed a maximum at 50 mM of Li cation concentration, which is much higher than the case using Electrolyte 1. The optimized composition of the electrolyte was 0.05 M LiI, 0.65 M DMPImI, and 0.05 M I2 in MAN (Electrolyte 2).
The slight decrement of Voc and dramatic increase of Jsc suggest that Li cations might interact appropriately with surfaces of TNTs electrodes with minimizing the positive shift of CBP of TNTs electrodes but with enhancement of the electron injection from dye molecules into TNTs electrodes. The different behavior between TNTs electrodes and P25 electrodes seems to indicate that the unique surface structure of TNTs is favorable for appropriate adsorption of Li cations.


2.4. Effect of TiCl4 treatment of the mesoporous electrodes. 
Treatment of the TNTs electrodes with aqueous TiCl4 solution was applied for further improvement of photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. This treatment is a well-known method to enhance photocurrent of DSSCs. The explanations of the effect of the TiCl4 treatment proposed by many groups comprised the improvement of interparticle necking2,13,37 and scattering effect38 through the formation of thin titanium dioxide coating on the interfaces of porous TiO2 electrode. Note that the thin titanium dioxide layer would be formed not only on TiO2 interparticles but also at FTO/TiO2 interfaces since the TiCl4 solution can penetrate into mesopores of the TiO2 film.
The photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs with/without TiCl4 treatment are listed in Table 4. Both TNTs and P25 electrodes treated with TiCl4 solution showed much improvement of Jsc and increase of Voc while FF slightly decreased. According to the above-mentioned literature, those phenomena can be attributed to the facilitation of electron transport and suppression of the recombination reaction with I3−. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with the TNTs electrode was given as follows, the Jsc, Voc, and FF are 13.3 mA cm−2, 0.79 V, and 0.68, respectively, yielding η of 7.1%. As for the P25 electrode, the Jsc, Voc, and FF are 13.3 mA cm−2, 0.75 V, and 0.63, respectively, yielding η of 6.2%. Thus, DSSCs fabricated with TNTs electrodes were found to show higher Voc and FF, resulting in higher η than those with P25 electrodes. Taking into the account the fact that the thin titanium dioxide layer formed at FTO/TiO2 interfaces by the TiCl4 treatment can contribute to the improvement of both Jsc and Voc through prevention of the recombination reaction with I3−, the remarkable difference in the Voc values between TNTs and P25 might be explained as being due to the difference in the nanostructure at FTO/TiO2 interfaces. However, further research on TNTs electrodes is required for clarifying the effect of interface structure.

3. Electron transport property of the mesoporous electrodes
Studies on electron transport in the mesoporous TiO2 film electrodes composed of nanosize spherical-like particles like P25 have been performed in recent years. However, electron transport property of the electrodes having specific morphology like TNTs has not been investigated yet. To evaluate and compare with the electron transport properties in TNTs and P25 electrodes, measurements of diffusion coefficient and lifetime of electrons in the electrodes had been carried out by using the method developed by our group.28 Through these measurements, the diffusion length which can be an index of electron transport property in the electrode16,39 is evaluated as the square root of the product of the diffusion coefficient and the electron lifetime. For these measurements, DSSCs fabricated with TNTs employed the optimized electrolytes, Electrolyte 2 and those with P25 Electrolyte 1, respectively.
The electron diffusion coefficients (D) were estimated using τc, which was given by fitting the transient photocurrent decay with exp(−t/τc), where t is time. The D values were obtained by D
					=
					ω2/2.77τc, where ω is the thickness of TiO2 film. In Fig. 6, the estimated D values are plotted as a function of Isc per TiO2 unit volume obtained from the short-circuit photocurrent divided by film thickness and porosity. All samples show nearly a power low dependence on Isc per TiO2 unit volume. The D value of TNTs was almost comparable with that of P25. The diffusion coefficients have been interpreted mainly with the charge trap site density and distribution in the mesoporous electrode. The trap sites may be formed mainly by grain boundaries and crystal defects. Crystal defects can be covered with cations contained in the electrolyte, according to an ambipolar diffusion mechanism.33 As for the grain boundaries, the number of boundaries across the TiO2 film was not possibly decreased much because the orientation of nanotubes perpendicular to the conductive substrate had not been achieved in the TNTs electrodes. If the electrode with perfectly oriented nanorods or nanotubes can be applied for the DSSCs, the diffusion coefficient may be greatly increased.
 Fig. 6  Electron diffusion coefficients in the electrodes constructed with TNTs (circles) and P25 (triangles) as a function of Isc per unit TiO2 volume. Electrolyte 2 for the TNTs electrode and Electrolyte 1 for P25 electrode were used, respectively. 
In electron lifetime measurements, the same samples in the electron diffusion coefficient measurements were used. The electron lifetime (τ) in TiO2 electrodes was obtained by fitting the transient photovoltage decay with exp(−t/τ), where t is the time. The obtained electron lifetime as a function of Isc per TiO2 unit volume is shown in Fig. 7. The τ value in TNTs electrode was about 3 times greater than that in P25. This result indicates that the probability of recombination between the electron in TiO2 and I3− in the electrolyte of TNTs is smaller than that of P25.
 Fig. 7  Electron lifetimes at open circuit conditions in the electrodes constructed with TNTs (circles) and P25 (triangles) as a function of Isc per unit TiO2 volume. Electrolyte 2 for the TNTs electrode and Electrolyte 1 for P25 electrode were used, respectively. 
Taking into the account that the diffusion coefficients for TNTs and P25 are nearly same, TNTs was found to have longer diffusion length, that is, more excellent electron transport property than P25. These results give us not only a guarantee of a high photocurrent obtained from thick TNTs film but also an interpretation of the difference of photovoltaic performance of DSSCs between TNTs and P25 electrodes. The Voc values of the DSSCs are determined by the difference between Fermi levels for electrons in the TiO2 electrode and the redox potential of I−/I3−. Thus, the negative shift of the Fermi level resulting from the increase of electron density in the TNTs electrode would be the main reason why the Voc values of the DSSCs using TNTs are much higher than those of P25. As the same diffusion coefficients were observed for TNTs and P25, the longer electron lifetime of TNTs increases the electron density in the TNTs electrode. Another hypothesis of increase of the electron density in TNTs electrode is similar to the effect of TiCl4 treatment. As mentioned in the literature,40 the TiCl4 treatment increases electron density of the TiO2 electrode which can be attributed to inhibiting the recombination reactions. Since we assume that the recombination at FTO/TiO2 interfaces should be prevented in DSSCs, the higher electron density of TNTs electrodes is explained by prevention of the recombination reactions as a leakage of electrons at FTO/TiO2 interfaces as a result of favorable and effective formation of FTO/TiO2 interfaces originating from larger contact area of the TNTs that are parallel to conducting FTO glasses.
Conclusions
The present study shows that the morphology of TNTs electrode as a result of fabrication conditions strongly affects the performance as the working electrode of DSSCs. The optimized conditions such as the pH of paste, sintering temperature: pH = 1, 550 °C for 30 min., and the electrolyte composed of 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.65 M DMPImI in methoxyacetonitrile, combined with the surface modification by TiCl4 treatment has led to achievement of the high energy conversion efficiency, 7.1%. In comparison with commercially available nanoparticles P25, the DSSCs using TNTs electrode show higher energy conversion efficiency than that using P25 electrode under the optimized conditions, mainly due to the higher open-circuit voltage of TNTs electrode.
The evaluation of the electron transport property of TNTs electrode has been performed for the first time through measurements of the diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime. Those measurements revealed that the TNTs electrodes have a longer electron lifetime and diffusion length than the electrode made of P25. The longer electron lifetime results in increase of the electron density in the TNTs electrode, leading to a high open-circuit voltage.
