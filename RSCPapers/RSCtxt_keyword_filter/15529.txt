    , Accepted 10th November 2016First published on 10th November 2016AbstractWith similar transition metal (TM) complex cations as structural directing agents (SDAs), six new hybrid lead bromides were synthesized and structurally characterized as [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2{[Co(2,2-bipy)]3Pb7Br24} (1), [Co(2,2-bipy)2Br]PbBr3 (2), [TM(phen)3]Pb2Br6 (TM = Co (3) and Ni (4)), [Co(2,2-bipy)3]Pb3Br9 (5) and [Co(2,2-bipy)3]Pb5Br13·CH3CN (6) with distinct structural types from zero-dimensional (0D) unit, one-dimensional (1D) chain to two-dimensional (2D) layer. Compound 1 contains the 0D {[Co(bipy)]3Pb7Br24}4− units built from the [Pb7Br24] ring attached by three unsaturated [Co(2,2-bipy)]2+ complexes via Co–Br bonds. Under the direction actions of different SDAs, compounds 2 and 3–4 contain two different types of [Pb2Br6]4− chains based on the same octahedral [PbBr6] units but with distinct connecting manners, respectively. Using the same [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ as SDA, compound 5 reveals a 1D [Pb3Br9]3− double chain, whereas compound 6 features a 2D complex [Pb5Br13]3− layer. The UV/vis diffuse-reflectance measurements reveal that the title compounds feature tunable band gaps of 1.70–2.29 eV. Under the visible light irradiation, sample 6 exhibits efficient and stable photocatalytic degradation activities over organic pollutants, which mainly originates from the multi-electronic effects of the TM complex cations. A possible photocatalytic mechanism is also proposed based on the radical trapping experiments and electronic band structural calculations.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic hybrid metal halogenide materials have received great attention due to not only their fascinating structural diversity but also for the distinctive physical properties originating from the integration of inorganic and organic components.1–4 Among these materials, the hybrid lead(II) halogenides represent a potential class of multi-functional materials used in solar cells, optical and ferroelectric crystals, etc.5 For instance, the use of the perovskite halide compound (CH3NH3)PbI3 in solar cells has revolutionized the prospects of emerging photovoltaic technologies due to the high-power conversion efficiency and ease of fabrication.6 As a consequence, encouraged by their practical and potential applications in photoelectronic devices, the design and synthesis of new types of multi-functional hybrid lead(II) halogenide materials has attracted extensive interest in crystal engineering and also in band structure design.
Generally speaking, the Pb(II) ion is able to adopt a myriad of coordination geometries including PbX4, quadrangular pyramidal PbX5 and octahedral PbX6 (X = Cl, Br or I). More interestingly, the octahedral PbX6 unit features high self-assembly characterization and diversiform condensation modes including corner-, edge- and face-sharing. Until now, using organic cations as templates and charge compensation agents, numerous [PbxXy](y−2x)− anionic clusters or oligomers have been characterized, such as [Pb2X6]2−, [Pb3X10]4−, [Pb5X16]6−, [Pb7I22]8−, [Pb10I28]8−, [Pb18I44]8−, etc.7 Using these clusters or secondary building units (SBUs) as building blocks, a large amount of 1D chains including [Pb2X6]2−, [Pb2X7]3−, [Pb2X9]5−, [Pb2X10]6−, [Pb3X9]3−, [Pb3X10]4−, [Pb5I12]2−, [Pb18I54(I2)9]18−, and some 2D layers of [PbX4]2−, [Pb2X8]4−, [Pb7I18]4− were structurally characterized.8–10 On the other hand, 3D frameworks have been rarely documented with the limited topological networks of [Pb7I18]4−, [Pb2Cl6]2− and [Pb21Cl59]17−.11 On the basis of crystal structural analyses, the nonlinear optical, ferroelectric, switchable dielectric and luminescent properties of these hybrid lead halogenides have also been detailed investigated, for example, the 3D (H2DABCO)(Pb2Cl6) features white-light emitting properties with the highest CRI value of 90 in single component phosphors obtained to date.11b
As far as we known, the templates or SDAs play a very important role in the crystal structural construction and electronic band design as well as photoelectronic property regulation.12 Hence, an effective strategy for the development of novel multi-functional hybrid lead halogenides is to introduce unique templates as SDAs. Herein, it should be noted that most of the above hybrid lead halogenides are directed by various organic templates. In recent years, TM complex cations have been widely used in the construction of inorganic–organic hybrid materials due to the unique and diverse template effects.13 Comparing with the soft and flexible organic templates, rigid TM complex cations are able to afford more stable templated effects for controlling inorganic networks. Functionally, the photo or electrochemical active TM complex may enhance or improve the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of the hybrid materials. Especially, the TM complex cations occupying the conduction bands of the hybrid materials feature excellent electron accepting and transfer capabilities, which not only effectively increases their photochemical stabilities, but also greatly tunes the band structures and photoelectric characteristics, such as the visible light driven photocatalytic properties.14
Intrigued by the rich structural types and potential photoelectronic properties of these hybrid lead halogenide materials, we undertook a systematic study of the synthesis and photocatalytic properties of TM complex directed lead(II) bromides, which has been rarely studied until now. We prepared five different types of low-dimensional hybrid lead halogenides, namely, [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2{[Co(2,2-bipy)]3Pb7Br24}, [Co(2,2-bipy)2Br]PbBr3, [TM(phen)3]Pb2Br6 (TM = Co, Ni), [Co(2,2-bipy)3]Pb3Br9 and [Co(2,2-bipy)3]Pb5Br13·CH3CN. These materials feature semiconducting properties with narrow band gaps of 1.70–2.29 eV and visible light driven photocatalytic activity for sample 6. In this paper, we report their syntheses, crystal structures, optical and photocatalytic properties (Scheme 1).

All the reagents were commercially available and directly used as received without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) with 2θ range of 5–80°. The elemental analyses were performed on a PE2400 II elemental analyzer. The UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded on a PE Lambda 900 UV/vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm.

Photocatalytic activity measurements
The common used organic pollutants of Rhodamine B (RhB), Methyl Orange (MO) and Crystal Violet (CV) were selected to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared sample 6 under visible light irradiation from a 50 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter to remove all ultraviolet and infrared light (400 nm < λ < 780 nm). In a photocatalytic activity measurement, 30 mg of powder sample 6 was added to a 30 mL of 1 × 10−5 mol L−1 organic dye solvent in a quartz tube, and the above suspension was continually stirred in the dark for 10 hours until the absorption/desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst powder and the organic dyes was reached. After that, the solvent was exposed to visible light irradiation, and 4 mL of the mixture was continually taken from the reaction cell after a given irradiation time. The catalysts were separated from the suspensions by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant fluid was analyzed by recording the maximum absorption band (554 nm for RhB, 464 nm for MO and 588 nm for CV) on a GBC Cintra 2020 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The radical-trapping experiments were performed by adding a small amount of ammonium oxalate (AO), tert-butylalcohol (TBA), and benzoquinone (BQ) to the photodegradation reaction of RhB, respectively.
Computational details
The crystallographic data of compound 6 were used to calculate the electronic band structure by using density functional theory (DFT) with the CASTEP code based on gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals (GGA-PBE), which uses the plane-wave basis set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential for the core electrons.16 Pseudoatomic calculations were performed for Pb-5d106s26p2, Br-4s24p5, Co-3d74s2, C-2s22p2, N-2s22p3 and H-1s1. The other calculating parameters and convergence criteria were set using the default values of the CASTEP code.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
In this manuscript, we used Co2+ or Ni2+ complex cations as SDAs and prepared a series of new hybrid lead bromides. Although we tried our best to vary the reaction conditions, no other TM2+ (Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, etc.) complex directed phases could be successfully synthesized. The title compounds were synthesized using the same reaction temperature and starting materials but with distinct structural features. Detailed studies showed that there are mainly two types of factors playing an important role in the construction of the inorganic networks. Firstly, the solvent greatly affects the main products, that is, the title compounds were prepared in different mixed solvents. We also tried to synthesize the title compounds in the same solvent, but the experiments failed which showed these compounds are only crystallized in their respective solvents. Hence, the pH value, polarity, dissolving capacity and boiling points of the solvent play a critical role in the crystallisation of hybrid lead halogenides. Secondly, KBr was added to the solvent as the source of Br−, and, therefore, it effectively increased the solubility of the PbBr2. The concentration of Br− ions also plays an important role in the controlled synthesis of hybrid materials, especially for the dimension of the structures. A higher concentration of Br− ions will lead to the low-dimensional oligomers or chains, whereas a lower concentration results in the high-dimensional structures. In the syntheses of the title compounds, we controlled the ratio of PbBr2:KBr to be about 1:2 for 1–2, 1:1.5 for 3–4 and 1:1 for 5–6, respectively.
Crystal structures

Crystal structure of 1. 
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that compound 1 crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3 (no. 146) and features isolated {[Co(2,2-bipy)]3Pb7Br24}4− units separated by saturated [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex cations. There are three crystallographically independent Co, three Pb, seven Br atoms and 2,2-bipy ligands in the asymmetric unit of compound 1. Both the Pb(1) and Pb(3) atoms are coordinated by six Br atoms with slightly distorted [PbBr6] octahedral environments with Pb–Br bond distances of 2.891(2)–3.162(2) Å and neighbouring Br–Pb–Br angles of 73.17(6)–96.78(6) Å, which are comparable with those of reported lead(II) bromides, such as (EDBE)PbBr4, (C4H10N)2Pb2Br4, etc.17 The Pb(2) atom is surrounded by four Br atoms in an unusual “octahedral [PbBr4]” with a cis divacant coordination sphere and Pb–Br bond lengths of 2.823(2)–3.174(2) Å. Three Pb(2)Br4 and three Pb(3)Br6 units are interlinked via corner sharing to form a Pb6Br24 ring with a 12-membered ring composed of Pb6Br6, which is further located by Pb(1) atom via Pb–Br bonds into a planar Pb7Br24 unit. Such [Pb7Br24] unit is similar to the Anderson-type [Bi7I24]3− in [Bi(OAc)2(THF)4]3Bi7I24 and [Na3(THF)x]Bi7I24.18 Subsequently, the Pb7Br24 unit is attached by three [Co(2,2-bipy)]2+ complexes via Co–Br bonds leading to the anionic {[Co(2,2-bipy)]3Pb7Br24}4− unit (Fig. 1a). The neighbouring {[Co(2,2-bipy)]3Pb7Br24}4− units feature a planar arrangement in the ab-plane, and are interconnected by the [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex cations via hydrogen bonds to a three-dimensional (3D) H-bonding network (Fig. 1b).

Crystal structure of 2. 
Compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn (no. 60) and features anionic [PbBr3]− chains charge balanced by [Co(2,2-bipy)2Br]+ complex cations. In the asymmetric unit of compound 2, there is one crystallographically independent Co, one Pb, four Br atoms and two 2,2-bipy ligands. The Co2+ ion is coordinated by two 2,2-bipy ligands and one Br atoms with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Pb(1) atom adopts a PbBr6 octahedral coordination environment with Pb–Br bond distances of 2.9504(8)–3.1330(9) Å, which belongs to the normal range. The PbBr6 octahedral units are self-condensed via face-sharing to form a 1D [PbBr3]− chain along the b-axis, which is reported in many hybrid lead bromides.8 The 1D [PbBr3]− chains feature a parallel arrangement along the a-axis, and are further bridged by the [Co(2,2-bipy)2Br]+ complex via weak C–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds to form a 3D H-bonding network (Fig. 2b).

Crystal structures of 3–4. 
Compounds 3 and 4 crystallize in the triclinic space group P (no. 2) and contain the 1D curved [Pb2Br6]2− chains separated by [TM(phen)3]2+ complex cations. In the asymmetric unit of compound 4, there are two crystallographically independent Co, five Pb, twelve Br atoms and six phen ligands. All the Pb2+ are coordinated by six Br atoms with slightly distorted [PbBr6] octahedral geometries except that Pb(1) atom adopts a quadrangular pyramidal [PbBr5] coordination environment. The Pb–Br bond lengths fall in the range of 2.8081(11)–3.2258(10) Å, which are comparable with those of compounds 1–2. Each Pb(1)Br5, Pb(2)Br6 and Pb(5)Br6 unit is interconnected via sharing Br atoms to form a [Pb3Br12] trimer, which is further interlinked by Pb(3)Br6 and Pb(4)Br6 octahedral units via face-sharing to form curved [Pb2Br6]2− chains along the c-axis. The neighbouring [Pb2Br6]2− chains are bridged by [Ni(phen)3]2+ complex cations via weak C–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds along the a- and b-axis into a 3D H-bonding network (Fig. 3b).

Crystal structure of 5. 
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that compound 5 belongs to the monoclinic P21/c (no. 14) and contains a novel 1D [Pb3Br9]3− chain. In the asymmetric unit of 5, there is one Co, three Pb, nine Br atoms and three 2,2-bipy ligands. Pb(1) and Pb(3) atom is coordinated by six Br atoms with [PbBr6] octahedral geometry, whereas Pb(2) atom adopts a [PbBr5] quadrangular pyramidal coordination environment. The Pb–Br bond distances of 2.8332(19)–3.320(2) Å belong to the normal values. The Pb(1)Br6, Pb(2)Br5 and Pb(3)Br6 units are connected via sharing Br atoms to form a [Pb3Br10] single chain, which is further self-condensed via corner-sharing into a double 1D [Pb3Br9]3− chain along the a-axis (Fig. 4a). The neighbouring [Pb3Br9]3− chains feature a parallel arrangement along the c-axis and reversed stacking along the b-axis, and saturated [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ complex cations are located among the 1D [Pb3Br9]3− chains interconnected via extensive C–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds into a 3D supramolecular network (Fig. 4b).

Crystal structure of 6. 
Compound 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c (no. 14) and adopts a new structural type. Its structure contains 2D anionic [Pb5Br13]3− layers, [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ complex cations and an isolated CH3CN molecule. In the asymmetric unit of 6, there are one crystallographically independent Co, five Pb, twelve Br atoms, three 2,2-bipy ligands and one CH3CN molecule. All the Pb atoms adopt distorted octahedral [PbBr6] coordination environments except for the Pb(3) and Pb(5) atoms which are coordinated by five Br atoms with distorted quadrangular pyramidal [PbBr5] geometries. The Pb–Br bond distances of 2.7215(10)–3.2265(8) Å belong to the normal values. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Pb(1)Br6 and Pb(4)Br6 octahedral units are linked to form a Pb2Br10 dimer, and Pb(2)Br5 and Pb(3)Br6 are also connected into another Pb2Br10 dimer via edge-sharing. These two types of [Pb2Br10] dimers are condensed via sharing Br atoms to form a 1D [Pb4Br12] chain along the c-axis (Fig. 5a). The neighbouring 1D [Pb4Br12] chains are bridged by Pb(5)Br5 units via edge-sharing to form 2D [Pb5Br13]3− layers in the bc-plane (Fig. 5b). Such connectivity also leads to one type of approximately quadrangle [Pb8Br8] ring viewed along the a-axis. The neighbouring 2D [Pb5Br13]3− layers feature parallel packing along the a-axis, and are further bridged by [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ complex cations via hydrogen bonds into a 3D H-bonding network (Fig. 5c).

Under the templated or directed action of organic cations, the inorganic–organic hybrid lead bromides feature various 1D and 2D (PbxBry)(y−2x)−anionic chains with diversiform condensation modes based on PbBr4 and PbBr6 polyhedrons.19,20 Hence, it is very interesting to compare their structural characteristics according to the basic units of [PbBr3]−, [Pb2Br6]2−, [Pb2Br7]3−, [Pb2Br9]5−, [Pb2Br10]6−, and [Pb3Br9]3−, etc. As the most common 1D chain, the linear [PbBr3]− chain is composed of [PbBr6] octahedral units via face-sharing, and the [Pb2Br6]2− chain is built up from two parallel curved [PbBr4] chains via edge-sharing.19 The [Pb2Br10]6− chain is constituted by a [Pb2Br5] single chain attached by [PbBr6] octahedra via corner-sharing.20 In the [Pb3Br8]2− chain, two opposite Ψ-[PbBr4] units are bridged by one [PbBr6] octahedron via face-sharing to form the [Pb3Br8]2− chain.21 With increasing Pb content, the [Pb3Br14]8− and [Pb4Br18]10− chains feature two similar structural types based on a [PbBr6] octahedron with similar connecting manners.22 The [Pb4Br12]4− chain can be considered as one [Pb2Br10] single chain attached by [PbBr5] tetragonal pyramids on both side via edge-sharing.23 As for 2D lead bromides, a few examples have been reported including [Pb2Br8]4− and [Pb3Br10]4− layers.22a,24 Comparing with these (PbxBry)(y−2x)− anionic units, the [Pb2Br6]2− chain in compounds 3–4 and [Pb3Br9]3− chain in compound 5 reported here represent two types of new 1D chains, and the [Pb5Br13]3− in compound 6 also belongs to a novel anionic 2D layer in hybrid lead bromides, which further indicates the unique structural directing effects of TM complex cations.

Optical properties
The UV/vis absorption spectra of compounds 1–6 in the solid state were measured at room temperature and are shown in Fig. 6. The optical band gaps obtained through extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edges are estimated to be 1.70 eV, 1.83 eV, 2.19 eV, 2.18 eV, 2.29 eV and 2.08 eV for compounds 1–6, respectively, indicating the semiconducting properties. Obviously, all the title compounds feature smaller band gaps and exhibit a red shift of the absorption edge compared with the bulk PbBr2 (2.81 eV) and most of the hybrid lead bromides directed by organic cations, such as (N-MPDA)[PbBr4] (3.5 eV), (N-MEDA)[PbBr4] (3.8 eV), etc., which mainly originate from the contribution of TM complexes for the conduction bands as discussed in the following.5

Photocatalytic properties
The narrow band gaps of the title hybrid compounds encourage us to investigate their visible light driven photocatalytic properties, which have not been studied until now. Compound 6 was selected as the representative compound and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated via photodecomposition of organic pollutants, such as RhB, MO and CV, under visible light irradiation. Before the photocatalytic reaction, both the experiments of light irradiated CV self-photodegradation without catalysts and the catalytic experiment without light irradiation show a not observable decrease in RhB, MO and CV concentrations. Subsequently, sample 6 powder was added to the solvent of the organic pollutants, and the mixture was stirred for 10 hours in the dark until the equilibrium of absorption and desorption between the photocatalyst powder and the organic dyes was reached. Under the visible light irradiation, all the organic pollutants were destroyed and the colors of the solvents changed from initial red, yellow and purple to nearly colourless, respectively (Fig. S2†). As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the time dependent degradation ratio of RhB, MO and CV reached nearly 100% after 50 min under visible light irradiation resulting in complete decolorization. At the same time, we also studied the photocatalytic properties of PbBr2 as comparison under the exactly same condition, and the result shows that more than 93%, 91%, and 84% of RhB, MO and CV is still present in solution after irradiation for 50 min. Given that the photodegradation follows the first order kinetic reaction, we calculated the rate constant according to the equation ln(C0/C) = kt, where C0 and C represent the initial and remnant concentrations of the organic dyes, and k is the rate constant (Fig. 7c). The simulated k values for sample 6 of 0.101 min−1, 0.049 min−1, 0.045 min−1 for RhB, MO and CV, respectively, are evidently larger than those for PbBr2 (0.002 min−1, 0.003 min−1 and 0.005 min−1). Hence, the hybrid compound 6 features a higher photocatalytic activity than PbBr2.

To check the photochemical stability of compound 6, we also further studied the stability and reusability by collecting and reusing the same photocatalyst for 5 cycles. Only insignificant loss in photocatalytic activity is observed, which shows the stable photocatalytic activity of sample 6 (Fig. 7d). The XRD pattern at the end of the repeated experiments is almost identical to that of the as-prepared sample (Fig. S3†). Thus, sample 6 can be used as a stable photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.
Possible photocatalytic mechanism
The photocatalytic mechanism of compound 6 is further investigated. It is generally accepted that the organic dyes can be degraded by a large number of reactive species including photoinduced holes (h+), superoxide anions (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) during the photocatalytic oxidation process. Therefore, the radical-trapping scavengers, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, an ˙OH radical scavenger), ammonium oxalate (AO, a h+ scavenger), and benzoquinone (BQ, an ˙O2− radical scavenger), were used to investigate their effects on the degradation of CV. It is found that all the addition of TBA, AO and BQ greatly reduced the photocatalytic efficiencies of CV indicating that all ˙OH, h+ and ˙O2− as the dominant reactive species play an important role in the degradation of the organic dyes over sample 6 (Fig. S2d†). Furthermore, we also calculate the electronic band structure of compound 6 based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. On the basis of total and partial DOS diagram, the valence band (VB) just below the Fermi level is mainly contributed by the Pb-5p and Br-3p orbitals, and the conduction band (CB) above the Fermi level is mainly derived from the Co-3d, C-2p and N-2p states. Hence, the charge transition of compound 6 mainly occurs between the 2D anionic [Pb5Br13]5− layers and [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ cations. According to the radical-trapping experiments and electronic band structure of sample 6 as well as similar reported work, the photogenerated electrons can be easily transferred from the 2D [Pb5Br13]5− layers (VB) to [Co(2,2-bipy)3]3+ cations (CB) in the photocatalytic reaction.25,26 The photogenerated electrons are captured by O2 and H2O to form ˙O2−and ˙OH, which contribute to the decomposition of the organic dyes. Simultaneously, the remaining photogenerated holes also participate in the degradation of the organic dyes. It should be noted that the strong electron absorption ability of TM complexes effectively prevents the recombination of the photogenerated electron and hole pairs, which effectively promotes the photocatalytic activity of hybrid lead bromide. Hence, the introduction of TM complex cations play an important role for the visible light driven photocatalytic activity including structural directing, band structural regulation and separation of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalytic degradation process.
Conclusions
A series of hybrid lead bromides directed by TM complexes were synthesized and characterized with distinct crystal structures from 0D unit, 1D chain to 2D layer, which provides the possibility of constructing new lead bromide networks based on various TM complex cations. The TM complex cationic dyes feature excellent photosensitization activity and strong electron absorption abilities, which lead to high visible light driven photocatalytic activities. This work further illustrates the possibility of constructing new visible light driven photocatalysts based on semiconducting hybrid materials decorated by TM complexes. Further studies on the structural regulation and structure–photocatalytic property relationship are in progress in our group.
