    , Accepted 20th February 2020First published on 21st February 2020AbstractAlthough Cu–In–Se (CISe) quantum dots (QDs) with narrow tunable bandgap and low toxicity have promising prospects in photovoltaics, their application is seriously restricted by high defect density. To develop a facile synthesis method for high-quality CISe QDs, Al and Zn ions were introduced into the synthesis of CISe QDs. Compared with the incorporation of Al or Zn alone, the trap-state defects in CISe QDs can be more effectively reduced by the co-incorporation of these metal ions. The synthesized CISe QDs then were used as light harvester materials to fabricate photoanodes for constructing quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The photovoltaic performance of the QDSCs based on Al/Zn co-incorporated QDs was observed to be much better than that of the QDSCs based on Al or Zn alone incorporated QDs, which could be ascribed to the suppression of unfavorable charge combination in QDSCs. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.27% (Jsc = 27.15 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.620 V, and FF = 61.0%) was achieved on the QDSCs with Cu2S/brass counter electrodes and polysulfide electrolyte under simulated one full sun illumination, which is among the reported best PCEs of the QDSCs with a similar structure.
1. Introduction
Colloidal I–III–VI2 quantum dots (QDs) attract more and more attention because of their unique optoelectronic properties and inherently lower toxicity in comparison with Cd- and Pb-chalcogenide-based QDs.1–7 Of particular interest, Cu–In–Se (CISe) QDs have a widely tunable absorption and emission spectra ranging from visible light to a second near-infrared (NIR) window, making them promising candidates as light harvesters in photovoltaic devices and light-emitters in light-emitting devices.8–14 However, the development of methods for the synthesis of CISe QDs has not yet reached the level of proficiency achieved by Cd- and Pb-chalcogenide-based QDs, which hinders their full potential in applications.15–19
With wide spectrum response range and suitable conduction band position, CISe QDs have been considered to be a promising light harvester for quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).15–21 Unfortunately, the QDSCs based on CISe QDs with absorption onset up to 1000 nm show a short-circuit current density (Jsc) 23 mA cm−2, well below the theoretical value of about 30 mA cm−2, mainly because of high defect density in CISe QDs.22,23 The trap state defects commonly cause unfavorable charge recombination within QDs and between the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces, resulting in insufficient sunlight utilization and consequent low power conversion efficiency (PCE).24–27 Recently, attempts have been made to reduce defects by coating an inorganic shell layer with a wider bandgap (Eg) (commonly ZnS and ZnSe) around CISe QDs.28,29 Although the formation of a type I core/shell structure can partially suppress charge recombination, the shell layer formed at the same time is unfavorable for charge extraction.30–32 It is well-known that CISe QDs can tolerate a large range of off-stoichiometry both in the ratio of the two cations and of anion/cation.4,33–35 This off-stoichiometry effect can be used to tune their Eg and optical properties by introducing various metal elements.35–39 For example, Zn ions were introduced into CISe QDs to form alloy Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDs having a higher conduction band position and a lower defect density, thereby promoting photogenerated electrons extraction and suppressing unfavorable charge recombination in QDSCs.23
To further reduce trap-state defects in CISe QDs and improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, in this paper, Al and Zn ions were attempted to be incorporated into CISe QDs simultaneously to synthesize (Alx/Zn1−x)–Cu–In–Se QDs (denoted as (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs). The (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs synthesized were further deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films to prepare photoanodes for the construction of QDSCs. Experimental data show that the simultaneous incorporation of Al and Zn ions into CISe QDs can reduce trap-state defects in QDs more effectively than the incorporation of only Zn ions or Al into CISe QDs. The unfavorable charge recombination in QDSCs constructed is consequently suppressed, resulting in a significant improvement in Jsc and PCE of QDSCs. A champion PCE of 10.27% (Jsc = 27.15 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.620 V, and FF = 61.0%) was finally achieved under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination in combination with Cu2S/brass counter electrodes (CEs) and polysulfide electrolyte.
2. Experimental
2.1 Reagents
Oleylamine (OAm, 80–90 wt%) was received from Acros Organics. Indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99 wt%) and selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99 wt%) were purchased from Aldrich. 1-Octadecene (ODE, 90 wt%) and diphenylphosphine (DPP, 98 wt%) were bought from J&K. Copper iodide (CuI, 99.998 wt%), sulfur (S) of 99.99 wt% and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99 wt%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Aluminum tristearate (AlC54H105O6, AlSt3, CP), aluminum chloride (AlCl3·6H2O), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(OAc)2·2H2O) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) were obtained from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals used as received without further treatments.
2.2 Synthesis of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs
Oil-soluble (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs were synthesized according to our reported method.23,40 Typically, Al and Zn precursors were prepared by dissolving 1.0 mmol AlSt3 and Zn(OAc)2 salt in the mixture of ODE and OAm (volume ratio of 9:1) at 120 °C under nitrogen flow, respectively. Se precursor (DPP-Se) was obtained by dissolving 0.50 mmol of Se powder in the mixture of DPP and OAm (volume ratio of 1:1) with ultrasonic treatment. First, the total amount of 0.10 mmol of Al and Zn precursor with various molar percentage of Al precursor from 0 to 100%, were loaded into a 50 mL three-necked flask that contains 0.15 mmol of CuI, 0.20 mmol of In(OAc)3, 4.0 mL of OAm and 1.0 mL of ODE. The system above was degassed at 90 °C for 10 min and heated up to 180 °C under a nitrogen flow. Then DPP-Se was quickly injected into the reaction system above. After reacting for 5 min at 180 °C, the system was cooled to room temperature and was purified by precipitation and sequent centrifugation with ethanol as antisolvent. The purified QDs were finally dispersed in dichloromethane for further use. So as to effectively tether QDs on the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes, the oil-soluble QDs prepared was transferred to water-soluble MPA-capped QDs via ligand exchange method following the procedure reported.41
2.3 Fabrication of QDSCs
TiO2 mesoporous films containing about 20 μm-thick transparent layer and 10 μm-thick light scattering layer were first prepared by the screen-printing method reported in works of literature.23,42,43 The water-soluble MPA-modified QDs prepared were then pipetted on the TiO2 films. After storing at 50 °C for 2 hours, the QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were obtained and then overcoated with ZnS layers via successively immersed in 0.1 M of Zn(OAc)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M of Na2S aqueous solutions for five cycles. The QDSCs were finally assembled by clamping the QDs-sensitized photoanode and Cu2S/brass counter electrode using a binder clip. The photoanode and counter electrode were separated by a 50 μm thick insulating tape. The polysulfide electrolyte containing 2.0 M of Na2S and 2.0 M of S was injected into the incision of insulating tape.
2.4 Characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600). The current–voltage curves (J–V curves) of the cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G solar light (Oriel, model no. 94022A) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was adjusted by an NREL standard Si solar cell before measurement. IPCE curves were tested on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner) at forward bias from −0.30 to −0.60 V under dark conditions, using a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constantly applied bias with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) of devices was tested by the same electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner). The devices were illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and then the decay changes of photovoltage were recorded when the light source was turned off. The morphologies of QDs prepared were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). Typically, the samples for TEM investigation were prepared by dropping OAm-capped QD dispersed in toluene onto the copper mesh. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was acquired from a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Scientific™ K-Alpha™+ spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at 100 W. Samples were analyzed under vacuum (P < 10−8 mbar) with a pass energy of 150 eV (survey scans) or 25 eV (high-resolution scans). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Agilent 725) and XPS were applied to confirm the successful incorporation of Al ions into ZCISe QDs. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were performed in Edinburgh FLS 980.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and optical properties of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs
In this paper, conventional CISe QDs were synthesized by hot injection of DPP-Se solution into the mixture of Cu and In precursor stock solutions at 180 °C.23,40 In order to incorporate Al and Zn ions into CISe QDs, the mixture of Al and Zn precursors were introduced the reaction system of CISe QDs. During the synthesis procedure, the amounts of Se, In and Cu together with the total amount of Al and Zn precursor were fixed, while the molar percentage of Al in the mixture of Al and Zn precursors (denoted as x) was adjusted from 0 to 100%. With the various amounts of Al added, a series of QDs were obtained and are denoted as (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs (x = 0 refers to ZCISe QDs and x = 1 refers to ACISe QDs).
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs with various amount of the Al and Zn precursors added are shown in Fig. 1a–e. It can be seen that the whole series of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs have almost identical average particle sizes (2.80 ± 0.35 nm). The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1f present that all (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs have the same chalcopyrite structure. The results suggest that the simultaneous introductions of Al and Zn precursors into the reaction system do not change both the crystal size and structure of QDs.

Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was measured, with the data and the raw ratios of the added precursors listed in Table 1. It can be observed that Al and Zn could be successfully incorporated into CISe QDs by the introduction of the Al and Zn precursors into the reaction system. Moreover, the increase in the molar percentage of Al precursors results in an increase in the Al content in the prepared QDs. To further confirm the existence of the Al and Zn element co-incorporated in the CISe QDs obtained, the XPS test was conducted, with the data shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). All samples prepared by the introduction of Al precursors show the high-resolution Al 2p peaks located at 73 eV (Fig. S1b, ESI†), demonstrating the existence of Al ions in the QDs prepared.

The absorption spectra of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs prepared are shown in Fig. 2a. With the increase in the molar percentage of Al precursor from 0 to 100, the absorption edge of the QDs prepared shows a monotonic redshift from 1000 nm to 1040 nm, which demonstrates that increasing the molar percentage of Al precursors leads to the decrease in the Eg of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs. The corresponding Eg values of various QDs can be estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the plot of (αhν)2vs. hν, in which the x-axis intercept of an extrapolated line from the linear regime of the curve represents the Eg value. The Eg values derived from absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Pristine ZCISe shows the Eg of ∼1.44 eV, 60 meV larger than that of pristine ACISe with an Eg value of ∼1.38 eV. Meanwhile, the corresponding PL spectra of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs recorded on the same condition are shown in Fig. 2b. The emission peak of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs shows a redshift with an increase in the Al/Zn molar ratio. The emission intensity increases with an increasing molar percentage of Al precursor from 0 to 50 and then decreases with a further increase in the Al precursor. It should be noted that the whole series of Al and Zn co-incorporated QDs show a higher PL intensity than both Al and Zn single incorporated CISe QDs, indicating that the trap-state defects in CISe QDs can be more effectively reduced by Al and Zn co-incorporation.

In order to exclude the effect of the added stearate anions on optical properties of QDs, we also synthesized (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs by the same procedure using different Al salts such as AlCl3 or Al(NO3)3. The absorption spectra of various QDs and their corresponding Eg values are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). With the same molar percentage of Al in the mixture of Al and Zn precursors, the (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs prepared by adding AlCl3 or Al(NO3)3 show similar absorption curves and almost the same absorption edge as (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs prepared by adding AlSt3. The results indicate that the anion added with the aluminum salt has little effect on the optical properties of the prepared QDs. Considering that AlCl3, Al(NO3)3 and AlSt3 play similar roles in QD synthesis, AlSt3 was selected as a representative Al precursor to prepare QDs in the following work.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization was used to reveal the effect of the content of Al in the (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs on the location of the band edge position.44,45 The UPS curves and the obtained energy level diagram of (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs with different molar percentages of Al along with TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. S2b–f and Fig. 2c. The results illustrate that the valence band (VB) edge of the Al incorporated QDs is obviously higher than that of pristine ZCISe, upshifting with the increase in the content of Al in QDs. Meanwhile, their corresponding conduction band (CB) edges are also slightly higher than that of pristine ZCISe. It is well known that the higher CB edge position is favorable for a quicker and more effective injection of photogenerated electrons from the CB of QDs to that of the TiO2 matrix in QDSCs.46,47
3.2 Photovoltaic performance
To effectively deposit QDs on mesoporous TiO2 films, the oil-soluble (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs synthesized was first converted to water-soluble QDs via ligand exchange method. The photoanodes were then prepared by anchoring QDs on the TiO2 films loaded on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates followed by coating a ZnS passivation layer. The sandwich-type QDSCs were finally fabricated by clipping the sensitized photoanode and Cu2S/brass counter electrodes, into which the polysulfide electrolyte was injected.
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of all QDSCs was carried out under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2, with the corresponding J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, respectively. The pristine ZCISe QD based QDSCs show a PCE value of 9.30% with Jsc of 26.04 mA cm−2, and the pristine ACISe QD based ones show a PCE value of 9.04% with Jsc of 25.76 mA cm−2. It should be noted that the simultaneous incorporation of Al and Zn in CISe QDs significantly affects the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs fabricated. A greatly improved PCE is obtained with an increase in the molar percentage of Al added to 50%, which is mainly derived from the improvement in Jsc. A champion PCE up to 10.27% with Jsc of 27.15 mA cm−2 was achieved on Al0.50Zn0.50-CISe QD based devices. Nevertheless, with a further increase in the Al amount added, a deteriorated photovoltaic performance was observed, which mainly results from the reduction of Jsc and Voc.

To illustrate the photovoltaic performance of devices constructed, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were plotted in Fig. 3b. As can be seen from the IPCE spectra, both ZCISe, ACISe, Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs based QDSCs show the photoresponse ranges extending over 1100 nm. The whole series of Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs and pristine ACISe based devices exhibit obviously higher IPCE values than ZCISe based devices in a wavelength greater than about 850 nm, which can be attributed to the higher absorbance of Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs and pristine ACISe QDs than pristine ZCISe QDs in this wavelength range as shown in Fig. 2a and 3c. The integrated Jsc values from IPCE spectra are shown in Table 2. The trend of the integrated Jsc is consistent with the trend of Jsc values obtained by J–V measurements. The integrated Jsc value of the Al0.50Zn0.50-CISe based device is highest among the values of the whole series of Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs based devices. The whole series of Al/Zn co-incorporated QDs show higher integrated Jsc than pristine ZCISe or ACISe based devices.
IPCE values are determined by light-harvesting, electron-injection, and charge-collection efficiencies.48–50 Compared with pristine ZCISe QDs, Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs and pristine ACISe QDs show narrower Eg and consequent wider photoresponse range. Meanwhile, their slightly higher CB edges are beneficial to the injection of photogenerated electrons from QDs to TiO2. Therefore, Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs are supposed to favor the light-harvesting and electron injection in QDSCs, which is demonstrated by the Jsc values. And the lower integrated Jsc of Al or Zn alone incorporated CISe QDs based devices should be ascribed to higher adverse charge recombination and the resulting lower charge collection efficiency.
3.3 Impedance spectroscopy characterization and open-circuit voltage decay
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was adopted to examine the dynamic information on charge recombination in QDSCs, with the results shown in Fig. 4a–c.51–54 The chemical capacitance (Cμ) and recombination resistance (Rrec) were extracted by fitting the EIS data obtained under various forward bias with an equivalent-circuit model shown in Fig. 4c. According to the similar Cμ values shown in Fig. 4a, the incorporation of Al or Zn into CISe QDs has no different effect on the position of the conduction band edge or the density of states of TiO2. However, the simultaneous incorporations of Al and Zn in QDs affect significantly the charge recombination between the photoanode/electrolyte interface in QDSCs, which can be reflected by the Rrec values. The greater the recombination resistance, the stronger the suppression of charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Within the entire applied bias range from −0.30 to −0.60 V, close to the Voc of QDSCs, Rrec values of the devices based on the whole series of Al/Zn co-incorporated QDs are higher than Rrec of the pristine ZCISe or ACISe QDs based device as shown in Fig. 4b. At a forward bias of −0.60 V, Al0.50Zn0.50-CISe based QDSCs exhibit the highest Rrec values among the whole series of Al/Zn co-incorporated QDs (Fig. 4c). The result demonstrates that adverse charge recombination in CISe based QDSCs can be effectively suppressed by the simultaneous introduction of Al and Zn into QDs. Compared with ZCISe based QDSCs, ACISe based QDSCs exhibit lower Rrec, indicating greater charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface in the ACISe based device. Adverse recombination results in low charge-collection efficiency and low Jsc for ACISe based QDSCs.

The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technique is also applied to provide information about the charge recombination process.52,54,55 The voltage decay signals for the QDSCs fabricated are shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). According to equation (τn = (kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, e is electronic charge), the electron lifetime (τn) was obtained from voltage decay rates and shown in Fig. 4d.
The whole series of Al and Zn simultaneously incorporated QD based devices show longer τn values than ZCISe or ACISe based QDSCs at the same voltages, demonstrating that Al/Zn co-incorporated QDs can effectively suppress the adverse recombination in the devices fabricated. Such a result is consistent with a variation tendency of Rrec values. The suppression of charge recombination might be attributed to the reduction of trap-state defects in CISe QDs by simultaneous introduction of Al and Zn, which can be further demonstrated by time-resolved PL decay measurement. As shown in Fig. S4b and Table S2 (ESI†), the Al0.50Zn0.50-CISe QD has the average PL lifetime of 295.20 ns, obviously longer than that of pristine ZCISe or ACISe QDs with the average lifetime of 174.72 or 97.00 ns, respectively. It can be concluded that Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs can effectively reduce the trap-state defects in CISe QDs. The reduction of trap-state defects in QD sensitizers could reduce both internal charge carrier recombination inside QDs (before carrier injection into the transporting media) and photoexcited electron recombination from TiO2 to QDs (after carrier injection), thus benefiting for carrier separation.
4. Conclusion
In summary, (Alx/Zn1−x)-CISe QDs with an average diameter of 2.8 nm were synthesized by adding Al and Zn precursors into the synthesis of conventional CISe QDs. The obtained QDs were deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films to fabricate QD sensitized photoanodes, applied further to the construction of QDSCs in combination with Cu2S/bass CEs and polysulfide electrolyte. Compared with Al or Zn alone incorporated CISe QDs, the unfavorable charge recombination in the constructed QDSCs is effectively suppressed by the incorporation of both metal ions into CISe QDs. The observed result can be ascribed to the reduction of the trap-state defects in QDs, as evidenced by a longer PL lifetime of Al/Zn co-incorporated CISe QDs than Al or Zn alone incorporated ones. An optimal photovoltaic performance, having a champion PCE up to 10.27% under a standard AM 1.5G sunlight illumination, can be observed on (Al0.50/Zn0.50)-CISe QD based QDSCs.
