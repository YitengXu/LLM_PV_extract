    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 29th June 2018AbstractThe formation of smooth, dense, and uniform perovskite layers on substrates is crucial for achieving high-performance perovskite devices. Here, we show that the introduction of a small concentration of cesium iodide to the precursor solution has a considerable effect on the morphology, phase and optoelectronic properties of CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite films. An optimized concentration of 3% produces a high-quality perovskite film with a large grain size of ∼1.8 μm and a root mean square roughness of 5.917 nm. The improved morphology and high optoelectronic quality of the perovskite layer were verified by SEM, AFM, XRD, and UV-visible, photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The defect-free thin perovskite layer enables the fabrication of a mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite device under ambient conditions, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of ∼19% with negligible hysteresis and high reproducibility. This method can be extended to other complexes of perovskite used in the present state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Thin-film photovoltaic (PV) devices are one of the best cost-efficient technologies employed to convert sunlight directly into electric power.1–4 In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the front-runner in thin-film PV devices due to their rapid increment in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost.5–7 Since the initial report by Miyasaka et al. in 2009,8 the PSCs have witnessed an enormous advancement with the maximum PCE reaching 22.1%.9 This high efficiency of perovskite devices can be attributed to their unique optoelectronic properties which include long diffusion length, tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, low carrier recombination and low exciton binding energy.10–14 Several configurations of PSCs, from the basic mesoporous structure previously used in dye-sensitized15,16 and quantum dot-sensitized17,18 solar cells to planar heterojunction structures comprising n–i–p and p–i–n architectures, have been employed to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite devices.19–23 However, the widely used and highly efficient PSCs comprise a perovskite active layer sandwiched between a hole-transporting material (HTM) such as spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) and an electron transporting material like TiO2.9,24 Interestingly, the perovskite layer was found to function not only as a sensitizer but also as an ambipolar charge-transporting layer by removing the HTM25 or employing an electronically inert Al2O3 scaffold.26,27
One of the major prerequisites for achieving high-performance and reproducible PSCs is to obtain uniform, smooth, pinhole-free and compact perovskite films with large crystalline grains.19,28–31 Perovskite layers with improved morphology and larger grain size are more desirable in achieving maximum light harvesting efficiency.32–34 A lot of effort has been put forward to develop some alternative synthesis routes to achieve high-quality perovskite films. The classical one-step spin coating technique owing to its simple operation, low-cost nature and low demand of equipment has taken the mainstream. However, this technique has failed to generate a flat perovskite layer with full and uniform coverage due to the difference in solubility of organic and inorganic components of perovskites in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).35 Several modifications of the one-step spin coating method such as anti-solvent deposition,23 solvent engineering,36–38 precursor modification24,39–41 and optimization of annealing conditions42,43 have been utilized to overcome the difficulty presented by the classical one-step deposition technique. To date, the best perovskite devices with leakage-free and uniform perovskite films have been fabricated using an anti-solvent based deposition technique.9,44
However, the poor thermal stability of perovskite films fabricated using a modified one-step spin coating technique has restricted the processing window in terms of temperature and time leading to small and irregularly packed perovskite grains of size ranging from ∼100–300 nm, containing several crystal imperfections in the form of grain boundaries and intragranular defects.23,33,45 Most of these defects create shallow electronic levels close to the band edges, which act as non-radiative recombination centers in perovskite layers and hence produce deleterious effects on the optoelectronic properties of the devices. Williams et al.46 demonstrated the importance of chloride in lead iodide-based perovskites for enhancing the crystal formation and improving the morphology of thin-film perovskite devices. Zhu et al.19 demonstrated the use of CH3NH3I-based post-treatment of perovskite films to obtain high-quality organolead triiodide perovskite grains. Recently, Yang et al.9 proposed the introduction of additional iodide ions into the organic cation solution to reduce the concentration of deep level defects giving a certified PCE of 22.1%. All these studies show the importance of the quality of perovskite films to achieve enhanced efficiency.
Finally, Saliba et al.24 reported the use of cesium iodide in a mixed-cation based perovskite to enhance its thermal stability and reduce the yellow phase of the formamidinium-based perovskite material. Also, Yang et al.47 prepared a (Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3)-based perovskite device with graphene-incorporated TiO2 to achieve a maximum efficiency of 15.4%. However, the significant drawback of both these reports is that the resultant perovskite film has a smaller grain size of ∼100–200 nm providing a large number of grain boundaries, thus hindering the use of relatively thick perovskite absorbers for enhanced absorption. Recently, we developed the air-extraction anti-solvent deposition (AAD) method to prepare high-quality perovskite films, which can deliver a good PCE.45 In this work, we for the first time demonstrate that by varying the concentration of cesium iodide (CsI) in CH3NH3PbI3 solution, the morphology and electronic quality of perovskite films can be modulated using the AAD process. The inclusion of a very low concentration of CsI leads to an increase in grain size up to ∼1.8 μm with smooth, compact and pin-hole free morphology. Further increase in the concentration leads to a poor quality of perovskite films with pin-holes and incomplete coverage. The optoelectronic quality of the perovskite films was verified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The introduction of 3% CsI facilitated the fabrication of PSCs with a maximum PCE of ∼19%, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest efficiency reported for cesium-containing CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskites under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). In addition, the cesium-containing device shows enhanced stability and reduced hysteresis.
Results and discussion
To facilitate CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as a light harvester, methylammonium iodide and lead iodide were added to a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (10:1 v/v) and stirred at 70 °C to prepare the perovskite solution. To modulate the morphology of the perovskite layer, CsI pre-dissolved as a 1 M stock solution in DMSO was introduced at 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10% into the perovskite solution. Furthermore, the AAD process45 was employed to deposit this perovskite solution on mesoporous TiO2 under ambient environmental conditions. The perovskite films thus obtained were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The detailed experimental procedure and characterization techniques can be found in the Experimental section.
Surface morphology of perovskite films
The inclusion of CsI was believed to alter the morphology of the obtained perovskite film during the AAD process. To examine the effect of CsI on the morphology of perovskite films, SEM and AFM measurements were taken. Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology and grain size distribution of perovskite films for different concentrations of CsI varying from 0 to 10%. A perovskite film with 0% CsI was uniform, pin-hole free and covers the entire substrate. Interestingly, the introduction of a small concentration of CsI results in the growth of the particle size with less grain boundaries. In addition to the increase in grain size, the perovskite grains get uniformly arranged with closer packing. As the content of CsI in the perovskite solution increases from 1% to 3%, the average perovskite grain size increases from ∼800 to ∼1800 nm. This clearly shows the uniform, regular and compact nature of perovskite grains with closely packed grain boundaries. However, the perovskite film starts getting non-uniform with the presence of pinholes at 5% of CsI, with a completely irregular film containing an enormous number of pinholes at 10%, see Fig. 1d and e, respectively. Perovskite films with larger grain sizes and no pinholes are crucial for reduced charge recombination leading to efficient transportation and collection of carriers across the perovskite crystals.32,48 Photovoltaic devices based on such high-quality films should have a higher fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to reduced carrier recombination and enhanced charge collection efficiency.49,50 Fig. S1 in the ESI† depicts the cross-sectional SEM images of a perovskite film at different concentrations of CsI. To avoid much complexity in measuring the thickness of the perovskite film, the mesoporous TiO2 was completely avoided. The thickness of the perovskite film was found to be similar in all the cases, thus neglecting its effect on the variation of absorption. Also, the variation in grain size for samples containing 1% to 10% of CsI was also verified from the cross-sectional image.

Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the AFM images and RMS analysis of a perovskite film with varying concentrations of CsI. The AFM images completely follow the trend shown by the SEM micrograph, with a gradual increment in grain size for a concentration varying from 1 to 3%. The irregular nature of the perovskite film containing 5% and 10% of CsI was also confirmed. The average RMS roughness values of perovskite films (a batch of 5 films for each concentration) with 0 to 10% of CsI were calculated to be 13.445 nm, 9.137 nm, 6.639 nm, 5.917 nm, 11.51%, 19.860 nm and 30.632 nm respectively, for an area of 2 μm × 2 μm (see Fig. 1f). The smoothness of the perovskite films was also verified by the 3D micrographs of the AFM images (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Based on the SEM and AFM characterization, the perovskite films with 3% of CsI having a grain size of ∼1800 nm and a RMS roughness of 5.917 nm were observed to have better morphological characteristics to produce a high-efficiency perovskite device.
Crystallinity and absorptivity of perovskite films

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD spectra of perovskite films with and without CsI. All the XRD measurements were taken at ∼298 K. The diffraction peak represents the cubic and tetragonal phases of the CH3NH3PbI3 film.51 Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the enlarged XRD of the 0% CsI sample. The CH3NH3PbI3 film consists of diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 20.03, 24.53, 28.4°, 31.9°, 40.71° and 43.24°, confirming the cubic structure of the pure perovskite phase at 0%, 1% and 3% CsI. These peaks correspond to the diffraction planes (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (220) and (300).16,52–54 The intensity of the (100) and (200) planes becomes stronger with the increase of the concentration of CsI, with the maximum intensity being obtained at 3% (see Fig. S5, ESI†) showing an improved crystalline nature. Further increase in the content of CsI leads to reduced intensity, indicating poor crystallinity of the film. The PbI2 peak at 12.7° is almost negligible in all the cases, indicating complete conversion of PbI2 into the perovskite form. In order to get a clear picture of the cubic–tetragonal transition, the enlarged XRD pattern at 2θ of 14.1° was considered (see Fig. 2(b)).51,54 The diffraction peak at (100) starts splitting into (002)/(110) for 5% and 10% of CsI. In order to further confirm the splitting, the enlarged XRD pattern at 2θ of 28.4° was obtained (see Fig. 2(c)), which clearly shows a peak splitting of (200) into (004)/(220) for the same concentration as mentioned before.51,54 In addition, with the increased concentration of CsI, the predominant peaks of the perovskite shift towards a higher angle. This higher angle shift corresponds to the reduction in the lattice parameter of the CH3NH3PbI3 unit cell induced by the partial substitution of MA+ with smaller Cs+ ions. Fig. 2(d) shows the UV-visible absorption of perovskite thin films fabricated using a precursor solution modified with different concentrations of CsI. Compared with the film without CsI, the absorbance of the perovskite films containing 1% and 3% CsI shows enhanced absorption. This increase in absorption can be attributed to the enhanced surface area of absorption, reduced scattering and higher crystallinity. However, for a higher concentration the absorption reduces due to the presence of pin-holes or incomplete coverage of the films. The diffraction results do not indicate any change in the crystal orientation as presented by Niu et al. for CsPbBr3-doped CH3NH3PbI3 films.55 Hence, the change in the morphology of the perovskite films is not related to the variation in crystal orientation, but is only dependent on the presence of doping species (Cs+) in the perovskite material.

Hence, in order to understand the influence of Cs in the perovskite film leading to the formation of larger perovskite grains, the FTIR spectra of the perovskite film just before annealing is measured and analyzed (see Fig. 3). The perovskite film comprises a MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct just before the annealing process which has been previously reported.44,45 This MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct indicates a stage before the conversion into perovskite (MAPbI3). The FTIR peak for the stretching vibration of SO in pure DMSO appears at ∼1045 cm−1.44 When MAI and PbI2 were equally mixed with the DMSO to form a 1:1:1 adduct, the stretching frequency of the SO group shifts from 1045 cm−1 to 1015 cm−1 as depicted in the FTIR spectra.44 This shift is in accordance with the O-bonded PbI2–DMSO complex and the Pb2+-bonded MAI–PbI2–DMSO complex. Comparing with the infrared spectra of MAI·PbI2·DMSO: 0% CsI, the sample with 3% CsI shows a new peak at ∼1108 cm−1, which is an indication of the formation of another coordination with the introduction of CsI. It is a known fact that the FTIR absorption peak in the range of 1120–1107 cm−1 corresponds to a sulfoxide group coordinating via the S with a lone pair.56,57 Hence, the new frequency of the stretching vibration observed at 1108 cm−1 can be attributed to the formation of a stronger bond of CsI with the SO via the S atom. So, it can be speculated that the MAI coordinates with Pb2+, PbI2 coordinates with DMSO via the O atom, and CsI coordinates with DMSO via the S atom forming an MAI·PbI2·DMSO·CsI adduct. The FTIR spectra of the MAI·PbI2·DMSO and MAI·PbI2·DMSO·CsI adduct films were measured after 15 min of storage in the ambient environment. The infrared spectrum of Cs containing the precursor film maintains the intense peak at 1015 cm−1, while the intensity of these peaks in the MAI·PbI2·DMSO based precursor film decreases significantly. Hence, it can be concluded that the presence of CsI helps in retarding the crystallization process of the perovskite from the precursor films. In order to further confirm the retardation in crystallization, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct film with and without CsI just after preparation and after 15 min of storage were recorded and are plotted in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct film with 0% CsI (after 15 min of storage) shows a prominent absorption edge at 750 nm, corresponding to the characteristic band-gap excitation of the crystallized CH3NH3PbI3 material. However, the MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct film with 3% CsI (after 15 min of storage) shows a weak absorption edge at 750 nm, indicating the retarded crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 material. This retarded crystallization leads to a slower rate of nucleation, indicating a stronger coordination of the precursor salts with DMSO. According to the classical theory of nucleation rate and crystal growth, (1)where Ms is the number of grains per unit area, N is the nucleation rate and G is the growth rate. The reduction of N leads to a reduction in Ms and an enhanced average size of the perovskite grains. Hence, according to eqn (1), the number of grains per unit area decreases resulting in a larger size of perovskite grains. A further increase in the concentration of CsI to more than 3% results in competition with MAI to react with the PbI2 distorting the α-phase (see Fig. 2) and the morphology of the perovskite (see Fig. 1).

Photovoltaic performance
The perovskite films were used to assemble the mesoscopic PSC with a configuration of glass/FTO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag. Fig. 4(a) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the complete device architecture. The optimized perovskite device comprises a 30 nm thick compact TiO2 layer, a 250 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer, a 270 nm thick perovskite capping layer, a 150 nm thick spiro-MeOTAD layer and a 60 nm Ag electrode. The grain boundaries were perpendicular to the substrates indicating that the charge carriers are transported along the perovskite with an intermediate encounter with the grain boundaries (see Fig. S7, ESI†). An increase in the grain size as observed for 3% CsI will reduce the density of the grain boundaries, leading to efficient charge carrier transport and improved performance (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The PV performance of the device was measured under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 in the ambient environment. The J–V curves of the best devices at different concentrations of CsI are shown in Fig. 4(b). 20 cells were fabricated and characterized for each set of conditions. The statistical analysis and average PV parameters of the respective devices are summarized in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and Table 1.

The perovskite device with 0% CsI provides the maximum photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.23% with a current density (Jsc) of 21.84 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.054 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.52. It can be observed that the introduction of CsI dramatically increases the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite device up to 3% after which the performance starts degrading. Although we could observe improvements in the cell performance even with a low concentration (1%) of CsI, the best results were obtained with 3% concentration of CsI, a PCE of 18.82% for a corresponding Jsc of 23.73 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.060 V, and a FF of 74.82%. The increase in Jsc was in good agreement with the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve shown in Fig. 4(c). The data presented in Fig. 4(b) and Table 1 showed that the higher the optoelectronic quality of the perovskite film, the better will be the PV performance. If the concentration of CsI is increased beyond 3%, the PV performance of the device starts degrading as displayed in Table 1. The average PCE follows a similar trend as the maximum PCE, with the reference perovskite device giving an average conversion efficiency of 15.11 ± 0.8%, and the CsI-based samples with 16.21 ± 0.7% for 1%, 17.46 ± 0.6% for 3%, 14.28 ± 0.7% for 5% and 10.98 ± 0.5% for 10% (see Table 1). The Jsc value increases with the increase in absorption, Voc increases with the increase in carrier generation and with reduction in the recombination process and the FF increases with the improved charge transfer and injection characteristics. Fig. 4d shows the integrated current density curve as a function of wavelength, estimated by integrating the product of the solar spectral curve with the measured IPCE obtained under low illumination. The integrated current density was calculated to be 19.81 mA cm−2 and 22.68 mA cm−2 for 0 and 3% of CsI respectively, and was lower than the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves in Fig. 4(b). This mismatch can be attributed to the reflection of light on the surface at lower illumination during the measurement of the IPCE, while the intensity of illumination for the measurement of J–V curves is considerably higher.
Optoelectronic characterization and hysteresis measurement
To gain insight into the quality of perovskite films, the steady-state PL was measured for the perovskite film deposited on glass substrates. Such measurements were carried out to determine the quality, charge extraction and transportation ability of perovskite films. Fig. 5(a) shows the PL spectra of perovskite films containing 0% and 3% CsI deposited on glass. The cesium-modified perovskite layer exhibited an enhanced PL intensity relative to the control layer at 490 nm excitation. The increment in the PL intensity can be correlated to the reduction in the number of deep level traps within the bulk or on the surface of the perovskite layer that promotes non-radiative relaxation. Fig. 5(b) depicts the PL spectra of the entire device with 0% and 3% of CsI, used to elucidate the charge extraction and transportation behavior. The former device (0% CsI) shows the enhanced PL intensity indicating serious recombination in the sample. However, PL quenching observed in the sample containing 3% CsI suggests less charge recombination and hence demonstrates more efficient charge injection and extraction characteristics.

J–V hysteresis behavior was studied for perovskite devices with 3% CsI and is shown in Fig. 6(a). A very small difference between the forward and reverse scans was observed indicating small hysteresis. The hysteresis index was calculated using the method reported by Park et al.58 and was found to be 0.019. The main reason for reduced hysteresis is the enlarged crystallite size and enhanced crystalline quality which reduces the bulk defect density, hence suppressing charge trapping during device operation.9,33,59 A PCE of 17.69% with a Jsc of 22.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.047 V and a FF of 74.52 was obtained for the reverse scan which closely matches the forward scan having a Jsc of 22.65 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.061 V and a FF of 74.52 giving an efficiency of 17.69%. EIS was used to understand the interfacial dynamics of perovskite devices without and with 3% of CsI. The Nyquist plot of the respective devices was generated at an open circuit voltage under light conditions and is shown in Fig. 6(b). It is fitted using an equivalent circuit given in the inset of the figure. The equivalent circuit model comprises a series resistance Rs which mainly depends on the FTO substrate and the external wire contact, Rct represents the charge transfer resistance of the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTM interfaces, and C is the capacitance. The fitted EIS data for the perovskite devices are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The only semicircle resolved from the EIS spectra (shown in Fig. 6(b)) represents the charge transfer behavior between the interfaces of the PSC. The intercept of the semicircle corresponds to the series resistance (Rs) which is similar for all the devices. It is clear that the device having 3% of CsI exhibits a lower value of Rct, when compared with the device without CsI. This is the reason for the high value of FF obtained for the perovskite device with 3% CsI when compared with the 0% CsI-based device.

Stability measurement
Despite the high PV efficiency provided by PSCs, the durability in terrestrial application still remains a major concern.60 To assess the stability of the fabricated PSC, it was monitored for a period of 10 days. The devices were left in the ambient environment at 27 °C and 30–40% humidity. The temporal evolution of the photovoltaic parameters is presented in Fig. 7. The PSC with 3% CsI shows an improved stability by retaining 75.59% of the primary efficiency compared to the cell having 0% CsI which retained only 39.97% of the initial efficiency. This improvement in stability can be related to the improved and defect-free morphology of the perovskite films obtained with cesium.

Conclusions
We for the first time reported the use of cesium iodide (CsI) in modulating the morphology of perovskite films by using the AAD method. The perovskite grain size increased from ∼800 nm to ∼1.8 μm with varying concentrations of CsI from 0 to 3%. However, a further increase in concentration degrades the perovskite layer with the evolution of several pinholes on the surface. In addition to the increase in grain size, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the methylammonium lead iodide film was tuned to achieve the smoothest surface morphology of 5.917 nm in mesoscopic perovskite devices. Also, a cubic to tetragonal transformation was observed in the perovskite phase with the inclusion of CsI. The carrier recombination and charge transfer resistance were reduced with the introduction of a small concentration of CsI contributing to the improved performance of the device. A maximum conversion efficiency of ∼19% was obtained with the introduction of 3% of CsI, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest efficiency reported for cesium-based CH3NH3PbI3 devices. In addition, these devices showed high reproducibility, negligible hysteresis and enhanced stability. This work provides a simple and effective way to control the grain size of the perovskite layer for improved performance.
Experimental section
Preparation of substrates
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (MTI-TEC 15) was etched with zinc powder and HCl diluted in deionized water to form a desired pattern. The patterned substrate was cleaned with detergent and distilled water followed by sonication with ethanol and ethanol–acetone (50:50) for 15 min. After rinsing with deionized water and absolute ethanol, the substrates were further treated with UV ozone for 30 min. Then, 30 nm of the TiO2 compact layer was deposited on FTO by spray pyrolysis at 500 °C from a precursor solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and acetylacetone (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous ethanol. After spraying, the substrates were left to cool down to room temperature and were further placed in an oven at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating for 10 s at 2000 rpm with a ramp of 500 rpm using a 20 nm particle paste (Dyesol 18 NR-T) diluted in anhydrous ethanol to obtain a 200–250 nm thick layer. After the spin coating, the substrates were dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min in an oven. Lithium doping of mesoporous TiO2 was accomplished by spin coating a 0.2 M solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 10 s followed by another sintering step at 450 °C for 30 min.
Preparation of perovskite precursors with CsI
0.2148 g of CH3NH3I (Dyesol), 0.623 g of PbI2 (99.99%, Lumtec) and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (>99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 1 ml of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 70 °C by stirring continuously for 1 hour to prepare the perovskite solution. Then CsI, pre-dissolved as a 1 M stock solution in DMSO, was added to the perovskite precursor at different concentrations.
The growth of CH3NH3PbI3 films via the AAD method
To prepare the perovskite film, 100 μl of the perovskite solution was spin coated on mesoporous TiO2 at 5000 rpm for 40 s. During the spin coating process, 1 ml of ethoxyethane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dropped instantaneously at the center of the substrate. The whole process was executed under the intake of an air-extractor hood whose operation started a few seconds before the start of the spin coating process and was kept on until the end of the deposition process.45 A dark brown perovskite film obtained was transferred to a hotplate for annealing at 100 °C for 10 min forming an almost dark perovskite film.
Assembly of perovskite solar cells
After the perovskite annealing, the substrates were left for cooling down and a spiro-OMeTAD (1-Material) solution in chlorobenzene was spin coated at 3500 rpm for 30 s with a ramp of 2000 rpm. The spiro-OMeTAD solution in 1 ml of chlorobenzene is composed of 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich), 17.5 μl bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) from a 520 mg ml−1 solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and 5 μl of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Lumtec) from a 300 mg ml−1 solution of FK209 salt in acetonitrile.
Finally, a 70 nm thick silver top electrode was evaporated using a thermal evaporator in a vacuum of 10−6 Torr and at an evaporation rate of 0.05 nm s−1 to form the complete device. The entire process was carried out under ambient conditions.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-7800F microscope at an energy range of 1–5 keV and an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer equipped with an EDAX detector. The roughness profile of the perovskite films was obtained using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Solver P47H-PRO, NT-MDT, Russia). The crystallinity studies were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation. The absorption spectra were recorded by diffuse reflection in the range from 400 to 900 nm using an Agilent Cary series UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) and a 60 mm integrating sphere. Current density (J–V) curves were measured using a Reference 600 Gamry potentiostat scanning from 0 to 1 V at the rate of 100 mV s−1. The samples were illuminated using an Oriel Sol3A simulator for measuring the current from the device. The intensity of light was adjusted using a KG-2 filter against an NREL calibrated Si-solar cell to obtain one-sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Newport monochromator model 74125. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the OHP films were recorded using an ACTON SpectraPro 2300i and a photomultiplier tube. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at open circuit voltage at frequencies from 100 MHz to 0.1 Hz under simulated light conditions. The EIS measurements were fitted using Zview software.
