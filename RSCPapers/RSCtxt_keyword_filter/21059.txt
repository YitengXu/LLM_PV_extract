    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 31st May 2016AbstractThin plastic film-based CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells were fabricated at low process temperature using a bilayer comprising an amorphous SnOx and mesoporous brookite TiO2 as electron collectors. Void-less high quality heterojunction structures achieve hysteresis-less photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency as high as 13.4% and mechanical stability against cyclic bending.
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3),1–7 due to their excellent light-harvesting property, show a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20% in solar cells,4,5 after the pioneering work in liquid-state1,6 and solid-state2,7 solar cells. Their advantages of solution-processability and cost-effectivity make them suitable for high throughput manufacture of large area solar cells.
Implementing mechanically robust photovoltaic cells on light-weight, flexible plastic substrates, which allows cost reduction by roll-to-roll high throughput production, holds great importance in industrialization. Lightweight power devices find versatile applications in wearable and portable electronics.8–15 To form perovskite solar cells on plastic film substrates, the whole fabrication process needs to be carried out at low temperature (<150 °C) in order to prevent plastic substrates from deformation/damage. For this purpose, low temperature preparation and processing of all materials that constitute layered carrier transfer structures are essential. Although organic electron transporters such as fullerene derivatives8,9 can be processed at low temperature, use of inexpensive and heat-resistant metal oxides is promising for ensuring stability and mechanical durability. Thin layers of metal oxides can be coated at low temperature either by vacuum deposition methods or by sinter-less solution processes. The former method, however, needs long process time and is not suitable for large area coating and printing. To date, selected metal oxide materials such as TiO2 (anatase10,11 and amorphous12), ZnO13,14 and Zn2SnO415 have been explored for sinter-less coating methods to fabricate flexible plastic solar cells. Especially, a high PCE of around 15% was recently achieved with a solution-processed ZnO collector.14 ZnO has been extensively employed as a current-rectifying semiconductor in electronic devices. Despite its good conductivity, it is chemically unstable and undergoes redox reactions when in contact with liquid solutions. CH3NH3PbI3 was found to degrade on ZnO in the solution coating process of precursors.16–18 TiO2 is a more stable metal oxide and its crystalline film is desired to be prepared by a sinter-less solution process. A thin TiO2 film layer has been prepared by vacuum processes such as ALD,11 which are however not suitable for high speed manufacturing of plastic film devices. Another subject in low temperature preparation is to ensure physically robust interfaces at heterojunctions of perovskite and carrier collectors. Poor adhesion of layers and defect-rich interfaces leads not only to reduced conversion efficiency but also to enhanced hysteresis in current–voltage (I–V) characteristics. As metal oxides prepared by sinter-less solution processes, TiO2 and Zn2SnO4 tend to exhibit significant hysteresis in their I–V curves.12,15 One of the main reasons for the appearance of hysteresis is low interfacial adhesion between metal oxide and perovskite.14,19–22 For low temperature processed plastic cells, it is essential to intensify layer-to-layer adhesion that enables high performance by minimising the hysteretic performance.
A meso-crystalline layer of brookite TiO2 can be prepared from a binder-free paste/suspension at low temperature (<150 °C) and it works as an excellent electron collector for perovskite solar cells.23,24 Here, dehydration condensation reaction of hydroxyl groups on a highly crystalline brookite surface results in strong inter-particle necking at low temperature.23–25 The mesoporous brookite (mp-brookite) layer exhibited higher electron collection ability than the conventional anatase TiO2 mesoporous layer sintered at 500 °C.23 Furthermore, brookite TiO2 serves as a good scaffold for the formation of a perovskite layer that has high crystallinity and uniformity.23,24
Here, we report the first trial to employ the brookite TiO2 collector in the fabrication of plastic film-based flexible CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cells. The mp-brookite layer was hybridized with an amorphous tin oxide layer by the solution process to form an electron-collecting (hole-blocking) bilayer on the surface of an indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene naphthalate (ITO-PEN) film. The plastic perovskite solar cells, fabricated entirely at a temperature below 150 °C, exhibit current–voltage performance free of hysteresis with a PCE as high as 13.4%. The flexible film cells demonstrated good mechanical stability against repeated bending up to 100 times at a curvature of 0.67 cm−1.
The surface of the ITO-PEN plastic film (200 μm in thickness) was coated with a tin oxide compact layer (∼40 nm) by spin-coating 1-butanol solution of SnCl2·2H2O and drying it at 150 °C for 4 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was done on the tin oxide layers formed on ITO glass substrates. When we sintered the as-prepared tin oxide layer at 500 °C, peaks appeared at 26.6°, 34.0°, 38.0° and 52.0° (Fig. 1a), which are identified as the diffraction patterns of crystalline SnO2 (ICDD 01-070-6153). However, when the substrate was processed at 150 °C, these characteristic phase peaks were absent. This confirms that the tin oxide layer processed at 150 °C exists as a partially oxidized amorphous state (SnOx). Fig. 1b shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the surface of the SnOx compact layer formed on ITO-PEN. A plain and uniform SnOx layer exhibits no voids and pinholes.

A binder-free brookite slurry (3.5 wt% TiO2 in ethylene glycol monopropyl ether) was prepared by solvent replacement of brookite aqueous sol (PECC-B01, Peccell Technologies, Inc, particle size 10–20 nm). It was then spin-coated on the SnOx layer, which had been processed at 150 °C for 1 h, and further dried at 150 °C for 3 h to form a metal oxide bilayer of SnOx/brookite. We have characterized the brookite nanoparticles using X-ray diffraction measurement23 (Fig. 1c). The brookite nanoparticle layer shows peaks at 2θ = 25.4°, 30.8°, 36.3°, 37.5°, 40.2°, 42.3°, 46.1°, 48.0° and 49.2° which correspond to the diffraction pattern of the brookite phase (ICDD 29-1360). SEM images show that the average diameter of brookite nanoparticles is 18.4 ± 6.3 nm (Fig. 1d). The diameter of mesopores in the brookite layer is ∼9 nm as we previously estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method.24 The CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer was formed by spin-coating the precursor solution containing CH3NH3I (2.7 M) and PbCl2 (0.9 M) in N,N-dimethylformamide and annealing at 105 °C for 90 min. Absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer formed on ITO-PEN/SnOx (without brookite) and ITO-PEN/SnOx/mp-brookite substrates are compared in Fig. 2a. From the difference in absorption by the films before and after deposition of the perovskite layer (in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm), we estimated the loading amount of perovskite. Amounts of the perovskite layers loaded on the bare SnOx compact layer and on the SnOx–brookite bilayer showed a difference less than 5%, indicating an equivalent amount of the absorber on these substrates. XRD patterns of the perovskite layer formed on ITO-PEN/SnOx and ITO-PEN/SnOx/mp-brookite are shown in Fig. 2b. In addition to background diffraction peaks of ITO, two sharp peaks at 14.2° and 28.5° indicate diffraction at (110) and (220) planes of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.26 From the peak at 14.2°, using the Scherrer equation,27 crystal domain sizes of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite formed on ITO-PEN/SnOx and ITO-PEN/SnOx/mp-brookite were estimated to be 84.6 nm and 73.1 nm, respectively. The SEM morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer shows larger grains of perovskite and a much higher surface coverage on brookite rather than on the SnOx compact layer (Fig. 2c and d). Atomic force microscopy analysis shows that the root mean square surface roughness (Rms) of the perovskite layer on the brookite layer was 77.5 nm, while the perovskite on the SnOx layer gave a rougher surface with Rms of 117.1 nm. Because the amounts of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx are similar, the result corroborates the mp-brookite that works not only as an electron collector but also as an effective scaffold to improve the uniformity of the perovskite layer with high coverage and minimal voids. Low coverage of the perovskite layer on amorphous SnOx is assumed to be due to the smooth surface, compared to porous SnO2, which lacks serving as a good scaffold to hold the perovskite crystal. We consider that the hydrophilic and surface active nature of the brookite crystal23,24 increased the chemical affinity and adsorption of perovskite (methylammonium and lead iodide) causing uniform crystalline growth, which leads to improvement in photovoltaic performance.28

The hole transport layer was prepared by spin coating of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) followed by overnight aging. Au was vapor-deposited on the top as a counter electrode. A cross-sectional image of the plastic perovskite solar cell with an mp-brookite layer is shown in Fig. 3a. The average thickness of the tin oxide hole-blocking layer, the mp-brookite TiO2 layer, the perovskite capping layer and the spiro-OMeTAD layer were ∼40 nm, ∼100 nm, ∼300 nm and ∼300 nm, respectively.

The best solar cell using the bilayer of amorphous tin oxide and mp-brookite exhibited a PCE as high as 13.4% with a hysteresis-less J–V curve (Fig. 3b), which is characteristic of brookite-based solar cells with larger grains of perovskite (less grain boundaries) and good adhesion of perovskite compared to anatase.23,24 Even though there is a large optical loss at wavelengths below 450 nm due to intrinsic absorption by the polymer PEN film, IPCE values as high as 70–80% were obtained in the spectral sensitivity range (Fig. 3c). The open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the cells was relatively high, reaching 1.03 V. The energy band diagram (Fig. S1, ESI†) shows that the conduction band level of SnOx can be slightly more negative than the conduction band level of brookite. This implies that tunneling of exited electron through the thin SnOx layer to ITO contributes to rectified electron transport. In contrast, solar cells using only SnOx as an electron collection layer turned out to show poor performance with very low VOC (0.6–0.7 V) and fill factor (FF) (0.3–0.5). Although a SnO2 crystal layer prepared at 180 °C from the same precursor (SnCl2·2H2O) exhibits excellent electron collection performance,29,30 the present amorphous SnOx layer, which was prepared at lower temperature (150 °C) to avoid deformation of the ITO-PEN film, lacks the ability to rectify electron collection due to low crystallinity and causes recombination at the SnOx-perovskite interface. On the other hand, mp-brookite-bearing cells but missing the SnOx compact layer tended to undergo short circuit. In this case, the porosity of brookite allows electrical contact between perovskite and the conductive ITO layer and results in short circuit. However, high performance was achieved with the structure bearing the bilayer of SnOx and mp-brookite, both of which could be prepared by low temperature coating. Since an ohmic contact between ITO and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD layers causes rapid recombination in solid-state solar cells, the compact layer is necessary to passivate the ITO surface.31 The other noteworthy finding is that hysteresis is significantly minimised in the J–V curve of SnOx/brookite-based cell. This can be attributed to the large crystal size (less grain boundary, which is one of the causes for hysteresis32) of perovskite on the brookite layer and continuous, void-less hetero-junction interfaces of ITO/SnOx/brookite/perovskite, in which the surface and crystalline properties of brookite23,24 that bridges SnOx and perovskite play an essential role as we have reported before.23
To examine the mechanical stability of the flexible solar cell, we carried out a bending durability test. A sample of a perovskite film solar cell that shows minimal hysteresis was subjected to repeated bending by rolling on a cylinder with a small radius of 1.5 cm (curvature value of 0.67 cm−1). Fig. 4 shows the result monitored for a sample cell (PCE ∼11%). The photovoltaic characteristic was maintained during the cycle of bending without much deterioration. Mechanical bending gave rise to an increase in the hysteresis of J–V curves. This change is assumed to reflect physical damage (peeling, etc.) at interfaces. Despite hysteresis behaviour, a PCE of over 10% was maintained without loss after 100 cycles of bending (Fig. 4).

Forward (−0.1 V → 1.1 V) and backward (1.1 V → −0.1 V) scans are indicated as solid and dotted lines, respectively.

In conclusion, we fabricated film-type flexible CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells via a low-temperature solution process employing brookite TiO2 as an electron collector for the first time. Brookite was found to work as an excellent electron collector in the bilayer form with an amorphous SnOx compact layer and also serves as an effective scaffold for formation of a highly crystalline and uniform CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer. The flexible solar cells built on plastic ITO-PEN film substrates exhibit a PCE as high as 13.4% and hysteresis-less performance in J–V curves. The flexible film cells also show mechanical robustness against repeated bending up to 100 cycles.
