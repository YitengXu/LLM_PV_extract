However, fabrication of high-quality mixed cation-halide perovskite films is still challenging due to the formation of point defects in the annealing process, resulting in a large loss in the potential of solar cells. In this work, formamidine acetate, as an additive, is introduced into the perovskite-precursor solution to overcome this issue. The prolonged time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime indicates fewer defects in the optimized perovskite film with formamidine acetate than those in the control sample. The solar cells using the optimized perovskite layer achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 21.9% with a large open-circuit voltage of 1.19 V. For another perovskite film with a low band gap (1.53 eV), the optimized device also shows a large open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Our work provides a new strategy to realize the commercial applications of perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have a typical structure with the chemical formula ABX3, commonly composed of a monovalent cation A (methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), Cs+, and Rb+),1–4 a divalent cation B (Pb2+ and Sn2+)5 and a halide anion X (I−, Br−, and Cl−).6,7 These mixed cation-halide perovskites have recently attracted tremendous research interest in the photovoltaic (PV) field8–11 due to their extraordinary properties, such as high light absorption in the visible range,12 a long carrier diffusion length,13–15 low exciton binding energy,16 and a tunable bandgap from 1.3 to 2.3 eV by substituting the cations and/or anions partially,17–20etc. The perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved >20% power conversion efficiency (PCE) using these mixed cation-halide perovskite films, particularly a record PCE of 22.1% by using an FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 PV layer.21 Considering the reflection loss from a glass/transparent conductive oxide (TCO) interface, the current density almost reaches its maximum value, while there is still considerable space for open-circuit voltage (VOC) increase in these solar cells.22 The so-far-reported lowest potential loss is 0.38 V for the passivated emitter and rear silicon solar cells with 1.1 eV bandgap; however, the potential loss is rarely reported below 0.4 V for high-efficiency PSCs over a variety of compositions.21,23,24 We reason that the potential loss in PSCs should be lower than 0.4 V when the defects in the perovskite layer are significantly passivated. The defects in the polycrystalline perovskite film include bulk and surface defects and the latter predominates the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in most cases.
During the crystallization process, annealing is a necessary step for perovskite formation and growth. Driven by heat, part of the organic component in the mixed-cation perovskite could escape away from the thin film during the annealing process in the form of methylammonium iodide (MAI), leaving a considerable amount of point defects at the surface. These point defects may lead to complex surface relaxation and reconstruction, resulting in a defect-active area.25,26 Defect suppression at the surface has the potential to improve the overall performance of PSCs, especially the VOC increase.27–29
Here we put forward an additive-engineering strategy to improve the performance of mixed-cation PSCs by introducing formamidine acetate (FAAc) to the perovskite-precursor solution. We propose a synergetic mechanism for the effect of FAAc on suppressing the surface defects. During the annealing process, FAAc tends to react with methylammonium iodide (MAI) to form formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium acetate (MAAc); meanwhile, MA+ cations could volatilize preferentially in the form of MAAc instead of MAI, owing to a much lower thermal stability of MAAc. Therefore, the number of I− vacancies is reduced at the surface, leading to a reduced recombination rate in the resulting film. Correspondingly, the device efficiency has increased from 20.4% to 21.9% by using this new strategy. The progress mainly comes from the remarkable enhancement of VOC from 1.13 V to 1.19 V. The VOC of 1.19 V is pretty close to the world record for this composition ever reported.30 We also applied this technique to low-bandgap PSCs, and the VOC is increased from 1.09 V to 1.14 V with a 0.39 V potential loss. Besides, not only the long-term PCE stability but also anti-moisture phase stability has been enhanced for the optimized perovskites due to the high crystal quality. The high reproducibility of this method practically provides a strategy for the industrialization of PSCs.
The experimental setup and procedures are shown in Fig. 1a. First, we prepared a pure perovskite precursor (with a composition of Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45) and FAAc additive solution, respectively. To enhance the solubility of FAAc in the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent, we heated the solution and added the hot solution to the precursor at a fixed ratio directly. To investigate the effect of the FAAc additive on the quality of the polycrystalline perovskite film, we fabricated four batches of perovskite films by using different volume ratios of FAAc solution to the perovskite precursor solution (0/4/8/16 vol%). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†) reveal the typical diffraction peaks of the perovskite for all the samples at ∼14.3°, 20.2°, 24.7°, 28.6° and 32.0°, which are assigned to the (110), (200), (202), (220) and (310) planes, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the perovskite films (or solar cell devices) with and without the FAAc additive indicate full coverage of the perovskite layers on the substrates in the absence of pin-holes, which is necessary for achieving high-performance devices. All these results demonstrate that there is no obvious change in the crystal morphology in the presence of the FAAc additive. We further examined the carrier lifetime in these samples via time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization (Fig. 1b). The sample with 8 vol% ratio of FAAc has a much longer carrier lifetime (t = 252 ns) compared with the control sample (t = 170 ns). A longer lifetime means fewer recombination centers in the films. It can be concluded that the FAAc additive is favorable for reduction of the defects, which are always considered as the non-radiative recombination centers in the PSC field.

In order to explore the effect of the FAAc additive on the PV performance of planar PSCs, we prepared devices with different concentrations of the FAAc additive. The measuring results are summarized in Fig. 2a and Table 1. The PV performance has an obvious increase with the help of the FAAc additive (Fig. 2a), showing a tremendous enhancement of VOC. From Fig. 2b, the best average value of VOC has exceeded 1.18 V while for the control one it is only around 1.13 V. The content at 8 vol% gives the optimal performance, consistent with the results of TRPL measurements. Distributions of VOC among 130 devices in total with different contents of the FAAc additive are shown in Fig. S3, ESI,† and the content of 8 vol% gives the largest VOC and a rather narrow distribution. Based upon these optimized conditions, batches of PSCs were fabricated. Fig. 2c presents the statistical PCE of 32 devices in total. As a result, not only the performance of PCE but also the reproducibility of device fabrication has been greatly improved. The champion device showed a PCE of 21.9%, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.23 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.42%, and the VOC had a significant increase of up to 1.19 V (Fig. 2d). To our knowledge, the VOC of 1.19 V is quite close to the world record of PSCs with such composition.30 A steady power output with a conversion efficiency of 20% was obtained. The typical external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a device is demonstrated in Fig. 2e. The EQE value reaches about 90% in the whole visible region. The integrated JSC (22.5 mA cm−2) matches well with the J–V results (23.1 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the hysteresis of J–V curves has been partially suppressed (Fig. S4, ESI†).

In addition, we applied this FAAc additive to low-bandgap PSCs with a different composition of Cs0.05FA0.84MA0.11PbI2.80Br0.20. In this situation, less Br was employed to narrow the bandgap. It turns out that the FAAc additive still works very well. From Fig. S5 (ESI†), the VOC had a relatively huge increase from 1.09 V to 1.14 V. Thus, the method of the FAAc additive is effective and universal, which could be easily extended to other hybrid PSC systems with different compositions, thanks to its universality.
To find out which ingredients in FAAc make contributions to the enhancement of device performance, we did several control experiments. Using the same method, we put other two additives in the perovskite colloidal solution: FAI solution (dissolved in DMF/DMSO) and DMF/DMSO mixed solvent without any solute. With these two additives, both the VOC and PCE did not change evidently (Fig. 2f) and it is powerfully proved that the most progress of VOC and PCE is profited from Ac− anions, rather than FA+ cations or another extra solvent.
During the annealing process, the organic component of MAI could escape from the perovskite films considering its low melting temperature (270–280 °C).31,32 This character of MAI tends to result in a large quantity of I− vacancies in the perovskite film, especially at the grain boundaries.25,27,33,34 These point defects, which were recently shown to have high affinity to water and oxygen molecules,35–37 can facilitate the decomposition of perovskite crystals in ambient air. Additionally, the vacancy-related defects are potential SRH traps within the energy bandgap of perovskites, causing a reduced carrier lifetime that relates to a shorter diffusion length. Here we summarize that engineering defect densities could be a valid tool to realize ambient-air-tolerant and high-performance PSCs.
Based on the discussion and experiments above, we propose a synergetic mechanism of perovskite growth with the FAAc additive (Fig. 3a). Compared to the pure perovskite precursor, the modified precursor includes FAAc molecules. In the existence of FAAc molecules with a high melting point (165 °C) compared to MAAc (Fig. 3b), a replacement reaction could occur in the form of Ac− + MA+ → MAAc↑. This reaction could protect I− anions from escaping away from the perovskite matrix during the following annealing process. In consequence, iodide vacancies related to trap states are greatly suppressed. As evidenced by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests in Fig. 3b, MAAc begins to volatilize at around 60 °C. According to the curve of dW/dT, an obvious decomposition of MAAc happened in the heating process from room temperature to 200 °C. In contrast, organic FAAc shows much better thermal stability with a simple direct phase transition, validated by the sharpness of the TGA curve step. Precisely because the melting (or decomposition) points of MAAc and MAI are far from each other, MA+ cations would volatilize preferentially with Ac− anions, instead of I− anions. Hence, fewer I− vacancies were residual after annealing.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic illustration of the working mechanism for perovskite thin film growth via the FAAc additive. (b) Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests of organic FAAc and MAAc. 
To further verify our hypothesis, we fabricated devices utilizing the same manner except for using MAAc as the Ac− source supplier. The J–V results show no distinction between samples with and without the MAAc additive (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The reason why MAAc has no effect is easy to understand. When doping Ac− anions in the precursor solution, an excessive amount of MA+ cations is brought into the system equivalently. Ac− anions prefer to escape together with the MA+ cations from the MAAc additive. As a consequence, there is no more extra Ac− anion remaining in the thin film to combine with MA+ cations from the precursor (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Therefore, I− anions would escape away combined with the MA+ cations from the precursor. This result highlights the importance of cation selection to realize the above synergetic mechanism for high-performance PSCs.
Both the long-term PCE stability and anti-moisture phase stability are correlated closely with the crystal quality of perovskite films. We kept the cells in the atmosphere without encapsulation and tested the device PCE every 15 hours. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the PCE stability has a significant improvement by FAAc addition and the efficiency was maintained at above 95% of its initial value after more than 300 hours. In strong contrast, the PCE of the control device decreased seriously by over 50% during the same time period. The anti-moisture phase stability has also been improved enormously as shown in Fig. 4b. At first, all the fresh perovskite films looked the same with a black, shiny and homogeneous appearance. After 3 hours of exposure to high humidity air (RH: ∼60%), the devices became completely different. The control cells showed a serious decomposition of the perovskite phase. Meanwhile, cells with the FAAc additive still remained black, shiny and homogeneous. We attribute the progress of stability to the improved quality of perovskite crystals by FAAc addition.

To further prove the fewer defects on the modified perovskite active layer, we did an Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) test. IS is a well-established and widely used technique for perovskite solar cells. The density of defect states can be derived from the angular-frequency-dependent capacitance using the following equation:Nt(ω) = ((Vbi − Vapp)/qWkT)(dC/dω)ωwhere Vbi, W, and Vapp represent the built-in voltage, the width of the space charge region, and the applied voltage, respectively. The frequency ω can be converted into the energy level of defects (Ea) using the following expression:ω = AT2exp(−Ea/kT)
Finally, the defect state distribution can be obtained (Fig. 5). From this we could easily conclude that with the help of the FAAc additive, the density of defect states greatly decreased. At the same time the deep level defects were suppressed obviously. Thus, the FAAc additive is useful for reducing the defects of the perovskite layer.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the performance of PSCs is significantly improved by an additive-engineering strategy. An optimized ratio of the FAAc additive is beneficial to the growth of high-quality perovskite crystals. I− anions could be stabilized by exotic Ac− anions, evidenced by the TRPL and TGA results. A significant enhancement in PCE was achieved with the best device PCE of 21.9%, owing to the great improvement of VOC. The champion device has a VOC of 1.19 V, almost the highest VOC ever reported for Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 PSCs. More importantly, this simple method is also effective for other hybrid PSC systems with different material compositions. A general increase of 50 mV was realized in two material composition PSCs. Moreover, the high reproducibility of this technique is very friendly to industrial production. Thus, this strategy can be expected to pave the way for the commercial applications of PSCs.
