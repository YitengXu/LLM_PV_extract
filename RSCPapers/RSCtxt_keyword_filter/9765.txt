    , Accepted 10th December 2015First published on 11th December 2015AbstractThe control on the charge transport properties of ternary organic photovoltaic P3HT:PCBM:QBT devices is enabled by modulating the distribution of P3HT polymorphs in the device photoactive layers. Negligible amounts of QBT induce striking modifications in the P3HT lamellar stacking direction, forming both densely packed and non-densely packed P3HT chains. The former reduce the charge carrier recombination rate, enabling an increased fill factor and short-circuit device photocurrent.
Solution-processable organic semiconductors based on π-conjugated polymers and small molecules are promising materials for the next generation of light sensing1 and power-generating semiconductor devices.2 Low-cost plastic solar cells and photodetectors can be easily fabricated by high throughput wet-deposition techniques.3 The ability to fabricate devices in this way, combined with potential low cost of organic semiconductor materials, offers the promise of ultra-low cost light harvesting devices, e.g. solar cells. The photoactive layer of a typical organic solar cell is composed of a binary system of a π-conjugated polymer blended with a small organic molecular acceptor.4 Light is predominately absorbed in the polymer, which generates a charge neutral exciton with binding energy exceeding that of kBT.5,6 The splitting of the exciton into positive and negative polarons capable of charge conduction takes place at the donor/acceptor interface. After the exciton has been split, the polarons drift and diffuse to the contacts, facilitated by a network of the donor and acceptor phases in the blend. The overall process of photocurrent generation crucially relies on the microscopic and mesoscopic length scale organization of the donor and acceptor materials.7 The formation of an optimum microstructure is key to minimizing recombination rates, optimizing charge generation rates and maximizing charge carrier mobility. Throughout the deposition of the solution, the solvent rapidly evaporates leaving a solidified film on the substrate. During solvent evaporation, both molecular components of the blend tend to reach the lowest free energy configuration giving rise to a non-equilibrium state in which the binary mixture is kinetically trapped. Depending on the glass transition temperature and the chemical structure of the matrix, a distribution of crystalline domains is formed either in the supercooled state of the amorphous polymeric fraction or in the kinetically entrapped glassy state of the composite. The exact balance between the crystalline and the amorphous polymer fractions that are obtained is dictated by kinetic factors, i.e. by the relative magnitude of the rate of crystallization vs. the rate of solvent evaporation.8 Further processing of the composite by post-treatment protocols can modify the structural properties of the layer such as the degree of crystallinity and the size of the crystallites.9 Many organic materials and their composites exhibit the effect of polymorphism; that is the appearance of multiple crystalline and/or amorphous structural motifs in their solid-state phase, depending on the exact processing and the confinement conditions of the system.10,11
During the last decade several low-temperature and solution-based methodologies have been developed for inexpensively optimizing the structure–property–function correlation in the active layers of organic electronic devices prepared by using binary composites.12 The concentration of the donor/acceptor interfaces can be controlled by varying the composite ratio13 or the solvent mixture14 and a fine demixing of the blend components can be achieved in a precise manner via thermal- and/or solvent-vapor annealing steps.15–18 The control on the nanostructure features of the organic composites enables the accurate tuning of the performance of the corresponding photoactive device. Within this context, further optimization of the device functionalities is achievable when volatile additives are used as morphology modifying agents which are able to affect the mesoscopic phase separation of the blend components.19–21 Alternatively, enrichment of the binary blend is possible with a third species that remains in the film after solvent evaporation and that facilitates the enhancement of photocurrent generation through an antenna effect that extends the absorption profile to lower photon energies, that would be otherwise unabsorbed.22–24 In many cases of ternary organic systems the third component has a multifunctional role that improves the layer morphology, increases the open-circuit voltage and aids light absorption, charge generation and charge transport.25–29
Despite the considerable progress in the field of ternary organic semiconductive composites,28,30–33 it remains still unclear if the use of a third component can actually affect the occurrence and nature of the polymorph distribution of the polymer matrix in ternary composites. An obvious example is the case of regioregular poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (rr-P3HT) which is commonly accepted as the archetypical organic semiconductor in the field of plastic electronics and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.4,34–36 It has been shown that the overall crystallinity of the rr-P3HT reduces as molecular weight values exceed 12.7 kDa.37,38 In the solid state, rr-P3HT forms a lamellar structure in which layers of parallel stacks of polymer backbones are separated by the hexyl side-chains, corresponding to the d100 spacing of rr-P3HT crystallites. For single-component P3HT film chains two distinct packing polymorphs can be obtained, which differ in terms of the extent of side-chain interdigitation or tilting; (i) a ‘dense packing’ motif where rr-P3HT layers are densely packed and the lamellar stacking distance is short;39 and (ii) a ‘less-dense’ packing motif where a larger lamellar stacking distance is observed.40 To this end the appearance of the two P3HT polymorphs has been observed in single-component rr-P3HT films.41 Moreover, some indications were presented recently suggesting the appearance of the densely packed P3HT polymorph in binary blend films of rr-P3HT mixed with [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as provided by grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies.42 Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the formation of the densely packed P3HT polymorphs correlates with the charge transport properties of the composite and with the performance of the corresponding solar cell device. Addressing this question is of paramount importance for the development of solution-based processing protocols that will be able to deliver next generation organic composites with well correlated structure–property–function relationships.
In this study, we demonstrate that the bimodal distribution of the two P3HT polymorphs in P3HT:PCBM blends depends on the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of the rr-P3HT batch used and that it can be tuned when a small molecular nucleation agent is employed as a third component in the P3HT:PCBM composite. Interestingly, the formation of the densely packed P3HT polymorph can be triggered when the third component is used in vanishing amounts and it can greatly affect the electrical properties of the corresponding solar cell devices. We show how the bimodal distribution of the two P3HT polymorphs in the binary P3HT:PCBM composite can be precisely tuned with the use of the nucleation agent 5,5′-bis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cycloexadien-1-ylidene)-5,5′-dihydro-2,2′-bithiophene (QBT).43 Ternary P3HT:PCBM:QBT composites are fabricated by keeping the P3HT:PCBM ratio fixed at 1:1 as the QBT content varies between 0–3 wt%. The relative content of the P3HT polymorphs is tuned simply by varying the loading of QBT in the ternary system. More importantly, an improvement in the charge transport properties is verified that links directly to the appearance of the densely packed rr-P3HT polymorph, when QBT loadings of 0.3–0.6 wt% content are used. The chemical structures of the materials studied are shown in Fig. 1a. Two sets of P3HT:PCBM:QBT films are used, where either a high Mn P3HT (Mn = 29.6 kDa), or a low Mn P3HT (Mn = 18.3 kDa) batch is employed. Care was taken so that the regioregularity of the two rr-P3HT derivatives was the same (rrhigh Mn = 95.7% and rrlow Mn = 95.2%). Both P3HT derivatives were purchased from Merck whereas PCBM was purchased from Solenne BV. In all cases the commercially available materials were used as purchased without further purification. GIWAXS characterization of films made by the P3HT:PCBM:QBT blends was performed for studying the effect of adding the QBT agent on the relative content of densely packed and non-densely packed P3HT polymorphs. Photodiode devices prepared by using the P3HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers with an active area of 0.0525 cm2 verify the positive impact on the structural reorganization of the P3HT in the presence of QBT; both photocurrent generation efficiency and charge transport properties are greatly affected when the densely packed polymorph appears in the devices of the high Mn rr-P3HT batch. Transient photovoltage (TPV) characterization experiments44 further inform that the addition of the QBT component results in reduced recombination of charges in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT films, in good agreement with the observed increase in the fill factor (FF) parameter of the QBT-containing photodiode devices. For all studied devices43 the ternary composite layers of P3HT:PCBM:QBT were deposited by spin-coating on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates and thermal annealing of these blend films was performed at 140 °C for 15 min. Under constant thermal annealing at this temperature, crystallization is kinetically favoured and the crystallization of the blend components starts to evolve.45 For the preparation of P3HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers with a specific QBT content, a P3HT:PCBM:QBT solution was prepared in two steps. All solutions prepared were in chlorobenzene. First a P3HT:PCBM solution with a P3HT:PCBM ratio of 1:1 was prepared at a P3HT concentration of 26 mg mL−1. Then a QBT solution of appropriate QBT concentration was prepared. In particular, different QBT solutions were prepared at a QBT concentration of 1.608 mg mL−1, 0.524 mg mL−1, 0.316 mg mL−1, and 0.156 mg mL−1. For obtaining 3 wt%, 1 wt%, 0.6 wt% and 0.3 wt% QBT content in the final P3HT:PCBM:QBT solution, 0.25 mL of the P3HT:PCBM solution and 0.25 mL of QBT solution were mixed, respectively.

The diffraction intensity monitored is extracted from the corresponding GIWAXS 2D images and it is in the qZ range between 0.30–0.56 Å−1 that covers the signal corresponding to the d100 spacing of rr-P3HT crystallites.40 From the existing single crystal X-ray diffraction data of QBT it is known that QBT reflections are not expected in this qZ range.46 Similarly no contribution is expected from the PCBM component which typically appears at higher qZ values (qZ ∼ 1.50 Å−1).47,48 The pertinent parameters (lamellar stacking distances and corresponding domain sizes) of the two P3HT polymorphs in all samples of both high and low Mn samples are reported in Table 1 in correlation with the QBT content used.

Prior to the addition of the QBT component, distinct differences are already found in the binary P3HT:PCBM composites of high and low Mn samples. For the high Mn P3HT:PCBM only the type of the non-densely packed P3HT polymorph is found, whereas both densely and non-densely packed P3HT polymorphs are found in the low Mn P3HT:PCBM composite. For the high Mn sample (Fig. 1c), a single diffraction peak is observed, centered at qZ = 0.39 Å−1 whereas for the low Mn sample (Fig. 1d) the GIWAXS diffraction pattern is a superposition of two peaks centered at qZ = 0.39 Å−1 and qZ = 0.41 Å−1. These peaks correspond to two different P3HT lamellar stacking distances of 16.2 Å and 14.9 Å, respectively, and they are in agreement with previous structural studies of P3HT-only films prepared by using a P3HT derivative of comparable molecular weight.41
The difference in the GIWAXS intensity of the high and low Mn samples suggests that the composite prepared by using the low Mn rr-P3HT is more crystalline. This is in good agreement with specular X-ray diffraction data (data not shown). Moreover, the difference in the crystallinity of the two systems is further confirmed by atomic force microscopy characterization imaging and UV-Vis absorption data recorded for these samples (see ESI†).49 Given the comparable regioregularity of both rr-P3HT batches used, we assume that the concentration of the well-ordered domains formed by P3HT chains in the 0 wt% QBT sample primarily depends on the molecular weight of the P3HT matrix.37,38 During thermal annealing, the mobility of the shorter P3HT chains is expected to be less confined and nucleation sites are formed without the need for external nucleation centers. As such the short P3HT chains crystallize at a higher rate leading to a high concentration of small, non-densely packed P3HT crystallites with a domain size of 15.2 nm. In contrast, the longer P3HT chains of the high Mn are less mobile and they crystallize at a lower rate forming a low concentration of large, non-densely packed P3HT crystallites with a domain size of 17.9 nm. We have previously shown how QBT serves as a nucleation agent for the long range organization of the amorphous long polymeric P3HT segments in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT blend.43 Currently our data verify that the addition of QBT component positively impacts only the composites prepared by high Mn P3HT matrices, most likely via the heterogeneous nucleation of the long P3HT chains.
Strikingly, the addition of QBT in the high Mn ternary composites induces the appearance of the densely packed rr-P3HT polymorph, indicating that the nucleation induced by QBT favors also the formation of P3HT crystallites of shorter lamellar spacing than the typical d100 spacing found in P3HT:PCBM blend films. By varying the QBT concentration between 0.3–3 wt% changes are observed in the relative scattering intensity and the width of the GIWAXS diffraction peaks suggesting that the addition of QBT modulates the bimodal distribution, and the domain size of the two P3HT polymorphs as well as and the overall crystallinity of the ternary P3HT:PCBM:QBT systems. In contrast, the addition of QBT has no effect on the crystallinity of samples of low Mn that are already crystalline due to the low Mn of the rr-P3HT used.
Interestingly, the change in the domain size of the two polymorphs in each set of samples is anti-correlated as the QBT content increases. A reduction is observed in the domain size of the non-densely packed P3HT polymorph as the size of the densely packed P3HT polymorph domain increases. For both high and low Mn samples, the difference between the size of the two polymorphs is maximized when the QBT content is 0.6–1 wt% with the dense polymorph being the largest. It is meaningful to note that we have observed the bimodal distribution of the P3HT polymorphs also when a QBT content of 3 wt% was used. However this QBT loading is irrelevant to device applications because it negatively affects the device properties of the P3HT:PCBM:QBT system due to an enhanced recombination of photogenerated charges.43
In order to understand the effect of the two co-existing P3HT polymorphs on the electrical properties of the photoactive devices based on the ternary P3HT:PCBM:QBT systems we performed charge transport measurements in unipolar devices (device structure glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM:QBT/Au) for deducing the dependence of the zero-field hole mobility of each system on the QBT content. The hole mobility was determined based on the Mott–Gurney equation (see ESI†), by taking into account the Poole–Frenkel effect.27

Fig. 2 presents the QBT composition dependent results of hole mobility values of the studied devices with P3HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers prepared by the high Mn rr-P3HT and low Mn rr-P3HT batches. Given the lower crystallinity of the high Mn samples, it is not surprising that the hole mobility of the corresponding devices is lower than that of devices of low Mn. Nonetheless, the addition of a small amount of QBT (i.e. 0.3 wt%) in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT composites of high Mn leads to an order of magnitude increase when the QBT loading is 0.6 wt%. By increasing the QBT content further the hole mobility also increases, suggesting that the addition of the QBT improves the π–π stacking distance of adjacent P3HT chains. At present we have no structural data of high quality available, for confirming the QBT-induced optimization of P3HT chain packing along the π–π stacking direction that corresponds to the d010 spacing of rr-P3HT crystallites. We can however suggest with caution that the QBT-induced enhancement of the crystallinity along the lamellar stacking direction (d100) could force the P3HT chains in a layer to come closer and to effectively reduce their π–π distance for facilitating charge transport. The recorded GIWAXS patterns of the ternary composites were obtained by scanning the edge-on oriented P3HT fraction of the ternary composites, nonetheless the QBT-induced improvement in the overall crystallinity of the P3HT domains has been previously confirmed.43 Unlike the case of high Mn devices, the hole mobility in the devices prepared by the low Mn P3HT blends is invariant to the increase of the QBT content suggesting that the addition of QBT induces no severe changes in the π–π stacking distance of adjacent P3HT chains in a layer.

Additional evidence for the direct correlation between the QBT-induced optimization of the layer microstructure and the improvement of device performance is obtained by the composition dependent FF parameter of the ternary P3HT:PCBM:QBT photodiodes, following their illumination with simulated solar light (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA solar simulator, AM1.5G, 0.92 Suns irradiance as verified by using a silicon reference cell, spectral mismatch factor ∼ 0.99). Photodiodes were fabricated with P3HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers (device structure glass/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM:QBT/Al) prepared by the high and low Mn rr-P3HT batches and by varying the QBT content. Table 2 summarizes the composition dependent main device metrics, obtained from the photo J–V curves; that is short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), FF and power conversion efficiency (PCE). It can be seen that for the high Mn devices and with respect to the binary P3HT:PCBM system (0 wt% QBT), the FF improves by 36% resulting in a 47% increase in the PCE when QBT is kept at 0.6 wt%. For this QBT content the domain size of the P3HT non-densely packed polymorph undergoes a reduction of 30% and the P3HT densely packed polymorph appears with a domain size of 19.1 nm. In contrast, the use of QBT in devices of low Mn negatively affects all device metrics with the highest influence observed in the FF parameter. In terms of changes in the domain size of the P3HT polymorphs of the low Mn samples, both dense and non-dense P3HT crystallite domains remain unaffected maintaining an average value of 15.2 nm and 16.6 nm, respectively, when the QBT used is in the range of 0–1 wt%. The ineffective role of QBT in the low Mn ternary composites underlines the weak influence of QBT in the overall structural properties of P3HT composites with an already optimized crystallinity.

The Jsc parameter of devices made by the composites of high Mn materials shows that despite the continuous increase of hole mobility with increasing the QBT loading, an optimum point is observed for the photocurrent generation. The QBT concentration that corresponds to the optimum Jsc is at 0.6 wt% and for higher QBT loadings it is reduced. In the same vein, despite the high hole mobility found for the devices of low Mn materials, the addition of QBT negatively influences the photocurrent generation and Jsc is gradually reduced as QBT is added in the blend. The gradual deterioration of photocurrent generation, in spite of the improved hole transport properties is attributed to the formation of improper microstructure in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT layers when the QBT content is increased. The addition of high QBT amounts (i.e. >0.6 wt%) perturbs the optimized demixing of the P3HT and PCBM phases and it enhances charge recombination as evidenced previously by the reduced concentration of the photogenerated P3HT polarons.43
In order to gain a deeper insight into the impact of the structural organization on the electronic properties of the ternary composite systems, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements to monitor recombination as a function of light intensity. In a TPV experiment, one photoexcites a device at open circuit with a short laser pulse and measures the resulting voltage transient decay.50–52 The rate at which the voltage relaxes towards equilibrium conditions can be then used as a measure of charge carrier life time. Interestingly, when processing the TPV data we noted a bi-exponential decay.44 We attributed the early decay to recombination (photoexcited hot carriers recombining with trapped carriers in a Shockley–Read–Hall manner) and the slower longer decay to spatial reorganization of charge carriers in the device/multiple trapping and relaxation events. Fig. 3a plots the charge carrier lifetime as a function of QBT content for the P3HT:PCBM:QBT devices prepared by using the high Mn rr-P3HT batch. It can be seen that as the QBT content is increased from 0% to 0.6% the carrier life time slows, and then as the QBT content is further increased carrier life time starts to speed up. This is consistent with the device efficiency data presented above, which shows the 0.6% device to have the highest efficiency. It is conceivable that the emergence of the densely packed P3HT polymorph reduces charge recombination, possibly by reducing the number of trap states.53 If one examines Fig. 3b, which plots the charge carrier life time for the P3HT:PCBM:QBT devices prepared by the low Mn rr-P3HT batch as a function of QBT content, it can be seen that the addition of QBT does not affect the recombination life time. This is again consistent with the notion that the binary P3HT:PCBM composite of the low Mn rr-P3HT has already reached an optimum packing configuration and that the addition of QBT has no effect.

It is worth pointing out that the addition of QBT species into the P3HT:PCBM binary system does not affect the onset of P3HT crystallization peak in the DSC thermogram (see ESI†), as it would be expected for a typical nucleation agent effect.8 However there are several experimental indications that QBT acts as a nucleant that promotes the heterogenous crystallization of the P3HT matrix in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT ternary blend. A careful inspection of the DSC thermograms upon cooling finds that in the presence of the QBT additive, the shape of the P3HT crystallization peak obtains a steeper slope, indicating an acceleration of the crystallization kinetics. The fact that no shift is observed in the crystallization onset is attributed to the minute amount of the QBT agent used. The QBT-induced crystallization rate of the P3HT component is also verified by the increase of the melting/crystallization enthalpy of P3HT when QBT is added;43 that is when the nucleation density is increased in the presence of QBT. An alternative interpretation of the DSC thermograms could be that QBT serves as a plasticizer, which might increase the growth rate of the P3HT crystallites due to an increased mobility of the P3HT chains. However this scenario is unlikely due to the very low amounts of QBT used. Future experiments of cross-polarizing optical microscopy and isothermal DSC characterization measurements should be carried out for verifying our interpretation.
Conclusions
In conclusion we have presented a methodology for controlling the distribution of P3HT polymorphs in the ternary composite system of P3HT:PCBM:QBT. By accurately varying the QBT content in this composite system we induce the formation of a densely packed P3HT polymorph that is found to significantly affect the charge transport properties of the P3HT:PCBM:QBT composite layer. The appearance of the densely packed P3HT polymorph is triggered by the QBT component that serves as a nucleation agent. The QBT-induced formation of the P3HT polymorph is specific to the molecular weight of the P3HT matrix used and it is observed in ternary composites based on high Mn P3HT batches. Further Mn-dependent structural characterization experiments are sought for identifying the Mn range within which the bimodal distribution of P3HT packing occurs and for confirming whether the observed bimodal distribution is present in Mn P3HT batches lower than 10 kDa. At present, this work suggests that the use of appropriate small organic molecules in ternary systems can modulate the polymorph content in their microstructure via simple solution processing protocols thus offering a valuable tool for tuning the electronic properties of the corresponding organic optoelectronic devices.
