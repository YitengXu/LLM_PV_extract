    , Accepted 5th January 2023First published on 5th January 2023AbstractThe generation of layered heterostructures from a combination of two or more different two-dimensional (2D) materials is considered as a powerful strategy to modify the electronic properties of 2D materials and enhance their performance in devices. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and the band alignment in a heterostructure formed from 2D boron phosphide (BP) and silicane (SiH) monolayers. The BP/SiH heterostructure is structurally and mechanically stable in the ground state. The generation of the BP/SiH heterostructure leads to a reduction in the band gap, thus enhancing the optical absorption coefficient compared to the constituent BP and SiH monolayers. In addition, the BP/SiH heterostructure has a high carrier mobility of 3.2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, the combined BP/SiH heterostructure gives rise to the formation of a type-II band alignment, inhibiting the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. The electronic properties and band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure can be tuned by an applied external electric field, which causes a reduction in the band gap and leads to the transition of the band alignment from type-II to type-I. Our findings could act as theoretical guidance for the use of the BP/SiH heterostructure in the design of high-efficiency nanodevices.
1. Introduction
Following the success of the isolation of two-dimensional (2D) graphene,1 many 2D materials with the same hexagonal crystal structure have been discovered and studied, including phosphorene,2,3 transition metal mono- and di-chalcogenides4–7 and silicene.8,9 All these 2D materials hold many appropriate physical and chemical properties for designing high-efficiency electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as field-effect transistors (FETs)10,11 and photodectectors.12,13 However, they also have some limitations, which may strongly affect the device performance and limit the practical applications. For example, a zero band gap in graphene hinders its application in switching devices.14 Unlike graphene, one of the most representative members of the 2D TMD family, MoS2, exhibits a semiconducting feature with a band gap of 1.8 eV.15 However, the low carrier mobility in the 2D MoS2 material16 limits its practical application in integrated circuits. Many strategies have been developed to overcome these limitations in graphene, including quantum confinement, doping, chemical functionalization, strains and electric fields.17–21 However, generating a band gap in graphene using these strategies leads to a significant reduction of the carrier mobility in graphene.22 Therefore, the search for appropriate approaches to modify the properties of 2D materials is still challenging.
Currently, constructing heterostructures between two or more 2D materials has proven to be one of the most common strategies that can effectively be used to modify the electronic and transport properties of 2D materials.23–26 It is interesting that the heterostructures are mainly characterized by the weak forces between the constituent 2D monolayers.27 The weak forces insignificantly affect the intrinsic properties of the constituent 2D monolayers and keep the stack together. This indicates that the intrinsic properties of the constituent 2D materials can be preserved in the combined heterostructure. For instance, the combination of graphene and GeTe monolayers forms a graphene/GeTe heterostructure that maintains the high carrier mobility of graphene.28 In addition, a band gap of a few tens of meV is opened at the K point in the graphene/GeTe heterostructure.28 To date, several heterostructures of 2D materials have been constructed and synthesized, including MoS2-based heterostructures29–31 and phosphorene-based heterostructures.32–34
Boron phosphide (BP), a new type of 2D material, has gained tremendous interest owing to its high carrier mobility35 and good optical absorption.36 The BP monolayer can be successfully synthesized by chemical vapor deposition.37 The BP monolayer shows a planar hexagonal atomic structure that looks like graphene. The BP monolayer is stable at room temperature and exhibits a direct band gap of 0.82–1.83 eV, depending on the computational methods.36,38 More recently, Jing et al.38 predicted that monolayer BP is a promising candidate for high-performance transistors with a high on-state current. Silicane (SiH) has been predicted to be a stable 2D material and can be obtained by full hydrogenation of silicene.39,40 The SiH monolayer possesses an indirect band gap of about 2.93 eV (ref. 41) and is predicted to have a stable structure.42 In addition, the high carrier mobility of the SiH monolayer makes it a promising material for high-performance FETs.41
The combinations of the BP or SiH materials with other 2D materials have been constructed using first-principles prediction. For instance, using first-principles calculations, Shu et al.43 constructed a BP/GaN heterostructure, which is a semiconductor with a direct band gap. In addition, they showed that the optical absorption of such a heterostructure is enhanced. Similarly, Nguyen et al.44 also showed that the generation of the BP/MoGe2N4 heterostructure from the constituent BP and MoGe2N4 monolayers can lead to the formation of a type-II band alignment and enhanced optical absorption. More recently, Yang et al.45 explored the electronic and photocatalytic characteristics of SiH/GaSe and SiH/InSe heterostructures by performing first-principles prediction. They showed that these heterostructures form a type-II band alignment, which is in favor of improving the efficiency of photocatalytic activity.45 In addition, there have been several BP-based and SiH-based heterostructures, including BP/BlueP,46,47 BP/MX2,48 SiH/graphene49 and SiH/Al(Ga)As.50,51 However, a BP/SiH heterostructure formed from a combination of BP and SiH monolayers has not yet been constructed or investigated. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we design the BP/SiH heterostructure and explore its electronic properties and band alignment. Our results show that the BP/SiH heterostructure is structurally and mechanically stable. The generation of the BP/SiH heterostructure leads to the formation of a type-II band alignment, which can also be tuned by an external electric field. Our findings could provide insight and guidance for the use of the BP/SiH heterostructure as a promising candidate for high-performance electronic devices.
2. Computational methods
All the calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP) package.52 The projector augmented wave method was used to treat the ion–electron interaction.53 Whereas the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was selected to provide a better description of the exchange–correlation energy.54 The cut-off energy of 510 eV and the 9 × 9 × 1 k-point mesh were set in all calculations. During the geometry optimization, the convergence of energy and force were set to be lower than 10−5 eV and 0.001 eV Å−1, respectively. The hybrid HSE06 functional was also employed to obtain more accurate electronic band structures of the 2D materials.55 The weak interactions between the layered 2D materials are described by performing the DFT-D3 method.56,57 The phonon spectra of the 2D materials were simulated using the finite displacement techniques with the PHONOPY code.58 A large vacuum of 40 Å was applied along the z-direction of the heterostructure to prevent unnecessary interactions with neighboring slabs.
3. Results and discussion
We first investigate the atomic structure and electronic characteristics of single-layer BP and SiH, as presented in Fig. 1. One can see that the BP monolayer has a planar hexagonal atomic structure, while the SiH monolayer shows a hexagonal buckled one, as depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (e), respectively. The optimized lattice constants of BP and SiH are 3.20 and 3.86 Å, respectively, which are in good agreement with the previous reports.59,60 Interestingly, both the BP and SiH monolayers exhibit semiconducting characters. The BP monolayer is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.89/1.42 eV obtained by the PBE/HSE06 approximation. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are directly located at the M point. Whereas the SiH monolayer shows an indirect band gap of 2.18/2.93 eV given by the PBE/HSE06 functional. It is clear that the PBE functional always underestimates the band gap of 2D materials, while the hybrid HSE06 functional can be used to obtain more accurate band gaps. However, from the PBE and HSE06 band structures in Fig. 1, we find that both these functionals predict the same features for both the BP and SiH monolayers. The difference between the PBE and HSE06 methods is only due to the shift in their band edges relative to the Fermi level. Therefore, we use the PBE functional to perform all the following calculations for the combined heterostructure of the BP and SiH monolayers. The phonon spectra of the BP and SiH monolayers are depicted in Fig. 1(d) and (h), respectively. All frequencies of such monolayers are positive at the Γ point, confirming that they are dynamically stable.
 Fig. 1  (a–d) and (e–h) represent the atomic structures, PBE and HSE band structures, and phonon spectra of BP and SiH, respectively. Green, orange, cyan and red balls denote B, P, Si and H atoms, respectively. 
We further design the BP/SiH heterostructure by placing the BP monolayer on top of the SiH monolayer. The optimized atomic structure of the BP/SiH heterostructure is illustrated in Fig. 2. The BP/SiH heterostructure is constructed using (2 × 2) unit cells of the BP monolayer and (√3 × √3) unit cells of the SiH monolayer. The obtained lattice constant of the BP/SiH heterostructure is 6.49 Å. This indicates that the lattice mismatch in the BP/SiH heterostructure is 1.23%, indicating that the lattice strain of the constituent monolayers is small. After geometry optimization, the BP layer remains unchanged in its planar structure. The interlayer spacing (dsp) between the BP and SiH layers is defined by the distance between the BP layer and the topmost hydrogen layer in the SiH layer. Our calculated dsp is 2.74 Å, which is in good agreement with the other SiH-based heterostructures, including the SiH/PtSe260 and SiH/MoS261 heterostructures.

The binding energy of the heterostructure is also calculated to evaluate its stability using the equation Eb = [EBP/SiH − EBP − ESiH]/S, where EBP/SiH, EBP and ESiH are the total energies of the BP/SiH heterostructure, and the isolated constituent BP and SiH monolayers, respectively. S = 43.12 Å2 and represents the surface area of the heterostructure. The binding energy of the BP/SiH heterostructure is −22.40 meV Å−2, which indicates that this heterostructure is structurally stable. The mechanical stability of the BP/SiH heterostructure is also evaluated by calculating the components of the elastic constants. The elastic constants of the BP/SiH heterostructure, C11, C12 and C66, are 202.33, 50.15 and 76.06 N m−1, respectively. These values meet the Born–Huang criteria,62 confirming that this heterostructure is mechanically stable. Furthermore, we also perform ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations to check the thermodynamic stability of the BP/SiH heterostructure. The AIMD simulations of the fluctuation of total energy and temperature as a function of time steps for the BP/SiH heterostructure are depicted in Fig. 3. We find that the fluctuations of total energy and temperature are small. In addition, it is obvious that there is no atomic distortion in the structure of the BP/SiH heterostructure at room temperature of 300 K. These findings confirm that the BP/SiH heterostructure is thermodynamically stable at room temperature of 300 K.

The projected band structures and band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure are depicted in Fig. 4. One can see that the electronic band structures of the single-layer BP and SiH monolayers seem to be unchanged upon contact. The isolated BP layer keeps its semiconducting character with a direct band gap at the M point, while the isolated SiH layer possesses an indirect band gap with the VBM at the Γ point and the CBM at the K point. This finding suggests that the intrinsic properties of both the BP and SiH monolayers can be preserved in their combined heterostructure. More interestingly, the formation of the BP/SiH heterostructure leads to a reduction in the band gap compared to the constituent BP and SiH monolayers. The band gap of the BP/SiH heterostructure reduces to 0.42/1.07 eV, as obtained by the PBE/HSE06 functionals. The narrower band gap in the BP/SiH heterostructure indicates that the formation of such a heterostructure can give rise to an enhancement in the optical absorption. Moreover, the BP/SiH heterostructure is an indirect band gap semiconductor. The VBM of the heterostructure is located at the Γ point and is mainly contributed by the SiH layer, while the CBM is located at the K point and is mainly dominated by the BP layer. The different contributions to the CBM and VBM of the BP/SiH heterostructure demonstrate that the formation of this heterostructure generates a type-II band alignment. The band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure is depicted in Fig. 4(c). It is clear that the formation of a type-II band alignment is considered as an efficient strategy to inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. The photogenerated electrons are injected from the SiH to the BP layer, while the photogenerated holes are migrated in the opposite way. The generation of a type-II band alignment in the BP/SiH heterostructure suggests that it can be considered as a promising material for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. In addition, from a practical viewpoint, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a heterostructure is an important point used to evaluate the utilization efficiency of sunlight.63–65 The PCE can be obtained by the method of Scharber et al.66 However, in this work, we mainly focus on the electronic properties and band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure, as well as its controllable electronic properties under an electric field. The optoelectronic properties and the PCE will be focused on in our future work.

(c) Schematic diagram of the band alignment in the BP/SiH heterostructure. 
The carrier mobility (μi) of the BP/SiH heterostructure is also established by calculating the effective mass (m*), elastic modulus C2D and deformation potential (Ei) as follows: (1)
Here, kB and ħ are the Boltzmann constant and the reduced Planck constant, respectively. e and T are the electronic charge and temperature, respectively. md is the average effective mass.The effective mass of 2D materials is expressed by: (2)
Here, E(k) is the energy along the momentum k. The deformation potential is given by: (3)
Here, ΔEedge is the fluctuation of the energy of the band edges under small strain ε. The elastic modulus is given by: (4)
Our results show that the BP/SiH heterostructure has a high electron carrier mobility of 3.2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is greater than its hole carrier mobility of 1500 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, we also calculate the carrier mobility of both the constituent BP and SiH monolayers for comparison. The calculated carrier mobilities for the electrons and holes of the SiH monolayer are 260 and 383 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Whereas the carrier mobilities for the electrons and holes of the BP monolayer are 2 × 103 and 587 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. One can see that the carrier mobilities of the BP/SiH heterostructure for electrons and holes are greater than those in the constituent BP and SiH monolayers. The enhancement in the carrier mobility of the BP/SiH heterostructure suggests that this heterostructure is a promising candidate for high-efficiency electronic devices.
The electrostatic potential of the BP/SiH heterostructure is displayed in Fig. 5(a). One can see that the BP layer has a deeper potential than the SiH layer. The charge density difference between the BP and SiH layers is also visualized as Δρ = ρBP/SiH − ρBP − ρSiH, where ρBP/SiH, ρBP and ρSiH are the charge densities of the BP/SiH heterostructure, and the isolated BP and SiH layers, respectively. The electrons are mainly accumulated in the side of the BP layer, while they are mainly depleted in the side of the SiH layer, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 5(b). This finding demonstrates that the electrons transfer from the SiH layer to the BP layer, while holes are transferred in the opposite direction from the BP layer to the SiH layer. The mechanism of the charge transfers between the two materials can be described by calculating the work functions as: φ = Evac − EF, where Evac and EF are the vacuum energy and Fermi level, respectively. The work functions of BP, SiH and their BP/SiH heterostructure are calculated to be 5.07, 5.11 and 5.08 eV, respectively. The electrons will flow from the material (SiH) with the lower work function to the material (BP) with the higher work function.

Yellow and cyan areas represent the charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. Red and blue lines represent the SiH and BP layers in the BP/SiH heterostructure, respectively. 
Furthermore, it is interesting that the BP/SiH heterostructure may be tuned by the external electric field (Efield) when using it as a component in an electronic device. Thus, we further investigate the effects of the Efield on the electronic properties of the BP/SiH heterostructure. The schematic model of an Efield applied to the BP/SiH heterostructure is depicted in the inset of Fig. 6(a). It can be seen that the band gap of the BP/SiH heterostructure changes significantly under applied Efield, as illustrated in Fig. 6. With the application of a negative Efield, the band gap increases linearly. The band gap increases from 0.42 eV to 0.83 eV when a negative Efield is applied from 0 to −0.3 V Å−1. Whereas, when a positive Efield is applied, the band gap of the BP/SiH heterostructure is reduced from 0.42 under Efield = 0, to 0.11 eV under Efield = +0.3 V Å−1. To understand the changing mechanism in the band gap of the heterostructure, we further evaluate the fluctuation of the band edges of both SiH and BP monolayers as a function of applied Efield, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b) and (c), respectively. One can see that when the applied Efield is changed from −0.3 to +0.3 V Å−1, the energies of the VBM of the SiH layer, and the CBM of the BP layer, are decreased. The reduction in the VBM (CBM) of the SiH (BP) layer gives rise to the reduction in the band gap of the BP/SiH heterostructure.

To understand the mechanism of the change in the electronic properties in detail, we then plot the projected band structures of the BP/SiH heterostructure under different strengths of the Efield, as depicted in Fig. 7. The negative Efield leads to the shift of the VBM and CBM of the SiH and BP layers in opposite directions. When increasing the negative Efield to more positive values, the VBM of the BP layer shifts towards the Fermi level, while the CBM shifts far away from the Fermi level. On the other hand, the VBM of the SiH layer is downshifted far from the Fermi level, while the CBM is moved towards the Fermi level. As we have discussed above, the band edges of the BP/SiH heterostructure come from the CBM of the BP layer at the K point and the VBM of the SiH layer at the Γ point. Under an applied negative Efield, the CBM at the K point of the BP layer upshifts far from the Fermi level, while the VBM at the Γ point of the SiH layer is downshifted far from the Fermi level, resulting in an increase of the band gap of the BP/SiH heterostructure. It should be noted here that when the applied negative Efield is greater than −0.3 V Å−1, the VBM of the BP layer moves closer to the Fermi level than the VBM of the SiH layer. In this case, the band edges of the BP/SiH heterostructure come from the VBM at the Γ point and the CBM at the K point of the BP layer, indicating a transformation from a type-II to type-I band alignment. When the positive Efield is applied, the CBM of the BP layer shifts towards the Fermi level, while the VBM is moved far from the Fermi level. In addition, with the application of the positive Efield, the VBM of the SiH layer shifts towards the Fermi level, while its CBM moves far from the Fermi level. When the applied positive Efield is larger than +0.3 V Å−1, both the band edges of the BP/SiH heterostructure move towards and cross the Fermi level, implying a transition from semiconductor to metal. All these findings demonstrate that a negative Efield causes an increase in the band gap and leads to a transformation from a type-II to type-I band alignment, while a positive Efield gives rise to a reduction in the band gap and leads to a transition from semiconductor to metal in the BP/SiH heterostructure. The controllable electronic structure and band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure make it a promising candidate for high-performance photovoltaic solar cells and energy conversion devices.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed the BP/SiH heterostructure and systematically explored its electronic structure and band alignment using first-principles calculations. The BP/SiH heterostructure is mechanically and structurally stable in the ground state. The BP/SiH heterostructure is a semiconductor with a type-II band alignment. The generation of the BP/SiH heterostructure gives rise to a reduction in the band gap that may lead to an enhancement in the optical absorption coefficient. In addition, this heterostructure exhibits a high carrier mobility of about 3.2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting that it is a promising material for high-efficiency nanodevices. Furthermore, the combined BP/SiH heterostructure gives rise to the formation of a type-II band alignment, inhibiting the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. The electronic properties and band alignment of the BP/SiH heterostructure can be tuned by an applied external electric field, which causes a reduction in the band gap and leads to the transition of the band alignment from type-II to type-I. Our findings could act as theoretical guidance for the use of the BP/SiH heterostructure in the design of high-efficiency nanodevices.
