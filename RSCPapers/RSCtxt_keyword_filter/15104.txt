    , Accepted 26th February 2021First published on 12th March 2021AbstractA simpler and less expensive fabrication process is one of the essential demands for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Especially, inverted PeSCs (I-PeSCs) require a cathode buffer layer (CBL) for fabricating highly efficient and stable PeSCs. However, this increases the number of fabrication step. Here, we demonstrate highly stable and efficient cathode-buffer-layer-free I-PeSCs via additive engineering on an ETL, which is based on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) with a small amount of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). This modified ETL shows not only a simplified fabrication process but also effective extraction of charge from the perovskite to a high work function copper electrode (Cu) by formation of an interfacial dipole at the interfaces between the ETL and the Cu. Additionally, it exhibits good passivation of the trap density existing along the grain boundaries and surface of the perovskite layer, reducing the non-radiative recombination and consistent with the increases in open-circuit voltage (Voc). As a result, I-PeSCs with a blend PC61BM:PMMA ETL demonstrate an enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 13.55% (without PMMA) to 18.38%. Furthermore, they exhibit both burn-in-free behaviour in photostability measurements by maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) method and long-term air-stability (30 days for T90) in ambient air. Lastly, we obtained PCE of 15.03% and 16.83% for large-area (1 cm2) I-PeSCs with PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA, respectively. This method provides an alternative route to reduce the fabrication time and budget for commercialization of I-PeSCs without sacrificing device performance.
Introduction
Recent achievements in realizing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25% for solution-processed metal halide perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) have opened up the possibility of low-cost and light-weight solar cells because of their exclusive optoelectronic properties, such as a long charge-carrier lifetime, high absorption coefficient and large electron–hole diffusion length (>1 μm).1–5 However, such high PCEs are only obtained in mesoporous type PeSCs that require high-temperature processing at over 450 °C for sintering the electron transport layer (ETL) (e.g., n-type TiO2 layer), which limits the application of perovskite/Si or CIGS tandem and flexible solar cells.6–8 Moreover, general use of hole transport layer (HTL) materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD, demonstrates the low stability and overnight oxidation time.9,10 Hence, it is imperative to develop simple and stable PeSCs. Alternatively, planar type PeSCs (inverted PeSCs, I-PeSCs) with a device configuration of ITO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/cathode have attracted extensive research attention for various applications of PeSCs owing to their low-temperature processing (T ≤ 100 °C), stable device structure and small hysteresis behaviour.3,11–16
For low-temperature solution-processed I-PeSCs, fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM, C60, and ICBA) as the ETL have widely been employed in I-PeSCs owing to their room temperature solubility and solution orthogonality as well as passivation of uncoordinated iodide ion (I−) at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films.3,13,15–18 However, I-PeSCs with fullerene derivatives (especially PC61BM) as the ETL exhibit lower short-circuit currents (Jsc) and fill factors (FF) due to not only their low electron mobility and interfacial recombination but also the energy barrier at the interface between the ETL and the metal electrodes, especially for high work function (WF) metals, resulting in poor device performances. Hence, a general way to solve this problem is to use a bi-layered structure consisting of fullerene derivatives and various cathode buffer layers (CBLs; e.g., C60, BCP, Ca, LiF, and metal oxides) between the perovskite layer and the metal electrode.11–13,15,16,19–22 Consequently, it improves all the photovoltaic parameters, especially Jsc and FF, which is attributed to the effective electron transport via modifying the energy barrier at the interface of the ETL and the electrode for I-PeSCs. However, the bi-layered structure (PC61BM/CBL) requires an additional fabrication step, including thermal evaporation or spin-coating, compromising the advantages of I-PeSCs, such as easy fabrication for mass production.
Alternatively, without increasing the number of fabrication steps, various additives (graphene, quantum dots, insulating polymers, and small molecules) have been incorporated with fullerene derivatives to dope, replace or modify the ETL in I-PeSCs.23–30 Among all the reported materials, poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, which is a commercially available insulating polymer, with PC61BM as the ETL led to mitigation of the trap density, leading to the reduction of the non-radiative recombination loss, but also improved the electrical contact with the adjacent layers by improving the interface binding, leading to an increase of Jsc in normal and inverted PeSCs.24,25,31–33 However, the systematic advantages of the blended ETL (PC61BM:PMMA) itself in I-PeSCs have not been fully explored yet, nor have the benefits of large-area I-PeSCs.
Here, we report a simplified device configuration of a cathode-buffer-layer-free I-PeSC using the blend PC61BM:PMMA as the ETL. Results from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) carried out for PC61BM:PMMA/Cu films showed a significant reduction in the WF of the Cu electrode, leading to energy level matching at the interface of the PC61BM and the Cu. In addition, we found enhanced carrier extraction in the perovskites/PC61BM:PMMA film by observing a strong quenching of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and passivation of surface defects in the perovskite material, eventually leading to a significant enhancement in PCE from 13.55 to 18.38%, which is attributed to improvements in both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) (1.07 → 1.12 eV) and the FF (66 → 79%) for the devices. Besides, because of a reduction in the surface defect density and good coverage of the ETL on the surface of the perovskite layer, the PC61BM:PMMA-based I-PeSCs exhibit better photostability with the observation of a burn-in-free behaviour under continuous illumination of 1 sun in N2 and improved environmental stability (30 days for 90% of their initial efficiency) in ambient air. Finally, to evaluate the possibility of this approach for large area device, we fabricated large area device with an area of 1 cm2 and obtained a PCE of 16.83%.
Experiments
Materials
All the solvents used in the study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification. Poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA, 0.25 wt%, EM Index) and PC61BM (2 wt%, Nano-C) were dissolved in toluene and chlorobenzene (CB), respectively. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br, 0.05 wt%, 1-material), used as a surface compatibilizer, was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (99.8%).34 The perovskite precursor solution comprising lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 1.5 mol, TCI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, 1.5 mol, Great Solar Cell) was prepared by dissolving the materials in a mixed solvent of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a volume ratio of 8:1 and stirring at 60 °C overnight. PMMA (0.25 to 4 wt%, purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, molecular weight ∼15000) was dissolved in toluene. The mixed PC61BM:PMAA precursor solution was prepared with a volume ratio of 10:1.
Device fabrication
For fabricating the I-PeSCs, a solution of PTAA was spin-coated onto pre-patterned and cleaned indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s in air, and used as an HTL. The completed film was transferred into an N2-filled glove box. PFN-Br solution was deposited onto the ITO/PTAA at 5000 rpm for 30 s. For depositing the perovskite layer, the perovskite precursor solution (60 μl) of methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3) was spin-coated onto the ITO/PTAA/PFN-Br film at 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the spin-coating, an anti-solvent of diethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) was drop cast after 5 s of spin-coating, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. A solution of PC61BM or PC61BM:PMMA (with a 0.25 μl PTFE filter) was spin-coated onto this film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of the PC61BM or PC61BM:PMMA films is approximately 40–50 nm. Finally, I-PeSCs were fabricated by deposition of a metal electrode (100 nm thickness of Cu) by evaporation through a mask at a rate of 1 Å s−1 under high vacuum (10−6 mbar). The active area of the I-PeSCs was 4.64 mm2. For fabricating the large-area I-PeSCs, the procedure is identical to the aforementioned method used for the small-area I-PeSCs. However, the large-active-area I-PeSCs, i.e., 1 cm2, were made by depositing the Cu using a mask with a large-area pattern.
Device measurement and film characterization
For the small I-PeSC devices, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the I-PeSCs were measured using a Keithley 238 Source Measure Unit (Tektronix) under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) illumination from a solar simulator (Newport 750, Newport) with an intensity of 100 mA cm−2 in an N2 glove box. For the large I-PeSCs device, the J–V characteristics were measured by an IviumSoft apparatus with simulated AM 1.5G from a solar simulator (100 mA cm−2, Abet Technologies Sun 3000) under ambient conditions. Prior to measurement, the intensity of the solar simulator was precisely calibrated by using a standard KG5 reference cell (purchased from Newport). Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QuantX-300, Newport Corporation). This system was calibrated using a calibrated reference detector (603621 Calibrated Reference Detector, Newport Corporation). UPS measurement was conducted using a He(I) source (21.2 eV) and calibrated using a gold (Au) reference standard at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). UV-Vis absorption spectra for the sample films were obtained using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR, Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Contact potential difference (CPD) measurements were carried out using the Kelvin probe technique (KP6500, McAllister Technical Services). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained in non-contact mode using a Park Systems XE-100 AFM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements for the devices were performed using galvanostatic mode (PGSTAT30, Metrohm AG) under applied open-circuit conditions (with frequency ranging between 0.1 MHz and 1 MHz) and under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) illumination (with an intensity of 100 mA cm−2) without a UV filter using a Newport 750 solar simulator. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a 470 nm laser source (P-C-470, Picoquant) and a photodiode array detector (QEPro, Ocean Optics). For the PL measurements, MAPbI3/PC61BM, MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA, PTAA/PFN-Br/MAPbI3, PTAA/MAPbI3, and PFN/MAPbI3 films on quartz substrates were excited from the ETL side for monitoring the electron transfer dynamics at the perovskite and ETL interface. Time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system.35 The decay profiles were obtained by photoexciting the films from the ETL side. A picosecond excitation laser source (PicoQuant GmbH) with a wavelength of 470 nm was used. The PL decay-time constants were obtained by first deconvoluting the measured signal from the excitation beam time profile (characterized by a full width at half-maximum of ∼60 ps) and then fitting to a summation of exponential terms, i.e., I(t) = A1exp(−t/t1) + A2exp(−t/t2), where I(t) is the time-dependent fluorescence intensity, A is the amplitude (noted in parentheses as the normalized percentage, i.e., [Ai/(A1 + A2)] × 100), and t is the fitted decay time. The averaged decay times (tavg) were obtained using (A1t1 + A2t2)/(A1 + A2). The χ2 values for the deconvolution fitting were 1.0–1.2. The time-resolved photoconductivity (TPC) measurements were performed using a picosecond excitation laser source (PicoQuant GmbH) with a wavelength of 470 nm and an oscilloscope sampling rate of 2.5 GHz (WaveRunner 625Zi, Lecroy).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic of the general device structure of ITO/PTAA/PFN-Br/MAPbI3/PC61BM/PC61BM:PMMA/Cu used in this work, where MAPbI3 was used as the photoactive layer, and the PTAA/PFN-Br double layer and Cu were used as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and top electrode, respectively. The PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA were used as ETLs. Our devices indicate the simplification of the I-PeSCs device structure, which normally uses a CBL. To find the optimum conditions, we varied the concentration of PMMA in the range of 0.25–4 wt% in PC61BM solution (Fig. S1 and Table S1†). The best performance was obtained using 1 wt% of PMMA in PC61BM (hereafter, denoted as PC61BM:PMMA (1 wt%)). AFM topographic images of the films recorded before and after depositing the ETLs are shown in Fig. 1(b)–(e). Bare MAPbI3 exhibits a large number of grains and GBs. After depositing PC61BM onto MAPbI3, a featureless surface morphology was observed, indicative of full coverage of PC61BM and plausible infiltration of PC61BM into the GBs of the perovskites, which may lead to microscopic structural changes at the interfaces and in the bulk.36–38 The AFM image of the PC61BM:PMMA (1 wt%) deposited on MAPbI3 showed almost identical features to that for PC61BM deposited onto MAPbI3. In contrast, the PC61BM:PMMA (4 wt%) deposited onto MAPbI3 exhibits a larger phase separation, indicating that an excess amount of PMMA is highly aggregated, as different morphology was found for PMMA (4 wt%) deposited onto MAPbI3 (Fig. S2(a) and (b)†). In addition, the roughness (Rrms) of PC61BM ETL itself is approximately 1.375 nm, while PC61BM:PMMA ETL shows Rrms of 1.153 nm. This indicates that the addition of PMMA produces a smoother film, which may lead to better electron transfer from the MAPbI3 to the Cu electrode.

The champion device with an optimized PC61BM:PMMA ETL (see Fig. 2(a) and Table S2†) exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.38% with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 20.80 mA cm−2, an FF of 79%, and negligible hysteresis for forward and reverse bias voltage scans. In contrast, the control device (PC61BM based I-PeSCs) exhibited a PCE of 13.55%, with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 19.39 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66%. The Jsc values obtained from the J–V characteristics are well-matched with the integrated Jsc values obtained from the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 2(b). Note that the overall intensity of the IPCE spectrum for the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA is higher than that of the I-PeSC with PC61BM, indicating that the charge extraction from the perovskite layer to the metal electrode is enhanced. It is also noticeable that the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA exhibited a further increase in Voc (i.e., mean value of ∼70 mV) compared to the control device, indicating an improvement in the interface contact between the MAPbI3 film and the metal electrode, despite the similar AFM topographic images found for the PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA deposited onto MAPbI3 films (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). This may be attributed to the carbonyl (CO) groups on PMMA additionally passivating the uncoordinated defects (e.g., Pb2+ ions).32 For the purposes of comparison, we also fabricated I-PeSCs with a bi-layered ETL by depositing BCP onto the PC61BM layer. The BCP-based I-PeSCs exhibited PCE = 17.88% (Fig. S3(a) and Table S2†), which is lower than that found for the I-PeSC with a PC61BM:PMMA ETL. To investigate the reproducibility of the device fabrication, we plotted the values for Voc, FF, Jsc, and PCE obtained from numerous I-PeSCs fabricated using PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA as ETLs, as plotted in Fig. S1(a)–(d).† Notably, compared to the PC61BM-based I-PeSCs, the PC61BM:PMMA-based I-PeSCs consistently show enhancements in Voc, FF, and Jsc.

(c) Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra obtained from PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA (1 wt%) films and (d) the energy level diagram proposed following analysis of the UPS data. 
As shown in the J–V characteristics, a significant change occurs in the series resistance around Voc. For observing the energy levels, we investigated the WF of Cu with PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA by performing UPS measurements. The samples were prepared by detaching the films from ITO/PC61BM/Cu and ITO/PC61BM:PMMA/Cu using carbon tape. The UPS spectra measured for the secondary electron cut-off (SEC) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) regions are plotted in Fig. 2(c). The energy levels calculated from the UPS data for PC61BM/Cu and PC61BM:PMMA/Cu are summarized in Table S3.† The resulting data show a WF change from −4.9 eV to −4.1 eV after incorporation of PMMA into PC61BM. Using the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S4†) and UPS results (Table S3†), we constructed an energy level diagram for the PC61BM- and PC61BM:PMMA-based I-PeSCs, as depicted in Fig. 2(d). Note that the resultant energy level for the PC61BM:PMMA/Cu located at −4.1 eV is very close to the LUMO of the PC61BM at 4.0 eV. The closely located energy levels can lead to an ohmic contact that may accelerate the electron transfer rate from the perovskite layer to the Cu, eventually leading to improvements in Voc, FF, and Jsc. In general, the energy level of a metal electrode is known to be shifted by the formation of interfacial dipoles that are induced by depositing CBLs onto PC61BM layers.39,40 Because our devices do not include CBLs, the use of a blended PC61BM:PMMA layer may play a role in generating interfacial dipoles. A large shift in the work function of the Cu is also evidenced by Kelvin probe measurements for the sample devices (see Fig. S5†).
To characterize the charge-carrier extraction behaviour of the PC61BM:PMMA ETL in I-PeSCs, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay. The data shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) were obtained by photoexciting the ETL side of the films and monitoring the electron transfer and transport at the perovskite and ETL interface. As depicted in Fig. 3(a), the relative intensity of the steady-state PL spectra systematically decreases when moving from bare MAPbI3 to MAPbI3/PC61BM and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA, demonstrating an enhancement in the carrier extraction from the perovskite to the ETL.24,41–45 The PL of MAPbI3 is quenched by 95% and 99% in MAPbI3/PC61BM and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA, respectively. In addition, the PL peak blue shifts from 769 nm to 765 nm and 764 nm when moving from bare MAPbI3 to MAPbI3/PC61BM and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA, which is indicative of passivation in the carrier defect sites, as demonstrated previously in other perovskite/PCBM systems.46 As shown in Fig. 3(b), the TRPL-decay becomes faster when going from bare MAPbI3 to MAPbI3/PC61BM and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA, consistent with the PL quenching results shown in Fig. 3(a). Based on fitting the data with the use of bi-exponential functions, we obtained decay-time constants of 1.39 ns (15%) and 18.65 ns (85%) for the bare MAPbI3, 0.95 ns (91%) and 2.94 ns (9%) for MAPbI3/PC61BM, and 0.8 ns (97%) and 2.21 ns (3%) for MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA. According to the literature, the two time-decay constants (1.39 ns and 18.65 ns) in the bare MAPbI3 may result from carrier recombination at the surface and bulk of the perovskite, while the fast and slow time-decay constants for MAPbI3/PC61BM and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA can be attributed to the carrier extraction to the ETL and carrier recombination via radiative channels, respectively.41,47–49 Note that the charge extraction time decreases from 950 ps to 800 ps and the relative contribution of these fast time components to the decay profiles increases from 91% to 97% following replacement of the ETL of PC61BM by PC61BM:PMMA. These results are indicative of accelerated, and thus enhanced, charge extraction in the perovskite/PC61BM:PMMA. Moreover, the shorter 0.3 ns hole transfer time of the device is observed from TRPL measurement of the quartz/PTAA/PFN-Br/MAPbI3 film (Fig. S6†). The increase in the Jsc of the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA observed in Fig. 2(a) may result from an enhanced electron extraction and thus more balanced charge transport, which principally reduces carrier recombination loss.

(b) Time-resolved PL decay for MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PC61BM, and MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA films. Excitation and detection wavelengths of 470 nm and 770 nm were used, respectively. (c) Time-resolved photoconductivity (TPC) data for I-PeSCs fabricated using PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA as ETLs. An excitation wavelength of 470 nm was used. (d) Nyquist plots for the impedance of the control and optimized devices measured under 1 sun in N2. 
The improved carrier transport in the device was investigated by using TPC and EIS measurements. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the TPC profiles for the I-PeSCs with PC61BM:PMMA ETLs exhibit a shorter TPC time-decay constant of 167 ns compared to the control device, i.e., 188 ns, which is indicative of reduced resistance and enhanced carrier transport at the PC61BM:PMMA and Cu interface. Fig. 3(d) shows the Nyquist plots for the PC61BM- and PC61BM:PMMA-based I-PeSCs measured under open-circuit conditions with an illumination intensity of 1 sun (i.e., 100 mW cm−2) under N2. The Nyquist plots were fitted by using a simplified equivalent circuit model comprising Rs (apparatus resistance at high frequency), CPE (constant phase element or double layer capacitance), and Rp (polarization resistance at low frequency), as briefly noted in the inset. The notable change in the plots is the huge decrease in the value of the impedance over the whole frequency range measured for the PC61BM:PMMA-based I-PeSCs. Because HTL/MAPbI3 is consistently used for the two devices, the variation in Rs and Rp is exclusively attributed to the change in the ETL/Cu interface as obtained in the UPS data. The calculated parameters are summarized in Table S4.† A significant decrease in the Rs is observed on replacing the PC61BM ETL with PC61BM:PMMA. In contrast, a small variation is detected in Rs. These results indicate that modification of the ETL does not change the overall electrical properties for the HTL/MAPbI3/ETL. However, the large decrease in Rp (i.e., from 273.43 Ω cm−2 to 44.10 Ω cm−2) is indicative of improved charge-carrier extraction at the ETL/Cu interface. To further verify the increased charge transport observed when blended PC61BM:PMMA is used as the ETL, we measured the J–V curves at several local points across the films as characterized by AFM measurements (Fig. 1(b)–(e)). As shown in Fig. S7,† the MAPbI3/PC61BM:PMMA film shows a significant enhancement in dark current intensity at >8 V compared to the MAPbI3/PMMA and MAPbI3/PC61BM films. The increment in dark current is indicative of enhanced charge-carrier transport at the ETL/Cu interface.
To evaluate the trap density (Ntrap-density) in the I-PeSCs with an ETL, we fabricated electron-only devices with the structures of ITO/C60/MAPbI3/PC61BM or PC61BM:PMMA/Cu and performed space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. According to the charge behaviour, the J–V plots can be divided into three regions: ohmic region, trap-filled limited (TFL) region, and child region. As shown in Fig. 4(a), in the TFL region, we calculated the Ntrap-density in the I-PeSCs with PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA ETLs to be 5.41 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.54 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Details for the calculation are noted in Table S5.† The lower Ntrap-density in the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA indicates that the incorporation of PMMA effectively suppresses the inherent defects in MAPbI3, leading to reduced charge recombination at the interface. According to previous reports, this change may be attributed to the defect passivation induced by the Lewis acid–base interaction between the oxygen of the carboxylic acid in the PMMA and the defects in the perovskites distributed along the GBs.32

We examined the operational and environmental stability of the I-PeSCs with PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA ETLs. The operational stability was determined by monitoring the I-PeSCs via a maximum power-point tracking method (MPPT) under continuous illumination of full 1 sun spectrum with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under N2 gas, without encapsulation. The environmental stability of the devices was tested by storing the devices in ambient air, i.e., at 25 °C with 25–40% relative humidity (RH). Fig. 5(a) presents the operational stability of I-PeSCs. The PCE for I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETL maintains 85% of its initial efficiency after 800 minutes (T85 ∼800 minutes), while the control device (I-PeSC with PC61BM ETL) shows T90 ∼450 minutes. In addition, it is noticeable that the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETL exhibits a burn-in loss free behaviour at early times (<20 minutes) (inset of Fig. 5(a)). Since carrier recombination at the defect sites may generate heat that can shorten the device lifetime, the observed increase in the device lifetime may result from the existence of well-ordered energy levels and reduced defects in the MAPbI3 film, followed by enhanced carrier extraction and transport at the ETL/Cu interface. For the environmental stability, the PCE for I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETL maintains 90% of its initial PCE after ageing for 30 days, while a significant drop in PCE was observed after 12 days in the control devices (I-PeSC with PC61BM ETL). To compare the bi-layered and single ETLs, we also tested the environmental stability for the I-PeSC with a PC61BM/BCP ETL. We note that the I-PeSC with a PC61BM:PMMA ETL exhibits a better device lifetime compared to the I-PeSC with a PC61BM/BCP bi-layered ETL. The extended device lifetime may be attributed to the hydrophobic characteristic of the PMMA, which may shield it from moisture from the environment.50

(b) PCE for I-PeSCs plotted as a function of storage time under ambient air at 25 °C with a relative humidity of 20–45%. 
Finally, we fabricated large-area devices of 1 cm2 for I-PeSCs with PC61BM and PC61BM:PMMA ETLs. As shown in Fig. 6, the best large I-PeSC with PC61BM ETL exhibited a PCE of 13.95% with Voc = 1.08V, Jsc = 19.87 mA cm−2 and FF = 65%, while a better PCE of 16.83% was obtained for the best large I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETLs (Voc = 1.15V, Jsc = 20.42 mA cm−2 and FF = 72%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value yet reported for any existing large-area I-PeSCs without using CBL.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an efficient ETL that shows excellent charge extraction and a well-aligned energy level on a Cu electrode for realizing efficient and stable I-PeSCs by adding PMMA into the PC61BM ETL. The incorporation of PMMA (1 wt%) into PC61BM shifted the WF of the Cu electrode from −4.9 eV to −4.1 eV, leading to an ohmic contact at the ETL/Cu interface. Furthermore, the mixed ETL successfully suppressed defect sites in the perovskite film, leading to a reduction in the defect density and carrier recombination. Therefore, the reduced energy barrier at the ETL/Cu interface enhanced the charge extraction from the perovskite film to the Cu electrode, improving the Jsc, Voc, and FF in the devices. As a result, we obtained an improved PCE of 18.38% for the I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETL compared to that of the control device (PCE of 13.55%). Because of the defect passivation effect of the PC61BM:PMMA ETL, the optimized I-PeSC without encapsulation exhibited improved device stability for operation with 1 sun irradiation and environmental air conditions, as characterized by T85 ∼800 minutes and T90 ∼30 days, respectively. Finally, we achieved a PCE of 16.83% for the large-area I-PeSC with PC61BM:PMMA ETL.
