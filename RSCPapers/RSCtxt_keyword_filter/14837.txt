    , Accepted 11th September 2019First published on 12th September 2019AbstractThe performances of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have improved remarkably in recent years, but such devices are insufficiently stable for practical applications. Here, we investigated the effects of NFAs on PSC long-term stability. We found that high performance PBDB-T:ITIC solar cells exhibit much lower stability than PTB7:PC71BM devices in the 1 sunlight-soaking test; when compared with their initial performances, the performance of PTB7:PCBM-based solar cells remains above 60% for over 4000 h, whereas that of PBDB-T:ITIC-based devices is reduced to one fifth after 1000 h. We demonstrated that the ITIC-based PSCs exhibit poor photo-stability because ITIC at the interface of the ZnO/active film is readily decomposed by a photocatalytic reaction; this poor stability arises because the vinyl group of ITIC is chemically more vulnerable than the stable aromatic units in the organic active materials. The decomposition of ITIC results in the degradation of the electron transport properties of the active materials located close to ZnO, which leads to severe burn-in degradation and reduced FF and VOC under illumination. It is thus highly important to develop intrinsically stable organic materials composed of chemically stable building blocks in order to realize stable and high efficiency PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor in combination with an n-type organic semiconductor such as a fullerene derivative, an n-type conjugated polymer or an organic small molecule as an acceptor have received great attention because of their merits such as simple device structure, low weight, flexibility, and solution processability.1–8 Non-fullerene small molecule acceptors exhibit several advantages over their fullerene-based counterparts, such as readily tunable energy levels, enhanced light absorption over the UV-vis to near IR range, controllable electrical properties in thin films, and significantly reduced bandgap-to-open-circuit voltage losses.7–11 Various non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been developed over the past few years. Of these NFAs, it has been demonstrated that 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)12 and its various derivatives13–15 are among the most promising. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to the molecular engineering of ITIC derivatives in order to improve their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). It has been demonstrated that synergetic molecular engineering of both donors and acceptors is an effective approach for improving PCEs above 15%.16–18
To meet the requirements of industrial commercialization, the appropriate balance between PCE and device lifetime must be obtained. However, with the advent of NFAs, which are currently outperforming fullerene-based acceptors, research has focused on device efficiency rather than device stability. More importantly, there have been few intensive studies that compare the photo-stabilities of fullerene- and NFA-based solar cells.19–23 Although the stability of PSCs based on fullerene derivatives has been investigated,24–27 fewer systematic studies have been performed on the stability of PSCs based on NFAs, particularly ITIC derivatives.28,29 Furthermore, there is a lack of a systematic study of the optimal solar cells of these two acceptors under the same environment. Fullerene-based solar cell devices usually exhibit low photo-stability because fullerene derivatives can undergo photochemical reactions such as the [2 + 2] reaction.30–32 Thus a systematic investigation of the photo-stability of ITIC-based PSCs in a well-controlled environment is required.
In this report, we investigate the photo-stability of PSCs based on ITIC and the most commonly used donor polymer poly[2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, we found that the ITIC:PBDB-T-based system exhibits much lower photo-stability than the PTB7:PCBM-based system under the condition of 1 sunlight soaking in the absence of air. We investigated the effects of the ITIC acceptor on the photo-stability and degradation of these NFA-based PSC devices. The decomposition of ITIC occurs at the interface between ZnO and the PSC active layer, which was demonstrated by scrutinizing the photochemical reactions of the vinyl group-linked accepting unit of ITIC coated onto the ZnO film. Finally, we provide guidelines for the design of NFAs that simultaneously exhibit high PSC performance and device stability.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Photovoltaic properties
PSCs with the inverted cell architecture ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag containing a binary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer blend of PBDB-T:ITIC or PTB7:PC71BM were fabricated. The optimized donor:acceptor ratios are 1:1 and 1:1.3 for the PBDB-T:ITIC and PTB7:PC71BM active films respectively. To directly compare the device stabilities, all the solar cells were fabricated under identical optimized processing conditions. The experimental procedures and conditions are described in detail in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized PSCs for each binary blend under air mass global (AM 1.5G) simulated solar illumination are shown in Fig. 1b and the complete photovoltaic (PV) metrics are summarized in Table 1. The PTB7-based solar cell device exhibits a PCE of 9.3% with a fill factor (FF) of 70.7%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V, and a current density (JSC) of 17.30 mA cm−2 and the PBDB-T-based non-fullerene solar cell exhibits a superior PCE of 10.1% with a FF of 64.8%, a VOC of 0.87 V, and a JSC of 17.88 mA cm−2. The PBDB-T:ITIC-based solar cell exhibits a higher current density than the PTB7:PC71BM solar cell due to its extended UV-vis absorption in the range of 500–800 nm. Fig. 1c presents the EQE spectra of the solar cells. The PBDB-T:ITIC device exhibits a higher EQE in the wavelength range of 550 to 800 nm, which is consistent with the higher JSC of the PBDB-T:ITIC device. The integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are 16.75 and 15.68 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:ITIC and PTB7:PC71BM devices respectively, which are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements. These values were used to characterize device stability and the viability of the NFA-based PSCs.

2.2. Photo-stabilities of the polymer solar cell devices
We now consider the stability of the PTB7:PC71BM and PBDB-T:ITIC solar cells. The stabilities of the glass-encapsulated devices were tested under 1 sunlight soaking. The normalized PCE, FF, JSC, and VOC data are shown in Fig. 2, with full device characteristics. After 50 hours, the PCEs of both representative solar cell devices decrease below 80% and 70% from each initial efficiency of PTB7 and PBDB-T, which is typical of the light-induced burn-in losses reported for other organic solar cells;33,34 interestingly, after these burn-in losses, the PBDB-T:ITIC device exhibits continuous performance decreases whereas the reduction in the PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM device slows down. As a result, after 1100 h of light soaking degradation, the performance of the PTB7 device remains above 65% of its initial value, whereas the performance of the PBDB-T device falls to less than 25% of its initial value. There is not much difference between the degradations in JSC of the PBDB-T and PTB7 devices, but the FF and VOC values of the PBDB-T device decrease more rapidly than those of the PTB7 device. As a result, the PTB7:PC71BM-based solar cell is more stable than the PBDB-T:ITIC-based solar cell with respect to light soaking in the absence of air. This is an interesting result because both PTB7 and PC71BM are known to be unstable with respect to photochemical reactions. To remove an issue of different polymer systems, we also performed the stability test using the same donor polymer system of PBDB-T. PBDB-T:PC71BM devices similarly undergo a burn-in loss at the early time and the degradation rate is close to that of the PTB7:PC71BM system rather than that of PBDB-T:ITIC as shown in Fig. 3.

The differences between the device stabilities of the two systems could be due to degradation in the bulk of the active layers or at the interface of the active layer/interlayers. We studied the degradations of encapsulated active films of PTB7:PC71BM and PBDB-T:ITIC on ZnO-coated substrates by monitoring their UV-vis absorption spectrum changes under 1 sun illumination. As shown in Fig. S1a,† there are no significant changes in the spectra of both active films over 100 hours of exposure; the vibronic peaks and onset points in the absorption spectra are relatively well conserved, which indicates that there is little change in the polymer packing structures of the films and no damage to the polymeric conjugated structures due to photochemical reactions. We obtained atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images of the BHJ active films before and after light soaking, as shown in Fig. S1b.† The morphologies of the BHJ films, particularly their 10 nm scale phase separation, are well maintained, and there are minor changes in the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the films from 2.85 to 2.77 nm for the PBDB-T:ITIC BHJ and from 1.19 to 1.32 nm for the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ. Such small RMS changes are not expected to affect the performances of solar cell devices. We also studied the effects of light soaking on the charge generation, charge transport, and charge recombination properties of the polymer solar cell devices. To investigate the carrier recombination in the active layers of the polymer solar cells, JSC was measured for each device as a function of incident light intensity (Plight) and the data were fitted to the power law JSC ∝ Plightα,35–38 as shown in Fig. S1c.† The initial exponents α for the PTB7:PC71BM- and PBDB-T:ITIC-based cells are identical, α = 0.96, before illumination, and after degradation the α values for PTB7 and PBDB-T decrease slightly to 0.95 and 0.94 respectively. These values are relatively high, which indicates that bimolecular recombination in the BHJ active layers is not significant35,37 and cannot be the main reason for inefficiency. Thus, we conclude that the bulk parts of these active layers are not significantly affected by illumination in the absence of air, which suggests that degradation occurs predominantly at the interface between the interlayer and the active layer.
2.3. Degradation mechanism
To understand the effects of varying the photo-active material on the degradation at the interlayer/active layer interface under light, we fabricated films with the structure glass/ZnO/BHJ active film (10 nm) or glass/BHJ active film (10 nm), where the active thin film was PTB7:PC71BM or PBDB-T:ITIC. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the encapsulated films were recorded before and after light soaking. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PTB7:PC71BM-based films are fairly stable with only very small spectral changes after 100 h light soaking both with and without the ZnO layer; the results for the PBDB-T:ITIC films are significantly different: the absorption properties of the BHJ film on glass alone remain constant during illumination and thus the film is stable, whereas there is a decrease in mainly a region of ITIC absorption of the BHJ film on ZnO. To exclude an effect of interaction in each different blend system, we performed degradation studies of the blend systems of PBDB-T:PC71BM and PTB7:ITIC and other ITIC-based blend systems with various donor polymers. The results are shown in Fig. S2.† We found fast reduction in absorbance and molecular degradation from the thin PTB7:ITIC blend film (∼10 nm) on ZnO whereas the thin blend film on glass did not show significant degradation from the absorption spectra. These results suggest that ITIC based blend films on ZnO are degraded under light illumination for both PTB7 and PBDB-T. Furthermore, when we repeated the degradation experiment by replacing PTB7 (or PBDB-T) with P3HT, PCDTBT, and PTB7-Th, all ITIC blend films showed similar results and the blend films on ZnO exhibited fast degradation in common as shown in Fig. S3.† This suggests that the decomposition of ITIC on ZnO importantly contributes to decreased OPV device stability under illumination. Therefore, degradation occurs at the ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC interface; it is likely that the presence of ZnO induces or accelerates the decomposition of ITIC in the active layer.

(d) UV-vis absorption spectra of encapsulated ultra-thin (∼10 nm) PBDB-T film on ZnO with a various 1 sun illumination times. 
We monitored the UV-vis absorption spectra of individual films of PBDB-T and ITIC. Fig. 4b shows that the intensity of the ITIC absorption peak for the film on ZnO dramatically decreases with illumination; this degradation trend is in good agreement with that of the solar cell. These results indicate that the decreased photo-stability of the solar cell device is mainly due to the photo-degradation of the ITIC acceptor in the presence of ZnO. Interestingly, the photo-degradation of ITIC on ZnO is much reduced when light below 400 nm is cut off with an optical filter, as shown in Fig. 4c, whereas PBDB-T on ZnO is relatively stable during 1 sun illumination as shown in Fig. 4d. This result suggests that UV light plays an important role in the photo-reactions of ITIC on ZnO. Furthermore, when individual films of PBDB-T and ITIC were exposed in UV under inert conditions, only the ITIC film exhibits seriously reduced absorption as shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† We conclude that ITIC is photodegraded at the ITIC/ZnO interface, which results in less effective electron transfer from the active layer to the ZnO electron transport layer. Additionally, to confirm the influence of degraded ITIC near ZnO on charge transporting properties, we estimated electron mobility by the space-charge limited-current (SCLC) method. To form a degraded species of ITIC near ZnO, the device architecture should include ZnO as the interlayer and thus the electron only device was employed with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/Al. As shown in Fig. S6,† we found that the electron mobility of the UV-exposed device was 7.93 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the value is not much lower than that of the fresh device (8.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result indicates that degraded ITIC at the interface of ZnO under UV exposure does not seriously affect the electron transport properties of the bulk blend film. And the result could support a similar bimolecular recombination after light soaking.
In order to understand the mechanism of photo-degradation of ITIC on ZnO, we performed analyses of degraded ITIC collected from the illuminated ITIC/ZnO film. First, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the degraded ultra-thin ITIC layer were performed to investigate the mechanism of ITIC molecule degradation on the ZnO interface under UV irradiation. To procure quantities of material sufficient for the 1H NMR measurements, a large number of ultra-thin ITIC films were exposed to UV in a N2-filled glove box, dissolved in dichloromethane, concentrated, and dried under vacuum. The 1H NMR spectra of ITIC before and after exposure to 1 and 10 min UV light are shown in Fig. 5a. The integration values of the singlet peaks at 8.89 ppm (1) and 7.75 ppm (2) in the NMR spectrum of degraded ITIC both decrease and the ratios to the other aromatic protons are changed. The peaks at 8.89 and 7.75 ppm correspond to the protons of vinyl-anchored thiophene and vinyl respectively. This thiophene proton is highly deshielded because it is connected to the strongly electron-withdrawing malononitrile group by a vinyl group. The reduced peak intensities at 8.89 and 7.75 ppm suggest that the double bond in the vinyl group is broken. Simultaneously, the intensities of the aromatic proton peaks at 7.27 ppm (3) and 7.20 ppm (4) due to the hexylphenyl group reduce and four new peaks are evident at 7.73 ppm (5), 7.58 ppm (6), 7.36 ppm (7), and 7.01 ppm (8). After the vinyl group has broken, new individual proton peaks corresponding to thiophene appear at 7.36 ppm (7) and 7.01 ppm (8); the different chemical shifts of these protons are probably due to the different functional groups that are attached to the thiophene. The two peaks at 7.73 ppm (5) and 7.58 ppm (6) correspond to the aromatic protons of the hexylphenyl group and are shifted downfield from the initial chemical shift; this shift probably arises because the protons are exposed to a new environment with a lower electron density after decomposition. To confirm the breaking of the vinyl group in ITIC by UV irradiation, a sample was prepared on the KBr crystal under the same conditions as used for the NMR measurements and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed (see Fig. 5b). The FT-IR spectrum of pure ITIC in Fig. 5b contains a clear single peak at 1703 cm−1 that corresponds to unsaturated carbonyl stretching vibrations39 due to the resonance with the adjacent vinyl group. The spectra of both the samples exposed to 1 and 10 min UV light contain a new peak at 1732 cm−1 and the intensity of the unsaturated carbonyl peak at 1703 cm−1 is reduced. The new peak at 1732 cm−1 is due to saturated carbonyl stretching vibrations.39 This peak arises possibly because the double bond in the conjugated carbonyl group of ITIC is converted to a saturated carbon bond and so the delocalization of the π electrons of the CO group is reduced. Thus the breaking of the vinyl groups results in the conversion of unsaturated carbonyls to saturated carbonyls. The FT-IR spectra were normalized in the wavenumber range of 2000 to 1600 cm−1 for easy comparison and are shown in Fig. 5b. The ratios of the intensities of the saturated and unsaturated carbonyl peaks are quite similar for the 1 and 10 min UV exposures, which indicates that the breaking of the vinyl bonds is quite fast even in inert N2 gas. We conclude that the vinyl group in ITIC is photodegraded in the presence of ZnO at the active layer/ZnO interface. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed and the resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 5c. Before degradation, ITIC produces a major peak at an m/z ratio of 1427.6 as [M + H]+; the sample exposed to 10 min UV light also produces the same peak. Interestingly, the spectra of the UV-exposed samples contain several peaks in a mass range almost twice that of ITIC and the major peak arises at m/z = 2854.1. This peak arises at exactly twice the mass of ITIC, so it seems to be due to a dimer of ITIC. Moreover, many fragment peaks are present near the dimer and major ITIC peaks; these peaks correspond to structures derived from ITIC through the elimination of one end of the accepting unit (2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile; IC) or the addition of oxygen species.

The photocatalytic degradation process begins with the generation of an electron–hole (e−/h+) pair in the ZnO film under UV light irradiation.40,41 When the ZnO film is irradiated with light with an energy higher than or equal to the band gap energy, a photo-excited e− is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind an h+. The photo-generated electrons and holes can recombine and dissipate the input energy as heat, become trapped in metastable surface states, or react with other chemicals adsorbed on the ZnO surface.40,41 However, surface defect states related to oxygen vacancies are also available to trap electrons or holes.42,43 Thus, the probability of recombination is reduced and subsequent redox reactions with H2O adsorbed on the ZnO44 film can occur, which result in the formation of hydroxyl radicals (·OH).40,41,45 The hydroxyl radical can attack organic materials. According to the previous work, low-temperature and solution-processed ZnO ETLs generally have high densities of surface defects, which could adsorb oxygen and water molecules, and thus could affect long-term stability.46 To prove that hydroxyl radicals induced ITIC degradation, we performed the absorption stability experiment of ultra-thin ITIC on ZnO treated with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) toward UV exposure. A SAM on ZnO can avoid the direct contact between ZnO and ITIC and reduce the adsorbed water or oxygen molecules on ZnO.46 All of the SAM treated conditions showed a delayed absorption reduction rate by UV illumination and particularly ethanedithiol treated conditions showed a similar change to it on glass. The results are shown in Fig. S7.† Therefore, the vinyl group of enone in ITIC can undergo a radical addition reaction, which results in a product with a mass of [M + OH]+ in the MALDI-TOF spectrum; this ITIC radical intermediate can further decompose to produce other fragments, such as those with molecular weights corresponding to [M − 191]+ and [M − 176]+. Meanwhile, the ITIC radical can act as an electrophile and thus attack the enone group of another ITIC molecule; this attack leads to the formation of dimerized ITIC (diITIC; [2M + H]+), diITIC + OH, or diITIC + (OH)2. The possible degraded compounds which are detected in MALDI-TOF are shown in Fig. S8.† The decomposition of the vinyl group in ITIC breaks its conjugated structure. Thus, the decomposition of ITIC is expected to result in retarded electron transport near the ZnO/active film interface and a reduction in the effectiveness of electron transfer from ITIC to ZnO. The series resistance of fresh and degraded PBDB-T:ITIC solar cell devices was calculated from dark J–V curves in the VOC region47 and these values are 8.0 and 118.6 Ω, respectively (Fig. S9†) As a result, both significant local charge accumulation and recombination are expected near the ZnO interface, which leads to a decrease in the FF and VOC values of the PBDB-T:ITIC solar cell.48–50 We estimated the energy levels of fresh and degraded ITIC compounds by cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic voltammograms are exhibited in Fig. 5d and detailed experimental procedures and conditions are described in the ESI.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of fresh ITIC were calculated to be −5.49 and −3.91 eV, respectively. After degradation, the oxidation onset slightly shifted to a low potential and thus the HOMO energy level increased to −5.46 eV, whereas the reduction onset much shifted to a high potential and became broad and so the LUMO energy level of the degraded ITIC was −4.05 eV. This value is close to the conduction band of ZnO. The energy diagram of the ITIC-based PSC device was drawn based on cyclic voltammograms and is shown in Fig. S10.† This result indicates that degraded ITIC could disturb electron transfer to ZnO. Further, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of fresh and degraded ITIC on ZnO and the result is shown in Fig. 6. The UV-exposed ITIC film showed a decreased PL life time of 337 ps compared to that of fresh ITIC (524 ps). This result indicates that an exciton in UV-exposed ITIC undergoes a faster quenching pathway rather than radiative recombination and electron injection into ZnO. It is possible that the degraded ITIC species at the interface provide charge trap sites and thus enhance charge recombination, which results in reduced VOC and FF.

It is interesting that ITIC is much less stable with respect to photocatalytic reactions in the presence of ZnO than other donor polymers and PC71BM. PTB7, PBDB-T, and PCBM form conjugated structures based on aromatic rings, in which the π-orbitals are energetically more stable than that of a conjugated double bond structure and less vulnerable to chemical reactions.51–53 By contrast, the vinyl group of ITIC is expected to be chemically more reactive and thus more likely to undergo radical reactions with radicals such as hydroxyl radicals. Further, H2O can adsorb on ZnO surface defects and become bound relatively strongly,44,54–56 so there can be significant numbers of H2O molecules on the ZnO film even after thermal annealing at high temperatures near 200 °C.57 UV-vis absorption changes under UV exposure on ZnO were tracked for other NFAs containing the vinyl group such as IT-4F, ITIC-Th, O-IDTBR, and IEICO-4F and the chemical structures and the UV-vis absorption spectra changes are shown in Fig. S11 and S12,† respectively. All NFAs were observed to be rapidly degraded under illumination although ITIC and IEICO-4F showed relatively higher stability than the other NFAs. We conclude that in order to achieve high device stability as well as good performance, organic photoactive materials require stable aromatic structures and the absence of chemically vulnerable functional groups.
3. Conclusions
We have assessed the effects of the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC on the photo-stability of organic solar cells and determined the mechanism of degradation of ITIC-based solar cell devices under illumination. Our results show that ITIC plays a key role in the photo-degradation of PSC performance despite its contribution to solar cell efficiency. ITIC can undergo radical reactions with hydroxyl radicals that result in the breaking of the double bond that connects the electron-donating and electron-accepting units in ITIC. Thus the performance of a PBDB-T:ITIC device was reduced to one fifth of its initial value after 1000 h of operation, whereas the PTB7:PCBM-based solar cell retained more than 60% of its efficiency after 4000 h of operation. The strong burn-in losses in JSC and FF found for ITIC:PBDB-T PSCs are mainly due to the rapid photocatalytic reaction of ITIC in the presence of ZnO under illumination. Our findings have important implications for the photo-stability of high-performance non-fullerene PSCs and their degradation mechanism. Thus NFAs with chemical structures composed of energetically stable aromatic structures and minimal chemically vulnerable functional groups must be designed and synthesized. Such intrinsically stable organic materials are required for the realization of stable and high efficiency PSCs appropriate to industrial production and applications.
