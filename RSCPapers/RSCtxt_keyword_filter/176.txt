    , Accepted 3rd March 2023First published on 3rd March 2023AbstractAs a promising photovoltaic technology, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted wide attention. This work presents a systematic simulation of low bandgap formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3)-based p–n heterojunction PSCs to investigate the effects of multiple optoelectronic variations on the photovoltaic performance. The structures of the simulated devices are n–i–p, electron transport layer-free (ETL-free), hole transport layer-free (HTL-free), and inverted HTL-free. The simulation is conducted with the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D). The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) dramatically decrease when the acceptor doping density (NA) of the absorber layer exceeds 1016 cm−3. For all devices, the photovoltaic parameters dramatically decrease when the absorber defect density (Nt) is over 1015 cm−3, and the best absorber layer thickness is 1000 nm. It should be pointed out that the Nt and the interface defect layer (IDL) are the primary culprits that seriously affect the device performance. When the interfacial defect density (Nit) exceeds 1012 cm−3, PCEs begin to decline significantly. Therefore, paying attention to these defect layers is necessary to improve the PCE. Furthermore, the proper conduction band offset (CBO) between the electron transport layer (ETL) and absorber layer positively affects PSCs’ performance. These simulation results help fabricate highly efficient and environment-friendly narrow bandgap PSCs.
Introduction
As one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies, PSCs have recently attracted wide attention because of their low cost and more than 25% PCE in a single junction architecture.1–4 Among all perovskites, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) has good absorption properties, optimal bandgap, suitable carrier diffusion length, and low-cost processing, which also is one of the most widely studied and developed perovskite materials.5–8 However, toxic metals such as Pb associated with PSCs are the primary concern from an environmental perspective. Despite high efficiency, research communities and industrial circles are still more doubtful about its future, which leads to Pb-free perovskite materials. Various types of less toxic cations, such as tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), bismuth (Bi), germanium (Ge), and antimony (Sb), have been exemplified as a substitute for Pb in PSCs.9 Among these substitutes, Pb-free tin halide perovskites with ecofriendly properties, high carrier mobility, and a suitable low bandgap close to the S–Q efficiency limit are regarded as promising candidates for developing new-generation PSCs.10
Many researchers have used methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) as an absorber layer in PSCs. For example, Singh et al. have reported an optimized MASnI3-based PSCs with copper oxide (Cu2O) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and TiO2 as the ETL, which shows the highest PCE of 27.43%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.20 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.97 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 87.79%.11 This result indicates that Sn-based perovskite is one of the most potential candidates with similar electrical and optical properties compared with Pb-based perovskites. However, compared to MASnI3, FASnI3 exhibits much better temperature stability, appropriate bandgap, and marked optical properties.12 In addition, FASnI3 shows a higher charge-carrier mobility of 22 cm2 V−1 s−1, which favors efficient carrier transport. It also exhibits strong radiative bimolecular recombination rate constants and low Auger recombination as compared with MASnI3.13 This indicates that it has the potential to achieve PCE closer to the S–Q limit.
In this path, Kumar et al. also noted an optimized device FASnI3-based PSCs with a Jsc of 31.20 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.18 V.9 However, due to the easy self-oxidation of Sn2+ into Sn4+, the intrinsic carrier concentration of Sn perovskite is high, resulting in enhanced recombination losses.14 To tackle the usually poor film quality, Zhu et al. introduced trimethylthiourea (3T) to the FASnI3 films, whose bifunctional ligand significantly improves the morphology and texture of FASnI3 films by spreading and joining individual crystal grains. Accordingly, the charge-carrier lifetime of 3T-treated films reached a record high carrier lifetime of 123 ns, a Voc of 0.92 V, and a PCE of 14.0%, which is the highest certified PCE for FASnI3 PSCs at present.15 In addition, the effect of adding poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) will slow down the crystal growth, directing the crystal orientation, decreasing the trap states, and repressing the migration of the iodide ions. Meng et al. reported that the PCE of FASnI3-PVA-based PSCs could be as high as 8.9% with a reverse scan of remarkably improved Voc from 0.55 V to 0.63 V.16 Dixit et al. reported a novel inverted architecture FTO/NiO/FASnI3/C60/Au and obtained a PCE of 9.99%, a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 25.95 mA cm−2, and a FF of 80.85% by device simulation.17 Rockey et al. reported the device simulation of FASnI3-based PSCs with ZnO0.3S0.7 as an ETL. They obtained the optimized parameters, resulting in improved output parameters with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 28.12 mA cm−2, an FF of 84.96%, and thus a PCE of 25.94%.18 Furthermore, Khan et al. simplified the device's construction and promoted enhanced charge transportation by introducing the charge transport layers (CTLs)-free PSCs based on the n–p homojunction and finally obtained a PCE of 15.60% via device simulation.19
PSCs continue to close their theoretical performance limits thanks to worldwide study efforts. Mastering the PSCs’ photovoltaic properties and improving the stability may conduct this technology to bring profound changes to the energy supply industry.20 Although many researchers have used FASnI3 as an absorber layer in PSCs, there is still a significant difference between the experimental performance and the calculated value. Also, it still needs more research to determine the optimal photovoltaic performance and the related factors that affect the performance. Therefore, we investigate FASnI3-based PSCs with SnO2 as the electron transport material (ETM) and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM) via the SCAPS-1D device simulation program. The work function (WF) of front contact and metal back contact, doping densities of the absorber layer and CTLs on the device performance are investigated, respectively. This paper also looked at the contrast between n–i–p, ETL-free, HTL-free, and inverted HTL-free structures.
2. Device structure and simulation methodology
2.1 Device structure
The schematics of all the p–n heterojunction solar cells are displayed in Fig. 1. In this study, interfacial defect density (Nit) is examined using interfacial defect layer (IDL) on the photovoltaic performance. The layer configurations of the simulated devices are: SnO2 (ETL)/IDL2/FASnI3/IDL1/spiro-OMeTAD (HTL), FASnI3/IDL1/spiro-OMeTAD (HTL), SnO2 (ETL)/IDL2/FASnI3, and FASnI3/IDL2/PCBM (ETL). In the presented structures, the front contact and metal back contact materials are left to be chosen with their WF as variables. We studied the effects of the WF of the front contact and that of the back contact on the photovoltaic performance of the simulated solar cells. The most widely used substrate is transparent conducting oxide (TCO)-coated glass, including indium-doped tin oxide (ITO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), or aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). Among all the TCO glasses, ITO and FTO glass are the dominantly used substrates. The advantages of ITO glass are its high transparency and electrical conductivity. However, ITO glass has a high cost because of the rare element indium and the poor acid and thermal resistances of the ITO layer, which makes it easy to be destroyed under extreme conditions. Compared with ITO glass, FTO glass exhibits superior chemical stability and similar light transmittance and conductivity, and has always been the most widely used front electrode in PSC.21 Besides, the anode electrode can be metal or carbon electrodes with comparable WF.22 The ©DL is assumed to consider interface recombination. IDL1 and IDL2 are inserted between FASnI3/spiro-OMeTAD and ETL/FASnI3, respectively.

Besides, the electron and hole thermal velocities are set to 107 cm s−1. The various defects that are important to consider and need to be minimized to improve the device performance are examined.

Also, we set IDL1 and IDL2 neutral type defect density, energy level with respect to the reference of 0.6 eV, and characteristic energy of 0.1 eV. A comprehensive basic understanding of the defect nature in IDL is required to further improve the PSCs' performance.

Why is SnO2 being used as the ETM in this research? On the one hand, SnO2 has excellent electrical and optical properties: suitable energy level, high carrier mobility, and fine anti-reflection ability. It is currently an ideal material to replace TiO2. More than ten different methods have been explored to prepare the SnO2 layer, including the sol–gel method,30 low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) process,31 chemical bath deposition (CBD) method,32 physical vapor deposition (PVD) mothed,31 electrodeposition process,33 electron beam evaporation (E-beam) technique,34 and ball milling technology. Most high-efficiency PSCs based on SnO2 ETL are fabricated by the low-temperature sol–gel method.35 On the other hand, the high electron collection efficiency of SnO2 helps reduce or even eliminate J–V hysteresis.36 If the ETL has sufficient capacity to extract charges, it can effectively suppress interface recombination by improving charge collection at the ETL/perovskite interface and eliminating J–V hysteresis effects.
Moreover, FASnI3 is introduced as the absorber layer in this simulation study. The light absorption of the absorber layer results in the formation of electron–hole pairs. Electrons generated are then injected into the ETL because its CB or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level is lower than the CB of the absorber layer.18 Theoretical calculation shows that the antibonding coupling between Sn 5s and I 5p is weaker in FASnI3 than in MASnI3 due to the bigger ionic size of FA, conducting higher formation energies of Sn vacancies in FASnI3. This makes FASnI3 more stable. Subsequently, the conductivity of FASnI3 can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by varying its growth conditions. This mechanism explains the better performance of FASnI3-based PSCs in experiments concerning the MASnI3-based PSCs.37
Initially, the study used spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL in the n–i–p heterojunction structure PSCs as currently, most high-efficiency PSCs use spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. Interface modification engineering can improve the interface electronic quality of PSCs and the charge transfer and collection efficiency inside the device, as well as the stability of the device, so that PSCs can obtain better PCE.38 The inverted p–i–n structure is an inverted planar heterojunction structure obtained by sequentially fabricating HTL, perovskite layer, ETL, and the metal electrode on the FTO conductive glass. Unlike the n–i–p planar heterojunction PSCs, the ETM used in this inverted p–i–n PSCs is no longer an inorganic SnO2 layer but an organic fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which is widely used as the ETL in inverted PSCs.39 Yang et al. adopted mixed conjugated n-type polymeric material with PCBM to form a homogeneous bulk-mixed (HBM) continuous film with high electron mobility and suitable energy level. The PCE of PSCs based on HBM remains 80% of the initial value after 45 days under ambient air condition, which is much higher than the 48% PCE of non-HBM PSCs.40
2.2 Simulation methodology
In this theoretical study, the simulation was accomplished with the SCAPS-1D (version 3.3.10) program to formulate the FASnI3 PSCs. In the SCAPS-1D simulator, the working point specifies the parameters that are not varied in a measurement simulation and which are relevant to that measurement. Here, the temperature T is relevant for all measurements, and the value is set to 300 K. The voltage V is the dc-bias voltage in C–f simulation and QE simulation. Also, the value of V is set up to 0 V. The frequency f is the frequency at which the C–V measurement is simulated, and the f is set to 106 Hz. The user can define a solar cell as a series of layers with different properties, such as thickness, doping densities, and defect distribution. The simulator can simulate four different measurements: I–V, C–V, C–f, and QE. The voltage, frequency, and wavelength range can be set up. When performing I–V simulations under lighting conditions, the Voc is a significant value. In this simulation, the SCAPS stops the I–V simulation when the current becomes positive.
The principle of the SCAPS-1D numerical simulation is to solve the Poisson equation and continuity equations for the current under the constraints based on the input material parameters and the input structures of simulated PSCs. As a computer software, it has limited machine precision. For the simulation of semiconductors, this precision is often not enough, and care should be taken to avoid numerically unstable operations. (1) (2)
By setting the material parameters and corresponding boundary conditions, the above equations are solved with the SCAPS-1D software through numerical calculations to obtain the relevant characteristics of the PSCs. Here, φ is the potential, q is the elementary charge, n is the free electron density, p is the free hole density, ND− is the donor doping concentration, NA is the acceptor doping concentration, pt is the trap hole density, Nt is the trap electron density, Gn and Gp denote the generation of electron and hole, and Rn and Rp represent the recombination of electron and hole, respectively.
All the simulations were performed under standard AM 1.5G 1 Sun illumination. The device parameters summarized in Tables 1 and 2 are collected from published simulation works and experiments. In this work, the method of controlling variables is adopted to optimize the performance of the devices starting from the electrode WF, NA, Nt, absorber thickness, and Nit of the four structures were optimized in turn. The ND of the PCBM and the NA of the perovskite layer were also studied in the inverted HTL-free device.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The effects of the cathode and anode electrode WF
In the device, the WF of cathode and anode severely influences the energy band diagrams of PSCs and further affects the extraction of carriers of the perovskite layer.28 Thus, it was meaningful to investigate the effect of WF on the performance of PSCs firstly. The WF in solid-state physics is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the bulk of a solid to its surface. The simulation started with the parameters in Tables 1 and 2. The Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of ETL-free PSCs increased significantly when the cathode WF decreased from 4.5 eV to 4.0 eV, as shown by Tables S1, S3, S5 and S7 (ESI†). This was due to an improvement in the built-in potential (Vbi). PSCs with an ETL layer were more immune to cathode WF variation compared to ETL-free devices.
As Tables S2, S4, S6 and S8 (ESI†) show, the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE increase significantly when the WF of anode increased from 4.6 eV to 5.1 eV. This happened due to the reduction of the Schottky barrier. When the WF of anode is larger than 5.1 eV, the value becomes insignificant for the device performance and the PCEs of n–i–p and ETL-free devices no longer increase when the value more than 5.1 eV. But the PCEs of the other HTL-free PSCs will still increase after 5.1 eV. Finally, we can obtain the best performance when the WFs of anode are 5.1 eV, 5.2 eV, 5.5 eV, and 5.5 eV in four devices, and obtained PCEs of 9.14%, 20.99%, 10.52%, and 19.83%, respectively. The results indicate that the conductive material with WF more than 5.1 eV is suitable to be used as the anode. Table 3 shows the WFs of different anode materials. The different materials at anode produce different series resistance in PSCs due to different energy level alignment and conductivity.

The inconsistency between PSCs with HTL and HTL-free devices can be explained by the valence band offset (VBO) between spiro-OMeTAD and the absorber layer, which is −0.21 eV (shown in Fig. 2). This indicates that the electric field is pointing from the HTL to the anode and the holes are moving from the HTL to the anode, resulting in higher cell performance at lower WF and improved collection efficiency at the anode.42
 Fig. 2  The energy level diagram of the FASnI3-based PSC device. 
Ideally, the total built-in potential can be expressed as the difference in WF. Vbi = ϕsp − ϕsn(3)The improved Vbi gives rise to a higher built-in electric field and thus efficient photogenerated carrier collection. The improvement of photogenerated carriers leads to an increased Voc and Jsc. At 5.5 eV, Voc and Jsc get through saturation and remain unchanged above 5.5 eV with values of 0.49 V and 25.89 mA cm−2, 0.96 V and 27.98 mA cm−2, 0.49 V and 28.15 mA cm−2, and 0.88 V and 27.75 mA cm−2, respectively.
3.2 The effects of NA and ND of the absorber layer
Doping density is one of the most important parameters that affect the performance of a solar cell because it determines the built-in electric field of a solar cell as a p–n junction diode. Increasing the doping concentration of an absorber layer can increase the device PCE by reducing the series resistance and improving the charge carrier balance. Furthermore, with the increase in the doping density, the electric field inside the perovskite layer is enhanced, which promotes the separation and collection of electron–hole pairs and improves the PSCs’ performance.17 However, increasing the doping density also increases the dark current, which can limit the Voc and efficiency. Therefore, a trade-off between the device efficiency and dark current must be considered while optimizing the doping density of the absorber layer.
For n–i–p and HTL-free PSCs, when the NA of the absorber layer is above 1015 cm−3, the FF increases (Fig. 3); however, Voc and Jsc decline significantly, resulting in a reduced PCE. This is caused by the higher concentration (over 1016 cm−3), leading to an increased recombination rate, as seen in Fig. 4(a) and (c). The Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination can be defined as eqn (4) (4)where symbols n and p are the concentration of electrons and holes, respectively, and ni denotes intrinsic carrier density. When the NA of n–i–p and HTL-free structure devices exceed 1015 cm−3, the RSRH increases due to rapidly growing n and p. When NA < 1014 cm−3, the total recombination rate is similar to NA = 1014 cm−3, as shown in Fig. 4, corroborating results from Fig. 3. It is worth noting that the same trend can also be observed in the inverted HTL-free PSCs, and it demonstrates better performance when the NA is between 1011 cm−3 and 1016 cm−3.

 Fig. 4  The total recombination with varying NA of (a) n–i–p, (b) ETL-free, (c) HTL-free, and (d) inverted HTL-free devices, respectively. 
Unlike the other three structures, for ETL-free PSCs, increasing the NA from 1018 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3 results in a significant increase in Voc and FF. This is due to the increased recombination rate near the FASnI3/anode interface (Fig. 4(b)). The highest PCE was achieved at 1020 cm−3, which is difficult to achieve in practice. As the value of NA increases, the recombination rate also increases in a practical situation. However, this negative effect can be reduced by some optimization work. For instance, we can efficiently passivate the surface vacancy defects, appropriately reduce the surface long-chain organic ligands, and optimize the crystal structure. The result indicates the great potential of the FASnI3-based PSCs for ETL-free structures, although it is challenging to realize such a doping concentration.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is a basic measurement for PSC, measuring the conversion of an incident photon to an electron by the photovoltaic device. It is typically a function of the photon wavelength.43 Beyond this value, the EQE and PCE decrease (shown in Fig. S2(d), ESI†) due to less efficient carrier separation and lower Jsc. This is reflected in eqn (5) (relating to FF) and eqn (6) (relating to PCE). In eqn (5), Pmax is the maximum output power of PSCs, Jmax is the corresponding current density, and Vmax is its voltage value.44 The PCE is calculated by eqn (6), which refers to the ratio of the maximum output power of the PSCs to the input power from the light source. (5) (6)An investigation of the impact of the ND on the performance of four PSCs was conducted. Fig. 5 gives the J–V curves of the four devices as a function of the ND of the absorber layer changes from 1014 cm−3. When the ND < 1014 cm−3, the J–V curves mostly overlap with the curve of ND = 1014 cm−3. With increasing ND from 1011 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3, Voc and Jsc remained nearly constant, whereas the PCE decreased after ND exceeded 1015 cm−3 (shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). This was caused by the shrinking of the depleted region in the FASnI3, reducing carrier collection, and thus Jsc and PCE. The Voc and PCE of HTL-free and inverted p–i–n PSCs saturated at ND = 1020 cm−3 due to the improved built-in electric field at the donor/acceptor interface, leading to better exciton dissociation and higher Voc.
 Fig. 5  The J–V curves of changing ND for (a) n–i–p, (b) ETL-free, (c) HTL-free, and (d) inverted HTL-free devices, respectively. 
We fixed ND to 1011 cm−3 and obtained optimal PCEs of 8.11%, 18.97%, 10.06%, and 17.33%. However, the n-type doping of FASnI3 yielded inferior performance compared to p-type doping in n–i–p, HTL-free, and inverted HTL-free PSCs. Li et al. found that FASnI3 single crystals show n-type semiconductor behavior with ND from 1011 cm−3 to 1014 cm−3, and the FASnI3 polycrystalline film presents p-type conductivity because of the low formation energies of Sn vacancies and the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Since Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ to cause Sn vacancies, which acts as an acceptor dopant within the material in the “self-doping” process, it is necessary to add excess Sn2+ to fill the vacancies. Excessive Sn2+ is mainly introduced by adding SnX2 (X = F, Cl, Br). Currently, the most widely used SnF2 can improve the formation energy of Sn vacancies. However, SnF2 doping is superior to SnF4 doping in preserving the photovoltaic performance of FASnI3. In addition, SnF2-doped FASnI3 maintained a smaller hole-effective mass than SnF4-doped FASnI3.45–47 Adding Sn4+ ion into FASnI3 perovskite as a shallow acceptor energy level can recede the optical absorption properties. Moreover, adding Sn2+ into FASnI3 with a suitable proportion improved the photovoltaic properties of FASnI3. Sn4+ doping showed a negative effect, while Sn2+ doping showed a favorable impact in boosting the performance of the FASnI3 perovskite. Finally, the acceptor doping of FASnI3 with NA of 1015 cm−3, 1020 cm−3, 1015 cm−3, and 1016 cm−3 yielded PCEs of 9.38%, 22.51%, 10.67%, and 19.70%, respectively.
The effects of the bulk defect density of the absorber layer (Nt)
The Nt of the absorber layer in a PSC device has a significant influence on device performance. Most of the bulk defects are produced during the fabrication process, and they can interfere with the charge carrier transport in the absorber layer. High Nt can reduce the number of charge carriers that can be transported, leading to a decrease in the device performance. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the Nt is kept as low as possible to maximize the device performance.
To investigate the effect of the Nt on the device performances, a neutral type of defect is introduced for the absorber layer with Gaussian energetic distribution and characteristic energy of 0.1 eV. As shown in Fig. 6, the value of Nt is a significant affecting factor in the PSCs' photovoltaic performance. For the ETL-free and inverted HTL-free PSCs, when Nt < 1014 cm−3, the PSCs’ photovoltaic performance remains almost unchanged with the variation of Nt and starts to drop significantly when Nt > 1015 cm−3. The Voc, Jsc, and FF dramatically decreased when Nt > 1015 cm−3, causing the PCEs of PSCs to drop. For the n–i–p and HTL-free PSCs, the impact threshold of Nt is up to 1016 cm−3.
 Fig. 6  (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF, and (d) PCE as the function of Nt in four devices. 
When the Nt of n–i–p and HTL-free PSCs is over 1016 cm−3 or the Nt of ETL-free and inverted HTL-free is over 1014 cm−3, the recombination rate in the bulk layer increases to over 1020 cm−3 s−1, resulting in a decrease in Voc and Jsc (Fig. 7). With increasing Nt from 1011 cm−3 to 1018 cm−3, the total recombination rate also increases gradually. Above Nt of 1018 cm−3, the change in the recombination rate is negligible. Our results follow the report of Jannat et al., which explains that less Nt can reduce recombination because of long diffusion length and improved carrier lifetime, and thus efficient carrier collection.48 The following equations can explain the principle. (7) (8) (9)where τ is the carrier lifetime, σ is the carrier capture cross section, Nt is the absorber defect density, Vth is the thermal velocity, D is the diffusion coefficient, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the carrier diffusion length.19,27 If the defect density decreases, the carrier lifetime increases, and longer diffusion length and less recombination are observed. The enlargement of Nt causes a shortening of L. The L value of smaller Nt is larger than the thickness of the absorber layer, and the effect of Nt on Jsc is small. The Nyquist plot with different Nt of four PSCs is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The plot represents the real and imaginary impedance of the simulated PSCs.
 Fig. 7  The total recombination of changing Nt for (a) n–i–p, (b) ETL-free, (c) HTL-free, and (d) inverted HTL-free devices, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the change in EQEs is no longer noticeable when Nt < 1015 cm−3. This explains why its effect on the PSCs’ performance is almost negligible when Nt < 1015 cm−3. On the other hand, eqn (6) indicates why the increase in Nt causes the deterioration of Voc. (10)where Jsc is the photogenerated current, J0 is the dark saturation current, and the recombination determines J0. Because Nt acts as the recombination site, increasing the value of Nt will lead to more considerable recombination, causing a lower Voc.
Moreover, the considerable interface contact resistance caused by the interface defect may result in losses of Voc.24 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows Nyquist plots of four PSCs with different Nt, which was used to calculate resistance and obtain their equivalent electrical circuits. The n–i–p device has the lowest Rct (∼350 Ω) when Nt is 1019 cm−3, while the HTL-free device's Rct increases to 650 Ω under the same conditions. The inverted HTL-free PSCs has the highest Rct (∼1600 Ω) when Nt = 1020 cm−3, which reduces the charge transport to the relevant electrode.
Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the PSCs’ photovoltaic performance and the Nt. When the Nt > 1019 cm−3, the photovoltaic performance is significantly decreased because the photogenerated carriers are not separated efficiently, thus producing a poor EQE less than 20% in the 300 to 900 nm wavelength range (shown in Fig. S6, ESI†) and a deteriorative Jsc (Fig. 6(b)).
These simulation results suggest that optimizing Nt to approximately 1015 cm−3 is important for creating high-performance p–n heterojunction PSCs. The optimal values for this layer were selected as 1012 cm−3 for n–i–p, ETL-free, HTL-free PSCs and 1013 cm−3 for inverted HTL-free PSCs as an ideal circumstance, and optimal PCEs of 9.52%, 24.96%, 10.81%, and 20.34% were obtained.
The effects of thickness of the absorber layer
The performance of a PSC is influenced by the thickness of the absorber layer in a variety of ways. In general, larger PCE results from thicker absorber layers. This is so that more light can be collected and turned into power by an absorber layer that is thicker. Further increasing the efficiency are larger absorber layers, which can offer better charge collecting and prevent charge recombination. On the other side, thicker absorber layers may potentially result in greater heat absorption, which would reduce the efficiency as a result of thermal losses. Finding the ideal absorber layer thickness for each PSC is crucial to maximizing its effectiveness.
As a result, we adjust the perovskite absorber's thickness between 100 and 1000 nm. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows that the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCEs of all four types of devices rise when the absorber thickness rises from 100 nm to 1000 nm. The performance of the PSCs does not change much if the thickness is further raised. This conclusion may be explained by the fact that when the thickness rises, the rate of light absorption rises as well, improving the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. However, it has been discovered that the PSCs' performance still does not peak when the thickness approaches 3000 nm because of the low Nt and Nit. Consider the n–i–p PSCs in this scenario, with Nt and Nit set to 1017 cm−3. The optimal PCE shortens to 5.4% and starts decreasing when the thickness is over 200 nm. This inconsistency is because the poor quality of the absorber layer increases the recombination rate. The result is in accordance with the studies of Shukla et al.14 In the case of thicker absorber PSCs, the charge carriers generated near the center of the absorber layer will recombine when the absorber thickness exceeds the diffusion length.49 The cost of the fabric also goes up due to the thicker absorber layer. Because it is crucial to take into account all photovoltaic factors when deciding on the ideal absorber thickness, 1000 nm was chosen as the ideal value for the absorber layer in all the devices. Finally, we obtained PCEs of 10.74%, 30.12%, 11.36%, and 21.47% for the four devices.
3.5 The effects of IDL
An interface between any two semiconductor layers in any actual solar cells can be introduced, and recombination centers can be present at an IDL as in a bulk layer. The definition of interface defects is remarkably analogous to bulk defects. The interfaces between the CTLs and perovskite layer are among the most critical factors in determining the PSCs’ performance and stability.50 Recombination through interface states is modeled by Pauwels–Vanhoutte theory.51 The purpose of using bulk defects and interface defects is to make the device more realistic.52
In this study, we introduced neutral type defect density with energy level with respect to the reference of 0.6 eV and characteristic energy of 0.1 eV in IDL. The bulk and interface defect optimizations of the absorber are carried out through the modulation of the defect energy level and defect density.53 Defects were considered to be “Single” in this simulation. The equations that describe defect properties are as follows. Range of single defect: [Et; Et](11) Nt(E) = Ntot × δEt(12) (13)Here, Et is the energy level (trap level), Nt (E) is defect density, Ei is the intrinsic level, Ev is the VB level, and Ntot is the total density. The energy level is defined with respect to a reference energy level. The reference energy levels are above Ev, below EC (below the CB level), and above Ei. We set the reference energy level of IDL as above the highest Ev and then studied the effects of the Nit.
As shown in Fig. 8, for n–i–p and HTL-free PSCs, due to the numerical limitations of the SCAPS-1D program, the Nit of the FASnI3/SnO2 interface is lower than 1012 cm−3, there will exist convergence failures due to extreme numerical conditions. To obtain a rational and optimized photovoltaic performance, the Nit of the FASnI3/SnO2 interface of n–i–p and ETL-free PSCs are designed from 1012 cm−3 to 1017 cm−3, and the Nit of HTL-free and inverted HTL-free PSCs are from 108 cm−3. The Nyquist plot of PSCs shows a smaller semicircle diameter and lower charge-transfer resistance when Nit is larger than 1014 cm−3, indicating better stability (Fig. S8, ESI†).
 Fig. 8  (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF, and (d) PCE as the function of Nit in four devices. 
For the n–i–p device, the Nit of IDL1 had no effect on the device performance when it exceeds 1013 cm−3 or <1010 cm−3 and improved performance when decreases from 1013 cm−3 to 1010 cm−3. Compared with IDL1, IDL2 has a more pronounced effect on the device performance, which is depicted in the inset of Fig. 9(a). For the ETL-free device, Nit > 109 cm−3 had little effect on the photovoltaic performance, with Nit < 109 cm−3, resulting in increased Jsc, Voc, and efficiency. The HTL-free device was similar to n–i–p, with an Nit of 1012 cm−3, resulting in a Voc of 0.64 V, a Jsc of 31.04 mA cm−2, a FF of 82.26%, and a PCE of 16.26%. For the inverted HTL-free device, with the increase in the Nit, the photovoltaic performance will deteriorate before the value up to 1015 cm−3. Moreover, it will almost not affect the PSCs’ performance after Nit > 1015 cm−3. As a result, the optimized parameter is set to 1010 cm−3 and a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 30.92 mA cm−2, an FF of 87.73%, and a PCE of 28.83% were obtained.
 Fig. 9  The J–V curves with different Nit for (a) n–i–p, (b) ETL-free, (c) HTL-free, and (d) inverted HTL-free devices, respectively. 
Decreasing Nit leads to a significant improvement in the EQE (Fig. S9, ESI†). It is concluded that improving the FASnI3/SnO2 or FASnI3/PCBM interface quality boosts the PSCs' photovoltaic performance by reducing traps at the recombination centers (Fig. S10, ESI†). Our study provides optimization directions for experiments, though reducing Nit to 1010 cm−3 is difficult.
3.6 The effects of other parameters
We also studied the effects of relative dielectric permittivity of the perovskite absorber layer and the thickness of the carrier transport layer. It is not shown in the figures because it does not cause a significant difference in performance. In comparison, the ND of the ETL and the NA of the absorber layer both affect the PSCs’ performance. Hence, we studied the effect of these two parameters on the device performance, as shown in Fig. 10, which is a three-dimensional plot of the inverted HTL-free PSCs’ photovoltaic performance concerning the ND of the ETL and the NA of the absorber layer.
 Fig. 10  (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF, and (d) PCE when modifying the ND of ETL and the NA of the perovskite absorber layer in the inverted HTL-free device. 
As shown in Fig. 10, when the ND of the ETL < 1015 cm−3, the PCE > 29% and this value is no longer affected by the NA concentration. When the NA is set to 1018 cm−3, the lowest PCE value of 27.12% is obtained. It is mainly affected by the NA concentration in the absorber layer, and the ND in ETL has little effect. As the NA of the perovskite layer decreases, the Voc decreases from 1.26 V to 1.06 V, and the Jsc decreases from 31.05 mA cm−2 to 26.57 mA cm−2. At the same time, the FF is nearly unchanged. The optimized performance in inverted HTL-free PSCs is a PCE of 29.10%, a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 31.04 mA cm−2, and an FF of 88.33%. Finally, the initial and optimized J–V characteristics of n–i–p, ETL-free, HTL-free, and inverted HTL-free devices are depicted in Fig. 11 with every step.
 Fig. 11  The J–V curves of initial parameters and optimized each parameter of (a) n–i–p, (b) ETL-free, (c) HTL-free, and (d) inverted HTL-free devices, respectively. 
The PCEs of SnO2/FASnI3/spiro-OMeTAD and SnO2/FASnI3 PSCs are lower than those of the FASnI3/spiro-OMeTAD and FASnI3/PCBM counterparts due to the energy level of the SnO2 layer not being in alignment with that of FASnI3 (−0.4 eV CBO). The negative CBO is beneficial for electron transport to ETL from the absorber layer due to the formation of the energy cliffs between the absorber layer and ETL. Correspondingly, a small cliff is beneficial, but a large cliff improves the interfacial recombination, leading to a deterioration of the photovoltaic performance.54 To prove this point, we finally investigated the effect of the ETL electron affinity on the n–i–p PSCs’ performance. From Fig. S11 (ESI†), when the ETL electron affinity of n–i–p PSCs is reduced to 3.6 eV, we can obtain a PCE of 29.94%, a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 31.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 87.01%.
In Table 4, the present simulation results are compared with that of the other articles. The best PCE observed in this study for this type of configuration is 30.12%. It can be seen that when the absorber layers are FASnI3, the PSCs of ZnO as ETL exhibit a higher PCE than that of TiO2 and SnO2 as ETL. When the ETL is identical, the PCE of the n–i–p PSCs is higher than that of the HTL-free PSCs. When the CTLs are the same, regardless of the structure, using FASnI3 as the absorber layer performs better than its MASnI3 counterparts. At the same time, the appropriate CBO between the absorber layer and the ETL also positively affects the photovoltaic performance.55–57

Conclusion
In summary, a numerical analysis is brought out in this study to determine the optimum conditions for FASnI3-based p–n heterojunction PSCs. We proposed SnO2/FASnI3/spiro-MeOTAD, FASnI3/spiro-MeOTAD, SnO2/FASnI3, and FASnI3/PCBM PSCs, which were simulated by the SCAPS-1D program and the parameters were optimized to gain higher performance. Across the simulation outcomes and optimization processes, several factors, such as the electrode metal WF, absorber doping density, Nt, Nit, and absorber thickness, that can influence the performance of the PSCs have been comprehensively investigated and optimized for better performance. Firstly, better performance can be achieved by increasing the anode WF and decreasing the cathode WF. As the NA of n–i–p, HTL-free, and inverted p–i–n PSCs increase from 1011 cm−3 to 1015 cm−3, the EQEs of PSCs are enhanced, causing an increase in Jsc, and Jsc begins to drop after NA exceeds 1016 cm−3. Our work also indicated the great potential of ETL-free PSCs. Moreover, we should pay more attention to Nt and Nit. Optimizing Nt below 1015 cm−3 is crucial for improving Voc and Jsc because less Nt can reduce the recombination and long diffusion length, improving carrier lifetime and efficient carrier collection. It is found that the higher the defect concentration, the thinner the optimal thickness. As Nt decreases to 1012 cm−3, the optimized thickness increases to 1000 nm. Furthermore, when the defect density of the IDL is too high, the asymmetry effect will appear. The IDL2 between ETL/FASnI3 has more effect than the IDL1 between HTL/FASnI3. Hence, we should pay more attention to the optimization of IDL2. As a result, the optimal PCEs obtained from the FASnI3-based PSCs are 16.10%, 30.12%, 16.26%, and 29.10% (corresponding to the above PSCs). The suitable CBOs between the ETL and the absorber layer in n–i–p and HTL-free devices are crucial for better performance. Finally, we list Sn-based PSCs with different device structures for reference and provide new ideas for PSCs in the future.
