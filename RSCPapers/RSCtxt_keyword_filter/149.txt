    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 9th May 2023AbstractTin (Sn)-based perovskites are very promising for the fabrication of low-toxicity lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but they suffer from easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ which leads to poor performance. Herein, we report a facile solution method for the purification of SnI2 in Sn-based PSCs by toluene washing. We found that toluene can dissolve undesired SnI4 and retain the SnI2 source, which enabled us to fabricate efficient Sn-based PSCs with much-reduced harmful Sn4+ impurities. The as-prepared formamidinium tin iodide perovskite films have markedly improved film morphology, enhanced crystalline quality, increased carrier lifetime, etc. Ultimately, the best-performing solar cell obtained using toluene-purified SnI2 precursors delivers a promising power conversion efficiency of 10.70% and the efficiency even increases to 11.06% after nearly one month of storage in an N2 atmosphere. This work paves a facile way for overcoming the complicated purification of SnI2 for efficient Sn-based PSCs.
Introduction
Ever since perovskites were applied in solar cells as light absorbers in 2009, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed rapidly in the field of photovoltaics and the efficiency of lead (Pb)-based PSCs has reached 25.7% (certified) to date,1–6 which is comparable with the highest efficiency of silicon solar cells.7 However, the toxicity of Pb element in Pb-based PSCs remains one of the main concerns for their future commercialization8–10 and some alternative elements have been proposed to replace Pb, such as bismuth (Bi),11 copper (Cu),12 antimony (Sb),13 and tin (Sn).14 Among them, Sn-based perovskites have low toxicity, suitable and adjustable bandgaps, and high carrier mobilities and light absorption coefficients, which make them the most promising candidates for the development of efficient low-toxicity Pb-free PSCs.15–17
Nevertheless, Sn has a tendency to be easily oxidized from Sn2+ to Sn4+, which leads to p-type self-doping, severe non-radiative recombination, and therefore poor device performance of Sn-based PSCs.18 In order to alleviate the oxidation of Sn2+, many strategies have been developed, including additive engineering,19 surface passivation engineering,20,21 and so on.22,23 In 2012, Kanatzidis and co-workers added SnF2 into cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3) perovskite hole conductors and achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.2% for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.24 Since then, SnF2 has been widely used as an additive in Sn-based PSCs and has accomplished many achievements.25 For example, Kumar et al. used SnF2 as an additive in CsSnI3 PSCs. The addition of SnF2 inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+, resulting in a lowered concentration of p-type self-doping and avoiding a short circuit of the regular-structured devices.25 In 2016, Yan and coworkers added SnF2 into formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) precursor solutions and realized efficient solar cells with a PCE of 6.22%.26 In 2017, Gu et al. added Sn powder into perovskite precursor solutions to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+, leading to an improved PCE of 6.75%.27 Later, Ke et al. demonstrated a three-dimensional (3D) hollow structure by using an ethylenediammonium diiodide (enI2 or EDAI2) additive in FASnI3 perovskites. The use of EDAI2 and the formation of the 3D hollow structure significantly reduced the trap-state density and yielded regular-structured solar cells with a much enhanced PCE of 6.63%.28–30 In 2020, Han and co-workers introduced liquid formic acid (LFA) as a reducing solvent into FASnI3 perovskite precursor solutions. Unlike solid reducing additives, LFA is a volatile solvent, so there was no residual LFA in the final FASnI3 perovskite films after thermal annealing. FASnI3 films with high crystallinity and reduced Sn4+ were successfully obtained by this method.31 Recently, Wang et al. introduced halogen ions and phenylhydrazine ions into Sn-based perovskite precursor solutions, in which phenyl groups can block the entry of water and oxygen from the environment into perovskites, and hydrazine groups with reducing properties can repair tin vacancy defects in perovskites, giving solar cells which have a PCE of 13.40%.32 In 2021, Ning and co-workers adopted coordinated SnI2·(DMSO)x (dimethyl sulfoxide: DMSO) adducts in precursor solutions that were beneficial for improving the electron diffusion length and crystal orientation of FASnI3 perovskites. The resulting champion device realized a certified PCE of 14.6%.33 More recently, Zhao and coworkers introduced EDABr2 as an additive into FASnI3 precursor solutions, which could efficiently passivate Sn vacancies and reduce the concentration of background carriers, leading to solar cells with a decent PCE of 14.23%.34 The mentioned reports have been mainly focused on the strategies of perovskite solutions. Few studies have been done on their initial SnI2 sources and some methods have had to use a complex process. Therefore, it is very desirable to develop a simple and low-cost method for the purification of SnI2, which would be meaningful for the future fabrication of efficient Sn-based PSCs.
Herein, we develop an ingenious solution method for purifying SnI2 to obtain efficient Sn-based PSCs. The strategy just uses toluene to wash unpurified SnI2 powder and can remove the unwanted SnI4 impurities and retain the pure SnI2 source because of the large solubility difference between these two materials in toluene. Supported by the characterization, it can be observed that the content of Sn4+ is significantly reduced in the Sn-based perovskite films obtained using the SnI2 source with toluene washing and the as-fabricated perovskite films have a greatly increased lifetime. As compared with the devices employing crude SnI2, FASnI3 solar cells using toluene-purified SnI2 precursors have indeed improved VOC and FF, giving the highest PCE of 10.70%. This value can even increase to 11.06% after nearly one month of storage, showing good stability of the devices. This study provides a facile strategy for SnI2 purification by using toluene washing to enhance the PCEs of FASnI3 solar cells with significantly reduced Sn4+ impurities.
Results and discussion
We fabricated FASnI3 perovskite films using commercial (the control one), air-oxidized SnI2, and toluene-purified SnI2 precursor sources via a one-step antisolvent dropping method. The corresponding preparation processes of FASnI3 perovskite films fabricated from various SnI2 precursor sources are illustrated in Fig. 1a and S1.† For the preparation of air-oxidized SnI2, commercial SnI2 powder was placed in an ambient environment with a humidity level of around 40% for one week. After oxidization, the initial dark red commercial SnI2 powder turned into an orange-red powder, indicating that some of the SnI2 was oxidized to SnI4, as shown in Fig. 1a. We could then use toluene to wash the oxidized SnI2 and remove the undesired SnI4 impurities. This is because SnI2 is almost insoluble in toluene, while SnI4 can be easily dissolved in it. As displayed in Fig. 1b, 20 mg of SnI2 and SnI4 were separately added into toluene. It is apparent that the solution with SnI2 was still colorless and the SnI2 powder settled at the bottom of the solution. In contrast, the toluene solution with SnI4 turned from colorless to yellow and all SnI4 disappeared, indicating that the SnI4 was fully dissolved in toluene. Therefore, it would be feasible to remove SnI4 from the oxidized SnI2 by washing the powder. As indicated in Fig. 1a, the color of the oxidized SnI2 powder turned from orange-red to bright red after toluene washing, implying that SnI4 impurities in the oxidized SnI2 were successfully removed. To confirm this, we also conducted XRD measurements on the control SnI2, oxidized SnI2, and purified SnI2. As presented in Fig. S2,† the initial SnI2 (control) consisted mainly of SnI2 but also included SnI4.35 After oxidation, the XRD intensity of SnI4 increased, indicating that some of the SnI2 was oxidized to SnI4. However, after toluene washing, the diffraction patterns of SnI4 disappeared.

(c) Photograph of perovskite precursor solutions prepared using commercial (control), oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2 powders. 
To check the effect of toluene washing on perovskite film properties, we then prepared FASnI3 perovskite precursor solutions using commercial SnI2, oxidized SnI2, and toluene-washed SnI2. 1 mol% of EDABr2 was added into all solutions, followed by our previous studies.28 As shown in Fig. 1c, the oxidized SnI2-based precursor solution was dark yellow and very turbid, indicating that the by-products of Sn2+ oxidization were also introduced into the precursor. In comparison, both the solutions prepared from commercial SnI2 and toluene-washed SnI2 were clear and bright yellow, implying that the impurities were successfully removed from the oxidized SnI2 powder by toluene washing.27,36 The photographs of FASnI3 perovskite films fabricated from different precursors can be found in Fig. S3.† It seems that the oxidized SnI2-fabricated FASnI3 film had a coffee ring in the center of the film,37,38 while the film obtained using toluene-washed SnI2 was more uniform, which can be further confirmed by the following morphology characterization.

Fig. 2a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the FASnI3 film fabricated with control SnI2, which had a uniform and pinhole-free morphology. Meanwhile, the oxidized SnI2-prepared FASnI3 film had some pinholes and blurry grain boundaries (Fig. 2b), which might be attributed to the presence of Sn4+ leading to the fast crystallization of the film. By contrast, the toluene-purified SnI2-fabricated film was more compact and homogeneous, showing a much better film surface morphology (Fig. 2c).39–41 Fig. S4† also shows the roughness of the three types of films obtained via atomic-force microscope (AFM) measurements. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the films fabricated from the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2 were 18.1, 19.8, and 14.8 nm respectively, indicating that the toluene-washed SnI2-based film had the smoothest surface, which is consistent with the SEM measurements.40

XPS spectra of (g) control, (h) oxidized, and (i) toluene-washed SnI2-based FASnI3 films. 

Fig. 2d shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of these three types of films. It can be seen that the film obtained using the toluene-washed SnI2 precursor had the highest absorption intensity because it had the best film quality and lowest defect density, as compared with the other two samples. This could be confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2e, the average carrier lifetime of the film based on toluene-washed SnI2 (1.69 ns) was longer than that of the control (1.41 ns) and oxidized SnI2 (0.46 ns)-based ones, implying markedly reduced non-radiative recombination in the film based on toluene-purified SnI2.42 All three types of films have a similar bandgap of 1.42 eV, which was estimated from the EQE plots shown in Fig. S5.†
In addition to optical properties, the different films also had very different crystalline qualities. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films obtained using control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2 are given in Fig. 2f. We observed that all three types of films had four main diffraction peaks, which could be assigned to (100), (102), (200), and (211) crystal planes.28,43,44 However, the film obtained using toluene-washed SnI2 had the strongest XRD patterns among the three types of films, indicating that this film had the best crystalline quality.39 We further performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to estimate the content of Sn4+ in the final films. As shown in Fig. 2g–i, all the films presented an Sn main peak, which could be divided into one subpeak at a low energy range assigned to Sn5/22+ and the other one at a high energy range assigned to Sn3/24+. Accordingly, we could estimate that the area percentages of Sn4+ in the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2-based FASnI3 films were 22.06, 28.77, and 12.53 area%, respectively. Therefore, the film based on toluene-washed SnI2 had the lowest amount of Sn4+ impurities, which can trap photon-generated carriers and should be avoided.45 The above results prove that the use of high-purity SnI2 could improve the film morphology, optical properties, and crystalline quality, and decrease the content of detrimental Sn4+ impurities, all of which are highly related to solar cell performance.
Encouraged by the superior properties of the films fabricated with toluene-purified SnI2, we then investigated their effects on practical solar cell performance. A device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI3 perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag was adopted in solar cells, as shown in Fig. 3a. A cross-sectional SEM image of a representative FASnI3 solar cell fabricated from toluene-purified SnI2 is given in Fig. S6.† It illustrates that the perovskite film was homogeneous and pinhole-free, and was sandwiched between a poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer and a fullerene (C60) electron transport layer. The thickness of perovskite films was about 200 nm. Fig. 3b shows representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2-based PSCs, which were measured by forward voltage scans under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). It could be found that the PSC obtained using oxidized SnI2 showed a very low PCE of 6.12% with a VOC of 0.48 V, a JSC of 20.33 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.15%. The poor performance could be mainly attributed to detrimental Sn4+ byproducts in the oxidized SnI2 precursor that caused too many defects as well as too many pinholes in the perovskite films. After purifying the oxidized SnI2, the as-fabricated PSC showed a much improved PCE of 10.76% with a VOC of 0.60 V, a JSC of 23.21 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.57%, which was even higher than that of the control one obtained using commercial SnI2. The control one only achieved a PCE of 9.81% with a VOC of 0.57 V, a JSC of 22.77 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.39%. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 3c also confirmed their JSC trend. The integrated JSC values of the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2-based PSCs were 22.83, 20.53, and 23.06 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements (Fig. 3b) and agreed with the UV-vis absorption results (Fig. 2d). The performance of the three types of solar cells also had good reproducibility. Fig. 3d gives PCE statistics of thirty solar cells made using different SnI2 sources. The solar cells employing control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2 had average PCEs of 9.13 ± 0.14%, 5.33 ± 0.12%, and 10.56 ± 0.10%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the toluene purification of SnI2 could dramatically improve solar cell performance with greatly improved VOC, JSC, FFs, and therefore PCEs. We also examined the devices using toluene-washed SnI2 with different oxidation times. Fig. S7† shows that the solar cells using toluene-washed SnI2 with one day of oxidization gave the best performance.

Fig. 4a displays the J–V curves of the best-performing PSC employing toluene-purified SnI2 measured under different voltage scan directions. The cell delivered a PCE of 11.06% (10.23%) with a VOC of 0.60 V (0.58 V), a JSC of 23.46 mA cm−2 (23.38 mA cm−2), and an FF of 78.14% (74.30%) when measured under a forward (reverse) scan. Fig. 4b shows the EQE spectrum of the corresponding solar cell. The integrated JSC of the cell was 23.07 mA cm−2, agreeing well with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements shown in Fig. 4a. Simultaneously, the same device also exhibited a decent stabilized efficiency of 10.30% at a bias voltage of 0.50 V, as shown in Fig. 4c. More importantly, the as-made solar cells also showed good stability. We measured the long-term shelf storage stability of an unencapsulated toluene-washed SnI2-based PSC, which was stored in an N2-filled glovebox at room temperature in the dark (Fig. 4d). Remarkably, the device could maintain 96% of its initial PCE after 3068 h of storage. For comparison, the control and oxidized SnI2-based devices could only retain 82% and 66% of their initial values after 1316 h and 596 h of storage, respectively, as presented in Fig. S8.† The results can prove that the toluene-washing method for the purification of SnI2 could substantially improve both efficiency and stability of the Sn-based PSCs.

To further understand the mechanisms behind the performance enhancements, we performed dark J–V measurements to compare carrier recombination in the devices. Fig. 5a displays the dark J–V curves of the three types of devices, which could be used to evaluate the dark-saturated current density (J0) and leakage current of the devices, showing a huge difference among them. J0 can be determined using the following equation:46 (1)where q is the elementary charge, T is the temperature, and J is the current density, n is the diode ideality factor, and Kb is the Boltzmann constant. After calculations, the J0 of the toluene-washed SnI2-fabricated PSC was about 1.140 × 10−5 mA cm−2, which was much lower than that (5.118 × 10−5 mA cm−2) of the PSC based on oxidized SnI2 and also lower than that (1.864 × 10−4 mA cm−2) of the control device. The device employing toluene-washed SnI2 had the lowest J0 and leakage current, which could be mainly attributed to the greatly reduced background carrier density and non-radiative recombination, therefore leading to much improved FF and VOC of the devices.29,47,48

(d) SCLC plots of hole-only devices using the control, oxidized, and purified SnI2-fabricated perovskite films with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/P3HT/Au. 
We also performed capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements to explore the potential effects of SnI2 purification on built-in potential (Vbi) and carrier transport of the devices (Fig. 5b) using the following Mott–Schottky (M–S) equation:49 (2)where V is the applied voltage, εr is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electron charge, Na is the carrier concentration, Kb is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. According to eqn (2), the Vbi of the device using toluene-washed SnI2 could be estimated to be 0.44 V, which was higher than the 0.41 V of the control device and 0.36 V of the oxidized-SnI2 based one. The toluene-washed SnI2-based device with the highest Vbi had the largest driving force for photogenerated carrier separation, thereby inhibiting the formation of trap states and reducing VOC losses accordingly.50,51

Fig. 5c presents the carrier recombination characteristics of the three types of PSCs by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. As compared with the other two devices, the toluene-washed SnI2-based device had a higher recombination resistance (Rrec) and a lower recombination rate, demonstrating that the purification of SnI2 could suppress the carrier recombination within the devices.52–54 The results could also be confirmed by light intensity-dependent VOC measurements. Fig. S9† shows the VOC of the devices under different light intensities. The corresponding ideality factor (n) of the devices can be determined using the following equation (eqn (3)):55 (3)where Kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, I is the light intensity, and I0 is the initial light intensity. The n value of the toluene-washed SnI2-prepared PSC was 1.23, which was lower than the 1.26 of the pristine device and 1.59 of the oxidized SnI2-based one, indicating that the device fabricated from toluene-washed SnI2 had the lowest carrier recombination, consistent with the EIS results.
To further prove the reduction of trap-state density (ntrap) in toluene-washed SnI2-based devices, we then performed dark J–V measurements of hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/poly(3-hexylthiophene)/Au. The ntrap values of perovskite films can be estimated using the following equation (eqn (4)):56 (4)where εr is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap filled limit voltage, and L is the perovskite film thickness. The VTFL values of the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2-fabricated devices were around 0.60 V, 0.95 V, and 0.51 V, respectively. Accordingly, the ntrap of the control, oxidized, and toluene-washed SnI2-fabricated perovskite films could be calculated to be 6.70 × 1015 cm−3, 1.06 × 1016 cm−3, and 5.69 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The results indicated that the perovskite films made from purified SnI2 had the lowest trap-state density because of their best film quality. On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the utilization of toluene-washing purification of SnI2 is a very effective strategy for the fabrication of high-quality Pb-free Sn-based perovskite films and the resulting efficient solar cells. We can also anticipate that this facile method could be applied in not only a Pb-free Sn-based system but also its neighbors, such as narrow-bandgap Pb–Sn alloy PSCs and their tandem solar cells.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple strategy of toluene washing for SnI2 purification, which enables high-quality Sn-based perovskite films and efficient solar cells. We found that the use of toluene-purified SnI2 precursors in perovskite films could give rise to improved optical properties, enhanced crystalline quality, reduced non-radiative recombination, and lowered defect state density of the perovskite films. As a result, the best-performing solar cell employing toluene-washed SnI2 achieved a promising PCE of 10.70% and the PCE even increased to 11.06% after nearly one month of storage. The unencapsulated device also showed good stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 3068 hours of storage in an N2 atmosphere. This study provides a facile strategy for SnI2 purification via toluene washing, which would be applicable to the future fabrication of efficient PSCs requiring high-purity Sn2+ sources.

All the commercial materials were used without further purification.
Purification method
The purified SnI2 powder was obtained by the following methods. The commercial SnI2 powder was exposed to ambient air for oxidization for one week. Then, air-oxidized SnI2 powder was added into 5 mL of toluene and stirred for 30 min, and then filtered to obtain moist SnI2. The above washing process was repeated three times and then the resulting SnI2 was kept onto a hotplate in an N2-filled glovebox at 60 °C to dry for 12 hours before use.
Device preparation
Before film deposition, the etched ITO glass substrates were cleaned by detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. After drying with an N2 stream, the ITO substrates were exposed to ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. Then, a PEDOT:PSS solution was coated on ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. After annealing, the substrates were immediately transferred to an N2-filled glovebox with controlled H2O and O2 levels (<0.1 ppm, <0.1 ppm). A 0.9 M control perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving SnF2, GeI2, FAI, SnI2 (commercial or air-oxidized or toluene-washed SnI2), and EDABr2 at a molar ratio of 0.10:0.05:1.00:1.00:0.01 in a mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v:v). All the films were deposited on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates by a one-step spin-coating process: hold at 4000 rpm for 50 s and drop 400 mL CB at the 20th second to form wet perovskite films after spin coating. After that, the prepared perovskite films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. The films were then post-annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. Finally, solar cells were completed under a high vacuum system (<4 × 10−6 torr) by sequential thermal evaporation of 40 nm of C60, 7 nm of BCP, and 80 nm of Ag. The hole-only devices for space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements employed a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/P3HT/Au.

Cross-sectional and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films and devices were obtained using a Zeiss SIGMA instrument. The crystal structure and phase of perovskite films were characterized using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (Bruker AXS, D8 Advance). Absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu Mini 1280 ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV/VIS) spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurements were performed using a QuantaMaster 8000 steady-state transient modular fluorescence spectrometer (FP-2) mounted with a 473 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser excitation source. Topographic images of roughness measurements were characterized using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) instrument (SPM-9500J3, Shimadzu, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an XPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250Xi, USA). Under standard AM 1.5G illumination using a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A), photovoltaic (PV) parameters were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a QE/IPCE system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded on a CHI 770E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument, China) with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz and a bias voltage of 0 V in the dark. Dark J–V measurements were made using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
