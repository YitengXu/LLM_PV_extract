The PYBI ligand has major advantages by having the flexibility to introduce appropriate substituents at the four readily available positions through molecular engineering (Chart 1) compared to other ancillary bipyridyl-based ligands. We have substituted position A of the PYBI ligand with either electron-releasing triphenylamine (1) or pyrene (2). We have also introduced 2-hexylthiophene at position A and 3,5-di tert-butyl phenyl group at position B of the PYBI ligand (3). All three heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes have been characterized by mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, and absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as electrochemical methods. The absorption spectrum of complex 3 is red-shifted and the emission spectrum is blue-shifted, when compared to the standard N719 sensitizer. Testing of these newly designed heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers has revealed that complex 3 exhibits an efficiency of 7.88% using an I−/I3− redox electrolyte. Experimental observations corroborated by computational calculations have elucidated the high efficiency of complex 3, primarily due to the fact that the substituents at position A are more influential than those at position of B of the PYBI ligand.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising over conventional silicon-based solar cells for next-generation photovoltaic devices largely due to their negligible sensitivity to impurities, their easy fabrication by techniques like screen printing, spraying and pressing, their improved stability over a wide range of temperatures, and their flexibility for the choice of substrates used, which on the whole leads to low cost of production.1–3 Furthermore, the leading advantage of DSSCs is that they work well in diffuse light conditions compared to the trademark solid-state silicon photovoltaics.4 DSSCs have reached a certified efficiency of >11%. However, before commercialization of the technology, almost all components of the device have to be improved. Among various components, the sensitizer is one of the vital components to improve the efficiency and durability of the device. During the last two decades, various photosensitizers for DSSCs such as ruthenium dyes,5–7 tetrapyrrolic sensitizers (zinc porphyrin and phthalocyanines),8–12 and metal-free organic dyes13–15 have been developed to serve as efficient harvesters of sunlight. Very recently, a new concept has been developed on perovskite-based DSSCs that has shown an efficiency of up to 20.1%.16 However, the durability of the sensitizer for real outdoor long-term applications is still a significant challenge.
Ruthenium complexes have remained particularly interesting as photosensitizers in DSSCs for their practical feasible applications due to their favourable photoelectrochemical properties and high stability in the oxidized state.17 DSSC devices have been constructed using homoleptic ruthenium sensitizers (N3, N719 and black dye) and have achieved an efficiency of up to 11% under standard AM 1.5 illumination, and stable operation for millions of turnovers.5–7,18 To enhance the durability of the device, ruthenium analogue Z907 has been developed. However, despite having greater durability compared to N3 and N719, the efficiency of Z907 was found to be poor because of its low molar absorption.19,20 In this context, one of the ways to increase the PCE (η) and durability of the test cell device is through a high molar extension coefficient, by introducing extended π-conjugated structures of thiophene substituted at the bipyridine moiety in a heteroleptic manner. Many thiophene-based heteroleptic ruthenium dyes with significantly improved efficiencies and stable test cell devices have been reported.21–25 For example C101 and C102 sensitizers showed PCEs (η) above 11.5% with good molar extension coefficient values.21–25 Recently Diau and co-workers reported the concept of thiophene groups introduced to the pyridine-benzimadazole ligands at the B position, as shown in Chart 1.26 These thiophene-based pyridine-benzimadazole ligands (PYBI) containing heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizers RD16-RD18 have displayed enhanced PCEs (η) and short circuit current densities (Jsc) comparable to that of N719 dye, which is attributed to the broad spectral features in the low energy region. Moreover, these PYBI ligands have the advantages of greater flexibility for structural modification through molecular engineering at the four readily available positions, to generate further device performance compared to other ancillary bipyridyl-based ligands.
 Chart 1  (a) A, B, C, and D show the possible positions for structural modifications cation in heteroleptic Ru complexes containing the PYBI ligand; (P-BI-S-CHO) newly synthesized BI-formylated thiophene precursor for various structural modifications of pyridine-BI at the α-position; and ruthenium complexes 1–3. 
Additionally, PYBI derivatives have been developed as layer materials for electron transport and hole blocking in OLED devices because of their greater electron mobility, and have also been used as electrolyte additives in DSSCs to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc).27,28
In the continuation of our efforts towards the design of heteroleptic Ru-based sensitizers,29–31 we have introduced a formylated thiophene derivative at position A (Chart 1) to the pyridine-benzimidazole ligand in a simple two-step procedure. The present synthetic strategy leads to various structural modifications of PYBI at the α-position of the thiophene derivative to promote device performance further. In this regard, we have synthesized and characterized two new heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complexes containing highly electron-donating TPA (triphenylamine) or pyrene connected through an ethenyl spacer to the thiophene-based PYBI ligand (Scheme 1). The electron-releasing groups formed on extended π-conjugation of the PYBI ligand increase the molar extinction coefficient, and we have added a bipyridine ligand with anchoring carboxyl groups to attach onto the TiO2 surface and a thiocyanate ligand to tune the redox properties of the ruthenium centre. In addition to these, we have also synthesized a new thiophene-substituted heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex at position B (Chart 1). We report herein, the synthesis and spectroscopic, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of these three heteroleptic sensitizers using a liquid iodide/triiodide-based electrolyte. To gain insight into the electronic structure and properties of 1–3, computational calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been carried out.

Results and discussion
The important precursor compound P-BI-S-CHO was synthesised by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of unsubstituted PYBI with 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxaldehyde in the presence of a base catalyst. This precursor P-BI-S-CHO could be used for the synthesis of ligands (L1–L2) using the Wittig reaction.32 The ligand L3 was synthesised by Stille coupling reaction of 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole with tributyl(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane followed by nucleophilic substitution of 3,5-di-t-butylbenzyl bromide in the presence of a strong base.33 All three ligands were characterized by 1H NMR, mass spectrometry and CHN analysis (see ESI†). Finally ruthenium complexes 1–3 were synthesized by a typical one-pot synthesis, as shown in Scheme 1. All new heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizers were purified on a sephadex (LH-20) column using a chloroform and methanol mixture as the eluent. Preliminary characterization of these complexes was carried out by elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of all three ruthenium complexes consist of a molecular ion peak that corresponds to the proposed structure (see ESI†). The proton NMR spectra of Ru dyes 1–3 are too complex for characterization because they contain two diastereomers (observed as equal intensity) that cannot be separated with column chromatography.34 Consequently, the average effect of the two inseparable diastereomers should be considered in the results discussed in the following sections. Yun Chi et al. have isolated all three possible isomers of –NCS-free ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes and they demonstrated that a mixture of optical isomers does not have much effect on the device efficiency.35,36
The absorption and emission spectra of complexes 1–3 measured in acetonitrile solvent at room temperature along with standard N719 sensitizer are shown in Fig. 1. Also depicted in the same figure, the simulated absorption spectra of these systems obtained from TD-DFT calculations. The corresponding photophysical characterization data is summarized in Table 1. Inspection of Fig. 1 and the data in Table 1 reveals that the absorption features of complexes 1–2 are almost identical in the low energy region (1MLCT bands), with the electron-donating either TPA (triphenylamine) or pyrene moieties connected through an ethenyl spacer to thiophene. The increase in molar absorption coefficients for these dyes is mainly due to the electronic features of their highly conjugated nature, and these are comparable with the sensitizer N719. However, absorption bands at 400 nm are observed with large molar extinction coefficients for the PYBI ligand. In contrast, the absorption spectra of complex 3 show MLCT bands that are shifted towards the longer wavelength region, similar to previously reported compounds26,34 compared to N719. This clearly indicates that the thiophene derivatives substituted at position B on the PYBI ligand influence the MLCT absorption spectral features to extend into the red region compared to thiophene derivatives substituted at position A on the PYBI ligand, which do not influence the MLCT absorption spectral features. Fig. 1 also illustrates the emission spectra of complexes 1–3 along with the sensitizer N719. Excitation of the lower energy MLCT transition of complex 1 shows an emission maxima at 20 nm, red-shifted in comparison with the emission maxima of sensitizer N719. Whereas complex 3 exhibits a blue-shift in its emission maxima. Based on the optical properties, the E0–0 energies of complexes 1–3 are found to be 1.79, 1.81 and 1.84 eV, respectively.

To gain insight into the structural, electronic and optical properties of the considered Ru(II) heteroleptic compounds, we carried out DFT and TD-DFT calculations. As shown in Fig. 2, from the optimized geometries of 1–3, the thienyl group is orthogonal when substituted at the A site of the BI unit, due to the greater steric interference exerted by the BI unit. In contrast, the thienyl group on the pyridine group of complex 3 seems to be planar and to participate in the extended π-conjugation, resulting in red-shifting of the absorption maxima. The electron density distributions of the frontier molecular energy levels HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1 for complexes 1–3 are depicted in Fig. 2. In order to create an efficient charge-separated state, HOMOs must be localized on the donor unit, and LUMOs must be on the acceptor and anchoring groups. As seen from Fig. 2 and Table S1,† the electron densities of the highest occupied molecular orbitals, HOMO and HOMO−1 for 3 are mainly located at the ruthenium metal with contributions of 50 and 52% respectively, and the NCS ligand character is about 35%. For compounds 1 and 2 the HOMO is entirely localized on triphenylamine and pyrene and HOMO−1 has a ruthenium metal contribution of about 50%, and an NCS ligand character of about 35%. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of 1–3 have their amplitudes mostly on the anchoring bipyridyl ligand.
 Fig. 2  HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO, LUMO+1 for 1–3 calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p):LanL2DZ level of theory in acetonitrile. 
The calculated vertical excitation energies for singlet and triplet excited states, together with the calculated oscillator strengths are reported in Table S2.† It is well known that among heteroleptic Ru-based sensitizers, the electron injection takes place from 1MLCT and 3MLCT (S–T).6,37 The spin-forbidden 3MLCT transition will depend on the energy gap between the two excited states and will also depend on the spin–orbit coupling matrix element connecting the triplet and singlet states.38 The calculated S–T gap is found to be much lower in 3 than for 1 and 2. The MO contributions to major transitions as given in Table S2† also substantiate that the HOMO–LUMO transition, which is from the MLCT state, involves the triplet state for 3. From the TDDFT electronic transition analysis (Table S2†), the 3IL (intra ligand) and 1IL excited states are dominant for Ru complexes appended with triphenyl amine (1) and pyrene (2) ligands. Another interesting observation from Fig. 2 is that in spite of the well-separated charged species in complexes 1 and 2, the corresponding low Voc values point to poor regeneration of the dye. This is in agreement with similar observations made for ruthenium bipyridyl dyes, wherein the long-lived charge-separated state led to extremely low DSSC efficiencies.39,40 All these observations explain the high efficiency of sensitizer 3 as being due to efficient charge separation, improved charge injection and reduced charge recombination. This is similar to the findings of Diau et al. on the involvement of a benzimidazole ligand in heteroleptic ruthenium(II) polypyridyl dyes.37
To investigate the binding orientation of the most promising dye, 3, on a TiO2 surface, we have employed generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional, and details of dye–TiO2 adsorption calculations are given in following section. As is clear from Fig. 3, the dye is bound in two-arm mode to the TiO2 surface, where one of the carboxylic groups binds through a monodentate mode and other anchoring group binds bidentately, with proton transfer to a nearby surface oxygen. It is also clear that the HOMOs are delocalized over the dye, while the LUMOs are distributed at the TiO2–dye interface, indicating strong coupling between the injecting state of dyes and the CB of TiO2.

The electrochemical properties of these Ru dyes were investigated using the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) method with an internal reference of Fc/Fc+. The redox potential data of complexes 1–3 along with standard sensitizer N719 are presented in Table 1 and the corresponding DPV data in the ESI.† For each sensitizer, the potential level of the HOMO with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) was determined EHOMO = EOX − EFc/Fc+ + 0.64, and the potential level of the LUMO was determined from ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0;34 the HOMO and LUMO energy level values are given in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows an energy level diagram of the new heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers along with sensitizer N719 for comparison of the HOMO–LUMO levels of each sensitizer with respect to the TiO2 conduction band and the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple. The energy level diagram shows that the LUMO levels of the these sensitizers become increasingly stabilized with substituents on both the A and B positions in comparison with substituents at position A of the PYBI ligand only, owing to the electron-releasing nature of the substituents. In all the heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers designed here, both electron injection and electron regeneration are feasible when they serve as sensitizers for DSSCs.

The newly designed heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers were anchored onto a double-layer nanocrystalline TiO2 film and their photovoltaic properties were measured using liquid redox electrolyte (I−/I3−). Table 2 illustrates the photovoltaic performance characteristics of complexes 1–3 along with standard sensitizer N719. Fig. 5a shows the IPCE spectra of all three sensitizers and N719 dye. We observed maximum IPCE values of 78, 55 and 25% for complexes 3, 1 and 2, respectively at around 540 nm, indicating high dye loading for 3, more than 1 and 2. Under similar test cell conditions, we observed an IPCE of 78% for the standard N719 sensitizer. The photocurrent action spectrum resembles the absorption spectra except for a slight red-shift of ca. 15 nm. The photoresponse of thin films displays a broad spectral response covering the entire visible spectrum up to 800 nm. From the overlap integral of this curve one measures short-circuit photocurrent densities of 17.09, 12.35 and 5.14 ± 0.20 mA cm−2 using complexes 3, 1 and 2, respectively. Fig. 5b shows current–voltage characteristics of the devices using new heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers along with the N719 sensitizer. Under standard global Air Mass (AM) 1.5 solar conditions, the complex 3 sensitizer-based cell gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (iSC) of 17.09 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) was 649 ± 30 mV and the fill factor (ff) was 0.71 ± 0.03, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η, derived from the equation η = iSCVOC ff/light intensity, of 7.88%. Under similar test cell conditions N719 showed an overall conversion efficiency of 8.03%. In contrast complexes 1 and 2 showed overall conversion efficiencies of 1.45 and 4.59%, respectively.

The high efficiency of complex 3 compared to the other two complexes is therefore reasoned to be due to the presence of two electron-releasing groups substituted at the A and B positions of the PYBI ligand, which will tune the HOMO–LUMO levels. It seems site A on the PYBI ligand is more influential than site B in terms of exerting an enhancement on overall device efficiency. Also in 3, the planar arrangement at the pyridinyl site provides extended π-conjugation, which in turn leads to red-shifting of the absorption spectrum. Moreover the energy gap between the singlet and triplet states in complex 3 is lower than that in 1 and 2, and as a consequence the contribution of the triple state for electron injection is improved. For all the above reasons complex 3 exhibits the best efficiency among all three sensitizers.
Finally we have carried out thermal studies in order to understand the thermal properties of these heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes for rooftop applications. For this we have carried out thermogravimetric analysis of the newly synthesized dyes and compared this data to the standard N719 sensitizer. Fig. 6 shows the thermal behaviour of all three Ru(II) sensitizers along with N719. All these sensitizers are stable up to 200 °C. The weight loss between 200 and 250 °C is attributed to the removal of the carboxylic acid group.

In conclusion we have designed and synthesized new heteroleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes based on the PYBI ligand. The absorption spectrum of complex 3 is red-shifted whereas the emission maximum is blue-shifted in comparison with the standard N719 sensitizer. Electrochemical and theoretical properties indicate that the LUMO is above the TiO2 conduction band and the HOMO is below the redox potential of the redox couple. When applied to device studies using these newly designed heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers, complex 3 has shown an efficiency of 7.88%, whereas complexes 1 and 2 showed only 1.45 and 4.59% efficiency respectively, using an I−/I3− redox electrolyte. DFT and TD-DFT calculations have been performed to understand the variations in the device performances of 1, 2 and 3. The extended π-conjugation due to the planar thiophene moiety at the B position, favourable MOs for electron injection and regeneration of dye and better IPCE value for complex 3 elucidate the high efficiency of 3 compared to 1 and 2.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Commercially available reagents and chemicals were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical reagent (AR) grade solvents were used for the reactions while laboratory reagent (LR) grade solvents were used for purification and column chromatography. ACME silica gel (100–200 mesh) was used for column chromatography. All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen or argon atmosphere using dry and degassed solvents.
Synthesis
The detailed synthetic procedures for the ruthenium complexes (1–3), their corresponding PYBI precursors (L1–L3) and molecular characterizations are as follows. 2-(Pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole was prepared according to the literature procedure.34

Synthesis of 5-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (PBI-S-CHO). 
This important precursor was prepared according to a modified literature procedure.34 A Schlenk tube containing N2 gas was charged with 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole (5.0 mmol) and K2CO3 (5.5 mmol). Then the liquid reagent 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (6.5 mmol) was added, along with DMF solvent (15 mL). The reaction mixture was purged with N2 for 10 min, and finally the CuI (2.5 mol%) was added. The reaction was kept in an inert atmosphere and placed in a preheated oil bath at 160 °C for 16 h. The reaction was quenched by adding saturated sodium chloride and extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated in vacuo to yield the crude product, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: Hexane: Ethyl acetate) (78% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) (δ ppm): 9.94 (s, 1H), 8.43 (d, 1H), 8.24 (d, 1H), 7.90 (d, 1H), 7.83 (t, 1H), 7.7 (d, 1H), 7.40 (m, 1H), 7.37 (d, 2H), 7.29 (m, 1H), 7.18(d, 1H).

General procedure for the synthesis of ligands (L1–L2). 
To a clean and dry two-necked RB flask was added compound PBI-S-CHO (1 mmol), 18-crown-6 (15 mg), and anhydrous K2CO3 (2 mmol) in 10 ml of DMF. To this, a solution of the corresponding Wittig salt R-PPh3+Br− (1.02 mmol)32 in DMF was added slowly with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice water to get a precipitate, and then filtered to collect the yellow-coloured solid, which was dried in high vacuum. The dried solid was dissolved in THF and heated to reflux in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine overnight. To this, aqueous sodium thiosulphite solution was added to remove the iodine, and the mixture was extracted with DCM. The distillate organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified by column chromatography eluted with hexane:ethyl acetate (80% yield).

Synthesis of 2-(4-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)pyridine-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole (P-BI-S-NH). 

n-Butyllithium (2.85 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 2-hexylthiophene (2.38 mmol) in dry THF at −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h, then at RT for 2 h and after cooling to −78 °C, tributylstannyl chloride (3.09 mmol) was added. After stirring at RT for 5 h, the reaction was quenched by adding saturated ammonium chloride solution. The mixture was extracted with DCM and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated and the crude 2-hexyl-5-tributylstannylthiphene (19.11 mmol) was mixed with 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole26 (14.33 mmol) in DMF. The catalyst, palladium(II) (0.32 mmol), was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at 85 °C under nitrogen for 24 h. After rotary evaporation of DMF, the resulting solid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using chloroform–hexane as the eluent to get the product (B) (68% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) (δ ppm): 11.23 (bs, 1H, –NH), 8.63 (d, 1H), 8.57 (d, 1H), 7.90 (d, 1H), 7.47–7.54 (m, 3H), 7.31–7.35 (m, 2H), 6.86 (d, 1H), 2.88 (t, 2H), 1.69–1.89 (m, 2H), 1.32–1.45 (m, 6H), 0.92 (t, 3H).

Synthesis of ligand L3. 
To a solution of compound P-BI-S-NH (0.277 mmol) in DMF was added NaH (0.387 mmol) portion-wise at 0 °C. After completion of addition the temperature was raised to RT and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was again cooled to 0 °C and (2.4 mmol) of 3,5-di-t-butylbenzyl bromide was added.26 Then the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C overnight. After completion of the reaction, it was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride at RT, then extracted with ethyl acetate and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed, and the resulting solid was subjected to silica gel column chromatography by eluting with hexane–chloroform, to get compound L3 as a white powder (yield 85%). Anal.

General procedure for the synthesis of ruthenium complexes 1–3. 
In a typical one-pot synthesis, [RuCl2(p-cymene)]242 (153 mg, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (20 mL), and the corresponding precursor ligand (L1–L3) (0.5 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C under nitrogen for 4 h, and then 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine, dcbpy (0.5 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 150 °C for another 4 h in darkness to avoid photoinduced cis–trans isomerization. Excess KNCS was added to the reaction mixture and it was heated at 150 °C for 5 h. After the reaction, the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. Water was added to the resulting mixture to remove excess KNCS. The water-insoluble product was then collected on a sintered-glass crucible with suction filtration, washed with distilled water followed by diethyl ether, and dried in air. The crude complex in basic methanol [with tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAOH)] was further purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column with a methanol–chloroform mixture as the eluent. The main band was collected, concentrated, and precipitated with dilute acidic methanol to obtain the pure desired complex.

Methods

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz INOVA spectrometer. Differential pulse voltammetric measurements were performed on a PC-controlled electrochemical analyser (CH instruments model CHI620C). All these experiments were conducted with a 1 mM concentration of each compound in DMF at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAP) was used as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was glassy carbon, a standard calomel electrode (SCE) was the reference electrode and Pt wire was used as an auxiliary electrode. The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu (Model UV-3600) spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Spex model, JobinYvon) for solutions with optical density at the wavelength of excitation (λex) ≈ 0.05. Thermogravimetric measurements were carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample under nitrogen atmosphere.
Computational methodology
Ground state geometries optimized in the gas phase with the PBE043 functional with LanL2DZ44–46 with effective-core potential (ECP) were used for Ru and for rest of the elements 6-311+G(d,p)47,48 was used. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM)49 was used to optimize the geometries in acetonitrile. TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) calculations were performed on the PBE0 optimized geometries using CAM-B3LYP50 with the above-mentioned mixed basis set to calculate the vertical excitation energies, since it has been previously reported by many researchers that the CAM-B3LYP functional gives reliable results for MLCT.52,53 All the calculations were done in Gaussian 09.51 Electronic transitions and molecular orbital compositions were carried out with the GaussSum software package.54
To study the interaction between the dye and the TiO2, a two-dimensional model with 72 TiO2 units with the dimensions 3 × 6 in the [101] and [010] directions of the cell was applied to simulate the anatase TiO2 (101) surface. In all calculations the bottom layer of the two-layer slab was frozen. The atomic positions of the anatase surface with and without sensitizer were optimized using 1 × 1 × 1 gamma-centered k-point mesh, and the optimization of all atomic positions was stopped when the change in the total energy between successive steps was less than 0.04 eV Å−1 using the Davidson algorithm. A vacuum distance of >15 Å was set in the z-direction to retain negligible interaction between periodic images. The plane-wave technique implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used.55,56 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE57 functional has been employed in all calculations. The projector-augmented wave (PAW)58,59 method has been applied to describe the electron–ion interaction, and the cut-off energy was set to 300 eV.
Device fabrication
The detailed TiO2 photoelectrode (area: ca. 0.740 cm2) preparation was described in our earlier studies.60,61 Briefly, nanocrystalline TiO2 films of 8–8.5 μm thickness were deposited onto transparent conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, which has been coated with a fluorine-doped stannic oxide layer, sheet resistance of 8–10 Ω cm−2) over which ∼4.5 μm thickness of 400 nm anatase TiO2 particles (CCIC, HPW-400) were deposited as a scattering layer by screen-printing. These films were gradually sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The heated electrodes were impregnated with a 0.04 M titanium tetrachloride solution in a water-saturated desiccator for 30 min at 70 °C and then washed with distilled water and rinsed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool to 50 °C before dipping them into the dye solution (3 × 10−4 M in DMF). The electrodes were dipped into the dye solution for 16 h at 25 °C. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were assembled with Pt counter electrodes by heating with a hot-melt surlyn film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm thickness, Du-Pont) as a spacer in between the electrodes. A liquid electrolyte was filled through the predrilled hole present on the counter electrode and then the hole was sealed with a Surlyn disk and a thin glass to avoid leakage of the electrolyte. The electrolyte was composed of dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, TBP 0.5 M and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile.
The photovoltaic performances of these devices were characterized under an irradiation source of 450 W xenon light (Oriel, Sol 3A, Newport.), which is equivalent to an AM 1.5 solar simulator, and was calibrated using a Tempax 113 solar filter (Schott). In order to reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, a light shading black mask was used on the DSSCs. For photovoltaic measurements of the DSSCs, the irradiation source was a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, Sol 3A, Newport) with a filter (Schott 113), whose power was regulated to the AM 1.5 G solar standard by using a reference Si photodiode equipped with a colour-matched filter in order to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM 1.5 G to less than 4%. The measurement of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was plotted as a function of excitation wavelength using the incident light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA), which was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd). The measurement settling time between applying a voltage and measuring a current for the I–V characterization of DSSCs was fixed to 40 ms.
