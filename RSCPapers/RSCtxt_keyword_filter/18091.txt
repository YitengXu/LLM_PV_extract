1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention due to their attractive properties. Inspired by the discovery of freestanding single-layer graphene, many other 2D materials were found, such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides,1 layered double hydroxides,2 hexagonal boron nitride,3 transition metal oxides4 and nitrides,5 and MXenes.6 Since the discovery of MXenes (transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) in 2011,7 MXenes have attracted great attention due to their intriguing electronic and structural properties, such as high electrical conductivity, hydrophilic nature, large surface area, and easily tunable structure. Over the past few years, MXenes have been studied by many researchers in various fields, such as batteries, supercapacitors, electromagnetic interference shielding, photothermal conversion, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. Therefore, a fast development has been witnessed with these emerging and promising 2D materials – MXenes.8–12
MXenes (Mn+1Xn, n = 1–3) originated from MAX phases (M, transition metal; A, A-group element; X, C or N), where Mn+1Xn are interleaved with A layers. Therefore, MXenes can be synthesized by removal of the A-layers from the MAX phases through chemical etching.13,14 A variety of etching agents have been used for the etching of MAX phases, such as HF,15 LiF/HCl,16,17 and NH4HF2.18,19 After etching, the surface of MXenes was terminated with –O, −OH, −F, −NH3 or −NH4+, and it is possible that these functional groups are intercalated between the MXene sheets. In general, the obtained MXene sheets are denoted as Mn+1XnTx, where Tx refers to the surface terminations. To date, a variety of MXenes have been fabricated, such as Ti3C2, Ti2C, and Nb2C, among others. The preparation methods of various MXenes have been summarized in previous reviews.13,14,19–22
The physicochemical properties of MXenes depend greatly on the chemical nature of their surface. For example, the work function of MXenes can be adjusted by tailoring the surface terminations. The work function of OH-terminated Tin+1Cn MXenes is between 1.6 and 2.8 eV, which is much lower than that of O-terminated Tin+1Cn MXenes (5.75–6.25 eV).23 Many reviews on MXene-based materials have been published with different foci such as the synthesis of MXenes13,19,24,25 and the applications of MXenes in photocatalysis,26,27 sensing and biosensing,28 electrochemical microsupercapacitors,29 energy conversion and storage,30–34 thermocatalysis,35 sensors and chemical adsorption,36 rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors,37 biomedicine,38 and environmental remediation.39 However, to our knowledge, no review has been focused on the surface engineering aspect of MXenes for the above-mentioned applications.
This review provides a systematic summary of the surface engineering of MXenes, including surface termination groups, surface functionalization, surface defects, surface doping, surface oxidation, and the theoretical calculation of MXene surface engineering. The effects of these kinds of surface engineering of MXenes on their physicochemical properties and performances in energy and environmental applications are discussed. Moreover, the ongoing challenges and opportunities for the future development of MXene surface engineering are also highlighted. Notably, a recent topical review on the surface and heterointerface engineering of 2D MXenes was reported.40 However, this review focuses mainly on the application of MXene-based nanocomposites in electro- and photocatalysis, and only the surface termination groups were mentioned, i.e., other approaches for surface engineering of MXenes were not summarized. Therefore, we believe that a comprehensive review to survey the surface engineering of MXenes systematically is timely to promote further development of this exciting and still emerging area of research.
2. Surface termination groups of MXenes
It is well known that MXenes prepared by traditional etching with HF or HCl/LiF as an etchant will leave surface termination groups, namely –O, –OH, and –F, that will bond to the surface metal atoms of MXenes, as illustrated in Fig. 1.41–44 Based on theoretical simulation and experiment results, some reports showed that these terminations are “harmful” to the electrical properties of MXenes such as electrical conductivity,45–47 electron mobility,48 and Li-ion conductivity,49 which impedes the application of this material as an electrode. Therefore, extensive studies have been done to partially remove the terminations on the MXene surface in order to improve the electrical performance. For example, Lu et al.50 and Kong et al.51 successfully increased the specific capacity of the lithium-ion battery (up to 69%) by decreasing the –F and –OH content on the Ti3C2Tx anode. Hart et al.52 and Halim et al.53 experimentally proved that the electrical conductivity of MXenes increased in accordance with the decrease of the surface termination. Therefore, by partially removing the surface terminations, the electrical conductivity of MXenes can be improved.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the Mn+1XnTx MXene structures, where M is an early transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx represents surface terminations of the outer metal layers. 
Furthermore, the abundant terminations can also impart more features to MXenes. The –O termination has been theoretically proved to be beneficial for the Li-ion storage of Ti3C2Tx and M2CTx (M = Sc, Ti, V and Cr).54,55 Wang et al. experimentally proved that Ti3C2Tx with an O-rich surface demonstrated higher Li-ion storage than its F-rich and OH-rich counterparts.56 Meanwhile, the –OH termination can enhance the performance of Ti3C2Tx in chemisorption through the ion exchange process.57–64 Usually, –OH and –O are referred to as oxygen-containing terminations since their chemical and electrochemical behaviors are similar on the surface of MXenes. Both of them can make Ti3C2Tx a promising material as an electrochemical capacitor65–67 and sensor.68 Recently, even the long-time ignored –F termination has been experimentally proved by Li et al.69 to be contributive to the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of Ti2CTx.
In addition, it was demonstrated by DFT calculation that the Fermi levels (EF) of MXene and the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state H*, |ΔGH*|, depended on the surface terminations (such as –O and –F) of MXene.70,71 For example, the EF of Ti3C2 was calculated to be −0.05 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), while the EF of the O- and F-terminated Ti3C2 were calculated to be 1.88 and 0.15 V versus SHE,70 respectively. The more positive value of EF indicated the stronger ability of MXenes to accept photogenerated electrons from the semiconductor photocatalysts. Therefore, the O-terminated Ti3C2 was a better cocatalyst for the photocatalyst to capture the photogenerated electrons compared to pure Ti3C2 and F-terminated Ti3C2. Meanwhile, the ΔGH*, which was considered as the major indicator for the hydrogen production activity, was changed from −0.927 eV for pure Ti3C2 to 1.995 eV and 0.003 eV for the F-terminated Ti3C2 and O-terminated Ti3C2, respectively. The value of 0.003 eV is close to zero, indicating the potentially remarkable HER activity of O-terminated Ti3C2 from the viewpoint of thermodynamics.
Therefore, these surface terminations are essential to the properties of MXenes, and deliberate manipulation of the surface terminations can make them versatile materials. In this section, we summarize some popular methods that have been confirmed to be effective for termination regulation.
2.1 Regulation of surface terminations by alkalization
Alkalization is the most popular and facile post-treatment method to increase the –OH population on the MXene surface. This treatment can not only enhance the chemical and/or electrochemical performance of MXenes, but also protect the bare surface Ti atoms from oxidation in air.62 It has even been reported that this treatment is capable of altering the morphology of MXenes, creating more contact points when introduced to the surface of another material to form a composite.72 This method targets the MXene that originally has –F terminations and consists of two simultaneous processes: surface termination substitution and ion intercalation. Since –F is not stable at high pH values, it will be eventually replaced by –OH55,61 under alkaline conditions. Although intercalation is seemingly irrelevant to the surface termination manipulation, it is always coupled with alkalization as the metal ions in alkaline-like LiOH,57,73 NaOH,57,62,64,68,69,72,74–77 and KOH57,58,65,78–80 will spontaneously move into the interlayer space, partially replacing H in –OH through ion exchange, hence simultaneously increasing the interlayer distance. Apart from alkalis, Dall'Agnese et al.65 proved that salt-like KOAc (Ac = acetate), which can produce –OH during hydroxylation, had a similar effect on MXenes as well. Therefore, by immersing MXenes in an alkaline solution with a certain concentration and stirring for a certain duration of time at a desired temperature, MXenes with an –OH-rich surface and expanded interlayer space can be achieved.
The O/F ratio on the surface of MXenes detected by either X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) or Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) after the alkalization can be used as a criterion when evaluating the F–OH substitution degree of this process. However, compared with EDX, XPS can provide more comprehensive information of the surface chemistry. Thus, unless specifically marked as “EDX”, the O/F ratios in Table 1 are obtained by XPS. It straightforwardly manifests the ratio of the sum of –OH and –O to –F. Since –O is immune to alkalization, it is reasonable to state that the higher the resulting O/F ratio is, the larger the portion of the introduced –OH will be, implying a more complete alkalization process. Table 1 summarizes several sets of alkalization parameters and the resulting O/F ratios. Clearly, different groups of parameters result in highly dispersive O/F ratios. Therefore, it is of great value to figure out how these parameters affect the extent of alkalization so that one may deliberately design a process that can maximize the F–OH substitution.

Since the interlayer expansion will increase the contact area of MXenes with the alkaline solution, there is a good reason to believe that the intercalation will further facilitate the alkalization. However, even though the ion sizes of Li+, Na+, and K+ obviously differ from each other and offer potentially different lattice expansions, results from Wei et al.57 suggest that little impact is brought about by them on the O/F ratio after the alkalization (entries 3, 12 & 16 in Table 1). They made a direct comparison of Ti3C2Tx treated with different alkalis in order to optimize its adsorption capacity for methylene blue. Although all of them successfully increased the O/F ratio of the untreated Ti3C2Tx, the difference between them did not follow in the same fashion as the change of lattice expansion (depicted by the c-lattice constant increase) and was almost negligible. The highest interlayer expansion percentage (regarding the untreated MXenes) was achieved by LiOH due to the smallest cation size of Li+, while NaOH achieved the highest O/F ratio. The highest O/F ratio of NaOH-treated Ti3C2Tx led to its highest adsorption capacity (ca. 189 mg g−1vs. 100 mg g−1 for the untreated one). Therefore, the larger interlayer spacing cannot guarantee higher F–OH substitution completeness. This fact may suggest that even for the smallest interlayer distance achieved by K+, there was enough space for the process.
The seemingly more influential factor determining the O/F ratio is alkali concentration. Li et al.69 conducted alkalization with 1 M NaOH for 2 h at room temperature to achieve an O/F ratio of around 6.30 (entry 1). By slightly increasing the concentration of NaOH to 5 M (with the other parameters kept the same), a higher O/F ratio of 7.69 was achieved by Yang et al. (entry 2),68 enhancing the humidity sensitivity of Ti3C2Tx by up to 60 times. Xiang et al.72 (entry 7–10 in Table 1) investigated the impact of NaOH concentration in more detail. The original O/F ratio of the Ti3C2Tx was 1.41. After 10 min alkalization at RT with 1, 3, and 5 M NaOH, the O/F ratio was elevated to 5.35, 8.87 and 18.66, respectively. However, as they further increased the concentration to 7 M, the resulting O/F ratio decreased to 13.55. As a consequence, the highest O/F ratio produced the most wrinkles on Ti3C2Tx, making it a better candidate than all its counterparts for piezoresistive sensor fabrication. This result suggested that the completeness of alkalization is partially dependent on the alkali concentration. However, there may be an inflection point, beyond which the dependence will not be obvious anymore.
Currently, the partial contribution from reaction temperature and time of alkalization remains unknown due to the lack of available research data. Comparing entries 1, 7 and 15 in Table 1, longer reaction time is seemingly helpful to increase the O/F ratio. Meanwhile, comparing entries 2 and 9, it appears that longer reaction time leads to a lower O/F ratio. This disagreement may be caused by other factors depending on how the material was prepared and how the alkalization was actually conducted, which is far more complicated. Thus, Table 1 is only a summary of some selected parameters and no solid trend of time and temperature factors can be concluded unless a direct comparison is made as in ref. 57 and 72.
Surface-alkalinized Ti3C2 MXene was proved to be an efficient cocatalyst of P25 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction by Ye et al.81 In their work, the –F on the surface of the Ti3C2 (TC) was replaced by –OH to obtain Ti3C2–OH (TC–OH) when the Ti3C2 was treated with KOH. When the TC surface was terminated with –OH, the adsorbing capacity for CO2 was greatly enhanced from 0.18 cm3 g−1 (TC) to 7.01 cm3 g−1 (TC–OH), as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, according to the DFT calculations, the adsorption energy of CO2 (−0.13 eV) on TC–F was smaller than that of CO2 on TC–OH (−0.44 eV) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the higher adsorption capability of CO2 on TC–OH might be ascribed to the stronger adsorption of CO2 on TC–OH. In addition, based on the FTIR results, more carbonate species, characterized by vibrational modes of vs(CO3) (ca. 1320 cm−1) and vas(CO3) (ca. 1580 cm−1), can be generated on 5TC–OH/P25 than on 5TC/P25 after irradiation, indicating that CO2 is easily converted to the activated CO32− on the 5TC–OH/P25 sample. With the 5TC–OH/P25 as the photocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction, the evolution rates of CO (11.74 μmol g−1 h−1) and CH4 (16.61 μmol g−1 h−1) were 3 and 277 times higher than those on bare P25, respectively.

Due to its high work function, MXene has been widely used as the electron acceptor cocatalyst of semiconductor photocatalysts.82 However, the work function of the MXene can also be altered by alkalization. When the surface termination of the MXene was replaced by –OH, the work function of the MXene was greatly decreased. For example, based on the results of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the work functions of Ti3C2Mx (M = –O, –F, –OH) and Ti3C2Tx (T = –OH) were calculated to be 3.51 and 2.28 eV, respectively.83 In this case, when Ti3C2Tx was used as the cocatalyst for TiO2 (work function = 4.27), Ti3C2Tx acted as the hole trap instead of electron acceptor.
2.2 Regulation of surface terminations by thermal treatment
Thermal treatment or annealing is a feasible strategy to partially remove surface terminations. By deliberately designing an annealing temperature program, the composition of surface terminations can be manipulated because the stability of these terminations is different from each other. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results from Hu et al.84 showed that among Ti3C2(OH)2, Ti3C2F2, and Ti3C2O2, Ti3C2(OH)2 is the most unstable one, while Ti3C2O2 is the most stable one. Similarly, Ashton et al.85 claimed that for Ti2CTx MXene, these terminations followed the same fashion as mentioned above based on their DFT calculations. Additionally, they even proposed that for all MXenes (except M = Sc), –O is preferred over other terminations. Some experimental results also indicated that during heat treatment under an inert atmosphere or vacuum, –OH will be converted to –O,50 which can resist relatively higher temperatures.52,86 It should be noticed that MXenes are vulnerable to oxidation when annealed in air; hence, only annealing processes under an inert atmosphere are discussed in this section.
Currently, the temperatures of dissociation onset of the three typical terminations over MXenes are not well defined. Therefore, only a possible range of onsets will be provided in this section. Generally, based on the information from Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Thermogravimetric Analysis-Mass Spectrometry (TGA-MS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis-Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA-DSC), the onset of different surface species can be determined.
The dissociation of –OH occurs at approximately 200–400 °C for Ti MXene species.51,52,87 For example, Hart et al.52 used TGA-MS to monitor the dissociation process of H2O and –OH on Ti3CNTx (Fig. 3). The first peak was attributed to H2O loss, and the second peak was identified as –OH dissociation. Therefore, the onset was at around 200 °C. Likewise, Zhou et al.87 claimed that the –OH loss on Zr-based MXenes started from 200 °C. Differently, Kong et al.51 used TGA-DSC to observe the thermal behavior of Ti3C2Tx under N2. There was an obvious mass loss at around 400 °C and it was attributed to –OH dissociation with the help of 1H NMR.

However, regarding the –F termination, the obtained dissociation behavior seems to vary drastically among papers using different characterization techniques. Based on XPS and/or EDX data, the atomic ratios of F/Ti and O/Ti on the MXene surface can be achieved. The calculated ratios show that although the onset of the –F dissociation is unknown, it starts to follow the footstep of –OH from as low as 200 °C.48,50,69 The only difference is that the dissociation rate of –F is relatively slower than that of –OH,48,69 a result of the aforementioned higher theoretical stability of –F than –OH. However, by combining TGA with either MS or DSC, an apparent –F loss onset can be achieved varying from 400 to 1000 °C or even higher, which is greater than the onset of –OH dissociation.51,52,88 One assumption can be proposed to account for the contradiction: although the major step of –F loss requires a higher temperature than that for –OH, it starts to dissociate slowly at low temperature as –OH. The apparent onset of –F dissociation demonstrated by MS cannot reveal the real behavior of –F since the background covers the weak signal of –F at low temperature range. Supporting research was done by Seredych et al.88 As the concentration of –F increases (realized by increasing HF concentration in the etching process), they found that the apparent onset of –F dissociation moved to lower temperature (from ca. 1000 °C to ca. 400 °C, shown in Fig. 4), which is a persuasive support for the above assumption.

For the –O termination, owing to its high stability, it can resist temperatures as high as 750 °C or even higher,52,86 where some Ti3C2Tx samples are about to or have already degraded.48,75,88 Consequently, no paper has specially dealt with the manipulation of the –O termination as far as we know. The above-mentioned findings offer some opportunities to regulate the composition of surface terminations (O/Ti and F/Ti ratios are used here to quantify the composition of surface terminations). For example, considering that the dissociation rate of –F is slower than that of –OH under relatively low temperature, Li et al.69 successfully fabricated a type of F-rich Ti2CTx by eliminating oxygen-containing groups via annealing at 200 °C under vacuum conditions. After the heat treatment, the F/Ti (from 0.3 to 0.27) and O/Ti (from 0.16 to 0.037) ratios decreased, while the F/O ratio increased from 1.83 to 7.26. As a result, the F-rich Ti2CTx demonstrated a significantly small onset overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (75 vs. 265 mV for untreated Ti2CTx) and high exchange current density (412 vs. 40 μA m−2 for untreated Ti2CTx). Based on the knowledge mentioned above that –F can be replaced by –OH in alkaline solution, Halim et al.53 added an extra alkalization process before annealing. The results showed that the F/Ti ratio of Ti3C2Tx decreased from the initial 0.33 to 0.016 after vacuum annealing at 550 °C for 1 h. Differently, the oxygen-containing species mostly remained on the surface in this case since they took up the preferred Ti sites during the alkalization process,86 thus becoming more stable than those introduced during the etching process. This stratagem could successfully increase the O/F ratio to 28. Although it was stated in this paper that the increased O/F ratio seemingly did not influence the resistivity of Ti3C2Tx, the results confirmed the positive dependence of resistivity on the total amount of surface terminations reported by Wang et al. previously.75 Alkalization could generate more surface terminations, while the heat treatment could reduce their amount. Therefore, by deliberately designing these two processes, one can nicely control the specific surface terminations and hence control the resistivity of Ti3C2Tx either to the higher or the lower direction.
In the g-C3N4/Ti3C2Tx composites, Ti3C2Tx MXene with an oxygen terminated surface was obtained by annealing the composites for one hour at 200 °C either in a tube furnace under N2 protection or in a muffle oven in air.89 The oxygen terminated Ti3C2Tx acted as the cocatalyst for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction in the annealed g-C3N4/Ti3C2Tx composites. The H2 production of g-C3N4 with 30% Ti3C2Tx after annealing in air (10.9 μmol h−1 gcat−1) is 41% higher than that of the sample annealed in N2 (7.8 μmol h−1 gcat−1) and 105% higher than that of the sample without annealing (5.3 μmol h−1 gcat−1). The enhanced H2 production rate of the sample after annealing might be ascribed to the increased –O surface terminations on the Ti3C2 since more –O surface terminations can be generated after annealing in air than in N2. For the g-C3N4/Ti3C2Tx photocatalytic system, the –O surface terminations, which exhibited the lowest free energy of 0.011 eV with 25% coverage of atomic H, might be the active sites for the hydrogen evolution.
To remove all the terminations, the most frequently targeted species is –F. As discussed at the beginning of Section 2, it can be removed mainly before the degradation of MXenes, which makes it easier to remove when compared to –O. However, removing –F at low temperatures is still not efficient enough, which makes it a more worthwhile task when compared with –OH removal.
To realize the efficient removal of –F terminations, annealing under an H2-containing atmosphere was proved to be a reliable method.50,90 By annealing Ti3C2Tx at 500 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere for merely 30 min, Lu et al.50 reduced the F/Ti ratio from 0.2 to 0.05. Consequently, they improved the volumetric specific capacity of Ti3C2Tx from ∼56.3 to ∼89.4 mA h cm−3 after 100 cycles (tested at 100 mA cm−3). Likewise, Lai et al.90 increased the annealing temperature to 1100 °C (under an Ar/H2 atmosphere) and successfully eliminated almost all the –F groups on the surface of Ti2C(OH)xFy. Moreover, since –OH was either removed or converted to –O, the surface was purely covered by –O, making Ti2C(OH)xFy eventually become Ti2COx. As indicated in the paper, both Ti2C(OH)xFy and Ti2COx demonstrated semiconductor behaviors, but after the removal of –F, the resulting Ti2COx demonstrated an enlarged bandgap (80 meV) when compared with Ti2C(OH)xFy (10 meV). Therefore, the manipulation of surface terminations is also a promising topic when it comes to the band structure engineering of semiconducting MXenes.
2.3 Regulation of surface terminations by choosing different etching methods
As stated above, the original surface terminations are created during the etching process. Hence, the precursors involved and the reactions taking place will impact the composition of surface terminations of MXenes. So far, except for the aforementioned HF and LiF/HCl etching method, several other methods have been developed, including electrochemical etching,91–94 hydrothermal etching,67,95 and molten salt etching.96–100 Most of them are dedicated to developing an F-free etching process due to the inferior electrochemical performance caused by –F terminations on MXenes. Therefore, more opportunities are offered for termination manipulation by regulating the etching process. However, since the impact of the etching method on surface terminations is quite a comprehensive topic, readers interested in this area are suggested to refer to some interesting papers elsewhere43,101–104 that specifically cover this topic. Only the molten salt method is highlighted here due to its outstanding superiority in termination manipulation. Since the molten salt etching is a non-aqueous reaction process, it largely inhibits the unexpected side reactions like oxidation and hydrolysis,96 which means that this method is much “cleaner” than the others. The proposed mechanism by Li et al.97 is schematically shown in Fig. 5 for the etching process of Ti3C2Cl2 by ZnCl2.
 Fig. 5  Preparation mechanism of Ti3C2Cl2 etched by ZnCl2. Reproduced with permission from ref. 97, Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. 
Usually, the etchants are transition metal halides such as CdCl2,96 CdBr2,96 ZnCl2,97,98 and CuCl2.99,100 These transition metal halides can act as Lewis acid species in the molten salt state and hence can etch the A layer in the MAX phase. Since the anions involved here are halogens, the MXene produced via this method is terminated with halogens, different from the traditional methods.
Li et al.97 demonstrated that when Ti3AlC2 reacts with molten ZnCl2, it is initially transformed into Ti3ZnC2 and then etched to Ti3C2Cl2 with Zn clusters and AlCl3 gas being the by-products (Fig. 5). Therefore, the starting molar ratio of MAX/salt must play a critical role in this etching process. As they changed the ratio from 1:1 to 1:6, the final product gradually changed from Ti3ZnC2 to Ti3C2Cl2. Theoretically, the resulting MXene should be terminated entirely by –Cl. However, a small amount of Ti–Cl was inevitably replaced by Ti–O during the washing process because the bonding of Ti–O was stronger than that of Ti–Cl.98 Therefore, the Ti:Cl:O atomic ratio was 3:1.76:0.44 in the final product. It should be noted that the residual Al(OH)3 formed by the hydrolysis of AlCl3 also contributed to the O composition. Therefore, the real O amount in the form of –O terminations may be even lower. Again, attention should be paid to the washing process of the as-prepared MXenes. Dong et al.100 observed an even more severe Cl–O substitution phenomenon after washing the exfoliated Nb2CTx with 0.5 M ammonium persulfate (APS) solution. The resulting composition was determined to be Nb2C1.11O2.5Cl0.25, implying that most of the –Cl was lost by APS washing and hence, the as-prepared MXene cannot be considered a Cl-terminated MXene.
Following this methodology, Li et al.99 extended the MAX phase to Ti3AlCN, Nb2AlC, Ta2AlC, and Ti3SiC2. With the help of thermodynamic calculation, they successfully etched these MAX phases to their corresponding MXenes by deliberately choosing salts such as CdCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2, CuCl2, AgCl, and NiCl2, which demonstrated the superior universality of this method. By applying the optimal etchant, the –Cl termination can be introduced to various MXenes. Furthermore, Kamysbayev et al.96 creatively used CdBr2 to prepare Br-terminated MXenes (Ti3C2Br2 and Ti2CBr2). Because the M–Br bond is weaker than the typical M–F and M–OH bonds, the Br termination enables the ion exchange reaction on the surface of MXenes. By conducting the surface reaction under varied temperatures from 300 to 600 °C, they successfully prepared MXenes terminated by –NH, –S, –Se, and –Te. Surprisingly, they were able to eliminate all the surface terminations by reacting Ti3C2Br2 and Ti2CBr2 with LiH at 300 °C.
So far, only a few studies have reported the performances of MXenes prepared by the molten salt method, probably a consequence of the early stage of this field. Li et al.99 reported a Li-ion storage capacity of 205 mA h g−1 at 0.5 mV s−1 using a partially Cl-terminated MXene (Ti3C1.94Cl0.77O1.71). Dong et al.100 used Nb2C1.11O2.5Cl0.25 to achieve a Li-ion storage capacity of 330 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, which is incomparable with the alkalized MXene79 results mentioned above. Kamysbayev et al.96 observed the superconductivity of Nb2CS2, Nb2CSe, and Nb2C(NH) in the low-temperature region (<10 K), which suggests a promising application of the molten salt method in the manipulation of the superconducting properties of MXenes.
Currently, the molten salt method is still in its starting stage. Although the application of this method has not been well developed, it indeed offers a great possibility for the manipulation of various surface terminations.
Conclusively, this whole section introduced three methods that have been proved effective in manipulating the surface terminations of MXenes. The modification of the surface chemistry environment can lead to improved chemical and/or electrochemical performance. However, there is still a long way to go if a finely controlled manipulation process is desired.
3. Surface functionalization of MXenes
Although the original surface terminations already have some impacts on the functionality of MXenes, surface functionalization with other groups can endow the material with even more features. Owing to the abundance of original surface terminations, the functionalization of MXenes is quite a facile process. The introduced molecules with functional groups can readily form either M–O–X bonds via reaction with –O and –OH105–114 or direct M–X bonds by reaction with bare surface Ti atoms or replacing the surface terminations115–125 (X: the functional group or a molecule with a functional group, M: the metal element in MXenes). Armed with these functional groups, MXenes have demonstrated enhanced performance in fields where unfunctionalized MXenes can also be applied, such as environment material (dye adsorption106,107,112 and ion adsorption113,114) and energy material (supercapacitors108,119 and batteries126). Meanwhile, with the help of some functional groups, MXenes also demonstrated potential for broader applications, such as biosensors109,110 and anticancer therapy, which is usually a synergetic process combining several therapies like photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemotherapy.116–118,120–125
In this section, based on the actually effective units, five main types of surface functional groups on MXenes, along with their corresponding precursors and bonding mechanisms are schematically shown in Fig. 6, and the MXene surface functional groups and their corresponding applications are summarized in Table 2.

3.1 Phenylsulfonic group & sulfonicgroup (–SO3H)
Usually, the denotation “–SO3H” stands for both the phenylsulfonic and sulfonic groups. However, due to its extra phenyl part, the phenylsulfonic group demonstrates more versatile functionalities than the sulfonic group and is more frequently used. The sulfonic group is proved to be highly active in donating protons,126 which can provide MXenes with more active sites. The phenyl group is also reported to produce extra active sites during electrochemical reactions.108 Meanwhile, the phenylsulfonic group, as a whole, is negatively charged, which is beneficial for improving the electromagnetic force between MXenes and positively charged dye ions.106,107 Phenylsulfonic groups were introduced onto MXenes via aryl diazonium salt chemistry105–108,126 (Fig. 6a), which was proved to be an effective method to introduce foreign species to the surface of carbon-based materials128,129 and metal nanoparticles.130 A proposed reaction pathway is schematically illustrated later in this review (Section 3.3) for a similar reaction. Due to the metal carbide nature of MXenes, it was reasonable to introduce this method to the MXene field. The idea was first brought to this field as a novel way to delaminate Ti3C2Tx on a large scale,105 and then extended to chemical adsorption,106,107 electrical materials,108,126 and magnetic materials.115 Apart from the commonly used method, sulfonic groups can also be directly grafted by chlorosulfonic acid (CS)115 (Fig. 6a), which was known to be a useful tool for introducing sulfonic groups to TiO2.131,132
MXene materials have suffered from the low yield of delaminated flakes since their discovery133 due to the high surface free energy.105 Therefore, Wang et al.105 creatively introduced phenylsulfonic groups to the surface of Ti3C2Tx, using Na+ as an interlayer pre-spacer. Due to their larger size, phenylsulfonic groups can expand the interlayer space and weaken the interaction between layers and hence delaminate Ti3C2Tx to a greater extent. This study opened more opportunities for MXene surface functionalization.
Following this study, Lei et al.106 and Chen et al.107 started to focus on the organic dye adsorption performance of this phenylsulfonic-functionalized MXene. Lei et al.106 found that the methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity of Ti3C2–SO3H could reach 111.11 mg g−1 while that of the unfunctionalized material was only 21.10 mg g−1. Chen et al.107 carried out more comprehensive and fundamental research involving MB, Rhodamine B (RhB), and Safranin T (ST). They focused on the self-assembling behaviors of the adsorbates on the surface of Ti3C2–SO3H. Thanks to the weak intermolecular force between phenylsulfonic groups and dye molecules (electrostatic force, π–π interaction, and hydrogen bonding), all three dyes could form ordered aggregations on the surface of Ti3C2–SO3H. They found that MB and RhB molecules formed both H-aggregation (face-to-face stacking134) and J-aggregation (head-to-tail stacking134) while ST molecules mainly formed H-aggregation.
Extended work on the phenylsulfonic-modified MXenes was performed by Wang et al.108 and Scheibe et al.115 With the help of the high specific surface area of delaminated Ti3C2–SO3H, Wang et al.108 made use of the merits of the pioneer work105 and successfully prepared an electrode exhibiting enhanced supercapacitor performance. The delaminated nanosheets allowed more exposed surface atoms to react with electrolyte, resulting in a specific capacitance (Cs) of 160 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 while the Cs of the unfunctionalized electrode was just 69 F g−1 at the same rate.
Focusing on the unique ability of the sulfonic group to donate electrons, Liu et al.126 recently developed a new solution to stabilize polyaniline (PANI) on the surface of Ti3C2Tx (shown in Fig. 7), which made this functionalized Ti3C2Tx a promising candidate for Zn-ion battery (ZIB) cathode material. By grafting sulfonic groups in the form of phenylsulfonic groups onto Ti3C2Tx (via aryl diazonium salt chemistry), they successfully improved the protonation degree of PANI and inhibited its chronic deprotonation via providing a continuous supply of protons and locally high acidity. The improved protonation degree of PANI ultimately resulted in a high redox activity with good reversibility for the composite cathode material. Differently, Scheibe et al.115 turned to inspect the magnetic properties of MXenes modified by sulfonic acid groups. They found that by partially substituting the original surface terminations on HF-etched Ti3C2Tx with sulfonic acid groups, the material started to exhibit mixed antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic behaviors under an external magnetic field while the MAX phase and unfunctionalized Ti3C2Tx demonstrated only paramagnetic behavior. Additionally, the functionalized Ti3C2Tx exhibited two different types of radicals and/or defects in the electron paramagnetic spectrum.

3.2 Amino group (–NH2)
In amino groups, the lone electron pair demonstrates versatile characteristics by forming coordination bonds with other groups or molecules. Therefore, they have been widely used as functional groups to endow absorbability109,110 or bridging joints111 to construct composites. Chain molecules are commonly used to graft –NH2, and they are usually with two functional ends: one is –NH2, and the other is for anchoring through reaction with original surface terminations (Fig. 6b). Owing to the ultrathin 2D sheet-like morphology and excellent ion intercalation behavior, MXenes are ideal for electrochemical sensing after being loaded with efficient surface sensing groups. Therefore, Kumar et al.109 tried to introduce amino groups to the surface of single/few-layered Ti3C2Tx in the form of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) for biosensing (Fig. 6b – top panel & Fig. 8). The as-functionalized material demonstrated a wide linear detection range (0.0001–2000 ng mL−1) and a low detection limit (0.000018 ng mL−1) towards carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, an important cancer biomarker) with high sensitivity (∼37.9 μA ng−1 mL cm−2 per decade). The process was realized by the covalent immobilization of a bio-receptor (anti-CEA) on amino groups. Recently, following a similar procedure, Wu et al.110 successfully introduced amino groups to a more complex MXene-based system to absorb anti-CEA.

On the other hand, Zong et al.111 used amino groups as a bridge to integrate GdW10 with Ti3C2Tx, aiming for both excellent photothermal reactivity and contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Amino groups were attached to the surface of Ti3C2Tx by means of PEGylation using amino-polyethylene glycol (PEG)2000 (NH2-PEG2000) (Fig. 6b – bottom panel). The functionalized Ti3C2Tx was then connected to –COOH groups on the surface of modified GdW10 by amide bonds. The resulting composite showed high photothermal ablation performance on cancer cells (21.1% cell viability in vitro, 200 ppm, 1.5 W cm−2, 5 min) and completely eradicated an in vivo tumor xenograft without reoccurrence.
3.3 Carboxyl group (–COOH)
Carboxyl groups have already been extensively inspected in graphene materials,135–137 and owing to the similar surface chemistry environment, it is possible to introduce carboxyl groups into MXene materials.112–114 Similar to amino groups, carboxyl groups can be applied to a couple of chemicals via the aforementioned interaction with amino groups to form amides or esters.111,112,137 Apart from the coupling reaction, carboxyl groups were also proven to adsorb metal ions by forming chemical bonds.113,114 Li et al.112 transplanted the method previously used for graphene oxide (GO) functionalization138 to the introduction of carboxyl groups to the surface of Ti3C2Tx, using chloroacetic acid as the precursor (Fig. 6c – top panel). By the interaction between carboxyl groups on the MXene surface and amino groups in polyethylene polyimide (PEI), PEI was connected to the MXene substrate for the deposition of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). After layer-by-layer deposition of these two polymers, a core–shell structure could be constructed for dye adsorption, including ST, MB, and neutral red (NR).
Two additional contributions from Gan et al.113 and Zhang et al.114 exploited the interaction of heavy metal ions with carboxyl groups to realize chemical adsorption. Through “mussel-inspired chemistry”, Gan et al.113 successfully anchored levodopa (L-DOPA), a kind of amino acid, by the interaction of its catechol groups with the Ti3C2Tx surface (Fig. 6c – middle panel). The decorated Ti3C2Tx possessed abundant carboxyl groups and demonstrated efficient Cu2+ adsorption performance. Zhang et al.114 took the diazonium salt chemistry route mentioned above using phenylcarboxylic acid diazonium salt as the intermediate to introduce carboxyl groups in the form of phenylcarboxylic acid (Fig. 6c – bottom panel). A proposed reaction pathway of this diazonium salt chemistry is shown in Fig. 9. As concluded in the paper, UO22+ and Eu3+ ions were mainly coordinated with the carboxyl groups by forming O–U and O–Eu bonds, respectively. The exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of the as-prepared material for U and Eu were 344.8 and 97.1 mg g−1, respectively. As a comparison, the unfunctionalized Ti3C2Tx demonstrated much lower capacities for both elements: 26 mg g−1 for U139 and 54.05 mg g−1 for Eu.140

3.4 Al oxoanion [–Al(OH)4−]
MXenes with the –Al(OH)4− termination were first introduced by Xuan et al.116via an organic reaction (Fig. 6d). Surprisingly, this surface group was found to be helpful for enhancing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect116 of Ti3C2Tx, hence enhancing the light absorption of Ti3C2Tx in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The absorption in this region can result in heat generation, therefore this functionalization can enhance the photothermal performance of Ti3C2Tx. Usually, this energy transformation process is depicted by two parameters: (1) mass extinction coefficient (α), which measures how strongly a given mass of material absorbs light at a given wavelength, and (2) photothermal conversion efficiency (η), which measures how efficiently the material can convert the absorbed light into heat.
Other research groups117–119 have optimized the method to afford a greener and more efficient procedure to introduce Al(OH)4− terminations to MXenes. The originality of Xuan's research was the change of etchant for the MAX phase.116 Based on the amphoteric nature of Al, they chose an organic base, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), instead of the traditionally used concentrated HF or LiF/HCl mixture, which are corrosive and unfriendly to the environment. The chemical process is schematically shown in Fig. 10. OH− in TMAOH could attack Al atoms more efficiently, forming Al(OH)4− in the solution environment. The resulting Al(OH)4− was then attracted to the surface and bonded with Ti atoms of Ti3C2Tx. After the introduction of Al(OH)4−, Ti3C2Tx demonstrated a strong and broad absorption in the NIR region, which improved the photothermal reactivity of the material. As a result, under irradiation by an 808 nm laser, the mass extinction coefficient of this functionalized Ti3C2Tx was detected to be as high as 29.1 L g−1 cm−1, making it an ideal candidate for photothermal anticancer therapy. Afterwards, Bai et al.125 followed a similar procedure to functionalize Ti3C2Tx and built a multifunctional nanocomposite drug delivery system based on it. The obtained system demonstrated an even higher mass extinction coefficient (36.2 L g−1 cm−1) than that in Xuan's work under illumination by an 808 nm laser with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 59.6%.

Then, Liu et al.117 modified the etching process by supplying additive Al3+ (in the form of AlCl3·6H2O) to avoid Al(OH)4− loss during the long-term etching. Consequently, the functionalized Ti3C2Tx nanosheets exhibited a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 58.3% under 808 nm irradiation. In the same year, Yu et al.118 optimized Xuan's method by substituting TMAOH with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as the etchant, skipping the pretreatment step involving diluted HF solution.116 Thus, completely fluorine-free etching was realized. Moreover, the fluorine-free surface drastically increased the mass extinction coefficient of the functionalized Ti3C2Tx to 52.8 L g−1 cm−1 under an 808 nm laser with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 52.2%. However, since the yield of single-layered MXenes was still very low (∼20%),119 Han et al.119 focused on this blank area and successfully enhanced the yield to 74% through a hydrothermal-assisted intercalation (HAI) strategy (TMAOH was the etchant) instead of Xuan's intercalation and delamination two-step process. Consequently, the functionalized Ti3C2Tx exhibited a capacitance of 482 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1), higher than other reported data of MXenes and MXene-based materials.141–146
3.5 Soybean phospholipid (SP)
As mentioned above, MXene-based materials have been widely used in photothermal therapy targeting tumor cells. However, the poor biocompatibility resulting from their instability in physiological solutions is still a big challenge. Regarding this problem, SP was then brought to this field without any apparent sacrifice of the photothermal properties of MXenes120–124 (Fig. 6e). SP is a complex mixture of various kinds of phospholipids, which is a family of amphiphilic organics composed of a hydrophilic head (red heads in the scheme) and hydrophobic acyl chains (blue tails in the scheme)147 (Fig. 6e). Therefore, SP is a powerful tool to endow versatile solubility to MXenes, suitable for the physiological environment. It was first grafted onto Ti3C2Tx120 and then extended to other MXenes121 or MXene-based materials.122–124
Lin et al.120 introduced SP to the surface of Ti3C2Tx through a “thin-film” approach, which is a type of chemical deposition. Via rotary evaporation of a mixture of precursors and solvents under vacuum, a thin film of SP can be coated onto Ti3C2Tx with their hydrophilic heads attached to the Ti3C2Tx surface. The resulting material was used for photothermal ablation of tumors (shown in Fig. 11) and no noticeable toxicity was shown in the test. Afterward, the same group121 successfully grafted SP onto the surface of Ta4C3Tx, a novel member in the MXene family. The prepared material demonstrated contrast-enhanced CT imaging properties and higher photothermal conversion efficiency (from the previous 30.6%120 to the current 44.7% under 808 nm irradiation). Other contributions were made for contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI via deposition of MnOx122,123 or superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles124 on the MXene surface. SP was involved in all these studies as the surface modifier to enhance biocompatibility. However, it was clearly revealed in Table 2 that the α and η of the SP-functionalized MXene materials were incomparable to those of the MXenes functionalized by –Al(OH)4−, probably because of the introduction of other materials onto MXene.

3.6 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTMS)
In addition to the mostly reported functionalizations as summarized in Fig. 6, the contact angle on the MXene/water interface can be tuned by introducing different surface groups, switching MXenes between hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature. Inspired by the highly efficient photothermal conversion performance, Zhao et al.127 deliberately designed a salt-blocking Ti3C2Tx nanosheet membrane to split water from seawater under sunlight via distillation. A hydrophobic nature was required to prevent liquid water leakage and infiltration in membrane distillation. Therefore, hydrophobicity was brought about by them via PFDTMS functionalization. The reaction between O–CH2CH3 in PFDTMS and the –OH group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx can introduce hydrophobic groups to the surface of Ti3C2Tx.148
In conclusion, surface functionalization is of great value to MXenes. By means of grafting different functional groups onto the surface, MXenes can be either enhanced in terms of their electronic properties or introduced into the pharmacy field. Specifically, as an important application of functionalized MXene, the photothermal therapy using MXene has attracted a lot of research attention. Some researchers focused on the biocompatibility, grafting SP to make MXene a more ideal candidate for tumor treatment. Others focused on the enhancement of the photothermal effect. As stated above, SP-functionalized MXenes demonstrated better biocompatibility while showing inferior photothermal performance to –Al(OH)4− functionalized ones. Thus it follows naturally that if more than one functional group is introduced to an MXene, it could make the MXene possess multiple features simultaneously. Furthermore, following the same methodology reviewed above, more functional groups can be grafted onto MXenes, eventually making them more versatile materials.
4. Defect engineering of MXenes
Defects usually significantly affect the surface properties of 2D materials, including MXenes.149–153 Therefore, the detailed understanding of the ultrathin structure and defects is significant for shedding light on the physicochemical properties of 2D materials. Defects have been studied in various 2D materials such as MoS2,154 WS2,155 VSe2,156 graphene,157 NbSe2,158 and g-C3N4.159 Defects can also be generated on MXenes during their preparation process and have exhibited a great effect on the properties of MXenes.160
4.1 Generation of defects in MXenes
Among various defect-containing MXenes, Ti3C2 MXene is the most widely studied. While oxygen vacancies can be formed through post-treatment with reducing gases, Ti defects, including point defects and defect clusters, can be formed during the etching process, and the defect concentration can be adjusted by altering the HF concentration.32,161 Moreover, the chemical properties and electronic structure of the monolayer Ti3C2Tx can be modified by the Ti defects on their surface.162 Usually, the defects are inclined to form on the top and bottom of the ultrathin MXene layer due to their direct contact with the etching agent (e.g., HF). Based on the DFT simulation results, the defects are much easier to form in the outer Ti sublayer (formation energy: 2.842 eV) than in the inner Ti sublayer (formation energy: 6.485 eV).161
Etching conditions play an important role in the nature of the surface defects of MXenes. When LiF/HCl was used as the etching agent, the concentration and category of the surface defects were greatly affected by the etching time. For example, a shorter etching time resulted in fewer surface defects on the Ti3C2Tx.149 Furthermore, the lateral size of the Ti3C2Tx was destroyed with increasing etching time, increasing the roughness of the Ti3C2Tx surface. And the point defects could be extended into line and 2D surface defects when the etching time was prolonged. In addition, the Ti atoms would be depleted during the prolonged etching time, and the C atoms left in the MXene spontaneously agglomerated into a carbon layer, which favors the formation of the graphitic carbon. In the meantime, the oxide was also inevitably generated during the etching process. In other words, high-quality MXenes with fewer defects can be obtained with less etching time. However, the Al cannot be removed entirely from the Ti3AlC2 to form the Ti3C2Tx MXene when the etching time is not long enough.
In addition, the formation energy of the defects can be affected by the surface terminations. For example, the formation energy of Ti defects on the –O-terminated Ti3C2Tx is much higher than that for bare Ti3C2, while the –F- and –OH-terminated Ti3C2Tx exhibit comparable formation energy of Ti defects to that of bare Ti3C2.161,163 Similar results were obtained for the Mo2TiC2Tx MXene.150 The formation of Mo, Mo2, MoTi, Mo2Ti, and MoMo defects on the Mo2TiC2Tx MXene terminated by oxygen is more energy consuming than that for the non-terminated MXene and the MXenes terminated by fluorine and hydroxide, which might originate from the effect of the surface functions on the bond strength of the MXenes. On the surface of MXenes, O atoms share two electrons to form a covalent bond with transition metals, while the F and O atoms form single and double bonds with the surface, respectively. Moreover, –F and –OH groups receive only one electron from the surface, indicating that O atoms form stronger bonds with the surface. Therefore, the binding between atoms is stiffer in the MXenes terminated by –O than those terminated by –F or –OH.150 However, the relationship between the location of the defect and the surface termination or the effect of defects on the concentration of surface termination has not been investigated, and more efforts should be made in this field in the near future.
4.2 Effect of atomic defects on the electrical conductivity of MXenes
The structural quality and the electrical conductivity of MXenes can be controlled by tuning their surface Ti and C defects, and the electromagnetic interference attenuation ability of the MXene film can be influenced by the defect and the oxidative products. For instance, the electrical conductivity of the few-layer Ti3C2Tx (f-Ti3C2Tx) membrane was significantly decreased with the increase of the etching time from 48 to 216 h, due to the increase in the Ti and C defects of f-Ti3C2Tx with increased etching times.149 In addition, the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) performance of the Ti3C2Tx MXene film with fewer defects (31.97 dB) is better than that of the defect-containing Ti3C2Tx MXene (3.164 dB). Moreover, the Ti3C2Tx MXene with fewer defects possesses abundant free electrons with high electron mobility. Therefore, most of the incoming EM waves were nullified by the highly oriented charge carriers via ohmic conduction loss (Fig. 12), and the EM waves were mostly reflected on the f-Ti3C2Tx. Moreover, the absorbed EM waves on f-Ti3C2Tx vanished in the form of heat in the EMI shielding process. To sum up, the enhanced electromagnetic interference attenuation ability of the MXenes can be obtained by controlling the density of defects and the structural quality of the MXenes in the preparation process.

The number of oxygen vacancies on the MXene surface can be increased by post-processing with a reducing gas. Oxygen vacancy enriched Ti3C2Tx flakes were prepared by reducing Ti3C2Tx with H2/Ar gas (H:Ti3C2Tx).164 Notably, due to the terminated –O and –OH groups on the Ti3C2Tx surface, it is possible to substitute the carbon in Ti3C2Tx by the oxygen of –O and –OH groups. Therefore, it is possible to generate the elemental carbon species, and part of the Ti3C2Tx can be oxidized to TiO2. The H:Ti3C2Tx was combined with Cu2O to form a composite photocathode by a dip-coating method for unassisted solar water splitting. The conductivity, light-harvesting efficiency, and charge-transfer ability of the fabricated H:Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O photocathode can be greatly enhanced by introducing oxygen vacancies to the Ti3C2Tx. The H:Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O photocathode displayed enhanced photoelectrochemical performance with a photocurrent density of −5.41 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which is 1.35, 1.26, and 1.22 times higher than those of Cu2O, Au/Cu2O and Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O photocathodes, respectively. The exceptional performance of H:Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O is ascribed to the enriched oxygen vacancies in the H:Ti3C2Tx which can enhance the light-harvesting efficiency, conductivity, and charge-transfer ability of the photocathode. Moreover, the result indicated that the Ti3C2Tx is superior to noble metal Au for enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of the Cu2O photocathode.
4.3 Effect of atomic defects on the ion diffusion in MXenes
Defects in MXenes can provide potential pathways for ion transport and diffusion. Titanium-deficient nitrogen-containing MXenes can also be used in potassium metal batteries. For example, the defect-rich and nitrogen-containing MXene (DN-MXene) exhibits potassium-philic characteristics and can induce the nucleation of K atoms, thus restraining dendritic growth during the plating/stripping process. The titanium-deficient nitrogen-containing MXene was coupled with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to obtain the DN-MXene/CNT scaffold, reducing local current density and promoting homogeneous K ionic flux attributed to the high electronic conductivity and fast K ion diffusion.165 In addition, when the K@DN-MXene/CNT metal anodes were used in K–S batteries, the matrix can protect the K metal from the shuttle effect of polysulfides by restraining the dendrite growth, which greatly enhances the electrochemical performances of the K–S batteries.
Structural holes can be created by partially etching the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with the H2SO4 oxidizing agent as the etchant, and the etched Ti3C2Tx nanosheets can be used to optimize the ion pathway in the Ti3C2Tx film for practical high-rate supercapacitors.166 As shown in Fig. 13, nanometer-size holes/pores can be generated in the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets after etching, while the crystal structure of Ti3C2Tx around the holes was not changed, which indicated that the high electron conductivity and high pseudocapacitance of Ti3C2Tx were retained. In addition, a few electrochemically inactive side-products, such as TiO2, were generated on the Ti3C2Tx surface. When the etched Ti3C2Tx was used to form the Ti3C2Tx film, the restacking issue was alleviated compared to the pristine Ti3C2Tx. Moreover, a hierarchical ion path “highway” in Ti3C2Tx film can also be fabricated with atomic level increased interlayer spacing, porous structure, and reduced flake size. Consequently, ultrahigh rate performance can be obtained with high volumetric capacitance.

4.4 Effect of atomic defects on the redox ability of MXenes
The surface defect engineering of MXenes exhibits a great effect on the electrical conductivity, electronic structure and redox ability.167,168 For example, Gogotsi et al.169 reported that monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes with well-defined and clean edges and visually defect-free surfaces exhibited a field-effect electron mobility of 2.6 ± 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a low resistivity of 2.31 ± 0.57 μΩ m (4600 ± 1100 S cm−1). Chen et al.170 used acid molecular (hydrofluoric acid) scissors to controllably tailor titanium atoms and obtain redox-active sites for pseudocapacitive reactions. During the tailoring process, Ti vacancies can be formed in Ti3CNTx MXenes, and the atomic arrangement in the Ti3CNTx nanosheets became disordered. Moreover, three kinds of active nitrogens, pyridinic-N, pyridinic-N–O and pyrrolic-N, were generated after tailoring by hydrofluoric acid. These active nitrogens can supply additional negative charges via their lone electron pairs to adsorb electrolyte ions and further promote redox reactions, which will synergistically contribute to partial pseudocapacitance of Ti3CNTx. As a result, the tailored Ti3CNTx exhibits a significantly improved electrochemical performance with the specific capacitance reaching 376 F g−1 and 230.68 mF cm−2, much higher than that of the original Ti3CNTx (237 F g−1 and 168.27 mF cm−2).
4.5 Effect of atomic defects on the surface adsorption properties of MXenes
The surface adsorption properties of MXenes can be tuned by defect engineering.171 For instance, the adsorption of N2 molecules on Ti3C2 can be enhanced by introducing Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2 surface.172 The Ti vacancies induce a strong adsorption energy for nitrogen atoms on the surface of BiOBr/Ti3C2 according to the DFT calculations, which enhanced the adsorption capacity for N2 on the BiOBr/Ti3C2 composite catalyst. Moreover, the P-electron feedback caused by Ti vacancies could effectively promote the weakening of the NN triple bond and elongate the N2 bond length by ∼31.6%, thus facilitating the activation of N2 molecules. With the 10 wt% BiOBr/Ti3C2 composite as the catalyst for photocatalytic N2 fixation, the evolution rate of NH3 reaches 234.6 μmol g−1 h−1, which is approximately 48.8 times and 52.4 times higher than those of pure BiOBr and Ti3C2, respectively.172 In addition, the Ti atom vacancies can also greatly improve the adsorption ability of Ti3C2Tx towards NO2 and improve its detection sensitivity.173
4.6 Challenges for the defect engineering of MXenes
The control of defect type and concentration in the preparation process of MXenes is quite challenging, especially in the etching process. Some progress has been made in introducing ordered defects into MXenes which can impact electrical conductivity. For example, 2D Mo1.33C MXene sheets with ordered metal divacancy were prepared by selectively etching both Al and Sc from the 3D atomic laminate (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC.174 The 2D Mo1.33C with ordered metal divacancy shows 65% higher volumetric capacitance than Mo2C with no vacancy at ∼1100 F cm−3. Notably, 2D Mo1.33C MXene flakes with ordered vacancies can be obtained in aqueous environments by the top-down method, and the yield is close to 100%,9 indicating that the MXene flakes can be prepared on a large scale. In general, a more effective and controllable strategy needs to be developed for the controllable preparation of defect-containing MXenes. Moreover, further efforts should be focused on revealing the properties of the defect-containing MXenes, which is essential for their practical application.
5. Metal/nonmetal doped MXenes
The defects on the surface of MXenes are generally unstable and reactive. Therefore, MXenes are easily doped with metal or nonmetal atoms, which will tremendously affect the physicochemical properties of MXene.
5.1 Metal doped MXenes
When metal salt precursors are in contact with the surface of the defective MXenes, the metal cations can be reduced by the MXenes even without any additional reducing agent.175,176 Notably, the surface terminations on the top and the bottom sublayer of the MXenes, such as –O, –OH, and –F, are beneficial for electrostatically adsorbing the positively charged metal precursor, which is favorable for the subsequent reduction and the immobilization of the metal cations. Furthermore, the strong interaction between the metal atoms and the MXenes is conducive to the stability of the metal atoms and has a great effect on the electronic and chemical properties of the metal atoms.177 In this case, the goal of maximized utilization of noble metals can be achieved. For instance, Pt4+ in the [PtCl6]2− complex ions can be reduced by the highly reductive Ti defects on the surface of Ti3−xC2Ty at room temperature, forming Pt1/Ti3−xC2Ty162 whose electron microscopy image is shown in Fig. 14. Notably, the Pt atoms were stabilized in the Ti defects by substitution and formed strong Pt–C bonds, confirmed by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Interestingly, only with a very small density of Pt (0.4 mmol%) did the Pt1/Ti3−xC2Ty show better catalytic performance than that of the commercial Pt catalysts and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Ti3−xC2Ty for the N-formylation of CO2 and aniline under ambient pressure.

(c) Corresponding intensity map obtained along line 1 in (b).

Aside from the Pt atom, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Pd can also be self-reduced in the Ti defects on the surface of MXenes.162,178 Ru3+ was directly reduced to Ru0 on Ti3C2 to form nanoconfined Ti3C2/Ru without any additional reductant. The resulting Ti3C2/Ru was used as the co-catalyst of TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 evolution.178 During the reduction process of Ru, Ti3C2 was oxidized with the transformation of the Ti–OH surface termination into Ti–O, which created a strong interaction between Ti3C2 and Ru. Ru was agglomerated into nanoclusters and dispersed on the Ti3C2 surface during the hydrothermal process, and the Ru0 was not oxidized to RuO2 after hydrothermal treatment, indicating its high stability. However, the interaction with Ti3C2 during the hydrothermal process caused a change in the work function of Ru, resulting in the low Fermi level of the Ti3C2/Ru system. When Ti3C2/Ru was used as the co-catalyst of TiO2, the photogenerated electrons on the TiO2 aggregated on Ti3C2/Ru could promote the H2 production without any induction period. In addition, Ru can also be reduced on the Mo-deficient defect sites of the Mo2CTx MXene to form the Ru doped Mo2CTx.179 The single-atom Ru anchored on the defect sites of the Mo2CTx nanosheets acted as the electron back-donation centers for N2 activation, promoting N2 adsorption and activation and reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier of the first hydrogenation step. Therefore, the hydrogenation of the adsorbed N2 was facilitated, promoting the formation of ammonia.
5.2 Nonmetal doped MXenes
In addition to metal doping, introducing surface vacancies and nonmetal dopants is also a feasible way to engineer the MXene surface. The Ti3+ species in Ti3−xC2Ty MXene were verified to be the intrinsic active sites for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction, and the electronic state of the Ti3+ species can be tuned by vacancy and heteroatom doping.180 For example, the surface Ti vacancies at the optimal level can trap electrons, and the trapped electrons can be injected into an antibonding orbital of adsorbed N2 by the Ti3+–N2 dp π-back donation interactions, which promotes N2 activation. In addition, the N-dopant species can not only minimize the orbital overlap between N2 and Ti3+ and decrease the reaction energy barrier to facilitate the desorption of NH3, but can also act as the steady active sites for the nitrogen reduction reaction. Moreover, the activation barriers and kinetic desorption of NH3 can be alleviated by optimizing the Ti vacancy density and N doping content in the Ti3−xC2Ty MXene.
Sulfur (S) can be used as the mediator to modulate the surface chemistry and microstructure of MXenes. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized S-doped mesoporous Ti3C2Tx films and used them for electrochemical sodium-ion storage (ESS). In the S-doped mesoporous Ti3C2Tx films, S was doped into the Ti3C2Tx structure by forming the Ti–S bond instead of the free elemental S. The Ti–S bond not only improves the electrolyte wettability, but also enhances the electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx. Moreover, the sulfur content has a great effect on the performance of the S-doped Ti3C2Tx films. When the nominal sulfur to Ti3C2Tx ratio was controlled to be 100% in the S-doped Ti3C2Tx films (denoted as SMX-100), the electrical conductivity of the SMX-100 (2500 S cm−1) was much higher than that of Ti3C2Tx films (denoted as PMX, 625 S cm−1). In addition, the initial reversible capacity of the SMX-100 electrode (161.4 mA h g−1) is higher than that of PMX (20.5 mA h g−1), and the SMX-100 electrode exhibited decreased charge-transfer resistance (115 Ω) compared to that (371 Ω) of PMX, indicating the improvement of ion and electron transfer that results in the excellent sodium storage performances of SMX-100. However, S-doped Ti3C2Tx films made from S/Ti3C2Tx with higher S ratios such as 200% and 400% broke into pieces, which cannot be used directly as freestanding electrodes for ESS.
5.3 Challenges for metal/nonmetal doped MXenes
Metal/nonmetal doping on the defect sites of MXenes shows great potential in regulating and controlling the surface properties of the MXenes. However, due to the difficulty in defect control (density and structure) of MXenes, precise metal/nonmetal doping on the MXene surface is very difficult. In addition, the stability of the doping heteroatom on the MXene surface needs to be improved for long-term use. Some heteroatom-doped MXenes were investigated by DFT calculation, while those heteroatom-doped MXenes were rarely reported experimentally. Therefore, more efforts are needed to exploit and utilize doped MXenes.
6. Surface oxidation of MXenes
MXenes are generally not stable under ambient conditions due to the collective effects of air, moisture, and light. For example, the surface of Ti3C2Tx can be oxidized to TiO2 under atmospheric conditions with water and oxygen, and the water molecules inserted between the MXene layers can accelerate the oxidation of the MXene.181,182 Such an oxidation of the MXene destroys the structural integrity and affects or changes the performance of the MXene flakes, such as the electrical properties, surface structure, and chemical constitution, which affect their potential applications.
6.1 Factors impacting the oxidation of MXenes
MXenes prepared by exfoliation methods are generally stored in deionized (DI) water due to their hydrophilic nature, and the MXene flakes easily form an aqueous colloidal suspension. However, MXenes are not stable in DI water because oxygen dissolved in DI water can oxidize MXenes into their oxidized forms.
Taking Ti3C2Tx, the most widely investigated MXene, as an example, when the Ti3C2Tx aqueous colloidal solutions were stored in an open vial, the Ti3C2Tx was degraded by 42%, 85%, and 100% after 5, 10, and 15 days, respectively, resulting in the formation of the oxide (mainly anatase TiO2) colloidal solutions.183 In the degradation process, the degradation of MXene starts at the edges, and the degradation kinetics follows a single exponential decay (Fig. 15a), and elevated temperatures can greatly accelerate the degradation process. The lateral size of the MXene also has a great effect on the degradation process. MXene flakes with smaller lateral size are less stable than those with larger size. Notably, the degradation of MXene colloidal solution can be suppressed substantially by removing the dissolved oxygen from water with Ar (Fig. 15b). However, the flakes still decay slowly over time due to the reaction between MXene and water (water is used as the mild oxidant) (Ti3C2O2 + 4H2O = 3TiO2 + 2C + 4H2), and the Ti3C2Tx could be degraded by 1.2% over 25 days.183 To improve the stability of the MXene, separating the MXene flakes from water via vacuum-assisted filtration is considered an effective means because the compact morphology between the MXene layers prevents the inner MXene flakes from interacting with humid air.183
 Fig. 15  Schematics of degradation of the colloidal d-Ti3C2Tx MXene aqueous solution in (a) air @ RT and (b) Ar @ RT. In panel a, the high solubility of oxygen in water provides a continuous source for MXene degradation. In panel b, in the absence of dissolved oxygen, water (a mild oxidant) slowly degrades the MXene flakes in the Ar-based environment.

To reveal the key factors responsible for the oxidation of MXenes in aqueous solution, Mochalin et al.184 studied the hydrolysis of two Ti-based MXenes. They found that the Ti3C2Tx was still degraded in water in an oxygen-less atmosphere, which is in accord with the results obtained by Gogotsi et al.183 Over half of the Ti3C2Tx was oxidized to TiO2 over ∼41 days in the water/Ar atmosphere. The degradation process of Ti3C2Tx can be accelerated in the presence of O2. Surprisingly, when the Ti3C2Tx was preserved in the isopropanol/O2 environment, the time constant for degradation of Ti3C2Tx was over 5 years. Therefore, it was concluded that water, rather than O2, plays a critical role in the degradation reactions of the MXene, and it is water that MXenes should be protected from to improve their stability.184 Yet, it is to be determined whether this applies to other metal-based MXenes.
The formation of defects is usually unavoidable in the process of exfoliation of MXenes, and these defects have a great effect on the surface oxidation of MXenes. For example, the positively charged Ti-vacancies in Ti3C2 cause the C4− to lose electrons and be oxidized, prompting amorphous carbon formation. Once the oxidation of MXene starts, the number and the size of pores become larger and larger, which promotes further oxidation.181 Notably, the TiO2 nanoparticles formed on the MXene surface are usually close to the pores formed by Ti-vacancies at the early oxidation stage. The edges, peaks, or valleys of wrinkles of the MXene are the sites for electron accumulation, and the Ti cations are more likely to be oxidized at these positions. Moreover, an internal electric field can be formed by the separation of electrons and holes, which promotes the Ti cation diffusion and the oxidation of the MXene.181 With time, MXenes are converted entirely into oxides. Therefore, it can be concluded that MXenes with fewer defects are more stable under environmental conditions.
An interesting question is how much oxygen the MXene surface can take before it breaks. To answer this question, Persson et al.185 studied the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx treated at different temperatures (100, 175, 350, 400, and 450 °C) in an oxygen environment. The surface of the Ti3C2Tx is saturated by O at 100 °C (Ti3C2Ox, x = 2) and the oxygen content is relatively stable. When Ti3C2Tx was exposed to oxygen at higher temperatures, the MXene structure was transformed into TiO2 and released H2O and CO2 reaction products. According to the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the oxidized Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 16), a gradual increase in disorder can be observed from room temperature to 400 °C. The MXene lattice was barely visible from the HRTEM images after exposure of Ti3C2Tx single sheets to O2 at 400 °C, reaching a coverage of 1.74 O atoms per surface Ti atom (Ti3C2Ox, x = 3.48). Upon further increase to 450 °C, the MXene structure disappeared with the Ti:O ratio close to that of TiO2. In this case, it can be concluded that the O terminations can reach supersaturation with x ≈ 3.5 while the structure of the Ti3C2Tx could be maintained.

KGaA, Weinheim. 
The temperature and the heating rate greatly affect the oxidation process and the crystalline phase of the oxides on MXenes. For example, when Ti3C2 was placed in the presence of an oxidizing environment, flash oxidation (oxidation at higher temperatures for a short period of time – a few tenths of a second) leads to the formation of mainly anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, while rutile TiO2 thin sheets can be obtained by slow heating over an extended period of time at lower temperatures.186 The top and bottom Ti layers were first transformed into TiO2, followed by the oxidation of the middle Ti layer. The oxidation of the carbon is also possible during the oxidation of Ti. However, Ti is preferentially oxidized due to the more negative Gibbs energy of Ti than that of carbon. In this case, carbon supported TiO2 is usually formed after the oxidation of the Ti3C2 MXene.
6.2 Applications of oxidized MXenes
On the positive side, the oxidation of MXenes can be considered as a promising strategy to form MXene-based composites when the oxidation kinetics can be controlled. MXene-based composites, such as the combinations of MXenes with SnO2,187 ZnO,188 Nb2O5,189 and TiO2,190 have received a lot of attention in the fields of electromagnetic interference shielding, biomedicine, optoelectronics, photocatalysis, and energy storage. For instance, the Ti3C2Tx MXene films that underwent partial oxidation (obtained from the spontaneous oxidation of MXene flakes) showed a strong photo-response in the ultraviolet region.23 Furthermore, the relaxation process of photoexcited charge carriers takes a long time (∼24 h), which makes the Ti3C2Tx MXene films a potential material for photoresistors with memory effects for application in optical detectors or comparators. In addition, the relaxation process can be greatly accelerated in an atmosphere containing oxygen and water vapor. This process is reversible, which makes the Ti3C2Tx films attractive materials in photo- and environmental sensing.23
Gogotsi et al.191 found that the oxidation of the MXene surface can be controlled by using CO2 as a soft oxidant. We also synthesized Nb2O5/C/Nb2C (MXene) composites by controlling the oxidation process of the Nb2C surface with CO2 as a mild oxidant.192 The surface of the Nb2C MXene was oxidized to Nb2O5 at 850 °C in the CO2 atmosphere. In addition, the thickness of the Nb2O5 layer became thicker with increasing oxidation time, and the molar ratio of Nb2O5/Nb2C increased from 0.36 to 1.07 with the oxidation time from 0.5 to 1.5 h. With the controlled oxidation process, an intimate contact interface was formed between Nb2O5 and the conductive Nb2C (Fig. 17), which favored the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of water splitting. Notably, some amorphous carbon was also formed during the surface oxidation reaction, and the amorphous carbon is likely to function as a “binder” to maintain the structural integrity and the electron channel between Nb2O5 and Nb2C.

Due to the thermodynamically metastable transition metal atoms on the MXene surface, the transition metal atoms can be oxidized to metal oxide. For instance, oxygen-vacancy-rich TiO2 nanoparticles can be in situ grown on the surface of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to form the TiO2/Ti3C2Tx composite by a one-step ethanol thermal treatment.193 In this TiO2/Ti3C2Tx system, the oxygen vacancies of TiO2 act as the main active sites for ammonia synthesis, and the highly conductive interior Ti3C2Tx layers could not only promote the electron transport but also efficiently avoid the self-aggregation of the TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, due to the synergistic effects between TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx, the TiO2/Ti3C2Tx catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic performance than those of pure Ti3C2Tx and TiO2 for the N2 reduction reaction.
Partially oxidized MXene sheets can also be utilized for memory storage and electronic synapse applications. For example, partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx sheets obtained by etching Ti3AlC2 at higher temperature (65 °C) can be used for memristors with synapse and threshold resistive switching characteristics.194 A small quantity of TiO2 particles was produced in the partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx sheet, and these TiO2 particles hampered the connections of Ti3C2Tx sheets, and hence the conductivity was very close to that of an insulator. In addition, the partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx sheets cannot exhibit compact restacking with the TiO2 particles on the surface acting as the spacer, and such spaces can provide a path for silver migration during the threshold switching. According to the threshold switching behaviors in Ag/Ti3C2Tx NS/Pt device (NS denotes nanosheets),194 the successive emulation of versatile synaptic functions, such as paired-pulse facilitation, post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation, long-term potentiation, and transition from short-term potentiation to long-term potentiation memorization, was demonstrated, which exhibited the promising application of MXenes in the field of electronic devices.
The surface of the V2CTx MXene is metastable and tends to be oxidized in water, and the a-VOx/V2C (a denotes amorphous) nanohybrid can be obtained by anodic oxidation at 1.8 V for 4 h in an aqueous electrolyte.195 As can be observed in Fig. 18, V atoms in the outer surface of V2CTx can react with H2O to form the amorphous and nanoscale VOx layer, which was conformally coated on the V2CTx core. After the anodic oxidation, the surface of V2CTx becomes rougher due to the production of the nanoscale a-VOx layer, and the thickness of the VOx layer is around 4–14 nm. When the a-VOx/V2C nanohybrid was used as a structured electrode, the amorphous and nanoscale VOx layer could promote the diffusion of Na+, provide a great deal of vacancies and active sites for Na+ storage, and alleviate the corresponding volume changes simultaneously. In addition, the V2C layer maintained the structural integrity of the electrode and acted as a conductive and robust skeleton for efficient ion/electron transport. Therefore, when the a-VOx/V2C composite was used as the cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, the a-VOx/V2C electrode exhibited high capacity, decent rate capability, and long-term cycling stability.

Oxidation of MXenes has also attracted attention in the field of photovoltaic devices, such as perovskite solar cells. The properties of the electron transport layer (ETL) fabricated from Ti3C2Tx can be tuned by the oxidation of the MXene.196 The macroscopic defects of the film fabricated by spin-coating can be reduced by the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx with the generation of Ti–O bonds. Notably, the metallic material can be transformed into a semiconductor after heavy oxidation, resulting in a better matching of energy levels between the electron transport layers and perovskite, indicating that the oxidized Ti3C2Tx is more suitable as the ETL for perovskite solar cells. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.29% can be achieved for perovskite solar cells when composited with heavily oxidized Ti3C2Tx as the ETL, which is higher than that (16.5%) when using pristine Ti3C2Tx as the ETL. The enhanced PCE can be ascribed to the increased electron mobility in the ETL and the reduced electron–hole recombination.
6.3 Oxidation resistant MXenes
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the oxidation of MXenes. On the one hand, by controlling the oxidation degree of MXenes to synthesize MXene-based composites, such as MXene-based photocatalysts among others, the application of MXenes can be broadened. On the other hand, the oxidation of MXenes will reduce its stability, destroy the structural integrity, and decrease the electrical properties, which will prevent their further commercial applications. Therefore, the oxidation of MXene should be controlled in some cases while be restrained in others. Various strategies have been developed by researchers to protect MXenes from oxidation, as summarized in Table 3. In addition, a couple of typical antioxidation strategies for MXenes are discussed below.

It is very practical to store MXenes in a controlled environment to maintain their structural integrity. In contrast to high temperatures which can accelerate the oxidation of MXenes, lowering the temperature can slow down the oxidation of MXenes. Taking Ti3C2Tx as an example, the resistance of Ti3C2Tx sheets is kept constant for 39 weeks at −80 °C due to the low diffusion rate of the oxidants.182 Because moisture is an accelerant to the oxidation reaction of MXenes, another valid way to improve the stability of MXenes is to store them in an anhydrous organic solvent, such as anhydrous ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. When MXenes are stored in organic solvent, it is possible that the organic molecules will adsorb on the surface or insert into the interlamination of the MXenes, which will inhibit the diffusion of gas molecules and gas adsorption. For example, when Ti3C2Tx was stored in anhydrous ethanol at 5 °C, the resistance of the MXene could be kept constant for 10 weeks.182
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) can also be used as an anti-oxidative dispersion medium for MXenes. For instance, DESs with hydrogen bond accepting and donating molecules can passivate the surface of the Ti3C2Tx and prevent the oxidation reaction.200Fig. 19 shows a schematic illustration of the oxidation behavior of Ti3C2Tx. As shown in Fig. 19, the Ti3C2Tx dispersed in water was oxidized within a month. However, when the Ti3C2Tx was dispersed in DESs, such as urea:choline chloride (urea:ChCl) and ethylene glycol:choline chloride (EG:ChCl), the Ti3C2Tx did not show any obvious changes after storage for more than 28 weeks. The enhanced stability of Ti3C2Tx in the DESs can be ascribed to the following reasons. The DES molecules adhere onto the surface of Ti3C2Tx, and strong hydrogen bonds can be formed between each DES molecule and the functional groups on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Therefore, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, such as urea and ChCl, formed an atomically thin passivation layer surrounding Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, which prevented the oxidation reaction.

The Ti3C2Tx dispersed in water (a) undergoes oxidation within a month, while that dispersed in a DES (b) shows long-term oxidation stability for up to 28 weeks.

Removing the extrinsic intercalants in MXene film by a proton acid colloidal processing approach is a feasible way to enhanced the stability of the MXene. For example, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets processed with 0.1 M HCl exhibited enhanced conductivity, mechanical strength, and environmental stability compared with the untreated Ti3C2Tx.199 This enhanced stability can be ascribed to the absence of extrinsic intercalants after proton acid processing, which makes Ti3C2Tx films stable to humidity by blocking the intercalation of H2O/O2. Therefore, the conductance in Ti3C2Tx films remained at 79% of its original value after two weeks' storage in a 100% RH environment, while the untreated Ti3C2Tx films only retained 8% conductivity. In addition, the mechanical performance of the Ti3C2Tx film obtained via proton acid-processing was also improved.
Modification of MXenes with Zn2+ ions and self-assembly with hydrophobic RGO nanosheets to form 3D porous MXene/graphene composites can enhance the stability of MXenes.202 The 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/graphene composite with 5% RGO exhibited no obvious decay in electrical conductivity after 60 days. With the assistance of the sacrificial metallic zinc template, the in situ produced Zn2+ ions destroy the electrostatic repulsive forces between Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and act as crosslinking sites for the self-assembly of RGO nanosheets and Ti3C2Tx. Moreover, the oxygen-containing terminal groups on the Ti3C2Tx surface and edge sites were reduced by metallic zinc powder as an antioxidant, and the in situ produced Zn2+ ions formed bonds with the hydroxy groups on Ti3C2Tx, which can remove the nucleation sites for TiO2 nanoparticles and suppress the oxidation of the Ti3C2Tx. In addition, the hydrophobic RGO connected with the Ti3C2Tx can act as shielding layers to prevent the surface of Ti3C2Tx from being exposed to oxygen and moisture. The above reasons account for the enhanced stability of the Ti3C2Tx.
7. Theoretical calculation of MXene surface engineering
In addition to experimental studies, theoretical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been extensively applied to understand MXene surface engineering in order to predict the properties of MXenes with different surfaces. When combined with experimental work, the theoretical studies can provide more comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of MXenes and thus provide insights into the rational design of new promising MXene-based materials.
7.1 Prediction of defect formation
The formation of surface defects and the properties of defective MXenes can be predicted by theoretical calculations. For example, DFT calculations indicated that the formation energy (0.6–2.7 eV) of carbon vacancies in Ti2CT2 MXene is lower than that of graphene while the migration energy is high.203 Therefore, carbon vacancies are thermodynamically stable on the MXene surface. Moreover, the electronic conduction and the stiffness of Ti2CT2 can be regulated by introducing carbon vacancies. In addition, the carrier mobility of the Ti2CO2 can also be regulated by O-Vacancy-Line (OVL) defects.204 More interestingly, the nonmagnetic Ti2CO2 MXene can be transformed into the magnetic state by introducing OVL defects.
Singh et al.205 systematically screened the different types of atomic defects on M2X-type MXenes. They found that higher energy was required for the formation of M2C(VMC) and M2N(VMN) vacancies, while the formation of the M2C(VC) and M2N(VN) vacancies is preferable on M2X-type MXenes, as shown in Fig. 20. In addition, the activation of CO2 on M2X-type MXenes was also investigated, and the M2X-type MXenes from groups III to VII display superb CO2 activation, especially group IV MXenes, such as Ti2X and Zr2X, which exhibit high adsorption energies and charge transfer from M2X MXenes to CO2. Moreover, the chemisorbed CO2 can subsequently dissociate into CO and O species. The CO2 capture, activation, and dissociation abilities of M2X MXenes can be ascribed to the hybridization between the π orbitals of CO2 and d-orbitals of the metal sites in MXenes. Finally, they also proposed that charge transfer from MXenes to CO2 is a better descriptor for quantifying CO2 adsorption on MXenes than the work function.

7.2 Prediction of the application of defect-containing MXenes
The performance of 16 M2XO2-type MXenes (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and X = C, N) with transition metal and carbon/nitrogen vacancies for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated by DFT.206 Two kinds of adsorbates were formed on the M2XO2 surface, one is the –C-coordinated intermediates (e.g., *COOH and *CHO fragments), and another is the –H-coordinated intermediates (e.g., *HCOOH and *H2CO complete molecules). The interaction between the –C-coordinated intermediates and MXenes can be enhanced by introducing transition-metal vacancies, while the interactions between the –H-coordinated intermediates and MXenes are largely unaffected. More importantly, the Fermi level of MXenes changes due to the formation of the vacancies, and the variation of the Fermi level has a good linear relationship with the change of intermediate binding energy, which enables the Fermi level shift to be an ideal descriptor to predict the catalytic activity of defective MXenes. Among 16 types of defective M2XO2, Hf2NO2 with Hf vacancies was regarded as the most promising defective MXene for the CO2RR.206 The CO2 adsorption on defective Mo2TiC2Tx was also studied by DFT, and it was found that the CO2 adsorption was enhanced by forming Mo defects in the monolayer Mo2TiC2Tx.150 However, the CO2 molecule cannot be activated due to the negligible charge transfer from the MXene to CO2, and thus the bond angle of CO2 is not significantly changed.
The conversion of CO into multi-carbon products is very challenging. Based on the DFT calculations, the defective Mo2TiC2O2 MXene with dual-oxygen vacancy (Mo2TiC2O2-2OV) was considered as a potential electrocatalyst for CO reduction into C2 products.207 The dual-oxygen vacancy on the Mo2TiC2O2 surface can provide an appropriate environment to confine and enrich the active *COH species, which boosts the C–C coupling. Notably, the activation energy barrier of C–C coupling is lower than that on the copper surface. In addition, CO adsorption on the Mo2TiC2O2-2OV surface is preferable compared to H2O adsorption, which is beneficial for the reaction of CO reduction to ethanol rather than water reduction to hydrogen. Moreover, Mo2TiC2O2-2OV exhibited higher electron density in the dual-oxygen vacancy, indicating that more electrons can be provided for the electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction. This work shows the potential of Mo2TiC2O2-2OV as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO reduction.
Decorating the defective Mo2−xTiC2Oy MXene with single transition metal (TM) atoms, such as Mo, Ru, Rh, W, Os, and Ir, is also a viable way to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of CO reduction. However, the main product for the heteroatom-decorated Mo2−xTiC2Oy MXene is CH4.208 In this heteroatom-decorated MXene system, the exposed TM–Mo–Mo triangle was regarded as the active site, and the scaling relationship between CO reduction intermediates was broken by the surrounding oxygen atoms via steric hindrance, as shown in Fig. 21. According to the DFT calculation, the W-decorated MXene was considered as the most promising CO reduction electrocatalyst, which exhibited a high selectivity for CH4 production and strong suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.

The synergistic effect of surface vacancy and single transition metal atoms on defective MXenes for nitrogen fixation was investigated by Jiang et al.209 based on DFT calculation. For the transition metal atom embedded Ti3−xC2Oy MXene with surface Ti vacancies, 13 different transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, W, and Pt) were examined. Only Mo or W supported on Ti3−xC2Oy showed promising performance for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as the charges can be transferred between the adsorbed N2 and the Ti3−xC2Oy supports. Furthermore, the embedded transition metals can weaken the NN bond, strengthen the interaction between N2 and the active site, and optimize the binding strength of the key intermediate *N2H. In Ti2−xC2Oy, Cr, Mo, and W were considered as the suitable transition metals. Among them, W/Ti2−xC2Oy can greatly facilitate the NRR while restraining the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, due to the synergistic effect of the exposed Ti atom and the transition metal atom around an extra oxygen vacancy.
Metal clusters can also be doped into defective MXenes and have a great effect on the properties of the MXenes. For example, a Cu3 cluster doped on a monolayer defect-free or defective Mo2CO2 surface was investigated by DFT.210 In the presence of CO under reducing conditions, the Cu3 active site was seriously damaged when it was doped on the surface of the defect-free Mo2CO2. In contrast, when the Cu3 cluster was doped on the O vacancies, formed by removing O atoms from pristine Mo2CO2, Cu3 cannot be oxidized, and the Cu3 doped Mo2CO2 showed superior performance toward CO oxidation. In the CO oxidation reaction, the Cu3 cluster on the defective Mo2CO2 acted as an electron reservoir due to its electron-donating and -accepting ability. The doped Cu3 cluster acted as an electron reservoir to attract the electrons from the defective Mo2CO2 before O2 adsorption, while it donated electrons to O2 after O2 was adsorbed.
Theoretical calculation based on DFT is an effective way to predict the properties of MXenes, which can guide the rational design of MXene-based materials. The electronic structure, surface active sites, gas adsorption, and defect formation energy can be investigated by DFT calculation. In addition, the performance of MXenes in the applications of CO oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and CO2 reduction can also be predicted. However, there is a big gap between the theoretical calculations and the actual experimental environment. Thus, the result of the DFT calculation is for reference only. More experimental research needs to be carried out to verify the results of the theoretical calculation so that an experimental–computational feedback loop can be established.
8. Conclusions and prospects
In this review, we summarized the strategies for the surface engineering of MXenes, i.e., the engineering of surface termination groups, surface functionalization, surface defects, surface doping, and surface oxidation. The impact of these kinds of surface engineering approaches on the performance of MXenes used in energy- and environment-related applications was also described. Moreover, the theoretical simulations of surface engineering for the prediction of the properties of MXenes were also reviewed. The physicochemical properties, such as bandgap structure, electronic conductivity, flexibility, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, magnetism, metallicity, thermal stability and chemical stability, can be tuned by the surface engineering of MXenes. Consequently, surface engineering is a practical way to obtain the desired properties of MXenes due to their wide range of applications.
Despite a large body of work on surface engineering of MXenes in the past decade, there are still a lot of ambiguities about the precise surface control and the relationship between the surface states and the physicochemical properties of MXenes. Therefore, more dedicated work is still needed to shed more light on the surface engineering of MXenes.
Firstly, the current synthesis methods of MXenes are still rough and lead to MXenes with non-uniform surface structures/compositions. To etch the A element from the MAX phase, different kinds of etchants, such as HF, LiF/HCl, NH4HF, etc., have been used. The etching conditions have a great effect on the surface structure of the resulting MXenes, such as the surface terminations, surface terminations and defects. Therefore, it is hard to precisely control the concentration and the ratio of the surface terminations and defects by the wet chemical etching strategy. Moreover, some of the etchants such as HF are quite hazardous and need careful handling. Such a hazardous and less controllable method to obtain MXenes is not practical for the large-scale production of well-defined MXenes. Although there are some greener etching processes using organic bases like TMAOH and TBAOH, a functional layer of –Al(OH)4− groups will be formed and the MXenes are no longer a “pristine” material, which makes it difficult to do further surface manipulations. Therefore, more effort should be invested into the development of safe, reliable, and tunable preparation methods, yielding high-quality MXenes with tunable surface properties. In particular, although the molten salt method is not a well-controlled process yet and is still under development, it can completely avoid the usage of hazardous HF as well as introducing a variety of surface terminations to MXenes. Besides, the process is non-aqueous, which precludes surface oxidation and hydrolysis, making it a “cleaner” process. In the near future, the molten salt method may become a competitive etching process owing to its iconic neatness, versatility, and benignity.
Secondly, the lack of systematic and fundamental study of the relationship between the surface terminations and manipulation parameters limits the development of surface engineering of MXenes. For example, surface alkalization and surface heat treatment are powerful tools when tailoring the amount and composition of surface terminations of MXenes. These processes are quite vulnerable to reaction parameters such as temperature and time. However, limited effort has been made to take a close look at these parameters. The lack of experimental guidance makes it impossible to finely manipulate the surface terminations.
Thirdly, the present surface characterization techniques are insufficient to comprehensively understand the surface characteristics of MXenes, which makes it very difficult to reveal the correlation between the surface characteristics and the performance of MXenes. For example, metal vacancies can be directly observed using STEM, whereas C/N vacancies are very challenging to investigate experimentally. Advanced characterization techniques are in great demand for surface characterization, especially during the engineering processes of MXenes with in situ and operando techniques. In addition, the synergistic combination of experimental studies and theoretical simulations should be pursued to shed light on the relationship between surface engineering and the physicochemical properties of MXenes.
In summary, great achievements have been made on the surface engineering of MXenes since their discovery about 10 years ago. Surface engineering has been demonstrated to be a powerful approach to tailor the properties and functional performances of MXenes. Considering the large family of transition metal cations amendable for incorporation into MXenes, the structural and compositional spaces of MXenes with single and multiple metal cations are enormous. Combined with C, N and O as the X elements, the surface chemistry of MXenes with tunable cations and anions is also boundless. Therefore, the vast opportunities are calling for the development of reliable and controllable surface engineering approaches to finely manipulate the rich physicochemical properties of MXenes and thus to further expand their applications in the fields of energy and the environment as well as others.
