    , Accepted 21st April 2015First published on 21st April 2015AbstractMetastable wurtzstannite Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) nanocrystals were synthesized via a hot-injection method and then used as matrixes to fabricate PtCo–CZGS heterostructured nano-particles. The formed Mott–Schottky heterojunctions in the hybrid nanocrystals promote the transfer of electrons from semiconducting CZGS to metallic PtCo, which accelerates the reduction of I3− to I− in dye-sensitized solar cells.
The rapid expansion of low-cost and effective counter electrode (CE) catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has drawn extensive research interest.1 Ideal CE materials should possess high electrocatalytic activity and conductivity, long-term stability and low fabricating cost. However, due to the high price of noble metals, poor catalytic activity of carbon materials, inferior stability of conductive polymers and low conductivity of transition metal compounds, it is difficult to find a single material to completely meet the required properties of CEs for the large-scale commercial applications of DSSCs.2 Recently, much attention has been paid to develop hybrid CEs to further improve the performance and adaptability of DSSCs. For example, NiS2/reduced graphene oxides3 and CoS/nitrogen-doped graphene4 have shown improved catalytic activity and conductivity. However, most hybrids were fabricated by physically mixing two or even more materials to compensate the deficiency of each individual material.5 Because of the weak interactions among components, such kinds of mixtures are usually difficult to show superior catalytic performance due to the lack of a synergistic effect.
As a kind of hybrid material, metal–semiconductor based Mott–Schottky (M–S) heterojunctions have been widely used as catalysts for redox reactions with satisfactory results.6 The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the charge transfer from a semiconductor to a noble metal, leading to the concentration of electrons onto metal nanocrystals (NCs) under built-in electric fields, which could accelerate catalytic reactions.7 Therefore, it can be expected that CEs composed of M–S heterojunctions would accelerate the reduction of I3− to I− in DSSCs and show improved photovoltaic performance. Our previous work have confirmed that DSSCs with Ag–Ag8SnS6 Mott–Schottky catalysts exhibited better performance than that of Ag or Ag8SnS6.8 On the other hand, recent progress has demonstrated that metal alloy CEs with optimal element ratio can exhibit better catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− than the single component metal CE.9 For instance, a Pt3Ni1 alloy CE provides an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.78% in comparison with that of 8.33% from a Pt CE.9a A CoNi0.25 alloy CE displays a PCE of 8.39% in comparison with that of 1.27% from a pure Co CE and 0.54% from a pure Ni CE.9b Thus, by combining the advantages of their useful structure and efficient materials, CEs composed of metal alloy-chalcogenide M–S heterojunctions would exhibit higher catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− in DSSCs.
Herein, metastable wurtzstannite-type Cu2ZnGeS4 NCs were synthesized and used as seeds to produce PtCo–CZGS hetero-structured nanoparticles. Such hybrid nanoparticles not only can overcome the low conductivity of sulfide and high price of noble metals, but also can enhance the catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− due to the formed M–S heterojunctions. A DSSC with PtCo–CZGS heterostructured NCs as CE material showed a PCE of 8.12%, superior to that of the Pt CE (7.69%) and the PtCo metal alloy CE (7.94%).
Metastable wurtzstannite CZGS NCs were prepared in oleylamine solution with metal complexes and alkanethiols as precursors (see ESI†). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that wurtzstannite CZGS in an orthorhombic structure is obtained (JCPDS No. 26-0572) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The single peak in Raman spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S4, ESI†) exclude the presence of other binary or ternary impurity phases and confirm the composition of the nanocrystals only by CZGS.10 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) demonstrates that the component is composed of Cu, Zn, Ge and S with the molar ratio of 2:1:1.2:3.68. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reveals that the as-prepared CZGS NCs are highly monodispersed with an average diameter of 17 nm (Fig. 1a and Fig. S4, ESI†). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) illustrates the crystalline nature of the sample, and the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.309 nm can be ascribed to the (002) plane of orthorhombic Cu2ZnGeS4 (Fig. 1b).

It is reported that wruzite-type chalcogenides have higher carrier concentration and lower resistivity than the kesterite ones, which exhibited improved PCE in DSSCs (Fig. S5, S6 and Table S1, ESI†).11 Thus, the CZGS NCs with wurtzstannite phase were used as matrixes to fabricate PtCo–CZGS heterostructured NCs according to the reported literature.12 From the TEM and HRTEM images of the obtained PtCo–CZGS hybrids (Fig. 1c and d), no obvious changes in the size and shape of CZGS NCs can be observed after the metal alloy is loaded. The formation of the heterostructured NCs is attributed to the multiple nucleation of metal alloy NCs preferentially at the surface of CZGS NCs, resulting in multiple PtCo NCs with an average size of 2 nm. In general, the composition of PtX (X = Co, Ni, Fe) NCs depends on the amounts of metal precursors in the reaction system.9a,13 Herein, the composition of the PtCo alloy NCs can be easily tuned by changing the amounts of Pt(acac)2 and Co(acac)2 in the synthesis (Fig. S7, ESI†). In the present communication, the optimum element ratio of Pt to Co is kept at 3:1 to get highly efficient CE catalysts (Table S2, ESI†).
To examine the catalytic activity of the as-prepared CEs toward the reduction of an I3− redox shuttle, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in acetonitrile solution. As is shown in Fig. 2a, all CEs exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks. The left one in low potential corresponds to the oxidation (Ox-A) and reduction (Red-A) of I−/I3−, whereas the right one in high potential is assigned to the oxidation (Ox-B) and reduction (Red-B) of I2/I3−.14 Considering the role of the CE in reducing I3− to I− species, the peak current densities of Red-A and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red-A and Ox-A can be employed to evaluate the catalytic activities of different CEs.15 The PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE has a peak current density of 1.84 mA cm−2, which is higher than the values of CZGS, PtCo and pyrolytic Pt CEs. In addition, the Epp of the PtCo–CZGS CE (306 mV) is smaller than that of CZGS (408 mV), PtCo (370 mV) and Pt CEs (371 mV), which is directly responsible for fact that the overpotential loss of the PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE is lower than that of the Pt CE in DSSCs. The higher peak current densities and lower Epp values suggest that the designed hybrid CE presents high catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− to I−, which is a paramount prerequisite for an excellent CE in DSSCs.16

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to investigate the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 2b shows the Nyquist plots of the corresponding symmetrical cells with the equivalent circuit in the inset, and the simulated data from the EIS spectra are summarized in Table 1 and Table S3 (ESI†). The high frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), including the sheet resistance of the two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. The left arc represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) on the CE/electrolyte interface and the corresponding double layer capacitance (CPE), whereas the right one reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte. The Rs value of CZGS is larger than that of Pt and PtCo alloy CEs, implying the lower conductivity of the semiconductor-based CEs. After being loaded by PtCo NCs, the Rs value for the PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE decreases evidently as expected. Nevertheless, it is still larger than that of Pt due to the low load of metal NCs. The simulated Rct value for CZGS is 2.41 Ω cm2, larger than that of Pt and PtCo CEs, revealing its inferior catalytic activity. However, the PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE exhibits the smallest Rct, indicating its highest catalytic activity among the four CEs. In addition, the value of ZN for the PtCo–CZGS CE (0.51 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of CZGS (0.79 Ω cm2), PtCo (0.58 Ω cm2) and Pt (0.84 Ω cm2) CEs, meaning a faster diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte. Tafel polarization was further employed to elucidate the catalytic activity of the CEs (Fig. 2c). The slopes for the anodic or cathodic branches are in the order: PtCo–CZGS > PtCo > Pt > CZGS. The largest slope of the PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE means that it has the highest exchange current density and catalytic activity,17 which is consistent with the results derived from CV and EIS.

The assembled DSSC devices were fabricated to further assess the properties of the CEs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 2d. When the as-synthesized PtCo–CZGS heterostructed NCs are used as CE catalysts, the photovoltaic parameters of the device are Voc = 744 mV, Jsc = 16.14 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.68, thus leading to a PCE of 8.12%, which is better than the other three CEs because of the increased FF and Jsc. An improvement in the FF can be caused by the slightly lower Rct at the electrolyte/CE interface and the lower ZN of I3− in the electrolyte while the increase of Jsc could arise from the M–S heterojunctions formed between sulfide and metal alloys. Therefore, the DSSC assembled with a PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE exhibits higher photovoltaic performance than that of CZGS and PtCo CEs.
To further investigate the role of M–S heterojunctions in catalyzing the reduction of I3− in DSSCs, the band structure of the PtCo–CZGS hybrids is shown in Fig. 3. CZGS is always reported as a p-type semiconductor. However, the excess of alkythiols in the present system may adjust the chemical environment and influence the crystal growth habit, leading to the transformation of a p-type semiconductor into an n-type semiconductor.18 The flatband potential of CZGS is determined to be −0.24 V vs. NHE by dynamic EIS (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Thus, the conduction band (ECB) and the valence band (EVB) of CZGS are −0.44 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively. The results are in agreement with the energy levels calculated from CV (Fig. S10, ESI†). This fact indicates that electrons will flow from an n-type semiconductor to metal when equilibrium is reached, leading to the bend of the conduction band. Therefore, the formed M–S heterojunctions in the PtCo–CZGS CE promote the electron transfer from CZGS to PtCo, resulting in the aggregation of electrons on the PtCo surface. As a consequence, the reduction of I3− to I− is enhanced and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is improved.

The start-up behavior, multiple start/stop capability and photo-current stability (related to CE) are also important parameters for DSSCs. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the start/stop switching of the DSSCs with PtCo–CZGS and CZGS CEs at alternatively on/off illumination, and the Pt based device is also recorded as a reference. The DSSCs with PtCo–CZGS CE and Pt CE have an abrupt photocurrent density up/down at on/off illumination, demonstrating their high catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−. Further studies reveal that PtCo–CZGS CE based cells can retain 99.3% of its initial photocurrent density after a simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5) for 1 hour, while only 96.8% for the Pt CE and 90.1% for the CZGS CE can be retained, indicating the better stability of the PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE (Fig. S12, ESI†). These results are in good agreement with the multicycle CVs and sequential scanning of EIS (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).
In summary, Cu2ZnGeS4 NCs with a novel wurtzstannite phase have been synthesized via a hot-injection method and were further used as matrixes to produce PtCo–CZGS M–S heterojunctions. The rationally designed hybrid CE exhibited better catalytic activity toward I3− reduction in DSSCs because of the efficient electron transfer from a semiconductor to a metal. The DSSC with a PtCo–CZGS hybrid CE exhibits a PCE of 8.12% in comparison to 7.69% for the device with a Pt CE. The work presented here is far from being optimized, but provides a new route or concept to prepare low-cost and highly efficient CE alternatives to the noble Pt metal in DSSCs.
