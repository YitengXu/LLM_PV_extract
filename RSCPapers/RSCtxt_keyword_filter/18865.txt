    , Accepted 26th September 2013First published on 27th September 2013AbstractOwing to the lack of scalable high performance donor materials, studies on mass-produced organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices lag far behind that on lab-scale devices. In this work, we choose 6 already commercially available conjugated polymers and systematically investigate their potential in organic tandem solar cells. All the devices are processed under environmental conditions using doctor-blading, which is highly compatible with mass-production coating technologies. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6–7% are obtained for OPV devices based on different active layers. Optical simulations based on experimental data are performed for all realized tandem solar cells. An efficiency potential of ∼10% is estimated for these compounds in combination with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. In addition, we assume a hypothetical, optimized acceptor to understand the limitation of donors. It is suggested that a PCE of >14% is realistic for tandem solar cells based on these commercially available donor materials. Along with the demonstration of novel intermediate layers we believe that this systematic study provides valuable insight for those attempting to realize the high efficiency potential of tandem architectures.

Broader context
Although lab-scale organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10–12%, the PCEs of large area mass-produced OPV devices, which are mainly based on P3HT:PCBM as the active layer at the moment, are in the 2–3% range. The tandem concept, in which two or more sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra are stacked on each other and connected in series or parallel, is one of the most successful approaches to significantly improve the PCE of OPV devices. The main losses in single-junction OPV devices, such as narrow absorption window and thermalization losses, can be simultaneously addressed by the tandem concept. However, the difficulties in processing tandem architectures as well as the lack of commercially available high performance materials do limit the research relevance in this otherwise exciting field. In this work, we investigate the potential of scalable, already commercially available materials based on experimental data, and analyze the losses in organic tandem solar cells according to optical simulations. The clear lack between achieved performance and expectations is discussed in detail.

1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has been recently boosted to 10–12% (ref. 1 and 2) by using the tandem concept,3,4 in which two or more sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra are stacked on each other and connected in series or parallel. Although the PCE of mass-production compatible single-junction OPV devices is limited to 10–11%,5 organic tandem solar cells comprising two series-connected single-junction cells are able to reach the theoretical PCE of 15%.6 To make full use of the advantages of organic photovoltaics, such as low cost, easy manufacturing and up-scaling, etc., all the components of OPV devices should be fabricated from solution at low temperature and must be compatible with mass-production techniques, such as inkjet printing7 and roll-to-roll production.8 Although the PCE of lab-scale solution-processed OPV devices has exceeded the 10% milestone,9 mass-produced OPV devices are mainly based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) with an averaged practical PCE of ∼3% for single-junction solar cells.10 In spite of the fact that the PCE of P3HT-based single-junction OPV devices has surpassed 6% by replacing PCBM with the indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA),11 the difficulties in synthesizing high-purity ICBA and processing ICBA-based active layers in air limit the current use of P3HT:ICBA for mass-production.12,13 Therefore, design of the commercially available high performance materials is still a significant challenge for mass-production of OPV devices.
Recently, a PCE of ∼4.8% has been achieved for the OPV devices based on commercially available semiconducting materials (GEN-2, provided by Merck) and roll-to-roll coated flexible substrates.14 Nevertheless, the PCE of mass-production compatible OPV devices can be further improved by converting from the single-junction to tandem architectures with complementary absorbing semiconductors. In contrast to conventional photovoltaics, the interconnection of OPV tandem devices is generated by an intermediate layer (IML), generally comprising a hole-transporting layer (HTL) and an electron-transporting layer (ETL).3,4 The holes and electrons that are selectively collected by HTL and ETL should recombine efficiently at the interface of the IML. Owing to the difficulties in robust and efficient IMLs, only a few research groups reported on the organic multi-junction solar cells with all solution-processed IMLs.15–20 Among these reports, P3HT is the most popular donor material for the bottom cell, because the thermal-annealing conditions of the IML limit the usage of alternative wide band-gap donors. Dennler et al.6 predicted a PCE of 15% for organic tandem solar cells from donor materials with a band-gap of 1.6 eV and 1.3 eV, respectively. Tandem solar cells based on a P3HT-based bottom cell (band-gap of 1.9–2.0 eV) have a theoretical PCE of only ∼12%.
Only recently we demonstrated solution-processed IMLs for regular and inverted tandem architectures (see Fig. 1 for device structures) which can be processed at fairly low temperatures.21,22 The excellent functionality of these IMLs allows the use of most high performance donor materials in tandem structures.

It is well known that in a serially connected tandem solar cell the photocurrents generated from sub-cells have to be balanced to maximize the device performance. Optical simulation has been proven as a powerful and reliable method to optimize the layer sequence as well as the layer thickness of tandem solar cells20–24 by calculating the photocurrents of both sub-cells from IQE values only. By combining the outcome of optical simulation with other experimental photovoltaic parameters, such as open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), the estimation for the maximal PCE of organic tandem solar cells has become very reliable. All these calculations so far were based on PCBM as an acceptor. In this work we will change this paradigm and predict the optimized acceptor for a series of commercially available donors. It is generally accepted that organic solar cells lose approximately 0.6 V in Voc due to exciton splitting and quasi Fermi level alignments.5,6 For example, P3HT with a band-gap of 1.8 eV would be expected to show a Voc of 1.2 V with an optimized acceptor, while a single-junction solar cell based on P3HT:PCBM achieves a Voc of only ∼0.6 V. Many efforts have been made to improve the Voc of P3HT-based solar cells by design of novel acceptors. Among them, bis-PCBM25 and ICBA11 are the two most promising alternatives, increasing the Voc of P3HT-based solar cells to 0.72 and 0.84 V respectively.
In this work, we systematically studied the potential of 6 commercially available polymers with different band-gaps for single-junction as well as multi-junction solar cells, always with PCBM as the acceptor. Based on optical simulations we estimated that several of these composites can reach a PCE of ∼10% in the tandem architecture, still with PCBM as an acceptor. Assuming idealized acceptors with a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) difference of only 0.3 eV to the individual donors, efficiencies as high as 15% become possible for already commercially available donor polymers. This strongly underlines the relevance of novel acceptor materials with optimized energy levels.
2. Results and discussion
The band-gaps of all the polymers were determined from the optical absorption spectra of doctor-bladed films (Fig. 2) as summarized in Table 1. The optical band-gaps of polymers ranging from 1.41 to 1.92 eV cover a fairly broad absorption regime being representative for most high performance donor materials. The commercial providers for the materials investigated in this work are also listed in Table 1. It is worthwhile to mention that the two moderate band-gap polymers (GEN-2 and OPV 12) are supposed to replace P3HT or PCDTBT in the front cell. In contrast to P3HT, the new generation of polymers is easily processed at various thicknesses without any specific requirements, such as thermal-annealing treatment, solvent treatment or the use of additives.26 Typical J–V characteristics of single-junction solar cells are depicted in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic values estimated from J–V characteristics and the processing parameters are summarized in Table 2. The averaged photovoltaic values were collected from at least 12 OPV devices. The P3HT:PCBM-based solar cells (Device A) reached an averaged PCE of 3.17%, which is in good agreement with the literature.10 Lowering the band-gap (Device B: Si-PCPDTBT:[60]PCBM) resulted in an increased Jsc and lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (Device C: PCDTBT:[70]PCBM) resulted in an enhanced Voc. However, these two polymer batches gave rather low FF values (<60%) in the inverted architecture, thus limiting their PCE to ∼4.4%, i.e. slightly below the hero values of app. 6%.27 The performance of pDPP5T-2 based single cells reached close to 6% for the inverted (Device E) and the regular (Device H) architecture, respectively. Slightly higher PCE of >6% was obtained for the solar cells based on medium band-gap polymers GEN-2 (Device D and F) and OPV 12 (Device G). In summary, this series of commercially available polymers shows efficiencies in the 6% regime. Pending further optimization it is likely that values above 7% can be reached by modifying the thickness as well as the microstructure of active layers. Most importantly, this performance is met for various architectures and at processing conditions being as close to a production scenario as possible.

Multi-junction OPV devices were constructed based on optimized single-junction cells with the IMLs demonstrated previously.20–22 The J–V characteristics of various multi-junction OPV devices are depicted in Fig. 4a and summarized in Table 3. The multi-junction device incorporating P3HT:[60]PCBM active layers (Tandem A) reached an averaged PCE of ∼3.3%, while the PCE of a multi-junction device was improved to ∼4.85% (Tandem B) by replacing the top cell with Si-PCPDTBT:[60]PCBM. According to the optical simulation performed by Dennler et al.,6 Tandem A (bottom cell: P3HT:PCBM, top cell based on a donor material with a band-gap (EG) of 1.92 eV and a LUMO level (ELUMO) of −2.9 eV) and Tandem B (top cell: PCPDTBT:PCBM, bottom cell based on a donor material with EG of 1.92 eV and ELUMO of −2.9 eV) should give a PCE of ∼3–4% and ∼5–6%, respectively. The difference between experimental and predicted values is mainly due to the relatively low FF of 57% obtained for Tandem B, while the FF value used in previous prediction was of 65%. A PCE of ∼5.54% for Tandem B is achievable by adopting the same Voc and Jsc values (experimental data) and a FF of 65%, again underlining the great value of this PCE prediction routine for understanding and analyzing losses. The relatively low Voc value of the P3HT:[60]PCBM bottom cell limits the PCE to only ∼9% in a tandem architecture with an optimized donor material with EG of 1.6 eV and ELUMO of −4 eV.6 Further boosting the PCE of OPV devices exceeding 10% requires the design of novel donor materials with a deeper HOMO level (EHOMO) as compared to P3HT, or novel acceptor materials with higher ELUMO as compared to PCBM.

Replacing the P3HT:PCBM-based bottom cell with the high Voc composites PCDTBT:PCBM (Device C) or GEN-2:PCBM (Device D) as compared to P3HT:PCBM (Device A) immediately increases the Voc of the respective tandem devices to ∼1.4–1.6 V (Tandem C, D, E and F). Again, the rather low FF values (<60%), most likely due to the use of Si-PCPDTBT in the inverted architecture, the PCE of these devices reached values of 5–6%. Exchanging the bottom cell with the top cell (Tandem G, incorporating a bottom cell based on a low band-gap polymer pDPP5T-2 and a top cell based on a medium band-gap polymer GEN-2) did not improve the overall performance. A PCE of ∼4.6% was obtained for Tandem G which is much lower as compared to Tandem E and F, which are based on a low band-gap polymer Si-PCPDTBT as the top cell. Higher FF could be reached by switching from the inverted architecture to the regular architecture, where the single cells showed FF between 65% and 70% (Device F, G and H). As expected, the corresponding tandem devices (Tandem H and I) exhibited FF values between 66–68%, which are even slightly higher than the value of 65% typically used for PCE predictions. Overall, these material combinations showed tandem efficiencies in the range of 6–7%, again under processing conditions which are as close as possible to mass-production.
However, compared to the predicted theoretical PCE of 15%, there is a clear lack between the performance of Tandem I and the expectations. In the next section we will analyze the corresponding losses in more detail.
Firstly, efficiency contour plots were generated for the various materials and material combinations, using the approach demonstrated previously.20–22 Based on the experimental photovoltaic parameters that were extracted from Fig. 4a, the efficiency maps of the various organic tandem solar cells as a function of the active layer thicknesses are plotted in Fig. S1 and summarized in Table S1.† Table S1 is based on the experimental Voc values and FF of 65%.† More critical is the assumption of a thickness independent IQE, which is known to lead to an overestimation of the photocurrent. To have a clear comparison, the letters A–I that are shown in Fig. S1 represent the constructed tandem solar cells with corresponding active layer thicknesses.† Since the PCE predictions, as shown in Fig. S1, are mainly based on experimental data, the outcome of optical simulations is in excellent agreement with the experimental values.† The small difference in PCE between experimental and predicted values is mainly due to the relatively low FF for Tandem A–G and the assumption of thickness independent IQE for Tandem H and I. According to the optical simulation, the tandem solar cell (Tandem I) incorporating a bottom cell based on OPV12 (EG of 1.73 eV) and a top cell based on pDPP5T-2 (EG of 1.41 eV) is able to reach a PCE of ∼10%, which is among the highest PCE values for solution-processed tandem solar cells. Here, it is worthwhile to highlight that the 10% PCE can be met with already existing commercially available polymers. However, as predicted previously,6 the 15% theoretical PCE for tandem solar cells requires a bottom cell with a band-gap of 1.6 eV and a top cell with a band-gap of 1.3 eV. Cao et al.28 reported single-junction solar cells based on a commercially available donor material, PTB7 (EG of ∼1.65 eV), in combination with PCBM exhibiting a PCE of >9%. From both band-gap and photovoltaic property standpoints, using this polymer for a bottom cell, the PCE of tandem solar cells based on commercially available donor materials in combination with PCBM will exceed 10%.
What is required for 15% efficiency? According to Dennler et al.,6 the PCE of multi-junction OPV devices as a function of sub-cell's band-gap was simulated with the following assumptions: (1) 2. Voc tandem = Voc bottom + Voc top(2)3. FF of 65% and a constant EQE of 65%
The LUMO level of PCBM was determined to be of −3.7 eV, while the LUMO levels of both donors were kept at −4 eV to minimize the losses caused by exiton dissociation. However, most of the high performance donor materials reported until now have LUMO levels above −4 eV,29,30 leading to a reduced Voc as compared to the value estimated by eqn (1). Thus, the 15% theoretical PCE is difficult to reach for the multi-junction OPV devices based on the current donor materials mixed with PCBM. Although a lot of effort has been made to improve the Voc of OPV devices, the experimental Voc values obtained for the single-junction solar cells are typically too low to come close to the theoretical predictions. Recently, Yang et al. demonstrated a polymer tandem solar cell with a PCE of 10.6%.2 By replacing the PCBM with ICBA for the bottom cell, the Voc of the P3HT-based solar cell was improved to 0.84 V, thus the PCE of the tandem solar cell reached above 10%. This was a powerful demonstration that novel acceptors should play a tremendously important role in the performance enhancement.
Due to the lack of novel acceptors most of the high performance donor materials were designed in combination with PCBM. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to understand how good commercial donor materials could perform with an optimized acceptor. To further tap the potential of the commercially available donor materials, we adopted the optical simulation demonstrated by Dennler et al.,6 and correlated the experimental device performance with the PCE prediction. The PCE values of the corresponding devices as a function of bottom and top cells' band-gap are represented in Fig. 4b and Table 3 respectively. In the previous prediction,6 the difference in the LUMO level between the donor and the acceptor was fixed to 0.3 eV. Thus, the band-gap of the donor material was determined by its HOMO level and related to the Voc of solar cells, as estimated by eqn (1). The relationship between Voc and band-gap of the donor material can also be described as: (3)
Then, according to eqn (2) the Voc of a multi-junction device is recalculated as: (4)

Eqn (3) which is derived from eqn (1) is in good agreement with previous findings.31–33 It is important to note that the general loss of 0.6 eV in eqn (3) results on the one hand from the energy required for charge carrier dissociation and on the other hand from the voltage drop at the contacts. In eqn (4), both loss mechanisms, charge transfer state losses and contact losses, are involved in the loss of 1.2 eV to simplify the calculation for tandem solar cells. In addition, an idealized acceptor is required to fulfill the calculation, which will be discussed below.
A lot of efforts have been made in the past few years to understand the origin of the Voc of OPV devices and to analyze the minimum losses.5,31–44 The general assumption of 0.3 eV difference in LUMO levels between donor and PCBM (ΔELUMO) that derived from experience was used only for PCE predictions.5,6 Recent studies revealed that the energies of electronic states play a more important role than LUMO level offsets,31–33,35–39 since the LUMO level offsets always overestimate the energy required for charge separation and the offsets of >0.3 eV are not always required.40 However, in reality the donor–acceptor systems with low ΔELUMO values (0.2–0.3 eV) exhibit suppressed quantum efficiencies and fill factors, i.e. low PCE values.41 Nevertheless, considering the tradeoff between ΔELUMO and photocurrent generation the assumption of ΔELUMO of 0.3 eV as well as eqn (3) is reasonable at the moment for idealized efficient OPV devices.33,41–44 Therefore, in this work we adopted the assumption of ΔELUMO of 0.3 eV for idealized acceptors, which could be on the basis of fullerene derivatives, small molecules or polymers, to minimize the general loss to 1.2 eV for tandem solar cells, as shown in eqn (4).
Moreover, the efficiencies of OPV devices are strongly influenced by many other factors, such as morphology of donor–acceptor blends,26 charge photogeneration,38 transport,45etc. To simplify the analysis all these considerations are wrapped up in the assumptions of FF = 65% and EQE = 65% for the OPV devices and are not discussed in further detail in this work.
Obviously, the experimental Voc values obtained for Tandem A–I are much lower than the calculations following eqn (4), since the LUMO differences between these donor materials and PCBM are greater than 0.3 eV. By adjusting the LUMO level of the acceptor to fix this difference of 0.3 eV, eqn (3) and (4) become valid again for the assumption of an optimized acceptor. Thus, the Voc values of Tandem C–F based on the hypothetical acceptors are determined to be of ∼2–2.4 V, and as a result the PCE of these devices is improved to ∼9% when using experimentally measured Jsc and FF values for calculations. However, by assuming a FF of 65% as used for prediction, the PCE values for these tandem device combinations are further improved to >11%, which is in excellent agreement with the predicted values (see Table 3). As mentioned above, tandem solar cells with a regular device structure were constructed to achieve high FF as well as high PCE values. Assuming again an optimized acceptor, both Tandem H and I have the potential to reach a PCE of >14%.
3. Conclusion
In this work we systematically investigated single- and multi-junction OPV devices based on commercially available materials and demonstrated the performance potential of mass-produced OPV devices. Single-junction OPV devices based on GEN-2:[60]PCBM reached a PCE of ∼6.63%, while multi-junction OPV devices based on OPV12:[60]PCBM as the bottom cell and pDPP5T-2:[70]PCBM as the top cell reached a PCE of ∼6.65%. It is worth emphasizing that all the devices investigated in this work were fabricated via doctor-blading in air, which is highly compatible with roll-to-roll mass-production. The optical simulations were performed based on the experimental data to investigate the maximal PCE for tandem solar cells based on commercially available donor materials in combination with PCBM. A maximum PCE of ∼10% is predicted for a tandem solar cell incorporating an OPV12:[60]PCBM-based bottom cell and a pDPP5T-2:[70]PCBM-based top cell. Moreover, based on the optical simulation and experimental data, we were able to establish efficiency maps as a function of active layer thicknesses for tandem solar cells. This effort along with the demonstration of novel, roll-to-roll compatible intermediate layers underlines that 10% tandem cells are feasible on the basis of scalable, commercially available materials.
To further tap the potential of these commercially available materials, the experimental PCE values were correlated with their predicted values based on the band-gap of bottom and top cells. Although the PCE prediction for multi-junction OPV devices was proven to be practical, efficiency contour plots were based on the use of PCBM as an acceptor material. We now assumed a hypothetical, optimized acceptor to understand the limitation of the commercially available donor polymers. These hypothetical acceptors, whose LUMO levels are adjusted to the LUMO levels of donor materials to keep the 0.3 eV difference, resulted in predicted PCE values of >14% for commercially available donor materials, representing a bright future for mass-production compatible OPV devices. We believe that this study will tempt and motivate the materials research community to design unique acceptors, which are especially suitable for the commercially available high performance donor materials, for boosting the PCE of multi-junction OPV devices towards 15%.
4. Experimental section
All the materials investigated in this work were received from commercial providers listed in Table 1. Various PEDOT:PSS (HTLs) polymers were supplied by Heraeus. ZnO-nanoparticles (ETL) were synthesized at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and dissolved in acetone.8 All the devices with the structures illustrated in Fig. 1 were fabricated using doctor-blading under ambient conditions, demonstrating high compatibility with roll-to-roll mass-production. The fabrication of OPV devices incorporating different IMLs can be found in previous publications.20–22 100 nm thick Ag was thermally evaporated for inverted structure devices as the top electrode, while the regular structure devices with the top electrode consisted of 15 nm Ca and 85 nm Ag. Other processing parameters, such as the donor–acceptor ratio, solvent and layer thickness, etc., are summarized in Table 2. The area of OPV devices was defined by the top electrode, which was thermally evaporated through a mask with an opening of 10.4 mm2. The J–V characteristics were measured using a source measurement unit from BoTest. Illumination was provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 1A, from Newport) with AM1.5G spectra at 100 mW cm−2. The optical investigations of the thin films were carried out by using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (Lambda 950, from Perkin). The thicknesses of films were measured by using a profilometer (Tencor Alpha Step).

Broader context
Although lab-scale organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10–12%, the PCEs of large area mass-produced OPV devices, which are mainly based on P3HT:PCBM as the active layer at the moment, are in the 2–3% range. The tandem concept, in which two or more sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra are stacked on each other and connected in series or parallel, is one of the most successful approaches to significantly improve the PCE of OPV devices. The main losses in single-junction OPV devices, such as narrow absorption window and thermalization losses, can be simultaneously addressed by the tandem concept. However, the difficulties in processing tandem architectures as well as the lack of commercially available high performance materials do limit the research relevance in this otherwise exciting field. In this work, we investigate the potential of scalable, already commercially available materials based on experimental data, and analyze the losses in organic tandem solar cells according to optical simulations. The clear lack between achieved performance and expectations is discussed in detail.
