    , Accepted 7th March 2015First published on 9th March 2015AbstractNanostructured electrodes with vertical alignment have been considered ideal structures for electron transport and interfacial contact with redox electrolytes in photovoltaic devices. Here, we report large-scale vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays with uniform structures, without lateral cracks fabricated by a modified anodic oxidation process. In the modified process, ultrasonication is utilized to avoid formation of partial compact layers and lateral cracks in the SnO2 nanochannel arrays. Building on this breakthrough, we first demonstrate the photovoltaic application of these vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays. These vertically aligned arrays were directly and successfully applied in quasi-solid state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as photoanodes, yielding reasonable conversion efficiency under back-side illumination. In addition, a significantly short process time (330 s) for achieving the optimal thickness (7.0 μm) and direct utilization of the anodized electrodes enable a simple, rapid and low-cost fabrication process. Furthermore, a TiO2 shell layer was coated on the SnO2 nanochannel arrays by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process for enhancement of dye-loading and prolonging the electron lifetime in the DSSC. Owing to the presence of the ALD TiO2 layer, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency were increased by 20% and 19%, respectively, compared to those of the DSSC without the ALD TiO2 layer. This study provides valuable insight into the development of efficient SnO2-based photoanodes for photovoltaic application by a simple and rapid fabrication process.
Introduction
Nanostructured transition metal oxides prepared by electrochemical anodic oxidation have received significant attention for diverse applications in nanomaterial synthesis,1–3 photonic crystals,4,5 biosensors,6,7 and photovoltaics,8–20 owing to their unique properties stemming from their one-dimensional geometry and vertically aligned pore structures, as well as the advantages of the anodic oxidation process such as simplicity, reliability, and low cost for large-scale production. Firstly, anodic aluminum oxides (AAOs) prepared by anodic oxidation of Al have been studied over the last six decades, especially in the field of nanotechnology. In addition, since Macák et al. first used highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays, prepared by anodic oxidation of Ti as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),8 the optimization and application of these TiO2 nanotube or nanochannel arrays for photovoltaic devices have been intensively studied.9–17 Vertically oriented nanotube or nanochannel electrodes have been considered as ideal structures for electron transport in photovoltaic devices; indeed, it was shown that these one-dimensional structures exhibit a lower electron recombination rate and a stronger light scattering effect than the conventional randomly oriented structures based on spherical nanoparticles.10 Furthermore, vertically aligned pore structures are advantageous for the diffusion of redox couples and interfacial contacts with electrolytes or hole conductors in photovoltaic devices.12,14
Although, besides Al and Ti, anodic oxidation of other transition metals such as Nb,18,21 Zr,22,23 W,24,25 Ta,26 Hf,27 and Sn28–31 for the formation of vertically aligned nanotube or nanochannel metal oxide arrays has been reported, the studies and applications have been relatively insufficient for these metals compared to the cases of Al and Ti. In particular, vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays might be an attractive material for photovoltaic applications. Although the electron recombination rate in SnO2 is faster by two to three orders of magnitude32 and the conversion efficiency is poorer than those of the conventional TiO2 as a photoanode material in mesoscopic sensitized solar cells (dye- or quantum dot-sensitized solar cells), it has received much attention due to its potential properties such as faster electron transport rate and tolerance to UV illumination resulting from the larger band gap (3.6 eV, cf. TiO2 ∼3.2 eV).32–39 In addition, because the conduction band potential of SnO2 is 0.4 eV more positive than that of TiO2, electron injection becomes possible from dyes or inorganic sensitizers (quantum dots) that are energetically unfavorable with respect to TiO2.36–38
However, a direct application of anodic SnO2 nanochannel arrays maintaining vertically aligned structures as photoelectrodes in photovoltaic devices has not been reported yet. This is due to the difficulty of fabricating anodic SnO2 electrodes with uniform nanoporous structures over large areas without lateral cracks. Because the Sn anodic oxidation process is very fast in general,28 it is difficult to fabricate anodic SnO2 electrodes with nanoporous surface structures over large areas. In addition, due to the vigorous oxygen evolution during the Sn anodic oxidation process, many lateral cracks are generated, resulting in a discontinuous nanochannel structure composed of stacked layers several hundreds of nanometers thick.28–31 Although Hossain et al.40 and Teh et al.41 reported mesoscopic sensitized solar cells employing anodic nanoporous SnO2 as photoanode materials, they could not directly utilize anodic nanoporous SnO2 maintaining vertically aligned structures. Instead, these researchers peeled off the anodic nanoporous SnO2 from the Sn metal substrate, and then used the peeled material to prepare a paste for deposition onto the conductive substrate (FTO glass), resulting in a randomly oriented structure of the photoanode material.
In this study, we developed a modified process of Sn metal anodic oxidation for fabrication of large-scale SnO2 nanochannel arrays with uniform structures but without lateral cracks. The Sn anodic oxidation process was performed in an oxalic acid solution with the assistance of ultrasonication. Using ultrasonication, a uniform nanoporous structure was formed over large surface areas and lateral cracks were not generated, yielding vertically aligned continuous nanochannel arrays. These nanochannel arrays were directly used in quasi-solid state DSSCs as photoanodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first photovoltaic application of vertically aligned anodic SnO2 nanochannel arrays. The thickness of SnO2 nanochannel arrays was controlled by varying the anodic oxidation time. Photovoltaic performances were examined for SnO2 nanochannel arrays with different thicknesses. Owing to the significantly short anodic oxidation time (330 s) for achieving the optimal thickness (7.0 μm) for photovoltaic performance, and owing to the utilization of a gel-type electrolyte, the devices in this study were fabricated through a simple and rapid process. Furthermore, in order to enhance the photovoltaic performance, a TiO2 shell layer was deposited onto the SnO2 nanochannel by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The enhanced photovoltaic properties, in particular the prolonged electron lifetime resulting from the TiO2 shell addition, were characterized.
Experimental
Preparation of SnO2 and SnO2/TiO2 nanochannel arrays
Vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays were fabricated by using a modified anodic oxidation method. Tin foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.8% purity, 0.25 mm thick, 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm in size) was anodized in a 0.5 M oxalic acid aqueous solution.28 The anodic oxidation process was carried out under ultrasonication (60 W, 28 kHz, MUJIGAE SD-120H). Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode, and the distance between the tin foil and Pt mesh was 5 cm. A dc potential of 10 V was applied and the anodic oxidation time was varied from 90 to 390 s. The as-anodized SnO2 electrode was washed in distilled water under ultrasonication, followed by thermal annealing at 500 °C for 3 h in air. The TiO2 shell layer was grown on the surface of SnO2 nanochannel arrays at 150 °C by using a laminar flow type ALD reactor. One ALD cycle for TiO2 consists of four steps: TiCl4 exposure (1 s) – purging (5 s) – H2O exposure (1 s) – purging (20 s). The ALD cycle was repeated for growing the ultrathin TiO2 with thicknesses of 1, 2, 5, and 10 Å. For each TiO2 thickness, the ALD process was repeated for 3, 6, 15, and 30 cycles considering the growth-per-cycle of 0.34 Å per cycle measured on bare Si wafers. TiCl4 (UP Chemical Co., Ltd) and H2O were vaporized from external canisters at room temperature and led into the reactor through solenoid valves without any carrier gas. High-purity N2 gas (99.999%) was used as a purging gas with a flow rate of 400 sccm. All delivery lines were maintained at 120 °C. The base pressure of the reactor was below 10 mTorr and ALD was performed at a working pressure of 200–600 mTorr.
Characterization of materials
The morphology and the structure of the SnO2 nanochannel arrays were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL JEM-2010). The cross-sectional images of the SnO2 nanochannel arrays were obtained using an FE-SEM (Cal Zeiss AURIGA) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The chemical states were confirmed from elemental energy-filtered (EF)-TEM maps (JEOL JEM-2100F). The crystalline phase was confirmed using high power X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation. The surface compositions were characterized by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo SIGMA PROBE), using an Al Kα X-ray source in an UHV system with a chamber base pressure of ∼10−10 Torr.
Fabrication of solar cells
The prepared SnO2 nanochannel electrodes were dipped into a 5 × 10−4 M N-719 dye (Ru 535-bisTBA, Solaronix) solution in ethanol for 24 h at room temperature. The Pt-counter electrodes were prepared by spin-casting a drop of 10 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol onto F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass followed by heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min in air. A thermal adhesive film (Surlyn, thickness: 30 μm) was attached on the dye-adsorbed SnO2 electrodes. A commercial gel-type electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples (EL-SGE, Dyesol) was cast on the dye-adsorbed SnO2 electrodes, followed by covering with Pt-counter electrodes with the aid of clamps.
Characterization of solar cells
Standard photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a 500 W xenon lamp (XIL model 05A50KS source measure units and an AM 1.5G filter) at a power of 100 mW cm−2 and a potentiostat (Solartron 1480). The solar cells were covered with a black aperture mask before the measurements in order to avoid the additional illumination through the lateral space.42,43 The electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained in the dark with the bias potential of −0.5 V using a Zahner IM6. The magnitude of the sinusoidal perturbations was 10 mV, and the frequency ranged from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of annealed SnO2 nanochannel arrays prepared by the conventional anodic oxidation process (at 10 V for 330 s, without ultrasonication) according to a previous report.28 As shown in Fig. 1a, the Sn substrate surface was not uniformly anodized over large areas. Porous layers and relatively compact layers coexisted, and we found this trend to be consistent throughout the whole areas of the samples. A nanochannel structure with a pore size of 50–80 nm and a wall thickness of 20–30 nm was observed in the porous layers. However, the coexisting compact layers did not seem to be sufficiently porous to be utilized as photoanodes of mesoscopic sensitized solar cells.

On the other hand, the samples prepared by anodic oxidation with ultrasonication (at 10 V for 330 s) had uniform nanochannel structures over large areas, as shown in Fig. 2a. Compact layers were not observed throughout the whole areas of these samples. As shown in Fig. 2b, the pore size and wall thickness were identical to those of the samples prepared by using the conventional method. Fig. 1c shows the cross-sectional image of SnO2 nanochannel arrays, representing the vertically aligned pore structure and partially one-dimensional walled structure. Fig. 2d shows the current transient during the Sn anodic oxidation, exhibiting a profile similar to that of other valve metals. However, compared to the well-known anodic oxidation processes (such as anodic oxidation of Ti and Al), the time-scale was significantly short, implying the rapid reaction process. For example, the step for the initial formation of compact oxide layers (step (i) in Fig. 2d) generally takes about 5–10 minutes in the anodic oxidation process of Ti;44 however, in this work, the same step for Sn took only about only 2 s. This rapid anodic oxidation process accompanied by vigorous oxygen evolution28 led to nonhomogeneous distribution of chemical and field-assisted dissolution throughout the surface, resulting in the formation of a non-uniform pore structure when the conventional method was applied. However, by ultrasonication, ultrasonic waves assisted the oxygen gas to escape rapidly and smoothly, leading to homogeneous distribution of chemical and field-assisted dissolution of the formed SnO2 layers throughout the whole surface.45 As a result, a uniform pore structure was formed by ultrasonication as shown in Fig. 2a.

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the prepared SnO2 nanochannel arrays before and after annealing. The as-anodized sample exhibited nearly the same pattern as the Sn foil, indicating that the as-anodized sample has an amorphous phase. After annealing at 500 °C for 3 h in air, the sample was crystallized and it exhibited a pattern corresponding to the cassiterite SnO2 phase.46,47 The (101) peak corresponding to the Sn metal still remained, because the Sn foil was located beneath the SnO2 layer. The average crystallite size calculated by using the Scherrer equation48 was about 22.7 nm. Fig. 3b and c show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the annealed sample. The nanochannel structures were confirmed again as already observed in the FE-SEM images. Fig. 3b shows the top view of the SnO2 nanochannel with a pore size of 50–80 nm and a wall thickness of 20–30 nm, which accorded with the FE-SEM images. Fig. 3c shows the lateral view of the SnO2 nanochannel, exhibiting a one-dimensional walled structure. In addition, the crystal phase was cross-checked by using the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern as shown in Fig. 3d, which is consistent with the XRD pattern presented in Fig. 3a.

Since the thickness of the photoanode can greatly affect the photovoltaic performance of mesoscopic sensitized solar cells,49,50 we precisely measured the dependence of the SnO2 nanochannel array thickness on the anodic oxidation time by using the FE-SEM images obtained after focused ion beam (FIB) milling (Fig. 4). The SnO2 nanochannel array thicknesses were about 1.5, 2.3, 4.0, 6.0 and 7.0 μm for anodic oxidation times of 90, 150, 210, 270, 330 s, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the thickness increased linearly at the growth rate of about 1.47 μm min−1. However, anodic oxidation longer than 330 s resulted in poor adhesion between the Sn metal substrate and the grown SnO2 nanochannel arrays, leading to the partial peeling off. The thickness of the remaining SnO2 nanochannel arrays on the Sn metal is shown in Fig. 4f. The thickness of SnO2 nanochannel arrays was about 6.4 μm for an anodic oxidation time of 390 s, yielding thinner arrays than those for an anodic oxidation time of 330 s. As a result, the maximal thickness of SnO2 nanochannel arrays was 7.0 μm, obtained for 330 s long anodic oxidation. It is noteworthy that the obtained vertically aligned pore structure was continuous without lateral cracks through this long range. Using the conventional anodic oxidation process, many lateral cracks were generated resulting in a discontinuous nanochannel structure, as shown in Fig. S1,† which is consistent with previous reports.28–31 Crack creation was likely owing to the rapid anodic oxidation reaction and vigorous oxygen evolution, which created turbulence in the electrolyte and local stresses during the formation of SnO2 nanochannels.28 As already mentioned, ultrasonic waves assisted the oxygen gas to escape rapidly and smoothly, preventing the generation of lateral cracks as a consequence.

We utilized these SnO2 nanochannel arrays with large-scale uniform structures as photoanodes in DSSCs. The SnO2 nanochannel arrays were utilized directly, maintaining a vertically aligned structure as depicted in Fig. 6a. The whole size of the photoanode was 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm, and the active area was 0.25 cm2. Polymer gel electrolytes containing iodide redox couples (I−/I3−) and conventional Pt/FTO glass counter electrodes were utilized for the fabrication of the devices. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for different anodic oxidation times are shown in Fig. 6b. For statistical significance, the J–V data were obtained from three cells for each electrode (Table S1†), and the average values are listed in Table 1 with the adsorbed amount of dye. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) did not significantly vary among the samples; however, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) strongly depended on the nanochannel thickness. This was attributed to the increased amount of the adsorbed dye molecules with increasing thickness. As a result, the conversion efficiency was optimized to be 1.29% at the largest thickness. According to the literature, conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with conventional SnO2 nanoparticles were about 1.2–1.6% under one sun light intensity.34,35,51 In this study, a polymer gel electrolyte was used instead of the conventional liquid-type electrolyte. A gel electrolyte is superior in stability; however, it is inferior to a liquid electrolyte considering the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. In addition, owing to the opaque Sn metal substrate, the J–V data were obtained under back-side illumination. Compared with the results for under front-side illumination, the conversion efficiency of the DSSC is generally decreased by about 40% under back-side illumination owing to the light absorption by the Pt/FTO glass counter electrode and electrolyte.50 Considering these unfavorable conditions, the obtained conversion efficiency of 1.29% in this work is a promising result. This was attributed to the vertically aligned one-dimensional structure and to the uniform nanoporous surface structure of the SnO2 nanochannel electrode, which are favorable for light absorption, electron collection and interfacial contact with the viscous gel electrolyte.10,14

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the anodic oxidation time was significantly short (330 s) for achieving the optimal thickness for photovoltaic applications. Typically, for the preparation of TiO2 or SnO2 photoanodes in DSSCs, a viscous paste should be prepared via many complex steps including a sol–gel reaction, hydrothermal growth, and homogenization (mixing) processes. This process takes a long time, even up to several days. In this work, owing to the short anodic oxidation time and direct utilization of the anodized electrodes, the devices could be fabricated by a simple and rapid process. Even compared with the conventional anodic oxidation of Ti, the growth rate of the SnO2 nanochannel in this study was much faster. The growth rate in the conventional anodic oxidation of Ti for achieving similar pore structures was reported to be about 50–300 nm min−1,10–14,52,53 which is 5 to 30 times slower than that of the SnO2 nanochannel in this study (1.47 μm min−1). In addition, by employing a gel-type electrolyte instead of the conventional liquid electrolyte, the additional step of drilling and sealing small holes in the substrate for electrolyte injection could be omitted, allowing the whole process to be simpler and faster.
To further enhance the photovoltaic performance of the SnO2 nanochannel electrode, a TiO2 shell layer was deposited onto the surface of nanochannel arrays. In particular, poor dye-loading and short electron lifetime of the SnO2 electrode could be enhanced by using a TiO2 shell layer.34,35 For the TiO2 deposition, we did not use solution-based methods such as the well-known TiCl4 treatment;34,54 rather, we used the ALD process to avoid further annealing. Additional annealing could increase the thickness of a compact SnO2 barrier at the SnO2 nanochannel/Sn metal interface, resulting in the increased internal resistance.10,13 The TiO2 shell layer thickness was controlled by varying the number of ALD cycles (3, 6, 15, 30 cycles). Fig. 7a–c show the TEM images of the SnO2/TiO2 nanochannel electrode prepared by using 15 ALD cycles. These images demonstrate that the prepared SnO2 nanochannel is highly crystalline. In the high-resolution image (Fig. 7b), the (110) and (101) lattice planes (fringe spacing ∼0.34 and ∼0.27 nm, respectively) corresponding to the cassiterite SnO2 phase are discernible.55 In addition, the TiO2 shell layer deposited onto the surface of the SnO2 nanochannel is clearly seen. Furthermore, elemental energy-filtered (EF)-TEM maps (Fig. 7d–f) show that the TiO2 shell layer is homogeneously distributed on the SnO2 nanochannel surface. Fig. 8a–c show the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the bare SnO2 and SnO2/TiO2 nanochannel electrodes. The binding energies (BE) of Sn 3d5/2 and O 1s were not noticeably different for both samples. The BEs of Sn 3d5/2 and O 1s were 486.7 eV and 530.6 eV, respectively, which correspond to SnO2.56,57 In addition, the measured BEs of Ti 2p (458.9 eV and 464.8 eV for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively) indicate the presence of the TiO2 shell.58,59

The dependence of J–V characteristics on the number of ALD cycles is shown in Fig. 9a. The J–V data were obtained from three cells for each electrode (Table S2†), and the average values are listed in Table 2 with the adsorbed amount of dye. As anticipated, the adsorbed amount of dye was increased by the deposition of the TiO2 shell, owing to the higher isoelectric point for TiO2, compared with SnO2, in the dye solution.35 However, the SnO2/TiO2 electrode prepared in 30 ALD cycles exhibited a lower adsorbed amount of dye compared with the bare sample. The reason for the reduction in the adsorbed amount of dye is that byproducts (i.e. HCl) of the reaction for TiO2 ALD from TiCl4 and H2O were adsorbed on the interior surface of the porous nanochannel, occupying the adsorption sites for the dye-loading. In our previous study,60 we found that HCl molecules, produced as a byproduct during the TiO2 ALD process, could chemically adsorb on vacant sites prior to the adsorption of TiCl4. Furthermore, the occupancy of the adsorption sites by HCl molecules becomes much higher as the ALD cycle number increases. Therefore, it is believed that the reduction of the dye-loading in the 30 ALD-cycled electrodes can be attributed to the adsorption of byproducts, such as HCl, on the interior surface of the SnO2/TiO2 nanochannel, preventing the adsorption of the dye molecules.

As shown in Table 2, the Voc and FF did not significantly depend on the presence of the TiO2 shell layer. The trend of conversion efficiency was mainly affected by the Jsc. The electrodes prepared in 3 and 6 cycles exhibited a lower Jsc and lower conversion efficiency than the bare electrode. However, the Jsc and conversion efficiency were enhanced and optimized in the electrode prepared in 15 cycles, where the Jsc and conversion efficiency increased by 20% and 19%, respectively, compared with the bare electrode. Because only a sub-monolayer can be grown by one ALD cycle, several cycles are required for forming a full monolayer by ALD. Considering the density (3.5–3.9 g cm−3) of amorphous TiO2 and the growth-per-cycle (∼0.34 Å per cycle) in our ALD process,61 about 8 to 10 cycles are required for forming a full monolayer of TiO2. Therefore, 3 to 6 ALD cycles were not sufficient for forming a full monolayer of TiO2. Such a sub-monolayer might unfavorably affect the photovoltaic performance, decreasing the electron injection and collection efficiency.62 It is also believed that the thicker TiO2 shell layer (15 cycles) can act as an energy barrier layer to prevent electron recombination between the SnO2 electrode and the gel electrolyte,35 consequently leading to the enhanced Jsc and conversion efficiency. The electrode with 30 cycles exhibited substantially enhanced Voc compared with the bare electrode, implying that the coated layer efficiently reduced the electron recombination.35,63 However, the Jsc decreased owing to the reduced adsorbed amount of dye, resulting in a similar conversion efficiency to that of the bare electrode.
To confirm the contribution of the TiO2 shell layer to the electron recombination reduction, we performed the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. Fig. 9b shows Nyquist diagrams of DSSCs in the dark with the bias potential of −0.5 V. As shown in the inset, the equivalent circuit model comprises the series resistance (Rs), the impedance at the gel electrolyte/Pt counter electrode (RPt and CPE1), and the impedance at the gel electrolyte/SnO2 electrode (Rct and CPE2). The chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the SnO2 electrode can be obtained from CPE2. The impedance spectra were fitted by using the ZView software, and the obtained parameters are listed in Table 3. The interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) was greatly increased by adding a TiO2 shell layer, implying a significantly reduced electron recombination rate. The Cμ denotes the extent of electron accumulation in the photoanode, that is the SnO2 electrode.64 Under identical conditions (the same utilized electrolyte and the same bias potential), this value decreases as the conduction band potential of the photoanode exhibits a negative shift, because the bias potential denotes the energy difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the Fermi level of the photoanode.65 Because the isoelectric point of TiO2 is higher than that of SnO2, resulting in the establishment of a surface dipole directed toward the SnO2 core, the conduction band potential of the SnO2 electrode can exhibit a negative shift by the TiO2 shell deposition.66 Therefore, the decreased Cμ for the SnO2 nanochannel electrode with the TiO2 shell indicates the negative shift of the conduction band potential. The electron lifetime, τn, can be evaluated from the product of Rct and Cμ.67 As shown in Table 3, the τn of the SnO2 nanochannel electrode increased by 34% with the addition of the TiO2 shell layer, implying that the TiO2 shell layer contributed to more efficient electron collection in the photoanode.

It was reported that the conformal coating is not guaranteed only by using the typical ALD process, especially when the substrate has a nanoporous structure with high aspect ratio, such as nanotubular or nanochannel arrays.68 The ALD process used in this work has not yet been optimized to be suitable for the SnO2 nanochannel arrays. For the conformal coating of the shell layer onto the SnO2 nanochannel arrays, the exposure times of precursors and purging times in the ALD process should be elaborately adjusted.68,69 We expect that the conversion efficiency can be further enhanced by optimizing the ALD process for conformal coating of TiO2 shells. In addition, in this work, the DSSCs were illuminated from the back-side for the J–V characterization, due to the opaque Sn metal substrate. For higher conversion efficiency, it is desirable to prepare the SnO2 nanochannel arrays onto the transparent conducting glass substrate by depositing the Sn metal, followed by the anodic oxidation process.13 These approaches are promising for realizing highly efficient DSSCs based on SnO2 electrodes.
Conclusions
In summary, vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays with large-scale uniform structures without lateral cracks were prepared by using a modified anodic oxidation process of the Sn metal. These vertically aligned arrays were directly and successfully applied in quasi-solid state DSSCs as photoanodes, yielding reasonable conversion efficiency under back-side illumination. Given that the anodic oxidation time was greatly short (330 s) for achieving the optimal thickness (7.0 μm) for the photovoltaic performance, the preparation process proposed in this study is a rapid and cost-effective one. In addition, the TiO2 shell layer was coated by using the ALD process without further annealing. Owing to the enhanced dye-loading and increased electron lifetime with the TiO2 shell, the Jsc and conversion efficiency were increased by 20% and 19%, respectively. These results provide important insight into the development of efficient electrode structures based on SnO2 for photovoltaic applications by a simple, rapid, and low-cost fabrication process. Furthermore, we suggest that the large-scale vertically aligned SnO2 nanochannel arrays developed in this study can also be effectively applied in other electrochemical devices such as sensors, capacitors, and lithium ion batteries.
