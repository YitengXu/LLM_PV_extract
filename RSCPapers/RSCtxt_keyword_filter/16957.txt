Layered cobalt carbonate hydroxide (Co(CO3)0.5(OH)x·11H2O, LCCH) acicular nanorod arrays (ANRAs) are fabricated on a conducting plastic substrate by chemical bath deposition (CBD), followed by a simple ionic-exchange process to convert the LCCH ANRAs into Co9S8 ANTAs. The compositions of the films are verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping; their morphologies are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The films of Co9S8 ANTAs, obtained after various periods of the CBD, are analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and Tafel polarization curves, and the Co9S8 ANTAs obtained from 150 min of CBD show higher electrocatalytic ability towards the I−/I3− reaction than sputtered Pt. In addition, the long-term stability of the Co9S8 ANTAs film in I−/I3− electrolyte was tested by CV. The plastic based Co9S8 ANTAs electrodes are used as the counter electrodes (CEs) of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and a high power conversion efficiency of 5.47% is achieved, which is comparable to that of the DSSC using sputtered Pt (5.62%). Therefore, the Co9S8 ANTAs are proposed to be a reliable material to replace Pt as plastic based CEs of DSSCs.IntroductionThe preparation of highly electroactive thin film electrodes with ordered nanostructure is important in the fabrication of energy storage and conversion devices, such as fuel cells,1–4 lithium ion batteries,5–9 capacitors,10–13 solar cells,14–19 and so on. Nanostructured materials have received much attention for their peculiar and fascinating properties and superior performance compared to the corresponding bulk materials. Among various kinds of nanoscale morphologies of thin film nanomaterials, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured arrays of nanomaterials have attracted lots of interest because of their excellent technological advantages and better characteristics.20 1D nanostructured arrays exhibit high surface area, which is beneficial for interfacial charge collection/separation across the heterogeneous interfaces. In addition, 1D well-aligned nanostructures are beneficial for electronic conduction along the axial direction through the arrays to the substrate. Therefore, 1D nanostructured arrays can potentially be used as the electrodes for three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured versions of devices, such as solar cells,14,15 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),21,22 electrochromic devices,23 batteries,5,8,13 fuel cells1–3 and capacitors.10–13 In order to fabricate 1D nanostructured arrays of materials, a solid ordered template is usually used as a scaffold for depositing a nanostructured film with the target material, such as small molecules/polymers or a precursor, and then the template is removed to obtain a robust nanostructure of the target material. These scaffold materials have been accomplished using a variety of templates, such as polycarbonate membranes,24 nanochannel alumina, and anodized aluminum oxides (AAO).25–31 Among several template materials, AAO is the most commonly and successfully used for the synthesis of 1D nanostructured arrays. However, there are several inconveniences to using AAO as the template, including the difficulty in fabricating nanostructured arrays on a transparent conducting substrate, and the structural variations of the nanostructured arrays after removing the templates.32Cobalt sulfides are known to have a variety of chemical formulae, including Co9S8, CoS, Co3S4, Co4S3 and CoS2; these materials have attracted great attention due to their wide application in magnetic semiconductor materials,33 catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction,34 hydrosulfurization,35 lithium ion batteries,36 electrochemical capacitors37 and other fields. Among these cobalt sulfides, Co9S8 has received much attention due to its complicated structure, interesting properties and important applications.38 In recent years, Co9S8 has also been applied for the oxygen reduction reaction,34 hydrogenation,39 hydrodesulfurization35,40 and as the cathode of lithium batteries36,41 due to its excellent electrocatalytic ability.Cobalt sulfides with various morphologies have been synthesized to further enhance the electrocatalytic properties, including 3D nanospheres42,43 and 2D nanoflakes.44,45 However, research into the synthesis, electrocatalytic properties and applications of cobalt sulfides with 1D nanostructure is still insufficient due to the difficulty of growing 1D cobalt sulfides directly. A powder of polycrystalline Co9S8 nanotubes was synthesized by Wang et al. using Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanorod bunches as sacrificial hard templates through a hydrothermal route.38 Chen et al. synthesized a powder of 1D polycrystalline Co3S4 nanotubes constructed from nanoparticles by converting the powder of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanowires as sacrificial templates under hydrothermal conditions into Co3S4.46 A biomolecule-assisted hydrothermal process was developed by Bao et al. to synthesize CoS nanowires, in which L-Cysteine and some organic binders were used as the sulfide source and directing molecules.47 However, only powders of 1D nanostructures of cobalt sulfides have been prepared in the studies mentioned above, that is to say, they are not in the form of a thin film. It is still difficult to produce an ordered thin film of any kind of cobalt sulfide with nanostructured morphology on a conducting substrate without morphological damage, which is beneficial for further applications. Although CoS2 nanowire arrays have been synthesized by Yue et al., it was still necessary to use an AAO template in that work.48 CoS acicular nanorod arrays (ANRAs) were fabricated on a conducting glass substrate by using Co3O4 ANRAs as the sacrificial templates in our previous work.14 However, a high temperature (400 °C) pyrolysis process was still necessary for the fabrication of Co3O4 ANRAs on the conducting glass substrate. Thus, such a high temperature process cannot be used to fabricate CoS ANRAs on a flexible conducting plastic substrate.The Kirkendall effect is a classical phenomenon in metallurgy.49 The interface initially moves due to mutually different diffusion rates of two species at an elevated temperature, so that vacancy diffusion occurs to compensate for the non-equality of the material flow.50 Recently, the Kirkendall effect has been used as a new fabrication route to obtain powders of hollow nanoparticles and nanotubes of cobalt sulfides.38,46,51,52 However, to the best of our knowledge, use of the Kirkendall effect to prepare well-aligned hollow nanostructured arrays of cobalt sulfides in thin film form has not been reported.Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have in recent years attracted intensive interest from researchers to convert solar energy into electricity due to their simple preparation procedure and acceptable efficiency compared with conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices.53,54 Basically, a DSSC consists primarily of TiO2 with absorbed dye molecules as a working electrode, a redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE). The CE is usually composed of a catalytic thin film material on a conducting substrate to perform the reduction of triiodide (I3−) ions, which are produced from the oxidation of iodide (I−) ions in the electrolyte by the oxidized dye. Therefore, a CE with high electrochemical activity is essential for the high performance of a DSSC. Conventionally, platinum (Pt) is usually employed as the CE for DSSCs due to its superior reliability and electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox couple. However, Pt is very expensive and rare on earth. Fabrication of CEs using alternative cheaper materials is expected to replace the noble and expensive Pt, especially considering the need for large-scale production. A great deal of effort has been made to find several substitute materials, including carbon materials55–58 and conducting polymers59–61 as Pt-free CEs for DSSCs. In recent years, CoS has been proposed as a suitable alternative for the CE of DSSCs due to its excellent catalytic ability towards I3− and its low cost.14,62–64 The cell performance with CoS as the CE is comparable and reliable to that of the DSSC with a Pt CE, which endows CoS with the potential to replace Pt as the CE in a DSSC.In this study, novel 1D Co9S8 acicular nanotube arrays (ANTAs) were prepared by a two-step approach. Layered cobalt carbonate hydroxide (Co(CO3)0.5(OH)X·11H2O, LCCH) ANRAs were fabricated first on a conducting plastic substrate by chemical bath deposition (CBD), and then, with the help of the Kirkendall effect, they were converted to Co9S8 ANTAs directly by soaking the coated substrate in a Na2S aqueous solution at 90 °C for 3 h to perform an ionic-exchange process, as shown in Scheme 1. The novel 1D Co9S8 ANTAs were applied as the CE of DSSCs, and a high conversion efficiency of 5.47% was achieved under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is comparable to that of the DSSC using sputtered Pt as the CE (5.62%). Scheme 1  Co9S8 acicular nanotube arrays (ANTAs) are prepared from LCCH acicular nanorod arrays (ANRAs) by soaking in an Na2S solution (0.01 M) for 3 h with the help of the Kirkendall effect. ExperimentalChemicalsCobalt chloride 6-hydrate (98%) was obtained from Showa Chemicals Inc., Japan. Urea (99.0%) and LiClO4 (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium sulfide 9-hydrate (ACS reagent, 98%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous I2, methanol, ethanol, tert-butanol, N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB), LiI, tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), acetonitrile (ACN) and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) were obtained from Wako Chemical. Cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719) was the commercial product obtained from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland). Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) (15 Ω sq−1, thickness 200 μm; Peccell Technologies, Yokohama, Japan) was used as the conducting plastic substrate for both the TiO2 photoanodes and the Co9S8 ANTAs CEs. All chemicals mentioned above were used as received. Deionized water (DIW) was used throughout the work.Fabrication of the Co9S8 ANTAs CELCCH ANRAs were fabricated on the conductive plastic substrate by using CBD. In the CBD process, an ITO/PEN plastic substrate (with an exposed geometric area of 1.5 cm2) was suspended upside-down in a closed bottle with an aqueous solution containing 6.25 wt% urea and 0.15 M cobalt chloride, at 90 °C for various periods (60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min). After the CBD process, the obtained LCCH ANRAs film was converted to Co9S8 ANTAs by soaking it in a closed bottle containing 0.01 M Na2S aqueous solution at 90 °C for 3 h. After this ionic-exchange process, the obtained film was washed with DIW and dried at 60 °C, and then the Co9S8 ANTAs CE was obtained. A sputtered Pt CE, with a platinum thickness of 50 nm on an ITO/PEN plastic substrate, was also prepared for comparison.Fabrication of the DSSCA mesoporous TiO2 layer was subsequently coated onto the ITO/PEN substrate by the doctor-blade method, using a binder-free mesoscopic TiO2 paste (PECC-K01, Peccell Technologies, Yokohama, Japan) followed by heat-drying at 150 °C for 5 min. The total thickness of TiO2 was about 10 μm, and a 0.283 cm2 portion was selected from the composite film as the active area by removing the side portions by scraping. The preparation and materials for the binder-free mesoscopic TiO2 paste have been described previously.65 It is a mixture of two kinds of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles (average sizes, 60 nm and 250 nm, 80:20 wt%) and a TiO2 aqueous brookite sol homogeneously dispersed in a mixture of tert-butanol and water (v/v = 2:1). The N719 dye solutions were prepared at 0.3 mM in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (v/v = 1:1). The TiO2 films were sensitized by soaking in the corresponding dye solutions for 2 h at 40 °C. The TiO2 photoanode was coupled with one of the various CEs (with sputtered Pt, and with different samples of Co9S8 ANTAs fabricated with different periods of CBD: Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min, and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min) to fabricate the DSSCs; these two electrodes were separated by 25 μm thick Surlyn® (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) and sealed by heating. The effective electrode area was maintained at 0.238 cm2 with the use of a black mask. The composition of the electrolyte was 0.4 M LiI, 0.4 M TBAI, 0.04 M I2 and 0.3 M NMB in a mixture of ACN/MPN (v/v = 1:1), which was drawn into the gap between the two electrodes by capillary force. The injection hole of the electrolyte was made in the CE with a drill, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after electrolyte injection.InstrumentationCyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with a CHI 440 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA), using the conventional three-electrode system. One of the various CEs, a Pt sheet, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working electrode, CE, and reference electrode, respectively. A solution of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN was used as the electrolyte for all CV measurements. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by a computer-controlled digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under illumination by a Peccell Technologies PEC-L11 solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Yokohama, Japan). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a Peccell Technologies PEC-S20 action spectrum measurement setup. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 60 kHz to 1.0 Hz. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set at the VOC of the DSSCs and 10 mV between the ITO/PEN/TiO2/dye working electrode and the ITO/PEN/Pt or ITO/PEN/Co9S8 ANTAs CE, respectively, keeping the temperature at 25 °C. The spectra were analyzed uisng an equivalent circuit model.The morphologies of the LCCH ANRAs and the Co9S8 ANTAs were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Nova NanoSEM 230) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi H-7100, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Tecnai G2, 200 kV) was also employed to verify the crystalline compositions of the nanostructures of LCCH and Co9S8; Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used to estimate the values of lattice spacing from the HRTEM images. The compositions of LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X-Pert, The Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation. The surface compositions of all the films were also verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe system (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan), using a microfocused (100 μm, 25 W) Al X-ray beam with a photoelectron take off angle of 45°. The Ar+ ion source (FIG-5CE) was controlled by using a floating voltage of 0.2 kV. The Wien filtered C60+ ion source (IOG C60-10, Ionoptika, Chandler's Ford, UK) was operated at 10 mA and 10 kV. The binding energies obtained in the XPS analyses were corrected for specimen charging by referencing the C 1s peak to 285 eV.Results and discussionMorphologies of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs thin filmsSEM images of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs thin films are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. From Fig. 1(a), it can be seen that the LCCH film before conversion is composed of 1D ANRAs, with a relatively smooth surface of the nanorods. After 3 h of the ionic-exchange process, the 1D acicular morphology remains the same, but the surface of each nanorod becomes slightly rougher and thicker, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The insets of Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the large-scale SEM images of the corresponding ANRAs and ANTAs. It can be seen that the nanorods and nanotubes are arranged uniformly and cover the full surface of their substrates in a large scale, indicating that the ionic-exchange process does not damage the morphologies of the 1D nanorod arrays. Photos of the LCCH ANRAs (light pink) and Co9S8 ANTAs (black) thin films fabricated on the flexible ITO/PEN substrates are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. It can be seen that the adhesion between the substrate and the ANRAs film and between the substrate and the ANTAs film is strong, and both the electrodes remain undamaged after bending. Fig. 1  SEM images of (a) LCCH ANRAs and (b) Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min; photos of (c) LCCH ANRAs and (d) Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films. The cross-sectional SEM images of the LCCH ANRAs films with different film thicknesses from 3 to 8 μm are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The film thickness here is controlled by varying the length of time of CBD, and the length of the nanorods is increased with longer periods. From Fig. S1,† it can also be observed that for different periods of CBD, the acicular nanorods are arranged uniformly in an array form, and the adhesion between the ANRAs and the substrate is still intact. The cross-sectional SEM images of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min films are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The formation mechanism of the Co9S8 nanotubes can be explained by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. Fig. S2(a)† illustrates the evolution process from LCCH acicular nanorods to Co9S8 acicular nanotubes. Firstly, S2− ions react with the LCCH acicular nanorods (Fig. S2(b)†), which were dispersed in the Na2S solution, and then a thin layer of Co9S8 forms on the surfaces of the LCCH acicular nanorods to form a core–shell structure, as shown in Fig. S2(c).† The thin layers are actually composed of many Co9S8 nanocrystallites with a large number of grain boundaries, which allow the diffusion of materials through the Co9S8 layer and further reaction between S2− and the LCCH acicular nanorods.38 According to the Kirkendall effect, different diffusivities in a diffusion couple may lead to the formation of Kirkendall voids close to the interface. In our case, the solid LCCH acicular nanorods react with the Na2S solution. There exists the outward transport of cobalt ions and the inward transport of S2− ions through the formed Co9S8 shell. As proposed by Alivisatos et al.,51,52 the relatively large change in the concentration of the core material between the core and the solution provides a greater driving force for the outward diffusion of the core material. The unequal diffusion of reacting species produces voids close to the interface. As the reaction continues, the Co9S8 shell becomes thicker and the LCCH core vanishes gradually. Finally the voids connect to each other and form the tubular structure as shown in Fig. S2(d).† It can be observed that the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min film follows the Kirkendall effect in transforming nanorods into nanotubes, as seen in the large scale SEM image in Fig. 2(b). Additionally it can be seen from the small-scale SEM images in Fig. 2(c) and (d) that the rough hollow hexagonal Co9S8 nanotubes are well transformed from the smooth solid hexagonal LCCH nanorods. Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) and (c) LCCH ANRAs, and (b) and (d) Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show TEM images of the acicular nanorods and nanotubes scraped from the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films, respectively. From Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S2(b),† it can be seen that the LCCH before the ionic-exchange process shows acicular nanorods with a smooth surface. After the ionic-exchange process, hollow Co9S8 acicular nanotubes with a rough surface were formed, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S2(c).† Several studies reported a similar conversion strategy, but under more extreme conditions, to synthesize nanostructures of cobalt sulfides in powder form, and finally obtained the hollow nanostructures of cobalt sulfides.38,46 The hollow nanostructures can be attributed to the Kirkendall effect occurring under diffusion-controlled conditions. To best of our knowledge, no study has reported the use of the Kirkendall effect to obtain thin films of well-ordered 1D nanotube arrays of cobalt sulfide. Fig. 3  TEM images of the acicular nanorod and nanotube scraped from (a) LCCH ANRAs and (b) Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films; (c) HRTEM images and (d) electron diffraction pattern of a single nanotube scraped from the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin film. The Co9S8 acicular nanotubes were subjected to further investigation by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the HRTEM image indicates a lattice spacing of 5.7 Å; this can be ascribed to the (111) planar spacing of Co9S8 according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS, PDF no. 86-2273) database. The nanocrystalline nature of the crystallites is also revealed by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. Several obvious polycrystalline diffraction circles can be seen in the SAED pattern of the Co9S8 acicular nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 3(d); this pattern is in good agreement with that of Co9S8 (JCPDS, PDF no. 86-2273). A single nanorod of LCCH ANRAs and a single nanotube of Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min were further investigated by TEM along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and the results are shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† Fig. S3† shows that the solid nanorod of LCCH ANRAs consists of uniformly distributed Co and O without any S; Fig. S4† shows that the nanotube of Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min consists of Co and S only. It can be seen in Fig. S4† that the mapping points of Co and S are mainly distributed on the shell of the nanotube; this indicates that the nanotube is hollow, not solid. Furthermore, only the background points of oxygen can be seen in the mapping result of Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min (Fig. S4(c)†); this indicates that LCCH ANRAs was completely converted to Co9S8 ANTAs by the ionic-exchange process.Characterization of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs thin filmsFig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films. As revealed in Fig. 4, all the diffraction peaks of the LCCH ANRAs film before the ionic-exchange process can be indexed to LCCH, according to JCPDS (PDF no. 48-0083). However, the Co9S8 ANTAs film only shows the peaks of the ITO/PEN substrate; the diffraction peaks of LCCH cannot be observed due to the complete conversion of LCCH and the low crystallinity of the obtained Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin film. Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was applied to further verify the surface compositions of the LCCH ANRAs and the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films. The high-resolution XPS spectra of each film in the regions of Co 2p and S 2p are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Two binding energies are observed for Co at 786.0 and 781.1 eV in the XPS spectrum of the LCCH ANRAs film, as shown in Fig. 5(a). These binding energies are assigned to the Co–O bonds of LCCH.66 The peak at 786.0 eV corresponds to the bond between cobalt and water, and the peak at 781.1 eV corresponds to the bond between cobalt and the OH units. However, in the spectrum of the Co9S8 ANTAs film, only the peak at 778.4 eV can be observed. This corresponds to the Co 2p peak of Co9S8.38Fig. 5(b) shows the spectra in the region of S 2p. No peaks can be observed in the spectrum of the LCCH thin film. Peaks at 161.4 and 162.3 eV can be observed in the spectrum of the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin film, which can be assigned to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks of Co9S8, respectively.38 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of the LCCH ANRAs and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min thin films in the region of (a) Co 2p and (b) S 2p. Electrocatalytic ability of the Co9S8 ANTAs thin films towards the I−/I3− redox coupleElectrocatalytic abilities of the sputtered Pt and the Co9S8 ANTAs thin films obtained from various periods of the CBD process ranging from 60 to 180 min (Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min, and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min) were studied by CV measurements, which were done in an ACN solution of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. The CV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, and the obtained CV curves are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a) that the CV curve of the sputtered Pt CE shows two pairs of redox peaks. The redox peaks at the more negative potential correspond to the reaction in eqn (1), and the redox peaks at the more positive potential correspond to the reaction in eqn (2), I3− + 2e− ⇌ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ⇌ 2I3−(2) Fig. 6  CV curves for (a) the sputtered Pt and the Co9S8 ANTAs CEs prepared with different periods of CBD, and (b) the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE, obtained for 200 cycles. Data were collected in ACN solution containing 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. (c) Tafel polarization curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with the electrodes mentioned above, obtained in the same electrolyte used for DSSC measurements, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrocatalytic ability of a CE for I3− reduction in a DSSC can be expressed in terms of the cathodic peak current density (Ipc) at the more negative potential in the CV curve, corresponding to the reduction reaction shown in eqn (1). The Ipc in a CV curve represents the electrocatalytic ability of the electrode for the reduction of I3− ions in the corresponding DSSC. All the CV curves for the Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min CEs show two pairs of redox peaks, which reveals similar electrochemical behavior to that of the sputtered Pt CE. The Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min films gave higher values of peak current density than those of the sputtered Pt, for both the anodic and cathodic sides. This implies that the electrocatalytic ability of the Co9S8 film with optimal thickness towards the I−/I3− redox couple is better than that of the sputtered Pt film, agreeing with the observations from previous literature.14,62,64 It can be seen in Fig. 6(a) that the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE shows the highest value of peak current density, indicating that the highest active surface area can be achieved with the growth time of 150 min. Since the ratios of the anodic peak current density (Ipa) to the cathodic peak current density (Ipc) for all the CEs with Co9S8 ANTAs films are far from unity, this implies that the redox reaction of I−/I3− is quasireversible. Thus, the larger peak separation (ΔEp) can be explained by using a dimensionless parameter, ψ, which is commonly used for quasireversible redox reactions and is defined as follows,67 (3)where DO and DR are the diffusion coefficients of I3− and I−, respectively, k0 is the standard heterogeneous rate constant, α is the transfer coefficient, f is defined as F/RT, F is the Faraday constant, and ν is the scan rate. The value of ΔEp increases significantly with decreasing ψ or increasing resistance of the electrodes.67 The CV curve for the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min CE shows a smaller peak current density and a larger ΔEp compared to that of the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE. If the film resistances for all the samples of Co9S8 ANTAs are the same, the values of ψ for all Co9S8 CEs should be the same in principle. According to our experimental results, a larger peak separation was noticed for the sample prepared with 180 min of CBD. This implies that the resistance of the Co9S8 ANTAs film increases at 180 min, thus decreasing its electrocatalytic ability.The long-term stability of the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE was also tested against the I−/I3− electrolyte by subjecting the electrodes to 200 potential cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Such long-cycle CV measurements have been applied to study the long-term stability of various CEs, including metal sulfides14,68,69 and conducting polymers70–74 in I−/I3− medium. The electrolyte and the scan rate were the same as those reported in the literature. The value of Ipa decreases by about 11% while the Ipc decreases by about 23% after 200 cycles of potential scanning. Tafel polarization curves have been used to study the electrocatalytic ability of CEs in the literature.64,75 In order to further investigate the electrocatalytic abilities of the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE and sputtered Pt CE, we used the same electrolyte as that used in the DSSC. Tafel polarization curves of symmetrical cells were obtained. 25 μm-thick Surlyn® served as the spacer in the symmetrical cells, which was also the same as in the fabricated DSSCs. The Tafel polarization curves are shown in Fig. 6(c). The exchange current density (J0), which is directly related to the electrocatalytic ability of the CE, can be estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches in the corresponding Tafel curve.67 From Fig. 6(c), it can be seen that the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE shows a higher J0 than the sputtered Pt, which is in agreement with the result obtained from CV in Fig. 6(a), namely that the electrocatalytic ability of Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE is better than that of the sputtered Pt.Performance of DSSCs using various CEsJ–V curves of the DSSCs using the sputtered Pt, Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min, and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min films as their CEs were measured under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The obtained J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7(a); the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs, including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and cell efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1. For all DSSCs with the various Co9S8 ANTAs as their CEs, the DSSC using Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min shows the lowest JSC, FF, and η. The DSSC performance reaches the optimal value when the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min is used as the CE. Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 7(b) that Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min shows the highest IPCE; this is in agreement with the result obtained from CV (Fig. 6). The η of the DSSC with the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE is 5.47%, which is comparable to that of the DSSC with the sputtered Pt CE (5.62%). Both JSC and FF were found to decrease when Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min was used as the CE, leading to a lower η. This may be attributed to the increasing resistance of the thicker film in the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min CE. Since all the DSSCs using Co9S8 ANTAs as their CEs show smaller FF values as compared with the DSSC using the sputtered Pt CE, this may be attributed to the lower conductivity of Co9S8 compared with that of Pt.

Fig. S5(a) and (b)† show the thin film electrodes (with an active area of 4.0 cm2) and the complete devices containing Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min and sputtered Pt CEs, respectively. Both ends of the device were fixed on the glass stages by 3M Scotch® Magic™ tape, and the bending angle of the device was controlled by adjusting the glass stages as shown in Fig. S5(c).† We measured the J–V curves of the DSSCs under five different bending angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°), which are shown in Fig. S5(d) and Tables S1 and S2.† No apparent change in the J–V curve for sputtered Pt was observed, and the normalized conversion efficiency remained almost at 1 (Fig. S5(e)†), revealing that the electrochemical performance of the sputtered Pt was hardly affected by the bending angle. However, it shows a slight decay for the case of the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min CE, because the connection between the ANTAs might be damaged after bending, as shown in Fig. S5(e) in the ESI.†Fig. 8 shows the EIS spectra of the DSSCs with the sputtered Pt, Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min, and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min films as their CEs, obtained under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model. Each of the Nyquist plots consists of three semicircles, which represent from left to right the electrocatalytic resistance at the interface between the electrolyte and the CE (Rct1), the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2), and the Warburg diffusion resistance of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Zw). Since a very thin spacer (Surlyn®) of 25 μm was used in the DSSC, Zw is merged with Rct2. From Fig. 8, it can be seen that the values of Rct2 (at the working electrode) are nearly the same (around 23 Ω), and the main difference between the CEs is in the Rct1 part. The values of Rct1 for the DSSCs with the sputtered Pt, Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min, and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min CEs are 3.84, 9.35, 8.20, 6.88, 2.78 and 4.56 Ω, respectively. The trend in Rct1 agrees with that of the cell efficiency in Table 1, except for the DSSC with the sputtered Pt CE. To explain this observation, the effect of series resistance (RS) is considered. RS is associated with the series resistance of the electrical contacts in the DSSCs, and it can be determined from the Nyquist plot (Fig. 8) at the left-hand intercept of the first semicircle. The values of RS for the DSSCs with the sputtered Pt, Co9S8 ANTAs-60 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-90 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-120 min, Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min and Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min CEs are 7.20, 20.37, 14.95, 13.17, 9.55 and 11.53 Ω, respectively. The DSSC with the sputtered Pt CE shows the smallest RS and highest FF among all the CEs, due to the higher Pt conductivity compared with that of Co9S8. Even though the electrocatalytic ability of the sputtered Pt CE is not the best (the corresponding Rct1 is not the smallest), the DSSC using the sputtered Pt still gives the best cell efficiency because of the higher Pt conductivity. Fig. 8  EIS spectra of the DSSCs using sputtered Pt and Co9S8 ANTAs CEs prepared with different periods of CBD. ConclusionsNovel one-dimensional (1D) Co9S8 acicular nanotube arrays (ANTAs) were fabricated on a conducting flexible substrate by a two-step approach. Layered cobalt carbonate hydroxide (Co(CO3)0.5(OH)X·11H2O, LCCH) acicular nanorod arrays (ANRAs) were fabricated first on an ITO/PEN substrate by chemical bath deposition (CBD), and then they were converted to Co9S8 directly by soaking the coated substrate in a Na2S aqueous solution at 90 °C for 3 h. Various periods of the CBD process were used. After being verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, the LCCH ANRAs film was confirmed to be completely converted to polycrystalline Co9S8 ANTAs film after the ionic-exchange process. The LCCH ANRAs film before the ionic-exchange process shows solid acicular nanorods with smooth surfaces, but the Co9S8 ANTAs-180 min film shows hollow and porous nanotubes with rough surfaces after the ionic-exchange process. From the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min electrode shows higher electrocatalytic ability towards the I−/I3− reaction than that of the sputtered Pt electrode. The Co9S8 ANTAs electrodes were used as the counter electrodes (CE) in flexible DSSCs, and a high cell efficiency of 5.47% was achieved when the Co9S8 ANTAs-150 min electrode was used. The cell efficiency is comparable to that of the DSSC using the sputtered Pt as its CE (5.62%). These results indicate that Co9S8 ANTAs can be used as a reliable material to replace sputtered Pt for use as flexible CEs in DSSCs.AcknowledgementsH. W.
