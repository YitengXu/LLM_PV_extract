    , Accepted 14th March 2011First published on 20th April 2011AbstractA series of oriented rutile TiO2 nanorod-array films are in-situ grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates from a mixed acid solution containing titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP), hydrochloric acid (HCl), acetic acid (HOAc), and water (H2O) by means of hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C. The effect of HOAc in the titania growth solution on the structure and micro-morphology of TiO2 nanorod array films, as well as the photoelectric conversion properties in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been fully investigated. It is found that HOAc can facilitate the formation of uniform, dense, and vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods and hence improves the dye adsorption, electron diffusion coefficient, and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, typically in short-circuit photocurrent and power conversion efficiency. A power conversion efficiency of 4.03% has been achieved on a DSSC based on a 2.3 µm-long nanorod array film obtained from a mixed acid solution with the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.8:4:8:8 by volume.
1. Introduction
Among various oxide and nonoxide semiconductor materials, nanocrystalline titania has proven to be most successful due to its specific properties: photocatalytic activity,1–5 photovoltaic effect, medium dielectric permittivity,6 high chemical stability, and low toxicity.7 During the past two decades, nanorporous polycrystalline titania has been extensively used in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor solar cells (DSSCs), which have been demonstrated to be a promising alternative of silicon based solar cells due to their relatively high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency and low cost.8–10 To date, DSSCs employing porous titania nanoparticles have shown the highest power conversion efficiency value over 10%.11–19 However, it is reported that there are trap sites at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, and these trap sites block the electron transport in the TiO2 film.20–22 Furthermore, the countless contact among the TiO2 nanoparticles could also be recombination centers to capture the photoinduced electrons.23 Therefore, the electron transport rate of TiO2 has to be further enhanced from the practical use and commercial point of view.
To overcome the limitation of TiO2 nanoparticles, DSSCs based on TiO2 electrode with one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures including nanorod24–28 and nanowire29,30 have attracted much attention since oriented nanorod or nanowire arrays provide a direct path for electron diffusion, leading to increased electron diffusion rate and higher solar cell performance.31–33 Recently, Feng et al.34 reported a method to prepare single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates via a non-polar solvent/hydrophilic substrate interfacial reaction under mild hydrothermal conditions. Liu et al.35 developed a facial hydrothermal method to grow oriented single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod films on FTO substrates, and power conversion efficiency of 3% was achieved using a 4 µm-long TiO2 nanorod film as the photoanode in a DSSC. In both synthetic routes for such 1-D TiO2 nanorods, concentrated hydrochloric acid was used to avoid fast hydrolysis of the precursor by ensuring a low solution pH. Without a fairly strong acidic medium, precipitation was formed and generally no nanorods could be produced.35 However, we found that the TiO2 nanorods prepared from the single acid system tilted to some extent and thus the formed nanorods were not well aligned. Furthermore, concentrated hydrochloric acid would more or less destroy the conductive layer and thus poison the conductivity of the conductive substrates, which results in a decrease of the DSSC performance, typically in short-circuit photocurrent and power conversion efficiency. Therefore, oriented TiO2 nanorods grown from a relatively weaker acidic medium for high performance of DSSC are quite desirable.
In this study, TiO2 nanorod-array films on FTO substrates were prepared using a mixture of hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid to control the hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide and the oriented growth of TiO2 nanorods. Acetic acid was used to modify the titanium precursor by replacing the isopropoxyl with acetoxyl, and thus the hydrolysis rate of titanium precursor can be controlled by the ligand exchange. Herein, TiO2 nanorod array films were prepared from such a mixed acid solution, and more uniform, more aligned and denser TiO2 nanorods were obtained with the assistance of acetic acid. As compared to the TiO2 nanorods obtained from a single acid system, the nanorods prepared from a solution containing the mixed acids exhibited faster electron diffusion and higher dye loading, resulting in higher short-circuit photocurrent and power conversion efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and reagents
Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, and LiI, I2, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and acetonitrile (AN) were purchased from Acros. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), glacial acetic acid (HOAc), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. All the solvents and chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade. Conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, resistance 15Ω/square, transmittance 90%) was received from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan. The redox electrolyte in the DSSCs contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPImI, and 0.1 M TBP using dehydrated AN as solvent. The sensitizer used in this work was an organic dye (2-cyano-3-{5′-[1-cyano-2-(1,1,6,6-tetramethyl-10-oxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H,4H,10H-11-oxa-3a-aza-benzo[de]anthracen-9-yl)-vinyl]-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl}-acrylic acid, Figure S1) prepared according to the literature.36
2.2. Preparation of TiO2 arrays
The growth solutions were prepared by mixing TTIP, HCl, HOAc and H2O with different volume ratios. To investigate the effect of HOAc on the growth of nanorods, the volume ratios were set at 0.4:a:b:8 by varying the a:b ratio while keeping total volume of acids constant (i.e. 12). To investigate the effect of TTIP content on the nanorod growth, the volume ratios were set at c:4:8:8 by varying the content of TTIP. A piece of FTO substrate ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and deionized water, respectively, for 30 min was placed against the wall of a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave filled with 8 mL of the above growth solution at 150 °C for 5 h. After hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, and then the substrate was taken out to rinse with deionized water for several times and annealed at 450 °C for 1 h.
2.3. Characterization
The surface morphology of the films was observed on field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800). The crystal structure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) from 20° to 80° at a scanning speed of 8° min−1. X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The lattice structural information was examined with high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, Japan). The thickness of the as-grown films was measured using a step profiler (Dektak 150) and double-checked with SEM observations. The absorption spectra of dye-loaded films were recoded on a Shimadzu model 2550 UV–vis absorption spectrophotometer.
2.4. Fabrication of solar cells
As-prepared TiO2 arrays were sensitized by dipping in a 0.3 mM dye (Figure S1) solution in ethanol for 12 h to complete the dye adsorption. The DSSCs were fabricated by assembling the dye-sensitized array film as the working electrode and Pt-coated FTO as the counter electrode, separated with a hot-melt surlyn film (30 µm), and sealed under heat. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the space of inter-electrodes through the two holes pre-drilled on the back of the counter electrode. The two holes were then sealed using a surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
2.5. Evaluation of DSSCs
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by recording J–V curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193) equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 filter. The parameters such as short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) can be obtained from the J–V curve. The light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). A black mask with aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was used to avoid stray light during measurement. Incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with an Oriel-74125 system (Newport), and the intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640). The intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) analyses were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany) in combination with a green light emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and a control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were recorded at short-circuit with light intensity ranging from 0.5 to 45 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological characterization

Figure 1 shows the top and side views of FESEM images for TiO2 nanorods grown from different growth solutions with the volume ratios set at 0.4:a:b:8 by varying the a:b ratio while keeping a + b = 12. Without HOAc in the growth solution, the nanorods with average rod diameter of 15 nm and film thickness of 0.8 µm were grown; some nanorods lay flat on the FTO surface and some nanorods stood at different angles to the substrate surface normal. It is seen from the top and side views that nanorods grew sparsely on the FTO surface that was exposed clearly. By replacing part of HCl with HOAc, more nanorods were grown to 1.5 µm thick at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 10:2 and further to 2.2 µm thick at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 8:4. In this ratio range, nanorods tended to aggregate and thicker nanorods were formed with increasing the content of HOAc. In addition, the nanorods began to stand on the FTO surface with a certain slope. The nanorods eventually stood upright with increasing the HOAc content to the HCl:HOAc ratios of 6:6 and 4:8. At the HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8, the nanorods (17 nm in diameter) grew very uniformly on the entire FTO surface, as revealed from the FESEM top view (Figure 1), and aligned to be an array with growth direction perpendicular to the substrate surface, as revealed from the FESEM side view (Figure 1). Very thin nanorods (∼8 nm in diameter) were grown with further increasing the HOAc content to the HCl:HOAc ratio of 2:10, and no TiO2 film was formed on the substrate at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 0:12. To summarize, with increasing the HOAc content, more nanorods were grown, which got thicker and longer up to the HCl:HOAc ratio of 8:4 and then got thinner and shorter with further increasing the HOAc content. On the basis of the above observations, the growth solution with the HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8 was best for the deposition of oriented nanorod array on the FTO substrate.

The above films were further characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Figure 2 displays the XRD patterns of the above films annealed at 450 °C. Except the film obtained at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 12:0, the other films exhibit the diffraction peaks for (101) and (002) planes, which is consistent with the tetragonal rutile phase (SG, P42/mnm; JCPDS NO.21-1276, a = b = 0.4593 nm and c = 0.2959nm). This suggests that the TiO2 nanorods deposited on the FTO substrate are rutile TiO2, which is similar to the previous reports.34,35 By comparison, the XRD patterns for TiO2 obtained from various growth solutions are different in the relative intensities of the (101) and (002) peaks. The intensity of the (101) peak gets stronger with decreasing the HCl:HOAc ratio from 12:0 to 8:4 due to the growth of more nanorods but gets weaker with further decreasing the HCl:HOAc ratio from 8:4 to 4:8 due to the more oriented growth of the nanorods. On the other hand, the intensity of the (002) peak gets stronger with decreasing HCl:HOAc ratio up to 4:8 since the nanorods are grown more aligned. For the film obtained at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8, the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak is much stronger than that of the (101) peak, contrasting to the powder XRD profile where the former peak is much weaker than the latter. In addition, no other peaks such as (110), (111) and (211), which are normally present in polycrystalline TiO2, are observed in the nanorod array. These results strongly indicate that the nanorods are not only aligned but also single crystalline throughout their entire length. The as-grown TiO2 nanorods are oriented on the substrate surface along the [001] growth direction which is perpendicular to the substrate surface.

Figure 3 displays the HRTEM images of the nanorod obtained from HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8. Interplanar spacings, d110 = 3.3 ± 0.1 Å and d001 = 2.9 ± 0.1 Å, are obtained from the lattice fringe in the inset of Figure 3. This indicates the formation of rutile phase, in agreement with the XRD result. The clear lattice fringe of the single nanorod indicates that the nanorod is single crystalline along their entire length. The nanorods grow along the [001] direction with (001) plane parallel to the substrate surface and the side wall plane of (110) perpendicular to the substrate surface.

Anisotropic crystal growth is required for rod formation, which is usually realized when the surface free energies of the various crystallographic planes differ significantly. Upon mixing of TTIP and HOAc, the titanium precursor is modified by ligand replacement from isoproxyl to acetoxyl. The modified precursor has indeed a slower hydrolysis rate than TTIP.37 The acetoxyl ligand can protect the metal center and hinder the attack of water, allowing the most exposed isoproxyl group primarily hydrolyzed. Unidirectional growth of nanorods is thus promoted by HOAc modification of TTIP, depending on the HOAc content. The TTIP/HOAc precursor comprises a compact Ti–O–Ti linkage even before hydrolysis, and thus nucleation density increases with increasing the HOAc content, which is responsible for the formation of more nanorods at the presence of HOAc. The TTIP/HOAc precursor likely has anisotropic reactivity, and acetic acid acts as adsorbing-chelating ligand to inhibit the growth rate along some crystallographic direction.37 At low HOAc content with HCl:HOAc ratio lower than 8:4, the lateral direction was likely not protected well by HOAc, and thus thicker nanorods were formed. At medium HOAc content with HCl:HOAc ratio from 6:6 to 4:8, the lateral growth was well inhibited, and thus thinner nanorods were obtained. At high HOAc content with HCl:HOAc ratio from 2:10 to 0:12, both the lateral and the vertical growth was likely inhibited, and thus vey thin or no nanorods were obtained. Experimental results indicate that HOAc has a significant effect on the growth of nanorods.
3.2. Solar cell performance

3.2.1. Effect of HOAc. 
The DSSC devices assembled using the above films were tested under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The average photovoltaic data were summarized in Table 1. With increasing the content of HOAc in the growth solution up to the HCl:HOAc ratio of 8:4, the film thickness increased from 0.8 to 2.2 µm. Therefore, dye adsorption was enhanced significantly, resulting in increased Jsc. Further increasing the HOAc content up to the HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8, although the film thickness decreased to 1.6 µm, Jsc increased significantly because the nanorods got thinner, denser and more aligned, which yielded more dye loading and faster electron diffusion. However, the Jsc decreased sharply at the HCl:HOAc ratio of 2:10 due to the dramatic decrease in film thickness. The power conversion efficiency changed with the same tendency of Jsc. Among the above-mentioned nanorods, those grown from the solution with the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:8:8 produced the highest short-circuit photocurrent and power conversion efficiency.

3.2.2. Effect of TTIP concentration. 
To improve the efficiency, it is necessary to increase the length of nanorods at the best volume ratio (TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O = 0.4:4:8:8). We tried to prolong the hydrothermal reaction time to grow the nanorod taller, but it was not successful. Taller growth of nanorods could be achieved by increasing the TTIP content while keeping the volume of the other three components constant (TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O = c:4:8:8). When the TTIP volume varied from 0.2 to 1.0, the growth of nanorods remained high orientation as shown in the SEM images (Figure S2).† The increase in the volume of TTIP from 0.2 to 1.0 made the nanorod grow taller from 1.0 to 2.4 µm, but hardly affected the rod diameter (Figure S2).† The measured diameter and length of the nanorods are listed in Table 2, in which the average photovoltaic performance parameters of the DSSCs based on these nanorod arrays are also listed. The general trend was that Jsc increased dramatically with increasing the volume of TTIP from 0.2 to 0.8 and then decreased a little with further increasing the volume of TTIP. The power conversion efficiency followed a similar trend of Jsc. Figure 4 displays the J–V curves of the DSSCs assembled respectively from Film 1 (TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O = 0.4:4:8:8), Film 2 (TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O = 0.8:4:8:8) and Film 3 (TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O = 0.4:4:0:16). To emphasize the influence of TTIP content on the solar cell performance, the J–V curves for the DSSCs based on Film 1 and Film 2 are compared. The DSSC based on Film 1 produced η of 2.16% (Jsc = 4.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.66 V, FF = 0.72), while the DSSC based on Film 2 produced η of 3.41% (Jsc = 7.08 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V, FF = 0.74). Doubling the volume of TTIP from 0.4 to 0.8 resulted in a big enhancement of Jsc by 56%. As a result, power conversion efficiency was improved from 2.16% for Film 1 to 3.41% for Film 2 by 58%.

J–V curves of the DSSCs assembled respectively from Films 1–3 under simulated AM 1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2). Film 1 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:8:8; Film 2 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.8:4:8:8; Film 3 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:0:16. 
As the nanorods got longer with increasing the TTIP content, dye adsorption would be augmented, and thus IPCE would be improved. Figure 5 compares the IPCE spectra for the DSSCs based on Films 1 and 2, respectively. With the increase in the length of nanorods from 1.6 to 2.3 µm, the IPCE was improved significantly in the spectral range of 400–750 nm, and the maximum IPCE increased from 37.1% to 50.5% by 36%. Evidently, the improved IPCE is responsible for the enhanced Jsc with increasing length of nanorods.
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectra of the DSSCs assembled respectively from Films 1–3. Film 1 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:8:8; Film 2 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.8:4:8:8; Film 3 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:0:16. 
To suppress the charge recombination, Film 2 was grown on the TiCl4 treated10 FTO substrate, and the power conversion efficiency was further improved to 4.03% (Jsc = 9.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, FF = 0.73). It is interesting to compare the solar cell performance of DSSCs with nanorod array and that with nanoparticulate film. Using the same dye and redox electrolyte, a DSSC made of a film (2.5 µm) comprising 20 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles38 produced 3.37% of η (Jsc = 7.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, FF = 0.77). It is obvious that the rutile nanorod array film is superior to the nanoparticulate film even made of anatase particles in the generation of Jsc and η. If the comparison was made between rutile nanorod array and rutile nanoparticles, the difference of soalr cell performance should be more ramarkable, becausae anatase is better than rutiel for efficient DSSCs.39


3.2.3. Comparison of nanorod arrays grown from a single or mixed acid system. 
For comparison, we prepared a nanorod array film (Film 3) from a single acid system with the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:0:16 based on the literature method.35Films 1 and 3 exhibit similar diameter (17 nm for Film 1 and 19 nm for Film 3) and length (1.6 µm for Film 1 and 1.8 µm for Film 3) as characterized with FESEM (Figure S3) and possess the rutile phase as revealed from the XRD patterns (Figure S4).† The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs based on Films 1 and 3, respectively, with the same dye (Figure S1) and redox electrolyte are also compared in Figure 4.†Film 3 produced η of 0.81% (Jsc = 1.90 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.64 V, FF = 0.67), while Film 1 produced η of 2.16% (Jsc = 4.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.66 V, FF = 0.72). The nanorod array grown from a mixed acid (HCl and HOAc) system is much better than that grown from a single acid (HCl) system in terms of Jsc and η.

Figure 5 also compares the IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on Films 1 and 3 respectively. The IPCE value at 500 nm increased from 11.1% to 37.1% by 3.34-fold when the growth solution changed from the single acid system to the mixed acid one. The big difference of IPCE accounts for the big difference of Jsc between Films 1 and 3. Next let us discuss the reasons why the DSSCs based on the two films produced different IPCE values. IPCE can be expressed as the product of light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency and charge collection efficiency. The absorbance at 500 nm of the dye-loaded film was 0.227 and 0.105 for Film 1 and 3, respectively (Figure S5).† Supposing that the absorbance was doubled with the light reflectance by Pt mirror in the DSSC, LHE (= 1 − 10−2A, where A is the absorbance) at 500 nm was estimated to be 64.8% and 38.3% for Films 1 and 3, respectively. The LHE(1)/LHE(3) ratio of 1.69 is much smaller than the IPCE(1)/IPCE(3) ratio of 3.34. This indicates that the difference of IPCE is not only due to the difference of LHE but also due to the change of the other two factors. Considering that electron injection efficiency should be same for the TiO2 based DSSCs with the same organic dye and electrolyte, the significant improvement of IPCE from Film 3 to 1 is also attributed to the improved charge collection efficiency, which is related to electron diffusion rate.

Figure 6 shows electron diffusion coefficient (D) at different short-circuit photocurrents for the DSSCs assembled from Film 1 and 3, respectively. The electron diffusion coefficient is defined as D = d2/τD, where d is the thickness of the TiO2 array films and τD is the electron transit time extracted from IMPS with the expression τD = 1/(2πfmin).40 As shown in Figure 6, the electron diffusion coefficient increases with the short-circuit photocurrent following a power law relation. At the same photocurrent, the electron diffusion coefficient of Film 1 is much larger than that of Film 3 by about 6-fold. This indicates that the nanorods grown from the mixed acid (HCl and HOAc) system have much fewer recombination sites than those grown from the single acid (HCl) system. By comparison of the FESEM images for Films 1 and 3, it is seen from Figure 1 and Figure S3 that nanorods in Film 1 are more aligned than in Film 3.† It is thus reasonable that electron diffusion in Film 1 is much faster than in Film 3. Because of the faster electron diffusion, charge collection efficiency should be higher in Film 1 than in Film 3. The higher charge collection efficiency in combination with the higher LHE in Film 1 brings about much higher IPCE and Jsc as compared to Film 3.
 Fig. 6  Electron diffusion coefficient (D) as a function of Jsc for the DSSCs assembled from TiO2 array Films 1 and 3, respectively. Film 1 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:8:8; Film 3 obtained from the TTIP:HCl:HOAc:H2O ratio of 0.4:4:0:16. 

4. Conclusions
In summary, the oriented rutile TiO2 nanorod-array films are successfully prepared on FTO substrates through hydrothermal reaction using the growth solution consisting of TTIP, HCl, HOAc and deionized water with different volume ratio. It is found that the mixed acid with HCl:HOAc ratio of 4:8 facilitates the growth of oriented, uniform, and thin rutile nanorods. The nanorods obtained from the mixed acid system have higher surface area for higher dye adsorption and faster electron diffusion for higher charge collection efficiency. Both of the two effects are favorable for higer IPCE and Jsc. The nanorods grown from the mixed acid system are superior to those grown from the single acid system in solar cell performance, typically in Jsc. Even with a 2.3 µm-long nanorod array film, a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of 4.03% has been achieved, which is more efficient than a DSSC based on a 2.5 µm thick nanoparticulate film. We believe that the efficiency will be improved significantly if one can succeed to fabricate a thicker array film than 10 µm. Development of longer TiO2 nanorods for high efficiency is under way. These findings provide a new route to preparing oriented nanorods with highly ordered alignment for efficient DSSCs.
