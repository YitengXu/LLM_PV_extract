    , Accepted 10th January 2023First published on 11th January 2023AbstractQuasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) semiconductor antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) shows great potential in the photovoltaic field, but the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2Se3-based solar cells has shown no obvious breakthrough during the past several years, of which the intrinsic reasons are pending experimentally. Here, we prepare high-quality Q1D Sb2Se3 thin films via the vapor transport deposition technique. By investigating the bandedge electronic level structure and carrier relaxation/recombination dynamics, we find that (i) the optimized Se-rich growth conditions can highly improve the crystal quality of the Q1D Sb2Se3 thin films, the carrier lifetime of which is substantially increased up to ∼8.3 μs; (ii) the Se-rich growth conditions have advantages to annihilate the deep selenium vacancies VSei (i = 1 and 3 for non-equivalent Se atomic sites) but is not effective for the deep donor VSe2, which locates at ∼0.3 eV (300 K) below the conduction band and intrinsically limits the PCE value of devices below ∼7.63%. This work suggests that further optimizing the Se-rich conditions to technically eliminate this kind of deep defect is still essential for preparing high-performance Sb2Se3 film solar cells.
Introduction
As a new type of light-absorption semiconductor with the advantages of low toxicity, Earth abundance and being inexpensive, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has received extensive attention in photovoltaic and thermoelectric fields. Due to its suitable bandgap (∼1.03 eV indirect and 1.17 eV direct) and high optical absorption coefficient (≥105 cm−1), Sb2Se3 is a promising light-harvesting material.1–3 Many techniques have been widely employed to grow Sb2Se3 as a solar cell absorption layer, including thermal evaporation,4–6 vapor transport deposition (VTD),3,7–9 closed-space sublimation (CSS),10–12 hydrothermal approach,13–16 and magnetron sputtering,17–21 among which VTD has been considered as the optimal one for preparing the quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) absorption layer of Sb2Se3. To date, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of superstrate-planar Sb2Se3 solar cells based on VTD is still ∼7.6%, almost without any further enhancement in the four years following.3 It is much lower than the theoretical PCE of ∼31% according to the Shockley–Queisser limit,22–24 even if the core–shell structured Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays have just reached ∼9.2% recently.25 One of the essential reasons is the existence of too many harmful and complicated defects in the Sb2Se3 absorption layer,26 especially the deep defects that act as non-radiative recombination centers to reduce the possibility of the separation and transport of photogenerated non-equilibrium carriers, resulting in serious losses of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current and subsequently the much lower PCE value.
Compared with multi-component compounds such as Cu2ZnSnS4,27 Sb2Se3 is a binary compound with only two elements. According to the stoichiometric ratio of atoms, only six defect states including vacancy (VSb, VSe), interstitial (Sbi, Sei) and antisite (SeSb, SbSe) in Sb2Se3 can be expected, and VSe and SbSe are generally deep donors with similar ionization energies and have a critical impact on carrier recombination, while SeSb as a shallow acceptor has little effect.28 Thereafter, it is theoretically easy to control the relatively simple defect states in Sb2Se3. However, first-principles calculations showed that the point defects in Sb2Se3 are unexpectedly complex.29 In high contrast to the conventional thin-film solar cell materials (such as diamond-like CdTe and perovskite CH3NH3PbI3), Sb2Se3 has a unique Q1D structure, i.e., (Sb4Se6)n atomic chains (bands) binding with each other by weak van der Waals forces, which not only leads to the poor carrier mobility between different atomic chains, but also results in complicated and unconventional intrinsic defects in Sb2Se3. Because of the low symmetry of the Q1D structure, the same defect forms but with non-equivalent atomic sites (e.g., VSei with i = 1, 2 and 3 for different Se sites) with different optical/electrical properties. Although it was believed that the Se-rich growth conditions can effectively optimize the Se-related defects, experimentally these defect states in Sb2Se3 were observed to decrease first but then increase with the addition of Se powder due to the non-equivalent atomic sites.10,28,29 Recent studies have shown that the formation energies of VSe, VSb, SeSb and SbSe are distinct at different sites and the corresponding energy levels (or activation energies) in the optical bandgap (Eg) are distributed,29 which makes the defect states in Sb2Se3 complicated and difficult to control. Therefore, in order to intrinsically improve the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells, a clear understanding of the defect states in Sb2Se3, in particular the origination of deep defects, is important and urgent.
In this work, we optimized the preparation process of the Sb2Se3 absorption layer in the VTD technique. The film structure, quality, bandedge electronic level structure, and carrier transport (including relaxation or recombination) dynamics have been investigated by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman, optical transmission, spectrally resolved photocurrent (PC), steady-state (SS) and time-resolved (TR) photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy methods. We found that the Sb2Se3 absorption layer was grown in a relatively high quality with the Q1D structure. However, the deep defects related to VSe2 located at ∼0.3 eV below the conduction band still exist in a high concentration, which intrinsically limits the conversion efficiency of Sb2Se3 devices below ∼7.63%. This investigation also suggests that effectively eliminating these deep donors becomes a practical issue for enhancing the PCE of Sb2Se3-based film solar cells.
Experimental
The Sb2Se3 thin films were prepared using the VTD process, as shown in Fig. 1a. 0.25 g Sb2Se3 powder was placed in two crucibles. The ITO/CdS substrate was placed at one end of the furnace. The distance between the source and the substrate can be optimized (e.g., ∼11 cm) for the Se-rich circumstance around the substrate.3,30 Under the air pressure of ∼1.5 Pa, the furnace was heated to 520 °C from ambient temperature by a rate of 20 °C min−1, and then maintained for different durations (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 min) to obtain different Se-rich conditions. For comparison, the procedure of adding Se powder to an additional crucible was also implemented, as described in our previous work.30 Subsequently, the furnace cover was opened and the as-deposited samples were cooled down to room temperature naturally. Ammonium sulfide solution (0.3 mmol L−1) was used to etch the Se residue on the Sb2Se3 films followed by deionized water cleaning. Fig. 1b schematically shows the Sb2Se3 solar cell structure, i.e., ITO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au with the Au electrodes (∼100 nm) deposited by thermal evaporation (5 × 10−5 Pa). Note that before the film deposition, the ITO (In2O3: Sn) transparent conductive glass (Kaivo) was dealt with the following sequence: cleaned with detergent, sonicated with acetone, alcohol and deionized water for 30 min each, dried under nitrogen, and then placed in a drying box. CdS was prepared on the ITO substrate using the chemical water bath method with a thickness of ∼70 nm. The CdS buffer layer was treated with a 20 mg mL−1 CdCl2 methanol solution (Aladdin), which was evenly dropped at a speed of 3000 rpm and spin-coated for 30 s.31

Grazing-incidence XRD measurements (Bruker D8 Discover) were conducted with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 mA and 40 kV at an incidence angle of 3°. Raman measurements (LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer) were carried out with a laser source of 532 nm. SEM (Gemini 450, Zeiss, Germany) was performed to examine the film morphology. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Vertex 80v, Bruker) was employed for obtaining the transmission, PC, and SS-PL spectra (at different excitation wavelengths including 405 nm and 514.5 nm). TR-PL at low power densities was carried out to determine the non-equilibrium carrier lifetime τ0. This was implemented by mW-excitation with a 532 nm ns-pulsed laser as the excitation source and a fast InGaAs photodiode. For TR-PL at high power densities, an 80 MHz repetition rate was implemented using a Tsunami Ti:sapphire laser (λ = 780 nm or 390 nm using second harmonic generation, spot size ∼100 μm) with an 80 fs pulse width. The maximum energy density per pulse amounted to 57 and 3.4 μJ cm−2 at 780 and 390 nm, respectively. Detection was made using a Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera with an S1 photocathode operated in synchro-scan mode. The overall temporal resolution of the setup (1/e decay of an 80 fs-pulse) was better than 10 ps. During all optical measurements, the samples were mounted on the cold head of a helium closed cycle cooler which allowed for the adjustment of temperature from 5 K to 300 K.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of the four involved Sb2Se3 thin films, between which the difference is the annealing duration of 1–4 min, marked as S1, S2, S3 and S4. Three Raman peaks at ∼188 cm−1, 210 cm−1 and 253 cm−1 can be observed, of which the two modes at 188 cm−1 and 210 cm−1 are related to the Sb–Se vibration modes, and the third one (253 cm−1) is due to the Se–Se stretching vibration mode.32,33 Note that the peak at 253 cm−1 is obvious for S1, S2 and S3, but unobservable for S4. This can be understood from the decomposition of Sb2Se3 during thermal evaporation and the following condensation of the Se component on the surface during the cooling process, which results in the peak at 253 cm−1. Similar results are also observed in the Sb2Se3 films grown under the Se-rich condition by adding Se powder. In this case, we use ammonium sulfide solution to etch the Sb2Se3 films, in order to eliminate the influence of Se on the surface of Sb2Se3. As shown in Fig. 2b, indeed the peak at 253 cm−1 disappears after etching. Meanwhile, the peak at 210 cm−1 shows almost no change, suggesting that different growth times have little effect on the composition and structure of the Sb2Se3 film. The crystallinity and preferred orientation of the Sb2Se3 films are further characterized by XRD (see Fig. 2c, pointing to the orthorhombic crystal structure [JCPDS15-0861]). As the holding time increases from 1 min to 3 min, the (211) and (221) reflection peaks gradually increase, but decrease when the holding time is 4 min. Since the stronger the (221) peak intensity, the better the quality of the Sb2Se3 films and correspondingly the higher efficiency of the Sb2Se3-based solar cell,34 it can then be inferred from the subfigure that the film with a growth time of 3 min has the best growth orientation. Notice that there are also similar research studies on the growth technique;28,31,35 however, this work has some advantages including that (i) the film prepared by the VTD method has better quality and higher efficiency and (ii) more attention is paid to the complex defect states caused by the non-equivalent sites in Q1D Sb2Se3, as shown and discussed in the following.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the thin films at different growth times. It is obvious that the grain size of Sb2Se3 gradually increases, and the surface pores decrease first but increase when the growth time is 4 min, which suggests the deterioration of the film quality. Focusing on the corresponding cross-section morphology, we can see that the grain growth of Sb2Se3 gradually changes from oblique to columnar perpendicular to the cross-section, and the film thickness gradually increases as a function of the growth time. The crystallinity of the films is obviously enhanced according to the cross-section results. However, the films will become thicker and the surface pores will increase to deteriorate the crystallinity, when a too long holding time is adopted, in line with the reduction of the (211) and (221) reflection peaks in the XRD pattern of S4.

Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curve of four Sb2Se3 solar cell structures. For S1–S3, the device efficiency shows a relatively high record and gradually increases from ∼6.65% to 7.63%, and the highest one with ∼7.63% shows the key diode parameters VOC = 386 mV, JSC = 35.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 56.1%. The improvement in efficiency is mainly due to the increase of JSC from 31.9 mA cm−2 to 35.2 mA cm−2, together with the slight enhancements of both VOC and FF. However, as the holding time increases to 4 min, the efficiency decreases substantially, mainly because the JSC decreases (down to 28.4 mA cm−2). Detailed parameters of all diodes are listed in Table 1. This is well consistent with the above analysis from the structure and morphology characterization, and simultaneously it indicates the consumption of photogenerated non-equilibrium carriers via non-radiation recombination centers probably related to the previously mentioned vacancy-related defects on the surface.

Based on these discussions, it can be speculated that the Sb2Se3 solar cells face a bottleneck of PCE with the highest value of ∼7.63%, since it is still only a slight breakthrough as compared to earlier reports during the past several years,3 even though here the Sb2Se3 absorption layer has been grown in a Q1D structure with a relatively high quality, and also the Se-rich conditions have been tuned along with the optimization of the buffer layer or interfacial states. Thus, to disclose the intrinsic influence factors including the effect of Se-rich conditions on the PCE, systematic optical characterization methods are performed on the Sb2Se3 films or the corresponding cell structures. Fig. 5 shows the transmission spectra of all films from ∼900 nm to 1800 nm. According to the relationship between the absorption coefficient α and the transmissivity T, α = (1/d) ln (1/T), where d is the film thickness (which is obtained based on the interference fringes in transmission spectra, similar to the values from the SEM images), the Eg of the direct Sb2Se3 semiconductor can be determined by following the Tauc equation, (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), with A – a fit constant, h – Planck's constant, and ν – the frequency of incident light.36 The inset of Fig. 5 delineates the Tauc-plots of all films. It shows that the absorption-edge corresponding to Eg has a slight red-shift from ∼1.22 eV to 1.18 eV for S1–S3 (growth time increasing), reaching the highest PCE of ∼7.63% for S3. As the time further increases to 4 min, the Eg reversely blue-shifts to ∼1.20 eV but the PCE rapidly decreases to ∼5.45% for S4. This hints at the existence of optimized growth conditions (or Se-rich environment) for depositing the Sb2Se3 absorption layer. More importantly, from the inset we can see that the defect-related absorption below Eg exists, but is substantially suppressed by the Se-rich conditions.

Fig. 6a shows the room temperature SS-PL spectra of S3 (based on which the device has the highest PCE) at different excitation powers. Obviously, there is an extremely wide and almost flat PL band covering the range of ∼0.75–1.25 eV at low excitation densities (∼1 W cm−2), but it is narrowed to the high energy side peaking at EPLh ∼ 1.12 eV due to the decrease of the low energy component at EPLl ∼ 0.84 eV when the excitation density is increased by two orders of magnitude. Notice that there are no visible higher energy PL peaks beyond EPLh, and the EPLh value is slightly smaller than the Eabsg value (∼1.18 eV) as determined by the intrinsic absorption spectrum, between which the energy difference of ∼60 meV can be conceptionally so-called as the Stokes shift. Thereafter, the broad PL band should be defect-related transitions, e.g., the band-tail states or shallow acceptors peaking at EPLh with an average activation energy of ∼60 meV and the deep defects peaking at EPLl with an activation energy of ∼290 meV (300 K; or ∼380 meV at 5 K). To obtain the intrinsic lifetime of the non-equilibrium carriers, Fig. 6b shows the PL decay curve at 300 K with low excitation densities, the energy position of which is set at ∼1.15 eV to avoid the influence from deep defects. Due to the smooth decay behavior without an evident transition point on the curve, we fit the decay curve with a stretched exponential decay function,37It = I0exp(−t/τ1/e)β, where I0 is the PL intensity at t = 0, τ1/e = β·Γ1/β−1·τ0 (Γ – the gamma function), and τ0 is the lifetime of carriers, which gives τ0 = 8.3 μs. This value is by at least one order of magnitude higher than those reported for Sb2Se3.35,38 Notice that, although a longer lifetime means a lower density of deep defects, as also predicted theoretically,28 our experimental results still demonstrate the high concentration of non-radiative recombination centers in the Q1D-grown Sb2Se3 under Se-rich conditions, suggesting that the deep defects are not-so-“deep” as compared to those with much shorter lifetimes.

As a useful tool to characterize the defects, especially the band-tail states and deep defects in semiconductors, spectrally resolved PC spectroscopy is employed to record the photo-generated current of the devices at different temperatures. Fig. 7a shows the PC spectrum at 5 K, together with the SS-PL spectrum at the same temperature to make a comparison. The PC response edge gives a cutoff energy at EPCg ∼1.27 eV (∼1.22 eV at 300 K) simply by referring to the energy point at the half maximum of the intensity, which should be definitely close to the result of intrinsic absorption spectra and can be ascribed to the Eg-value of the Sb2Se3 film in the device structure. As compared to the previous Eabsg ∼ 1.18 eV, the evident blue-shift by ∼90 meV reflects the negative temperature coefficient (∼−305 μeV K−1) of Eg. Notice that the temperature-dependent PC results also show a similar temperature evolution. More importantly, at the low energy side there is an extremely strong PC signal centering at ∼0.84 eV that should be related to deep defects, exactly in line with the corresponding PL result which is also shown in the panel. However, we should point out that with an increase in temperature, the deep defect-related PC signal decreases evidently and even cannot be observed at room temperature, especially under the illumination of the standard visible-/near-infrared light source (see the black curve in Fig. 7a). Thus, combining with the PL results at 300 K, we can imagine that at the working temperature of the solar cells, the deep defects existing with a relatively high concentration can act as the strong non-radiation recombination centers of photogenerated non-equilibrium carriers, largely decreasing the PCE values.
 Fig. 7  (a) PC (red) and TR-PL (blue) spectra of S3 at 5 K. For comparison, the SS-PL spectrum (cyan) at 5 K and the PC spectrum (black) at 300 K are also given. (b) PL decay of the femtosecond-excitation at ∼1.2 eV corresponding to the TR-PL peak in (a), together with the fit result by a double-exponential decay function. 
The TR-PL spectra of the films are further measured at different temperatures, as also shown in Fig. 7a for 5 K. Notice that the TR-PL spectrum shown in the panel has been calibrated, because of the detection limitation at ∼1.0 eV of the setup with a sharp decrease of the detectivity of the equipped streak camera. Except for the relatively weak emission peak at ∼1.2 eV that could be related to the band-tail or shallow defect transition, indeed a deep defect-related emission band below ∼1.15 eV can be observed with an extremely strong intensity, the low energy side below ∼1.0 eV of which is cut exactly due to the detection limit of the TR-PL setup. Correspondingly, Fig. 7b shows the decay curve at ∼1.2 eV from the TR-PL image. Considering the fact that there is an evidently fast process at the start of decay as compared to the sequent process, we fit the curve with a double-exponential decay function, which gives a fast time constant of ∼34.7 ps and a rather slow time constant of ∼5.0 ns. No doubt, the slow one can be ascribed to the time constant of band-tail or shallow defect-related states, as discussed previously in Fig. 6b. By considering the difference of about one order of magnitude between them, we can tentatively ascribe the slow component to the radiative recombination while the fast one is mainly related to non-radiative recombination, e.g., the relaxation of band-tail or shallow carriers to the deep defects. However, the fitted value of ∼5.0 ns is three orders of magnitude shorter than the obtained lifetime of non-equilibrium carriers (∼8.3 μs), which can be understood from the evident decay tail of the slow component due to the high repetition of the fs-laser. In contrast, the determined lifetime of the fast one should be accurate. Thus, we can see that the decay process of the bandedge carriers to the deep defect states is quite fast, which decreases the photogenerated carriers for the photovoltaic effect.
As previously mentioned and well accepted by first-principles calculations,28,29 the deep defects in Sb2Se3 are mainly attributed to the deep donors VSe and SbSe, the energy positions of which due to the three non-equivalent sites of VSe are ∼0.20 eV (VSe1; Se1 having three covalent bonds and bonding to Sb1 with five covalent bonds), 0.80 eV (VSe2; Se2 having three covalent bonds and bonding to Sb2 with three covalent bonds) and 0.65 eV (VSe3; Se3 having two covalent bonds), and those formed by the three non-equivalent sites of SbSe are ∼0.10 eV (SbSe1), 0.50 eV (SbSe2) and 0.30 eV (SbSe3) above the valence band. However, in a Se-rich environment, the formation energy of VSe (<∼0.5 eV) is rather lower than that of SbSe (>∼1.5 eV), and VSe2 has an almost negative formation energy, much smaller than those of VSe1 and VSe3. In this case, it can be inferred that VSe2 with the shallowest energy position compared to those of VSe1 and VSe3 should be rather popular in Sb2Se3 grown under Se-rich conditions. Back to our experimental conditions and structural/optical characterization results, we can find that the observed deep defects emitting with a relatively broad energy distribution down to ∼0.84 eV are well consistent with the theoretical prediction, which are much more likely to be VSe2 in the Eg of Sb2Se3. This can also interpret the ∼μs long carrier lifetime in the grown Sb2Se3 thin films. For simplicity, Fig. 8 schematically shows the bandedge electronic level structure including the main defects obtained experimentally and VSe-related defects from the literature under the Se-rich growth conditions, where the bandedge or band-tail carriers have an extremely fast decay rate of ∼34.7 ps into the residual deep donor of VSe2. Notice that the deep defects shown here are mainly from the non-contact and non-destructive optical spectroscopy on the thin films, the results of which are more intrinsic than those obtained from purely electrical techniques including deep level transient spectroscopy that can be an option for further investigation. Then, we can confirm that the Se-rich conditions have great advantages for eliminating the real deep defects of VSe1 and VSe3, but are not so effective for optimizing the not-so-“deep” defects of VSe2, which significantly limits the enhancement of the PCE value of devices. As a result, it becomes a practical issue to eliminate this kind of VSe for high performance Sb2Se3 film solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, high quality Q1D Sb2Se3 thin films are prepared by optimizing the growth conditions in the VTD technique. By virtue of comprehensive microstructural and optical characterization, we revealed the intrinsic point defects in the Sb2Se3 absorption layer, especially the deep defects related to one (VSe2) of the three non-equivalent VSei (i = 1–3), which locates at ∼0.3 eV (300 K) below the conduction band and largely reduces the transport and separation of photo-generated carriers due to the ultrafast capture rate for non-equilibrium carriers. Even under the Se-rich growth conditions, this kind of VSe2 still survives in a relatively high concentration and results in the bottleneck of the PCE value in the Q1D-grown Sb2Se3 film solar cells. We argue that to effectively annihilate the not-so-deep VSe2 in the Sb2Se3 absorption layer, further optimized Se-rich growth conditions are essential for preparing high performance Sb2Se3-based film solar cells.
