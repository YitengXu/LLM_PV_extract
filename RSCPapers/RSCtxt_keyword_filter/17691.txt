    , Accepted 1st December 2012First published on 3rd December 2012AbstractA novel strategy was introduced to prepare hybrid nanomaterials of platinum nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt–MWCNTs). A thin layer of sulfur on MWCNTs could absorb and bind the Pt precursors from solution on the MWCNTs’ surface and also restrict their particle growth during reduction which resulted in ultrafine dispersions of metal nanocrystallites due to the strong affinity of sulfur for noble metals. The composite material was applied as the counter electrode (Pt–MWCNTs CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and the fill factor (FF) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of the DSC with Pt–MWCNTs CE were 0.63 and 7.69%, respectively. The corresponding values of the DSC with bare Pt CE were 0.55 and 6.31%. The morphology and elemental composition of Pt–MWCNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The dispersion and attachment of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of MWCNTs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Tafel polarization measurement and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed to characterize the catalytic activities of this hybrid CE.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) were first reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 and have received significant attention as potential candidates for the next generation solar cells due to their low-cost, easy fabrication and relatively high conversion efficiency. A typical DSC has a sandwich structure with a photoanode comprising dye sensitized TiO2 nanocrystals, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). As a key component of a DSC, the main function of CEs is promoting the electron translocation from the external circuit back to the redox electrolyte, and catalyzing the reduction of triiodide ions.1–4 It is generally confirmed that platinum (Pt) is a superior CE material with good catalytic activity for I3− reduction. However, the high price and low reserves of Pt are obstacles that limit the commercialization of the DSC.5,6 Furthermore, small particles (including Pt nanoparticles) generally provide high electrocatalytic activity because of their large surface area, but electron transport efficiency would be lowered owing to the abundant grain boundaries and defects.7 Considering the above merits and demerits, researchers decided to amalgamate a highly conductive material with Pt by using a simple and cost-effective fabrication technique.
According to the literature, several low-cost materials have been studied as a replacement of Pt, such as carbon materials (including carbon black, activated carbon, carbon fiber, carbon nanotube, fullerene, mesoporous carbon, and graphene),8–15 conducting polymers,16–18 metal sulfides,19,20 metal nitrides,7,21 metal carbides,22 metal oxides,23,24etc. Among these newly developed substitutes, carbon nanotube (CNT) captures more focus because it owns a fast electron-transport network which results from the coexistence of hopping and diffusive transport pathways and its tubular morphology.25 Ho et al. have achieved a very high power-conversion efficiency (η = 9.04%) of a DSC with a flexible Pt and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) hybrid CE, compared to that of the cell with a conventional Pt CE (η = 7.47%).11 However, the weight ratio of this high effective Pt–MWCNTs hybrid CE material is 2/1, in which the Pt percentage is still too high to reach the target of low-cost.
Herein, we introduce a highly reliable synthetic technique which could not only decorate MWCNTs with a much lower amount of Pt loading, but also result in an ultrafine dispersion and narrow particle size distribution.26 And the power-conversion efficiency of the DSC with Pt–MWCNTs CE is much higher than those with individual Pt CE or MWCNT CE in the DSC.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Pt–MWCNTs nanocomposite
First, a mixture of 10 mg sulfur (Sinopharm, AR) and 90 mg MWCNTs (COCC, OD 8–15 nm) was fully grinded and then heat treated at 155 °C for 2 h under ambient conditions to ensure the carbon surface was adequately modified with sulfur (MWCNT–S). Second, 40 mg H2PtCl6·6H2O powder (Sinopharm, AR) was dissolved in 10 mL deionized (DI) water and sonicated with the as-prepared MWCNT–S powder for 15 min, then stirred and heated at 120 °C for 3 h to get H2PtCl6 impregnated MWCNT–S powder. Finally, the Pt-absorbed material was treated in a reducing atmosphere of 7% H2/N2 at 350 °C for 3 h. The residual sulfur was then completely removed by evacuation at 300 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Preparation of Pt–MWCNTs coated counter electrode
The Pt–MWCNTs coated counter electrodes were prepared on a F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) substrate (NSG, 8 Ω per square) using a paste that was made from the above obtained Pt–MWCNTs powder by screen printing technology. Then the formed films were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. The MWCNTs CE and Pt CE films were prepared by the same procedure as the Pt–MWCNTs CE except the Pt CE films were annealed under ambient conditions.
2.3 Fabrication of DSCs
The working photoanodes were prepared through the following procedure: the blocking layer was first deposited on the FTO by dipping each FTO substrate in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C (TiCl4 treatment). A 12 μm thick layer of 25 nm sized TiO2 particles (Degussa P25) was loaded onto the FTO by the screen printing technique with an area of about 0.25 cm2. After sintering at 125 °C, the obtained layer was coated with a 4 μm thick scattering layer of 200 nm sized TiO2 particles (HEPTACHROMA, DHS-NanoT200) followed by sintering at 500 °C. Another TiCl4 treatment was carried followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the photoanodes were transferred to a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (V/V = 1/1) for 24 h to obtain dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. The two electrodes were sealed by heating a 25 μm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont) to prevent the electrolyte solution from leaking. DSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte for cells was composed of 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate with acetonitrile as the solvent.
2.4 Instrumentation
The current–voltage tests of DSCs were performed under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe). The Pt–MWCNTs composites were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F, F20, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). The EIS experiment and Tafel polarization curves were measured with full cells and dummy cells, respectively, in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). The frequency range of EIS experiments was from 1 MHz to 100 mHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and bias DC voltage of −0.60 V. Tafel polarization measurements were carried out with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The curves were fitted by the Zview software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 650C). The Ag/Ag+ couple was employed as reference electrode, and the counter electrode was a platinum foil.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Schematic diagram
The Pt–MWCNTs composite was obtained by the following steps (Fig. 1). In this procedure, the carbon surface was modified with sulfur as a metal trap because sulfur exhibited a strong affinity for noble metals owing to a soft acid–soft base interaction.27 A thin layer of sulfur on the MWCNTs could absorb and bind the Pt precursors from the solution onto the MWCNT surface and meanwhile restrict their particle growth during reduction to result in ultrafine dispersions of metal nanocrystallites. After the Pt nanoparticles were reduced in the H2/N2 atmosphere, the residual sulfur can be completely removed by heat and vacuum treatments, which prevent it from destroying the catalytic activity of CE materials.26

3.2 Characterization of Pt–MWCNTs nanocomposite
A typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 2a) shows the overall morphology of Pt–MWCNTs, from which the fiber-like morphology of MWCNTs can be observed. To further investigate the Pt loading on the surface of the MWCNTs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used. In Fig. 2b, the walls of the MWCNTs are locally distorted near the Pt nanoparticles, indicating a strong interaction between the Pt nanoparticles and MWCNTs which might result from the sulfur's mediation and therefore would benefit the electron transfer when used as CE.

(b) TEM image of monodispersed Pt nanoparticles on MWCNTs (scale bar: 5 nm) and (d) nanocrystallite size distribution of Pt nanoparticles loaded on MWCNTs (based on a count of 100 crystallites, inset TEM with scale bar: 10 nm). 
The elemental analysis of these Pt nanoparticles, employing energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 2c), revealed there are elements of Pt and C in the sample, which means the composite prepared by our new strategy is composed of Pt and MWCNTs, with no sulfur residue. The size distribution image (Fig. 2d) confirmed that Pt nanoparticles, with mainly a size range of 1.5–2.5 nm, are dispersedly loaded on the surface of the MWCNTs.
3.3 Photovoltaic measurement
The performance of the DSC with Pt–MWCNTs CE was studied in comparison to those of DSCs with Pt CE and MWCNTs CE (Fig. 3). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSCs were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. From Table 1, the DSC with Pt–MWCNTs CE shows a short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of 16.27 mA cm−2 and 7.69%, the corresponding values of the Pt CE were 15.96 mA cm−2 and 6.31% and of the MWCNTs CE were 13.40 mA cm−2 and 5.32%. While the open-circuit voltage (VOC) values are almost the same, indicating the synergic effect has little influence in voltage fluctuation.

It is obvious that the bare Pt CE exhibits a better electrical conductivity than the MWCNTs CE. By loading a small amount of Pt nanoparticles, the JSC value of Pt–MWCNTs CE improves a lot compared to that of the MWCNTs CE. And with a better fill factor (FF = 0.63), the DSC with a Pt–MWCNTs CE shows a large improvement of 21.9% in power-conversion efficiency compared to the bare Pt CE, which highlights the predominant synergic effect of MWCNTs and Pt nanoparticles.
3.4 Electrochemical measurements
In order to determine the catalytic activity of the CE materials for triiodide reduction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. Fig. 4 shows Nyquist plots of the full cells fabricated with Pt–MWCNTs electrode, MWCNTs electrode and Pt electrode as CE. The high-frequency (corresponding to low Z′) intercept on the real axis (Z′ axis) represents the series resistance (Rs). The left arch can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) and the corresponding double layer capacitance (Cdl1) of the counter electrode–electrolyte interface.
 Fig. 4  EIS data of the DSCs with Pt CE, MWCNTs CE and Pt–MWCNTs CE, measured at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. 
The values of Rs, Rct1, and Cdl1 are obtained by fitting the spectra in Fig. 4 with an EIS spectrum analyzer and are summarized in Table 1. The circuit model is inserted in Fig. 4. Rs is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of CEs materials, the resistance of FTO glass substrate, contact resistance, and electron transport resistance of the TiO2 film, etc. The relatively faster electron transfer kinetics of carbon material and the strong interaction between Pt nanoparticles and MWCNTs leads to a decrease in Rs of Pt–MWCNTs CE compared to the Pt CE. And it might be the poor connection of Pt nanoparticles that results in the comparatively lower electric conductivity of the Pt CE. Rct1 is a measure of the ease of electron exchange between the counter electrode and the electrolyte and thus varies inversely with the triiodide reduction activity of the CEs. The lower Rct1 value of Pt–MWCNTs CE means there are fewer losses at the electrolyte–counter electrode interface and a better catalytic activity, giving a better operation of the cell.28Cdl1 stands for double layer capacitance which develops at the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the accumulation of ions at the counter electrode surface and could qualitatively represent real surface areas of the electrodes. Due to the high specific surface area of MWCNTs, it is reasonable that the Cdl1 value of Pt–MWCNTs CE is higher than that of the Pt CE. So it can be concluded that the low Rs, low Rct1 and high Cdl1 contribute to the increments of JSC and FF values, and finally result in the high power-conversion efficiency of the DSC with Pt–MWCNTs CE. The EIS results agreed well with the photovoltaic experiments.
To further examine the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the triiodide/iodide couple on the electrode surface, Tafel polarization measurements were carried out with dummy cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE//electrolyte//CE). Fig. 5 shows the current density (J) as a function of the voltage (U) for the oxidation/reduction of triiodide to iodide.
 Fig. 5  Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical counter electrodes of MWCNTs, Pt–MWCNTs and Pt nanoparticles. 
Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones depending on the overpotential value: the polarization zone at low overpotential (|U| < 120 mV), Tafel zone at intermediate overpotential (with a sharp slope) and diffusion zone at high overpotential. From the Tafel zone and diffusion zone, the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) are obtained, which have a close relationship with the catalytic activity of the catalysts. In the Tafel zone, the anodic and cathodic branches of the Pt–MWCNTs CE show a larger slope than the conventional Pt CE and MWCNTs CE, indicating the presence of a large exchange current density (J0) on the electrode surfaces, which means that Pt–MWCNTs CE has a higher catalytic activity than the bare Pt CE and MWCNTs CE. J0 can be also calculated by eqn (1), where Rct is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from EIS spectra (Fig. 4), R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is Faraday's constant. And the calculated J0 values also follow the order of Pt–MWCNTs > Pt > MWCNTs. (1)
The electrocatalytic properties of Pt CE, MWCNTs CE and Pt–MWCNTs CE were also studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the results are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  CV curves for Pt CE, MWCNTs CE and Pt–MWCNTs CE. 
For the Pt–MWCNTs CE, typical curves with two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (O-1/R-1, O-2/R-2) were obtained as reported in the previous literature.29 The left pair of redox peaks corresponds to the reaction of (eqn (2)), while the right pair corresponds to the reaction of (eqn (3)): I3− + 2e = 3I−(2) 3I2 + 2e = 2I3−(3)
The characteristics of the peaks (O-1 and R-1) are investigated to further understand the electrocatalytic process of redox mediators on various CEs because oxidized ions (triiodide) in the electrolyte diffuse to the CE and are finally reduced to iodide on the surface of the CE.
As shown in Fig. 6, the Pt–MWCNTs CE has a smaller peak-to-peak splitting (Epp = 350 mV) and higher current densities than those of the Pt–CE and MWCNTs CE, suggesting that the reversibility of the I3−/I− redox reaction on Pt–MWCNTs CE is greater than that of the conventional Pt CE and the electrocatalytic activity towards the I3−/I− redox reaction is greater.29 From the CV result, the synergic effect of Pt–MWCNTs can be attributed to have a superior electrocatalytic activity in reducing triiodide, which is in accordance with the results of EIS and Tafel analysis.
Conclusions
Here, a novel loading technique is introduced to prepare a Pt–MWCNTs composite where Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 1.5–2.5 nm are homogeneously dispersed on the MWCNTs’ surface with the facilitation of sulfur's strong metal affinity. As a highly-efficient CE material for a DSC, the Pt–MWCNTs composite shows a better photovoltaic performance than the conventional Pt electrode, which is deduced to result from the ultrafine combination of superior electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity derived from the strong interactions within the structure. Furthermore, the low weight ratio of the Pt–MWCNTs composite corresponds to the objective of low-cost and this design strategy would be very promising to pave the way to the large-scale commercialization of DSCs.
