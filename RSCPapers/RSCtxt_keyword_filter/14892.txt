Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are attracting current attention as a promising candidate for low cost photovoltaics,1,2 although further improvements are requested for the practical applications. Among several components of DSSCs, sensitizing dyes play an important role in harvesting light and in initiating electrochemical processes for power generation. Therefore, the development of sensitizing dyes is important for the improvement of photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. High efficiency values have been reported, at present, for DSSCs using Ru complex dyes3 or porphyrin dyes.4,5 Organic dyes with donor–π-conjugated chain–acceptor (D–π–A) structure have been also investigated intentionally,2,6–11 in view of their metal-free feature, variety of color, or synthetic easiness, although their photoelectric conversion efficiencies have been lower than Ru complexes. For the efficient light-harvesting over the visible region, several reports on organic dyes adopted large π-conjugation systems.12–14 To reduce synthetic hardness, it would be useful to develop a more efficient way for π-extension to extend photo-absorption regions. In this regard, we have focused on quinoidal structures. Although the quinoidal structure seems promising for extending π-conjugation effectively, no report on DSSCs using organic dyes with quinoidal structures as π-conjugated chains has been found. Recently, we reported DSSCs using a benzoquinoid dye, [4-(1′,3′-benzodithiol-2′-ylidene)-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]cyanoacetic acid.15 However, the LUMO level of the benzoquinoid dye was too low for electron injection from its excited state. In this study, a quinoidal thiophene is adopted as the π-conjugated chain, and an N,N-dimethylaminophenyl group is adopted as the donor part (Fig. 1), to improve the donor ability of the compound. In other D–π–A type organic dyes adopting thiophenes as the π-conjugated chains, the acceptor part (cyanoacrylic acid) and the thiophene unit were connected with a single bond. In the case of this quinoidal thiophene dye, cyano-[5′-(4′′-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzylidene)-5H-thiophen-2′-ylidene]acetic acid, the acceptor part and the π-conjugated chain is tightly connected. By adopting the quinoidal structure, light harvesting at longer wavelengths is expected, leading to reasonably high photoelectric conversion efficiency for the minimum size sensitizer.

Experimental section
Synthesis
The synthetic scheme of the quinoidal thiophene dye is shown in Fig. 2. The precursor material, cyano(thiophen-2-yl)acetic acid tert-butyl ester, was synthesized by the Gompper coupling reaction16 of 2-iodothiophene with tert-butyl cyanoacetate, and the donor part was formed by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of thiophene at the 5-position with 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzaldehyde in acetic anhydride. Finally, the tert-butyl ester was hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid.

All reactions were performed under an Ar atmosphere. All starting materials and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals, Kanto Chemicals, Tokyo Chemical Industry, or Merck, and used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECS 400 spectrometer. The chemical shifts were reported in δ scale (ppm) using the residual solvent proton as the internal standard (CHCl3: 7.26 ppm, DMSO-d5: 2.50 ppm). ESI-Mass spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF, using MeOH as the solvent.

Sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil, 0.50 g, 12 mmol) was washed with hexane to remove the oil and dried, then 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran was added. Toward the suspension, tert-butyl cyanoacetate (0.87 mL, 6.0 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min, then 2-iodothiophene (0.33 mL, 3.0 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0.175 g, 0.15 mmol) were added, and the mixture was refluxed for 5 h. After cooling to 0 °C, water was added and the solution was stirred for 30 min. The solution was extracted with diethylether and water. The aqueous layer was acidified at 0 °C with 1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. The solution was extracted with diethylether, and the organic layer was washed with water and dried over Na2SO4. After the removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane as the eluent to yield the title product (0.221 g, 33%).

Cyano-[5-(4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzylidene)-5H-thiophen-2-ylidene]acetic acid tert-butyl ester (3). 
A solution of cyano(thiophen-2-yl)acetic acid tert-butyl ester (2) (0.114 g, 0.51 mmol) and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzaldehyde (0.151 g, 1.0 mmol) in acetic anhydride (10 mL) was heated at 100 °C for 6 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane–hexane (2:1) as the eluent to yield the title product (0.115 g, 64%). ESI-MS (m/z): [M + H]+ calcd for C20H22N2O2S, 355.15; found 355.12. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K): δ 7.57 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 7.28 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 7.14 (s, 1H), 7.09 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 6.69 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 3.06 (s, 6H), 1.54 (s, 9H).

Measurements
UV-visible absorption spectra and emission spectra were taken using a JASCO V-570 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer or a Shimadzu RF-503A spectrofluorophotometer. To observe pico-second time-resolved transient absorption spectra, a mode-locked laser pulse from a Ti:sapphire-laser–regenerative-amplifier system (Spectra-Physics, Hurricane) was split into excitation and probe light. The excitation pulse was converted to 550 nm with optical parametric oscillator (Spectra-Physics, Topas C), and the probe pulse was converted to white-light with a sapphire. The spectra were analyzed with a system provided by Tokyo Instruments. Redox potentials were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry on a BAS100 electrochemical analyzer. The working electrode was a ϕ 1.6 mm Pt electrode and the reference electrode was an SCE (saturated aqueous KCl). 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile. The ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as the internal standard (0.40 V vs. SCE).17
Cell assembly
TiO2 paste (SOLARONIX Ti-Nanoxide) was deposited onto F-doped tin oxide coated glass plate (Nippon Sheet Glass, 10 Ω per square) by silk-screen printing. The resulting layer (area: 0.16 cm2) was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air and was treated with TiCl4. The film thickness was 20 μm. The heated TiO2 film was immersed in a 0.1 mM solution of the dye in methanol for 5 h at 30 °C in the dark. In some cases, deoxycholic acid (DCA) was added to the immersing solution. The electrode was rinsed with acetonitrile before use and dried. An open sandwich cell was fabricated with the dye-loaded TiO2 film, Pt-coated glass plate, and 30 μm Himilan film as the working electrode, counter electrode, and spacer, respectively. The solution of 0.10 M LiI, 0.025 M I2, and 0.60 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) in acetonitrile was used as the electrolyte. In some cases, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was added to the electrolyte.
Measurements of photovoltaic properties
The current–voltage characteristic curves of the solar cells were measured using a Hokuto Denko HSV-100 potentiostat under the irradiation from a Yamashita Denso YSS-80 solar simulator (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a JASCO SM-250 system.
Results and discussion
Absorption and emission spectra
The quinoidal thiophene dye showed an absorption maximum at 548 nm in acetonitrile (Fig. 3). Compared to D–π–A type organic dyes with similar π-conjugation length using a thiophene as a π-conjugated chain, such as 2-cyano-3-[5′-(4′′-(N,N-diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen-2′-yl]acrylic acid (404 nm),8 the absorption maximum of the quinoidal thiophene dye is placed at longer wavelengths. In a quinoidal structure, the cyclic part is connected to other parts with double bonds, suppressing the rotation around the bond, which is often seen in aromatic rings connected with single bonds. Therefore, π-conjugation is efficiently expanded by the use of quinoidal structures with high coplanarity.
 Fig. 3  Absorption (solid lines) and emission (broken lines) spectra of quinoidal thiophene dye in chloroform (thin lines) and acetonitrile (thick lines). 
For the further investigation, absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene dye were observed in various solvents. Although solvent dependent spectral properties have been well documented for D–π–A type compounds, there have been only a few comprehensive studies on D–π–A type organic dyes for DSSCs.18 The absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene dye in chloroform and acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 3, and the absorption maxima are plotted versus solvent polarity in Fig. 4, using the polarity function Δf = (ε − 1)/(ε + 2) − (n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2), where ε and n are the relative permittivity and the refractive index of the solvent. As seen in Fig. 4, the absorption maximum of the dye shifts to longer wavelengths along with increasing solvent polarity, except for alcohols, which make special interaction with the dye molecules through hydrogen-bonds.19 This result indicates that the quinoidal thiophene dye in the excited state is more polar than in the ground state. Therefore, the absorption of the quinoidal thiophene dye has a contribution from charge-transfer transitions from the donor site to the acceptor site. However, the shift caused by solvent polarity is small, indicating that the degree of charge-transfer nature is limited and the absorption is basically derived from π–π* transition.
 Fig. 4  Solvent dependence of absorption maxima of quinoidal thiophene dye, plotted versus Δf. Dashed line is the fitting line for the 5 points shown in filled style. 
As shown in Fig. 3, emission of the quinoidal thiophene dye in acetonitrile (656 nm) appeared at longer wavelengths than that in chloroform (593 nm), exhibiting a similar tendency to the absorption spectra. The difference in emission maxima is much larger than the difference in absorption maxima. The large Stokes shift in acetonitrile (ΔE = 0.38 eV) indicates large structural difference between ground and excited states, suggesting the possibility of the formation of the charge-transfer state. The charge-transfer excited state is preferable for the electron injection from a D–π–A type dye to a TiO2 conduction band, since the electron density around the acceptor moiety is expected to be increased in the excited state.
The picosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene dye in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the emission spectrum in Fig. 3, the peak around 660 nm in the transient spectrum is attributed to the emission of the quinoidal thiophene dye. Breaching should not appear around here since there is no absorption peak in the ground state. The time-profile of Δabsorbance at 660 nm showed almost single exponential decay (Fig. 6), which was fitted with τ = 7.9 ps. Therefore, the emissive state is deactivated within such a timescale in solution.

Consideration of energy level matching
In order to consider energy level matching in DSSCs, the redox potential of the quinoidal thiophene dye was determined by the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The first oxidation potential of the quinoidal thiophene dye was +0.74 V vs. SCE (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is positive enough for the dye regeneration, compared with the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide redox couple (+0.2 V vs. SCE).20 This potential is lower than the benzoquinoid dye (+0.86 V)15 by 0.12 V, indicating the improved donor ability of this compound by the use of quinoidal thiophene instead of benzoquinoid structure. The oxidation potential of the excited state of the quinoidal thiophene dye was estimated from the oxidation potential at the ground state and the excitation energy, which was derived from the emission maximum wavelength (656 nm, 1.88 eV), to be −1.14 V vs. SCE. This potential is negative enough for the electron injection, compared with the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band edge (−0.7 V vs. SCE).20 In the case of the benzoquinoid dye, the reduction potential, which is usually more negative than the oxidation potential of the excited state, was −0.72 V. The energy level matching of the quinoidal thiophene dye is improved.
Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
The action spectrum of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the DSSC using the quinoidal thiophene dye is shown in Fig. 7 by the thin line. Under this situation, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC was 3.1% (open-circuit photovoltage VOC = 0.45 V, short-circuit photocurrent density JSC = 10.8 mA cm−2, fill factor FF = 0.63). The lower quantum efficiency may be caused by dye-aggregation. Upon the adsorption onto TiO2, the absorption peak of the quinoidal thiophene dye is blue-shifted by 34 nm, indicating the formation of stacked aggregation. Such aggregate formation often causes fast deactivation of the excited state. In the case of stacked aggregation, there would be dye molecules remote from the surface of TiO2. If such a remote dye absorbs light, it is hard to transfer electron to the TiO2 surface, and the excitation energy would be wasted. In order to minimize the effect of aggregate formation, deoxycholic acid (DCA) was added to the solution for dye adsorption onto TiO2. When 10 mM (100 equivalent to dye) DCA was added to the dye solution, the absorption spectrum of the dye with DCA on TiO2 showed a red-shifted maximum (514 nm) compared to that of the dye alone on TiO2 (495 nm), indicating that the aggregate formation was suppressed, although the absorption maximum wavelength was still shorter than that in solution (Fig. S2, ESI†), also indicating the presence of remaining aggregation. The photovoltaic performance parameters of the DSSCs using the quinoidal thiophene dye with DCA are summarized in Table 1. The open-circuit voltage VOC shows a higher value along with the increase in the DCA amount. Such tendency would be the result of suppressed reverse electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the redox couple, since a decrease in dark-current was observed for these DSSCs with a larger amount of DCA, which is regarded as a barrier layer. In the case of large-size dyes, dye molecules themselves are regarded as a barrier layer.5 Concerning short-circuit photocurrent density JSC, the highest value was obtained when 30 mM DCA was added to the dye solution. By the addition of DCA, dye aggregation is suppressed to improve the efficiency of electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2 conduction band. Simultaneously, the addition of DCA causes the decrease in the adsorbed amount of dyes on TiO2, leading to the decrease in light-harvesting efficiency. The former effect brings increased photocurrent, while the latter effect makes photocurrent decrease. The highest JSC was observed as a result of the balance of these opposite effects. Such tendency was also observed for IPCE action spectra of these DSSCs. The IPCE value reached almost 90% in the highest case as shown in Fig. 7 by the thick line. Reflecting the tendency of VOC and JSC, the photoelectric conversion efficiency η is the highest when 30 mM DCA was added to the dye solution.

It should be noted here that the excited state of the quinoidal thiophene dye is deactivated within several picoseconds as described above. Therefore, the electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2 conduction band should occur within this timescale. It has been considered that the electron injection process is completed within a sub-picosecond timescale.21 Recently, some arguments arose for this consideration, appealing that there are slow injection processes.22 In the case of ruthenium complexes for DSSCs, their excited state lifetime is longer than sub-nanosecond scale, reserving a possibility for slow injection processes. In the case of the quinoidal thiophene dye, the short excited state lifetime limits the slow injection process. Considering the light reflection at the device surface or other losses, the IPCE value of 90% signifies almost quantitative electron injection. Therefore, it should be concluded in this case that the electron injection process is completed within several picoseconds.
The addition of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) to the electrolyte is often examined for DSSCs to improve their output voltage. Table 2 shows the effect of TBP addition in the present case. Dye-adsorption onto TiO2 was performed in the presence of 30 mM DCA as is optimized above. The open-circuit photovoltage VOC increases along with the increase in TBP concentration, as expected. On the other hand, the short-circuit photocurrent density JSC decreases along with the increase in TBP concentration. As a result, the maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency η = 5.2% was obtained for the DSSC with 0.3 M TBP. The photocurrent–voltage characteristic curve for the optimized condition is shown in Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  Photocurrent–voltage characteristic curve of DSSC using quinoidal thiophene dye with DCA and TBP. 
The photocurrent of the DSSCs using quinoidal thiophene dye decreased significantly by the addition of TBP to the electrolyte. It is considered commonly that the addition of TBP shifts the conduction band edge of TiO2 to negative potentials. In this case, the energy gap between the LUMO level of the dye and the TiO2 conduction band edge would become small, causing a small driving force for electron transfer, which leads to a decrease in photocurrent.
Conclusions
A D–π–A type organic dye composed of a quinoidal thiophene as a π-conjugated chain was synthesized and applied to DSSCs. The absorption band of this quinoidal thiophene dye appeared at longer wavelengths than those of dyes with similar π-conjugation structure, indicating the effective π-conjugation through the quinoidal structure. Although the excited state of the quinoidal thiophene dye is deactivated within several picoseconds even in solution, the DSSCs using the quinoidal thiophene dye showed IPCE values of more than 90%, demonstrating the fast and efficient electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2. By optimizing the fabrication conditions, the DSSC using this dye afforded a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.2%, without enlarging the molecular size.
