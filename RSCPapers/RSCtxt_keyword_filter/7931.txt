    , Accepted 19th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractFluorination of conjugated polymers is one of the effective strategies to tune the frontier energy levels for achieving high efficiency polymer solar cells. In this study, three fluorinated D–A polymers, consisting of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with different numbers of fluorine substitution, were synthesized in order to investigate the effect of fluorination on their photovoltaic properties. The polymers with fluorinated BT show lower frontier energy levels, improved polymer ordering, and a narrower fibril size in the blend with PC71BM. The polymer with mono-fluorinated BT exhibits a superior PCE of 9.14% due to a high SCLC hole mobility, mixed orientation of polymer crystals in the active layer, and low bimolecular recombination. This result demonstrates that the fluorine content in conjugated polymers should be controlled for optimizing optoelectrical and photovoltaic properties of fluorinated conjugated polymers.

Broader context
Development of new semi-conducting polymers plays a critical role in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Among various approaches to develop high performance conjugated polymers, the introduction of fluorine atoms on alternating conjugated copolymers composed of electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units has recently been considered as a promising approach because of its unique advantages including energy level lowering without sacrifice of bandgaps and improvement of molecular ordering by induced dipole along the C–F bond, and no steric hindrance due to the small size of fluorine atoms. However, the fluorination can also lead to negative effects on polymer properties such as low solubility in the organic solvent, an unsuitable energy level for exciton separation and charge transport, and large aggregation of polymer chains in the active layer of PSCs. Hence, the degree of fluorination should be optimized to achieve a high efficiency of PSCs. In this work, we synthesized three fluorinated polymers, consisting of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with different numbers of fluorine substitution, and their optoelectrical, photophysical and photovoltaic properties are compared to find the optimum fluorination. Among the three fluorinated polymers, the polymer with mono-fluorinated BT exhibit an outstanding device performance with a superior PCE of 9.14%.

Introduction
Over the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have intensively been investigated as a promising renewable energy source due to solution processability, rapid energy payback time and mechanical flexibility,1 and understanding the relationship between chemical structure and optoelectrical properties of polymers largely contributes to such a rapid development of high performance PSCs: high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been achieved by designing the chemical structure of conjugated polymers using the functional group substitution,2 the fusion of aromatic rings,3 the optimization of side chains,4 and end-group modification.5
Among several strategies for designing conjugated polymers, the substitution of fluorine atoms on the conjugated polymer backbone has attracted much attention for the last few years due to their unique advantages including energy level lowering without sacrifice of the bandgap, improvement of molecular ordering by an induced dipole along the C–F bond, and no steric hindrance due to the small size of fluorine atoms (van der Waals radius, r = 1.35 Å). Recently, it has been reported that the PSCs based on fluorinated conjugated polymers exhibit high PCEs over 7%.6 Although fluorination on conjugated polymers has many benefits, the fluorination can also lead to negative effects on polymer properties such as low solubility in the organic solvent, unsuitable energy levels for exciton separation and charge transport, and large aggregation of polymers in the active layer of PSCs.7 Hence, the degree of fluorination on conjugated polymers (i.e., the number of substituted fluorine atoms in one repeating unit of the polymer) should be optimized for achieving highly efficient PSCs.
Currently, conjugated polymers based on 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene have been proposed as promising candidates for high performance PSCs by our group: a polythiophene derivative, comprised of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene and 3,4-dialkylthiophene, has shown a promising PCE of 5.2%.8a We have also reported synthesis and photovoltaic properties of two kinds of D–A polymers with each being fluorinated on D and A units, where quaterthiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) are used as the D and the A unit, respectively, in order to investigate the effect of the fluorination position on photophysical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. Although the fluorination on either D or A unit effectively enhances the intermolecular interaction and lowers both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels retaining a low bandgap of 1.58 eV, the polymer with a fluorinated D unit exhibits a high PCE of 7.10% while the polymer with a fluorinated A unit exhibits a PCE of 6.75%, demonstrating that the fluorination on the D unit in the D–A polymer is very promising and comparable to or even more effective than the fluorination on the A unit for achieving high performance solar cells.8b Here one may have a question whether the photophysical properties and device performances can be further enhanced when both D and A units in the D–A type conjugated polymer are fluorinated.
Recently, Hou et al.6h have achieved a high PCE of 8.6% with the D–A polymer consisting of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene by fluorination on both D and A units for lowering molecular energy levels. However, to fully understand the effect of fluorination on both D and A units, more detailed studies based on polymers with different chemical structures should be required. In this work, we synthesized three fluorinated D–A polymers with different numbers of fluorination, consisting of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (D unit) and BT (A unit) with/without fluorination (Scheme 1), where the total number of fluorine atoms in polymers is controlled by the number of fluorine substitution on the BT unit, in order to investigate the effect of the number of fluorine substitution on photophysical properties of polymers and the device performances of PSCs. We have observed that additional fluorine substitution on the A unit (BT) lowers further the frontier energy levels and enhances molecular ordering of the conjugated polymers, while two fluorine atoms are already introduced on the D unit. When compared with the polymer with non-fluorinated BT (denoted 2F), the polymer with mono-fluorinated BT (denoted 3F) shows higher PSC performances with a superior PCE of 9.14% but the polymer with di-fluorinated BT (denoted 4F) exhibits a lower PCE of 6.43% because of higher bimolecular charge recombination and lower SCLC hole mobility. This result clearly demonstrates that the optoelectrical and photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers are significantly affected by the number of fluorine atoms substituted on conjugated polymers, and therefore the number of fluorine substitution should be controlled for achieving high performance PSCs.

Results and discussion
Three fluorinated polymers (2F, 3F and 4F) with different numbers of fluorine substitution were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction in toluene–DMF with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst, as shown in Scheme 1. Long and branched alkyl chains (2-decyltetradecyl) were introduced on the conjugated backbone to ensure the solubility of fluorinated polymers in organic solvents. The number average molecular weights of 2F, 3F and 4F as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are 35, 33 and 40 kg mol−1 with the polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.60, 2.08 and 1.86, respectively (Table 1).

The effect of fluorine substitution on optical properties of the polymers is examined by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1). When the optical bandgaps of fluorinated polymers are determined from the onset of UV-vis absorption spectra in film state and summarized in Table 1, it reveals that the bandgaps of 2F and 3F are nearly identical (1.57 eV) while 4F has a slightly wider bandgap of 1.59 eV. Notably, 3F and 4F polymers show a stronger vibronic shoulder at around 705 nm than the 2F polymer, indicating that the introduction of fluorine atoms on the BT unit enhances the interchain interaction between polymer chains.

Fluorine substitution on the BT unit may also influence the electrochemical properties of polymers. Since strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms lowers the frontier energy levels of polymers, the HOMO energy level becomes deeper as the number of fluorine substitution increases: the HOMO energy levels of 2F, 3F and 4F are −5.33 eV, −5.37 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI† and Table 1). When the LUMO energy levels of polymers were estimated by adding the optical bandgap to the HOMO energy level, the 2F, 3F and 4F polymers have LUMO energy levels of −3.76, −3.80 and −3.87 eV, respectively, which provide a sufficient LUMO level offset between polymers and PCBM (−4.3 eV) for effective exciton dissociation at the interface between the donor and the acceptor.9
The torsion angles in the backbone of fluorinated polymers are calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) with truncated molecular models (see Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†).10 All fluorinated polymers exhibit a nearly planar structure because the small size of fluorine atoms does not significantly induce steric hindrance. This planarity of the conjugated polymer backbone can improve the intermolecular interaction between polymer chains and thus extend the π-conjugation. The DFT calculation also reveals that the HOMO and LUMO electrons in all fluorinated polymers are well localized on the D and A unit, respectively, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer from the D to A unit takes place effectively regardless of the number of fluorine substitution (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The charge-transport properties of polymers are measured by fabricating organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The OFET performances are optimized at 150 °C annealing, and its device parameters are summarized in Table 2. Although all the polymers have low-lying energy levels due to strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine, all the devices exhibit typical behavior of a p-channel transistor (Fig. S4, ESI†). The device with 4F exhibits the highest performance with a FET hole mobility of 0.62 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that fluorination can improve the charge transport property of a polymer. To compare the photovoltaic properties of fluorinated polymers, the PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag.11 The J–V characteristics of PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 2a and relevant photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 3. The optimum blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM was 1:1.5 when 2 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was used as an additive for the optimum morphology of the active layer in PSCs.12 Since VOC of PSC is proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer and the LUMO energy level of the fullerene acceptor, VOCs of 3F and 4F are larger than 2F. Note here that the HOMO energy levels of 3F and 4F are deeper than 2F. While the 2F polymer exhibits a promising PCE of 7.11% with a JSC of 14.1 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.80 V and a FF of 63%, the 3F polymer with mono-fluorinated BT unit exhibits much higher PCE of 9.14% with significantly enhanced JSC and FF (JSC = 15.7 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.82 V and FF = 71%). However, the polymer with the di-fluorinated BT unit (4F) exhibits a lower device performance with a PCE below 7%, demonstrating that the degree of fluorination on the conjugated polymer backbone should be controlled for achieving a high efficiency. When the EQEs of devices were measured under monochromatic light, as shown in Fig. 2b, it reveals that the 3F polymer exhibits higher EQE than 2F and 4F polymers in the entire range of wavelengths, consistent with higher JSC of solar cells with 3F.

For the purpose to investigate the reason why the 3F exhibits a better photovoltaic performance than others, the bimolecular charge recombination in the active layer was estimated by measuring the photocurrent (Jph) as a function of light intensity between 0.4 and 2 sun. When the photocurrent (Jph) at V = 0 V is plotted against the light intensity (Plight) on the full logarithm scale, straight lines are obtained, as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). The relationship between Jph and Plight can be represented by a power law equation: Jph ∝ (Plight)α, where α is the recombination parameter and a higher α value represents lower bimolecular recombination in the active layer.13a–c Since 2F:PC71BM (0.97) and 3F:PC71BM (0.98) show higher α values than 4F:PC71BM (0.95), the bimolecular recombination is more suppressed in the active layers with 2F and 3F polymers than the active layer with the 4F polymer and this large bimolecular recombination loss in the active layer with the 4F polymer may decrease VOCs of solar cells with 4F.13d,e
The hole mobility in the active layer was also measured from the dark J–V curve of a hole-only device by using the SCLC model (Fig. S5b, ESI†). Although the 4F polymer shows the highest FET hole mobility (Table 2), the SCLS hole mobility of the device with 3F:PC71BM (5.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than those of the devices with 2F:PC71BM (4.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 4F:PC71BM (2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), implying that the charge carrier pathways are well developed in the active layer of the PSC device fabricated from the 3F polymer. This will also be discussed in terms of the orientation of polymer crystals in the blend as follows.
Since the crystallinity and the crystal orientation of polymers are important parameters to determine the charge transport properties in photovoltaic devices, the crystal properties of 2F, 3F and 4F polymers were investigated by the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) with two different incident angles (αi = 0.08 and 0.13°) (Fig. 3), where the X-ray with an incident angle of 0.08° (αi ≤ critical angle of the film) is sensitively diffracted on the near-surface region of the film and the X-ray with an incident angle of 0.13° (critical angle of the film < αi < critical angle of the substrate) penetrates whole film thickness and thus provides the diffractions in the bulk of the film.14 In diffractions of all pristine films, only (h00) reflections are observed in the out-of-plane (qz) direction, indicating that most of the polymer crystals adopt the edge-on orientation on the substrate in the entire film thickness, and the intense (100) diffraction peaks at qz = 0.25 Å−1 corresponding to the interchain distance of 25.3 Å are observed for all polymers. The (010) diffraction peaks of pristine 2F, 3F and 4F polymer films are observed in-plane direction at qxy = 1.72, 1.73 and 1.77 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.66, 3.63 and 3.55 Å. The shorter π–π stacking distance of the 4F polymer may contribute to the higher FET hole mobility in OFETs (Table 2). When the polymers are blended with PC71BM, the crystal orientations of polymers are changed in blends. As shown in Fig. 3(d1), (e1) and (f1), the diffractions of polymer:PC71BM blend films as measured at an incident angle of 0.13° reveal that both (100) and (010) diffraction peaks are observed in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that polymer crystals take both edge-on and face-on orientation (mixed orientation) in the bulk of blend films. However, when diffractions are measured at an incident angle of 0.08° for investigating the orientation of polymer crystals at the near-surface region of the blend film, the 2F polymer crystals in the blend do not show (010) diffraction in the out-of-plane direction, implying that the edge-on orientation of 2F polymer crystals is dominant at the near surface region, while the 3F and 4F polymer crystals in the blend films still take mixed orientation with discernible (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction. The difference of crystal orientation between the bulk and the surface of blend films can be clearly seen in azimuthal angle scans of the (100) reflection (Fig. 4). Since the intensity of peaks at near χ = 0° and near χ = ±90° are related to the edge-on and face-on orientation of crystallites, respectively,14 the fractions of the edge-on and face-on orientations of polymer crystals can be directly calculated from the intensity ratio (Fig. 4g). Another important feature is that the 3F polymer in blend has a stronger tendency to take face-on orientation than other two polymers in both the bulk and surface region of blend films, which contributes to higher SCLC hole mobility of the 3F polymer in the active layer of PSC.

When the morphologies of three active layers as observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) were compared, as shown in Fig. 5, the 3F and 4F polymers in the blends form narrower fibrils than the 2F polymer, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge generation, although all polymer blends develop an interconnected network with a nanoscale fibril structure. It has recently been reported that the fibril width is correlated with the solubility of a polymer and that narrower fibrils are obtained by decreasing the solubility of a polymer.15a,b Particularly, Liu et al.15c have shown that the size of phase separation in polymer:PCBM blend decreases with increasing fluorine content of a conjugated polymer. Hence, the reason for narrower fibril formation of 3F and 4F polymers in the blend is probably because more fluorine atoms in conjugated polymers decrease the solubility of polymers in the organic solvent and thereby reduce the fibril size.

Conclusions
We have presented the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of three fluorinated D–A polymers consisting of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene and BT, where the fluorine content in the polymer is controlled by fluorination on the BT unit. It has been observed that the introduction of fluorine atoms causes multiple effects on the properties of conjugated polymers including a stronger vibronic shoulder in the UV-vis absorption spectrum and lowering frontier energy levels. In particular, the crystal properties of fluorinated polymers are strongly dependent upon the total number of fluorine substitution in the polymer: the π–π stacking distance decreases as the number of fluorine substitution on BT increases, affording the 4F polymer the highest FET hole mobility, whereas the polymer (3F) with mono-fluorination on BT exhibits a better photovoltaic performance than the polymers (2F and 4F) with non- and di-fluorination on BT, because the 3F polymer has a stronger tendency to take face-on orientation than the 2F and 4F polymers when blended with PC71BM, exhibiting the highest PCE of 9.14%. Our results have clearly demonstrated that the optoelectrical and photovoltaic properties of fluorinated conjugated polymers can be controlled by varying the amount of fluorine substituted on the conjugated polymer backbone, and therefore the optimum amount of fluorine substitution should be considered for achieving high performance PSCs.

Broader context
Development of new semi-conducting polymers plays a critical role in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Among various approaches to develop high performance conjugated polymers, the introduction of fluorine atoms on alternating conjugated copolymers composed of electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units has recently been considered as a promising approach because of its unique advantages including energy level lowering without sacrifice of bandgaps and improvement of molecular ordering by induced dipole along the C–F bond, and no steric hindrance due to the small size of fluorine atoms. However, the fluorination can also lead to negative effects on polymer properties such as low solubility in the organic solvent, an unsuitable energy level for exciton separation and charge transport, and large aggregation of polymer chains in the active layer of PSCs. Hence, the degree of fluorination should be optimized to achieve a high efficiency of PSCs. In this work, we synthesized three fluorinated polymers, consisting of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with different numbers of fluorine substitution, and their optoelectrical, photophysical and photovoltaic properties are compared to find the optimum fluorination. Among the three fluorinated polymers, the polymer with mono-fluorinated BT exhibit an outstanding device performance with a superior PCE of 9.14%.
