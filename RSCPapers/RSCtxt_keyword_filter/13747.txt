    , Accepted 13th March 2022First published on 14th March 2022AbstractResearch in the field of nano-optics is advancing by leaps and bounds, among which near-infrared (NIR) light optics have attracted much attention. NIR light has a longer wavelength than visible light, such that it can avoid shielding caused by biological tissues. This advantage has driven its importance and practicality in human treatment applications and has attracted significant attention from researchers in academia and industry. In the broad spectrum of infrared light wavelengths, the most noticeable ones are the NIR biological window I of 700–900 nm and window II of 1000–1700 nm. Luminescent materials can effectively cover the NIR biological window with different doping strategies. These doped elements are mostly transition elements with multielectron orbitals. Several nanomaterials based on narrow-spectrum lanthanides have been developed to correspond to biological applications of different wavelengths. However, this review explicitly introduces the absorption and reflection/luminescence interactions between NIR light and biological tissues independently. Unlike the adjustment of the wavelength of the lanthanide series, this review analyzes the NIR optical properties of the fourth-period element ions in transition elements (such as Cr3+ and Ni2+). These elements have a broadband wavelength of NIR light emission and higher quantum efficiency, corresponding to the absorption and emission spectrum and photobiological absorption of different NIR windows for therapeutic diagnosis. Finally, this review lists and explores other broadband NIR phosphors and has tried to discover the possibility of non-invasive precision medicine in the future.
1. Introduction
Nanotechnology has developed rapidly in recent years. With the advancement of nanotechnology, the research level in optics has improved significantly, the most representative of the development and application of near-infrared (NIR) light nanophosphors.1–3 Since nanophosphors are very small in size and affected by the local quantum effect, their properties are very different from those of gigantic crystals.4–6 Taking a semiconductor nanophosphor as an example, when the crystal size is reduced to a few nanometers, the material properties (such as the band structure, crystal surface composition, etc.) changes with size; at the same time, when the fluorescence nanopowder is doped with different metal elements providing space for the transfer of transition electrons, a variety of different emission wavelengths can be produced through the photoluminescence process.7–9 IR is an electromagnetic wave between microwaves and visible light. According to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), IR can be classified into three subregions, including NIR (700–1700 nm), mid-infrared (MIR; 1700–3000 nm), and far-infrared (FIR; 3000–10000 nm).10–12 According to the literature, there are two transparent windows for living organisms in the NIR region, located at 700–900 nm (the first NIR light window, NIR-I) and 1000–1700 nm (the second NIR light window, NIR-II), providing good energy absorption.13 A low scattering can provide maximum tissue penetration and reduce autofluorescence. Scattering is a fundamental interaction between light and tissue in the visible–NIR band, also known as NIR-I.14–16 Therefore, the range of the optical window of biological tissue in this area is mainly limited by the absorption effect in the tissue (Fig. 1). The lower limitation of NIR-I is determined by blood absorption, where the upper boundary is water. NIR-I is widely used to assess skin tissue absorption, such as blood monitoring, in which blood samples are analyzed through different particles/molecules in the blood to reflect and absorb light of different wavelengths.17 NIR light with a 1000–1350 nm wavelength is NIR-II and has the potential as a biological window.18 In recent years, a new biological monitoring window has been continuously developed. Compared with NIR-I, blood and tissue absorb and scatter deeply at NIR-II, making it able to penetrate deeper into living tissues. High luminescence transmission and diffuse reflection capabilities can be used for real-time imaging to reduce the noise ratio.19
 Fig. 1  Bioimaging of nanophosphors at different penetration depths in tissues due to additional emission wavelengths. The light entering the tissue will be reflected or absorbed by the molecules in the tissue. The vertical arrow in the figure indicates the penetration depth, and curved arrows indicate fluorescence scattering. Curving and releasing the arrow vertically show the degree of reflection and luminescence. Compared with visible light and NIR-I nanophosphors, NIR-II nanophosphors exhibit the most negligible light scattering and the most profound penetration depth. They can transmit light through a diffuse reflection and luminescent glow to provide instrument detection signals. 
Therefore, the NIR-II material has tremendous advantages in biological detection and in vivo imaging.20 However, water molecules have a significant absorption effect in the infrared region above 1000 nm, leading to NIR-II being applied between organs and tissues.21 The absorption of the NIR light area of each organ is shown in Fig. 2, indicating that the NIR-II area also has high bioavailability.22 NIR light-emitting nanophosphor powder doped with different metal elements has many new physical properties and optical applications, and many researchers have provided new material compositions and application directions. In particular, research on materials based on lanthanide elements and on up/down-conversion nanoparticles has attracted the attention of many research teams.23–25 However, the use of lanthanides to adjust the electronic transitions will require sensitizer ions, such as Yb3+, to provide sufficient energy, which makes the light emission efficiency of this type of nanophosphor low; meanwhile, the emission wavelengths of lanthanides are narrow spectra, the half width of the spectrum falls at about 10–30 nm.26–28 Different proportions and multiple lanthanide elements must be doped to meet various infrared emission applications if different wavelengths are required.29–31 In NIR-I nanophosphors, the composition of the host material is mainly Xn(Al/Ga)(2n)O4n:Cr3+, such as ZnGa2O4:Cr3+, which is a typical NIR-I nanophosphor.32 Compared with NIR-I phosphors, the host material of NIR-II phosphors does not have a specific crystalline structure, and its composition can be like Sr1−xCaxTiO3:Ni2+, A3(PO4)(2):Mn5+ (A = Ba, Sr, Ca), Y3(Al/Ga)5O12:Ce3+,Cr3+… etc.33–35 These diverse host materials can build NIR-II nanophosphors.
 Fig. 2  Biological tissue optical windows. (A) Near-infrared windows refer to the wavelength range where the light penetration depth reaches a maximum in biological tissue, generally in the near-infrared wavelength range. (B) There are two physical transparent windows in the near-infrared light zone, located at 650–950 nm (the first NIR-I window) and 1000–1350 nm (the NIR-II window). NIR-I/II windows can achieve the best energy absorption and low scattering through the tissue, provide maximum tissue penetration and reduce autofluorescence. 
Therefore, this review focuses on the latest developments in the field of NIR nanophosphors doped with transition elements from the fourth period (such as Cr3+ and Ni2+) only. These elements have a broadband wavelength of near-infrared light emission, a higher quantum efficiency, correspond to the luminescence emission spectrum and photobiological absorption of different near-infrared windows, and are used for therapeutic diagnoses, achieving non-invasive precision medical treatment (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  The outlook of optical nano-phosphors used in biomedical applications in NIR-I and NIR-II windows from now to the future. The activator of NIR-I is mostly Cr3+; the activator of NIR-II is Ni2+, Cr4+, and Mn5+. Based on decades of optical application research, NIR-I and NIR-II window applications can be expected to involve fluorescence luminescence (FL) imaging, biosensing, multimode imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, drug scanning, photodynamic (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT), and imaging-guided surgery. 
2. Doping with fourth-period element ions in the near-infrared phosphor
The revolutionary application of nanotechnology by manipulating materials’ molecular structure and intrinsic properties provides enormous possibilities for contemporary science and industry.36–38 Most materials use fourth-period element ions since photoactive ions of elements are biased toward the micron-level process. Here we obtained phosphors that are doped to extreme detail and are nanosized. This branch of nanotechnology involves electronics, energy, biomedicine, environment, food, textiles, etc., and has the advantages of promoting functions and expanding limitations and capabilities in various fields.39–41
2.1 Cr3+-Doped NIR-I nanophosphors
In general, NIR light-emitting inorganic phosphors are compounds that constitute the two main elements of the host and the activator.42 The choice of the activator is critical in inorganic nanophosphors because it determines the target emission wavelength, while the host affects the performance and characteristics of the emission.35
The most commonly used activators for NIR-I emission are the transition metal element Cr3+ for NIR-I and Mn4+ for NIR-II. Different from rare earth elements, such as Yb3+, Er3+, and Nd3+, fourth-period transition metal elements as activators can provide a broader near-infrared spectrum for nanophosphors.43 Among the transition metal ions, Cr3+ is the most commonly used activator by researchers because spectral emission based on the crystal field strength has a more decisive electronic transition.44 Cr3+ ions can exhibit different emission spectra under different crystal field conditions. A strong crystal field strength will cause narrow-band NIR light emission. The narrow or sharp NIR distribution is caused by the 2E → 4A2 electron transition in the spin forbidden zone. A wider distribution of the NIR light spectrum can be obtained at a weak crystal field strength due to the energy step transition of 2E → 4A2 allowed by the electron spin.45 In contrast, if the crystal field strength is moderate, then the spectral distribution characteristics of these two combinations are achieved.46 On the other hand, selecting fluorescent nanophosphors with different crystal compositions as the host material can produce different wavelengths of NIR spectra even if they are doped with the same fourth-period transition element ions.47 In Table 1, we list several NIR-emitting phosphors that have been used in biological applications and use Cr3+ as the primary activator. Broadband NIR-I light has been widely used in cancer treatment in humans. Since Cr3+ has the advantage of less autofluorescence noise, we will discuss the application prospects of broadband NIR-I in biological tissue diagnosis and treatment in the next section.

2.2 Ni2+, Cr4+, and Mn5+-doped NIR-II nanophosphors
In general, NIR light-emitting inorganic phosphors are compounds that constitute the two main elements: the host and the activator.42 Conceptually, Rayleigh scattering (changing to −4) decreases as the wavelength increases; longer wavelengths are expected to have significantly smaller optical scattering coefficients.59 Therefore, NIR-II light has a higher tissue penetration depth and a higher image contrast than NIR-I, which is more suitable for in vivo research in human care applications. Both lanthanide ions and fourth-period transition metal ions can be used as activators for NIR-II-emitting phosphors. In most cases, the lanthanide ions Yb3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Ho3+, Pr3+, and Tm3+ follow the internal electronic transition (4f–4f) because the 4f electrons in the lanthanide ions have a more substantial effect on the externally filled 5d and 5p orbitals of shielding.60 Therefore, the NIR-II spectral distribution produced is very narrow or limited, restricting the versatility of biological applications.61 In contrast, nanophosphors with Ni2+, Mn5+, and Cr4+ transition metal ions as activators can have a wider spectral distribution and exhibit emission spectra that conform to NIR-II.62,63 As mentioned earlier, the sensitivity of the unfilled d-orbitals to the surrounding environment provides an opportunity to adjust the spectral characteristics of the obtained NIR-II through crystal field engineering methods.34 However, the currently available spectroscopy instruments are limited, and there are fewer reports on NIR-II nanophosphors than NIR-I.64Table 2 lists the nanophosphors reported for NIR-II light used in biological treatment. NIR-II nanophosphors have diffuse reflectance and luminescence emission spectra, which can be used for histological, biochemical, and functional information quantification together with traditional needle detection tests. Different NIR-II wavelengths of light will be scattered or absorbed according to the structure of various tissues (such as tumors and general epithelial tissues). The differences between the tissues can be distinguished in real time. The spectral distribution should be as comprehensive as possible to obtain the best scattering of various components in the tissue, usually at approximately 400–1600 nm. This phenomenon also promotes the better biological application of nanophosphor powder, dominated by transition elements in the fourth period. We will discuss the biological applications of these NIR-II phosphors in-depth in the next section.

3. NIR-I/II absorption for photobiomodulation theranostics
The most common biological application of NIR-I/II absorption is to improve the application of light energy by organisms through specific wavelengths of light, also known as photobiomodulation therapy or low-level laser/light therapy (LLLT).70 With the use of 450–1100 nm wavelengths to stimulate cell therapy, LLLT has a history of nearly 50 years, and there are still many new research papers and journals getting published. LLLT is a safe and advanced medical technology.71 Optical stimulation can activate cells, repair damaged cells, produce a protective film, and protect the body from the poison of free radicals and middle molecular substances to achieve antiaging effects.70 Dynamic near-infrared light has repair and healing functions, stimulating cell growth through unique narrow-band wavelengths to accelerate and repair wounds.72 LLLT is a safe, painless, and non-invasive process for animal cells or plant cells. It can induce or enhance physiological reactions, such as promoting local blood circulation, improving immune function, and promoting cell metabolism and proliferation in animal cells.73 For plant cells, a series of physiological changes can control the flowering period, improve withering conditions, and promote growth acceleration.70 The process of applying LLLT to organisms and regulating individual physiological changes is called photobiomodulation, which prolongs the life cycle of cells by stimulating the mitochondria (energy factories) of cells and generating extra energy after irradiating the cells with low-power light. This treatment is similar to plant cells relying on sunlight to produce energy through photosynthesis.74
Given that the energy output of these lamps during irradiation is in milliwatts, there is almost no risk of heat generation and scarring caused by scalds in clinical practice. Light can accelerate human blood circulation, enhance tissue repair, promote lymphatic drainage, and achieve a healthy balance because it can easily penetrate the skin without the need for media and produce thermal effects.75–78 Therefore, since the beginning of the 20th century, scientists and medical teams have invested many resources in optimizing light energy and improving the quality of human life. Studies have shown that light waves with a wavelength of 680–880 nm (in the range of red light to far-infrared light) emitted by LEDs can activate CCO in mitochondria and generate additional energy to accelerate the synthesis of DNA and RNA.79–81 Next, this section will focus on how NIR-I/II absorption is applied in animals and plants. In animal cell research, LLLT prolongs the life cycle of cells by stimulating the mitochondria (energy factories) of cells and generating extra energy after irradiating the cells with low-power light. Plants rely on sunlight to produce energy through photosynthesis. Light sources of specific wavelengths can provide a reasonable growth control for plants and use LLLT to improve plant growth. Given that the energy output of these LLLTs is in milliwatts, there are almost no side effects, such as burns caused by high fever, in clinical practice. Therefore, since the twentieth century, scientists and medical teams have invested in many NIR-I/II absorption LLLT research resources to optimize the energy of light and improve the quality of life of organisms.
3.1 Near-infrared window I
Near-infrared emission saturation (NIRES) nanoscopy was recently devised to achieve deep tissue super-resolution imaging. NIRES nanoscopy adopts the stimulated emission depletion (STED) approach but uses a single “doughnut”-like excitation beam to enable super-resolution imaging. Meanwhile, the fourth-period element dopant ions are carefully selected to ensure that both excitation and emission are in the NIR spectral region. The NIRES approach retains the same level of imaging resolution as STED microscopy and provides a remarkable light penetration depth and a simplified experimental setup. In 2018, Liu et al. demonstrated NIRES nanoscopy using ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ nanophosphors to realize single-particle imaging through a 93 μm thick liver tissue resolution of 50 nm. The 980 nm excitation laser (larger than 1 MW cm−2) was shaped like a “doughnut” beam to saturate the metastable level (3H4) of the Cr3+ ions, resulting in a bright NIR emission at 800 nm for detection.82 Compared with the 455 nm emission decaying to 11.3% after passing through the 93 μm thick tissue, the 800 nm emission preserved 38.7% of the initial intensity.

3.1.1 Efficient NIR-I for structured illumination microscopy (SIM). 
Structured illumination microscopy adopts spatially varying illumination to excite the labeled sample in the diffraction-limited region to overcome the diffraction limit.83 The excitation light exhibits typically periodic patterns consisting of standing waves of different orientations or phases.84 Under structured illumination, microscopy can detect increased spatial frequency that conveys extra information about the sample, giving a high resolution.85 Each of the obtained image snapshots comprises sample structure information and excitation patterns.86 Therefore, computational reconstruction is necessary to acquire the final sample structure by separating the different regions to their proper positions in the frequency space by scanning and rotating multiple snapshot patterns. Similar to STED microscopy, the saturation of NIR nanophosphors enables high image resolution.82 Compared with STED microscopy, one of the conspicuous merits of SIM is a fast scan speed because a focused depletion beam is not required in this system. In 2020, Liu et al. demonstrated NIR SIM using LiInGe2O6:Cr3+ nanophosphors as the luminescent probe. As seen in the results, under 975 nm, excitation NIR imaging at 800 nm was shown with a resolution below 131 nm and an imaging rate of 1 Hz.87 A high doping strategy was applied to design NIR nanophosphors: 4% for Cr3+ and 40% for Sn4+. The high Cr3+ concentration promoted cross-relaxation between the adjacent ions and enhanced the photoresponse's nonlinearity, which was critical to obtaining high resolution. The high Sn4+ concentration facilitated the absorption of excitation energy to compensate for the sacrifice of emission intensity due to concentration quenching in Cr3+ ions. In addition, the high brightness lowered the needed excitation power density to 4 kW cm−2, which effectively prevented the photothermal effect (Fig. 4). The nanomaterial LiInGe2O6:Cr3+ synthesized by the author can be compared with JCPDS card no. 26-1438 to determine its structure (Fig. 4A and B). In addition, Fig. 4C shows the refinement results based on the LiInGe2O6 crystal structure. In the LiInGe2O6 format, both Li+ and In3+ ions are coordinated by six O2− ions from [LiO6] and [InO6] octahedra. While Ge4+ ions are coordinated by four O2− and form [GeO4] tetrahedra, the [LiO6] octahedron is strongly distorted because the Li–O6 bond is elongated to 2.815 Å (Fig. 4F). Although [InO6] octahedra are more regular than [LiO6], considerable distortion can still lead to effective luminescence of Cr3+. The LiInGe2O6 structure consists of [GeO4] and [Li/InO6] layers. The two types of [GeO4] layers are alternately arranged along the a-axis, with [Li/InO6] interlayers inserted. Edge sharing [InO6] octahedra form a chain-like continuation of the c-direction connectivity, and isolated [LiO6] octahedron-connected [InO6] chains are shared on each side by edges (Fig. 4D). In the [GeO4] layer, the corner-sharing [GeO4] chain also extends along the c direction (Fig. 4E). The entire structure consists of these [In, LiO6] chains and the [GeO4] chains. It is understood that Cr3+ tends to occupy octahedral sites. By considering the valence and ionic radius of Li+ (CN = 6, 0.76 Å), In3+ (CN = 6, 0.8 Å), and Cr3+ (CN = 6, 0.615 Å), we believe that Cr3+ ions replace In3+ to form a single type of luminescence center. The author encapsulated the modified material into an LED structure and observed the hand signal through the NIR camera to see the structure of the internal blood vessels. This shows that the NIR-I luminescent material can be used for bioimaging and identification (Fig. 4G).

3.1.2 NIR-I-boosted for differential scanning calorimetry. 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has received popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and eco-friendly properties.88 Nevertheless, it faces severe problems that limit its power conversion efficiency due to the absorption mismatch between sensitizers in cells and the solar irradiation spectrum.89 An improvement in the light capture ability is necessary to boost the efficiency of DSC. Novel photoelectrode materials containing NIR nanophosphors are appropriate candidates for optimizing the performance of DSCs.90 The results represent a typical example reported by Dong et al. in 2016, describing the DSC performance enhancement (8% overall conversion efficiency and 19% increase in photocurrents) with an optimized photoelectrode SrGa12O19:Cr3+,Nd3+ nanoheterostructure. This hybrid promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by synergistically improving the utilization of near-infrared light and suppressing photoinduced charge recombination to prolong the lifetime of the excited electrons. A high NIR-I emission intensity is essential for improving the performance of PV devices. A protective shell coating is a viable way to enhance NIR emissions.91 In 2018, Wang et al. reported a class of Cr3+-doped Ca2YHf2Al3O12 core–shell NIR nanophosphors.92 Under 980 nm excitation, the regular dye (N719) in DSSCs showed 100% absorption of green emission and 80% red emission from the Cr3+ ions. The results indicate a 17.1% increase in the DSC efficiency due to boosted sub-bandgap NIR light utilization after coating with the oxyfluoride shell layer. Dye sensitization is another powerful method for enhancing upconversion. In 2017, Chen et al.62 reported organic dye (IR783)-sensitized LaGaO3:Cr3+,Ln3+ nanophosphors. IR 783 was attached to the surface of the NIR nanophosphors for broad spectral absorption from 670–860 nm, followed by energy transfer to Cd3+ ions and subsequently to Ln3+ ions for intense NIR conversion emission. The conversion emission peaks at 540/650 nm matched well with the absorption spectrum of regular light-absorbing dyes (N719) in DSC, which describes a power conversion efficiency enhancement of 13.1% by incorporating NIR nanophosphors into the TiO2 photoanode of the DSSC.93

3.2 Near-infrared window II
NIR-II light shows better penetration in the potential applications of through-skull brain imaging in vivo. The exact mechanism of the systemic response to photobiomodulation therapy remains unclear. However, upregulation of the immune cell function, the potential elevation of ATP levels in platelet mitochondria, and regulation of inflammatory cytokines have been investigated.94 Treatment with a whole-body LED array (1072 nm) can also improve the working memory and reduce Aβ aggregation in animal models.95 Whole-body LEDs and light pods with 660 and 850 nm LEDs for whole-body irradiation of humans are introduced.96 The novel LED device can benefit muscle performance, reduce muscle fatigue and pain, and help with weight loss joint exercises. This non-invasive technology can also effectively perform pretreatment and post-treatment of various brain diseases. The absorption of common substances in biological tissue, such as cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), fat, water, and collagen, is also located in the spectrum of NIR.
Moreover, NIR photobiomodulation achieved under the NIR-II window is primarily used for diagnostic purposes through optical property changes. The NIR-II window is typically used for treatment due to mitochondrial absorption. The ratio of normal-to-cancerous tissues begins to change in organs, reflecting changes in substances, such as hemoglobin, water, lipids, oxygen, and purple matter and presents optical performance with different characteristics in the NIR-II window as the disease progresses. The presentation of specific absorption and reflection in NIR windows of different types of tumors proves that NIR windows are highly and biologically applicable. Suitable NIR windows for diagnosis are different because of the various components of each organ. Using the NIR-II window, a previous study developed the technique involving tumor detection in the lungs, breast, liver, and colon. The needle is inserted into the human body during the biopsy of the tumor.97 The physician samples a small portion of cancer tissues to analyze cancer cells. Hence, the successful biopsy directly depends on the skill of the physician. At the same time, multiple insertions for sampling can increase the possibility of complications, specifically pneumothorax or hemorrhage in lung cancer patients.
The spectral range of NIR-II presents many major functional groups of substances (such as O–H, C–H, H–N, etc.) that have inherent absorption spectra, so their energy absorption or resonance is particularly intense in certain specific spectral ranges. For example, the most substantial resonance spectrum of the water molecule (H2O) is 958, 1409, 1460, 1910, and 2510 nm. Other wavelengths such as 938, 986, 994, 1030, 2305, and 2345 nm also absorb energy. When NIR-II passes through the material or tissue with different spectra, the water in the material or tissue changes the energy in a specific wavelength range, thus affecting the reflection ratio or transmission ratio of energy.98 Moisture detection can be performed using the relationship between absorption and reflection. The scattered or absorbed light based on the tissue structure helps the physician differentiate tumor and normal tissues in real time.99Fig. 5A and B show that the biological tissue's light absorption and scattering coefficients are different. This difference in absorption is evaluated from the influence on the water absorption band near 1450 nm and HbO2 and Hb bands near 540–580 nm (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D, the NIR-II phosphors (absorbing agents) activated with transition metal ions are a potential candidate for use as a photoacoustic light source.

Here, Park et al. used Ni2+-activated carbon dots (Ni-CDs) as an example for the demonstration.100 CDs are usually spherical particles less than 10 nm diameter, composed of sp2/sp3 carbon clusters with amorphous or nanocrystalline structures. It is found that the structure and physicochemical properties of CDs can be directionally changed by introducing different surface defects, heteroatom doping, and functional groups. NIR-II emission is only accountable for Ni2+ ions at the defect site. Ni-CDs show the NIR-II emission range of 1200–1600 nm centered at 1400 nm (Fig. 5E). After laser irradiation, the photoacoustic signal was reduced. To explore the feasibility of using Ni-CDs as a deep tissue photoacoustic contrast agent, overlaid PA/US images with Ni-CDs were acquired at various depths in chicken breast tissues (Fig. 5F). With strong absorption in the NIR-II window and higher imaging depth, the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging with Ni-CDs is feasible for preclinical studies and thus would facilitate further clinical investigations.
4. Diffuse reflection and luminescence emission in NIR-I/II biological applications
Optical imaging is a non-invasive image display technology that uses the unique optical properties of different radiation bands to analyze the characteristics and status of specific areas of cells or organisms and even the expression and distribution of particular molecules. Bio-optical imaging is widely used because of mature detection instruments, high sensitivity, high contrast, high resolution, intuitive imaging, fast imaging speed, and non-destructive detection. For example, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide anatomical images of various body parts.101–103 In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are high-sensitivity physiological images, but different detection methods have advantages and disadvantages.104–106 Traditional optical imaging has the following shortcomings that need to be improved: a low penetration depth in biological tissues and limited spatial resolution. For optical imaging of deep tissues at a high spatial resolution, the ability of the applied light to penetrate body tissues is a crucial parameter. When traditional organic fluorescent molecular dyes are excited by high-energy excitation light, they can emit light in different wavelength bands according to their other characteristics.107–109 High-energy excitation light is not only absorbed and scattered by water and biological tissues, but it also has a limited penetration depth and is luminous due to the risk of toxicity, photodegradation of organic probe molecules, and autofluorescence effects. The above problems have been developed in the near-infrared region, and the penetration depth and spatial resolution have been significantly improved. Currently, NIR diagnostic technology covers fluorescence spectrum imaging (FS) and near-infrared spectrum imaging (NIRS). The main application is to image the sensitivity of human peripheral tissues based on hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the microcirculation. The fluorescent dyes indocyanine green and NIRS are widely used in cerebrovascular and brain imaging, electrographic research, and other cancer-assisted diagnoses and surgeries.110 NIRS measures the infrared difference between the target and the background to obtain images with different concentration gradients. The wavelength range of the instrument is generally 0.78–2.0 microns. The light emitted penetrates the body and is not easily absorbed by water and hemoglobin.
4.1 Near-infrared window I
Biological tissue optical window I (or NIR I, treatment window I) refers to the wavelength range where the penetration depth of light reaches the maximum in biological tissue, generally in the NIR wavelength range of 700–900 nm. In the visible to NIR band, scattering is the most basic form of interaction between light and tissue, causing light to diffuse rapidly during propagation. Since scattering increases the propagation distance of photons in the tissue, the probability of photons being absorbed by the tissue also increases.111 The scattering effect varies little with the wavelength. Therefore, the range of the optical window of biological tissues is mainly limited by absorption. Blood absorption determines the lower limit (the short-wavelength end), whereas the upper limit (the long-wavelength end) is determined by water absorption. For applications such as optical imaging and photothermal therapy, choosing a suitable light source within the wavelength range of the visual window is of great significance for improving the imaging (treatment) efficiency, increasing the penetration depth, and reducing photoinduced tissue damage. The absorption coefficient (μα) refers to the photon's probability of passing through a unit distance. Different tissue components have different μα values; simultaneously, this is also a function of wavelength. In addition, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) is also an important parameter used to measure the absorption properties of tissues, which can be obtained from calculations. The blood contains two forms of hemoglobin: oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) binds to oxygen molecules, while deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) does not bind to oxygen molecules.112
The normalized absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin are located at 420 nm and 580 nm, respectively. Hb's maximum and second-largest molar extinction coefficient peaks are reached above 580 nm. The extinction decreases with an increasing wavelength; HbO2 shows a similar trend, except at 410 nm. The most prominent extinction peak is reached at 550 nm and 600 nm, and the second-largest extinction peak is reached at 550 nm and 600 nm. At wavelengths above 600 nm, the molar extinction coefficient of HbO2 decreases more quickly than that of Hb.113 Except for HbO2 and Hb, water has strong absorption in the NIR region. Considering that the high proportion of water in the tissue will affect the application, water has become one of the critical components affecting the optical penetration of the tissue. The absorption spectrum of water is in the range of 250–1000 nm.114 NIR I has great application value in diagnosis, mainly due to its completely non-invasive, non-destructive, and non-ionizing radiation and its ability to display various chemical components in the tissue, thereby providing useful functional information. Hamblin et al. reported changes in the brain's optical properties based on the diffusion NIR I model, which reflects the changes in the chromophore content and the brain structure during heatstroke. The reported technology is simple, inexpensive, and easy to implement for temperature monitoring in clinical and laboratory environments in the future.115 NIR light imaging devices can generally be divided into time-resolved devices and frequency-domain modulation devices.
Lung cancer cases in Taiwan topped second in Asia. A first-line targeted drug named Afatinib (AFT) can effectively inhibit non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth and migration. Chan et al. wanted to increase its functions’ power and find a better way to monitor any possible spread early on. This research work developed a nanomaterial that would shine in the dark and carry the AFT drug.116 Furthermore, they installed a tiny DNA segment (MAGE-A3 aptamer, MAp) in this nanomaterial. The final product is similar to a cruise missile installed with an autopilot function; it carries the drug all the way directly to the targeted lung cancer cells and then releases the drug to execute the inhibition task. This nanomaterial also has an extended illuminating effect; therefore, scientists could trace the movement of cancer cells over time. In their study, persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNs) were chosen due to their nature of continuous illumination once triggered by ultraviolet light for tracing cancer cells (Fig. 6). An SH-modified aptamer, MAp, connected AFT-PLN and formed AFT-PLN@MAp by a disulfide bond (Fig. 6A). The original MSN was approximately 50 nm and had a distinct pore structure (Fig. 6B).

After sintering at a high temperature, the holes grew into a dark-colored ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS) core. Calcination was performed at 1000 °C to make the PLNs. From the TEM image shown in Fig. 6C, ZGOCS nanoparticles (dark spots) can be efficiently distributed in the nanoscale pores of the MSN (ZGOCS@MSN, also named PLNs). Here, the MSNs were loaded with ZGOCS to generate PLNs. NIR luminescence imaging was then proposed and successfully applied. The structure of AFT-PLN@Map was coated with a Pt layer and examined by SEM in detail under a 5 kV electron beam (Fig. 6D). Referring to previous research, Sn4+ doping is beneficial for improving the luminous efficiency and lifetime of PLNs. The adjacent energy levels of Sn4+ and Cr3+ will form electron traps, storing high-energy electrons for a longer time in the excited state. The extra energy storage space also improves the luminous efficiency of PLNs. In Fig. 6E, it can be seen that ZGOCS@MSNs have a better photon content and can be detected for up to approximately 10 h under the IVIS CCD system. According to the experimental results, AFT@PLN-MAp successfully suppressed in situ lung adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis to develop into actual clinical therapy regimens to treat advanced lung cancer patients.
After irradiation with a UV flashlight source, the NIR persistent luminescence signal was repeatedly observed in the mouse's lung that matched with the tumor site with AFT-PLN (the IT treatment process is shown in Fig. 6F). In the following development, Shi et al. optimized the 808 nm excitation by applying a Bessel–Laguerre–Gaussian beam to alleviate light absorption and scatter in high cell density cancer spheroids.47 They reported a novel mSiO2@Gd3Ga5O12:Cr3+,Nd3+ (mSiO2@GGO) as a multifunctional nanoplatform for multimodal imaging and cancer therapy. The results demonstrate 55.9 μm mapping inside a spheroid with a resolution of 98 nm by adjusting the excitation beam to minimize both the excitation and emission light.83 The PL-PLE analysis material has high-energy luminescence in NIR-I (Fig. 6G). Changes in the mouse image can be observed through the in vivo imaging system (IVIS, Fig. 6H). The nanomaterial can even emit light for a long time (up to one hour, Fig. 6I) and test the fluorescence lifetime of its photons through a femtosecond laser.117 Even if it is blocked by tissue, the IVIS bioimaging system can still detect its light source signal (Fig. 6J).
4.2 Near-infrared window II
NIR-II indicates that the NIR range between 1000 and 1700 nm has the advantages of a considerable penetration depth, a low background noise, and a high maximum allowable radiation energy, conducive to high-resolution imaging of deep tissues.118 These advantages give NIR-II the function of photoacoustic imaging compared with window I. Acoustic imaging diffusion is an emerging composite imaging technology that combines a high optical imaging sensitivity, a significant penetration depth, and a high imaging resolution of acoustical imaging. It has broad application prospects in biological imaging and has developed rapidly in recent years. Ultrasonic diffuse waves are generated by irradiating the imaging object with a laser to realize imaging.12 The NIR-II exogenous photoacoustic imaging contrast agent is an essential condition for learning deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging, and it has received extensive attention from researchers in recent years.119 Liu et al. combined NIR-II Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ fluorophores and achieved excellent imaging performance in the NIR-II area, with a penetration depth of 3 cm and a spatial resolution lower than 10 microns.120 A multiphoton microscope with a NIR contrast agent can eliminate the background autofluorescence. Multicolor NIR technology has also obtained optimized data through windows I and II. It can be seen from this research that the long-term goal is to combine and integrate advanced NIR fluorescence and beam shaping based on microscopy technology (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A shows the photoluminescence excitation and NIR-II Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ phosphor at room temperature. Unlike many Ni2+ activated luminescent materials, in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, there is only one luminescence transition in the SWIR region of Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+. Under a wide range of excitation, from ultraviolet to near-infrared, the Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ phosphor exhibits a wide range of SWIR emission bands, ranging from ≈1050 to ≈1600 nm and peaks at ≈1290 nm. Fig. 7B shows the continuous light emission Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ phosphor monitoring attenuation curve after irradiation with 300 nm ultraviolet light for 20 minutes at a wavelength of 1290 nm. As shown in Fig. 7C, Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ was irradiated with monochromatic light to obtain luminescence for 5 minutes with light between 280 and 650 nm in steps of 10 nm (a xenon arc lamp in the spectrophotometer). The attenuation curve monitors the 1290 nm emission. The blue dotted line curve in Fig. 7D is a typical TL curve. For the measurement, the sample was irradiated with 300 nm light for 20 minutes in advance to fill the trap. For the Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ phosphor, the monitoring emission wavelength is 1290 nm, and the black body radiation starts affecting at ≈375 K and becomes significant as the temperature increases (Fig. 7E). Another short-term research direction will be fluorescence imaging. Photoacoustic imaging can extend the imaging depth to 5 cm among the fluorescence imaging techniques. Moreover, Gschwend et al. designed water-dispersible barium phosphate nanoparticles doped with Mn5+ (Ba3(PO4)2:Mn5+) prepared by scalable, continuous, and sterile flame aerosol technology and explored them as fluorescent contrast agents with temperature-sensitive peak emission in the NIR-II windowat 1190 nm.64 The NIR-II window with high-temperature sensitivity shows animal tissue of increasing thickness.

Several NIR fluorophores used in the research can also be used in this novel technology, which will achieve significant progress, such as an excellent spatial and temporal resolution of in vivo fluorescence bioimaging technology and deeper detection penetration. NIR-II can fully improve the spatiotemporal resolution (approximately 20 ms and 25 mm) and penetration depth (up to 3 cm) of imaging to achieve better image quality and a letter-to-back ratio than NIR-I. Dang et al. designed a NIR-II imaging system named “using NIR spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance imaging to detect luminescent probes” (DOLPHIN), which can solve these challenges. NIR-I. DOLPHIN can achieve the following goals: (i) resolve probes through tissue phantoms up to 8 cm long; (ii) identify the spectrum and scattering characteristics of tissues without prior background or autofluorescence knowledge; and (iii) whole animal's 3D reconstruction. It is worth noting that we demonstrated the non-invasive real-time tracking of 0.1 mm fluorophores through the gastrointestinal tract of living mice, which exceeds the detection limit of current imaging methods.121 In general, the development and design of NIR-II fluorescent materials should consider the following points. First, the most critical issue is that poor biocompatibility and potential biological toxicity may change human physiological functions and harm human health. Second, the shortcomings of NIR-II fluorescent materials, such as a low fluorescence quantum yield, a short emission wavelength, and cumbersome and time-consuming chemical synthesis processes, will hinder the industrial development of NIR-II fluorescent materials. Finally, besides eliminating the obstacles mentioned earlier through reasonable strategies, the evaluation and testing of animal models with materials’ activity, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics are crucial for further developing NIR-II fluorescence imaging.46
5. Conclusions, perspectives, and outlook
In this review, we summarized the basic properties of nanophosphors, emphasizing the advantages of NIR nanophosphors in biomedical applications. Despite the superior performance of nanophosphors, such as tunable emission and excellent stability, they face severe challenges. First, the bottleneck faced by NIR nanophosphor is the toxicity of their composition, or what might be called the “environmental friendliness” of the material for biological applications. Nanophosphors can enter the ecosystem by combining with organic substances or other toxic substances in nature to make them more stable. When they further enter into the organism, the nanoparticle in the organism may enter the cell through the holes in the cell membrane, affecting the function of the cells and then affecting the organism. Another problem is related to the wavelength choice of excitation for the nanophosphors. The excitation light source is in the range of UV-visible, which cannot penetrate deep tissue and is a big challenge. Consequently, the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and organisms may have unpredictable results. Despite the above challenges, the design of incorporating nanophosphors into biological applications is like opening an avenue for intelligent therapy. With this type of “interactive design”, some sparks will be ignited in different research fields, promoting the integration of cross-field research.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Bioimaging of nanophosphors at different penetration depths in tissues due to additional emission wavelengths. The light entering the tissue will be reflected or absorbed by the molecules in the tissue. The vertical arrow in the figure indicates the penetration depth, and curved arrows indicate fluorescence scattering. Curving and releasing the arrow vertically show the degree of reflection and luminescence. Compared with visible light and NIR-I nanophosphors, NIR-II nanophosphors exhibit the most negligible light scattering and the most profound penetration depth. They can transmit light through a diffuse reflection and luminescent glow to provide instrument detection signals.	 

 	Fig. 2  Biological tissue optical windows. (A) Near-infrared windows refer to the wavelength range where the light penetration depth reaches a maximum in biological tissue, generally in the near-infrared wavelength range. (B) There are two physical transparent windows in the near-infrared light zone, located at 650–950 nm (the first NIR-I window) and 1000–1350 nm (the NIR-II window). NIR-I/II windows can achieve the best energy absorption and low scattering through the tissue, provide maximum tissue penetration and reduce autofluorescence.	 

 	Fig. 3  The outlook of optical nano-phosphors used in biomedical applications in NIR-I and NIR-II windows from now to the future. The activator of NIR-I is mostly Cr3+; the activator of NIR-II is Ni2+, Cr4+, and Mn5+. Based on decades of optical application research, NIR-I and NIR-II window applications can be expected to involve fluorescence luminescence (FL) imaging, biosensing, multimode imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, drug scanning, photodynamic (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT), and imaging-guided surgery.
