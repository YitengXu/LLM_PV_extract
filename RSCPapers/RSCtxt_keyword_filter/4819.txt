    , Accepted 28th July 2022First published on 29th July 2022AbstractAn effective electron transport layer (ETL) plays a pivotal role in suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface as well as promoting perovskite crystallization to facilitate electron extraction in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a functional polymer, poly(amidoamine) (PM) dendrimer, is introduced to rationalize the morphology and electrical performance of SnO2 nanocrystals to construct an SnO2 charge transfer layer. PM offers an even SnO2 colloidal dispersion with a particle-size distribution of ∼10 nm, which prevents the agglomeration of nanocrystals significantly. The polymer-complexed SnO2 provides a uniform and dense ETL film without island-like agglomeration, yielding a large conductive layer superior to that of the control. Equally important, the wettability-improved SnO2 ETL with PM modification produces a high-quality perovskite film with larger grain size, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the champion n-i-p PSC of up to 22.93% with negligible hysteresis. Noticeably, the device based on SnO2-PM maintained 71% of its initial PCE (only 49% for the control device) after storing in the ambient environment for 45 days (relative humidity of 30%–80%) without packaging.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been pursued extensively because of their excellent photoelectric properties, such as their high carrier mobility, long carrier length/lifetime, and tunable bandgaps.1–4 Many excellent perovskite optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, have been reported to boost the deployment of perovskite materials.5–9 Among them, perovskite solar cells are candidates to replace classical crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells due to their attractive photoelectric properties and high operation windows.10–13 Over slightly more than a decade, their certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has surged to 25.7%, approaching the efficiency limitation of PSCs.14,15 In the primary stage of PSC research, mesoporous TiO2 was deposited as an electron transport layer (ETL) to construct an n-i-p solar device.16 However, the sintering process with high temperature (>450 °C) is a disadvantage in the deployment of PSCs in flexible and series devices.17,18 In addition, TiO2 exhibits intrinsic high photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation, which decomposes the perovskite at the interface, leading to long-term stability issues in PSCs.19 In this regard, high-quality low-temperature (≤150 °C) ETLs have been brought about by researchers as a potential substitute for mesoporous TiO2 in planar n-i-p PSCs. Among the various candidate electron transport materials, SnO2 deposited at low temperature has the advantages of high optical transmittance, resistance to UV light and excellent electron mobility, providing a good electronic transfer material for PSCs.20–23 Recently, champion PCEs of 25.7% and 25.3% were obtained with the SnO2 ETL substrate, highlighting the potential deployment of SnO2 nanoparticles in perovskite solar devices.
However, the SnO2 ETL mismatches with the perovskite absorption layer due to the much lower electron mobility, resulting in charge accumulation at the SnO2/perovskite interface with serious hysteresis.24–27 To eliminate this impediment in the charge accumulation, researchers have begun paying attention to SnO2 precursor engineering and modification, such as functional molecular modification and chemical doping, to improve the quality of the SnO2 ETL. The ionic dopants of Li+, Mg2+, and Nb3+ in SnO2 have been studied in recent years. It has been found that the electron mobility increases and hysteresis is thereby suppressed significantly.28–30 Additionally, Rong and Li et al. introduced a functional molecule with a heparin potassium mixed SnO2 colloid to improve the compactness and wettability of the SnO2 layer, yielding a good coverage of the perovskite film on the ETL.31 Zhu et al. treated the SnO2 surface with KCl to passivate the negative charge defects at the interface, resulting in VOC enhancement.32 Yang et al. introduced self-assembled monolayers with carbonyl groups on SnO2 films to categorize chemical interactions between the groups and perovskite layers. It has been observed that the enhanced photovoltaic performance is due to chemical interaction between the functional groups and perovskite traps, which can remarkably reduce the traps and promote interfacial charge transfer.33 In parallel, some reports highlight the deployment of functional polymers as surfactant agents for SnO2 precursors. The results show that the surface properties of the SnO2 substrate layer have an influence on the morphology of the perovskite films, which outlines the conformity of PSC performance.34–36 Multiple evidences indicate that the grain boundaries in the perovskite can evolve into nonradiative recombination regions due to the existence of charge capture recombination centers. Considering these issues, it is crucial to proceed with a feasible approach for preparing high-performance SnO2 ETLs and thus disclose the recombination dynamics of photogenerated carriers at the interface. Suitable polymers are good potential candidates for adjusting the uniformity of the SnO2 electron transport layer. Considering the steric hindrance, water solubility and colloidal charge balance of polymers, polymers with hydrophilic groups are usually potential candidates.
Herein, in pursuit of the uniformity of the SnO2 ETL and its effect on the quality of the perovskite, the functional polymer PM was loaded into SnO2 colloid to prepare a composite ETL with excellent performance. The electron mobility of the PM-composited SnO2 ETL (labeled SnO2-PM) is much higher than that of the control SnO2 ETL. With the increase in electron mobility, the PSCs based on the SnO2-PM ETL show negligible J–V hysteresis due to the suppression of charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface. In addition, the morphology of SnO2-PM became smoother and the wettability was also improved. Consequently, the perovskite films with large grains spread across the whole SnO2 substrate layer, mitigating the nonradiative recombination losses at the interface. Adding PM to SnO2 can not only effectively eliminate the electron trap state and improve the electron mobility of ETL but also promote the crystallization of the perovskite and reduce nonradiative recombination. The planar n-i-p PSC device based on the SnO2-PM ETL presents a PCE of 22.93% with a high VOC of 1.17 V as well as prolonged stability and maximum power output.
Results and discussion
Semiconductor oxide nanoparticles easily agglomerate, especially at the nanoscale, due to the large specific surface area of the nanoparticles and the van der Waals force within the colloid.37,38 In order to manipulate the distribution of SnO2 particles in the dispersion in the form of small-sized particles, many strategies including formula engineering and doping have been adopted to stabilize SnO2 colloids to impart resistance to agglomeration. Typically, there are three methods to affect the uniform and stable suspension of nanoparticles in water, namely the electrostatic stability mechanism, steric hindrance stability mechanism, and electrical space stability mechanism. By adding an appropriate surfactant to segregate the particle surface with the same charge or adsorb a certain polymer material, it can prevent particle agglomeration. In this regard, PM as a surfactant is introduced to stabilize the SnO2 suspension in this work. Firstly, PM has a large steric hindrance, which can block the agglomeration between nanoparticles. More importantly, PM balances the charges between nanoparticles via interaction with the SnO2 nanoparticles in an equivalent charge with long-term stability.
Previous studies have shown that the electrostatic potential of nanoparticles in SnO2 colloid decreases with the increase in aging time. Consequently, agglomeration occurs when the electrostatic potential is not enough to support the dispersion of SnO2 nanoparticles.39 We stored the PM-modified SnO2 colloid at room temperature within 72 hours, wherein it remained as a clear and transparent solution. The change in the state (color or viscosity) could not be distinguished by the naked eye (Fig. S1†). On further increasing the aging temperature and keeping the colloid in an environment of 35 °C, we saw significant changes, and the colloid became turbid over 72 hours. As shown in Fig. S2,† the results indicate that the particles are obviously agglomerated. It should be noted that the experimental phenomenon is consistent with the observations of Rong and Li et al.31

Fig. 1a shows the color evolution of the control and the SnO2-PM colloid during aging. On comparison, the morphology of the SnO2 film (Fig. S3†) and the final device performance (Fig. S4,† corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices with different PM additive concentrations are listed in Table S1†), the optimal concentration of 4 mg mL−1 PM was determined to modify the SnO2 precursor. We proceeded with dynamic light scattering (DLS) to expound the effect of PM on the distribution of SnO2 particles in the colloid (Fig. 1b and c). For fresh SnO2 colloids, we observed triple Gaussian peaks with small-, medium- and large-size distributions. Small-sized clusters with ∼10 nm represent single SnO2 clusters, whereas most nanoparticles will aggregate to form medium-sized aggregates of about 100 nm with the strongest corresponding Gaussian distribution. These severe agglomerations have a negative impact on SnO2 nanocrystalline films. However, we can manipulate the strong Gaussian peak within the small and medium-sized region for the SnO2-PM colloid, which suggests that PM can significantly reduce the aggregation of the SnO2 suspension in the precursor. After aging at 35 °C for 72 hours, the main peak of the DLS curve in the control moved from 10 nm to 100 nm, indicating that the aggregation of SnO2 nanoparticles was intensified. The distribution of SnO2-PM shows almost no obvious change, indicating that PM maintains the colloid in a relatively stable state. Fig. 1d is presented to illustrate the dispersion effect of PM on the SnO2 nanoparticles. PM can block the binding of nanoparticles due to the large steric hindrance of the long chains in the polymer. Moreover, the terminal group of PM can interact with the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of SnO2 to decouple with these polar groups.

In order to study the effect of PM on the surface morphology of the SnO2 films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the ETL film were captured. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the control SnO2 film is composed of a large number of island-like regions, which is caused by the serious agglomeration of SnO2 nanocrystals. However, the surface of the SnO2 film with the addition of PM is uniform and flat with good coverage. The conformity of the ETL film is beneficial to providing better interfacial contact with the perovskite. In addition, the water contact angles of the two films were tested. As shown in Fig. 2c, the contact angles on the control and PM-modified SnO2 films were 32° and 17°, respectively, which obviously increase the wettability of the film. It has been reported that good wettability, i.e., low free energy on the substrate surface, can reduce the nucleation site of the perovskite precursor solution on the ETL surface, which is conducive to increasing the grain size of the perovskite.40 As shown in Fig. 2d, the two pieces of films have good light transmittance in the visible light wavelength range of 400–800 nm. By comparison, the transmittance of the SnO2-PM film increases slightly. This can be explained by the fact that PM reduces the light reflection caused by large particle agglomeration, causing the transmittance to increase slightly (350–500 nm), which is conducive to reducing the absorption loss.

The effect of PM on the conductivity of the SnO2 thin films was analyzed by electrical measurements. As shown in Fig. 3e, the dark current–voltage (I–V) curve confirmed that the ohmic conductivity of SnO2-PM was higher than that of the control. The enhancement of direct current conductivity can be attributed to the electron doping caused by the amino groups in PM.41 In interpreting the enhancement of SnO2 conductivity, the space charge limiting current (SCLC) of the electron-only devices was performed, as shown in Fig. 4f. The low bias region (linear J–V region) indicates ohmic response. With the voltage increase, the trap fills and the linear relationship is irrelevant. The trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) are 0.75 V and 0.52 V for SnO2 and SnO2-PM, respectively. The trap state density (Ntrap) can be determined according to formula (1). (1)where ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and SnO2 relative dielectric constant (ε = 12.5), and Ntrap and L are the trap state density and thickness of the ETL films, respectively.42 The trap state density of SnO2-PM is 2.86 × 1015 cm−3, which is less than that of the control (4.13 × 1015 cm−3), indicating that the introduction of PM reduces the defect states of the ETL.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to confirm the presence of PM in the SnO2-PM films (Fig. 2g). PM presents characteristic peaks at 1642 and 1555 cm−1, which are attributed to the amide (I) and amide (II) absorption peaks of the amide groups. For the SnO2 species, the characteristic peaks of SnO2 located at 759 cm−1 and 677 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching and vibration of the O–Sn–O bond, respectively. The featured peak at ∼920 cm−1 in the control SnO2 film is attributed to the stretching vibration of the O–O bond due to the surface adsorption of the O-dangling bond on SnO2. For SnO2-PM, the peaks of O–Sn–O shift to 763 cm−1, demonstrating that PM is present on SnO2.
To confirm the interaction between SnO2 and PM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further carried out. As shown in the full spectrum (Fig. 2h), the appearance of the N characteristic peak in the XPS spectrum confirmed the existence of PM in SnO2-PM. As shown in Fig. 2i, after adding PM, the feature peaks of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 with 494.42 eV and 486.02 eV of the original SnO2 shift to the positions of 494.04 and 485.51 eV with lower binding energy, respectively, indicating that there is an interaction between PM and SnO2. The addition of PM increases the density of the electron cloud around Sn. Understanding the bonding between PM and SnO2 can help us conclude the mechanism behind the stable dispersion of SnO2 nanocrystals.

Fig. 3a and b show the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of FAMA mixed cationic perovskite films deposited on the control and SnO2-PM ETLs, respectively. The statistical distribution histogram of these grain sizes is shown in Fig. S5.† The average grain sizes of the control and the SnO2-PM/perovskite are 784 and 962 nm, respectively. The perovskite films deposited on SnO2-PM present a more uniform and smoother surface, suggesting regulated grain/crystal orientation. Large grain size is preferable to a small grain boundary with reduced defects, and therefore, the SnO2-PM/perovskite films are expected to have better optical and physical properties. The growth of larger grains on the SnO2-PM ETL can be attributed to the modification of PM. The SnO2 surface with PM became flatter and had better wettability, which is more conducive to the preferential growth of the perovskite on the ETL. We further characterized the crystal structure of the film by XRD. As shown in Fig. 3c, the pristine and SnO2-PM perovskite films showed similar diffraction peaks at 14.05°, 19.92°, 24.37°, 28.42° and 35.53°, corresponding to the (110), (112), (202), (220), and (310) planes of the perovskite tetragonal phase, whereas the peak at 12.41° is attributed to the PbI2 grain. It should be pointed out that the strong PbI2 peak is related to the preparation method of the perovskite films. The perovskite prepared by the two-step method usually has a strong PbI2 peak, but the strong PbI2 peak does not affect the efficiency of the device. Although there is no obvious peak shift after modification, the SnO2-PM perovskite film shows a narrower peak width, as illustrated in Fig. S6.† The narrow full-width at half-maximum indicates that the perovskite has better crystallinity according to the Scherrer equation. The half-height width (β) is inversely proportional to the grain size (D) in the Scherrer equation D = 0.89λ/βcosθ, where λ represents the X-ray wavelength and θ denotes the diffraction angle. The average grain size for the SnO2-PM/perovskite is large, which is consistent with the results observed by SEM. Additionally, the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the perovskite films planted on SnO2-PM further indicates a slightly higher light absorption intensity than the control films, which is favorable to enhance the photocurrent of PSCs (Fig. 3d).
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) intensity attenuation were used to evaluate the charge dynamics behavior of the perovskite films. In the PL spectrum, the luminescence intensity of the perovskite films planted on SnO2 with PM modification decreased significantly, suggesting effective carrier transport between the ETL/perovskite interface. The TRPL intensity attenuation spectrum is fitted by the double exponential attenuation function as follows: (2)where y0 is the decay constant, A1 and A2 are the decay amplitudes, τ1 is the rapid decay time induced by the recombination of photogenerated carriers, and τ2 is the slow decay time determined by nonradiative recombination. As expected, the TRPL attenuation spectrum of the perovskite films grown on SnO2-PM showed a shorter fluorescence lifetime of 5.91 ns compared with the 31.09 ns of the control film (Table S2†). Rapid carrier quenching shows that PM-regulated SnO2 contributes to the rapid extraction of charge, which is a necessary factor for the increase in VOC and FF.
In the device with the geometry of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag, the effect of PM on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was studied. The structural diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of the device are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The typical J–V characteristics of the best cells in the control and PM-regulated samples are shown in Fig. 4c. The champion PCE of the control (reverse scan) was 21.01%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.18 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.13 V, and a filling factor (FF) of 76.9%. Notably, the champion efficiency of the SnO2-PM PSC (reverse scan) surges to 22.92%, with JSC of 24.41 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.17 V, and FF of 80.3%. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The increase in PCE is mainly due to the increase in FF and VOC, which is mainly attributed to PM regulation with an improvement of the ETL conductivity and ETL/perovskite interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, this approach effectively suppresses the hysteresis effect of the forward and reverse scanning of the J–V curve. Generally, interfacial traps, ion migration, and unbalanced charge transport are regarded as the main causes of hysteresis. We calculated the hysteresis index (HI) of the device according to the equation HI = (PCER − PCEF)/PCER × 100%, wherein the HI of the control and SnO2-PM devices are 4.95% and 1.61%, respectively. The significant reduction of the hysteresis phenomenon of the SnO2-PM PSC in this study is due to the introduction of PM, which effectively alleviates the carrier transport imbalance at the ETL/perovskite interface and the high-quality perovskite film with minimal defects. Fig. 4d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and the integrated JSC curve of the champion devices based on the SnO2 and SnO2-PM ETLs. The integrated JSC values of the PSCs based on SnO2 and SnO2-PM are 22.99 mA cm−2 and 23.59 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the measured values (J–V curve). The steady-state output power of the PSCs under VMPP (maximum power point) is a reliable index to evaluate the authentic performance of solar cells. By keeping the bias voltage at VMPP, the stable efficiencies of the SnO2 and SnO2-PM devices are 20.01% and 22.3%, respectively (Fig. 4e). Moreover, there is negligible efficiency decay over 180 s for the SnO2-PM cell. These results verify the improved performance and enhanced stability under working conditions of the SnO2-PM device.

The dependency between the VOC and light intensity can provide a key parameter for judging the mechanism of the recombination process in PSCs. We analyzed the values of VOC dependent on the light intensity range from 20 to 100 mW cm−2. As illustrated in Fig. 4f, the fitting curve between the VOC and light intensity shows that the VOC is directly proportional to the logarithm of light intensity, according to eqn (3): VOC = nkTln(I)/q(3)where n is the ideal factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the basic charge, and I is the illumination intensity. When the ideal factor n is 2, trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is suggested. The fitting result is 1 < n(SnO2-PM) < n(control) < 2. The ideal factor of SnO2-PM is 1.35, lower than that of the control (n = 1.79). The small slope of the SnO2-PM device indicates that the PM-doped ETL can effectively suppress trap-assisted recombination, which is mostly attributed to VOC enhancement. The slopes of the control and SnO2-PM devices are 1.79kT/q and 1.35kT/q, respectively. This result shows that trap-assisted recombination is effectively suppressed, which can be ascribed to the introduction of PM with large grains and few grain boundaries.
In order to further clarify the composite dynamic behavior, we tested the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSCs in the dark state. Fig. 4g shows the Nyquist plot in the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz under a bias voltage of 0.8 V. The arc in the high-frequency region is related to series resistance (RS), and that in the low-frequency region corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rrec). The fitting results are summarized in Table S3.† The Rrec of the control and SnO2-PM devices are 331 Ω and 586 Ω, respectively. Obviously, the device based on SnO2-PM ETL showed a larger Rrec than the control, suggesting that nonradiative charge recombination can be effectively suppressed, which is consistent with the above results. Fig. 4h shows that the PSCs with SnO2-PM have lower dark current density (Jdark) than the control. The low Jdark is due to the fact that the PM-regulated high-quality ETL with a high-quality perovskite layer inhibits current leakage. In order to verify the excellent charge transfer performance of the devices, we measured the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV), which provided the carrier transmission time. As shown in Fig. S7,† it is observed that the carrier transport time of the SnO2-PM-based PSC is lower than that of the control. A lower charge transfer time is beneficial to charge transfer as it reduces charge recombination. In addition, the TPV attenuation in Fig. S7b† shows that the carrier lifetime or recombination lifetime of the SnO2-PM PSC is longer than that of the control device. The longer τrec suggests the lower recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in the SnO2-PM devices.
More importantly, Fig. 4i shows the PCE distribution histogram of each group of 40 cells prepared on the SnO2 and SnO2-PM ETLs. The SnO2-PM-based PSC presented good reproducibility with a narrow distribution of PCE from 21.5% to 23%. However, the PCE distribution of the control device is between 17% and 21%. The efficiency and its reproducibility of the devices based on the SnO2-PM ETL are significantly increased, which reflects the uniform coverage and morphology of the SnO2 ETL and the perovskite layer, which is consistent with the excellent regulation effect of PM on the SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface.
Finally, we evaluated the long-term stability of the SnO2 and SnO2-PM-based PSCs without any encapsulation. In dry air with humidity below 10% (Fig. 5a), both groups of devices showed good stability. The efficiency attenuations of the control and SnO2-PM PSCs within 45 days were 5% and 9%, respectively. The stability of the devices placed in open air is more obvious (air relative humidity was 30%–80%). The SnO2-PM cell maintains 71% of the initial efficiency over 45 days, while the control cell only maintains 49%. We observed that the long-term stability of PSCs is strongly affected by the ETL/perovskite interface, which is in agreement with a previous report on the stability of n-i-p structure devices. The major deficiency in n-i-p devices originates from the accumulated electrons at the interface with water or oxygen penetration around the device. Therefore, the stability of n-i-p devices can be enhanced by improving the bonding between the SnO2 ETL and the perovskite interface. Particularly in the ambient environment, the SnO2-PM PSC showed significantly enhanced stability, indicating that the crystal quality and interface were improved significantly. The enhancement of the stability is mainly due to the improvement of the wettability of the ETL by PM modification, which improves the bonding ability of the ETL/perovskite interface, as well as the protective effect of PM on the perovskite at the interface.

Conclusions
In summary, we provide a low-cost, simple approach by loading a functional polymer PM into SnO2 colloidal ink to obtain a high-quality ETL. The SnO2-PM ETL exhibited a flat and uniform morphology, and hence improved electron mobility. Besides, the perovskite with large grains on the PM-modified ETL spreads across the whole perovskite active layer, which is beneficial to reducing the trap density and nonradiative recombination of perovskite films. Correspondingly, the n-i-p planar mixed cation perovskite solar cells based on the SnO2-PM ETL showed a champion efficiency of 22.93%, with an obviously enhanced VOC of 1.17 V. In comparison, the control cell showed an efficiency of 21.01% with a VOC of 1.13 V. More importantly, the stability of the device based on the PM-regulated SnO2 ETL has also been improved significantly. By introducing the functional polymer PM in SnO2 colloid, this work provides a novel avenue for advancing high-quality ETLs, showcasing the enormous potential of composited SnO2 ETLs in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.
