    , Accepted 16th April 2018First published on 1st May 2018AbstractThe efficiency of perovskite solar cells is critically affected by the charge traps in the perovskite layer. Herein, we studied the recombination and dissociation processes of photo-excited states in perovskite solar cells with different densities and depths of the trap states in the perovskite layer using magneto-photocurrent measurements. The devices with lower density of traps show higher power conversion efficiency and negative magneto-photocurrent, whereas devices with higher density of deep traps exhibit lower power conversion efficiency and positive magneto-photocurrent. As the strong spin orbital coupling is induced by heavy atoms (Pb, I) in the perovskite materials, the original photo-excited spin-singlets (φml=±1φ↑e↓h) will transform into spin-triplets (φml=0φ↑e↑h) through intersystem crossing. In particular, the spin-triplets and trap states play an important role in photovoltaic actions of perovskite solar cells. Depending upon the depth of the traps, the spin-triplets can de-trap shallow charge carrier traps and subsequently contribute to the photocurrent in the perovskite solar cell, while the spin-triplets will be destroyed with the deep charge carrier traps, giving rise to non-radiative recombination in the perovskite solar cell. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanism, by which the spin configuration of photo-excited states, trap density and depth of traps impact the recombination and dissociation processes of the photo-excited states in perovskite solar cells based on the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) system.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have attracted tremendous amount of research interest due to their excellent performance in photovoltaic devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have quickly enhanced from 3.9% to over 22.1%, showing great application prospects.1–8 This new class of materials has also showed outstanding optoelectric performance in light emitting diodes (LEDs),9–11 photodetectors12–15 and optically pumped lasers.16,17 Despite their rapid development, the underlying intriguing properties of the photo-excited states and charge recombination dynamics in perovskite materials are still unclear. To further enhance the PCE of PSCs, there is an urgent need to understand the limiting recombination mechanism of PSCs devices. Recently, by analyzing the diode ideality factor from the J–V characteristics and investigating the external quantum electroluminescence efficiency,20 researchers have reported that trap-assisted recombination was the dominant non-radiative recombination mechanism in PSCs18,19 Furthermore, optical measurements incorporating transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy as well as steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence have found that the recombination of photo-excited states in perovskite films is remarkably determined by the density of traps, photoexcitation intensity and environmental temperature.21–23 Non-radiative recombination via trap-assisted recombination is dominant at a low excitation intensity, leading to monomolecular behavior with a slope of 1 in the intensity dependence between PL and excitation. In addition, radiative recombination is a bimolecular behavior with a slope of 2 in the intensity dependence at a high excitation intensity.22–26 We should note that perovskite materials possess both orbital (L) and spin (S) momentum with a total momentum of J = L + S. Therefore, the wavefunction φJ for an electron–hole pair can be expressed as: φJ = φmlφms(1)where ml = +1, 0, −1 and ms = +1/2 and −1/2. The magnetic field generated by the electron orbital current can cause magnetic scattering of the electron spins. A strong SOC can cause spin flipping in the spin wavefunction and consequently convert the spin-singlet (φml=±1φ↑e↓h) into a spin-triplet (φml=0φ↑e↑h), leading to spin mixing in perovskite materials.27–30 As the spin-singlet and spin-triplet possess different dissociation rates and recombination rates, the spin configurations of electron–hole pairs may also play an important role in the dissociation and recombination processes of the photo-excited states in PSCs.
Measuring the magnetic field effects such as magneto-photocurrent (MPC), magneto-photoluminescence (MPL) and magneto-electroluminescence (MEL) has been widely applied as a powerful experimental tool to investigate the optic-electro conversion processes in organic optoelectronic devices.31–35
Although MPC, MPL and MEL have been recently observed in PSCs at room temperature,36,37 both positive and negative MPCs were reported by Zhang et al. and Hsiao et al. independently at almost the same time.36,37 The opposite polarity of the MPC suggests that more than one single spin-dependent process is probably involved in perovskite solar cells. Very recently, Li et al. demonstrated that the polarity of the MPC can be tuned between positive and negative values by adjusting the size of the perovskite crystal domain in the perovskite films.38 These experimental results indicate that the internal processes including the dissociation, recombination and diffusion of the photo-excited states are spin dependent. Therefore, MFE technology can also be used as an experimental tool to study the underlying photovoltaic actions in PSCs. In principle, owing to the strong spin orbital coupling of perovskite materials, a large number of photo-excited states will be converted from the original spin-singlet states into spin-triplet states through spin mixing. As spin-triplets have longer lifetime when compared with the spin-singlet states,36–38 a spin-triplet can encounter and recombine with a trapped charge during its diffusion process, which is referred to as triplet charge annihilation (TCA).39 Moreover, the TCA process is known as a spin-dependent process, in which an external magnetic field can modulate the TCA reaction rate, leading to the MPC. Thus, we are able to employ MPC to investigate the role of triplet states and traps in impacting the photovoltaic process in PSCs.
Herein, we fabricated PSC devices with the same ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3(Cl)/PCBM/PEI/Al architecture while varying the annealing temperature of the perovskite films. We found that the density and depth of the traps in the perovskite films were tunable by simply modifying the thermal annealing temperature. Furthermore, we correlated the observed negative and positive MPCs from these PSCs with different degrees of the trap density and depth of traps. Specifically, PSCs with low density of shallow traps in the perovskite film show higher PCEs and negative MPCs. In contrast, PSCs containing high density of deep traps in the perovskite film show lower PCEs and positive MPCs. Our experimental results show that the spin-triplet electron–hole pairs can de-trap the charge carriers in PSCs with shallow traps and dissociate into free charge carriers, eventually generating photocurrent, whereas for the PSCs with deep charge traps, the spin-triplet electron–hole pairs are destroyed, giving rise to non-radiative recombination.
Results and discussions

Fig. 1a shows the current–voltage characteristics of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the same device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3(Cl)/PCBM/PEI/Al while changing the annealing temperature of the perovskite layer. The device annealed at 90 °C achieved the highest PCE of 14.98% (Jsc: 18.57 mA cm−2, Voc: 1.09 V, FF: 0.74). Upon increasing the annealing temperature from 90 °C to 130 °C, the PCE gradually decreased to 7.88% and Jsc decreased from 18.58 mA cm−2 to 15.17 mA cm−2. In addition, the Voc was reduced from 1.09 V to 0.79 V. The measured Voc can be written using the expression shown below:40 (2)where Vmaxoc is the maximum voltage set by the Shockley–Queisser limit, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the charge of an electron and EQE is the radiative efficiency of the device. Ideally, photoexcited electrons and holes in the semiconductor will radiatively recombine by emitting photons. However, the non-radiative loss originates from the traps, defects or the device interface contact, leading to the inevitable loss in the Voc. Therefore, the large reduction in Voc can be attributed to the enhanced non-radiative recombination in the PSCs. A summary of the performance parameters observed for the PSCs devices are presented in Table 1. The histogram analysis of the photovoltaic parameters over 20 devices for each annealing condition is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The average values of the photovoltaic parameters and their standard deviations are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). We also observed that the devices annealed at 90 °C, 100 °C, and 110 °C showed negligible hysteresis, while the devices annealed at 120 °C, and 130 °C showed significant hysteresis. Due to its thermal instability, the perovskite may lose its halides and organic cations at elevated annealing temperature and subsequently result in the formation of different types of vacancies and defects. It has been reported that the perovskite layer can be partially decomposed during the annealing process even at a mild temperature of 100 °C.41–43 We propose that the reduced efficiency and significant hysteresis observed at high annealing temperature (120 °C and 130 °C) can be attributed to the high density of traps generated in the perovskite layers.44

Correspondingly, Fig. 1b shows the MPCs of PSCs annealed at different temperatures. The MPCs were measured under the excitation of a 405 nm continuous wave (CW) laser beam at a fixed power density of 60 mW cm−2. The MPC amplitude was defined by , where IB and I0 are the photocurrents under short circuit conduction with and without magnetic field. To confirm the origin of the MPC, a control device with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCBM/PEI/Ag architecture was fabricated. Negligible MPC was observed in the control device, indicating that the MPC is an intrinsic phenomenon derived from the perovskite films. It should be noted the PSC devices annealed at 90 °C, which exhibit the highest PCE, showed negative MPC. As the annealing temperature increased from 90 °C to 130 °C, the PCEs of PSC devices decreased from 14.98% to 8.72%, and the polarity of the MPCs observed for the PSC devices changed from negative to positive. The modification of MPC, particularly the change in the MPC polarity, suggests that different spin-dependent photovoltaic processes are involved in these PSCs annealed at different temperatures.
To gain the insight into the recombination process occurring in the perovskite films, the curves for the short circuit current density (Jsc) as a function of illumination intensity (I) were recorded, as depicted in Fig. 2a. The relationship between the Jsc and illumination intensity can be described using the equation below: Jsc ∝ Iα(3)
 Fig. 2  (a) Jsc of the PSC devices annealed at different temperatures plotted against light intensity on a logarithmic scale; α is the power law (equation: J ∝ Iα) fitting result of the data. (b) Time-resolved PL decay recorded at 775 nm for Quartz/Perovskite films annealing at different temperature fitted with a bi-exponential decay function; the grey lines are the fitting results. The energy fluence of the laser beam was 30 nJ cm−2. (c) PL spectra and (d) normalized steady-state PL spectra recorded for the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures; the perovskite films were directly deposited on quartz substrates. The samples were excited using the same laser beam at a wavelength of 532 nm. 
The power factor α, fitted using eqn (1), decreased from 0.9864 to 0.9016 upon increasing the annealing temperature of the perovskite films from 90 °C to 130 °C. In principle, both monomolecular and bimolecular recombination can occur in perovskite solar cells. Previous studies have shown that α = 1 indicates that trap-assisted recombination is the major recombination mechanism, while α < 1 implies that bimolecular recombination is significant. The decrease in the power factor suggests that trap-assisted recombination via charge trapping may become less significant and bimolecular recombination through mobile charge carriers becomes more pronounced upon increasing the annealing temperature. During the bimolecular recombination process, the electron–hole pairs are formed with a spin-singlet/spin-triplet ratio of 1:3.45 As a consequence, there are plenty of spin-triplet electron–hole pairs formed in the perovskite layers through bimolecular recombination. Furthermore, we should note that the perovskite materials possess a strong spin orbital coupling (SOC) induced by the heavy atom (Pb, I) effect. Subsequently, a large portion of the photo-excited states in perovskite films will be converted from spin-singlet to spin-triplet states due to strong SOC. As sufficient spin-triplet states exist in perovskite films, it was inevitable that the spin-triplet state related process will play an important role in the photovoltaic action of PSCs.
We also measured the PL lifetimes of the charge carriers in the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2b. The data were fitted using a bi-exponential decay function: y = y0 + A1e(−(x−x0)/τ1) + A2e(−(x−x0)/τ2)(4)where A1 and A2 are fractions of the two decay components, τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes responsible for the fast and slow recombination, respectively. It has been reported that fast decay τ1 is related to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination, while slow decay τ2 can be attributed to the radiative recombination inside the grains.46–51 The fitted lifetime values are reported in Table 2 and show that the fast decay lifetime decreased from 14.2 ns to 3.6 ns and the slow decay lifetime decreased from 54.5 ns to 22.7 ns with the gradual increase in annealing temperature from 90 °C to 130 °C. The shortened PL decay lifetimes observed for the perovskite films can be ascribed to the deteriorated film quality and higher trap density formed at an elevated annealing temperature. Upon increasing the annealing temperature above the optimal temperature of 90 °C, the perovskite films exhibited higher non-radiative recombination and lower radiative recombination.

Fig. 2c displays the PL spectra of the aforementioned perovskite films measured under the same excitation intensity. We note that the PL intensity of the perovskite films decreases drastically with the increase in the annealing temperature beyond 90 °C. This result indicates that more photogenerated electron–hole pairs or excitons are quenched via non-radiative recombination owing to more charge traps being formed in the film upon elevating the annealing temperature. This result coincides with the faster PL decay and reduced Jsc, as discussed earlier. Fig. 2d shows the normalized steady-state PL emission spectra of the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures. We observed that the peak of the emission spectra red shifted from 774 nm to 784 nm upon increasing the annealing temperature from 90 °C to 130 °C. Generally, the trap states introduce additional electronic states within the forbidden gap, thus broadening the band tail of the perovskite bulk, leading to a red shift in the PL peak.41 The continuous red-shift in the PL spectra indicates that the perovskite films annealed at higher temperature mostly consist of deeper traps.
To further explore the compositional and morphological changes in the perovskite films prepared at the different annealing temperatures, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope were carried out. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns recorded for the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures. All of the perovskite films showed distinct diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.4° and 31.9°, confirming the tetragonal phase of perovskite.52 In addition, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 12.6°, which is indicative of excess PbI2 in the perovskite films, gradually increases upon increasing the annealing temperature from 90 °C to 130 °C. This phenomenon indicates that the perovskite grains will partially decompose at higher temperatures consequently increase the trap density and produce deeper traps. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology and phase images of the perovskite films (shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2) demonstrate that the excess PbI2 was mostly distributed at the perovskite grain boundary. These results verified the previous indications from the time-resolved and steady-state PL measurements that a large number of traps are formed in the perovskite film due to the decomposition of perovskite and the depth of the traps will vary with the degree of decomposition in the perovskite.

Fig. 4a–e show the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures ranging from 90 °C to 130 °C. From these SEM images, we can see that the grain size of the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures were comparable with each other, but the compactness of the perovskite grain and film coverage were gradually reduced upon increasing the annealing temperature. The extent to which charge trapping occurs strongly depends on the perovskite film coverage. The perovskite films with less compact grains and poor film coverage will contain much higher density of traps, which is in accordance with previous analyses. Photogenerated charge carriers are more likely to recombine with the traps at the grain boundary. Previous studies combining photoluminescence (PL) and impedance spectroscopy have also found that severe trap-assisted recombination occurs in non-compact perovskite films; however, this recombination is effectively suppressed in compact perovskite films.19
 Fig. 4  (a–e) Top-view SEM images of the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures. 
Combined photoluminescence and structure studies verified that the perovskite films annealed above the optimized temperature of 90 °C will generate higher density of traps and deeper traps. Furthermore, the amplitude and polarity of the MPC can reveal the trap density and depth in perovskite films. These parameters, including the density of traps, depth of traps and spin configurations of the excited-states have a great impact on the recombination and dissociation dynamics of the photo-excited states in perovskite films.
In principle, there are two major channels to generate MPC. (1) An external magnetic field can change the population of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states through spin mixing. Due to the different dissociation rates of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet electron–hole pairs, the change in ratio of the spin-singlet to spin-triplet states essentially leads to the observable MPC. In particular, in perovskite materials with a strong spin orbital coupling (SOC), an external magnetic field can increase the population of the spin-triplet state, but decrease the population of the spin-singlet state via the enhanced spin mixing, leading to positive MPC.36,37 (2) A spin-triplet can react with a trapped charge carrier in organic or hybrid semiconductors, which is referred to as triplet-charge annihilation (TCA). The spin configuration of the electron–hole pairs can convert the spin-triplet state into a spin-singlet state by spin flipping from an adjacent charge [(↑↑) + ↓ → (↑↓) + ↑] or dissociate into free electrons or holes by Coulombic scattering of an adjacent charge [T + q → e + h + q].39 The TCA processes experience an internal spin interaction between the spin-triplet state and charge. Applying an external magnetic field can perturb the spin interaction and consequently decrease the TCA rate constant to finally generate MPC.
In perovskite films, there is sufficient amount of spin-triplet electron–hole pairs formed through the spin mixing to boost triplet related processes, such as the TCA. In general, the interaction of a triplet exciton with the trapped-charge (D) will form six intermediate pair states: doublet 2(T-D) and quartet 4(T-D). According to the spin conservation law, only the intermediate 2(T-D) pair can transform into S + D. An applied external magnetic field can reduce the TCA rate by inhibiting the transformation of the 4(T-D) pair to the 2(T-D) pair through Zeeman splitting.53,54 As shown in the schematic in Fig. 5f, there are two different outcomes for the TCA processes. Depending upon the trap depth of the perovskite film, these spin-triplet excited states can either de-trap or destroy the trapped charge carriers, mainly at the perovskite grain boundaries. As for the perovskite films comprising shallow traps, the spin triplet states can detrap the trapped charges through TCA and contribute to the photocurrent. In this case, the external magnetic field reduces the TCA rate, leading to a negative MPC. However, if the perovskite film consists of a large number of deep traps, the energy of the spin triplet states is not sufficient to de-trap the trapped charges. This eventually results in trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Thus, reducing the TCA rate will save more spin-triplet states that can dissociate into free charge carriers, resulting in a positive MPC. Therefore, we were able to observe positive MPC and negative MPC from perovskite films with shallow and deep traps, respectively. In our experiment, it is noteworthy that the amplitude and polarity of the MPCs can be tuned by controlling the annealing temperature used for the perovskite films. Since more than one spin dependent process is involved in the generation of photocurrent, as mentioned above, the final polarity of the MPC is determined by the synergetic contribution from positive and negative components. At an appropriate annealing temperature (90 °C and 100 °C), the perovskite films consist of a low number of defects and most of the defects are shallow traps. However, at higher annealing temperature (110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C), more deep traps are formed at the grain surfaces or grain boundaries due to the decomposition of the perovskite, which consequently enhance the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination, as previously evidenced by the corresponding shift in PL emission peak and shortened PL lifetime. Correspondingly, we observed that the polarity of MPC gradually changes from negative to positive at different annealing temperatures, as shown in Fig. 1b and 5a–e.
 Fig. 5  (a–e) MPCs measured under different excitation intensities from a 405 nm CW laser for the PSCs annealed at different temperatures. (f) Schematic illustration of the annihilation mechanisms observed for the charge traps and spin-triplet states in perovskite films. 
We further confirmed that the depth of the trap states is the main reason for the different outcomes of the interaction of the spin-triplet and trap states. Fig. 5a–e demonstrate the MPCs under different photoexcitation intensity. The amplitude of the MPC gradually increases on increasing the photoexcitation energy from 15 mW cm−2 to 257 mW cm−2. However, the polarities of the MPCs remain unchanged. Clearly, higher photoexcitation intensity will generate higher density of triplet electron–hole pairs and enhance the TCA process in the perovskite layer, leading to the large amplitude in the MPCs. These results indicate that the variation in the trap and charge density has a notable influence on the amplitudes of the MPCs, but negligible influence on the polarities of the MPCs. Instead, we believe that the trap depth should be the main reason to determine whether the interaction of spin-triplet with trap states is a beneficial or non-useful photovoltaic process.
Experimental
Device fabrication
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2, PbCl2 and CH3NH3I in a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone (GBL):dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3) with concentrations of 1.25 M, 0.15 M and 1.3 M respectively. PbI2, PbCl2 and CH3NH3I were purchased from Xi’an p-OLED Inc. ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. PEDOT:PSS (4083 Heraeus) was spin-coated onto the oxygen plasm-treated ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 120 °C in air for 30 min. The perovskite precursor was then deposited onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 15 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s. About 35 s after initiation of the spin-coating process, chlorobenzene (400 μL) was poured onto the substrates quickly, followed by annealing the film at different preset temperatures (ranging from 90 °C to 130 °C) for 10 min. Subsequently, the PCBM (25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin coated onto the perovskite films with a thickness of about 60 nm at 2000 rpm for 45 s. After drying for 0.5 h, a poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) layer was spin coated on top of the film with thickness of several nanometers at 5000 rpm for 60 s from an isopropanol solution (0.1 wt%). Finally, the aluminum (Al) electrodes were thermally deposited with a film thickness of 100 nm under vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr to fabricate the perovskite solar cells with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/PEI/Al architecture.
Characterizations and measurements
The J–V characteristics were measured under illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The magneto-photocurrent signals were recorded by measuring the short-circuit current of the PSCs as a function of the magnetic field under excitation from a CW 405 nm laser. The PL spectra and lifetimes of the perovskite films were measured on an Edinburgh fluorescence spectrometer (FLSP920). The X-ray diffraction data were obtained from the perovskite films deposited on a ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate using a Philips diffractometer (X’pert PRO MRD). The top-view SEM images of the perovskite films were measured using a FEI Quanta 3D FEG-FIB system.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that PSCs with shallow trap states in the perovskite layers showed higher efficiency and negative MPCs. In contrast, PSCs with deep trap states showed lower efficiency and positive MPCs. The interaction of the spin-triplet states with the trap states is an important photovoltaic process in perovskite solar cells. The spin-triplet electron–hole pairs with longer lifetimes when compared with the spin-singlet electron–hole pairs are more likely to encounter the trap states and de-trap the shallow trap states, eventually contributing to the photocurrent. However, the destruction of the spin-triplet electron–hole pairs with the deep trap states is a non-useful photovoltaic process. Our MPC studies based on PSC devices reveal the substantial role of the spin-triplet and trap states in the recombination and dissociation processes of PSCs based on the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) system.
