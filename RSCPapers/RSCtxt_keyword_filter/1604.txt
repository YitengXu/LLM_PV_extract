    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 4th June 2019AbstractIn this work, we report the synthesis of triphenylamine based D–π-extended–A hexylthiophene functionalized MY-102 dye and its solar power conversion efficiency improvement in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This dye was synthesized by Wittig, Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions. The synthesized dye shows higher absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficient (480 nm and 42375 M−1 cm−1) compared to those of the reference TA-St-CA dye (469 nm and 21803 M−1 cm−1). DFT and TD-DFT calculations of MY-102 dye show that the LUMO level of the dye lies closer to the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2. A power conversion efficiency of 5.07% is achieved by fabricating the solar cell with the conventional I3−/I− electrolyte compared to 4.26% obtained with the reference TA-St-CA dye. MY-102 dye fabricated with the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte shows an improvement in power conversion efficiency due to the increased VOC. The I3−/I− electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.35 V is located at a much higher energy region compared to the HOMO level of MY-102 and near the conduction band edge of TiO2. This limits both electron transfer to MY-102 and electron acceptance from TiO2, affecting the VOC and results in poor conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.62 V is located near the HOMO level of MY-102 and below the conduction band edge of TiO2, which facilitates the efficient electron transfer and acceptance. This contributes to the VOC of MY-102 dye and results in an outstanding conversion efficiency of 6.62%.
1. Introduction
The dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in environmental degradation and led our search towards green energy resources. Solar energy is a viable source for electricity generation in the framework of non-conventional energy technologies.1–3 Compared to the conventional silicon based solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have gained wide attention in recent days owing to their low-cost materials, ease of fabrication, environmentally friendly nature, and photovoltaic performance under indoor light.4–6 Among the various components, the sensitizer plays a significant role in the overall performance of DSCs. Metal based ruthenium dyes were reported with more than 12% conversion efficiency, but the drawbacks such as rarity, expensive nature, and difficulty in purification limit their application in DSC technology.7–9 Attention on organic donor–acceptor dyes is tremendously increasing among the research community due to their benefits such as low cost, environment friendliness, multiple pathways for synthesis, flexible design, and high molar extinction coefficients.10–15 Organic dyes basically consist of donor and acceptor parts linked by a conjugated chain (D–π–A) and their photovoltaic properties could be altered significantly by varying the configuration of their molecular structures. Most of the research efforts in this field employing organic dyes use cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor and dye anchoring group.16–19
In TiO2 photoelectrode based DSCs, triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox electrolytes are commonly preferred due to their favourable dye regeneration properties and high charge recombination resistance at the semiconductor electrolyte interfaces.20 Triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox electrolytes possess various drawbacks such as corrosive nature, and redox reactions occur at 0.35 V versus normal hydrogen electrode, which is a high energy level to reduce the oxidized sensitizers thereby limiting its application in DSCs. Cobalt based redox couples have been reported as an alternative to the conventional triiodide/iodide based electrolytes and their compatibility with D–π–A dyes has been reported.9,21–23 The disadvantage of fast interfacial recombination kinetics can be resolved by the addition of long alkyl chains in the dyes. The redox potentials of the cobalt electrolyte can be tuned by the introduction of different ligands with various donor/acceptor groups and the band gap can be modified from 0.43 to 0.62 V. It was reported that Co(phen)32+ exists in the low spin state and contributes to the regeneration of the dye and increases the VOC.21,22,24–26
Triphenylamine (TPA) dyes are the best known donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) form of organic dyes applied in DSCs due to their electron-donating properties and low-cost design and cost-effective synthesis.27–29 Band gap fine-tuning followed by synthetic modifications by attachment of either an electron donor or π-acceptor can improve the energy conversion efficiency of dyes. Also, the choice of an electrolyte with its redox potential located close to the HOMO level of the dye can improve the VOC of the dye.30 In this work, we have synthesized MY-102 dye (Fig. 1) which is a D–π-extended–A form and used Co(Phen)32+ as the redox electrolyte and obtained best energy conversion efficiencies as compared to that of the I3−/I− redox couple. The reason for this is, the redox potential of I3−/I− (0.35 V) lies closer to the CB of the TiO2 and is higher than the HOMO level of the MY-102 dye. Due to the higher recombination rate, the electron transfer efficiency to MY-102 becomes poor and results in the lower VOC. On the other hand, the redox potential of Co(phen)32+ lies closer to the HOMO level of the MY-102 dye and has a higher conduction band edge gap with TiO2. Due to the lower recombination rate and smooth electron transfer to MY-102, a higher VOC is achieved as compared to the I3−/I− electrolyte. Further, the faster recombination rates of the cobalt redox couple are reduced when the triphenylamine dyes are substituted with hexylthiophene donor groups, which results in higher efficiencies. Herein, we report the synthesis, photophysical, electrochemical, and DFT-TDFT studies, and photo-conversion efficiencies of the solar cell with iodide/triiodide and cobalt based electrolytes.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis

MY-102 is synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. 2 is synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction of 1 with 2-hexyl-5-boronic acid pinacol ester under reflux conditions in dioxane. 3 is synthesized by the Wittig reaction of 2 with CH3(PPh3)3I under basic conditions in THF. Sonogashira coupling of 3 using Pd-catalyst with 4-bromostyryl-3-hexylthiophene gave 4. Vilsmeier condensation of 4 using DMF and POCl3 gave 5. MY-102 is synthesized by the condensation of 5 with the active methylene group in cyanoacetic acid using piperidine as the base.

2.2. Photophysical and electrochemical properties

MY-102 shows a strong absorption maximum at 480 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 4.237 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and shoulders at 414 and 302 nm with molar extinction coefficients of 1.712 and 1.787 × 104 M−1 cm−1 corresponding to the π–π* charge-transfer (CT) transitions.32,33 Both absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficients of MY-102 are higher than those of the reference TA-St-CA dye (327, 0.84 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 469, 2.18 × 104 M−1 cm−1). When MY-102 is excited within the CT absorption band at room temperature, it exhibits a strong luminescence maximum at 565 nm. The optical band gap calculated from the intersection of the absorption and emission maxima is found to be 2.344 eV. The absorption and emission spectra of MY-102 and TA-St-CA measured in THF are shown in Fig. 2.

The electrochemical properties of MY-102 and TA-St-CA were studied using cyclic voltammetry in an acetonitrile/THF (1:1, v/v) solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. Ferrocene was used as an internal standard (0.476 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The oxidation and reduction potentials of MY-102 were 0.48 and −0.487 V vs. NHE, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels of MY-102 were found to be −4.81 and −2.466 eV, with a band gap of 2.344 eV (Table 1).

2.3. Computational study
The optimized structure of MY-102 is given in Fig. 3. The energy level diagrams of occupied and unoccupied frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of MY-102 are also shown in the figure. The isodensity surface plots (isodensity contour = 0.02) of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO−1) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the dye MY-102 are also shown in the figure. The band gap of MY-102 is found to be 2.09 eV in the gas phase. As seen in the figure, the HOMO level electron clouds are distributed throughout the molecule. But, in the LUMO level, the electron clouds are present on the strong electron withdrawing cyanoacetic acid anchoring group. A similar trend is observed in the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 levels of the dye. When anchored to TiO2, under sunlight irradiation, the electrons are excited from the HOMO level to the LUMO level of MY-102 and transferred to the TiO2 conduction band. The band gap of MY-102 and the LUMO level is located just above the conduction band of TiO2 which facilitates the smooth electron transfer.32–34 It should be noted that because of the π-extended phenylene spacer present in the molecule, the band gap of the molecule is considerably lowered compared with other triphenylamine dyes.33

2.4. Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties of the MY-102 dye in I3−/I− and Co(Phen)32+ electrolytes and in comparison with that of the reference dye are shown in Fig. 4 and the J–V parameters are listed in Table 2. In the I3−/I− electrolyte, MY-102 dye shows JSC = 10.44 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.714 V and fill factor (ff) = 0.68% with an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 5.07% as compared to TA-St-CA which shows JSC = 9.44 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.673 V and fill factor (ff) = 0.67% with an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.26%. MY-102 dye efficiency is 16% more as compared to that of TA-St-CA. In the Co(Phen)32+ electrolyte, MY-102 dye shows JSC = 10.24 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.898 V and fill factor (ff) = 0.72% with an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.62% as compared to TA-St-CA which shows JSC = 9.36 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.775 V and fill factor (ff) = 0.68% with an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.93%. Both the dyes showed better conversion efficiencies in the Co(Phen)32+ electrolyte as compared to the I3−/I− electrolyte. Due to the high VOC, MY-102 showed 27% more efficiency improvement as compared to that of the I3−/I− electrolyte.

As seen in the J–V-performance of the dyes, the improvement in the solar cell conversion efficiency of TA-St-CA and MY-102 mainly comes from the increase in VOC. It should be noted that, losses due to charge recombination between the electrons in the oxidized species in the I3−/I− redox electrolyte limit the DSC efficiency by lowering VOC as shown in Fig. 5. The I3−/I− electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.35 V is located at a much higher energy region compared to the HOMO level of MY-102 and near the conduction band edge of TiO2. This limits the electron transfer from I3−/I− to the HOMO level of the MY-102 dye due to the increased electron recombination at the electrolyte surface. Also, the electron acceptance from the valence band of TiO2 becomes poor, thereby lowering VOC and resulting in a poor overall power conversion efficiency. The lower photocurrent observed using the triiodide/iodide redox couple illustrates one of the advantages of using cobalt redox couples in DSCs and can partly be explained by the loss in photocurrent due to light absorption by triiodide. In addition, fast recombination will lead to lower concentrations of electrons in the conduction band and correspondingly lower photovoltages.21 For many one-electron, outer-sphere redox couples, faster recombination and shorter electron lifetimes have been measured compared to devices incorporating iodide/triiodide, and are thought to be the main limitation to these alternative redox systems.26,35–38 On the other hand, the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.62 V is located near the HOMO level of the MY-102 dye which facilitates the efficient electron transfer to MY-102 and reduces the recombination rate of the electrons at the electrolyte surface.21 Also, there is a large gap between the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the redox potential of the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte which contributes a lot to the VOC of the dye, which correspondingly shows an outstanding conversion efficiency of 6.62%.

OC characteristics of MY-102 in I3−/I− and Co(phen)32+ electrolytes. 
The higher efficiency of the dye obtained using MY-102 is due to the decreased recombination rate between electrons in TiO2 and Co(III) species in the electrolyte, as follows from electron J–V curves recorded in the dark (see Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI†). The IPCE of the dyes showed strong conversion between 380 and 600 nm and reached the highest absorption of 85% at 475 nm.33 Effective dye anchoring on the TiO2 surface could promote the charge recombination resistance at TiO2/dye interfaces and is further analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.39–41 The typical Nyquist plots of MY-102 in the dark and under 1 sun radiation are presented in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). The second frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. Under dark conditions, the diameter of the second semicircle refers to the charge recombination resistance (Rre) of TiO2/electrolyte interfaces, i.e., dark current.42,43 From the equivalent circuit analysis, the MY-102 sensitizer showed higher Re ∼ 74 Ω than TA-St-CA (Re ∼ 58 Ω) which suggests that the large amount of C6H13-moieties (dye forest) in the MY-102 dye effectively blocks the direct contact between the TiO2 surface and electrolyte, thus retarding the undesirable electron leakage from TiO2 to the electrolyte. The impedance under 1 sun radiation of MY-102 shows a lower recombination resistance of 41 Ω at the TiO2/electrolyte interfaces as compared to TA-St-CA (49 Ω).

3.4. Synthesis of MY-102

3.4.1. Synthesis of 4-(bis(4-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amino)benzaldehyde (2). 
Compound 1 (3.40 g, 7.9 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (265 mg, 0.05 mmol) and Na2CO3 (1.02 g, excess, in 5 mL of H2O) were added into 50 mL of 1,4-dioxane and degassed for 15 min under a constant stream of nitrogen. A solution of thiophen-2-yl-boronic ester (5.57 g, 18.92 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL) was added slowly, and the mixture was refluxed for a further 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with 70 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic portions were combined and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica (hexane/ethyl acetate, 90:10, v/v) to give 2 as a yellow solid. Yield: 76.6%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 9.83 (s, 1H), 7.72 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 7.16–7.14 (m, 8H), 6.74 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 2H), 2.84 (t, J = 7.6, 4H), 1.70 (d, J = 7.6, 6H), 1.33–1.32 (m, 14H), 0.92 (m, 7H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) = 190, 153, 146, 141, 137, 134, 131, 130, 126, 125, 124, 123, 120, 32, 30, 29, 23, 14.

The resulting solution was then stirred at room temperature for 8 h under nitrogen. After 8 h, the solution was poured into a mixture of methylene chloride and distilled water. The product was extracted in the organic layer and after removing the solvent, the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using n-hexane as an eluent. After removal of the solvent, the residue was precipitated into methylene chloride/methanol (1:20, v/v) to give 3 as a yellowish white solid.

After removing the solvent, the residue was loaded onto a silica gel column with hexane as an eluent to give 5 as yellow oil (0.92 g).

3.4.5. Synthesis of MY-102. 
Compound 5 (540 mg, 0.6 mmol), cyanoacetic acid (82 mg, 0.96 mmol), and piperidine (0.13 mL, 1.32 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (25 mL) and heated under reflux for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the solution was acidified with 10% aqueous HCl and extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was purified by chromatography on silica (n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 90/10, v/v) to give a yellow solid of MY-102. Yield: 76.6%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) = 12.24 (s, 1H), 7.62 (d, J = 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.60 (d, J = 2 Hz, 2H), 7.5 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 4H), 7.42–7.38 (m, 5H), 7.29 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H), 7.18 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.0 (t, J = 4, 8.8 Hz, 4H), 6.84–6.83 (m, 3H), 2.80–2.74 (m, 7H), 2.50–2.49 (m, 6H), 1.64–1.58 (m, 7H), 0.94 (m, 7H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 165.5, 157.5, 157.3, 156.9, 153, 149.8, 149.6, 147.1, 146, 141, 137, 136, 134, 131, 130, 126, 125, 124, 123, 120, 118, 114, 92.8, 32, 31.5, 30, 29, 28.5, 23, 14.5.

3.5. DSSC fabrication
DSCs were fabricated according to the previously reported procedure.9,22,23,31 The fabrication procedure was as follows:
Transparent fluorinated-SnO2-layered conductive glass (FTO, purchased from Pilkington Co. Ltd., Pilkington-TEC8) with TiO2 electrodes was prepared by screen printing a paste of TiO2 nanoparticles (T20/SP; Solaronix) on the FTO-coated glass (8 Ω cm−2) and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, a reflecting scattering layer containing ∼400 nm sized TiO2 anatase particles (Ti-Nanoxide R/SP; Solaronix) was also prepared by screen printing and sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the TiO2 electrode was approximately 17 mm. After cooling to 80 °C, the sintered TiO2 electrodes were immediately immersed in the acetonitrile solution with dyes (MY-102 and TA-St-CA, separately) and kept at room temperature overnight. After 24 h, the dye sensitized photoelectrodes were removed from the dye solutions, and washed with acetonitrile and dried with a thin flow of nitrogen.
For the electrolyte injection, two holes were prepared on another FTO glass plate and cleaned in a detergent solution in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min, followed by cleaning in DI water and acetonitrile for 10 min each, and then dried using nitrogen. The counter electrode was prepared by dropping a transparent platinum catalyst (Platisol, Solaronix) on the FTO glass plate with two holes and heating at 400 °C for 5 min. A 60 μm thick hot melt ionomer film (Surlyn, SX1170-60 from Solaronix) was sandwiched between the TiO2 working electrode and the Pt counter electrode by heating at 110 °C for a few seconds. The space between the electrodes was filled with liquid electrolytes, with the I3−/I− and Co(phen)32+ electrolyte composition as follows:
I3−/I− electrolyte: 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (0.7 M), guanidinium thiocyanate (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) in acetonitrile/valeronitrile = 85:15 (v/v).
Co(phen)32+ electrolyte: Co(phen)32+/3+ (0.3 M), nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4, 75 mM), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI, 0.1 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) in acetonitrile.
After the electrolyte injection, the holes were sealed with Surlyn and a thin cover glass.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we discussed the synthesis and solar cell conversion efficiency improvement of MY-102 using I3−/I− and Co(phen)32+ electrolytes. MY-102 was synthesized by the recent synthetically important Wittig, Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions in good yield. The photophysical properties of the dye show higher absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficient (480 nm and 42375 M−1 cm−1) compared to that of the reference TA-St-CA dye (469 nm and 21803 M−1 cm−1). DFT and TD-DFT calculations show that the LUMO level of the dye lies closer to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The sunlight to electricity conversion is achieved by fabricating the solar cell with the conventional I3−/I− electrolyte resulting in a conversion efficiency of 5.07% as compared to that of the reference TA-St-CA dye (4.26%). In the J–V-spectra of solar cells fabricated using the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte, the improvement in the conversion efficiency mainly comes from the increased VOC. As seen in Fig. 5, the I3−/I− electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.35 V is located at a much higher energy region compared to the HOMO level of MY-102 and near the conduction band edge of TiO2. This limits both electron transfer to MY-102 and electron acceptance from TiO2, affecting VOC and resulting in the poor conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the Co(phen)32+ electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.62 V is located near the HOMO level of the MY-102 dye and possesses a large gap with the conduction band edge of TiO2 which facilitates the efficient electron transfer and acceptance. This contributes a lot to the VOC of MY-102 dye, which shows an outstanding conversion efficiency of 6.62%.
