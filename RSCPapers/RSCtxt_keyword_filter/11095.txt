    , Accepted 9th June 2021First published on 9th June 2021AbstractDifferent from the commonly studied non-fullerene electron acceptors with large fused backbone architecture and tedious synthesis steps, non-fused ring electron acceptors are attractive for organic solar cells (OSC) due to their simple synthesis and comparable device performance. However, it is key to choose appropriate building blocks for constructing non-fused ring electron acceptors to achieve high-performance OSCs. Herein, two simple non-fused ring electron acceptors, TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F, which possess the same terminals and 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene unit coupled with different electron-deficient diketone central units, are synthesized. TPDC-4F with a thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione core exhibits a smaller optical bandgap of 1.42 eV, downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, higher electron mobility, and enhanced molecular packing order in neat thin films as compared to BTIC-4F with a 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboxyimide core. As a result, the OSC based on TPDC-4F with stronger molecular packing yielded a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.35% with a Voc of 0.852 V, which is one of the best values ever reported in non-fused ring electron acceptors-based binary OSCs with Voc over 0.85 V, and is better than that of OSC based on the BTIC-4F with weaker molecular stacking (PCE = 12.04%). This work demonstrates the application of electron-deficient diketone units in efficient non-fused ring electron acceptors and provides molecular design guidance for high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be a promising photovoltaic technology owing to their unique advantages such as being lightweight, flexible, semi-transparent, and printable over large areas.1–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have exceeded 17% due to the development of new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).6–10 Currently, most efficient NFAs normally contain a so-called acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) fused-ring structure framework due to their advantages of adjustable energy levels, strong light absorptions, and reduced energy losses.11–16 Generally, the large central cores (D unit) are fused-ladder-type building blocks, which promote the delocalization of π-electrons and facilitate the strong intermolecular packing.11,12,15,17 Though higher device performance can be achieved with these molecules (such as INIC, IDCIC and ITOT), fused-ladder rings always require multi-step synthesis procedures, thus resulting in an overall low yield and high cost.18–21
Taking this into consideration, non-fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with partially or fully unfused-ladder rings as π-conjugated backbones have been developed to mediate the molecular planarity through intramolecular noncovalent interactions such as O⋯S, N⋯S and F⋯H noncovalent bonds.22–25 These NFREAs not only offer synthetic simplicity with diversified building blocks, they also exhibit broad absorption and high electron mobility, like the fused-core counterparts, thereby rendering comparable photovoltaic performances.24,26–29 For example, Huang et al. reported OSCs based on NFREAs, which achieved a PCE of over 14.5%, in which the NFREAs exhibited a nearly planar molecular geometry owing to the O⋯S noncovalent interaction with absorption range over 900 nm.29 Very recently, our group developed NFREAs called BDC-4F-C8 with a central 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) core unit, cyclopentadithiophene flanking unit, and fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DFIC) terminal unit, which achieved a PCE of 12.53% with a low energy loss of 0.51 eV.30 These results indicate that NFREAs constructed by introducing electronegativity atoms containing noncovalent intramolecular interactions can contribute to superior photovoltaic performance. However, NFREAs with alkyloxy-substituted benzene or other electron-donating non-fused rings have usually been limited to pairing with the lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level-type wide bandgap polymer donors such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl -5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) and poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10) due to their relatively high HOMO energy levels; consequently, the hole transfer from NFREAs to donor becomes energetically unfavorable.31 Therefore, it seems necessary to introduce electron-deficient units of D moiety for locking the molecular geometry via noncovalent intramolecular interactions and simultaneously achieving relatively low-lying HOMO energy levels.
Bearing this in mind, electron-deficient diketone units seem to meet the requirements of both electron-withdrawing properties and noncovalent intramolecular interaction. Chen's group reported NFREAs containing thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with O⋯S intramolecular interactions.32 Compared to common alkyloxy-substituted benzene counterparts, the TPD core showed more quinoidal character, leading to a larger delocalization of π-electrons and a better skeleton coplanarity of NFREAs. The diketone groups increase electron affinity, which holds back the uplifting of the HOMO levels to match well with those wide bandgap polymer donors for efficient hole transfer. The intramolecular O⋯S noncovalent interactions further improve the molecular planarity and promote the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The solubility and intermolecular packing can be easily adjusted through the N-alkylation of the imide group on the TPD core. Thus, the TPD-based device achieved a PCE of 10.12% when combined with poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)) -alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB -T). Among the various electron-deficient diketone units, the 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboxyimide (BTI) unit was employed as the foundation of a great number of high-performance polymer semiconductors.33–36 As we can see in Fig. 1, density functional theory (DFT) was performed on these two diketones and both TPD and BTI units have coplanar backbones and strong electron-withdrawing characteristics through the π-electron delocalization. For example, Guo's group reported a polymer acceptor with the BTI unit that gave a PCE of 14.3% for an all-polymer solar cell.37 All these features indicated that the BTI unit is also suitable for constructing NFREAs for high-performance OSCs.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures, optimized geometries of 4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) and 4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2′,3′-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (BTI). Calculations were carried out at the DFT//B3LYP/6-31G* level. 
Based on these above considerations, in this contribution, we designed and synthesized two simple electron acceptors, named TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F NFREAs, which consist of electron-deficient diketone TPD and BTI cores, respectively, connected to the DFIC terminals through a 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) bridge (Fig. 2a). Our design rationale is as follows: (1) in comparison with previously reported terminal segments such as 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (NC) unit, DFIC with two fluorine atoms can further enhance the ICT effect and intermolecular π–π stacking; (2) the BTI unit exhibits extended conjugated length of the core unit and may contribute to the greater delocalization of π-electrons; (3) the intramolecular O⋯S noncovalent interaction between the TPD or BTI core and the CPDT bridge will predictably improve the molecular planarity and this may enhance the charge transfer and device performance. Surprisingly, compared to BTIC-4F, TPDC-4F exhibited a smaller optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.42 eV (Eoptg of 1.48 eV for BTIC-4F), higher electron mobility, and preferable face-on orientation in the neat thin film. Moreover, BTIC-4F showed a higher HOMO level (−5.71 eV) than TPDC-4F (−5.83 eV) but the HOMO energy levels of both were deep enough to match well with the widely used polymer donor, PM6.38 As a result, the OSCs based on PM6:TPDC-4F yielded a PCE of 13.35% with a Voc of 0.852 V, Jsc of 22.19 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.6%, which is higher as compared to the PM6:BTIC-4F-based device (PCE of 12.04% with a Voc of 0.894 V, Jsc of 20.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.7%). To our best knowledge, the PCE of 13.35% is one of the best values ever reported in NFREA-based binary OSCs with Voc over 0.85 V (see Table S7 and Fig. S18†). Overall, our work indicates that employing electron-deficient diketone units to construct NFREAs is a promising strategy for achieving high-performance and low-cost OSCs, and we also reveal insights into the exquisite molecular design of simple and effective electron acceptors.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of acceptors
The synthetic routes for TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F compounds are displayed in Fig. 2b and the detailed synthetic procedures are given in the ESI.† Compound 1 was obtained through 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene alkyl substitution with 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane. Then, an aldehyde group was introduced at either side of compound 1 by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. The Stille reagent 3 was available through the successive lithiation and transmetallation reactions of compound 2. Then, the key bis-formyl intermediates compound 6 and 7 were obtained by the Stille coupling reaction of compound 3 and 1,3-dibromo-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (compound 4) and 2,8-dibromo-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2′,3′-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (compound 5), respectively. Finally, through Knoevenagel condensations of compounds 6 and 7 with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DFIC), TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F were afforded as black solids with good yields. The chemical structures of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), and microanalysis, which affirmed the high purity of these two molecules (see Fig. S1–S6†). Both TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F also have good solubilities in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene at room temperature. For example, both TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F can be fully dissolved at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9,† the materials are well soluble in the chlorobenzene and chloroform at the stated concentrations. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to investigate the thermal properties of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F and the corresponding TGA and DSC curves are shown in Fig. S10 and S11.† Both TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F had good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 348 °C, which is desirable for the thermal annealing process during device fabrication to tune the morphology of the bulk-heterojunction. From the DSC curves of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F, we can see that TPDC-4F exhibited the melting (Tm) temperature of 281 °C and a distinct crystallization temperature (Tc) of ca. 180 °C after the first-round heating and cooling. A similar melting (Tm) temperature was obtained along with heating again, showing the easy crystallization of TPDC-4F. However, for BTIC-4F, we can only find the melting (Tm) temperature of 293 °C for the first-round heating, while the crystallization temperature was unobservable after cooling. This indicates that the BTIC-4F was difficult to crystallize.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were conducted to further investigate the molecular geometry of the ground states of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F. The side chains, including the alkyl groups of TPD, BTI core and CPDT units, have negligible impact on molecular conformations; hence, in order to simplify the calculations, the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups (see Fig. S7†). TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F exhibited a complete planar molecular architecture between the planar bridge CPDT, the terminal DFIC and the core TPD or BTI unit with dihedral angles of nearly zero degrees (Fig. S8†). This planar structure may enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking, thus contributing to the charge transfer and improving the carrier mobility. Moreover, both the electron density distributions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO levels were well delocalized throughout the whole backbone. The HOMO/LUMO levels of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F were then calculated to be −5.78/−3.88 eV and −5.73/−3.87 eV, respectively.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F in chloroform solutions and neat films are shown in Fig. S12a† and 3a, and their optical data are summarized in Table 1. Compared to BTIC-4F, TPDC-4F showed a 21 nm red-shifted spectral band in dilute solution indicating that the introduction of the TPD unit enhanced the ICT from the central core to the end-groups. TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F featured absorption peaks at 717 nm and 696 nm with extinction coefficients of 1.54 × 105 and 1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. From the solution to the solid-state, the maximum absorption peaks of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F are centered at 765 and 739 nm, red-shifted by 48 nm and 43 nm relative to those in dilute solutions, indicating strong intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid-state. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F, estimated from their absorption onsets of the films at ∼873 and 837 nm, were 1.42 and 1.48 eV, respectively, using an empirical formula of Eoptg = 1240/λonset. Both the non-fullerene acceptors have complementary absorption bands with the benchmark polymer of PM6, which has a strong absorption band at 300–700 nm (Fig. 3a).

Cyclovoltammetry (CV) tests on TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F revealed distinct oxidation and reduction potentials (Fig. 3b). When using an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference, one can calculate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels according to the equation EHOMO/ELUMO = −e(Eox/Ered + 4.80) (eV). Accordingly, the HOMO/LUMO levels of TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F were roughly estimated as −5.83/−3.99 eV and −5.71/−3.95 eV, respectively with reference to the energy level of ferrocene of −4.8 eV vs. vacuum level (Fig. S13†). Both the acceptors have matched HOMO/LUMO levels relative to PM6, indicating efficient charge transfer between the polymer donor and NFREAs (Fig. 3c). With the upshifted LUMO level of BTIC-4F, the BTIC-4F-based OSCs are expected to have enlarged Voc values. Furthermore, the downshifted HOMO/LUMO energy levels of TPDC-4F are consistent with the results from the DFT measurements.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic responses of the electron acceptors were evaluated by fabricating BHJ OSCs within the conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINN/Ag, where PDINN was used as the cathode interface layer.39 All cells were tested under simulated AM1.5G with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Device fabrication conditions, such as the D:A weight ratio, the amounts of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive, and the thermal annealing (TA) temperature, were optimized to maximize the device performance. The detailed device parameters of OSCs fabricated under different conditions are listed in Tables S1–S4.† The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices and the corresponding characteristics are exhibited in Fig. 4a, S14 and Table 2. The PM6:BTIC-4F-based devices offered a PCE maximum of 12.04% with Voc of 0.894 V, a Jsc of 20.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.7%. For the TPDC-4F-based devices, despite a lower Voc of 0.852 V, a higher PCE of 13.35% was achieved with simultaneously elevated Jsc of 22.19 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.6%. The J–V curves of the devices were scanned in forward and reverse directions to provide the hysteresis study. As shown in Fig. S15a and b,† the devices exhibited negligible hysteresis, especially the TPDC-4F-based device. To our best knowledge, the PCE of 13.35% is one of the best values ever reported in non-fused ring electron acceptors-based binary OSCs with Voc over 0.85 V as shown in Fig. 4b. The full list of reports that represent data in Fig. 4b is shown in Table S7.† The reports that show PCE above 13% are numbered in Fig. 4b and S20† according to their reference numbers in the main text.24,26–29 The decreased Voc of TPDC-4F-based devices is reasonable, considering the downshifted LUMO energy levels. Compared to PM6:BTIC-4F, the increased Jsc and FF of PM6:TPDC-4F were attributed to the broader absorption, higher mobility, less charge recombination and better molecular stacking morphology, and these will be discussed in the following sections. The stability of the devices was investigated in a N2-filled glovebox without encapsulation and the decay curves are presented in Fig. S15c.† In the first 100 h, the PCE of both devices retained 92% of the initial efficiency. After that, the PCE of both devices gradually and slowly decreased but maintains 85% and 78% of the original efficiency for the TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F-based device, respectively.

The Jsc values of the binary devices were verified from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 4c). Both the optimized PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F devices exhibited nearly the same strong spectral EQE response (>60%) across the range of 400–750 nm with a maximum EQE value of 79%. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the only difference in EQE photo-response is in the range of 750–900 nm, in which the TPDC-4F-based devices showed much higher and broader EQE response than BTIC-4F-based devices. This is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films (Fig. S12b†). The integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves of the TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F based devices are 21.04 and 19.39 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values from the J–V curves.
Charge carrier mobility
The hole- and electron-transport characteristics of the pure films of TPDC-4F, BTIC-4F and their blends with the polymer donor PM6 were investigated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in the hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag) and the electron-only device (ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag), respectively. The μe value of the pristine TPDC-4F film was 8.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was slightly higher than that of BTIC-4F (6.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S16 and Table S5†). The μh and μe were estimated to be 4.11 × 10−4 and 4.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PM6:TPDC-4F blend film, respectively, giving a μh/μe ratio of 1.01. In comparison, the PM6:BTIC-4F blend film showed a lower μh of 3.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, giving a larger μh/μe of 1.29. The higher carrier mobility and more balanced μh/μe ratio of the PM6:TPDC-4F device contributed to increasing Jsc and FF as compared to PM6:BTIC-4F.
Charge recombination, extraction and transport
To gain insight into the charge generation, dissociation, and collection properties of the binary solar cells, we investigated the exciton generation rate and charge collection probability. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) was firstly plotted as shown in Fig. 5a. Jph is defined as JLight − JDark, where JLight and JDark are the photocurrent densities under light illumination and in the dark, respectively, and Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied bias.40,41 When Veff approached 2 V (or more than 2 V), almost all photogenerated excitons were almost dissociated into free charge carriers and were swept out to the electrodes by a high electric field without any recombination. As such, Jph could reach saturation (Jsat), which is solely dependent on the photon absorption by the active layer and is not influenced by the charge collection process. Therefore, the maximum rate of exciton generation (Gmax) could be calculated from a photocurrent in the saturated regime, by using the relationship Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer.42 We calculated the Gmax of PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F as 1.45 × 1028 and 1.37 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. This indicates that the TPDC-4F-based device has larger exciton generation than the BTIC-4F-based device, agreeing well with Jsc and EQE results. The charge collection probability (PC) in the devices was calculated to understand the charge collection process by using Jph/Jsatversus the Veff and the detailed curves are shown in Fig. 5b.43 Under the short-circuit conditions, the PC values for the PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F-based devices were 0.952 and 0.934, respectively. The probability of charge collection of the PM6:TPDC-4F-based OSC was larger than that of the PM6:BTIC-4F-based counterpart, which is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF values for the PM6:TPDC-4F-based device.

In order to understand the charge recombination of the OSC devices, we measured the power law relationship between the Jsc and the incident light intensity (Pin) (Fig. 5c). The relationship can be described by Jsc ∝ Pinα, in which α is an exponential factor that represents the bimolecular recombination degree.44 Usually, if the α value is close to 1, this means that all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes with ignorable bimolecular recombination and accumulation. On the other hand, if the α value is away from 1, this indicates that bimolecular recombination can be serious. The α values were calculated as 0.976 and 0.964 for PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F blends, respectively, suggesting the weaker bimolecular recombination of the TPDC-4F-based device and, therefore, its higher Jsc value in comparison with the TPDC-4F-based counterpart. In addition, the dark current of the devices also verified less bimolecular recombination of PM6:TPDC-4F resulting from a relatively low leakage current as compared to PM6:BTIC-4F (shown in Fig. S17†).45
The relationship between Voc and Pin was used to reflect the trap-assisted recombination behavior in both molecular-based devices (Fig. 5d). The Voc dependence on Pin can be expressed as Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Pin), where k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively.46 When the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Pin is equal to kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and q is the elementary charge), the trap-assisted recombination is negligible. However, when the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Pin is close to 2kT/q, trap-assisted recombination plays a major role in the devices.47,48 The TPDC-4F-based devices exhibited a smaller slope of 1.26kT/q than that of BTIC-4F (1.32kT/q), suggesting that decreased trap-assisted recombination was realized, which is beneficial for achieving higher Jsc and FF.
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of thin-film PM6, TPDC-4F, BTIC-4F and PM6:TPDC-4F, PM6:BTIC-4F blend films were obtained to investigate the photo-induced charge transfer in the blend films (Fig. 6). The PL intensity of PM6 was significantly quenched in both the PM6:TPDC-4F and the PM6:BTIC-4F blend films with quenching efficiency of 93% and 90.2%, respectively, indicating the efficient electron transfer from PM6 to both the acceptors (Fig. 6a). The PM6:TPDC-4F blend film showed higher PL quenching efficiency of 98.3% as compared to that of the PM6:BTIC-4F blend film (PL quenching efficiency of 96.5%) when compared to their pure acceptor films (Fig. 6b and c). This indicates that the PM6:TPDC-4F blend film exhibited more efficient exciton dissociation and hole transfer in the related blends, which is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF.

The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique was performed on the neat and blended films to further investigate the charge transfer dynamics. As shown in Fig. 7a, a biexponential function was processed to fit these curves based on a computational formula.49,50 The average lifetime (τave) values were 1.41, 1.14 and 1.38 ns for pure PM6, TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F film, respectively. However, distinct PL quenching was observed for the PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F blend films, which showed the shortening of the PL lifetime in the active layers for both TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F blends. Particularly, as shown in Table 3, the PM6:TPDC-4F blend film exhibited a relatively faster photoluminescence decay (0.502 ns) as compared to the PM6:BTIC-4F (0.696 ns) blend films, suggesting more efficient hole and electron transfer between the donor and acceptors.

Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement was used to assess the charge extraction capability of PM6:TPDC-4F- and BTIC-4F-based devices.51,52 As shown in Fig. 7b, the photocurrent decay times, processed by fitting the curves with exponential decay function, were 0.4 μs and 0.44 μs for PM6:TPDC-4F- and PM6:BTIC-4F-based devices, respectively. Thus, the PM6:TPDC-4F device demonstrated a shorter photocurrent decay time as compared to the PM6:BTIC-4F device, implying a faster charge extraction capability and agreeing well with the increased mobilities and reduced monomolecular recombination. In contrast, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement was used to evaluate the charge carrier lifetimes and the degree of charge recombination (Fig. 7c).53 The carrier lifetimes of the PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F devices were 3.23 and 2.69 μs, respectively. The longer carrier lifetime of the PM6:TPDC-4F device implies less bimolecular recombination than the PM6:BTIC-4F device, agreeing well with the results of recombination observed from Jsc ∝ Pinα and the dark current test.
Blend film morphology
The morphologies of these blend films were further investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S18a and b,† the PM6:TPDC-4F blend film displayed a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.36 nm, while the RMS of PM6:BTIC-4F blend film was 3.62 nm. The PM6:TPDC-4F blend film exhibited a smoother and more uniform surface morphology than the PM6:BTIC-4F, suggesting better miscibility between PM6 and TPDC-4F. From the AFM phase image in Fig. S18c and d,† both the blend films showed uniform surfaces without the formation of undesirably large aggregates. The BHJ morphology was further visualized by TEM (Fig. S18e and f†). Both blend films formed nanoscale phase separation and bi-continuous networks with a well-dispersed fibrillar structure (Fig. S18e and f†). However, the PM6:TPDC-4F blend film exhibited bright and dark regimes with higher contrast interpenetrating across the image, suggesting a more homogeneous nanoscale phase separation and bi-continuous networks, thus showing more suitable phase separation than PM6:BTIC-4F. The charge separation can effectively occur through the whole interface between donor and acceptor in the blend films with better nanoscale phase separation and bi-continuous networks as well as better phase separation. In addition to this, the charge can be well transported through the bi-continuous networks with better phase separation, thereby resulting in its higher Jsc and FF values.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to investigate the molecular orientation and packing behaviors.54 The 2D GIWAXS patterns and 1D line cuts of the BHJ films are shown in Fig. 8 and the detailed GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S6.† As shown in Fig. S19,† the pristine PM6 exhibited the (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at 1.68 Å−1 with a π–π distance of 3.71 Å, and showed a distinct (100) peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.289 Å−1 with a lamellar distance of 21.73 Å, which suggests a dominant face-on orientation for PM6. In neat acceptor films (Fig. 8b), TPDC-4F possesses obvious π–π stacking (d = 3.60 Å) peak at 1.73 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.392 Å−1 in the IP direction, indicating a dominant face-on oriented molecular stacking, which is beneficial for vertical charge transport. In contrast, for BTIC-4F, a sharp lamellar peak was observed in the OOP direction at 0.39 Å−1 (d = 15.74 Å), while the π–π stacking peak was located at 1.754 Å−1 (d = 3.58 Å) in the IP direction. This suggests that the BTIC-4F molecule is predominantly edge-on oriented. When the acceptors were blended with PM6, all the BHJ films preferred face-on orientations. Specifically, compared with PM6:BTIC-4F blends, PM6:TPDC-4F blends showed more intense lamellar peaks in the IP direction and stronger π–π stacking signals in the OOP direction with a shorter π–π distance of 3.61 Å (π–π distance of 3.64 Å for PM6:BTIC-4F in the OOP direction). Furthermore, in the OOP direction, the calculated coordinate coherence lengths (CCLs) were 17.88 and 16.23 Å for PM6:TPDC-4F and PM6:BTIC-4F, respectively. A similar trend was also observed in the CCL of lamellar stacking for the two blend films (Table S6†). These results implied that the shorter π–π distance and longer CCL of PM6:TPDC-4F are beneficial for forming ordered stacking, which is in agreement with their higher charge carrier mobilities and better device performances.

Conclusions
We have developed two simple highly efficient non-fused ring electron acceptors by incorporating electron-deficient diketone units as the key central building blocks, namely TPDC-4F and BTIC-4F. Compared to the BTIC-4F containing 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboxyimide, TPDC-4F exhibited a red-shifted absorption and downshifted HOMO level and improved face-on orientation. Consequently, OSCs based on PM6:TPDC-4F showed simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF, affording a decent PCE of 13.35%, which is higher than that (12.04%) obtained from BTIC-4F-based devices. To our best knowledge, a PCE of 13.35% with a Voc over 0.85 V is one of the best values ever reported in non-fused ring electron acceptors-based binary OSCs. Most importantly, further study showed that the PM6:TPDC-4F exhibited low charge recombination, higher charge mobility with balanced electron and hole transport, superior ordered stacking and optimal blend morphology that allowed the devices to achieve outstanding performance. Overall, our work proves that the electron-deficient diketone central units have great potential for modulating the noncovalent intramolecular interactions to construct high-performance non-fused ring electron acceptors.
