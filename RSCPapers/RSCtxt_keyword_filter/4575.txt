    , Accepted 28th December 2017First published on 28th December 2017AbstractWe designed and synthesized a series of n-type cross-conjugated polymers with a donor–π-bridge–acceptor structure (D–π-bridge–A) which can be used as electron-accepting materials to construct efficient all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The two-dimensional architecture allows for the formation of cross-conjugation, which is favorable for charge carrier transport and light harvesting. Bulk-heterojunction all-PSCs based on these cross-conjugated electron-accepting polymers and PTB7-Th as the electron-donating polymer achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 5.55%. This cross-conjugated architecture provides a new molecular design strategy for n-type conjugated polymers.
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which contain conjugated polymers as both electron-donating and accepting species, have attracted much attention due to their strong light absorption capability at long wavelengths and excellent stability during long-term operation.1–10 Considerable progress has recently been achieved in the development of all-PSCs by selecting polymer donors and acceptors with complementary absorption spectra, appropriate frontier molecular orbitals, and good processability.11,12 To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs have been significantly improved,13–16 with a champion PCE of up to 10% achieved with rationally paired electron-donating and electron-accepting materials, which indicates the great potential of all-PSCs for practical applications. In comparison to versatile electron-donating polymers, even though n-type electron-accepting polymers play an equally important role as electron-donating materials in terms of photovoltaic performance, much less success has been achieved in the development of new n-type conjugated polymers.
Typically, n-type π-conjugated polymers have an entangled backbone that can increase mechanical resilience and improve morphological stability, and thus help them outperform small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors in terms of stability. To achieve efficient polymeric acceptors, a wide range of building blocks such as naphthalene diimide (NDI),1,2,17–19 perylene diimide (PDI),6,20–22 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),23 or aromatic species comprising of B ← N bridged units24 have been incorporated into the linear conjugated backbone. Among these reported n-type polymers, the most widely used is P(NDI2OD-T2) (commercial name: N2200), which has a backbone of alternatively connected NDI and bithiophene. Linear polymer acceptor (PZ1), which is constructed by integrating an n-type non-fullerene acceptor comprising a fused indacenodithiophene and dicyanovinylindan-1-one (ITIC) with a thiophene unit, has been developed recently. This copolymer exhibits a relatively low bandgap that can pair with a wide bandgap electron-donating polymer to yield an impressively high PCE over 9% of the fabricated all-PSC.15
Compared to conjugated polymers with linear geometry, cross-conjugated polymers have a two-dimensional architecture with a broadened absorption band, expanded conjugated plane, and isotropic charge transport, which makes them promising candidates for use as polymer acceptors.25–28 To explore the potential of cross-conjugated n-type polymers in all-PSCs, we designed and synthesized a series of cross-conjugated polymers with a linear main chain and (π-bridge)–A side chains, namely PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT—the NDI serves as the electron-withdrawing unit and two-dimensional benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donating unit. Compared to a linear architecture, this tailored cross-conjugated molecular geometry allows the achievement of high molecular weight without sacrificing good solubility and processability. The resultant polymers were used as electron-acceptors and PTB7-Th as the electron-donating material to fabricate bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs that yielded high short-circuit current densities (JSC) of up to 15.6 mA cm−2 and an impressive PCE of 5.55%. This novel molecular design strategy provides a new guideline for the construction of n-type conjugated polymers for all-PSCs.
The chemical structures of the three polymers are shown in Fig. 1a, and the detailed synthetic procedures are provided in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The target polymers PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT were synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction by treating the precursor polymer PNDI-CHO with 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one, 1,3-diethyl-2-thioxodihydropyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione, and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile, respectively, in the presence of the catalytic amount of pyridine or triethylamine. The chemical structures of the target polymers were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. After Knoevenagel condensation reactions, the chemical shift at 10.17 to 9.94 ppm corresponding to the aromatic aldehyde proton disappeared in the 1H NMR spectra of all three polymers, indicating the complete conversion of the aldehyde moiety in the PNDI-CHO.29–32

All of these copolymers can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer precursor PNDI-CHO and three new polymers PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT and PNDI-IT were estimated to be 42.0, 45.3, 45.2 and 41.2 kDa, respectively, with polydispersity index in the range of 2.0–2.1, as evaluated by gel permission chromatography using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. The Mns of all copolymers are at the same level, because the modification of the polymer side chain will not significantly increase the molecular weight. All three polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability with an onset decomposition temperature of over 370 °C (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). No obvious thermal transition was realized for differential scanning calorimetric measurements up to 250 °C for all three copolymers.
The normalized thin-film UV-vis absorption spectra of the cross-conjugated polymers and polymer donor PTB7-Th are shown in Fig. 1b. The three polymers exhibited broad absorption bands between 350 and 850 nm, which can be attributed to their unique molecular structure of cross-conjugated polymers.33 The absorption profiles of the polymers as thin films are shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†), where the maximum absorption coefficient is 3.6 × 104 cm−1 at 378 nm for PNDI-RDN, 5.3 × 104 cm−1 at 565 nm for PNDI-BBT, and 5.5 × 104 cm−1 at 572 nm for PNDI-IT. Note that PNDI-BBT and PNDI-IT exhibited a slightly higher absorption coefficient than N2200 (4.0 × 104 cm−1), which indicates the improved light-harvesting capability of the former. It is also worth noting that the absorption profiles of the electron-donating polymer PTB7-Th and these resulting electron-accepting copolymers are complementary, which is beneficial for the harvest of solar photons to achieve a high short circuit current density (JSC). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated as −3.85/−5.91 eV, −3.97/−5.89 eV and −3.97/−5.90 eV for PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT, respectively (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Note that PNDI-BBT and PNDI-IT possessed deeper LUMO than PNDI-RDN; this was expected because the acceptor groups in polymer PNDI-BBT and PNDI-IT have stronger electron withdrawing ability than PNDI-RDN.
To investigate the potential photovoltaic applications of these polymer acceptors, all-PSCs with a conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag configuration were fabricated. A device fabricated based on a PNDI-RDN:PTB7-Th (1:1, wt/wt) blend film presented a PCE of 5.55%, with a VOC of 0.69 V, a JSC of 13.51 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 59.83%. A device made from PNDI-BBT exhibited a PCE of 3.96% with a VOC of 0.56 V, a JSC of 14.85 mA cm−2, and an FF of 47.70%. A device based on PNDI-IT as the electron acceptor exhibited a PCE of 5.13% (VOC = 0.56 V, JSC = 15.66 mA cm−2, and FF = 58.56%). Note that these devices were fabricated without the use of solvent additives and without post-treatment at the current stage. Moreover, the obtained VOC of the all-PSCs based on these polymer acceptors was unexpectedly low. For instance, the VOC was only 0.56 V, as obtained from PNDI-BBT and PNDI-IT. Because the VOC can be affected by a range of factors, such as charge recombination, the formation of a ground-state charge transfer state, or a tail state density below the conduction band of the electron donor and the disorder degree of the blend, the reason for the relatively low VOC of these devices is not clear at the moment.34 Moreover, all devices based on these polymer acceptors exhibited relatively high JSC values, which can be attributed to the well-extended absorption band of the polymers and the complementary absorption spectra of the active layer materials.
The hole and electron mobility of the PTB7-Th:acceptor blend films were measured by fabricating single-carrier devices, and the charge carrier mobilities were extracted from the J1/2–V characteristics using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6 and S7 in the ESI†). These BHJ films all showed similar hole mobility, whereas the BHJ layer based on PNDI-IT exhibited the highest electron mobility (μe) of 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than those of the other two copolymers. The relatively low electron mobilities of these copolymers might be related to the lack of pronounced molecular stacking in BHJ films, as can be seen from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. S8, ESI†). Moreover, the relatively low electron mobilities are consistent with the obtained JSC trend of the resulting devices (Table 1).

It is also worthy of note that the JSC obtained from PNDI-IT:PTB7-Th is higher than that of the N2200:PTB7-Th system.1,35 The PNDI-RDN-based devices exhibited a higher VOC than the PNDI-BBT-based and PNDI-IT-based devices, which agrees with the relatively higher LUMO energy level of PNDI-RDN. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured and the EQE spectra were in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from J–V measurements (Fig. 2b). The device based on PNDI-IT exhibited a stronger and broader photocurrent response from 300 to 850 nm than the other two copolymers, which was associated with the maximum EQE over 65%; this result agrees with the finding that PNDI-IT had the highest JSC.
 Fig. 2  (a) J–V characteristics and (b) EQE spectra of the all-PSCs. 
To study the charge generation process in the resulting bulk-heterojunction films, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra using the neat PTB7-Th film and the polymer blend films (Fig. 3). When using the excitation wavelength of 680 nm, the PL emissions of PTB7-Th were dramatically quenched in the BHJ films. The PL emission of PTB7-Th quenched 96.0% in the PNDI-IT:PTB7-Th blend film, which is more pronounced than those of the other two systems (95.5% for PNDI-BBT:PTB7-Th and 92.2% for PNDI-RDN:PTB7-Th). These findings indicate more efficient charge separation in the PNDI-IT-based devices, which is in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from all-PSCs devices. Moreover, to investigate the charge recombination process, we measured the JSC, VOC, and FF versus light intensity (Plight) characteristics for all-PSCs devices; the relevant characteristics are shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that the S value of the PNDI-IT-based device was calculated to be 0.976, which is slightly higher than the values of 0.975 and 0.952 for PNDI-RDN and PNDI-BBT, respectively, indicating the lower charge recombination of the PNDI-IT-based device.36,37 From the VOC–Plight characteristic (Fig. 4b), we calculated the slope of nkT/q in the plot of VOCversus the natural logarithm of Plight, where if n equals one this implies predominantly bimolecular recombination, and an enhanced dependence of VOC on Plight (2kT/q) is a signature of trap-assisted monomolecular recombination.38 The calculated slopes were 1.26, 1.32, and 1.27kT/q for devices based on PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT, respectively. The higher slope value of PNDI-BBT than for the other two copolymers suggests more pronounced trap-assisted recombination, thus resulting in a lower FF. The FF–Plight characteristics (Fig. 4c) present a general trend in which the FF increased as Plight decreased for all devices, which is as expected due to the reduced charge density. In the low Plight regime, the device based on PNDI-IT exhibited a higher FF than the other devices, which indicated weaker bimolecular recombination in the PNDI-IT-based device.

The BHJ morphology of polymer blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the corresponding images are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values measured from the topographic images were 0.99, 1.18, and 1.01 nm for blend films of PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT, respectively. All blend films were observed to exhibit uniform morphology without large-scale phase separation, which can promote efficient charge separation and thus lead to high current density.
In summary, three new n-type cross-conjugated polymers (PNDI-RDN, PNDI-BBT, and PNDI-IT) with donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π-bridge–A) side chains have been designed and synthesized. The optophysical properties and energy levels of these polymers can be readily tuned by changing pendant acceptor groups in the side chains. These cross-conjugated polymers can be used as polymer acceptors in BHJ all-PSCs, which presented relatively high short circuit current densities. An impressive power conversion efficiency of up to 5.55% was achieved by pairing PNDI-RDN with the electron-donating polymer PTB7-Th. Our results indicate that this new molecular design strategy involving cross-conjugated molecular architecture can be applied to construct new conjugated polymer acceptors for high-performance all-PSCs.
