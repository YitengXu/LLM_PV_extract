1. Introduction
Multifunctional materials have recently become a preferred choice in the scientific community due to their application in various fields, such as energy conversion and storage, catalysis, and medicine.1,2 These materials possess specific characteristics that are useful for various applications. This versatile nature of the materials results in the growth of economical and sustainable energy pathways for sustainable development.3 In addition, it enables efficient processes, reduces the cost of synthesis and fabrication, reduces environmental hazards, lowers power consumption, etc.4 To avail these features, researchers have been developing novel materials which can demonstrate various applications by their fascinating physicochemical properties.5 A material should possess a suitable crystal structure, morphology, higher electrical conductivity, suitable optical bandgap and wettability to be considered versatile. In addition, a layered structure can facilitate the versatility of a material due to its advantages, such as two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like morphology, structural and morphological tuning ability and increased electrochemical and photochemical performance.6 Materials like transition metal oxides, sulfides, phosphates, nitrides, and carbonaceous compounds have demonstrated promising multifunctionality. For instance, non-noble metal oxide nanoparticles have been used as a versatile material for overall water splitting.7 In another case, a NiCo2S4@graphene composite has been used for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.8 Out of these versatile materials, Mo and W-based dichalcogenides have gained considerable attention for numerous applications due to their layered structures and exfoliable nature. Layered 2D materials possess promising physicochemical properties that are prerequisites for a material to be multifunctional.9,10
Mo and W-based dichalcogenides belong to the family of LMDs with general structural formula MX2 where M = transition metals like Mo, W, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, etc. and X= S, Se and Te and possess the crystal structure with two dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional stacked layers perpendicular to the direction of layers as shown in Fig. 1A.11,12 The LMDs comprise a large number of compounds in which metal dichalcogenides from group VI (specifically Mo and W) of the periodic table possess fascinating features in terms of their excellent physicochemical properties such as the 2D structure, high intrinsic electrical conductivity, and large interlayer spacing that make them largely employable in almost all applications.13 These group VI LMDs can occur in one of the three phases, 1T, 2H and 3R, where the 1T phase is metallic and 2H and 3R phases are semiconducting in nature.14 Here the letters T, H and R represent trigonal, hexagonal and rhombohedral structures and the numbers 1, 2 and 3 resemble the number of layers in a unit cell, respectively.15 The group VI metals, Mo and W-based compounds, are preferred over other transition metals due to their excellent electrical conductivity.16 W and Mo chalcogenides possess layered structures analogous to graphene, which has opened a new door to synthesize nanotubes or fullerene-like structures of WS2 or MoS2.17 In addition, unlike graphene, WS2 and MoS2 possess definite bandgaps, which extend their use in microelectronics and miniaturized devices.18 Unlike bulk materials, monolayers of MoS2 and WS2 exhibit a direct bandgap, making them promising candidates for photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.19–21 As a result, MoS2 and WS2 have been considerably explored for various applications.15–18,22,23 This inspires researchers to explore the performance of other W and Mo dichalcogenides, including MoSe2, MoTe2, WSe2 and WTe2 for various applications.16

It is well reported in the literature that TMDs can be synthesized using various synthesis routes. Thermal sulfurization of metals or metal oxides has been a favorable choice due to its ease of synthesis. However, chemical or physical vapor deposition has also been widely used to synthesize TMDs. Though the above-mentioned vapor-based methods of preparing nanomaterials give precise control over particle dimensions and morphologies, they are relatively expensive and require sophisticated instrumentation, which limits industrial-scale production. In addition, vapor-based methods operate at high energy as well as temperature, which increases the cost of synthesis and reduces efficiency. On the other hand, solution-based methods have been largely employed for the synthesis of bulk materials and thin films as well as for the exfoliation of layered materials. CBD, SILAR, hydrothermal method and electrodeposition have proven advantageous over vapor-based methods. These methods provide access to control the preparative parameters of the chemical reactions that ultimately tune the structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of the materials.24,25 Moreover, solution-based methods are low cost, provide high yield, and do not need a vacuum, an environment-friendly and relatively low-temperature method. These features offer varieties of cost-effective synthesis strategies for the various nanostructured materials. Therefore, it is crucial to summarize the status of work done in group VI TMDs using solution-based deposition techniques to find the loopholes limiting the synthesis of TMDs using solution-based methods. However, it is important to understand that the flexibility obtained during chemical reactions can help researchers to tune the physicochemical properties of LMDs that can be used for various applications.26
Few reviews are available in the literature describing the applicability of group VI LMDs synthesized by vapor-based methods for different applications. However, few focus on specific applications and some focus on selected chalcogenides.11,12 This leaves a gap in exploring the versatility of group VI LMDs for various applications. This report bridges the gap between specific applications and material perspectives and summarizes the versatility of group VI LMDs for multiple applications.
This review focuses on the solution-based deposition strategies used for LMDs, the various fascinating properties of LMDs as well as their versatility for various applications. Though chalcogenides include O, S, Se and Te, the oxides of Mo and W i.e., thin films of MoO3 and WO3 are not included in this study because considerable work has been done on these materials.27,28 These thin films are largely explored for various applications. Conversely, thin films of other chalcogens of Mo and W i.e., MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, and WTe2 have negligible reports. The research on LMDs using solution-based deposition techniques, the obtained results and their reasoning is well summarized. Some highly explored applications are considered in this review including supercapacitors, batteries, photocatalytic dye degradation, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
2. Synthesis
It is well known that deposition techniques are broadly divided into two major categories, viz. solution-based and vapor-based deposition techniques.5,29 Whereas solution-based deposition techniques are efficient in terms of low power consumption and low-temperature requirement, vapor-based deposition methods are way costlier, making the synthesis process inefficient. Solution-based deposition methods allow access to tune the physicochemical properties of the material. This results in the enhanced performance of the material. This section briefly describes the solution-based deposition methods employed for the deposition of group VI LMDs.
2.1. CBD
The CBD (Fig. 1B) method is often used for synthesizing various nanostructured metal dichalcogenides. It involves controlled precipitation that initiates the heterogeneous nucleation on the substrate surface immersed in the chemical bath. When the ionic product of the reactants exceeds the solubility product of the solution, precipitation occurs and ions start to combine on the substrate that initiates the film formation.30 It is evident that solubility depends on several factors, such as the temperature of the solution, solvent and particle size. So, optimizing the deposition parameters for obtaining good quality and adherent thin films is essential. The quality of thin films depends on several parameters like pH, the concentration of precursor, complexing agent, temperature of the solution, deposition time and type of substrate.31 The importance of this deposition technique is that one can easily control preparative parameters to alter the material properties. The disadvantage of this method is the unavoidable precipitation when an ionic product exceeds the solubility product, which sometimes results in material loss.
Few reports suggest the applicability of the CBD technique for the deposition of group VI LMDs. For instance, Hankare et al. have reported the synthesis of WS2 using the CBD method.32 Sodium tungstate, sodium thiosulfate, hydrazine hydrate (HH) and citric acid were used as precursors for W and S ions, reducing and complexing agents, respectively. This solution was mixed in a water bath at 70 °C for 2 hours to obtain adherent thin films of WS2. Similarly, amorphous MoS2 was prepared by Pujari et al. using ammonium molybdate and thioacetamide as sources of Mo and S ions, respectively.33 Then 1 M H2SO4 was added into this solution and the solution was kept at 30 °C for 5 hours. The above reports highlight the effectiveness of the CBD method for depositing LMDs.
2.2. SILAR
SILAR, a modified CBD method, is one of the useful synthesis methods for depositing thin films of various nanomaterials. In CBD, when an ionic product exceeds the solubility product, precipitation takes place. This problem is resolved in the SILAR method by separating cationic and ionic solutions, thus avoiding precipitation, as shown in Fig. 1C.26 The SILAR method involves four steps, viz. adsorption, first rinsing, reaction and second rinsing. One can employ a two-beaker or three-beaker system instead of a four-beaker system by removing rinsing steps as convenient. Dipping and rinsing times can be optimized to obtain good-quality adherent thin films. Most importantly, the thickness of the film can be well controlled by varying deposition cycles. The concentration of the cationic and anionic solutions, pH, dipping and rinsing time, and number of deposition cycles affect the film formation. The SILAR method is advantageous in terms of its low cost, large area deposition, use of a variety of substrates and room temperature (RT) deposition, etc.34 As a result, a number of metal chalcogenides have been deposited using the SILAR method. However, in a SILAR, the growth process is hindered at every cycle, leading to low crystallinity of the deposited materials.
Sartale et al. deposited MoS2 using the SILAR method at RT.35 In a typical synthesis, ammonium molybdate is used as a cationic source, and sodium sulfide as an anionic source. The deposition was obtained by dipping glass substrates in a cationic and anionic solution for 25 s. After each dipping, the substrates were rinsed in DDW for 30 s. 100 cycles were repeated to deposit the MoS2 thin film.
2.3. Hydrothermal
The hydrothermal method resembles the chemical reaction carried out in a closed vessel at high temperature and pressure. This method offers controlled diffusivity in a closed chamber.36 The hydrothermal method is well known for obtaining various types of morphologies. Different surfactant-assisted chemical reactions result in distinct surface energies of the material. The main advantage of this method is that synthesis of the materials with high vapor pressure can be deposited using the hydrothermal method.37 To carry out hydrothermal synthesis, a Teflon container placed inside a sealed steel chamber is used as shown in Fig. 1D. This system is then put in an autoclave or furnace to heat at the desired temperature. This method is widely used to obtain nanomaterials with controlled sizes and shapes.38 Though the hydrothermal method offers many advantages, the high operating temperature, prolonged deposition time, and uncontrolled particle size are its few limitations.
Senthilkumar et al. deposited a marigold flower-like nanostructure of MoS2 on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a one-step hydrothermal method.39 These films were deposited at different sodium molybdate and thioacetamide molar concentrations. After mixing, the solution was kept in a Teflon lined stainless steel (SS) autoclave unit at 200 °C for 15 hours.
2.4. Electrodeposition
Electrodeposition is a renowned method for depositing thin films of material by providing electrical bias to a conducting substrate immersed in the solution containing a salt of that material.40 This technique has recently gained enormous attention due to its simplicity of deposition mechanism. When the conducting substrate is immersed in the electrolyte containing cations and anions to be coated and potential is applied across the electrode–electrolyte interface, charge transfer takes place followed by film deposition. For electrodeposition, a DC power source or electrochemical workstation can be used that benefits excellent control over deposition potential, which is the driving force of the electrodeposition reaction.41 The schematic illustration of the electrodeposition method is displayed in Fig. 1E. Though the electrodeposition offers several advantages, the requirement of conducting substrates and sophisticated deposition assembly (potentiostat) are the limiting factors. Moreover, single-phase multicomponent materials are difficult to deposit by this method.
Jana et al. synthesized polycrystalline WS2 by an electrodeposition method using sodium tungstate and thioacetamide as the precursor solutions.42 A three-electrode system was employed for the electrochemical deposition of WS2 on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique was used for the deposition in the potential window of 0 to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. A sharp increase in the cathodic current confirmed the film formation. On the other hand, Anand et al. cathodically deposited MoSe2 thin films on an ITO-coated conducting glass substrate using a mixture of H2MoO4 and SeO2.43 The potential of −0.9 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was applied and the bath temperature was maintained at 40 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the formation of a polycrystalline MoSe2 thin film.
2.5. Dip coating
Fig. 1F shows a schematic of the dip coating technique, which is being used worldwide at the industrial scale due to its simple and straightforward application for the deposition of various nanostructured thin films. The dip coating process comprised dipping a substrate at a controlled speed in the colloidal suspension containing material to be deposited. Another critical factor in the dip coating is the retrieval speed of the substrate from the solution.44 Once optimized, this method can be used to deposit highly uniform and adherent thin films. Atmospheric temperature, airflow, and surrounding cleanliness are the influencing factors for the dip coating method. This method is beneficial for materials that possess thickness-dependent properties as this method favors thickness control. Though this method offers precise thickness control, each deposition cycle of dip coating requires a long time.
Chate et al. have employed a dip coating technique for depositing WS2 thin films using sodium tungstate and thiourea, succinic acid and HH as precursors for W and S ions, complexing and reducing agents, respectively.45 The solution was first put in an ice bath and then the temperature was allowed to reach RT. Furthermore, the formation of WS2 was confirmed using the XRD technique.
As per the discussion above, it is clear that the solution-based deposition methods have proved to be widely applicable for the deposition of various nanostructured metal chalcogenides. However, reports on the solution-based deposition of group VI LMDs are scarcely found as compared to that of other metal chalcogenides. The lesser investigation of group VI LMDs by solution-based deposition methods may be because of the complex chemistry of W, as to synthesize W chalcogenides, one needs to reduce the W+6 to W+4, which is not that easy because W can be reduced only by strong reducing agents like HH or it needs a complex experimental setup for the reduction using hydrogen.46 But, HH is highly carcinogenic, restricting its use in many labs. On the other hand, sulfurization of WO3 in a tube furnace gives highly crystalline WS2. This is one of the reasons behind the lesser investigation of W-based chalcogenides. In the case of MoS2, it possesses lower crystallinity due to the tensile stress, which results in either the amorphous or nanocrystalline nature of the synthesized thin films. As a result, it becomes challenging to identify the phase formation in the synthesized materials using XRD.47 In this case, thermal sulfurization or hydrothermal synthesis at temperatures higher than 200 °C can result in the formation of crystalline MoS2. These reasons might have caused the research community to use the CVD method to synthesize group VI LMDs. However, CVD is an expensive technique and needs sophisticated instrumentation. On the other hand, solution-based methods offer various advantages over CVD for synthesizing thin films. With an appropriate understanding of the chemistry of Mo and W, it is possible to obtain thin films of group VI LMDs using solution-based deposition techniques.
3. Properties
Group VI LMDs possess some fascinating properties that make them a versatile material. The unique structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of group VI LMDs advances their utilization in various applications. This section discusses the fascinating physicochemical properties of group VI LMDs.
3.1. Structure
Group VI LMDs are layered materials in which each layer comprises Mo or W atoms sandwiched between chalcogens bonded by strong covalent bonds. In contrast, these layers are bonded to each other by weak van der Waals force. The weak van der Waals force allows easy chemical or mechanical exfoliation of group VI LMDs. The group VI LMDs can crystallize in 1T, 2H, or 3R crystal structures depending on the synthesis protocols.48 The multiple polymorphs can be beneficial in order to achieve enhanced performance of the material as shown by Lokhande et al.49 The solution-based deposited MoS2 possesses low crystallinity due to the internal stress, whereas WS2 exhibits a polycrystalline nature. This underscores that the solution-based methods benefit in terms of synthesizing amorphous as well as polycrystalline group VI LMDs materials whose crystallinity can be enhanced by post-annealing treatment as per the requirement.
3.2. Morphology
Morphology plays a vital role in determining the applicability of material for almost every application. Different architecture formation through material engineering is considered one of the effective ways to achieve enhanced performance. The morphology of the final product is highly dependent on the synthesis method as well as its parameters. Group VI LMDs exhibited various morphologies ranging from spherical to rod-like to plate-like structures. One outstanding property of group VI LMDs is their layered structure which facilitates ion intercalation-deintercalation into its layered structure during electrochemical activity, which ultimately enhances its electrode performance.50 In addition, spherical morphology possesses a higher surface area that helps to enhance the catalytic activity. Hence, it is important to obtain the desired morphology depending upon an application. The hydrothermal method is the best choice for synthesizing group VI LMDs with various morphologies.
3.3. Electrical
The electrical property of a certain material decides its applicability for applications such as in supercapacitors, batteries, and the HER. Hence, a material should possess higher electrical conductivity to achieve better electrochemical performance. Group VI LMDs quite fulfill this requirement due to their higher conductivity as well as multiple oxidation states, which show promising energy storage as well as electrocatalytic properties.16
3.4. Optical
Group VI LMDs possess excellent optical properties due to their semiconducting nature with the optimum bandgap resulting in optical absorption ranging from the visible to near-infrared region. The semiconducting properties of group VI LMDs are due to their fully filled lowest-lying d-band.51 In addition, they exhibit indirect and direct bandgaps in their bulk and monolayer forms, respectively, making them a favorable choice for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic applications.
It can be seen that LMDs possess interesting properties that are prerequisites for multiple applications. Other properties such as higher surface area, 2D structure, exfoliable nature and suitable band positions make them advantageous to be multifunctional. One can tune the above properties by choosing the appropriate deposition technique to obtain the required results.
4. Applications
A multifunctional aspect of a material implies its use in more than one application which proves the efficient processing as well as maximum utilization of the resources to obtain higher output. This entirely depends on the exploration of the properties of the synthesized material. Based on the properties, the material can be used for various applications. This section discusses the applications of solution-based deposited LMDs with the obtained results and underlying mechanisms.
4.1. Supercapacitor
Among all the energy storage devices, supercapacitors have attracted a great deal of research interest due to their excellent characteristics like long cycle life, high power density, better energy density, and environmental friendliness.
Pujari et al. synthesized MoS2 thin films on SS substrates and evaluated their electrochemical activity for supercapacitor application.33 The optimized MoS2 electrode exhibited a better specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 with 82% stability retention over 1000 charge–discharge cycles. As presented in Fig. 2A, the area under the CV curve and cathodic as well as anodic peak currents are increased with increasing scan rate, which proves the capacitive nature of MoS2 electrodes. Additionally, the obtained CV curves showed a quasi rectangular shape without any intense redox peaks suggesting the EDLC type nature of MoS2. Furthermore, due to reversible reactions of Mo; deviation in the CV curve is observed. Among different polymorphs of MoS2, 1T is known for its high electrical conductivity. Though it is difficult to obtain the 1T structure using a solution-based method, Niu et al. demonstrated a 3D architecture network to increase electrochemical performance using mixed phase 1T–2H MoS2.52 In this study, a hydrothermal approach is used to synthesize a few layered 1T–2H MoS2 heterostructures on carbon nanofibers (CF), which showed a well-aligned 3D structure. The presence of 1T and 2H phases is confirmed using the HR-TEM image as shown in Fig. 2B. The enhanced interlayer distance from 0.62 nm to 0.68 nm occurred due to the presence of the 1T phase resulting in ion diffusion as well as transportation which can be seen in an increased area under the CV curve compared with that of pristine MoS2 as shown in Fig. 2C. As a result, it showed a specific capacitance of 310 F g−1 with 78% rate capability in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Conducting polymers have been proven to be a potential candidate for supercapacitor application as they possess a large specific capacitance. Tian et al. fabricated MoS2/conducting polymer (CP) composites using polypyrrole (PPy) on CF substrates using a hydrothermal method followed by a coating of polymer nanoparticles on as-synthesized MoS2 using an electrodeposition method with various scan rates (10 and 20 mV s−1 named as MP-10 and MP-20, respectively).56 The schematic representation of the MoS2/CP composite is shown in Fig. 2D. The obtained results are compared with pristine PPy, MoS2, and CF. The enhancement upon hybridization is seen from the CV and EIS curves as displayed in Fig. 2E and F, respectively. The optimized MoS2/CP composite demonstrated the specific capacitance of 613 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Additionally, it showed excellent stability retention of 98% during 8500 charge–discharge cycles. Other reports of MoS2 and its composites synthesized using other solution-based deposition techniques and their supercapacitor performances are tabulated in Table 1.

MoSe2 also belongs to group VI LMDs, which possess good electrical conductivity and a more metallic nature, making them suitable candidates for electrochemical and electrocatalytic applications. In one instance, MoSe2 nanosheets were grown on nickel foam by Mariappan et al. using an electrodeposition technique for different deposition times viz. 5 and 10 minutes (denoted as MoSe2/Ni-5 and MoSe2/Ni-10, respectively) for supercapacitor application.60 As shown in Fig. 2G, the MoSe2/Ni-10 electrode shows a 10-fold increase in current density compared with that of the MoSe2/Ni-5 electrode with a maximum specific capacity of 548 mA h g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with good stability retention of 82%. The enhanced performance is attributed to the uniform deposition as well as increased mass loading due to prolonged deposition time. The solvothermal method has been employed by Pazhamalai et al. for the synthesis of MoSe2 powder to fabricate coin cells using polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene/tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (PVDF-co-HFP/TEABF4) ion gelled polyvinylidene fluoride/sodium niobate (PVDF/NaNbO3) as the piezopolymer electrolyte. The coin cell exhibited a specific capacitance of 18.93 mF cm−2 at the constant discharge current of 0.5 mA with a specific energy of 37.90 mJ cm−2 and specific power of 268.91 μW cm−2. The obtained excellent performance may be due to the intercalative nature of MoSe2, porous web-like structured electrospun PVDF/NaNbO3, and ionogel electrolyte.61
WS2 is a preferred choice for various applications due to its excellent structural, electrical and optical properties. For example, Liu et al. synthesized WS2 thin films on carbon cloth (CC) using a hydrothermal process and applied them for flexible asymmetric supercapacitor electrodes.62 In this study, the crystallinity of the WS2 electrode was improved by post-annealing at 300 °C for 2 hours under an Ar atmosphere (denoted as A-WS2). The improved crystallinity with expanded lattice fringes is clearly observable in HR-TEM images as shown in Fig. 3B as compared to pristine WS2 (Fig. 3A). A-WS2 showed a maximum areal capacitance of 0.93 F cm−2 at a current density of 4 mA cm−2 with superior cyclability as shown in Fig. 3C (80% over 10000 cycles). Along with the hydrothermal method, the solvothermal method is also a useful technique for the deposition of thin films. Shang et al. employed a solvothermal method for the deposition of interwoven WS2 nanoplates on carbon fiber cloth (CFC).63 It was observed that the WS2 thin film deposited on CFC exhibited a high electrochemical performance compared to pristine bulk WS2, which was attributed to the excellent conductivity of the former. The SEM micrograph (Fig. 3D) of pristine bulk WS2 revealed that several WS2 nanosheets are stacked randomly, preventing easy ion transport and poor electrical conductivity.

Conversely, interwoven WS2 nanoplates were uniformly spread onto the surface of CFC, which enhanced the surface area resulting in improved ion transport (Fig. 3E). The increased electrical conductivity results in the increased area under the CV curves as shown in Fig. 3F as well as a nearly straight line in the low-frequency region of the Nyquist plot (Fig. 3G). The fitted equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 3G.
Though WS2 as a single material has demonstrated good electrochemical performance, its composite with a suitable material resulted in enhanced performance. For example, nanorice-like CuS@WS2 heterostructures were deposited on nickel foam and its performance was compared with pristine CuS and WS2 by Prasanna et al. using the CBD method and employed for supercapacitor application.65 As shown in the CV curves, the CuS@WS2 electrode demonstrated better electrode performance compared to bare CuS and WS2 (Fig. 4A). The synergistic effect of CuS and WS2 resulted in enhanced redox reactions. The CuS@WS2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 887.15 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with an energy density of 19.16 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1. It should be noted that the variation in morphology can play an important role in the performance of the electrode. For example, Anitha et al. employed a two-step hydrothermal route to synthesize cauliflower-like ZnWO4@WS2 on nickel foam.66

The supercapacitor based on the ZnWO4@WS2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 1280.7 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1. The enhanced supercapacitive performance obtained for hybrids was due to the increased surface area, rapid ion diffusion rate and electron transfer rate. The bare ZnWO4and ZnWO4@WS2 exhibited a surface area of 34.07 and 72.27 m2 g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4B. The vertical straight line observed at the low-frequency region was attributed to the excellent capacitive behavior of the ZnWO4@WS2 electrode compared to ZnWO4 (Fig. 4C). The choice of material for compositing is one of the major factors which decide the performance of the resultant material. A suitable choice of composition can give a relatively higher performance in terms of enhanced specific capacitance as well as increased stability. For instance, Krishna et al. have deposited CoS@WS2 nanocomposites on NF using the hydrothermal route and used them as supercapacitor electrodes.67 The CoS@WS2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 2442.32 F g−1 at 4.28 A g−1 with excellent stability retention of 97.16% over 3000 charge-discharge cycles. The stability retention plot of CoS, WS2 and CoS@WS2 electrodes is shown in Fig. 4D. The enhanced performance of the composite was attributed to structural stability, enhanced conductivity and easy charge transport. Table 1 summarizes the supercapacitor application studied using solution-based deposited group VI LMDs.
4.2. Rechargeable batteries
To overcome the major energy issues such as depleting conventional resources, seasonal occurrence of renewable sources and their environmental impact, battery is the most promising electrochemical energy storage device, which has high energy density compared to supercapacitors. Along with supercapacitors, group VI LMDs have also been employed to study their application in the battery field. Out of which few reports are discussed in this section.
The electrochemical properties of hydrothermally deposited MoS2 nanosheet electrodes on CC have been investigated by Wang et al. using Na–O2 batteries.69 The schematic of deposition is shown in Fig. 5A. It shows an enhanced discharge capacity of 1.55 mA h cm−2 when compared to CC. In addition, the electrode has exhibited improved oxygen evolution and reduction reactions attributed to the higher catalytic activity of the MoS2/CC cathode. The capacity comparison plot of CC and MoS2/CC is represented in Fig. 5B. Similarly, Wang et al. have fabricated MoS2/Li2S composite electrodes by depositing MoS2 on CC and further electrodepositing Li2S on the surface of MoS2 for lithium–sulfur (Li–S) as displayed schematically in Fig. 5C.70 The composite electrode has demonstrated an excellent Li–S battery performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1238 mA h g−1. The MoS2/CC electrode exhibited an improved initial reversible capacity of 1176 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 87% after 160 cycles as compared to CC. Fig. 5D represents the cyclic stability of pristine MoS2/CC and MoS2/Li2S composite electrodes.

Different supports for the growth of MoS2 show different results. For example, Ma et al. fabricated the electrodes of MoS2 nanosheets coated carbonized corn stalks (CCS) using the hydrothermal method and used it as an anode for lithium-ion batteries.71 A schematic representation of the synthesis route of MoS2/CCS is shown in Fig. 6A. The structure of MoS2/CCS is advantageous for easy ion and electron transport during electrochemical reactions.

To avoid the decomposition of an electrode at high current density and cycling stability, CCS acts as a substrate for the growth of MoS2 nanosheets. As the anode for Li-ion batteries, the MoS2/CCS electrode has exhibited a specific capacity of 1409.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Fig. 6B shows the long-term cycling stability of the MoS2/CCS electrode, which reveals excellent retention of the MoS2/CCS electrode. Apart from MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2 nanosheets have also been employed for rechargeable batteries. For instance, Zhang et al. deposited MoSe2 nanosheets on the CC using a solvothermal approach and applied them as an electrode for sodium-ion batteries.72 The MoSe2/CC anode demonstrated superior electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 452.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Epitaxial MoTe2 thin films with distinct morphologies have been electrodeposited on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) by Kim et al. to evaluate their electrochemical performance.73 The coin cell device based on the MoTe2 anode demonstrated an excellent Li-ion storage ability with a discharging capacity of 770 mA h g−1, as shown in Fig. 6C. The enhanced electrochemical performance of MoTe2 anode is attributed to the single crystal formation. The cycling performance of the MoTe2 anode is shown in Fig. 6D, revealing excellent electrochemical stability. Table 2 shows the performance of solution-based deposited group VI LMDs for battery applications.

4.3. Electrocatalytic HER
The energy crisis and constantly deteriorating environmental conditions due to climate change are the two major challenges that humanity is facing currently. One of the efficient ways to overcome these issues is the use of renewable energy sources, but most of the renewable energy sources are interrupted due to seasonal factors. Therefore, it is essential to look towards an alternative renewable energy source that is uninterrupted. Hydrogen (H2) is considered a clean energy source and a solution for the current energy crisis. One of the ways to produce H2 is electrolysis of water in which water splits into H2 and O2 over a catalyst surface at an applied potential.
Vikraman et al. deposited thickness controlled bi- to few-layered MoS2 quantum dot (QD) thin films on ITO and Au/Si substrates using a facile CBD route by varying the concentrations of Mo precursor and utilized them for electrocatalytic HER activity in aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte.74 Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the number of layers in the prepared samples as shown in Fig. 7A. The difference between two characteristic phonon modes A1g and E2g changes was found to be 21.76, 22.38, 23.07 and 23.98 cm−1 for MoS2 QD prepared at the deposition times of 2, 5, 8 and 10 minutes revealing the formation of bi-layer, tri-layer, tetra-layer and few layers of MoS2 QD, respectively. Among all the prepared electrodes, MoS2 QD thin films coated on Au/Si substrates with a concentration of 30 μM have shown superior electrocatalytic HER performance with an overpotential of 130 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 94 mV dec−1. The comparative LSV curves for MoS2 QD deposited at various concentrations are displayed in Fig. 7B. Similar to MoS2, other TMDs have been grown and employed for the electrocatalytic HER. For instance, MoSe2 thin films have been grown on FTO substrates by Barough et al. using a hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment and the effect of annealing temperature on the electrocatalytic HER performance of MoSe2 electrodes has been investigated.75 A schematic of the H2 production at the edges of MoSe2 is shown in Fig. 7C. It has been observed that the low crystalline MoS2 sheets possess abundant electrocatalytic active sites on the edges of the nanosheets, resulting in enhanced HER performance. The LSV curves of MoSe2 prepared at different Se concentrations is shown in Fig. 7D. The optimized MoSe2 electrode demonstrated superior HER activity with an overpotential of 107 mV at 10 mA cm−2.

The new synthetic approach for the synthesis of WS2 triangular nanoplate thin films from WO3/CC has been developed by Liu et al. and the synthesized electrodes were utilized to study the electrocatalytic HER performance in a wide range of pH, from acidic to alkaline.76
Initially, WO3 thin films were coated on CC using a facile hydrothermal method. Afterward, the obtained WO3/CC was calcined at higher temperatures under a sulfur atmosphere which resulted in the sulfurization of WO3 to form WS2/CC to form triangular nanoplates as confirmed by the TEM image shown in Fig. 7E. Furthermore, the effect of sulfurization temperature on the electrocatalytic HER performance has been studied. The comparative LSV curves of WS2/CC annealed at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 7F. The outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance with an overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm−2 has been obtained for the optimized WS2/CC thin film in the alkaline electrolyte. Zhu et al. have prepared WS2 nanosheets on CC substrate using a hydrothermal method followed by thermal treatment in a Ar-H2 atmosphere and used for electrocatalytic HER.77 The fabricated WS2 electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with an overpotential and Tafel slope of 116 mV and 37.9 mV dec−1, respectively. The long-term stability of WS2 has been examined with chronoamperometric measurements carried out at the overpotential of 230 mV. It has been observed that the current density of the WS2 electrode has remained almost constant for 24 hours, which strongly suggests its excellent stability for electrocatalysis. Table 3 displays various parameters used in the HER study by solution-based deposited group VI LMDs.

4.4. PEC cells
To meet the ever-increasing demand of sustainable energy, PEC cell water splitting is one of the most prominent ways to generate electrical energy from solar energy, in which chemical energy is converted into electrical energy via redox reactions in the presence of light energy. When solar light is shone on the photoelectrode, the chemical interactions between the photoelectrode and electrolyte lead to the generation of H2 and O2. Few reports are available on solution-based deposited group VI LMDs for PEC application as discussed below.
Xu et al. deposited MoS2 thin films on CFC substrates with and without Au coating (MoS2/Au@CFC and MoS2/CFC) using the hydrothermal method and used them as the photoelectrodes in the PEC cell.78 The optimized MoS2/Au@CFC photoelectrode has shown superior PEC activity with a photocurrent density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in the KH2PO4 electrolyte. The LSV curves and Nyquist plot for MoS2/Au@CFC and MoS2/CFC photoelectrodes under light and dark conditions are represented in Fig. 8A and B, respectively. The enhanced PEC cell performance obtained for MoS2/Au@CFC has been attributed to the reduced electron–hole recombination and is explained on the basis of band diagrams under light and dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 8C and D. Ag coating was found to be helpful for band positioning which reduces electron hole recombination rate, thus increasing PEC performance. Another way to improve PEC performance is the coating of highly conducting material that helps to enhance the charge transfer process. This study has been carried out by Ali et al. using Au nanorods and Au nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets deposited on FTO substrates via a hydrothermal method followed by spin coating techniques and their PEC cell water splitting characteristics have been investigated.79 It has been observed that the PEC cell performance of pristine MoS2 has improved with Au coating due to enhanced charge transfer kinetics at the surface. The Au–MoS2 photoanode has shown improved PEC cell activity in KH2PO4 electrolyte with a photocurrent density of 6.5 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. SCE. Similarly, the PEC cell characteristics of CBD-grown WS2 thin films have been studied in iodine–iodide electrolyte by Chate et al.80 In addition, the electrical properties of WS2 thin films have been investigated with a two-probe method. It has been observed that as the temperature increases, the conductivity of the film also increases, which proves its semiconducting nature. The WS2 photoelectrode has demonstrated superior PEC cell characteristics (Voc = 428 mV and Isc = 0.367 mA) with a power conversion efficiency of 1.29%. Similarly, a flower-like WSe2/CdS structure has been developed with a simple CBD method and its PEC cell properties have been studied with current density-voltage measurements by Guerrero et al.81 The fabricated hybrid photoelectrode has exhibited a better photo response (Voc = 180 mV and Isc = 0.07 mA) with a fill factor of 0.22. Table 4 summarizes useful parameters used to study PEC properties of solution-based deposited group VI LMDs.

4.5. Photocatalytic dye degradation
Organic dyes have huge applications in numerous industries. Mainly, textile industries use a large amount of dye for coloring purposes. Dyes, after their use, have directly been sent into the mainstream water sources causing tremendous amounts of water pollution and in turn several diseases in aquatic life as well as humans. In this context, photocatalytic dye degradation can be an effective strategy for reducing water pollution. In this process, photogenerated electron–hole pairs and free radicals generated due to photo-oxidation and photo-reduction react with dye molecules and break them into small, less toxic fragments.
Phung et al. reported the synthesis of MoS2 thin film using the CBD method on dip-coated TiO2 film. MoS2 deposition was carried out at different deposition times viz. 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes denoted as MT-15, MT-30, MT-45 and MT-60 respectively.82 The effect of deposition time for the deposition of MoS2 has been studied by varying the deposition time from 15 to 60 minutes. The visible light absorption of the MoS2/TiO2 thin films has been increased with deposition time as shown in Fig. 9A. In this study, MoS2, deposited for 45 minutes (MT-45), has shown a higher photocatalytic performance than the films deposited for different times. MT-45 has degraded a methylene blue (MB) solution with a degradation efficiency of 60% in 150 minutes under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 9B, all the heterostructures have shown a higher photocatalytic performance than their counterparts, including TiO2 and MoS2. The observed higher performance has been attributed to the efficient absorption of a broad solar spectrum as well as the effective electron transfer.

Fabrication of a ternary compound can be an effective strategy for enhanced photocatalytic dye degradation. A freestanding ternary composite of MoS2/rGO/Cu2O on etched carbon paper has been fabricated by Gopalakrishnan et al. using a combination of hydrothermal and seed growth methods.83 The fabricated composite has shown excellent photocatalytic properties under sunlight by degrading binary dye solution consisting of MB and Rhodamine B (RhB) solutions with a degradation efficiency of 98% and 94% within 45 minutes of sunlight irradiation, as shown in Fig. 9C and D. The observed excellent photocatalytic performance has been attributed to the enhanced charge carrier's suppression of electron-hole recombination. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) acts as an interlayer or conductive channel, prohibiting electron–hole recombination.
As shown in Fig. 9E and F, two plausible degradation mechanisms are proposed based on the position of the rGO into the ternary MoS2/rGO/Cu2O composite. In case-1, the rGO is considered to be situated between MoS2 and Cu2O, which facilitates the charge transfer and avoids electron-hole recombination. In case-2, both MoS2 and Cu2O are supposed to be deposited on rGO sheets where photo-excited electrons are effectively transferred from the conduction band (CB) of Cu2O to the CB of MoS2. These electrons are then transferred to rGO, which acts as a conductive network for the charge transfer. The detailed degradation parameters are given in Table 5.

Similar to MoS2, WS2 is also a narrow bandgap material that exhibits excellent photocatalytic properties. It has been used effectively for the photocatalytic and sonocatalytic degradation of heavy metal ions and volatile organic compounds.84,85 Fatima et al. deposited WS2/PANI nanocomposite by sequential deposition of WS2 and PANI by hydrothermal and in situ polymerization techniques, respectively.86 The resultant nanocomposite has been used for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO). It has been observed that WS2/PANI effectively degraded 97% of MO in 120 minutes under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the strong adsorption of positively charged MO dye molecules on the negatively charged surface of the WS2/PANI nanocomposite.
5. Summary and future perspective
The present study highlights the versatility of solution-based deposited LMDs for their use in supercapacitors, batteries, PEC cells, electrocatalytic HER and photocatalytic dye degradation. The fascinating physicochemical properties of LMDs, such as crystal structure, morphology, 2D nature, electrical and optical help us to enhance their performance in various applications that are discussed with suitable examples. This report provides necessary and valuable information on group VI LMDs materials at a fingertip.
Despite the fascinating features of solution-based deposition techniques, only a few reports are available on the deposition of MoS2 and WS2 thin films. Similar to these materials, other group VI LMDs, e.g. MoSe2, MoTe2, WSe2 and WTe2 etc., possess intriguing properties and are being explored for technological applications. As discussed in Section 2, solution-based deposition methods offer a facile and low-cost synthesis approach which is beneficial in bringing down the overall cost of the device. The lack of reports on synthesizing these group VI LMDs by solution-based deposition allows for investigating the performance of these materials for various applications. For instance, thin films of MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 using the SILAR method have not been investigated. Unlike the group VI LMDs deposited by vapor-based deposition methods, the solution-based deposited group VI LMDs suffer from low crystallinity and oxidation, which might be the cause of the lack of research work in this particular field. These issues can be addressed by optimizing reaction parameters as well as carrying out the reaction under an inert atmosphere. In addition to this, the complex chemistry of W needs to be investigated in detail. Generally, HH is utilized to reduce W from W6+ to W4+ when Na2WO4 is used as a W precursor. However, HH is one of the carcinogenic chemicals. Alternatively, one can employ HH free solution-based deposition methods such as electrodeposition to deposit W based LMDs. If the electrodeposition method is used, one has to optimize the reduction potential of W.
Though vapor-based deposited LMDs have been explored for many applications, such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, electronic devices, and photocatalysis, their real-time applications are limited due to the drawbacks of the synthesis approach. On the other hand, group VI LMDs synthesized by solution-based deposition methods offer various advantages such as low cost, high yield, and tunable chemical compositions to achieve the desired properties. Thus, the solution-based deposited group VI LMDs are suitable for real-time applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, gas and biosensors, electrocatalysts, CO2 capture and conversion, and photocatalysts (Fig. 10).
