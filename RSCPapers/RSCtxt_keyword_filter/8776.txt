    , Accepted 27th April 2021First published on 21st May 2021AbstractCurrent perovskite solar cell efficiency is close to silicon's record values. Yet, the roadblock for industrialization of this technology is its stability. The stability of the solar cell not only depends on the stability of the perovskite material itself but also notably on its contact layers and their interface with the perovskite, which plays a paramount role. This study rationalizes the design of new molecules to form self-assembled monolayers as a hole-selective contact. The new molecules increased the stability of the perovskite solar cells to maintain 80% of their initial PCE of 21% for 250 h at 85 °C under 1 sun illumination. The excellent charge collection properties as well as perovskite passivation effect enable the highly stable and efficient devices to demonstrate the vast potential of this new type of contact in photovoltaic application.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly become one of the hot topics in photovoltaics due to their high solar to energy conversion efficiency. The fast development of device engineering has allowed the preparation of solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25% within ten years. A perovskite layer is typically sandwiched between an electron selective layer and a hole selective layer to achieve high PCE and long-term stable PSCs. In standard PSCs, the charge selective layer plays a major role and the use of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as a charge selective layer has been lately explored due to its excellent charge selective properties. However, the design of the SAM is critical for achieving reproducible, high efficient, and ultra-stable perovskite devices. Herein, we have demonstrated the importance of molecule design on device performance and long-term stability. In particular, we have demonstrated that the use of SAMs results in a higher stability of the device compared to that with a pragmatic polymer selective contact. Our work will unveil a possibility for further promoting the performance and stability of PSCs and provide a valuable additional study to design charge selective contacts for PSCs.

Introduction
In a short span of 10 years of research, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached over 25% from an initial 3.8%.1 All through this process, the past knowledge in dye-sensitized solar cells and organic solar cells has been vital in achieving the rapid success. Moreover, charge selective contact layers are critical for achieving such high efficiency. Yet, despite having extraordinary progress in the device efficiency, the lack of long-term stability of halide perovskites is one of the main roadblocks towards its industrialization. To improve the device's stability, not only the intrinsic stability enhancement of halide perovskite is essential, but the stability of the device contact layers also plays a crucial role. Highly-priced organic charge selective materials drive the research to look for new organic conjugated molecules like self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have been applied before in organic-based optoelectronic devices. Recently, SAMs have been used as the charge selective contacts for PSCs and the record power conversion efficiency has rapidly achieved 21% under standard measurement conditions.2–4
Unlike the organic hole selective materials that are expensive (e.g. PTAA costs 1000 euros per gram) or unstable in devices,5 SAMs offer an opportunity for a cheap, scalable, and stable hole-selective material in the p–i–n type PSC structure due to their low material consumption, simple processing, and modifiable bandgap, without the requirement of dopants. In addition to these advantages, SAMs can modulate the work function of the metal oxide surface for better control of the energy band alignment between the different materials and interfaces within the solar cell. This modulation can be achieved via SAMs’ anchoring groups such as carboxylic acid or phosphonic acid that can react with the surface hydroxyl groups of metal oxides via a simple chemical reaction.6,7 Their functional groups are designed to modify the interface or surface properties like wetting, functionalities and, as mentioned above, the interfacial energy level alignment.8–10 The linkage group is positioned between the anchoring group and the functional group, which determines the packing geometries.
In this study, we designed and synthesized two new carbazole based self-assembled molecules for hole-selective layers (HSLs) in p–i–n solar cells. We demonstrate stable efficiency above 21% delivering a solar cell open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.19 V for a perovskite bandgap of 1.63 eV using these two SAMs. Remarkably, the solar cells retain 80% of their initial conversion efficiency after 250 h of maximum power point tracking under one sun AM 1.5 G illumination at 85 °C. These results are a new milestone for the development of a new class of hole selective materials for PSCs, which exhibit at the same time high efficiency and stability, which are paramount for the necessary transfer to industrial applications.
Result and discussion
Molecule design and characterization

Fig. 1a shows the synthesis pathway of the new SAMs, where 4-(3,6-bis(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzoic acid (EADR03) and 4′-(3,6-bis(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (EADR04) have a carbazole moiety as an electron donor unit.11 On the one hand, the carbazole chemical group has electron-rich block properties, which lead to increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 18% in PSCs.12–14 Subsequent electron-rich groups are mainly added as substituents in the carbazole moiety to align the energy levels with the perovskite material and increase its solubility in common organic solvents. On the other hand, the substituted position of the photo-active conjugated phenyl benzene plays a critical role in the electron-donating effect. For instance, if the methoxy groups are only located at the meta-position, they will have an electron-withdrawing effect.15 Nevertheless, if they is only positioned at the ortho-position, they will twist the phenyl ring out of the plane, causing the undesired steric effect.16 For these reasons, 1,3-dimethoxybenzene is chosen as a substituent for the carbazole moiety. The synthetic details are given in the ESI.†

Note that the SAM layer's values (EADR03 and EADR04) are measured using UPS (Fig. S8, ESI† shows UPS spectra) (see Methods for detail). Before UPS measurements, the ITO substrate was treated with UV-ozone to ensure similarity with the used substrates in devices.

To prove its suitable energetic properties as a hole selective material for PSCs, we performed ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on the SAM layer attached to the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate, similar to what is used in the device. The condensation reaction occurs between the carboxylic acid (–COOH) anchoring group of SAMs and the surface hydroxyl group (–OH) of metal oxide to give ester (O–CO) type linkages,6,17 which result in the formation of SAM on the ITO. The optical bandgap of SAMs is estimated from the absorption edge wavelength (λa.e.) using UV-vis measurement18 (see Fig. S3 and Table S2, ESI†). From UPS measurement and optical bandgap, we calculate the position of the SAM's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The valence band onset and the Fermi level value EADR03 and EADR04 are schematically displayed in Fig. 1b. In this study, we employed the triple cation perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb(I0.84Br0.16)3 hereafter labelled as CsFAMA) as the absorber layer adapted from Saliba et al.19 The energetic properties of PTAA and CsFAMA are obtained from the literature and all values are referenced to the vacuum level.3 As can be seen from Fig. 1b, SAMs exhibit a better electron blocking character than PTAA due to the carbazole unit in small molecule backbone, while working as efficient hole extraction layers.
Additionally, as shown in Fig. 1a, we designed the SAM molecules with the 1,3-dimethoxybenzene moiety acting as the terminal group that provides a miscible interface for the perovskite one-step solution process. A miscible interface ensures a homogenous and compact perovskite film.20 To determine the surface wettability, contact angle measurements are performed on bare ITO and p-type materials deposited on ITO (see the Method section for details). The contacting angles of the water on bare ITO, PTAA, EADR03 and EADR04 are 8.13°, 88.15°, 50.19° and 51.63°, respectively (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The PTAA layer shows a higher hydrophobicity than the SAMs in agreement with the previous report,21 leading to a poor wetting for perovskite solution on PTAA. We note that in the XRD patterns (see Fig. S9, ESI†), although there is no detectable peak shift or peak broadening in the perovskite phase, there is a noticeable more pronounced PbI2 phase in the perovskite on PTAA than on SAMs. This higher PbI2 content is also visible in the SEM images as a bright small grain on the surface (see Fig. S10, ESI†). Although it has been reported that excess PbI2 in the perovskite can improve the device performance,22 a recent report has shown that perovskite with a higher PbI2 content can lead to a lower stability in devices due to the formation of metallic Pb, which can act as a non-radiative recombination center,23 which will be discussed in details in the later section.
We examined the atomic bonds of SAMs on metal oxide surface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The spectra were analyzed as described in the ESI† (see Table S3). The C1s spectra, were decomposed into 4 peaks assigned to C–C or C–H at 284.6 eV (284.7 eV), C–O at 286.0 eV (285.9 eV), COOCH bonds at 287.0 eV (287.0 eV), and O–CO bonds at 288.5 eV (289.1 eV) for EADR03 (EADR04) (Fig. 1c and e respectively).24,25 The [C–O]/[C–C + C–O] area ratios amount to 25% for EADR03 and 30% for EADR04. From their structural formulae, one would expect 15% for EADR03 and 12% for EADR04 ignoring attenuation due to inelastic electron scattering. The evident excess in C–O bonds is likely caused by solvent residues. It is worth noting that the bare ITO surface also exhibits C1s peaks situated at 284.9 eV, 285.8 eV, 287.0 eV, and 289.1 eV (see Fig. S5a, ESI†). These carbon contributions are presumably largely residues from the cleaning procedure. The O1s region (Fig. 1d and f) exhibit peaks belonging to In–O at 530.1 eV, surface hydroxides at 530.9 eV (530.8 eV), CO at 532.8 eV (532.8 eV) and C–O at 533.1 eV (533.2 eV) for EADR03 (EADR04) in the spectra.26,27 The bare ITO substrate also showed four components: 530.3 eV (InSnO), 530.8 eV, 531.8 eV, and 532.9 eV (see Fig. S5b, ESI†), where the carbon compounds are again presumably cleaning residues.
The formation of ester bonds demonstrates bonding between the carbon atom of carboxylic acid and the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group on ITO or to solvent residues.28 Moreover, we observe a much weaker signal of this characteristic ester bond in C1s and O1s spectra of bare ITO in these regions, which further points to the presence of SAMs on ITO (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The N1s spectra show the same peak position of ca. 400 eV for both SAMs, indicating the presence of the C–N bond in the structure (see Fig. S6c, ESI†). These strongly indicate the presence of SAMs on the ITO substrate.
To understand the charge transfer properties of these new SAMs as HSLs for PSCs, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) using λ = 470 nm as the excitation wavelength as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The traces exhibit two different decay profiles fitted to a bi-exponential function as previously reported.29–31 SAM-based perovskite films show an initial fast decay that can be assigned to trap filling, while the slower decay most likely corresponds to the bimolecular recombination. The lifetimes τ1 of EADR03, EADR04, PTAA and the perovskite are 15 ns, 9 ns, 2 ns and 7 ns, respectively, and the calculated lifetimes τ2 are 158 ns, 106 ns, 12 ns and 83 ns for EADR03, EADR04, PTAA and the perovskite, respectively (see Table S4, ESI†). Interestingly, in Fig. S11b (ESI†), the luminescence decay of the perovskite layers on SAMs shows efficient quenching that supports their efficient hole transporting character compared to PTAA. Not only is there evidence of a faster charge extraction using SAM compared to PTAA, but the increased PL yield can also indicate an interfacial passivation effect32 compared to the PTAA sample shown in Fig. S11c (ESI†) similar to the reported carbazole based polymer.33
Photovoltaic performance
We employed in this study the state-of-the-art device architecture with ITO/SAM or PTAA/CsFAMA/C60/BCP/Cu sandwich architecture as shown in Fig. 1g.34 Cesium-containing triple cation perovskite (CsFAMA) is deposited on top of the HSLs using the one-step method. Afterwards, C60, an electron selective layer, is thermally evaporated on top of the perovskite layer. The fullerene C60 has excellent electron-extraction properties in photovoltaic devices. Thus, it is preferred as the electron transport layer.35 Lastly, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer and copper (Cu) electrode are evaporated to complete the device. SAMs are generally deposited on metal oxide surfaces as a monolayer using a variety of methods like solution assisted self-assembly (dipping), vapour deposition and spin-coating method.27 Here, we used the paradigmatic PTAA as our baseline to determine the performance of cells with SAMs. PTAA is widely used in the p–i–n PSCs as a polymeric HSL, which can be coated into a thin homogenous layer from solution and show PCEs higher than 18%.5,36,37 The detailed fabrication process of the perovskite solar cells is presented in the Methods section of the ESI.†
The choice of solvent is the first critical step for SAMs to have a well-organized interface between SAMs and perovskite absorber. Here, the design of EADR03 and EADR04 consists of a carboxylic acid moiety on the molecule backbone, which makes the molecules soluble in non-halogenated solvents as ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (IPA). The devices with SAMs as HSLs show statistically better performance with IPA using the dipping method compared to ethanol (see Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†). The best PV parameters of solvent optimization are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). Consequently, we achieve more than 20% PCE using the dipping method with EADR03 as the HSL, whereas spin coating method only provides a maximum of 17% (see Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†). The best device parameters of EADR03 with different deposition methods are shown in Table S6 (ESI†). On the other hand, EADR04 is not suitable for spin-coating methods because of solubility problems. We note that here the dipping method is preferable due to lower solubility of the molecules in alcohol. Nonetheless, the solubility is not the only deciding factor for device performance. The molecules have excellent solubility in toluene, yet the devices using this solvent exhibit unsatisfactory performance (Table S5, ESI†). The reason behind the difference in behavior is beyond the scope of this study and will require further research.

Fig. 2b shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) scans of the best devices with PTAA, EADR03 and EADR04 measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 from forward (VOC to JSC) to reverse bias. Maximum power point (MPP) tracks of the best devices are shown in Fig. 2b. MPP-tracked efficiencies are comparable with the respective J–V values, which is expected from the negligible hysteresis. A statistical distribution of the cell parameters is achieved from more than 15 devices for each HSL, shown in Fig. 2a, exhibiting systematically a higher performance of SAM based cells compared to PTAA. The best PCEs of EADR03 and EADR04 are 20.5% and 20.6% surpassing PTAA cells’ best value of 18.9%. Remarkably, the VOC values of SAM-based devices demonstrate more than 1.1 V and the fill factor (FF) values >80%. The superior electron blocking of the SAM compared to that of PTAA is attributed to the higher VOC and FF values of EADR03 and EADR04 compared to those of PTAA. Specifically, the voltage of SAM-based devices is approximately 150 mV higher than that of PTAA. This improvement in device performance is not directly correlated to the HOMO level of the material as PTAA has a deeper HOMO level compared to SAMs (Fig. 1b); instead, SAM as a material, which has both efficient charge transport and passivation effects, results in this improvement. We emphasize that we achieved this desirable property of a contact layer without the use of dopants, which has been shown to degrade the perovskite layer.38 Our result resonates with the conclusion of Al-Ashouri et al.3 on phosphonic anchor SAMs. These results establish the tremendous promising benefit of SAM as an attractive class of selective layer materials realized in both perovskite and organic PV.2,39,40

(c) Corresponding external quantum efficiency curves which show integrated current density in agreement with values from the J–V measurement. 
In addition, the J–V scan of the SAM-HSL based full device showed a lower leakage current in place of PTAA under dark conditions, shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The low dark current also indicates a high density of SAM on ITO. The integrated JSC of the best devices from external quantum efficiency measurement (EQE) integration is shown in Fig. 2c. The higher current density is also due to the lower parasitic absorption of SAM compared to that of PTAA in the short wavelength range similar to phosphonic SAMs developed for the same device architecture.41 Integrated JSC values have a negligible difference (∼1 mA cm−2) with the JSC values gained from the J–V scans for the best device. The devices with the SAMs as HSLs show minor hysteresis index (HI)42,43 between reverse and forward J–V scans. All photovoltaic parameters of the best devices are provided in Table 1.

As we have demonstrated the good passivation effect of SAM on the interface between perovskite and the HSLs compared to that of the commonly used polymer PTAA, the other interface with the electron selective layer is equally important. It has been reported that the interfacial recombination at perovskite/C60 dominates the losses in voltage of this device architecture and it can be improved by using an ultrathin passivation layer of LiF (∼1 nm).34 In this study, we used the same approach to enhance further the final VOC of the device, reaching 1.19 V with 1.63 eV bandgap perovskite in EADR03 based cells. Table 1 summarizes the champion devices in this study. As shown in Table 1, the improvement brought by LiF is higher in SAM-based devices compared to that in PTAA-based ones. This can be attributed to slightly higher PbI2 content on the surface of the perovskite grown on PTAA than SAM (shown as a bright grain in the SEM images – Fig. S10, ESI†). The presence of PbI2 on the surface can partially reduce the interfacial recombination at perovskite/C60 because of its wide bandgap.44 With the improvement from LiF (the VOC increases for more than 50 mV) and an anti-reflection coating, the SAM-based devices reache more than quasi-steady-state 21% for EADR03 and 20.7% for EADR04 after 2 minutes of MPP tracking (Fig. 3).

Device stability investigation
Perovskite-based PVs have reached 25.5% certified PCE and surpassed the conventional PV thin-film technologies and are approaching the state-of-the-art silicon single-junction solar cell.45 However, the main problem for the integration of perovskite into the PV industry is its lack of stability.46 Here, we use a high through-put ageing setup, which can track hundreds of devices at once. We compared the stability of PTAA with that of EADR03 and EADR04 cells in the continuous MPP in one sun illumination. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the PTAA cells rapidly lost more than 15% of their initial PCE after 24 hours of MPP tracking, on the other hand, the SAM based devices exhibit excellent higher stability (note that the curves are averaged from different devices and show statistical values rather than only that of the best device).

(c) EADR03 and EADR04 based devices with a UV filter (cut-off at 350 nm) at 25 degrees Celsius. Note that the values were averaged from different devices from different batches. All the measurements were done in an N2 atmosphere without encapsulation. (d) Best J–V curves from PTAA and EADR03 with and without UV light exposure (365 nm) for 30 minutes, prior to perovskite layer fabrication. 
Although the EADR04 cells show a fast drop in the first few hours, they regain their initial efficiency and retain 95% of the initial efficiency after 150 h of continuous MPP tracking before they have a declining trend. We extrapolate this trend and estimate that the T80 (time until the cell reaches 80% of its initial efficiency) can be more than 800 hours for EADR04 cells. Compared to the EADR04 cells, the EADR03 cells gradually decrease until they reach 80% of their initial PCE at around 180 h (as can also be seen in Table 2). This trend is more evident when the EADR04 cells are aged at an elevated temperature of 85 °C (see Fig. 4b) where the cells retain 80% of their initial efficiency for approximately 250 h of continuous MPP tracking. This difference between the two SAMs can be attributed to the structure of the molecules. As can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†), EADR04 has higher decomposition temperature compared to EADR03, thanks to the extra phenyl in the linkage group (chain), between the anchoring group and the functional group. Note that the thermogravimetry indicates the decomposition temperatures (180 °C for EADR03 and 354 °C for EADR04), which are indeed not the same temperature as the operational conditions. However, thermogravimetry can still indicate the resiliency of the molecules at high temperature and under long-time operation conditions. Similar to our observation, Li et al. have reported that different conjugated side-chain polymers result in devices with a higher thermal stability.47

We attribute this encouraging improvement in the stability of SAMs as HSLs compared to PTAA to the excellent stability of SAMs in UV light. Indeed, when we expose PTAA layers to the UV light for 30 minutes prior to perovskite deposition, the device exhibits lower JSC whereas UV light has negligible effect on EADR03 (as can be seen in Fig. 4d). This negative impact on device performance is more evidenced in the device statistics shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†) where PTAA cells lose on average more than 1 mA cm−2 after UV exposure. We emphasize that even without any UV light stress on the perovskite absorber layer, the UV light has a detrimental effect on PTAA in contrast to the SAMs whose devices did not show this behaviour.
The UV-induced degradation in PTAA is very likely due to the breaking of the carbon bonds in the aromatic rings into smaller fragments.48 In addition, polymers have been reported to undergo the photochemical pathway in which the polymer hydrocarbon chain can break down into free radicals in the presence of oxygen. This UV-photochemical reaction can severely deteriorate the polymeric material properties.49 This also indicates a potential degradation pathway of the polymer HSLs in ambient air that is undesirable for PSC application. We acknowledge that a bulk of PTAA (∼10 nm) and a single molecular layer (1–3 nm) might not be directly comparable in this study. The UV absorption of the SAM layer is negligible compared to that of the PTTA layer. We do expect that the absorption of PTAA layer is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the SAM layer if we only consider the thicknesses of the two layers. Therefore, the defects that the UV absorption may create are more likely to impact the PTAA layer than the SAM layer. However, achieving an even thinner PTAA with a comparable thickness with the SAM layers poses practical challenges. In fact, Stolterfoht et al. demonstrated that diluting PTAA solution led to having an incomplete coverage of ITO, decreasing the selectivity of the PTAA layer under the perovskite layer, which negatively affected device's FF and VOC.50
In this work, we have significantly higher intensity in the range of 300–500 nm with the lamp used for ageing measurements compared to global AM1.5 spectrum (see Fig. S20a, ESI†). Hence, the measurement condition accelerates the UV-induced PTAA degradation, which can be the reason behind the lower stability of our PTAA p–i–n cells compared to the values reported in the literature (shown in Table 2). We note that high stability of PTAA in n–i–p cells has been reported;51 nonetheless, in the n–i–p structure, the UV photons are absorbed in the n-type and perovskite absorber layers before reaching PTAA. Moreover, this is also an accelerating ageing measurement for perovskite. The instability of perovskite under UV light has been widely reported,52,53 mainly because of the photochemical degradation of PbI2 into metallic lead Pb0 forming non-radiative recombination centers, reducing the cells’ efficiency.23 We used a UV filter (cut-off at 350 nm) to improve the lifetime of the devices (see Fig. 4c). Although we still have a significantly higher intensity of the simulated spectrum in the 350–500 nm region compared to global AM1.5 (see Fig. S21b, ESI†), we do see a considerable enhancement of the cells’ lifetimes as can be seen in Table 2 (we note that the light intensity is lower than one sun illumination). With the UV-filter, the EADR04 cells’ T80 reaches a value of more than 2000 h. Therefore, the reported values in Table 2 are an underestimation of the cells’ potential in this study.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the importance of the molecular design when using SAMs as the selective contacts in perovskite solar cells. The SAMs have become the route to achieve high solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies and, herein, we show that SAMs can lead to remarkably stable solar cells. In our study, we use both the carbazole and methoxy moieties as electron donors for efficient charge selection, good electron blocking properties and surface passivation of the perovskite. Moreover, the 1,3-dimethoxybenzene terminal group of the molecule is compatible with perovskite formation resulting in a smooth and compact perovskite film. This design enables the perovskite cells to reach more than 21% stabilized efficiency and, most importantly, the monolayer based devices exhibit superior stability compared to PTAA based cells, which are the current standard for perovskite solar cells approaching silicon PV values. We demonstrated that stabilizing the perovskite/SAMs interface is the way to commercialize perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly become one of the hot topics in photovoltaics due to their high solar to energy conversion efficiency. The fast development of device engineering has allowed the preparation of solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25% within ten years. A perovskite layer is typically sandwiched between an electron selective layer and a hole selective layer to achieve high PCE and long-term stable PSCs. In standard PSCs, the charge selective layer plays a major role and the use of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as a charge selective layer has been lately explored due to its excellent charge selective properties. However, the design of the SAM is critical for achieving reproducible, high efficient, and ultra-stable perovskite devices. Herein, we have demonstrated the importance of molecule design on device performance and long-term stability. In particular, we have demonstrated that the use of SAMs results in a higher stability of the device compared to that with a pragmatic polymer selective contact. Our work will unveil a possibility for further promoting the performance and stability of PSCs and provide a valuable additional study to design charge selective contacts for PSCs.
