    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 12th August 2014AbstractAmbient-unstable hole transporters and expensive and complicated noble metal electrode deposition are incompatible with the large scale and low-cost production of perovskite solar cells and thus would hamper their commercialization. Herein we report a new modality of perovskite solar cells that do away with the use of conventional hole transporters by directly clamping a selective hole extraction electrode made of candle soot and a deliberately engineered perovskite photoanode. The key soot/perovskite interface, which promotes hole extraction and electron blocking by forming a Schottky junction, was established seamlessly by pre-wetting and reaction embedding the carbon particles. Femtosecond time-resolved photoluminescence revealed a high hole extraction rate at 1.92 ns−1. We have now achieved 11.02% efficiency, making an important step towards roll-to-roll production of perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells are in the spotlight of research community and industrial sectors alike because of the remarkable photoelectric properties of the perovskite materials. Currently, the perovskite solar cells commonly use an organic hole transport material (HTM) and a noble metal electrode atop. However, the materials and the fabrication processes are expensive, and the HTM is air-sensitive, limiting the long-term stability of devices. In this work, we have accredited the environmental benign, ambient stable and earth-abundant candle soot as an efficient hole extractor for perovskite solar cells. Technologically, we have instituted a concept of clamping solar cells by simply but judiciously interfacing the candle soot with the CH3NH3PbI3 films. Up to this stage of development, the nanocarbon-based clamping perovskite solar cells have already achieved a remarkable efficiency of 11.02% and presented good long term stability. Thus we have shown that the nanocarbon-based clamping perovskite solar cells represent a new type of easily processable and inexpensive but high performing photovoltaic device. The present work has set the stage to push toward roll-to-roll production and realistic commercialization of perovskite solar cells.

Organometal trihalide perovskites have stood out as prominent light harvesters for novel high efficiency solid-state solar cells.1–22 Although the perovskites by themselves are advantageous due to their solution processability and low-cost, current perovskite solar cells typically require an expensive and air-sensitive hole transporter (e.g., spiro-MeOTAD) and a noble metal electrode (Au or Ag) deposited by complicated vacuum technologies.23,24 These drawbacks, if not adequately addressed, will hinder the industrial development and market potential of perovskite solar cells.25 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop alternative materials and processes that show high performance but are inexpensive, earth-abundant, environmentally friendly, easily processable and energy non-intensive. As is well known, graphitic carbon, with most of the above-mentioned sought-after characteristics, has a work function of around 5.0 eV, meaning that its Fermi level is only slightly higher than the valence band edge of the perovskites.11,26–30 This energy band alignment probably permits the graphitic carbon to efficiently extract holes from the ambipolar perovskites,11,27,31–33 an imperative step in this type of solar cell. Consequently, a suitably engineered carbon material can be up to the job with the need for either the conventional hole transporter or the noble metal electrode.27–30,34 Hitherto, however, little work has been done to develop carbon based nanomaterials in that regard to pursue cost-efficient perovskite solar cells.
In this work, we propose and develop the concept of clamping solar cells by joining together a separately optimized perovskite photoanode and a candle soot hole extraction electrode (see Scheme 1a). Candle soot is used because it is potentially a hole-extracting electrode material that is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, stable and abundant. At the core of this design is the carbon/perovskite interface, which ideally should be a Schottky junction as shown in Scheme 1b. Specifically, the candle soot electrode should be able to selectively extract holes but reject electrons from the perovskite. Our systematic efforts have been centered on the optimization of the carbon/perovskite interface, as illustrated in Scheme 1c, by stepwise evolving the clamping solar cells across three generations. The 1st generation is featured by directly clamping a perovskite photoanode, to a candle soot electrode flame-deposited on FTO, producing a working cell with a decent efficiency. However, two problems were encountered: (1) the candle soot was not sufficiently conductive and (2) the uncontrollable clamping mode failed to ensure dependable contacts between the perovskite and the candle soot, resulting in large internal resistance and an inferior photovoltaic performance. To address these problems, the candle soot was annealed to enhance graphitization and thus the conductivity, and rolling transfer of the candle soot was adopted to improve the interface contact, leading to the 2nd generation clamping solar cells. Indeed, the overall solar cell performance including efficiency and reproducibility has been improved significantly. However, the fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are still unsatisfactory compared to spiro-MeOTAD based cells, probably associated with the low and non-ideal interface contacts between perovskite and candle soot. This problem is largely resolved by a dramatic leap to the 3rd generation clamping solar cells enabled by a two-step method. Now the perovskite film is fabricated by firstly depositing a PbI2 precursor layer, immediately followed by the rolling transfer of candle soot, and finally subjecting the sample to a CH3NH3I bath treatment. In this chemically promoted clamping process, the in situ conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 conspired to yield an interpenetrating interface between perovskite and candle soot with excellent controllability. Thus the combination of such simple mechanical and chemical clamping techniques has allowed us to greatly boost the PCE (to 11.02%) as well as the performance reproducibility.

We start by firstly demonstrating the synthesis of candle soot and presenting some of its basic structural and electronic properties useful for the hole extraction. Fig. 1a illustrates the classical flame deposition of candle soot, which is expedient for large-scale synthesis of carbon nanoparticles. By simply putting a piece of glass in the candle flame, a tens of micrometers thick film of black candle soot could be deposited in seconds. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1b, one can see that a loose sponge-like structure of the as-prepared candle soot is well assembled. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1c further reveals the typical bi-continuous, branched nanochain structure, which is actually composed of strings of 30 nm nanoparticles. The calcination at 1000 °C in argon gas did not cause a noticeable morphology change (refer to Fig. S1†), but it raised the electric conductivity precipitously up to ∼5 S cm−1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the as-prepared candle soot (∼0.02 S cm−1), due presumably to the removal of the organic residues and the improved graphitization. As expected, the Raman spectra in Fig. 1d show a sharpened G band and a reduced ID/IG ratio arising from the calcination. In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in Fig. 1e also testify that the calcined candle soot contains a smaller concentration of oxygen (1.03%) than the as-prepared candle soot (1.57%). The dramatically enhanced conductivity bodes well for the interfacial charge transfer and charge transport in solar cells that use such candle soot as electrodes, as will be discussed below. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in Fig. 1f reveals a similar work function of 5.00 eV for both the as-prepared and the calcined candle soot, but the latter displays a higher density of states near the Fermi level (see the inset in Fig. 1f) due to the improved graphitization. At any rate, the Fermi level is suitable for hole extraction from perovskite because it is only slightly higher than the valence band edge of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.

As mentioned above, the key challenge in developing the clamping solar cells lies in the optimization of charge separation and transport at the candle soot/perovskite interface. Since the 1st generation clamping cells are wide off the mark in this aspect, we focus our attention on the charge transfer behaviors in the 2nd and the 3rd generations of clamping solar cells. Fig. 2a presents the energy band diagram of the clamping cells based on Fig. 1f and our previous report.26 In a working cell, after light excitation, the electron is excited up to the conduction band (CB) at −3.86 eV, injected into the CB of TiO2 (−4.00 eV) and finally collected at the FTO anode (work function: 4.70 eV). At the same time, the hole in the valence band (VB) at −5.43 eV is extracted to the candle soot electrode (work function: 5.00 eV). It follows that key to the operation of the clamping cell are two selective charge extraction interfaces sandwiching the ambipolar perovskite layer. The first is the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface for electron extraction, which has been well established by the previous research work.7,10 It is the second interface of candle soot/perovskite for hole extraction that is really the linchpin of our clamping solar cells. In order to understand the nature of the candle soot/perovskite interface, we measured current–voltage (I–V) curves of the FTO/C/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO device together with the two control devices of FTO/C/FTO and FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO, which are displayed in Fig. 2b. One can see that the FTO/C/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO device presents rectifying characteristics of a Schottky junction. In the control measurements, the FTO/C/FTO device displays a linear I–V curve suggesting an ohmic contact between FTO and C, while the FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO device presents a symmetric nonlinear I–V curve due to the semiconductive properties of the perovskite. Thus the Schottky junction has been formed at the candle soot/perovskite interface, which induces a built-in field and the attendant energy band bending (inset in Fig. 2b) promoting the directional hole extraction to candle soot but rejecting the electrons.

(b) I–V curves of FTO/C/FTO, FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO and FTO/C/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO clamping devices (the inset is a schematic equilibrium energy diagram of the Schottky junction of C/CH3NH3PbI3). (c) Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3, and the 2nd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C and the 3rd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C electrodes. Distance dependent PL quenching in the 2nd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C film (d) and in the 3rd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C film. (e) The marked points in the optical microscopy images in (d) and (e) are not to scale, and the actual line scanning step is 0.2 μm. 
Femtosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was further employed to investigate the early interfacial or near interfacial carrier dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C films using the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film as a control sample. The results are shown in Fig. 2c. As usual, PL lifetime (τ) is defined as the time it takes for the PL intensity to fall to 1/e of its original intensity. We can see that the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits the longest PL lifetime of 2165.7 ps, and the candle soot induced PL quenching shortens the PL lifetime of the 2nd and 3rd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C films to 409.2 ps and 235.4 ps, respectively. By using the relationship kct = 1/τ − 1/τ0, the charge transfer rate of the 3rd generation electrode is estimated to be 3.79 ns−1, which is 1.91 times higher than the 2nd generation electrode. Notably, the hole extraction rate of candle soot is even comparable with that of spiro-MeOTAD,15 which is a standard hole transport material used in perovskite solar cells. Evidently, the chemically promoted 3rd generation clamping solar cell allows more efficient hole extraction from perovskite to candle soot than the 2nd generation clamping solar cell. In order to further confirm this result, we performed nanoscale PL line scans at the sub-micrometer level on the 2nd and 3rd generation CH3NH3PbI3 + C films, and the results are presented in Fig. 2d and e, respectively. As shown in the left panels of Fig. 2d and e, faceted perovskite microcrystals form continuous films, above which some carbon aggregates (black color) can be observed. By performing a line PL scan near a selected carbon aggregate along the dashed line (from point 1 to point 4, scanning step: 200 nm) with a focused laser beam, a series of PL spectra were acquired, and the corresponding PL spectra are shown in the middle panels of Fig. 2d and e. In general, the PL intensity decreases as the laser beam is scanned towards the carbon aggregates, but the 3rd generation electrode displays a much shorter PL decay length (λ is the length taken for the PL intensity to fall to 1/e of its original intensity; shorter λ means stronger PL quenching) than the 2nd generation electrode. For instance, the candle soot in the 3rd generation film can quench at point 4 up to 90% of the PL intensity at point 1 within 600 nm around it, whereas only ∼70% PL quenching is observed in the 2nd generation film at a similar distance. This difference in distance dependent PL quenching also reflects the different hole extraction capabilities in the electrodes due to the different interfacial contacts between candle soot and perovskite. As schematically illustrated in the right panels of Fig. 2d and e, the improved interface contact in the 3rd generation film (Fig. 2e) over the 2nd generation film (Fig. 2d) by the chemical promoted interpenetration between candle soot and perovskite facilitates the hole extraction and thereby quenches the PL more efficiently nearby.
Now a closer examination at the chemically engineered soot/perovskite interfaces is in order, in an effort to expedite the technical optimization of the clamping solar cells. Fig. 3a1 schematizes the 2nd generation physical contact between C and CH3NH3PbI3, in which candle soot is press attached to the perovskite photoanode. The SEM image in Fig. 3a2 reveals perovskite crystals in the tetragonal system (inset of Fig. 3a2) with a cuboid-shaped morphology, resulting in a rough top surface (for more characterization results of perovskite-related thin films, see Fig. S2†). This rough characteristic of the top surface is seen more clearly from the 3D height profile atomic force microscopy (AFM) image in Fig. 3a3. Indeed, the top surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 film is full of convex–concave features spanning a tens of nanometer range, which are useful for the subsequent filling of size- and morphology-matched carbon soot nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3a4. This surface feature is particularly beneficial to the mechanical clamping in the 1st generation clamping solar cells, which owe their initial success precisely to the rough perovskite surface.

(c3) HRTEM image (taken at the dashed circle in c2) of single crystalline CH3NH3PbI3, and (c4) tilted-view SEM image of the chemically engineered interface of C/CH3NH3PbI3. 

Fig. 3b and c feature the chemically promoted interface engineering in the 3rd generation clamping solar cells. The key process lies in the in situ conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and chemical embedding of C into CH3NH3PbI3 at the interface, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3b1 and c1. Compared to the above-described perovskite crystals (Fig. 3a1), the precursor PbI2 has even smaller particle sizes (∼200 nm) (Fig. 3b2) and yields smaller but sharper surface features (Fig. 3b3), permitting more interpenetrating contacts between C and PbI2. Most importantly, these pre-configured contacts will allow the subsequent in situ conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 to greatly improve the interface and lower the barrier to charge transfer. As schematized in Fig. 3c1, the CH3NH3PbI3 precursors could penetrate into and wrap around the mesoporous candle soot and crystallize, holding together the soot particles and thereby proffering a high-quality interface for facile hole extraction. This chemical embedding effect was caught by careful TEM observations (see below and Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 3c2, part of the candle soot network becomes embedded in the perovskite crystal film after in situ conversion (see the edge of the dashed box) and the candle soot particles conglutinated by perovskite are still noticeable around the big microcrystals (see red arrays and ESI†). The selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern gives further evidence of the chemical embedment. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3c2 (taken from the dashed box), the ring and dotted patterns are indexed to the graphitic carbon nanoparticles and the perovskite microcrystals separately, in agreement with the fact that the candle soot is really embedded into the perovskite (also see the Fig. S3†). The HRTEM in Fig. 3c3 demonstrates the high crystallinity of the perovskite grown (it appears to grow by filling the pores in the candle soot network) in mesoporous candle soot judging from the directional lattice fringes ascribable to the (100) plane (d = 0.22 nm), which seem to be uninterrupted by the intervening soot nanoparticles. The SEM image in Fig. 3c4 manifests that chemical engineering has filled the interstitial regions of the candle soot with perovskite at least near the interface ensuring the interpenetration conducive to the efficient charge separation. Of note, the pre-wetting and preconditioning of the carbon surface in the step of CH3NH3I bath soaking and ensuing crystallization have also played a large role in securing such an interpenetrating interface.
After gaining a clear picture about the structural and electronic characteristics of the engineered interfaces of candle soot/perovskite, we now compare the performance of the three generations of clamping solar cells fabricated by direct clamping, rolling-transfer clamping and chemically promoted clamping, respectively. Fig. 4a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the relevant performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The result underscores the progressive interface engineering efforts that have made the clamping solar cells more and more efficient from generation to generation, evolving into the final high-performing device. Even though the 1st generation solar cells are made by direct clamping, it still achieves a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 8.23 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.38, amounting to a 2.60% PCE. The bottlenecks are the inferior Jsc and FF, most probably arising from the existing contact blind points between candle soot and perovskite conceivable for a simple mechanical joint. In the 2nd generation, the Jsc is increased to 12.8 mA cm−2, FF to 0.50 and Voc to 0.85 V, yielding an impressively enhanced PCE of 5.44%. Two contributing factors can be considered for this performance enhancement. Firstly, the conductivity of candle soot has been significantly enhanced through calcination as has been mentioned above. Secondly, the rolling transfer technique has considerably compacted the candle soot carbon electrode to further lower the electric resistance and to encourage the intimate contacts with the perovskite. Although involving more control than the direct clamping mode, the rolling transfer technique is also viable for large scale production. At last, it is the chemical promotion strategy that has evolved the clamping solar cells to the best-performing 3rd generation with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 17.00 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.72, yielding an overall PCE of 11.02%. Equally impressive is the cell stability; after storage for over one month without encapsulation and special protection, the cell still retained >85% of the initial measured efficiency and there is no loss of Jsc at all (Fig. S4†). In principle, Voc and FF are related to the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) according to the standard equivalent diode circuit model of solar cells. From the derivative of the J–V curves, the resistances can be estimated through the equation R = −(dJ/dV)−1, and the resulting resistance–voltage (R–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4b for all of the three generation solar cells. It can be seen that Rs decreases whereas Rsh increases from generation to generation, in association with the improved FF and Voc resulting from the increasing sophistication of the interface engineering. To the best our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency among hole transporter-free and Au-free perovskite solar cells. For the sake of direct comparison, an Au cathode sputtering deposited on an FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibited a PCE of 4.90% (Fig. S5†), while a graphite plates/perovskite clamping solar cell exhibited a PCE of 0.99% (Fig. S6†).

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra specify the ratio of the extracted current to incident photons at a given wavelength. Fig. 4c presents the corresponding IPCE curves of the above three generations of clamping solar cells. Obviously, the resultant IPCEs generally increase in the order of the 1st generation < 2nd generation < 3rd generation, in concordance with the Jsc order. Similarly, all of the three generation clamping solar cells show a good photon-to-electricity conversion ability in the blue and green light region (<600 nm) but poor conversion capacity in the red light region (600–800 nm); a linear decrease from 740 nm and cut off at 800 nm, the lower IPCE value at longer wavelengths (>700 nm) is attributed to the poor absorbance ability in this region (refer to Fig. S2a†), which is consistent with previous spiro-MeOTAD based perovskite solar cells.3,6,35 Integration of the products of the AM 1.5G photon flux with a given IPCE spectrum yields a predicted Jsc of 7.56 mA cm−2, 11.51 mA cm−2 and 16.30 mA cm−2 for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation of clamping solar cells, respectively, in excellent agreement with the J–V results. In order to investigate the reproducibility of the 3rd generation clamping solar cell, 50 separate devices were fabricated and tested, histograms of the cell-performance PCE is presented in Fig. 4d. As can be seen from the results, the average PCE is located at about 9.63%, while the lowest efficiency is 8.60% and the highest efficiency is 11.02%. In general, after the development of three generation candle soot/perovskite solar cells, we can achieve a relatively high PCE up to 11.02% with good reproducibility.
Conclusions
To sum up, we have established a cost-efficient, environmentally stable and abundant candle soot as an efficient hole extractor and developed a concept of clamping solar cells by judiciously interfacing the candle soot with CH3NH3PbI3 films. In this effort, three generations of clamping solar cells were evolved from direct clamping to rolling-transfer clamping and to chemically promoted clamping accelerated by the mechanistic understanding of inner workings. Up to this stage, the third generation clamping solar cells have already achieved a remarkable efficiency of 11.02% and good long term stability. Femtosecond time-resolved PL and distance dependent PL measurements have confirmed the conclusion that the improved PCE is largely due to the enhanced directional hole extraction at the candle soot/perovskite interface through the mechanical and chemical promotion strategies. Thus we have shown that the clamping solar cells represent a new type of easily processable but high performing photovoltaic device. The present work has not only promoted the fundamental understanding of the clamping cell working mechanisms but also made great headway towards roll-to-roll production and realistic commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Materials preparation
An FTO-candle soot film was directly deposited by putting a FTO glass in the candle flame for about 1 min. Black candle soot powder was collected by putting the glass in the candle flame and scrapping the powder off. The soot powder was further calcined at 1000 °C in argon gas. To prepare candle soot solid tape, calcined candle soot was dispersed in ethanol to make a slurry (10 wt%) firstly, the obtained slurry was then pasted on a Cu foil and dried at 80 °C for 10 min to obtain a carbon tape.
Solar cell device fabrication
Firstly, FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/PbI2 substrates were prepared according to a procedure reported previously with slight modifications (for details, refer to ESI†).6,36 For the 1st and 2nd generation clamping solar cells, the substrates were soaked into a CH3NH3I bath to get a CH3NH3PbI3 film. A piece of FTO-candle soot film and the CH3NH3PbI3 film were directly clamped to make the 1st generation clamping solar cells. For the 2nd generation clamping solar cells, a calcined carbon soot electrode about 10 μm thick was rolling transferred onto the CH3NH3PbI3 film using the as-prepared carbon tape with a home-made rolling transfer equipment (the compression pressure is estimated to be about 10 MPa). Then another piece of FTO glass was clamped to the CH3NH3PbI3/C film. After rolling transfer, the calcined candle soot thin film was strongly attached onto the perovskite film and did not peel off even after purging with compressed air. In the case of the 3rd generation clamping solar cells, the calcined candle soot electrode was rolling transferred onto the PbI2 film before CH3NH3I bath treatment, and other procedures were similar to the 2nd generation clamping solar cell fabrication process.

Broader context
Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells are in the spotlight of research community and industrial sectors alike because of the remarkable photoelectric properties of the perovskite materials. Currently, the perovskite solar cells commonly use an organic hole transport material (HTM) and a noble metal electrode atop. However, the materials and the fabrication processes are expensive, and the HTM is air-sensitive, limiting the long-term stability of devices. In this work, we have accredited the environmental benign, ambient stable and earth-abundant candle soot as an efficient hole extractor for perovskite solar cells. Technologically, we have instituted a concept of clamping solar cells by simply but judiciously interfacing the candle soot with the CH3NH3PbI3 films. Up to this stage of development, the nanocarbon-based clamping perovskite solar cells have already achieved a remarkable efficiency of 11.02% and presented good long term stability. Thus we have shown that the nanocarbon-based clamping perovskite solar cells represent a new type of easily processable and inexpensive but high performing photovoltaic device. The present work has set the stage to push toward roll-to-roll production and realistic commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
