    , Accepted 24th September 2019First published on 25th September 2019AbstractThis is the first report on the highest efficiency NIR absorbing Aza-Bodipy small molecules. The molecular engineering of newly synthesized NIR absorbing Aza-Bodipy dyes consists of covalently linked phenothiazine (AZA-PTZ-BOD) and phenoxazine (AZA-POZ-BOD) moieties as terminal groups and Aza-Bodipy as a central core moiety. The highest efficiency for OPV devices of 8.23% is achieved for AZA-PTZ-BOD.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) will play a substantial role in the rising demand for energy because of their remarkable benefits such as lightweight, abundant functional materials, solution processability and high mechanical flexibility. However, one of the disadvantages of OSCs is the lack of light-harvesting in the NIR region with wavelengths above 760 nm, representing 43% of the total energy flux. Recently low band gap polymers were reported to fill this gap for OSC devices.1 Nevertheless, polymers are used as electron donors to achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼10–13%2,3 but several drawbacks are associated with it such as batch-to-batch variations, uncertain synthetic reproducibility, and tough purification procedures. As an alternative to polymers, small molecules have earned considerable attention in the past decade due to their strong absorption in the visible and near IR regions, high molar extinction coefficient, easier purification, better reproducibility and excellent light-absorbing properties.4
Near-infrared (NIR) organic small molecules are antiquated for applications of OSCs, including phthalocyanine,5 merocyanines,6 squaraine,7 isoindigos,8 borondipyrrromethanes9 and diketopyrrolopyrroles.10 Small molecules having efficient infrared absorbers, especially those absorbing in the spectroscopic range λ = 700–1000 nm for organic photovoltaic materials, are still rare.11 Organoboron complexes are well known versatile chromophores because of their high absorption coefficient, photochemical stability and fluorescent quantum yield.12 Indeed, nowadays researchers have used their derivatives as molecular probes13 and light-harvesters.14 The use of Aza-Bodipy dyes as an electron donor material was first reported by Biwa Ma et al. in 2011. However, the study of NIR Aza-Bodipy small molecule donor materials in organic photovoltaics is still inadequate.
Some of the previously reported Aza-Bodipy small molecule donor materials are demonstrated in Fig. 1.15–18 Recently the Christian Körner and Karl Leo research group reported an Aza-Bodipy based donor with a PCE of 4.5%.19 The desirable key parameters for an efficient photoactive materials are its intensive absorption up to the NIR region of the solar spectrum, high molar extinction coefficients, high thermal and photo-stability, and tunable redox properties.20 In this context, we have designed and synthesized novel NIR boron-Aza-dipyrromethene (Aza-Bodipy) chromophores with covalently linked electron donors phenothiazine (PTZ) and phenoxazine (POZ) along with naphthalene decorated like a butterfly conformation, coded as AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD (Fig. 1). Phenothiazine (PTZ) and phenoxazine (POZ) are a class of well-known donor molecules because of their aromatic nature and conjugation. They have many applications in different fields like organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), semiconductors, staining agents, chemical sensors, dye sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells and OPVs.21,22
 Fig. 1  Previously reported Aza-Bodipy based small molecular donor materials and our molecules for BHJ-OSC applications. 
We have employed these two donor SMs in combination with well-known acceptor PC71BM for the device performance of solution processed BHJ OSCs. After the optimization of the active layers, solvent vapour annealing (SVA), the OSCs based on AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ BOD active layers showed an overall PCE of about 8.23% and 7.42%, respectively. In order to scrutinize the reasons behind the difference in the photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs, we have studied the optical and electronic properties, the crystallinity of the active layers, charge carrier mobility, segregation of excitons and charge recombination mechanisms of the corresponding OSCs. The synthesis of target molecules AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD is well explained in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The UV-visible absorption spectra of AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD molecules have been recorded with 0.1 M concentration of dichloromethane (DCM) solution and relevant data compiled in Table 1 (Fig. 2). Both the molecules show the same absorption spectra and also show mainly two peaks with a broad absorption profile ranging from 290 to 1000 nm.

 Fig. 2  UV-visible absorption of AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD in DCM solution (S) and thin film (F). 
The maximum absorbance at λmax = 655 nm (ε = 6259 M−1 cm−1) and 653 nm (ε = 3581 M−1 cm−1), is attributed to the charge transfer transition from the phenothiazine and phenoxazine donor to the Aza-Bodipy acceptor. The highly intensive peak at lower absorption at λmax = 294 nm (ε = 12701 M−1 cm−1) and 361 nm (ε = 4366 M−1 cm−1) appeared from localized π–π* transition of the conjugate backbone of the molecules. We have also acquired the thin film absorption spectra of both molecules AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD on glass coated films. As compared to the solution state, solid state absorption of both molecules tailing up to 1050 nm and also red shifted ∼40 nm due to the strong π–π interactions of delocalized electrons in the solid state was observed.23 From Fig. 2 we have also observed that AZA-PTZ-BOD showed strong and broad absorption as compared with the AZA-POZ-BOD molecule and hence may helpful for more efficient exciton formation and higher short circuit current density (Jsc) and lead towards good photovoltaic performance.
As per the structure, both AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD molecules have a similar architecture, but the major difference between the molecules is the electron donating hetero atom such as sulphur and oxygen. The electronegativity of sulphur is less than that of oxygen, so it can increase the electron conjugation and push–pull effect in between the donor and acceptor units, which results in a high molar extinction coefficient and leads to high PCE of the AZA-PTZ-BOD molecule. To determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and other redox properties of AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD donor molecules, we have acquired the cyclic voltammogram (CV) in dry DCM solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAF) as the supporting electrolyte. The CV analysis of AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD is showed in ESI,† Fig. S2 and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. Both molecules showed similar CV plots and showing both oxidation and reduction potentials.
Here both molecules showed one quasi-reversible reduction peak attributed to the reduction of the Aza-Bodipy unit and also quasi-reversible oxidation peaks corresponding to extraction of an electron from PTZ, POZ and naphthalene units. The HOMO/LUMO energy level of both SMs is −5.08/−3.85 eV and −5.24 eV/−3.66 eV respectively; which are calculated using ferrocene (−4.8 eV) as a reference using equation EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 (Fc/Fc+)], and ELUMO = −e[Ered + 4.80 (Fc/Fc+)], respectively. Here E0-0 represents the band gap of both molecules calculated from E0-0 = EHOMO − ELUMO. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the PC71BM acceptor molecule are −5.90 and −3.91 eV respectively; from this we clearly found that the HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO energy level offsets between these SM donors and acceptor PC71BM are greater than the threshold value for the exciton dissociation and charge transfer (∼0.3 eV) (as shown in Fig. 4a) indicating that exciton dissociation and charge transfer at donor/acceptor interfaces is feasible in the active layer, when both SMs are to be employed as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor.24
TDDFT calculations were performed with functional basis B3LYP2/6-311g(d,p) in DCM solvent. The absorption wavelengths were computed from TD-DFT calculations almost near to experimental values in DCM. The transitions of AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD occur in the range between 450 to 1000 nm and 450 to 900 nm the major peak located at 642 and 695 nm respectively, the data reported in Tables S2 and S4 (ESI†). For the AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD molecules, the HOMO is located on the whole molecule. At the same time, the LUMO is mostly concentrated onto the electron deficient AZA-BODIPY moiety at the center. This process clearly indicates that the charge transfer transition emerged from the electron donating molecules of phenothiazine, phenoxazine and naphthalene to the AZA-BODIPY.
The structure of solution-processed BHJ solar cell devices made from AZA-PTZ-BOD:PC71BM and AZA-POZ-BOD:PC71BM blends is displayed in ESI,† Fig. S4. First of all we have scanned the photovoltaic performance of the OPV by changing the donor to acceptor ratios in the BHJ active blended thin films and found that the weight ratio of 1:1.5 (D:A) as SVA from chloroform solution showed the best performance for all the SMs. The current–voltage (J–V) plots under illumination and IPCE spectra of the OPV devices based on isolated AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD molecules with PC71BM (1:1.5) are shown in Fig. 3 and photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. OSCs based on as cast AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD showed poor performances with a PCE of 3.19% and 3.04%, respectively, and attributed to their lower Jsc values 9.48 mA cm−2 and 8.32 mA cm−2, respectively and also low values of FF (0.41 and 0.38 for AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD, respectively). The poor performance of the as cast OSCs may be due to the poor nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer which is hindering the exciton dissociation and charge extraction by the electrodes. Therefore, we have performed the best known process of the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) method for the deposition of the active layer as reported in the literature.

We have used THF for the SVA treatment (40 s) of active layers and the J–V characteristics under illumination are presented in Fig. 3 and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The overall PCE of the BHJs based on the SVA treated AZA-PTZ-BOD:PC71BM and AZA-POZ-BOD:PC71BM active layers improved to 8.23% and 7.24%, respectively. Increasing the PCE after SVA treatment is mainly due to the enhancing of the Jsc and FF. The SVA treatment of active layers of molecules is known to support the formation of favorable morphology by tuning domain sizes and crystallinity of the active layers.25 In order to get efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer, the BHJ active layer of the OSCs must exhibit bi-continuous interpenetrating networks between donor and acceptor.26
The SVA treatment may facilitate the molecular ordering of the donor and acceptor and it promotes efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the BHJ.27,28 The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OPV are shown in Fig. 3. The IPCE spectra showed two bands and the band at 350–500 nm is attributed to the photocurrent generation due to excitons generated in the PC71BM and the band beyond 500 nm may be attributed to the exciton generated in the donor molecules (AZA-PTZ-BOD or AZA-POZ-BOD). These results indicate that both PC71BM and donors contribute to the photocurrent generation in the OPV.
The value of Jsc estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra of OPV is compiled in Table 2. Moreover, the higher PCE of AZA-PTZ-BOD as compared to AZA-POZ-BOD because of higher values of both Jsc and FF, broader absorption and high value of hole mobility for the AZA-PTZ-BOD:PC71BM active layer.
The value of Voc for the OPV for AZA-PTZ-BOD is higher than that for AZA-POZ-BOD which is attributed to the deeper value of the HOMO energy level of the former than the latter, since the Voc in the BHJ OPV is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor. In order to get information about the effect of different donor unit, the exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities in the AZA-PTZ-BOD and AZA-POZ-BOD molecules were explained by the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) are shown in Fig. 4a. Jph is the difference between the current under illumination and in the dark, and Veff = Va − Vo, where Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero. It can be seen from these figures that Jph reaches saturation (Jphsat), when Veff > 1.0 V, indicating that at high effective voltage all the excitons are dissociated into free charges and collected at electrodes. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll) in the OSCs are estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jphsat at short circuit conditions and at maximum power point, respectively. The relatively high values of Pdiss/Pcoll (0.962/0.754) for the OSCs based on AZA-PTZ-BOD than that for AZA-POZ-BOD (0.934/0.703) demonstrate better exciton dissociation and charge collection in the AZA-PTZ-BOD based OSCs than the AZA-POZ-BOD counterpart which may be one of the reasons for high values of Jsc and FF for AZA-PTZ-BOD based OSCs.29 For the charge recombination processes in the OSCs, we have investigated the variation of Jsc with illumination intensity (Pin) of the OSCs based on optimized active layers and the results are shown in Fig. 4b.
 Fig. 4  (a) Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage and (b) dependence of Jsc with Pin for the OSCs based on optimized active layers. 
The variation of Jsc with Pin showed a relationship described as Jsc ∝ (Pin)α, where α is the exponent and its value is related to the degree of recombination. When the value of α is unity, then all the free charge carriers are separated out and collected at the electrodes before recombination, whereas when its value is lower than unity, charge recombination exists and is dominated by bimolecular recombination.30 The value of α of AZA-PTZ-BOD is 0.965 which is higher than that for AZA-POZ-BOD (0.934) indicating that the bimolecular recombination is suppressed and efficient carrier transport in the OSCs based on AZA-PTZ-BOD as compared to the AZA-POZ-BOD counterpart. The reduced bimolecular recombination is attributed to the higher and balanced charge carrier mobility in the OSCs based on AZA-PTZ-BOD and resulted in higher values of Jsc and FF.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the blended films was recorded to get information about the molecular ordering and crystallinity of the active layer (it has been explained ESI,† Fig. S5). In order to get information about the influence of SVA treatment on the charge transport, we have measured the hole and electron mobilities of the active layer via recording the dark J–V characteristics of the hole and electron mobility fitting them with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (explained in ESI,† Fig. S4a and b for hole and electron only devices, respectively). The reduced value of π–π stacking distance and increased crystallinity for AZA-PTZ-BOD might be favourable for charge transport and consistent with the values of hole mobilities.
In conclusion, we have performed the molecular engineering of phenothiazine and phenoxazine-based Aza-bodipy small molecules to develop high-performance electron donors. These materials exhibited suitable photonic properties, such as panchromatic absorption occupying the range 300 to 1000 nm wavelength. The solution-processed BHJ solar cells device shows 8.23% PCE for the AZA-PTZ-BOD:PC71BM blend which is higher than that for the AZA-POZ-BOD:PC71BM counterpart (7.24%) and is attributed to mainly higher values of Jsc and FF. The higher value of Jsc and FF was ascribed to the more balanced charge transport, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport and reduced bimolecular recombination. This is the highest PCE reported to date in the Aza-Bodipy based small molecules from solution-processed OSCs. This work conveys a way to design and develop a suitable small molecule electron donor with low synthetic process, easy purification and broad absorption for contributing to an electric current induced by the action of light.
