    , Accepted 25th February 2014First published on 26th February 2014AbstractA series of low bandgap copolymers composed of N-acyl-substituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrroles (DTPs) as the electron rich donor constituents (with various alkyl side chain patterns) combined with different electron deficient acceptor building blocks are developed for polymer solar cell applications. Due to the introduction of the N-acyl substituents, the HOMO energy levels of the push–pull copolymers decrease as compared to the N-alkyl-DTP analogues, resulting in an increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and hence solar cell performance. For an N-acyl-DTP-alt-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (PDTP-TPD) copolymer a bulk heterojunction device with a Voc up to 0.80 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.0% is obtained, the highest value for DTP-based polymer materials to date. Moreover, by implementation of a conjugated polyelectrolyte cathode interlayer the short-circuit current noticeably increases, enhancing the solar cell efficiency to 5.8%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are studied extensively since they offer the potential of low-cost solution processing and manufacturing of large areas via (roll-to-roll) printing technologies.1 Furthermore, they can be produced with tuneable colour and transparency on flexible substrates and they are light-weight, with attractive features that allow to target photovoltaic (PV) applications and products beyond traditional Si-based PVs. Through careful molecular and device engineering the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs have steadily increased to over 9%.1,2 The photoactive layer of high performance BHJ PSC devices consists of an intimate blend of a low bandgap electron donor polymer and a fullerene acceptor (most often [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester or PC71BM). The state of the art low bandgap copolymers are composed of alternating electron rich (donor) and electron poor (acceptor) heterocyclic moieties, affording intramolecular charge transfer and thereby broadening the absorption window. Conjugated polymer engineering mostly focuses on the design and variation of the donor and acceptor subunits. As such, the performance of PSCs based upon a wide variety of different push–pull copolymers has been reported and the fundamental understanding of molecular structure–device efficiency relationships has strongly increased.1 Prerequisites for high performance solar cells in terms of the electron donor copolymers are a high extinction coefficient throughout the whole solar emission range and a low-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level. While photon absorption is a determining parameter for the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the difference between the HOMO of the electron donor polymer and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the electron acceptor component has been shown to be proportional to the open-circuit voltage (Voc). A sufficiently large LUMO offset is required to provide enough driving force for electron transfer.1 On the other hand, an increase in the bandgap of the donor copolymer reduces the absorption width. In this respect, there is always a trade-off between Voc and Jsc, and fine-tuning of the HOMO–LUMO levels of the push–pull copolymers is imperative to achieve optimal solar cell efficiencies. An attractive approach to optimize the energy levels involves the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents on the conjugated polymer backbone. Fluorination has become a quite general and effective strategy, either on the donor or acceptor building block,2,3 resulting in a lowering of both the HOMO and LUMO levels. Combinations of several electron withdrawing groups have also been investigated.4
Copolymers composed of alternating N-alkyl-substituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrroles (DTPs) and various electron poor building blocks have been applied in PSCs with limited success,5,6 mainly due to the high HOMO levels, majorly determined by the electron rich DTP units. These high HOMO levels give rise to rather low Vocs and consequently, although Jscs as high as 14.9 mA cm−2 have been observed for DTP-alt-DPP copolymers,6b the highest PCE to be reported was only 2.8%.6a,h On the other hand, the DTP fused heterocyclic system also has a few important strengths. It is readily accessible and copolymers with thiophene have shown high charge carrier mobilities in field-effect transistors (FETs), despite being amorphous.7 Dye-sensitized solar cells based on DTP materials have shown excellent performances as well,8 and recently small molecule organic solar cells based on N-alkyl-DTP have afforded up to 4.8% efficiency.7,9
In 2010, Rasmussen and co-workers reported the synthesis of N-acyl-substituted DTPs,10 offering a novel pathway to lower the HOMO levels. In the present work we have employed this strategy towards the synthesis of alternating low bandgap copolymers, combining N-acyl-DTPs with variable side chain patterns with a number of different acceptor derivatives. For the solar cells based on these copolymers (in combination with PC71BM) the Voc was effectively enhanced (up to 0.80 V), enabling to obtain a record solar cell efficiency of 4.0% for DTP-based copolymers. By spin-coating an additional very thin conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) layer on top of the active layer,11 the short-circuit current density was further increased, leading to a maximum PCE of 5.8%.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
For the construction of the low bandgap copolymers, the Stille polycondensation reaction was chosen, combining distannylated N-acyl-substituted DTPs and several dibrominated acceptor derivatives. The required bis(trimethylstannyl)-N-acyl-DTPs 4a–c were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling of hexamethylditin and dibrominated DTP precursors 3a–c (Scheme 1), prepared by a literature procedure.10,12 This protocol consists of a copper catalyzed tandem reaction13 of an alkyl amide and 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene (1)14 to obtain DTPs 2a–c, followed by dibromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Three different alkyl side chain patterns were introduced to optimize polymer solubility, taking into account the side chain decoration of the acceptor building blocks, and the final active layer blend morphology. Synthesis of 2-ethylhexanamide15 and 2-propylpentanamide16 was carried out according to the literature and 2-hexyldecanamide was synthesized via a similar approach. As the purity of the bisstannyl-DTP monomers is of crucial importance for the correct stoichiometric balance in the polycondensation reactions to enable the formation of high molar mass materials, and the monomers (oily substances) cannot be crystallized, recycling (preparative) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was applied for monomer purification. In this way, residual amounts of monostannylated DTP and DTP oligomers were readily removed. Due to side reactions and the aim for high purity, the yields for the final stannylation step were moderate (39–55%).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of distannylated N-acyl-DTP monomers 4a–c. 
Dibrominated acceptors 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT 5),17 2,5-bis-[5′-bromo-3′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (DTTzTz 6),18 and 4,7-bis[5′-bromo-4′-(2′′-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT 7)19 were synthesized according to literature procedures, whereas 1,3-dibromo-5-(2′-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD 8) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and purified by preparative SEC prior to use. The Stille polycondensation reactions were performed under standard conditions (2.5 mol% Pd2dba3, 10 mol% P(o-tolyl)3, toluene/DMF, 105 °C, 1 h; Scheme 2) and the crude polymer materials were isolated upon precipitation in ice-cold methanol. No end-capping procedures were applied. The low molar mass fractions were removed by sequential Soxhlet extractions. The copolymers PDTP-DTTzTz-c and PDTP-TPD-c were readily soluble in chloroform. For PDTP-BT-c a fraction soluble in (hot) chlorobenzene was isolated by Soxhlet extraction. However, a large insoluble fraction remained in the Soxhlet thimble. PDTP-DTBT-b dissolved in (hot) o-dichlorobenzene only and for PDTP-DTTzTz-a no suitable solvent was found. In general, the solubility of the synthesized copolymers is lower as compared to the N-alkyl-DTP analogues (for example, the copolymer N-1-pentylhexyl-DTP-alt-BT was reported to be readily soluble in common organic solvents,6a whereas PDTP-BT-c has a very low solubility).
 Scheme 2  Polymerization of N-acyl-DTP monomers 4a–c with various acceptors by Stille cross-coupling (similar reaction conditions for all polymerizations: 2.5 mol% Pd2dba3, 10 mol% P(o-tolyl)3, toluene/DMF, 105 °C, 1 h; a, b and c denote the alkyl side chain patterns). 
The apparent molar masses of the polymers were determined by SEC relative to polystyrene standards (Table 1). As expected, the Mn of the soluble fraction of PDTP-BT-c was rather low (7.6 kg mol−1), but for the PDTP-DTTzTz-c and PDTP-TPD-c materials bearing long branched alkyl side chains reasonably high molar masses were obtained (28 and 29 kg mol−1, respectively). Since polymer chain length and purity are important factors determining solar cell performance,1,20 the low and high molar mass fractions of PDTP-TPD-c were separated by preparative SEC to yield a PDTP-TPD-c-H fraction with an Mn of 69 kg mol−1 (see Fig. S1† for chromatograms before and after preparative SEC). Fractionation of PDTP-DTTzTz-c was hindered by its strong aggregation in chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra in solution and thin film were recorded for all copolymers (Fig. 1). All polymers have a broad absorption in the visible region and PDTP-BT-c and PDTP-DTBT-b also absorb in the UV range. Upon transition from solution to the film, a broad shoulder around 760 nm appears in the spectrum of PDTP-BT-c, and the absorption maximum shifts from 632 to 651 nm. The PDTP-DTTzTz-c material shows a larger optical bandgap, in accordance with the electrochemical data (vide infra, Table 1). The wavelength at maximum absorption for PDTP-DTTzTz-c shows only a slight red shift from 572 nm to 580 nm upon transition to the film, probably because the polymer is already strongly aggregated in chloroform solution. A similar behaviour was previously observed for a 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-alt-dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (PCPDT-DTTzTz) copolymer.20a This is consistent with the observation that filtration over a 0.45 μm filter renders a colourless filtrate. PDTP-DTBT-b behaves in a similar manner since no substantial red shift is observed between the spectra in solution and film. Finally, PDTP-TPD-c does show a significant red shift of the absorption maxima in the thin film (from 610 and 666 nm to 644 and 685 nm, respectively). The relative intensity of the absorption band at higher wavelength slightly increases as well.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra for all soluble DTP-based copolymers in solution (left) and thin film (right; same colour code). 
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction peaks, respectively (see Table 1). The HOMO levels of all polymers are comparable, except for PDTP-TPD-c, which has a substantially deeper HOMO. If one compares these values with the previously reported HOMO energies for analogous N-alkyl-substituted DTP copolymers ‘alkyl-PDTP-BT’6a and ‘alkyl-PDTP-TPD’6c–e (Table 1 and Fig. S2†), it is clear that the HOMOs of PDTP-BT-c and PDTP-TPD-c are lowered substantially (by 0.46 and 0.30 eV, respectively) due to the introduction of the N-acyl groups.
DFT calculations
To analyze the interactions between the donor and the acceptor moieties of the polymers and their impact on the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the M05 (ref. 21) exchange-correlation functional and the 6-311G(d) basis set. The effects of the solvent (THF) were taken into account within the integral equation formalism of the polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM).22 All calculations were carried out using Gaussian09.23 First, the ground state geometries were fully optimized for the individual donor and acceptor moieties as well as for the donor–acceptor combinations (DA). Several conformations differing by the torsion angle between the donor and acceptor units have been considered and the most stable ones were selected to perform calculations on the dimers of donor–acceptor units (DADA). In the calculations, the large alkyl chains were substituted by methyl groups, which reduces the time required for the calculations without impacting the results. Using the optimized geometries, the energies and the topologies of HOMO and LUMO were determined (Table 1). The experimental trends are confirmed by the calculations, i.e. (i) PDTP-TPD has the lowest-energy HOMO, whereas the other N-acyl-DTP-based materials exhibit similar HOMO energies (most clear for the DADA systems), (ii) PDTP-DTTzTz has the highest LUMO, and (iii) replacing the alkyl by an acyl substituent stabilizes the HOMO by about 0.3 eV. The lowest HOMO of PDTP-TPD can be explained by referring to two effects: (i) the larger the difference between the HOMOs of the donor and acceptor moieties, the smaller the splitting of the HOMO levels and therefore the lower the HOMO of the DA and DADA oligomers, and (ii) in the case of similar energy levels, larger torsion angles – between the donor and the acceptor pairs or, for PDTP-DTTzTz and PDTP-DTBT, inside the acceptor – lead to smaller splitting and lower HOMO. So, the HOMO of the TPD acceptor (−7.67 eV) of PDTP-TPD is much lower than the HOMO of the N-acyl-DTP moiety (−6.01 eV), which gives a HOMO for the DA unit of −5.93 eV (i.e. close to the DTP donor unit). On the contrary, the splitting of the HOMO levels in PDTP-DTTzTz is larger since the HOMO of the DTTzTz acceptor is located at −5.87 eV (closer to the HOMO of the N-acyl-DTP moiety). Consequently, the HOMO of the DA unit goes up to −5.58 eV. Moreover, when going from the N-alkyl to the N-acyl derivatives, the stabilization of the HOMO of the oligomers results from a stabilization of the HOMO of the donor by 0.30 eV. Finally, as shown in Fig. 2, the delocalization of the HOMO over the whole system, and therefore the size of the units and the amplitude of the torsion angles, plays also a role on the evolution of the frontier orbital levels as a function of system size, going from DA to DADA.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate their photovoltaic properties, the N-acyl-DTP-based copolymers were blended with PC71BM and applied as photoactive layers in BHJ organic solar cells with a standard configuration (glass:ITO:PEDOT-PSS:active layer:Ca:Al, Table 2 and Fig. 3). The low solubility of PDTP-BT-c and PDTP-DTBT-b impeded smooth processing and led to poor active layer film quality and very low PCEs. For the devices with PDTP-DTTzTz-c:PC71BM (1:3 optimized ratio) active layer blends spin-coated from chlorobenzene (CB), a Voc of 0.64 V was obtained (PCE 2.47%), which is rather high when compared to most N-alkyl-DTP based copolymers.5,6 This is consistent with both the experimentally and theoretically derived deepened HOMO levels due to the introduction of the N-acyl groups. By using 1-chloronapthalene (CN) as a processing additive, the Jsc and fill factor (FF) were increased by approximately 10% and a PCE of 3.29% was obtained (Fig. 3 and Table 2).

The combination of TPD with various donor units has already been reported to lead to excellent solar cell performances and improved Voc’s.6c–e,24 As the PDTP-TPD copolymer showed the lowest HOMO value amongst the series, this material was thought to have the most promising characteristics to afford high solar cell efficiencies. TPD was combined with N-acyl-DTP 4c decorated with the longest branched alkyl side chain to ensure good solubility. Furthermore, the obtained crude polymer (after Soxhlet extractions) was further purified and fractionated by preparative SEC, which was previously shown to be an effective means to enhance solar cell performance (by improving material purity and increasing Mn).20 Processing PDTP-TPD-c-H:PC71BM (1:3 optimized ratio) blends from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) resulted in devices with an open-circuit voltage of 0.70 V and blends in chloroform afforded an even higher Voc of 0.80 V, the highest value reported for DTP-based copolymers to date. Addition of a processing additive (1,8-diiodooctane or DIO) again resulted in an increase in Jsc, which was most pronounced for chloroform as a solvent. In this case, the Jsc increased quite drastically (by a factor 3.5 up to 9.88 mA cm−2), without affecting the FF and Voc, giving rise to a PCE of 4.04% (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined for the best performing devices (Fig. 4), showing the PC71BM contribution at shorter wavelengths and a polymer contribution up to ∼650 or 750 nm for PDTP-DTTzTz-c and PDTP-TPD-c-H, respectively, in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectra.

The influence of the processing additives can be related to an optimized BHJ blend morphology, as clearly evidenced by AFM imaging.1f,6g The thin film topography of the active layers as investigated by PeakForce AFM showed (similar) large scale phase segregation if no processing additive was employed (Fig. 5). From these images, characteristic spherical structures can be observed, for which the calculated surface coverage was found to be ∼70–75%. Additionally, the obtained layers were subjected to conductive AFM (C-AFM) under positive and negative sample bias (Fig. S3†). Upon applying a positive bias, the spherical shapes showed conductivity, which was absent under negative bias. The opposite holds true for the space around the spherical shapes.25 This confirms the idea that these spherical structures consist mainly of PC71BM, and that the polymer rather forms the surrounding matrix. A similar topography has been described for other DTP-based materials.6f,g The observed large phase segregation is unfavourable for solar cell performance since it leads to a reduced interfacial area between PC71BM and copolymer, necessary for efficient charge separation. It is well known that processing additives can greatly suppress the size of these phase-segregated domains.1f Through the addition of a small amount of CN (for PDTP-DTTzTz-c) or DIO (for PDTP-TPD-c-H), a strong improvement in the blend (nano)morphology could be obtained (Fig. 5). This phenomenon was confirmed by C-AFM images under positive and negative bias showing a uniform conductance (Fig. S3†).

Finally, to enhance the PCE of the PDTP-TPD-c-H:PC71BM PSCs even further, an additional CPE interlayer26,27 was spin-coated between the active layer and the Al top electrode (replacing the oxidatively labile Ca layer). In previous work, we have introduced imidazolium-substituted ionic polythiophenes as effective cathode interlayer materials pushing up the efficiencies of polymer solar cells, mainly by increasing the short-circuit current.11,28 The addition of a thin cathode interlayer is generally believed to induce an aligned interphase dipole, reducing the contact resistance and affording more efficient charge extraction from the active layer to the top electrode. Two different CPEs, differing in their composition (homo vs. copolymer), side chain patterns and counter ions (Br and TFSI,28 see Fig. S4†), were applied on top of PDTP-TPD-c:PC71BM active layers to investigate their influence on the I–V characteristics. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 (EQEs in Fig. S5†), this resulted in a substantial increase of the Jsc for both cases (with smaller effects on Voc and FF). The effect was most pronounced for the CPE-TFSI interlayer, with a noticeable increase in Jsc of ∼35% (up to 13.3 mA cm−2), leading to a final PCE of 5.82%.
Conclusions
In summary, N-acyl-DTPs have been identified as attractive building blocks for light-harvesting low bandgap copolymers for organic photovoltaics. The open-circuit voltage of polymer solar cells derived from N-acyl-substituted DTP-alt-acceptor copolymers is notably higher than that previously observed for the N-alkyl-DTP analogues, with PDTP-TPD showing the highest Voc (0.80 V) among the series. Consequently, the solar cell efficiencies are significantly higher than for the best performing N-alkyl-substituted DTP-based polymer donor material reported so far (PCE of 2.8%).6a,hN-Acyl-substitution of DTP is hence an effective approach to an increased Voc for polymer solar cells. Moreover, the solar cell efficiencies were further enhanced by the addition of a conjugated polyelectrolyte cathode interlayer, mainly by an increase in short-circuit current, up to a PCE of 5.82%. Further improvements are currently pursued by continued energy level tailoring, variation of the (N-acyl-DTP) side chain pattern and device optimization.29
Experimental section
Materials and instruments
Unless stated otherwise, all reagents and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. 1,3-Dibromo-5-(2′-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD 8) (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was purified by preparative SEC prior to use. Preparative (recycling) SEC was performed on JAIGEL 1H and 2H/2H and 3H columns for monomers and polymers, respectively, attached to an LC system equipped with a UV detector (path 0.5 mm) and a switch for recycling and collecting the eluent (CHCl3: flow rate 3.5 mL min−1, injection volume 3.0 mL). Solvents were dried using a solvent purification system (MBraun, MB-SPS-800) equipped with alumina columns. NMR chemical shifts (δ, in ppm) were determined relative to the residual CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) or CDHCl2 (5.32 ppm) signals or the 13C resonance shift of CDCl3 (77.16 ppm). For the N-acyl-substituted DTPs quantitative 13C NMR measurements were obtained with chromium(III) acetylacetonate as a relaxation agent. High resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source operating in the nebulizer assisted electrospray mode. The instrument was calibrated in the m/z range 220–2000 using a standard solution containing caffeine, MRFA and Ultramark 1621. UV-vis measurements were performed on a VARIAN Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a scan rate of 600 nm min−1. The films for the UV-vis measurements were prepared by drop-casting the polymer solutions (PDTP-BT-c in chlorobenzene, PDTP-DTBT-b in (warm) o-dichlorobenzene, and PDTP-DTTzTz-c and PDTP-TPD-c in chloroform) on a quartz substrate. The solid-state UV-vis spectra were used to estimate the optical band gaps from the wavelength at the intersection of the tangent drawn at the low energy side of the absorption spectrum with the x-axis; Eg (eV) = 1240/(wavelength in nm). FT-IR spectra of 2-hexyldecanamide and dibrominated DTPs 3a–c were recorded as thin films on a NaCl disk with a Bruker Tensor 27 from 1000 to 4000 cm−1. Analysis of the molar masses and molar mass distributions of the polymers was performed on a Tosoh EcoSEC System comprising of an autosampler, a PSS guard column SDV (50 × 7.5 mm), followed by three PSS SDV analytical linear XL columns (5 μm, 300 × 7.5 mm), a differential refractive index detector (Tosoh EcoSEC RI) and a UV-detector (254 nm) using THF as the eluent at 40 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. In particular cases (due to solubility issues) a Spectra Series P100 (Spectra Physics) pump equipped with two mixed-B columns (10 μm, 2 × 30 cm, Polymer Laboratories) and an Agilent 1100 DAD UV detector (600 nm) was applied with chlorobenzene as an eluent at 60 °C and a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. Both systems were calibrated using linear narrow polystyrene standards. Electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry) were performed with an Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat using a three-electrode microcell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (Ag wire dipped in a solution of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile). The reference electrode was calibrated against ferrocene/ferrocenium as an external standard. Samples were prepared by dip-coating the Pt working electrode in the respective polymer solutions (also used for the film preparation for solid-state UV-vis). The CV measurements were done on the resulting films with 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile as the electrolyte solution. To prevent air from entering the system, the experiments were conducted under a curtain of Ar. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The HOMO–LUMO frontier energy levels were determined using the onset potentials for oxidation and reduction, referenced to ferrocene/ferrocenium, which is estimated to have an oxidation potential of −4.98 eV vs. vacuum.

Polymer synthesis


PDTP-BT-c
          . 
A solution of DTP monomer 4c (255.1 mg, 0.343 mmol) in dry toluene (10 mL) was added dropwise via a syringe to a mixture of 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (100.9 mg, 342 μmol), Pd2dba3 (7.9 mg, 8.6 μmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (10.5 mg, 34.3 μmol) in dry DMF (2.5 mL) under an inert atmosphere. After purging with N2 for 15 min, the mixture was heated to 105 °C for 1 h. The resulting blue-green solution was added dropwise to ice cold MeOH. The precipitate was filtered off and purified by subsequent Soxhlet extractions with acetone, hexanes, chloroform and chlorobenzene. The chlorobenzene fraction was precipitated in ice-cold MeOH to yield a black solid (28%). 1H NMR could not be recorded due to the low product solubility. GPC (chlorobenzene, 60 °C, PS standards): Mn = 7.6 kg mol−1, D = 1.1.



PDTP-DTTzTz-a
          . 
Similar to the procedure as outlined for PDTP-BT-c, but with a solvent mixture DMF–toluene 1:5. After precipitation in MeOH, the polymer could not be redissolved again.



PDTP-DTTzTz-c
          . 
Similar to the procedure as outlined for PDTP-BT-c. Soxhlet extractions were performed with acetone, hexanes and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was precipitated in ice-cold MeOH, yielding a black solid (89%). δH (400 MHz, CDCl3) 8.0–5.6 (br, 4H), 3.28 (br, 1H), 2.2–1.0 (br. 46H), 1.0–0.5 (br, 18H), GPC (THF, 40 °C, PS standards): Mn = 28 kg mol−1, D = 2.4.



PDTP-DTBT-b
          . 
Similar to the procedure as outlined for PDTP-BT-c. Soxhlet extractions were performed with acetone, hexanes, chloroform and chlorobenzene. The fraction remaining in the Soxhlet thimble was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene under reflux. The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo and added dropwise to ice-cold MeOH, yielding a black solid (62%). Due to the low product solubility, no NMR or GPC could be obtained.



PDTP-TPD-c
          . 
Similar to the procedure as outlined for PDTP-BT-c. Soxhlet extractions were performed with acetone, hexanes and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was precipitated in ice-cold MeOH, yielding a black solid (84%). δH (400 MHz, CD2Cl2): 9.50–8.10 (br, 1H), 8.10–6.30 (br, 1H), 4.10–2.80 (br, 3H), 2.50–0.40 (br, 44H), GPC (THF, 40 °C, PS standards): Mn = 29 kg mol−1, D = 2.1.

PSC processing and characterization
BHJ organic solar cells were produced using the standard glass:ITO:PEDOT-PSS:active layer:Ca:Al architecture. ITO (Kintec, 100 nm, 20 Ohm sq−1) covered glass substrates were cleaned thoroughly with soap, demineralized water, acetone and isopropanol prior to UV/O3 treatment for 15 min. Afterwards, PEDOT-PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene-sulfonic acid) was spin-coated at a thickness of approximately 30 nm. The rest of the processing was performed in an inert atmosphere (glove box), starting with an annealing step of 15 min at 130 °C. Consequently, the active layer, consisting of PDTP-DTTzTz-c:PC71BM (40 mg mL−1 total conc.) or PDTP-TPD-c-H:PC71BM (20 mg mL−1 total conc.), was spin-coated on top at varying thicknesses. As a final step, Ca and Al were deposited under vacuum as top electrodes with thicknesses of 30 and 80 nm, respectively. In this way, an active device area of 3 mm2 was obtained. For the devices containing the CPE materials (see structures in Fig. S4†), the cathode interlayers were spin-coated on top of the active layer (from a 0.025 w/v% solution in MeOH) before deposition of the Al top electrode.11,27bI–V characteristics were measured using a Newport class A solar simulator (model 91195A) calibrated with a silicon solar cell to give an AM 1.5G solar spectrum. For AFM imaging, a Bruker Multimode 8 AFM was used. C-AFM images were made using Pt/Ir coated probes with a force constant of ∼0.4 N m−1 at bias voltages of +5 or −5 V with a maximum deflection setpoint of 0.6 V. EQE measurements were performed with a Newport Apex illuminator (100 W xenon lamp, 6257) as the light source, a Newport Cornerstone 130° monochromator, and a Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifier for the current measurements. A silicon FDS100-CAL photodiode was employed as a reference cell.
