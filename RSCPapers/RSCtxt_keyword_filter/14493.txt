    , Accepted 22nd August 2020First published on 23rd August 2020AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) show promising applications in terrestrial power plant systems irrespective of curved surfaces, but still suffer from low efficiencies and poor stabilities. Here, we report a synergetic strategy of combining bromine (Br) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) additives to passivate both bulk and surface defects, leading to improved performance and stability of flexible PVSCs. Incorporation of Br suppresses the formation of halide vacancies in the perovskite bulk, while CTAC further modifies the film surface with reduced defects and enhanced hydrophobicity features. As a result, flexible PVSCs with efficiencies over 18% are achieved with high reproducibility, compared to the control devices with efficiencies about 17%. Our flexible PVSCs present excellent ambient stability against moisture, keeping over 90% of the initial efficiency after exposure to 90% humidity for about 170 hours. Our work offers a facile and universal strategy for the fabrication of high performance and stable flexible PVSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have gained tremendous progress in the past decade due to their unique optoelectronic properties.1,2 Accordingly, single-junction perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have rapidly achieved the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%.3 Low-temperature processability of perovskites enables the fabrication of flexible PVSCs with high PCEs over 21%.4 Since flexible PVSCs have promising applications in terrestrial power plants, buildings, and portable electronics due to their light weight and low cost, further enhancement of the performance and stability of flexible PVSCs is highly desired.5–7 Engineering the compositional elements of perovskite materials is an efficient route to enhance the performance of PVSCs, e.g., B-site metal elements and X-site halides in the ABX3 structure.8–11 Theoretical calculations imply that substituting iodine (I) with bromine (Br) or chlorine (Cl) in perovskites could reduce the defect density due to the elimination of I vacancies.12 However, the high concentration of Br and Cl in pure lead-based perovskite materials increases the optical bandgap, away from the ideal bandgap (i.e., 1.34 eV) for single-junction solar cells, leading to low photocurrent and efficiency.13,14 Moreover, phase segregation is also detrimental to improving the performance of PVSCs if over 30% Br is used.15,16 Thus, the trade-off between the reduction of iodine vacancies and the increase in the bandgap can lead to the best mixed halide PVSCs. Recently, McGehee and co-workers reported that triple halide (Cl, Br, and I) wide-bandgap perovskite light absorbers have excellent optoelectronic properties with fewer defects and suppressed phase segregation, enabling high-performance single-junction and tandem PVSCs.17
Instability of perovskites hinders their commercialization.18 High energy photons, high temperature, super-oxygen, water molecules, electrical bias, and so on cause the degradation of perovskite materials under ambient conditions.19–21 Numerous approaches have been proposed to improve the perovskite film and device stability, for example, proper encapsulation,21 surface/grain boundary passivation and low-dimensional perovskite doping.22,23 Among them, passivation via a hydrophobic polymer is considered as an effective route. We have reported that the amphiphilic block-copolymer F127 simultaneously enhances the performance and stability of planar PVSCs.24 An alternative molecule is anticipated for highly efficient flexible PVSCs.25 Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) with amphiphilic properties is a good candidate for the performance enhancement of PVSCs, and it could be introduced onto the perovskite surface via a mediator–antisolvent strategy.26 The long chain CTA+ cation would be anchored on the surface leading to a more hydrophobic feature, while the chlorine (Cl−) species would be residual at the surface of lead iodide (PbI2) rich perovskite during annealing, passivating the surface defects of the final perovskite film.27,28
Here, we report a synergistic strategy of incorporating both Br and CTAC at separate stages of processing perovskite absorbers to enhance the efficiency and stability of flexible planar PVSCs. We mix Br into the perovskite precursor, and we dissolve CTAC into the anti-solvent and apply it by dripping during spin-coating, leading to reduction of the charge trap defects in the bulk, as well as modulation of the perovskite surface and improvement of the moisture tolerance, respectively. The substitution by Br sufficiently suppresses the formation of halide vacancies in the bulk due to the strengthened chemical bonds, thus reducing charge recombination losses. CTAC acts as a bi-functional molecule with amphiphilic features that simultaneously passivates the surface defects and correlates the reaction of the hydrophilic part with perovskites through hydrogen bonds; moreover, the hydrophobic part forms dangling bonds, resisting water incorporation. As a result, we achieve highly efficient flexible PVSCs with the best PCE over 18% and good bending endurance. Our device sustains over 90% of the initial efficiency after 168 hour exposure to a high humidity (∼90%). We also apply such a universal strategy to small-area rigid and large-area 1 cm2 flexible PVSCs with efficiencies of 21.03% and 16.12%, respectively. Our work provides an effective approach to fabricate efficient and stable flexible PVSCs and scale up into large-area devices.
Results and discussion
We use MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 with a bandgap of 1.57 eV as the reference absorber, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium.29–31 We firstly incorporate Br into the perovskite to form the MA0.7FA0.3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 through compositional engineering, and then introduce CTAC molecules at the top surface of the perovskite film by dripping the CTAC/chlorobenzene solutions during spin-coating. Pure CTAC treatment is also applied to verify the synergism of Br and CTAC. Fig. 1(a)–(d) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films containing no Br (refers to Control, i.e. MA0.7FA0.3PbI3), 5 mol% Br (refers to 5% Br, i.e. MA0.7FA0.3Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3), 0.01% CTAC (refers to 0.01% CTAC, i.e. MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 + 0.01% CTAC), and 5% Br with 0.01 wt% CTAC (refers to 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC), respectively. The bright crystals at the grain boundaries and the surfaces are excessive PbI2 due to the usage of Pb(SCN)2 as the additive in the precursor in order to assist the grain growth.32,33 PbI2 has various effects on device performance,34–36 and here in this work, the PbI2 particles have positive effects that passivate the grain boundaries and reduce the dark current. Obviously, in SEM images, the incorporation of Br has indeed enlarged the grains, which is beneficial for PVSCs due to reduction of grain boundaries.37 The crystal size is increased from several hundred nm up to almost 2 μm with more uniform size distribution and a homogeneous surface. Pure CTAC treatment has a negligible effect on the perovskite film grains. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), after the introduction of CTAC, the perovskite film shows a very thin extra layer on the top, which could be ascribed to CTAC molecules that cannot interpenetrate into the lattice due to their large size. In addition, the bright PbI2 particles are not only located at the grain boundaries, but also distributed on the surface of large crystals, indicating a PbI2 rich surface with more homogeneous distribution. We suppose that this should be ascribed to the CTAC assisted nucleation process with more nuclei and the Pb(SCN)2 converted PbI2 has been elevated to the crystal surface during merging.38 Greater size crystals usually exhibit a higher crystallinity. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these perovskite films with different compositions or treatments made on flexible substrates are shown in Fig. 1(e). With the incorporation of Br into the perovskite film, the peak shifts to a higher degree, indicating the shrinking of the perovskite lattice due to the smaller molecule size of Br compared to I.2 This confirms the successful incorporation of Br into the perovskite. The following CTAC coating has negligible influence of the diffraction peak position, implying that CTA+ or Cl− ions have not been incorporated into the perovskite bulk due to their ultralow amount on the film surface. Moreover, the peak intensity was enhanced for the film with Br (5% Br and 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC) and the full-width-half-maximum of the (110) peak decreased (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating better crystallinity in Br-based absorbers compared to the Br-free film. However, the solely CTAC treatment has a slightly adverse effect, causing lower peak intensity.

(h) Light intensity dependence of the open-circuit voltage of flexible PVSCs with different Br and CTAC concentrations. 

Fig. 1(f) shows the absorption and normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films with different compositions deposited on bare glass substrates and measured from the film side. The 5% Br film shows a big shift of the PL emission peak to the short wavelength region compared to the Br-free film, while the 0.01% CTAC film has no influence on the PL position. However, further introduction of 0.01% CTAC onto the 5% Br containing film presents a very slight blue shift of the PL emission peak. We suppose that this gentle blue shift should be attributed to the passivation of surface defects and/or the formation of the triple halide (Cl, Br, and I) perovskite top layer.17 The surface of our perovskite film has a PbI2 rich feature; therefore, we suppose that the chlorine from the CTAC molecule is not easy to evaporate by forming MACl or FACl due to the lack of organic species (MA+ or FA+) at the film surface.39 Since it has been reported that triple halide perovskite has better optoelectronic properties and suppressed phase segregation, we suppose that the Br and CTAC co-modified PVSCs should have better performance than the Control and CTAC solely modified ones (discussed in the following). The absorbance spectra of the perovskite film with different compositions indicate that 5% Br based absorber layers have an increased bandgap compared to Control and CTAC films, while the 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC film has an improvement in the wavelength range of 650–750 nm. We also performed the time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement to compare the carrier lifetimes of Control, 5% Br, 0.01% CTAC, and 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1(g), the PL spectrum of the pure CTAC modified film shows faster quenching compared to the Control, however, the spectra of Br containing films have a slower decay feature than that without Br, indicating prolonged carrier lifetimes, especially for the Br + CTAC film with the lowest quenching speed. By fitting the curves with a bi-exponential decay formula, we obtained the carrier lifetimes of 205 ns, 344 ns, 186 ns, and 485 ns for Control, 5% Br, 0.01% CTAC, and 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC films, respectively.32 We attribute this enhancement of the carrier lifetime of the Br-incorporated film to the reduction of charge trap density, leading to suppressed formation of halide vacancies, and further Cl introduction passivated the defects at the film surface. Yin and co-authors reported that the presence of iodine vacancies could cause the shrinking of the perovskite octahedra due to the column force between two adjacent lead atoms, leading to positively charged traps.12 The positive defects could trap photogenerated electrons, thus leading to high carrier non-radiative recombination and deterioration of the performance.40 After the elimination of defects in the bulk of the absorber film by Br incorporation, chlorine from the CTAC molecule could further passivate the film surface and grain boundaries, leading to the expected better photovoltaic performance of corresponding PVSCs. However, the pure CTAC modification has adverse influence on the film quality and devices, which could be ascribed to the substitution of a little bit of I− ions at the perovskite film surface by Cl− ions from the CTAC. However, this would lead to some lattice distortion or defects at the film surface because of the large ionic radium difference between I− (2.07 Å) and Cl− (1.67 Å).28,41
We conducted the light intensity dependence test of VOC and JSC of PVSCs with different compositions to verify our hypothesis. The light dependences of VOC of the considered three PVSCs are examined using natural filters under identical illumination conditions, as shown in Fig. 1(h). The VOC has a linear relationship with the natural logarithmic light intensity, showing a slope of nkT/q, where n is the ideal factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the unit charge. The ideal factors are 1.52, 1.40, 1.54, and 1.34 for Control, 5% Br, 0.01% CTAC, and 5% Br + 0.01% CTAC based devices, respectively. The results reveal the presence of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in all devices, since the n is larger than 1 for all. The system with 5% Br has a lower slope than the Control and CTAC ones, suggesting lower trap-assisted recombination due to the bulk passivation, while the Br + CTAC film based PVSC has the lowest ideal factor, implying that the synergistic effect of Br and CTAC could reduce the defect level by both bulk and interface passivation strategies. The light intensity dependence of JSC is shown in Fig. S2,† and the Br + CTAC presents the best performance.
During the optimization of flexible PVSCs, we first scrutinized the effect of Br concentration on the performance, and then chose the optimal 5% Br for further CTAC treatment. SEM images of perovskite films with different Br concentrations are shown in Fig. 1 and S3.† Relatively large grain size Br incorporated films are achieved compared to the Br-free perovskite films. For the perovskite film with different Br contents, we calculated the corresponding bandgap of each film using the Lambert–Beer law (Fig. S5†). As the concentration of Br increases, the optical bandgap of the films increases and the PL peak has a blue shift.42,43 The bandgap of 1.57 eV for the pure I− based perovskite is increased to 1.60 eV by adding 5% Br, showing the capability of bandgap tuning.15,37 We fabricated flexible PVSCs to evaluate the effect of Br concentration on the device performance. The J–V curves of the corresponding devices with varying Br concentration from 0% to 10% are displayed in Fig. S6† and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table S1.† The statistical photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding PVSCs are shown in Fig. S7,† and the statistics are listed in Table S2.† It is found that the VOC is increased and the short-circuit current density (JSC) is decreased monotonically with increasing the Br concentration, which is consistent with the trend in the optical properties of the Br-incorporated films. The fill factor (FF) is firstly increased and then decreased. Overall, the flexible 5% Br PVSC achieves the highest PCE of 17.51% with much improved VOC and FF compared to the reference device (17.04%). Their EQE spectra (Fig. S8†) show that the cut-off point of the spectral response moves to the shorter wavelength region, indicating the primary origin of the reduced JSC from the increase in bandgaps for Br-incorporated perovskites.
We further coated the 5% Br film with CTAC via interface engineering to improve the device performance and operation stability. CTAC solutions with various concentrations dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) were dropped on top of the perovskite film during spinning to serve as the anti-solvent.44 As a result, CTAC would form an ultra-thin layer on the perovskite surface and exist at the grain boundaries of perovskites after annealing.24 We measured the PL and absorption spectra of 5% Br containing perovskite films with different amounts of CTAC, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and S10,† respectively. As the CTAC concentration increases, the PL intensity firstly increases and then decreases, exhibiting the highest intensity at 0.01% CTAC, while the absorption spectra present a negligible change, implying that CTAC does not affect the bandgap in the predominant bulk zone due to its ultra-low concentration and presence at the top surface.27Fig. 2(b) shows the TRPL results of perovskite films with different CTAC concentrations. The carrier lifetimes of CTAC based films first increase and then decrease, agreeing well with the steady-state PL measurements. The prolonged carrier lifetime enables sufficient charge transfer across the device, beneficial for the overall performance.45,46 However, when the CTAC concentration is higher than 0.01%, the carrier lifetime decreases, we suppose that this should be related to the combined influence of Cl− and CTA+ ions simultaneously.47,48 Since CTA+ is a long chain alkyl part that would not affect the main carrier lifetime due to the insulating feature, the Cl ion should be responsible for the decreased carrier lifetimes of perovskite films.28Fig. 2(c) shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films with various concentrations of CTAC. The (110) and (220) peaks almost do not change at the fixed angle, indicating that CTAC is not incorporated into the perovskite lattice. The intensities of these two diffraction peaks also firstly increase and then decrease, implying that the optimal CTAC could facilitate the grain growth; however, a higher concentration would deteriorate the film quality due to the impurity feature.25 Moreover, a thick polymer layer would hinder the charge transport due to its intrinsic insulating nature, which degrades the device performance.24

(e) XPS results of the perovskite film treated with CTAC and CTAB. (f) J–V curves of PVSCs based on perovskite light absorber layers treated with CTAC and CTAB. 
The J–V curves of all CTAC concentrations ranging from zero to 0.04% are shown in Fig. S11† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S3.† All EQE results of PVSCs with different concentrations of CTAC are presented in Fig. S12.† However, flexible PVSCs with higher contents of CTAC over 0.02% have a lower EQE response, which might be ascribed to the inhibition of charge diffusion by the thick insulating layer. We fabricated 20 flexible PVSCs for each CTAC concentration. The statistical PCEs, VOC's, JSC's, and FFs of these devices are displayed in Fig. S13† and summarized in Table S4.† The PCE has a peak at 0.01% CTAC, similar to VOC, JSC and FF trends. We explain that a small amount of CTAC is not sufficient to passivate the perovskite surface and grain boundaries in perovskites, while too large amount of CTAC would form a relatively thick insulating layer which hinders the charge transport due to the insulating nature of CTAC.49–51Therefore, a suitable amount of CTAC is necessarily continuous and ultra-thin, enabling the passivation of both positively and negatively charge defects on the surface of the perovskite layer and the tunneling of the carrier to the charge-selective layer.52
As we mentioned above, Cl− might also affect the optoelectronic properties of corresponding perovskite films, and therefore, we choose different treatments to investigate the influence of halides on the perovskite film. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was employed here to modify the mixed cation mixed halide perovskite to investigate the influence of the surface passivation strategy on the final performance of PVSCs.25 CTAB was used with the identical concentration and treatment process to those of CTAC. The PL results of CTAB and CTAC treated perovskite films illuminated from the film side and glass side are shown in Fig. 2(d). The PL intensity of the CTAC coated film is relatively higher than that of the CTAB based one when illuminated from the film side, while they are almost the same when illuminated from the substrate side. This indicates that CTAC could efficiently reduce the nonradiative recombination at the very thin film surface without affecting the deep zone in the bulk.27,53 Since our light absorber perovskite films are PbI2 rich layers, Cl could not complex with organic cations at the surface to form volatile species, and therefore, Cl would be residual at the film surface.39,54,55 In order to determine the presence of Cl at the film surface, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of perovskite films with different halide treatments, as shown in Fig. 2(e). The CTAC treated film has a distinguishable Cl 2p peak at the binding energy around 200 eV, indicating the presence of a trace amount of Cl at the film surface.54 We suggest that the Cl ion has a gradient distribution from the surface to the bulk due to the slow diffusion and substitution of Br or I ions.25,56 And the coexistence of triple halide should be responsible for the better photovoltaic performance of corresponding PVSCs, as shown in Fig. 2(f).17,57 The CTAC based PVSC has a PCE of 18.02%, higher than that of the CTAB PVSC (17.64%).

Fig. 3(a) shows the J–V curves of flexible none Br PVSCs and Br-based PVSCs with 0% and 0.01% CTAC. First, Br substitution improves the cell performance by enhancing the voltage and FF, however sacrificing the current. The 5% Br based PVSC shows an improved efficiency of 17.51% compared to that of the reference one (17.03%). However, the pure CTAC coating reduced the overall device performance to 16.50%, which should be ascribed to the poor film quality as found above. As shown in Fig. 1, the PL emission peak of CTAC has a slight blue shift compared to Control, which might be ascribed to the substitution of I by Cl.41 And the CTAC treated film has a faster PL quenching, which might be ascribed to the lattice distortion and occurrence of defects due to the Cl− (1.67 Å) substitution of I− (2.07 Å) since these two atoms have a large size difference,28,58 while the surface lattice strain would be mild if Cl− substitutes Br− (1.84 Å) rather than I− due to the smaller ion radius difference.28 Therefore, the synergistic effect between the Br compositional engineering and the Cl surface passivation should be responsible for the best performance of corresponding PVSCs.41 Incorporating a small amount of CTAC (no more than 0.01%) in conjunction with optimal Br content can boost the device performance. Therefore, the best flexible PVSC achieves a PCE of 18.20% at 0.01% CTAC, with a FF of 0.763. It is worth noting that such a high FF over 0.76 is among the best FF values reported for flexible PVSCs to date, since the low-temperature processed ITO layer has a high sheet resistance over 45 Ω cm−2, leading to a relatively poor FF.59 The bulk passivation strategy by Br substitution removed iodine vacancies that act as deep level defects, while the surface passivation method with CTAC eliminated the surface defects, and therefore the sequential treatments facilitate charge transport in the flexible device, enabling a high FF of our flexible PVSCs. Fig. 3(b) shows the EQE spectra of PVSCs without Br and Br containing PVSCs with 0% and 0.01% CTAC. The devices without Br have an EQE cut-off over 800 nm, while the Br incorporated PVSCs show a blue shift. The best flexible device with 0.01% CTAC shows an improved EQE over 80%, reflecting enhanced light conversion capability. Particularly, the spectral response ranging from 700 to 750 nm for the Br + CTAC device is much enhanced compared to that for the control device. We attribute this to the improved crystallinity and carrier lifetime upon proper CTAC incorporation, leading to reduced non-radiative recombination.

We then recorded the cross-sectional SEM images of the control device (without Br and CTAC) and the target device (with Br and CTAC) to study the charge transport capability inside the devices, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. Both devices have the same film thickness. The target one has relatively larger grains with much fewer horizontal boundaries, primarily ascribed to the increased crystal size by Br incorporation. Br ions are incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution through PbBr2, and Br will replace part of I resulting in the lower formation of nucleation centers and increase in the size of perovskite grains.60 As depicted in Fig. 3(e), iodine vacancies are easily occured at grain boundaries and film surfaces. As reported, Br reduces the formation of I vacancies, thus passivating the positively charged defects. CTAC as a cationic surfactant, which is resistant to strong acids and bases, has stable chemical properties, and is soluble in organic solvents. When CTAC is attached to the perovskite surface, the methyl end will be outward as a hydrophobic dangling bond, which can increase the resistance of the perovskite film to the moisture, as shown in Fig. 3(f).
We then compared the effect of CTAC on the water resistance of the perovskite films. Fig. 4(a) shows that the control film has a contact angle of 61.6°, and the film with 0.01% CTAC has a contact angle of 101.6° (Fig. 4(b)). CTAC is an amphiphilic molecule, i.e., the hydrophilic part could interact with perovskite through hydrogen bonding during spin-coating, while the hydrophobic part could be exposed out to form dangling bonds.24 Therefore, the CTAC-treated perovskite film presents more hydrophobic features than the control one, benefiting suppressed degradation against moisture under ambient or high humidity conditions.61 We carried out a further test by putting all types of perovskite films in a closed environment with 90% relative humidity at room temperature (Fig. S15†) and took the samples out for transmission measurements at a specific period of time. The transmittance spectra of all perovskite films in Fig. 4(c) show that the film without CTAC is decomposed quickly to have no perovskite phase, while the other films with CTAC incorporated keep a sharp absorption at around 800 nm for seven days with a negligible change. The results confirm the improvement of moisture stability of perovskite films by CTAC modification. We further checked the XRD patterns of these perovskite films, which were exposed to 90% high humidity for seven days. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the perovskite without CTAC is decomposed to PbI2 completely, i.e., the high peak at 12.8° is maintained and the (110) peak at around 14° decreases significantly. However, the samples with CTAC maintain the perovskite phase without an obvious change for 168 hours. The experimental process of the humidity stability test is shown in Fig. S15,† and all samples were placed in a homemade setup under approximately 90% high humidity conditions. The photos of the samples with and without CTAC exposed to a relative humidity of 90% for 0 and 168 hours are shown in Fig. 4(e). It is clear that the film without CTAC turns yellow, indicating its decomposition to PbI2. The film with 0.01% CTAC still keeps a dark brown colour after 168 hour exposure. The results indicate that CTAC could highly protect the perovskite films from degradation caused by moisture due to the hydrophobic feature. The corresponding films exhibit excellent moisture tolerance.

The # indicates the PbI2 peak, and the * indicates the (110) peak of perovskite. (e) Photos of perovskite films without and with CTAC coatings exposed to high humidity for different times. (f) Performance variations of flexible PVSCs without and with CTAC layers exposed to high humidity for different times. 
The stability dependence of flexible PVSCs on exposure time under high humidity is shown in Fig. 4(f). The CTAC-based flexible PVSC has a slight decrease from 18.2% to 16.4% after 168 hour exposure; however, the flexible PVSC without CTAC declines sharply to 0% upon exposure. As a result, the simultaneous effects of Br and CTAC facilitate the perovskite films to have greater crystal sizes, fewer defects, and more hydrophobic nature, thus leading to highly improved device performance and stability.
Br and CTAC synergistically boost the performance of flexible PVSCs. Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves of our best-performing flexible PVSC with 5% Br and 0.01% CTAC under forward and reverse scans under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination with a scan speed of 1 V s−1. The highest PCE of 18.20 (17.18)% under the reverse (forward) scan is achieved, with a VOC of 1.073 (1.072) V, a JSC of 22.20 (22.00) mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.763 (0.728). The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows a photo of our real flexible device. The power output was recorded using the maximum power point tracking method, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The output efficiency of 17% is stable for about 50 s under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. We also tested the bendability of our flexible PVSC (Fig. 5(c)). The bending radius was 5 mm. After 200 times bending, the efficiency dropped from 18% to about 16%, sustaining almost 90% of the initial efficiency, presenting reasonable bending endurance. The morphology of perovskite films has a negligible change before and after 200 times bending, as shown in Fig. S16.† We attribute the reduced PCE to the increased sheet resistance of the flexible ITO substrate as we reported previously.62 We also fabricated a large-area flexible PVSC with 1 cm2 active area, generating a PCE of 16.12 (14.42)%, with a VOC of 1.070 (1.033) V, a JSC of 21.24 (21.24) mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.709 (0.656) under the reverse (forward) scan, as shown in Fig. 5(d), and the inset shows the real device picture. The efficient large-area flexible PVSC presents the potential of flexible mini-modules.63 The rigid planar PVSCs fabricated with the same passivation strategy achieved a best PCE of 21.03 (20.05)%, with a VOC of 1.136 (1.116) V, a JSC of 22.97 (22.97) mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.806 (0.782) under the reverse (forward) scan, as shown in Fig. 5(e). This is a reasonable performance for the simple planar structure device with a facile fabrication process at low temperature below 100 °C. The EQE curve of the rigid PVSC is presented in Fig. 5(f), and the integrated current density is calculated to be 22.4 mA cm−2via the AM 1.5G spectrum, well consistent with the value obtained from the J–V curve. The good performance of both rigid and flexible devices confirms the validity and universal properties of our simple passivation strategy to obtain high efficiency solution processed low temperature photovoltaics compatible with large area fabrication.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated efficient and stable flexible PVSCs through the incorporation of Br and CTAC molecules. Br could reduce charge trap defects caused by halide vacancies, suppressing carrier recombination, and improving the flexible device performance. CTAC is a bi-functional molecule that both modulates the film through surface passivation and improves the device stability due to its more hydrophobic nature. Thus, we fabricated flexible PVSCs with over 18%-efficiency and high reproducibility and good stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial efficiency after 168 hour exposure to 90% high humidity.
