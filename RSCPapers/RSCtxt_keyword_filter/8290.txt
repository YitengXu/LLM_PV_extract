    , Accepted 4th November 2010First published on 6th December 2010AbstractA 1:1 mixture of two thiophene based poly(p-phenylene ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s denoted DO-PThE1-PPV2 (D1) and MEH-PThE1-PPV2 (D2), consisting of the same conjugated backbone but different types and volume fraction of alkoxy side chains on the phenylene ethynylene unit, has led to enhanced charge carrier mobility (measured using CELIV technique) as compared to the individual polymers. The resulting ternary blend with PC60BM showed better photovoltaic performance as compared to binary blends from the single polymers mixed with PCBM. This is due to the improved active layer nanomorphology in the ternary system as revealed by AFM studies.
Introduction
Photovoltaic devices based on organic polymers have the potential as low cost renewable energy sources to address the growing global energy needs.1,2 Among the various solar cell device architectures, the bulk heterojunction concept has proven to be the most efficient.1b,3 This concept is based on ultrafast photo-induced electron transfer from poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) to Buckminsterfullerene (C60)4 and the realization of improved performance of the first solar cell of this kind from poly(2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV):C60 blend.5 The concept involves nanoscale self-assembly of heterojunctions by spontaneous phase separation of the donor polymer and the acceptor, which leads to charge-separating heterojunctions throughout the bulk. The resulting photogenerated holes and electrons are then transported to the corresponding electrodesvia percolating pathways to provide a photocurrent. The high interest for polymer:fullerene based solar cells has triggered the design of a large number of novel conjugated polymeric donor materials such as derivatives of polythiophene, polycarbazole, poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) and combinations thereof6,7 as well as fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials.8
To improve the power conversion efficiency donor polymers should have low energy band gap so as to harvest light from most of the solar spectrum; this leads to higher short-circuit current density (JSC) and better overall performance. 1a,9 In addition to the required band gap and a match of the energy levels of the donor and of the acceptor components, a better nanostructural ordering to get optimized phase separation of both components and an efficient percolation of the photogenerated charges are crucial to improve the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells.10 Most studied approaches to improve the nanoscale morphology of the active layer are (1) thermal annealing,11,12 (2) solvent variation,13–15 and (3) using additives, like alkyldithioles12b,c,16 and diiodoalkanes,17 in the bulk heterojunction solution. A set of other approaches to efficiently control the active layer morphology has been reported in the literature, such as doping of the polymer with small molecules like triphenylamine,18 blending the active layer with ionic solid electrolyte (such as polyethylene oxide and LiCF3SO3),19 and ternary blends.
For instance, by using ternary thienothiophene copolymers as a nucleating agent, an enhancement of the degree of crystallization of P3HT in P3HT:PCBM system was observed. This increases the charge carrier transport properties and enlarges the active layer absorption spectrum.20 Electron transporting polymer, poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzolthiadiazole) (F8BT), mixed with PCBM blended with P3HT showed improved efficiency due to enhanced optical absorption, better charge collection and improved charge carrier mobility.21 Heeger et al. reported on a highly efficient tandem cell achieving an efficiency over 6% by utilizing two p-type conjugated polymers in the two independent active layers to effectively harvest the solar photons.22 A ternary blend bulk heterojunction consisting of two electron donor polymers, MDMO-PPV and P3HT, and PCBM as acceptor showed an improvement of the VOC at a minimum expense of the JSC.23 In a recent report two donor conjugated polymers, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and a dithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole based polymer, which are capable of absorbing light complementarily in the spectral region covering 400 to 900 nm, were used together with PC71BM to form a ternary blend system. This resulted in an improved photovoltaic performance as compared to the individual polymer:PC71BM blends.24
Here we report on photovoltaic device from ternary blend by mixing PC60BM with two thiophene-containing PPE-PPV based donor polymers having the same conjugated backbone but different alkoxy side chains grafted on the PE-segment, poly{1,4-(2,5-dioctyloxy)-phenyleneethynylene-2,5-thiophenylenevinylene-1,4-[(5-(2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-2-methyloxy]-phenylenevinylene} (DO-PThE1-PPV2) (D1) and poly{1,4-(5-[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]-2-methoxy)-phenyleneethynylene-2,5-thiophenylenevinylene-1,4-[(5-(2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-2-methyloxy]-phenylenevinylene} (MEH-PThE1-PPV2) (D2).25 Their chemical structures are displayed in Fig. 1. Systematic variation of the nature (linear or branched), density, length and position of alkoxy side chains has been used to tune the supramolecular ordering, the photophysical, photoconductive, electrochemical, electroluminescent and photovoltaic properties of PPE-PPV based materials.26–28 For instance, the lower side chain volume fraction in D2 than in D1 leads to higher miscibility between D2 and PC60BM (1:3 ratio) than between D1 and PC60BM. This, on one hand, increases the donor–acceptor interfacial area, resulting in higher density of photogenerated charges, and on the other hand, fosters the recombination of the photogenerated charges at the same time hampers the percolation paths to the electrodes, which lower both the expected JSC and the FF.25 The mixing of D1, D2 and PC60BM in a ternary system as described in this work resulted in a different active layer nanomorphology than in the individual D1:PC60BM or D2:PC60BM binary system. Thus higher photovoltaic performance was obtained from the ternary blend system than from the individual binary systems.

Experimental part
The charge carrier transport and recombination strongly influence the photovoltaic performance of solar cells.29 Since semiconducting organic polymers are low mobility materials with low quantum photogeneration efficiency in their pristine phase,30 bulk heterojunction concept is introduced for an efficient charge generation and for a long carrier lifetime.31 Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique is usually used to measure the charge carrier mobility in the bulk of the film,32 however, in disordered films with dispersive transport TOF is not well applicable. We have measured the charge carrier mobility of the two polymers and their 1:1 mixture using Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage (CELIV) technique. This technique has been used to study the charge carrier transport and recombination in various disordered organic and inorganic semiconductors in the past.17a,28a,33CELIV allows us to study the time-dependent, dispersive charge carrier transport in disordered semiconductors where the carrier mobility is measured directly from the current transients without any assumptions or fitting procedures. The essence of this method is the charge carrier extraction with linearly increasing (triangle-shaped) voltage pulse. If the studied semiconductor is intrinsically pure (undoped) and contains no significant amount of mobile charge carriers, the light pulse is used to photogenerate the charge carriers which are further extracted from the film by increasing voltage. The time-dependent relaxation of photogenerated charge carriers within Density-of-States distribution in disordered media is studied.34CELIV measures a non-equilibrium charge carrier mobility as opposed to steady state mobility techniques such as space charge limited current (SCLC) or field effect transistor (OFET) measurements.35 Also, Poole–Frenkel type dependence of carrier mobility on electric field is usually seen in disordered films.36 Therefore, the charge carrier mobility is non-constant as a function of electric field and the electric field values, at which the carrier mobility is measured, must be specified.37 The synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical characterizations of D1 and D2 are reported elsewhere.25
For CELIV measurements, sandwich-type samples were fabricated as follows: polymers were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1. The solutions were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter before deposition by drop casting on top of the pre-patterned ITO-covered glass substrates. Bulk charge carrier mobility was measured in thick (>1 µm) films. 30 nm aluminium top electrodes with typical dimensions of 8–10 mm2 were evaporated on top of the film in vacuum under 10−6 mbar. The samples were prepared in air, but after the deposition of top contact films were kept in the nitrogen atmosphere and measured in the cryostat (Oxford Optistat DNV) under vacuum. A variable pulse generator (Agilent 33250A) and the oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 754C) were used to record the extraction current transients. To control the delay time between voltage and light pulses, an arbitrary pulse (Agilent AG33250A) and a delay function generator (Stanford DG535) were employed. A Nd:YAG laser (Coherent Infinity 40–100), with a light pulse width of 5 ns, wavelength 355 nm, energy of less than 1 mJ per pulse, was used for the charge carriers photogeneration.
For photophysical measurements, the pure polymers (D1, D2), their 1:1 mixture films and their corresponding blend films with PC60BM in a 1:3 ratio were prepared from their solution (10 mg polymer) per ml in chlorobenzene by spin coating on glass. After the films were allowed to dry in the glove box for 24 h, optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements were carried out using a Cary (3 G) UV-Vis spectrophotometer and HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. For the fabrication of bulk heterojunction solar cells, solutions were prepared according to the previous literature25a,c with mixing ratio of 1:3 polymer to the acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) in chlorobenzene (99%) (ACROS ORGANICS) with a concentration of 40 mg (polymer:PC60BM) per ml stirred overnight. The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate was cleaned by ultrasonication successively with glass cleaning detergent helmanex, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water and dried by purging with N2. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) (Baytron PH) stirred overnight and filtered was spin coated from aqueous solution on top of ITO with 2000 rpm to get a film of 80 nm thickness and dried overnight in open air. The polymer:PCBM solutions were then filtered and spin coated on top of PEDOT/PSS film. Then the samples were kept in the glove box dried for 24 h and the top electrode aluminium metal (100 nm) deposition was done by thermal evaporation in vacuum at about 5 × 10−6 bar. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 236 source measure unit under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 white light illumination of the solar cell. Incident photon to collected electron efficiency (IPCE) measurements were taken using a optical fiber from 90 W Xenon lamp light source, which is connected to ACTON Spectra Pro150 monochromator and EG & G 7260 DSP Lock in a amplifier to measure the current.
Results and discussion
From thin film absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of D1, D2 and their 1:1 blends in Fig. 2, it can be seen that all three entities exhibit almost the same optical features, which is consistent with the previous reports.25 The absorption contribution of PCBM in the binary and ternary blends is viewed by the strong absorption band in the range of 325–390 nm and a kink at 710 nm. It is possible to correlate the intensity of the absorption bands with the volume fraction of the alkoxy side chains, latter acting as diluting agents of the photoactive species. The concentration of the photoactive species increases from D1:PCBM blend over D1:D2:PCBM blend to D2:PCBM. The highest photoexcited interaction is the blends of D2 with PCBM (i.e. highest miscibility) resulting in the highest photoluminescence quenching in D2:PCBM blend, followed by D1:D2:PCBM blend, then D1:PCBM blend as shown in Fig. 2b.

The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells are given in Fig. 3. Statistical studies were also made in order to ensure the reproducibility of results and the characteristic average values of these solar cells made are shown in Table 1. The I–V characteristics of the solar cells in Fig. 3 reveal a dark rectification ratio of approximately 103 at ±2 V. The solar cells made from D2:PCBM (1:3) showed an average open circuit voltage (VOC) value of 735 mV and that of D1:PCBM (1:3) showed 842 mV. The average VOC of the ternary blend of 860 mV in contrast is higher than that of the respective binary systems. It is reported that VOC is a function of the HOMO of the polymer and that of the LUMO of the acceptor,1b,9 so this result shows that by mixing two polymers of the same backbone but with different side chain volume fraction, the open circuit voltage can be improved.38 When we compare the solar cells made from the individual polymers with PCBM, D2:PCBM showed an average short circuit current density (JSC) of 4.9 mA cm−2 which is higher than that of D1:PCBM which showed an average 4.5 mA cm−2. This trend is consistent with the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the blends where D2:PCBM showed the strongest PL quenching due to more efficient photo-induced electron transfer to the acceptor PCBM as compared to D1:PCBM. The highest average JSC of 5.7 mA cm−2 obtained for the ternary blend is due to its better active layer nanomorphology than the binary blends. The fill factor FF values observed for the ternary blend (40%) are very close to the highest average value of 41% obtained for D1:PCBM binary system.

As can be seen from the incident photon to collected electron efficiency (IPCE) curves in the Fig. 4, the IPCE for the ternary blend is the highest (52% at its maximum) and covers the largest area as compared to the binary blends. At their maximum point D1:PC60BM and D2:PC60BM showed IPCE values of 40% and 41% respectively. Even though the optical absorption of the two polymers are almost the same a difference in the position of the onsets of the IPCE curves is observed. D2:PC60BM blend absorbs strongly at longer wavelengths compared to D1:PC60BM blend. The IPCE onset of the ternary blend starts at the longest wavelength as compared to the binary blends. The difference in the IPCE values between the binary blends and the ternary blend is consistent with their difference in short circuit current values. This clearly shows that by mixing the two polymers a new nanomorphology with improved properties is obtained.

The AFM images in Fig. 5 show the nanomorphological differences between the two polymer films D1 and D2 and their 1:1 mixture from their (1%) solution in chlorobenzene spin coated on glass. D1 has a higher roughness around 0.8 nm than that of D2 which is 0.3 nm, whereas their 1:1 mixture shows an intermediate roughness of 0.4 nm. The same trend was observed in their average height where an average value of 2.6 nm was obtained for D1, 1.2 nm for D2 and 1.6 nm for the mixture. As expected, a clear phase separation is observed from AFM picture of D1:PCBM blend with a roughness of 4.0 nm and an average height of 10.7 nm, the blend D2:PCBM showed a very flat film with a roughness of 0.3 nm and an average height of 1.4 nm due to higher miscibility between D2 and PCBM. The ternary blend thin film has a roughness 0.5 nm and a height of 2.1 nm which is still flat as compared to D1:PCBM but relatively rough as compared to D2:PCBM. The increase in JSC and concomitant overall performance of the ternary blend are proposed to be due to optimized phase separation of the ternary blend as compared to the two binary blends, i.e. highest phase separation in D1:PCBM blend and the highest miscibility in D2:PCBM blend.

In Fig. 6 the current extraction transients from CELIV experiment for D1 and D2 and their 1:1 blend are shown. A typical CELIV current transient response presents several important features. The very initial current step j(0) (displacement current) is caused by the geometrical capacity of the sample and it is used to estimate the sample thickness. The following increasing extraction current is caused by the photoconductivity of the sample when the mobile charge carriers are being extracted from the film. As the triangle voltage pulse continues to increase, the majority of charge carriers reach the electrode and the current starts to decrease forming a characteristic extraction maximum from which the carrier mobility (µ) is calculated.38  where k = 2/3 for volume (for thin films) and K = 2 for surface photogeneration (for thick films), d is the film thickness, A is the slope of applied rising triangle-shaped voltage pulse. Since the applied electric field in the film is non-constant during the extraction, the electric field at which the carrier mobility is calculated is E = A × tmax/d. The charge carriers are photogenerated with laser pulse of 355 nm since films are undoped with negligible amount of thermally generated charge carriers.

extraction current transients are shown for D1 (a), D2 (b) and their 1:1 blend (c). Vertical bar marks the extraction maximum from which carrier mobility is calculated. 
Usually the mobility of fast charge carriers is measured in the blends using time-resolved methods since it dominates the transient photocurrent. However, the photovoltaic performance of solar cells is limited by the slower carrier mobility which is the hole transport in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. We have intentionally measured the carrier mobility in pristine polymers and their 1:1 mixture but not in their blends with PCBM in order to find the relation between the carrier mobility and photovoltaic performances. Typical photo-CELIV extraction transients with initial capacitive current step and further extraction maximum are seen in both polymers (D1, D2) and their 1:1 mixture. From the extraction maximum the unequilibrated mobility of photogenerated charge carriers is calculated. Hole mobility in D1 is µ = 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1 (at electric field ≈ 18000 V cm−1), in D2µ = 2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 (at electric field ≈ 9400 V cm−1) and in a 1:1 blend ratio µ = 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 (at electric field ≈ 9600 V cm−1). This CELIV result shows that when the two polymers are mixed they form a new intermolecular arrangement which is favorable to higher charge carrier mobility as compared to the individual polymers. This correlates well with the better photovoltaic performance of the ternary blend as compared to the individual binary blends.
In general, charge carrier transport is determined by the relation between material's chemical structure and film morphology. Surface roughness of polymer films shown in Fig. 5 indicates very little difference. However, the delicate differences in film structure and level of disorder might not be visible from AFM studies of film surface. In the past it has been observed that in contrast to polythiophenes, PPE-PPV structures demonstrate higher charge carrier mobility in the films with less degree of chain stacking.27a Similarly, mixing of two polymers might disturb the chain stacking (since the polymer phase separate when mixed) and results in higher carrier mobilities. Another possible explanation for improved carrier mobility in the blends could be the change in film conductivity or polarizability, for which further studies are required.
Conclusion
Blending of two thiophene-based PPE-PPV polymers having identical conjugated backbone decorated with different volume fraction of hydrophobic alkoxy side chains has led to enhanced charge carrier mobility and improved photovoltaic performance. This is proposed to be due to favourable intermolecular arrangement as revealed by AFM images.
