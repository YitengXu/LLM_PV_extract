    , Accepted 20th September 2011First published on 31st October 2011AbstractA composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, containing poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN–NPs), was deposited on a Ti foil by a doctor blade technique. Various weight percentages of TiN–NPs (5, 10, 20, 30 wt%) were used to prepare different composite films. This Ti foil with the composite film was used as the flexible counter-electrode (CE) for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Performances of the DSSCs with the platinum-free CEs containing PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs with various contents of TiN–NPs were investigated. After the optimization of composition and thickness of the composite film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 6.67% was achieved for the pertinent DSSC, using our synthesized CYC-B1 dye, which was found to be higher than that of a cell with a sputtered-Pt film on its CE (6.57%). The homogeneous nature of the composite film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, the uniform distribution of TiN–NPs in its polymer matrix, and the large electrochemical surface area of the composite film are seen to be the factors for the best performance of the pertinent DSSC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to characterize the films. The high efficiency of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs is explained by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves.
Introduction
Flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are handy, convenient for transportation and can be used in complex environments.1–3 Cost-effective production of DSSCs can be achieved by using a roll-to-roll printing process for the fabrication of their electrodes; this is possible with flexible DSSCs. Research work is focused on the development of flexible DSSCs based on nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes.4–6 Among various substrates, metal foil is one of the promising substrates for fabricating flexible DSSCs,7–13 because a large range of annealing temperatures can be used in preparing their electrodes. With regard to DSSCs, the challenging issue is not only to achieve high light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) but also to manufacture them easily with least cost.14
A sputtered-platinum (s-Pt) conducting glass is usually employed as the counter-electrode (CE) for a DSSC. However, platinum (Pt) is very expensive and is rare on earth. Fabrication of CEs with other cheaper materials is expected to bring down the production cost of the cells, especially when it is a matter of large-scale production. Yohannes and Inganäs have reported that electrochemically polymerized and doped poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) can catalyze the reactions of the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple in a DSSC.15 Furthermore, catalytic activities of conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy)16–18 and polyaniline (PANI),19–21 have been studied recently. These reports have established that conducting polymers have high electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic ability for I−/I3−redox reactions.22 In addition, carbonaceous electrodes with activated carbon,23carbon nanotube,24 hard carbon spherule,25 and acetylene-black spheres26 were also used in the replacement of Pt CE's for DSSCs.

        Titanium nitride (TiN) is a conducting ceramic material and has different applications, e.g., for surface modification of stainless steel,27 in PH sensors,28fuel cells,29–33 and supercapacitors.34 Yoo et al. have reported that a thin film of TiN can be used as a novel charge collector in a TCO-free DSSC;35 this may be attributed to its good electronic conductivity.36 In our previous works, we have used TiN nanoparticles (TiN–NPs) for a low-temperature process37 and in a gel electrolyte38 for a DSSC. Recently, TiN nanoparticles were reported to have a high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− ions;39,40 this activity was attributed to the fact that metal nitrides and noble metals have similar electronic structures;41 Jiang and co-workers have fabricated a DSSC with a CE with highly ordered TiN nanotube arrays and this cell showed an efficiency of 7.76%, which is comparable to that of a cell with a typical Pt CE (η = 7.45%).40 Li et al. have fabricated a DSSC with a CE, containing a film of bare TiN–NPs;39 this cell however showed a very low fill factor (FF) because of the particle nature of TiN.42
In this study, we employed poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a linker for the TiN–NPs, intending to improve the electrical connection among these particles. We have also previously reported that a DSSC with a carbon black-modified PEDOT:PSS CE showed a higher efficiency (5.82%) than that of a cell with Pt CE (5.66%).43 Bourdo and Viswanathan have reported that a film of PANI/graphite shows a higher conductivity than the same film without graphite; they proposed that this conductivity is due to the formation of a highly conductive matrix by the polymer around the graphite.44 In this work, we have prepared a PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite film by anchoring TiN–NPs into the matrix of PEDOT:PSS. The images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were obtained for TiN–NPs, PEDOT:PSS, and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs with various contents of TiN–NPs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were used to substantiate the results. This is the first report on the use of a CE with a composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs for a DSSC. In almost all such previous works, PEDOT:PSS was used as the main film with minor contents of other materials, such as carbon black43 or graphene.45 In almost all the previous works, the DSSCs with CEs containing a film of pristine TiN–NPs showed a very poor FF, owing to the poor interconnections among the particles of pristine TiN–NPs. In order to avoid this problem, we have used the polymer combination, PEDOT:PSS as a matrix for the pristine TiN–NPs, and thereby achieved much higher FF and η than those, usually obtained in the case of pristine TiN–NPs. In the present work, TiN–NP is the major material and PEDOT:PSS is the minor material. Moreover, PEDOT:PSS in the composite can not only act as a catalyst but also as a linker to connect the TiN–NPs. Hence, the performance of the DSSC with the composite of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs has dramatically improved, compared to that with pristine TiN–NPs. Unlike the usual way of depositing a Pt film on a CE substrate for a DSSC, by dip coating and sputtering processes, which involve respectively a thermal treatment and a high-vacuum condition, we, in this work, have deposited the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs film on the CE substrate by a low temperature and non-vacuum process; this process is compatible not only for metallic but also for plastic substrates.
Experimental section
Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) aqueous solution (PEDOT:PSS, PH 500, 1.0–1.4 wt% dispersion in water) was obtained from Heraeus. Titanium nitride nanoparticle (TiN–NP, particle size ∼50 nm) was obtained from Wako. Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetical grade), iodine (I2, synthetical grade) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 20000) were obtained from Merck. Acetone (99+%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were obtained from Acros. Titanium(IV) tetraisoproproxide (TTIP, >98%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.5%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, ≥98.0%), and 2-methoxyethanol (≥99.5%) were obtained from Aldrich. Nitric acid (HNO3, ca. 65% solution in water) was obtained from J. T. Baker. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was obtained from Fluka. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) was obtained from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Ruthenium photosensitizer, namely, CYC-B1, was synthesized by us, as reported in our previous work.46Scheme 1 shows the structure of the synthesized CYC-B1.

        TiO2 paste and the photoanode were prepared, as reported previously.47–49 For this, 72 mL of TTIP was added to 430 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 with constant stirring, and the contents were heated to 88 °C for 8 h; the mixture was cooled down to the room temperature, and the resultant colloid was filtered and heated in an autoclave at 240 °C for 12 h. The TiO2 colloid was concentrated to 13 wt%, and PEG (30 wt% with respect to TiO2) was added to the colloid to prevent the film from cracking during drying.
 Scheme 1  The structure of CYC-B1. 
The sputtered-platinum (s-Pt) counter-electrode (CE) was prepared by sputtering for 50 nm of Pt on the Ti foil. The PEDOT:PSS electrode (with a thickness of around 4 μm) was prepared by drop coating. Different weight percentages of TiN–NPs were used in the PEDOT:PSS solution (5, 10, 20, 30 wt% with respect to PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution) for preparing the corresponding PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite films; a doctor-blade technique was used to coat the films on the Ti foils at 60 °C. The main reason for using Ti foil as the substrate is its inherent flexible property, suitable for a flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). High electric conductivity and relative stability of Ti foil are also chief considerations for its use as the substrate of the counter-electrode in a DSSC. These films deposited on Ti foils were designated as PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-5%, PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-10%, PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-30%, based on the weight percentages of TiN–NPs, and were used as CEs for DSSCs. The particle size and distribution of TiN–NPs were estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1230, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Surface morphologies of PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite films with different contents of TiN–NPs were observed by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA). The compositions of composite films with different contents of TiN in PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs were verified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, the distribution of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite film was also verified by elemental mapping. The topography and surface roughness of various films were also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SEIKO E-sweep System, SII Nanotechnology Inc., Chiba, Japan), with a scanning probe microscope in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) patterns were obtained to investigate the crystallinity of various PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite films. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs. CV was carried out with a three-electrode electrochemical system, by using an electrode of s-Pt, or PEDOT:PSS, or PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter-electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode in an ACN solution, containing 10 mM I−, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4.
A fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, TEC-7, ∼10 Ω sq−1, NSG America Inc., New Jersey, USA) conducting glass and a Ti foil (0.40 mm, Fuu Cherng Co. Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan) were first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio of 1:3) for obtaining a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and the TiO2 film. A 15 μm-thick mesoscopic TiO2 film was coated on the treated FTO glass by the doctor blade technique; the composed film consisted of a first layer of 10 μm-thick transparent TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm) and a second 5 μm-thick scattering layer, in which the scattering layer was made up with 100 nm (PT-501A, Ya Chung Industrial Co. Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan) and 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (weight ratio of 1:1). A portion of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 was selected from the composite film as the active area by removing the side portions by scrapping. The TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C (rate = 10 °C min−1) in an oxygen atmosphere and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M CYC-B1 dye solution with a mixed solvent of ACN/tBA/DMSO (volume ratio of 45/45/10) at room temperature for 24 h. Such a prepared TiO2 electrode was coupled with a prepared CE; these two electrodes were separated by a 25 μm-thick Surlyn® (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) and sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio = 1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the two electrodes by capillarity, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the electrolyte injection.
The assembled device was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM 1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). Photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC, between the CE and the FTO/TiO2/dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed by an equivalent circuit model.50,51 Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at short-circuit condition. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan); light was focused through a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ), which is defined as IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/λφ)(1)where JSC is short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2). We measured φ with an optical detector (model 71580, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) and a power meter (model 70310, Oriel Instrument, California, USA).
Results and discussion
The particle-size distribution of the TiN–NPs was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. S1†, and the sizes of TiN–NPs were found to be between 10 and 50 nm. Though the manufacturer has specified the average particle size of TiN to be ∼50 nm, the size distribution is still unknown. TEM (Fig. S1†) has shown a wide particle size distribution for TiN–NPs.
On the other hand, the average grain size of the TiN–NPs was calculated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a) by employing the Scherrer equation.52 The calculated grain size of about 31.54 nm is fairly consistent with the particle diameter estimated from the TEM image. In order to investigate the composition of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite films, XRD analysis was performed. Fig. 1a represents the XRD patterns of the films with TiN–NPs, PEDOT:PSS, and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, with different weight ratios of TiN–NPs in the last case. There is no characteristic peak for the bare PEDOT:PSS film owing to its poor crystallinity. Characteristic peaks of a face centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure of TiN corresponding to the planes (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) were found at 2θ of ca. 36.4°, 42.2°, 61.2°, 73.3°, and 77.2°, respectively for the bare TiN–NPs film and also for the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite films.53 With the increases of TiN–NPs, the peaks increase as well, indicating the additional contents of TiN–NPs in the polymer matrices of PEDOT:PSS, in accord with the addition. This result was further verified by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for different contents of TiN–NPs in the composite films of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs. Fig. 1b reveals that the N-atomic ratio is proportional to the content of TiN–NPs in the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite film. The results indicate that the composition of a film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs is tunable. To be applicable in various conditions, the endurance of bending is critical for a flexible counter-electrode (CE). Fig. S2† exhibits a flexible CE with the composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% on a Ti foil, under bending condition. The CE is exfoliation-free, and its Ti foil is well adhered to the crack-free film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs. The image indicates that the TiN–NPs formed a uniform film with the polymer matrix. The excellent flexibility of the CE with the composite film is thus vindicated.

Hence, in this study, the maximum weight percentage of TiN–NPs in the composite film was set at 30 wt% to avoid any cracks in the prepared film. Furthermore, in order to observe the distribution of TiN–NPs in a composite film, elemental mapping was performed with EDX, which is an effective tool for the analysis of elemental distribution (Fig. 3).54Fig. 3a shows a low-magnification SEM image of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite film with 20 wt% of TiN–NPs, while Fig. 3b and c show the corresponding elemental maps of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. These maps indicate that the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite film is homogeneous; it is also clear that the TiN–NPs are dispersed uniformly in the PEDOT:PSS matrix. The uniformly distributed TiN–NPs could facilitate electron transfer in the composite film. The surface roughnesses of PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite films, with various contents of TiN–NPs, were specifically measured by a high-resolution tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The bare PEDOT:PSS film in Fig. 4a shows smooth flat, rather in continuous stretches; the film is not compact with the polymer. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film was estimated to be 3 nm. Fig. 4b–d show AFM images of the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite films with various contents of TiN–NPs. We have observed that the RMS roughness value of the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite film increases with increasing content of TiN–NPs; an RMS roughness value of 134 nm was estimated in the case of the film with 30 wt% TiN–NPs. This implies that the RMS roughness of the composite film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs depends strongly on the content of TiN–NPs. The composite films with the anchored TiN–NPs thus have larger electrochemical surface areas than that of the PEDOT:PSS film.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with the film of TiN–NPs and with the composite films of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, with different weight percentages of TiN–NPs in the composite films, were measured under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves and Table 1 shows the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. It can be seen from Table 1 that the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the DSSC with bare TiN–NPs–CE are 0.71 V, 0.18, and 1.09 mA cm−2, respectively, which yielded an overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 0.13%. Although TiN–NPs possess good electrocatalytic ability to reduce the triiodide (I3−) ions in the electrolyte,40 the cell performance with bare TiN–NPs–CE is still poor. The weak linkage among TiN–NPs, in the absence of a matrix, may reduce the pathways for electron transfer through the TiN–NPs film (as shown in Scheme 2a);42 this essentially could be the reason for the worst performance of the cell with the TiN–NPs film. In contrast, the overall power conversion efficiencies are incomparably superior in the case of the cells with the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite films; this superior performance of the cells with composite films is obviously owing to the multi-fold pathways for the electron transport in the composite film because of the continued interconnections among the TiN–NPs in the PEDOT:PSS conductive matrix (Scheme 2b). In the case of composite films of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, the η increases from 4.72 to 6.00% with the increase in the content of TiN–NPs from 5 wt% to 20 wt% (Table 1); this increase is essentially due to considerable increases in the JSC and FF with the increase in the content of TiN–NPs. Increase in pathways in the composite film for electron transfer with increase in the content of TiN–NPs is apparently the reason for corresponding increases in FF and JSC of the DSSCs with composite films. However, the η of the cell with the composite film shows a decreasing tendency with further increases in the content of TiN–NPs; this is probably due to increased compactness and decreased porosity of the film with excessive content of TiN–NPs, which is not favorable for the penetration of electrolyte. Hence, the thickness of the composite film was optimized with the same content of TiN–NPs, i.e., with 20 wt% of TiN–NPs. Fig. 5b shows the behaviors of η and JSC as functions of the thickness of the composite film with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%. As the thickness increases from 3.6 to 7.2 μm, the JSC increases from 12.79 to 14.13 mA cm−2. A thicker composite film is expected to have a higher electrochemical surface area, which favors better reduction of I3− ions and thereby an increase in the corresponding JSC. When we increased the thickness of the composite film beyond 7.2 μm, we observed cracks on its surface. Therefore, we fixed the thickness of the composite film to be 7.2 μm and its content of TiN–NPs to be 20 wt% for further experiments.

 Scheme 2  (a) Electron transfer pathways in a film of TiN–NPs and (b) electron transfer pathways in a composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs. 

Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CEs with the films of TiN–NPs, PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, and sputtered-platinum (s-Pt), and Table 2 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. It can be seen from Table 2 that the η of the DSSC with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% (η = 6.67%) is higher than those of the cells with bare TiN–NPs (η = 0.17%) and bare PEDOT:PSS (η = 4.02%), and even higher than that of the cell with s-Pt (η = 6.57%). The DSSC with the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% shows the best η value of 6.67%, with the VOC, the FF, and the JSC being 0.68 V, 0.69, and 14.20 mA cm−2, respectively. The reason for very poor performance of the cell with bare TiN–NPs was already discussed. The DSSC with the composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% shows a higher JSC (14.20 mA cm−2) than that of the cell with bare PEDOT:PSS film (11.87 mA cm−2). The homogeneous nature of the composite film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs, the uniform distribution of TiN–NPs in its polymer matrix, and the larger electrochemical surface area of the composite film, with reference to these properties of the film with PEDOT:PSS (see Fig. 2–4), are the reasons for the better JSC of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs than that of the cell with PEDOT:PSS. Larger electrochemical surface area of the film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% implies the availability of a greater number of catalytic sites; the greater number of catalytic sites are due to the small size and uniform spreading of the TiN–NPs. Meanwhile, TiN–NPs in the composite matrix can act as extended electron transfer material (EETM), which can also facilitate electron transfer from the CE to the I3− ions in the electrolyte.55–57 The TiN–NPs thus play a vital role not only in constructing a porous film to enlarge the electrochemical surface area of the composite film, but also in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE by its intrinsic property. The mentioned higher electrocatalytic activity at the CE with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% implies faster reduction of I3− ions at it, which enables reduced availability of I3− ions for recombination with photoinjected electrons and thereby an increased VOC for the pertinent DSSC (0.69 V) than that of the cell with PEDOT:PSS (0.59 V, Table 2). The faster reduction of I3− ions at the CE of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% is expected to lead to a faster movement of the redox couple in the electrolyte of the cell, which in turn can lead to faster electron transfer kinetics in the cell and to a higher FF to the cell (0.69) compared to that of the cell with PEDOT:PSS (0.59).

To understand the reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic activities of various CEs, such as s-Pt, PEDOT:PSS, and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% CEs, for I−/I3−redox reaction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to do the further investigation. In a DSSC, photo-excited electrons from the dye are injected into the conducting band of TiO2. The oxidized dye is reduced back by I− ions in the electrolyte, and the produced I3− ions are then reduced at the CE; the redox reactions both at the photoanode and at the CE can be represented by eqn (2) and (3), respectively:58 3I− → I3− + 2e−(2) I3− + 2e− → 3I−(3)
The PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP-20% electrode shows higher redox current densities than those of the PEDOT:PSS and s-Pt electrodes; the anodic (Jpa) and cathodic (Jpc) peak current densities are 2.83 mA cm−2 and 2.08 mA cm−2, respectively in the case of the electrode with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%. A lower Jpa of 1.63 mA cm−2 and Jpa of 2.36 mA cm−2 are observed for the CEs with PEDOT:PSS and s-Pt, respectively. Higher electrocatalytic activity of the electrode with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% could be attributed not only to the inherent superior properties of TiN–NPs for electrical conductivity and catalytic ability, but also to the high electrochemical surface area of the composite film owing to its high surface roughness and porous morphology. Based on these voltammograms, it can be very well said that the catalytic ability of the CE with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% is higher than that of the CE with s-Pt; this higher catalytic ability of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% is reflected in terms of its higher VOC and higher FF, compared to those of the cell with s-Pt. Moreover, even bare PEDOT:PSS is capable of catalyzing the reduction of the I3− ions in a DSSC.43 Thus, PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs is one of the potential materials for the CE of a low-cost, platinum-free, and high efficient DSSC. Furthermore, Fig. 7b shows the behaviors of Jpa and Jpc of the cyclic voltammogram of the electrode with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% for 500 cycles. The Jpa and Jpc have not changed significantly, indicating that the redox activity of the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NP composite film is reversible even after 500 cycles of redox reactions. The long term stability and strong adhesiveness of the composite film on the substrate are also vindicated.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study the charge transfer resistances in the DSSCs. The EIS spectra of the DSSCs with TiN–NPs, PEDOT:PSS, PEDPT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, and s-Pt, measured at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, are shown in Fig. 8. The equivalent circuit is shown in its inset. Basically, the EIS of a DSSC shows three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The first and second semicircles correspond to the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte (Rct1) and at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2), respectively, and the third corresponds to the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (ZW). The values of Rct1 (Table 2) are 11.10 Ω and 4.38 Ω for the DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, respectively. This implies that the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20% is much smaller than that at the CE/electrolyte interface of the cell with PEDOT:PSS; in other words, the electrocatalytic activity for I3−reduction in the former case is much better than that in the latter case. Moreover, the increased FF (0.69) in the case of the cell with PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, compared to that of the cell with PEDOT:PSS (0.59), is consistent with their corresponding charge transfer resistances (Table 2).

Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) is defined as the number of electrons in the external circuit produced at a given wavelength divided by the number of incident photons.59Fig. 9 presents the IPCE of the DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS, PEDPT:PSS/TiN–NPs-20%, and s-Pt. The broad IPCE curves, covering almost the entire visible spectrum from 400 to 800 nm, exhibit at 530 nm a maximum IPCE value of about 80% for the cell with PEDOT:PDD/TiN–NPs-20%, and about 50% for the cell with PEDOT:PSS; moreover, the DSSC with the composite film shows a similar spectrum to that of the cell with s-Pt. These values of IPCE are consistent with the corresponding values of JSC (Table 2).

Finally, the PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs composite is established to be one of the potential materials on the CE for a low-cost, platinum-free, and highly efficient DSSC. The composite electrode can be fabricated at room temperature, which makes it compatible not only for metallic but also for plastic substrates.
Conclusions
A flexible CE with a composite film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs was prepared for DSSCs by using the doctor blade method. The composite film is homogeneous, with uniform distribution of TiN–NPs in its polymer matrix (SEM). The formation of the composite film was verified by XRD and EDX. The CE with the composite film is exfoliation-free, and its Ti foil is well adhered with the crack-free film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs. The RMS roughness of the composite film PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs depends strongly on the content of TiN–NPs. A film thickness of 7.2 μm and a TiN–NPs content of 20 wt% were optimized for the best performance of the DSSC with the composite film. The DSSC with the optimized film of PEDOT:PSS/TiN–NPs shows a high energy conversion efficiency of 6.67%, which is even slightly higher than that of the cell with a CE with s-Pt (6.57%). The highest catalytic activity, least charge transfer resistance at the interface of the CE and the electrolyte, and the highest IPCE value of about 80% are consistent with the best performance of the cell with the composite film.
