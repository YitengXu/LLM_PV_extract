    , Accepted 21st January 2020First published on 23rd January 2020AbstractWhile excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSC) have been demonstrated, the storage stability of all-PSCs has rarely been studied. In this paper, the storage stability of all-PSCs is systematically investigated and compared to fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PCBM-PSCs). We identify that the efficient inverted type all-PSCs made with a molybdenum oxide (MoO3) anode interfacial layer exhibit degradation over short periods of storage even under inert nitrogen-filled and dark conditions, while the control inverted PCBM-PSCs containing the same polymer donor are relatively more stable. To elucidate the origin of the poor storage stability, morphological and electrical properties of all-PSCs are investigated. We reveal that the work function of MoO3 is largely changed during the storage because of the interaction between MoO3 and the underneath naphthalene dimide (NDI)-based polymer acceptors (PAs). This causes unfavorable energy-level alignment in devices, resulting in increased charge recombination and deteriorated charge collecting efficiency. To resolve this issue, we propose two effective strategies: (i) introducing a passivation layer to physically separate the NDI-based PAs and MoO3, and (ii) replacing MoO3 with an efficient polymer interlayer. We prove that the modified all-PSCs not only exhibit excellent storage stability with high power conversion efficiency for more than 45 days, but also show high air-stability even without encapsulation. Our findings provide deeper understanding of the storage stability of all-PSCs and suggest future guidelines for efficient and burn-in free all-PSCs.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), composed of a polymer donor (PD) and a polymer acceptor (PA) in their photoactive layer, are a compelling class of polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to the molecular design flexibility in both PD and PA to optimize light absorption capability and energy-level alignment.1–4 In the last few years, scientists in the field have witnessed significant improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs from 2% up to 12%. This advance has been enabled by development of efficient benzodithiophene (BDT)-based PDs and naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based and/or planar fused ring-based PAs.5–17 Besides the efficiency perspective, all-PSCs have gained much attention due to their promising long-term stabilities that outdistance other PSCs, e.g. fullerene or non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor based polymer solar cells (PCBM- or NFSMA-PSCs).18–24 For example, all-PSCs exhibited almost no PCE decrease under high thermal stress over 80 °C attributed to much slower diffusion kinetics of polymers than those of small molecules, whereas other types of PSCs involving the same PDs but different small-molecule acceptors, i.e. phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) or 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), showed degradation in the PCE accompanied by severe phase separation.18–20 Importantly, the mechanical robustness and stretchability of all-PSCs have been shown to be superior to those of the small-molecule acceptor-based PSCs,22–26 highlighting the possibility of the practical implementation of all-PSCs into wearable and portable electronics.27,28
While the mechanical and thermal stabilities of the all-PSCs have been investigated, there is another important factor that has not been fully studied yet, that is, storage stability. For conventional PCBM-PSCs, abrupt loss of the initial PCE has been often observed at the onset of the device operation, which has been termed as a “burn-in” degradation. It has been revealed that the drop in efficiency can originate from different pathways including photochemical reactions in the active layers (e.g. oxidation of PDs or dimerization of fullerene acceptors) that create undesirable trap states,29,30 demixing of PDs and fullerene acceptors,31 formation of energetic disorders involved in amorphous polymer systems,32 impurities in active layers,33,34 and chemical interactions at the metal/organic interface.35,36 Recently, it has also been reported that some of the current state-of-the-art all-PSCs exhibit the burn-in degradation effect.6,19,37–41 For instance, Wang and co-workers observed a fast decay in the photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs in the initial stage, where the initial PCE decreased by 20% within 24 h and 53% within 96 h.37 It is important to note that this burn-in loss of all-PSCs occurred under the very mild conditions, i.e. nitrogen atmosphere at dark condition (referred to as storage stability or shelf lifetime). However, none of the works referred to above have addressed the burn-in phenomenon of the all-PSCs systematically. To establish design guidelines for developing burn-in free all-PSCs, fundamental and mechanistic studies on the burn-in degradation of all-PSCs are important and urgently needed.
Herein, we investigate the storage stability of various inverted type all-PSCs and develop an understanding on the mechanism of their burn-in degradation. To perform a systematic study, we construct a series of all-PSCs based on different PDs and NDI- or perylene diimide (PDI)-based PAs (Fig. 1). Also, PCBM-PSCs based on identical PDs are compared in order to gain an insight into the burn-in degradation of all-PSCs. We employ inverted all-PSCs containing molybdenum oxide (MoO3) as a hole extraction layer because the inverted device architecture has been used extensively for fabricating high-performance all-PSCs.37,42–45 It is also well-documented that a PCBM-PSCs with an inverted device structure have superior air-stability than those with a normal structure.46,47 During the storage under dark and inert atmosphere, all-PSCs are found to exhibit significant performance loss over 50% within 24 h, while the PCBM-PSCs nearly retain their initial PCEs over the same period. We show that the burn-in degradation in all-PSCs is caused by the interaction of NDI-based PAs and MoO3. Due to the interaction between Moδ+ (MoO3) and Oδ− (imide group in PAs) at the defects of the evaporated MoO3 layer, significant reduction in the work function of MoO3 occurs from 5.30 to 4.52 eV, which in turn generates a non-ohmic contact impeding efficient hole transport from PDs to MoO3. From the lessons learned in this study, we provide two simple and versatile routes for improving the storage stability of all-PSCs, (i) insertion of a passivation layer to avoid physical contact between PA and MoO3 and (ii) the replacement of the MoO3 layer with an efficient polymer interlayer. Both approaches are highly effective in preserving the initial PCEs of all-PSCs over 1000 h in air even without any encapsulation.

Characterization
The Mns of polymers were measured by size exclusion chromatography equipped with a Waters 1515 isocratic HPLC pump, a temperature control module, and a Waters 2414 refractive index detector. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Dimension 3100 instrument in tapping mode) was used to characterize the surface morphology of all-PSCs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using a JEOL 2000FX operated at 300 kV. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurement for all-PSCs was performed at BL 11.0.1.2 in the Advanced Light Source in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The all-polymer active layers coated onto poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) were floated and transferred onto a 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm-thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.) before the RSoXS measurement. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements were performed at beamline 3C in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The GIXS samples were prepared onto Si wafers. The wavelength and incidence angle of X-rays were 1.1179 Å and 0.12° to allow complete penetration of X-rays into the polymer film. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using a UV photoelectron spectrometer (Sigma Probe) with He I (21.2 eV) radiation line from a discharge lamp to identify the work function of MoO3. The UPS samples were prepared by depositing MoO3 onto active layers/ITO substrates. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs were measured in ambient condition under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using Keithley 2400 SMU. Solar simulator (K201 LAB55, McScience) satisfied the Class AAA, ASTM Standards. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by using a standard silicon reference cell (K801S-K302, McScience).
Fabrication of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs
Both PCBM-PSCs and all-PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of indium tinoxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/MoO3/Ag or ITO/ZnO/active layer/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/MoO3/Ag. Normal type devices were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag. The ITO glass substrates were sequentially washed by using an ultrasonicator with acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min each and they were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 20 min. After plasma treatment on the cleaned ITO substrates, ZnO or PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Clevios™) films were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s and 3000 rpm for 40 s, respectively. The devices were then annealed at 200 °C and 150 °C, respectively for 20 min under ambient conditions. The ZnO solution was made by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (1 g) and ethanolamine (0.28 g) in anhydrous 2-methoxy ethanol (10 ml) and the solution was stirred for more than 24 h. Then, donor:acceptor (D:A) blend solutions were spin-coated onto the substrates in a nitrogen filled glovebox under each of the optimized spin-coating conditions as follows. For the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) system, the blend solution was prepared in chloroform containing 1.2 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive with a D:A ratio of 1.3:1 (w/w) and a total concentration of 12 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 3000 rpm for 40 s. The PBDTT-TPD:P(NDI2HD-T) blend solution was prepared in chloroform containing 1 vol% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1.3:1 and a total concentration of 13 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 3000 rpm for 40 s. The other all-PSCs shown in Fig. S1† were fabricated following very similar protocols. For PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2), the blend solution was prepared in chloroform containing 0.5 vol% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1.3:1 and a total concentration of 10 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 3000 rpm for 40 s. For PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-Se) and PTB7-Th:P(PDI2HD-T) systems, the blend solutions were prepared in chloroform containing 1 vol% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1.3:1 and a total concentration of 12 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 3000 rpm for 40 s. For PBDB-T:P(NDI2OD-T2), the blend solution was prepared in chlorobenzene with a D:A ratio of 1:1 and a total concentration of 12 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 2000 rpm for 30 s. For PPDT2FBT:P(NDI2OD-T2), the blend solution was prepared in chloroform containing 1 vol% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1:1 and a total concentration of 10 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 3000 rpm for 40 s. All of the blend solutions were stirred at 45 °C for 2 h before the spin-casting. For PCBM-PSCs, PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution was prepared in chlorobenzene containing 5% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1:1.5 and a total concentration of 25 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 2000 rpm for 40 s. The PBDTT-TPD:PC71BM solution was dissolved in chloroform containing 3% of DIO additive with a D:A ratio of 1:1.5 and a total concentration of 25 mg ml−1, and spin-coated with 2000 rpm for 40 s. The PCBM-PSC solutions were stirred at 90 °C for 2 h before the spin-casting. Finally, for inverted-type all-PSCs devices, MoO3 and Ag were sequentially deposited on blend films in an evaporation chamber under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) with thicknesses of approximately 10 nm and 120 nm, respectively. The effective active layer of the devices was 0.164 cm2. For normal-type all-PSCs devices, PNDIT-F3N-Br solution (1 mg ml−1 in methanol) was spin-coated on the active layer film at 2000 rpm for 60 s before depositing Ag. For a passivation PEDOT:PSS layer, PEDOT:PSS in water:isopropanol (1:6) solution was spin-coated on the active layer film at 2000 rpm for 60 s before depositing MoO3/Ag.
Fabrication of the inverted-type bilayer all-PSCs
PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T) were dissolved in chloroform with a concentration of 5 mg ml−1. The P(NDI2HD-T) solution was first spin-coated onto ZnO/ITO substrates with 3000 rpm for 40 s. The PTB7-Th solution was spin-coated onto the other substrate PEDOT:PSS/ITO with 3000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the PTB7-Th film was floated onto water and transferred onto P(NDI2HD-T)/ZnO/ITO substrates. Thereafter, MoO3 and Ag were sequentially deposited in an evaporation chamber under high vacuum with thicknesses of approximately 10 nm and 120 nm, respectively.
Results and discussion
Storage stability of inverted all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs

Fig. 1a illustrates the model all-PSC and PCBM-PSC systems and the experimental condition used in the storage lifetime study. Briefly, the inverted devices with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layers/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to yield high PCEs and their photovoltaic performances were recorded as a function of aging time in dark and nitrogen-filled glove box.37,42–45 We chose the inverted structure because the inverted PCBM-PSCs have superior air-stability than that with a normal structure.46,47 The representative polymer PTB7-Th was employed as a common PD and either P(NDI2HD-T) PA or PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor for fabricating all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs, respectively. In addition, other PD–PA pairs were tested in order to provide a deeper insight into the storage stability of all-PSCs (Fig. 1b). Detailed protocols for this stability study are provided in Experimental section.
First, the storage lifetime of PTB7-Th-based all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs was monitored (Fig. 2a and Table 1). It was found that all-PSCs underwent significant efficiency degradation. The PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs exhibited 54% of their initial PCE within only 24 h of storage time, i.e., the photovoltaic performance has decreased from 5.55% (Voc = 0.79 V, Jsc = 12.12 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58) to 3.03% (Voc = 0.77 V, Jsc = 7.72 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51). This degradation was mainly attributed to a decrease in Jsc and FF values. After 24 h of storage, the photovoltaic performances of the all-PSC devices remained nearly unchanged over 150 h. The PCBM-PSCs retained 93% of their initial performances (PCE = 8.12%, Voc = 0.79 V, Jsc = 15.34 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.67 initially, and PCE = 7.54%, Voc = 0.79 V, Jsc = 14.91 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.64 after 24 h). This different result in the PCBM-PSCs discloses the inferior storage stability of all-PSCs, but allows us to investigate its origin from the comparison between all- and PCBM-PSCs.

Importantly, it was observed that all-PSCs based on various pairs of PDs and PAs exhibit similar degradation behavior upon the device storage (Fig. S1†). First, widely-known efficient PAs, P(NDI2HD-T2)53 and P(NDI2HD-Se),54 were utilized to assess the storage stability while the PTB7-Th PD was maintained (Fig. S1a†). As observed in the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs, these two all-PSCs have also experienced a rapid efficiency drop within 24 h. In addition to the NDI-based PAs, a PDI-based PA, P(PDI2HD-T), was examined. It was seen that the PTB7-Th:P(PDI2HD-T) all-PSCs show the similar degradation behavior. In addition, we evaluated other all-PSCs involving different efficient PDs (Fig. S1b†), i.e., PBDTT-TPD,22 PPDT2FBT,55 and PBDB-T,56 in order to investigate whether the burn-in degradation of all-PSCs originates from the PTB7-Th PD or takes place only if NDI-based (or imide-based) PAs are paired with the PTB7-Th PD. We observed a similar tendency for a decrease in PCEs regardless of the PDs. The PCE loss ranged from 20% to 58% depending on the active materials used.
Origin of burn-in loss in inverted all-PSCs with the MoO3/Ag electrode
To reveal the underlying mechanism for the poor storage lifetime of all-PSCs, the morphological stability of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layers was firstly investigated. As morphological features such as the degree of phase separation and the polymer packing structure are strongly correlated with all-PSC performance, changes in these parameters with storage time were monitored. We measured AFM for the fresh and 24 h-aged PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs (Fig. S2†). From the AFM phase and height images, it was seen that both polymer blend films exhibit finely phase-separated surface morphology, showing similar root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of ∼1 nm. To complement this observation, we also measured TEM and RSoXS (Fig. S2†). By utilizing these tools, we can garner information on the lateral and internal morphology of all-PSCs.57,58 As can be seen in the TEM images, the blend morphologies of all-PSCs before and after storage remain similar without any significant phase separation. Also, the RSoXS profile of the aged all-PSC sample taken at 287 eV where the contrast between PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) is maximized did not show a discernible scattering peak, indicating that the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend did not undergo phase separation over the storage. GIXS experiment was performed to examine the change in molecular orientation and polymer packing structure of PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs (Fig. S3†).59 Both fresh and aged PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) films exhibited almost identical lamellar and π–π stacking distances; 22.4 Å and 3.96 Å for the fresh, and 22.4 Å and 3.95 Å for the aged, respectively. Overall, the difference in the phase separation behavior and the molecular orientation in fresh and aged all-PSCs was not observed, indicating that morphological properties are not the origin for the burn-in degradation. To support this conclusion, we prepared two different devices under the same condition, but the MoO3 and the Ag electrodes were deposited (1) immediately or (2) three days after fabrication of active layers. The two different all-PSCs exhibited the similar photovoltaic performance (Fig. S4†). Therefore, the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) active layers, including ITO and ZnO layers, are stable during the storage in dark and nitrogen-filled inert conditions.
From the information gained above, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the burn-in degradation of all-PSCs initiates when MoO3 or Ag electrode are deposited on to the all-polymer active layer. We consider two possible degradation routes that can occur after the MoO3 and Ag deposition: (i) diffusion of inorganic metal atoms into active layer, or (ii) interfacial instability led by interaction of the active layer and MoO3 at their interface. Regarding route (i), Huang and co-workers have discussed the possibility of the Ag diffusion into active layers in all-PSCs.6 However, we believe that the metal-diffusion degradation is unlikely the case in our system when considering that the PCBM-PSCs fabricated with the identical device configuration have high storage stability. Thus, we speculate that the burn-in degradation of all-PSCs should originate from route (ii) – the interfacial instability at the active layer-MoO3 interface. In particular, based on the above-described device results of PCBM-PSCs and various all-PSCs, NDI-based PAs may play a critical role in causing the interfacial instability due to the interaction with MoO3. To gain an insight into this hypothesis, we fabricated bilayer all-PSCs with a device configuration of ITO/ZnO/P(NDI2HD-T)/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag, in which the direct contact between the P(NDI2HD-T) PA and MoO3 is avoided (Fig. S5†). Interestingly, the bilayer all-PSCs exhibit burn-in free, very stable photovoltaic performance until 168 h. This result suggests that the burn-in degradation is ascribed to the P(NDI2HD-T) PA and its interaction with MoO3 at their interface.
The interaction between P(NDI2HD-T) PA and MoO3 at their interface may change the energy-level alignments, and thus can impact device performances. To verify this, UPS was performed. The MoO3 layer was deposited on top of the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) active layer and also on top of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer as a control sample. The work functions (WF) of the films were measured for fresh samples and aged samples kept in a glove box over 24 h (Fig. 3a and b). For all-PSC samples, we found that the WF value of MoO3 significantly decreased from 5.30 to 4.52 eV after aging (Fig. 3a), whereas, in PTB7-Th:PC71BM sample, the WF of MoO3 exhibited a smaller change from 5.37 to 5.13 eV (Fig. 3b). It has been reported that MoO3 films fabricated by thermal evaporation usually contain oxygen-vacancies (defects), which can significantly affect the WF of MoO3 and the photovoltaic performances of solar cells when oxygen molecules are adsorbed into MoO3 film.60–65 In all-PSCs, oxygen atoms in the imide group of NDI-based PAs may be adsorbed on Moδ+ with oxygen-vacancies at the active layer-MoO3 interface, which can decrease WF of MoO3. Based on the UPS measurements, the energy-level alignment of all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs is described in Fig. 3c and d. For all-PSCs, a largely decreased WF of MoO3 from 5.30 to 4.52 eV can produce a non-ohmic contact, as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy-level of PTB7-Th PD lies on −5.3 eV. As a result, the unfavorable energy-level alignment caused by the interaction between P(NDI2HD-T) and MoO3 can result in the burn-in degradation in all-PSCs via extensive charge recombination and poor hole-extraction. In contrast, the PCBM-PSCs maintain a favorable energy-level alignment, i.e. an ohmic contact between MoO3 and PTB7-Th PD.

To examine the impact of the variation in energy-level alignment in all-PSCs after aging, electrical characteristics of fresh and aged all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs devices were investigated by measuring light-intensity dependent Voc and Jsc, and voltage-dependent photocurrent (Veff–Jph curve) (Fig. 4). From this electrical characterization, the recombination and charge collection properties in solar cells can be obtained. First, slope values were derived from log-linear plot of Voc (S) and log–log plot of Jsc (α) as a function of light intensity (P, mW cm−2) to monitor the changes in monomolecular and bimolecular recombinations in the devices after aging.66,67 While PCBM-PSCs exhibited almost unchanged parameters over time (SPCBM-PSCs,fresh = 1.02 kBT/q, SPCBM-PSCS,aged = 1.05 kBT/q; αPCBM-PSCs,fresh = 1.00, αPCBM-PSCs,aged = 0.98) (Fig. 4b and d), all-PSCs showed significant deterioration in those properties. We observed that ideality factor S value considerably increased from 1.14 to 1.33 kBT/q (Fig. 4a) while α decreased from 0.95 to 0.91 (Fig. 4b), respectively, indicating that aged all-PSCs suffer from significant trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination. The increased recombination in all-PSCs is mainly caused by the non-ohmic contact formed at the active layer-MoO3 interface. In addition, consistently, charge collection efficiencies (P(E,T)) in the all-PSCs decreased significantly from 79% to 49%, whereas those of the PCBM-PSCs remain nearly constant (P(E,T)PCBM-PSCs,fresh = 90%, P(E,T)PCBM-PSCs,aged = 88%) (Fig. 4e and f), indicating that the unfavorable energy-level alignment by the interaction of the P(NDI2HD-T) PA and MoO3 caused the poor P(E,T) in the aged all-PSCs.

Solutions for producing burn-in loss free, efficient all-PSCs
Based on our understanding on the origin of the burn-in loss in inverted all-PSCs, we incorporated a passivation layer to avoid the physical contact between PAs and MoO3 and eventually produce the burn-in free, stable all-PSCs (Fig. 5a). An important criterion for this passivation layer is that (i) it should efficiently transport holes to MoO3 and (ii) it should be processed with orthogonal solvents on top of the active layer. In this regard, a PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer is considered the good candidate for a proof-of-concept study. The PEDOT:PSS was introduced to the aforementioned all-PSCs, i.e. PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) and PBDTT-TPD:P(NDI2HD-T) active layers, before the deposition of MoO3 layer. Thus, the resulting device configuration was ITO/ZnO/all-polymer active layers/PEDOT:PSS/MoO3/Ag. We noted that both PTB7-Th and PBDTT-TPD based all-PSCs with the passivation layer between PAs and MoO3 exhibit the superior storage stability, i.e. the devices retained their initial photovoltaic performances (93% for PTB7-Th based all-PSCs, 95% for PBDTT-TPD based all-PSCs) after 24 h aging (Fig. 5c and Table S2†). This observation suggests that the interaction between PAs and MoO3 indeed accounts for the burn-in degradation in all-PSCs, and that it can be avoided by incorporating a passivation layer between them. We further evaluated the storage stability for the long-term period, and the devices remained stable over 1000 h (i.e., the PCE of the PBDTT-TPD based all-PSCs decreased by only 8% after 1000 h storage).

One may envision that replacing MoO3 with other materials can be an alternative route eliminating the burn-in problem instead of inserting the additional passivation layer. However, MoO3 is the most dominant component that has been used for fabricating inverted-type PSCs,68,69 which therefore is hard to replace. Hence, we considered that replacing the whole device configuration to a normal-type device can be a more feasible strategy to resolve the burn-in degradation issue of all-PSCs. Accordingly, we fabricated normal-type all-PSCs utilizing a polymeric interlayer PNDIT-F3N-Br as a buffer layer between the active layer and the top Ag electrode (Fig. 5b).52 Thus, the overall device architecture was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/all-polymer active layers/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag. Again, the storage stabilities of PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) and PBDTT-TPD:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs were investigated. We noted that the normal-type PBDTT-TPD:P(NDI2HD-T) all-PSCs exhibit a higher PCE (7.4%) compared to that of the inverted all-PSCs.22 Importantly, after changing the device configuration, the storage stabilities of both all-PSCs were found to be improved – both devices maintained 94% of their initial efficiencies after 24 h aging (Fig. 5d and Table S2†). Furthermore, the PTB7-Th and PBDTT-TPD based all-PSCs had only a 13% decrease in PCE over 1000 h of storage.
For these highly-stable all-PSCs, the energy-level alignments and electrical characteristics were investigated to elucidate the improved storage stability (Fig. 6). From UPS measurement, it was observed that the MoO3 layer passivated by a PEDOT:PSS layer exhibited a nearly unchanged WF (from 5.46 to 5.44 eV), in contrast with the results without the passivation layer (Fig. 3a). Also, normal-type all-PSCs with a PNDIT-F3N-Br layer showed the same trend. We derived the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the PNDIT-F3N-Br thin films on the active layer from the following relationship: LUMO = HOMO (from UPS measurements)70 + optical bandgap (from the previous work).52 The resulting LUMO energy levels remained similar as −4.57 eV and −4.49 eV for the fresh and the aged PNDIT-F3N-Br films, respectively. These results suggest that the favorable energy-level alignments can be well-maintained by a rational design of device configuration, preventing any burn-in degradation in all-PSCs. Consistently, the recombination and charge collection efficiency in these stable all-PSCs remained constant after 24 h aging. Trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination rates were almost unchanged in PEDOT:PSS-passivated (S = 1.01, α = 0.95 for the fresh device → S = 1.02, α = 0.95 for the aged device) and PNDIT-F3N-Br-based devices (S = 1.03, α = 0.98 for the fresh device → S = 1.07, α = 0.97 for the aged device) (Fig. 6b and c). The P(E, T) was also maintained after 24 h aging (79 to 77%) (Fig. 6d).

With these burn-in free all-PSC devices, we additionally evaluated their air stability and compared it with that of PCBM-PSCs (Fig. 7). PTB7-Th and PBDTT-TPD PDs based all- and PCBM-PSCs were prepared and those devices were fabricated with a PNDIT-F3N-Br interlayer in a normal configuration. In these devices, the device stabilities against air exposure can be fairly compared by decoupling the effects of the burn-in loss since both devices now have high storage stabilities. All the devices were stored under ambient air and dark condition without encapsulation. After over 50 h of storage, it was found that both all-PSCs preserve ∼85% of their initial PCEs. In contrast, PCBM-PSCs underwent significant degradation, showing approximately 80% decrease in their initial PCEs. Our results are in line with recent observations on the superior ambient stability of PBDB-T:P(NDI2OD-T2)-based all-PSCs over that of reference PCBM-PSCs.20 It has been suggested that the P(NDI2OD-T2) PA is resistant to moisture, whereas the PCBM may adsorb moisture possibly through the strong hydrogen bonding between the ester group of PCBM and the OH groups of water. Our result highlights the importance of securing the storage stability of all-PSCs to obtain the other crucial stabilities such as ambient and photo stabilities.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have systematically investigated the underlying mechanism of burn-in degradation of all-PSCs. We found that various high-performance all-PSCs can involve severe degradation within only 24 h, whereas the analogous PCBM-PSCs containing the same PDs show high storage lifetime. From detailed analyses on the morphology and the electrical properties in all-PSCs, we revealed that the interaction between NDI-based PAs and MoO3 interlayer results in change of the work function of MoO3 and thereby leads to an unfavorable non-ohmic contact in devices. This increased charge recombination and deteriorated charge extracting property in all-PSCs, which accounts for the significant burn-in loss in Jsc and FF values. From the lessons learned, we suggest two effective means to improve the storage lifetime of all-PSCs, (i) introducing a passivation layer (i.e., PEDOT:PSS) between the all-polymer active layer and the MoO3 layer or (ii) replacing MoO3 with efficient polymer interfacial materials. We demonstrated that all-PSCs with a modified device structures can possess excellent long-term storage stability as well as improved efficiency. We anticipate that the understanding grasped from this mechanistic study provides insight into designing highly-efficient and burn-in free all-PSCs.
