    , Accepted 18th August 2014First published on 18th August 2014AbstractHybrid organic/inorganic perovskite solar cells are attracting intense attention and further developments largely hinge on understanding the fundamental issues involved in the cell operation. In this paper, a liquid phase deposition (LPD) method is developed to design and grow a TiO2 nanolayer at room temperature for carbon-based perovskite solar cells. The TiO2 nanolayer grown on FTO glass is compact but polycrystalline consisting of tiny anatase TiO2 nanocrystals intimately stacked together. By directly exploiting this TiO2 nanolayer in a solar cell of TiO2 nanolayer/CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon, we have achieved a Voc as high as 1.07 V, the highest value reported so far for hole transporter-free CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. This is rationalized by the slower electron injection and longer electron lifetime due to the TiO2 nanolayer, which enhances the electron accumulation in CH3NH3PbI3 and consequently the Voc. By employing a rutile TiO2 nanorod (NR) array as a base structure for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer to support the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, the photocurrent density is considerably increased without obviously compromising the Voc (1.01 V). As a result, the power conversion efficiency is boosted from 3.67% to 8.61%. More elaborate engineering of the TiO2 nanolayer by LPD in conjunction with judicious interfacing with other components has the potential to achieve higher performances for this type of solar cell.
1 Introduction
Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite solar cells have the potential to offer high conversion efficiencies while permitting low-cost solution based manufacturing. In the last five years, the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have skyrocketed from the initial 3% to 17.9%,1–11 and over 20% efficiencies are expected to be achieved in the near future with the progress in basic understanding of their working mechanism and the further development of more controllable fabrication processes.4,12–14 Furthermore, through integration with silicon panels to create tandem cells, obtaining much higher efficiencies may be possible. Therefore, perovskite solar cells are predicted as the “next big thing” in photovoltaics.
Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite solar cells typically consist of TiO2/perovskite/hole transport material (HTM)/noble metal electrode. However, other cell structures are exploited and developed due to the excellent photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), including strong solar absorption,2,3,7 ambipolar charge transport,4,13,15 and long balanced carrier diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm).16,17 Among those new cell structures, HTM-free perovskite solar cells have become more and more promising, which avoid using unstable and/or expensive organic HTMs (mainly spiro-OMeTAD).18–27 Very recently, carbon-based perovskite solar cells stand out for their high efficiencies (a certified efficiency of 12.8%) and the obvious advantages of the carbon electrode, such as material abundance, low cost, superior stability and printable fabrication processes.24–28
Regardless of the development of different cell structures, a TiO2 nanolayer (dense layer and/or mesoporous layer) is still needed for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the TiO2 nanolayer accepts injected electrons and is the unique electron transport pathway. However, since perovskite itself is an efficient electron transporter, the TiO2 nanolayer is not a unique electron transport pathway in perovskite solar cells.13,15 And it has been proposed that partial electron accumulation and transport in the perovskite is favorable for obtaining a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) (due to the higher conduction band edge of perovskite than that of TiO2) and thus a higher efficiency.3,29,30
Herein, we report the growth of a TiO2 nanolayer by the liquid phase deposition (LPD) method31,32 at room temperature for CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells. In contrast to the commonly used TiO2 nanolayer, this unique LPD-TiO2 nanolayer could slow electron injection and prolong electron lifetime, which as a result enhanced the electron accumulation in CH3NH3PbI3 and led to a considerably higher Voc of 1.07 V, the highest value for HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. We have further used a TiO2 nanorod (NR) array as a base structure for this LPD-TiO2 nanolayer to support the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer, and achieved a significantly boosted photocurrent density without obviously compromising Voc (1.01 V), promoting the cell efficiency from 3.67% to 8.61%.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation

Preparation of LPD-TiO2 nanolayers. 
To prepare TiO2 nanolayers by the LPD method,31,32 the reaction solutions were firstly prepared by dissolving 0.05 M (NH4)2TiF6 and 0.15 M boric acid (H3BO3) in distilled water. Then, FTO glasses were placed in the reaction solution with the FTO thin film sides facing down. The reaction was carried out at room temperature and the thickness of the TiO2 nanolayers was controlled by varying the reaction duration.


TiO2 NR array as a base structure for LPD-TiO2 nanolayers. 
The TiO2 NRs were grown on FTO glass using the hydrothermal method. Briefly, FTO glass was immersed in the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL capacity) containing 0.6 mL of titanium(IV) butoxide, 25 mL of deionized (DI) water and 25 mL of concentrated HCl (36–38%).8,33 The hydrothermal process was carried out by putting the autoclave into an oven and heating at 180 °C for 3 h. The autoclave was then removed from the oven and cooled down to room temperature naturally. The samples were taken out and washed with DI water, and finally annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in air.
To deposit a LPD-TiO2 nanolayer on the FTO glass/TiO2 NR array, the TiO2 NR array was immersed in the LPD solutions with the TiO2 NR array side facing down.


Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells. 
First, the TiO2 nanolayers were pre-heated to 100 °C. Then, a N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing 460 mg mL−1 PbI2, which was pre-heated to 100 °C, was spin coated onto the TiO2 nanolayer-coated FTO glasses at 2500 rpm for 30 s.6 After being dried in air, the samples were heated up to 100 °C and left for 15 min to crystallize the PbI2. Finally, the samples were cooled naturally to room temperature again.
The deposition of the nanocarbon electrode was carried out by spin coating a chlorobenzene suspension of 15 mg mL−1 nanocarbon particles onto the top of TiO2/PbI2. Then, the samples were dried at room temperature and heated at 100 °C for 5 min.
Conversion of the PbI2 layer to CH3NH3PbI3 was performed by spin coating a 2-propanol solution containing 10 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I onto the top of TiO2/PbI2/nanocarbon at 100 rpm for 20 s.6 Finally, the samples were gently dried under a flow of dry air and then heated to 100 °C and left for 15 min to produce the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells.
For measurement, another piece of FTO glass, serving as an assistant collecting electrode, was clamped with the above CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon component for solar cell performance evaluation.


Preparation of USP-TiO2 nanolayer. 
A commonly used TiO2 dense layer for control experiments was deposited on FTO by a home-made ultrasonic spray deposition (USP) system at 500 °C using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (0.05 M, ethanol) as the precursor and air as the carrier gas.

2.2 Characterization
The morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL6700F) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips PW-1830 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (K = 0.15418 nm). Diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV-vis spectrophotometer (model Lambda 20). The XPS spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer model PHI 5600 XPS system with a resolution of 0.3–0.5 eV from a monochromated aluminium anode X-ray source with Mo Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on a photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, AXIS-ultra-DLD) with He(I) excitation of 21.22 eV and pass energy of 5 eV.
The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot was acquired using a CHI 660A electrochemical analyzer in a three-electrode system. The LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, an Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire served as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte used for this measurement contained 1 M KOH and the frequency was set at 3 kHz.
2.3 Photovoltaic measurements
The solar light simulator (Newport solar simulator, model number 6255, 150 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter) was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a silicon reference solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. A black metal shading mask (0.09 cm2) was used to define the illumination area of the cells to be tested and tightly packaged to prevent light incident from the edges. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curves were recorded on an IM6x electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co., KG, Germany). Incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded using an IPCE kit developed by ZAHNER-Elektrik in AC mode with a frequency of 1 Hz. For time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements, a tunable Ti:sapphire femtosecond-pulsed laser was used as the excitation light source, with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an incident light intensity of 1 W cm−2. A Hamamatsu C5680-04 streak camera was used for the TRPL experiments. The TRPL measurements were performed under vacuum.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 The formation of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer and its influence on CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells
To prepare LPD-TiO2 nanolayers, we used an aqueous solution containing 0.05 M (NH4)2TiF6 and 0.15 M H3BO3. The LPD of metal oxide nanolayers was performed via a chemical equilibrium reaction between a metal fluoro-complex and a metal oxide in an aqueous solution.31,32 Specifically, the deposition reactions of LPD-TiO2 nanolayers can be expressed as: TiF62− (aq) + 2H2O → TiO2 (s) + 4HF (aq) + 2F− (aq)(1) H3BO3 (aq) + 4 HF (aq) → BF4− (aq) + 3H2O (l) + H+ (aq)(2)
Interestingly, H3BO3 here can serve as an F− scavenger, which consumes the F− ions (eqn (2)) and thus accelerates the hydrolysis reaction (eqn (1)). In this way, LPD at low temperature31,32 could produce partially crystalline TiO2, which could be used to control the electron injection by modulating the TiO2/perovskite interface.
SEM was firstly applied to evaluate the morphology of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers. As shown in Fig. 1(A), although the surface feature of FTO glass could still be observed, the FTO substrate becomes rough in nanoscale due to the coverage of tiny nanoparticles after LPD for 6 h. The cross sectional SEM image in Fig. 1(A1) shows that the film thickness is about 50 nm. As the LPD duration increases to 12 h, the surface features of FTO glass could hardly be observed, demonstrating the formation of a relatively flat LPD-TiO2 nanolayer. The size of the tiny nanoparticles seems to be unchanged, suggesting that generating a new crystal nucleus instead of the continued growth of old crystals mainly promotes the growth of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, which is favorable for producing a compact TiO2 nanolayer. As indicated in Fig. 1(B1), the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer very compactly covers the FTO glass with the thickness increasing to about 110 nm.
 Fig. 1  Morphology evaluation of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer synthesised with different LPD durations. Top-view SEM images: (A) 6 h, (B) 12 h, (C) 18 h and (D) 36 h. (A1), (B1), (C1) and (D1) are the corresponding cross sectional SEM images. Scale bar: 200 nm. 
When the LPD duration was extended to 18 h, the size of the tiny nanoparticles is still very small (Fig. 1(C)), but small pores with the size similar to that of the tiny particles are homogeneously dispersed on the surface. As depicted in Fig. 1(C1), the film thickness is increased to about 180 nm and the film is still intimately covered on the surface of the FTO glass. Further extending the LPD duration to 36 h resulted in a slight increase in size for both the tiny nanoparticles and the pores (Fig. 1(D)) with the film thickness increasing to about 320 nm (Fig. 1(D1)). As indicated in the SEM images and observed during experiments, the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers show excellent adherence to the FTO glass, which could not be destroyed by ultrasonic agitation.
XRD patterns and Raman spectra were recorded to evaluate the composition and structural phase of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers. As shown in Fig. 2(A), in addition to the characteristic diffraction peaks of FTO glass, other peaks at 25.0° and 47.8° are observed, which can be well indexed to the (101) and (200) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. Similarly, as indicated in Fig. 2(B), the peaks at 166 cm−1, 501 cm−1 and 623 cm−1 can be assigned to the three Raman-active modes of Eg, A1g and Eg of anatase TiO2,34–38 respectively. However, compared with the corresponding Raman shift data in the literature,34–36 obvious blue shifts occurs, plausibly due to the much smaller size of the anatase TiO2 crystals prepared by LPD.38 According to the relation between the position of the Eg mode (ω) and the diameter of TiO2 nanocrystals (L),38 ω = 100(1/L1.5) + ω0(3)where ω0 = 142 cm−1, the diameter of the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals should be only about 3 nm. Together, both the XRD and Raman shift results demonstrate that the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is in the anatase phase and composed of tiny nanocrystals. Both the peak intensities of the XRD pattern and Raman shift are low, again suggesting the low crystallinity of the anatase TiO2 nanolayers.

Semiconducting properties of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer: (E) M–S plot, (F) UV-vis absorption spectrum, and (G) UPS spectrum. Inset in (F) is the (αhv)1/2–hv plot and inset in (G) is the magnified region between of the UPS spectrum, 6–8 eV. 
TEM was also applied to characterize the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers. It can be readily seen in Fig. 2(C) that the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers are polycrystalline. As indicated by the white line circles, the nanocrystal diameter is about several nanometers, consistent with the Raman shift results. Note that these tiny nanocrystals are compactly stacked together, making it possible to form a uniform film. The observed electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2(D)) can be readily indexed to the (101), (004), (200), (211), (105) and (204) planes of anatase TiO2, confirming the polycrystalline nature of anatase TiO2 nanolayer prepared by LPD.
To study the semiconducting properties of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot was first measured. As shown in Fig. 2(E), the M–S plot shows a positive slope, indicating an n-type semiconductor behavior. The free charge carrier density in the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer could be calculated using eqn (4):39 Nc = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(4)where e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of anatase TiO2, ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, Nc the carrier density and V the applied potential. Nc for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is calculated to be about 1.27 × 1020 cm−3. This high Nc will be favorable for electron transport in, for example, solar cells.
From the UV-vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 2(F), the absorption threshold of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is obtained at about 390 nm, corresponding to the electronic transition from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of anatase TiO2. The (αhv)1/2–hv plot in the inset of Fig. 2(F) indicates that the band gap (Eg) values of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is about 3.12 eV, consistent with the typical value for anatase TiO2. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) result in Fig. 2(G) indicates that the VB edge for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is about −7.19 eV with reference to the vacuum level. The CB edge of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is calculated to be about −4.07 eV using the relation: Eg = ECB − EVB, which is lower than the CB edge of CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore, the energy band structure of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is suitable for electron injection in the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells.
To fabricate the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, the processes illustrated in Fig. 3(A) are applied. Firstly, the N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing 460 mg mL−1 PbI2 was spin coated onto the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer.6 After crystallization, a vivid PbI2 layer composed of sheet-like nanocrystals is deposited on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, with a thickness of about 300 nm (Fig. S1(A)†). Nanocarbon electrode was coated on the top of FTO/TiO2/PbI2 by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution containing 15 mg mL−1 nanocarbon particles. After drying, a porous nanocarbon layer tens of micrometers thick is formed on the top of the PbI2 layer with nanocarbon nanoparticles of about 30–80 nm in diameter, as shown in Fig. S1(B) and (C).† Then, the 2-propanol solution containing 10 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I was spin coated on the top of FTO/TiO2/PbI2/nanocarbon.6 Due to the porous structure of nanocarbon electrode, the CH3NH3I solution could penetrate through the nanocarbon electrode to reach and react with the PbI2 layer to generate CH3NH3PbI3. As a result, the PbI2 layer would be converted to CH3NH3PbI3 and this conversion was further promoted after heating at 100 °C for 15 min.

(B) Cross sectional SEM images and (C) energy level diagram and charge transfer processes of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells. And (D) J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on LPD-TiO2 nanolayers with different thicknesses. 

Fig. 3(B) represents the cross sectional SEM image of the typical TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells, showing a clear layer-by-layer structure. The cubic crystal could be vividly observed at the CH3NH3PbI3 interlayer, implying the high quality of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals prepared by our preparation strategy. As expected, the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 interlayer is increased to about 400 nm in comparison with that of PbI2 layer because the volume would be increased after the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3. As a result, through a careful observation, a fraction of the bottom nanocarbon layer attached onto the PbI2 layer is embedded in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, forming a very intimate contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and the nanocarbon layers favorable for hole extraction in operating solar cells.
The energy level diagram and charge transfer processes in the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 3(C). When CH3NH3PbI3 is excited by light illumination, electrons and holes are generated on the CB and VB, respectively. Since the CB of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is located at about −4.07 eV, electron injection will take place at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface from the CB (−3.90 eV) of CH3NH3PbI3 to the CB of TiO2, and these electrons will be finally collected at the FTO glass. In parallel, the holes are extracted by the nanocarbon electrode through the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon interface from the VB (−5.40 eV) of CH3NH3PbI3 to the nanocarbon electrode (Fermi level: −5.0 eV).24

Fig. 3(D) exhibits the J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers with different thicknesses, and Table 1 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. For comparison, the solar cells based on bare FTO glass were also prepared, and their performance was so poor and unstable that their J–V curve could not be obtained. Comparatively, the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer about 50 nm thick allowed us to obtain reproducible J–V curves, but the Voc is only about 0.18 V and the Jsc is also very low, resulting in a low η at about 0.18%. As the film thickness is increased to 110 nm, the cell performance is obviously improved with a Voc of 0.98 V and a Jsc of 3.44 mA cm−2, amounting to a η of 1.67%.

Further thickening of the film to 180 nm continued to improve the cell performance with a Voc as high as 1.07 V, which is the highest reported Voc for HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells including carbon and Au-based CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells.18,19,21–27 Since the CB of LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is located at −4.07 eV, the maximum obtainable Voc is about 0.93 V if the highest electron and lowest hole energy levels are assumed to be the CB of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer and the Fermi level of the nanocarbon (−5.0 eV), respectively. The ultrahigh Voc (1.07 V) we obtained further verifies the proposition of carrier accumulation in CH3NH3PbI3.4,13,15 What is more, Jsc and FF are also increased to 4.54 mA cm−2 and 0.54, respectively, leading to a η of 2.62%. Finally, when the film thickness is increased to 320 nm, Voc is slightly decreased to 1.00 V, but Jsc continued to increase to 6.28 mA cm−2, corresponding to a η up to 3.67%. It seems that the level of electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 plays an important role is dictating the Voc and Jsc.
3.2 Insight into the influence of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer on the cell performance
To gain a deeper insight into the performance enhancement mechanism of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, a commonly used dense anatase TiO2 nanolayer with high crystallinity (Fig. S2†) for perovskite solar cells was prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP). For meaningful comparison, the thicknesses of the two TiO2 nanolayers were controlled at about 100 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(A), the current densities for both solar cells are not very high since they are compact and thin. But it can still be seen that the USP-TiO2 nanolayer based solar cells achieve a higher Jsc (5.12 mA cm−2) than the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer based ones (3.02 mA cm−2). Whereas the latter achieves a considerably higher Voc (0.94 V) and FF (0.56) than the former (Voc = 0.78 V and FF = 0.31). As a result, the former achieves a η of 1.63%, which is higher than the latter one (1.37%).
 Fig. 4  Performance comparison between the USP-TiO2 nanolayer and LPD-TiO2 nanolayer. (A) J–V curves of CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells; (B) TRPL streak camera images of (a) CH3NH3PbI3, (b) USP-TiO2 nanolayer/CH3NH3PbI3 and (c) LPD-TiO2 nanolayer/CH3NH3PbI3; (C) Fitted TRPL with biexponential decay traces; and (D) τn–Voc curves of CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells. 
To pin down the origin of the performance difference between these two TiO2 nanolayers, TRPL was first performed to investigate the electron injection rate from CH3NH3PbI3 to TiO2 nanolayers. Fig. 4(B) presents the streak camera images of TRPL, which map the PL decays at different wavelengths and provide an overview of the transient spectral behaviors. As can be easily observed, bare CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits the slowest PL decays, while accelerated PL decays occur to the two TiO2 nanolayers presumably due to the electron injection. More interestingly, the PL decay is slower for CH3NH3PbI3 on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer than that on the USP-TiO2 nanolayer, suggesting the slower electron injection of the former.
The PL decay curves extracted from Fig. 4(B) are displayed in Fig. 4(C). The PL lifetime (τ), which is defined as the time when the PL intensity decreases to 1/e of the original value, is calculated for the CH3NH3PbI3 on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer to be about 880 ps, which is lower than that on the USP-TiO2 nanolayer, about 515 ps. The slower electron injection could partially account for the lower Jsc for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer. But more importantly, this slower electron injection is expected to accumulate electrons in CH3NH3PbI3, causing an increase in Voc if recombination loss in the solar cells is not significant.
Further information on the recombination loss in the solar cells can be obtained from the electron lifetime (τn) measured by the OCVD technique. OCVD curves were recorded immediately after the interruption of light illumination and τn was determined according to eqn (5):40 τn = kBT/q(dVoc/dt)−1(5)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature and q the positive elementary charge. As shown in Fig. 4(D), the τn for the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is about 2–4 times longer than that based on the USP-TiO2 nanolayer in the whole potential range, implying a slower recombination reaction in the former solar cells than in the latter, in keeping with the higher Voc and FF.
Conclusively, the slower electron injection and longer electron lifetime in the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer based solar cells are held responsible for their increased Voc and FF compared with those in USP-TiO2 nanolayer based solar cells. The lower crystallinity and/or the smaller size of the TiO2 nanocrystals in the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer may account for the slower electron injection, while the slower electron recombination hints at a better interface contact between the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer and CH3NH3PbI3. Clearly, further investigations are needed to better understand the detailed causality involved. Nevertheless, it has been clearly demonstrated that the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer holds promise for designing perovskite solar cells with high Voc and FF.
Though the ultrahigh Voc was achieved for the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers, the photocurrent densities were low, which limited the power conversion efficiencies. The low current density should be attributed to the fact that all these LPD-TiO2 nanolayers are flat and compact, which makes it difficult to achieve a homogenous coverage of a sufficiently thick and effective CH3NH3PbI3 layer through solution-based processes.15,41,42 This low quality CH3NH3PbI3 layer would lead to a poor light absorption of CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells. To resolve this problem, we made an attempt to employ TiO2 NR array grown on FTO glass as a base structure for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayers to support a high quality CH3NH3PbI3 layer as described below.
3.3 LPD-TiO2 nanolayers on a rutile NR array for CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells
To grow the TiO2 NR array, a typical hydrothermal method was applied with FTO thin film as the seed layer. After 3 h of hydrothermal treatment, TiO2 NRs with an average length of 600 nm were grown on FTO glass, as shown in Fig. 5(A). The diameter of TiO2 NRs ranges from 40 to 80 nm. After LPD for 2 h, the surface of the TiO2 NRs becomes rough (Fig. 5(B)) in comparison with those in Fig. 5(A), indicating the secondary growth of TiO2 on the TiO2 NRs. Besides, the exposed surface of FTO glass between TiO2 NRs is also covered with a new growth layer. As the LPD duration was extended to 5 h, the surface of the TiO2 NRs becomes more rough, resulting in an obvious increase in diameter (Fig. 5(C)), and the overlayer on the exposed surface of FTO glass between the TiO2 NRs is also thickened. On further increasing the LPD duration to 9 h, an obvious nanobranch structure appears to be formed, and the space between TiO2 NRs is reduced accompanied by the crowded roots of the TiO2 NRs (Fig. 5(D)).

Next, XRD patterns and Raman spectra were acquired to evaluate the composition of the samples before and after LPD. For bare TiO2 NRs, in addition to the characteristic diffraction peaks of FTO glass (Fig. 5(E)), the diffraction peaks at 27.3°, 36.0°, 41.2°, 51.6°, 54.4° and 62.7° are indexed to (110), (101), (111), (211), (220) and (002) planes of rutile TiO2, respectively. After LPD, two new diffraction peaks at 25.0° and 47.9° that could be indexed to the (101) and (200) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively, are observed, implying that anatase TiO2 was deposited on the rutile TiO2 NRs after LPD.
The Raman spectra in Fig. 5(F) indicate that only the peaks at 238 cm−1, 445 cm−1 and 608 cm−1 are observed for bare TiO2 NRs, consistent with the three Raman-active modes of B1g, Eg and A1g of rutile TiO2,43,44 respectively, confirming the rutile phase of TiO2 NRs. After LPD, a new and obvious peak accompanying those of rutile TiO2 is detected at 166 cm−1, which can be easily assigned to the Eg mode of anatase TiO2. Therefore, both XRD and Raman shift results corroborate that the secondary growth through LPD forms the anatase TiO2-coated layer on the rutile TiO2 NR array.
To tap into the structural features of the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayer, TEM was further applied. For the bare TiO2 NRs, the surface is smooth as shown in Fig. 6(A). The HRTEM in Fig. 6(A1) demonstrates the single-crystalline structure of the TiO2 NRs with the growth orientation along the [001] direction. After LPD for 2 h, a new outer layer with a thickness of about several nanometers is deposited, which coarsens the surface of the TiO2 NRs. The HRTEM image in Fig. 6(B1) demonstrates that the outlined fringes are consistent with the (101) planes of anatase TiO2, further confirming the deposition of an anatase TiO2 polycrystalline nanolayer on the surface of the rutile TiO2 NRs. The TEM image in Fig. 6(C) indicates that the outer anatase TiO2 nanolayer thickens up to 30–40 nm as the LPD duration extends to 5 h. The electron diffraction pattern in the inset of Fig. 6(C) indicates that in addition to the diffraction spots of single rutile TiO2, the polycrystalline diffraction rings corresponding to the (101), (004) and (200) planes of anatase TiO2 are also detected. Therefore, anatase TiO2 polycrystalline nanolayer is deposited on the single rutile TiO2 NRs after LPD. The HRTEM image in Fig. 6(C1) indicates that the size of the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals is about several nanometers and they stack compactly on each other.

On the basis of the SEM, XRD, Raman shift and TEM results, it can be concluded that the nature of the TiO2 nanolayer prepared by LPD is barely changed when the substrate is changed from FTO glass to FTO glass/TiO2 NRs, suggesting that the LPD method can be applied to deposit TiO2 nanolayers on various substrates with similar material properties. To sum up, the structure and composition of the FTO glass/TiO2 NRs before and after LPD can be illustrated in Fig. 6(D).
To fabricate CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers, the same fabrication processes to those based on LPD-TiO2 nanolayers were applied. The cross sectional SEM image of the solar cells in Fig. 7(A) exhibits the vivid three-layer structure. The interlayer becomes compact in comparison with the cross sectional morphology of the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers in Fig. 5 due to the penetration and deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 between TiO2 NRs. The thickness of the interlayer is increased to 800 nm in comparison with that of the bare TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayer (Fig. 5), suggesting the deposition of a top layer of CH3NH3PbI3 on the TiO2 NRs. The scheme in Fig. 7(B) clearly illustrates the cross sectional structure of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers.

(D) J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers with different LPD durations. 
The energy level diagram and charge transfer processes in the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers are illustrated in Fig. 7(C). Photogenerated electrons on the CB of CH3NH3PbI3 will firstly be injected into the CB of anatase TiO2 (−4.07 eV) and then transferred to the CB of rutile TiO2 NRs (−4.10 eV) (see Fig. S4†). Finally, the electrons, after being transported through the single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NRs, will be collected at the FTO glass. Meanwhile, the holes in the CB of CH3NH3PbI3 will be extracted by the nanocarbon electrode.

Fig. 7(D) presents the J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells based on the TiO2 NRs/LPD-TiO2 nanolayers with different LPD durations and Table 1 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The solar cells based on bare TiO2 NRs exhibit a considerably higher Jsc = 9.35 mA cm−2 than those based on LPD-TiO2 nanolayers, which should be due to the deposition of the thicker effective CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer. However, both Voc and FF are low, 0.54 V and 0.27, respectively, implying the serious recombination at the exposed FTO glass/nanocarbon and/or the rutile TiO2/nanocarbon interfaces. As a result, only a low η (1.36%) is obtained.
The LPD-TiO2 nanolayer on the exposed FTO glass and the TiO2 NR array appear to effectively suppress charge recombination at the above mentioned interfaces. In addition, electron accumulation in CH3NH3PbI3 will also be enhanced. As a result, the Voc, Jsc, FF and η are all obviously improved after deposition of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer. At the optimized LPD duration of 5 h, η as high as 8.61% was obtained accompanied by high Jsc, Voc and FF of 14.20 mA cm−2, 1.01 V and 0.60, respectively.
Therefore, by using the rutile TiO2 NR array as a base structure for the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer to support a relatively thick effective CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer, we are able to achieve a considerably increased Jsc without obviously compromising Voc (1.01 V) and hence produce a significantly improved η.
4 Conclusion
To control electron injection in carbon-based CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, we have prepared a TiO2 nanolayer by the LPD method at room temperature. The TiO2 nanolayer is compact and composed of tiny anatase TiO2 nanocrystals intimately stacked together. Directly applying the TiO2 nanolayer onto FTO glass to CH3NH3PbI3/nanocarbon solar cells produced a Voc as high as 1.07 V, which constitutes the highest value for HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. Comparatively, the commonly used TiO2 nanolayer could only achieve a low Voc of 0.78 V. We have shown that the considerably higher Voc for the solar cells based on the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is due to a slower electron injection and longer electron lifetime, which enhanced the electron accumulation in CH3NH3PbI3. The application of the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer to a rutile TiO2 NR array was found to significantly enhance the photocurrent density of the corresponding solar cells without obviously compromising Voc (1.01 V), upgrading the η from 3.67% to 8.61%. Higher performance is anticipated for the perovskite solar cells when the LPD-TiO2 nanolayer is better interfaced with other components of the devices.
