It is found that the surface texture increases as the film thickness increases, while the preferential orientation of the crystal also changes gradually during the film growth. The textured zinc oxide film exhibits high transparency over 80% even for a relatively thick (e.g., 3.5 μm) film. Numerical modeling further indicates that the short circuit current of the thin film microcrystalline silicon solar cell can be increased by 20% due to the light trapping effect arising from the textured zinc oxide film. Meanwhile, the sheet resistance of the as-grown textured zinc oxide film can be reduced drastically by hydrogen plasma treatment.
Introduction
Light trapping being vital for efficient light harvesting in thin film solar cells has been well studied.1–5 The typical strategy for light trapping is to enhance light scattering and thus the effective optical path length in thin film solar cells. A variety of structures including pyramidal textured surface and nanowire arrays,6–8 have been successfully fabricated for light trapping in photovoltaic devices. As for the thin film silicon solar cells, the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) with random pyramidal surface texture is usually employed for light trapping which is of paramount importance for the weakly absorbed light (800 nm to 1100 nm).9,10 In comparison to other TCO, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), zinc oxide (ZnO) is more preferable for production due to its abundance in the earth's crust and its lower cost. Moreover, ZnO exhibits higher hydrogen plasma resistance, which is essential for growth of silicon thin film using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).11 Nowadays, industrial scale of high quality ZnO films can be obtained by using magnetron-sputtering or CVD methods,9–13 although instrumental complexity requires high investment costs. In addition, some vacuum methods (e.g., magnetron-sputtering) would yield relatively flat ZnO film which needs further surface-texturing process (e.g., chemical wet-etching) to improve the light scattering capability.12 Craters are usually formed by wet-etching sputtered aluminum doped ZnO (AZO) film, with predominantly small-angle scattering properties, which is less attractive for light trapping when compared with the Lambertian (cosine)-like angular resolved scattering from the pyramidal texture.13,14 To this end, low cost non-vacuum approaches for fabrication of pyramid-like ZnO film with strong light scattering capability are of great interest for light trapping in thin film silicon solar cells.
In this work, we demonstrate a low-temperature solution method for the growth of pyramid-like ZnO film with strong light scattering capability to enhance the light absorption in thin film silicon solar cells. Similar with that obtained from the low-pressure CVD (LPCVD),9 the feature size of pyramid and the scattering ability of ZnO film can be tuned by varying the thickness of ZnO film. To the best of our knowledge, no solution based pyramid-like ZnO film with relatively large surface texture has been reported before. Simulation results further indicate that the as-grown pyramid-like ZnO film substantially improves the quantum efficiency of microcrystalline thin film silicon solar cells at longer wavelength.
Experimental section
The pyramid-like ZnO film was prepared from the chemical bath deposition (CBD) on the glass substrates. Before the CBD process, a thin ZnO seed layer (∼60 nm) was deposited on the glass by a sol–gel method.15 The textured film deposition was carried out by immersing the seeded substrate in a solution of zinc acetate dehydrate and methenamine in a mixture of water and ethanol.16 For a single step of growth, the solution was placed in a glass bottle which was kept in an oven at 80 °C for 4 hours. In order to increase the texture of the pyramid-like ZnO film and thus its light scattering capability, the same process was repeated one to four times. Due to large resistivity of intrinsic ZnO, a thin layer of highly transparent conductive film was deposited on top of the as-grown textured ZnO film to improve the electrical conductivity of the photovoltaic devices. As an example, a layer of 250 nm thick AZO film was deposited on the thick pyramid-like ZnO (4× depositions) by rf-magnetron sputtering from ceramic target (2 wt% Al2O3) at a pressure of 0.36 Pa and a substrate temperature of 180 °C. The resistivity of the sputtered AZO film is around 5 × 10−4 Ω cm which is comparable to the reported values of typical AZO film.13 X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of ZnO films were recorded with a Philiip X'pert instrument. The surface morphology and the cross-section of the textured ZnO films were characterized using a Philips XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectra were obtained at room temperature with an UV/vis spectrometer (Lambda 750) equipped with an integrating sphere. Finally, the effect of hydrogen plasma (120 mTorr, 300 W, 20 minutes) treatment was also studied as an alternative method to increase the conductivity of the as-grown textured ZnO film.
Results and discussion
The surface morphology of pyramid-like ZnO film with and without sputtered AZO was characterized by using SEM. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the feature size of pyramid (without sputtered AZO) from 4× deposition is larger than that of from 1× deposition (inset of Fig. 1(a)). The as-grown pyramid-like textured ZnO film via n× growth will be denoted as TZ-n (n = 1–4) in the following context. Similar with that obtained from the LPCVD,9 it is the pyramidal structure that gives to these ZnO films an surface texture, which would efficiently scatter the light. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the basis size of the emerging pyramids for TZ-1 and TZ-4 are roughly 150 nm and 500 nm, respectively. The SEM surface morphology of TZ-4 with sputtered 250 nm thick AZO film (AZO@TZ-4) and its corresponding cross-section are presented in Fig. 1(b) and its inset, respectively. The as-grown textured ZnO film has large crystal grains in its bulk without noticeable voids observed, indicating that light scattering would mainly occur at its textured surface. The thicknesses of TZ-1 and TZ-4 are around 0.5 μm and 3.5 μm, respectively, and the feature size of pyramid increases as the increase of film thickness. It is worth noting that the growth rate of film exhibits some variation in the deposition process, e.g., the thickness of TZ-1 and TZ-2 is around 0.5 μm and 1.5 μm, respectively. Such variation is mainly due to the different substrate condition, i.e., the substrate with only the sol–gel based ZnO seeding layer differs significantly in growth rate with that after one step or two steps of textured ZnO growth. As will be discussed later, the growth rate is also related with the crystal orientations. The 250 nm thick AZO film is almost conformal deposited on top of TZ-4, with certain nanoscale-texturing formed. Such nanoscale-texturing might cause antireflection and light scattering for light with shorter wavelength.17

Besides the morphology variation, the crystal orientation of the as-grown textured ZnO film may also change significantly. The corresponding XRD spectra of the ZnO seed as well as the as-grown textured ZnO films are presented in Fig. 2. As illustrated, the diffraction peak of ZnO seed is extremely weak and thus diffraction signal mainly stems from the as-grown textured ZnO film. The diffraction peaks of as-grown textured ZnO film can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite structures (JCPDS card no. 79-2205). As for the TZ-1, it is preferentially oriented along the direction perpendicular to the (101) crystallographic plane. Surprisingly, as increase of the film thickness, the preferential orientation (the strongest diffraction peak) of the crystallite switches from (101) to (112), as depicted in Fig. 2. The crystal growth on the ZnO surfaces and hence the final shapes of the crystals are believed to be related with the solvent–solute interactions along different orientations of a crystal.18,19 Since the surface atomic arrangement and thus the surface affinity for the solvent to each orientation is different, the growth rate on different crystal facet can be quite different. The evolution of orientation from (101) to (112) implies that crystal facet of (112) presents better surface affinity for the given solution than that of (101). While the preferential crystal orientation of (101) in TZ-1 is most likely due to the preferential crystal orientation of (101) in the seed layer as depicted in Fig. 2. As thickness increase, this original preferential orientation gradually disappears. Based on the (101) diffraction peak, the crystal size calculated from the Sherrer's equation yields a value of around 31 nm for these as-grown textured ZnO films, which is much smaller than the corresponding feature size of the pyramids. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the smallest crystals (including those in the seed-layer) at the bottom of the ZnO film are responsible for the observed broadening of the XRD peak, while crystals with large size have negligible contribution to the peak broadening.

The transmission spectra of the textured ZnO films were obtained by using UV-Vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. As depicted in Fig. 3(a), the total transmission of TZ-1 and TZ-4 are around 85% and 80% in the spectral range from 500 to 1200 nm, respectively. Unlike the reduced transmission (∼70% at 1100 nm) observed for the doped ZnO films,20 the as-grown textured ZnO films exhibit high transparency even at longer wavelength, implying its low carrier concentration. The sputtered 250 nm thick AZO on glass shows comparable transmission with that of TZ-1, while the transmission of AZO@TZ-4 is close to that of TZ-4. Fig. 3(b) illustrates the corresponding transmission haze as a function of wavelength defined as the ratio of diffuse transmission over the total transmission. As expected, the light scattering capability of the sputtered AZO film on glass is rather weak, with negligible transmission haze in the whole spectral range. As for the textured ZnO films, the light scattering capability significantly increases with thickness (or surface texture), as illustrated by the increase of corresponding transmission haze represented in Fig. 3(b). It's worth noting that the haze ratio of the as-grown textured ZnO film can be comparable to that of ZnO from LPCVD.9 In addition, the transmission haze of AZO@TZ-4 is comparable with that of TZ-4, indicating that the as-grown ZnO textured film with sputtered AZO can be used as transparent electrode with strong light scattering capability. By using four-point probe measurement, it is found that the sheet resistance of sputtered AZO film on top of textured ZnO film is almost the same with that of sputtered AZO film on bare glass. It means that low sheet resistance (e.g., 10 Ω sq−1) could be achieved for a relatively thick (e.g., 500 nm) AZO film sputtered on the as-grown textured ZnO film.

In order to study the effect of light trapping induced by the as-grown textured ZnO film on the optical performance of photovoltaic devices, we take AZO@TZ-4 as the front electrode in the thin film microcrystalline silicon (μcSi) solar cells as an example by means of ASA simulation.21–23 The modeling parameters are mainly adapted from work by Ding et al.23 Based on the scalar scattering theory,22,24 light scattering at the rough interface of AZO@TZ-4/air or AZO@TZ-4/p-μcSi was described by using the atomic force microscopy image (not shown) of the AZO@TZ-4 as input in the ASA program. Fig. 4(a) gives the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) for the AZO film and TZ-4, respectively. For a better fitting of the total transmission spectra, the k value of both AZO film and TZ-4 was slightly modified based on the values in ref. 23. As can be seen in Fig. 4(b), the transmission spectra of 250 nm thick AZO film and AZO@TZ-4 were more or less fitted. As for the 250 nm thick AZO film deposited on the glass, we neglect the light scattering at the AZO/air interface due to its smooth nature which is evidenced from its transmission haze. In the simulation of thin film silicon solar cell, the following structure was used: glass (4 mm)/AZO (250 nm) or AZO (250 nm)@TZ-4 (3.5 μm)/p-μcSi (20 nm)/i-μcSi (1200 nm)/n-μcSi (20 nm)/GZO (75 nm)/Ag (200 nm). In following context, the device with AZO and the device with AZO@TZ-4 as the front electrode will be denoted as D_AZO and D_AZO@TZ-4, respectively. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the absorption in each layer for D_AZO and D_AZO@TZ-4, respectively. As illustrated, the parasitic absorption in D_AZO@TZ-4 is larger than that in D_AZO for spectral range from 300 nm to 450 nm, as a result of the introduction of TZ-4. The distinct interference pattern presented in Fig. 5(a) arises from the coherent nature of specular light in the device (D_AZO) with flat interfaces, while it was alleviated remarkably for D_AZO@TZ-4 due to the strong light scattering at the rough interface, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The corresponding simulated external quantum efficiency (EQE) of device is depicted in Fig. 5(c). The effect of sheet resistance of front electrode on the efficiency of current collection was not taken into account, since this simulation mainly focuses on the optical performance. Light absorbed in the layer of i-μcSi contributes to the major part of photocurrent in the devices, while the absorption in the doped silicon layers produces negligible photocurrent. Similar to the optical absorption in the layer of i-μcSi, the average EQE of textured device is larger than that of flat device in spectral range from 650 nm to 1100 nm (see Fig. 5(c)), although it is relative lower at short wavelength from 350 nm to 450 nm due to the aforementioned enhanced parasitic absorption from the TZ-4. As a result, the short circuit current density (JSC) estimated from the corresponding EQE is 18.6 mA cm−2 and 15.5 mA cm−2 for D_AZO@TZ-4 and D_AZO, respectively (corresponding to 20% enhancement). In order to verify the effect of enhanced light scattering on different thickness of light absorption layer, we also changed the thickness of i-μcSi layer from 800 nm to 1600 nm in ASA simulation. The improvement in JSC is 23% and 17% for i-μcSi with thickness of 800 nm and 1600 nm, respectively. This implies that the as-grown textured ZnO film can significantly improve the photocurrent of thin film silicon solar cells due to its strong light trapping effect. The simulated J–V characteristics of devices with different thickness of i-μcSi are summarized in Table 1.

As for the front electrode, low sheet resistance (<15 Ω sq−1) is critical in practical photovoltaic devices. Besides the aforementioned sputtered AZO coating, simple treatments, such as UV-light or hydrogen plasma,25,26 can also be employed to reduce the sheet resistance of as-grown textured ZnO films, which would be a more cost-effective way to fabricate highly transparent conductive ZnO films when combined with the low-temperature solution growth approach. In our initial experiment, hydrogen plasma was used to treat one of the as-grown samples (TZ-2), which results in a substantial decrease of sheet resistance from an initial value of 2.37 × 108 Ω sq−1 to 170 Ω sq−1. By fine turning the treatment process, lower sheet resistance could be achieved. Both the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies and the reduced density of electron traps at the grain boundaries might be responsible for the improvement of conductivity.27 Furthermore, the hydrogen plasma treatment used in this work has negligible influence on the optical absorbance of the textured ZnO films in the region of interest (300 nm to 1100 nm), which is consistence with the results obtained in the work of Ding et al.27 Besides the texturing of the front TCO, the as-grown textured ZnO films presented in this work may also be used in texturing of back-TCO of thin film silicon solar cells.28,29 Moreover, the low-temperature solution growth of textured ZnO films is compatible for deposition of thin film silicon solar cells on flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) or polyethylene-naphthalate (PEN), making it attractive for other potential light trapping applications.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the solution growth of textured ZnO films with pyramidal surface morphology, which have tunable light scattering capability and can be used in thin film silicon solar cells for efficient light trapping. The surface texture of the as-grown ZnO films increases with the increase of their thickness, and the preferential crystal orientation of textured ZnO film also gradually changes from (101) to (112). By means of ASA simulation, strong light trapping effect from the textured ZnO film was further verified in thin film microcrystalline silicon solar cells, with an increase of short circuit current density of more than 20%. Furthermore, the conductivity of the as-grown textured ZnO film could be significantly increased by simple hydrogen plasma post-treatment. Such solution based ZnO film with strong light scattering capability has great potential in the development of thin film solar cells.
