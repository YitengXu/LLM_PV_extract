    , Accepted 7th September 2015First published on 9th September 2015AbstractA new electron donor, 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTPO), for polymer semiconductors is reported. Its homopolymer PDTPO reveals a high hole mobility of 0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field-effect transistors. Its copolymers with benzodithiophenes (BDTO and BDTT), namely PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT, not only show wide optical bandgaps of 2.02 and 1.95 eV, but also possess deep HOMO levels of −5.38 and −5.44 eV, respectively. The polymer solar cell based on PDTPO-BDTO with an inverted architecture achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.84% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, while the one with PDTPO-BDTT realizes the same PCE with conventional architecture and a reasonably high Voc of 0.96 V. The PCEs are among the highest ever reported for wide bandgap PSCs. Compared to the blend with PDTPO-BDTO having the 2-ethylhexyloxy group, the one with PDTPO-BDTT having the 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2yl- group is demonstrated to be superior as a result of faster exciton separation into free charge carriers and larger driving force for exciton dissociation, which results in high short-circuit current and Voc, respectively. The wide optical bandgaps and the excellent device performances make these polymers good candidates for boosting the PCE of the PSCs with a ternary blend layer or tandem structures.
Introduction
Progress on new conjugated polymers,1,2 morphological control,3,4 as well as interlayer engineering5–7 have led to a significant improvement in the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10.5% for a single junction7–10 and 11% for tandem solar cells.11–13 Currently, low bandgap (LBG, Eg < 1.6 eV) and medium bandgap (WBG, 1.6 eV < Eg < 1.8 eV) polymers have achieved great success in high performance PSCs.8,14–20 With regard to wide bandgap (WBG) polymers, only a few of them have achieved high PCEs, in particular the polymers with an optical bandgap higher than 1.9 eV.21–28 In fact, developing new WBG conjugated polymers with excellent photovoltaic properties is of important significance for ternary blend layer or tandem PSCs.
Recently, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) has attracted considerable attention due to its application in organic optoelectronic devices.29 However, DTP-based materials usually show high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels because of their strong electron-donating properties, which usually result in low Voc and low PCEs.30,31 In 2010, Rasmussen and co-workers reported N-acyl-substituted DTP (see Scheme 1), in which the introduced carbonyl group led to a lowered HOMO level,32 and consequently the devices acquired high Voc.33,34
 Scheme 1  Evolution of lowering the electron donating capacity of the donor units. 
Inspired by the capability of the electron withdrawing carbonyl group to lower the HOMO level, herein we adopted a different approach to modify the structure of DTP and further lower the HOMO level of the resultant polymer by creatively incorporating the carbonyl group into the DTP ring. With the carbonyl group migrated into the DTP ring, a six-membered lactam ring flanked with two thiophenes, namely, 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTPO, see Scheme 1) was created to combine the advantages of the electron withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the polycyclic nature of the resultant unit. DTPO is expected to be a more π-extended ring compared to the N-acyl-substituted DTP, and the enlarged planar aromatic structure of DTPO would facilitate π-electron delocalization through the backbone of the resulting polymers, leading to a deep HOMO level.15,35
In this article, we report the synthesis and characteristics of the newly designed electron donor, 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTPO), with a long alkyl chain to increase its solubility without disturbing the planarity of the polymer backbone. To investigate the charge transporting properties of DTPO, its homopolymer PDTPO was initially synthesized and characterized in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and a high hole mobility of 0.19 cm−2 V−1 s−1 was demonstrated. Furthermore, aiming to design new WBG polymers for PSCs, DTPO was successfully incorporated into two D1–D2 type alternating copolymers, namely, PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT, with DTPO as one weak donor and 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTO) or 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) as the other donor. Benzodithiophene (BDT) is chosen here as the donor unit due to its solubilizing characteristics, effective tuning of the bandgap, and appropriate frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies.36–38PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT show optical bandgaps of 2.02 and 1.95 eV, respectively, which are larger than that of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (1.9 eV). Noticeably, the photovoltaic devices based on the two WBG polymers showed high Vocs up to 0.98 V and achieved high PCEs up to 6.84%.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of the new electron donor DTPO and its polymers PDTPO, PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT are shown in Scheme 2. The reaction of compound 1 with 3-thiophenecarbonyl chloride afforded amide 2, which was cyclized to give DTPO by intramolecular thiophene–thiophene coupling with FeCl3 as an oxidant.39 Bromination of DTPO with bromine under acidic conditions yielded the monomer M1. The PDTPO homopolymer was obtained via homocoupling of DTPO. PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT copolymers were obtained through the Stille coupling reaction of DTPO with BDTO and BDTT, respectively. The number-average-molecular weights (Mns) of the polymers are 9.46 kDa for PDTPO, 97.7 kDa for PDTPO-BDTO, and 75.4 kDa for PDTPO-BDTT, with polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.67, 2.98 and 2.50, respectively. The three polymers are soluble in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Owing to the introduction of a branched long-chain alkyl group into the DTPO unit, the polymers showed large molecular weights, which are beneficial for the performance of the devices.40
 Scheme 2  Synthesis and chemical structures of the monomer and the DTPO-based polymers. 
The thermal stability of the three polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1†). The decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of PDTPO, PDTPO-BDTO, and PDTPO-BDTT are 375, 335, and 434 °C, respectively, indicating that the polymers are stable enough for application in optoelectronic devices.
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption maxima of PDTPO in chloroform and in film are 516 and 542 nm, respectively. A 26 nm red-shift from solution to film indicates the enhanced interchain π–π stacking in the solid state. The absorption onset of PDTPO in the film is located at 666 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.86 eV, which is smaller than those of the homopolymers of BDTO (O-PBDT, 2.21 eV)41 and BDTT (PBDTT, 2.13 eV).42 The molar extinction coefficient of PDTPO is 1.61 × 104 M−1 cm−1. For each copolymer, the absorptions in solution and in film display similar bands with two well-defined peaks and steep absorption edges. Compared to PDTPO-BDTO, PDTPO-BDTT exhibits broader absorption spectra and red-shift in both solutions and films. This can be attributed to the two-dimensional extended π-conjugation of BDTT. The absorption onsets of the copolymer films are at 615 nm for PDTPO-BDTO and 635 nm for PDTPO-BDTT, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 2.02 and 1.95 eV, respectively. The bandgaps of the two copolymers are between that of PDTPO (1.86 eV) and those of the homopolymers of BDTO (O-PBDT, 2.21 eV) and BDTT (PBDTT, 2.13 eV).41,42 The molar extinction coefficients of PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT are 5.98 × 104 and 6.66 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which are among the highest values in organic semiconductors.43

Electrochemical properties
The oxidation and reduction onset potentials of PDTPO are 1.19 and −0.85 V (Fig. S2†), respectively, corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.53 and −3.48 eV, respectively. The HOMO levels are lower than those of the homopolymers of BDTO (O-PBDT, −5.31 eV)41 and BDTT (PBDTT, −5.44 eV).42 The low-lying HOMO energy level is expected to be beneficial for increasing the ambient stability of the polymer against oxidation as well as reducing the hole injection barrier between a gold source electrode and a p-type semiconductor, which consequently improve the device performance.44 The oxidation/reduction onset potentials of PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT are 1.10/1.16 and −0.91/−0.93 V (Fig. S3†), respectively, corresponding to the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.38/−5.44 and −3.37/−3.35 eV, respectively. The HOMO level of PDTPO-BDTO (−5.38 eV) is between those of PDTPO (−5.53 eV) and the homopolymer of BDTO (O-PBDT, −5.31 eV),41 while the HOMO level of PDTPO-BDTT (−5.44 eV) is higher than that of PDTPO (−5.53 eV) and is equal to that of the homopolymer of BDTT (PBDTT, −5.44 eV).42
Theoretical calculations
DFT calculations of the trimer of PDTPO, and the five units of PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level (Fig. S4†). In order to simplify the calculations, the side chains of the polymers were shortened to the methyl groups, because they do not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries or electronic properties.45 The minimum-energy conformation of the trimer shows that the HOMO is highly delocalized on the entire molecular backbone, which would contribute to hole transport. The amides are found to be oriented antiparallel in the DTPO trimer, and the dihedral angle between the two DTPO units is 8.2°. Both HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals of PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT extend across the entire conjugated systems, including the carbonyl moiety (Fig. S4†). Given the fact that the LUMO of a low bandgap D–A copolymer is almost completely delocalized on the acceptor moieties with a strong electron-withdrawing group,45 considering the results from optical and cyclic voltammetry, we conclude that DTPO is a weaker donor unit compared to the BDT unit.
Transport properties
To investigate the transport properties of DTPO, bottom-gate and top-contact (BGTC) OFETs based on the homopolymer PDTPO were fabricated. The polymer films were deposited by spin-coating the PDTPO solution in o-DCB (5 mg mL−1) onto octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates. The polymer films were then annealed at different temperatures for 5 minutes under air conditions. The gold drain-source electrodes were subsequently fabricated onto the polymer films by vacuum deposition. Fig. 3a and b show the typical transfer and output curves of the device. PDTPO showed unipolar p-type field-effect behavior as the drain current increases with negative gate voltages. The device performances of PDTPO annealed at different temperatures are summarized in Table S1.† It was found that the polymer film exhibited improved hole mobility as the annealing temperature increased. The device based on PDTPO as-cast showed a hole mobility of 0.011 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature (Table S1†), while the thin film annealed at 240 °C achieved the best device performance, and the saturation hole mobility extracted from the transfer curve (Fig. 3a) is 0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 104. The one order of magnitude higher mobility of the PDTPO thin film annealed at 240 °C, compared with that of the as-cast thin film, is attributed to the thermally induced molecular reorganization and the changes of molecular packing within the films. The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are displayed in Fig. 4. With the enhanced annealing temperatures, the root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the film was reduced in comparison with that of the as-cast film. When annealed at 240 °C, domains with a more pronounced alignment were formed with a small rms of 2.32 nm compared to the featureless as-cast film with a rms of 6.00 nm, which are favorable for efficient charge transport.46 Noticeably, all the electrical characteristics of these OFET devices were measured in ambient air. The high stability of these devices may be attributed to the deep HOMO levels of the polymer derived from the electron-deficient fused amide moiety.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers were initially investigated with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (80 nm)/PFN (5 nm)/Al (see Fig. S5a†), where ITO is the anode, PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) serves as the hole transporting layer, PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) acts as the electron acceptor, PFN (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) serves as the electron-collecting layer, and Al is the cathode. The optimal weight ratio of polymer:PC71BM was 1:2. The active layers were spin-coated from a o-DCB solution of the mixture of the donor and acceptor, and 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a processing additive to optimize the nanoscale morphology. PSCs without the PFN electron-collecting layer were also fabricated for comparison. Moreover, the active layers were modified by solvent annealing before spin-coating the PFN layer to optimize the device performances. Fig. 5a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs fabricated under various conditions, and the key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

In the absence of PFN, the PSCs based on the blend polymer:PC71BM exhibited moderate performance with a PCE of 4.28% for PDTPO-BDTO and 4.74% for PDTPO-BDTT. When PFN was used as the electron-collecting layer, the enhancement of Voc and FF was remarkable, consequently the PCEs of the PSCs were increased to 5.7% for PDTPO-BDTO and 6.45% for PDTPO-BDTT. In order to optimize the performance, a solvent annealing method was applied to the films. It was found that when the solvent (tetrahydrofuran, THF) annealing time was 30 s, both the two devices obtained the best results. Along with a small increase of FF, the PCEs of the PSCs were further improved to 6.19% for PDTPO-BDTO and 6.84% for PDTPO-BDTT, respectively. However, when the solvent annealing time was longer (60 s), the performance of the two devices degraded, and the corresponding PCEs of the PSCs declined to 5.34% for PDTPO-BDTO and 6.37% for PDTPO-BDTT, respectively. It is noteworthy that the relatively higher Vocs of ca. 0.85–0.98 V of the devices agree with their low-lying HOMO levels, which are ca. 0.25–0.38 V higher than that of the device based on P3HT:PC71BM.47 The hole mobilities of the two copolymers (PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT) measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC, shown in Fig. S7†) method were 1.25 × 10−4 and 1.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively high hole mobility may account for the high Jsc and FF (Table 2).48 The incident-photon-current-efficiencies (IPCEs) of the best devices are shown in Fig. 9a. The two devices showed a substantially high photoresponse with the IPCEs over 60% from 400 to 600 nm. In addition, the mismatch between the integral values and the measured Jsc values is within 5%, indicating the consistency of the photovoltaic results (Table 2).

Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of the energy levels of the materials used in the PSCs. The HOMO level of PDTPO-BDTT is deeper than that of PDTPO-BDTO, which offers a larger driving force for exciton dissociation. And thus a higher Voc over that of PDTPO-BDTO was achieved. In the case of quasi-Fermi levels applied to BHJ,49 ideally, the maximum Voc can be expressed as50 (1)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blend materials, RA/D is the initial separation distance of the generated electron and hole pair under optical excitation. In Table 2, it is clear that the one with PDTPO-BDTT exhibits higher Voc under different fabrication processes compared to the counterpart PDTPO-BDTO. Derived from eqn (1), a smaller RA/D is obtained in the devices based on PDTPO-BDTT (shown in Fig. 7), regardless of any other path of Voc loss. It has been reported that the rate constant for separation into free carriers is inversely proportional to the third power of the initial separation distance of the bound electron and hole pair at the interface.51 Therefore, it is reasonable that PDTPO-BDTT outperforms PDTPO-BDTO with the conventional architecture under the same processing procedures.

The ideality factor could reveal some information on the transport and recombination processes, especially for trap-assisted recombination in PSCs.52 According to the simulation based on the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. S6,† we find that the diode ideality factors of the as-cast devices are much higher than those with additional solvent treatments (shown in Table S2†). We suppose that more trap states exist intrinsically in the as-cast films. For PDTPO-BDTT, the reduced series resistance of the conventional device may account for the enhanced fill factor (FF) after additional treatments. However, it does not apply to PDTPO-BDTO as both the series and parallel (shunt) resistances of the device affect the FF.53
We further optimized the performances of the two copolymers by using an inverted device geometry, which typically demonstrates superior ambient stability to the conventional devices due to the avoidance of the corrosive hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS and the low work function cathode. The device structure is as follows: ITO/PFN (10 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (shown in Fig. S5b†). The J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 8. The photovoltaic results are also listed in Table 2. The inverted device with PDTPO-BDTO exhibited an enhanced performance with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 10.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.70 and a PCE up to 6.84%. It is clear that the enhancement of the PCE is mainly a result of the increased Jsc for PDTPO-BDTO while maintaining the Voc and FF almost the same as those for the conventional device. The significantly increased Jsc might be attributed to the improved interfacial contact, which can lead to a more efficient charge collection and less recombination.54 Noticeably, PDTPO-BDTO demonstrated a high Voc of 0.93 V, which is one of the highest values among the polymers with an optical bandgap of 2.0–2.1 eV (Table 3). However, for PDTPO-BDTT, the device suffered from slight decreases of both Voc and FF compared to the conventional devices with additional treatments, resulting in a PCE of 6.61%, a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.68 (Table 2). The slightly lower PCE of the device with PDTPO-BDTT, compared to the one with PDTPO-BDTO, may be due to the lower FF. We suspect that the variation of the distribution of the optical field in the devices with different materials, i.e., different optical constants, also accounts for the small difference of the PCEs between the two inverted devices.55 In addition, the Voc of the PDTPO-BDTT device (0.94 V) is slightly higher than that of the PDTPO-BDTO device (0.93 V), which is consistent with the conclusion of the Vocs in the conventional devices derived from eqn (1). The IPCEs of the inverted devices are shown in Fig. 9b. The two devices showed a substantially high photoresponse with the IPCEs over 60% from 400 to 600 nm, and the mismatch between the integral values and the measured Jsc values is within 4% (Table 2).

 Fig. 9  The IPCE spectra of the devices with different configurations. (a) Conventional and (b) inverted. 
We measured the device stability in air without any encapsulation (Fig. 10 and S8†), and the results are summarized in Table S4 and S5.† As shown in Fig. 10, the PCEs of the conventional devices decreased more quickly than those of the inverted devices. The Vocs, Jscs and FFs of the conventional devices were deteriorated after being exposed to air for 120 h, leading to the obvious decline of the PCEs (Fig. S8† and 10). The PDTPO-BDTT-based inverted device showed much better stability than the PDTPO-BDTO-based inverted device. Noticeably, the PCE of the PDTPO-BDTT-based inverted cell remained above 90% of the original value even after storage in air for 200 h with the Voc unchanged and the variations of the Jsc and FF within 5%.
 Fig. 10  Stability curves of the PDTPO-BDTO and PDTPO-BDTT devices versus storage time in air. 
It is noteworthy that the PDTPO-BDTO has a wide optical bandgap of 2.02 eV, and the optimized PSC device achieved a high PCE of 6.84%, which is one of the highest PCEs among the wide bandgap polymer based devices ever reported (Table 3), indicating the good potential of PDTPO-BDTO for boosting the PCE of the PSCs with a ternary blend layer or tandem structures.61
Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a new electron donor, 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTPO), and a series of its polymers. Its homopolymer revealed a high hole mobility of 0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs, indicating that DTPO is a promising building unit for organic semiconductor materials. Its copolymers with benzodithiophenes (BDTO and BDTT) show wide optical bandgaps of ∼2.0 eV and deep HOMO levels of ca. −5.40 eV. A high PCE of 6.84% has been achieved by both PDTPO-BDTO (with the inverted device structure) and PDTPO-BDTT (with the conventional device structure). The performances are among the highest ones attained by using the conjugated copolymers with wide bandgaps of 1.95–2.02 eV. We reveal that PDTPO-BDTT is superior in conventional device performance over PDTPO-BDTT as a result of faster exciton separation into free charge carriers and larger driving force for exciton dissociation, which results in high short-circuit current and Voc, respectively. We believe that the wide optical bandgaps and the excellent device performances make these polymers promising candidates as wide bandgap materials for tandem solar cells or ternary solar cells.

Instruments and measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a MERCURY-VX300 spectrometer. The elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen was performed on a Vario EL-III microanalyzer. EI-MS spectra were recorded on a VJ-ZAB-3F-mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perkin Elmer Pyris under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperature of degradation (Td) was correlated with a 5% weight loss. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2500 recording spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI voltammetric analyzer at room temperature. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The conventional three-electrode configuration consists of a platinum working electrode with a 2 mm diameter, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl wire reference electrode. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The potentials were determined using ferrocene as the reference. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out on a Waters 2690 D system using a refractive detector and THF as the eluent. The tapping-mode AFM images were obtained by using a Nanoscope V instrument.
OFET fabrication and characterization
The OFETs were fabricated in a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration (gold electrode on Si/SiO2 substrates). The gold source-drain electrodes were prepared by a photolithography technique to control the channel length (L) and channel width (W = 1400 μm). Before the deposition of polymer semiconductors, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment was performed on the gate dielectrics which were placed in a vacuum oven with OTS to form an OTS self-assembled monolayer. Then the polymer was spin-coated on the OTS-modified SiO2/Si substrates from the solution of hot o-dichlorobenzene (5 mg mL−1) at a speed of 2500 rpm for 60 s. The OFETs were annealed on a hot plate for 5 min in air directly and measured in air by using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. The mobility of the devices was calculated in the saturation regime. The equation is listed as follows: IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VGS − Vth)2, where W/L is the channel width/length, Ci is the insulator capacitance per unit area, μ is the mobility and VGS and Vth are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
The conventional device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM(1:2)/PFN(5 nm)/Al, and the inverted device structure was ITO/PFN(10 nm)/polymer:PC71BM(1:2)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al. After being cleaned in an ultrasonic bath by acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol sequentially, the ITO-coated glass substrates were treated by oxygen plasma cleaning for 4 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO with 40 nm thickness, and then the substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 15 min under air conditions. For inverted devices, the PFN interlayer was spin-coated on top of the precleaned ITO substrate. The polymer:PC71BM active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼80 nm, was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of o-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume) solution (concentration, 15 mg mL−1) at 1000 rpm for 2 min. For conventional devices, the active layer was solvent annealed with THF for 30 s or 60 s before spin coating the PFN layer. After the deposition of the PFN thin layer (5 nm), the Al layer was vacuum evaporated through a shadow mask to form the top cathode. For inverted devices, a 10 nm MoO3 layer and a 100 nm Al layer were subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to form the top anode. The active area of the devices is 0.16 cm2 for both conventional and inverted devices. The current–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were conducted using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter controlled by a computer. And characterization was carried out in a glovebox under a simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-40S1 150W AAA). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was carried out by using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech, Taiwan) combined with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated by using one standard Si/Ge solar cell. Notably, the IPCE was measured in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The hole mobility was measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The SCLC is described as (2)where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential of the device, and L is the active layer thickness. The internal potential V is obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the series resistance of the substrate, from the applied voltage (Vappl), according to V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs.
