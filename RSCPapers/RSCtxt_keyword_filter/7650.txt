    , Accepted 10th October 2011First published on 25th October 2011AbstractThe synthesis of the novel electron-rich pyrroloindacenodithiophene (NIDT) unit is reported. Stille copolymerization of the distannylated NIDT unit, with the electron-deficient dibrominated benzothiadiazole (BT), difluorobenzothiadiazole (ffBT), thienopyrrolodione (TPD) and 1,1′-bithienopyrrolodione (biTPD) units afforded a series of low band gap semiconducting polymers. Initial testing shows promise for the use of these materials as p-type semiconductors in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with mobilities as high as 0.07 cm2V−1s−1 being measured. These materials have also been tested as the donor polymer in polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) giving maximum efficiencies of 2.5%.
Introduction
Over the past few decades π-conjugated polymer semiconductors have attracted a lot of attention for use in electronic applications, as a low cost alternative to inorganic semiconducting materials. They enable the fabrication of lightweight, flexible organic field effect transistor (OFET) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices by solution processing techniques. Recent advances in polymer synthesis and device fabrication have led to mobilities as high as ∼3 cm2V−1s−1 and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) above 7% for OFET and OPV devices, respectively.1–5
Recently, we have demonstrated that indacenodithiophene is a versatile conjugated unit when copolymerized with appropriate monomers, enabling high performing field effect transistors and solar cells.6,7 With its rigid, planar, conjugated structure, conformational disorder is minimized, which contributes to high charge carrier mobility, whereas the electron rich nature of the peripheral thiophene units facilitates molecular orbital hybridization with electron poor co-monomers, leading to low band gap absorbers. The thiophene links along the backbone promote coplanarity of adjacent aromatic units, enhancing π-conjugation and intermolecular π-stacking, whereas the bridging heteroatoms both offer a centre for solubilizing functionality, and a versatile position to fine-tune the molecular orbital energy levels. For example, polymers employing the carbon bridged unit poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (PIDT-BT) exhibited very high hole mobilities (∼1 cm2V−1s−1) when tested in OFET devices.7 The silicon bridging analogue poly(silaindacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (PSiIDT-BT) showed reduced mobility in OFETs but a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼4% in solar cell devices, with a larger open circuit voltage (Voc) than the carbon bridged polymer, due to the contribution of the silicon to lower the HOMO energy level.6 Replacing the bridging heteroatom with the more electron donating nitrogen atom would further promote molecular orbital hybridization leading to lower bandgaps, whereas the electron rich nature of the backbone should promote good hole transport. For these reasons, the synthesis of the novel pyrroloindacenodithiophene (NIDT) unit was realized.
High charge carrier mobility is important not only in organic transistors, but can be beneficial in OPVs as this should increase both the fill factor, and also the Jsc. Unfortunately, the Voc would be expected to be slightly reduced as the introduction of a more electron rich donor unit would be likely to raise the HOMO level of the donor polymer.8
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The structure and synthesis of the novel NIDT unit is shown in Scheme 1. Ogawaet al. report on the structure of dithienopyrrole.9 X-ray data indicates that the nitrogen in the pyrrole moiety is sp2 hybridized, with the first carbon of the alkyl substituent in the plane of the molecule. The lone pair of the nitrogen donates into the conjugated π-system, thus contributing to the electron density of the ring.9 It is expected that the pyrrole moieties of the NIDT unit will exhibit sp2 hybridized bridging nitrogens leading to a fully aromatic molecule, unlike the C and Si analogues. To support this, the structure was modelled and compared to the carbon analogue (IDT) using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The calculated energy-minimised conformations of NIDT and IDT are shown in Fig. 1 and it is clear that the bridging atoms are sp2 hybridised for NIDT, with a resultant in-plane bond between the ring nitrogen and the aliphatic carbon, and sp3 hybridised for IDT. The difference in aromaticity is further evidenced by the HOMO distributions of the two structures (Fig. 1). Whereas the lone pair of the nitrogen in NIDT is clearly delocalised over the entire planar backbone, the HOMO of IDT has nodal planes that intersect the bridging carbon atoms, limiting the delocalisation. The first carbon in the alkyl chain is therefore likely to be in the plane of the molecule, rather than out of the plane as observed in the case of IDT and SiIDT. The rest of the alkyl chain is free to rotate but strong π interactions could force it in to the plane reducing the π–π stacking distance between chains, therefore increasing interchain charge transfer and promoting molecular order. The alkyl functionality on the bridging nitrogen was required to be long and branched to enable the resulting polymer to be soluble at higher molecular weights. It has been shown in a number of studies that an increase in molecular weight will lead to an improvement in the polymers performance in both OFET and OPV devices.1,10–13

The structures of the polymers are shown in Scheme 2. Four acceptor units were chosen for copolymerization. The electron poor benzothiadiazole (BT) unit facilitates molecular orbital hybridization with the electron rich NIDT unit, leading to a low band gap polymer which is desirable for efficient solar light harvesting. The orthogonal dipole from the benzothiadiazole unit, in combination with electron rich co-repeat units have also been shown to enhance π-stacking, leading to materials with very high hole mobilities in OFET devices.7 The difluorobenzothiadiazole (ffBT) unit with the addition of electron withdrawing fluorine groups attached to the phenyl ring makes this monomer even more electron deficient than BT, whereas the fluorine-sulphur short contacts have been shown to enhance coplanarity between coupled units, thus improving π-delocalization.4,14 This was expected to improve hole mobility in OFET devices.

The thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit has been chosen because of its solubilizing influence on the polymer, due to the alkyl functionality on the nitrogen, and the relatively strong electron withdrawing effect due to the presence of the imide group.8 This will encourage electronic orbital hybridisation, leading to a low band gap polymer. A linear alkyl chain on the pyrrolidione was required in this case to promote crystallinity and therefore good charge transport. These units have also previously shown promise in OPVs.3,8,15–17 The 1,1′-bithienopyrrolodione (biTPD) unit has previously been shown to lower the LUMO level of a polymer significantly in comparison to TPD. The HOMO level of the polymer is also slightly lowered which is expected to lead to an increase in Voc, while the reduced band gap would improve photon absorption. This monomer was therefore attractive in order to lower the HOMO and improve Voc of photovoltaic devices.18
The unsubstituted NIDT monomer was synthesized using the same conditions for the synthesis of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole.19 The double Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction was carried out on the 2,2′-(2,5-dibromo-1,4-phenylene)bis(3-bromothiophene) as shown in Scheme 1. The product was isolated with a 40% overall yield. Lithiation of NIDT followed by the addition of trimethylstannyl chloride afforded the distannylated monomer in high yield (Scheme 1). Polymers P1, P2, P3 and P4 were all synthesized via microwave assisted Stille cross-coupling (Scheme 2) of the distannylated NIDT with the appropriate dibrominated acceptor unit. The polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction using acetone, hexane and, finally, chloroform. Each chloroform fraction was concentrated and washed with aqueous sodium diethyldithiocarbamate tetrahydrate to remove any palladium catalyst, then the chloroform fraction was separated and the polymer reprecipitated into methanol. Polymerizations proceeded in high yield producing materials with moderate number-average molecular weights (Mn) for P2, P3 and P4 (Table 1), as measured using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), at 80 °C in chlorobenzene. P1 had low Mn due to its poor solubility which led to the polymer precipitating from solution before higher molecular weights could be reached. For P3 the presence of the linear solubilizing side chain on the pyrrolidione unit did not improve the degree of polymerization (DP) as much as expected. This could be due to steric effects from the imide group which may inhibit the coupling reaction and counteract the increase in solubility. All four polymers are soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene.

Optical properties and energy levels
All four polymers showed long wavelength absorption maxima both in solution and thin film UV-Vis measurements (Fig. 2 and Table 1). P1 developed a pronounced shoulder on the long wavelength side of the absorption maximum, on going from solution to thin film, at around 830 nm which could be indicative of planarization of the backbone and increased π-stacking. For P2 and P3 we did not observe a shoulder suggesting there is little order gained when going from solution to solid state. P4 showed a red shift of 15 nm in its absorption maximum, which could be attributed to solid state packing effects. The correspondingly low band gaps of these polymers (Table 1), estimated from the absorption onset, suggests that these polymers should perform well in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.

As predicted the HOMO level of P1 (Table 1) was raised significantly in comparison to the C and Si analogues which have HOMO levels of −5.4 eV and −5.5 eV respectively,6,7 despite the low molecular weight of P1. Also, the band gap of P1 (1.4 eV) is lower than that observed for the C (1.7 eV) and Si (1.9 eV) analogues.6,7 This confirms our hypothesis that the addition of the electron donating nitrogen group increases molecular orbital hybridization, raising the HOMO and reducing the band gap.
It is evident that the molecular orbital energy levels are also influenced by the acceptor co-monomer present. In order to further understand the electronic properties of the materials, their trimers were modelled using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The side-chain substituents were replaced with methyl groups in order to simplify the calculations, with minimum effect on electronic properties. The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the trimer model are shown in Fig. 3. P1 and P2 show a similar density of states distribution for both the HOMO and LUMO wave functions. The HOMO calculation showed a broad distribution along the backbone, but the LUMO is mainly located on the acceptor part of the molecule for P1 and P2. The fluorine substituents on the co-monomer in P2 should further withdraw electron density from the conjugated system in comparison to P1, and reduce both the HOMO and LUMO levels.4 However, this lowering of the HOMO may be partially counteracted by the planarizing effect caused by the short contact interactions between fluorine and the neighbouring sulphur atom, raising the HOMO and leading to a minimal overall effect on the energy level as seen from the experimental data (Table 1).20 In fact the experimental data shows a 0.1 eV increase in the LUMO level of P2, but this is expected to be a result of standard experimental error associated with the measurement of the HOMO level and band gap from which the LUMO is calculated, and it is likely that the energy levels are very similar. P3 and P4 show the same HOMO distribution across the backbone as observed for P1 and P2, but they differ significantly in terms of the LUMO wave functions. The experimental and calculated data (Table 1) show that the HOMO of P3 is lower than P1. This could be due to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the imide unit. The LUMO of P1 is localized on the BT unit, whereas the LUMO of P3 is delocalized across the backbone. Fig. 3 shows that there is less contribution from the electron withdrawing imide group of the TPD unit into the LUMO, than the thiazole unit of BT. The TPD unit therefore has less of an electron withdrawing influence than BT, leading to a higher lying LUMO (Table 1). For P4, the LUMO shows a high density of states around the acceptor unit (Fig. 3), similar to that observed for P1 and P2, leading to a larger stabilization of the LUMO level with respect to P3. This is due to the higher density of electron withdrawing groups in biTPD and a larger contribution from them to stabilize the LUMO compared to P3. The biTPD unit therefore has the effect of stabilizing the HOMO but at the same time reducing the band gap.18 This is optimal for solar cells as the reduced band gap will increase the solar light harvesting potential and the lower HOMO level will improve the Voc. This effect can be observed from the calculated HOMO and LUMO values but the experimental data shows little effect on the HOMO (Table 1). This could be due to the molecular weight of P4 being much larger than P3, which results in the HOMO being raised, reducing the difference between the HOMO energy levels of P3 and P4,11 or simply due to the experimental error associated with the energy level measurements. It must also be noted that comparison and analysis of the experimental energy levels for P1–P3 is somewhat complicated due to the fact that at low molecular weights the band gap can be molecular weight dependent.11

          OFET properties
To measure the p-type charge carrier mobility bottom-gate, top-contact (BG-TC) architecture OFET devices were fabricated on highly doped p-type Si substrates with SiO2 as the dielectric and n-doped silicon as the common gate. The gold source and drain electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation and the semiconducting polymer was spin-coated from a hot 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution at 1000 rpm, then annealed at 150 °C or 200 °C for 10 min. The annealing temperature had minimal effect on performance as all four polymers are amorphous. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed no transitions or decomposition between 25–300 °C (see Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI)).
The charge carrier mobility was calculated from the transfer characteristics of the device, in the saturation regime, using previously reported procedures.21 The results are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 4 displays a typical transfer curve and the output characteristics obtained from an OFET (channel length (L)/width (W) of 20/1000 μm) at a drain voltage (VD) of −5 V and −60 V, using P2 as the semiconducting layer. This material showed the best transfer and output characteristics with a maximum recorded hole mobility of 0.07 cm2V−1s−1 and a current on/off ratio (Ion/off) of 104. P1 exhibited reasonable mobilities (0.02 cm2V−1s−1) for a device with channel length 200 μm, annealed at 200 °C and displayed an Ion/off of 104. The mobility of P1 is slightly better than that obtained for the Si analogue (8 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1),6 but much less than that obtained for the C bridging version, which had a mobility of ∼1 cm2V−1s−1.7 A reason for the lower mobility of P1 compared to P2 could be due to the improved interchain charge transport of P2 caused by the planarization of the backbone by S-F short contact interactions, thus promoting shorter interchain π-stacking distances, or it could be as a result of the low molecular weight of P1. A higher molecular weight polymer should have a higher mobility.1P3 gave a lower mobility than P1 and P2 (0.01 cm2V−1s−1) with an on/off ratio of 103. The lower mobility is likely to be due to the weaker π-stacking interactions of the TPD units, which reduce molecular order. P4 gave the lowest mobility (0.001 cm2V−1s−1) which was expected as the biTPD unit possesses branched 2-ethylhexyl units which are bulky and suppress π-stacking. The reader is referred to the ESI for the transfer and output characteristics of P1, P3 and P4. All four polymers exhibit hole mobilities which are state of the art for bottom gate architecture and within the desirable range for OPV applications.

The morphology of the blended films (Polymer (P1–P4): PC71BM (1: 3 w/w)) was also studied by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 6 shows the AFM images of the blended films, cast from the polymer solutions in o-dichlorobenzene.

The device with P2:PC71BM blend demonstrated a higher Voc value compared to P1:PC71BM, but the overall performance of both materials remains similar. The AFM images of the blend of P1 and P2 with PC71BM feature large domains. The greater phase segregation and rougher surfaces of the P1 and P2 blends presumably arose because of poor miscibility with PC71BM.
These large domain sizes hinder exciton dissociation and charge transport in these devices. P3 and P4 performed better than P1 and P2, attributed to the larger Voc originating from the lower HOMO energy levels of the polymers. The Jsc values of P3 and P4 based devices were almost similar. P4 exhibited higher Voc and FF value than that of P3, resulting in the improved power conversion efficiency of 2.5%. Although the experimental HOMO levels are the same for P3 and P4, possibly due to experimental error, the calculated values are in agreement with the increase in Voc observed for P4. It has also been shown, in the case of P3HT, that an increase in molecular weight can have a positive impact on Jsc, Voc, FF and therefore PCE.11,13 These reasons can help explain why we observe this increase in Voc. The performance of the polymers in the OPV devices can be molecular weight dependent. Thus, the better performance of P4 can also be attributed to its high molecular weight compared to P1–P3. Also, the AFM images clearly reveal that the P4 blend was more homogeneous and smoother than the other three polymers, with the lowest root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.44 nm. This improved blend morphology can help explain why P4 has a much improved PCE.8,22–24
As expected, the replacement of acceptor units from BT (or ffBT) to TPD (or biTPD) led to higher Voc in these devices, which significantly improved device performance.

Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best device as a function of wavelength, which is consistent with the copolymers UV–Vis absorption spectra, indicating that all the absorption of the polymers contributed to the photovoltaic conversion. These devices exhibited significantly broad EQE responses extending from the visible to the NIR, with a maximum intensity ranging between 400 and 500 nm. We attribute the higher EQE responses in the visible region to the corresponding higher absorbance of the blend, resulting from both the intrinsic absorption of the polymer and the presence of a high content of PC71BM, which also absorbs significantly at 400–500 nm. In contrast, these devices displayed relatively lower EQE responses at wavelengths above 650 nm because of the moderate absorbance of the polymer. The device of P4 blend exhibited a higher EQE response than that of other polymer blends, with a maximum of 28% at 490 nm, corresponding to its higher photocurrent.
We speculate that the lower power conversion efficiencies of these polymers in bulk heterojunction devices are most likely due to the limited molecular weights and sub-optimal phase separation within the blends, as demonstrated by the large polymer/PC71BM aggregates in the P1 and P2 blends.
Further experiments to improve the device performance of these polymers are under way. The use of additives or co-solvents also is known to impact the blend morphology which can result in better performance.3,17,22

Four novel semiconducting polymers have been synthesized viaStille coupling polymerization, in high yields but with moderate-low molecular weights. All four polymers exhibited long wavelength absorptions, with corresponding low band gaps. They have been employed, as the hole conducting layer, in solution processed OFET devices. P2 exhibited the highest hole mobility (0.07 cm2V−1s−1). The photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated using the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer(P1–P4):PC71BM/Ca/Al. P4 performed best, achieving a PCE of 2.5%, with the highest Jsc, Voc and FF. The performances of P1 and P2 were limited by the high HOMO levels of the polymers leading to low Voc. The efficiency of the devices were also affected by the blend morphologies, with the most homogeneous blend giving the best results (P4:PC71BM). We have also shown that replacing the bridging atom of the IDT unit with nitrogen has a significant effect on the molecular orbitals, leading to a more planar, fully aromatic molecule.
Experimental section

          OFET device fabrication
Bottom-gate, top-contact devices were fabricated on highly doped p-type Si with 400 nm SiO2 dielectric layer. Si/SiO2 was treated with OTS or HMDS depending on the wettability of each polymer. For source and drain electrodes, 60 nm Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation. Polymer films were spin cast from hot 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution (5 mg mL−1) at 1000 rpm and annealed at 150 °C or 200 °C for 10 min. All procedures/measurements were carried out in a dry nitrogen filled glove box.
OPV device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying and oxygen plasma treatment. A 30 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) was spin-coated onto the plasma-treated ITO substrate and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. An active layer consisting of 1:3 blend of polymer (10 mg mL−1) and PC71BM (30 mg mL−1, Solenne) dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer and then Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm) cathode was finally deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask. The pixel size, defined by the spatial overlap of the ITO anode and Ca/Al cathode, was 0.045 cm2. The device characteristics were obtained using a xenon lamp at AM1.5 solar illumination (Oriel Instruments). AFM was carried out using an Agilent 5500 Atomic Force Microscope and post-processing Pico Image software.

Unless otherwise stated, all reactions were conducted under nitrogen, using a nitrogen filled dual manifold and standard Schlenk line techniques. All solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received, unless otherwise stated. Where required, toluene and THF were dried by distillation from Na-benzophenone. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Av-400 (400 MHz) instrument and 13C NMR were measured on a Bruker Av-400 (100 MHz). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm, relative to the residual protons in the deuterated solvents. All spectra were analysed using MestreNova software, from MestreLab. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a UV-1601 Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometer. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with a Thermo Electron Corporation DSQII mass spectrometer. Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass Autospec Premier instrument. Photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements were made using a Riken Keiki AC-II at CSIRO Materials Science and Engineering. Elemental Analyses were determined by Mr. Stephen Boyer at London Metropolitan University, North Campus, Holloway Road, London, N7 8BD. GPC data was collected using an Agilent Technologies 1200 series instrument, with two mixed B columns, in series, and using chlorobenzene as the eluent, at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The instrument was calibrated using narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. Flash column chromatography was performed on Merck Kieselgel 60 (230–400 mesh) silica. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated 0.25 mm thick Merck 5715 Kieselgel 60 F254silica gel plates and observed under 254 nm or 366 nm ultraviolet light.

A dry Schlenk tube was charged with 2,2′-(2,5-dibromo-1,4-phenylene)bis(3-bromothiophene) (1.10 g, 1.97 mmol), Pd2dba3 (90 mg, 98.5 μmol), BINAP (245 mg, 0.39 mmol) and NaOtBu (1.01 g, 10.48 mmol). Three consecutive vacuum/nitrogen cycles were carried out on the contents of the Schlenk tube, before adding 2-octyl-1-dodecylamine (1.29 g, 4.33 mmol) and dry toluene (40 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool, then water (20 mL) was added and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic fractions were washed with brine (200 mL) and dried (MgSO4). The volatiles were removed in vacuo to give a crude brown solid. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel, 0–5% CH2Cl2/Hexane) yielded a mixture of monoring-closed and mono-aminated product as a colourless oil (915 mg).
This mixture (910 mg) was placed in a Schlenk tube, along with Pd2dba3 (45 mg, 0.05 mmol), BINAP (122 mg, 0.20 mmol) and NaOtBu (586 mg, 6.1 mmol). Three consecutive vacuum/nitrogen cycles were carried out on the contents of the Schlenk tube, before adding 2-octyl-1-dodecylamine (361 mg, 1.22 mmol) and dry toluene (40 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C and monitored using TLC. Once the reaction had reached completion (20 h) the reaction mixture was allowed to cool, then water (20 mL) was added and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The combined organics were washed with brine (200 mL) and dried (MgSO4). The volatiles were removed in vacuo to give a crude brown solid. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel, 0–5% CH2Cl2/hexane) yielded the title compound (638 mg, 40% overall yield) as a pale yellow solid; (found: C, 78.28; H, 10.78; N, 3.28.

A dry Schlenk tube was charged with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]bis(4-(2-octyl-1-dodecyl)-4H-amino[3,2-b]thiophene) (630 mg, 0.75 mmol) and dissolved in dry THF (10 mL). The solution was cooled to −40 °C with an acetonitrile/dry ice bath, then nBuLi (1.6 mL, 2.56 mmol, 1.6 M solution in hexanes) was added, dropwise, to the flask. Once the addition was complete, the solution was left to stir for a further 2 h at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was cooled back to −40 °C and trimethyltin chloride (3 mL, 3 mmol, 1 M solution in THF) was added in one portion. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature, overnight. The reaction was quenched with water (10 mL) and hexane (20 mL) was added. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer and washed with water (4 × 20 mL). The organic layer was then dried (MgSO4) and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The yellow oil was dried under high vacuum for 8 h, then placed in the freezer to give a yellow solid (950 mg, 97%).
