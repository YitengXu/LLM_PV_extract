    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractThree isomeric acceptors FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 incorporating the fluorene center are designed and synthesized. FOM-1 and FOM-2 show C-shaped structures with two methoxy groups substituted on the different positions of the fluorene units, while FOM-3 adopts an S-shaped structure with the methoxy groups substituted on the asymmetric position of the fluorene ring. The effects of the molecular symmetry, the substituted positions of the methoxy groups on the photoelectric properties, and the molecular packing have been investigated. Organic solar cells based on the three acceptors demonstrate promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.34%, 15.10% and 15.02% for FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3, respectively.
1. Introduction
As one of the promising green energy technologies, organic solar cells (OSCs) have received tremendous attention due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and roll-to-roll manufacturing capability.1–13 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been frequently refreshed and have reached exciting values of over 19%.14–17 These remarkable results are mainly attributed to the design of new and excellent active-layer materials, together with a deep understanding of the OSC mechanism and device optimization. Among the various active-layer materials, molecules with the architecture of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) have demonstrated excellent device performances and have become the most successful material systems in the past decade.18–20 Particularly, due to their efficient tuning for absorption and meritorious energy levels, molecular packing and morphology, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with A–D–A structures, e.g. ITIC, Y6 and their derivatives, have made significant progress in boosting the efficiencies of OSCs to the present exciting levels.21–24 In view of their excellent properties, a great number of NFAs with the A–D–A architecture have been designed and the correlation between their molecular structures and physical and device properties has been investigated in recent years. It is strongly believed that there still remains much room for improving OSC performance via delicate molecular design and device optimization according to theoretical predictions.25–30 It has been found that the molecular symmetry and isomeric effect can significantly affect the solubility, packing, dipole moment, optical and electronic properties of materials.31–37 For example, Zhan and coworkers have designed and synthesized a series of NOIC acceptors, which share similar fused-ring cores and show a great difference in molecular packing, optical and electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology and performance of OSCs.38 Alex and coworkers reported the two isomers of BP6T-4F and ABP6T-4F. The asymmetric isomer of ABP6T-4F exhibits better OSC performance than BP6T-4F.39 Their results indicate that a deep understanding of the isomeric effects is valuable for the design of high-performance NFAs.
In our previous work, we designed a series of A–D–A-type acceptors such as F-H, F-M, FO-2F, FO-2Cl and their derivatives incorporating the fluorene central cores, and PCEs over 15% and 18% have been achieved for single-junction and tandem devices based on those acceptors, respectively.40–45 Among them, acceptors such as FO-2Cl, incorporating the fluorene center and inserting oxygen in the molecular backbone, show an extended absorption range around 900 nm and demonstrate much potential to boost high efficiencies via careful molecular modification. For example, just recently, we reported an acceptor FO-EH-2Cl, which has different alkyl chains on the fluorene unit compared with FO-2Cl, achieving a PCE of 15.78% for all small-molecule OSCs.46 With the above analysis in mind, in this work, we design and synthesize three isomeric acceptors FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3. As shown in Fig. 1, FOM-1 and FOM-2 show C-shaped structures with the two methoxy groups substituted on different positions of the fluorene units. In contrast, FOM-3 adopts an S-shaped structure. When blended with the polymer donor PM6, the FOM-1-based cell yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.34%, while the FOM-2 and FOM-3-based cells both yield PCEs of over 15%. It is worth noting that FOM-2 and FOM-3 are some of the only acceptors with PCEs over 15% reported to date, except for Y6 derivatives.47–49

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and optoelectronic properties
The synthetic routes of FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 are shown in Scheme 1. Starting from methyl-2-bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzoate and 2-bromo-4,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, we synthesized 3,4,5,6-tetramethoxy-9,9-dioctyl-9-one (1) and 1,3,6,8-tetramethoxy-9,9-dioctyl-9-one (7) through similar routes. Note that the two isomer intermediates 10 and 11 were synthesized in one ring-closing step simultaneously and separated by column chromatography with yields of 62% and 21%, respectively. Finally, the targeted products FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 were obtained through Knoevenagel condensation. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations are provided in the ESI.†

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 in thin-films are provided in Fig. 1b, and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. In chloroform, FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 exhibited similar absorption with maximum absorption peaks around 680 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). From the solution to the film state, the three acceptors all showed red-shifted absorptions, especially FOM-1, with the largest red shift of 81 nm. The optical bandgaps of FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 calculated from the onset of the solid films are 1.49 eV, 1.54 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the energy levels of the three acceptors. From the onset of the oxidative and reductive peaks of the CV curves (Fig. S2, ESI†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 are calculated and summarized in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO of FOM-1, FOM-2, FOM-3 are −5.85/−3.94 eV, −5.85/−3.92 eV, and −5.79/−3.85 eV, respectively. Clearly, FOM-1 and FOM-2 show similar HOMO/LUMO values, indicating that the methoxy group substitution positions have little effect on the molecular energy levels. In contrast, due to the different molecular backbone and symmetry structure, FOM-3 exhibits upshifted HOMO and downshifted LUMO compared with the other two acceptors.

2.2. Photovoltaic performance
Inverted OPV devices based on ITO/ZnO/NMA/active layer/MoOx/Ag were constructed and optimized to evaluate the photovoltaic properties using FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3 as acceptors, where NMA is 2-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-6,7-dicarboxylic acid.50 The wide bandgap polymer PM6 was selected as a donor due to its intense absorption and suitable energy levels that matched with the acceptors. The device optimization details, such as donor/acceptor weight ratio and thermal annealing temperature, are summarized in Tables S1–S12 (ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are illustrated in Fig. 1d, and the related photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the optimized PM6:FOM-1-based cell exhibits a PCE of 14.34%, with a Voc of 0.864 V, a Jsc of 22.16 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.88%. The optimized PM6:FOM-2-based cell exhibits a PCE of 15.10%, with a Voc of 0.904 V, a Jsc of 21.83 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.59%. For PM6:FOM-3, the optimized device shows a PCE of 15.02%, with a Voc of 0.939 V, a Jsc of 21.06 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.98%. It is worth noting that the two devices of PM6:FOM-2 and PM6:FOM-3 are among the only cases with PCEs over 15%, other than Y6 and its derivative-based devices.47–49

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PM6:FOM-based devices are shown in Fig. 1e. All three devices have high EQE values in their absorption ranges. The PM6:FOM-2-based cell achieves the highest EQE value of 87% at 550 nm, which is higher than that of the PM6:FOM-1-based device (86% at 550 nm) and PM6:FOM-3-based device (84% at 550 nm). The integrated Jsc values of the PM6:FOM devices determined from the EQE curves are 21.40, 20.92 and 19.95 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc measured in the J–V curves.

loss analysis
To understand the different Voc values of the three acceptor-based devices, we have conducted energy loss (Eloss) analysis following literature methods.51 The total Eloss consists of nonradiative recombination loss (ΔE3) and radiative recombination loss, in which the radiative recombination loss can be further divided into the energy loss from absorption above the band gap (ΔE1) and energy loss from the absorption below the band gap (ΔE2). The total Eloss can be calculated from the formula in the ESI.† In this work, the Egap was calculated from the cross point between the UV-Vis absorption spectra and the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat FOM series films as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As summarized in Table 3, the three OSC devices have nearly the same ΔE1, which is unavoidable for any type of solar cell and are in the general value range of 0.25–0.3 eV for OSCs. The three devices show small ΔE2 values below 0.1 eV. Since ΔE1 is unavoidable and ΔE2 is generally smaller than 0.10 eV for the current NFA-based OSCs, ΔE3 plays a critical role in the total Eloss, which can be calculated from the EQE of electroluminescence (EQEEL) following the equation of ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL). Herein, compared with FOM-1, the FOM-2 and FOM-3-based devices show significantly smaller ΔE3 values of 0.342 and 0.324 eV, respectively, similar to those determined from the sensitive EQE measurements (Table 3). The FOM-3-based device showed the lowest Eloss owing to its smallest ΔE3. These results indicate that side-chain substitution and molecular configurations can significantly influence the device Eloss. The case of the three isomers can give some insight into the design of molecules with lower Eloss.

2.4. Charge transport, exciton dissociation and charge generation
As shown in Fig. 2c, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) was measured to study the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties. Herein, Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under the illuminated and dark conditions, respectively.52Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external bias voltage. The value of Pdiss (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density) represents the charge dissociation and collection probability. At Veff > 2 V, the Jph of all the devices approached saturation (Jsat), signifying complete exciton dissociation and charge collection. The Pdiss values for the FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3-based OSCs were calculated to be 94.24%, 95.30% and 94.47%, respectively, indicating that the PM6:FOM-2-based device offers more efficient exciton dissociation.
 Fig. 2  Photovoltaic performance of optimal OSCs based on the PM6:FOM series: (a) Vocversus light intensity. (b) Jscversus light intensity. (c) Jphversus Veff. 
To study the charge recombination in the devices, the light-intensity dependence (P) of Jsc was measured and is shown in Fig. 2b. The dependence of Jsc on Plight follows the power law equation: Jsc ∝ Pα, where α reflects the degree of bimolecular recombination in bulk.53 As shown in Fig. 2b, the α values of the PM6:FOM-based devices are found to be 96.36%, 97.38%, and 97.09%, respectively. The α values being close to unity indicates the low extent of bimolecular recombination and efficient charge collection of the three devices, among which the PM6:FOM-2-based device showed the best performance. In addition, the semi-logarithmic plots of Plight-dependent Voc for the three devices are illustrated in Fig. 2a, where a slope >kT/q indicates the existence of trap-assisted charge recombination (k, T, and q denote the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary charge, respectively). The fitted slopes of the FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3-based devices are 1.24 kT/q, 1.22 kT/q and 1.23 kT/q, respectively. This suggests that the predominant charge recombination is bimolecular recombination, and the PM6:FOM-2-based device suffers from a lower extent of trap-assisted recombination than the other two devices. The smaller slope indicates weak trap-assisted recombination, which suggests that the FOM-2-based OSCs possess less trap-assisted recombination, resulting in a higher level of FF and Jsc. From the perspective of exciton dissociation, bimolecular recombination, trap-assisted charge recombination and charge transfer, the most positive effects on the device working process occurred for the FOM-2-based device.
2.5. Morphology analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the morphology of the PM6:FOM blend films. In the AFM images (Fig. 3), the three blend films all display finely dispersed phase separation with low root-mean-square surface roughness values of 1.24, 1.05 and 1.14 nm, respectively. GIWAXS was employed to investigate the molecular stacking behaviors of the three acceptors and their blend films with PM6 (Fig. 4). In the neat films, FOM-1 and FOM-3 show strong π–π stacking diffraction peaks (010) in the out-of-plane direction, indicating their preferred face-on orientations. Meanwhile, FOM-2 shows a π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) in the in-plane direction, demonstrating its preferred edge-on orientation. For FOM-1 and FOM2, a slight change in the molecular structures can significantly influence their molecular packing mode, indicating the importance of the isomeric effect for new molecule design. An edge-on orientation is not favorable for charge transport in the vertical direction in the devices. Fortunately, after blending with PM6, all the films of the three acceptors showed clear face-on orientations. Among the three blend films, PM6:FOM-2 shows a suitable CCL (010) with a value of 28.95 Å compared with that of PM6:FOM-1 (31.07 Å) and PM6:FOM-3 (24.16 Å), which is consistent with the TEM images shown in Fig. 3f–i. In addition, PM6:FOM-2 has closer π–π stacking (3.49 Å) than the other two acceptor-based films, with the distance of 3.54 Å for PM6:FOM-1 and 3.63 Å for PM6:FOM-3. The above results are consistent with the better photovoltaic performance of the PM6:FOM-2-based device.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized three isomeric acceptors FOM-1, FOM-2 and FOM-3, which have the same end groups and side chains as well as similar fused-ring cores but different molecular packing, light absorption and energy levels. After blending with PM6, the OSC device based on FOM-2 demonstrated the best PCE of 15.10%, which is ascribed to the most efficient exciton dissociation and the lowest bimolecular and trap-assisted charge recombination. Meanwhile, the PM6:FOM-3-based OSC possesses the lowest Eloss among the three devices and achieved a PCE of 15.02% with a high Voc of 0.939 V. These results highlight the impact of the molecular structure modification of acceptors on OSC devices. FOM-2 and FOM-3 are some of the only cases with PCEs over 15%, other than Y6 derivatives. It is believed that higher efficiency molecules can be designed via careful molecular structure modifications such as isomerism, symmetry, and side chains.
