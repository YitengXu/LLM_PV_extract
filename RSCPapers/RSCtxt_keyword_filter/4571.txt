    , Accepted 19th March 2013First published on 19th March 2013AbstractA novel conjugated side-chain polymer (PBDT-TID), based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and isoindigo (ID) moieties, was designed and synthesized. The new polymer exhibited excellent microphase separation in active layers. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells fabricated from PBDT-TID and PC61BM showed promising power conversion efficiencies of 5.25% and 6.51% using conventional and inverted device structures, respectively.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn widespread attention of physical, material and chemical scientists, due to their low cost, light weight, solution processability and potential application in large areas.1–5 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs have a sandwiched structure with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of electron donor and acceptor materials; this is the most successful device structure and the most widely used so far.1,6,7 Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is already around 7% in the conventional device configuration, further optimisation of many factors is needed to achieve better performance.8–10 Compared to the conventional PSCs, the inverted PSCs have significant improvements in long-term ambient stability, leading to PCEs higher than 8%.3,11,12 Clearly, both a rational design of molecule structures and optimisation of device physics play a crucial role in the development of highly efficient PSCs.
Among high performance conjugated D–A polymer photovoltaic materials, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely investigated and used as a donor unit, which is attributed to its symmetric and planar conjugated structure.13,14 Due to its lactam rings and a large optical transition dipole moment, isoindigo (ID) has been reported and investigated as an electron-deficient unit for application in organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.15,16 Many of the main chain polymers with a BDT unit or its derivatives as the donor units have shown great success in achieving high performance PSCs by using different electron-deficient units, such as isoindigo (ID),17,18 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (DTBT),19 thienopyrroledione,20 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).21 According to several research groups and our previous studies, a new family of polymers with conjugated side chains has successfully been developed in the past several years.22–26 Herein, taking into consideration the merits of BDT and ID moieties, for the first time the ID unit is introduced into the conjugated side chain followed by copolymerization with the BDT-based main chain to produce a novel polymer PBDT-TID (Scheme 1) for BHJ solar cells, in which the ID units were linked to the main chain by the 2-vinylthiophenyl unit.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PBDT-TID. Reagents and conditions: (a) (i) toluene, Pd(PPh3)4, 48 h; (ii) HCl, H2O. (b) THF, t-BuOK, ambient temp. 12 h; (c) toluene, Pd(PPh3)4, 48 h. 
The synthesis of the monomer and the polymer is shown in Scheme 1 and the procedure is described in detail in the ESI.† Compound 1 was prepared by the Stille coupling reaction between 6-bromo-di(2-ethylhexyl) isoindigo and (5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-tributylstannane with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst, and then it reacted with diethyl-(2,5-dibromothiophene-3-yl)-methylphosphonate to form monomer 2. The polymer PBDT-TID was synthesized using 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and 2via the Stille coupling reaction with a 1:1 monomer ratio in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, which were purified by washing with methanol, hexane and chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h each. PBDT-TID shows excellent film-forming property and solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, THF and chlorobenzene at room temperature, providing convenience for characterization and device processing. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as an eluent showed a high number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 52.0 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.24. The polymer PBDT-TID revealed a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 217 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†) and displayed unnoticeable glass transition in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDT-TID in chloroform solution (0.01 mg mL−1) and the solid film are shown in Fig. 1. PBDT-TID shows one broad absorption band covering the wavelength range from 325 to 700 nm, and the maximum absorption wavelength (λs,max) was at 510 nm, which is attributed to the weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the main chain and the conjugated ID side chain. It is noteworthy that there is a shoulder peak located at around 440 nm both in solution and in the solid film, which should be ascribed to the π–π* transition of the polymer backbone. In a solid film, the maximum absorption peak of PBDT-TID is red-shifted 19 nm compared with the corresponding spectrum in chloroform solution, indicating the presence of aggregation or orderly π–π stacking in the solid state. This unobvious red-shift indicates that π–π stacking in the solid state is not as strong as those of main chain type polymers, probably because the bulky conjugated ID side chains retard the efficient stacking of the polymer chains in the solid state. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of PBDT-TID calculated from the onset of the film absorptions is 1.83 eV. Upon photoexcitation at 500 nm and 350 nm, respectively, PBDT-TID in a diluted CHCl3 solution exhibits the same photoluminescence (PL) spectra with the maximum emission at 722 nm (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The result indicates that quick and complete intramolecular charge transfer of the excitons between the donor (BDT in the polymer main chain) and acceptor moieties (isoindigo in conjugated side chain) occurs.

The electrochemical property of polymer PBDT-TID was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). One can find that the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (vs. SCE) are about 1.22 and −0.60 V, respectively. The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to vacuum, which was measured under the same conditions as the polymer sample to be 0.57 V, which is related to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDT-TID were calculated according to the equations: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.23) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.23) (eV). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.45 and −3.63 eV, respectively. The low-lying HOMO energy level will lead to good air stability26 and a high Voc for the photovoltaic cells. The LUMO energy level (−3.63 eV) is higher above 0.3 eV than PC61BM (−4.02 eV, measured under the same conditions) (Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that the charge transfer from the polymer to PC61BM would be allowed. The electrochemical bandgap of PBDT-TID is estimated to be 1.82 eV, which is comparable to its optical bandgap. In order to understand the influence of charge carrier transport on photovoltaic performance, the hole mobility of the pure polymer was measured by using a FETs method with a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration (Fig. S4, ESI†), and a hole mobility of 2.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was acquired.
BHJ solar cells using the polymer PBDT-TID as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor were investigated with the conventional device configuration. The polymer has excellent solubility in chlorobenzene (CB) and forms a very nice network with PC61BM in a thin film. We investigated the performance of the PSC materials under a variety of conditions (see Table S1, ESI†). We found that no further improvement can be observed by using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive and PC71BM as an acceptor. The weight ratio of PBDT-TID:PC61BM was optimized from 1:2, 1:3 to 1:4 and the relative photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†); corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2. Other detailed conventional and inverted device fabrication and characterization are provided in the ESI.† The optimized PBDT-TID:PC61BM devices, prepared at a blend weight ratio of 1:3, exhibited the best PCE of 5.25%, with a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 12.65 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.52. Upon changing the loading weight ratio of PC61BM to 1:2 or 1:4, the values of Jsc and FF decreased obviously, presumably because of decreased hole mobility and increased phase segregation.27 The excellent photovoltaic performances of the polymer encouraged us to further investigate with the inverted device. Surprisingly, the PCE increased from 5.25% to 6.51% (Jsc = 15.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V, and FF = 0.53). Obviously, the enhanced PCE benefits from the improvement in Jsc and Voc, which is presumably attributed to the reduced photodegradation of the polymer active layer.11 The spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured for the conventional and inverted BHJ cells with the 1:3 blend ratio of PBDT-TID:PC61BM (Fig. 3), which are in approximate agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics.

To arrive at a better understanding of the device characteristics, we have also investigated the morphology of the PBDT-TID:PC61BM (1:3, w/w) blend using atomic force microscopy (AFM). From the AFM phase and height images of PBDT-TID (as shown Fig 4), moderately homogeneous and excellent microphase separation was observed, indicative of good miscibility between PBDT-TID and PC61BM. All these results clearly showed that the conjugated side chain polymer PBDT-TID possesses excellent photovoltaic performance.

In summary, for the first time a novel polymer PBDT-TID with a conjugated isoindigo side chain was designed and synthesized for photovoltaic application. We found that the introduction of the isoindigo-2-vinylthiophenyl unit into the conjugated side chain led to excellent film-forming property and optimal morphology in active layers. Polymer solar cells based on PBDT-TID:PC61BM blends (1:3, w/w) exhibited a high PCE of 5.25% using a conventional device structure. The overall enhanced short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage result in an increased PCE up to 6.51% in the inverted PSCs. The structural modification based on PBDT-TID to further improve the photovoltaic performance is currently under investigation.
