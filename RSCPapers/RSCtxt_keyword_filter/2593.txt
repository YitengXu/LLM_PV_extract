    , Accepted 19th June 2020First published on 19th June 2020AbstractThe efficient electron transfer at the interface of the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite, and the transportation along the ETL and collection at the electrode are characteristics that are critically governed by the properties of the ETL. Both characteristics are fundamental for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSC). So far, mesoporous TiO2 might be considered a versatile ETL as its structure can provide an enormous heterojunction with the perovskite absorber. However, its inert (101) pore facet, massive dead-end pore structure, and extensive grain boundary with the underlying layers in the PSC device have made them unlikely to meet those basic criteria. Here, we have come up with a new design of TiO2 ETL that provides a high carrier dynamic in the device. It is a 3 nm thick high-energy (001) faceted single-crystalline nanograss-like structure (TNG) that is vertically grown on the ITO surface. With these unique structural properties, we achieved an enhanced carrier extraction from the perovskite layer, transportation along the ETL and collection at the electrode. Our results indicate that the charge-transfer dynamic at the TNG–perovskite interface and transport in the device are up to more than 2 times faster than those in the control device or in the recently reported results. With this property, we recorded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 21.60% (or at the level of 20.84% on average) from the TNG-based PSC with the device area as high as ∼0.17 cm2 using triple cation Cs0.05[MA0.13FA0.87]0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 perovskites, an improvement as high as 18% from the control device. The TNG with its unique structure and surface chemistry may become a potential platform for the fabrication of a high-performance PSC device via combination with a high-performance perovskite system.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cell research studies have shown an extremely fast growth since its development in 2009.1 The special properties of the organo-metal halide perovskite material, such as its low-exciton binding energy,2 wide absorption window,3 high carrier diffusion length,4,5 tunable electrical and optical properties by interchanging cations, and metal or halide components,6 have enabled the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency of solar cells using these materials to the level of 25.2%.7 Notwithstanding, there have been many aspects that are being explored to further uplift the performance beyond the current level. This includes the control over the optoelectronics and the stability properties of the organo-lead halide perovskite, which are conducted via a structural modification (2D or 3D structures),8 materials composition engineering,9,10 hybridization with polymer,11 dimensional-12 and defect-control growth,13–16 and optimization of the grain-boundary interface in the perovskite absorber,17 to the use of a different electron transport layer other than TiO2 and its doped-form,18–20 such as SnO2,21,22 La-doped BaSnO3,23 ZnO,24,25 Nb2O5,26 TiS2 (ref. 27) and other compounds, including the CdSe quantum dots,28 polymer based-systems29 and layered two-dimensional systems.30,31 Nevertheless, although appealing achievements in terms of the efficiency and stability have been attained so far using the abovementioned approaches, attempts to raise the performance of the perovskite solar cells up to several points beyond what have been achieved or up to the thermodynamic limit in the future will likely face a critical hurdle owing to: (i) the shortcomings in the electron transfer dynamic at the perovskite and the ETL interface due to inefficient coupling, and (ii) the deficiency in the carrier transport along the ETL colloidal layer and the extraction at the electrode owing to excessive grain-boundary resistance.
In regular planar or mesoporous PSC, the ETL is normally composed of a compact layer of colloidal TiO2 or with an additional layer of mesoporous TiO2 for the latter. Typical for colloidal32 and mesoporous TiO2,33, their surface is characterized by a highly physicochemical stable (101) facet.34 In general, this characteristic generates ineffective coupling with the perovskite layer, which in turn, can constrain the electron transfer dynamic from the perovskite to a certain extent. This phenomenon can then lead to an excessive accumulation of electrons at the perovskite layer surface,21,35 a process that can activate both non-radiative recombination with the holes and device stability degradation.36 In addition to these shortcomings, as is normal in the spin-cast layer, the colloidal stacking on top of others in the layer produces a large density of the grain boundary resistance within the layer itself and with the transparent conducting electrode. Altogether, this can lower the photogenerated electron transport dynamic to the electrode. An additional issue that adds to these shortcomings exists even in the mesoporous TiO2 ETL, which is the presence of critical massive dead-end pore structures in the ETL, the element that can trap the photogenerated carriers and triggers the non-radiative recombination process. Unfortunately, despite the existence of such critical drawbacks in the ETL-perovskite interface, the effort to mitigate this issue is rarely demonstrated. Indeed, there have been a number of approaches established recently to intensify the coupling between the perovskite and the TiO2 ETL, such as functionalization of the colloidal TiO2 with amino,37 the Cl ion,38 sulphate,39 phosphonic acid40 and self-assembly monolayer of the organic acid.41 In addition, an impressive enhancement in the charge transfer activity has also been obtained. Nevertheless, since the critical deficiency in the photogenerated carrier transport along the colloidal ETL layer has not yet been resolved, the interfacial non-radiative recombination is persistent as a result of the unrelenting electron accumulation on the ETL colloidal surface. On top of that, unfortunately, the TiO2 functionalization can activate ion migration to the perovskite–TiO2 interface,42 deteriorating the perovskite stability and performance.43
Here, we have designed a new model of TiO2 ETL that enhances the interfacial electron transfer dynamic with the perovskite layer, and promotes a strong photogenerated current transport and injection to the electrode. This was achieved by growing a single-crystalline high-energy (001) faceted44 nanograss-like anatase TiO2 (TNG) directly on the ITO substrate. The TNG resembles the grass morphology, with a length of up to 250 nm and thickness as low as 3 nm, that can be grown at room temperature with a relatively low phase-refinement temperature (annealing) that is 275 °C, which is much lower compared to the mesoporous TiO2 preparation temperatures (i.e., ca. 400 °C) at which the ITO properties cannot be preserved. With these structural properties, the TNG presents as a highly energetic and atomically thin nanosheet structure that stands vertically on the substrate surface. These characteristics can provide a large area of interface and high-energy sites for active exciton dissociation, electron injection and transport. Additionally, a uni-directional electric field parallel to the facet can be generated in the material, enabling a strong photocurrent during the photovoltaic process. This is because the excitons arising from the lowest direct optical transition in the material have the wavefunction oriented two-dimensionally along the (001) plane in the (001) faceted ultrathin anatase TiO2,45 resembling the exciton wavefunction in the layered van der Waals crystals. Our results revealed that the co-existence of the quantum effect due to the ultimate thin structure, large area of the high-energy facet and special electronics properties in TNG have remarkably enhanced the interfacial photogenerated electron transfer and transport dynamics in the PSC device. Under an optimal condition, the TNG-based PSC can generate a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) as high as 23.30 mA cm−2, 1.16 V, and 0.799, respectively. This is equivalent to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 21.60% from a device with an active area of 0.17 cm2 using the triple-cation Cs0.05[MA0.13FA0.87]0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 perovskite system.46,47
Results
We grew the TNG directly on the ITO substrate using our earlier reported liquid-phase deposition method48 with a modification. The structure and physicochemical properties of the TNG are presented in Fig. 1. The phase crystallinity is anatase as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1a†) (JCPDS file no. 21-1272). When comparing the spectrum with that of the spherical anatase TiO2 sample (P25), its peak intensity and peak width are inferior and broader, respectively. These indicate that the TNG is considerably smaller in dimension compared with the P25 colloidal crystals. We highlight a key feature of TNG here that the intensity ratio of its (001) and (101) peaks is much higher than that for the P25. This indicates that the TNG possesses a dominant (001) facet, which is the second highest energy facet in anatase TiO2. In view of the special physicochemistry performance of this facet in a wide-range of surface reactions and photocatalysis,44 we expect that the TNG facilitates an active surface coupling with the perovskite absorber for a highly active photo-generated electron transfer. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis results (Fig. 1a and b) show that the TNG is oriented vertically on the substrate surface with the structure resembling a grass-like morphology; that is, a vertically oriented nanosheet that inclines to the top-end, forming a sharp-tip spiked structure. This spiked structure is a high-energy site and the result of a “sharp-tip effect” in which a high density of electrons accumulate at a sharp tip, playing a central role in an energetic electron transfer49–51 and an active exciton dissociation.52 We then peeled off the TNG from the substrate and transferred them onto a transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) grid for a crystallinity evaluation using high-resolution TEM analysis (Fig. 1c). The results indicate that the TNG is single crystalline in nature with a structure wrapped by a facet that mainly belongs to the (001) and (100) planes, a feature that has been confirmed earlier by XRD analysis. As the result also reveals, the individual TNG has a surface that consists of an atomically rugged structure, a feature of which is high in chemical energy and required for a strong surface reaction. To further gain insight into the structural dynamics and physicochemical properties of the TNG, we carried out a Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis on the sample. The results were then compared with those of P25. The results showed that only a single vibrational mode, the in-plane Ti–O stretching or stressing vibration mode (denoted as Eg) (Fig. 1e), was observed in the Raman spectrum of TNG, which is in stark contrast to the P25 spectrum counterpart. The results also disclosed that the Eg peak position in TNG was at a much higher frequency in comparison to that of the P25 sample (Fig. 1f). These two features conveyed the following: first, the nanograss is a nanosheet with an extremely thin structure, so that the only detectable Raman character is the in-plane Ti–O stretching or stressing. Second, the Ti–O bond-length in the (001) faceted-nanograss is longer than that in the (101) faceted P25 so that the interaction between the photon and electron cloud along the surface is increased, shifting the Raman peak to the higher frequency. By using a correlation between the peak position of the Eg band and the thickness as reported in a recent paper,53 the thickness of the nanograss leaf can be approximated to be 3 nm. We then carried out an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study to evaluate the surface chemistry properties of the TNG (Fig. 1g and h). According to the intensity ratio of the fitted curves (the colored and shaded curves) of the chemical state binding energy in Ti or O, we established the fact that the TNG featured a much higher density of un-saturated Ti4+ (non-lattice) state at approximately 30%, and non-lattice oxygen state (OB and OH states) at ca. 57% on its surface. They are only roughly 28.5% and 40.9% for the non-lattice Ti and O, respectively, in the P25 system (Fig. S1b–d†). The higher-density non-lattice state in TNG compared with that of the P25 system indicated that TNG possessed a chemically active surface that could promote a stronger surface coordination and optimal interfacial coupling with the perovskite absorber materials.

The length of the TNG can be varied by changing the concentration of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) used in the reaction. The TNG length increases with increasing HMT concentration. For example, the length is approximately 40 nm when using an HMT concentration of 4.2 μM. Afterward, it increases linearly with increasing HMT and reaches a length of 250 nm when the HMT concentration reached 16.7 μM. Nevertheless, the TNG length decreased when the HMT concentration further increased as a result of steric hindrance, which is the declining of the growth rate due to a high surfactant concentration (Table S1†). In addition, at a relatively high HMT concentration, particularly higher than 16.7 μM, the formation of the nanograss was not controllable as they grew on top of others, causing an irregularity in the nanograss thickness on the substrate surface (Fig. S2†). To achieve a highly homogeneous and significantly long TNG, a concentration of HMT that was below 12.6 μM, particularly 8.4 μM, could be used.
To evaluate how the novel structure of TNG influences the performance of the perovskite solar cells with its unique properties, we developed a PSC device with an ITO/TNG/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure. The triple cation perovskite, Cs0.05[MA0.13FA0.87]0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3, was used in this study due to its high phase, thermal stabilities, and its special photophysical properties that recently produced a PSC device with an efficiency of up to 18% using mesoporous TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD as the electron and hole transport layers, respectively.46 We also fabricated the PSC devices with the same structure utilizing the SnO2 colloidal layer as the ETL, which is the most preferred ETL used recently in perovskite solar cells,22 to obtain a general description of how the current TNG ETL is superior in any photovoltaic parameters compared with SnO2. To provide a clear picture of how the structure of the TNG ETL is the central issue in this study, we compared the performance of PSC using the shortest TNG ETL (TNG25) with SnO2 ETL as the basis of the discussion. We found that the performance of the TNG-based PSC was greater than that of the SnO2-based PSC, as well as the recently reported mesoporous TiO2 based PSC.46 For example, the PSC fabricated using the shortest TNG (Fig. 2) with an approximate length of 40 nm (prepared using HMT with a concentration of 4.2 μM, TNG25 for short) produced a PCE of up to 21.00% with Jsc, Voc and FF values of as high as 22.55 mA cm−2, 1.17 V and 0.796, respectively. Meanwhile, it is only 18.21% efficient with Jsc, Voc and FF values as low as 21.31 mA cm−2, 1.15 V and 0.743, respectively, in the SnO2-based PSC. Statistical analysis results showed further detail into the superiority of the TNG25-based PSC over the SnO2-based PSC in the overall photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 2b–e), with the average recorded PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF values as high as 19.98%, 21.56 mA cm−2, 1.16 V and 0.799, respectively. Correspondingly, these values only reached up to 17.65%, 21.02 mA cm−2, 1.13 V and 0.743 in the SnO2-based PSC. Considering that the photovoltaic parameters, particularly Voc (a parameter that is strongly correlated with the nature of the interfacial charge transfer dynamic, recombination and energetic disorder in the device54), are much higher in the TNG-based PSC, we can affirm that there should be an enhancement in the interfacial photogenerated carrier transfer dynamic in the TNG-based PSC device, which is undoubtedly promoted by a single-crystalline grass-like structure and (001)-faceted TNG ETL (Fig. 1c). The spectral sensitivity analysis result by the external quantum efficiency spectroscopy (Fig. 2f) provides further additional evidence for the dominance of the TNG-based PSC over the SnO2-based PSC. We found that the TNG-based device showed a higher quantum efficiency, particularly at the wavelength region higher than 420 nm, compared with the SnO2-based device and can reach a maximum value of as high as 87.8%. Meanwhile, it is only 86.2% in the SnO2-based PSC. Nonetheless, it showed a lower sensitivity than the SnO2-based PSC in the wavelength region below 420 nm. We presume that this is due to an active near-surface recombination in such ultrathin TNG at this wavelength region, as recently observed in the (110) anatase TiO2.55 Moreover, the TNG layer is relatively thicker than the SnO2 layer, so that most of the light in this wavelength region is considerably absorbed and does not pass through the perovskite absorber. This case is more apparent if using a longer TNG (see Fig. 3f, discussed later). However, despite the intense absorption of light irradiation by the TNG at this wavelength region, an enhanced interfacial carrier transfer dynamic in the TNG-based PSC can surmount this drawback, realizing a high-performance PSC device.

We then fabricated the PSC using the colloidal TiO2 ETL to further confirm how the ETL structure and morphology influence the overall photovoltaic performance. As expected, we discovered that the colloidal TiO2 ETL based PSC performance is pretty much inferior over the TNG-based PSC in which the average PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF are only as high as 19.74%, 22.54 mA cm−2, 1.13 V and 0.775, respectively (see Table S1†).
The PCE of the TNG-based PSC increased impressively when the length was increased to approximately 80 nm. At this condition, we recorded the highest efficiency as high as 21.60% with Jsc, Voc, and FF as high as 23.30 mA cm−2, 1.16 V and 0.799, respectively. Distinctly, these photovoltaic features are significantly higher compared with the original device using the triple cation system with a mesoporous TiO2 ETL46 or with SnO2 ETL,47 and compared with the SnO2-based PSC fabricated in this study. The improvement of Jsc, Voc, and FF compared with those of the PSC device using a shorter TNG indicated an enhancement in the carrier transfer dynamic in the PSC device. This occurred when the TNG length was augmented, driven by a facile carrier injection from the perovskite absorber to the TNG. The recombination dynamic in the device was reduced, as verified by the steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy results (see Fig. S3a†), a phenomenon that has also been reported earlier.56 Nonetheless, the PCE then declined when the TNG length was further elongated from this value. It decreased to 20.26% and 19.75%, on average, when the TNG length was augmented to 120 nm (TNG75) and 250 nm (TNG100), respectively. The PCE descended even further to lower values at 18.94% and 18.62% (Table S1†), respectively, when TNG125 and TNG150 with shorter lengths (i.e., ca. ∼200 nm) were used. This was the result of immense aggregation on the TNG surface (Fig. S2e and f†) that could lead to a massive carrier trapping process in these devices. Nonetheless, despite the decline in PCE, the average Voc and FF rose with the expansion of the TNG length above the optimal value. These values reached the maximum for the PSC device using a TNG with a length of 120 nm (TNG75) for Voc and 250 nm (TNG100) for FF. At this maximal point, the Voc and FF could reach the values of 1.18 V and 0.811, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). However, as the Jsc decreased when the TNG length was raised above the optimal value, the PCE declined. Although the FESEM analysis indicated that the perovskite grain size increased with increasing TNG length (see Fig. S4 and S5†), the thickness of the perovskite also increased with the increased TNG length. For example, the perovskite grain size increased from approximately 100 nm at the shortest TNG (TNG25) to ca. 200 nm at the optimal TNG (TNG50), and then increased to above 300 nm when the TNG length further extended above the optimal value, a parameter that is beneficial for carrier mobility improvement in the device. In many cases, the latter can cause an augmentation in the energetic disorder in the device, deteriorating the performance in a process that has been reported earlier.57,58 Thus, the decline in Jsc can be related to the carrier trap buildup in the device due to the increased crystal domain disorder as the perovskite thickness increased. In addition, the upsurge of the near-surface charge recombination with the TNG length augmentation could also be a factor for the decline of Jsc. The EQE properties of the devices presented in Fig. 3f and S6† explicitly verify these phenomena. The EQE declined when the length of the TNG increased (Table S1†), particularly in the wavelength region below 420 nm.
For the optimal TNG-based PSC device, we have fabricated almost forty samples in a different batch in this study. We discovered that the PCE was averaged at 20.84% with the averaged Jsc, as mentioned earlier, as high as 22.82 mA cm−2. One thing to be noted here is that the Voc of more than 70% of the device can reach a value of higher than 1.15 V, and around 20% of the device reached a Voc value above 1.17 V (maximum at 1.182 V) (Fig. 3 or Fig. S7† for detail). This is significantly higher than the SnO2-based PSC, and the best reported result on the PSC device utilizing TiO2 or SnO2 ETLs.59 We took one of the samples for evaluating the J–V response under operational conditions at a maximum power point. The response was normalized to easily compare the stability behavior of the device with the SnO2-based PSC (Fig. 4a). We found that the TNG-based PSC device performance was stabilized at 97.1% of its initial PCE during 300 s of continuous application. This is definitely higher than the one in the SnO2-based PSC in which its PCE was only retained at 95.5% under the same operational condition. The device also exhibited excellent long-term stability in which the device retained around 94.2% of its initial PCE after being aged for more than two months under N2 atmosphere (Fig. 4b). By comparing the photovoltaic parameters of the device from the J–V analysis results under the reverse and forward scan, we extracted the power hysteresis index (HI) property of the device that was approximated using the relation of ,60 where  and  are the reverse and forward scans of the current density at a bias of 0.8Voc, respectively (see Method in ESI†). We found that, as is normal to the TiO2 ETL system and especially the mesoporous TiO2, the power hysteresis in the TNG-based PSC (Fig. 4c) was also evident with the value at about 10% (Fig. 4c and Table S1†). Nevertheless, it was lower than the one obtained from the SnO2-based PSCs, of which the HI value in this device was as high as 12%. In view of this phenomenon is mainly associated with the optoelectrical properties of the perovskites, such as carrier trapping–detrapping process61 and the effect of the transient current–voltage response62 or ionic polarization,63 all of which are phase crystallinity and chemical stability-dependent processes, and are attributed to the nature of the interface characteristic between the transparent conducting electrode (TCE) and ETL to some extent. Therefore, a lower HI value in the TNG based PSC device provides further confirmation to the distinctive role of TNG physico-chemical properties in the enhancement of the overall photovoltaic process.

Discussion
We conclude that the enhancement of the performance in the TNG-based PSC device compared to that of the SnO2-based system is due to: (i) the photo-generated carrier transfer dynamic upsurging at the TNG-perovskite layer interface, a result of the improvement of the interfacial coupling both with perovskite and ITO, and (ii) the superficial electron transport in the ETL attributed to the TNG single-crystallinity property. We used transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy analysis to observe the nature of the photoluminescence decay immediately after the excitation at 757 nm. This was achieved with the PL emission peak of the perovskite layer (Fig. 4d). We then fitted the result using a bi-exponential decay function (see Table S2† for parameters extracted from the fit). We also verified such processes and discovered that the carrier transfer rate in the TNG-based device was remarkably high with the interfacial charge transfer time constant (τ1) as low as 3.3 ns. It is approximately 2 times faster than the one in the SnO2-based PSC device, which is as high as 7.1 ns, and those in the recently reported results (Table S3†). The existence of such phenomenon in the TNG-based PSC system, which is the energetic interfacial charge transfer dynamic, is further corroborated by the fact of rapid quenching of the perovskite bulk radiative recombination as judged from the bulk PL decay time constant (τ2) value (as low as 64.8 ns). This value is again significantly faster than in the SnO2-based PSC system (i.e., 78.5 ns) and those in the recently reported results (Table S3†). These results undoubtedly elucidate that the TNG expedites the massive photogenerated carrier extraction at the earliest photoexcitation process, draining the photogenerated carrier and subsiding the radiative recombination in the bulk perovskite layer. The TRPL result describes the nature of the photogenerated carrier transfer dynamic in an open circuit system, wherein the positive charged hole accumulated in the perovskite can have an effect to some extent on the carrier diffusion and the recombination characteristics. However, we have carried out an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis64 to rule out their effect. The measurement was carried out under a simulated-solar light illumination (1 sun). The result was fitted with an equivalent circuit containing series, charge transfer and recombination resistances65 (see Table S2† for parameters extracted from the fit), as expected. We then established the interfacial charge transfer resistance between the perovskite and ETL, which is shown by a semicircle at the high frequency region. The interfacial charge transfer resistance was almost four times lower in the TNG-based device (111 Ω), compared with the SnO2-based PSC (as high as 431 Ω, Fig. 4d) and the recently reported results (Table S4†). Thus, this fact further validated the TRPL result. Notwithstanding, the EIS analysis also revealed that the recombination resistance, which is shown by an arc in the low frequency region, in the TNG-based device is apparently inferior compared with the SnO2-based PSC (134 Ω vs. 543 Ω, respectively). Although the low Rrec produces a negative impact on the photovoltaic properties of the PSC, the superior performance of the TNG-based PSC presents as additional evidence that the highly dynamic interfacial charge transfer process exists in the TNG-based PSC. This could be understood because the carrier recombination in the device involves the interfacial and bulk processes, of which they are respectively related to the hole blocking capability of the ETL, available trap density, and the nature of the carrier diffusion pathway. From the viewpoint of the interfacial recombination process, considering that the valence energy level of TiO2 is shallower than that of SnO2, the low Rrec in the TNG-based PSC compared with the SnO2 based PSC device is inevitable. For the Rrec in the perspective of bulk recombination process, its value might be lower in the TNG-based PSC. This is because it has a more complex pathway for carrier diffusion, particularly the hole, to the transport layer. We verified this process by evaluating the Voc-dependent light intensity characteristic of the PSC from which the nature of the bulk carrier recombination in the device can be estimated. Under a low carrier density regime, the value of the slope (m) of the Voc-dependent light intensity curve (Fig. 4e) reflects the imprints of the trap-assisted recombination in the perovskite layer. The result shows that the trap-assisted recombination signature in the TNG-based PSC device is also significant when the value of m is higher than kT/q (the system with a free trap-assisted recombination signature66) at 1.47kT/q, which is 0.47-order higher than the free trap system. When compared with the SnO2-based PSC device, it is about 2.8% higher (m value in the SnO2-based PSC is 1.43kT/q). Considering that the TNG-based PSC has both relatively lower hole blocking capability and higher trap signature value than the SnO2-based PSC, and in view of their damaging effect in the photovoltaic process in the PSC, it is worth to remark that a highly energetic interfacial electron transfer should prevail in the TNG system, particularly at the earliest stage of the photoexcitation, draining the electron to the TNG-perovskite interface and extracting them to the TNG. This would suppress both interfacial and bulk carrier recombination, producing a high-performance PSC device.
We carried out a carrier mobility property analysis in the device to further validate the existence of such special carrier dynamic in the TNG-based PSC by fabricating an electron-only device with a configuration of ITO/ETLs/perovskite/PCBM/Au. The double logarithmic J–V analysis results in the dark for the TNG, SnO2 and colloidal TiO2 ETLs-based devices are presented in Fig. 5. As shown and typical for the PSC, the J–V responses of the devices exhibit a space-charge limited current characteristic67 with the presence of a quadratic dependence of current density J on the voltage V (Mott–Gurney equation) at the high bias. By fitting the curve using the Mott–Gurney relation (see Electron mobility analysis in ESI†), we discovered that the electron mobility in the TNG-based device is as high as 1.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is doubly higher compared with the one in the SnO2-based device (6.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), or even more than 400 times higher if compared with the one in the colloidal TiO2-based device (i.e., 3.34 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). This electron mobility value is also superior over the electron mobility recorded in the recently reported perovskite system.68 Thus, these results are certainly a solid confirmation of the special feature of TNG in promoting a high interfacial carrier transfer dynamic in the PSC device.
 Fig. 5  Double logarithmic plot of J–V for the electron-only device, as shown in the inset with a positive bias. The dashed lines were drawn as a guide to the eye, and correlate with the SCLC part of the J–V responses. The coloured strip at the horizontal axis describes the mechanism of electron transport in the device, which include ohmic, trap fill transition (TFL) and space-charge limited current (SCLC) process. 
It has been mentioned earlier that the Voc in the TNG ETL-based PSC device, independent of the TNG dimension, is much higher than that of the SnO2 ETL-based PSC. As the Voc is also related to the nature of the energy level alignment between the perovskite and ETL, we can also remark that the ultrathin nanograss structure of TiO2 with spiked geometry might enhance the energy level alignment with the perovskite. This would provide a facile charge transfer and transport in the device, a phenomenon of the morphology effect that has also been observed in the recent literature.69
Regarding the declining performance with the increase of the TNG length above the optimal value, it can be correlated to the matter of the diffusion dynamics57 of the carrier in the perovskite absorber layer. As discussed earlier, the unique structure of TNG improves the perovskite grain size (Fig. S4 and S5†), phase crystallinity (Fig. S8†) and thickness. This has been verified by optical absorbance spectroscopy results (Fig. S3b†), and the carrier diffusion dynamics, particularly the hole, can be constrained and is susceptible to an annihilation process owing to the increase of energetic disorder.57 Such process is then reflected by the Voc and FF values of the device. By fabricating the TNG50-based device with different concentrations of perovskite, we further confirmed that such progression exists as the Voc and FF values deteriorated with increasing perovskite concentration (Fig. S9c and d†) above the optimal concentration at 1.3 M. The leakage current profile is the parameter that also correlates to Voc and FF. Under different perovskite thicknesses, it further verified this phenomenon as there was no significant discrepancy in the leakage current in the PSC device with different perovskite thickness (Fig. S3c and S9f†). Considering that the interfacial charge transfer dynamic remains uniform in TNG with a similar condition, the increased energetic disorder in the perovskite absorber as the thickness increases should be the main origin for the declining performance under a high perovskite thickness.
Nevertheless, with a special structure that enables a highly dynamic interfacial charge transfer in the device, the TNG will provide a superior platform for a high-performance PSC device. In combination with a rapid improvement in the quality and the photophysical properties70 of the perovskite, a PSC device with a better performance can soon be expected in the future.
To this extent, the TNG-based PSC has demonstrated superiority in many aspects over the SnO2-based PSC, particularly in the point of view of the charge transfer dynamic and transportation properties in the device. However, the detailed picture of how the morphology of ETL influences the carrier mobility, as well as the trap density in the device utilizing TNG ETL that in turn affects the overall performance of PSC, have not yet been established in the present study. This is the subject of our current study, and the findings will be reported soon in a different publication in the future.
Methods
Nanograss preparation
The nanograss of the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared using our previously reported method with a special modification, i.e., liquid-phase growth method. Briefly, the growth process is described as follows: a growth solution that contained 5 mL of 0.1 M ammonium hexafluoro titanate ((NH4)2TiF6) (Sigma Aldrich) and 5 mL of 0.2 M boric acid (H3BO3) (Sigma Aldrich) was first prepared. Next, a 5 mL of 0.2 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the previous solution, and mixed well by hand-shaking for 20 seconds. Two clean ITO substrates (<10 Ω per square) were cleaned by consecutive ultrasonication in acetone and ethanol for 30 min each. These substrates were clamped together using a plastic paper clip, with the ITO side faced outward, then immersed and hung vertically into the solution, and kept at 25 °C in a water bath for 25 h. After that, the sample was taken out and rinsed with a copious amount of pure water, and then dried with a flow of nitrogen gas. A yellow color reflection on the ITO surface is an indicator for the formation of TNG. At this stage, the sample may contain anatase phase TiO2, as well as other Ti complex impurities. Thus, we then transferred the samples into an electrical oven for annealing at 275 °C for 1 h for a phase refinement process. The anatase TiO2 nanograss on the ITO substrate was obtained after the thermal annealing process. To acquire the nanograss with different lengths, we varied the concentration of the HMT from 0.025 to 0.15 M. Other reagents remained unchanged. Pure water (18.2 MΩ cm) was obtained from a Millipore water purification system and used during the experiment.
Perovskite preparation
The perovskite absorber used in this work is a triple cation and mixed halide anion system, i.e., Cs0.05[MA0.13FA0.87]0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3, which was prepared using a precursor solution of 171.97 mg of formamidium iodide (FAI) (Greatcells), 22.39 mg of methylammonium bromide (MABr) (Greatcells), 80.7 mg of lead bromide (PbBr2) (TCI) and 501.7 mg of lead iodide (PbI2) (TCI) dissolved in a mixed solution of 800 μL dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma Aldrich) and 200 μL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich). The solution was then shaken for 3 h while heated at 60 °C. After that, a 50 μL of 194.86 mg mL−1 of cesium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) was added into the solution and shaken for another 1 h at room temperature. The perovskite solution was filtered prior to use. Meanwhile, the hole-transport layer (HTL) precursor solution was a 72.39 mg spiro-OMeTAD dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene, and doped with a 18 μL of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) (Sigma Aldrich), 25 μL of 300 mg mL−1 FK209 tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (both in acetonitrile) (Sigma Aldrich), and 29 μL of 4-tert-tetrabutylpyridine (Sigma Aldrich).
Characterizations
The phase crystallinity of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction technique using a BRUKER D8 Advance system with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.541 Å). The scan rate was 10° min−1. The morphology and crystallinity of the sample were examined using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) Hitachi S-4800 operating at 2 kV, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) Zeiss Libra HRTEM 200 FE operating at 200 kV, respectively. The surface chemistry of the samples was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XSAM-HS from KRATOS, UK with Al Kα radiation. The phase and structural dynamics of the sample were evaluated via Raman spectroscopy using confocal micro-Raman imaging, Thermo Scientific (model DX2Xi) with 532 nm Ar ion laser as the excitation source.
The optical properties of the perovskite samples were characterized via transmission spectroscopy using a Filmetrics F20-UV thin film analyzer with deuterium and halogen lamps LS-DT2 system. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) properties of the sample were obtained from a homemade PL system using a MAL-E laser with a wavelength of 514 nm as the excitation light source. Meanwhile, the transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was conducted using a Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) (Fluorolog-Horiba) with an excitation laser light with a wavelength of 504 nm.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication and characterization
Prior to the fabrication of the solar cells, we applied a UV–ozone treatment onto the TNG-modified ITO substrate for 15 min, and then put them into a glove box with an atmosphere condition containing O2 < 15.0 ppm and H2O around 0.2 ppm for the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene) film fabrication. The perovskite film with a thickness of approximately 600 nm was prepared using a two-step spin-coating process, i.e., 1000 rpm for 10 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s. In the last 7 s of the spin-coating process, we dropped 180 μL chlorobenzene anti-solvent. A light-brown film was formed on the surface at this stage. To form a black perovskite film, we then directly annealed the sample on a hotplate at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling down the sample to room temperature, we made a thin layer of spiro-OMeTAD on top of the perovskite by spin-coating the precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The sample was then kept overnight in the glove box prior to a gold electrode deposition. Finally, we transferred the sample into a thermal evaporation chamber to grow a gold electrode with an approximated thickness of 85 nm.
To examine the photovoltaic properties of the as-prepared device, we measured the J–V curve profile of the PSC device in the glove-box using a Keithley 2602B source-measure unit under a solar-light simulator (AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2) obtained from Oriel solar simulator 94023A. We evaluated the J–V curves under forward and reverse scans from −0.5 V to 1.25 V. The scan step was 0.04 V s−1. The active area of the PSC device is 0.17 cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device was evaluated using a quantum efficiency measurement system, QE-R, Enlitech (Taiwan). A scan step as low as 5 nm s−1 was used during the measurement.
A similar process was also adopted for the fabrication of the planar SnO2 and TiO2 ETL-based PSCs. The planar SnO2 and TiO2 ETLs were prepared by spin-coating the SnO2 and TiO2 colloidal dispersions (purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials, China) in ethanol at a speed of 3000 and 2000 rpm for 30 s, respectively, onto a clean pre-patterned ITO substrate. After that, the samples were annealed in air at 180 °C for 60 min for SnO2 and 150 °C for 30 min for TiO2. Finally, the samples were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min prior to the device fabrication.
Electron mobility analysis
The electron mobility property of the PSC device was evaluated by fabricating an electron-only device with a configuration of ITO/ETLs/Perovskite/PCBM/Au. The ETLs are TNG, SnO2 and colloidal TiO2. The ETLs, perovskite and Au layers were prepared by following a previously described method. Meanwhile, the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) films were prepared by spin coating 50 μL of 10 mg mL−1 of the precursor in chlorobenzene at 2000 rpm for 30 s.
The J–V response of the device in the dark was then recorded, and the result was then plotted in the form of a double logarithmic curve and fitted with the Mott–Gurney relation67 of . By using the perovskite layer thickness of 580 nm and the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (46.9),71 we calculated the electron mobility in the device.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  TiO2 nanograss (TNG) structure and properties. (a and b) Top-view and side view FESEM image of TNG. (c) High-resolution TEM image of TNG, showing the high-energy (001) faceted nanograss. (d) TNG illustrational growth on the ITO substrate surface. (e and f) Raman spectrum and magnified spectral region of Eg (1). (g and h) XPS high-resolution scan at the Ti and O binding energies for TNG. The colored and shaded curves in (g) and (h) are the fitted data.	 

 	Fig. 2  Photovoltaic performance of the PSC based on TNG and the SnO2 electron transport layers. (a) J–V curves for the champion devices using the shortest TNG (TNG25) in this study and SnO2. (b–e) Comparison of the photovoltaic parameters for the two devices. The EQE spectra are presented in (f).	 

 	Fig. 3  Photovoltaic parameters of PSC devices prepared using different length TNG ETL. (a) Comparison of J–V curves for the champion PSC devices using TNG with different lengths. (b–e) Their corresponding PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF values. (f) EQE spectra of the champion TNG and SnO2-based PSCs.	 

 	Fig. 4  Stability, hysteresis and photogenerated carrier dynamic properties of the TNG-based PSC device. (a and b) The stability properties under continuous operation at the maximum power point and under aging in a N2 atmosphere. (c) The hysteresis property. (d) Transient-PL spectra. (e) Electrochemical impedance spectra and equivalent circuit for the device. (f) Semi-logarithmic plot of light intensity dependence Voc. The slope m of the curve reflects the trap-assisted recombination profile of the TNG-based PSC device (blue square) and the SnO2-based PSC (orange diamond).	 

 	Fig. 5  Double logarithmic plot of J–V for the electron-only device, as shown in the inset with a positive bias. The dashed lines were drawn as a guide to the eye, and correlate with the SCLC part of the J–V responses. The coloured strip at the horizontal axis describes the mechanism of electron transport in the device, which include ohmic, trap fill transition (TFL) and space-charge limited current (SCLC) process.
