    , Accepted 23rd February 2022First published on 24th February 2022AbstractDoping metal ions into a perovskite lattice is an effective strategy for tailoring the intrinsic properties of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). Herein, strong red-emitting and highly ambient and light stable Fe2+-doped CsPbBrI2 NCs with a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.1% were obtained. Systematic investigation of Fe2+ doping on the stability and the luminescence performance of CsPbBrI2 NCs was performed. Owing to the smaller ionic size compared to Pb2+, Fe2+ induced the lattice contraction and shortened the bond length of Pb–X, which suppressed the distortion of [PbX6]4− octahedra, thus improving the stability of CsPbBrI2 NCs. The champion sample could maintain up to 86% emission under the ambient conditions for 5 weeks. Besides, the incorporation of Fe2+ suppressed the formation of halide vacancies and optimized the relaxation process of CsPbBrI2, thereby contributing to the enhancement of PLQY. This facile Fe2+ doping method provides an effective strategy to synthesize stable and highly photoluminescent red perovskite materials.
1. Introduction
With the increasing demand for energy conversion,1–4 optical displays,5–8 signal detection,9,10 biomedical imaging,11,12 and reaction catalysis,13,14 perovskite (ABX3) materials, in particular all inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs, A is Cs; B is Pb; X is Cl, Br or I), have attracted considerable attention due to their convenient solution processability, flexible tunability of band gaps from the violet to near-infrared, narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs).15,16 At present, CsPbX3 NCs with PLQYs over 90% have been achieved, and the corresponding low-threshold amplified spontaneous emissive layers and high-efficiency light emission diodes (LEDs) have been constructed.17–19
However, CsPbX3 NCs still suffer from poor stability. Due to their intrinsic ionicity and low formation energy, external factors such as oxygen, heat, and humidity can trigger the decomposition of perovskites, so that the surface passivation strategy is very significant to maintain the existence of perovskites.20–23 In addition, the surface and internal defects (vacancies or interstitials) of perovskites can induce nonradiative recombination of excitons and reduce the symmetry of the crystal structure, resulting in the deterioration of performance. Among CsPbX3 systems, the stability issues of red-emitting perovskites are particularly prominent and the most unstable α-CsPbI3 could undergo the phase transition and become optically inactive.24–26 Moreover, according to the hard–soft acid–base principle, surface ligand binding in iodide systems is unstable due to the soft nature of I−, which makes the surface more sensitive and vulnerable to damage, especially in the cases of the presence of antisolvents.19 Instead, the suitable Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the octahedral parameter of CsPbBr3 make it the most stable perovskite among CsPbX3. Hence, the partial replacement of I− by Br− can greatly improve the phase stability of α-CsPbI3 by increasing the tolerance factor. Compared with CsPbI3, apart from better phase stability, mixed halide perovskite CsPbBrI2 could also maintain a red emission with comparable intensity and has been extensively studied.24–26 Nonetheless, CsPbBrI2 has still encountered the issue of light-induced or moisture-induced phase separation, due to the weaker bond strength of Pb–I.24
Metal ion doping is considered to be an effective strategy to modulate the intrinsic properties of semiconductors by introducing a different metal ion into the target lattice intentionally, keeping the host crystal structure unchanged.27,28 Due to the relatively small cation radii of Cs+ (1.88 Å), all inorganic CsPbX3 NCs have a relatively small tolerance factor. Partial substitution of Pb2+ with a smaller B-site cation can shorten the B–X bond length and stabilize the PNCs by reducing the extent of octahedral rotation or distortion, thereby leading to a larger tolerance factor (improved phase stability) and larger formation energy (improved thermal stability).29 Meanwhile, the toxic lead content could be reduced by doping.
Over the past few years, a number of metal ion-doped PNCs have been developed and investigated.30–33 For instance, Cu2+ (RB = 0.73Å) doped CsPbBrI2 NCs with a PLQY of 81.3% were obtained through a hot injection method and 69.4% of PLQY was retained after 30 days of storage under ambient conditions.24 Gd3+ (RB = 0.93 Å) doped CsPbBrI2 NCs with excellent water stability were obtained through a melting quenching method and the brightness of CsPbBrI2 remained stable after 60 days in water.34 In addition, the excellent thermal and light stability obtained by Gd3+ doping makes the CsPbBrI2 NCs promising for the construction of white-emitting perovskite devices.
Iron elements with abundant reserves feature good conductivity, low cost and environmental friendliness. As two stable oxidation states of iron, Fe2+ and Fe3+ have recently been doped in CsPbCl3 NCs.35–37 Hu et al. prepared Fe2+ doped CsPbCl3 NCs, which exhibited the highest PLQY of 6.2%.35 Shyamal et al. doped Fe2+ in CsPbBr3 NCs for use as an efficient photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2.36 Singh et al. reported Fe3+ doped CsPbCl3, which improved the PLQY from 1.85% to 4.32%.37 Meanwhile, it was reported that an efficient energy transfer could occur from CsPbCl3 excitons to Fe3+ dopants leading to a pink-coloured dual emission. Recently, FeCl2 has been incorporated into CsPbBrI2-based solar cells to modify the photovoltaic performance. The incorporation of FeCl2 induced grain size reduction and reduced the defect states in the CsPbBrI2 films, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 17.1% and exceptional operational stability.38 As far as we know, the effect of iron ion doping on the stability and luminescence properties of red-emitting PNCs has not been examined. Systematic investigation on the relationship between the iron doping and performance of CsPbBrI2 NCs is thus required.
Herein, Fe2+ is used as a dopant to improve the luminescence performance and stability of α-CsPbBrI2 NCs for the first time. To investigate the effects of different iron sources, we chose three iron salts including FeBr2, Fe(Ac)2, and FeF2 to prepare Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs through a hot injection method (Fig. 1). It was shown that with the partial replacement of Pb2+ by the smaller Fe2+, the PLQY of CsPbBrI2 NCs could be boosted from 69.2% up to ∼90%. More importantly, the ambient, light and purification stabilities of CsPbBrI2 NCs are significantly improved after iron doping, which could aid in maintaining more than 60% of the initial PLQY when exposed to ambient conditions for 5 weeks. Besides, the performance of Fe2+ doped PNCs synthesized at a higher Fe/Pb feeding ratio (2:1) and the etching process during purification have also been carefully examined.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and reagents
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%), iron(II) bromide (FeBr2, 98%), iron(II) acetate (Fe(Ac)2, 98%), iron(II) difluoride (FeF2, 99%), iron(II) iodide (FeI2, 99.99%), oleic acid (OA, 95%), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), ethyl acetate (EA, 99.5%) and n-hexane (99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd. All the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise noted. Note that ODE, OA and OAm dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C were denoted as dried ODE, dried OA and dried OAm, respectively.
2.2 Preparation of the Cs-oleate precursor
The Cs-oleate precursor was prepared according to a previously reported approach with certain modifications.39 In brief, Cs2CO3 (81.4 mg), dried OA (0.25 mL) and dried ODE (4 mL) were loaded into a 50 mL round-bottom flask and degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h, followed by heating at 150 °C under an Ar atmosphere until all Cs2CO3 reacted with OA. The final reaction solution was kept at 150 °C since Cs-oleate precipitates out of ODE at room temperature.
2.3 Synthesis of CsPbBrI2 perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)
For the synthesis of CsPbBrI2 PNCs, PbBr2 (48.8 mg), PbI2 (123.6 mg), dried OA (1.5 mL), dried OAm (1.5 mL) and dried ODE (12 mL) were loaded in a 50 mL flask, dried under vacuum for 30 min at 120 °C and then heated under Ar at 120 °C. After 10 min, the temperature was increased to 160 °C and the mixture was kept at this temperature for 5 min. Then, the hot Cs-oleate precursor (1 mL) was quickly injected, and the reaction mixture was cooled down to 0 °C rapidly using an ice-water bath after stirring for 5–10 s.
2.4 Synthesis of Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 PNCs
The synthesis process of Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 PNCs is similar to that in Section 2.3 except for the addition of iron salts (50 mole percentage of iron salts compared to lead salts). The Pb element was unified to 0.4 mmol for all samples, and the details are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
2.5 Isolation and purification of PNCs
The obtained PNCs can usually be precipitated from crude solution without the aid of an antisolvent and the purification process is as follows.
(1) The crude reaction mixture was first centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to discard the supernatant containing the unreacted precursor and byproducts. After that, the obtained precipitate was dispersed into a mixed solvent (24 mL) containing EA and hexane with a volume ratio of 3:1. The mixture was centrifuged again for 10 min at 12000 rpm, and the precipitate was collected. Then, the precipitate was dispersed in hexane (24 mL) and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. Finally, the supernatant was collected as the stable colloidal CsPbBrI2 PNC solution.
* The above purification process cannot be used to precipitate CsPbBrI2 NCs synthesized at a 2:1 Fe/Pb feeding ratio, and thus the following purification process was used.
(2) The crude solution was added to antisolvent EA (36 mL) and was then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min to discard the supernatant. After that, the precipitate was dispersed in hexane (24 mL). The mixture was centrifuged again for 10 min at 12000 rpm, and the precipitate was collected. Then, the precipitate was dispersed in hexane (24 mL) and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. Finally, the supernatant was collected as the stable colloidal PNC solution.
2.6 Characterization of PNCs
The corresponding content of Fe2+ in PNCs was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700x, USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Smartlab8KW with Cu Kα radiation at 60 kV and 220 mA. The scan rate was 8° min−1 and the step size was 0.01°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) measurements were performed using a JEOL-2100F instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dropping the colloidal suspension onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film, followed by the evaporation of the solvent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a K-Alpha+ photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Britain). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The steady-state photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded using an FLS980 with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm at room temperature. Photoluminescence quantum yields were measured using an FLS980 spectrometer with an integrating sphere under the excitation of 400 nm UV light. The PL decay kinetics were measured using the FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed 375 nm laser at room temperature. Samples were prepared by dropping the PNC solution in 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes with airtight screw caps. Digital images were taken using a mobile phone camera of Vivo X60.
2.7 Quantum confinement energy of PNCs
The quantum confinement energy (ΔE) was calculated using Eqn 1, where r is the radius of NCs and m* is the exciton reduced mass.39 The calculated ΔE is listed in Table S2 (ESI†). (1)For the Br-2.4%, ΔEcal and ΔEPL are calculated by following formulas:ΔEcal = ΔEBr − ΔEPri = 10.96 × 10−3 − 6.19 × 10−3 = 4.77 × 10−3 eVΔEPL = hc/λBr − hc/λPri = 2.233 × 10−2 eV
* The exciton reduced mass is according to ref. 38. We use the exciton reduced mass of the CsPbI3 model to evaluate the confinement energy in the CsPbBrI2 model, and thus the calculated value is higher than the actual values.
2.8 Lifetime of PNCs
The lifetimes of CsPbBrI2 PNCs at 660 nm were fitted using bi-exponential decay kinetics: (2)And the average PL lifetimes (τav) were calculated based on the following equation: (3)To explore the kinetic decay process, the radiative rate of PNCs and its non-radiative decay rate are calculated by adopting the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and τav of the samples. The radiative recombination rate (Kr) and the non-radiative recombination rate (Knr) can be calculated:40 (4) (5)
3. Results and discussion
Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs were synthesized by a modified hot injection method first reported by Protesescu et al.39 By changing the iron sources including FeBr2, Fe(Ac)2, and FeF2, and fixing the feeding ratio (Fe/Pb= 1:2), three kinds of PNCs with red emission were obtained. For convenience, three Fe2+ doped PNCs are named PNC-Br, PNC-Ac and PNC-F, respectively.
In order to characterize the composition of the obtained NCs, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive spectra (HR-TEM-EDS) were obtained and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results revealed that all samples contain Cs, Pb, Br, and I. Besides, the newly emerging signals assigned to the Fe element confirmed the successful doping of Fe2+ in the obtained NCs.
To further examine the amount of Fe2+ incorporated into the resultant NCs, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was employed. The values of the Fe/Pb ratio for the actually incorporated iron ions in the PNCs were found to be 0%, 2.4%, 2.1%, and 1.7% for original PNC, PNC-Br, PNC-Ac and PNC-F, respectively. It should be noted that the Pb/(Br + I) ratio in the precursors for the synthesis of PNC-Br was 1:3 (FeBr2 not only provides Fe2+, but also supplements halide ions), while for the synthesis of PNC-Ac and PNC-F, the ratio was 1:2. Therefore, the higher iron content in PNC-Br could be attributed to the promotion effect of extra halide on metal doping.41 Excessive halide species in precursors could favor the formation of [Pb/FeX6]4− and provide more possibilities for Fe2+ to be incorporated into the lattice. The less iron content in PNC-F was probably due to the incomplete dissociation of FeF2. Due to the high dissociation energy required for the Fe–F bond, there were insoluble FeF2 particles present in the reaction system, which implied the insufficient participation of Fe2+ in the crystallization process. Hereafter, the Fe2+ doped PNCs are denoted as Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1%, and F-1.7% according to the values of Fe/Pb determined by ICP-MS.
To investigate the crystal structure of Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained, as shown in Fig. 2. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 14.3° and 29.0° correspond to the (100) and (200) planes, indicating the formation of cubic perovskites. It was reported that the introduction of doped ions sometimes induces phase transitions,29 but we did not observe diffraction peaks of other phases, indicating that iron doping could maintain the main structure of the perovskite. Enlarged XRD patterns (Fig. 2, right) showed a gradual shift in the peak position of (100) and (200) planes with the increase in the Fe2+ content, implying the gradual decrease of lattice parameters. It indicated the successful partial replacement of Pb2+ by Fe2+ in the lattices of CsPbBrI2 NCs.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of undoped CsPbBrI2 NCs, Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1%, and F-1.7%. Enlarged XRD patterns show a systematic shift in the peak position of (100) and (200) planes with Fe2+ doping. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images and the related particle size statistical chart of the undoped and Fe2+ doped PNCs were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3a–d and Fig. S2 (ESI†). All samples exhibited a cubic morphology, and the absence of other morphologies indicated that the addition of iron source would not lead to the formation of an impurity phase, which was in agreement with the results obtained in XRD characterization. The black spots observed on the surface were verified to be PbX2 produced by the decomposition of CsPbX3.42 Meanwhile, we noted that the addition of dopants could influence the size of PNCs. The average particle size of undoped PNCs, Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1% and F-1.7% was determined to be 20.2, 15.2, 18.5, and 16.1 nm, respectively. Compared with the undoped sample, Fe2+ doped PNCs exhibited a smaller particle size, but the particle size did not show a correlation with the iron content. In this case, the effects of the dopant anions should be considered. Acetates have been used as dopants for metal doping, and they do not have a significant influence on the particle size of perovskites.17,24,43,44 Therefore, compared with the undoped sample, the decreased size in PNC-Ac may be attributed to the increased formation energy induced by Fe2+ doping, which influenced the crystal process. Moreover, it was demonstrated that CH3COO− could passivate the dangling bonds on the surface of perovskites.44 However, in our experiments, there was no apparent change in FTIR peaks between the undoped and the Ac-2.1% samples (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating the absence of CH3COO− in Ac-2.1%. In addition, the smaller particle size observed in Br-2.4% and F-1.7% could be attributed to the inhibition of crystal growth caused by excessive halide species.

In HR-TEM images, the clear lattice fringes observed indicated the high crystallinity of NCs. Crystalline lattice constants for the (200) planes were calculated based on the HR-TEM results. With the change of iron content, the lattice constants decreased from 0.328 nm for the undoped sample to 0.317 nm for Br-2.4%, 0.321 nm for Ac-2.1% and 0.322 nm for F-1.7%, which correspond to a unit cell volume contraction of 3.4%, 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively. This lattice contraction further confirmed the presence of a smaller ionic radius of Fe2+ in the crystal lattice substituted for Pb2+.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to determine the electronic states of the main elements and investigate the influence of Fe2+ doping on the chemical interactions in CsPbBrI2 NCs. All XPS core level spectra are calibrated based on the C 1s peak at 284.80 eV shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). Based on XPS results, the Pb/(Br + I) atomic ratio was estimated to be 1:2.237, 1:2.890, 1:2.577, and 1:2.526 for undoped PNCs, Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1% and F-1.7%. Compared with that in the undoped sample, the modified Pb/X ratio in Fe2+ doped PNCs, which was closer to the stoichiometric ratio of 1:3, indicated that the Fe2+ doping inhibited the anion defects, thereby suppressing the octahedral distortion and improving the symmetry. In the high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 3f–i), the binding energies for Pb 4f, Br 3d, and I 3d in Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs shifted to higher binding energies, while the binding energies for Cs 3d only slightly changed, which indicated that Fe2+ doping influenced the lattice mainly by changing the chemical environment of [PbX6]4− octahedra. Therefore, based on the above results, it can be concluded that the partial substitution of Pb2+ by Fe2+ reduced the Pb–X bond length and thus led to the contraction of the [PbX6]4− octahedra. Meanwhile, this contraction could reduce the bending of Pb–X–Pb bonds, providing the possibility of improving the phase stability of perovskites.45 It is worth noting that we did not observe the signal peaks of Fe 2p, which could be attributed to the low content of iron on the surface. Interestingly, no F signal was observed in the HR-XPS spectrum of F-1.7% (Fig. S4b, ESI†), either.
The luminescence properties of the undoped and Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs were then investigated. The absorption and PL spectra of the undoped and Fe2+ doped PNCs, as well as the photographs of the corresponding NCs (dispersed in hexane) under UV-light (365 nm) irradiation, are shown in Fig. 4a. The PL peak of undoped PNCs appeared at 662.0 nm, while those of Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1%, and F-1.7% were at 654.2, 658.4 and 658.6 nm, respectively. Thus, compared with those of undoped PNCs, the absorption onset and PL peak of Fe2+ doped samples both exhibited a blueshift. It is known that size-induced quantum confinement effects and lattice changes will influence the band structure, and thus the photophysical properties of CsPbX3. Hence, we first evaluated the effect of quantum confinement effects. The exciton Bohr diameters (2a0) of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are 7 and 12 nm according to previous reports.39,46 Based on these values, in CsPbBrI2, 2a0 is approximately 10 nm. Therefore, the particle size of NCs observed in TEM fell under the weak quantum confinement regime, corresponding to the weak correlation between the size and band gap. We calculated the size dependence of the quantum confinement, and the results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The band gap change caused by quantum confinement was significantly lower than the PL energy difference. In this case, the effect of dopant-induced lattice contraction on the band structure of CsPbBrI2 NCs should be considered. The lattice contraction induced by Fe2+ doping strengthens the ligand field of the [PbX6]4− octahedra, resulting in the blue shift of the PL peak.31

(c) Time-resolved photoluminescence decays for excitonic luminescence of the samples upon excitation by a 375 nm pulsed laser. 
The PLQYs and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement were then carried out to investigate the influence of Fe2+ doping on the relaxation process of CsPbBrI2 NCs. The PLQY of undoped CsPbBrI2 NCs was measured to be 69.2%, which was comparable to the results reported in the literature.24 Compared with undoped PNCs, the Fe2+ doped samples showed a stronger red emission with a PLQY of ∼90% (Fig. 4b). The highest PLQY of 92.1% was obtained for Br-2.4%, indicating that both halide passivation and Fe2+ doping have an effect on the improvement of PLQY. The TRPL spectra were obtained under excitation at 375 nm, and PL decay curves could be well fitted with a biexponential decay function (see Experimental section 2.8 for details and also see Fig. 4c), and consisted of two components (Table S3, ESI†). It was found that the PL lifetime significantly decreased from 144.6 ns for undoped CsPbBrI2 NCs to 67.4 ns for Br-2.4%, 71.2 ns for Ac-2.1% and 92.2 ns for F-1.7%, respectively, indicating that Fe2+ doping accelerated the exciton recombination process in CsPbBrI2 NCs. The radiative (Kr) and nonradiative (Knr) decay rates estimated from the PLQYs and average PL lifetimes (τav) are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Notably, compared with that of the undoped sample, the Kr of Br-2.4%, Ac-2.1%, and F-1.7% increased by 2.9, 2.6 and 2.0-fold, and the change of Kr exhibited a consistent trend with the Fe2+ content. Therefore, the significantly enchanced Kr is the main factor for the the acceleration of exciton recombination. Moreover, it was found that Knr reduced after the Fe2+ doping process. The decreased Knr could be related to the fewer non-radiative decay channels, implying that Fe2+ doping passivated the non-radiative traps, thereby inhibiting the non-radiative recombination process.24,40 The accelerated radiation recombination process and the suppressed non-radiative recombination process induced by Fe2+ doping showed that the relaxation process of CsPbBrI2 was optimized, thus contributing to the enhancement of the PLQY.
Metal ion doping is considered to be an effective strategy for modifying the intrinsic properties of perovskites and reducing lead toxicity. However, among the three Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs, the iron content was merely ∼2%, which made Fe2+ doped perovskites insignificant for reducing the lead toxicity. To obtain PNCs with a higher doping content and further investigate the effect of a higher Fe2+ doping content on the structure and performance of PNCs, we increased the Fe/Pb feed ratio to 2:1 and synthesized Fe2+ doped PNCs named Br-2 (see Table S1 for synthesis, ESI†). The structure and performance of Br-2 was carefully studied, and the relavent disscussion is shown in Discussion 1 (ESI†).
The stability of both undoped and Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs was evaluated under the ambient (25 °C with 20% relative humidity) and UV-light (365 nm, 24 W) irradiation conditions, as shown in Fig. 5. The time-dependent PLQY results of CsPbBrI2 NCs in hexane showed that all Fe2+ doped PNCs maintained more than 60% of the initial PLQYs when exposed to ambient conditions for 5 weeks, while only 30% for the undoped sample remained (Fig. 5a and b). After 6 days exposure to UV-light irradiation, the PLQY decreased to 18% of the initial value for undoped PNCs, 60% for Br-2.4%, 53% for Ac-2.1%, and 52% for F-1.7% (Fig. 5c). The UV-light stability of PNCs films was also investigated by coating the fresh colloidal CsPbBrI2 NCs solution onto cleaned glass slides. With the extension of storage time, the luminescence of PNCs experienced a transition from red to orange and eventually to green (Fig. 5h), corresponding to the shift of the PL peak from 661 nm to 554 nm (Fig. 5d), which could be have resulted from the phase separation of CsPbBrI2 NCs under UV irradiation and humid conditions. In addition, the phase separation of CsPbBrI2 was accompanied by a sharp decrease in the PL intensity and the broadening of the PL peak, indicating the generation of crystal defects and distortion of [PbX6]4− octahedra under UV irradiation. Owing to the low migration energies, halide ions would be activated under UV irradiation and migrate to form halide-rich regions, and crystal defects played a role in assisting the motion of halide ions during this process.47 The high density of halide vacancies in the undoped sample, as confirmed by XPS results, facilated the halide ion migration, rusulting in the severe phase separation. Encouragingly, the Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs still maintain red emission with more than 54% PL intensity, and no shoulder peaks appeared under the same conditions (Fig. 5e–g). The superior UV stability of Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs could be attributed to the fewer surface and internal defects, which suppressed the photo-induced ion migration and lattice distortion. Modulated by the synergistic effect of halide passivation and Fe2+ doping, Br-2.4% possessed a modified Pb/X ratio and solidly adjacent [PbX6]4− modules, and thus the corresponding film showed the best UV-light stability, mataining more than 70% of the initial PL intensity after 10 days of UV radiation (Fig. 5e). Besides, we also evaluated the purification stability from the perspective of changes in size and luminescence properties, and compared with undoped PNCs and observed that Fe2+ doped PNCs maintained a more stable structure in the presence of antisolvent EA (ee Discussion 2, ESI†). These results demonstrated that Fe2+ doping greatly improved the ambient, light and purification stabilities of the CsPbBrI2 NCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Fe2+ doped CsPbBrI2 NCs were obtained through a simple hot injection method by directly adding iron salts (FeBr2, Fe(Ac)2, and FeF2) to the precursor and systematic investigation of Fe2+ doping on the luminescence performance and stability of CsPbBrI2 NCs was performed. Owing to the smaller ionic size, Fe2+ induced the lattice contraction and shortened the bond length of Pb–X, which suppressed the distortion of [PbX6]4− octahedra, thus improving the stability of CsPbBrI2 NCs. Besides, the incorporation of Fe2+ suppressed the formation of halide vacancies and optimized the relaxation process of CsPbBrI2, thereby contributing to the enhancement of the PLQY. Meanwhile, the effect of dopant anions on the structure and performance of perovskites was also considered. Boosted by the synergistic effect of halide passivation and Fe2+ doping, the CsPbBrI2 NCs with a maximum PLQY of 92.1% were obtained, which showed superior ambient, light and purification stabilities. This facile Fe2+ doping method provides an effective strategy to synthesize stable and highly photoluminescent red perovskites.
