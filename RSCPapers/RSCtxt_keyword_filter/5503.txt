    , Accepted 19th October 2010First published on 30th November 2010AbstractOrganized mesoporous TiO2 films with high porosity and good connectivity were synthesized via sol–gel by templating an amphiphilic graft copolymer consisting of poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) side chains, i.e., PVC-g-POEM. The randomly microphase-separated graft copolymer was self-reorganized to exhibit a well-ordered micellar morphology upon controlling polymer–solvent interactions, as confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and glazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). These organized mesoporous TiO2 films, 550 nm in thickness, were used an an interfacial layer between a nanocrystalline TiO2 thick layer and a conducting glass in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Introduction of the organized mesoporous TiO2 layer resulted in the increased transmittance of visible light, decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced electron lifetime. As a result, an energy conversion efficiency of DSSC employing polymer electrolyte was significantly improved from 3.5% to 5.0% at 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received attention recently due to their low cost and high efficiency, and have been perceived as a good alternative to silicon solar cells since they were first proposed by the Grätzel group in 1991.1 DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 layer, a Pt layer, and an electrolyte containing a redox couple. An energy conversion efficiency of 11% has been achieved in DSSCs with an organic liquid-based electrolyte containing I3−/I− as a redox couple.2 The performances of DSSCs can be improved by developing, modifying or improving any of the following: the dye,2,3 the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer,4,5 the thermal-resistance transparent conducting oxide (TCO),6 the electrolyte7,8 or the electrode–electrolyte interface.9,10 In particular, controlling the structure of the TiO2 films plays a crucial role in determining the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs because it influences the quantity of dye adsorbed and the electron transport. Thus, much prior research has focused on the relationship between nanocrystalline TiO2 structure and energy conversion efficiency.11–16
In general, porous nanocrystalline TiO2 films have been prepared by a colloid solution where the TiO2 nanoparticles are dispersed in a solvent. However, incomplete dispersion and aggregation of particles frequently cause poor interfacial contact between the TiO2 layer and the TCO layer, leading to poor electron transfer. One of the methods for enhancing interfacial properties is introducing a thin interfacial (or buffer) layer between the thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and the TCO layer.17–19 For example, organized mesoporous TiO2 thin films have been utilized as an interfacial layer, which results in an improvement in energy conversion efficiency due to increased transmittance of visible light and better adhesion between the SnO2/F-layered conductive glass (FTO) and the main TiO2 layer.20–23
In general, organized mesoporous TiO2 films have been synthesized via a sol–gel process using an amphiphilic block copolymer, e.g., a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based template.24–30 For example, Coakley et al.24 prepared porous TiO2 films with a uniform pore size and without any aggregation of the particles using a Pluronic poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PPO) triblock copolymer (P123) as a structure-directing agent. Our group recently synthesized organized mesoporous TiO2 films using an amphiphilic graft copolymer consisting of poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) side chains, i.e., PVC-g-POEM,31 which is more attractive than block copolymers due to its low cost and facile synthetic method.32,33 As a result, a solid-state DSSC employing the organized 700 nm thick TiO2 film exhibited a solar conversion efficiency of 2.2% at 100 mW cm−2, which was approximately two-fold higher than that attained from a DSSC employing a random TiO2 film.31
In this work, microphase-separated PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer with a well-ordered micellar morphology was templated to synthesize organized mesoporous TiO2 films via a sol–gel process which involved controlling polymer–solvent interactions. Synthesized films were characterized in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and glazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). In particular, organized TiO2 thin films with different porosity and pore size were prepared by carefully changing the mole ratio of [TTIP]:[H2O]:[HCl]. The organized TiO2 thin films were utilized as an interfacial layer in DSSCs and the influence of the material structure on photovoltaic performance was investigated. Detailed properties of materials were systematically characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), non-contact three-dimensional (3D) surface profilometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
Experiment
Materials

          Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC, Mw = 97000 g mol−1, Mn = 55000 g mol−1), poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, Mn = 475 g mol−1), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, 37 wt%), 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylene tetramine (HMTETA, 99%), and copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99%), fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2, 14 nm), poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME, Mn = 500 g mol−1) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Aldrich. 1-Methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII, C7H13N2I) and ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), and methanol were obtained from J. T. Baker. All solvents and chemicals were reagent grade and used as received.
Synthesis of the graft copolymer
PVC (6 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of NMP by stirring at 90 °C for 4 h. After cooling the solution to room temperature, 15 g of POEM, 0.1 g of CuCl, and 0.23 mL of HMTETA were added to the solution. The green mixtures were stirred until homogeneous, and were purged with nitrogen for 30 min. The reaction was carried out at 90 °C for 18 h. After polymerization, the resultant mixtures were diluted with THF. After passing the solutions through a column with activated Al2O3 to remove the catalyst, the solutions were precipitated into methanol. The grafted copolymers were purified by dissolving in THF and reprecipitating into methanol three times. PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer with PVC:POEM = 4:6 wt% ratio was obtained in a powder form and dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature.
Preparation of the mesoporous TiO2 films
A series of samples was prepared by varying the mole ratio of [TTIP]:[H2O]:[HCl] from 2:1:0, 2:0.5:0.5 to 2:1:1. A solution was prepared by slowly adding HCl (37 wt%) to TTIP under vigorous stirring. Additional DI water was slowly added to the TTIP solution. Separately, 0.05 g of PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer was dissolved in 1.5 mL of THF and added to 0.6 g of the TTIP/HCl/THF solution. These solutions were aged by stirring at ambient temperature for at least 3 h. The films were deposited onto a FTO conducting glass using a SMSS Delta 80BM spin coater at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Upon calcination at 450 °C for 30 min, the organic chemicals were completely removed to produce the mesoporous TiO2 thin films. The dense TiO2 film with 100 nm thickness was prepared using spin coating of titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide solution (2 wt% in butanol) at 1500 rpm for 10 s, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min.
Characterization
UV–vis spectroscopy was performed with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) in the range of 300 to 800 nm. Morphologies of the mesoporous TiO2 films were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SUPRA 55VP, Germany, Carl Zeiss), and by a non contact 3D surface profiler (NANO View-E1000, Nanosystem). Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) (Nanoscope IV, Digital Instruments) was used to examine the morphologies of TiO2 films. Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments were performed at the 4C2 beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Pohang, Korea. The operating conditions were set to a wavelength of 0.138 nm and a sample-to-detector distance of 2.5 m. The samples were mounted in a vacuum chamber, and the incident angles were set at 0.16° or 0.18°, which are above the critical angle (0.135°) of thin films.
Fabrication of the DSSCs
DSSCs were fabricated according to the previously reported procedure.31–33 Transparent SnO2/F-layered conductive glass (FTO, Pilkington. Co. Ltd., 8 Ω/□) was employed in order to prepare both the photo and counter electrodes. The sol–gel solutions containing the graft copolymer and different amounts of [TTIP]:[H2O]:[HCl] were spin-coated onto the FTO glass and were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, commercialized TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T, Solaronix) was cast onto the TiO2 thin film coated FTO glass by a doctor-blade technique, followed by successive sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The nanocrystalline TiO2 films were sensitized overnight in a Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2 dye (dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) solution (535-bisTBA, Solaronix, 13 mg, dissolved in 50 g distilled ethanol). Pt-layered counter-electrodes were prepared by spin-coating a 1 wt% H2PtCl6 solution in isopropanol onto the FTO glass and then sintering the film at 450 °C for 30 min. Polymer electrolyte solutions consisting of PEGDME, SiO2, MPII and I2 dissolved in THF were cast onto a dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and evaporated very slowly to allow penetration of the electrolytes through the mesopores of the TiO2 layer. The mole ratio of ether oxygen to iodide salt was fixed at 20, and the iodine content was fixed at 10 wt% with respect to the salt.32,33 Both electrodes were then superposed together and pressed between two glass plates in order to achieve both slow evaporation of the solvent and a thin electrolyte layer. The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for 1 day for complete evaporation of the solvent.
The photoelectrochemical performance, including the short-circuit current (Jsc, mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc, V), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η) were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 source meter and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light was homogeneous up to an 8 × 8 in2 area and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate No. C-ISE269) for 1 sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The intensity was verified with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.). Photoelectrochemical performance was calculated using the following equations: (1) (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of maximum power output.
Results and discussion
Templated synthesis of organized TiO2 films by graft copolymer
A hydrophilic–hydrophobic microphase-separated graft copolymer is critical for synthesizing well-organized mesoporous TiO2 films. Upon casting using tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is a good solvent for both polymer chains, randomly microphase-separated domains of PVC main chains and POEM side chains with approximately 100 nm of d-spacing were observed without regular patterns (Fig. 1a, b), which is a common morphology for graft copolymers.34–38 The large difference in the physicochemical properties between the PVC and POEM chains provides the AFM image contrast between the two domains. In phase images, bright regions represent the hydrophobic domains of the glassy PVC main chains whose glass transition temperature (Tg) is 70 °C, whereas dark regions show the hydrophilic, rubbery POEM side chains whose Tg is −58 °C.33 Upon carefully tuning polymer–solvent interactions using a THF–H2O/HCl mixture, well-organized micelles of the graft copolymer were obtained with a more regular arrayed structure (Fig. 1c, d). Since the THF–H2O/HCl mixture is a poor solvent for the PVC chains, the interfacial energy between the PVC chains and the solvent would be increased, leading to reduced swelling of the PVC main chains and increased stretching of the POEM side chains. As a result, the PVC chains aggregated to form a core of micelles whereas the POEM chains formed a continuous corona outside the core.39 The average sizes of the isolated PVC core in the graft copolymer micelles were estimated to be 32 nm.

Height was 10 nm and the phase angle was 30°. The mole ratio of [TTIP]:[H2O]:[HCl] was 2:0.5:0.5. 
The well-organized PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer was used as a structure directing agent to synthesize mesoporous TiO2 films via a sol–gel process using a titanium precursor, i.e., titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), as represented in Scheme 1. Upon calcination at 450 °C, well-organized mesoporous TiO2 films were obtained with an average pore size of 29 nm (Fig. 1e, f). Strong similarities in the spatial distribution patterns were observed between the well-organized PVC-g-POEM (Fig. 1c, d) and the mesoporous TiO2 film (Fig. 1e, f). This indicates that TTIP is selectively incorporated in the hydrophilic POEM domains, and TiO2 crystallites are formed in situ during calcination, originating from favorable interactions between TTIP and POEM. Moreover, the pore size (29 nm) of the TiO2 film did not greatly differ from that of the PVC core (32 nm) of the well-organized PVC-g-POEM, demonstrating that the graft copolymer functioned as a robust and precise structure-directing agent.

GISAXS has been well established as an experimental technique to complement the structural analysis obtained from the microscopy images because it gives information over a large area.40–42 Moreover, GISAXS is a versatile tool for correlating nanoscale density within the film and the structure of the film.40 Although the GISAXS profile overlapped to some degree with the beam stop, a broad shoulder peak at around q ≈ 0.1 nm−1, which corresponds to the domain spacing of 63 nm, was observed for the organized PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer, indicating a microphase-separated structure (Fig. 2a). Upon combining the organized PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer and the titanium precursor (TTIP) before calcination, a scattering peak centered at 0.128 nm−1 appeared, corresponding to a d-spacing of 49 nm (Fig. 2b). After calcination at 450 °C, the scattering peak became more intense and the scattering vector (q) shifted to a lower value at 0.116 nm−1 (54 nm), indicating the formation of a more regular structure and the increase of d-spacing in the TiO2 thin films (Fig. 2c).

Characterization of the organized TiO2 interfacial layers
The organized TiO2 films were used as an interfacial layer in DSSCs to increase the energy conversion efficiency. In particular, the structure of the TiO2 film was carefully controlled by changing the mole ratio of [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] to investigate the effect of morphology of TiO2 film on the transmittance of FTO glass and interfacial properties. The variation in morphology as a function of the composition of [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] was characterized using SEM, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. A less-organized morphology with a low porosity and a smaller pore size (which is referred to as orgTiO2-1) was obtained at lower water content, i.e., [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] = 2:1:0 (Fig. 3a), whereas the well-organized morphology with a high porosity and a bigger pore size (orgTiO2-3) was obtained at higher water content, i.e., [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] = 2:1:1 (Fig. 3c), indicating the importance of water concentration in determining TiO2 morphology. When prepared with [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] = 2:0.5:0.5 (orgTiO2-2 in Fig. 3b), the morphology of the TiO2 film exhibited an intermediate porosity and pore size, which fell between orgTiO2-1 in Fig. 3a and orgTiO2-3 in Fig. 3c.

All the mesoporous TiO2 films were highly transparent irrespective of the composition whereas a randomly oriented TiO2 (Ti-Nanoxide D20, Solaronix) film of a similar thickness was opaque, as seen in Fig. 4. It suggests the homogeneously organized mesoporous structure of TiO2, and provides a direct indication that TTIP grew confined within the POEM domains of the microphase-separated graft copolymer, as presented in Scheme 1.

A 550 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 interfacial layer was deposited as a buffer layer between the FTO and the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. The nanocrystalline TiO2 layer was coated onto the buffer layer with a thickness of 4 μm using commercial TiO2 paste, as shown in Fig. 5. As shown, good interfacial contact between the FTO and mesoporous TiO2 was achieved. Fig. 6 shows the non-contact 3D surface profiler SEM images for the bare FTO surface and well-organized TiO2 coated FTO. The root-mean-square roughness of the bare FTO was significantly reduced from 8.4 to 3.2 nm by the deposition of the mesoporous TiO2 thin film. This result indicates an improvement in interfacial adherence between the mesoporous TiO2 layer and the TCO, leading to a decreased interfacial resistance.

The transmittance spectra of the bare FTO and the mesoporous TiO2 coated FTO samples were measured, as shown in Fig. 7. Three kinds of buffer layers were compared: the compact dense buffer layer, the organized TiO2 layers of orgTiO2-1 in Fig. 3a and orgTiO2-3 in Fig. 3c. The transmittance of the dense TiO2 layer coated FTO was slightly higher than that of bare FTO glass, probably due to the increased uniformity of the FTO surface. Interestingly, the transmittance of FTO was further increased by the deposition of the organized mesoporous TiO2 thin films. The orgTiO2-1 coated FTO exhibited slightly higher transmittance than orgTiO2-3 due to the lower porosity of the former as shown in Fig. 3. This antireflective role of the buffer layer on the DSSC performance, especially its influence on the short circuit current (Jsc), was investigated using photovoltaic I–V characteristic analysis.

Effect of the organized TiO2 interfacial layers on DSSC performance
Solid-state DSSCs were fabricated using the organized TiO2 thin films as an interfacial layer, polymer electrolytes consisting of poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME), fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII) and I2.43 The J–V curves of DSSCs with and without the different kinds of buffer layers are presented in Fig. 8, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. A general trend is the improvement of photocurrent density by the introduction of buffer layer, resulting in the enhancement of energy conversion efficiency irrespective of the kind of buffer layer. For example, the DSSC fabricated without a buffer layer exhibited an efficiency of 3.5% at 100 mW cm−2, which was always increased by the introduction of a buffer layer. In particular, the DSSC efficiency was enhanced up to 5.0% and 4.3% for the orgTiO2-1 and orgTiO2-3 films, respectively. These improvements are even higher than that achieved using the dense TiO2 film, indicating the importance of mesoporous structure in the interfacial layer. The improved efficiency mostly results from the increase in Jsc, which is partially due to the enhanced transmittance of visible light through the FTO glass, as confirmed in Fig. 7. Another possible reason for the efficiency enhancement is the improved interfacial properties between the FTO glass and the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer, which were characterized using EIS analysis. Under the fast electron transfer due to the significant increase of Jsc, ion transfer through polymer electrolytes might be limited to some degree, resulting in a slight decrease in fill factor (FF). According to Nogueira's previous work,44 the low ionic mobility causes the generation of concentration gradients in a polymer electrolyte, especially at high current densities, leading to a decrease in FF.

The efficiency of DSSC also depends strongly on the amount of dye adsorption, which is related, in turn, to the surface area and porosity of the TiO2 photoelectrode. Thus, the dye adsorption of the organized TiO2 thin films were measured by adsorption-desorption experiments.31,32 The amount of dye adsorption was different depending on the kind of organized TiO2 thin films and arranged in the following order: orgTiO2-3 (12.8 nmol cm−2) ≃ orgTiO2-2 (12.7 nmol cm−2) > orgTiO2-1 (9.8 nmol cm−2). This result is consistent with the porosity and pore size of organized TiO2 film; the lower dye adsorption of orgTiO2-1 film is attributed to a low porosity and a smaller pore size whereas the higher dye adsorption of orgTiO2-3 film is due to a high porosity and a bigger pore size, as confirmed by SEM analysis. However, the DSSC efficiency exhibited the reverse order; orgTiO2-1 (5.0%) > orgTiO2-2 (4.8%) > orgTiO2-3 (4.3%). In addition, the dye adsorption of the organized TiO2 thin films is much smaller than that of nanocrystalline TiO2 thick layer (∼100 nmol cm−2). It is thus concluded that the dye adsorption of the organized mesoporous TiO2 thin films does not contribute to the DSSC performance significantly.

EIS analysis was used to investigate the interfacial properties, internal resistance and charge-transfer kinetics of nanocrystalline TiO2 layers in DSSCs.45 An applied bias of Voc at a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz was used, with an AC amplitude of 0.2 V and a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist plots, Bode phase plots and equivalent circuit of DSSCs with and without different buffer layers. Electrochemical parameters determined from EIS analysis, i.e., resistance values (Rs, R1, R2, and Ws), minimum angular frequency (ωmin) and lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr), are summarized in Table 2. The impedance spectra can be interpreted and modeled using equivalent circuits, with each component explained below. Each equivalent circuit consisted of several components: ohmic resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance at the counterelectrode/electrolyte (R1), charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte (R2), resistance at the Warburg diffusion of the redox I−/I3− couple in electrolyte (Ws), the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R1 (CPE1), and the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R2 (CPE2).46 In Fig. 9(a), the Nyquist spectra of the DSSCs showed three semicircles: the first semicircle, in the high-frequency region, represents R1; the second semicircle, in the middle-frequency region, represents R2; the third semicircle, in the low-frequency region, represents Ws, and the curve from the origin to first semicircle starting point on the left represents Rs. These four internal impedances have a direct effect on the electron transport mechanism in DSSCs. As a consequence, the cell performance of the DSSCs is improved when the sum of the resistance components (Rs, R1, R2, and Ws) is small.

As seen in Table 2, both Rs and R1 of the DSSCs without a buffer layer were not significantly different from those of DSSCs with buffer layers, indicating that the introduction of a buffer layer has little effect on FTO glass resistance and on charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte. However, both R2 and Ws were decreased by the introduction of the buffer layer, indicating a decrease in charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte and the resistance related to Warburg diffusion of the I−/I3−redox couple in the electrolyte. In particular, R2 and Ws decreased from 28.1 Ω to 20.3 Ω and from 33.3 to 27.7 Ω, respectively, when the orgTiO2-3 layer was utilized, indicating the important role of organized TiO2 films in determining the interfacial properties of DSSCs.
According to the EIS model, the lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr) in the TiO2 photoelectrode can be estimated from the minimum angular frequency (ωmin) value of the impedance semicircle at middle frequencies in the Bode spectrum, according to the relationship: τr = 1/ωmin.47 As seen in Fig. 9b, the middle frequencies in the Bode spectra of DSSCs without a buffer layer shifted to lower frequencies upon the introduction of a buffer layer. As a result, the electron recombination lifetime values (τr) for DSSCs were increased by the utilization of the buffer layer. In particular, a τr of 39.8 ms for DSSCs without a buffer layer increased up to 71.9 ms when orgTiO2-1 or dense TiO2 films were used. This could effectively decrease electron recombination, leading to significantly enhanced electron transfer and, thus, an improved Jsc value. This can also improve adhesion properties between the main nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and FTO that significantly affect the electron transfer or electron recombination at the interface of FTO/TiO2. Therefore, DSSC efficiency could be improved significantly by the introduction of a buffer layer, in particular, the organized TiO2 film.
Conclusions

AFM and GISAXS analysis showed that a randomly microphase-separated graft copolymer was successfully reorganized to show a well-ordered micellar morphology by controlling solvent affinity using a THF–H2O/HCl mixture. Well-organized mesoporous TiO2 films with high porosity and good connectivity were developed via the sol–gel process using an organized PVC-g-POEM amphiphilic graft copolymer. In particular, organized TiO2 thin films with different morphologies were prepared by carefully changing the mole ratio of [TTIP]:[H2O]:[HCl]. A organized TiO2 film with a lower porosity and smaller pore size (orgTiO2-1) was obtained at a lower water content, i.e. [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] = 2:1:0, whereas the TiO2 film with a higher porosity and bigger pores (orgTiO2-3) was prepared at higher water content, i.e., [TTIP]:[HCl]:[H2O] = 2:1:1. The organized TiO2 thin films were used as an interfacial layer in DSSCs, and the influence of the material structure on photovoltaic performance was then investigated. The root-mean-square roughness of the FTO substrate was dramatically reduced from 8.4 to 3.2 nm by the deposition of mesoporous TiO2 thin films, indicating an improvement in interfacial adherence between the mesoporous TiO2 layer and TCO, as confirmed by noncontact 3D surface profiler SEM images. By introducing the organized TiO2 thin films as an interfacial layer in DSSCs, Jsc significantly increased from 8.8 up to 13.7 mA cm−2, thus improving the photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 3.5% up to 5.0%, at 100 mW cm−2 for solid-state DSSCs employing PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2polymer electrolytes. EIS analysis showed that the interfacial resistance of the DSSC with the orgTiO2-3 film was smaller than that with the orgTiO2-1, but the electron recombination lifetime of the former was shorter than the latter. Moreover, the antireflective capability of the orgTiO2-1 thin film was slightly higher than that of the orgTiO2-3 film. As a result, the efficiency of the DSSC fabricated with the orgTiO2-1 thin film as an interfacial layer was higher than that with the orgTiO2-3 film, indicating the importance of the morphology of the organized TiO2 thin film.
