    , Accepted 29th March 2012First published on 25th April 2012AbstractWe present here the photovoltaic performance of dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using sub-micron sized mesoporous TiO2 aggregates which incorporate built-in multi-functional properties such as high dye uptake, efficient light scattering and enhanced charge collection. The DSC prepared with these mesoporous anatase TiO2 aggregates as photoanode with no additional scattering layer exhibits an enhanced conversion efficiency of 9.00% at 1 sun and 10.84% at 0.16 sun illumination. The properties of the photoanode film in DSCs were analyzed by surface area, diffuse reflectance, intensity modulated photocurrent/voltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in order to gain knowledge of the decisive factors contributing to such high power conversion efficiency. The present study reveals that the mesoporous aggregate offers large internal surface area and high light scattering with its unique structure. Due to the high crystallinity and compact packing of primary nanocrystallites forming the aggregate structure of mesoporous TiO2, the electron diffusion length is substantially long reflecting a lower number of electrons trapped at the grain boundaries. A good compromise of electron transport time and extended life time in mesoporous aggregate films compared to their non-aggregate counterparts leads to efficient charge collection and higher power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as low-cost photovoltaic devices are currently the subject of intensive research for solar energy conversion in the framework of renewable energy sources for climate change mitigation. DSCs have reached a record power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.3%.1 This unique photo-electrochemical solar cell based on a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode sensitized with light-harvesting dye molecules, which stay in contact with an electrolyte containing the I3−/I− redox shuttle, is on the verge of commercialization offering an interesting alternative for the existing silicon based solar cells as well as thin film solar cells.2 At the same time the research development as well as the industrial interest around this solar cell technology is growing rapidly. During the operating conditions of DSCs, the photo-generated electrons are injected from the excited state of the dye molecules into the conduction band of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film. The injected electrons then diffuse through the TiO2 nanoparticle network and then pass through the external load generating electricity. The oxidized dye molecules are regenerated by electron donation from positive ions in the redox shuttle which in turn are regenerated by neutralization of positive ions with the electrons passing through the external circuit received at the counter electrode.1,2 Besides photon absorption and electron generation, the electron transport and recombination occur in competition and are known as key factors determining the performance of DSCs. In principle, rapid electron transport and slow recombination will favour a high solar energy conversion efficiency.2d,3 The above mentioned processes, viz. photoelectron generation, transport and recombination, primarily depend on the structure of the TiO2 photoanode, which is thus considered as the backbone of DSCs. Besides transporting electrons to the positive contact, the TiO2 photoanode also offers large surface area for greater dye adsorption and facilitates electrolyte diffusion within its pores. Therefore, optimizing the microstructure of the photoanode is vital for developing highly efficient DSCs. Traditionally, a bifunctional TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 1a) comprising a nanocrystalline transparent layer (TL) of tiny particles of 20 nm diameter in combination with a light scattering layer (SL) formed using large particles of 400 nm have been employed to achieve high efficiencies.4 The SL on top efficaciously promotes the light trapping within the TL by back-scattering of transmitted light. Therefore, bifunctional photo-anodes are undoubtedly in wide use for fabricating efficient DSCs. However, the SL does not generate as much current because of low dye adsorption and increased recombination losses due to electron trapping at numerous grain boundaries of particles.5–7 Hence, this structure would not be the best choice. It is therefore worth designing nanostructured TiO2 offering multiple functions, such as high dye loading, efficient light-trapping, enhanced electron transport and lifetimes etc. Recently, much effort has been focused on developing such multi-functional TiO2 nanostructures for application as the core layer or SL in the photoanodes of DSCs.8–15,32Fig. 1b presents a schematic representation of such a multi-functional photoanode which consists of submicron-sized TiO2 aggregates formed by intimately connected nano-grains with mesopores, providing a large internal surface area. Such a mesoporous structure favours large uptake of dye molecules, hence more photoexcited electron generation. In addition these structures exhibit significant light-scattering properties.9 Also, good intra-grain connectivity promotes facile charge transport within the mesoporous TiO2 aggregates. While addressing the above features of multi-functional photoanodes, most studies focused on the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous TiO2 pristine samples. Little or no attention has been paid to the study of characteristics of the processed photoanode films such as textural properties, optical properties, electron transport and recombination kinetics of mesoporous TiO2 in detail. We previously reported the synthesis of such mesoporous TiO2 aggregates by a simple, low-cost method which can be easily employed for mass production, and presented the structural and photovoltaic properties with a conversion efficiency of 7.50%.16 In this contribution, we report an elevated performance of 9.00% conversion efficiency obtained by employing an improved method of preparation of films using a screen printing technique. Further, we depict several materialistic properties of these mesoporous aggregate structures with respect to the elevated device performance. A quantitative comparison of charge transport and recombination properties of mesoporous aggregate TiO2 (MPT) based photoanodes to those of typical non-aggregate TiO2 (NPT) based photoanodes in DSCs has been made. The electron collection efficiencies and diffusion lengths of MPT-DSCs and NPT-DSCs are analyzed using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Experimental
Synthesis of mesoporous titania and screen printable pastes
Mesoporous titania aggregates were synthesized by sol–gel processing of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and titanium iso-propoxide in a water–ethanol mixture and subsequent sintering in air at 450 °C for 6 h as reported previously.16 Here, CTAB acts as a structure-directing as well as a pore-forming agent. Screen printable titania paste was prepared by mixing a certain known quantity of synthesized titania powder with two different types of ethyl cellulose, EC1 (5–15 mPa s) and EC2 (30–50 mPa s), in the proportion of 28 wt% and 46 wt% of titania respectively. An appropriate quantity of anhydrous terpineol was added carefully to obtain a viscous paste. A few drops of acetyl acetone were added to prevent re-aggregation of TiO2. A paste of NPT (P25, Degussa) was also prepared following a similar procedure.
Device fabrication
The photoanode films were prepared by a screen printing technique as described in ref. 4. Prior to coating, a 2.2 mm thick fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8–10 Ω/□) glass substrate was cleaned by sequential sonication for 5, 5 and 20 min in 5% Decon 90 solution, distilled water and absolute ethanol, respectively. The cleaned FTO substrate was immersed into 40 mM TiCl4 (aq) at 70 °C for 30 min to form a compact blocking layer and then washed with water and ethanol. After drying, the substrate was coated with a layer of prepared paste (MPT or NPT) by screen printing and kept in a clean box for 5 min and finally dried for 6 min at 120 °C. This screen printing procedure was repeated a few times until we achieved the desired thickness. For some electrodes, a scattering layer (∼4 μm) of titania particles (WERO-4, Dyesol, Australia) was screen printed on top of the dried layers of MPT or NPT. The electrodes coated with the TiO2 pastes were gradually heated to 500 °C and sintered for 30 min. For post-modification of the TiO2 surface, the sintered electrodes were subjected to identical TiCl4 treatment as described previously, then rinsed with water and ethanol and sintered again at 500 °C for 15 min. For a good comparison the untreated electrode was also sintered again under similar conditions. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were soaked in an ethanol solution of 0.3 mM N3 dye (Solaronix, SA) for 15 h at room temperature. The dye-coated TiO2 films were washed with ethanol, dried and then assembled with a Pt coated counter electrode prepared by thermal decomposition of 10 mM H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol at 390 °C for 20 min. The two active electrodes were separated with a 60 μm thick Surlyn (Solaronix, SA) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum backfilling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode, which was pre-drilled in advance with a sand-blasting drill, was sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. The electrolyte used for fabrication of the device consists of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in the mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15). The cells were stored in the dark for 24 h prior to the measurement.
Characterization of photoanode films
The crystallinity of the films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu, Japan) measurement using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.154056 nm). The intensity data was measured by step scanning in the 2θ range between 20° and 70°, with a 2θ step size of 0.02° and a measuring time of 3 s per point. The average crystallite size and relative weight percentage of the anatase and rutile phases in the films were calculated via the Rietveld refinement method using TOPAS version 3 software. FESEM (Jeol JSM-7000F) was used to study the morphology of the films. The thickness of TiO2 layers was determined by profilometry measurement made using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on a Nova 2200e surface area and pore analyzer (Quantachrome, USA). Prior to the measurement, all the samples were outgassed at 130 °C overnight. The specific surface area was calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.30. The total pore volume was estimated from the amount of gas adsorbed at a relative pressure of ∼0.99. The pore size distributions were calculated from the desorption isotherms using the BJH method. UV-Vis absorption and reflectance spectra of the various TiO2 photoanodes were measured using a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The dye adsorption was examined using a Shimadzu 1800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer by measuring the absorption spectrum of the desorbed-dye solution in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution.
Photovoltaic characterization
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Newport Inst., USA) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and an AM filter were used for measuring dark current–voltage and photocurrent–voltage characteristics of test cells under a bias. The illumination light intensity was adjusted with a Si reference solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter (Oriel, SRC-1000-TC) for AM 1.5G radiation. The light intensity was varied using neutral density filters and the Si reference cell. A mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2 covered the test cell during all measurements. Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a specially designed IPCE system for DSCs (IVT Solar Pvt Ltd, Singapore). For IPCE measurement, a 75 W xenon lamp was used as the light source to generate a monochromatic beam. Calibration was performed using a standard silicon photodiode.
EIS, IMPS and IMVS characterization
Electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out under different illumination levels (Global AM 1.5) using a potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Auto lab, PGSTAT302N). The light source was the same as that in the cell performance test. The frequency range is from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 10 mV was used. A potential bias equal to open-circuit photovoltage was applied. The obtained impedance spectra were analyzed using Z-view software with appropriate equivalent circuits. The photocarrier transport times at short circuit were measured by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). The photocarrier recombination times at open circuit were measured by intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). For these measurements, the DSCs were probed through the photoanode side by a frequency response analyzer using a light-emitting diode (LED, 456 nm) as the light source. The dc component light intensity was superimposed with a small ac component (10% or less of the dc component), the frequency range was 1000 Hz–0.1 mHz. The dc light intensity was varied from 0.1 to 15 mW cm−2 and light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si-photodiode.
Results and discussion
Textural properties

Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the observed, calculated and difference XRD profiles of typical Rietveld refinement of MPT and NPT films. The goodness of fitting (GoF) values are very close to 1 and lower values of R-factors (i.e. Rwp, Rp and Rexp) confirm the goodness of refinement. The measured pattern and refined results reveal that the MPT film contains pure anatase crystallites while the NPT film consists of both anatase and rutile crystallites. The relative amount of rutile crystallites in the NPT film was calculated to be 18.1%, the remainder being anatase. The calculated crystallite sizes are 16 and 25.2 nm for MPT and NPT respectively. Refined lattice parameters for the anatase pure phase (space group: I41/amd) were determined to be a = b = 0.37870 nm and c = 0.95173 nm. These values agree well with values in literature data17 and JCPDS (#782486). Refined lattice parameters for the rutile phase (space group: P42/mnm) were determined to be a = b = 0.74598 nm and c = 0.2959 nm. These values also closely agree with the ones given in literature18 and JCPDS (#782485).

Fig. 3a–c shows the SEM images of the morphology of the pristine sample and the photoanode films. As-synthesized TiO2 particles are formed due to aggregation of several spherical nanograins. The MPT photoanode film does exhibit a coarse and polydisperse mesoporous aggregate structure extending up to a micron while the NPT photoanode film comprises a fine structure with numerous tiny nanocrystallites. A smaller amount of porous voids can thus be seen in the MPT films due to high packing density while the NPT films had a higher porosity since the dispersed nanocrystals are loosely packed. It is presumed that the mesopores in MPT films are formed due to aggregation of the small crystallites which is trivial from the SEM micrographs. To substantiate this assumption, scratched MPT and NPT samples from the sintered films were analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements;21 the corresponding graphs are displayed in Fig. 4. As can be seen in the insets of Fig. 4(a & b), unlike NPT films, the pore distribution in the MPT film sample shows maximum pore volumes centred around 5 nm and 13 nm. The tiny mesopores are associated with inherently built intra-particle pores within micron sized aggregates while the larger pores represent inter-particle pores between the neighbouring aggregates. A narrow pore distribution at 5 nm was observed for the MPT film, suggesting the presence of largely uniform intra-particle pores which could increase the accessible surface area for dye adsorption and promote the rapid diffusion of various redox shuttles in the electrolyte during the photovoltaic reaction.8,10,15,16Table 1 presents BET surface area, pore size, volume, porosity, roughness factor and dye loading for both films. The decrease in surface area, pore size and porosity of the films after TiCl4 treatment clearly indicates the formation of a compact interconnected network of particles. Despite the decrease in surface area, the increased roughness of the films leads to higher dye adsorption (Table 1).22,24,25

Optical properties
The large amount of dye adsorption and enhanced light scattering effect are considered to be two main factors influencing light-harvesting efficiency and hence photon-to-current conversion efficiency of the resulting DSC. Measured diffused reflectance and absorption spectra of the un-dyed and dyed MPT and NPT films with and without scattering layers are displayed in Fig. 5. Compared to the NPT films, the MPT films show higher diffuse reflectance flux (see Fig. 5a) in the visible and near-infrared regions (from 500 to 800 nm) as the size of aggregates formed by nanocrystallites is comparable in size to the wavelength of the light.9,13 Thus, the incident light was significantly scattered thereby extending the light path within the electrodes, thus promoting the probability for interaction with the dye molecules in the MPT film. In case of the NPT films, the reflection was greatly enhanced upon addition of the scattering layer, however light reflected in NPT films with the SL remains lower than those in MPT films without a SL. The overall reflectance values did not differ much between the MPT films with and without a SL for the spectral range 400–550 nm, but the film with a SL exhibits a stable and higher reflectance over the range 600–750 nm, primarily due to double-light scattering effect of both bottom (MPT) and top layers (SL). This study suggests that by controlling the aggregate size and improving their microstructure over a long range, it could be possible to further enhance the scattering efficiency of MPT films.13Fig. 5b presents the extended absorption of light into the longer wavelength region in all the films made from MPT. Considering the combined effect of a relatively high dye absorption and great light scattering in the MPT photoanodes, the solar cells using MPT are expected to have higher IPCE and power conversion efficiency than using NPT films.
 Fig. 5  Diffuse reflectance spectra of undyed films (a) and absorption spectra of dyed films (b). 
The photocurrent spectra of the cells are shown in Fig. 6, which displays IPCE spectra as a function of wavelength for both MPT and NPT based DSCs. The DSC using the MPT film shows a better photoelectrical response, obviously its IPCE is higher than that of the NPT based cell over the entire wavelength range 400–800 nm. This is also in good agreement with the enhanced light scattering and dye adsorption as discussed above. By adding an additional scattering layer on top of the MPT layer, slight improvements in IPCE are observed at higher wavelength which is in good accord with the observed reflectance with and without the scattering layer (see Fig. 5a). This clearly indicates that the SL of 400 nm particles is more efficient than the mesoporous aggregates for scattering the light radiation. This speculation can be inferred by comparing the reflectance and normalized IPCE spectra of NPT-SL and NPT-MPT films, where the performance of the latter is inferior to the former. Despite the lower scattering ability, MPT films induce nearly the same IPCE maximum which is attributable to their unique bifunctional properties of high dye adsorption and back scattering of light at long wavelengths. In conclusion, the MPT films show higher photon to current conversion efficiencies than NPT films, which mainly results in an increased Jsc of MPT cells discussed in detail in the following section.

Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 7 and Table 2 present photovoltaic properties of solar cells made using MPT and NPT films. It is seen that under identical experimental conditions, solar cells fabricated from MPT films outperformed the non-aggregate counterparts. At the optimized film thickness of 19.0 μm, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 779 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 73.48% are obtained, yielding an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.00%. Even higher efficiency up to 10.63% was recorded without a mask. This represents one of the most efficient DSCs employing similar dyes and the electrolyte composition used in the present study.8–14,29–30

However, at nearly the same thickness a DSC made from NPT film has attained Jsc of 13.90 mA cm−2, Voc of 766 mV, and FF of 70.48%, leading to a PCE of only 7.50%. The highest performance was achieved for a DSC using a MPT photoanode when a scattering layer was employed. This cell exhibits JSC of 16.31 mA cm−2, Voc of 774 mV, FF of 71.97%, and thus a higher PCE up to 9.15%. The improved efficiency mostly results from a higher Jsc for cells made using MPT films which is attributed to its high dye loading and superior light harvesting efficiencies to generate more electrons in accordance with BET, reflectance and IPCE results. However, it should be noted that the generation of more electrons solely would not result in higher Jsc because it also depends on the collection efficiency of electrons. Hence, the MPT-DSC is likely to have higher charge collection efficiencies too, as evidenced from IMPS/IMVS or EIS studies, discussed later. Notably, the MPT cells also exhibit higher fill factors indicating reduced recombination. The charge recombination can be estimated by the magnitude and onset of dark current which arises from the reduction of I3− ions by the electrons.27,28 The dark current onset occurs at higher potential (638 mV) for MPT cells than NPT cells (605 mV). The MPT cells produced a lesser dark current than NPT cells at a given potential above 600 mV, indicating a low recombination of the transported electrons and I3− ions in the electrolyte in the MPT cells resulting in high Voc and FF. Quite surprisingly, solar cells based on MPT photoanodes displayed remarkable power conversion efficiency, as high as 10.84% under AM 1.5G, 0.16 sun illumination conditions. Note that the Jsc is proportional to the light intensity over the range used here for all samples. Compared to the initial efficiency of these devices at 1 sun, the observed improvement at 0.16 suns by 21% arises from significant improvement in FF to about 86.97%. Such a high FF suggests a long lifetime for electrons in these devices. Another plausible explanation is provided in the following paragraph.
The ratio of short-circuit photocurrent density to light intensity (Jsc/I), which is equivalent to the apparent incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency,35 was calculated and the results are presented in Fig. 8. For the MPT cell, the apparent IPCE increases as the intensity is reduced while it shows a decreasing trend for NPT cells. It is known that at low intensity, the electron density in the conduction band is less and the probability for a percolating electron to be trapped will be high.35 The presence of a few trap sites (if any) at grain boundaries in MPT films must have suppressed the electron trapping, thus facilitating large electron collection as demonstrated from the IMPS/IMVS study presented later. In contrast more trapping of electrons at multitudinous trap sites present in grain boundaries of NPT films results in only fewer electrons collection, which is evident from the low IPCE observed. As discussed so far, the apparent discrepancy in the photovoltaic performance could not be directly assigned to textural differences between the MPT and NPT films, as several effects associated with electron transport, recombination and collection have been known to significantly modulate the photovoltaic device efficiency.23 To understand further how the differences in the intrinsic electronic properties of these two films affect the PV performance, we explored charge-transport and recombination kinetics by IMPS, IMVS and EIS studies under different light soaking conditions.

IMPS and IMVS study
Electron transport time across the photoanode films (τt), the recombination time of electrons (τr) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) are determined by IMPS/IMVS measurements through the following equations24–26 τt = 1/2Πft; τr = 1/2Πfr; ηcc = 1 − (τt/τr)(1)where ft is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS imaginary component and fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component of the complex impedance.

Fig.9 displays the electron diffusion coefficient (De) and electron lifetime (τr) as a function of short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) for both types of DSCs before and after treatment with TiCl4. It is noticed that the diffusion coefficient for electrons is higher in MPT films in comparison to NPT films, independent of TiCl4 treatment. Despite the poor electrical contacts between the inter-particles in MPT films, the De values obtained from the corresponding DSC lie above those of the NPT-derived DSCs, indicating fast electron transport in the MPT films. This is attributed to the high crystallinity (concurrent with the XRD results) and compact packing of primary nanocrystallites in MPT films. The long transport time in NPT films is a result of prolonged electron transport length owing to poor connectivity between particles and also the presence of rutile crystallites.32,33 Note that the Jsc was proportional to the light intensities for both the cells. Upon TiCl4 treatment of photo-electrodes, the De values are nearly doubled in both cases (see Fig. 9a) because TiCl4 treatment would boost interfacial conductivity between contiguous aggregates. It is therefore presumed that the electron pathway to the collector is reduced in the uninterrupted network of particles in such films.
 Fig. 9  Effective electron diffusion coefficients and electron lifetime as a function of JSC for DSCs assembled from MPT and NPT films treated with TiCl4 and untreated with TiCl4 (NPT*, MPT*). Electron diffusion coefficients were estimated from the relation De = l2/2.35τt, where l is the thickness of the film.32,34 

Fig. 9b shows that electron lifetime (or recombination time) is longer in MPT cells than NPT cells and exhibits a power-law dependence on JSC. These results indicate that the recapture of the electrons in the MPT films by I3− ions in the electrolyte should be slower than that in the NPT films. The lifetimes of electrons in TiCl4 treated films are longer compared to those in untreated films, because TiCl4 treatment led not only to good connectivity of the particles but also to surface passivation of the particles, thus reducing the electron trap density.31 Consequently, electron lifetime is increased.
A simple qualitative model is shown in Fig. 10 demonstrating possible reasons for significant differences in the electron transport patterns in NPT and MPT films. The electron trap states due to impurity segregation in the nominally pure titanates are often located at grain boundaries;45 such trap states are likely to be high in NPT films due to poor connectivity of the particles (Fig. 10b). As more electrons get trapped in these states the transport length becomes smaller. In MPT films (Fig. 10a), good electrical contact between nanocrystallite domains eliminates or lessens the frequency of such trapping incidents. As a result shorter electron transit time and higher effective diffusion coefficients are observed. Also the phase of MPT crystallizes in pure anatase form, such high-purity crystallites lead to improved electron transport properties.36

The charge collection efficiency is a very important parameter in determining the performance of a DSC. It is a result of the competition between recombination and transport of electrons within the photoanode.26 Obviously, from Fig. 11 we note a higher collection efficiency of electrons in MPT cells compared to NPT cells. Furthermore, the charge collection efficiencies for MPT cells remain nearly constant over the range of illumination intensities while a decreasing trend in collection efficiency is observed for NPT cells at low light illumination. This accounts for the superior performance of MPT based cells even at low illumination.

EIS study
EIS is an effective tool to investigate charge transport and recombination kinetics in dye sensitized solar cells.37–39 Information of electron lifetime, effective diffusion length, transport resistance, etc. could be estimated from the impedance spectra of DSCs. As depicted in Fig. 12 the EIS spectra of MPT- and NPT-DSCs displayed two main semicircles. The first semicircle, seen in the high frequency region, results from the charge transfer resistance (RCT-Pt) and capacitance at the platinised counter-electrode. The second semicircle, observed at intermediate frequencies, results from the charge transfer resistance of the recombination process at the nanoparticle/electrolyte interface (Rr) and the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film. The electron transport resistance (Rt) is manifested as a linear feature in the high frequency region of the second semicircle which indicates that electron transport features a transmission line behavior, which has been observed for DSCs using nanoparticles.38,39 The impedance spectra have been analyzed using known equivalent circuit models,38,39 that provide an estimate of the electron transport and recombination resistances of MPT and NPT films. The electron transport and recombination in the MPT and NPT films is the primary concern in this study. The values of Rt and Rr obtained from the equivalent-circuit simulation of the middle-frequency arc are listed in Table 3 along with the calculated values of ηcc and diffusion length.

At different illumination intensities, the transport resistance (Rt) of the MPT cell is significantly smaller than that of the NPT cell. This result provides a hint that the electron trapping is minimized in MPT films due to enhanced electron transport at grain boundaries (interfaces) perhaps due to accumulated space charge layers of electronic charges at the interfaces of the neighbouring primary crystallites within MPT aggregates.45 Contrastingly, in the NPT films the poor interconnectivity between the adjacent particles has delayed the electron transport across the boundaries; therefore the charge transport resistance is larger. Importantly, the higher Rr values observed for MPT cells account for longer electron lifetime. Hence we believe that in MPT based cells, comparatively more photogenerated electrons are extracted to the external load.38–41,43 Contrary to this, NPT films have long transport times for the electrons before they are collected at the FTO substrate, thereby increasing the probability of recombination. The calculated electron collection efficiencies are higher in MPT cells at different intensity levels employed in this study. Relatively, higher charge collection efficiency in MPT cells than NPT cells (91% vs. 77%) at low illumination intensity resulted in notably higher overall light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 10.84%.
The charge collection efficiency, ηcc, can also be assessed in terms of electron diffusion length (Ln). The characteristic electron diffusion length is defined as the average distance that electron travels in the electrical conducting network of TiO2 before it recombines with ionic species in the redox shuttle. In the present work, the Ln for NPT and MPT cells determined under different light illumination conditions are about 62–71 μm and 40–46 μm respectively. The values of Ln are fairly comparable with those reported by Wang and Peter for DSCs using acetonitrile based electrolytes.42,44 Apparently, the diffusion lengths in MPT cells are longer than that in NPT cells, as a result high charge collection efficiency could be plausible.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated unique properties of mesoporous TiO2 aggregates offering multiple functions of a photoanode of an efficient DSC. The mesoporous TiO2 aggregates in photoanode films, inherently facilitate more dye uptake and enhanced light harvesting. Additionally, the compact packing and high crystallinity of nanocrystallites in these TiO2 aggregates promote facile electron transport. The presence of an impure phase in anatase in NPT films along with poor inter-particle connectivity associated with the particle packing density resulted in longer transport times and shorter lifetimes of the corresponding DSCs. Under global AM 1.5 (1 sun) illumination the overall photovoltaic device efficiency of 9.0% (vs. 7.50% for NPT cells) was obtained without any additional scattering layer. Interestingly, this cell had shown an enhanced conversion efficiency of 10.84% (vs. 8.30% for NPT cells) at low light intensity of 0.16 sun. IMPS, IMVS and EIS analyses showed higher charge collection efficiencies (>90%) for MPT based cells. Finally, it is also important to emphasize that multi-functional mesoporous TiO2 aggregate based photoanodes may be ideal for DSCs to achieve power conversion efficiencies higher than the current benchmark efficiency. As a concluding remark, it is important to mention that though our best optimized MPT based DSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of about 9%, their present limitation appears to be the relatively high thickness of the films used. We propose that by combining with dyes having high molar extension coefficients and durable electrolytes, this type of photoanode can effectively be used in DSCs for indoor applications.
