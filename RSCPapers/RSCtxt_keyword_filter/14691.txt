    , Accepted 22nd April 2022First published on 25th April 2022AbstractWith a high-energy density and high-power output, potassium ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) are promising next-generation energy storage devices. However, the poor K+ electrochemical performance of battery-type anodes remains a challenge due to the inherent insulating property and the poor ion-transport kinetic of the anode materials. Herein, we report an integrated photoelectrode to achieve significantly enhanced K+ storage performance. The electron–hole pairs generated by the integrated photoelectrode under light-irradiation synergistically enhance the electrochemical adsorption of K+ and reversible ion-transport kinetics. Specifically, in the presence of Z907 dye that matches the energy level of the FeSe2 integrated anode, the reaction energy barrier during illumination was significantly reduced by 35.7% (∼0.05 eV). A remarkable increase in capacitance is therefore achieved to 23.8% at 3 A g−1 (under light). This discovery provides an effective pathway for breaking the energy density of PHIC only by the conversion and storage of solar energy.
1. Introduction
In order to achieve the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality as soon as possible, the low-carbon energy storage technology based on the solar @ battery composite energy storage system has received more and more attention and is widely used.1–4 Powering lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with intermittent solar energy exhibit attractive potentials in premium 3C products, military industries, and other fields with special demands.5–8 This usually requires problems such as voltage matching between energy conversion equipment, resulting in additional cost increase and energy loss.9,10 During the charging process, additional electrical energy needs to be consumed to realize the conversion from electrical energy to chemical energy.11,12 In order to find a better solution, new energy systems that integrate photovoltaic/storage into a single device are receiving increasing attention.13,14 The light-assisted charging system provides a sustainable solution with no pollution source, low operating cost, increased discharge capacity, overcoming the intermittent nature of solar radiation, and is a low-carbon energy-saving technology.15–17 In order to save additional power during the charging process, solar energy can be used to assist in charging lithium-ion batteries.18,19 Integrating photoelectrodes into electrochemical capacitors or batteries to form a single device is a solution with broad application prospects.
Due to the abundant reserves and low price of potassium,20–22 potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high power density and low cost.23–29 Integrating photo-assisted (PA) charging electrodes into PIHCs opens the possibility for unlimited solar energy utilization.17,30 PA-PIHCs can utilize the holes/electrons generated on the surface of the photoelectrode to participate in the battery reaction, reducing the charging potential and improving the energy utilization efficiency.31–33 In addition, finding suitable photoelectric anode materials is also crucial, as it needs to satisfy: (1) a suitable band gap to absorb more visible light and a higher adsorption coefficient,34 (2) low production cost and good electrical conductivity35,36 and (3) high photoelectron–hole separation efficiency.37,38 Therefore, we combined theoretical calculations to find a matching photoelectric anode material-FeSe2. FeSe2, as a typical p-type semiconductor, can accept photoelectrons to promote K+ insertion and extraction.39–41 Integrating FeSe2 and Z907 dyes to form photoelectrode materials and combining them with PIHC to form an integrated device is an ideal solution to further increase its energy density to the theoretical value.
Herein, we propose a photo-assisted charging potassium-ion hybrid supercapacitor in which a tailor-made nitrogen–carbon-doped FeSe2/Z907-dye/titania (FeSe2/N–C/Z907-dye/TiO2) composite is used as an integrated photoelectrode. The as-prepared integrated photoelectrode can be applied not only as a sensitive photoelectrode for photon capture but also as a highly electrochemically reversible anode for PA-PIHC. The well-matched bandgap gradient between FeSe2 and Z907 dye facilitates the photoexcited electron transfer and the storage of potassium ions. Notably, the long-term cycling performance of the PA-PIHC integrated device is up to 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The results of the enhanced capacitance and energy efficiency demonstrate that the specially tailored integrated photoelectrodes are beneficial for light penetration and energy storage. Electrochemical performance and kinetic analysis results show that the light-harvesting materials (FeSe2 and Z907 dye) not only accelerate the electron transfer during the redox process, but also promote the conversion of polyselenide and the surface adsorption of K+. This work provides an efficient way to break the energy density of PHICs only through the conversion and storage of solar energy.
2. Experimental section
All chemical reagents were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., including Prussian blue, selenium powder, and iron powder. Hydrochloric acid used is from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, and all chemicals were used as-is without further treatment.
2.1 Material synthesis
The synthesis method for FeSe2/N–C is as follows: 1.0 g of Prussian blue Fe4[Fe (CN)6]3 (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China) and 0.9 g Se powder (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China) with a molar ratio of 1:1.4 are ground in a mortar for about 0.5 h, transferred to the porcelain boat, and subsequently calcined in the tubular furnace. The excess selenium powder is used to compensate for the loss caused by sublimation during the calcination process. Then, the mixture was annealed at 650 °C for 5 h under the protection of argon, and the heating rate was 1 °C min−1. Using 1 g iron powder (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China) and 1.97 g Se powder (molar ratio 1:1.4) as starting materials as reference samples, FeSe2 powder was synthesized by solid-phase reaction method.
For the integrated photoelectrode, the fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glasses (Yiyang Xiangcheng South China Photoelectric Co., Ltd 2.2 mm OPV-FTO22-7L) were shredded into a square of 2.5 cm × 3.5 cm and cleaned with detergent solvent, ethanol solvent, acetone solvent, and deionized water, respectively. The as-prepared FTO glass was vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, the TiO2 slurry was scraped onto the FTO conductive glass with an area of 2 cm2 to form a thin film with uniform thickness, and the dense TiO2 coating was obtained. The glass coated with TiO2 was raised to 450 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept sintering for 2 h, and cooled to room temperature to obtain TiO2 mesoporous film ultimately. The burned conductive glass of TiO2 mesoporous membrane was completely immersed into ethanol solution containing 0.1 mmol L−1 Z907 (Yingkou Opivit New Energy Technology Co., Ltd OPV-Z907-D), dyed for 24 h, and dried in a drying oven to obtain Z907 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode. Soon afterwards, a mixture of FeSe2/N–C composite material:multi-walled carbon nanotube (MCNT):cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 were dispersed in water and ball milled for 8 h to prepare the working electrode. Then, the material was coated on the Z907 sensitized TiO2 conductive glass, dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h, the active mass load of it is 1.0–1.6 mg cm−2 and the integrated FeSe2/N–C photoelectrode was obtained in the end.
2.2 Sample characterization
The morphology and microstructure are generally characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (1.5405 Å) (2-theta = 5°–80°), scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACHI S-4800) combined with EDX spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM, field emission CM200, FEI) combined with STEM. The valence state and graphitization degree of carbon are measured and analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi) and Raman spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher DXR).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The anode was prepared by mixing the FeSe2/N–C, conductive agent (Super P, 20 wt%), and binder (carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), 10 wt%) with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in deionized water and absolute ethanol. After coating the formed slurry directly on the copper foil, it was dried overnight in a vacuum at 80 °C. 2032-Type coin cells (CR2032) combined with the prepared anodes and potassium metal foils (with low humidity and low oxygen (<0.1 ppm)) were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. Glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Grade GF/D) were used as separators and 1 M potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) at the same volume ratio was the electrolyte. We tested the galvanostatic charge and discharge on a computer-controlled NEWARE battery tester (BTS-4008), and then obtained the CV and EIS measurements on the Ivium (Vertex C, Switzerland) electrochemical workstation. To understand the characterizations of ex situ materials, coin cells were cycled and dissembled in the glove box, and impurities were removed through washing with DEC solvent for ex situ measurements.
GITT carried out a cycle of pulse current of 20 mA g−1 for 30 min, followed by 6 h rest until the preset potential is reached. All the cells were cycled at 50 mA g−1 for 5 cycles for the activation and prepared for testing. The ionic diffusion coefficient (Dk) was worked out by the following eqn (1): (1)
In this equation, I stands for the impulse current and Vm corresponds to the molar volume of anode materials. The charge transfer amount of K+ is represented by ZA. F and t correspond to the Faraday constant and the duration time of the applied current separately. S represents the active surface area between the electrode and electrolyte. dE/dδ is equivalent to the slope of coulometric titration profiles, while dE/dτ^(1/2) was derived from response time–voltage curves. If the cell voltage has a linear relationship with τ1/2, Dk can be calculated by simplifying eqn (2) based on Fick's second law: (2)wherein, ΔES, ΔEτ, and nm are the difference in equilibrium potential, D-value of cell voltage, and the number of moles at each current pulse procedure.
The temperature-dependent EIS was used to calculate the activation energy of K+ according to the Arrhenius eqn (3): (3)
In this equation, k, T, and Rs are equivalent to the rate constant, the absolute temperature, and the transfer resistance, respectively. Pre-exponential constant is represented by A, R is the standard gas constant, and Eact means the activation energy.
PA-PIHC was assembled using the as-synthesized integrated FeSe2/N–C photoelectrode as an anode and the AC (produced by Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd.; model: XFP06) as a cathode. In order to assemble the photo-assisted rechargeable K-ion battery, firstly, we designed a windowed electrode shell, put the spring sheet into the circular groove of the electrode shell, then put the potassium sheet, and then added 1 m KFSI in EC and DEC with the same volume ratio as electrolytes, and glass microfiber membranes were adopted as separators (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 2500). The electrolyte was added, the prepared working electrode and aluminum foil (as the lead connecting the tester as the positive material) were pressed in the electrode shell, and finally clamped with the battery fixing clamp to make the cathode and anode closely fit. The weight of the cathode versus anode was designed at a ratio of 1:2. Both of the FeSe2/N–C anode and the AC cathode were activated through 5 cycles in potassium half-cells, which included the preparation for fabricating PA-PIHC. The energy (E) and power (P) densities of the PIHC device were calculated according to the following eqn (4) and (5): (4) P = E/t(5)
2.4 DFT calculations
Calculation details of the adsorption of different proportions of K by FeSe2: first, the FeSe2 substrate is constructed. The lattice constants of FeSe2 are a = 4.791 Å and b = 3.575 Å. A 3 × 3 × 1 supercell is constructed by cutting the plane with (0 0–1) crystal plane, and a 15 Å vacuum layer is established above the interface to ensure no interaction between K ion and the upper plane. After that, 1, 2, and 4 K atoms are constructed on the FeSe2 substrate to simulate the adsorption of different proportions of K by FeSe2, and the average adsorption energy difference of different proportions of K is calculated. CASTEP software package is used for geometry optimization, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) is selected for calculation, and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is adopted. The step energy convergence tolerance is 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom, the maximum force and stress are set to 0.01 eV A−1 and 0.02 GPa, respectively, and the maximum displacement per step is 5.0 × 10−4 Å. The interatomic interaction force is approximated by OTFG ultrasoft pseudopotentials, the plane wave energy cutoff is set to 440 eV, and the self-consistent field (SCF) approximation tolerance is set to 5.0 × 10−7 eV per atom. K-Point is 3 × 4 × 1. Since magnetism of the material is not detected in the experiment, the influence of spin is not considered in the calculation.
Calculation of the effect of ruthenium atom on the de-potassiation process of K2FeSe2: in the first step, K2FeSe2 and K2FeSe2 + Ru systems are constructed, respectively, and the atoms of the two systems are modeled to make the interaction force between the atoms, which are denoted as Non-Ru-Reactant (NRR) and With-Ru-Reactant (WRR) respectively. In the second step, the two K atoms in NRR and WRR are moved more than 5 Å in a specific direction to ensure that there is no interaction between the two K atoms and FeSe2 and Ru. The last two models are denoted as Non-Ru-Product (NRP) and With-Ru-Product (WRP). Dmol3 software package was used for geometry optimization, and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) is selected for the calculation. The maximum energy convergence tolerance is 1.0 × 10−5 Ha for each step, and the maximum force and maximum displacement are set to 0.002 Ha Å−1 and 0.005 Å separately. The self-consistent field (SCF) approximation tolerance is set to 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom.
3. Results and discussion
In order to better verify the feasibility of FeSe2/N–C as a photo-assisted charging anode material and the promotion effect of dye Z907 on the selenide conversion reaction under illumination. Therefore, we prove it based on the calculation and analysis of density functional theory (DFT). Firstly, we calculated the rationality analysis of K+ embedding for FeSe2/N–C with cubic lattice structure. By calculating the intercalation of different ratios of K+ (Fig. 1a), it can be clearly found that the FeSe2/N–C material with the cubic lattice structure is beneficial to the K+ intercalation reaction (Fig. 1c and S1†). This is attributed to the open structure of FeSe2/N–C, which makes the K+ embedding process smooth. We focus on the presence or absence of Z907 dye (the radical ruthenium (Ru) atom is chosen to be the key component for Z907 dye) and compare and verify whether light is helpful for the reaction of FeSe2/NC material during the charging process (Fig. 1b). Combining Fig. 1d and S2,† it is obvious that in the presence of the dye Z907, the reaction energy barrier during illumination is significantly reduced by 35.7% (∼0.05 eV). Based on the above calculation results, it is shown that this FeSe2/N–C hybrid photoelectrode can not only reduce the reaction barrier, but also promote K+ insertion and extraction reactions with effect and enhance the kinetics of the reaction.

Based on the DFT calculation and analysis results, the feasibility of FeSe2/N–C material as a negative electrode material for photo-assisted charging is verified. Then, we conduct intuitive testing and characterization through experiments. Through the above calculation, we have synthesized and designed FeSe2/N–C nanomaterials via a one-step solid-state reaction. The detailed synthetic diagrammatic sketch is demonstrated in Fig. S3.† The crystal structure of the as-prepared FeSe2/N–C composites was analyzed based on powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2a). The morphology and detailed internal structure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Fig. 2. We can observe that FeSe2/N–C is a 3D structure with a microrod assembly (Fig. 2b and c). Fig. 2b and S4† more clearly present the shape of the microrod, about 100 nm in diameter with a smooth surface. It is worth noting from Fig. 2d and e that there is a layer of amorphous N–C covering the FeSe2 surface. The (120) crystal plane of FeSe2/N–C can be observed in the HRTEM image of Fig. 2f. Furthermore, uniformly distributed Fe, Se, C, and N shown in the elemental mapping images (Fig. 2g–k) imply that the surface of FeSe2 microrods is coated with the carbon layer. Two characteristic peaks located at 1340 and 1580 cm−1 displayed in the Raman spectra (Fig. S5†) represent the disorder-induced D-band and in-plane stretched G-band, respectively.42,43 FeSe2/N–C has a high intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 1.34, which means that FeSe2/N–C introduces more defects and active sites. The XPS spectra of C 1s (Fig. S5c†) exhibit several peaks at 284.7, 285.3, 286.7, and 289.0 eV, corresponding to CC, C–C, C–O, and CO, respectively.34 The strong peak intensity at 284.7 eV indicates that the cyano group in Prussian blue was thermally reduced to N-doped carbon during calcination. The spectrum in Fig. S5d† exhibits several peaks at 398.5 (C–N bonds, pyridinic nitrogen), 399.7 (C–N bonds, pyrrolic nitrogen), and 400.9 eV (graphitic N, graphitic nitrogen). Fig. S5e† shows the deconvoluted spectra of Se 3d exhibiting several peaks at 55.7 (Se 3d3/2) and 54.8 eV (Se 3d5/2).44 Besides, another peak centered at 58.7 eV corresponded to the Se–O bond.34 The spectra of Fe 2p in Fig. S5f† mainly exhibit two peaks: 710.6 and 723.9 eV; the satellite peaks are at around 719.2 and 727.4 eV;45 the two peaks located at 713.2 and 725.1 eV for Fe 3p are related to the partial oxidation of FeSe2 by oxygen.46

The electrochemical performances of FeSe2/N–C anode electrodes with light illumination (100 mW cm−2, xenon lamp) were evaluated by the integrated device. In order to illustrate the light-assisted charging process, a schematic diagram of the integrated device is depicted in Fig. S6,† in which light is allowed to penetrate the battery through the fluorine-doped transparent tin oxide (FTO) glass window, as shown in Fig. S6.† Since the integrated cell can receive light, it is designed to facilitate the light-assisted charging process. The FTO/TiO2/Z907/FeSe2/N–C dyes comprise the hybrid cathode counterpart in sequence. In order to verify the excellent electrochemical performance and optical properties of FeSe2/N–C materials as K anode materials, we conducted a comparative test of the FeSe2/N–C sample and FeSe2 sample. As shown in the Fig. 3a and b, the FeSe2/N–C electrode had better cycle stability because we have introduced an amorphous N–C structure attached to the rod-shaped FeSe2 around, which has played a role in suppressing the expansion of the structure while increasing the ionic conductivity. This improvement makes up for the structural instability and poor cycle performance of pure FeSe2 materials. Notably, the battery can reduce the charging voltage by nearly ∼97 mV under light conditions (Fig. 3c). Then, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the FeSe2/N–C electrodes at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are depicted in Fig. 3d. Regardless of the light status, they both have a pair of redox peaks with a similar shape. Under illumination, the peak current increases with a decrease in voltage gap (ΔV). This indicates that the FeSe2/N–C anode possesses outstanding specific capacitance and energy storage performance of K+. With the increasing scan rate from 0.1 to 50 mV s−1, a homologous phenomenon is observed (Fig. S7†), which illustrates light illumination has a vital influence on the pseudo-capacitance behavior. In addition, at different scanning speeds, whether the light is turned on or off, as the scanning rate increases, the peak current and voltage increase separately, and the specific capacitance decreases (Fig. S7†).

The transient photocurrent test in exhibited Fig. 3e, the photocurrent changes periodically, which intuitively shows the intensity of photo-excited electrons and the transfer process after illumination. Under light conditions, the light-excited current density first increased sharply and then dropped sharply to ∼5 mA. While illuminating, the current density increases first and then decreases. This is due to the emergence of light-excited electrons and holes after the Z907 dye molecule receives photons.47 At the same time, the light-excited electrons are injected into the TiO2 coating and exported successively. The transfer of light-excited electrons is inhibited because of the existence of a large number of holes, causing the current to reach a peak instantaneously. In the subsequent absence of light, numerous light-excited holes of Z907 dye molecules and re-injected light-excited electrons recombine on the FTO film.48,49 Without light-absorbing Z907 molecules, the hybrid FeSe2/N–C electrode fails to show a photocurrent response. This illustrates the key role of Z907 dye in photoelectric conversion and the energy level matching with FeSe2/N–C.

Fig. 3f reveals the periodic change of the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the integrated battery with a FeSe2/N–C electrode under the opening and closing of the light. Obviously, the OCV decreases rapidly when the light is illuminated; when it is extinguished, the OCV immediately increases. This change once again verified the sensitive photo response of FeSe2/N–C. The change in the value of OCV voltage before and after the light is ∼80 mV. This is because the electrons excited by the dye under light are injected into the TiO2 and accumulated on the FTO board under the light, causing the voltage to drop. Without the effect of illumination, the accumulated electrons are gradually consumed, causing the voltage to recover. By comparing the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) corresponding to different cycles with or without light, the difficulty of charge migration is analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4 and S8,† the FeSe2/N–C electrode is compared with the EIS of the 5th, 15th, 50th, and 100th cycles of the battery cycle with or without light, and we find that the EIS under light conditions is significantly lower than that under dark conditions. It proves that Z907 dye excites electrons and holes, promoting the charge transport of the electrode and indeed accelerates the electrochemical reaction kinetics.50 The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was adopted for further insight into the effect of light effect on reaction kinetics. The overpotential of FeSe2/N–C in illumination condition potassiation and depotassiation are both lower than those of dark (Fig. S9†). In addition, the calculated diffusion coefficients (Dk, Fig. S10†) of illumination are well above the relevant values for dark. The lower overpotential and increased Dk proved that the decrease of diffusion barrier for K+ is related to the introduction of light effect, enhancing the reaction kinetics as a result.

We further study the reaction mechanism of the two electrodes at varying CV scan rates and try to analyse the impact of light effect on the potassium storage behavior (Fig. S11†). The reaction kinetic eqn (6)–(8) is as follows: ip = avb(6) log(ip) = b × log(v) + log(a)(7) i = k1v + k2v1/2(8)where ip is the peak current, v is the scan rate, a, b, k1 and k2 are variable parameters. In general, the type of K+ (de) insertion is determined by the value of b. When the b value approaches 0.5, diffusion-controlled process mainly dominates the reaction; when the b value is close to 1.0, the reaction is dominated by surface-controlled pseudocapacitive behavior.51 As shown in Fig. S11c and b,†b values of carbon-based redox peaks are close to 0.5, indicating diffusion is dominant. In the case of lighting, the value of b is closer to 1. This indicates that the role of the optical effect is gradually approaching the capacitive contribution. At the same time, this also shows that the photo effect promotes the attraction of charges on the surface, which visibly enhances the reaction kinetics of the FeSe2/N–C anode material. Fig. S12a and b† illustrate the CV profiles represented by different potassium storage behavior at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 separately. It is worth noting that in the high (1.9–3.0 V) voltage range, the part contributed by the capacitance increases significantly. This phenomenon proves that the surface absorption process is enhanced by the illumination effect. Furthermore, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, the capacitance during illumination increased to 58.7% (Fig. S12c and d†).
By the test of the rate performance of FeSe2/N–C under illumination (Fig. 3g and h), the stability of its structure and good light response is also proved. Then, we compared the test with or without light to evaluate the cycle performance and capacity change of FeSe2/N–C. It is worth noting that under light conditions, the FeSe2/N–C material exhibits a higher specific capacity and cycle stability (Fig. 3i). The initial coulombic efficiencies with and without light were 74.5% and 66.3% (Fig. S13†), respectively, and the larger initial irreversible capacity was mainly due to the formation of SEI. This is due to the photo response produced by the matching of FeSe2/N–C and Z907 dyes, which can easily capture holes excited by light, which effectively promotes the reaction and ultimately increase the capacity. The GCD curve also confirms the increase in capacitance, as shown in Fig. S14.† Similar to the CV curve, the charging voltage decreases under light conditions, but the opposite during discharge, indicating that the overpotential decreases during discharge and charging. Energy efficiency has also been improved to a certain extent. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed from Fig. S15† that the morphology of the FeSe2/N–C photoelectrode after 100 cycles under illumination is not severely damaged, and the short rod-like structure can be maintained. This indicates the stability of the FeSe2/N–C photoelectrode structure, which provides good storage space for K+.
In order to explore the optical effect of FeSe2/N–C during charge and discharge, ex situ XRD was introduced to comparatively analyze K+ insertion and extraction mechanisms. We use ex situ XRD to comparatively analyze the intercalation and deintercalation mechanisms of K+ to explore the optical effects of FeSe2/N–C during charging and discharging. Fig. 5a and b show ex situ XRD patterns of FeSe2/N–C under dark and light conditions, respectively. During the first discharge in the dark, we can clearly observe a significant increase in the Se peak near 35°, which is due to the easy conversion of K2Se to Se when exposed to air.52 At the same time, it can be observed that the (002) crystal face corresponding to FeSe2/N–C increases first and then decreases with charging and discharging around 52°. This again confirms that the FeSe2/N–C structure has a high degree of reaction reversibility. In the case of lighting, it is completely different from the above structure. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 5b that the emergence of a strong peak at 26° corresponds to SnO2 (Fig. S16†),19 and the peak gradually increases with the charging process. At the same time, a weaker Ru appears at 38.7° (Fig. S16†). Both indicate that under illumination, combined with ex situ XRD under illumination, the photoeffect of FeSe2/NC promotes K+ adsorption, resulting in peak shifts at 31°, 48.6°, and 54°, corresponding to (110), (211), and (031) expanded lattices. At the same time, combined with theoretical calculations (Fig. 1b), it can be seen that the K+ adsorption site changes due to the effect of Ru atoms, which again proves the positive effect produced by our integrated photoelectrode. In addition, a weaker peak appears around 39°, corresponding to the appearance of the K2Se phase,52 and it is noteworthy that the peak value corresponding to K2Se is accompanied by the charging and discharging process, showing a change of first increase and then decrease. This again confirms the good reversibility of the reaction process. The reaction mechanism of each stage can be expressed as follows:52FeSe2 + xK+ + xe− → KxFe3Se4 + 2SeKxFe3Se4 + (8 − x)K+ + (8 − x)e− → 4K2Se + 3Fe
 Fig. 5  (a) and (b) show ex situ XRD patterns of FeSe2/N–C under dark and light conditions, respectively. Scheme of (c) the N–C doping and (d) the light assisted charging strategy with respect to the potassium storage mechanism. 
The reaction mechanism under light conditions is as follows:dye + hv → dye*dye* + TiO2 → TiO2|dye* + TiO2|e−xFeSe2 + ydye + 4xK+ + (4x + y)e− → 2xK2Se + xFe
The schematic diagram of the FeSe2/N–C reaction mechanism in Fig. 5c clearly expresses the process of promoting the reaction under light conditions. The random accumulation of K+ around FeSe2 resulted in the disordered arrangement of atoms. After modification, K+ preferentially adsorb on the amorphous N–C, playing a transitional role. In addition, the amorphous N–C layer improves the ionic conductivity, and it is easier to absorb the holes excited by the Z907 dye by light, which effectively improves the photoresponse of FeSe2. This improvement reduces the random accumulation of K+ and optimizes the structure, which greatly reduces irreversible transformation. Therefore, after improvement, the reversible K+ absorption mechanism shows faster dynamic speed and light response.
Considering the high photo-electric response and capacity to store potassium of the as-synthesized FeSe2/N–C anode material, a sustainable and superpower photo-assisted potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PA-PIHC) device was manufactured. FeSe2/N–C was used as the anode material and the commercial AC for the cathode (Fig. 6a). Before assembling PA-PIHC, we conducted a systematic study on the electrochemical performance of AC, including charge–discharge curve and cycle and rate performance (Fig. S17a–c†), showing that AC has good electrochemical performance as the cathode of PA-PIHC. The maximum output power can be achieved at the best mass ratio of 1:2 (anode to cathode) (Fig. S17d†). CV profiles shown in Fig. S18† exhibit the electrochemical stability of the assembled PIHC at the given voltage range (0.01 to 3.8 V). Fig. S19† demonstrates typical CV curves of PIHC at diverse scan rates in the potential range from 0.01 to 3.8 V. The combination of both battery-type and capacitor-type potassium storage mechanisms in PIHC is confirmed by the CV profiles with quasi-rectangular shapes. GCD curve is shown in Fig. S20.† Based on the above test, we conducted an illumination test on the FeSe2/N–C integrated photovoltaic cell. The shape of the PA-PHIC measured at different scanning speeds remained basically unchanged (appearing rectangular-like) (Fig. S21†). At the same time, combined with the GCD curves before and after light (Fig. 6b and S22†), it is worth noting that under the condition of 0.05 A g−1 current density, the capacity of PA-PHIC increases significantly after light. This shows that light effectively reduces the progress of irreversible reactions. For the sake of eliminating the influence of the increase in electrolyte temperature caused by the light on the PA-PHIC, we alternately open and close the light test. Impressively, a remarkable increase from 81.6 to 101.9 W h kg−1 can be achieved at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 6c), which further illustrates the influence of light on the charging and discharging process. At the same time, the above-mentioned effects are also ruled out. The rate performance of the PA-PHIC is displayed in Fig. 6d. In addition, such rate capability is superior to most of the reported state-of-the-art hybrid capacitors (Fig. S23†). Under the condition of 3 A g−1, the PA-PHIC exhibits good cycle stability and high capacity (Fig. 6e). In addition, PA-PHIC also exhibits good cycle stability of over 4000 cycles under the condition of 5 A g−1. At the same time, the PA-PHIC also successfully illuminates the series-connected light-emitting diodes (Fig. S24†).

4. Conclusion
Herein, we report integrating a redox-coupled FeSe2/N–C photoelectrode into a potassium ion hybrid capacitor for photoassisted charging. The as-prepared integrated photoelectrode can achieve significantly enhanced K+ storage performance. The electron–hole pairs generated by the integrated photoelectrode under light-irradiation synergistically enhance the electrochemical adsorption of K+ and reversible ion-transport kinetics. Specifically, in the presence of Z907 dye (radical ruthenium (Ru)) that matches the energy level of the FeSe2 integrated anode, the reaction energy barrier during illumination was significantly reduced by 35.7% (∼0.05 eV). The device can be quickly captured and stored directly in the supercapacitor. The as-prepared hybrid device achieves a capacitance of ∼123.9 W h kg−1 in 3 A g−1, which is 23.8% higher than that under dark conditions. In addition, the mechanism of capacitance increase is verified by combining ex situ XRD and DFT calculation. Meanwhile, PA-PIHC exhibited good cycling stability (∼4000 cycles) under the illumination of 5 A g−1. This work provides an effective pathway for breaking the energy density of PHIC only by the conversion and storage of solar energy.
