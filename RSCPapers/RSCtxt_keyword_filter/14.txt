    , Accepted 21st April 2021First published on 22nd April 2021AbstractHow to manipulate the phase separation and molecular arrangement to meet the need of efficient charge generation and extraction remains a long-standing challenge in all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs). Herein, a small molecule acceptor Y7 as a morphology modulator was incorporated into a B1:BO-4Cl matrix to fabricate ternary ASM-OSCs. Y7 possesses excellent compatibility with the acceptor BO-4Cl but poor compatibility with the donor B1. The two acceptors prefer to form an alloy-like structure in ternary blends due to their good compatibility, which is conducive to fine-tuning the molecular arrangement for facilitating charge extraction. The inferior compatibility originating from the strong intermolecular interaction between Y7 and B1 can provide a driving force to manipulate the phase separation between the donor and acceptor for gaining well-formed nanofibrous and bi-continuous interpenetrating networks, leading to efficient charge separation, transport and collection in ternary blends. The ternary ASM-OSCs with 10 wt% Y7 in acceptors achieve a top-ranked power conversion efficiency of 16.28% with a holistic improvement of short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage and fill factor. This work opens a new avenue to optimize the morphology for further boosting the performance of OSCs.

Broader context
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have exhibited a broad market prospect owing to their multiple advantages of low-cost, light-weight, flexibility, semitransparency, and multiple colors. In comparison with other types of OSCs, all-small-molecule OSCs (ASM-OSCs) are more suitable for commercial-scale manufacturing on account of the advantages of small molecules, such as well-defined chemical molecular structures, easy synthesis and purification, and negligible batch-to-batch variation. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ASM-OSCs still lag far behind those of polymer/small molecule OSCs, ascribed to the unmanageable phase separation and molecular arrangement in small molecule blends. Herein, a strategy based on rational compatibility in a ternary matrix is put forward to address the long-standing challenge of morphological modulation, achieving an efficient PCE of over 16% for AMS-OSCs.

Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn wide attention thanks to their unique advantages of light-weight, semitransparency, flexibility, multiple colors, and great potential for low-cost industrialized production.1–5 OSCs are generally classified as polymer/small molecule (or small molecule/polymer) OSCs, all-polymer OSCs and all-small-molecule OSCs (ASM-OSCs) according to the categories of electron donor and acceptor materials. Each kind of OSC has its strengths and defects on account of the different characteristics of polymers and small molecules.6–11 In comparison with polymers, small molecules show promising advantages of well-defined chemical molecular structures, easy synthesis and purification, as well as negligible batch-to-batch variation, making ASM-OSCs more suitable for commercial-scale manufacturing.12–18 However, only a few ASM-OSCs can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 15%, which still lags far behind that of polymer/small molecule OSCs, ascribed to the oversized or undersized phase separation, unmanageable molecular stacking and crystallinity in small molecule blends.19–25 The oversized phase separation is detrimental to charge generation, while the undersized phase separation and unsuitable molecular arrangements go against charge extraction. How to manipulate the phase separation and molecular arrangement in blends to meet the need of efficient charge generation and extraction remains the main obstacle for further promoting the performance of ASM-OSCs.
Apart from molecular design and device engineering, the ternary strategy with multiple benefits has been certified as a versatile approach to separately or simultaneously optimize light absorption, energy levels and morphologies.26–28 Incorporating a third component with good compatibility and high crystallinity into binary blends can offer opportunities to modulate the molecular arrangement in ternary blends and thereby facilitate charge extraction and suppress the recombination, which has been extensively applied in different types of ternary OSCs.19,29–31 The good compatibility between the third component and donor (or acceptor) is a critical precondition to ensure the third component as a morphological modulator in ternary blends rather than a recombination center or morphological trap.32–35 It is well accepted that two components with good compatibility are favorable to form a well-mixed structure, while inferior compatibility originating from the strong intermolecular interaction will induce severe self-aggregation and oversized phase separation.36–38 Employing the characters of inferior compatibility between two components to control the phase separation is rarely reported in ternary blends. Inspired by these, if the third component possesses rational compatibility with the host donor and acceptor, well-developed morphology and efficient ASM-OSCs can be expected.
In this study, a small molecule acceptor Y7 as a morphology modulator was incorporated into a B1:BO-4Cl matrix to fabricate ternary ASM-OSCs. Y7 and BO-4Cl exhibit excellent compatibility, while Y7 shows poor compatibility with the donor B1. The good compatibility drives the two acceptors to form an alloy-like structure in ternary blends, which can provide chances to regulate the molecular arrangement for accelerating charge extraction. The poor compatibility between Y7 and B1 will provide a driving force to ameliorate the phase separation between the donor and acceptor in ternary blends, which helps to elevate charge separation, transport and collection. Incorporating 10 wt% Y7 in acceptors, the ternary ASM-OSCs generate an optimized PCE of 16.28% with a simultaneously increased short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.52 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.836 V and fill factor (FF) of 76.29%, benefiting from the favorable phase separation and molecular arrangement. This work puts forward a novel strategy based on rational compatibility in the ternary matrix to address the long-standing challenge of morphological modulation in ASM-OSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a exhibits the chemical structures of the three small molecules B1, BO-4Cl and Y7.20,39,40 The only difference between the two acceptors is that BO-4Cl has longer side chains of 2-butyloctyl than 2-ethylhexyl of Y7. The very similar chemical structure implies the good compatibility between the two acceptors. To investigate the compatibility of the three small molecules with each other, the contact angle (CA) of pure films was measured based on water and ethylene glycol (EG) liquid drops (Fig. 1b). Surface tension (γ) values of B1, BO-4Cl and Y7 were calculated on the basis of Wu's model.41 As displayed in Table S1 (ESI†), the γ is 23.0 mN m−1, 25.0 mN m−1 and 26.2 mN m−1 for B1, BO-4Cl and Y7, respectively. The compatibility between two different components can be assessed according to the equation of , where χ refers to the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter.37 The χ between BO-4Cl and Y7 (χBO-4Cl–Y7) was calculated to be about 0.014 that is much lower than the 0.042 for χB1–BO-4Cl and 0.104 for χB1–Y7, indicating the good compatibility between the two acceptors. Furthermore, interfacial tension values between two different materials were also calculated. The interfacial tension between BO-4Cl and Y7 (γBO-4Cl–Y7) is about 0.09 mN m−1 which is smaller than γB1–BO-4Cl ≈ 0.13 mN m−1 and γB1–Y7 ≈ 0.42 mN m−1, further certifying the good compatibility between BO-4Cl and Y7.42,43 It should be noted that the χB1–Y7 and γB1–Y7 exhibit the maximal values, which manifest the inferior compatibility between B1 and Y7. The good compatibility will cause the alloy-like formation of two acceptors for providing potential to regulate the molecular arrangement, and inferior compatibility between B1 and Y7 may provide the driving force to adjust the phase separation between the donor and acceptor in ternary blends. The well-developed phase separation and molecular arrangement are conducive to promoting the charge generation and extraction. Fig. 1c and d show the normalized absorption spectra and energy levels of B1, BO-4Cl and Y7, respectively. The two acceptors exhibit similar absorption spectra and energy levels, suggesting negligible energy transfer and charge transfer between the two acceptors in ternary blends.44,45 To study the effect of Y7 on the efficiency of ternary ASM-OSCs, various batches of binary and ternary ASM-OSCs were prepared based on the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (Fig. 1e). The detailed preparation and measurements of ASM-OSCs are presented in the ESI.†

The detailed current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all binary and ternary ASM-OSCs are displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It is apparent that the main photovoltaic parameters (JSC, VOC, FF and PCE) of the ASM-OSCs exhibit a similar variation tendency, which are gradually increased to the maximal values by adding 10 wt% Y7 in acceptors and then reduced with more Y7 addition. Owing to the similar energy levels of BO-4Cl and Y7, the increase of VOC should be attributed to the meliorative phase separation and molecular arrangement for efficient charge generation and extraction in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs.46,47 Furthermore, the higher JSC and FF are also benefited from the evolutionary morphology of the ternary blends with 10 wt% Y7. It is worth noting that the Y7-based binary cells (donor/acceptor = D/A = 1/1) show a negligible PCE and VOC, which is probably related to the coarse morphology caused by the inferior solubility (∼5 mg ml−1) of Y7 and poor compatibility between B1 and Y7. The photovoltaic properties of Y7-based binary cells with different D/A ratios were further studied. The optimized Y7-based binary cells (D/A = 1/0.3) achieve a PCE of 2.07%, which is much lower than that of other ASM-OSCs (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). For better understanding the effect of Y7 on the efficiency of ternary ASM-OSCs, detailed analyses and discussions are performed using three representative devices, including BO-4Cl-based binary cells and ternary ASM-OSCs with 10 wt% or 50 wt% Y7 in acceptors.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the BO-4Cl-based binary cells show a PCE of 15.15% with a JSC of 25.18 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.830 V and a FF of 72.48%, which are comparable with the reported values in the literature.20 In comparison to the binary cells, the ternary ASM-OSCs with 10 wt% Y7 achieve a relatively high JSC of 25.52 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.836 V and FF of 76.29%, leading to an optimized PCE of 16.28%. Fig. 2b and Table S3 (ESI†) summarize the PCE, JSC and FF values of efficient ASM-OSCs reported in the literature and this work. The PCE of 16.28% with decent JSC and FF should be among the top-ranked values of ASM-OSCs. An average PCE of 16.11% is acquired for the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, attesting the active influence of Y7 on performance improvement. The performance enhancement should be mainly profited from the improved morphology of the optimized ternary blends due to the feeble effect of the similar optical bandgap and energy levels of the two acceptors on JSC and VOC improvement. Incorporating 50 wt% Y7 in acceptors, the ternary ASM-OSCs deliver a PCE of 7.23% with a JSC of 13.95 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.798 V and a FF of 64.96%, which should be imputed to the decreased light absorption, charge separation, transport and collection. Fig. 2c displays the EQE spectra of the typical ASM-OSCs. The calculated JSCs by integrating EQE spectra agree well with those obtained from the corresponding J–V curves (∼3% mismatch). The optimized ternary ASM-OSCs show higher EQE values in the wavelength range from 500 nm to 800 nm, and slightly lower EQE values are observed in the longer wavelength range relative to BO-4Cl-based binary cells. The EQE values of ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7 are much lower than those of the other two kinds of cells in the whole wavelength range. To study the effect of Y7 on the light absorption and charge dynamics, the absorption spectra of the active layer in the typical ASM-OSCs and the corresponding internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra were measured using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R3011, Enlitech) and are portrayed in Fig. 2d and Fig. S3 (ESI†). In the wavelength range from 500 nm to 800 nm, the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs exhibit similar absorption spectra and higher IQE values relative to BO-4Cl-based binary cells, demonstrating the efficient charge separation, transport and collection in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs. The lower absorption in the longer wavelength range can account for the slightly lower EQE values of the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs. For the ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7, the slightly lower absorption spectra and much lower IQE values in the wavelength range from 500 nm to 800 nm suggest that the significantly reduced EQE values are mainly ascribed to the ineffective charge generation and extraction, which can be further confirmed by the absorption spectra of the active layer in Y7-based binary cells and the corresponding IQE spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†).

To better understand the impact of Y7 on charge generation and extraction in ternary blends, the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph − Veff) curves of typical ASM-OSCs were recorded (Fig. 3a). Here, Jph is calculated by JL − JD, where JL represents the current density under standard illumination, and JD is the dark current density. Veff is defined as V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage. The optimized ternary ASM-OSCs and BO-4Cl-based binary cells exhibit a similar saturated current density (Jsat) (Table S4, ESI†), while the Jph of the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs can rapidly approach saturation under relatively low Veff. The similar Jsat values manifest the weak effect of Y7 on light absorption in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, which is in accord with the absorption spectra of the corresponding ASM-OSCs. Rapidly saturated Jph further proves that the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs possess more efficient charge generation and extraction processes, which can be estimated by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions (ηg) and maximum power output conditions (ηe), respectively.48,49 The ηg is 95.90%, and ηe attains 87.30% for the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, which are slightly larger than those (94.84% and 83.54%) of BO-4Cl-based binary cells and much larger than those (81.96% and 65.16%) of ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7. The higher ηg and ηe values suggest that the phase separation and molecular arrangement can be finely modulated for acquiring efficient charge generation and extraction in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs. The JSC dependence on the light density of ASM-OSCs can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pαlight obeying the power-law, where α represents the bimolecular recombination degree in blends. As exhibited in Fig. 3b, the α is 0.988 for the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, which is larger than the 0.984 for BO-4Cl-based binary cells and 0.964 for ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7, revealing the weakest bimolecular recombination in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs. The charge recombination characteristic was further analysed by studying the photocarrier lifetime, which can be evaluated via performing transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements under open-circuit conditions.50–52 As displayed in Fig. 3c, the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs show the longest photocarrier lifetime of 19.08 μs in comparison to BO-4Cl-based binary cells (15.72 μs) and ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7 (12.69 μs). The prolonged photocarrier lifetime further confirms the effectively suppressed charge recombination in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs. The charge extraction time (τext) can be obtained by fitting the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay curves under short circuit conditions.53–55 The τext values are fitted to be 0.24 μs for the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, 0.36 μs for BO-4Cl-based binary cells and 0.46 μs for ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7. The shortest τext value indicates the efficient charge extraction process in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, which has an inseparable relationship with charge carrier mobility. Fig. 3e shows the photo-induced charge carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) curves, and the charge carrier mobility (μ) of the cells can be estimated based on the equation of  (if Δj < j(0)), where d is the active layer thickness, A is the ramp rate, tmax is the time when the extracted current reaches its maximum value, j(0) represents the dark capacitive current, and Δj is the transient current peak height.56–58 The calculated μ values are about 3.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BO-4Cl-based binary cells, optimized ternary ASM-OSCs and ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7, respectively. The charge carrier mobility was further investigated by employing the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S5, ESI†). The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) values are exhibited in Fig. 3f and Table S5 (ESI†). Similar to the results obtained from photo-CELIV measurements, the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs show higher μe and μh values than the other cells. Furthermore, more balanced charge carrier mobility can be obtained in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, suggesting finely optimized electron and hole transport channels by incorporating 10 wt% Y7. The efficient charge separation, transport and collection can well support the synchronous enhancement of JSC, VOC and FF in the optimized ASM-OSCs.

According to the above discussions, the performance improvement of the ternary ASM-OSCs should be mainly attributed to the upgraded morphology. As shown in Fig. 4, optical microscopy (OM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the surface and bulk morphology of binary and ternary blends. The OM images (Fig. 4a–c) of B1:BO-4Cl and ternary blends exhibit a similar color and smooth surface morphology. Owing to the inferior solubility of Y7 in chloroform, apparently grainy aggregations are observed in the OM images of pure Y7 films (Fig. S6, ESI†). It should be highlighted that obvious aggregations can also be seen in the B1:Y7 OM images (Fig. 4d), while BO-4Cl:Y7 blends show a smooth surface morphology. Those phenomena further demonstrate the good compatibility between the two acceptors and poor compatibility between B1 and Y7. The rough morphology of B1:Y7 blends is mainly caused by the inferior solubility of Y7 in chloroform and poor compatibility between B1 and Y7, which incapacitate the Y7-based binary cells for work and thereby produce negligible photovoltaic parameters. The average root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the B1:BO-4Cl blends is 1.16 nm and slightly increases to 1.38 nm by incorporating 10 wt% Y7, and further to 7.35 nm with 50 wt% Y7 addition, which hints at the effect of Y7 on morphology regulation. It is interesting that the average RMS roughness value of ternary blends with 50 wt% Y7 is even higher than the 3.57 nm of B1:Y7 blends. This may relate to the excessive aggregation of BO-4Cl and Y7 in ternary blends. Distinct phase separation can be seen from the AFM phase images of ternary blend films compared to those of binary blends (Fig. S7, ESI†). The TEM images of blends can provide more information about the phase separation. TEM images of B1:BO-4Cl blends exhibit a homogeneous distribution with a clearly fibrillar structure. Incorporating 10 wt% Y7 leads to a more obvious fibrillar structure and increased contrast of white and dark domains. The enhanced phase separation and well-formed nanofibrous and bi-continuous interpenetrating networks are in favor of charge generation and extraction, implying the positive effect of Y7 on morphology regulation. Moreover, numerous aggregations with high purity are observed from the TEM images of the optimized ternary blends, which may originate from the B1 crystals.59,60 Increasing the Y7 content to 50 wt% results in severe molecular aggregations because of the alloy-like formation of the two acceptors and strong intermolecular interaction between B1 and Y7, which gives rise to oversized phase separation and discrete interpenetrating networks in the ternary blends. The presence of small size crystals is beneficial for charge transport, while excessive and isolated aggregations will lead to a reduction in the charge generation and extraction. Much worse phase separation and a vague fibrillar structure can be seen from the TEM images of B1:Y7 blends, which can well explain the poor performance of the corresponding ASM-OSCs. These results suggest that phase separation in ternary blends can be well optimized for obtaining suitable interpenetrating networks to promote the charge generation and extraction by incorporating appropriate Y7 content.

To gain more insight into the correlation among device performance, charge dynamics and blends’ structural information on a molecular level, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. Fig. 5 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding OOP and IP curves of pure and blend films. The profiles of B1 exhibit a π–π stacking (010) peak at ∼1.72 Å−1 in the IP direction and quite strong multiple lamellar stacking (100, 200 and 300) peaks in the OOP direction, revealing an edge-on dominated molecular orientation in the B1 film. Similar to the most non-fullerene acceptors, both BO-4Cl and Y7 adopt a face-on orientation with different IP (100) peaks (∼0.39 Å−1 and ∼0.43 Å−1) and a similar OOP (010) peak (∼1.71 Å−1). From the 2D patterns and 1D profiles of B1:BO-4Cl blends, the OOP (100) peak of B1 is significantly reduced but presented in the IP direction, which indicates that most of the B1 molecules adopt a face-on orientation in the binary blends, resulting from the induction effect of BO-4Cl to B1. Moreover, an evident OOP (010) peak suggests that the face-on orientation of BO-4Cl is maintained in blend films. Incorporating 10 wt% Y7 in acceptors, stronger and steeper OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks can be clearly observed, confirming the overall enhanced crystallinity of the donor and acceptors in the optimized ternary blends. The slightly shifted OOP (010) peak (∼1.70 Å−1) in the optimized ternary blends corresponds to a smaller π–π stacking distance (d-spacing) of 3.70 Å relative to the 3.76 Å of B1:BO-4Cl blends (Table S6, ESI†). According to the Scherrer equation, the crystal coherence length (CCL) in the OOP direction for the optimized ternary blends is 4.25 nm that is much longer than the 2.88 nm in B1:BO-4Cl blends.61 Likewise, the appearance of an evident secondary lamellar stacking peak from B1 indicates the formation of B1 micro-crystallites in ternary blends with 10 wt% Y7 addition, which is in good agreement with the results observed in TEM images (Fig. 4j). The smaller d-spacing, longer CCL and presence of B1 micro-crystallites mainly benefit from the good compatibility between the two acceptors and inductive effect of the acceptor to donor, which are conducive to charge extraction in the optimized ternary blends. Incorporation of 50 wt% Y7 in ternary blends leads to a slightly weakened intensity of OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks as well as attenuated secondary lamellar stacking peak of B1, which should be part of the reason for depressed charge transport and collection in the corresponding ASM-OSCs. It is worth noting that the ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7 still possess a smaller d-spacing and longer CCL values (3.70 Å and 3.79 nm) than B1:BO-4Cl blends in the OOP direction. Combining the results from GIWAXS and TEM, depressed charge transport and collection in ternary ASM-OSCs with 50 wt% Y7 should be mainly imputed to the severe phase separation and discontinuous interpenetrating networks. In comparison to the other blends, the B1:Y7 blends exhibit the weakest OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks, ascribed to the inferior compatibility between B1 and Y7. It is obvious that the OOP (010) peaks in the profiles of binary and ternary blends are mainly contributed by the acceptors. Along with the increase of Y7 in acceptors, the near-linear shift of OOP (010) peaks indicates the formation of an alloy-like structure for the two acceptors in ternary blends.62–64 In the optimized ternary blends, not only the phase separation but also the molecular arrangement can be well tuned by incorporating appropriate Y7 content because of the rational compatibility in the ternary matrix.

Conclusions
In summary, high-performance ternary ASM-OSCs were designed and prepared by incorporating a small molecule acceptor Y7 into a B1:BO-4Cl matrix. The optimized ternary ASM-OSCs realize a top-ranked PCE of 16.28%, benefiting from the synergistically improved JSC, VOC and FF in comparison to those of binary cells. The performance improvement is mainly attributed to the well-developed phase separation and molecular arrangement for achieving efficient charge separation, transport and collection in the optimized ternary ASM-OSCs, which mostly rely on the excellent compatibility between the two acceptors and the poor compatibility between B1 and Y7. The excellent compatibility induces the two acceptors Y7 and BO-4Cl to form an alloy-like structure for regulating the molecular arrangement. Moreover, the inferior compatibility between B1 and Y7 can provide a driving force to manipulate the phase separation between the donor and acceptor. This work demonstrates that the ternary strategy is a promising method to improve the performance of ASM-OSCs by choosing components with rational compatibility.

Broader context
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have exhibited a broad market prospect owing to their multiple advantages of low-cost, light-weight, flexibility, semitransparency, and multiple colors. In comparison with other types of OSCs, all-small-molecule OSCs (ASM-OSCs) are more suitable for commercial-scale manufacturing on account of the advantages of small molecules, such as well-defined chemical molecular structures, easy synthesis and purification, and negligible batch-to-batch variation. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ASM-OSCs still lag far behind those of polymer/small molecule OSCs, ascribed to the unmanageable phase separation and molecular arrangement in small molecule blends. Herein, a strategy based on rational compatibility in a ternary matrix is put forward to address the long-standing challenge of morphological modulation, achieving an efficient PCE of over 16% for AMS-OSCs.
