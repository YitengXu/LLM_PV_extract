The approach involves slow injection of precursors with excess amounts of oleic acid. Retarded growth, due to both the slow supply of precursors and the surfeit of oleic acid, causes attachment of PbSe NCs through the (110) planes, which are more reactive than the (100) facet, into a two-dimensional geometry. In contrast, such attachment processes can be prevented by impurities, e.g., Cd chalcogenide (CdSe or CdS) NCs dispersed in chloroform. For instance, the slow injection of Pb and Se precursors into a reaction solution containing Cd chalcogenide NCs results in the growth of spherical PbSe NCs, as the Cd chalcogenide NCs hinder the PbSe nuclei from merging via (110) planes. Compared to conventional rapid-injection methods, PbSe NCs grow slowly, which enables fine control of NC size. Ab initio calculations suggest that Cd precursors strongly bound on the surface of PbSe NCs may impede nanosheet formation and may slow PbSe NC growth.
Introduction
The growth of nanocrystals (NCs) of controlled size and morphology has opened exciting opportunities to investigate structure–property relationships at the nanoscale.1 In particular, structural fine-tuning of semiconductor NCs enabled by colloidal synthesis has been the key motif for the successful integration of NCs in electronic and optical devices, as a semiconductor NC in the quantum confinement regime has an energy gap and carrier dynamics that strongly depend on its size and shape.2–4 For a typical growth, precursor chemicals are rapidly introduced into a hot solution containing capping ligands and coordinating or non-coordinating solvents. The rapid injection leads to quick nucleation, which is a prerequisite for the uniform size and shape of the resulting NCs. Understanding the interactions around the NC surface is important for precise control of the size and shape of the colloidal NCs.5–8
Colloidal PbSe (NCs) have been the focus of recent interest largely because the size-tunability of their band gap through the near infrared promises applications in photovoltaic devices,9,10 photodetectors,11 and light-emitting diodes.12 For example, carrier multiplication (CM) – a process in which a semiconductor absorbs one photon to generate multiple excitons – has been extensively investigated in PbSe NCs. It has been argued that, compared to their bulk counterpart, PbSe NCs show high CM efficiency, which could ultimately increase the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of solar cells.13,14 A critical, although often unstated, condition for realizing high-performance devices from PbSe NCs is that the NCs should be synthesized with precisely controlled size.15 However, the hot-injection method conventionally used for the growth of PbSe NCs involves short reaction times (∼30 s), a potential source of significant batch-to-batch variations.
Besides size, the shape of PbSe NCs also plays a role in their photophysics. For example, Sandberg et al. demonstrated that the CM efficiency in PbSe NCs increased when the NCs were synthesized in the shape of rods.16 The authors observed that the anisotropy renders the NCs a better charge carrier transport channel, which could enhance the performance of many optoelectronic devices. These results highlight the importance of synthesizing PbSe nanostructures with controlled anisotropy.
The reactivity differences of surface facets on PbSe NCs underlie the growth of non-spherical shapes, such as nanorods,17 nanowires,18,19 and nanoplates.20,21 With an isotropic rock-salt cubic crystal structure,22 however, it takes exquisite care to make anisotropic nanostructures of PbSe,17 and published recipes for the growth of anisotropic Pb chalcogenide NCs involve delicate and subtle reaction steps.17,19 For example, Schliehe et al. introduced various cosolvents to obtain ultrathin sheets with prominent photoconductive properties.20 However, each product from different cosolvents has different features from one another and the synthetic procedure is too fast to examine the sheet formation process in detail.
In this article, we report a facile preparation of anisotropic PbSe nanosheets (NSs) in the colloidal phase. One distinctive change we introduced in the study is the slow injection of precursors (∼1 mL min−1 rate), as compared to rapid injection widely used in conventional NC growth. In addition, an excess amount of a coordinating ligand, oleic acid (OA), was used to further slow the growth. Controlled amounts of impurities, e.g., Cd chalcogenide NCs, were introduced to examine whether interactions between specific PbSe crystal planes can be altered.
Experimental section
Chemicals
The following chemicals were used without additional treatment: lead oxide (PbO, Aldrich, 99.999%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, Aldrich, 97%), oleic acid (Aldrich 90%), phenyl ether (TCI, 97%), selenium (Se, Aldrich, 99.999%), cadmium oxide (CdO, Aldrich, 97%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, Aldrich, 99%), 1-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA, Alfa Aesar, 98%), and octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA, TCI, 98%).
Synthesis methods
Synthesis of Cd chalcogenide NRs and NCs. We first prepared CdSe NRs via a modified version of a previously reported recipe.23 Initially, we mixed 51.4 mg of CdO, 0.1332 g of TOPO, and 0.2232 g of TDPA in a three-neck flask and degassed the mixture under vacuum at 90 °C for 30 min. We then heated the mixture to 320 °C while stirring under Ar for 1 h. When the solution turned optically clear, the mixture was cooled to 270 °C, at which point, we rapidly injected 2.4 mL of 0.2 M Se–TOP solution whereupon we set the reaction temperature to 250 °C. We quenched the reaction after 1 h. After two washing steps with methanol as antisolvent, the product was dispersed in hexane.In order to prepare CdSe NCs, we referred to a published recipe.24 We mixed 3.0 g of TOPO, 0.280 g of ODPA, and 0.060 g of CdO in a 25 mL flask and heated these to 150 °C under vacuum for about 1 h. We next heated the mixture under Ar to 320 °C, by which point it had turned optically clear and colorless. At this point, we injected 1.5 g of TOP into the flask whereupon the mixture was further heated to 360 °C for a reaction with TOP–Se solution (58 mg of Se, and 360 mg of TOP). The reaction started immediately upon injection of the Se–TOP solution. 3 min after the injection, we quenched the reaction. The solution was mixed with methanol and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. We collected the precipitate in toluene and washed it with methanol one more time to ensure the removal of excess organic ligands.
For the preparation of CdS NCs, we followed a well-known synthetic protocol.25 First, we prepared a mixture of 25.6 mg of CdO, 1.91 mL of OA, and 7.96 mL of ODE, which we then maintained under vacuum for 1 h at 60 °C. We subsequently heated the mixture under Ar to 300 °C, by which point it had turned optically clear and colorless. At this point, we rapidly injected a solution of 32 mg of sulfur in 5.06 mL of ODE into the initial solution at 300 °C. 1 min after the injection, we quenched the reaction. The solution was mixed with methanol, 1-butanol, and acetone and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The precipitate was then collected in toluene and washed with methanol, 1-butanol, and acetone.

Synthesis of PbSe NSs. For the synthesis of PbSe NSs and NCs, we used a pair of similar protocols modified from a procedure in the literature.26 We prepared the precursor solution by adding 1 mL of phenyl ether, 7.5 mL of oleic acid (OA), and 0.1935 g of PbO in a flask (Flask 1). In another flask (Flask 2), we loaded 10 mL of DPE. Next, we degassed both flasks at 60 °C for 20 min. After that, while heating Flask 1 under Ar flow to 120 °C for 30 min, we heated Flask 2 under Ar flow to 130 °C. We allowed Flask 1 to cool to room temperature, and then injected 0.8 mL of 1 M solution of Se in TOP into it. Finally, we slowly injected (60 mL h−1) the mixture in Flask 1 into Flask 2 via a syringe pump.
Slow growth of spherical PbSe NCs. All the procedures are identical to those in the synthesis of PbSe NSs except that we added 2.2 mL of a 5.5 mg mL−1 solution of CdSe NRs (9.3 ± 1.3 nm in length and 3.0 ± 0.3 nm in width) in diphenyl ether in Flask 2 and heated the solution to 150 °C, at which point we injected the mixture containing Pb–oleate and Se–TOP into the reaction flask at a rate of 1 mL min−1. It took about 9.5 min to complete the injection of the precursor solution in our typical reaction.
Computation
We used ab initio plane-wave methods for our calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We employed the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional27 and all-electron-like projector-augmented wave potentials28 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).29 Plane waves with a kinetic cut-off energy of 400 eV were used as a basis set. All atomic forces were fully relaxed to less than 0.02 eV Å−1, and the electronic energy converges with a variation of less than 10−5 eV. For surface structures of PbSe, we used slab models with six (100) and ten (110) atomic layers that have a slab thickness of 15 and 20 Å, respectively, and with a vacuum separation of 15 Å. The surface energy γ was calculated with γ = [Eslab − Ebulk]/A, where E is the DFT total energy for slab and bulk systems, and A is the surface area. The binding energy of Pb– and Cd–oleate precursors on the surface was calculated with Ebind = [E(slab) + E(precursor) − E(slab−precursor)].
Characterization
UV-vis and near-infrared (nIR) absorption spectra were recorded with a UV/vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV 3600), and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained with a Dongwoo Optron SC100-LT77K spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai F20 (300 K)), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Sigma Probe), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100) were the primary equipment for characterization of the morphology and composition of products. We used an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-IIIC (3 kW)) to investigate the crystalline structure of synthesis products.
Results and discussion
The NSs are characterized by a well-defined structure. The AFM images in Fig. 1a–c reveal that the products have a two-dimensional geometry. The thickness of the nanoplates was measured from the edge of NS clusters, and the average was 4.3 nm with a standard deviation of 0.5 nm. The NSs typically form stacks as shown in Fig. 1d. The van der Waals attraction is responsible for the stacking, as was the case in studies of PbS,20,30 PbSe,21 and PbTe31 NSs. Mild sonication of the NS suspension results in the dissociation of NS clusters into individual NSs (Fig. 1e). As for the fully-grown NSs, the size in the lateral dimension was about 200 nm while its distribution was relatively large.

(e) TEM image of isolated PbSe NS. 
In order to identify how the PbSe NSs form as the reaction time elapses, we analyzed TEM images (Fig. 2) of the aliquots taken at different reaction times. As the reaction progresses, PbSe NCs start to patch into ∼10 nm clumps within 5 min (Fig. 2a and b and S1 in ESI†) and eventually evolve into larger single crystals. At ∼10 min (Fig. 2c), holey sheets emerge and the patching process continues until the larger clumps become single crystalline at ∼30 min (Fig. 2d). The samples collected at or after 30 min were single-crystalline PbSe according to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in Fig. 2e. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of the samples collected after 30 min of the reaction reveals that the zone axis coincides with the [100] direction of the PbSe crystal. In other words, the flat surfaces of the laterally extended PbSe NSs are (100) planes. This is corroborated by X-ray diffraction patterns from the sample collected at 60 min (Fig. 2f), in which the peak ratio of (200)/(111) is 11.3, much greater than the bulk value of 2.7 (JCPDS-ICDD card 06-0354). When PbSe NCs grow, reactive (110) planes remain on the surface at a size of 3–4 nm.32 Since the (110) facets are more reactive than the OA-bound (111) and the (100) planes, the growth of PbSe NCs occurs in such a way as to remove as many (110) planes on the surface as possible.33,34 In a conventional rapid-injection synthesis, Pb–oleate and Se–TOP quickly decompose to release Pb and Se adatoms. The morphology of PbSe NCs becomes cubic at prolonged reaction times, naturally minimizing the (110)-plane population.35 On the contrary, excess OA in our experimental setup likely slows the decomposition of Pb–oleate.36–38 During the retarded growth, small PbSe NCs fuse to share their (110) facets with neighboring particles. HRTEM analysis of the sample at 5 min confirms that the attachment occurs at (110) facets (see Fig. 2b for example). The growth continues, and the patches turn into NSs with occasional holes. The holes feature corrugated surfaces and the angles separating the neighboring planes are 90° (corresponding to the angle between two (100) facets) or 135° (corresponding to the angle between (100) and (110) planes) (Fig. 2c). This is another indication that the attached NCs maintain highly reactive (110) facets under the reaction conditions. At 30 min and beyond, continuous, single-crystalline NSs are formed (Fig. 2d and e).

One obvious question is what drives this anisotropic, two-dimensional growth in the NSs. We postulate the large amount of OA may not only slow the growth kinetics, but also stabilize some Pb–oleate complex on (100) planes, which can prevent further attachment to the lateral surface.39 We examined the hypothesis by calculating the surface energies of (100) and (110) surfaces via first-principles DFT (Fig. 3). We obtained 1.31 and 2.58 eV nm−2 for the bare (100) and (110), respectively, and 0.95 and 2.08 eV nm−2 for the Pb-acetate covered (100) and (110) planes, respectively.36 We did not consider the oleate-passivated (111) facet because it clearly exhibits high surface energy.32 The results are consistent with our experimental observation that large (100) facets are exposed in the PbSe NSs as a result of fast growth along the [110] direction of a rock-salt PbSe crystal. Another interesting result of our DFT calculation is that Pb2+ precursors bind to (100) and (110) facets with binding energy of 0.62 and 1.23 eV, respectively. According to the simulation, the Pb precursor remains nearly intact on the (100) surface, whereas the precursor is dissociated on the (110) surface. The dissociated form of acetate or oleate would bind weakly with Pb2+, which potentially explains the fast growth and attachment along the [110] direction. On the other hand, the intact Pb-acetate precursors on the (100) surface likely block the growth and attachment of the surface.

Previous studies that reported Pb chalcogenide NS growth required the introduction of additional precursors, ligands, polymers, or chlorine-containing compounds (e.g., 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), 1,2-dichloropropane (DCP), or 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE))20 into the reaction. For example, the chlorine-containing cosolvents serve as Pb complexing agents, thereby altering the kinetics of nucleation and growth of NCs. In this study, we aimed to realize the same consequence – slow growth – without injecting the additional chemicals into the reaction. We simply used an excess amount of OA for retardation of the nanocrystal growth and injected the precursors slowly (1 mL min−1 rate) using a syringe pump. The excess OA (OA:PbO molar ratio = 27:1) slowed the growth,36,38 maintaining the NC size at 3–4 nm for a long enough time to permit NC–NC fusion at (110) facets. Once the small NCs fused by sharing (110) facets, sidewalls of the fused NCs then became unstable compared with planar (100) surfaces with a Pb–oleate protective layer. Consequently, further attachment occurs at the side (110) facets of the forming NSs. Slow injection of precursors also contributes to the anisotropic growth according to the ‘nucleation and growth’ model proposed by LaMer and Dinegar.40 When the NCs nucleate during the slow injection, the concentration of adatoms quickly drops. This favors growth via agglomeration since the supply of adatoms is too slow.
We also measured absorption spectra of the aliquots taken at different reaction times of the NS growth (Fig. S2†). A broad peak at ca. 430 nm evolves during the course of reaction. For example, 5 min into the reaction, the absorption spectrum shows no noticeable features, whereas a broad hump at 430 nm appears at ∼10 min. This feature becomes more pronounced as the reaction progresses. Notably, 430 nm is near the energy of the E2 critical-point peak in the bulk PbSe dielectric function.41
Calculation of the quantum confinement effect on the bandgap of nanoscale PbSe can be performed using the effective mass approximation (EMA)42 or a more accurate, anisotropic, non-parabolic, four-band envelope-function.43 For an infinite confinement potential along the [100] direction, except in the case of the very thinnest NSs, a carrier at the L point is always close to satisfying the quantization condition on the momentum, and the confinement-induced change in the gap is consequently small. Indeed, for an even number of atomic layers (integral number of unit cells), the quantization condition is exactly satisfied by a carrier at the L point, and, to a first approximation, the gap is unchanged.44 Tight binding calculations indicate that only for (100) nanosheets below about 2 nm thickness does the confinement energy exceed 0.4 eV, and that for 4.3 nm thick NSs the confinement energy is not more than 0.20 eV.41 Given such moderate confinement, the monotonically increasing absorbance (i.e., the absence of peaks in the low energy absorption) with wavelength from about 1800 nm (Fig. S2†) is fully expected. Consistent with small confinement energy, no radiative recombination could be detected above 0.38 eV, the lower limit of our instrument response.
We introduced CdSe nanorods (NRs) as a template to see whether the slow growth of PbSe NCs could form type-II hetero-nanostructures of PbSe and CdSe,3 e.g., PbSe-tipped CdSe NR dumbbell structures.26 We expected that PbSe would grow selectively on the tips of CdSe NRs. Interestingly, the anticipated PbSe-tipped CdSe NRs did not form. Instead, upon injection of the Pb and Se precursors, the CdSe NRs disappeared according to TEM and elemental analysis. The disappearance or breakdown of the CdSe NRs was corroborated by the color change shown in Fig. 4a and b: the red solution of the CdSe NRs turned to dark brown or black by the time the injection was complete. As the 1S exciton absorption peak of the CdSe NRs disappeared, a peak in the infrared range evolved (Fig. 4d) as spherical PbSe NCs grew from 5.1 ± 0.3 nm at 5 min to 7.2 ± 0.4 nm at 120 min (see Fig. 4c and S3† for TEM images). The average size of each PbSe NC sample estimated from the 1S exciton peak using the EMA coincides with the size measured in TEM (Fig. S3†). The disappearance of the CdSe NRs was unexpected, while the excess OA was expected to slow the growth of PbSe. Fig. 4e shows absorption and PL spectra of CdSe NRs before and after annealing at 150 °C for 1 h. Neither the 1S exciton peak at 570 nm nor the PL peak at 580 nm underwent a shift during the annealing, which suggests that the CdSe NRs were stable at the reaction temperature.

The times in the figs indicate the time after the completion of injection. 
To examine whether the excess OA corroded CdSe NCs, we carried out a control experiment in which CdSe NRs in phenyl–ether were mixed with excess OA at 150 °C for 1 h (Fig. S4†). No noticeable change was observed from either spectroscopic data or TEM analysis, so the excess OA alone does not cause the CdSe NRs to breakdown. Pb–oleate is likely responsible for the breakdown of CdSe NRs via cation exchange.45 To understand how PbSe forms during the injection of Pb–oleate and Se precursors, we took aliquots at different times during the 9 min injection of Pb–oleate and Se precursors into a phenyl ether solution containing CdSe NRs at 150 °C. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of the aliquots with the times listed in Fig. 5 indicating the time after the start of injection. The 1S absorption peak of CdSe NRs had blue-shifted by 21 nm with slight broadening within 3 min of injection, and the peak disappeared before 5 min had elapsed since the start of the reaction. The PbSe 1S peak is relatively broad at the initial stage (TEM in Fig. S5† and absorption spectrum in Fig. 5), as the excess OA retards the growth of the PbSe NCs. Then the growth reaches the “size focusing” stage, as represented in the narrower peaks in absorption spectra of the later samples. Repeating the preceding procedures but replacing CdSe NRs by CdSe NCs still resulted in slow growth of mono-disperse PbSe NCs as shown in Fig. 6. This indicates that CdSe morphology is not the key issue. XRD patterns in Fig. 7 also reflect the complete change from CdSe NCs (Fig. 7a) to PbSe NCs (Fig. 7b), which was also verified in XPS data: no Cd appeared in PbSe NCs synthesized through the “CdSe-seed” approach. According to our theoretical predictions based on first-principle calculations, small amounts of Cd clusters adsorbed on the (110) planes of PbSe are likely to desorb during the washing steps. Also, to examine whether chalcogen atoms in Cd chalcogenide clusters diffuse into the resulting PbSe NCs, we performed the PbSe NC growth in the presence of CdS NCs instead of the CdSe NCs. The growth of PbSe NCs remained slow, and no sulfur was found in the PbSe NCs (Fig. S6†). We conjecture that decomposed Cd–oleate prevents PbSe NS formation by minimizing the driving force for PbSe NS formation. The driving force is derived from the reactivity of (110) facets of PbSe nuclei. We presume that the PbSe (110) facets are passivated by Cd–oleate precursors that form after decomposition of CdSe NRs.

Fig. 8 shows binding configurations of a Cd–acetate complex on PbSe (100) and (110) surfaces. The binding energies of the Cd precursor on the (100) and (110) facets are 0.92 and 1.65 eV, respectively. The estimation suggests that Cd2+ ions bind to PbSe surfaces more strongly than Pb2+. The firm bonding between Cd–oleate defect complex and a PbSe (110) surface could impede the oriented attachment of PbSe NCs into NSs that otherwise formed without Cd species.

We further investigated if there are electronic changes between PbSe NSs and NCs through XPS analysis (Fig. S7 in ESI†). Pb 4f peaks from two different samples in the range between 133 and 147 eV arise from the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 levels of Pb. Deconvolution of the peaks from PbSe NSs and slowly grown PbSe NCs reveals that the two samples exhibit similar contributions from two different Pb states.46 For example, the spectra of both PbSe NSs and PbSe NCs show not only high intensity of the low-energy state of each Pb orbital but also a low intensity of the high-energy states of each Pb orbital. The high-energy orbital states are indicators of the surface abundance of Pb–O adducts, which we believe are derived from OA bound to Pb on the Pb-rich surface of the samples. In Se 3d scans of the PbSe NSs and NCs, we could not observe binding energies corresponding to elemental Se (55.3 eV)47 or Se4+ (59 eV) in SeO32− or SeO2. Only photoelectrons from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals of Se2− ions in PbSe are detected. Therefore, the XPS analysis reveals that PbSe NCs produced in the presence of CdSe NCs show no electronic changes of Pb or Se.
Fig. 9 shows growth curves of PbSe nanostructures via four different routes. First, the increase in the OA-to-Pb ratio from 2.9 (black filled circles) to 27 (red hollow circles) in the conventional ‘hot-injection’ method appears to slow down the growth rate for PbSe NCs, which is in agreement with literature reports.36–38 Interestingly, the addition of CdSe NCs (blue filled squares) results in the decrease of the growth rate compared to PbSe NCs grown without CdSe NCs (red hollow circle). Passivation of the most reactive (110) facets of the PbSe surface by Cd–oleate precursors is responsible for the growth of individual PbSe NCs, without the agglomeration seen in the case of NS growth. When Pb and Se precursors were slowly injected and CdSe NCs were present in the solution (purple hollow squares), the growth rate was even slower. Compared to the conventional rapid-injection method, our CdSe-based approach showed 2 orders-of-magnitude lower rate of PbSe NC growth, making it much easier to control the size. For example, to grow ∼4 nm PbSe NCs, one needs to pull the reaction vessel out of the heating mantle into the ice bath after ∼30 s of reaction time, according to published recipes.48 Naturally, it becomes challenging to synthesize PbSe NCs of target size with atomic precision via the rapid-injection approach. On the other hand, the slow growth presented in this system enables such a precision via the rapid-injection approach. In the case of slow injection, the PbSe NCs are still highly monodisperse after 60 min of growth. Fig. 10 shows the trends in PbSe NC growth depending on different concentrations of single-sized (3.8 nm in diameter) CdSe NCs. The number of CdSe NCs in the more concentrated CdSe dispersion was approximately 4.5 times larger than in the diluted one. For the same reaction time, the rate of increase of the diameter of PbSe NCs synthesized with the more concentrated solution of CdSe NCs was 1.3 times lower than the other. With higher CdSe NC concentration, the number of PbSe nuclei is larger, and therefore each nucleus receives a smaller supply of monomers. This leads to a slower growth rate than when more diluted CdSe NCs are used (see Fig. S8† for the absorption spectra). This ultimately prevents NS formation via (110) fusion.

Note that the diameter and the reaction time described indicate the diameter of individual PbSe NCs and the reaction time after the start of injection, respectively. 
Scheme 1 summarizes the growth pathways for PbSe NSs and PbSe NCs in our system. Both slow injection and excess amounts of OA are responsible for the two-dimensional NS growth (at the top of Scheme 1). The laterally extended PbSe NSs form as a result of an oriented attachment of small PbSe crystallites when the growth of the individual crystallites is effectively halted by the surplus OA. The growth of PbSe NCs appears to be altered when Cd chalcogenide NCs or NRs are present in the reaction vessel (at the bottom of Scheme 1). Our experimental results reveal that CdSe NCs are degraded by Pb precursors, and the resulting decomposed Cd–oleate precursors are likely to passivate the reactive (110) surface of PbSe NCs. This inhibits the growth of PbSe NSs via fusion of the (110) surfaces, and once the (110) surfaces disappear, PbSe NCs grow in a slow fashion. As a result, the facile growth of NSs and delicate size control of NCs are possible.

Conclusions
We have shown a facile synthesis of two-dimensional PbSe NSs and slowly grown PbSe NCs. The key strategy for the growth of PbSe NSs is to introduce precursor at a slow rate in the presence of excess OA. These two factors helped ∼4 nm sized PbSe NCs grow via oriented attachment at the most reactive (110) facets, leading to laterally extended PbSe NSs with an average thickness of 4.3 nm. The slow precursor injection led to deficient monomer concentrations of Pb and Se at the initial stage of the reaction, resulting in small PbSe crystallites with (110) facets. Simultaneously, an excess of OA in the precursor solution kept the starting PbSe NCs small so that the NCs have (110) facets at the initial stage. However, growth was completely different when CdSe NCs or NRs, or CdS NCs were dispersed in phenyl ether solution prior to precursor injection. Cd–oleate precursor adsorbed on the (110) plane of PbSe NCs effectively prohibit attachment between PbSe NCs. The beauty of this CdSe-based approach is that growth is significantly retarded, and size-control becomes much easier than in conventional rapid-injection approaches. The demonstrated synthetic methods underscore the importance of understanding the interactions between surface planes, which decisively control the morphology of final products.

B, 1997, 14, 1632–1646 CrossRef CAS .A one-dimensional NS of thickness d = 4.3 nm corresponds to a potential well of precisely 7 PbSe lattice constants (7a = 4.284 nm, where a is the lattice constant). For confinement along the (100) direction (the X direction) by an infinite potential, the quantization condition is kX = nπ/d, where n is an integer and d is the NS thickness. Since the bulk band gap is at the L point, where = π/a(1,1,1) and a is the bulk lattice constant, the projection of the wave vector of a bulk band-edge carrier in the X direction is π/a, and the quantization condition is automatically satisfied for a NS with a thickness d = na, i.e., for a thickness of an integer number of PbSe lattice constants. For 7 PbSe layers, tight-binding calculations suggest the bandgap of a NS of thickness 4.3 nm is not larger than 0.48 eV, but spectroscopic analysis reveals no bandgap in this region. This may be due to defects in the PbSe NSs (ref. 41).D. C. Lee, I. Robel, J. M. Pietryga and V. I. Klimov, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2010, 132, 9960–9962 CrossRef CAS PubMed .M. Sykora, A. Y. Koposov, J. A.
