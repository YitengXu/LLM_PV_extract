    , Accepted 23rd December 2014First published on 24th December 2014AbstractNine IIB group complexes, [ZnL1Cl2] (Zn1), [CdL1Cl2]2 (Cd1), [HgL1Cl2] (Hg1), [ZnL2Cl2] (Zn2), [CdL2Cl2] (Cd2), [HgL2Cl2] (Hg2), [ZnL3Cl2] (Zn3), [CdL3Cl2] (Cd3) and [HgL3Cl2] (Hg3), have been synthesized from the corresponding ortho-(6-methoxy-pyridyl)(CHNAr) (where Ar = 2,6–iPr2C6H3, L1; 4–MeC6H4, L2; 2–OMeC6H4, L3) Schiff base and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H NMR and X-ray single-crystal analysis. Crystallographic studies reveal that the center metal of the complexes adopts a distorted tetrahedron geometry (except for Cd1 and Cd3, which display square pyramidal geometry) and C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions contribute to three-dimensional supramolecular structures. The series of complexes exhibit tunable luminescence from blue, through green, to light yellow by varying the temperature (298 K and 77 K), both in solution and in the solid state. Moreover, the quantum yields range from 0.027 to 0.422, and decrease according to the order of the periodic table (Zn > Cd > Hg). These results indicate that the center atom of the complexes leads to the geometry differences and hence to the tunable luminescence properties. Because Zn1–Zn3 exhibited higher molar extinction coefficients and a distinct absorption region, they were employed as co-sensitizers in ruthenium dye N719-sensitized photoanodes to deliver light-electricity efficiency enhancement, being assembled with counter-electrodes and electrolyte to prepare ZnX/N719 (where ZnX = Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3) co-sensitized dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) devices. The prepared co-absorbent could overcome the deficiency of N719 absorption in the low-wavelength region of the visible spectrum, and offset competitive visible-light absorption of I3−. Application of these prepared complexes in N719-sensitized solar cells enhanced their performance by 10–36%, which indicated a potential application of these types of complexes in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, the design and synthesis of organic–inorganic hybrid complexes based on strong coordinate bonds and multiple weak non-covalent forces has become a rapidly expanding field of research field in coordination chemistry and crystal engineering. These complexes not only possess fascinating structural features but also show interesting properties as new functional materials, which can be used in the areas of luminescence, sensors, separation, adsorption, catalysis and biological chemistry, etc.1–4 Moreover, in recent years, researchers have begun to focus on the potential applications of organometallic complexes with optical properties in co-sensitized dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).5,6
Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) ions often adopt different coordination modes, such as four-, five- or six-coordination modes when they react with organic ligands with N, O donors.7 The design and synthesis of new organic ligands is a key approach for the construction of metal–organic complexes with desired structures. Schiff bases still play an important role in metal coordination chemistry, even after almost a century since their discovery.8 They are considered “privileged ligands” and are the most widely used, due to the diversity of synthetic methods that are available, their remarkable versatility and their good solubility in common solvents. A large number of Schiff bases have been synthesized and extensively studied because of their characteristic properties, such as novel structures, thermal stability, relevant biological properties, high synthesis flexibility and medicinal utility.9 The possibility of structural changes and the existence of different supramolecular structures after coordination are the key phenomena responsible for the photochromic behavior of the complexes based on aromatic Schiff bases with hydrogen bonds.10 The relatively complex photobehavior of these complexes, related to their rotational flexibility, needs to be well understood.11 The introduction of different small anions can also have a significant effect on the structural construction of complexes and their properties. In coordination chemistry, halogen ions have been widely used as anions for the construction of metal coordination complexes because they can adjust the topologies of complexes through different coordinate bonds or non-covalent interactions.12
To gain insight into the influence of Schiff-base ligands with different functional groups in constructing Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) complexes, we studied the synthesis, stability, and photoelectric properties of complexes that used the following three newly-synthesized Schiff bases, namely, ortho-(6-methoxy-pyridyl)(CHNAr) (where Ar = 2,6–iPr2C6H3, L1; 4–MeC6H4, L2; 2–OMeC6H4, L3). By self-assembly, a series of novel Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) complexes were synthesized: [ZnL1Cl2] (Zn1), [CdL1Cl2]2 (Cd1), [HgL1Cl2] (Hg1), [ZnL2Cl2] (Zn2), [CdL2Cl2] (Cd2), [HgL2Cl2] (Hg2), [ZnL3Cl2] (Zn3), [CdL3Cl2] (Cd3) and [HgL3Cl2] (Hg3). The rational design of Schiff bases with functional groups in different positions not only influences structural diversity but also considerably determines the luminescent properties.13 Generally, the scale of the π-conjugated system and the electronic effect of substituents on the ligand are effective factors for controlling the emission color, as well as the photoluminescence efficiency.14 With the objective of achieving light-electricity efficiency enhancement, and taking into account the absorption of light in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum,15 we used Zn1–Zn3 to prepare ZnX/N719 co-sensitized dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) devices, on account of their suitable absorption and energy levels. The application of these prepared complexes in N719-sensitized solar cells enhanced the performance by 10–36%, which indicates a potential application in DSSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. General information
All reagents were analytical grade from commercial sources and were used directly without any further purification. Aniline derivatives (2,6-diisopropylaniline, 4-methylaniline and 2-methoxyaniline) and 6-methoxy-2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde were purchased from Aldrich Co., Ltd and Rui Yi Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China), respectively. Metal salts were purchased from Ji Nan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd (Shandong, China). Solvents for reaction and photophysical studies were dried and freshly distilled under dry nitrogen gas before use. 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer using Si(CH3)4 as an internal standard at room temperature. Elemental analysis for C, H, and N was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 automatic analyzer. Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer, with samples prepared as KBr discs. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured with a CHI660d electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China), using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, Fluka, electrochemical grade) in ethanol as the solvent. The solid-state and solution photoluminescence analyses were carried out on an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer in the range of 200–800 nm. The visible detector, as well as the lifetime set-up, was a red-sensitive photomultiplier (type r928). Lifetime studies were performed using a photon-counting system with a microsecond pulse lamp as the excitation source. The emission decays were analyzed by the sum of exponential functions. The decay curve was well fitted into a double exponential function: I = I0 + A1exp(–t/τ1) + A2exp(–t/τ2), where I and I0 are the luminescent intensities at time t = t and t = 0, respectively, whereas τ1 and τ2 are defined as the luminescent lifetimes. The average lifetime was calculated according to the following equation: (1)
The luminescence quantum yields of complexes were measured in CH3CN at room temperature and cited relative to a reference solution of quinine sulfate (Φ = 0.546 in 0.5 mol dm−3 H2SO4) as a standard, and they were calculated according to the well-known equation:10 (2)
In eqn (2), n, A, and I denote the refractive index of solvent, the area of the emission spectrum, and the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, respectively, and φref represents the quantum yield of the standard quinine sulfate solution. The subscript ref denotes the reference, and the absence of a subscript implies an unknown sample. For the determination of the quantum yield, the excitation wavelength was chosen so that A < 0.05.
2.2. X-ray structure determinations of complexes
Single crystals of nine complexes suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained from CH3OH or CH3OH/CH2Cl2. Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), operating at 293 ± 2 K. Details of the crystal data, data collection and structure refinements are summarized in Table 1. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using the SHELXTL 5.1 software package (Sheldrick G M. SHELXTL NT Crystal Structure Analysis Package [CP], version 5.10; Bruker AXS, Analytical X-ray System: Madison, WI, 1999). The hydrogen atoms residing on the carbon atoms were located geometrically. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.

2.3. Assembly and measurement of DSSCs
Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using the following procedure. The TiO2 paste was cast onto the FTO substrate by a screen-printing method, followed by drying at 10 °C for 5 min; this process was repeated six times, and then followed by sintering at 500 °C for 15 min in air to obtain a transparent TiO2 photoelectrode with a thickness of ca. 10 μm. The co-sensitized electrodes were prepared by immersing the obtained mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode into 0.3 mM Zn1, Zn2 or Zn3 solution in absolute ethanol for 2 h and washing with ethanol and drying with a blower, then further immersing the electrodes in 0.3 mM N719 solution in absolute ethanol for 12 h, and then washing with ethanol and drying with a blower again. The single N719-sensitized electrodes were prepared by only immersing the TiO2 photoelectrode into 0.3 mM N719 solution in absolute ethanol for 14 h. The electrolyte used in this work was 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.1 M tert-butyl pyridine in a 1:1 (volume ratio) of acetonitrile-propylene carbonate. The platinum counter-electrode was prepared by depositing H2PtCl6 paste onto the FTO glass substrates and then sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The cells were assembled by sandwiching the electrolyte between the dye-sensitized photoanode and the counter-electrode and the assembly was held together using mini-binder clips.
Photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter, using a mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2. The irradiance of AM1.5 global sunlight from a filtered 500 W xenon lamp light source was set at 100 mW cm−2 and was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (no. NIMMS1123, calibrated by the National Institute of Metrology, P. R. China). Based on the I–V curve, the fill factor (FF) was defined as: FF = (Jmax × Vmax)/(Jsc × Voc), where Jmax and Vmax are the photocurrent density and photovoltage for maximum power output, and Jsc and Voc are the short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage, respectively. The overall energy conversion efficiency η was defined as: η = (FF × Jsc × Voc)/Pin where Pin is the power of the incident light. EIS were recorded with a CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer (Chenhua, China), and the measurements were taken over a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz under standard global AM1.5 solar irradiation. Dark currents were also recorded with a CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of ligands and complexes
Three new ligands ortho-(6-methoxy-pyridyl)(CHNAr) (where Ar = 2,6–iPr2C6H3, L1; 4–MeC6H4, L2; 2–OMeC6H4, L3) were synthesized by the condensation of 6-methoxy-2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with the corresponding aniline in refluxing anhydrous methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of formic acid (Scheme 1). All complexes Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 were self-assembled by the reaction of Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Hg(II) chloride and corresponding ligands at refluxing temperature. The formation of the Schiff-base complexes can be rationalized in the light of a template effect of Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Hg(II) modulated by the counter cations. A template agent (free ligand) can be said to contain the required structure to organize a collection of building blocks so that they can be linked together in a specific manner.16 The identities of ligands and complexes were established by 1H NMR, UV-vis and FT-IR spectroscopy, and satisfactory elemental analysis data. The crude products of the ligands were recrystallized from n-hexane to give a pale yellow solid (L1), a yellow solid (L2) and a brown-yellow oil (L3), respectively. X-ray-quality crystals of Zn1, Zn3, Cd1–Cd3, Hg1 and Hg3 were obtained by slow evaporation from methanol solution; Zn2 and Hg2 were obtained by slow evaporation from methanol/dichloromethane solution. The yields of ligands and complexes were within the range 77–89% and 45–78%, respectively. We confirm that all the complexes are stable in the solid state upon extended exposure to air. All ligands have good solubility in common organic solvents and the complexes are slightly soluble in very low polarity solvents, such as n-hexane, benzene and toluene, soluble in proton solvent and high polarity solvents, such as DMF and DMSO.
 Scheme 1  The synthetic procedure for ligands L1–L3. 
The FT-IR spectra of ligands (L1–L3) and complexes (Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3) are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3). In the FT-IR spectra, the characteristic in-plane and out-of-plane deformation bands of the 2-substituted pyridine rings shift to higher frequencies [ca. 30 cm−1δ(Py) and 20 cm−1γ(Py)] in comparison with similar free ligands.17 Several bands in the range 2800–3000 cm−1 are assigned to the pyridine νC–H stretching vibration. The appearance of a band in the region of 1620–1647 cm−1, assigned to νCN, is slightly red-shifted by the range of 3–12 cm−1 relative to that of the free Schiff-base ligand (1628–1647 cm−1) upon coordination of the metal ions,18 suggesting that coordination through the Schiff-base nitrogen atoms weakens the CN double bonds. Extensive studies19 have shown that the s character of the nitrogen lone pair in the –N bond increases upon coordination, producing a shorter CN bond length and a greater –N stretching force constant (higher frequency of vibration). For all of the ligands and complexes, three medium to strong peaks observed in the range 1570–1454 cm−1 are likely to be associated with the pyridine rings. The νC–O stretching vibration is observed in the range of 1222–1297 cm−1. A medium to weak metal-sensitive stretching band in the 416–411 cm−1 range for all complexes can be assigned to the ν(M–N) vibration. These phenomena confirm the coordinative interaction between the nitrogen atoms and metal cations.
The 1H NMR spectra of ligands and complexes were recorded in CDCl3 solutions to probe the solution structure (see the ESI,† Fig. S4–S6). The three protons on pyridine rings do not exhibit spin structure and display low-field signals compared to phenyl protons, which appear as a broad signal at ca. δ = 6.81–8.16. Furthermore, a common trend in the position of these signals is that, as all complexes were formed by the imine–N and pyridine–N, they display a 0.01–0.75 ppm shift. This behavior causes a characteristic change of the sequence of chemical shift positions of the pyridine proton resonances compared to that in the free ligands. The 1H NMR spectra of the complexes (8.18–8.83 ppm) show that the resonances of the imine –CHN– moiety protons shift toward low field compared to those of the corresponding ligands (8.18–8.50 ppm), indicating the formation of the coordination bonds between the ligand and the M(II) center.20 For ligands and corresponding complexes, the obvious strong signal at ca. 3.99–4.27 ppm is assigned to the –OCH3 group protons of pyridine rings. Especially for L1 and the corresponding complexes (Zn1, Cd1 and Hg1), the appearance of protons of the –CH– group as a solitary signal unambiguously testifies that the ligands and complexes are magnetically equivalent. The multiplet at the higher field in the range of 2.95–3.13 ppm is assigned to the –CH– group protons. For the corresponding complexes of L1–L3, differing only in the species of the methyl substituents on the phenyl ring, the methyl resonance is observed in the region 1.08–1.18, 2.02–2.42 and 3.85–4.15 ppm, respectively.
In order to confirm the phase purity of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out on the nine complexes (Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3) (See the ESI,† Fig. S7). Although the experimental patterns have a few unindexed diffraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single crystal models, it can still be concluded that the bulk synthesized materials and the as-grown crystals are homogeneous for all complexes. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the crystalline powder samples.21
3.2. X-ray crystal structures
The eventual goal here was to investigate the possibility that the ultimate crystal morphology could be influenced by the metallic unit at the very beginning of the crystal growth process. In order to investigate the effect of different metal ions on the crystal structures, the metal salts with the different metal cations and the same anions, namely, ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2, were used. Moreover, the ligands L1, L2 and L3 were employed in order to study the influence of different electron-donating substituents of the aniline on the construction of structures. Crystal data and experimental details for the crystals are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Tables S1–S3.† In zinc and mercury complexes, Zn(II) and Hg(II) formed tetrahedral complexes, while Cd(II) tended to form square pyramidal complexes, which can be observed from the crystal structures of Cd1 and Cd3. In the nine complexes, the structure of the ligand plays an important role in the construction of the complexes. The dihedral angles between the pyridine ring and phenyl ring in the complexes of L1, L2 and L3 are in the range of 79.58(1)°–79.92(1)°, 7.65(2)°–11.12(2)° and 10.53(1)°–15.23(2)°, respectively (see the ESI,† Table S4). The –OCH3 group in the pyridine ring does not coordinate to the metal center in these complexes because of the stereospecific blockade. However, it can serve as the donor of hydrogen bonds and still play important roles in the formation of supramolecular structures through C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, in these complexes, there are more chances to form C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds (see the ESI,† Table S5) and π⋯π stacking interactions (see the ESI,† Table S6) between the ligands, which play significant roles in constructing the three-dimensional structures. All complexes are air stable and can retain their structural integrity at room temperature for a few months.

Structure of [ML1Cl2] (M = Zn, Zn1; Hg, Hg1). 
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed on two dichloride complexes of ligand L1. The complex Hg1 is isostructural to Zn1 and the structure of Hg1 is shown in Fig. S8, ESI.† Herein, only the structure of Zn1 will be discussed in detail. Complex Zn1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. As shown in Fig. 1a, the zinc atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by two chlorine atoms and two nitrogen atoms derived from the chelating ligand L1. It is noteworthy that it gives rise to a five-membered ring after coordination, which is inherently coplanar with the pyridine ring and indirectly results in the extended conjugate. The mononuclear structure is indeed caused by the distorted dihedral angle between the pyridine ring and the phenyl ring. The dihedral angles between the pyridine ring and phenyl ring in the complexes Zn1 (79.73(8)°) (Fig. 1b) and Hg1 (79.92(1)°) are approximately perpendicular. The formal double-bond character of the imino linkage N2–C6 [CN distance is 1.269 Å] is compatible with the values of the previously published zinc complexes. The bond lengths of Zn–N1 (pyridine) and Zn–N2 (imine) are 2.069 and 2.112 Å, respectively, which is similar to the results from the literature reported previously.22

(c) The one-dimensional chain of complex Zn1 formed by C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds. Dotted lines represent the weak interactions. (d) View of the π⋯π stacking interactions in complex Zn1. 
Furthermore, the H⋯Cl distance (2.896 Å) between the CH and the chlorine atoms from neighboring molecules is shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii for H and Cl (ca. 1.2 Å for H, 1.75 Å for Cl),23 and the C–H⋯Cl angle is 168.58°, which indicates a typical intermolecular hydrogen bond. By linkage of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, a one-dimensional chain structure is formed (Fig. 1c). In addition, π⋯π stacking interactions with centroid⋯centroid distances of 3.508 and 3.696 Å (Fig. 1d), respectively, provide further stability to the structure.


Structure of [CdL1Cl2]2 (Cd1). 
Complex Cd1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. The X-ray single-crystal structure of Cd1, shown in Fig. 2a, consists of half of the neutral dimer molecule, with the other half obtained by a centre of inversion. The dimer moiety contains two Cd(II) atoms (Cd1 and Cd1A), which are asymmetrically bridged by two chloride anions (Cl1 and Cl1A), while the molecule of the bidentate L1 ligand is N-coordinated to each cadmium atom. The separation of intramolecular Cd1⋯Cd1A is 3.779 Å. In the structure of complex Cd1, the coordination geometry around the cadmium atom is described as distorted square pyramidal (τ = 0.244) [τ = (β − α)/60°, where α and β are the two largest angles in the coordination environment; τ = 0 for a perfect square pyramid; τ = 1 for an ideal trigonal bipyramid].24 This is achieved by the basal coordination positions held by two atoms (N1 and N2) from the ligand L1 and two chlorine atoms (Cl1 and Cl1A) and the apical sites occupied by one chlorine atom (Cl2) (Fig. 2b). The bond angles around the Cd1 and Cd1A ions are in the range of 69.93(10)°–153.03(8)° and 69.89(10)°–157.02(8)°, respectively. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table S2, ESI.† Likewise, the dihedral angle between the pyridine ring and phenyl ring in the complex Cd1 (79.58(1)°) is approximately perpendicular, due to the big steric hindrance of the 2,6–iPr2 substituent.

In the molecular packing structure of Cd1, C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds based on the chlorine atom and CH of the ligand are found, and the H⋯Cl distances and the C–H⋯Cl angles are in the range of 2.730–2.915 Å and 121.77(1)°–152.29(2)° (Table S5, ESI†), respectively. Meanwhile, the π⋯π stacking interactions with centroid⋯centroid distances of 3.882 Å exist in the pyridine and pyridine ring. As shown in Fig. 3a, the neighboring dimer molecules are linked by intermolecular C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds to form a one-dimensional structure along the b axis. In the bc plane, the molecules are also interconnected by C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds to aggregate in a two-dimensional net (Fig. 3b). The two-dimensional nets further extend into three-dimensional supramolecular structures, as shown in Fig. 3c. In the structures of the complexes Zn1, Cd1 and Hg1, the distances of M–N (imino) are relatively shorter than M–N (pyridine). The average distances of the M–N bonds are 2.091 Å (Zn1), 2.371 Å (Cd1) and 2.422 Å (Hg1), which is consistent with ionic radii. The bond angles of N–M–N are 78.89(8)° (Zn1), 69.93(10)° (Cd1) and 69.00 (12)° (Hg1).

Structure of [ML2Cl2] (M = Zn, Zn2; Cd, Cd2; Hg, Hg2). 
The complexes Cd2 and Hg2 are isostructural to Zn2, and their structures are shown in Fig. S9 and S10, ESI.† Thus, only the structure description of Zn2 is given in detail here as a representative example. Complex Zn2 belongs to the triclinic system, space group P. As shown in Fig. 4a, each Zn(II) center is four-coordinated, with a typically tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 4b). Each Zn(II) center is bi-dentately chelated by L2via two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2), and the remaining sites are occupied by two chlorine atoms (Cl1 and Cl2). The dihedral angles between the pyridine ring and the phenyl ring are 11.12(2)° (Zn2), 9.91(9)° (Cd2) and 7.65(2)° (Hg2), which is approximately parallel compared with the complexes of the ligand L1. Likewise, the distances of M–N (imino) are relatively shorter than M–N (pyridine). The average distances of the M–N bonds are 2.079 Å (Zn2), 2.288 Å (Cd2) and 2.335 Å (Hg2), which is consistent with ionic radii. The N–M–N bond angles fall in the range of 71.60(3)°–80.40(2)°, which is much smaller than the ideal bond angle of an sp3 hybrid orbital (109.28°). The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table S1, ESI.†

(c) The stack view of a two-dimensional structure generated by the C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds in Zn2 along the [001] direction. (d) View of the π⋯π stacking interactions in Zn2. 
As shown in Fig. 4c, the chlorine atom of the ZnCl2 is not playing a bridging role, but it does play an important role in the formation of higher dimensional structures through C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds. The distances of H12A⋯Cl1, H6A⋯Cl2 and H14B⋯Cl2 are 2.858, 2.790 and 2.841 Å, respectively. The bond angles of C12–H12A⋯Cl1, C6–H6A⋯Cl2 and C14–H14B⋯Cl2 are 164.60°, 149.06° and 166.08°, respectively. These indicate typical intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the neighboring molecules. In addition, there are weak π⋯π stacking interactions between the pyridine ring and the phenyl ring (the distance is 3.565 Å) in the crystal lattices of Zn2 (Fig. 4d). By linkage of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions, a three-dimensional supramolecular structure is formed.


Structure of [ML3Cl2] (M = Zn, Zn3; Hg, Hg3). 
The structures of Zn3 and Hg3 are isostructural to each other, and thus only Zn3 is described here representatively. The structure of Hg3 is shown in Fig. S11, ESI.† X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that Zn3, possessing a mononuclear structure, is a neutral complex crystallizing in a monoclinic system, space group P21/c (Fig. 5a). The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn(II) atom, one L3 ligand and two chlorine ions. Each Zn(II) atom is located in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, provided by two nitrogens (Npyridine and Nimine) and two chlorines. Moreover, it participates in a new five-membered ring, co-planar with the pyridine ring. The average distances of the M–N bond are 2.156 Å (Zn3) and 2.408 Å (Hg3), which is consistent with ionic radii. The bond angles of N–M–N are 78.60(2)° (Zn3) and 69.36(18)° (Hg3). The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table S1, ESI.† The parameters of bond length and angle are close to the values of related Zn(II)/Hg(II) complexes. Likewise, the dihedral angles between the pyridine ring and phenyl ring in the complexes Zn3 (15.23(2)°) and Hg3 (12.22(1)°) are approximately parallel, due to the small steric hindrance of the 2–OCH3 substitute. In complex Zn3, ligand L3 utilizes its two nitrogen atoms (Npyridine and Nimine) to ligate the Zn(II) atom. The mononuclear units are further linked by intermolecular C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds to form a supramolecular structure. The distances of H⋯Cl and the C–H⋯Cl angles are in the range of 2.884–2.943 Å and 115.81(4)°–150.39(5)° (Table S5, ESI†), respectively. Meanwhile, π⋯π stacking interactions with centroid⋯centroid distances of 3.706 Å exist in the pyridine and phenyl ring. As a result, by the linkage of such intermolecular hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions, a three-dimensional supramolecular structure is formed (Fig. 5b).

Structure of [CdL3Cl2] (Cd3). 
For Cd3, the X-ray single-crystal structure, shown in Fig. 6a, consists of one L3 ligand and two coordinated chlorine ions. The coordination geometry around the cadmium atom is five-coordinated in a distorted square pyramid (Fig. 6b), with the value of τ being 0.122. One oxygen atom (O2) and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from L3 and one chlorine atom (Cl1) are ligated to the Cd(II) center in the equatorial plane, with another chlorine atom (Cl2) located in the axial position. The distance of the apical chlorine atom to the metal center is longer than that of the basal chlorine atom. The distances of Cd–N1, Cd–N2, Cd–O2 are 2.333, 2.344 and 2.517 Å, respectively, which is in agreement with the values of similar Cd(II) complexes. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table S3, ESI.† In complexes Zn3, Cd3 and Hg3, Zn(II) and Hg(II) ions adopt a four-coordination mode, but Cd(II) ion shows a five-coordination mode. As previously mentioned, although the complexes Zn3, Cd3 and Hg3 use the same ligand, the results reveal that the ligand L3 can selectively chelate the Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) metal ions, which may be rationalized on the basis of the cooperative effect of the radius and the coordination preferences of the metal ions. Similar to complex Zn3, intermolecular C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds between the CH of the ligand and chlorine atoms are observed. The distances of H⋯Cl and the C–H⋯Cl angles are in the range of 2.775–2.934 Å and 116.34(3)°–152.42(3)° (Table S5, ESI†), respectively, which lie in the normal range as previously reported. Meanwhile, the π⋯π stacking interactions with centroid⋯centroid distances of 3.423 and 3.574 Å (Table S6, ESI†), respectively, provide further stability to the structure. Finally, a three-dimensional supramolecular structure is formed (Fig. 6c).

(b) Polyhedral representation of the coordination sphere of the Cd(II) center, with distorted square pyramidal arrangement in the complex Cd3. (c) The stack view of a two-dimensional structure generated by the C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds in Cd3 along the [001] direction. 
Nine complexes were prepared by the coordination of the ligands L1–L3 with the d10 metal ions Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II), and there are some similarities and differences in their structures. On the one hand, the persistent trend in the series of structures reported herein is the presence of chelating ortho-(6-methoxy-pyridyl)(CHNAr) ligands and the observation that the M–N(imino) bond length is consistently longer than the M–N(pyridine) bond length (Δ(M − N) = 0.04 to 0.14 Å, except for Cd3 where it is only 0.01 Å). In general, the above-mentioned Δ(M–N) values increase according to the order in the periodic table. Overall, the ligand molecule is planar, as seen in the dihedral angle of 7.65(29)°–79.92(13)° formed between the pyridine and phenyl ring planes, and the coordinated chlorine atoms are located above and below the plane. Across the series, the M–N–C bond angles follow the same trends, with the exo-chelate ring angles being wider than the endo-chelate ring angles (Table S1–S3, ESI†). On the other hand, the coordination number of the center metal reveals that the ligands can selectively chelate the Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) metal ions, which may be rationalized on the basis of the cooperative effect of the radius and the coordination preferences of the metal ions. Zn(II)/Hg(II) tend to form tetrahedral complexes, while Cd(II) tends to form square pyramidal complexes, which can be observed from the crystal structures of Cd1 and Cd3. In summary, the diverse complex structures were obtained owing to the structure and coordination site of the ligand, in combination with different metal atoms.

3.3. Photophysical properties

Table 2 summarizes the absorption data of the free ligands L1–L3 and the complexes Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 in acetonitrile solution at 298 K. The electronic absorption spectra of L1–L3 in acetonitrile show absorption in the range 300–353 nm, which is derived from the π–π* transitions, originating from the phenyl and pyridine group (see the ESI,† Fig. S12). The absorption spectra of Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 are bathochromically shifted (300–385 nm) to those of the corresponding Schiff-base ligand L1–L3, for the metal-perturbed intraligand π–π* transition of the imine(pyridine) unit.25 The molar extinction coefficients of the complexes are in the range from 10219 to 54004 dm3 mol−1 cm−1. For the complexes of the same ligand, the absorption spectra show a blue shift with decreasing absorption intensity, according to the order in the periodic table (Zn > Cd > Hg). It is very interesting that the electron-donating ability of substituent groups (–OCH3 > –CH3 > –iPr) in aniline plays a crucial role in governing the absorption band energies. The energy trend is found to follow the order Zn1 > Zn2 > Zn3 (as well as Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3).

The photophysical properties of these complexes revealed a striking metal-ion (Zn, Cd, Hg), ligand (L1, L2, L3), state of aggregation (solution and the solid state) and temperature (298 K and 77 K) dependence. The emission energy of each ligand and complex is given in Table 2 and Table 3. In degassed acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution (1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1) at 298 K, the maximum emissions of Zn1–Zn3 are 406, 415 and 423 nm (408, 427 and 450 nm for Cd1–Cd3; 402, 418 and 430 nm for Hg1–Hg3). Each showed a bathochromic shift compared to that of the free ligand (400, 411 and 421 nm for L1–L3) and produced blue emission (Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates alight on the blue region.) (see Fig. 7). These luminescence emissions are all attributable to the ligand-centered π*–π transitions.26 A trend in maximum emission wavelength in the order Zn3 > Zn2 > Zn1 (as well as Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3) is observed, in accordance with the electron-donating ability of the substituent groups in aniline. At 77 K, the emissions are clearly red-shifted to the green region and the largest shift is 168 nm for complex Zn3 in CH3CN (CIE: 0.47, 0.51). The corresponding maximum emission bands of Zn1–Zn3 are observed at 494, 531 and 591 nm in CH3CN (489, 510 and 576 nm for Cd1–Cd3; 489, 529 and 545 nm for Hg1–Hg3) (Fig. 13, ESI†). We consider the red shift at low temperature most likely caused by the increased rigidity of the molecule and reduced the intermolecular interaction.27

The quantum yields of all ligands and complexes were determined in acetonitrile solution at 298 K (Table 2). It was found that the quantum yields of complexes are higher than those of the free ligands. In particular, the quantum yield of Zn3 (ΦF = 0.422) is 8.79-fold that of the L3 ligand (ΦF = 0.048). This is because the M(II) centers in complexes play a significant role in enhancing the ligand-centered π*–π fluorescent emission. The chelation of the ligand to the metal center could increase the rigidity of the ligand, and reduce the loss of energy by thermal vibrational decay. Meanwhile, luminescence quantum yields decrease according to the order in the periodic table (Zn > Cd > Hg) when the same ligand is attached. The lowest luminescence quantum yields of complexes Hg1–Hg3 can be attributed to the “heavy atom effect”.28 The sensitivity of the luminescence intensity toward Hg(II) ions made us interested in possible applications in luminescent sensors for Hg(II) ions. For complexes Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 (ΦF = 0.422, Zn3 > 0.197, Zn2 > 0.060, Zn1), the steric configuration and the electron donating nature determine the luminescence properties. Similarly, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 also possess the same regularity.
The emission spectra of M1–M3 (M = Zn, Cd and Hg) and L1–L3 in the solid state at 298 K are shown in Fig. 8. In the solid state, all complexes emit green luminescence at λmax = 509–543 nm when irradiated at 365 nm (Fig. 9). From the column charts of luminescence intensity (Fig. 10), we found that the luminescence emission intensity of the complexes decreases according to the order in the periodic table (Zn > Cd > Hg) accompanied by the electron-donating nature (–OCH3 > –CH3 > –iPr), which is consistent with the regular pattern in CH3CN solution. The zinc complexes show bright green luminescence and the difference in the intensity of the emission results from the variation of the coordinated central metals to L1–L3 ligands and indicates that the central metals strongly affect the luminescence emission features. In the solid state at 298 K, the maxima of the emission peaks for the nine complexes are red-shifted ∼100 nm compared with those in solutions of acetonitrile, which may be due to the formation of C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions in the solid state, which can effectively decrease the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and influence the ligand-centered π*–π transitions.29 Meanwhile, we investigated the solid-state emission spectra of ligands and complexes at 77 K, and the details of the emission spectra are shown in Table 3. The complexes emit intensely at the range of 488–557 nm, giving light with CIE coordinates of 0.23–0.39, 0.31–0.59, which are in the green light region. Compared with those at 298 K, the luminescence emission intensities of the complexes show the same change trend (Fig. 14, ESI†).

 Fig. 10  Luminescence intensity of complexes Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 in the solid state under the same measurement conditions (λex = 365 nm, slit width: 1 nm, 1 nm). 
As mentioned above, in the complexes M1–M3 (M = Zn, Cd and Hg), the zinc complexes show the greatest emission intensity and luminescence quantum yields, both in the solid state and in solution. This indicates that the central metal and the structure of the ligand affect the luminescence properties. Then, in order to investigate the influence of the external environment on the luminescence properties, we chose complex Zn3 as an example to provide some luminescence measurements in acetonitrile solution at different temperatures (from 298 K to 343 K). The thermal quenching of luminescence is an important technological parameter for materials because it has considerable influence on the light output.30 The temperature-dependent luminescent properties of Zn3 excited at 375 nm are presented in Fig. 11. With an increase in the temperature, the maximum emission wavelength remains basically unchanged and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the emission band increases from 57.5 to 59.9 nm. Curves A and B in the inset of Fig. 11 represent the temperature dependence of the integrated emission intensity and the emission peak height normalized with respect to the values at room temperature (298 K), respectively. When the temperature increases to 343 K, the normalized integrated emission intensity and emission peak height are found to be 75% and 73% of the values at 298 K, respectively. These phenomena can be explained by the interaction between the electron and thermally active phonon. The excited luminescent center is thermally activated through phonon interaction, and then thermally released through the crossing point between the excited state and the ground state. This probability of non-radiative transition by thermal activation leads to the decrease of emission intensity, which is strongly dependent on temperature. The thermally activated luminescent centers interact strongly with thermally active phonons. At higher temperature, the population density of phonon is increased, and the electron–phonon interaction is dominant. Consequently, FWHM of emission spectrum is broadened.31
 Fig. 11  The acetonitrile solution emission spectra of Zn3 at different temperatures from 298 K to 343 K under excitation at 375 nm; inset shows temperature dependence of the integrated emission intensity (curve A) and the emission peak height (curve B) of Zn3. 
Hence, we discovered that the luminescence emission intensities and wavelengths of coordination complexes with d10 metal centers can be easily tuned by each of the following factors: central metal, state of aggregation, solvent, and temperature. The results lead to the conclusion that subtle changes in the structure of the ligand and the central metal give rise to significant differences in the structure of their coordination complexes, which will generate dramatic changes in their functional properties.
The luminescence decay profiles of ligands L1–L3 and complexes Zn1–Zn3, Cd1–Cd3 and Hg1–Hg3 were measured at their optimal excitation wavelengths in the solid state and in acetonitrile solution at 298 K and 77 K. The detailed data are listed in Table S7 and S8, ESI.† A general trend is that the luminescence lifetimes for M(II) (M = Zn, Cd and Hg) complexes either in the solid state or acetonitrile solution at 298 K and 77 K are mostly longer than those of the corresponding ligands L1–L3. The most obvious observation is that the lifetime of Zn3 (τ = 13.33 μs) is 2.55-fold that of the corresponding ligand L3 (τ = 5.22 μs) in acetonitrile solution. This is attributed to the more stable structure and interaction upon coordination.32 Meanwhile, the luminescence lifetimes of the ligand and corresponding complexes in the solid state are longer than those in acetonitrile solution, which can be ascribed to the less polar nature of the environment in solid state.33 The luminescence lifetimes of complexes Hg1–Hg3 (8.82–14.95 μs at 298 K; 6.39–9.45 μs at 77 K) are shorter than those of Zn1–Zn3 (11.41–19.82 μs at 298 K; 7.62–14.27 μs at 77 K) and Cd1–Cd3 (10.79–15.37 μs at 298 K; 6.53–10.75 μs at 77 K), which may be a result of the heavy-atom effect of the Hg(II) ion.34 Luminescence lifetimes for ligands and complexes at 298 K are mostly longer than those at 77 K, as shown in Tables S7 and S8, ESI.† This phenomenon can be attributed to the quenching of the center metal cation at a lower temperature. It should be pointed out that the lifetime of Zn3 (τ = 19.82 μs) is longer than that of other complexes.
3.4. Application in DSSCs
The complexes Zn1–Zn3 have the highest luminescence quantum yields, compared to the other corresponding metal complexes. Meanwhile, the absorptions of Zn1–Zn3 are all in the region of 300–450 nm (Fig. S15, ESI†), which could compensate for that of N719 in the low-wavelength region of the visible spectrum. Besides the optical properties discussed above, energy-level matching is a crucial factor in selecting a sensitizer. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in a three-electrode cell and an electrochemistry workstation. The experimental data are summarized in Table 4. As estimated from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra, the excitation transition energies (E0–0) of Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 are 3.04, 3.01 and 2.94 eV, respectively. The HOMO values of Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 corresponding to their first redox potential are −5.18, −4.86 and −5.02 eV, respectively. The estimated excited-state potentials corresponding to the LUMO levels of Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3, calculated from EHOMO + E0–0, are −2.14, −1.85 and −2.08 eV, respectively.35 For better electron injection, this LUMO level should lie above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.40 eV vs. vacuum) and for effective dye regeneration, the HOMO energy level should lie below the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum), which is further improved negatively by about 0.3 V by adding additives such as 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) to the I−/I3− redox electrolyte.36 This gives sufficient driving force for dye regeneration.37 It shows that the energy levels of Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 are appropriate for DSSC systems containing TiO2 (Fig. 12). Thus the complexes Zn1–Zn3 were employed as co-sensitizers in photoanodes used to prepare ZnX/N719 co-sensitized DSSC devices.

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the DSSCs based on N719, Zn1/N719, Zn2/N719 and Zn3/N719 are shown in Fig. 13 and the corresponding cell performances are summarized in Table 4. The results show that, upon co-sensitization, the performances of all cells are improved. The values of Jsc, Voc and η are improved in the order of Zn3/N719 > Zn2/N719 > Zn1/N719 > N719, respectively. The individually N719 sensitized device was found to exhibit a η value of 5.11% (with Jsc = 11.19 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V and FF = 0.65), while the co-sensitized solar cell devices Zn1/N719, Zn2/N719 and Zn3/N719 showed η values of 5.63% (with Jsc = 13.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.69 V and FF = 0.58), 6.35% (with Jsc = 14.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.71 V and FF = 0.60), and 6.94% (with Jsc = 16.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V and FF = 0.58), respectively (Table 5). All the parameters are significantly higher than the value for DSSCs sensitized by N719 alone.

EIS is a powerful technique for the analysis of interfacial electronic and ionic transport processes in an electrochemical device.38 It is a steady-state method to measure current response based on application of an AC voltage at different frequencies. Herein, we utilized EIS to analyze charge carrier dynamics in the interfacial regions of solid–liquid layers. The Nyquist plots of EIS for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes were measured under standard global AM1.5 solar irradiation, applying a forward bias of −0.75 V. The three semicircles located in the high-, middle- and low-frequency regions (left to right) are attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt–electrolyte interface, the charge transfer at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface and a Warburg diffusion process of the I−/I3− in the electrolyte.39 Under light illumination, EIS was utilized to analyze the charge transport resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface for its significance on the efficiency of DSSCs.40 As shown in Fig. 14, the radii of the large semicircle located in middle-frequency regions in the Nyquist plot decrease after being co-sensitized with zinc complexes, and the values are in the order of Zn3/N719 < Zn2/N719 < Zn1/N719 < N719, which indicates a decrease of the electron transfer impedance (Rct) and an increase of charge transfer rate at this interface after co-sensitization. This is of benefit for the enhancement of DSSC performance.

Dark-current measurement of DSSCs has been considered as a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the back electron transfer.41 A comparison of dark current between the investigated cells can provide useful information regarding the back electron transfer process. Fig. 15 shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes with the applied bias from 0 to +0.80 V. The onset of the dark current for individual N719-sensitized DSSC occurs at a bias of about +0.30 V, with a subsequent dramatic increase of dark current with the increase of potential. In contrast, for the co-sensitized DSSCs, the onset potential shifted to about +0.45 V; furthermore, the dark current of the co-sensitized DSSCs increased much more slowly than that of N719-sensitized DSSC when the potential was greater than +0.45 V. In other words, under the same potential bias, when the potential was ≥0.45 V, the dark current for the co-sensitized DSSCs was noticeably smaller than that for the N719-sensitized DSSC. The increase of the onset potential and the reduction of the dark current demonstrated that Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 successfully suppress the electron back reaction with I3− in the electrolyte. This is critical to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs.

When the molecular structures of Zn1–Zn3 are taken into account, it is found that introduction of the electron-donating substituent group in aniline also has some effect on the performance of DSSCs. The enhancement of co-sensitized DSSC performance compared with that of single N719 sensitized DSSC is in the order of Zn3/N719 > Zn2/N719 > Zn1/N719 > N719. This indicates that the η values increase according to the electron-donating ability of substituent groups (–OCH3 > –CH3 > –iPr) in aniline. For the introduction of the –OCH3 substituent, the absorption shows a red shift and the largest molar extinction coefficient (Table 4). The longer wavelength shift is better for compensating the absorption of N719 and overcoming the competitive light absorption of I3−. Moreover, the dihedral angle between the pyridine ring and the phenyl ring is 15.23(2)° (Zn3), which is approximately parallel. The good co-planarity is better for electronic energy transfer. Therefore, the performance of co-sensitized cell is in the order of Zn3/N719 > Zn2/N719 > Zn1/N719 > N719.
4. Conclusions
In summary, nine new transition metal (M = Zn, Cd and Hg) complexes with ortho-(6-methoxy-pyridyl)(CHNAr) ligands were synthesized and characterized and their luminescent properties were studied. Crystal structure analysis reveals that M(II) (M = Zn, Cd and Hg) complexes adopt distorted tetrahedral geometry (except for Cd1 and Cd3, which display distorted square pyramidal geometry) and have C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions in the solid state. The series of complexes exhibit tunable luminescence from blue, through green to light yellow on varying the temperature (298 K and 77 K) in the solution and in the solid state. Among the nine transition metal complexes, the complexes Zn1–Zn3 exhibit the brightest luminescence. The luminescence emission intensities of coordination complexes with d10 metal centers can be easily tuned by the center metal or the structure of the ligand. Subtle changes in the structure of the ligand or the center metal give rise to significant differences in the structure of their coordination complexes, which will generate dramatic changes in their functional properties. The complexes Zn1–Zn3 were employed as co-sensitizer in photoanodes to assemble with counter electrodes and electrolyte to prepare ZnX/N719 co-sensitized DSSC devices. The results show that, upon co-sensitization, the performances of cells are all improved. In particular, the Zn3/N719 device exhibited a higher Jsc of 16.59% mA cm−2, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.94%, which is ca. 36% higher than that of devices sensitized by single N719, indicating that these complexes possess wonderful potential in DSSC applications.
