    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 31st July 2018AbstractA novel wide-bandgap conjugated polymer (PTZP) based on alkylphenyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-P) as the electron-rich unit and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) as the electron-deficient unit was designed and synthesized for the non-fullerene polymer solar cell (PSCs) application. The polymer exhibited a wide bandgap of 2.01 eV with a strong absorption in the range of 300–620 nm, which was complementary with that of the fused-ring small molecule acceptor (SMA; 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile, IDIC). Also, the polymer exhibits a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.41 eV. Furthermore, the polymer film possesses strong crystallinity and dominated face-on stacking with a small d-spacing of 3.65 Å, resulting in a high hole mobility of 4.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The optimal PSCs based on the PTZP:IDIC blend showed a high PCE of 11.8% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.3%. Moreover, the device with an active layer thickness of up to 200 nm or area of up to 0.81 cm2 exhibited outstanding performance, with PCE of over 10%, resulting from the excellent molecular stacking. These results revealed that PTZP will be a promising conjugated polymer for the fabrication of efficient large-area PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their solution processability, ease of fabrication, promising flexibility, and low-cost production.1–10 State-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 13% for single-junction PSCs by using a wide-bandgap polymer as the donor material and non-fullerene (NF) small molecules as the acceptor material.11 Compared with fullerene derivatives, NF acceptors have particular advantages, such as the wide and efficient absorption within 600–800 nm, more finely tuned energy levels and facile synthesis.12 Since Zhan et al. reported the novel electron acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC),13 numerous highly efficient NF acceptors, such as IDIC,14 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((5,5′-(4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno-[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))-bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEIC),15 and NFBDT,16 have been synthesized and the PCEs of over 12% have been achieved.17,18 In order to widen the range of light absorption of the active layer blend film to further improve the efficiency of NF PSCs, it is also necessary to develop new wide-bandgap (WBG) polymer donor materials possessing good complementary absorption and matched energy levels with the low-bandgap small molecule acceptors.19–28
Among various WBG polymers, thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) based polymers exhibit excellent performance due to the rigid and planar structure and the weak electron-withdrawing nature of the TTz unit.29 In our previous study, we synthesized a WBG conjugated polymer (named PTZ1) based on TTz as the acceptor unit. By using IDIC as the acceptor material, a high PCE of 11.5% was obtained,6 which indicated that the TTz unit has a huge potential for high photovoltaic performance NF PSCs. However, the TTz-based polymer is seldomly applied to NF systems until now. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is one of the most successful electron-rich donor units as its inherent structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system enhance the electron delocalization and improve the charge mobility.30–38 Since Yang et al. and Hou et al. introduced 2,4-dioctylthienyl substituents onto the BDT unit and constructed the first polymer based on the 2D-conjugated BDT units,39 various conjugated side groups, including alkylthienyl,40–43 alkylphenyl,44–47 and alkylfuran48–51 have been introduced onto the BDT units. Among them, alkylphenyl substituted BDT (BDT-P) units exhibited superiority, with advantages such as deep HOMO level and high hole mobility. Hence, the polymers based on TTz and BDT-P show great potential in NF-based polymer solar cell application.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel conjugated polymer (PTZP) based on alkylphenyl-substituted BDT (BDTP) as the electron-rich unit and TTz as the electron-deficient unit (Fig. 1a). The optical, electrochemical, hole mobility, and photovoltaic properties were investigated. By combining BDTP and TTz, the polymer exhibited a strong absorption spectrum in the visible region (300–620 nm) with a bandgap of 2.01 eV, a deep HOMO energy level of −5.41 eV and an extraordinarily high hole mobility of 4.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S4 in the ESI†). By using PTZP as the donor material and IDIC as the acceptor material, non-fullerene PSCs achieved a high PCE of 9.9% for the as-cast film. After the optimization by adding 0.75% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the PSCs gave a higher PCE of 11.8% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.3%. Fig. 1d lists the correlation of the high PCE with the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of the polymer obtained in this study and the other literature reports; the details and related literature information are shown in Table S1† and in references in the ESI,† respectively. Clearly, most of the wide-bandgap polymers are obtained with Eoptg < 1.9 eV, and only a few polymers show Eoptg > 2.0 eV while still exhibiting high photovoltaic performance.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route for PTZP is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Monomers BDTP44 and TTz52 were synthesized according to the methods reported in the previous literature. As shown in Fig. S1,† PTZP was synthesized via a typical Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. High temperature GPC analysis of PTZP afforded a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 31.33 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.69. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the decomposition temperature (Td) with 5% weight loss was 410 °C (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), indicating that PTZP has sufficiently good thermal stability for applications in PSCs.
UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer PTZP in CB solution at different temperatures and in a solid film are shown in Fig. 1a and S3.† In solution, the absorption intensity of the shoulder peak gradually decreases with the increase in temperature from 20 °C to 100 °C, which indicated that PTZP could form strong and stable intermolecular aggregations in low-temperature solutions.53 In thin film, PTZP showed an enhanced vibronic absorption peak and broader absorption in comparison to those observed in solution spectrum. The corresponding optical bandgap (Eoptg) deduced from its absorption edge was estimated to be 2.01 eV. Furthermore, the PTZP:IDIC blend films showed a good complementary absorption spectrum from 300 nm to 800 nm.
With the increase in PCE of PSCs, researchers are paying increasing attention to the device stability. Thus far, it is inevitable that the photostabilities of the polymers should be addressed due to their influence on the stability of the PSCs.54–57 To investigate the photostability of the polymer, we inspected the photostability of PTZP by exposing the polymer film with thickness of around 50 nm under AM 1.5 sunlight irradiation in air (Fig. S4a in ESI†). The maximal absorption peaks at around 538 and 584 nm for PTZP gradually decreased as the exposure times were prolonged. After 12 h of irradiation, PTZP maintained 88.5% of its initial light absorption at maximal absorption. In addition, the photostability of PTZP in film under the 365 nm UV light irradiation in air was also investigated (Fig. S4b†). It was shown that PTZP maintained 92.3% of its initial light absorption at maximal absorption after exposing to 12 h of irradiation. It could be found that PTZP exhibited excellent photostability in solid state.
The electrochemical properties of PTZP were obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test. As shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the onset oxidation potential (φox) of PTZP was 0.68 V. The CV curve was recorded versus the potential of a standard Ag/AgNO3 electrode, which was calibrated by the ferrocene-ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. Under exactly the same conditions, φ1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.07 V relative to the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. Assuming that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was 4.8 eV relative to the vacuum energy level, according to the equation HOMO = −e(φox + 4.73) (eV), the HOMO energy level of PTZP was determined to be −5.41 eV.58 The LUMO energy level was −3.40 eV as calculated from the HOMO energy level and Eoptg.
The photovoltaic properties of PTZP were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTZP:IDIC/PFN-Br/Al. The detailed optimization processes of the devices for D/A ratios are recorded in Fig. S6(a) and Table S2 in the ESI.† The different additive contents are shown in Fig. S6a and Table S3 in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on the PTZP:IDIC (1:1.5, w/w) processed with chlorobenzene (CB) as the solvent with or without 0.75% DIO are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The devices of the as-cast film showed a high PCE of 9.9% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 16.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.5%. Furthermore, after adding 0.75% DIO, the PCE was increased to 11.8% due to the further increase in Jsc from 16.4 mA cm−2 to 17.9 mA cm−2 and a sharp increase in FF from 65.5% to 73.3%, which was the highest PCE among the devices based on alkylphenyl-substituted BDT or TTz copolymer as the donor material.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of all the devices covered a broad photoresponse in the wavelength range of ca. 300–800 nm (Fig. 2b, ESI Fig. S6b and S7b†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the devices based on both as-cast and 0.75% DIO added blend films all showed high maximum EQE values of over 75%, indicating the efficient photon-harvesting and charge collection of PSCs. Compared with the devices based on the as-cast film, the EQE spectra showed a red-shift and a higher value from 300 nm to 570 nm and 730 nm to 800 nm for the devices after addition of 0.75% DIO, which could be attributed to the broader absorption spectrum of the 0.75% DIO added PTZP:IDIC blend film (ESI Fig. S8†); also, the higher EQE value matched well with the higher Jsc values. The integral Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves were quite consistent with the measured Jsc values within 5% error.
The charge generation and extraction of PSCs was investigated by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff).59 As shown in Fig. 3a, Jph reaches saturation (17.3 mA cm−2 and 18.5 mA cm−2 for the devices with the as-cast and 0.75% DIO added films, respectively) at Veff ≥ 2 V, suggesting that the electrodes extracted all of the photogenerated charge carriers. The Jph/Jsat values under short-circuit and maximum power points were 94% and 74% for the as-cast devices and 96% and 78% for the devices with 0.75% added DIO, respectively. The enhanced Jph/Jsat value indicated that the PSCs achieved more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiencies after the addition of 0.75% DIO, which was consistent with the higher Jsc value of the devices with 0.75% added DIO. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure PTZP film, IDIC film and PTZP:IDIC blend films with or without 0.75% DIO were recorded.60 As shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI,† the PTZP:IDIC blend films demonstrated more than 70% PL quenching in comparison to the PL spectra of pure PTZP or IDIC. Moreover, the device with 0.75% added DIO showed the highest PL quenching, exceeding 93% compared to that of the as-cast device. The high PL quenching values indicated that the devices possessed effective photo-induced charge transfers between PTZP and IDIC, which was consistent with the high Jsc values of the devices.

The light intensity dependence of Jsc and Voc was measured to study the charge transport and recombination behaviors in PTZP:IDIC based PSCs.61Fig. 3b exhibits the logarithmic plots of Jsc as a function of the light intensity, showing the power law dependence of Jsc ∝ PS (where P is the incident light intensity and S is an exponential constant).62 The S value close to 1 for the device suggests a weak bimolecular recombination in the device.63 The S values were determined to be 1.02 and 1.01 for the as-cast and 0.75% DIO doped devices, respectively. Clearly, the S values for both as-cast and 0.75% DIO added devices approached 1, indicating that the DIO treatment had a negligible impact on the bimolecular recombination process for this blend system. Fig. 3c shows the logarithmic plots of Jsc with the light intensity. The slope of Vocversus logP at 2kT/q indicates that the dominant recombination mechanism is monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination, while the slope close to 1kT/q suggests that only a bimolecular recombination takes place in PSCs (where q is the elementary charge, T is the temperature in Kelvin and k is the Boltzmann constant).64 As shown in Fig. 3c, after the treatment with 0.75% DIO (1.16kT/q), the devices showed smaller slopes in comparison to those of the as-cast devices (1.35kT/q), which indicates that upon the addition of 0.75% DIO, the devices had fewer trap-assisted and/or monomolecular recombination compared to those in as-cast devices.
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) has been utilized to investigate the microstructures of the neat and blend thin films.65,66 The two-dimensional GIXD patterns and the corresponding line-cuts for neat PTZP and blend films with or without additives are shown in Fig. 4. The PTZP pure film showed distinct lamellar peaks (100) in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.28 Å−1 (lamellar d-spacings of 22.36 Å), and a strong (100) and π–π stacking peak (010) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The OOP (010) peak was located at 1.72 Å−1 (lamellar d-spacings of 22.36 Å). The as-cast blend films produced an additional peak in the (010) π–π stacking peak position in both IP and OOP directions compared to PTZP pure films owing to the acceptor material IDIC. Upon the addition of 0.75% DIO, the number of diffraction peaks in both IP and OOP directions increased and the intensities were enhanced. These characteristics of increased crystal size and preferential face-on orientation led to improved charge transport in the devices with 0.75% added DIO. The coherence length (L100 and L010) was deduced from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of IP (100) and OOP (010) peaks using the Scherrer equation. The L100 and L010 values for the as-cast blend film were 91.61 nm and 28.70 nm, and the corresponding values for the 0.75% DIO doped blend film increased to 104.78 nm and 49.24 nm, respectively. These results indicated that the crystallinity of the PTZP was enhanced after the addition of 0.75% DIO and the more orderly structure is beneficial for the charge transport and collection.

To understand the influence of charge carrier mobility on photovoltaic properties, the hole mobilities of the PTZP pure film and PTZP:IDIC blend films, and the electron mobilities of the PTZP:IDIC blend films were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S10 and Table S4 in the ESI†).67 The PTZP pure film afforded a fairly high value of 4.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) for the as-cast devices were calculated to be 2.13 × 10−4/9.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. After the addition of 0.75% DIO, the devices exhibited higher and more balanced μh/μe of 4.51 × 10−4/3.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was in accordance with the higher Jsc and FF values of the devices with the 0.75% added DIO.
The phase separation and the average domain purity in PTZP:IDIC blend films have been studied by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS). A photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected to provide a highly enhanced material contrast. As shown in Fig. 5, the as-cast blend film showed no distinct phase separation. After the treatment with 0.75% DIO, the blend film exhibited multi-length scale morphology with a domain size of 92.10 nm; this appropriate phase separation could lead to effective exciton dissociation. Moreover, the domain purities for the as-cast and 0.75% DIO blend films were 86% and 100%, respectively. Purer domains could suppress the recombination and result in high-performance PSCs, which agrees with the photovoltaic data of the related devices.68
 Fig. 5  R-SoXS profiles for PTZP:IDIC blend films. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were carried out to investigate surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films. As shown in Fig. S11 in the ESI,† in AFM images, the as-cast blend film shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.32 nm. After the addition of 0.75% DIO, the blend film exhibited a slightly lower RMS value of 2.28 nm, which indicates that DIO could effectively reduce the surface roughness and optimize the blend morphology. According to TEM images, compared to the as-cast blend film, the blend film upon the addition of 0.75% DIO showed a more distinct microphase separation and fibrous features, which was in accordance with the result of the R-SoXS test. A better microphase separation is beneficial to the charge separation and transport and hence can result in higher Jsc and FF values.
The relationship between the PTZP:IDIC active layer thickness, active area and the photovoltaic performance has been investigated. The J–V curves and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. 6a, b and Table 2, and the EQE curves are shown in Fig. S12 in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 6a, when the thickness was increased from 70 nm to 200 nm, the Voc exhibited a subtle change from 0.91 V to 0.89 V, but the Jsc and FF values showed significant variations. On the contrary, when the thickness was increased from 75 nm to 100 nm, the Jsc value increased from 16.1 mA cm−2 to 17.9 mA cm−2 and the FF value decreased from 74.5% to 73.3%. When the thickness was continuously increased to 150 nm and 200 nm, the Jsc value remained at 17.7 mA cm−2, while the FF kept decreasing to 68.2% and 64.5%, respectively. It was observed that with the thickness varying from 70 nm to 200 nm, the PCE of PSCs was fixed at over 10.0%. Subsequently, PSCs with different active areas have been fabricated, as shown in Fig. 6b. When the active area was increased from 0.04 cm2 to 0.81 cm2, the Voc showed no distinct change, while the Jsc sharply decreased from 17.9 mA cm−2 to 15.9 mA cm−2. Interestingly, when the active area was changed from 0.04 cm2 to 0.20 cm2, the FF increased from 73.3% to 74.4%. With the further increase in active area to 0.81 cm2, the FF reduced, but the PCE remained as high as 10.2%. The small sensitivity to the variation in the active layer thickness and the active area suggested that the PTZP:IDIC based PSCs possessed a good application prospect.

The storage stability and the thermal tolerance of PSCs based on PTZP:IDIC with the active layer thickness of 100 nm and the active area of 0.04 nm2 have also been investigated. As shown in Fig. 6c, after over 2000 h of storage in the glove box, the PSCs could still give a high PCE of 10.3%. The heat storage stabilities of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 6d. After annealing at 80 °C for 30 h, the PCE decreased to 9.0%, and then remained steady when the annealing was continued. After annealing for 64 h, the devices still had a high PCE over 8.9%. The above results further suggested the possibility for the application of the PSCs based on PTZP:IDIC.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel wide-bandgap conjugated polymer (PTZP) was designed, synthesized and characterized. The polymer combining BDTP and TTz units showed a strong absorption from 300 to 620 nm and a wide-bandgap of 2.01 eV. Non-fullerene BHJ-PSCs were fabricated using PTZP as the electron donor material and IDIC as the electron acceptor material. A PCE of 9.9% was obtained from the as-cast devices with a high Voc of 0.92 V. After the addition of 0.75% DIO, the crystallinity of the blend film was enhanced, and the morphology of the blend film was optimized. Hence, the device showed a high PCE of 11.8% with a sharp increase in Jsc and FF values. Furthermore, by increasing the active layer thickness to 200 nm or by enlarging the device area to 0.81 cm2, the PSCs based on PTZP:IDIC all showed high PCEs of over 10%. The stability of PSCs was studied. After storing the devices in a glove box for 1500 h, the PCEs of the devices remained as high as 10.2%. After annealing at 80 °C for 64 h, the PCE was still over 8.0%. These results indicated that the combination of BDTP and TTz units was a successful molecular design strategy to obtain PSCs of high photovoltaic performance, and the PTZP:IDIC based devices have great practical application potential due to the superior PCE and stability.
