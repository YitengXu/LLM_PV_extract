    , Accepted 23rd October 2019First published on 23rd October 2019AbstractNovel binaphthylamine-based hole-transport molecules with different side-chains were designed and synthesized. The obtained materials exhibit comparable optoelectronic properties and molecular configuration, but distinct film properties. In this work, which was inspired by the structural feature of polymer and π–π stacking strategy of carbon nanotubes with large π-spacers, two kinds of optimized hole-transport molecules with amine and methyl units were attached to multi-walled carbon nanotubes by physisorption, and were further used to fabricate inverted perovskite solar cells. A non-encapsulated device based on a hole-transporting material with multi-walled carbon nanotubes gives a power conversion efficiency of 17.17%, comparable to that of the pristine hole-transport material (17.32%). More importantly, the former exhibits a higher device stability than the later. Introduction of carbon nanotubes to hole-transport materials provides a new method for improving the device stability of inverted perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
The inverted perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs) have been intensively explored with respect to realizing flexible and large-area photovoltaic devices.1–6 An essential prerequisite for efficient i-PSCs is the hole-transport layer (HTL) with superior uniformity and surface morphology, which affects the electrical contact on the two surfaces of electrode/HTL/perovskite as well as the quality of perovskite morphology.2,7 To date, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely utilized in i-PSCs, acting as a hole-transport material (HTM) due to its high hole mobility and solution processability. However, the acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS speed up the decomposition of perovskite layers and result in poor device stability.8–11 Thus, extensive research efforts have been undertaken to exploit efficient neutral and hydrophobic small organic HTMs together with easy synthesis. Chen et al.12 reported a planar, rigid and fully conjugated molecule, Trux-OMeTAD. The C3h symmetrical truxene-core afforded excellent hole mobility and desired surface energy, which enabled i-PSCs with Trux-OMeTAD to show a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.6%. Wang's group7 presented a π-conjugated small molecule, TAPC, and a stabilized PCE of 18.8% was achieved. Li and co-workers13 developed an x-shaped organic molecule, Si-OMeTPA, with silicon cores. This molecularly designed HTM exhibits high thermal stability, and excellent hole-mobility, which led to a champion PCE of 19.06%. Recently, Tsang et al.14 employed a coplanar D–π–D HTM, BDT-POZ, for high-performance i-PSCs with PCEs up to 19.16%. This molecule, endowed with phenoxazine (POZ) as donor units, presents efficient hole extraction and transport. The above studies indicate that small molecules have great potential to improve the performance of i-PSCs after conjugating with various electron donors.
With the impressive improvement in PCE, device stability has become an essential prerequisite for judging the effectiveness of hole-transport materials in PSCs. Note that during the functioning of the devices, HTMs are prone to undergo a thermal transition from amorphous to crystalline. The crystallization trend is averse to the morphological stability of films. The fabrication of amorphous films with high uniformity and morphological stability could result in the significant formation of high-quality perovskite polycrystalline films, which would further improve device stability. Ding et al.15 devised a fluorine-based HTM, named FMT, that showed a stable amorphous film during the heating and cooling process in the range of 25–160 °C. The fabricated i-PSCs yielded a high PCE of 19.06%. More importantly, the devices endowed with FMT kept good thermal stability at 60 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Guo’ group16 designed and synthesized a donor–acceptor-type molecule, MPA-BTTI, with a remarkably high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 256 °C. The excellent morphological properties of the underlying MPA-BTTI film led to a good long-term stability for the constructed i-PSCs. Recently, Li et al.17 reported a twisted V-shaped small molecule HTM, Spiro-I, which contributed to the formation of high-quality films. The PSCs fabricated with Spiro-I without encapsulation retained 80% of the initial PCE after 2400 h storage. This demonstrated that the curved dumbbell structure of Spiro-I can effectively inhibit the intermolecular π–π stacking and thus limit the tendency to crystallize.18–22 Binaphthylamine derivatives exhibit a reported C2-symmetric unit, and show a similar spriosindane core with Spiro-I.17,23 In comparison with other HTMs with high symmetry used in i-PSCs like spiro-OMeTAD derivative,24 Trux-OMeTAD derivative,12 triphenylamine-based HTMs,7,15 carbazole-based HTMs,2etc., the derivatives with a spriosindane core (C2) exhibit a lower symmetry, which helps to decrease the tendency to crystallize in favour of an improved stable amorphous film state.17
Very recently, π-conjugated polymers have drawn more attention due to their excellent solution processability, thin film uniformity, and mechanical flexibility. In addition, polymers also exhibit intrinsic good thermal stability compared to small molecules due to their large molecular structure. The devices fabricated with polymers show excellent solar cell stability.25–31 However, hole-transport polymers have the disadvantage of being difficult to synthesize, and having a low yield and an uncontrolled molecular weight. In this regard, it could be a promising strategy to combine the easy synthesis of small molecules with the excellent stability of polymer films.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have powerful properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, chemical stability, high aspect ratio, and nanocomposite components. Based on these advantages, major nanotechnology applications of CNTs in drug delivery systems, energy storage and microelectronics have been developed.32–34 Recently, large π-spacers, such as pyrene derivatives with functional groups, have been introduced onto the surface of the CNTs by noncovalent functionalization.35–37 In our work, inspired by this π–π stacking strategy, four kinds of novel binaphthylamine-based hole-transport molecules with different side-chains were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, the ready binaphthylamine-based molecules were attached to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to afford a mixed material (hereafter referred to as “HTM@MWCNTs”, for example: Z7@MWCNTs) by physisorption. The prepared HTMs@MWCNTs were used in the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells. Compared to pristine HTMs, i-PSCs based on HTMs@MWCNTs exhibited comparable PCEs and greater stability even after storing the non-encapsulated devices in ambient air for 14 days. These results provide a new idea and scheme for improving the stability of i-PSCs.

Results and discussion
The synthesis routes for Z7–10 are shown in Scheme S1, with details described in the ESI.† Computational density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to illustrate the geometry of Z7–10 with a Gaussian 09 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G level. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the dihedral angles between the adjacent naphthylamine units are 93°, 109°, 80° and 89° for Z7, Z8, Z9 and Z10, respectively. The large dihedral angles afford a similarly V-shaped twisted molecular structure for these four HTMs. However, Z7 and Z9 show a less symmetric structure than that of Z8 and Z10, which is beneficial for obtaining high-quality and stable amorphous HTM films.17 Thermal properties of the four novel HTMs were studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S2, ESI†). Z7–10 show an amorphous solid-state, with a glass transition temperature (Tg) over 100 °C. A high Tg can ensure the morphological stability of HTM films during the operation of the i-PSCs. HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the results of cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis absorption measurements (Fig. 2c and d), and the corresponding data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The optical band gap (E0–0) was calculated from the intersecting point of the normalized UV-vis absorption and emission curves (λint) as 3.11 eV, 3.05 eV, 3.00 eV, and 2.92 eV for Z7, Z8, Z9, and Z10, respectively. In addition, cyclic voltammetry was employed to determine the oxidation potential (Eox) of HTMs with Fc/Fc+ as an internal standard. The values of EHOMO that were calculated from the Eox are −5.29 eV for Z7, −5.35 eV for Z8, −5.29 eV for Z9 and −5.31 eV for Z10, respectively. In addition, ELUMO was determined by the equation E0–0 = ELUMO − EHOMO. As presented in Fig. 2b, the energy levels of Z7–10 match well with MAPbI3 and ITO. Although these four HTMs present a similar symmetric structure, Z7 shows a wider band gap with the highest LUMO energy level in favour of an effective blocking of electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the ITO conductive layer. The i-PSCs endowed with Z8 would display the biggest Voc due to its lowest HOMO energy level. And Z8 and Z10 present a narrower band gap arising from their more planar geometric structure than that of Z7 and Z9, respectively.

In addition to frontier energetics and thermal properties, surface wettability of the bottom HTM layer significantly affects the morphology of perovskite films. Recent research suggested that good quality perovskite polycrystalline films more easily formed on a relatively hydrophobic surface. In our primary report,22 we found that the coated PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic with a contact angle of 21.4° to a water droplet. In sharp contrast, Z7–10 are hydrophobic with a much larger water contact angle. As shown in Fig. 2a, Z7 and Z8 exhibit larger contact angles of 101° and 96°, respectively, compared to Z9 and Z10. The perovskite precursor contact angle was also tested on the surface of the HTM layer. Z7 and Z8 give smaller contact angles in addition to that of Z9 and Z10. This result implies that the introduction of hydrogen atoms or aliphatic chains in Z7 or Z8 could modulate the HTM surface energy compared to the rigid aromatic ring with large steric hindrance in Z9 and Z10, which is beneficial to forming a smoother and denser perovskite film on the surface of Z7 and Z8 films.12
Based on the above data, we fabricated i-PSCs with an n-i-p structure (Fig. 1b) to elucidate the structure–property correlations of Z7–10 molecules for hole-extraction. Fig. 2e plots the J–V curves of the champion i-PSCs based on different HTMs, and Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic properties of PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of 10 devices. Each parameter is summarized in Table 1. The optimized PCEs of the dopant-free Z7-/Z8-based i-PSCs are 17.32% and 15.80%. These values are much higher than those of Z9-/Z10-based devices. In addition, the narrow distributions of the photovoltaic parameters for Z7-/Z8-based i-PSCs indicated good reproducibility by using Z7-/Z8 to construct high performance i-PSCs. From the point of the molecular energy level that was calculated, Z8-based devices should present a higher Voc due to their deeper HOMO level. However, Z7 has a higher efficiency. As we know, Voc is related to two factors: energy level and charge recombination in inner solar cells. Charge recombination usually leads to a poor FF. The FF value is closely related to film quality of the perovskite layer.16,17,38,39 To probe the perovskite formation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed and the SEM images of perovskite films are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The perovskite film spin-coated on the surface of Z7 is smooth and dense. In sharp contrast, Z9 and Z10 result in coarse perovskite films covered with pinholes. This could be due to the poor wettability of the perovskite precursor on the surface of Z9 and Z10 films (Fig. 2a), which brings out poor repeatability of device preparation operations and further a large deviation of photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 3). Therefore, as well as the symmetric structure, the wettability of the perovskite precursor on the surface of a HTM is also a crucial factor for improving device photovoltaic performance.

As reported, pinholes in perovskite films could lead to violent charge combination, which could be explained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)22,40 (Fig. S5a, ESI†). In our work, the EIS measurement was carried out with a frequency from 2 MHz to 2 Hz under dark conditions. A positive deviation of 0.70 V was applied to i-PSCs during the measurement. The recombination resistance (Rrec) within the interface of the charge transport layer was obtained by fitting the lower frequency arc of EIS spectra according to a reported typical equivalent circuit model (Fig. S6, ESI†). The lower frequency arc can be attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec). The Rrec of Z7- and Z8-based i-PSCs is higher than that of Z9 and Z10, indicating a higher recombination of the latter. This result is well coincident with FF in the sequence of Z7 > Z8 > Z9 ≈ Z10. Besides, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S5b, ESI†) confirmed that Z7 and Z8 show a relatively low PL quenching value in addition to Z9 and Z10, affording a faster hole-extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface of the former. Due to the low recombination rates and more efficient interfacial hole-extraction, Z7- and Z8-based i-PSCs result in a better performance than Z9 and Z10.
The above results provide us an in-depth thinking: the rigid group of the terminal substituted group or conjugated system is not bigger, making it better, whereas the introduction of some unsubstituted amino, hydroxyl, or aromatic small groups enables easy construction of flexible small molecules, which is convenient for modulating the HTM energy level. We chose the binaphthylamine-based derivatives Z7 and Z8 (as their PCEs are over that of PEDOT:PSS) for further device stability tests of i-PSCs. In this portion, the MWCNTs used were purchased from XFNANO Co., Ltd. Fig. 5a presents the HR-TEM photomicrograph of pristine MWCNTs. The diameters of the pristine MWCNTs range from 10 nm to 16 nm, and the estimated average diameter of MWCNTs is 13 nm. The method used for preparing the mixture of HTMs and MWCNTs was conducted according to ref. 33. Pristine MWCNTs were dispersed in an N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution in a sonicator for 3 hour and stirred for 1 hour. Next, this suspension was used to dissolve HTMs to give a HTM solution with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1. The mass ratio of MWCNTs and HTM in the HTM@MWCNTs mixture is approximately 0.2%. The prepared solution of Z7, Z7@MWCNTs, and pristine MWCNTs in NMP is shown in the inset image of Fig. 4. Pristine Z7 presents a transparent solution, while the solution of pristine MWCNTs is black. After sonication of Z7 with MWCNTs, the samples exhibit good dispersion behaviour in NMP. The particle association of MWCNTs was attributed to the functionalized interconnection of CNT particles with binaphthylamine units in HTMs.33 To evaluate the device performance of MWCNTs doped in HTMs in i-PSCs, the prepared Z7@MWCNT solution was used to fabricate i-PSCs using the same procedure as with pristine HTMs. As shown in Fig. 2e and Table 1, the Z7@MWCNT device achieved a maximum PCE of 17.17% with a Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.052 V and a FF of 0.72, which is similar to that of pristine Z7. This result means there was no obvious influence of MWCNTs on device efficiency.

Finally, the device stability of i-PSCs based on pristine HTMs and HTM@MWCNTs without encapsulation was measured at 40–50% RH and room temperature under dark conditions. In our work, four devices from two patches were used to test stability. The best results are plotted in Fig. 5e and f. In addition, Z8 and Z8@MWCNTs were also investigated for i-PSC stability measurement. Here, we present data from two batches for comparison in Tables S2 and S3 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5e, the non-encapsulated Z7@MWCNT-based i-PSCs kept 62% of their initial PCE after 14 days, whereas the PCE of the pristine Z7-based device decreased remarkably with a low PCE of 4.02% after 14 days. The introduction of MWCNTs into HTMs improved device stability definitively. Note that the decreased trend of device efficiency agrees with that of FF and Jsc. During the first four days, the FF and Jsc of the device based on Z7 show a sharp decrease that leads to an obvious attenuation in efficiency. Whereas, the Z7@MWCNT-based cell presents a relatively stable FF and Jsc performance. FF and Jsc are related to the quality of the perovskite. A stable perovskite polycrystalline film is critically dependent on the HTM properties in i-PSCs. These results reveal that Z7@MWCNTs provides a relatively stable HTM film of high-quality, which decreases the formation of a low degree of defects in perovskite film during storage. In addition, a similar conclusion was obtained for Z8. As presented in Fig. 5f, the Z8@MWCNT device achieved enhanced stability.

What is the reason for the improved device stability? How does the addition of MWCNTs work? As we all know, Z7 and Z8 have rigid π-conjugated naphthylamine units. According to reports,32–35,37 there would be some noncovalent functionalization between these kinds of large π-spacers and CNTs after doping. And molecules with large π-conjugated units could be adsorbed onto the MWCNTs’ surface by physisorption. In our work, the MWCNTs are well dispersible in organic solutions of HTMs (the inset image of Fig. 4). After three days, as presented in Fig. S9 (ESI†), three are many black carbon tubes deposited in the bottle with pristine MWCNTs, whereas the solution with Z7@MWCNTs is relatively transparent. Obviously, the existence of Z7 prevents the deposition of MWCNTs in organic solution. This means that there could be some noncovalent functionalization between the binaphthylamine groups and the MWCNTs. After the ultrasonic dispersion of MWCNTs in HTM solution, the binaphthylamine units of HTM molecules may be adsorbed onto the MWCNTs’ surface. It looks like some small HTM molecules were locked in a sturdy chain, as shown in Fig. 4. In the optimized molecular structure (Fig. S1, ESI†), Z7–10 show a similar optimized structure with two side chains and the triphenylamine donors located on the opposite side. This kind of molecular arrangement favours the noncovalent functionalization with MWCNTs. Due to the intrinsic good thermal stability of MWCNTs, the HTM@MWCNTs gives an improved morphological stability in the amorphous film, and further enhanced device stability. The reason behind the increasing storage stability of i-PSCs found for HTM@MWCNTs needs further investigation. We deeply welcome more researchers to join our work and give more reasonable explanation.
The occurrence of noncovalent functionalization of HTMs with MWCNTs was confirmed by UV-vis, AFM and FT-IR analysis. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), Z7 and Z8 display broad UV-vis absorption after attachment to MWCNTs. Fig. 5(b and c) presents the 3D surface AFM images of Z7 films. Compared to the relatively smooth film formed by pristine Z7 (Fig. 5b), Z7@MWCNTs exhibits a film state with concave and convex fluctuations (Fig. 5c). The MWCNTs crisscross and are completely coated by the HTM film. The 2D AFM images (Fig. S8, ESI†) illustrated good organo-dispersible MWCNTs to achieve a dispersion with a cluster of MWCNTs or even 2–3 MWCNTs. Before the FT-TR measurement, the samples have to be prepared with details described in the ESI.† MWCNT suspension dissolved with HTMs was vacuum-filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane filter. The filter residue was dried at 80 °C for 24 hours in a vacuum oven to give the samples for FT-IR measurement. As shown in Fig. 5d, stretching peaks correspond to amino-groups (peaks at 3256–3500 cm−1) in the Z7 and Z7@MWCNTs. However, these peaks were not observed in the FT-IR spectra of the pristine MWCNT. The amino groups are the characteristic functional groups of the Z7 compound, and its appearance in Z7@MWCNT, to a certain extent, could explain the noncovalent functionalization between Z7 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. From the above results, we concluded that carbon materials, like MWCNTs, are potent candidates for commercial application to enhance the device stability.
Conclusion
In this work, a series of novel binaphthylamine-based HTMs was synthesized and characterized. Inspired by the structural feature of π-conjugated polymers, the selected small molecular HTMs were attached to multi-walled carbon nanotubes by physisorption, and further used in the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells. Z7 with MWCNTs gives a PCE of 17.17%, which is comparable to that of the pristine HTM (17.32%). More importantly, non-encapsulated i-PSCs based on molecules with MWCNTs exhibit a higher device stability than that of the pristine HTM. These results clearly indicate that the noncovalent functionalization of a HTM with multi-walled carbon nanotubes is a promising strategy for future low-cost, efficient, and stable i-PSC fabrication.
Experimental
Synthetic procedures of compounds Z7–10 are listed in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The chemical structure of the novel HTMs was determined by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. All the materials and solvents were purchased without further purification. Some characterizations of HTMs and i-PSCs are presented in the ESI.†
