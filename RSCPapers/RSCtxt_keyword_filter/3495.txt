1. Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly conjugated sp2 carbons connected throughout a system.1 PAHs have been used in different fields such as organic electronics, dye chemistry, nanomaterials, and solar cells.2–5 Due to their extensive applications, chemists have shown interest in constructing these scaffolds and to diversify their synthetic scope. Heteroatom bearing-PAHs normally possess more prominent electronic properties than their respective carbocyclic counterparts due to the participation of lone pair electrons. There are several synthetic methods available for the synthesis of heterocyclic frameworks. Among them, the Diels–Alder (DA) protocol has been proved to be one of the most effective methods for assembling heterocyclic compounds.6a,b The DA reaction is also among the most fundamental and essential tools for the construction of C–C bonds (in PAHs/hetero-PAHs) in an atom-economical manner. Notably, the DA methodology is potentially suitable to prepare highly branched phenylenes, as well as various annulated acenes/heteroacenes in a greater yield in comparison to other existing approaches.6c–g
Contingent on the electronic nature of the substrate, the DA reaction has been classified into two types, namely, normal DA and inverse electron demand Diels–Alder (IEDDA or DAINV) reactions. The DA reaction has a diene part that is electron-rich, and a dienophile part is electron-poor, but unlike the DA reaction, the IEDDA is a cycloaddition between an electron-rich dienophile and an electron-poor diene. Over the decades, the synthesis of the extensive variability of highly conjugated carbo-, and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (a PAH in which one or more of the skeletal carbon atoms have been replaced by a heteroatom), dendrimers, and polymers through DA reactions has been reported.7 Besides, in many natural product syntheses, the DA reactions have been effectively utilized as an elegant strategy for preparing crucial intermediates.8 Cyclopentadienones (CPDs) belong to the group of IEDDA dienes and have been frequently employed as a precursor to construct structurally complex PAHs.9
CPDs (versatile dienone) have been widely accessed by DA/nucleophilic-addition reactions for the production of carbo and also heterocycles. Initially, unsubstituted cyclopentadienone was utilized in the synthesis of carbonyl enclosed aromatic compounds as well as carbonyl bridged bicyclic compounds by the self-dimerization reaction.10 Cyclopentadienone is a unique substrate and has been consistently utilized as a diene in the IEDDA reaction for preparing annulated PAHs,11 and in some instances, tetraarylcyclopentadienone was used as an imperative precursor for making buckybowls.12 Furthermore, it has been used as a key step for the construction of some of the novel carbon allotropes such as nanographene, graphenes, graphene nanoribbons (GNR), and graphene-based nanomaterials.13 Müllen and co-workers have synthesized miscellaneous higher generation dendrimers, polymers and graphenes exploiting cyclopentadienones using the IEDDA protocol. Besides, Müllen et al. also published a number of review articles that focused explicitly on larger carbocyclic frameworks such as phenylene dendrimers, polymers, and nanographene.14 It is obvious that these existing review articles on IEDDA of CPDs are not focused on the synthesis of small carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Herein, we covered the synthesis of heterocyclic frameworks achieved during the last 50 years through the IEDDA of CPDs.
Moreover, in recent years, non-planar PAHs have been extensively synthesized rather than their planar cousins owing to their enhanced solubility, reduced energy band gap, and higher photo-physical and electrochemical properties. Indeed, non-planar PAHs displayed greater material applications than planar PAHs because of their inherent nature.15 Besides, hetero-atom doped non-planar (heterocyclic) PAHs have shown enormous material applications compared to their respective parent non-planar carbocyclics.16 As a result of all the curious features, currently, the synthesis of innovative non-planar hetero-atom bearing PAHs is a significant topic in materials as well as synthetic organic chemistry. In that aspect, the present review outlines different strategies involved in preparing heterocyclic frameworks exploiting the Diels–Alder reactions of CPDs. Besides, this review also describes the incorporation of heteroatoms in PAHs at completely different positions (via the IEDDA reaction) compared to the classical heterocyclic system. Moreover, this review article also elucidates the diversity of cyclopentadienone frameworks towards the synthesis of heterocycles through a multi-directional approach (Fig. 1).

2. Synthesis of N/P/O/S-doped alicyclic/bridged cyclic/aromatic compounds
2.1. The DA reaction of hetero-CPD
Hemming and co-workers17 have established a synthesis of highly branched pyridine derivatives 2a–g from azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-4-one analogs 1. Compound 1 has been obtained by the [3 + 2] cycloaddition of disubstituted cyclopropenones and 1-azetines. The tandem formation of 2a involves the [2 + 2]-cycloreversion reaction of azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-4-one 1 to styrene I and 3-azacyclopentadienones II, and subsequently the [4 + 2] Diels–Alder reaction between I & II to afford the desired poly-substituted arylpyridine derivatives 2a with excellent regioselectivity by extrusion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (Scheme 1). This protocol has been effectively applied to synthesize diverse aryl and alkyl-substituted pyridines 2b–g in moderate to good yields.

Diene and dienophilic reactivity of azacyclopentadienone derivatives IVa/b & V has been extensively studied by Gavina and co-workers.18 The parent carbo and azacyclopentadienones IVa/b and V, have been accessed from the corresponding polymeric resin attached pyrrolin-2-one derivatives (3a–d) by heating. The in situ generated cyclopentadienones IVa/b and V have been trapped using substituted furan 4a and acetylenes 4b to the corresponding Diels–Alder products 5a–5b, respectively (Scheme 2). The diversification of DA products to substituted indenone 6a, cyclic amide 6b/6e, benzene 6c, and pyridine 6d skeletons has been successfully shown. Interestingly, it was identified that both cyclopentadienone IVa and monoazacyclopentadienone IVb act as a diene as well as a dienophile. However, concerning the reaction conditions, due to the poor reactivity of diazacyclopentadienone V it acts only as a dienophile.

Sasaki et al. explained the role of substituents in the peri-selectivity of fulvene systems 8a/b with diazacyclopentadienone 7a.19 The reaction of hetero-cyclopentadienone 7a with 6,6-diphenylfulvene 8a in benzene at room temperature yielded cyclopenta[d]pyridazine 9 whereas, 6-dimethylaminofulvene 8b gave fulvene substituted 4H-pyrazol-4-one 10 (Scheme 3). This is because the LUMO of the diazacyclopentadienone 7a and HOMO of the 6,6-diphenyl fulvene 8a is symmetric and thus favors [4 + 2] cycloaddition (4π from heterodiene and 2π from fulvene) where, the substitution of the dimethylamino group in fulvene 8b increases the HOMO-diene value (higher dipole moment, 7.0 D) and follows the [6 + 4] cycloaddition or electrophilic substitution reaction.

Rainier and co-workers have reported20in situ generated 3-aminocyclopentadienone 7b as a diene or a dienophile under optimized reaction conditions for the production of a plethora of heterocyclic compounds 12a–h. 3-Aminocyclopentadienone 7b was obtained by ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN)-mediated oxidative decomplexation from the corresponding metal-complexes 11a, and the subsequent IEDDA reaction with methyl acrylate and DMAD to form indolenes 12a/b as the sole products. Occasionally, 3-aminocyclones 11a/b act as dienophiles upon treatment with cyclopentadiene and also α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds 13a–d to give chemo- and regio-selective hetero doped tricyclics 12c–h in reasonable yields (Scheme 4). Additionally, the tricyclic products 12d–h showed two heteroatoms (N & O), where the nitrogen atoms come from the cyclone part 11a/b and oxygen comes from unsaturated carbonyl compounds 13a–d.

2.2. The DA reaction of CPD with hetero-dienophiles
Eguchi and co-workers have studied the DA reactivity between homoadamantanocyclo pentadienones 14a/b with acetylenic, olefinic, and hetero-dienophilic 15 systems.21 The heterodienophile namely, 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) 15 upon treatment with homoadamantanocyclopentadienones 14a/b at room temperature afforded the respective Diels–Alder adducts 16a/b in good yields (Scheme 5). Indeed, the ester group (R1 = CO2Me) present in the diene part failed to yield the desired product even after a prolonged reaction time, owing to the dipole–dipole repulsion between methoxycarbonyl in the diene and the dione fragment of PTAD.

Märkl et al. reported the cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadienones 14c/d with benzylidynephosphane(2-phenylphosphaethyne) 17b as a dienophile to form 2,3,4,5,6-pentasubstituted phosphine derivatives 18a/b.22 Thus, the heating of p-chloro(α-trimethylsilylbenzylidene) phosphane 17a at 220 °C in the presence of KF leads to benzylidynephosphane 17b with the removal of chlorotrimethylsilane. Furthermore, the formation of the Diels–Alder adducts undoubtedly specified that the reaction pathway proceeds through benzylidynephosphane 17b (Scheme 6).

Hassner's research has demonstrated the IEDDA reaction of alkyl substituted 14e and fused cyclopentadienones 14e with 1-azirines 19a–d to access 3H-azepines 22a–h.23 The reaction proceeds via the classical Diels–Alder reaction followed by the removal of carbon monoxide leading to the formation of 2H-azepines 21a–d. Subsequently, 21a–d was transformed into 3H-azepines 22a–dvia the 1,5-hydrogen shift. Under the same reaction conditions, benzocyclopentadienone 23a selectively yielded 2H-azepines 21e–g. Interestingly, compounds 21e–g did not undergo the 1,5-H shift reaction to form the corresponding 3H-azepine derivatives because of the aromatic nature of the fused benzene ring in compounds 21e–g. Nonetheless, the less aromatic nature of the centered benzene ring in phenanthrene fused cyclopentadienone 23b (a 2H-azepine) underwent isomerization to form 3H-azepines 22e–h at a higher temperature (Scheme 7).

The same group highlighted the synthesis of highly crowded aniline analogs 25a–c, cyclohexa-1,4-diene 27a, and hexa-substituted benzene 27b from the synthesized 3H-azepines 22i–m by a post-functionalization using the acid-mediated ring contraction reaction (Scheme 8).24

Ried et al. determined the diene reactivity of various cyclones 24a/23c–e based on adduct formation in the IEDDA reaction with dibenzoyldiimide 28 (Scheme 9). The reactivity order is as follows: acecyclone 23c > aceanthrencyclone 23d > tetracyclone 24a > phenalenocyclone 23e. The least reactivity of phenalenocyclone 23e is because the electronic effect of the carbonyl unit reduced the diene nature.25

Interestingly, azulenecyclones 23f/g underwent the IEDDA reaction smoothly with thiophosgene, p-nitrosodimethylaniline, and N-phenylmaleimide offered the respective cycloaddition products 30a–d in good yields (Scheme 10). In the case of carbonyl incorporated azulenecyclone 23g, the decarbonylated product 30c with p-nitrosodimethylaniline was delivered though the carbonyl replacement with a methylene group. However, 23f failed to take part in the decarbonylation reaction and produced only the DA-adduct 30a.26 Similarly, CO elimination was not observed in the case of the reaction of azulenocyclone 23g with thiophosgene even at high temperatures. Surprisingly, at 220 °C, CO elimination occurred in the case of N-phenylmaleimide-dihydro-azulenecyclopentadienone adduct 30b.

Jutzi and co-workers accomplished the synthesis of novel [4.4]triazolopyridazinedionophane 31a and tetracyclohenicosatrienone 31bvia the IEDDA reaction of double-layered cyclophanoid cyclopentadienone 14f with 4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3,5-dione and diethyl diazenedicarboxylate under toluene reflux conditions (Scheme 11). Interestingly, in the case of cyclic diaza-dienophile, the decarbonylation occurred easily; however, in the case of the linear diaza-dienophile a partial decarbonylation was observed.27

Recently, Mastalerz and co-workers have prepared dibenzoylpyrene 32avia the IEDDA reaction of pyrene fused cyclone 23h with O2 in air.28 Furthermore, it was transformed into different hetero[c]-annulated pyrenes 33a–c by the Paal–Knorr condensation. The oxidative ring-opening of pyrene-based cyclone 23h was carried out in the presence of air at 180 °C in diphenyl ether followed by condensation using lithium aluminum hydride/diethyl ether (LiAlH4/Et2O), sodium-bi-carbonate/P4S10/acetonitrile, and hydrazine hydrate-pyridine/Zn in acetic acid (AcOH) leading to the formation of annulated isobenzofuran 33a, isobenzothiophene 33b and isobenzopyrrole 33c, respectively. Similarly, bis-[c]fused hetero annulated pyrenes 33d–f (Scheme 12) have been synthesized from the related bis-cyclone 23i.

2.3. The DA reaction of CPD with imines
Villemin et al. developed the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolones 35a/35b/35e/35f by the Povarov type of [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between cyclones 14c/14h and in situ generated electron-deficient aromatic imines VIIa/b.29 Similarly, dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]naphtha[2,3-h]quinoline derivatives 35g/35h have also been achieved by the treatment of symmetrical and also unsymmetrical cyclopentadienones 14c/14h with N-arylamines 34c and formaldehyde in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid under acetonitrile reflux conditions. However, 2,5-(bismethoxycarbonyl)-3,4-diphenylcyclopentadienone 14g failed under similar conditions owing to the highly electron-deficient nature of the cyclone. The mechanism of construction of hydroquinolones via cyclocondensation is highlighted in Scheme 13.

2.4. The DA reaction of CPD with N-substituted-maleimide analogs
The research group of Mahgoub has analyzed30 the reactivity of tetracyclone 24a and phencyclone 23b with N-substituted maleimides 36a/b. Both the cyclones 24a/23b underwent the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides 36a/b under toluene reflux conditions and aromatization of the resultant dihydrophthalimides 37a–d gave the desired N-substituted phthalimides 38a–d in good yields. Indeed, the reaction indicates that the reactivity of phencyclone 23b is higher than that of tetracyclone 24a (Scheme 14). Moreover, the dihydro-diene intermediate in the tetracyclone 37a/b system further undergoes a cycloaddition reaction with dienophiles such as maleic anhydride 36d, β-nitrostyrene 36c, and maleimides 36a/b and furnished the corresponding bis-adducts 39a–f. However, the latter reaction has failed in the case of phencyclone 37c/d due to the localization of the diene portion as a part of the fused ring.

Harano's group31a has observed that the phencyclone-maleimide adducts 40e–j function as a good crystalline host. They have synthesized diverse N-arylated maleimide-phencyclones, for example, phenyl 40e, p-tolyl 40f, benzyl 40g, o-methyltolyl 40h, 1-naphthyl 40i, and 1-naphthylmethylene 40j units (Scheme 15). Based on the geometry, the N-naphthyl attached bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene-1-one adduct 40i showed a good crystalline inclusion complex with 2-butanone via interatomic interactions (C–H⋯π & C–H⋯O) than others 40e–h/40j. Relatively, Rothchild and co-workers have prepared31b a series of hindered phencyclone Diels–Alder adducts 40a–d with vinylene carbonate 36g, vinylene tri-thiacarbonate 36h, and strong electron-withdrawing group substituted N-aryl maleimides 36e/f.

Furthermore, using the same strategy, Pei and co-workers have developed a variety of fluoranthene fused maleimide derivatives 41e–lvia two-directional functionalizations from acecyclones 23j–23m (Scheme 16). They have also intensively investigated the synthesized annulated di-imides 41e–l under photophysical and electrochemical studies.32 The results specified that LUMO energy values was tuned from −3.2 to −3.8 eV by exchanging the substituent from the H to CN group in the free acenaphthylene side.

From the interesting results, the same group extended their strategy to synthesize highly π-conjugated donor–acceptor based aromatic fused-imides such as mono/dimeric fluoranthene-di-imides 41m–s as well as mono/bis-acenaphtho[1,2-k]fluoranthene-fused di-imides 41t/41u (Scheme 17). The LUMO of the synthesized compounds 41m–u varied from −3.4 to −3.8 eV through mono 41m–t to bis aromatic fused imides 41o–s/41u, and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.37% was obtained in the case of mono acenaphtho[1,2-k]fluoranthene-fused imide 41t.33

Einhorn and co-workers have reformed the protocol for the synthesis of polyaryl substituted phthalimides 43a–k by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of tetracyclones 24b–l with 2-bromomaleimide 42a instead of maleimide. This protocol provides numerous advantages like step-economy, high yield, reduce reaction time, and easy separation (Scheme 18).34 It is mainly due to the cycloaddition-decarbonylation-dehydrobromination sequence involved in a facile manner. In the same way, a wide range of acenaphthylene fused phthalimide derivatives 43l–p have also been synthesized in good yields.

Larsen's research group has developed35 thermally stable, water-soluble tetrahydro-methanoisoindole-trione intermediates 40k/40l based on the N-protected anchoring group in bromomaleimides 42b/42c. The intermediates 40k/40l were applied as carbon monoxide (CO) prodrugs under physiological conditions via the releasing of carbon monoxide (CO) into cells. The deprotection reaction of N-Boc 43s/43t was achieved using hydrochloric acid (HCl), and purification was carried out using a reverse-phase column with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to yield the corresponding TFA-amino salts 43u/43v (Scheme 19).

2.5. The DA reaction of CPD with C–C double bonded dienophiles
Crowded tetraphenylcyclopent-3-en-1-one linked triazole derivatives 48a–c have been achieved by the IEDDA of aryl substituted cyclopentadienones 24a with acrolein, and the subsequent one-pot reaction of amines and azides with a resulting mixture of adducts 44a/b (exo:endo, 95:5).36 The reaction sequences resulting in the IEDDA of cyclones with acrolein were followed by the condensation of amine and aldehyde, [3 + 2] enamine-azide cycloaddition, and retro-Michael type rearrangement. Indeed, systematic studies revealed that the one-pot reaction (44 → 45) is more facile than the stepwise reaction (44 → 46 → 45), and also the synthesis of stereo-specific spiro[bicycle[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one triazoles] 45a–c/d–fvia enamine-azide pathways is superior to the IEDDA of 1-aryl-5-amino-4-methylene-triazoline 49 with cyclones 24a. The rearrangement is more facile for the formation of 4-amino-triazoles 48a–c from spiro-triazole 45a–c/d–f due to the relief of a highly strained nature (Scheme 20).

Ballabio et al. have employed 4-methylene-5-morpholinoisoxazole core 50 as a dienophile to access thermodynamically labile bicyclic intermediate 51.37 Under optimized reaction conditions, a mixture of two azirines 53a/b and 54a/b was obtained via the retro-Michael type rearrangement of intermediate isoxazoles 52a/b followed by the IMDA between enolic diene with azirine. At a higher temperature (180 °C) it favors the formation of tetracyclic-azirines 54a/b wherein at a lower temperature (<150 °C) tri-substituted azirines 53a/b were obtained selectively. Additionally, when the IEDDA was performed between cyclopentadienones 14c/24a and 4-methylene-5-morpholinoisoxazole 50 under molten conditions, the tetracyclic-azirines 54a/b were formed predominantly (Scheme 21).

Plater et al. described the influence of the aryl group in cyclopentadienone 24a/23b/14c/d reformed product formation when the IEDDA reaction was carried out with 6-bromotrithiadiazepine 55.38 2,3,4,5-Tetraphenylcyclopentadienone 24a upon reaction with 6-bromotrithiadiazepine 55 in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine gave the unexpected annulated dithiin 56a along with piperidyltrithiadiazepine 56b. The unusual dithiin 56a was obtained via the formation of less stable benzotrithiadiazepine IX and its loss of N2S to form o-dithioquinone X followed by the IEDDA reaction with cyclone. However, 2,5-dimethyl and 2,5-diethyl-3,4-diphenylcyclone 14c/d, as well as phencyclone 23b afforded stable benzotrithiadiazepines 57a–c as sole products under acetonitrile reflux conditions. Interestingly, at an elevated temperature (220 °C) the reaction yielded trithiole 58a–c derivatives due to the loss of N2. The steric compression between the phenyl units is less in phencyclone than in tetraphenylcyclone; similarly, 2,3-dimethyl and 2,3-diethyl-3,4-diphenylcyclones 14c/d are less steric towards the peri-sulphur atom and selectively lead to stable benzotrithiadiazepine 57c. The [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of 2-methyl-3,4,5-triphenylcyclone 14h with 6-bromotrithiadiazepine 55 provided with a mixture of 57d (19% yield) and 58d (6% yield). Indeed, performing the same reaction in the presence of DMAD yielded product 59 (Scheme 22).

Allyl alcohols 60a–e and allylamine 60f have different reactivities in the IEDDA reaction with cyclopentadienone 14g.39 The IEDDA reaction of cyclone 14g with homoallylic alcohols 60a–c in chloroform reflux gave endo Diels–Alder adducts 61a–c and isomeric hydrophthalides 62a–c/63a–c. The cyclization arises through an exo-oriented hydroxyl group cleaving the bridgehead carbonyl-carbon bond in an intramolecular nucleophilic fashion. Likewise, cinnamyl alcohol 60d and cis-2-buten-1,4-diol 60e were subjected to the IEDDA reaction with cyclopentadienone 14g and yielded the appropriate stereoselective hetero-bi and tricyclic compounds 62d/63d as major products. In contrast, under similar reaction conditions, allylamine 60f with cyclone 14g selectively gave tetracyclic core 63f (Scheme 23). This is because the amino group was preferentially involved in the Michael addition with an enone part in cyclone 14g followed by the 1,5-sigmatropic rearrangement of the amino group and the intramolecular Diels–Alder (IMDA) reaction between the styrene moiety and allyl unit.

A new assortment of tetraphenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1-a]isoindol-11-one 66a, a green organic light-emitting diode material obtained via the condensation reaction of tetraphenylphthalic anhydride 64 and o-phenylenediamine 65a has been documented by the research group of Troshin. Under similar reaction conditions, the reaction between tetraphenylphthalic anhydride 64 and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine 65b gave an inseparable mixture of three isomeric bis-benzimidazo-isoindolone compounds 66b–d.40a,b Furthermore, Zhao and co-workers have expanded this strategy and achieved phenazine fused imidazole-isoindolone 66g using phenazine-2,3-diamine 65d. Surprisingly, easily separable isomeric imidazole-isoindolone based heptacenes 66e/f (syn/anti) were obtained from the reaction of 64 with 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene hydrochloride 65c. The necessary antecedent tetraphenylphthalic anhydride 64 was prepared by employing the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of tetracyclone 24a with maleic anhydride (Scheme 24).

Wang and co-workers have synthesized buckybowl 72 through multi-step solution-phase reaction chemistry.9a The key intermediate of the di-fluorenone moiety 71 was accomplished mainly via the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethoxycarbonyl-3,4-diphenylcyclopentadienone 14g and 2,5-dihydrofuran followed by a sequential cyclization protocol. The Diels–Alder adduct 67 upon reaction with water at 50 °C led to a diester. Furthermore, hydrolysis of a dicarboxylic ester and the subsequent Lewis-acid mediated intramolecular cyclization of the corresponding acyl chloride to produce the tetrahydrofuran framework 68 was achieved. Next, selective dimethylation was carried out at the less hindered side followed by the nucleophilic addition of fluorenyl-keto group 69 by lithium acetylide to furnish propargylic alcohol 70. The required di-fluorenone 71 was obtained via the SOCl2 mediated cascade reaction of resultant propargylic acid followed by air-oxidation using silica gel. Furthermore, hetero bearing di-fluorenone intermediate 71 was converted into carbocyclic fullerene 72 analogs by multiple reaction steps (Scheme 25).

Recently, tetraaryl tethered dibenzothiophene analogs 74a–e through the IEDDA reaction of benzo[b]thiophene S,S-dioxide 73 with tetraarylcyclopentadeienones 24a–e in diphenyl ether at 150 °C have been reported (Scheme 26). However, the conversion of sulfone to sulfur has not been explained clearly.41
 Scheme 26  Synthesis of tetraaryl tethered dibenzothiophene analogs. 
Very recently, Mohanakrishnan and co-workers explained42 the aromatization pathway of the [4 + 2] cycloaddition between benzo[b]thiophene S,S-dioxides 73 and diverse cyclones 24a/24c/24g/24j. They have also proposed a plausible mechanism based on both experimental and computational studies. The results showed that the elimination of hydrogen peroxide (formation of H2O2 from two hydroxyl radical cleavage) facilitated by the hydrogen shift from the intermediate dihydrodibenzothiophene S,S-dioxides leads to dibenzothiophene analogs 74f–i. The removal of hydrogen peroxide was exclusively confirmed by the formation benzophenone/fluorenone. Following the IEDDA protocol, an extensive collection of highly conjugated sulfur incorporated structurally complex linear and bent heteroacenes 74j–x has been obtained (Scheme 27).
 Scheme 27  The [4 + 2] cycloaddition between cyclones and diverse benzo[b]thiophene S,S-dioxides. 
Harano et al. extensively investigated the possibilities of mono DA 77a–i and double Diels–Alder (DDA) product 78a–i formation in the reaction between acenaphthylene fused cyclopentadienone 23t and various non-conjugated diene 75a–i systems (Scheme 28). The dienophiles 75a–c with cyclopentadienone exclusively provided DDA product 78a–c under chloroform reflux conditions.43 Under similar reaction conditions, vinyl acrylate 75d gave only mono DA product 77d. However, the reaction at 120 °C leads to DDA product 78d. Interestingly, in the case of diallyl ether 75e, diallyl sulfide 75f and diallylacetamide 75g afforded hetero tricyclics 78e–g (the DDA products) at a higher temperature (∼200 °C). Dienophiles 75h and 75i do not form DDA products 78h/i, and only mono DA products 77h/i were obtained even at a very high temperature.
 Scheme 28  The formation of mono DA and Double Diels–Alder (DDA) products in the reaction between acenaphthylene fused cyclopentadienone. 
Recently, an unusual formation of 1,4-diphenyl-1,2-dihydrotriphenylene-1,2-diol 80 in the [4 + 2]-cycloaddition between phencyclone 23b and vinyl carbonate 36g was observed.44 The formation of cyclic ester 79 involves classical DA adduct production followed by a 1,5-carbonate shift. Furthermore, cyclic ester 79 underwent photolysis to form 2,5-diphenylphenanthro[9,10-b]oxepin 80 with the formation of 1,4-diphenyltriphenylen-2-ol 81 as a minor product. The mechanism of the formation of cyclic ester 79, oxepin 80 and triphenylen-2-ol 81 is shown below (Scheme 29).
 Scheme 29  The [4 + 2]-cycloaddition between phencyclone and vinyl carbonate. 
The research group of Pascal Jr. has explored temperature-depended product formation in the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between cyclones 23c/b and bisnaphtho-quinone 82a/b. Performing the thermal cycloaddition reaction between 5,5′-binaphthoquinone 82a or 6,6′-dimethoxy-5,5′-binaphthoquinone 82b and acecyclone 23c in nitrobenzene at 210 °C afforded giant biaryl-bisquinones 83a/bvia decarbonylation and dehydrogenation.45 Nonetheless, performing the same reaction (6,6′-dimethoxy-5,5′-binaphthoquinone 82b and acecyclone 23b) at 250 °C selectively furnished an unexpected more twisted hairpin furan 84a. Similarly, two triphenylene fused-pentahelicene based molecular ribbons 84b have also been achieved by the reaction of phencyclone 23b and 6,6′-dimethoxy-5,5′-binaphthoquinone 82b at 260 °C, while at 210 °C the respective giant bis-quinone 83c/d was obtained. Furthermore, fluoranthene-bis-quinone 84a upon reaction with hydroiodic acid (HI) in acetic acid for a week gave the rearrangement product of planar isohairpin furan 85 (Scheme 30).
 Scheme 30  Temperature-depended product formation in the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between cyclones and bisnaphtho-quinone. 
Excitingly, the same group acknowledged a different pathway followed in the reaction between phencyclone 23b with pyrenequinone 86a/b in the thermal/Lewis-acid mediated Diels–Alder reaction (Scheme 31).46 Phencyclone 23b underwent a thermal cycloaddition reaction with 1,6-/1,8-pyrenequinone 86a/b (1:1) in diphenylether at 280 °C to produce annulated pyreno-triphenylene 87a and cyclic-ketone 87b based on 1,8-pyrene quinone via the Diels–Alder and hetero-Diels–Alder approach. Indeed, under the Lewis-acid (FeCl3/BF3·OEt2) catalyzed conditions enantiomeric polycyclic-ketones 87c/d were obtained based on 1,6-pyrenequinone by the double hetero Diels–Alder reaction (α,β-unsaturated ketone heterodyne, and cyclopentenone dienophile).

Warrener et al.47 have prepared U-shaped oxygenated inner cavity molecule precursors 89a/b for making alicyclic rigid molecular belts. The norbornene 88 π-centered cavity molecule upon the cycloaddition reaction with tetracyclone 14c/phencyclone 23u in toluene reflux led to self-assembled compounds 89a/b in moderate yields (Scheme 32). The inner functionalization of self-assembled compounds is extremely beneficial for the host–guest analysis through non-covalent bonding interactions.
 Scheme 32  Synthesis of the U-shaped oxygenated inner cavity molecule precursors. 
2.6. The DA reaction of CPD with triple bonded dienophiles
Harano et al.48 have explained the deviation in the product formation based on Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of HOMO and LUMO. The dienophilic-HOMO value of allylamine represents the dienophilic π-orbital contained in the nitrogen atom (n-HOMO), whereas, the allyl alcohol is existing in the π-bond (π-HOMO). Additionally, they stated that alkyne attached primary amine 90a gave bicyclic compound 91a, while, secondary amines 90b/c gave tetracyclic compounds 91b/c. This is because primary amines involved in 1,4-addition followed the ene reaction (between an enolic system with an alkyne); however, the secondary amine follows a series of reactions such as 1,4-addition, 1,5-sigmatropic rearrangement, IMDA reaction, and dehydrogenation (Scheme 33). Besides, if the primary amine contains α-branched groups 90d and 90e, it leads to a mixture of bicyclic and tetracyclic compounds 91d/e and 91f/g, respectively.
 Scheme 33  Cycloaddition reaction with propargylic primary and secondary amines. 
Gourdon and co-workers have analyzed the influence of the tertiary group in the pyrimidine ring, and it was observed that these groups played a vital role in synthesizing hetero-superbenzenes 94a–d using the Scholl oxidation reaction. Initially, different pyrimidyl-penta-phenyl benzenes 93a–d have been attained by the IEDDA reaction of cyclones 24a/24m/24n with phenylethynylpyrimidines 92a–c in diphenylether at 260 °C under microwave irradiation. Furthermore, the FeCl3-catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of 93a–d was carried out. Interestingly, the tertiary butyl group incorporated in the 2nd position of pyrimidine 93d promotes the complete cyclization and selectively leads to diaza-superbenzene 94d (Scheme 34). This is because the tertiary group in compound 93d enhances the nucleophilicity of the pyrimidine unit and increases the solubility, thus avoiding the formation of oligomers.49
 Scheme 34  The IEDDA reaction of cyclones with phenylethynylpyrimidines. 
Laine and co-workers50 have synthesized hybrid siloxane-polyphenylene macromolecules 96a–c by the IEDDA reaction of octa(diphenylacetylene)silsesquioxane 95a/b and tetraarylcyclopentadienones 24a/24k under diphenyl ether reflux conditions. Furthermore, the octa(hexaarylbenzene)octasilsesquioxane was converted into 3D-octgraphenes 96a–c by cyclodehydrogenation using ferric chloride via the Scholl reaction (Scheme 35).
 Scheme 35  Synthesis of hybrid siloxane-polyphenylene macromolecules. 
Pei and co-workers created diverse planar thiaheteroacene 99a and also non-planar thiahetero-[5]-helicene 99b /thiahetero-[7]-helicene 99cvia a three-step reaction beginning from tetracyclone 14d and thiophenyl-acetylenes 97a–c (Scheme 36). The reaction sequence involved [4 + 2] cycloaddition, decarbonylation, bromination and cyclodehydrogenation as mentioned in the previous strategy.51
 Scheme 36  Synthesis of diverse planar thiaheteroacene. 
The same group developed air-stable sulfur-doped pentacene 99d–g materials for thin-film organic field-effect transistors (OFET).52 The IEDDA reaction between acecyclone 23v and dithienylacetylene 97a gave thiophene linked fluoranthene 98c followed by ring bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and then the Suzuki coupling with various aryl boronic acids led to the corresponding arylated fluoranthenes 98d–g. Finally, the resultant fluoranthenes 98d–g underwent oxidative cyclization using FeCl3 to afford sulfur incorporated benzo[k]fluoranthenes 99d–g (Scheme 37). The materials showed fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 16% to 23%. During the thermal annealing process, the materials exhibited a carrier mobility value of 0.083 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a current on/off ratio of 106 in a vacuum-deposited film. Furthermore, it was revealed that the structure–property relationship is based on the thermal annealing process, and it was also observed that the methoxy unit at different positions decreased the HOMO levels, thus influencing the quality of crystalline and film morphologies in devices.
 Scheme 37  Synthesis of air-stable sulfur-doped pentacenes. 
Volz et al. synthesized annulated non-classical thiophenes 101a–d by the IEDDA reaction of cyclones 23c/23w/23b/23x with 1,2-diaroylacetylene 100a/b followed by the Paal–Knorr condensation of resultant 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds 100c/d and tetraphosphorous decasulfide (P4S10).53 Primarily, acecyclones 23c/23w underwent the IEDDA reaction with 1,2-diaroylacetylene 100a/b in ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at 180 °C and furnished 1,2-dibenzoyl derivatives 100c/d. Next, the sulfurization reaction was carried out using excess P4S10 in acetonitrile for 5 h. Similarly, the annulated form of triphenylene[c]thiophene 101c and dimethylfluorenyl[c] thiophene 101d has also been achieved (Scheme 38).
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of annulated non-classical thiophenes. 
Diverse PAH-chromophore attached indolo[b]quinoxalines 103a–f by the IEDDA reaction of tetracyclone 24a /acecyclone 23c /phencyclone 23b with indolo[b]quinoxaline-triple bonded dienophiles 102a/b in diphenylether reflux were reported by Thomas and co-workers (Scheme 39).54 The synthesized materials 103a–f accounted for moderate electronic properties such as fluorescence quantum yields (ϕ = 2–17%) and energy gap value (2.67–2.72 eV), glass transition temperature (Tg = 103–156 °C), and decomposition temperature (Td = 483–496 °C). Additionally, it was found that the thermal properties have been impressively enhanced after the incorporation of benzene, fluoranthene, and triphenylene units into indolo[b]quinoxalines. Particularly, fluoranthene-quinoxaline materials 103c/d fabricated into two types of multi-layered organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), namely, as electron transport and emitting materials displayed an external quantum efficiency of 0.46%, and as an electron-emitting material with the electron transport material as the 1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBI) layer showed 0.32% quantum efficiency. These results revealed that the new hybrid materials unveiled good electron transport as well as emitting materials in OLED.
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of PAH-chromophore attached indolo[b]quinoxalines. 
Patil and co-workers have accomplished fluoranthene-based strong electron transport materials such as bis-fluoranthene attached diphenylthiophene/dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxides 106a/b involving the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between acecyclone 23c and bis-acetylenylthiophenes 104a/b under diphenyl ether reflux conditions followed by oxidation using hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 40).55 Besides, they also studied ring closure effects based on the physical and electronic properties. In the circumstance of ring closed thiophene S,S-dioxide 106b a crystalline nature is observed whereas unfused thiophene S,S-dioxide 106a displayed a higher glass transition temperature (Tg = 210 °C). However, both bisfluoranthene-thiophene S,S-dioxides 106a/b showed greater thermal stability with an energy gap of 3.3/3.4 eV, durability (490/510 °C), high quantum yields (77/79%), and good electron transport properties in blue OLEDs.

3. Synthesis of organometallic precursors through the DA reaction using CPD
3.1. Synthesis of porphyrin-core complexes
The research group of Osuka has ascribed a new kind of dibenzocorannulene-fused porphyrin dyad 110a–d by the regioselective FeCl3-mediated intramolecular cyclization reaction.56 The meso-linked dibenoz[a,g] corannulene-porphyrins 109a/b underwent the Scholl reaction to form five-membered fused dibenoz[a,g] corannulene-porphyrins 110a/b owing to proximity (less bond length of pyrrole ring) favoring the five-membered rather than six-membered. Indeed, β-linked dibenoz[a,g] corannulene-porphyrins 109c/d gave six-membered dibenoz[a,g] corannulene-porphyrin dyads 110c/d, due to steric congestion between the meso position of porphyrin and the benzo position in dibenzocorannulene. The coupling partner dibenzocorannulene-boronic ester 107b has been prepared by the IEDDA of acecyclone 23y and norbornadiene (Scheme 41). The π-extended conjugation of six-membered fused porphyrins 110c/d exhibited red-shifted absorption as well as fluorescence, and the HOMO–LUMO gap value is ∼1.69 eV. The five-membered porphyrins 110a/b have shown anti-aromatic porphyrinoid characteristics, are non-fluorescent, and have a lower energy gap (1.50 eV) represented by the pseudo 20π electronic systems of dehydropurpurin.
 Scheme 41  Synthesis of dibenzocorannulene-fused porphyrin dyads. 
Kimura and co-workers have attributed a different kind of highly crowded cobalt phthalocycanines57112c/d from their respective dicyanophenylbenzenes 112a/b by the reaction of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol under DMAE reflux conditions (Scheme 42). The oligophenylene unit 112c/d at the periphery side prevents intermolecular aggregation, increases solubility, and enhances the site selectivity as well as binding ability. The requisite precursor of metallophthalocyanines 112a/b has been prepared via the IEDDA reaction of cyclones 24a/24n, and dibrominated-diphenylacetylenes 111a/b followed by the Rosenmund–von Braun reaction of copper cyanide (CuCN) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP).
 Scheme 42  Synthesis of highly crowded cobalt phthalocycanines pertaining dicyanophenylbenzenes. 
Similarly, fluorinated polyphenylene dendritic azaphthalocyanine 113c has been created by the Faust research group for developing photosensitizer activity against auto-photooxidation.58 The strong electronegativity of pentafluorophenyl units enhanced the solubility, photooxidative stability, and chromophore's oxidation potential. They have investigated based on the formation of 1O2-phosphoresence ability, UV/Visible absorption spectra, and reduction potential analysis between fluorous and parent non-fluorous porphrazine compounds, the earlier one (160 fluorine substituents) functions as a good photo-sensitizer and increases resistance towards auto-photooxidation. Furthermore, the thirty-two pentafluoro groups at the periphery position increased the solvation effect even in apolar organic solvents. The synthesis involves a sequential reaction from the microwave assisted IEDDA reaction between tetracyclone 24o and carbonyl phenanthrene-diethynyl 111c followed by ketal hydrolysis of 113a and condensation of the ensuing quinone with diaminomaleonitrile gave perifluorous porphrazine 113b. Furthermore, it underwent base-induced cyclotrimerization followed by the metal interchange reaction of magnesium by zinc using zinc acetate to produce a particular perfluorous-dibenzoquinoxalinoporphyrazine-zinc complex 113c (Scheme 43).

3.2. Synthesis of the pyridine-based organometallic complex
Müllen and co-workers realized59 innovative tris-(2-phenylpyridyl)Ir(III) cored polyphenylene dendrimers 116–119 up to the fourth generation in high yield (>80%) by the repetitive Diels–Alder reaction of cyclone 24a and Ir(III)-centered terminal alkynes 114 (Scheme 44). The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of synthesized dendrimers 116–119 reached up to 36% from 8% (G1-8%, G2-22%, G3-30%, and G4-36%). Moreover, the analysis of dendrimer fabricated device performance in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) showed that G3 generated dendrimer 118 (G1-0.6, G2-3.3, G3-4.9 & G4-0.8%) has greater efficiency than other dendritic 116/117/119 generations.
 Scheme 44  Synthesis of tris-(2-phenylpyridyl)Ir(III) cored polyphenylene dendrimers. 
3.3. Synthesis of the bi-pyridine based organometallic complex
The same research group applied a similar Diels–Alder strategy and synthesized tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) based G1 to G3 shape persistent dendrimers 122a–d from the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of bipyridyl-bis-ethynyl 120 with tetraphenylcyclopentadienone 24a followed by complexation using the ruthenium(II) complex (Scheme 45).60
 Scheme 45  Synthesis of tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) based dendrimers. 
3.4. Synthesis of the aza-phenanthrene based organometallic complex
The research group of Pascal, Jr. has established configurationally stable highly twisted polycyclic aromatic cored metal complexes 126a/b involving the IEDDA reaction of azaphencyclones 7c with in situ engendered aryne and complexation using iridium chloride followed by treatment of 2,4-pentanedione with the resultant intermediate of the μ-chloro bridged iridium dimer (Scheme 46).61 In addition, due to very poor solubility of the racemic metal complexes 126a/b could not be resolved in the chiral form.
 Scheme 46  Synthesis of configurationally stable highly twisted polycyclic aromatic cored metal complexes. 
3.5. Synthesis of terpyridine/pyrimidine based organometallic complexes
A different class of terpyridylpentaphenylbenzene 128a has been achieved by Draper and co-workers. The reaction of cyclone 24n and terpyridylphenylacetylene 127a followed by an FeCl3-catalyzed intramolecular ring fusion reaction gave heterosuperbenzenes 129a/b. Complexation with ruthenium(II) produces a novel ruthenium(II) bis(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) complex 130a/b. Unfortunately, the N-doped HBC ligand 129b does not form a satisfactory amount of ruthenium complex with dichloroterpyridylruthenium(II).62 By applying the same methodology, bis-pyrimidyl cored bipyridyl-ruthenium complexes 130c–f have been achieved. In addition to that, fully cyclized 4N-superbenzene 129c also participated in facile complexation with bipyrimidyl-Ru(II), and allyl-Pd(II) catalysts afforded the respective bi-pyrimidyl-bipyridyl appended ruthenium 130d and palladium 130e complexes. The key precursor bis-pyrimidyltetraphenylbenzene 128b has been prepared via the [4 + 2] cycloaddition between tetracyclone 24n and bipyrimidylacetylene 127b (Scheme 47).
 Scheme 47  Synthesis of terpyridylpentaphenylbenzenes and their corresponding metal complexes. 
3.6. Synthesis of heterodinuclear complexes
The research group of Hirao has recognized selective hexaarylbenzene attached heterodinuclear catalysts 136a–d for intermolecular cross-pinacol coupling reactions from two aldehydes. They have identified heterobimetallic complexes 136a–d (with vanadium and titanium) that work effectively both for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes into high cross-selectivity pinacol products than existing hetero divanadium complexes. Interestingly, vanadium complexes activate only aromatic aldehydes; however, titanium complexes activate both aliphatic/aromatic system.63 The bimetallic complexes 136a–d have been achieved through stepwise condensation of aldehyde 132a with different aminophenols 133a/b followed by complexation with vanadium(V) oxide, then condensation of remaining aldehyde 134a/b with aminophenols 135a–c, and subsequent complexation using titanium(IV) oxide. The required highly phenylated benzene dialdehyde 132a was prepared from the IEDDA reaction of tetracyclone 24a and tolan 131 followed by demethylation of the methoxy group using boron tribromide (BBr3) in dichloromethane (Scheme 48).
 Scheme 48  Synthesis of hexaarylbenzene attached heterodinuclear complexes. 
4. Synthesis of N/O/S nanographenes via the DA reaction using CPD
4.1. Synthesis of N-doped nanographenes
Jux and co-workers have synthesized64 aza[5]-helicene skeletons 139a/b by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of tetracyclone 24n with pyrrole containing acetylene 137a/b followed by the FeCl3-catalyzed Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reaction (Scheme 49). The quasi-reversible oxidation values of β-pyrrolepentaphenylbenzenes 138a/b (138a = 1.32 V, 138b = 1.20 V) and the respective pentaphenyl (1.40 V) or hexaphenylbenzene (1.54V) values specified that the pyrrole unit influences the oxidation first rather than others. Equally, two reversible oxidation peaks of annulated azahelicenes 139a/b (139a = 0.85/0.80 V, 139b = 1.29 V/1.22 V) displayed a higher upper potential than hexabenzocoronene (HBC) (0.75 V & 1.18 V). This is due to the existence of withdrawing groups in the pyrrole unit.
 Scheme 49  Synthesis of aza[5]-helicene skeletons. 
The research group of Nierengarten has accomplished65 a novel hexaazatriphenylene cored nanographene 142a/b by the IEDDA reaction of tetracyclone 24m with six-ethynyl linked hexaazatriphenylene 140 followed by cyclization (27 C–C bonds formation) using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) oxidant and (TfOH) Brönsted acid. Both the N-doped diastereomeric nanographenes 142a/b (D3 & C2 symmetric) have shown an identical pattern in UV-visible, Raman, IR, and CD signals. The D3 propeller-shaped nanographene 142a has better solubility than 142b that favors facile chiral resolution. Similarly, highly insoluble benzothiadiazole fused nanographene 144 has been prepared in good yields (Scheme 50).
 Scheme 50  Synthesis of hexaazatriphenylene cored nanographenes and benzothiadiazole fused nanographene. 
Recently, Draper and co-workers have reported66 a new set of 4N-doped-HBC-based organic materials 147a to improve the performance of the OLED device. The incorporation of electronegative nitrogen atoms into the superbenzene 147a has increased the electron mobility of the system as well as enhanced thermal stability up to 450 °C. Moreover, the absence of tertiary butyl groups in heterosuperbenzene showed decomposition temperature around 800 °C. The synthetic pathway involves the IEDDA reaction between tetracyclone 24n and bipyridylacetylene 145a followed by Lewis-acid mediated Scholl cyclization of the resultant hexasubstituted benzene 146a (Scheme 51).
 Scheme 51  Synthesis of 4N-doped-HBC-based organic materials. 
The same group further enlightened the material applications by substitution of electron-donating methoxy groups at the periphery positions. The combination of bipyrimidyl and methoxy units attached to phenyl benzenes upon oxidative cyclohydrogenation gave completely cyclized products 147b/c in very good yield. However, monopyrimidyl along with methoxy tethered phenyl benzene 146b afforded both fully 147d and partly cyclized 147e products (Scheme 52). The HOMO destabilizing methoxy groups and LUMO stabilizing nitrogen atoms of 4N-doped superbenzenes 147b/c exhibited a higher reversible reduction wave (E1/2 = −1.62 V) than 2N 147d (E1/2 = −2.02 V) and also a lower HOMO–LUMO energy gap of 2.48 eV, whereas 2N nanographene 147d has 2.60 eV. In contrast, the fluorescence quantum yield of 2N 147d system (53%) is greater than that of 4N superbenzenes 147b/c (28% & 32%).67

4.2. Synthesis of S-bearing nanographenes
Similarly, 1-(3-thienyl)-2,3,4,5,6-penta(4-tert-butyl-phenyl)benzene 149 was prepared by Draper and co-workers. The oxidative cyclization of 149 selectively leads to S-doped HBC 150a along and dimeric twisted nanographene 150b (Scheme 53).68 Both the S-doped nanographenes 150a/b showed similar absorption (358, 368, 408 & 432 nm), emission (475 & 505 nm) profiles, and the fluorescence lifetime measurement displayed that both have bi-exponential factors. Due to the incidence of the thiophene unit in superbenzenes 150a/b exhibited three oxidation potentials (+0.38, +0.56 & +1.01 V) and the first oxidation value is lower than that of the corresponding parent carbon analog (+0.45 V) HBC.
 Scheme 53  Preparation of S-doped HBC and dimeric twisted nanographene. 
Yin et al. constructed sulfur-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (S-PAHs) 153via the [4 + 2]-cycloaddition pathway.69 The cyclone 24s underwent the IEDDA reaction with alkylated-diphenylacetylene 151 under diphenyl ether reflux conditions, followed by the Suzuki coupling using thienylboronic ester to furnish hexaphenylbenzene 152 in good yields. The thienyl-phenylbenzene 152 upon treatment with ferric chloride gave an expected C2-rectangle-shaped S-PAHs 153 (Scheme 54). The material 153 showed absorption bands at a longer wavelength (416, 530 & 577 nm), thermal stability up to 370 °C, and a higher HOMO energy value (−4.92 eV) compared with parent trithiopheno[a,g,m] coronene (TTC) (−5.51 eV). These exciting properties are highly useful in photovoltaic devices.

A new type of sulfur-bearing 3D nanographene 155 has been accessed via a two-step reaction etiquette by Martin and co-workers. The IEDDA reaction between cyclone 24n and cyclooctatetrathiophene cored tetraphenylacetylene 154 gave four-armed pentaphenylbenzene periphery attached cyclooctatetrathiophene, and subsequently cyclodehydrogenation gave 49-ring fused S-doped saddle-shaped nanographene 155 (Scheme 55).16a Additionally, the S-nanographene 155 has been probed for various applications along with analogous phenylene nanographene. The non-bonding sulfur atom 155 alters the properties such as absorption/emission bands appeared longer, first/second oxidation potential, and higher HOMO value (∼0.14 V) than phenylene nanographene. Besides, both the fluorescence quantum yields are almost the same (10%), though, the fluorescence lifetime decay of S-nanographene 155 is monoexponential (0.3 ns), whereas phenylene nanographene is biexponential (4.7 & 19.8 ns). Relatively, the intermolecular excited state interactions were executed between S-nanographene 155 and electron-donating as well as electron-withdrawing compounds like tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), and fullerene (C60).

4.3. Synthesis of O-incorporated nanographenes
The extremely π-extended bis-HBC-ether 158a and superhelicene 158b have been successfully synthesized (Scheme 56) by Jux and co-workers70 through the IEDDA reaction of tetracyclone 24n with ether-linked bis-diphenylacetylene 156 followed by oxidation (ferric chloride/MeNO2 and DDQ/TfOH). Additionally, they have accounted that non-planar hexabenzocoronenes (HBC) have outstanding photophysical properties than related planar HBC. Notably, oxa-[7]-helicene 158b exhibited a slightly longer red shift and also strong intense absorption/fluorescence peaks than bis-HBC-ether 158a. The [7]-helicene 158b alters the physical properties effectively such as fluorescence, quantum efficiency (ϕ = 80%) is approximately six times greater than that of bis-HBC-ether 158a (ϕ = 12%), time-resolved fluorescence decay rate (2.3 × 108 S−1/0.28 × 108 S−1), two reduction potential (−1.5, −1.8 eV/−1.6, −1.9 eV) three oxidation potentials (+0.9, +1.2 & +1.5 eV /+1.1, +1.3 & +1.5 eV), and HOMO–LUMO energy gap (2.4 eV/2.6 eV) compared to bis-HBC-ether 158a.

5. Synthesis of dendrimers through the DA reaction
The research group of Liu has constructed a new class of pentafluoro-phenyl surfaced perylenediimide (PDI) cored dendrimers 160d/evia a sequential IEDDA reaction between the cyclone 24o/24p/24t and the representative PDI cored terminal alkynes 159/160c (Scheme 57).71 Stimulatingly, the synthesized dendrimers 160a/b/d/e exposed absorption in the entire visible region, excellent fluorescence quantum yields (62–95%), good ionization potential (5.64–5.96 eV), and superior electron affinity (3.8–3.9 eV). From the exciting results, it should be noted that the attachment of a high electron affinity group in dendrimers increases the electron transport (e.g. n-type semiconducting properties), and thus can be used as potential materials for solar cells as well as OLED applications.

The research group of Müllen has extensively synthesized a library of chromophoric perylenediimide (PDI) 161a–h, terylene tetracarboxdiimide (TDI) 161i–k cored diverse periphery substituted polyphenylene dendrimers based on a multi-directional Diels–Alder approach (Scheme 58). All the dendrimers 161a–k showed a high fluorescence property. The different kinds of lipophilic, amphiphilic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic natured polyphenylene tethered rylene-imides 161a–k displayed remarkable materials as well as biological applications. Gratifyingly, the multi-layered chromophoric cyclic-imide-polyphenylenes 161f–k exhibited outstanding performance in optoelectronic devices.72

6. Synthesis of polymers via the DA reaction
Voit and co-workers73 have prepared a new brand of polyphenylene based crosslinked polymer 163avia the [4 + 2] cycloaddition between A2 + B2 type monomers. The main cored pyridine to pyridine 163a linkage takes place by three possible Diels–Alder approaches such as para-para163b, meta-para163c, and meta-meta163d (Scheme 59). Interestingly, the synthesized polyphenylene and cyanate-based resin 163a displayed a greater refractive index (1.65), a greater Tg value (240 °C-255 °C), excellent transparency in the visible region, and high thermal stability up to 450 °C.
 Scheme 59  The [4 + 2] cycloaddition between A2 + B2 type monomers. 
The unusual N-doped chevron-shaped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) 167 were assimilated by Bronner and co-workers. More stimulatingly, the synthesized 2N-GNRs167 (2.71 eV) unveiled lower bandgap energy than the corresponding 1N-GNRs (2.81 eV) as well as pristine GNRs (2.80 eV).74 The fundamental dipyridyl tethered triphenylene monomer 165 synthesized by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of dibromophencyclone 23z with dipyridylacetylene 164. Compound 165 was polymerized to 166 by the Au(III)-mediated desorption at 250 °C, and consequently, cyclodehydrogenation was carried out at 440 °C to afford the desired armchair edged N-bearing GNRs 167 (Scheme 60).

Based on the attractive nature of the abovementioned nitrogen deportment GNRs 167, Fischer and co-workers have changed the approach by incorporating electron-donor carbazole and acceptor phenanthridine founded GNRs 170.75 Given this, the required precursor of GNRs 169 was prepared by the IEDDA of dibromophenanthrene fused cyclopentadienone 23z with 4-ethynyl-N-methylcarbazole 168. Furthermore, the carbazole attached triphenylene 169 upon heating at 250 °C with the support of Au(III) led to the partially cyclized GNRs. At elevated temperature (400 °C) carbazole and phenanthridine-edged chevron-shaped GNRs 170 were obtained by thermally induced rearrangement followed by dehydrogenation (Scheme 61).

Thompson et al. have developed unique fluoranthene-triphenylene boronate-ester-based polymers 177a–c and their corresponding covalent organic framework (COF) 177a and covalent organic polymers (COPs) 177b/c (Scheme 62).76 The structure–function effect of polymers revealed that the non-planar fluoranthene structure affected the crystalline properties. The planar fluoranthene tethered COF 177a was mesoporous with a highly ordered crystalline structure (1180 m2 g−1) with a pore size of 37Å, whereas the non-planar mono phenyl and diphenyl linked fluoranthene COPs 177b/c were microporous materials (555 and 515 m2 g−1) with pore sizes ∼10Å. Moreover, after polymerization, the fluorescence value of COF 177a (10 nm), phenyl COPs 177b (15 nm), and diphenyl COPs 177c (25 nm) decreased compared to their corresponding monomers.

Easily soluble bistriazolinedione-benzophthalimide cored polymers 181a/b have been established by Stadler and co-workers through the Diels–Alder polyaddition between methylenediphenyl-bistriazolinedieone 180 and bis-dihydrobenzophthalimide 179a/b.77 Compound 179a/b was obtained by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of tetracyclone 14c/24a with methylenediphenyl-bismaleimide 178. Remarkably, the methyl-substituted dehydrobenzene 179a diene has shown thousand times superior reactivity than phenyl substitution 179b toward the polymerization reaction (Scheme 63).

Neenan and co-workers have built a novel dissimilar type of substituted bis-imide polymer 183a–l for enhancing dielectric properties by the Diels–Alder polymerization between oxygen bridged biscyclopentadienones 24v/w and bis-alkynated diimides 182a–d (Scheme 64).78 The synthesized symmetrical (sym)/unsymmetrical (unsym) polymers 183a–l showed a lower absorption value around 374 nm, and a weak glass transition temperature (Tg) ranging from 250–275 °C. Conversely, the highly branched polyphenylene-polyimide polymers 183a–l are used as good covering materials in organic dielectrics.

7. Conclusions
In this review article, we have outlined the synthesis of diverse hetero-atom bearing PAHs from simple heteroaromatic to larger graphene analogues, organometallic complexes, dendrimers, and polymers using cyclones. The adaptability of cyclopentadienones in the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions for making architecturally complicated heterocycles has been comprehensibly explained. The greater part of the synthesis involves hexagonal based planar hetero-frameworks; however, only narrow examples have been used for non-planar heterocycles. In contrast, scarce non-planar-like pentagonal (buckybowl), and heptagonal/octagonal (saddle) shaped carbocyclic compounds have been achieved using this strategy due to their good material applications. With the interesting material applications, there has been more attention devoted to designing novel non-planar (negative curvature) carbo/hetero-PAHs. Indeed, the reports are potentially valuable for further building up the negative curved carbo-PAHs materials, particularly, hetero doped highly twisted PAH skeletons.
