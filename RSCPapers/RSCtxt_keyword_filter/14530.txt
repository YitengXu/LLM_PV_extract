    , Accepted 4th January 2022First published on 7th January 2022AbstractWe have engineered, synthesized, and characterized a series of porphyrin sensitizers that contain either one or three methoxy groups on the phenyl ring of the triphenyl imidazole donor moiety and either 3-(5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (LG24 and LG26) or 2-(5-(benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene-2-yl)methelene-4-oxo-2-thiathiazolidin-3-yl-acetic acid (LG25 and LG27) acceptor groups, adopting a donor-π-acceptor structure. All four sensitizers are characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods. The Q bands of all four sensitizers are redshifted when compared to the previously detailed LG18 sensitizer, and the absorption onset is extended to 800 nm. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are delocalized on the triphenylimidazole donor and porphyrin macrocycle, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels reside on auxiliary acceptors and anchoring groups, facilitating intramolecular interactions. Finally, we have evaluated the photovoltaic performances of these sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using a liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and the performances were compared with the previously reported LG18 sensitizer. We observed lower efficiencies from the porphyrin dyes having rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring groups (LG25 and LG27) than from the porphyrin dyes having cyanoacrylic acid anchoring groups (LG24 and LG26). Both the LG24 and LG26 dyes with conjugated electron acceptors can not only maintain a broad absorption spectrum but they can also enhance the electronic structure, considerably improving electron injection and lowering charge recombination compared to our previous reports. On the other hand, the LG18 dye showed better photovoltaic performance than the LG24 and LG26 dyes, probably due to its more negative LUMO, and as a result its Voc was enhanced. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) order was LG26 ≥ LG24 > LG27 ≥ LG25. Furthermore, we fabricated a co-sensitized DSSC using the UV-absorbing dye Y1. The LG26 + Y1-based DSSC showed the highest PCE of 10.45%. To understand the reasons for the photovoltaic performance trends, we have carried out intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and nanosecond transient absorption studies on the present sensitizers and compared them with the previously reported sensitizer LG18.
Introduction
In recent years, focus on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has intensified after G24 released its first commercial products.1 Although commercialization has started, attention must still be paid to the design of low-cost efficient materials to further improve efficiency and, in particular, durability. O’Regan and Grätzel first reported DSSC technology in 1991 with a device efficiency of 7.1%, using a Ru(II) polypyridyl complex as a sensitizer.2 Over a period of a couple of decades, certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) values have reached 11.9% using Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as sensitizers and PCEs of up to 14.7% have been obtained using metal-free organic dyes.3,4 Despite these high efficiencies, the search for low-cost efficient materials and new fabrication methods is ongoing. Among the diverse components of DSSCs, the sensitizer plays an important role in achieving high PCEs. However, both ruthenium-based dyes and metal-free organic dyes have their own merits and drawbacks.5–7 As a result, porphyrins are found to be the best alternatives for use in DSSC technology, based on a concept inspired by natural photosynthesis. Porphyrins are widely present in biological systems and have shown impressive performance for many optoelectronic applications, such as organic light-emitting diodes, hole-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells, sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, and DSSCs.8–14
Several porphyrin-based dyes have been designed and used in DSSCs, using either meso-phenyl or β-pyrrole designs. However, their PCEs remained at ∼7%, perhaps due to the recombination of oxidized (whole) porphyrin with electrons present in the TiO2 conduction band.15–20 For this reason, the design strategy has been changed to a donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) concept, using an organic moiety as a donor, a porphyrin as a π-spacer, and a heteroaromatic moiety as an acceptor.21–30 In this design strategy, the hole in the porphyrin after the injection of an electron into the TiO2 conduction band migrated to the donor, minimizing recombination. Grätzel and several other groups, including our group, have adopted the D-π-A approach and a PCE of 13% was reported using a Co(III/II) redox couple.28 Further, device efficiencies using porphyrin sensitizers have been enhanced to 14.2% using either co-sensitization with an organic dye or using a tandem concept.31,32 These design strategies have provided a highly flexible platform in which the donor is generally an organic moiety having absorption in the UV region and connected to the meso-phenyl position of the porphyrin through an ethynyl bridge, porphyrin acts as a π-spacer, and an anchoring group, either cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-carboxylic acid, is present in an auxiliary acceptor heteroaromatic structure based on benzothiadiazole (BTD), thiophene, etc. In addition to this, the molecular structure also has long alkoxy chains at the ortho position of the meso-phenyl ring which are necessary to enhance the solubility of the dye in common organic solvents, minimize the aggregation of porphyrin dye on the TiO2 surface, and diminish the unnecessary recombination of electrons at the TiO2 conduction band with oxidized sensitizers. Grätzel et al. adopted a D-π-A design strategy and reported the porphyrin sensitizer SM315, utilizing a bulky bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine donor and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole auxiliary acceptor, obtaining a record PCE of 13% using a Co(III/II) redox mediator.28 We introduced a phenothiazine donor through an ethynyl bridge to the meso position of a porphyrin with a thiophene-2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor (LG5), obtaining a PCE of 10.20% using an I−/I3− redox couple.26 Recently, we substituted the donor phenothiazine for a non-planar triphenyl imidazole and used a 4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole auxiliary acceptor with cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group (LG18), observing a PCE of 10.51%.25 In an extension of our work aimed at the development of the efficient D-π-A approach using porphyrin sensitizers, we understand that the incorporation of electron-releasing groups into the donor triphenyl imidazole moiety may influence the photovoltaic performance. For this reason, we designed, synthesized, and characterized a series of porphyrin sensitizers having either one or three methoxy groups on the phenyl ring of the triphenyl imidazole moiety and using either 3-(5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (LG24 and LG26) or 2-(5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene-2-yl)methelene-4-oxo-2-thiathiazolidin-3-yl-acetic acid (LG25 and LG27) (Chart 1). All four sensitizers are characterized via various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods, and we evaluated the photovoltaic performances of these dyes in DSSCs using a liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte, comparing the performance with the previously reported sensitizer LG18. Additionally, we used the best performing LG26 dye with the UV-dye Y1 in a co-sensitization system, showing a PCE of 10.45%.

Experimental section
Materials
We procured all commercially available chemicals and reagents from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, and these were used without any further purification. All reactions were carried out with analytical reagent (AR) grade solvents and laboratory reagent (LR) grade solvents were used for purification and column chromatography. Column chromatography was carried out using ACME silica gel (100–200 mesh) and thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck precoated silica gel 60-F254 plates. All reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere using dry and degassed solvents.

General procedure for the synthesis of LG24–LG27. 
Compound 3 (250 mg, 0.15 mmol) and TBAF (0.8 mL, 1 M in THF) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (25 mL). The solution was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min under an inert atmosphere. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was quenched with H2O and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained residue (190 mg, 0.15 mmol) and respective acceptor (0.56 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous THF (25 mL) and Et3N (8 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this, Pd2(dba)3 (44.12 mg, 0.036 mmol) and AsPh3 (92.3 mg, 0.28 mmol) were added. The mixture was degassed for 20 min with an inert gas and refluxed for 17 h. After the completion of the reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified via silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 20/1) and recrystallized from MeOH/ether to give the corresponding sensitizer.

Methods and instrumentation

1H-NMR spectra were recorded using either a 400 or 500 MHz INOVA spectrometer. A Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer was used to record the FTIR spectra using the KBr pellet technique. A Shimadzu Biotech Axima Performance 2.9.3.20110624: Mode Linear, Power spectrometer was used to record Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra. Both differential pulse and cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed using a CHI instruments model CHI 620C potentiostat, as detailed in our previous reports. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Model UV-3600). The concentrations of the samples used for these measurements ranged from about 1 × 10−6 M (Soret band) to 5 × 10−5 M (Q-band). Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (FluoroLog3 model, JobinYvon), as detailed in our previous reports. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out using a picosecond time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) setup (FluoroLog3-Triple Illuminator, IBH Horiba JobinYvon), employing a picosecond light-emitting diode laser (NanoLED, λex = 405 nm) as the excitation source.
We used Gaussian 09 quantum chemical software on a personal computer for carrying out full geometry optimization of all sensitizers. For further calculations, we used the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set as inputs.34,35 Ground state properties, such as optimized energy structures and frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), were obtained based on density functional theory (DFT) in the gas phase.36 Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) was used for calculating excited state properties, like molecular contribution percentage, oscillatory strength, and singlet transition energy in tetrahydrofuran solvent.37,38

The DSSCs and TiO2 electrodes were prepared according to our previous work.25,26 Concisely, we fabricated 20 μm-thick TiO2 film on top of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (sheet resistance: 10 Ω square−1; transmission: >85%) with an active cell area of 0.25 cm.2 In order to further enhance the device efficiency, we deposited an additional light scattering layer with a thickness of ∼400 nm made of anatase TiO2 particles (8 μm-thick) via screen printing on the active transparent layer. These films were sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. The TiO2 films were immersed in dye solution (0.2 mM in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol) at ca. 80 °C and then kept at room temperature for 12–15 h to adsorb the sensitizers onto the respective TiO2 films. The photo-electrode was removed from solution after the complete adsorption of the dye on TiO2 and it was then washed with acetonitrile to remove un-adsorbed dye. The dye-coated photoanode and counter electrode were separated with a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed via heating the polymer at 100 °C. The redox electrolyte (a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.1–0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was introduced into the cell through a pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode, and this was later closed with cover glass to avoid leakage of the electrolyte solution. A black metal mask with an area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 G sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan) was used to measure the current–voltage characteristics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured in response to monochromatic incident light with an intensity of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route for the synthesis of the porphyrin sensitizers LG24–LG27 is shown in Scheme 1. The intermediates D1 and D2 were obtained via condensing either anisole benzil or benzil with 4-ethynyl benzaldehyde and P-anisidine in acetic acid. We have adopted methods reported in the literature for the synthesis of the vital porphyrin intermediate 2.22,25,26 Compound 3 was synthesized via carrying out a Sonogashira coupling reaction between 2 and either D1 or D2. Finally, the porphyrin sensitizers LG24–LG27 were synthesized via the deprotection of compound 3 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution (TBAF), followed by a coupling reaction with the relevant bromo-aromatic acids, using AsPh3 and Pd2(dba)3 as reagents. All these newly synthesized porphyrin sensitizers were characterized via various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods, including in situ electrochemical methods. The elemental analysis of all these sensitizers is found to be as expected (see the experimental section). The presence of molecular ion peaks in the respective MALDI-TOF-MS and 1H-NMR spectra confirms the molecular integrity of these newly synthesized porphyrin dyes (Fig. S1–S16, ESI†).

Optical properties
So as to understand absorption of light using the newly designed sensitizers, it is important to study their optical properties. Consequently, we have measured the optical absorption spectra of the newly designed sensitizers LG24–LG27 in THF solution, and the respective absorption spectra of the sensitizers are demonstrated in Fig. 1a. The resultant absorption maxima (λmax) and logarithmic molar extinction coefficients are shown in Table 1. From Fig. 1a and Table 1, the porphyrin sensitizers have characteristic absorption spectra, i.e., an intense Soret band at ∼449 nm and a less-intense Q band at ∼700 nm. The absorption peak on the higher energy side, i.e., at 350 nm, is due to the presence of the donor triphenylimidazole because at this wavelength the porphyrin macrocycle shows minimum absorption. The Soret band is not shifted compared to the LG18 sensitizer. Conversely, the Q band is redshifted by 5–9 nm in all newly synthesized sensitizers, which might be useful for trapping more light energy. Table 1 suggests that switching the auxiliary acceptor from thiophene (LG24 and LG26) to thiophene rhodanine-3-acetic acid (LG25 and LG27) results in a redshift of the Q band by 3–6 nm, probably due to the electron-withdrawing nature of rhodanine-3-acetic acid. The simulated absorption spectra of LG24–LG27 dyes attained via TD-DFT calculations are demonstrated in Fig. S17 (ESI†). Furthermore, we have observed the optical properties of the LG24–LG27 dyes when they were adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2 film (Fig. 1b), and the absorption spectra exhibit a redshift with a wider absorption range owing to the interaction of the sensitizers with TiO2 through π–π stacking on the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface. Fig. 1c illustrates the emission spectra of all four porphyrin dyes in THF solvent at room temperature, and the equivalent emission maxima and quantum yields are presented in Table 1. The emission intensities and quantum yields of LG25 and LG27 are low, when compared to the LG24 and LG26 sensitizers, which is possibly due to the presence of rhodanine-3-acetic acid. This is similar to our earlier study of porphyrin–rhodanine acetic acid based dyes.19 The emission intensity was further quenched when these sensitizers were adsorbed on top of TiO2, which might be due to electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer into the TiO2 conduction band. We have calculated the singlet-state energies (E0-0), which are useful for calculating the excited-state oxidation potential (Eox*), from the intersection of the emission and excitation spectra, and these were found to be ∼1.70 ± 0.05 eV, which are lower than the LG18 sensitizer. In addition to this, we also measured the singlet excited state lifetimes of these newly synthesized porphyrin sensitizers in THF solvent at r.t. (Fig. 1d and Fig. S18, ESI†), and they are found to be in the range of ∼1.30 ns.

Redox and spectroelectrochemical studies
The redox properties of the LG24–LG27 sensitizers were evaluated, with the intention of assessing the HOMO and LUMO levels, using cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric methods with 0.1 mM TBAPF6 in THF solvent as the supporting electrolyte and with the internal reference Fc/Fc+. Fig. 2a demonstrates cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms from all four porphyrin sensitizers, and the resulting redox values are shown in Table 1 (Fig. S19, ESI†). The ground state oxidation potential (EOX) values of the LG24–LG27 sensitizers were −5.78 eV, −5.76 eV, −5.80 eV, and −5.79 eV, respectively, and they showed reversible nature, corresponding with the LG18 sensitizer (−5.64 eV) under similar experimental conditions. The introduction of methoxy groups on the phenyl rings of the triphenylimidazole moiety did not have much effect on the oxidation potentials of the newly designed sensitizers. In addition to this, we measured the ionization potential (IP) (equivalent to the ground state oxidation potential) values of the LG24–LG27 dyes anchored to TiO2 film, obtained using a photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-3E), and the results are presented in Table 1. We used the expression EOX* = IP − E0-0 for calculating the excited state oxidation potentials of the freshly synthesized porphyrin dyes, and they were found to be more negative than the TiO2 conduction band (−5.18 eV); the results are tabulated in Table 2. These results demonstrate that the electrons in the excited state of the sensitizer could be easily injected into the TiO2 conduction band and oxidized dye could be easily reduced upon taking an electron from the redox couple, as revealed in the energy level diagram (Fig. 3a).

In order to understand the stability of the sensitizers in an oxidized state, which is one of the essential factors determining the durability of a dye, we have performed spectroelectrochemical studies of the newly designed sensitizers. Fig. 2b demonstrates the representative example of the LG26 sensitizer under controlled potential oxidation at +0.88 V vs. SCE. Fig. 2b indicates that the absorption of the Q band at 700 nm steadily diminishes in intensity, the Soret band at 449 nm decreases in intensity with a bathochromic shift, and a new band is formed at 440 nm with an increase in intensity. In contrast, the absorption of the donor imidazole moiety undergoes a hypsochromic shift during controlled potential oxidation. Throughout this process, clear isosbestic points were observed at 445 nm, 560 nm, 640 nm, and 760 nm, which obviously indicate the oxidation forms of a single product. These observed transformations signify the formation of the porphyrin cation radical.39 The porphyrin cationic form does not fully recover to its neutral form when the applied potential is changed to +0.2 V. This might be due to the slight degradation of porphyrin due to the prolonged timescale of the spectroelectrochemical study, as was the case for other porphyrin sensitizers. However, under real-world conditions, the sensitizer stays in an oxidized form for a much shorter time and LG26 certainly shows greater oxidative stability during controlled potential oxidation than well-known Ru(II) polypyridyl complex based sensitizers.40 Similar spectral changes are observed for the LG24, LG25, and LG27 sensitizers (see Fig. S20, ESI†) and even the LG18 sensitizer.25
Quantum mechanical calculations
In order to gain a fundamental understanding of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the LG24–LG27 dyes and compare their properties with the earlier reported LG18 sensitizer, we have conducted theoretical optimization studies, encompassing DFT and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with a basis functional set at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Fig. 3a illustrates the ground-state optimized structures of all four newly designed sensitizers, which comprise donor and acceptor moieties separated by a porphyrin macrocycle through an ethynyl π-bridge. The phenyl rings of the donor triphenylimidazole with one or three methoxy substituents are present perpendicular to the porphyrin macrocycle, resulting in non-planarity being shown by the newly designed sensitizers, as suggested by the optimization studies. Additionally, the long alkyl dodecyloxy chains at the meso-phenyl positions of the porphyrin macrocycle cover the space above and below the porphyrin plane, minimizing the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. Additionally, in all these sensitizers, the heteroaromatic thiophene group present between the BDT moiety and either cyanocarboxylic acid (LG24 and LG26) or rhodanine-3-carboxylic acid (LG25 and LG27) further results in non-planarity.
In Fig. 3b, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were approximated using the B3LYP/6-31(d,p) method in THF solvent to investigate the HOMO and LUMO positions and other electronic properties of the sensitizers. These studies will highlight the effects of both the methoxy groups of the donor moiety and the π-conjugated auxiliary acceptors on the HOMO and LUMO positions. In the case of the LG18 dye and the new dyes, the HOMO levels are delocalized on the triphenylimidazole donor and zinc porphyrin, while the LUMO levels are present on the auxiliary acceptors and anchoring groups, making intramolecular interactions easier. On the other hand, HOMO−1 was delocalized mainly on the donor part and partially on the porphyrin in the cases of LG24 and LG25, whereas in the cases of LG26 and LG27, the electron cloud was mainly distributed over the porphyrin macrocycle. The location of the electron cloud of LUMO+1 is mainly on the porphyrin and partially on the auxiliary acceptor groups in all these sensitizers. In the case of HOMO−2, this is delocalized mainly on the porphyrin for the LG24 and LG25 dyes and on the donor moiety in the cases of the LG26 and LG27 dyes; LUMO+2 is distributed mainly on the auxiliary acceptors and anchoring groups in the LG24 and LG26 sensitizers (Fig. S21, ESI†). The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the present sensitizers in comparison with the LG18 sensitizer were not much affected either upon the introduction of methoxy groups to the triphenylimidazole donor moiety or upon a change in the auxiliary acceptor from cyanoacrylic acid to rhodanine-3-carboxylic acid. Fig. 3a shows the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the sensitizers, and these suggest the existence of positive electrostatic potential at the donor and porphyrin macrocycle, whereas negative potential was generated at the auxiliary acceptor and anchoring group. In addition to this, we also executed TD-DFT studies in order to understand the excited-state transitions, as illustrated in Fig. S19 (ESI†). The acquired results were found to be in harmony with the experimental results (Table S1, ESI†).
Photovoltaic performance
Owing to the favorable optoelectronic properties of the LG24–LG27 dyes, DSSCs were fabricated, and the photovoltaic performances of the respective DSSCs were studied. Fig. 4a shows the IPCE spectra of the LG24–LG27 sensitizers and the LG18 sensitizer in 0.1 M TBP. There is a large gap between the Soret and the Q bands in all these sensitizers, as shown in the solution absorption spectra (Fig. 1a); however, in the IPCE spectra of the respective DSSCs this feature is not noticeable due to light scattering as a result of the TiO2 nanoparticles, improving the photocurrent levels in weak absorption areas. This leads to a merging of all absorption maxima in the absorption area. This leads to the merging of all absorption maxima in all sensitizers, resulting in a broad spectral response. The sensitizers including a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group, i.e., LG24 and LG26, showed IPCE values of 80% and 79%, respectively. On the other hand, the LG25 and LG27 sensitizers possessing a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group showed IPCE values of ∼45%. In all dyes the IPCE onset was extended to 950 nm, which may lead to considerable enhanced PCEs from the respective DSSCs. In comparison, a LG18-based DSSC showed an IPCE value of 82% under similar test cell conditions. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of LG24–LG27 and LG18 sensitizer based DSSCs evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) sunlight. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Of all these DSSCs, high PCEs were observed from LG24 (9.64%) and LG26 (9.87%). The photovoltaic performances were higher when compared to the LG25 and LG27 (5.79% and 5.16%, respectively) sensitizers. By comparison, under similar test cell conditions, the LG18 dye showed a PCE of 10.51%. The lower PCEs of LG25 and LG27 compared to LG18 might be as a result of the presence of the rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group, possibly owing to the non-conjugated structure between the rhodanine ring and carboxylic anchoring group, while porphyrin dyes containing a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group (LG24 and LG26) maintain conjugation.41 Both the LG24 and LG26 dyes with conjugated electron acceptors not only maintain a broad absorption spectrum but they also show improved electronic structures, significantly enhancing the electron injection and lowering charge recombination, as was the case in our prior reports.19,42 On the other hand, the LG18 dye showed better photovoltaic performance than the LG24 and LG26 dyes, probably due to the more negative nature of LUMO; consequently, it has a better Voc than the present sensitizers. Hence, the PCE order is found to be LG24 ≥ LG26 > LG27 ≥ LG25. Upon the introduction of methoxy groups to the phenyl ring of the donor triphenylimidazole, the onset of absorption was extended up to 800 nm; however, the onset of IPCE extended only to 950 nm, as in the case of LG18. As a result, the device efficiency was not further enhanced.

Effects of TBP on efficiency
In addition to this, we have also studied the effects of the TBP concentration in the liquid redox electrolyte on the efficiency of the device. It is well documented in the literature that upon a change in the concentration of TBP in the redox couple, there is an adjustment in the conduction band edge of TiO2, which can affect the Voc of the overall DSSC.22,23 Fig. S22 (ESI†) demonstrates the IPCE spectra of all four sensitizers using 0.1 M, 0.3 M, and 0.5 M concentrations of TBP, and the accompanying data are accessible in Table 3. From Table 3, it is seen that the IPCE decreases for all four sensitizers as the concentration of TBP is increased. Similar negative effects from TBP are also seen in the J–V curves of all four sensitizers (Fig. S23, ESI†), and the data are summarized in Table 3. As the concentration of TBP increases from 0.1 M to 0.5 M, Voc is marginally enhanced while JSC is drastically reduced for all four sensitizers. Therefore, the most favorable concentration of TBP for the present porphyrin sensitizers is 0.1 M.
Co-sensitization
Although the LG26-based DSSC showed the highest PCE, there is still an absorption dip in the IPCE spectrum in the 320–400 nm region. Previously we reported the UV dye Y1 which showed an intense IPCE spectrum in the same region.43 We fabricated a DSSC using Y1 dye and observed a PCE of 3.44% (JSC = 6.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.698 V, FF = 0.750). The Y1-based DSSC showed strong IPCE in the 320–450 nm region (Fig. 5a). We further fabricated a co-sensitized DSSC via mixing an equimolar ratio of dyes (1:1) in solution. The LG26 + Y1-based DSSC showed an improved PCE of 10.45% with photovoltaic parameters of JSC = 21.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.694 V, and FF = 0.71 (Fig. 5b and Table 3). The increased photovoltaic performance of the co-sensitized DSSC is ascribed to the enhanced IPCE in the UV region of the corresponding DSSC, increasing JSC.

CEM and IMVS studies
The electron lifetime (τ) in a DSSC has been highlighted as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of charge recombination, which are associated with the open circuit voltage (Voc) of a DSSC.44–46 To comprehend the discrepancies in the Voc values observed from DSSCs based on LG24, LG25, LG26, LG27, Y1, and LG26 + Y1 dyes, the comparative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes of the respective DSSCs has been evaluated. We measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of a charge extraction method (CEM). As revealed in Fig. 6a, the DSSCs sensitized with the single dyes and the LG26 + Y1 co-sensitized DSSC showed a similar linear increase in terms of electron density vs Voc. This highlights that these DSSCs have similar TiO2 conduction band edges in spite of their various molecular structures or the presence of a co-sensitizer. To further understand the variations of the Voc values of the respective DSSCs, we have measured the electron lifetime (τ) values via intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. Fig. 6b shows the electron lifetime (τ) values of the DSSCs vs. Voc; it can be seen that at a fixed Voc value, the lifetimes increase in the order: Y1> LG26 + Y1> LG24> LG26> LG25> LG27, which is in harmony with the order of increasing Voc for the respective DSSCs.

Transient absorption (TA) study
We can investigate the strength of the overlap of the LG24–LG27 dye anchoring systems (π*-orbitals) with the TiO2 surface (titanium 3d orbitals) via employing transient absorption spectroscopy and studying the charge transfer kinetics between the dye/TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. Transient absorption (TA) measurements have recently become a useful method for studying the kinetics of competitive reactions, including dye regeneration and recombination processes, and they are considered to be a critical step when analyzing the performance of a DSSC.47–50 We have used LP920 apparatus, from Edinburgh, to investigate and compare the kinetics of dye regeneration in the absence and presence of electrolyte for all the above dyes, and to link the findings with the photovoltaic performances. Because of the very poor output signals, we have used a high laser intensity to record adequate transient absorbance signals. As reported by the Grätzel group,48 this should not result in a considerable change in the lifetime decay. The absorption decay lifetimes in the absence of electrolyte (Fig. 7A), in acetonitrile, show half-lives (τ1/2) of 4.74, 3.07, 3.45, and 1.86 μs for LG24–LG27, respectively, implying the existence of an unwanted recombination process between the injected charge in the TiO2 conduction band and the LG24–LG27 oxidative dyes. The absorption decay lifetimes in the presence of electrolyte (Fig. 7B), in acetonitrile, show typical half-lives (τ1/2) of 3.39, 2.82, 2.63, and 1.76 μs for the LG24–LG27 dyes, respectively, indicating the existence of dye regeneration in the electrolyte redox system. The observed decay lifetimes are within the order of rates revealed by Booschloo et al.,49 thus verifying the abilities for dye regeneration in the electrolyte redox system of the above porphyrin dyes and, in addition to this, the good intercalation of the dyes into the TiO2 film pores. Effective solar cell performance is achieved when dye regeneration by the electrolyte (kRG) is faster than the recombination of TiO2 electrons with oxidized dye (kRC).52Table 4 shows the respective rate constants for generation and recombination calculated from the absorbance decay lifetimes.

As Table 4 shows, the poorer-performing dyes LG25 and LG27 show faster recombination decay lifetimes than LG24 and LG26, which means that they show higher rates of unwanted recombination. Upon the addition of electrolyte, the final calculated rate constants of dye regeneration (KRG) of the best-performing dyes LG24 and LG27 are 3 times higher than those of the poorer-performing dyes LG25 and LG27. We assume that dye regeneration is the only difference between devices with and without electrolyte. Usually, rapid dye regeneration involves a high current density being collected at the photoanode if all other parameters, like IPCE, are kept constant. Within the margin of error, the order of the KRG values shown in Table 4 (LG26 > LG24 > LG27 > LG25) is in agreement with the photovoltaic performance data shown in Table 3.
Moreover, based on the energy-level diagrams of the LG24–LG27 porphyrins shown in Fig. 3, all obtained dyes present driving forces more than 0.25 V higher than the I−/I3− redox potential, which is −0.35 V versus NHE. Daeneke et al. have documented that quantitative dye regeneration (theoretical regeneration yield: 99.9%) can be realized with a driving force of 20–25 kJ mol−1 (ΔE ≈ 0.20–0.25 V).51 Thus, a much higher driving force (more than 0.25 V versus vacuum) would not essentially make a difference, since above 0.25 V, dye regeneration is diffusion controlled. Consequently, in light of this information, the dye regeneration lifetimes (within the margin of error) seen in the presence of electrolyte do agree with the driving forces and with the measured Jsc values based on IPCE. Further, the regeneration efficiencies (φreg) for the present class of porphyrin sensitizers using an iodide redox couple are calculated using the following relationship: φreg = kRG/(kRC + kRG)(1)
For all the LG24–LG27 sensitizers using the I−/I3− redox couple, the φreg values are found to be close to 30%, which are very small. It was reported in the literature that upon using the Y123 dye with Cu(II/I), Co(III/II), and I−/I3− redox couples, φreg values are found to be close to 100% based on a 1.1 ms half-life for oxidized dye signal decay.53,54 This means that a relatively high driving force is required for dye regeneration using the I−/I3− redox couple.
Effects of methoxy groups
The introduction of either one or three methoxy groups to the donor triphenylimidazole moiety enhances the HOMO orbital distributions on the donor moiety when compared to the LG18 sensitizer. Thus, charge recombination (τw.o) may be suppressed in the sensitizers LG24 (4.74 μs) and LG25 (3.07 μs) containing three methoxy groups compared with the sensitizers LG26 (3.45 μs) and LG27 (1.86 μs) containing one methoxy group. Further, dye regeneration (τw) was also influenced by the introduction of methoxy groups. Dye regeneration for all the presented sensitizers, LG24–LG27, is slow when compared to LG18 (0.28 μs). On the whole, the introduction of methoxy groups to the donor moiety not only suppresses charge recombination but also the dye regeneration process.
Thermal behavior of the sensitizers
It is essential to study the thermal behavior of a sensitizer, and good thermal behavior is a prerequisite for an organic material that is to be used for photovoltaic applications. Consequently, we have carried our thermogravimetric analysis of all four sensitizers, and the representative thermogram of the LG26 sensitizer is presented in Fig. 8. It is well documented in the literature that tetraphenyl porphyrins and their metallo derivatives are stable up to 400 °C.55 From Fig. 8, it is obvious that the sensitizer is stable up to 200 °C. The early weight loss up to 200 °C (∼10%) is because of the removal of the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid. Comparable thermal behavior was observed for the other sensitizers also (Fig. S24, ESI†).

Conclusions
We have introduced either one or three electron-releasing methoxy groups to the donor triphenyl imidazole moiety in D-π-A-based porphyrin sensitizers to adjust the HOMO–LUMO levels of the sensitizers for DSSC applications. The incorporation of the auxiliary acceptor rhodanine-3-acetic acid redshifted the Q band absorption, and the onset of absorption was increased to 800 nm compared with a corresponding thiophene auxiliary acceptor. DFT studies suggest that the HOMO extends over the donor and porphyrin groups while the LUMO spreads over the porphyrin and acceptor groups, which is favourable for DSSC applications. Device studies suggested that donors having one methoxy group showed better efficiency than the donors with three methoxy groups due to greater stabilization of the LUMO. Similarly, the sensitizer having a thiophene cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group (LG26) showed better device performance (PCE: 9.87%) than the corresponding sensitizer having a rhodanine-3-acetic acid acceptor group (LG27; PCE: 5.94%) because of the non-conjugated structure between the rhodanine ring and the carboxylic anchoring group. Under similar test cell conditions, LG18 showed a PCE of 10.51%. Additionally, the LG26 sensitizer was co-sensitized with a metal-free organic dye (Y1) having absorption in the UV region, and the resulting device had complementary absorption; this was reflected in the IPCE spectrum being particularly enhanced in the UV region and, as a result, the Jsc, Voc, and PCE values were improved to 21.25 mA cm−2, 698 mV, and 10.45% in the LG26 + Y1 device, with a PCE greater than individual devices made using LG26 (9.87%) and Y1 (3.44%). Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and nanosecond transient spectroscopy were used to account for the low efficiencies of the devices compared to a device based on the LG18 dye. Finally, thermal studies suggested that these sensitizers are stable up to 200 °C and have potential for roof-top applications.
