    , Accepted 18th June 2023First published on 20th June 2023AbstractAll-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without hole-transport materials (HTMs) have attracted widespread attention because of their significant environmental stability. However, the poor quality of perovskite film and the energetics mismatch between CsPbBr3 and charge-transport layers limit the further improvement of the CsPbBr3 PSC performance. To solve this issue, the synergistic effect of alkali metal doping and thiocyanate passivation in NaSCN and KSCN dopants is utilized to improve the properties of the CsPbBr3 film. The Na+ and K+ with smaller ionic radii are doped at the A-site of CsPbBr3 to cause a lattice contraction, which contributes to the formation of CsPbBr3 film with enhanced grain size and crystallinity. The SCN− exerts the function of passivating the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects of CsPbBr3 film, leading to a reduction of trap state density. The incorporation of NaSCN and KSCN dopants also adjusts the band structure of CsPbBr3 film to improve the interfacial energetics match of the device. As a result, the charge recombination is suppressed, and the charge transfer and extraction are effectively promoted, delivering a highly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 10.38% for the champion KSCN doped CsPbBr3 PSCs without HTMs compared to 6.72% efficiency for the original device. Moreover, the stability of the unencapsulated PSCs under ambient conditions with high humidity (85% RH, 25 °C) is distinctly improved, retaining 91.1% of the initial efficiency after 30 days of aging.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn vast attention due to their abundant advantages such as excellent light absorption, long carrier lifetime, simple preparation, and rapidly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) that has been improved to 26% from the initial 3.8% in this decade.1–3 Unfortunately, the cutting-edge organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs always suffer from poor stability under external stimuli such as UV light, thermal, moisture, and oxygen,4–6 which tremendously impedes the development of their practicality. Recently, a solution to this impasse has been to replace organic cations (e.g. FA+ and MA+) with inorganic cesium ions (Cs+) to prepare all-inorganic halogenated perovskite light-absorption layers, such as CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3, which exhibit better thermal stability than organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.7,8 Because of the excellent tolerance to the ambient atmosphere with high humidity, CsPbBr3 perovskite film shows a high potential for preparing practical photovoltaic devices.9 However, the PCE of the typical CsPbBr3 PSCs based on carbon electrodes free of hole-transport materials (HTMs) is still far from the ideal efficiency of 16.5%.10 Many works have demonstrated that the poor quality of CsPbBr3 film and the mismatched energy level between CsPbBr3 and charge-transport layer result in severe charge recombination, which is a major adverse factor for the low efficiency of HTM-free CsPbBr3 PSCs.11,12
Recently, the incorporation of dopants into perovskite films has emerged as an effective strategy to achieve high-quality films and tune their energy levels.13,14 For instance, Liu and co-workers systematically investigated the effect of substituting A-site cations of MAPbI3 perovskite with alkali metal ions on solar cell performance, demonstrating that the alkali metal cation dopants induced the crystallization and nucleation processes of perovskite and healed the grain boundaries to improve the properties of MAPbI3 films, thereby enhancing the PCE from 15.56% of the control cell to 18.16%.15 Chen et al. improved the grain quality and energy level matching of the prepared CsPbI3 films by replacing Cs with Na atoms, which increased the PCE of carbon-based CsPbI3 PSCs from 8.6% to 10.7%.16 In addition to alkali metal cations as effective dopants, the introduction of the pseudohalide SCN− can also effectively control the crystallization and passivate the defects to improve perovskite films quality.17 The results reported by Xie et al. showed that the addition of a small amount of lead thiocyanate into the perovskite precursor obviously increased the grain size and crystalline quality of MA/Cs based perovskite films by overcoming the different aggregation affinities of small particles to suppress the formed pinholes, thereby achieving a high PCE of 16.30% with reduced hysteresis.18 Ye and co-workers revealed that SCN− was also effective for fabricating high quality inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskites film with 425 nm thickness and better crystallinity by introducing homogenous nucleation sites, leading to an improved PCE up to 12.22%.19 Inspired by this, it would be an effective strategy to promote the PCE of CsPbBr3 PSCs free of HTMs by incorporating A-bit cations and SCN− to synergistically improve the quality of perovskite films.20
Herein, the compositional engineering of employing NaSCN and KSCN as dopants is utilized to fabricate high quality all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite film by exploiting the synergistic effect of alkali metal cations and thiocyanate anions. On the one hand, the A-site substitution in CsPbBr3 crystal by the Na+ and K+ with smaller ionic radius leads to a shrinkage of the perovskite lattice, which facilitates a large-grained perovskite film formation. On the other hand, the pseudohalide SCN− retains in the perovskite film to passivate the positively charged metal ion defects to improve the quality of the films. In addition, the doping of NaSCN and KSCN also shows a positive effect on the band structure of CsPbBr3 perovskite. As a result, a high quality CsPbBr3 thin film with enlarged grain size, reduced trap state density, and suitable energy level is prepared, which greatly suppresses the charge recombination and prolongs the carrier lifetime. Finally, the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 PSCs without HTMs achieve a conspicuous PCE as high as 9.91% and 10.38%, respectively, which are much higher than the 6.72% efficiency of the original device. Meanwhile, the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs free of encapsulation retains 91.1% of the initial PCE after being attacked in ambient with 85% RH at 25 °C for 30 days, showing an excellent tolerance toward high humidity in air.
2. Experimental section

Potassium thiocyanate (KSCN, AR), sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, AR), cesium bromide (CsBr, AR), lead bromide (PbBr2, AR), anhydrous methanol (CH4O, AR), N-n-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR), isopropyl titanate (C12H28O4Ti, AR), diethanolamine (C4H11NO2, AR), anhydrous ethanol (C2H6O, AR), low temperature carbon paste (MTW-CEC-003, ∼50 wt%).
2.2 Fabrication of HTM-free perovskite solar cells
The FTO glass was etched with HCl (2 M) and zinc powder and then cleaned with deionized water and ethanol twice. The compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was obtained by spin-coating the ethanol solution (0.5 M of titanium acetone and 0.5 M of diethanolamine) on FTO at 7000 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 500 °C for 2 h. The mesoporous TiO2 layer (m-TiO2) was prepared by spin-coating the TiO2 slurry at 2000 rpm for 30 s on the c-TiO2 and calcining at 450 °C for 30 min. After soaking the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 in the 40 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution at 75 °C for 30 min and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min, the electron transport layer was prepared. The CsPbBr3 film was obtained by a multistep spin coating method at ambient. The pre-heated (90 °C, 15 min) electron transport layer was a spin-coated DMF solution of PbBr2 (1 M) with or without different ratios of NaSCN/KSCN at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 90 °C for 30 min to obtain the PbBr2 film. After repeating the spin-coating (2000 rpm, 30 s) of the methanol solution of 0.07 M of CsBr and heat treatment (250 °C, 5 min) 8 times, the CsPbBr3 film was formed. Finally, the carbon back electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was prepared by scraping technique and heating at 90 °C for 30 min.
2.3 Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured by a PHILIPSPW1800 diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed on the PHI-5000CESCA system (Mg-Kα radiation). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained by Cary 680, Agilent spectrometer. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S4800, Hitachi microscope) was used to observe the morphology and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images. The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured by a spectrophotometer (Meipuda UV-3200). The steady-state PL spectrum was detected by a spectrophotometer under excitation of 385 nm wavelength. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) was used to measure the TRPL spectrum under excitation of 510 nm wavelength. The ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) was characterized using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA system with a He(I) (21.22 eV) discharge lamp. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter was used to perform the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (in a voltage range of 0–1.7 V) under irradiation of simulated sunlight (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G, calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell). The electrochemical workstation of CHI660E was used to record the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves under dark conditions in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz at VOC with an amplitude of 10 mV. The dark J–V curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1 from −1.5 to 1.5 V. The IPCE curves were performed by an IPCE suite of Enli Technology Co., Ltd equipped with standard silicon solar cells as a reference. The dark J–V curves of the hole-only devices with an architecture of FTO/NiOX/perovskite film/carbon were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model from 0 to 7 V voltage. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves were recorded under a frequency of 5 kHz and an amplitude of 30 mV in dark.
3. Results and discussion
XRD characterization was performed to explore the doping effect of NaSCN and KSCN on the CsPbBr3 crystal structure, as shown in Fig. S1† and Fig. 1a. The similar characteristic diffraction peaks of α-phase CsPbBr3 appear in all films, indicating that the doping of NaSCN and KSCN does not destroy the perovskite crystalline phase of CsPbBr3. Meanwhile, all films exhibit the characteristic peak of the CsPb2Br5 phase, which is a general occurrence owing to the transformation of α-phase CsPbBr3 to CsPb2Br5 under conditions above 150 °C.21 It is noticeable that the diffraction intensity of doped CsPbBr3 films is obviously higher than that of the pristine one, which illustrates an increased crystallinity of CsPbBr3 films after doping with NaSCN and KSCN. Moreover, the higher diffraction angle positions of (100), (110), and (111) crystal planes for CsPbBr3 films doped with NaSCN and KSCN than that for the pristine one (Fig. 1a) imply the reduction in crystal plane spacing and the contraction of the lattice, which is cross-evidenced by the smaller lattice constant of the doped films (3% NaSCN-CsPbBr3: 5.7538 Å, 5% KSCN-CsPbBr3: 5.7484 Å) compared to 5.7549 Å of the pristine CsPbBr3, as depicted in Fig. 1b. Since the larger ion radius of SCN− (2.15–2.20 Å) than 1.96 Å of Br− makes it impossible for SCN− to substitute Br− in CsPbBr3 lattice,22 and the decrease of lattice constant is mainly attributed to the replacement of Cs+ (1.67 Å) by the smaller K+ (1.38 Å) and Na+ (1.02 Å) ions in CsPbBr3. It has been demonstrated that the lattice contraction contributes to the increase in stability and formation energy of the perovskite phase,23 thereby inhibiting the formation of new nuclei and promoting the growth of original grains, which results in higher crystallinity and larger grain size (as shown in Fig. 2a–c below) of the doped CsPbBr3 films. In addition, the lattice contraction has also been shown to favor the lattice strain release during the formation process of perovskite film to lessen the trap states, thereby improving the quality of perovskite film.24

As the Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d XPS spectra show in Fig. 1c–e, the peak positions of Cs, Pb, and Br elements of the doped films are shifted towards the direction of high binding energy, indicating an increased bonding between elements in the CsPbBr3 perovskite, which is attributed to the successful substitution of small-size alkali metal ion induced lattice shrinkage and redistributed electron cloud density. Moreover, the presence of Na 1s and K 2p peaks in the doped CsPbBr3 films shown in Fig. S2† further confirms the incorporation of Na and K cations. The emergence of the C 1s (Fig. 1f) and S 2p (Fig. S3†) characteristic peaks of CsPbBr3 films doped with NaSCN and KSCN, together with the appearance of the CN characteristic tensile peak at 2062 cm−1 in the doped CsPbBr3 films compared with that of the CsPbBr3 one in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 1g), demonstrates that the SCN− anion still stably remains in the CsPbBr3 film after the annealing process. To evaluate the function of SCN− on CsPbBr3 film, the FTIR spectra of NaSCN and KSCN, and their mixtures with PbBr2 and CsBr, respectively, are recorded, as shown in Fig. S4.† It can be seen that the stretching vibration peak of CN bond for PbBr2 + Na (K) SCN shifts negatively in comparison with that for the pure Na (K) SCN, while there is almost no shift for CsBr + Na (K) SCN samples, demonstrating the strong interaction between SCN− and Pb2+, which can heal the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects to reduce non-radiative recombination.25 In addition, the reduction of undercoordinated metal ion point defects has been indicated to benefit slowing water invasion and inhibiting halide ion migration in perovskite film, potentially improving the stability of PSCs.26 According to the above results, it can be concluded that the doping of NaSCN and KSCN plays a dual role of substituting A-site ion and passivating defects by SCN−, as shown in Fig. 1h, which comprehensively improves the quality of perovskite films.

Fig. 2a–c show the top-view SEM images of the pristine, NaSCN, and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films. Obviously, the doped CsPbBr3 films exhibit a uniformly dense morphology with a larger average grain size (NaSCN doped film: 993 nm, KSCN doped film: 1018 nm) than 723 nm of the pristine one, agreeing well with the analysis result of the XRD patterns. The enlarged grain of the doped CsPbBr3 films can reduce the grain boundary defect states to inhibit the non-radiative recombination to effectively improve the performance of PSCs.27 Meanwhile, the uniform distribution of Cs, Pb, Br from pristine and doped CsPbBr3 films and Na/K, S, C, N elements from the doped CsPbBr3 films shown in the EDS mapping images illustrates the homogeneous incorporation of NaSCN/KSCN in CsPbBr3 films.
As shown in Fig. 2d, the absorbance of the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films is enhanced compared with that of the pristine one, which is attributed to the improved quality of the former doped films and beneficial for a promotion of the JSC output. Moreover, the PL intensity of the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films is 1.5 and 1.75 times that of the original one with a blue-shift, respectively, indicating the lower defect states in the doped perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 2e. Meanwhile, the TRPL spectra of the undoped and doped CsPbBr3 films deposited directly on the glass substrate were characterized to extract the carrier lifetime (τ), as shown in Fig. 2f. Through fitting the TRPL attenuation curve by a double exponential decay function: I = A1e−(τ−τ0)/τ1 + A2e−(τ−τ0)/τ2, where τ1 refers to the fast decay time of defect-dominated single-molecule nonradiative recombination, τ2 refers to the slow decay time of the bimolecular radiative recombination part,28 and the formula: τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2), the average lifetime of the carrier (τave) is obtained and summarized in Table S1.† Obviously, the τave of the doped CsPbBr3 films is significantly increased compared to that of the original one, illustrating the decreased carrier recombination in the former films due to their grain size increase and grain boundary defect passivation. The PL and TRPL results consistently show the reduction of defect states in the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films, which facilitates charge transfer and extraction to improve PSCs performance.
To study the effect of the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films on device performance, the cell with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3-Na(K)SCN/carbon (Fig. 3a) was prepared. Fig. 3b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the assembled cell, in which the monolayer perovskite has large vertical grains and a thickness of 470 nm, which ensures adequate light absorption and rapid charge transport. The energy levels of the doped CsPbBr3 films are obtained by measuring the UPS spectra and Tauc plots, as shown in Fig. S6.† Based on the formula: EVB = hv − (Ecutoff − Eonset), where hv represents the incident photon energy of 21.22 eV, Ecutoff and Eonset are the high binding energy cutoff and the onset of CsPbBr3 films over the Au Fermi energy in the UPS spectra,29 respectively, the valence band (EVB) of the perovskite can be obtained. By subtracting the Eg from the EVB, the conduction band (ECB) can be extracted. Fig. 3c describes the measured energy levels of various CsPbBr3 films, in which the energy levels of the pristine CsPbBr3 film are based on our previous work.30 After doping NaSCN and KSCN, the EVB of CsPbBr3 films is up-shifted compared to that of the undoped film, possibly owing to the electron rearrangement in the doped films, which reduces the energy barrier for hole transfer from CsPbBr3 to the carbon electrode, leading to a promotion of hole extraction and a decrease of energy loss. Besides, the upshift of ECB for the doped CsPbBr3 films offers a larger driving force to improve electron transfer and extraction and a higher barrier to block electron reflux,31 which also helps to facilitate the charge separation and extraction to enhance device performance.

The optimization of the molar ratio of NaSCN and KSCN doped in CsPbBr3 was investigated by the J–V testing of the corresponding devices, as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2, and S3.† The device performance shows a declining trend when the doping molar ratio of NaSCN and KSCN is too high, probably due to the negative effect of excessive dopants on the perovskite crystal structure.16 The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the champion HTM-free PSCs are shown in Fig. 3d and Table 1, respectively. Compared to the PCE of 6.72% (JSC of 6.75 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.446 V, and FF of 68.88%) of the original PSC, the efficiency of the NaSCN and KSCN doped devices is significantly enhanced to 9.91% (a JSC of 7.61 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.621 V, a FF of 80.35%) and 10.38% (a JSC of 7.74 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.624 V, a FF of 82.57%), respectively. The larger grain size, the higher crystallinity, and the more suitable energy level of KSCN doped CsPbBr3 film-induced improved charge extraction endows a champion efficiency of 10.03% with a weaker hysteresis effect (Fig. S8†) of the device, which is a cutting-edge PCE for CsPbBr3 PSCs (Table S4†). In addition, the integrated JSC (pristine: 6.34 mA cm−2, with NaSCN: 7.45 mA cm−2, with KSCN: 7.59 mA cm−2) from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 3e) and the steady-state output current and efficiency values (Table S5†) at the voltage of the maximum power point (Fig. 3f) are consistent with that of the J–V curves, verifying the high validity of the performance increase of the PSCs with NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films. Fig. S9† summarizes the PCE distribution of the undoped and NaSCN and KSCN doped cells. The PCE of the doped devices is higher than that of the undoped PSC with a narrow distribution, demonstrating the good repeatability of the device fabrication and the high reliability of the photovoltaic performance enhancement of the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs.

To evaluate the carrier recombination behavior in the CsPbBr3 PSCs, the relationship between JSC and VOC and light intensity (I) were measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, the obtained α (a factor related to radiative recombination) values by following the formula JSC ∝ Iα of the NaSCN and KSCN doped, the original CsPbBr3 PSCs are 0.987 and 0.997, 0.963, respectively, indicating the decrease in radiative recombination in the former doped PSCs.32 This is mainly attributed to the regulated energy levels at the interface of the charge transport layer and CsPbBr3 layer induced boosted charge transfer and extraction. Moreover, the factor (n) related to the non-radiative recombination can be extracted by the formula VOC = nkTln(I)/q + constant,29 where k, T, and q stand for Boltzmann constant, thermodynamic temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the value of n decreases from 1.84 for the original CsPbBr3 PSC to 1.64 and 1.55 for the NaSCN and KSCN doped devices, respectively, which illustrates that the non-radiative recombination in the latter devices is effectively suppressed. The grain size increase and the uncoordinated Pb2+ passivation of the doped CsPbBr3 films inducing the defect state reduction are responsible for this decreased non-radiative recombination.

To quantitatively study the defect state density in the CsPbBr3 films, the dark J–V curves of the devices without an electron transport layer were tested to obtain the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) based on the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. 4c. The defect state density is calculated by the formula ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where L, ε, ε0 and e are the thickness of the perovskite films, relative dielectric constant of CsPbBr3, vacuum permittivity, and the elementary charge, respectively.32 From Table S6,† it can be seen that the ntrap is reduced from 4.596 × 1014 cm−3 for the pristine CsPbBr3 film to 2.364 × 1014 cm−3 for NaSCN doped film and 2.064 × 1014 cm−3 for KSCN doped one, according well with the results of VOC–I, which is conducive to suppress charge recombination. The lower leakage current density of the devices doped with KSCN and NaSCN than that of the original PSC (Fig. 4d) further confirms the decrease of defect state density in the doped CsPbBr3 films and the suppression of carrier recombination.
The Mott–Schottky curves of different devices were further detected to examine the behavior of charge recombination and transport, as shown in Fig. 4e. The doped CsPbBr3 PSCs show a significantly increased built-in potential (Vbi) and slope compared to that of the original device, indicating a larger driving force for charge separation and transport and a lower interfacial charge accumulation in the former PSCs due to the matched interface energy level.33 This result again validates the reduction of charge recombination in the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs. Fig. 4f shows the EIS to investigate the kinetics of charge transport in the CsPbBr3 PSCs. According to the inserted equivalent circuit diagram, the Nyquist plots were fitted to obtain the series resistance (Rs) and the charge recombination resistance (Rrec),34 as summarized in Table S7.† The lower Rs and the higher Rrec of the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs than those of the original device indicate an increased charge transport and a decreased charge recombination in the former PSCs, which is due to the high quality and suitable energy level of the doped CsPbBr3 films. Based on the above analysis, the inhibited radiative and non-radiative recombination originating from the large grains, defect passivation, and energy level matching of NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films contributes to the device performance improvement.
The long-term stability is another important indicator to evaluate the practicability of PSCs besides PCE. As shown in Fig. 5a, the long-term stability of the original and doped CsPbBr3 PSCs free of encapsulation in the air with high humidity of 85% RH at 25 °C is recorded over 30 days. It is notable that the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs maintain nearly 90.4% (NaSCN) and 91.1% (KSCN) of the initial PCE after 30 days of storage, which are much higher than the 81.2% retention rate for the original PSC. The effectively improved humidity tolerance of the doped CsPbBr3 PSCs mainly results from the suppression of moisture invasion caused by the fewer grain boundaries and trap states of the NaSCN and KSCN doped CsPbBr3 films, which is demonstrated by the higher contact angle of NaSCN (53.46°) and KSCN (55.81°) doped films than 43.39° of the pristine one (Fig. 5b).

4. Conclusions
To sum up, the multifunctional dopants of NaSCN and KSCN are employed to regulate the quality and band structure of perovskite films to enhance the efficiency and long-term stability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs without HTMs. Attributing to the lattice contraction after the substitution of CsPbBr3 by Na+ and K+ with a smaller ionic radius and the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ by SCN−, a large-grained CsPbBr3 film with reduced crystal boundaries and trap state defects is prepared, which leads to a reduced charge recombination and moisture invasion. Moreover, the transfer and extraction of carriers are further boosted because of the optimized interfacial energy level matching induced by the doped CsPbBr3 films. As a result, the KSCN doped CsPbBr3 PSC free of HTMs acquired a champion PCE of 10.38% with maintaining over 91.1% of the initial efficiency after aging 30 days under high humidity conditions in ambient, which exhibits an obvious improvement of PCE and stability compared to that of the original device (6.72% efficiency and 81.3% retention rate). This work provides a promising doping strategy to simultaneously enlarge perovskite film grain size and passivate trap states to fabricate high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
