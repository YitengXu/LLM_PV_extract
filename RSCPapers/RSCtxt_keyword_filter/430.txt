    , Accepted 20th November 2013First published on 21st November 2013AbstractA composite catalyst of rosin carbon/Fe3O4 with marvellous morphology was synthesized and applied as a counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), demonstrating notable electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. Based on this CE, a high power conversion efficiency of 8.11% was achieved, comparable to that of the traditional Pt CE.
Since the breakthrough achieved by M. Grätzel and his co-workers in 1991,1,2 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), one of the new concept photovoltaic devices, have been intensively studied by global researchers for solving the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Over the past two decades, after large amounts of effort, DSCs have shown high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 15.0%,3 illustrating a splendid future for their practical applications. Typically, DSCs are mainly composed of a photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE), a key component responsible for collecting electrons from the external circuit to reduce the redox couple within the electrolyte. As we know, the CE of a DSC is usually fabricated with Pt,1,2,4,5 an expensive and rare element that has become one disadvantage in terms of cost-reduction.
Up to now, some organic functional polymers6–8 and inorganic nanomaterials9–21 have been used as alternatives to Pt. Meanwhile, carbon materials, such as carbon black, activated carbon, graphite, conductive carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers and fullerene, have also been proved to be good CE candidates with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability.22 Biomass materials, either from plants or from animals, can supply abundant and various carbon materials, and are more cost-effective when compared with those made by artificial synthesis.23 On the other hand, of the various oxide catalysts, iron oxides are common, abundant, and have exhibited excellent performances as catalysts and electrodes in secondary batteries, as well as biomedicine targeted agents.24–26 Thus, research on how to rationally and efficiently utilize these inexpensive, stable and abundant materials are undoubtedly of great significance.
Herein, a composite catalyst composed of the biomass material rosin carbon and Fe3O4 was synthesized and successfully applied as a CE for DSCs. Aside from the peculiar micro/nano structure, more importantly the composite catalyst exhibited good electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− into I−. DSCs using this composite catalyst as the CE achieved a high PCE of 8.11%, nearly approaching that based on traditional Pt CE.
Briefly, rosin carbon/Fe3O4 composite was prepared according to Scheme 1. Typically, 2 g rosin from a common plant, cedar, was dissolved into 10 mL ethanol. At room temperature, another 10 mL water solution with 4 g Fe2SO4·7H2O was added into the former with stirring. In step 1, the solution was concentrated through volatilizing ethanol at 70 °C. After step 2, water was eliminated by volatilization at 140 °C and meanwhile iron ions were also precipitated together with rosin. In step 3, the obtained precipitant was sintered at 800 °C under N2 atmosphere. In addition, for comparison, rosin carbon and pure Fe3O4 were prepared by directly sintering under the same conditions. For convenience, samples of rosin carbon, rosin carbon/Fe3O4 and pure Fe3O4 were named A, B and C, and the CEs derived from them were named CE-A, CE-B and CE-C, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Schematic formation of rosin carbon/Fe3O4 composite. 
From the SEM image shown in Fig. 1a, we can see that the morphology of sample A, the pure rosin carbon, is composed of micron-sized irregular bulks. For the composite sample B, however, the morphology demonstrated in Fig. 1b is peculiar, like a broken watermelon in which the peel is rosin carbon and the attached porous “pulp” is the iron compound, respectively. Fig. 1c shows the worm-like structure of pure Fe3O4 due to the fusion of particles at high temperature. It is clear to see that sample B is derived from the combination of samples A and C. The XRD patterns of these three samples in Fig. 1d indicate that rosin carbon in sample A is amorphous carbon,22 while the iron compound in sample B is Fe3O4 since all peaks can be well assigned according to JCPDS, and pure Fe3O4 is also identified in sample C. Detailed peak assignments are summarized in ESI.† Based on the above results, it can be said that, via our synthetic approach, Fe3O4 can be well composited with carbon.

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of the DSCs based on CE-A, CE-B, CE-C and sputtered Pt at 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination. Photovoltaic parameters derived from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. We can see that the DSCs based on CE-B gave a PCE of 8.11%, nearly approaching that of 8.37% based on sputtered Pt. Comparing the photovoltaic parameters of DSCs based on CE-A, CE-B and CE-C, the PCE increased from 6.61% to 8.11%. The CE-B composited with A and C shows a superior PCE than CE-A and CE-C. The increased Jsc and FF should be responsible for this change. The results indicate that the composition of rosin carbon and Fe3O4 improved the performance of the CE remarkably. The conductivity of rosin carbon and fast charge transfer of Fe3O4 occurring between Fe2+ and Fe3+ should be responsible for these results.27

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization are common electrochemical methods and also used to reveal the inherent relationship between performance and materials in DSCs.

Fig. 2b presents the cyclic voltammograms of the I−/I3− redox couple based on CE-A, CE-B, CE-C and sputtered Pt. All three curves exhibit two pairs of redox peaks. The left redox peak can be assigned to the reaction shown in eqn (1). I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1)Obviously, it is what we should focus on since it reflects the real working status in DSCs by the reduction of I3− into I−. The cathodic and anodic peak current densities of CE-B are much higher than those of CE-A, CE-C and sputtered Pt, suggesting the higher catalytic activity of CE-B than of CE-A, CE-C and sputtered Pt. In addition, the value of peak to peak separation (Epp) is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction, which is an important parameter for comparing the catalytic activities of different CEs.13,19 The Epp value for CE-B (170 mV) is smaller than that for CE-A (256 mV), CE-C (219 mV) and sputtered Pt (226 mV), further confirming that CE-B is a superior catalyst for the reduction of I3− to I−. Therefore, CE-B is expected to be an alternative to expensive Pt in DSCs as a promising catalytic material for CEs.
EIS measurements were employed to further reveal the electrochemical behavior within the system composed of CE and electrolyte that were involved in symmetrical cells constructed by two identical CEs (CE/electrolyte/CE).28,29Fig. 2c shows Nyquist plots. Typically, there are two semicircles, which are defined as the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface (left semicircle) and the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple in the electrolyte (right semicircle). On the other hand, the high frequency intercept on the real axis shows the series resistance (Rs). The fitting data are summarized in Table 1. In good accordance with the CV test, the electrocatalytic activity of CE-B is superior because its Rct of 1.09 Ω cm2 is smaller than that of 1.65 Ω cm2 for CE-A and 2.27 Ω cm2 for CE-C. Therefore, CE-B is more efficient in terms of the catalytic reduction reaction from I3− to I− at the CE/electrolyte interface. Another item, ZN, should also be taken into account when evaluating a nanostructured catalytic material in the DSC system. As can be seen from Table 1, the ZN for CE-B (0.88 Ω cm2) is largely reduced when compared with that of CE-A (3.41 Ω cm2) and CE-C (2.41 Ω cm2). It means that diffusion of I3−/I− in the system of CE-B/electrolyte is more fluent than that in CE-A/electrolyte and CE-C/electrolyte. Fig. 2d shows the Tafel polarization curves. They show the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of voltage. Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into 3 zones. The curve at low potential curve (|U| ≤ 120 mV) is attributed to the polarization zone, the curve at the middle potential is attributed to the Tafel zone, and the curve at high potential (horizontal part) is attributed to the diffusion zone. We can obtain information on the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) at the middle and high potentials, which are closely connected with the catalytic activity of the catalysts. Comparing the curves for CE-A, CE-B and CE-C, the CE-B curve shows a larger slope in the Tafel zone, indicating the occurrence of a large exchange current density on the electrode surfaces. This implies that the higher catalytic activity was achieved by CE-B, which was similar to that of sputtered Pt. Furthermore, the J0 can be expressed as shown in eqn (2). Rct just can be obtained from the EIS measurements. R, T, n, and F are constants. J0 varies inversely with Rct. We can clearly see that the change tendency of J0 on the surfaces of CEs is in agreement with the results obtained from the EIS curve plots. The Jlim is determined by the diffusion of the redox couple in the electrolyte. In the diffusion zone, CE-B and sputtered Pt show higher Jlim than that of CE-A and CE-C, as demonstrated in eqn (3). A larger diffusion coefficient D was obtained, proving that CE-B holds a large diffusion velocity of the redox couple in the electrolyte. (2) (3)where l is the spacer thickness, NA is the Avogadro constant; and D, c, e and n have their usual meanings.
In summary, the composite material of rosin carbon/Fe3O4 was synthesized and applied in DSCs as an effective alternative CE candidate to traditional Pt. The composite material showed marvellous morphology and good catalytic performance for the reduction of I3−. The high PCE of 8.11% was successfully achieved by rosin carbon/Fe3O4 CE, and is superior to pure rosin carbon CE (7.0%) and pure Fe3O4 CE (6.61%) and comparable to the traditional sputtered Pt CE (8.37%). The composite material combined with natural biomass materials and iron oxide in this work provides a promising strategy to replace the traditional noble Pt, achieve high-efficiency DSCs, as well as reduce the production cost.
