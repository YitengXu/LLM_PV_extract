Accordingly, harvesting renewable and clean solar energy has been demonstrated as an effective approach to solve this critical issue. Among the various photovoltaic (PV) technologies, solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted worldwide interest as inexpensive renewable power sources. This promising technology is favored due to its advantages including low-cost, lightweight, and potential for large-area device fabrication on flexible substrates through roll-to-roll techniques. In the last five years, the power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells have rapidly increased from 10% to nearly 20%. However, despite this rapid progress, complicated procedures are required for the preparation of the photoactive layer and the long-term stability of the current OSCs still requires further research and development. In this case, through rational synthetic protocols, block copolymers (BCPs) effectively connect organic segments, further minimizing the procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive inks and significantly enhancing the morphological stability. Consequently, the study of single-material OSCs based on BCPs has led to enhanced stability and a deeper understanding of the active layer. In this review article, we show how the development of functional organic BCP semiconductors has gained prominence for single-material OSCs, the rapid progress in efficiency to over 15%, and finally the next steps in BCP design, processing, and device architecture to further provide a suitable platform for accelerating OSCs to solve the big energy challenges.

Broader context
Block copolymers (BCPs) have been regarded as promising materials for the fabrication of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices due to their unique properties such as self-assembly characteristics to obtain multi-function. In addition, BCP materials offer an advantage in minimizing procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive ink and photoactive layers, and their remarkably stable morphology provides a solution to solve the instability issue in the field of OPV. Around 2017, a new generation of all-conjugated BCP single-materials organic solar cells (SMOSCs) has emerged and brought unique opportunities for obtaining higher power conversion efficiency of over 15%. We believe there it is urgent to propel this emerging technology. In this review, we presented an in-depth discussion on the progress in both BCP materials and SMOSCs, highlighting the unique application potential of BCP SMOSCs, which will offer a suitable platform for accelerating OPV to solve big energy challenges.

1. Introduction
To overcome the increasing global energy problem, green and renewable sources are considered the most feasible solutions.1,2 Among the renewable energy resources, photovoltaic (PV) technology, which converts light energy directly into electricity, is one of the most efficient and convenient strategies.3 Currently, first- and second-generation solar cells based on silicon and inorganic thin-films dominate the solar cell industry due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability.3–6 However, a complicated fabrication process is required to obtain a high-quality inorganic active layer. Since 1990, third-generation PV technology has provided a more efficient low-temperature solution process.7–10 During the past 30 years, the development of solution-processable semiconductors such as organics, inorganic nanocrystals, and emerging metal halide perovskites has triggered intense interest in next-generation PVs.11–23 The most investigated candidate in this family, organic semiconductors, display unique advantages of semi-transparency, flexibility, light weight, and simple fabrication.24–31 Moreover, their greater synthetic flexibility allows for wide tunability of their bandgap, energy levels, and charge carrier mobility, offering great potential in the design of efficient optoelectronic devices.32 Inspired by Heeger and co-workers, a sandwich-type structure that contains a donor:acceptor (D:A) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend is employed in high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs).7 In the conventional BHJ active layers, the electron donor is normally a conjugated molecule or polymer and the electron acceptor is a fullerene derivative. Due to the inefficient absorption and fixed chemical structure in fullerene derivatives, researchers have proven that the development of non-fullerene conjugated molecular or polymer acceptors can achieve a wider absorption than fullerenes in the long wavelength region.12 It is easy to adjust the chemical structure of non-fullerene acceptors to tune their optical and electrical properties to match that of the donor materials.12,33,34 Before 2015, non-fullerene-based OSCs were significantly overlooked because of their relatively low PCE of around 10%.11,13 However, recently, they have been proven to be exceptional and have spurred huge worldwide research efforts to explore the unknown properties of the ‘‘magic’’ acceptor material. The PCEs of binary and ternary component systems have been increased from 10% to almost 20% in single-junction solar cell devices during the past decade, which can be mainly attributed to the development of narrow-bandgap non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) such as Y6.12,14,33,35,36
The typical BHJ OSC was fabricated with the device structure shown in Fig. 1a. In general, the OSC consists of an ITO transport electrode, two interfacial layers (electron and hole transporting layers), organic photoactive layer, and top metal electrode. Several previous studies have indicated that the organic photoactive BHJ blend should be an interpenetrating network of donor and acceptor domains to provide effective percolation pathways to the cathode and anode.7,14,37 Besides, the device can be generally divided into conventional and inverted structures based on the position of the two interfacial layers.38,39 As shown in Fig. 1b, the working mechanism of a typical BHJ OSC can be generally described as follows: firstly, excitons are generated through photoexcitation, which are electron–hole pairs bonded by Coulomb force.40–42 The dissociation of excitons only occurs at the D:A interface, and thus free charge carriers can be released, which will generate a photocurrent when moving along the electric field. Due to the relatively low dielectric constant of the active materials in OSCs, the photoexcited Frenkel excitons are bound by a strong binding energy.43 The energy level offset at the D:A interface generates a sufficiently large driving force for exciton dissociation. Nevertheless, the performance of BHJ OSCs tends to degrade under thermal and light stress, and thus it is still challenging to obtain BHJ OSCs with good long-term stability.44–49 The degree of the performance degradation of OSCs depends on the stability of the conjugated materials in the photoactive layer, interfacial layers, and electrodes.39,40,50–52 As confirmed by previous reports, after a long operation time, the D:A components tend to convert into a thermodynamically stable microstructure, typically consisting of large-scale self-aggregated domains, which are detrimental to charge generation, and hence limit the stability of OSCs.48,53 A straightforward approach to prevent self-aggregation in two-component systems is to covalently link donor and acceptor units into one molecule. This approach is used for constructing the so-called “single-material OSCs” (SMOSCs).

Initially, single-material organic photoactive layers have shown significantly enhanced stability relative to BHJ systems based on both polymer/small molecules and polymer/polymer systems.54,55 In addition, SMOSCs can minimize the procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive ink and a more uniform photoactive layer, which is favorable for developing large-area solar modules. In the early stages of the development of SMOSCs, pristine conjugated materials without any intramolecular heterojunction structures were adopted to fabricate the device. However, the PCEs of these SMOSCs were extremely low (below 0.1%), suggesting that the dissociation of photoexcited Frenkel excitons is inefficient due to their stronger binding energy in neat conjugated materials.56,57 As shown in Fig. 2, with the development of the BHJ concept, materials with covalently linked electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups started to attract increasing synthetic attention, and functional materials such as block copolymers (BCPs), double-cable polymers, and small molecular dyads were designed and successfully prepared for SMOSCs.58–60 Before 2020, there was no SMOSC with a PCE exceeding 8%.61 In 2021, the PV efficiency of BCP-based SMOSCs achieved an efficiency of over 10%, which was recently improved to 15%, demonstrating their great potential.58,62,63 It should be noted that the working mechanism of BCP SMOSCs is slightly different compared to the typical BHJ OSCs. Due to the chemical connections between the donor and acceptor blocks, there is possible intra-chain charge separation and transport in BCPs, which has been observed via transient absorption spectroscopy.64 In this case, BCP SMOSCs exhibit great potential to further enhance the exciton dissociation and promote the carrier transport towards higher photo-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Herein, we highlight the unique potential of BCP SMOSCs, ranging from material synthesis to device functions. Furthermore, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and present opportunities in BCP SMOSC research and the related current and future pursuits in BCP materials design and device architecture.

2. Fundamentals and progress of SMOSCs
2.1 Classification of SMOSCs
During the past two decades, different types of organic semiconducting materials have been reported for applications in high-performance SMOSCs.65–68 As shown in Fig. 2, depending on their molecular structure, these functional organic semiconductors can be generally divided into polymeric and molecular materials.69 Among the reported polymeric materials, there are two mainstream molecular structures designed for SMOSCs. One is BCPs, where the donor and acceptor segments are loaded on separate functional blocks.65,70–73 Inter- and intra-molecular charge transfer can be obtained in these BCPs. The other is double-cable polymers, which consist of a fully conjugated donor backbone where the acceptor segments are attached to the backbone via flexible spacers.66 Here, only inter-molecular charge transfer can be achieved. Similar to polymer-based SMOSCs, molecule-based SMOSCs can be classified into two groups. In the first case, similar to BCPs, the donor and acceptor segments are connected via conjugated bonds in small molecule homojunction. The other type is molecular dyads and triads, where the flexible chains are used to link the donor and acceptor segments (e.g., fullerene derivatives). Before 2017, SMOSCs were widely overlooked as viable PV contenders because of their poor charge transport, but BCP and double-cable polymers have now proven to be the exception and spurred increasing research efforts to explore efficient and stable organic PV devices with reduced costs.58,59,74
2.2 Advantages of BCP SMOSCs
In the early stages of development, BCPs were reported to achieve a nanoscale controllable morphology.75,76 This is critical given that the interface and phase separation of the D:A junction is crucial for exciton dissociation, charge transfer, carrier transport, and overall PV efficiency.38,41 As shown in Fig. 3a, the ideal morphology for conventional BHJ OSCs is a hairpin-like structure with a desired nanoscale donor and acceptor phase separation of 10–20 nm.77 This configuration can provide sufficient interfaces for exciton dissociation and continuous channels for charge transport. Nevertheless, this type of hairpin-shaped structure cannot be easily obtained through solution processing techniques. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the blend morphology of the organic active layer is a key factor in determining the performance of BHJ OSCs.14,78–81 Besides, the optimized morphology in BHJ OSCs is in a thermodynamically metastable state and the donor and acceptor phases are physically mixed and tend to separate into more pure phases under thermal or lighting stresses.82–84 A change in the microstructure morphology will cause degradation of both efficiency and stability.47,48 Thus, BCP SMOSCs were designed and developed to overcome this critical issue. In BCPs, a functionalized donor block is chemically linked to a functionalized acceptor block. BCPs are anticipated to self-assemble into ordered microstructures and maintain a relatively stable morphology. In this case, ideal geometries with appropriate nanoscales can be generated, which can be further optimized by rational molecular design. More importantly, benefiting from the chemically bonded donor and acceptor blocks, the phase separation between the donor and acceptor under varying external environments can be inhibited in BCP films compared to that in the physically mixed BHJ-based architecture. Accordingly, several previous reports proved that the long-term stability of BCP SMOSCs is significantly improved in comparison with that of BHJ OSCs (Fig. 3b and c).55,58,63,85–87

Besides enhanced stability, the procedures for the fabrication of BCP SMOSCs are also much simpler.88 Plenty of time and materials are required for the optimization of BHJ devices, increasing the cost of their fabrication. In contrast, the D:A ratio can be fixed during the synthesis process to avoid complicated regulation of the D:A ratio. A uniform and ready-to-coat organic conductive BCP ink can be directly prepared to fabricate the photoactive layer. This significantly improves the reproducibility, which is important for large-area devices. Additionally, most of the high-efficiency BHJ OSCs were fabricated using chloroform or chlorobenzene.14,35,89,90 However, these halogen-containing solvents are harmful to human beings and the environment, making them unsuitable for use in commercial products. Encouragingly, the sensitivity of BCPs to solvents is lower than that of the D:A blend. Recent studies have demonstrated the great promise of non-halogenated solvent-based BCP SMOSCs, which have achieved higher efficiencies than that based on chloroform.62 BCP SMOSCs are being investigated due to their advantage in minimizing procedures for preparing conductive ink and photoactive layers, as well as more controllable and remarkably stable morphology. Thus, it will be interesting to see what other fundamental advantages may be possible with this interesting and promising material system.
2.3 Summary of BCP SMOSCs
BCP SMOSCs were initially developed in the beginning of the 2000s with extremely low PCEs of less than 0.01%, explaining their lack of research interest.57,91 However, due to the great efforts from synthetic chemists and the recent integration of non-fullerene acceptors, interest in BCP SMOSCs has been increasing recently. As shown in Fig. 4, BCPs used in efficient SMOSCs can be classified into three main generations according to their chemical structure and order of development. The first-generation BCPs are composed of a flexible backbone with donor and acceptor blocks attached as substituent groups. However, due to their inefficient exciton dissociation and poor charge transport, these materials exhibit a relatively low short current density with a best-recorded PCE of less than 0.5%, which lags significantly behind BHJ devices.76 The second-generation BCPs first appeared in 2009, which contain a partially conjugated backbone (usually acts as the donor block) with the acceptor block attached to the other part of the backbone.92 The exciton dissociation and charge transport were enhanced due to the modified structure and improved BCP film morphology, leading to an improved PCE approaching 2%.54 This molecular design made it possible to prepare BCP films with an enhanced donor and acceptor interaction. However, it is still challenging to construct efficient donor and acceptor channels for better charge carrier dynamics. For over a decade, the performance of SMOSCs lagged significantly behind that of BHJ OSCs. However, in the past five years, third-generation BCPs with a fully conjugated backbone structure have attracted significant research attention. Quite unexpectedly, the all-conjugated BCPs have boosted the PCE of SMOSCs from around 3% to over 15%, displaying their significant potential for practical applications.55,58,63,65,86,87

Fig. 4 presents a summarize of the representative polymers of each generation of BCP SMOSCs during the past 20 years. In 2001, Deboer et al. demonstrated the first BCP optoelectronic devices, which achieved a PCE of 6.9 × 10−4%.91 The low PCE was due to the weak absorption of the PPV (poly(p-phenylene vinylene)) block in the visible light region and its poor conductivity. In 2003, two D:A copolymers were synthesized by Neuteboom et al., but unfortunately, they exhibited severe charge recombination and poor transport with a low PCE of 0.003%.57 In 2006, Lindner et al. developed first-generation BCP SMOSCs with a PCE of 0.07%.93 Afterward, they reported three similar BCPs with side-chain optimization and achieved an enhanced PCE of 0.323%.76,94 In 2009, Tao et al. introduced the P3HT block in BCP, creating the first second-generation BCP SMOSCs.92 Taking advantage of the strong absorption of the P3HT block, the photocurrent was significantly improved and a higher PCE of 0.49% was achieved. Further, the PCE was significantly improved to 1.7% due to the introduction of fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor.54 In 2013, Guo et al. opened the door for third-generation BCP SMOSCs.65 Here, a fully conjugated backbone was used to facilitate charge transport and a relatively high PCE of over 3.0% was reported for the first time. In 2019, Chang et al. reported a facile one-pot method for the synthesis of fully conjugated BCP. With the new synthesis method and precise post optimization, a remarkable PCE of 5.28% was obtained.95 In 2021, our group and Wu et al. introduced the non-fullerene Y6 building blocks in BCPs and high PCEs of 8.64% and 11.32% were attained due to the narrow bandgap acceptor block PTY6/PYT, respectively.63,87 Recently, Wu et al. have achieved a record PCE of 15.55% with the two-pot synthesized PM6-b-PYIT BCP.58
3. The development and progress of BCP SMOSCs
3.1 The embryonic stage of BCP SMOSCs
Phase separation is a critical issue in BHJ OSCs to achieve high efficiencies. Thus, numerous strategies such as molecular structure engineering, ternary strategy, additive engineering, and annealing post-treatment have been developed to achieve the optimized phase separation and performance.14,34,79–81,96–104 However, a change in the phase separation between the donor and acceptor polymers is inevitable under stress due to the physically mixed properties of the D:A blend. Consequently, BCP SMOSCs emerged to provide a solution for these issues. In 2001, Boer et al. reported the first PV device adopting a BCP architecture.91 In this work, a BCP named PPV-b-P(S-stat-C60MS) was synthesized (Scheme 1), which consists of a rod-coil BCP, PPV as the donor material, and P(S-stat-C60MS) as the acceptor material. The aggregation in solution, self-organization in film, and PV properties of PPV-b-P(S-stat-C60MS) were systematically studied. As an efficient PV material, PPV-b-P(S-stat-C60MS) was designed to satisfy two basic requirements, as follows: (1) constructing proper D:A interfaces for excitons to dissociate into separate charge carriers and transfer to electrodes quickly, therefore suppressing other forms of decay such as luminescence. (2) Supplying accessible pathways for the transfer of holes (PPV) and electrons (C60) to avoid charge carrier recombination. A conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BCP/Al was applied to fabricate PV devices, where the active layer his PPV-b-P(S-stat-C60MS) or a blend of PPV and P(S-stat-C60MS), which contains an equal amount of PPV and C60 in the composite. Comparable Voc (0.40 V and 0.52 V) and fill factors (FF, 0.28 and 0.23) were observed for the blend and BCP-based OSCs, respectively, under monochromatic illumination of 1 mW cm−2 at 458 nm. The Jsc was significantly improved (from 0.15 μA cm2 to 5.8 μA cm2) for the BCP-based devices compared to the blend-based devices. The improved Jsc is attributed to the finer scale of phase separation in the BCP film, which is beneficial for charge dissociation and transfer. However, the Jsc is still relatively low, resulting in a negligible PCE (Table 1).

The use of conjugated polymers in SMOSCs was further attempted, as shown in Scheme 1. Neuteboom et al. synthesized two similar D:A copolymers (P1 and P2) via the Suzuki reaction for SMOSCs, which is also one of the prototypes of BCP SMOSCs.57 Both P1 and P2 are composed of commutative perylene bisimide (PERY) acceptor and oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) donor. The difference between the two copolymers is that the linker connects the donor and acceptor. In the P1 and P2 films, the geminate recombination rates were fast and only a small proportion of charges could diffuse. PV devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2/LiF/Al were fabricated, as shown in Table 1. Consequently, a relatively high Voc was observed but the Jsc and FF remained extremely low. The low currents were caused by two factors, as follows: (1) high geminate recombination rate and ratio (more than 80% recombination in the first nanosecond). (2) In polymer films, alternating stacks caused by the face-to-face packing of PERY and OPV segments lead to poor transport properties. Due to the nature of the D:A alternating structure in copolymers, a pure region of donor or acceptor cannot be formed. This is problematic because these regions are responsible for supplying the channels for charge transport from the D:A interfaces to electrodes. Many D:A copolymers have been used to fabricate SMOSCs but all of them demonstrated poor PCEs. Mikroyannidis et al. developed a PERY-based copolymer P, where a device structure of ITO/P/Al was fabricated to investigate the J–V characteristics of P.105 Similar to P1 and P2, the PV device exhibited a high Voc, low Jsc, and low FF. Another PERY-based copolymer PERY-PPV was reported by Liu et al.56 Compared to the previous three PERY-based copolymers, an improved PCE was observed from SMOSC based on PERY-PPV, which is not only attributed to the significantly improved Jsc but also the reduction in Voc. The transfer of connection sites from the nitrogen atoms to bay positions of PERY enhanced the solubility of the copolymer and quenched the fluorescence, leading to an improved current. Since then, many approaches have been attempted using D:A copolymers to improve the efficiency of single-material organic solar cells. An all-conjugated D:A copolymer P(DPP-TTF) was synthesized by Arumugam et al. and exhibited a PCE of 0.3% in SMOSCs.106 Poor electron mobility limits the performance of SMOSCs, while the BHJ OSC based on the blend of P(DPP-TTF):PCBM exhibited a significantly improved PCE of 1.8%. Li et al. introduced polyoxometalate in the D:A copolymer P10 as the acceptor segment and achieved a PCE of 0.31% in SMOSCs.107 After continuing efforts for over ten years, the PCEs of SMOSCs based on D:A copolymer are still below 1%. In short, the high rate and ratio of charge recombination and lack of charge transport channels in D:A copolymers make these materials unsuitable for SMOSCs.
3.2 First-generation BCP SMOSCs: BCP with functionalized side-chain and flexible backbone
In 2006, Lindner et al. first developed a single-active-layer PV device via the self-assembly of a di-block copolymer bearing all the functionalities required for light absorption, charge separation, and charge transport.93 In comparison with devices made from a blend of two individual segment polymers of identical thickness and composition, the PV performance of the BCP PvTPA21-b-PPerAcr79 (subscripts indicate the weight content of each block) device was significantly better than that of the blended device, obtaining a PCE of 0.07% (Table 2). The improved performance of the BCP SMOSCs can be attributed to the nanostructured morphology, which creates more D:A interfaces for exciton dissociation and accessible pathways for carriers to diffuse toward the electrodes. They suggested that by using the concept of fully functionalized BCPs, the single active layer can be used for efficient charge separation, exhibiting the advantage that the majority of the generated excitons reach the interface for charge separation. Controlling the arrangement of macroscopic domains can improve the device electrode charge conduction and create defect-free BCP structures. Two BCPs, PvDMTPA28-b-PPerAcr72 and PvDMTPD19-b-PPerAcr81, were synthesized by optimizing the PvTPA21-b-PPerAcr79 side chain hole-conducting moieties by Sommer et al.76,94 The more electron-rich DMTPA and DMTPD were employed to substitute TPA as the hole-transport segment to tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) value and improve the hole mobility and electrochemical stability of the BCP. Compared to the control BCP PvTPA14-b-PPerAcr86, the HOMO level of PvDMTPA28-b-PPerAcr72 was improved from −5.24 eV to −4.96 eV. The higher D:A HOMO offset in PvDMTPA28-b-PPerAcr72 is beneficial to overcome the exciton binding energy of PERY, leading to a more efficient D:A charge transfer and a remarkably higher Jsc in SMOSCs (from 0.23 mA cm−2 of control BCP to 1.14 mA cm−2). PvDMTPA28-b-PPerAcr72 and PvDMTPD19-b-PPerAcr81 exhibited the same HOMO level. The slightly higher Jsc in the PvDMTPD19-b-PPerAcr81-based SMOSC was caused by the higher charge-carrier mobility of TPDs than TPAs. The apparent difference in Voc is highly related to the morphology. The wire-like structures of the control BCP and PvDMTPA28-b-PPerAcr72-based SMOSCs led to a higher Voc, while PvDMTPD19-b-PPerAcr81 formed a worm-like structure. The low FFs in all BCP SMOSCs are caused by their high series resistance, which can be improved by aligning the wire-like structures perpendicular to the electrodes. The improved solar cell performance utilizing self-assembled BCP structures further confirmed the enormous potential of BCPs as functional materials for nanostructured bulk heterojunction PV devices.108,109 However, BCPs adopt an insulating backbone structure, and given that only the PERT segment can absorb light and the donor segment cannot generate a photocurrent to obtain a high-performance material, it is crucial to design more efficient BCP structures to improve the performance of solar cell devices (Scheme 2).

3.3 Second-generation BCP SMOSCs: BCP with functionalized side-chain and partially conjugated backbone
BCPs with a flexible backbone not only construct a charge transfer barrier but also reduce the chromophore density in films. Researchers attempted to introduce chromophores in the backbone structure and explore the functional side-chain to control the orientation and ordering of BCP microdomains for efficient organic PV devices.54,92,110–116 The introduction of novel donor and acceptor blocks offers a preliminary understanding of the formation of the microphase-separated structure in BCPs. In 2009, inspired by previous reports, Zhang et al. introduced regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) as an electron donor in the copolymer backbone via Grignard metathesis polymerization to synthesize the BCP rr-P3HT-b-PPDA (Scheme 3).92 The phase separation between the acceptor and donor blocks was limited to the nanometer scale by introducing perylene and P3HT in the backbone of the BCP, which is closer to the diffusion length of the exciton. The PCE of the BCP SMOSC was improved to 0.49% (Table 3), which is attributed to the wider absorption region (400–650 nm) and higher donor mobility of P3HT than the triphenylamine-based BCP. The research on improving the performance of BCP SMOSCs has been focused on improving the domain orientation control and optimizing the morphology of BCPs. Sommer et al. investigated the influence of the molecular weight of BCPs on the performance of polymer solar cell devices.116 Higher molecular weight BCPs P3HT-b-PPerAer 2 were found to have over two orders of magnitude higher hole carrier mobility and one order of magnitude higher external quantum efficiency, which is mainly due to the dependence of carrier mobility, crystallization behavior, and molecular weight of the P3HT blocks. Besides using P3HT as a donor block, Sermet et al. synthesized a novel DPP-PDI based on a DPP low-bandgap macroinitiator and a perylenediimide acceptor, which exhibited broad light absorption in the visible and near IR regions.112 However, the charge separation between the components was not improved, and thus it exhibited a low performance.

Fullerene derivatives as a novel acceptor were introduced in BCPs due to their excellent photovoltaic property. Miyanishi et al. reported that poly(3-alkyl thiophene)-based di-block copolymers (BCP7) with fullerene linkage blocks obtained a PV conversion efficiency of 1.7% in 2010.54 The significantly enhanced PCE was attributed to the conjugate expansion of the BCP backbone, and the relatively high FF of the devices suggested that efficient charge transport channels were constructed in the di-block copolymer films, similar to that in mixed bulk heterojunctions. In 2017, Chen et al. synthesized similar chemical structures of poly(3-hexylthiophene), fullerene-attached poly(3-alkyl selenophene) hetero-BCP T-b-SePCBP, poly(3-hexylthiophene), and fullerene-attached poly(3-alkyl thiophene) di-block copolymer T-b-T-PCBP to investigate the presence of energy cascades and their effects on photophysical properties.111 It was found that the separation of BCPs accompanied by microphase separation affected exciton collection and charge recombination efficiency. However, the thin film thermal annealing treatment induces microphase separation of the BCP and provides a thermodynamically stable phase.
In addition, the microphase-separated structure of the di-block copolymer facilitates the control of the active layer morphology. Due to the uniform chemical structure and the tunable molecular length of around 10 nm of donor–acceptor block oligomers, they are ideal candidates to achieve a well-defined nanostructure with a suitable length scale for exciton diffusion. Herein, donor–acceptor block oligomers have also been applied to SMOSCs which exhibited a suitable morphology and relatively high performance. The molecular length, alkyl substituents, and annealing process have a great influence on the nanostructure of D:A conjugated oligomers, increasing the scope for film morphology modulation. Bu et al. reported the preparation of three oligomers (F3T4-hP, F4T6-hP and F5T8-hP) with different molecular lengths.113 The alternating D–A structure of the three oligomers led to highly ordered D–A lamellar nanostructures with a period depending on the molecular length. Finally, SMOSCs based on F5T8-hP exhibited the best PCE of 1.5%. Bu et al. further tunned the alkyl substituents of the above-mentioned three oligomers.110 Consequently, a PCE of 1.75% was demonstrated with the solvent vapor annealed films of F5T8-epP, which represented the best among the solar cells based on the single molecular materials at that time. The molecular length of conjugated oligomers is tunable by around 10 nm, which can be used to prepare high-performance single molecular PV devices. Qu et al. found that the performance of conjugated oligomer devices improved with increasing molecular length and that F5T8-epP is an isomorph that can self-assemble into films of periodic D:A lamellae upon thermal annealing.115 They constructed a D–spacer–A co-oligomer, F5T8P-C4, with self-assembling properties by connecting D- and A-segments through an alkyl spacer. Besides achieving the desired film morphology, while controlling the exciton dissociation and geminate charge recombination processes, a single-molecule PV device with a power conversion efficiency of 2.70% was prepared. F5T8P-C4 combines three key features required for efficient optoelectronic conversion including highly ordered nanoscale D:A phase separation for exciton dissociation and charge transport, balanced hole and electron mobility for charge collection, and long lifetime CT states for low geminate recombination and efficient hole–electron pair separation. Consequently, a superior PV performance was demonstrated in comparison to previously reported polymer blends and D:A copolymer systems.
Comprehensive studies revealed that there are three main reasons for the lower efficiency of BCP SMOSCs, i.e., insufficient backbone conjugate length, lack of highly active donor blocks, and modulation of the microphase separation morphology.71–73,117 The superior device performance of conjugated oligomers may provide a new direction to achieve high-performance BCPs.
3.4 Third-generation BCP SMOSCs: BCP with fully conjugated backbone
The second-generation BCPs normally contain a non-conjugated insulating backbone, which is not beneficial for controlling the D:A interface. Because of this, researchers aimed to design fully conjugated BCPs with appropriate modulation of the interface and purity of the donor and acceptor blocks.118–121 However, it remains a challenge for BCPs to achieve efficient charge photogeneration in PV device architectures.122,123 In 2013, Guo et al. investigated the conjugated BCP P3HT-b-PFTBT, showing that the BCPs self-assembled to form in-plane lamellar morphologies with alternating electron donor and acceptor domains with a predominant face-on orientation in the crystalline P3HT block (Scheme 4).65 The conjugation across the D:A interface was responsible for enhancing the performance of the BCP devices, even though the microstructure of the active layer was similar to that found in blends. The BCP devices achieved efficiencies of 3% without the use of fullerene blocks (Table 4). The relationship between the molecular characteristics of fully conjugated BCPs and PV performance was further investigated by Lin et al., who found that the PV performance of BCPs depended strongly on the miscibility of the donor and acceptor blocks, which impacts the donor and acceptor domain size and purity.124 Strategies for improving the device performance of BCP PVs should seek to increase the segregation between the donor and acceptor polymer domains. The linking groups between the polymer donor and acceptor blocks also have an important impact on the PV performance in fully conjugated BCP systems.125 BCPs containing a wide bandgap monomer at the D:A interface can also reduce the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor polymers and promote charge separation. Lombeck et al. demonstrated that the side-chain fluorination of one segment in all-conjugated BCPs can achieve microphase-separated nanostructures.126 The side chain fluorination can increase the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter between the D:A interface in all-conjugated copolymers, increase the dissimilarity of the two conjugated blocks, achieve a purer microphase-separated structure, and ultimately form thermodynamically stable bi-continuous morphologies. Meanwhile, Thinh et al. investigated the interplay between the crystallization of the individual blocks in fully conjugated BCPs and the phase separation between the donor and acceptor segments.120 It was found that the early crystallization of the P3HT blocks in P3HT-b-PFTBT is faster than the microphase separation and that the strong P3HT crystallization can promote the crystallization of the PFTBT block in P3HT-b-PFTBT BCPs. This enables a mesoscale structure to develop during processes such as thermal annealing because the self-assembly of the lamellar structure takes place before the crystallization of the donor block is complete. They proposed that the PV performance of BCPs is limited by electron transport in the acceptor phase and that designing BCPs where both blocks can crystallize is important to enable ambipolar charge conduction to maximize the PV efficiency. Wang et al. synthesized fully conjugated BCPs containing p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene) and n-type poly(pyrene bisimide) segments, P3HT-b-PBIT2.127 They proved that the optical and electrochemical properties of BCPs strongly depend on the combination ratio of the donor P3HT and acceptor PBIT2 segments, which offers the possibility to obtain more efficient fully conjugated BCP-based devices by optimizing the chemical structures and device fabrication conditions.

The compatibility of donor and acceptor blocks in fully conjugated BCPs and the control of crystal domains and purity in the films have a significant impact on the PV performance. Park et al. conducted a systematic and comprehensive study on fully conjugated BCPs.95 They proposed a new one-pot synthetic strategy, which was used to successfully synthesize a new fully conjugated D–A BCP (CDABP). They accomplished this by introducing naphthalene dicarboximide-selenophene blocks in the copolymers. The donor and acceptor blocks present in CDABP were highly crystallized, and the face-on orientation was promoted via thermal annealing. Dense D- and A-rich nanoscale structures with higher exciton dissociation efficiency and longer carrier lifetime were formed in the films by annealing the material, leading to an optimized SMOSC PCE of 5.28%. Then, the highly crystalline BCP PBDT2T-b-N2200 with good solubility in non-halogen solvents was synthesized, achieving percolation pathways for holes and electrons.86 The corresponding BCP SMOSCs demonstrated an excellent shelf lifetime even after 1020 h of aging, owing to their morphological stability. The rigid structure of the fully conjugated copolymer is not conducive to the formation of easily twistable conformations, which damages the microscopic morphology of the donor block. Lee et al. investigated the effect of the linkage block between the donor and acceptor blocks on the copolymer properties using two novel poly(3-alkyl thiophene)-free (D)n-b-(A)m conjugated BCPs, i.e., PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL.128 PTQI-b-PNDIS is the fully conjugated BCP with a donor block connected to a receptor block through a π-conjugated unit. Conversely, the donor block was connected to the acceptor block via a non-conjugated alkylene spacer to yield the partially conjugated BCP PTQI-b-PNDISL. Therefore, the donor block exhibited independent crystallization behavior by anchoring to the receptor block through the flexible nonconjugated alkylene spacer. The PCE was 1.54% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V, demonstrating a superior performance to that of the BCP SMOSC containing PTQI-b-PNDIS (PCE ∼ 0.36%). These results reveal the potential for improving the PV performance in BCP SMOSCs by controlling the internal morphology with the exploitation of the self-segregating behavior of D- and A-blocks in the solid-state film.
In addition, they made important discoveries in terms of copolymer device lifetime using the fully conjugated block copolymer P3.55 This macromolecule contains a p-type oligomeric unit (P1) block with a wide bandgap and an n-type oligomeric unit (P2) block with a narrow bandgap. This enabled the resultant material to provide a very broad complementary absorption. Complete PL quenching was observed in the P3 film because photoinduced inter/intramolecular charge transfer states were effectively formed. The P3-based BCP SMOSC exhibited an unusually high PCE of 3.87%, high Voc of 0.93 V, and Jsc of 8.26 mA cm−2, demonstrating a significantly improved performance compared to the P1/P2 blend film all-polymer solar cells (PSC). Additionally, owing to the highly stable surface morphology of the P3 film, the BCP SMOSCs exhibited an excellent shelf lifetime of over 2000 h under ambient conditions compared with the PSC fabricated with the P1/P2 blend. They also confirmed that the BCP has wide application potential in the development of indoor organic PVs. Kwon et al. synthesized a new crystalline main chain conjugated copolymer (i.e., P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)), which exhibited a strong absorption band in the range of 450–650 nm, overlapping well with the emission spectrum of a white LED (indoor light source).85 Compared with the PBDB-T and P(NDI2T) blended films, the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films had a relatively smooth surface and internal morphology and better uniformity of the surface charge distribution in the annealed films. The P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film-based IPV devices had a maximum PCE of 12.70%, which was twice that of the blended film-based IPVs, while showing excellent operational stability.
In 2021, we successively introduced the fused-ring core-based NFA Y6 in the BCP backbone and synthesized a narrow bandgap block conjugated polymer PBDB-T-b-PTY6 with optical absorption extending to the near-infrared region.87 The strong electron-deficient non-fullerene molecule Y6 enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics of the excited state, while the selection of the p-type polymer contributed toward the desired energy levels and carrier transport. Consequently, the Jsc using blocked polymers was greatly improved for the first time to over 15 mA cm−2 with a record PCE of 8.64%. Meanwhile, Wu et al. synthesized a similar BCP, PBDB-T-b-PYT, and optimized the device efficiency, achieving a PCE of 11.32%.63 This BCP exhibited relatively small energy losses due to the high charge-transfer state, low non-radiative loss, and improved storage stability under both ambient conditions and continuous 80 °C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Guo et al. further investigated BCP SMOSCs prepared with halogen-free solvents.62 By using o-xylene as a processing solvent for the PBDB-T-b-PYT active layer, high and balanced charge transport properties and well-developed morphological features were observed, leading to a high PCE of 12.60%. Importantly, the non-halogenated solvent-processed devices exhibited better storage and operational stabilities compared to the chloroform (CF)-processed SMOSCs, while exhibiting a higher PV performance (over 12% PCE). Wu et al. synthesized a BCP, PM6-b-PYIT, via a two-pot synthesis method, which achieved a high PCE of 14.88%.58 With the addition of 3 wt% Y6, the PCE was further boosted to 15.55%, marking the first time that a BCP surpassed the 15% threshold. Interestingly, we synthesized a BCP, PM6-b-PTY6, via a one-pot synthesis method, which is highly like PM6-b-PYIT, but only attained a PCE of 3.50%.129,130 Subsequently, we added the structurally compatible additive PM6-b-PTY6 to create the PM6:Y6 BHJ and achieved a better performance and improved stability. The significant difference in PCE may be due to the different molecular weights of the donor and acceptor blocks caused by different synthesis methods. These results confirmed the promising prospects of BCP SMOSCs toward industrial production, particularly being relevant for environmentally friendly solvents.
4. Unsolved challenges and prospective in BCP SMOSCs
There has been tremendous progress in BCP SMOSC research in the past five years; however, more studies are needed to address many open questions to fully understand its impact on next-generation PVs (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Challenges and prospective in BCP SMOSCs. 
4.1 Precise synthesis of BCP materials
The structure of high-performing BCPs is a challenging issue that cannot be currently fully addressed due to the limitations of BCP synthetic protocols. As discussed above, most 3rd generation BCPs prepared for SMOSCs with efficiencies of above 5% were synthesized through one-pot polymerization via the Stille cross-coupling reaction.62,63,85–87,95 Park et al. first reported one-pot polymerization in BCP SMOSCs, aiming at reducing the synthetic time and cost.95 However, the complicated composition of the final BCP product is an inevitable issue of this approach. This synthesis technique is displayed in Fig. 6a. The donor block with active end groups was first synthesized under an inert atmosphere with a catalyst. Then, monomers of the acceptor block were added to the same reaction flask. The product was obtained after a period of reaction, which is a mixture of donor polymer, acceptor polymer, di-block copolymer, and tri-block copolymer due to the non-selectivity of the Stille cross-coupling reaction. Besides, based on current purification technology, it is hard to fully remove the unconnected donor and acceptor polymers, as well as separate the di-block and tri-block copolymers. Fig. 6b shows the two-pot synthesis of BCP via the Stille cross-coupling reaction. However, it is still difficult to obtain the desired D:A di-block with high purity. The ratio of different polymers and BCPs in the product is also difficult to be detected employing current characterization techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and elemental analysis. The complex components in the product may be detrimental to the performance of the corresponding BCP SMOSCs. Thus, more efforts should be focused on the synthesis of well-defined block polymers. As shown in Fig. 6c, Rahmanudin et al. applied the Heck–Mizoroki coupling reaction to synthesize a tri-block copolymer for the fabrication of SMOSCs.131 Employing this method, a well-defined tri-block copolymer, pPDIV-b-pBDTTDPP-b-pPDIV, was synthesized and the SMOSCs based on this material achieved a PCE of 1.51%. The relatively low PCE may be due to the unbalanced D:A molar ratio (1:2) in the tri-block copolymer and the narrow absorption region of 500–700 nm. This synthetic method is enlightening for the synthesis of well-defined BCPs, and more efforts should be devoted to achieving the precise synthesis of BCP materials. In the case of the 2nd generation BCPs based on P3HT-block, it is possible to synthesize well-defined di-block copolymer structures. Sommer et al. synthesized the well-defined and narrowly distributed macroinitiator P3HT-I by quenching the active site of the polymerized P3HT on one side.132 Furthermore, the synthesis of well-defined P3HT-b-PNDIT2 via direct arylation polycondensation was developed by Nübling et al.133 As mentioned above, the key factor in the synthesis of well-defined BCP structures is fixing the active site of the intermediate during their synthesis.

In addition, the compatibility of BCPs in BHJ OSCs should also be emphasized. Previous reports have proven that for the D:A BHJ blend, the introduction of similar BCP structures could significantly alter the blend morphology and enhance the miscibility between the D:A materials.130,134,135 By precisely controlling the blending ratio of BCP, a further enhanced performance and long-term stability were obtained in BHJ OSCs.130,134 Recently, Wu et al. adopted Y6 as the solid additive to BCP SMOSC based on PM6-b-PYIT.58 Considering the positive effect of BCPs in BHJ OSCs, as well as the impact of homopolymer impurities in BCPs for SMOSCs, the working mechanism between the conventional donor/acceptor and BCP material in solar cell devices should be understood in-depth.
Optimization of the molecular weight and its distribution has been widely investigated in BHJ OSCs.136–142 As shown in Fig. 6d, the molecular weight has a great impact on solution/film aggregation, backbone orientation, and phase separation of the polymer blend in BHJ OSCs. However, the effect of molecular weight has hardly been investigated, leaving no developed optimization strategies. Our group and Wu et al. independently developed similar BCPs (PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PYT, respectively). As shown in Scheme 4, the only difference in the structure of the two BCPs is the length of their alkyl side chain. Therefore, the variation in device performance between the two BCPs can be attributed to the reaction time, which controls their molecular weight. Precisely tuning the molecular weights of the donor and acceptor blocks holds great potential for improving the performance of BCP SMOSCs.
In comparison with BHJ OSCs, rational chemical modification strategies are less explored in BCP SMOSCs. The low and unbalanced electron and hole mobility of BCPs is one of the reasons for their lower Jsc. Sommer et al. tuned the mobility of BCPs by changing the chemical structure of the donor block and achieved an improved PCE.76,93 For the emerging BCPs synthesized via the one-pot method, mobility regulation has been rarely studied, which is important for improving the charge transfer and Jsc of SMOSCs. Other modifications such as fluorine substitution and regioregularity regulation are effective ways to improve the performance of BHJ OSCs, which are also important to improve that of BCP SMOSCs.47,143–145 In 2019, Yuan et al. first reported the use of the novel acceptor Y6 in the BHJ OSC PM6:Y6, which achieved a record PCE of 15.7%.12 Currently, Zhu et al. attained a record PCE of 19.60% via derivatives of PM6 and Y6 in BHJ OSCs.14 Our group systematically studied the impact of fluorine substitution on PBDB-T-b-PTY6.129 Regularity regulation has been proven to be an effective way to improve the performance of BHJ OSCs via molecular packing, energy levels, and synthetic repeatability.44,146–151 Our group designed and synthesized two BCPs, namely, PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ, by precisely controlling the regiospecificity of the monomer Y6-Br.147 PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ exhibited a narrower bandgap and a better performance in SMOSCs than the control PBDB-T-b-PTY6. All these recent reports indicate that not only innovative design ideas but also efficient chemical modification should be engineered to further enhance the PV performance.
4.2 In-depth understanding of carrier dynamics
There are many issues preventing BCP SMOSCs from achieving a comparable performance to that of BHJ OSCs, such as lower charge carrier mobility and increased charge recombination. The microstructure information (regioregularity, crystallinity, and reticular fiber structure) obtained from BCP SMOSCs is more complicated than BHJ OSCs, which will lead to new challenges in understanding the charge carrier dynamic mechanism in BCP SMOSCs.
The connected D and A blocks combine the functions of the photophysics process in a single system, which leads to different charge transport properties between the BCP and BHJ blend.152,153 Photogenerated charge carriers originating from the donor or the acceptor block can be transferred within the region of the conjugated backbone. Sufficient interface for exciton dissociation and continuous channels for charge transport are expected to be realized in BCP films through their ordered nanostructure via self-assembly. However, the alternating potential barrier caused by the linkage of the electron push-pull structure in BCPs obstructs further ICT. Previous reports demonstrated the increased possibility of polymer chain twisting and that an increase in defect states may lead to weakened π-stacking short-range order in BCP films.63,87Fig. 7a depicts the possible charge transfer mechanism models in BCP SMOSCs and BHJ OSCs. Electron transfer reactions are the most common photochemical primary process between different molecules (intermolecular) or between different regions within molecules (intramolecular). In this intermolecular or intramolecular process, the reaction products are usually called charge transfer states or ICT. Considering the newly added intramolecular charge separation and transfer in BCPs, the carrier dynamic should be more effective in BCP SMOSCs compared to BHJ OSCs. However, the Jsc and PCE of most BCP SMOSCs are lower than that of BHJ OSCs, which may be due to their undesirable morphology and energy traps. In addition, the contribution of inter- and intra-chain charge separation and transfer has not been quantitatively analyzed.

The charge transfer and transport separation kinetics in BHJ OSCs have been widely studied and understood.78,155–157 In BHJ OSCs, the major packing pattern of facilitating charge transport is considered as π–π stacking, which is due to effective π–π interaction. In organic semiconductors, it is believed that the current density and PCE of OSCs will be reduced because free carriers will be trapped when traps exist, and then the electric field dependence will also be altered. It has been demonstrated that the charge carriers are highly related to the interfacial morphology. BCP PvTPA-b-PPerAcr with different molecular weights (BCP1: 38 kg mol−1, BCP2: 28 kg mol−1, and BCP3: 9 kg mol−1) and polymer blend of PvTPA:PPerAcr were used to investigate the influence of block copolymer molecular weight and phase-separation length scale on the dynamics of charge separation and recombination by Kind et al.154 According to the transient photoluminescence data and TEM image (Fig. 7b and c, respectively), a smaller molecular weight led to a smaller phase separation region and lower photoluminescence quantum yield. This can be explained by the fact that photoinduced excited states are generated closer to the interface, where they are dissociated, and the smaller phase separation region provides a greater interface for charge separation. However, more and smaller interfaces may also lead to more serious recombination. Finally, SMOSCs based on three BCPs exhibited extremely low PCEs (BCP1: 0.018%, BCP2: 0.075%, and BCP3: 0.004%). It is important to find a balance between the domain sizes that encourage charge generation and those that aid transport and collection. Huettner et al. investigated the impact of molecular weight and processing solvent on the crystallinity and phase separation of P3HT-b-PPerAcr by steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopy.158 The measured charge generation time (below t1/2 = 1.5 ps) was much lower than the lifetime of the exciton (t1/2 ∼ 100 ps). The fast charge generation showed that the distribution of D–A interfaces is only on the scale of a few nanometers, which is significantly lower than the phase separation of ∼15 nm determined by X-ray scattering in the bulk. In addition, the high boiling point solvent could enlarge the phase separation time, leading to high crystallinity in P3HT-block and a coarser interface, which are favorable for charge transfer.
Compared with BHJ solar cells, the conjugated D–A structure has greater intramolecular separation mechanism.55 For the donor–bridge–acceptor system, the ICT is affected by the properties of the bridge and substituent. Charge pair dissociation into free carriers is a key step in the operation of organic solar cells. However, the mechanism of monomolecular block polymer materials is still a matter of debate. Therefore, understanding it is of great significance for the development of intra- and inter-molecular charge transfer mechanisms. By design two models of BCP (F8-TBT-P3HT and TBT-F8-P3HT), as shown in Fig. 7d and e, respectively, Johnson et al. demonstrated the fundamental working mechanism of charge generation and separation between donor-block and acceptor-block at the intramolecular “interface” in BCPs.64 Firstly, a strong intramolecular charge transfer state with fast localization (<40 fs) and high efficiency (∼100%) were observed between the D–A linkage. However, due to the absence of a favorable path for the diffusion of electrons, most of the CT states decayed without forming separated charge carriers. In the case of F8-TBT-P3HT, the conjugated connection between the strong donor block (P3HT) and acceptor block (TBT) may form an intramolecular charge transfer state with large oscillator strength, which acts as a trap and induces serious recombination. In contrast, for TBT-F8-P3HT, the large bandgap linker F8 not only hampers charge transfer between the donor block (P3HT) and acceptor block (TBT) but also acts as the interface for charge separation. This work highlights the impact of the interface between the donor block and acceptor on intrachain charge transfer in BCPs. In SMOSCs, structural defects of geminate pairs and twisted long chains, etc. lead to trap states, which have a vital impact on the charge transport parameters, such as the Poole–Frenkel slope and free carrier mobility, whereas the correlation between the trap states and the transport model is unclear. In addition, the development of BCP SMOSCs is in its infancy, and more progressive investigations should be focused on understanding the charge transport behaviors and defect state effects.
4.3 Molecular ordering and morphological control of BCPs
The molecular packing and film morphology are the most important factors for the performance of OSCs.14,34 The stacking units in BCP can form different stacking types including A-to-A type J-aggregation and A-to-D type J-aggregation, which may have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of BCP SMOSCs (Fig. 8a). The microstructure domain size, crystallinity, D:A interface properties, and molecular packing have a remarkable impact on the PCE of OSCs by influencing the exciton diffusion and dissociation, charge transport, and recombination.47,136,159

As mentioned above, the ideal morphology for BCP SMOSCs is a hairpin-like structure with a desired donor and acceptor nanoscale phase separation of 10–20 nm. However, this type of desirable configuration is extremely hard to design and fabricate. Several previous reports developed various strategies towards the controllable self-assembly of BCPs in the solid film state. Hüttner et al. demonstrated that solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an effective method to anneal BCP films and tune the self-assembly of BCPs at low temperatures.160 The authors observed that the disruption of the π–π stacking of the PBI moieties in PPerAcr occurs under a certain threshold of relative solvent vapor pressure, which introduces sufficient polymer-chain mobility to PPerAcr. Then, this method was applied to thin films of a D–A block copolymer PvTPA-b-PPerAcr and the enhanced chain mobility led to the formation of long, uninterrupted lamellar micro-domains (Fig. 8b and c). With proper solvent pressure and SVA treatment time, favorable long-range connectivity, lamellar width and better surface morphology were achieved in the BCP film, which not only provides the proper interface for exciton diffusion but also accessible pathways for charge transfer. The impact of molecular weight and thermal annealing temperature on the microphase separation and morphology of crystalline-liquid crystalline type BCP P3HT-b-PPerAcr were systematically studied by Lohwasser et al.161 The newly synthesized P3HT-block with high molecular weight led to a high χN parameter and microphase separation in the melt. As shown in Fig. 8d and e, after annealed above the melting temperature, and subsequently slowly cooled, a lamellar morphology with a periodicity of about 40 nm and hexagonally ordered morphology were fabricated in different BCP films with a molecular weight of 28.4 kg mol−1 and 35.5 kg mol−1, respectively. Furthermore, Untilova et al. demonstrated that the selective crystallization and orientation of BCPs can be realized by epitaxy and hot temperature (HT) rubbing to obtain ordered structures, which are inaccessible by standard spin coating and annealing processes (Fig. 8f).162 This work highlights the importance of adapting layer spacers to minimize the unit cell mismatch between the donor and acceptor blocks, which can induce BCP self-assembly into long-rage ordered lamellar D–A phases. In general, all the above-mentioned reports successfully optimized the morphology of BCP-based thin films; however, the performance of BCP SMOSCs is still far behind the state-of-the art. Further investigation should be focused on the relationship between morphology and carrier dynamic process, in together with the resultant device efficiency, to finally present a deep understanding of the effect of morphology on the performance of SMOSCs.
The proven methods of morphology regulation in BHJ OSCs can also be introduced to BCP SMOSCs to further improve their performance.101,164,165 Additive and solvent control are two pre-film morphology control methods. The additive method is a simple but effective approach to change the kinetic behavior and induce molecular reconstruction during film formation. In addition, the solvent has a considerable impact on the film morphology and the performance of OSCs. High-boiling point solvents are more suitable than chloroform for the fabrication of large-area devices.166–168 Compared to BHJ OSCs, BCP SMOSCs are less sensitive to the choice of solvent.62,86 For example, BCP SMOSCs using THF as a processing solvent have produced a better performance than that using chloroform. Furthermore, the mixed solvent is a potential way to optimize the morphology and performance of BCP SMOSCs, which has been proven to be effective in BHJ OSCs. The morphology can be further optimized after film formation through the post-film morphology control method including thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and post solvent treatment.37
In addition, the morphology optimization and corresponding performance enhancement of BCP SMOSCs should also focus on further developing more advanced characterization techniques to further observe the film morphology and attain a deeper understanding of the linkage between film morphology and the performance of BCP SMOSCs. The current nanoscale characterization techniques shown in Fig. 8e only cover a small region, yielding results that are not completely representative and are unconvincing. In addition, most of the optimization process is a black box. Herein, in situ characterization should be the focus to better understand the mechanism of film formation including solvent evaporation, crystallization, and phase separation.
4.4 Scalable fabrication and large-area BCP SMOSC devices
Recent developments in non-fullerene acceptors and donor polymers have boosted the best performance of OSCs beyond 19%, while small-area (<0.1 cm2) OSCs are impractical for applications. Enlarging the active area of OSCs with minimal loss in their performance is the key factor for OSCs to be used in practical devices. High PCE, high stability, and low cost are three of the most important factors for the application of large-area OSCs. In comparison with BHJ OSCs, BCP SMOSCs display more potential for integration in large-area OSCs. The PCE of BCP SMOSCs has been elevated from 6.43% to over 15% in the past two years, and with further appropriate molecular modification and device optimization, it is possible for BCP SMOSCs to be optimized to achieve a PCE approaching 20%. Many reports have proven that BCP SMOSCs exhibit better stability than the corresponding BHJ OSCs under different conditions.63,86,87 Furthermore, the device processing of BCP SMOSCs is simpler than BHJ OSCs, which can reduce the solvent, material, and operation time consumption. Thus, to realize the above-mentioned three factors, coating techniques and materials modification need to be collaboratively studied (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  (a) Illustration of four types of coating methods for large-area devices. (b) Preparation of large-area BCP SMOSC device via blade coating method. 
For lab-based research, most of the small-area OSCs were fabricated via the spin-coating process. However, the spin coating method is not suitable for large-area device fabrication. It is difficult to spin coat a large substrate with a high rate and the thickness of the film will be non-uniform, which will be detrimental to the performance of OSCs. Another disadvantage of the spin-coating method is the low utilization of the solution. Most of the solution is spun off the substrate during spin-coating, which leads to low usage of the expensive active material. Therefore, substitutable coating methods such as blade coating, slot-die coating, spray coating, and dip coating should be developed for the fabrication of large-area devices. Among them, blade coating is one of the most promising methods for the fabrication of large-area devices. However, high boiling point solvents are essential to produce uniform films. Most of the non-fullerene BHJ OSCs exhibit the best PCEs when chloroform is used as the solvent, while other high boiling point solvents usually cause significant PCE degradation due to the aggregation of the active materials, and an undesirable morphology. Some strategies such as the ternary strategy were employed to optimize the performance of BHJ OSCs that were fabricated by high boiling point solvents.166 Compared to BHJ blends, BCPs are less sensitive to solvents. BCP SMOSCs prepared using high-boiling solvents exhibited comparable or even higher PCE than BCP SMOSCs prepared using chloroform.62,86 In the case of PBDB-T-b-PYT, the small-area (0.05 cm2) blade-coated SMOSCs exhibit a high PCE of 12.32% and 11.16% when using toluene and chloroform, respectively. The improved performance demonstrated the great potential of BCP SMOSCs in the field of blade-coated large-area devices. Furthermore, the aggregation of BCPs can be avoided because of the ordered self-assembly originating from the D:A structure. The commonly used morphology optimization methods such as processing additive, thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and post-solvent treatment were developed for spin-coated films, which may not work well in large-area devices fabricated using other coating techniques.37 Therefore, morphology optimization methods should be developed particularly for large-area films. In addition, a uniform and stable ink can be obtained when using a BCP as the active material, which is important for the fabrication of large-area devices via various coating methods.
Materials for large-area OSCs should be highly tolerant to the thickness of the films. Due to the strong exciton binding energy and relatively short charge diffusion distance, the thickness of the active layer in OSCs is limited (∼100 nm). Increasing the thickness of the active layer may lead to a decreased fill factor due to the severe charge recombination in BHJ OSCs.169–172 In the case of large-area devices with the above-mentioned non-spin coating method, the active layer is thicker than the spin-coated film due to the different film formation mechanisms. This is favorable for increasing the photocurrent without sacrificing the fill factor. As shown in Fig. 3a, compared to BHJ blends, the self-assembly property of BCP can provide sufficient channels for charge diffusion, which may be not sensitive to an increase in the active layer thickness. Therefore, BCP SMOSCs are more suitable than BHJ OSCs for realizing efficient thick-film devices with a large area. In the future, the modification of BCPs should focus on reducing the thickness sensitivity and improving the charge carrier mobility.
5. Conclusion
BCP SMOSCs have demonstrated a remarkable PV performance compared to the state-of-the-art efficiency of BHJ OSCs in the past few years. Due to their efficiencies approaching 15% combined with significantly enhanced long-term stability, BCP SMOSCs have demonstrated great application potential for use in next-generation PVs. In these BCP materials, the covalent connections between the donor and acceptor segments inhibit undesirable phase separation for better stability and simplify the preparation of organic conductive ink and the photoactive layer. However, for the further development of BCP SMOSCs, more investigations are needed to address challenges to boost the device efficiency, as follows: (1) BCPs with well-defined structures. Current high-efficiency BCPs for SMOSCs are synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling reaction, which are difficult to control and purify. Thus, it is essential to develop more controllable methods for the synthesis of well-defined BCPs. (2) In-depth understanding of carrier dynamics. The intrachain charge separation and carrier transport in the BCP backbone and between neighboring BCPs have not been well studied in current all-conjugated BCP systems. (3) Morphology engineering of BCP films. Integrating the self-assembly property of BCPs, together with rational molecular design, processing solvent, film deposition method and post treatment to systematically achieve the ideal hairpin-like-structured BCP films. (4) Scalable fabrication and large-area devices. With the advantages of minimized procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive inks, long-term stability and insensitivity to high boiling point solvents, further exploring “lab-to-fab” BCP SMOSCs. The precise synthesis, carrier dynamics and morphology control point out directions for further research on BCP SMOSCs to surpass efficiencies of over 20%. In addition, large-area device applications may be a way for BCPs to display prominence in comparison with their BHJ counterparts. When the efficiency, stability, manufacture and large-area goals are achieved, we believe that BCP SMOCSs will gain increased scientific interest, and very likely become a great commercial opportunity in the near future for next-generation PV devices.

Broader context
Block copolymers (BCPs) have been regarded as promising materials for the fabrication of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices due to their unique properties such as self-assembly characteristics to obtain multi-function. In addition, BCP materials offer an advantage in minimizing procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive ink and photoactive layers, and their remarkably stable morphology provides a solution to solve the instability issue in the field of OPV. Around 2017, a new generation of all-conjugated BCP single-materials organic solar cells (SMOSCs) has emerged and brought unique opportunities for obtaining higher power conversion efficiency of over 15%. We believe there it is urgent to propel this emerging technology. In this review, we presented an in-depth discussion on the progress in both BCP materials and SMOSCs, highlighting the unique application potential of BCP SMOSCs, which will offer a suitable platform for accelerating OPV to solve big energy challenges.
