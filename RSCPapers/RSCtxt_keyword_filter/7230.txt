    , Accepted 8th December 2019First published on 10th December 2019AbstractThe development of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical mesoporous architectures comprising two-dimensional (2D) thin nanosheets to improve the electrochemical performance of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) is of great significance. Herein, we report a simple ionothermal strategy that uses an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) as the solvent to synthesize a Ni3Se2 3D hierarchical mesoporous nanosheet network (HMNN) in two stages: the formation a one-dimensional (1D) NiSe-nanorod framework and its subsequent transformation to the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. The as-synthesized Ni3Se2 3D HMNN with a large specific surface area and a well-developed mesoporous structure can provide more active sites for redox reactions and promote electrolytic penetration and charge transfer, thereby achieving excellent electrochemical performance. The Ni3Se2 3D HMNN exhibits a high specific capacitance of 801 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and superior cycling stability (retaining 80.2% of its specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1). Furthermore, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN-based ASC exhibits a high energy density of 38.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 794.5 W kg−1 and outstanding cycling stability (retaining 71.4% of its specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1). Impressively, two such ASC devices connected in series can light up an LED for ∼50 min, suggesting their great potential in high-performance ASCs.
1. Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs) have been regarded as a promising class of energy storage systems because of their high power density, fast charge/discharge rate and long cycling life compared to conventional capacitors and batteries.1–4 However, the relatively low energy density (normally ≤10 W h kg−1) has become a decisive factor limiting their use in commercial applications.5 Therefore, tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to exploring and developing novel strategies for improving the energy density of SCs.6,7 Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), which consist of a capacitor-type electrical double-layer electrode as the power source and a battery-type faradaic electrode as the energy source, have been deemed a particularly effective design due to their extended working voltage and property retention.8,9 The energy density (E) can normally be represented as E = 1/2 × CV2; thus, the specific capacitance (C) contributes to the energy density, as does the operating voltage (V). Specific capacitance is known to be closely related to the nanostructural properties such as porosity, electrical conductivity and stability of the electrode materials.10 Generally, only superficial layers within ∼20 nm of the electrode surface have been reported to be in contact with the electrolyte and serve as the electrochemically active materials, thus contributing to the specific capacitance.11 Additionally, the volume change during redox reactions pulverizes the active materials of the electrode and collapses its nanostructure.5,12 Thus, a 3D hierarchical mesoporous architecture comprising thin 2D nanosheets is expected to be the ideal nanostructure to improve the specific capacitance of electrode active materials due to the following potential advantages: (1) a large specific surface area can provide more active sites for redox reactions and increase the contact surface for the adsorption of electrolyte ions, thereby maximizing the utilization rate of the active materials in the electrode; (2) the mesoporous structure can offer sufficient diffusion channels, shortening the transport length and the diffusion time of electrolyte ions thus improving the electrochemical kinetics;13,14 and (3) the 3D hierarchical architecture comprising 2D thin nanosheets can effectively alleviate the volume expansion during redox reactions because of its mechanical stability and structural integrity.
Transition-metal selenides (TMSs) have received much attention in recent years primarily owing to their high electrical conductivity, tunable electronic configuration and good electrochemical activity.15,16 Specifically, their high electrical conductivity, mainly attributed to the Se (1 × 10−3 S m−1),15 is beneficial for improving the electron transportation within the active material to the current collector. Besides, their electrochemical properties can be adjusted based on the coordination environment as well as by using the d electron counts of the transition metals.17 Nickel selenide, a member of TMSs, exists in the form of three main stable phases: NiSe2, Ni1−xSe (x = 0–0.15), and Ni3Se2.18,19 Among them, Ni3Se2 is attracting attention in the field of SCs due to its higher charge storage capability than NiSe2 and Ni1−xSe according to C = n × F/ΔV × M, assuming all the Ni atoms participate in the reaction.11 To make the most of the advantages of Ni3Se2 as a battery-type faradaic electrode for ASCs, many studies have been undertaken; in particular, the construction of a Ni3Se2 nanostructure is an important research direction: for example, powdered microspheres and nanoparticles,19–21 nanosheet/nanowire/nanorod arrays on conductive substrates,18,22,23 and forest/cauliflower-like nanostructures15,24 have been successfully obtained by various synthesis methods (Table S1†). However, on the one hand, Ni3Se2 3D hierarchical mesoporous architectures have not been achieved yet. On the other hand, the reported methods are either complicated or dependent on organic solvents. Moreover, most of the methods require strict control of the molar ratio of the raw materials, reaction temperature, reaction time and solution pH value. Therefore, the synthesis of a 3D hierarchical architecture comprising 2D thin nanosheets through a facile and environment-friendly route to improve its electrochemical performance is of great significance.
Ionothermal synthesis, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as both the solvent and template (structure-directing agent), has been used to synthesize inorganic materials and inorganic–organic hybrids.25–27 In recent decades, the synthesis of nanostructured inorganic materials by the ionothermal method has aroused increasing attention because of the following advantages:28–31 (1) IL cations are chemically very similar to many species that are already known to be good templates, and they can be used for controlling the phase and morphology of inorganic materials; (2) ILs have excellent solvation properties for inorganics and organics, which makes the synthetic process easier to control; (3) the essentially negligible vapor pressure of ILs eliminate the safety concerns of the synthetic reaction. Moreover, ILs as supramolecular fluids have strong and weak coexisting interactions, including the ability to self-assemble into ordered structures via hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking, which provides new opportunities to design and synthesize 3D hierarchical nanostructures. Therefore, in this study, we synthesize a Ni3Se2 3D hierarchical architecture comprising 2D thin nanosheet subunits via ionothermal synthesis to improve its electrochemical performance for use in ASCs. The synthetic reaction involves two stages: the formation of a 1D NiSe nanorod framework and its transformation into the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIm]Cl) plays a crucial role, which concretely embodies three aspects: (1) inducing the dissolution of the newly formed 1D NiSe nanorods; (2) guiding the formation of the Ni3Se2 nanosheets at the solid–liquid boundary; (3) preventing the aggregation of the newly formed Ni3Se2 nanosheets. When the as-synthesized Ni3Se2 3D HMNN was evaluated as an electrode material for use in an ACS, a high specific capacitance of 801 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 3 A g−1. Even when the current density was increased to 20 A g−1, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode could still exhibit a noteworthy capacitance of 427 F g−1, displaying a high specific capacitance and exceptional rate capacity. Furthermore, an ASC assembled using the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN (positive electrode) and activated carbon (AC; negative electrode) delivered high energy density and power density and excellent cycling stability. Impressively, two such devices connected in series could power a commercial 3 mm-diameter LED for ∼50 min, demonstrating the great potential of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC device as an ASC for practical applications. This new strategy offers a simple yet effective approach to synthesize Ni3Se2 3D HMNNs and is expected to be applicable in the synthesis of other TMSs with 3D hierarchical mesoporous architectures for ASCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Crystal phase, morphology and composition of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN
The crystal phase and purity of the as-synthesized Ni3Se2 3D HMNN were characterized by powder XRD measurement, as shown in Fig. 1a. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the hexagonal Ni3Se2 (JCPDS no. 19-0841), whose crystal structure is shown in Fig. S1a.† No characteristic diffraction peaks of other impurities are found, implying the high purity of the sample. The EDX spectrum (Fig. S2†) confirms that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN is composed of Ni and Se elements with the atomic ratio of Ni:Se ∼3:2. To acquire the elemental chemical states of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN, XPS spectra were recorded. Fig. 1b depicts the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p, which can be well fitted into two spin–orbit doublets and two shake-up satellites (represented as “Sat.”). The fitted peaks at the binding energies of 855.3 eV and 873.0 eV are attributed to the spin–orbit splitting of the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 levels. Moreover, the peaks at the binding energies of 861.1 eV and 879.0 eV are the shake-up satellites of the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 levels. The results suggest that the Ni species are in the +2 oxidation state in the Ni3Se2, which is well consistent with the previously reported Ni3Se2 materials.11,15,18 As for the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Se 3d (Fig. 1c), the peaks at binding energies of around 54.9 and 55.8 eV belong to the Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 of Se2−, respectively.32 Furthermore, the weak signal at ∼58.1 eV is characteristic of the surface oxidation state of the Se species.33,34 The morphological features of the as-synthesized Ni3Se2 3D HMNN can be observed in the FESEM and TEM images. The typical top view FESEM image (Fig. 1d) shows that the product consists of numerous uniform 2D nanosheets, which interconnect with each other to knit a net-like 3D hierarchical architecture with many pores. The side view FESEM image (Fig. 1e) shows that the thickness of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN is about 3–4 μm. The characteristics of the 3D hierarchical mesoporous architecture composed of 2D thin nanosheets are further confirmed from the TEM images (Fig. 1f and g). Obviously, the whole Ni3Se2 3D HMNN looks fluffy and porous with plenty of 2D thin nanosheets at the edges. The AFM image and the corresponding height profiles (Fig. S3†) show that the average thickness of an individual Ni3Se2 nanosheet is ∼12 nm. The HRTEM images (Fig. 1h and the inset) reveal two sets of lattice fringes with interplanar distances of approximately 0.30 and 0.174 nm and a dihedral angle of approximately 30°, which correspond to the (110) and (300) plane of the hexagonal Ni3Se2. According to the Weiss zone law and the intrinsic anisotropic characteristics of the Ni3Se2 layered nanostructure, the crystal growth of the Ni3Se2 subunits is possibly preferentially oriented along the ab plane, restrained along the [001] direction. The TEM elemental mapping images of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN (Fig. 1i) demonstrate a nearly uniform distribution of Ni and Se elements across the whole Ni3Se2 3D HMNN.

2.2 Formation mechanism of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN
To shed light on the formation mechanism of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN, a series of [BMIm]Cl amount-dependent and time-dependent experiments were carried out. Fig. 2 displays the FESEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the products synthesized in the presence of different amounts of [BMIm]Cl. 1D rod-like nanostructures with an average length of ∼1 μm and a smooth surface (Fig. 2a and S4a†) were achieved in the absence of [BMIm]Cl. The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S5a†) reveals that all the diffraction peaks are attributed to the hexagonal NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160 and 89-2058), whose crystal structures are shown in Fig. S1b and c.† The EDX pattern (Fig. S6a†) clearly reveals that the obtained product consists of only Ni and Se elements with an atomic ratio about 1:1. Moreover, the XPS spectra (Fig. S6b and c†) indicate the existence of Ni2+ and Se2−. The TEM image (Fig. 2d) further confirms the rod-like characteristics and solid nature of the 1D NiSe NRs with a smooth surface. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2g shows a characteristic interplanar d-spacing of 0.27 nm, which coincides with the (101) plane of NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160), meaning that the growth of the NiSe NRs is along the [001] direction. When 20 mmol of [BMIm]Cl was used and the other reaction conditions were kept constant, the morphology of the product changed distinctly. The FESEM images (Fig. 2b and S4b†) show that the NRs are compactly wrapped with a mass of nanosheets, exhibiting core/shell-like morphology. Moreover, the NR cores become thinner, but the whole core/shell hierarchical nanostructure is thicker, ∼1.8 μm. The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S5b†) shows that all the diffraction peaks can be well assigned to the hexagonal Ni3Se2 except for the NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160 and 89-2058) peaks. Compared to those in Fig. S5a,† the peak intensities of the NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160 and 89-2058) obviously decrease, suggesting that the NiSe/Ni3Se2 core/shell hierarchical nanostructure has started to form. This core/shell feature is further confirmed in the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 2e and h); apparently, the newly formed thin coating layers on the surface of the NiSe NR cores are Ni3Se2 nanosheets. The interlayer spacings of 0.195 and 0.174 nm correspond to the (131) plane of NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-2058) and the (300) plane of Ni3Se2, respectively. This means that the growth of the NiSe NRs is along the [001] direction. With a further increase in the amount of [BMIm]Cl to 40 mmol, a remarkable change in the morphology of the product takes place, as displayed in Fig. 2c. The NRs become thinner and fewer, whereas the nanosheets grow much more and larger and fully cover the NRs and tend to weave with each other. Additionally, the thickness of the as-synthesized hierarchical nanostructure increases to ∼2.5 μm (Fig. S4c†). According to the XRD analysis (Figure S5c†), the hexagonal NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160 and 89-2058) still coexists with the hexagonal Ni3Se2; however, the peak intensities of the NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-7160 and 89-2058) become distinctly weaker. The TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 2f and i) also reveal a well-defined core/shell hierarchical nanostructure composed of different materials with different morphologies, NiSe NRs (cores) and Ni3Se2 nanosheets (shells), where the thin NiSe NRs are completely coated by a mass of Ni3Se2 nanosheets. The interplanar distance of 0.264 nm is attributed to the (021) plane of NiSe (JCPDS no. 89-2058), while the interplanar spacing of 0.174 nm belongs to the (300) plane of Ni3Se2.

(j) Schematic illustration of the formation process of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. 
In light of the above observations and referring to the previous literature,19,35,36 we propose the possible formation mechanism of the 1D NiSe NRs as follows: firstly, SeO32− ions are reduced to elemental Se, which is further converted to Se2− upon heating. Meanwhile, Ni is oxidized to Ni2+ in alkaline solution, which is further transformed to [Ni(NH3)4]2+ in hydrazine hydrate aqueous.37 Then, Se2− ions react with [Ni(NH3)4]2+ to produce NiSe NRs. The oxidation reaction of Ni is similar to that of Cu, given that Cu and Ni are in neighboring families and display similar characteristics.38 Besides, our experimental results are in accordance with the previous reports, in which the NiSe was formed in alkaline solution with elemental Ni as the Ni source.24,39 The corresponding equations can be described as follows: SeO32− + N2H4·H2O → Se + N2↑ +2OH− + 2H2O(1) 3Se + 6OH− → 2Se2− + SeO32− + 3H2O(2) 3N2H4·H2O + H2O → N2↑ + 4NH3·H2O(3) Ni + 4NH3·H2O → [Ni(NH3)4]2+ + 4H2O + 2e−(4) [Ni(NH3)4]2+ + Se2− → NiSe + 4NH3↑(5)
When 20 mmol of [BMIm]Cl was introduced into the reaction system, the NiSe/Ni3Se2 core/shell hierarchical nanostructure was formed, indicating that [BMIm]Cl significantly influences the morphology and phase of the product. In the presence of [BMIm]Cl, the newly formed highly active NiSe will react with excessive elemental Ni to produce Ni3Se2 through the following reaction:19,36 2NiSe + Ni → Ni3Se2(6)
One thought-provoking problem is that the reaction (6) didn't take place in the absence of [BMIm]Cl, which may be attributed to the additional special formation procedure of the 1D NiSe NRs in the presence of [BMIm]Cl. According to the previous reports,28,40 ILs are shown to be good solvents for elemental selenium, which exists in the form of polyanions and radicals. Meanwhile, the nickel plate will be etched by [BMIm]Cl to form [NiCl4]2− ions via reaction (7), which can't be reduced to Ni atoms by N2H4·H2O.37 The electrons released from the etching process of the nickel plate can be readily accepted by polyselenide radicals to form Se2− ions, which are highly reactive and rapidly react with [NiCl4]2−/[Ni(NH3)4]2+ to produce 1D NiSe NRs through the reactions in eqn (5) and (8): Ni + 4Cl− → [NiCl4]2− + 2e−(7) [NiCl4]2− + Se2− → NiSe + 4Cl−(8)
It is worth noting that increasing the amount of [BMIm]Cl is conducive to the transformation of the 1D NiSe NRs to the 2D Ni3Se2 nanosheets, namely, [BMIm]Cl plays a vital role in promoting the dissolution of the 1D NiSe NRs and facilitating the formation of the Ni3Se2 nanosheets. As mentioned above, in the presence of 60 mmol of [BMIm]Cl, the 1D NiSe NRs thoroughly converted to the Ni3Se2 nanosheets and the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN was finally obtained as shown in Fig. 1. The loose and mesoporous characteristics of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN are possibly due to the previous support from the 1D NiSe NR skeleton and the well-dispersed Ni3Se2 nanosheets in the subsequent weaving process. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that [BMIm]Cl is the pivotal key to the transformation of the 1D NiSe NRs to the 2D Ni3Se2 nanosheets and the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. Fig. 2j schematically shows how the 1D NiSe NRs gradually dissolve and reform into the Ni3Se2 nanosheets under the action of [BMIm]Cl, which interconnect with each other to finally knit into a 3D HMNN.
Based on the above analysis and our previous research,28 the possible role of [BMIm]Cl in the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN can be ascribed to the following three aspects: (1) serving as the reaction initiator to induce dissolution of the newly formed 1D NiSe NRs; (2) adsorbing on the Ni3Se2 nucleus to guide the formation of a remarkably well-defined layer structure at the solid–liquid boundary; and (3) preventing the aggregation of the just formed Ni3Se2 nanosheets. The latter two points can be further proved from a theoretical perspective. As is well-known, owing to the Lewis acidity of the hydrogen atoms at the C2 position of imidazole rings, [BMIm]+ ions can be easily adsorbed on the Se2− negative charge centers of the Ni3Se2 through electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding interaction.31 As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the distance between two Se adsorption sites on the Ni3Se2 (001) plane is 0.603 nm along both the [100] and [010] directions, which is well-matched with the mutual π-stacking distance (0.6–0.7 nm) between the aromatic rings. Apparently, the results also conform to the “geometric matching principle” proposed by our group for the adsorption of ILs on the substrate.41 Thus, [BMIm]+ ions will vertically adsorb on the (001) plane and self-assemble into an ordered structure through π-stacking interactions (Fig. 3b), which facilitates oriented growth of the Ni3Se2 crystals along the ab facet. Furthermore, the tight coverage layer of [BMIm]+ ions can effectively prevent re-aggregation of the newly formed Ni3Se2 nanosheets because of the steric hindrance effect. To confirm these effects of [BMIm]+ ions, control experiments were performed by using an equimolar of [BMIm]Ac or NaCl instead of [BMIm]Cl. It is of interest to note that the product was still the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN when an equimolar of [BMIm]Ac was used (Fig. S7†); however, the product was 1D NiSe NRs covered by a lot of nanoparticles when [BMIm]Cl was superseded by an equimolar of NaCl (Fig. S8†). Therefore, [BMIm]+ ions are critical for the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and are expected to be used in synthesizing other TMSs with 3D hierarchical mesoporous architectures.

(b) Schematic illustration of a projected view of [BMIm]+ ions anchored on the (001) plane of Ni3Se2 to form a tight coverage layer via the original cell. Green balls are Se atoms, purple balls are Ni atoms and blue balls are [BMIm]+ ions adsorbed by Se atoms. 
To acquire more information about the formation process of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN, time-dependent experiments were carried out in the presence of 60 mmol of [BMIm]Cl while keeping the other conditions constant. The FESEM images and XRD patterns of the products collected at different times are shown in Fig. 4 and S9,† respectively. The FESEM images display, in the early growth stage (4 h) (Fig. 4a1 and a2), a thin layer (∼100 nm) product with lots of bumps coated by catkin-like sheets. Fig. S9a† reveals that NiSe, Ni3Se2 and elemental Se were formed within the initial 4 h, implying that all the involved reactions (including the formation of NiSe and the transformation from NiSe to Ni3Se2) proceed simultaneously. It should be noted that there are enough Se2− ions in the solution at the beginning because of the strong reducibility of hydrazine hydrate, so the nucleation and crystallization of NiSe NRs will dominate the process according to eqn (5) and (8). When the reaction time increases to 8 h (Fig. 4b1 and b2), it is observed that the bumps coated by catkin-like sheets grew into NRs covered by numerous thin sheaths, and the thickness of the product layer increased to ∼200 nm. Compared with the XRD pattern of the product obtained in the initial stage, the diffraction peaks of elemental Se completely disappear, and NiSe is found to coexist with Ni3Se2 (Fig. S9b†). Besides, the peak intensities of NiSe sharply decrease whereas those of Ni3Se2 significantly increase, which suggests that the reduction of SeO32− ions and elemental Se to Se2− ions is accomplished at this stage, and the generation of NiSe and its transformation to Ni3Se2 occur simultaneously. Upon further prolonging the reaction time (Fig. 4c1–e2), the NRs become thinner and thinner and the nanosheets connect with each other as they grow larger and larger. In addition, the thickness of the product layer increases from ∼1 to ∼1.6 μm. The corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. S9c–e†) demonstrate that the peak intensities of NiSe gradually decrease upon prolonging the reaction time from 12 to 20 h. These morphological and crystal phase evolutions (Fig. 4 and S9†) indicate that the formation of the Ni3Se2 (eqn (6)) nanosheets is the dominant reaction in the later stage. This is because the concentration of Se2− ions decreases continuously (eqn (5) and (8)) while the content of elemental Ni is basically constant. Therefore, NiSe NRs act as the skeleton to support the gradually produced Ni3Se2 nanosheets, which results in the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, an appropriate reaction time is also pivotal for the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN.

It is well known that the specific surface area and pore structure are crucial for active materials in energy storage; hence N2 adsorption–desorption measurements of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. S10a.† The Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs show a typical IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop at relative pressures between 0 and 1, suggesting a mesoporous feature, which is further confirmed from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots (Fig. S10b†). Table S2† shows that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN is as high as 201.2 m2 g−1, which is 16.4 times higher than that of the 1D NiSe NRs (12.3 m2 g−1). The lower BET specific surface area of the 1D NiSe NRs is probably attributed to the unfavorable rod-like blocks, which reduce the effective exposed surface area; in contrast, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN made up of 2D thin nanosheet subunits could significantly increase the effective exposed surface area. It is interesting to note that the pore diameters of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN are mainly in the mesoporous region with a bimodal mesoporous structure located at ∼4.6 and ∼10.6 nm, respectively. The bimodal mesoporous structure of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN may be due to the porous structure of the 2D nanosheet subunits and the cavities formed in the weaving process of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. Besides, the pore volume of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN (0.658 cm−3 g−1) is much larger than that of the 1D NiSe NRs (0.048 cm−3 g−1), which is also due to the unique structural advantages of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. The large BET specific surface area can provide more active sites and maximize the electrode/electrolyte contact area. Furthermore, the well-developed mesoporous structure can promote efficient penetration and fast transmission of electrolyte ions. Moreover, the 3D net-like structure possesses outstanding electrical contact and mechanical stability, which suggests the great advantages of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN in electrochemical energy storage applications.
2.3 Capacitive performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN
The electrochemical properties of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs were evaluated in a three-electrode configuration using a 3 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 5a and S11a† display the representative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs at various scan rates, ranging from 5 to 30 mV s−1. All the CV curves show a pair of redox peaks within a potential range of 0–0.75 V (vs. Hg/HgO), which differ from an ideal rectangular shape, displaying the characteristics of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NR battery-type faradaic electrodes. The redox reaction mechanism of both the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NR electrodes is based on the reversible redox reaction Ni2+/Ni3+,42 as described by the following equations:11,43 Ni3Se2 + 3OH− ↔ Ni3Se2(OH)3 + 3e−(9) NiSe + OH− ↔ NiSe(OH) + e−(10)

(d) Impedance Nyquist plots of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs (the top left and bottom right corner insets are the corresponding equivalent circuit and amplified pattern, respectively). (e) Cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs cycled for 10000 cycles at a large current density of 10 A g−1. (f) GCD profiles of the last 10 cycles of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs cycled for 10000 cycles at a large current density of 10 A g−1. 
Upon increasing the scan rate, the kinetic response of the redox current intensity increases, but the shape of the CV curves remains constant, indicating that the as-synthesized electrodes feature low resistance and fast ion/electron transport. In addition, the cathodic and anodic peaks shift slightly to lower and higher potentials, respectively, implying inadequate insertion of OH− from the alkaline electrolyte into the centers of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs electrodes at high charge–discharge rates. Based on the previous reports,44 the current density follows a power law relationship with the scan rate, expressed as i = avb. The value of b is 1 (namely, i = av), when it involves nondiffusion-controlled surface redox reactions (capacitive effect), whereas b is equal to 1/2 (that is, i = av1/2), when it involves diffusion-controlled redox intercalation processes (battery-type behavior).45 Fig. S12a† shows the fitted line of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode based on the anodic peaks with a b-value of 0.83, which reveals that the current originates from the capacitive effect mixed with contributions from diffusion-controlled battery-type behavior. As displayed in Fig. S12b and c,† upon increasing the scan rate, the capacitive contribution of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode increases while the intercalation contribution decreases because of inadequate insertion of OH− from the alkaline electrolyte into the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. The results reveal that the surface capacitive mechanism is responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S11b,† the incremental area of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode is substantially larger than that of the 1D NiSe NR electrode at the same sweep rate of 15 mV s−1, which suggests that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN based supercapacitor possesses a higher specific capacitance than the 1D NiSe NR based device. Fig. 5b and S11c† depict the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs measured in the potential window of 0–0.55 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at different current densities ranging from 3 to 20 A g−1. The non-linear shapes of the GCD curves further indicate the characteristics of battery-type charge storage. The GCD curves of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NR electrodes at a current density of 5 A g−1 (Fig. S11d†) further suggest that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode possesses a higher capacitance than the 1D NiSe NR electrode at the same current density.
The rate capability is a significant parameter for high-performance ASCs; thus the specific capacitances of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs were calculated from the GCD curves in line with eqn (11) and are displayed in Fig. 5c. It is clear that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN exhibits a higher capacitance. In particular, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN shows specific capacities of 801, 695, 643, 596, 513, 480, 461 and 427 F g−1 as the current densities rise from 3 to 20 A g−1, which are much higher than the values of 412, 381, 344, 327, 305, 300, 295 and 291 F g−1 for the 1D NiSe NRs at the same current densities. Obviously, the 3D HMNN can improve the electronic conductivity and thereby reduce the charge transfer resistance, which could be confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured at open circuit voltage in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. As shown in Fig. 5d, the EIS plots of both the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs exhibit a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region, which were fitted with the equivalent circuit (top left inset of Fig. 5d). Concretely speaking, in addition to the double-layer capacitance (Cd), the diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Besides, the intercept on the real axis and the slope of the line are correlated with the bulk resistance (Rs) and the Warburg impedance (Zw), respectively. The fitting results indicate that the Rs and Rct of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN are 0.248 and 0.06 Ω, respectively, which are much lower than the 0.262 and 0.219 Ω for the 1D NiSe NRs, concurring with the outstanding rate performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. Furthermore, the Zw values, depending on the diffusion of the electrolyte and protons in the electrode material, are 0.418 and 0.271 Ω for the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs, respectively, implying easier ion mobility within the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN.
The cycling stability is another vital parameter for high-performance ASCs; thus the long-term stabilities of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NR electrodes were assessed at a high discharge current density of 10 A g−1 for 10000 cycles, and the specific capacitances as a function of cycle number are shown in Fig. 5e. Impressively, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN retains 80.2% of the initial specific capacitance value after 10000 cycles, whereas the capacitance retention of the 1D NiSe NRs is only 58%, suggesting that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN is a potential electrode for ASCs. Fig. 5f displays the last 10 GCD profiles of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs for 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Compared to the first 10 GCD curves (Fig. S13†), there is no obvious shape change for the last 10 GCD curves, suggesting a highly reversible charge–discharge process and satisfactory cycling performance. The electrochemical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode is competitive or better than those of some previously reported Ni-based active materials, as listed in Table S3.†
Based on the above results, it is certain that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN displays great potential as an electrode for ASCs owing to its unique structural merits. Compared with the 1D NiSe NRs, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN has the intrinsic advantages of a higher surface area, larger pore volume and 3D mesoporous network structure, which give rise to improved specific capacitance, electrochemical kinetics and excellent long-term cycling performance. Specifically, the large surface area can provide more active sites and sufficient contact between the electrolyte and the electrode during redox reactions, and the large mesoporous volume can function as electrolyte reservoirs that can shorten the ion diffusion length. The interconnected network consisting of multiple scale pores can facilitate the mass transport of ions and fast transfer of electrons. Moreover, the 3D mesoporous network comprising 2D nanosheets can effectively buffer the volume changes during the redox reactions, consequently ensuring the mechanical stability and structural integrity of the electrode during long-term cycling.
To further evaluate the practical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN electrode, an AC negative electrode and the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN positive electrode are assembled into an ASC device separated using one piece of cellulose (Fig. 6a), and all the related measurements are performed in a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. In order to achieve the optimal performance of the assembled ASC device, the mass ratio of the negative electrode versus the positive electrode is calculated to be ∼4.5 according to eqn (12). The AC was characterized by FESEM (Fig. S14a–c†), which shows that the AC blocks are made up of nanoparticles with an average diameter of 100 nm. Moreover, the AC presents excellent electrochemical performance (Fig. S14d–f†), delivering a high specific capacitance of 157 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Fig. S15a† presents the CV curves of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and AC at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, which shows stable voltage windows of 0–0.75 V and −1 to 0 V, respectively. As for the assembled ASC device, a series of CV measurements (Fig. S15b†) was performed within 0–1.8 V to choose the best voltage window of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC. Apparently, a noticeable polarization takes place when the potential window is beyond 1.6 V, and water will decompose and oxygen will be generated;12,13 thus 1.6 V is selected as the working voltage window to study the electrochemical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC. Fig. 6b and c show the representative CV and GCD curves of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC obtained within an optimal voltage window of 0–1.6 V at scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 and at current densities ranging from 1 to 10 A g−1. No obvious change in the shape of the CV and GCD curves was observed with the increasing scan rate and current density, which reveals the outstanding fast charge–discharge capability and reversibility of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC. In addition, the specific capacitances were calculated from the GCD curves on the basis of the total mass of both the positive and negative electrodes and are shown in Fig. 6d. It is notable that the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device can deliver a high specific capacitance of 108 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and still maintain 44 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1. The long-term cycling stability of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device was analyzed at a current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 6e). As expected, the as-assembled Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device manifests a long lifespan while retaining 71.4% of the initial specific capacitance even after 10000 cycles, and the coulombic efficiency during the whole cycle life test is higher than 96%. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S16,† compared with the GCD curves for the first 10 cycles, there is no obvious shape change for the GCD curves in the last 10 cycles, confirming the stable long-term cycling performance. Additionally, as described in Fig. S17 and Table S4,† the EIS data of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device before the 1st cycle and after the 10000th cycle demonstrate that the Rs and Rct only slightly increase after 10000 cycles, which further demonstrates a prominent cycling durability of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device.

(f) Ragone plot comparing other previously reported devices. (g) Two Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC devices connected in series lit up a commercial blue or yellow LED for up to ∼50 min. 
The energy and power densities calculated in accordance with the GCD profiles are the key parameters to evaluate the performance of the assembled Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device. As shown in the Ragone plot (Fig. 6f), the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC ASC device can achieve a high energy density of 38.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 794.5 W kg−1. Remarkably, even at a much higher power density of 8 kW kg−1, it still maintains an energy density of 15.6 W h kg−1. In general, this value is higher than those of many other ASCs, for instance, Ni3Se2 NSs@CF//AC@CC (32.8 W h kg−1 at 667.03 W kg−1),15 NiO mesocrystals//3D nitrogen-doped graphene (34.4 W h kg−1 at 150 W kg−1),46 NiCo2S4@PPy-50//AC (34.62 W h kg−1 at 120.19 W kg−1),47 NiCo2O4@CNT/CNT//treated carbon cloth (27.6 W h kg−1 at 550 W kg−1),48 ultrathin NiCo2S4 nano-petals//AC (35.6 W h kg−1 at 819.5 W kg−1),49 NiS//carbon nanofibers (34.9 W h kg−1 at 387.5 W kg−1),50 (Ni0.33Co0.67)Se2 CHSs//AC (29.1 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),51 NiSe/MoSe2//AC (24.5 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1),16 NiSe2 spheres//AC (35.2 W h kg−1 at 749.3 W kg−1)52 and Ni0.85Se@MoSe2//graphene nanosheet ASC (25.5 W h kg−1 at 420 W kg−1).53 Finally, a demonstration of two tandem Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC devices lighting up LED lights was carried out. Impressively, the two Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC devices connected in series can successfully light the LED lights with a diameter of 3 mm for up to ∼50 minutes. The digital photographs of the glow intensity of the LED lights obtained at different time intervals are exhibited in Fig. 6g. All the above-mentioned results fully reveal the higher practical application value of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC device.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a Ni3Se2 3D hierarchical mesoporous nanosheet network was successfully synthesized by a simple ionothermal approach by using [BMIm]Cl as the solvent. The results indicate that [BMIm]Cl plays a crucial role in the formation of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN, and the final phase and morphology of the product can be controlled by adjusting the amount of [BMIm]Cl and the reaction time. Compared to the 1D NiSe NRs, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN comprising 2D thin nanosheets exhibits a higher specific capacitance (801 F g−1 at 3 A g−1), better rate capability with a capacitance retention of 53.3% at 20 A g−1, and a more stable cycling performance retaining 80.2% of the initial specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which are ascribed to its higher surface area, larger pore volume, and unique 3D mesoporous network structure. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and AC delivered high energy densities of 38.4 and 15.6 W h kg−1 at power densities of 794.5 and 8000 W kg−1, respectively. Besides, the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN//AC device exhibited stable cycling performance (retaining 71.4% of the initial specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1), demonstrating its viability and potential for practical application. The simple ionothermal route provides an effective new approach for the controlled synthesis of Ni3Se2 and is expected to be applicable in the synthesis of other transition metal selenides with 3D hierarchical porous architectures for a wide range of applications, including energy storage devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Synthesis

Chemicals. 
All of the chemical reagents utilized are of analytical grade and were used without any further purification. The ILs [BMIm]Cl (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) and [BMIm]Ac (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate) were purchased from Lanzhou Yulu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd, and their structures are depicted in Fig. S18.† Activated carbon was supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co. Ltd.


Synthesis of the 1D NiSe nanorods. 
All of the samples were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.5 mmol Na2SeO3 (0.0865 g) were first dissolved in 4 mL deionized (DI) water in a Teflon container under vigorous stirring, followed by addition of 1 mL N2H4·H2O (80%). Then, a piece of a nickel plate with a size of 1 × 1 cm2 was immersed into the above homogeneous solution and the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 °C for 24 h. After cooling, the formed 1D NiSe NRs were exfoliated from the nickel plate by sonication. Then the black products were collected by centrifugation, washed with DI water and absolute ethanol several times, and finally dried in air at 65 °C for 12 h. The as-synthesized product is denoted as 1D NiSe NRs.


Synthesis of the Ni3Se2 3D hierarchical mesoporous nanosheet network. 
The synthesis process of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN is the same as that of the 1D NiSe NRs except for introducing an appropriate amount of [BMIm]Cl. The as-obtained product is named the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN. To confirm the impact of [BMIm]Cl, control experiments were conducted by replacing [BMIm]Cl with an equimolar of NaCl or [BMIm]Ac.

4.2 Characterization
The crystal phase of the products was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku, D/max-2200PC) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL JSM, 6700F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai G220S, 120 kV/200 kV). The composition and elemental valence states of the products were studied using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX; JEOL JSM, 6700F) and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS; Thermo, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The surface area and pore size distribution were measured by means of an AUTOSORB-IQ-type gas absorption analyzer and analyzed utilizing the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods. The thickness of the 2D Ni3Se2 nanosheets was measured by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM; NTEGRA Prima).
4.3 Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation and a LAND battery system. The electrochemical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN working electrode was first evaluated by using a three-electrode configuration, in which a platinum plate acted as the reference electrode, Hg/HgO acted as the counter electrode and 3 M KOH acted as the electrolyte. As regards preparation of the working electrode, a mixture consisting of the active materials, acetylene black and polymer binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 was coated onto a piece of nickel foam (1 × 1 cm2) and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h; the mass-loading of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN and 1D NiSe NRs is about 1.5 mg. The specific capacitance Cs (F g−1) was calculated from the GCD curves as follows:54 (11)wherein I, Δt, ΔV and m correspond to the discharge current density (A), discharge time (s), voltage range (V) and mass of the active material (g), respectively. The electrochemical performance of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN working electrode was further assessed using an asymmetric supercapacitor which was assembled using the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode. The positive electrode and negative electrode were separated using cellulose paper. The preparation of the AC negative electrode was the same as that of the Ni3Se2 3D HMNN positive electrode except that the active material was AC. The mass-loading of the AC was about 6.5 mg. The masses of the positive and negative electrodes were balanced based on the following equation:54 (12)wherein m±, Cs±, and ΔV± correspond to the mass, specific capacitance and voltage range of the positive (+) and negative (−) electrodes, respectively. For the asymmetric supercapacitor, the specific capacitance Cs (F g−1), energy density E (W h kg−1) and power density P (W kg−1) were calculated based on the total mass (M) of the two electrodes according to the following equations:55,56 (13) (14) (15)
