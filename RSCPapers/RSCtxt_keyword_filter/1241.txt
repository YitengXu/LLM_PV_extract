    , Accepted 3rd February 2012First published on 16th February 2012AbstractThe importance of symmetry breaking was investigated in bulk heterojunction solar cells with a conventional device structure. Artificial symmetry breaking was built up by introducing a titanium suboxide. With sufficient symmetry breaking, the influence of the cathode work-function can be diminished, thereby extracting the same level of open circuit voltage regardless of metal work-function.

Polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on composites of semiconducting conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have received much attention because of their potential application in low-cost, printable, portable, and flexible renewable energy sources.1–3 Tremendous effort has been devoted to the development of materials and morphological structures that facilitate enhanced device performance. Recently, encouraging progress has been made with regard to enhancements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells, with over 8% PCE values having been reported.4–7
The operating principle of BHJ solar cells is based on photo-induced charge transfer and separation between semiconducting polymers and soluble fullerenes.8 After charge separation, created holes and electrons must move to the anode and cathode so as to generate photocurrents. However, a BHJ mixture has no prior symmetry breaking in its volume due to the different frontier molecular energy levels and work functions (WFs) of the electrodes. Therefore, in order to induce an efficient drift of charge carriers, a symmetry breaking condition is essential in BHJ solar cells.
In conventional single solar cells, symmetry breaking is simply created by the different WFs of the electrodes. Indium tin oxide (ITO, WF = 4.7 eV) is normally used as an anode (transparent electrode) in such devices. Therefore, the use of a metal with a WF lower than that of ITO can induce sufficient symmetry breaking. However, the selection of a suitable metal for the cathode is not simple. Low WF metals such as Ca and Mg are not stable in air, which limits the lifetime of devices. On the other hand, the use of air-stable noble metals such as Ag (WF = 4.7 eV) and Au (WF = 5.1 eV) leads to poor device performance because their high WF induces reverse symmetry breaking.
Up to now, symmetry breaking has been emphasized only in inverted solar cells. In inverted solar cells, it is often preferable to use Ag as an anode metal. However, because Ag has a WF similar to that of ITO, symmetry breaking is not spontaneously created. Thus, an additional functional layer that induces symmetry breaking must be used in inverted solar cells.9–11 Since symmetry breaking was thought to be created spontaneously in conventional solar cells through the use of different WF metals, the role of symmetry breaking is not often considered.
In this communication, we describe our investigation of the importance of symmetry breaking in BHJ solar cells with a conventional device structure. Titanium suboxide (TiOx) was used as the material that induces symmetry breaking. Since TiOx exhibits selective charge transfer properties (hole blocking and electron transferring),4,12,13 artificial symmetry breaking is built up during charge transport. In addition, various cathode metals (Al, Ag, and Au) were used to explore the effects of the TiOx symmetry breaking layer.
Shown in Fig. 1a is a schematic diagram of the device structure together with the chemical structures of the active materials, poly[N-9″-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric methyl ester (PC71BM). The TiOx layer was prepared using sol–gel chemistry as described in detail elsewhere.12 Energy level diagrams of each component are displayed in Fig. 1b.

Shown in Fig. 2 are the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics obtained under illumination for PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells that were fabricated using either Al, Ag, or Au as the cathode with and without a TiOx symmetry breaking layer. For the solar cells without the TiOx layer, all parameters were significantly influenced by the WF of the cathodes, as shown in Fig. 2a. A variation of ∼0.5 mA cm−2 in the short-circuit current (Jsc) was confirmed via external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements obtained for each device (ESI†, Fig. S1). The fill factor (FF) of the Ag device (45%) was smaller than that of the Al device (50%), while the Au device exhibited the largest decrease in the Jsc and FF.

J–V characteristics of the PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells on various cathodes (a) without and (b) with a TiOx interlayer under illumination with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). 
The difference in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was particularly noticeable for the various cathodes; the Voc of the devices with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes were 0.82, 0.66, and 0.55 V, respectively. The device with an Al cathode (without the TiOx layer) exhibited a higher Voc than the Ag and Au devices, indicating the existence of a small electron barrier between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PC71BM (4.2–4.3 eV) and the WF of the Al.14,15 However, the use of Ag and Au cathodes yielded a low Voc due to the unaligned energy levels between the LUMO of the PC71BM and the high WF of the cathodes. Such a mismatch can lead to inefficient charge transport due to non-ohmic contact at the organic semiconductor/high WF metal interface. Eventually, the PCEs dropped from 3.98% with the Al electrode to 2.77% and 1.72% for the Ag and Au electrodes, respectively.
Relative to the control devices, the introduction of a TiOx symmetry breaking layer beneath the cathodes led to an increase in the Jsc from 9.72 to 10.5 mA cm−2 for Al, 9.32 to 10.1 mA cm−2 for Ag, and 9.2 to 9.5 mA cm−2 for Au. Similarly, the FF improved from 0.50 to 0.63 for Al, 0.45 to 0.55 for Ag, and 0.34 to 0.40 for Au. In addition, the Voc ranged from 0.81 to 0.84 eV for the solar cells with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes and a TiOx layer (Fig. 2b). The Voc is thus independent of the cathode WF, while the Jsc and FF of the devices with TiOx/Ag and TiOx/Au are inferior to those of the device with TiOx/Al. It is likely that insufficient electrical contact is made with the Ag or Au cathode and thus, a high contact resistance exists at the interface between the LUMO of the PC71BM and the modified WF of the TiOx/Ag and TiOx/Au. Nonetheless, improvements in the PCEs of all devices incorporating a TiOx layer were observed up to 5.56% for TiOx/Al, 4.55% for TiOx/Ag, and 3.15% for TiOx/Au relative to those of the control devices (without an interlayer).
The dark J–V characteristics of the devices with and without an interlayer were also examined in order to gain further insight into the effects of the metal WFs modified by the interlayer (ESI†, Fig. S2). The dark currents with the TiOx layer were significantly suppressed (<0.8 V region), implying a reduced leakage current. Such a positive effect can be attributed to the elimination of metal diffusion into the organic semiconductor layer from the cathode during thermal evaporation and a reduction in the probability of hole and electron recombination near the organic semiconducting/cathode interface.16,17 Thus, the reduction in the dark current via the introduction of a proper interlayer near the metal electrodes may increase the Voc. A similar increase in the Voc has also been reported in polymer BHJ devices utilizing various interlayers (such as LiF), metal oxides, and conjugated polyelectrolytes.11,18–21 One possible explanation for such an increase in the Voc is the reduction in the WF of the metals due to the formation of interfacial dipoles between the organic semiconducting materials and the metal electrodes.
In order to explore the influence of an inserted TiOx layer on energy level alignment, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, which have been used to probe the interfacial properties induced by dipole formation.22,23 The normalized UPS spectra for TiOx/Al, TiOx/Ag, and TiOx/Au films, where Al, Ag, and Au were used as a reference, are shown in Fig. 3. The Fermi energy (EF) was determined from the Au surface and all other spectra were plotted with respect to this value. The obtained WFs for Au, Ag, and Al were 4.90, 4.72, and 3.78 eV, which are different from the commonly cited values of 5.1, 4.6, and 4.2 eV, respectively.24–26 It is well known that the WF of a metal can be changed by carbon and oxygen contamination at the surface.27,28 After TiOx deposition, the shifts in the vacuum levels (VLs) between the TiOx and the metals changed significantly (the VL of the samples was determined by linear extrapolation of the secondary electron cutoffs on the high binding energy side (14–19 eV)). The shift in the VLs is indicative of the magnitude of the interfacial dipole (Δ).22,23,27,28 The observed values of the interfacial dipole and modified WF are summarized in Fig. 3b. The strongest interfacial dipole was observed for the TiOx/Au interface, while the TiOx/Al interface exhibited the weakest dipole. Although the WF of TiOx/Al (3.5 eV) was 0.3 eV smaller, the WFs of TiOx/Au and TiOx/Ag were almost constant (3.89 eV and 3.86 eV, respectively). It is thus suggested that a reduction in the WFs through the introduction of a TiOx layer causes an increase in the Voc.29,30

(b) Schematic energy levels of TiOx/Al, TiOx/Ag, and TiOx/Au films with an interfacial dipole (Δ); Evac: vacuum level, EF: Fermi level, ϕ = work function. 
The solar cell parameters and results from dark current and UPS measurements are listed in Table 1. The shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) were obtained from the inverse slope near 0 V and the Voc in the dark current measurements, respectively. In Table 1, one can see that Rsh and Rs increased in the devices with a TiOx layer. Since the Rs is related to the saturation current density and TiOx is known to be a hole blocking material,31,32 the reduction in current corresponds to inefficient hole accumulation and an increase in the Rs. In addition, the insertion of a TiOx layer increased the Rsh due to the suppression of the leakage current, which is a requirement of a good solar cell. Therefore, the TiOx induced an interfacial dipole at the organic semiconductor/metal interfaces that modified the effective WFs and improved the contact at the interface. Thus, devices with a larger Voc and PCE were obtained.

The WF dependence of the Voc and schematics of the energy levels for the devices in this work are shown in Fig. 4.

In the absence of an interfacial dipole, the Voc scales linearly with the WF difference. It is generally believed that the Voc is determined by the energy level difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor (see Fig. 4b).33,34 However, our results indicate that the Voc tends to be strongly correlated with the WF of the cathode. In Fig. 4a, the presence of an interfacial dipole due to the TiOx leads to a slope that is almost zero. Such a result is attributed to a Voc that is constant regardless of the cathode WF and is in agreement with the relationship Voc ≈ HOMO (donor) − LUMO (acceptor). It is worth noting that the Fermi level of the TiOx is pinned close to that of the LUMO of the PC71BM and the Voc can be independent of any of the cathodes with a WF lower than the LUMO of PC71BM.
The effect of a symmetry breaking layer is more critical in inverted solar cells. In order to confirm that the observed results are general, we have applied a TiOx symmetry breaking layer on an inverted solar cell fabricated using other semiconducting polymers poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric methyl ester (PCBM). Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics obtained under illumination for inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells that were fabricated with and without a TiOx symmetry breaking layer (ITO/with or without TiOx/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag). The result obtained from the device with conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiOx/Al is also included for comparison. For the inverted solar cell without the TiOx layer, since we used Ag which has a similar WF to ITO as an electrode, no symmetry breaking was created, thereby showing significantly decreased photovoltaic parameters. However, a comparison of inverted solar cell characteristics between the devices with the TiOx layer and without the TiOx layer clearly indicates that the insertion of a TiOx layer yields an increase in both Jsc and Voc approaching those obtained from the solar cell with conventional structure. Therefore, we concluded that the inserted TiOx layer led to symmetry breaking, thereby enhancing photovoltaic properties similar to the PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells.

In summary, we demonstrated a correlation between the Voc and the WF of the electrode by introducing a TiOx symmetry breaking layer. The TiOx leads to the formation of an interfacial dipole at the organic semiconductor/metal interfaces that modifies the effective WFs and improves device performance. Among the several photovoltaic parameters, the Voc was most strongly influenced by symmetry breaking. However, with sufficient symmetry breaking, the influence of the cathode WF on the Voc can be effectively reduced. Therefore, establishing sufficient symmetry breaking is one of the most important factors for extracting a maximum Voc and fabricating highly efficient BHJ solar cells, regardless of whether a conventional or inverted structure is utilized.
