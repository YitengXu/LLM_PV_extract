    , Accepted 8th March 2013First published on 8th March 2013AbstractEfficiencies of up to 8.5% for dye-sensitized solar cells employing a ruthenium dye with a cobalt complex redox mediator have been achieved, by using octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA) as a coadsorbent. This success is due to improved electron injection and reduced recombination.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ∼12.3% when employing Co(III/II) polypyridyl redox mediators in conjunction with bulky organic or porphyrin sensitizing dyes.1 This recent progress means that now Co(III/II) complexes are the most successful alternatives to conventional I3−/I− mediators. Earlier work has made it clear that the combination of relatively small Ru complex dyes (N719 and N3) with Co(III/II) mediators shows very poor performance.2 This is due to fast recombination of TiO2 electrons with relatively small Co(III/II) complexes, or sluggish mass transport if bulky complexes are used to slow down recombination.2a,3 The recent success has led to acknowledgement of the role bulky dyes play in efficiently suppressing recombination, which has inspired more work on designing new organic dyes for use with Co(III/II) mediators.4
Although the combination of organic and porphyrin dyes with Co(III/II) mediators yields the highest DSC performance to date, so far no stability data have been published, despite it being known that organic dyes often suffer from poorer photostability compared to Ru dyes.5 Previous work has shown that, for Co(III/II) mediators, bulky Ru dyes such as Z907 (Fig. 1) yield much better performance than N719 and N3 due to greatly suppressed recombination, probably because of steric hindrance by the alkyl chains.1c,6 We reported an efficiency of 6.5% for DSCs using the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ mediator in conjuction with the Ru dye Z907, which is comparable to that achieved by some newly designed organic dyes.6a Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that organic dyes are intrinsically more suited for use with Co(III/II) mediators, and thus it might be too early to completely transfer research focus away from Ru dyes, which still have some desirable properties. Instead, a deeper understanding of the problems existing with the present Co(III/II)–Ru system is needed, in order to further optimize the performance of this class of DSCs.

Here, we systematically modify the TiO2/dye interface using alkyl-phosphonic acid (PA) coadsorbents with different chain lengths, namely octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA) and decyl-phosphonic acid (DPA), at a range of different surface coverages, with the intention of reducing dye aggregation and blocking recombination. We report on a significant performance improvement in DSCs employing the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ mediator in conjunction with the Ru dye Z907 and an optimized PA coverage. UV-Vis spectroscopy, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) were used to elucidate the underlying reasons for the performance improvement.
Devices employing the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ mediator and Z907 co-grafted with various concentrations of OPA and DPA were fabricated (Experimental section). Current–voltage (j–V) characteristics and relative dye loadings (θ) determined by absorbance measurements are shown in Table 1. It is known that Z907 molecules adsorb onto the TiO2 surface via carboxylic acid groups, while OPA and DPA adsorb via the phosphonic acid group, as confirmed by FTIR measurements.7 Phosphonic acids generally show higher strength of adsorption than carboxylic acids on acidic metal oxides such as TiO2.8 Therefore, introduction of PAs is expected to greatly affect the monolayer assembly process, and thus the dye loading amount and overall photovoltaic performance.9

As shown in Table 1, the PA:Z907 concentration ratio in the dye bath strongly affects θ and PCE. The PCE of devices with PA:Z907 ratios higher than 1:10 is mainly limited by the very low θ and therefore low short-circuit current (jSC). For devices employing lower ratios, differences in PCE are mainly caused by modulations of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (ff), with jSC becoming quite insensitive to θ. The optimum OPA:Z907 ratio is around 1:20, which yields the highest PCE of 6.9%. jSC is even slightly, but reproducibly, higher than that of the pure Z907 cell, despite the 15% lower dye loading. In principle, this improvement could be caused by enhanced injection efficiency (ηinj) or charge collection efficiency (ηcol).
To quantify ηcol and ηinj in these devices, we have measured IPCE spectra with illumination incident on the electrolyte side (back) or the substrate side (front) of the devices at short circuit. Utilizing transmission and absorption coefficient spectra of individual cell components (e.g. dyed TiO2 layers, electrolyte solution, platinized FTO, etc.), back/front IPCE ratio spectra can be fitted with a diffusion-recombination model10 to obtain an effective electron diffusion length (Ln), from which the average ηcol applicable to front-side, AM 1.5G illumination can be calculated.11 Using Ln obtained from back/front ratio spectra, ηinj can also be estimated by fitting the individual IPCE spectra. In this analysis, it is assumed that dye regeneration is 100% efficient. This is supported by transient absorbance measurements monitoring the decay of the oxidized dye in the presence or absence of [Co(bpy)3]2+ for devices with or without coadsorbents (ESI†). Representative fits to the IPCE data for the pure Z907 device are shown in Fig. 2, alongside fitted Ln, ηcol and ηinj values for devices with optimized PA concentrations.

The dotted line indicates the maximum obtainable back/front IPCE ratio, given by the back/front light harvesting efficiency ratio (ηlh,b/ηlh,f), corresponding to very long electron diffusion length and a charge collection efficiency of unity. The inset shows fitted diffusion length (Ln), charge collection efficiency (ηcol) and injection efficiency (ηinj) values for devices employing pure Z907 or optimized OPA and DPA coverages. 
It is clear from the IPCE analysis that incorporation of PAs significantly improves ηinj. This might be expected if PA molecules substitute weakly adsorbed dye molecules and/or break up aggregates that do not contribute to the photocurrent as much as strongly adsorbed dye molecules.9,12 This phenomenon was also observed in I3−/I− based devices by several other groups who gave similar explanations.13 In principle, it is also possible that ηinj is modulated by shifts in the TiO2 conduction band (CB) energy; however, such CB shifts were found to be negligible based on the analysis of IS results to be presented shortly. Incorporation of an optimal amount of OPA or DPA also results in an increase or a slight decrease in Ln, respectively, although these changes are close to the detection limit of the back/front IPCE analysis and translate into relatively minor differences in ηcol. The differences in Ln most likely arise from changes in recombination kinetics, which will be investigated in more detail later using IS. In summary, improvements in both ηcol and ηinj contribute to the superior photocurrent of devices with an optimum concentration of OPA, despite lower dye loading.
To investigate the effect of PAs on the TiO2 CB energy, and on interfacial recombination kinetics, we have performed IS measurements on devices at open circuit with a range of PA coverages. The dependence of TiO2 chemical capacitance (Cμ) on VOC for these devices is plotted in Fig. 3a, in order to estimate the relative CB energies.14 The close coincidence between the plots indicates that almost negligible CB shift is induced by coadsorption of PAs with Z907. This result is slightly surprising considering that PA adsorption is expected to be accompanied by protonation of the TiO2 surface, which should shift the CB edge downwards, as found in I3−/I− based DSCs.13 Presumably in the present case, adsorption of other species (e.g. Li+ and H+ already present in the electrolyte) is more important in determining the interfacial energetics, due to the very different electrolyte composition used here. Based on these results we do not expect the driving force for electron injection to be affected by coadsorption of PAs and, therefore, we attribute the observed improvement in ηinj to reduced dye aggregation.
 Fig. 3  (a) Dependence of recombination resistance (Rrec) and TiO2 chemical capacitance (Cμ) on VOC measured under illumination for devices using various concentrations of PAs in the dye bath. (b) Dependence of Rrec and Cμ on Vbias measured in the dark for devices using pure Z907, OPA and DPA. 
The dependence of recombination and transport resistance (Rrec and Rt) on VOC is also shown in Fig. 3a. Since Cμ and Rtvs. VOC plots are in such close coincidence, the differences in Rrec at any given VOC can be interpreted as evidence for differences in recombination rate constant between the devices.14 The same trends are also found in the VOC data in Table 1 (i.e. higher Rrec corresponds to higher VOC). As CB energies are almost identical for all devices, the recombination driving force should also be the same. Therefore, the change in rate constant brought about by varying PA coverage is likely to arise from different degrees of shielding of the TiO2 surface from [Co(bpy)3]3+. At the optimized OPA:Z907 ratio of 1:20, Rrec is nearly 3–4 times higher than that of the pure Z907 device, in reasonable agreement with the increase in Ln (Fig. 2), which should increase with the square root of the relative increase in Rrec;15 further increasing the OPA:Z907 ratio to 1:2 causes a small decrease in Rrec. For devices with an optimized DPA:Z907 ratio of 1:40, Rrec is very similar to that of the pure Z907 device; further increasing the DPA:Z907 ratio to 1:2 leads to a 2–3 fold decrease in Rrec.
At any given dye loading (indicative of PA coverage), Rrec for OPA modified devices is much larger than for DPA modified devices. This suggests that OPA more efficiently blocks recombination than DPA, probably due to greater attenuation of electronic coupling between TiO2 electrons and [Co(bpy)3]3+ species by its longer alkyl chain. The reason for the initial increase in Rrec with increasing PA coverage, followed by a decrease in Rrec upon further increasing PA coverage is, however, less obvious. If OPA and DPA are assumed to block recombination more effectively than Z907, as implied by the data at low PA coverage, then Rrec would be expected to continue to increase as PA coverage is further increased. However, IS measurements on TiO2 layers coated with pure OPA and DPA monolayers (Fig. 3b) reveal that for both PAs Rrec is lower than that of layers coated with pure Z907, proving that the PAs alone do not block recombination as effectively as Z907. This could arise if the average monolayer thickness for the PAs is less than that for Z907, due to differences in molecular size (Fig. 1), imperfect monolayer coverage and/or collapse of the long alkyl chains.16 At sufficiently low PA coverage, we speculate that the PAs mainly fill voids in the Z907 monolayer while still maintaining a high Z907 coverage, leading to an increase in Rrec. Beyond the optimum concentration, excessive replacement of Z907 molecules with PA molecules leads to a thinner average monolayer thickness, counteracting the beneficial effect of filling voids in the dye monolayer and causing an overall decrease in Rrec. This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 4.

(b) Optimized PA coverage; voids filled with PA, minimal substitution of Z907 by PA, increased average monolayer thickness. (c) Excessive PA coverage; decreased average monolayer thickness. 
To demonstrate the best performance of devices using [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and the Z907 dye, we have carefully optimized devices by fine tuning the OPA:Z907 ratio near the aforementioned optimum of 1:20, adjusting the TiO2 film thickness and applying a scattering layer to improve light harvesting. The j–V characteristics of optimized devices with and without OPA are shown in Fig. 5. The highest PCE achieved for devices with OPA under full sunlight is 8.5%, which has been the highest reported to date for devices using a Co(III/II) mediator in conjunction with a Ru dye. Furthermore, PCEs of up to 9.1% are obtained under 0.15 Sun illumination, which shows that these devices are also promising for lower light applications (e.g. indoors).

In conclusion, the performance of DSCs using [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ together with the Ru dye Z907 has been significantly improved by employing OPA as a coadsorbent. A maximum PCE of 8.5% was achieved under full sunlight. The effect of coadsorbents on electron injection and recombination was investigated with the aid of IPCE and IS measurements. Both OPA and DPA improve ηinj, while only OPA significantly retards recombination compared to the pure Z907 device, due to a longer alkyl chain and correspondingly more pronounced steric hindrance effects. IS results indicate that the improvement in ηinj does not arise from an increase in injection driving force caused by a CB shift, pointing to reduced dye aggregation as the main cause. An unexpected decrease in Rrec was observed when PA coverage exceeded a certain threshold. A plausible explanation for this is that the average thickness of the PA/Z907 monolayer at high PA coverage is thinner than that at low PA coverage, either due to the smaller molecular size of PAs compared to Z907, or due to the collapse of the long alkyl chains of the PAs. At optimum PA coverage, the beneficial effect of filling voids in the dye monolayer outweighs the detrimental effect of excessive substitution of Z907 molecules, leading to a high PCE for devices using a Ru dye and Co(III/II) mediators.
Experimental
Electrode preparation and cell fabrication procedures followed previous reports.6a Optimized devices employed double layer TiO2 films comprising of ∼6 μm transparent layers (Dyesol, DSL 18-NR) and 2 μm thick light scattering layers (WER-O paste, Dyesol). Devices used for back/front IPCE measurements and IS measurements did not employ TiO2 light scattering layers. A reflective metal film was attached to the back of devices during j–V measurements, but not for back/front IPCE measurements. Devices were aged in the dark for two days before all measurements, which was found to improve the reproducibility. The electrolyte solution contained 0.2 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.02 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The pure Z907 dye solution was 0.3 mM Z907 in 1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol. For the mixed dye solutions, varying concentrations of OPA and DPA were added to 0.3 mM Z907 solutions to form the various concentration ratios. The Co complexes [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 and [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) were synthesized according to a previously reported procedure6a and other chemicals were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. Device characterization was performed using equipment and procedures described in detail elsewhere.6a,11b,17

 	Fig. 2  Representative front-side IPCE (ηIPCE,f) and back/front IPCE ratio (ηIPCE,b/ηIPCE,f) spectra for a pure Z907 device. Solid lines are fits of a diffusion–recombination model to the data. The dotted line indicates the maximum obtainable back/front IPCE ratio, given by the back/front light harvesting efficiency ratio (ηlh,b/ηlh,f), corresponding to very long electron diffusion length and a charge collection efficiency of unity. The inset shows fitted diffusion length (Ln), charge collection efficiency (ηcol) and injection efficiency (ηinj) values for devices employing pure Z907 or optimized OPA and DPA coverages.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Dependence of recombination resistance (Rrec) and TiO2 chemical capacitance (Cμ) on VOC measured under illumination for devices using various concentrations of PAs in the dye bath. (b) Dependence of Rrec and Cμ on Vbias measured in the dark for devices using pure Z907, OPA and DPA.	 

 	Fig. 4  Illustration of shielding of the TiO2 surface from [Co(bpy)3]3+ species by PA and Z907 molecules. (a) Pure Z907 layer with voids and weakly bonded dye molecules. (b) Optimized PA coverage; voids filled with PA, minimal substitution of Z907 by PA, increased average monolayer thickness. (c) Excessive PA coverage; decreased average monolayer thickness.	 

 	Fig. 5  AM 1.5G 1 Sun j–V characteristics for optimized devices employing an OPA:Z907 concentration ratio of 1:18 and 6 μm TiO2 transparent layers equipped with 2 μm scattering layers. The inset shows the photovoltaic parameters measured at 1 Sun and 0.15 Sun.
