    , Accepted 13th May 2018First published on 14th May 2018AbstractA perovskite material CsAg2Sb2I9 was developed by dissolving CsI, AgI and SbI3 in DMF (molar ratio 1:2:2). CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cells gave a power conversion efficiency of 0.99% and a fill factor of 67.1%. The morphology of a CsAg2Sb2I9 film was affected significantly by the CsI content in the precursor solution.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted broad interest in recent years.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8% in 20092 to 22.7% in 2017.3 The research on PSCs focuses on crystallinity, interfacial engineering, device architectures and large-area fabrication.4–9 Though perovskite materials (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) demonstrate excellent photovoltaic performance, lead toxicity10 and poor device stability11 are the major issues of lead-based PSCs for commercialization. Currently, many research groups are developing lead-free photovoltaic materials.
Sn was used as a substitute for Pb in most lead-free PSCs since Sn has similar properties to Pb. However, Sn-based PSCs suffered from easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and uncontrollable crystallization, which resulted in poor film quality and unsatisfactory stability.12–17 Bismuth and antimony are promising substitutes for Pb because of their lower toxicity than Pb. Johansson et al. used (MA)3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 as the absorbers and afforded PCEs of 0.12% and 1.09%, respectively.18 Ag3BiI6 solar cells gave a PCE of 4.3%.19 MA3Sb2I9 gave a PCE of 2.04% when HI was added, and Cs3Sb2I9 gave a PCE of 0.84% under the same conditions.20 More recently, Zhou et al. added MACl into MA3Sb2I9 and obtained a 2D layered phase, obtaining a PCE of 2.19%.21 In our previous work, (NH4)3Sb2I9 was used as the active layer and a PCE of 0.51% was obtained with a high open-circuit voltage (1.03 V).22
There are many theoretical prediction on double perovskite materials as alternatives for Pb-based absorbers in PSCs.23–25 Double perovskite materials possess advantages, such as good phase stability, tunable optoelectronic properties, and low exciton binding energies.25 Bein et al. prepared Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite thin films for solar cells and obtained a PCE of ∼2.5%.23 However, Cs2AgBiBr6 has an indirect bandgap, and it is not suitable for solar cells.24 The theoretical calculation on double perovskites by Zhang et al. helps us to find suitable absorbers for solar cell application.25 According to the crystal structure of Cs2AgSbI6, Ag+ or Sb3+ occupies the center of the octahedron formed by I−, alternatively, and Cs+ occupies the center of eight octahedra. They suggested that Cs2AgSbI6 with a direct bandgap of 1.68 eV could be a promising material for lead-free PSCs.25
In this work, CsAg2Sb2I9, as a new compound and crystal, was designed and developed. The crystal structure, absorption and morphology were studied. Its film absorbs 315–800 nm light. The film morphology was affected significantly by the CsI content in the precursor solution. CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cells gave a PCE of 0.99% with a fill factor of 67.1%.
The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI, AgI, and SbI3 in dimethylformamide (DMF). However, it was somewhat difficult for AgI to dissolve in DMF without CsI. The CsAg2Sb2I9 film was obtained by spin coating the precursor solution onto the substrates without post-annealing. The optical properties of CsAg2Sb2I9 films were studied by UV-vis (Fig. 1a). The film absorbs 315–800 nm light. The Tauc plot is shown in Fig. S1.† The CsAg2Sb2I9 film presents a direct bandgap of 1.96 eV.

Fig. 1b presents the XRD patterns for CsI, AgI, and SbI3 powders and the CsAg2Sb2I9 film prepared with a molar ratio of 1:2:2 (CsI:AgI:SbI3). No diffraction peaks for CsI, AgI and SbI3 was observed in the XRD patterns of the CsAg2Sb2I9 film, indicating that the target compound was formed. Fig. S2† presents the XRD patterns for films prepared with other ratios, 0.4:2:2, 0.8:2:2, 1.2:2:2, 1.6:2:2, 2:2:2 and 4:2:2. For ratios 0.4:2:2 and 0.8:2:2, AgI diffractions at 23.6° were observed, suggesting that the excessive AgI mixes with CsAg2Sb2I9. For the ratio 0.4:2:2, the diffraction at 29.4° might arise from Cs3Sb2I9.26 When increasing CsI content above the ratio 1:2:2, the patterns are nearly the same, indicating that higher CsI content will not affect the formation of the CsAg2Sb2I9 crystal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm CsAg2Sb2I9 formation (Fig. S3†). In the survey spectrum, the characteristic peaks for Cs, Ag, Sb and I show at 724 eV, 368 eV, 540 eV and 619 eV, respectively.

Fig. 2 presents SEM and AFM images for the CsAg2Sb2I9 films prepared with a molar ratio of 1:2:2. The film is quite uniform with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 6.2 nm. SEM and AFM images for the films prepared with other molar ratios are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† Clear grains can be seen in the films with a molar ratio above 0.4:2:2. For a molar ratio of 0.8:2:2, RMS roughness is 11.4 nm, and there are many voids which can lead to contact between PEDOT and a metal electrode and increase the leakage current. For a molar ratio above 1:2:2, the film uniformity decreases remarkably. Reviewing the XRD patterns, SEM and AFM images, we think that the CsI content in the precursor solution could affect the morphology of the CsAg2Sb2I9 film significantly.

The solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsAg2Sb2I9/PC61BM/Al were made to study the effect of CsI content on the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 3a and b). The device performance data are listed in Table 1. The optimal molar ratio of CsI:AgI:SbI3 is 1:2:2. When the molar ratio goes above 1:2:2, the PCE decreases with the increase of CsI content. The optimized thickness of the CsAg2Sb2I9 layer is 104 nm (Table S1†). PCE decreased with the increase of the annealing temperature (Table S2†). The best CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cell gave a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 1.91 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 67.1%, and a PCE of 0.99% (Fig. 4a). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum for the CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cell shows photoresponse at 300–650 nm, yielding an integrated photocurrent of 1.80 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b). The J–V curves for the CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cell present hysteresis (Fig. S6†), which could result from non-ideal interfaces, traps in the CsAg2Sb2I9 layer and I− migration.23 The Jsc stability for the best cell was studied, and the result suggested that the cell was relatively stable in minutes (Fig. S7†). After being stored in a glovebox for 13 days, the PCE retained ∼66% of the initial value (Fig. S8†).
