    , Accepted 3rd October 2022First published on 4th October 2022AbstractThe ultrahigh optical absorption coefficient of AgBiS2 has been achieved by atomic periodic engineering of AgS6 and BiS6 octahedrons. Furthermore, strong dielectric constant modulation and direct band gap of tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 are obtained, which enable a high spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency of 29.7% at an ultrathin thickness of 100 nm.
High efficiency, low cost and eco-friendly solar cells are highly demanded. However, current photovoltaic materials do not meet the requirements simultaneously, either having toxic elements like lead or cadmium,1–3 or using rare metals like indium (CIGS4), or requiring high-temperature fabrication (silicon5). The ternary chalcogenide AgBiS2 has emerged as one of the most promising candidates6,7 owing to its tunable bandgap,8 high absorption coefficient,9 non-toxicity,10 earth-abundant elements,11 and solution-processing.12 In particular, one of the key advantages of AgBiS2 solar cells is their ultrathin absorber thickness,6,9,12–14 which allows their application in flexible and wearable devices.
In general, ultrathin absorption layers can only be employed unless having high absorption capability. To improve the absorption capability, atomic structure engineering has been developed to modulate the optoelectronic properties of AgBiS2. One of the most efficient strategies is cation disorder engineering,8,9,15 referring to the deviation of Ag and Bi atom positions from their sites in an ordered crystalline structure, which substantially alters the electronic properties and thereafter has a remarkable effect on the optical absorption coefficient. Recently, mild temperature mediated homogeneous cation disorder engineering has been demonstrated to dramatically improve the absorption coefficient. The resulting current density and efficiency reach values as high as 27mAcm−2 and 9.17% at an ultrathin thickness of 30 nm, respectively. Furthermore, a spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of 26% is predicted.15 However, no other methods have been reported to further improve the absorption coefficient beyond the cation disorder engineering.
In this report, we proposed an atomic periodic engineering method, in contrast to the cation random strategy, to modulate the electronic band structure and optical absorption capability of AgBiS2. The dynamically unstable metallic AgBiS2 (denoted as tetra-P4/mmm) can be transformed into a dynamically stable indirect semiconductor (trigon-Rm) by inserting a layer of AgS6 octahedrons into the alternatively arranged BiS6 octahedrons. Furthermore, it can be converted into a metastable direct semiconductor (tetra-I41/amd) via rotating the AgS6 octahedrons by 90 degrees with respect to the BiS6 octahedrons. Small carrier effective masses and low exciton binding energies are predicted simultaneously. In contrast to cation disorder engineering, the atomic scattering is periodically arranged, which exhibits an improved absorption coefficient in the solar spectrum wavelength range, leading to a SLME as high as 29.7% with an ultrathin thickness of 100 nm.
The crystal structures of AgBiS2 are made up of edge- and corner-sharing AgS6 and BiS6 octahedrons that are arranged in a complex manner. Three typical crystals of AgBiS2 with distinct electronic band structures are constructed and displayed in Fig. 1. We begin from the dynamically unstable metallic structure to demonstrate how the electronic band structure evolves with respect to the arrangement variation of the AgS6 and BiS6 octahedrons (Fig. 1a), where the BiS6 octahedrons share four edges with adjacent neighbours. According to the side view (Fig. 1d), AgS6 octahedrons are located in the cavities formed by BiS6 octahedrons. The formation energy of the metallic structure is used as a reference to compare structural stability between the proposed structures. Fig. 1b shows the crystal structure of an indirect bandgap semiconductor, where the BiS6 octahedrons are tilted to share six edges with neighbours and form a layered structure. The AgS6 octahedrons are titled accordingly and alternatively sandwiched between two BiS6 layers (Fig. 1e), which leads to a trigonal crystal with the space group of Rm. The formation energy of the indirect bandgap semiconductor is 0.104 eV per atom lower than that of the metallic tetragonal P4/mmm AgBiS2, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). However, since phonons are required to assist light absorption, indirect bandgap is not favourable for solar cells. Interestingly, AgBiS2 can be modulated into a direct semiconductor (tetra-I41/amd) via rotating the AgS6 octahedrons by 90 degrees with respect to BiS6 octahedrons. To form the direct bandgap, BiS6 octahedrons need to share three edges with neighbours and intertwine with AgS6 octahedrons, as presented in Fig. 1c and f. The formation energy of AgBiS2 with direct bandgap (tetra-I41/amd) is 0.059 eV per atom lower than that of metallic P4/mmm and 0.045 eV per atom higher than that of trigon-Rm AgBiS2, which indicates a metastable state among the three proposed structures, and it can exist after high temperature annealing.

The electron localization function (ELF) has been investigated to characterize the level of electron localization and the bonding type. Cores, bonds and lone pairs are highlighted in the EFL plots. The colour variation between Bi and S atoms in tetra-P4/mmm AgBiS2 can be clearly observed in Fig. 2a, which indicates the electron localization. The colour variation between Ag and S atoms is relatively weak, which represents the delocalized distributions. In the line profile of the ELF (Fig. 2b), two different Bi–S and Ag–S bond lengths are labelled. The EFL value reaches the maximum and minimum near the atomic nuclei (Bi and S) and the non-nuclear region, respectively, which is an indication of covalent bonding. The ELF near the nucleus of the Ag atom is zero, indicating the complete delocalization of the valence electron.

The ELF of trigon-Rm AgBiS2 shows similar features to that of the tetra-P4/mmm AgBiS2 (Fig. 2c and d), which suggests that they have the same bonding characters. However, since the ELF between Ag and S atoms is more localized in tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 (Fig. 2e), a larger ELF near Ag nuclei is observed in the corresponding line profile (Fig. 2f). Additionally, the Ag–S bonding in tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 exhibits partial ionic features.
To compare the thermodynamic stability of the proposed AgBiS2 structures, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed for 5 picoseconds (ps) at a temperature of 300 K with the NVE ensemble. Besides, the phonon dispersion calculations are also performed to evaluate the dynamic stability. The corresponding results are plotted in Fig. 3. According to the extracted energy and temperature during the molecular dynamics simulations, it is found that trigon-Rm AgBiS2 exhibits the lowest variation (Fig. S1b, ESI†), tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 shows a moderate variation (Fig. S1c, ESI†), and tetra-P4/mmm AgBiS2 exhibits the largest variation (Fig. S1a, ESI†), which suggest that the trigon-Rm indirect semiconductor is the dynamically most stable structure, the tetra-I41/amd direct semiconductor is a metastable structure, and metallic tetra-P4/mmm is the most unstable structure. The molecular dynamics simulation results are consistent with the formation energy obtained in the static calculation (Table S1, ESI†). Additionally, the pair correlation function (PCF) is employed to evaluate the atom distance in the crystal structure, where clear peaks are observed for tetra-P4/mmm (Fig. 3a) and trigon-Rm AgBiS2 structures (Fig. 3c), which is an indication of the periodic layer crystal structure. The inset snapshot of the corresponding crystal after molecular dynamics simulations confirms their stability. In contrast, the PCF of tetra-I41/amd shows fewer peaks and a broad feature for the second nearest neighbours at five times the radius (Fig. 3e), which originates from the intertwined AgS6 and BiS6 octahedrons rotated by 90 degrees. The inset shows the structure snapshot after the dynamics simulation, which also confirms the thermodynamic stability. More information can be found in the phonon dispersion calculation, and three imaginary modes exist for the metallic tetra-P4/mmm (Fig. 3b), which means the dynamic instability. In comparison, no imaginary mode is observed for the indirect Rm semiconductor (Fig. 3d), and a slight imaginary mode around the Γ point is observed for the direct I41/amd structure, which indicates this structure is dynamically unstable at 0 K but possibly exists at elevated temperature, similar to that of CsPbI3, which also has imaginary phonon modes.

Since the fundamental electronic structure plays a key role in setting the lowest energy cut-off of the photon that can be absorbed, the hybrid exchange correlation function HSE06 + SOC is used to calculate the electronic properties (Fig. 4). Tetra-P4/mmm AgBiS2 is demonstrated to be a metallic structure without bandgap (Fig. 4a), whose valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (VCM) are mainly dominated by the wavefunction of the sulphur atom (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c presents the band structure of trigon-Rm AgBiS2 with an indirect band gap of 1.118 eV, which is rather close to the bandgap of silicon (1.12 eV). The valence electrons from sulphur and bismuth contribute to the VBM and CBM, respectively (Fig. 4d). The band structure of tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 is displayed in Fig. 4e and f, where a direct band gap of 0.972 eV at the M point is predicted. In addition, the corresponding density of states (DOS) at the band edge is much higher than that of trigon-Rm AgBiS2, indicative of stronger optical absorption. Similar to trigon-Rm AgBiS2, the VBM and CBM of tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 are dominated by sulphur and bismuth, respectively. A large dielectric constant is favourable in solar cells due to the efficient screening which reduces carrier scattering and trapping by charged defects and impurities.16 Table S2 (ESI†) summarizes the calculated static dielectric constant, effective carrier mass and Wannier–Mott exciton binding energy of the semiconducting AgBiS2. It is found that both of the trigon-Rm and tetra-I41/amd structures have different dielectric constants in different directions, which stem from their anisotropic crystal nature. As tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†), the large dielectric constant of AgBiS2 is dominated by the ionic contribution, except for the XX/YY direction where the ions and electrons contribute equally in tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2. The coulomb interaction between electrons and holes is strongly suppressed by the large dielectric constant. The Wannier–Mott exciton is predicted with a binding energy less than 2 meV, which is favourable in solar cells.

The yellow and green colours represent the contours of |ψVBM|2 and |ψCBM|2, respectively. 
To demonstrate the outstanding properties of the proposed structures, AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) have been exploited to fabricate ultrathin solar cells by the Konstantatos group.9 The typical device structure is illustrated in Fig. 5a, which consists of ITO/FTO, SnO2, AgBiS2, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), and Ag from bottom to top. The SQ limit is calculated to compare the maximum power conversion efficiency that can be achieved. Fig. 5b shows the comparison of the SQ limit among our proposed trigon-Rm and tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2, and common photovoltaic materials, such as GaAs, Si and CdTe. The results show that all of them have a SQ limit efficiency more than 30%. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient and the SLME are also calculated to evaluate their potentials for solar cells. The absorption coefficient is calculated at the RPA theoretical level17 and plotted in Fig. 5c. For the AgBiS2 candidates, the XX/YY component of the absorption coefficient is used for comparison because of the anisotropic nature of the crystal structure. The ZZ component is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is found that AgBiS2 has a larger absorption coefficient than GaAs in the solar spectra from 0.31 eV to 4.96 eV, corresponding to the wavelength from 250 nm to 4000 nm. Particularly, tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 exhibits obvious larger absorption capability in the range of 0.9 eV to 3 eV due to the lower band gap. In Fig. 5d, the SLMEs of GaAs, trigon-Rm and tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 are calculated to show their potentials in ultrathin high-performance solar cells. An efficiency of 29.7% can be obtained for tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 with an ultrathin absorber thickness of 100 nm. While 20.3% can be obtained for trigon-Rm AgBiS2, only 17.3% can be obtained for GaAs with identical thickness. The predicted SLME is even higher than that of AgBiS2 with cation disorder (26%).9 Different from the cation disorder engineering of AgBiS2, the tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 proposed in our work has a crystal structure, where the BiS6 and AgS6 octahedrons are periodically intertwined with each other rotated by 90 degrees. The BiS6 and AgS6 octahedrons can significantly modulate the imaginary part of the dielectric constant of the material. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), several strong peaks can be observed for tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2, which may result in strong scattering in the atomic scale that enhances the optical absorption, while only weaker peaks are identified for trigon-Rm AgBiS2.

In summary, we provided an alternative method to modulate the electronic band structure and optical absorption capability of AgBiS2 beyond cation disorder engineering. The results demonstrate that by using periodically intertwined BiS6 and AgS6 octahedrons rotated by 90 degrees, the direct electronic bandgap of tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 with enhanced optical absorption capability, small carrier effective masses and low exciton binding energies can be obtained simultaneously. The calculated SLME of tetra-I41/amd AgBiS2 can reach 29.7% with an ultrathin thickness of 100 nm, which is much larger than that of GaAs with identical thickness.
