    , Accepted 18th November 2021First published on 18th November 2021AbstractMXenes have gained rapidly increasing attention owing to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structures and unique mechanical and physicochemical properties. However, MXenes have some intrinsic limitations (e.g., the restacking tendency of the 2D structure) that hinder their practical applications. Transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materials such as SnS, NiS, MoS2, FeS2, and NiSe2 have attracted much interest for energy storage and conversion by virture of their earth-abundance, low costs, moderate overpotentials, and unique layered structures. Nonetheless, the intrinsic poor electronic conductivity and huge volume change of TMC materials during the alkali metal-ion intercalation/deintercalation process cause fast capacity fading and poor-rate and poor-cycling performances. Constructing heterostructures based on metallic conductive MXenes and highly electrochemically active TMCs is a promising and effective strategy to solve these problems and enhance the electrochemical performances. This review highlights and discusses the recent research development of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures, with a focus on the synthesis strategies, surface/heterointerface engineering, and potential applications for lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. The critical challenges and perspectives of the future development of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures for electrochemical energy storage and conversion are forecasted.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) materials with a monolayer or a few layers of elements in a plane geometry have aroused tremendous interest because of their particular physicochemical properties, e.g., the ultra-thin structure, high degree of anisotropy, and adjustable energy-band structure.1–3 2D materials are widely applied in electronic devices, optoelectronic devices, electrochemical storage, catalysis, sensors, and chemical adsorption, owing to their unique electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties.4–10 Recently, plenty of atomically thin materials beyond graphene, such as MXene, silicene, germanene, phosphorene, and transition metal dichalcogenides, have been developed.11–16 In particular, MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been regarded as a promising member of the 2D material world.15–20 In general, MXenes demonstrate the formula Mn+1XnTx, where M is a transition metal, X is carbon/nitrogen, and T is the termination group (i.e., –OH, –O, and –F). MXenes are generated through selectively etching A from the MAX phase.21,22 In the MAX phase, the Mn+1Xn and A layers are alternately connected, forming the layered hexagonal structure.23 The etching and exfoliation processes can promote the surface functionalization of MXenes with abundant –OH, –O, and –F groups, leading to the hydrophilic nature. Owing to the free electrons of the Mn+1Xn skeleton and the surface groups, MXenes demonstrate good electronic conductivity and hydrophilicity, leading to their wide applications including batteries, capacitors, catalysts, sensors, adsorption, and water purification.24–32 Because of the variability of the transition metals and termination groups, the properties of MXenes can be adjusted via choosing proper transition metals and X elements and tailoring the surface chemistry.
However, direct exploitation of MXenes for energy storage and conversion is unsatisfactory because of the restacking tendency and aggregation of the 2D structure. To solve these issues, MXenes are usually hybridized with other active materials (e.g., MoS2 and MoSe2) to form hierarchical MXene-based heterostructures. The hybridization not only prevents the restacking of MXenes by other active materials but also facilitates the performance of the heterostructures. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) such as SnS, NiS, MoS2, FeS2, NiSe2, MoSe2, and SnSe2 have spawned great interest on account of their abundance on earth, low costs, moderate overpotentials, and unique layered structures.33–37 Moreover, TMCs with layered structures allow the intercalation of guest ions without significant distortion in the layered structure.38–40 For example, as a typical TMC material, SnSe2 has been widely utilized as the anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).41,42 The adjacent Se layers are interconnected through van der Waals interactions in hexagonal layered SnSe2. It can facilitate the intercalation/deintercalation of cations in layered SnSe2, leading to an ultra-high theoretical capacity via Li+ intercalation.43 Nevertheless, the low conductivity and huge volume change of TMC materials including SnS, SnS2, CoSe, NiSe2, and MoSe2 during the Li+ intercalation/extraction process cause fast capacity fading, poor-rate performances, and short cycle lives.44–48
To solve these problems and obtain excellent properties, constructing heterostructures based on the metallic conductive MXenes and highly electrochemically active TMCs is a promising and effective strategy.49–53 MXenes with layered structure can provide a stable conductive network and relieve the huge volume change of TMCs in the heterostructure. Meanwhile, the TMC component could prevent the restacking of 2D MXene layers, provide more active sites, and facilitate electrochemical reactions. The synergistic effect of the MXene and TMC components could significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of the hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures. Ma et al. investigated the heterostructures of TMCs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) and Sc2CF2 MXene monolayers through using density functional theory (DFT) computations.54 Compared with bare TMCs and Sc2CF2 monolayers, the Sc2CF2/TMC heterostructures possessed bandgaps of 0.13–1.18 eV, indicating an indirect semiconductor. Furthermore, compressing/stretching could enlarge/reduce the bandgaps of the Sc2CF2/TMC heterostructures.
Although there have been some reviews on MXenes, most of them focus on the fabrication and applications of MXenes.21,55,56 There are few reviews on constructing hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Herein, we will summarize the recent advances of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures in the electrochemical energy storage- and conversion-related applications, as shown in Fig. 1. In the following sections, we will start with a brief introduction to the synthesis strategies of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures, followed by a summary of their surface/heterointerface engineering. Afterwards, we will discuss and highlight their advantages in the electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications, e.g., LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. Finally, we will cover the potential challenges and future opportunities of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures.

2. Synthesis strategies of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures
To date, there are plenty of different MXenes that have been synthesized via selectively etching from ternary metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitride (a MAX phase) precursors.21 MXenes are most commonly synthesized through selective etching of A atoms from original layered MAX (Fig. 2).14,57–60 In the transformation of MAX to MXenes, the etched layers are replaced by the termination groups such as –OH, –O, or –F, to form layered materials consisting of Mn+1XnTx multilayers interconnected with van der Waals bonds. The termination groups in MXene structures can enable high hydrophilicity of the MXene sheets. Particularly, the different synthesis routes for a specific type of MXenes can influence the physicochemical properties of the obtained MXenes and their related applications.61,62 According to previous reports,53,63–70 the hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures are always synthesized through a two-step synthesis strategy including the synthesis of MXenes and subsequent growth of TMC structures on MXenes. In general, the synthesis methods of MXenes can be classified into HF etching, F-based salt etching, molten salt etching, and intercalation/delamination. Subsequently, the TMC structures are grown on or between the MXene sheets. As mentioned in Tables 1–3, there are plenty of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC synthesized through various routes.

2.1 HF etching
MXenes are often generated via selectively etching of A atoms in MAX phases. Typically, Ti3C2Tx (i.e., Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2(OH)2) is fabricated through selectively etching the Al atoms in the Ti3AlC2 phase.17 When aqueous HF is used as the etchant, the reactions occur as below. Ti3AlC2 + 3HF = Ti3C2 + AlF3 + 3/2H2(1) Ti3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2(2) Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2(3)
Reaction (1) is extremely important and followed by reaction (2) or (3), which takes place simultaneously. Reactions (2) and (3) can introduce different termination groups of –OH and –F, leading to the hydrophilic property and more active sites in the 2D-layered structure. The as-obtained MXene samples are composed of multilayer sheets interconnected via weak interlayer interactions. The ultrasonic-assisted exfoliation of the as-obtained multi-layered samples can generate few-layer MXene nanosheets. Furthermore, this HF solution etching method has been used to fabricate plenty of MXenes including V2CTx,71 V4C3Tx,72 Nb2CTx,73 Nb4C3Tx,74 Ta4C3Tx,75 Ti2NTx,20 Ti3CNTx,75 Ti2CTx,76 W1.33CTx,77 Mo1.33CTx,78 and Mo2TiC2Tx.79
Once MXenes are synthesized through selective etching the A atoms of the MAX phase in the HF solution, the obtained MXene sheets can further form composites with TMC nanostructures.63,65,69,72,80–82 For example, Bai et al. first fabricated the V4C3Tx MXene through immersing the V4AlC3 phase in a 40% concentrated HF solution for 96 h at 55 °C.72 Subsequently, the MoS2 was grown on the V4C3Tx surface through solvothermal reactions using (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O as the Mo source, resulting in a hierarchical V4C3Tx/MoS2/C nanohybrid. Huang et al. synthesized Ti3C2Tx nanosheets through selectively etching the Al atoms of Ti3AlC2 in an HF solution at 60 °C for 12 h.81 Then, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were utilized as substrates to anchor MoS2 nanosheets through a facile hydrothermal process, generating the hierarchically layered MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure.
Gogotsi's group used concentrated HF acid to selectively etch the Al layers in the Mo2TiAlC phase. Then, the as-prepared multilayer Mo2TiC2Tx was then sonicated under Ar flow (Fig. 3a).63 Afterwards, the layered MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx heterostructure was generated through the sulfurization process at 500 °C under Ar flow. The heating treatment of the S/Mo2TiC2Tx composite under Ar flow could transform Mo–O motifs into MoS2 on the Mo2TiC2Tx surface, resulting in the layered MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx heterostructure (Fig. 3b–d).

Li and co-workers first dissolved Ti3AlC2 in a 40% HF solution to selectively etch the Al atoms from Ti3AlC2 and prepare the Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets.83 Then, the prepared Ti3C2Tx was transferred into TiO2@Ti3C2Tx through a hydrothermal reaction at 160 °C. Finally, the 1T-WS2 was grown on the TiO2@Ti3C2Tx substrate via a hydrothermal process, resulting in the 1T-WS2/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure. Recently, Li et al. first fabricated Ti3C2Tx sheets through selective etching in a 45% HF solution under stirring.64 Then, SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid particles were decorated on Ti3C2Tx through a facile solvothermal and calcination process. Huang et al. synthesized the Ti3C2Tx through selective etching the Al layers from Ti3AlC2 in a 48% HF solution under stirring and ultrasonic treatment.65 Subsequently, MoSe2 was in situ grown on the Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate to form a three-dimensional (3D) MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx nanoflower composite for the electrocatalytic reaction. Meanwhile, Chen et al. first generated Ti3C2Tx by using a 30% HF solution to selectively etch the Al atoms from Ti3AlC2.66 Then, the WSe2 powder was exfoliated into few-layer WSe2 by immersing in a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution under sonication at 4 °C for 10 h. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx and WSe2 solutions were mixed under stirring for 2 h to generate the Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 heterostructure via electrostatic interaction.
2.2 F-Based salt etching
Although HF is usually utilized as a selective etchant in the synthesis process of the MXenes, HF is harmful to the environment. To address this issue, new strategies utilizing harmless etchants (e.g., lithium fluoride (LiF)) have been developed.24 For example, Sun et al. dispersed Ti3AlC2 in a safer mixture of a LiF solution and concentrated HCl acid under stirring at 35 °C to synthesize the Ti3C2Tx MXene.84 From the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 4a), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 4b), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. 4c), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 4d and e), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Fig. 4f) images of the Ti3C2Tx MXene, it could be found that the obtained Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are lamellar and flexible with few defects. It was attributed to the existence of H+ and F− ions in the solution of HCl and LiF. Later, Li et al. also prepared the Ti3C2Tx MXene structure through dissolving Ti3AlC2 in concentrated HCl solution-containing LiF, followed by heating at 40 °C for 45 h.24 To date, plenty of Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets have been fabricated via selective etching of Ti3AlC2 powder in the mixture of LiF and HCl solutions.85–89

Reproduced with permission.84 Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. 
Furthermore, other acids (e.g., H2SO4) and salts containing F− (e.g., sodium fluoride (NaF) and potassium fluoride (KF)) are also utilized to synthesize MXenes.90 To date, various MXenes including Ti3C2Tx,91 V2CTx,92 Mo2CTx,93 W1.33CTx,77 and Cr2TiC2Tx79 have been synthesized through using mixture acid solutions containing F-based salts.
Compared with the HF etching process, the etching process in the solutions of F-based salts (e.g., LiF and NaF) can lead to the intercalation of cations and water, and then increase the spacing between adjacent MXene layers and weaken their interaction. The as-prepared MXene can be delaminated without additional steps after being washed to a pH value of ∼6 to fabricate single- or few-layer sheets.94 The larger interlayer spacing can be more conductive to the growth of TMC structures on or between the MXene sheets.
The hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures have been constructed on the MXene substrates by using selective etching of MAX phases in an acid solution containing F-based salts.67,68 For example, Huang et al. first fabricated Ti3C2Tx through selective etching the Al layers in a solution of HCl and LiF at 35 °C.67 Then, the layered MoSe2 was grown on the conductive Ti3C2Tx substrate via the hydrothermal reaction, followed by coating carbon layer, resulting in a MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx@C heterostructure. Shen et al. selectively etched the Al atoms and exfoliated the Ti3AlC2 phase to few-layer Ti3C2Tx in the solution of LiF and HCl.68 Subsequently, abundant MoS2 nanoparticles were decorated on the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets via a simple solid-state sintering process, forming an MoS2-decorated Ti3C2Tx heterostructure. Furthermore, Halim et al. utilized an NH4HF2 solution to selectively etch the Ti3AlC2 for different time, forming various Ti3C2Tx sheets with thicknesses of 15, 28, 43, and 60 nm.95 It was found that the Ti3C2Tx nanosheet etched using NH4HF possessed a larger c lattice constant than that etched using HF.
2.3 Molten salt etching
Aqueous acidic solution etching process could not completely remove the A layers in the nitride-base MAX phases because of the more energy for extraction and lower stability of Tin+1Nn.59 In contrast to the methods mentioned above, some MXene sheets have been synthesized through selective etching of Al atoms from the MAX phase by LiF, NaF, and KF. Pioneeringly, Gogotsi and coworkers utilized a mixture of molten fluoride salts containing LiF (29 wt%), KF (59 wt%) and NaF (12 wt%) to etch the Al atoms from a Ti4AlN3 precursor at 550 °C under an Ar atmosphere. Then, they further delaminated the obtained MXene to produce few-layer Ti4N3Tx nanosheets.96 The obtained bare Ti4N3 and terminated Ti4N3Tx were predicted to be metallic according to the DFT calculations.
Molten salt etching for A-group elements such as Al, Si, Ga, and Zn96–99 can open doors for new transition metal compositions and structures of MXenes. Molten salt treatments of MXenes have induced either uniform or removed surface functionalities and expanded the available termination chemistries. Huang et al. synthesized MXenes with exclusively chlorine terminations (Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti2CCl2) through etching MAX phases in ZnCl2 molten salts.97 This Lewis-acidic-melt etching method can adjust the surface terminations and electrochemical properties of MXenes and be extended to various systems because of the wide range of constituents of Lewis-acidic melts. Li et al. fabricated several Zn-based MAX phases (Ti3ZnC2, Ti2ZnC, Ti2ZnN, and V2ZnC) and Cl-terminated MXenes through the replacement reaction between the Al element in MAX-phase precursors (Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, and V2AlC) and the Zn element from molten ZnCl2.99 By employing excessive ZnCl2 salt, Cl-terminated MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti2CCl2) were fabricated after the molten salt etching and subsequent exfoliation of Ti3ZnC2 and Ti2ZnC because of the strong Lewis acidity of molten ZnCl2. The obtained Cl-terminated MXenes were expected to be more stable than the F-terminated MXenes.

In addition, various polar organic molecules, i.e., hydrazine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), urea, and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), have been intercalated into the MXene sheets.53,69,70,80,100–102 Intercalation of these unique molecules into MXenes, followed by magnetic stirring and ultrasonication, can generate mono-layer or few-layer MXene sheets. For example, Mashtalir et al. intercalated hydrazine and N,N-dimethylformamide into the Ti3C2Tx in a solution of hydrazine and N,N-dimethylformamide under magnetically stirring for 24 h.103 The c lattice constant of functionalized f-Ti3C2Tx increased to 26.8 Å, owing to the existence of N2H4 molecules among the MXene interlayers. To construct the Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure, Liu et al. used HF to selectively etch the Al atoms from the Ti3AlC2 precursor and further delaminate the Ti3C2Tx sheets intercalated with TBAOH.53 Then, the MoS2 sheets were grown on the MXene surface via solution reactions, sonication, and freeze-drying. Later, Wu et al. used the TBAOH solution to intercalate TBAOH into the Ti3C2Tx flakes and delaminate the MXene structure, which were pre-treated by an HF solution to selectively etch the Al atoms from the Ti3AlC2 phase.69 Subsequently, the obtained Ti3C2Tx was used as a substrate to anchor SnS2 nanoplates through a hydrothermal method, yielding a sandwich-like Ti3C2Tx/SnS2 heterostructure.
Later, Song and co-workers immersed Ti3AlC2 in the NH4HF2 solution to selectively etch the Al atoms in Ti3AlC2.104 Interestingly, the c lattice constant of this prepared Ti3C2Tx increased to ∼2.49 nm, while the interplanar spacing was larger and more stable. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the cations (NH4+) adsorbed on the negative surface originating from the surface functional groups. The cations could adjust the lattice parameter and increase the interlayer spacing of the MXene sheets.
Guided by this strategy of enlarging the interlayer spacing of MXenes, Gogotsi and co-workers first used HF acid to selectively etch the Al atoms in the Nb2AlC phase, forming the Nb2CTx sheets.100 Then, the obtained Nb2CTx was immersed in the TBAOH solution to increase the interlayer spacing between different Nb2CTx layers. Recently, Xu et al. immersed the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx sheets in the DMSO solution to further increase the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2Tx.70 The Ti3C2Tx sheets with enlarged interlayer spacing could load more MoSe2 nanoparticles among the MXene layers. Moreover, the V2CTx MXene could be intercalated and delaminated by using an organic base to weaken the interaction between MXene sheets.105
To increase the interlayer spacing in MXene sheets, alkali metal ion (e.g., Li+, Na+, and K+) intercalation is also utilized during the synthesis process of the MXene sheets.106,107 In order to further increase the interlayer distance of the Ti3C2Tx MXene, Luo and co-workers utilized sodium ions as pillars during the synthesis process.106 The Na+-pillared Ti3C2Tx (Na-Ti3C2Tx) with enlarged interlayer distance could increase the active site concentration and reduce the diffusion barrier of Na+ and charge storage in Ti3C2Tx. The incremental interlayer distance of Na+-pillared Ti3C2Tx could be attributed to cation solvation and the existence of water molecules between Ti3C2Tx layers. Later, Osti et al. intercalated K+ into the Ti3C2Tx interlayers.107 The intercalation of K+ could yield a more homogeneous Ti3C2Tx layer structure than pristine Ti3C2Tx. The K+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx possessed more ordered crystalline domains and larger interlayer distance. Therefore, the K+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx could accommodate more alkali metal ions and small molecules between the individual Ti3C2Tx layers.
Based on the above discussion, there are several synthesis methods (HF etching, F-based salt etching, molten salt etching, and intercalation/delamination) of the MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures. These synthesis routes can guide the direct construction of hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures based on rational design of fabrication routes, precursors, and substrates. Generally, the etching synthesis methods are simple and convenient, while the MXene sheets fabricated using the top-down synthesis strategy possess plenty of defects and abundant functional groups on the surface. The defects and functional groups on the surface of MXene sheets can benefit the growth of TMCs on the MXene sheets. On the other hand, the MXene sheets synthesized through intercalation/delamination demonstrate larger interlayer spacing and more sites for hybridizing with TMCs. The intercalated/delaminated MXenes can accommodate more metal ions or small molecules between the individual MXene layers, which would be more favorable for the storage of alkali metal ions and transportation of small molecules in the MXene and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures.
3. Surface and heterointerface engineering of hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures
According to previous reports, the performances of MXenes are mainly decided by their electronic structures and physicochemical properties.56 Particularly, the metal atoms (M) determine the electronic properties of the MXene sheets. For instance, the pure MXene (Tin+1Xn) shows metallic conductivity but doesn't possess photocatalytic activity owing to the zero-bandgap.108 Then, in order to adjust the electronic structures and physicochemical properties of MXenes, various efforts including modification and constructing heterostructures have been made.109–112
3.1 Surface termination modification
Since MXenes are mostly fabricated through selectively etching the A element from MAX in corrosive solutions, the MXene surfaces are exposed with termination groups, i.e., –F, –OH, and –O. Therefore, the termination groups are crucial to elucidating their roles in affecting the electronic structures, physicochemical properties, and structure stability of MXenes. The –OH termination group is unstable and can be transferred into the –O termination group when MXenes are calcinated at a high temperature.113 Generally, –O, –OH, and –F groups can co-exist on the MXene surface, offering a variety of surface terminations and the corresponding physicochemical properties.
Lai's group investigated the role of termination groups Tx on 2D Ti2CTx MXenes.108 One kind of 2D Ti2C(OH)xFy was obtained through selectively etching the Al element from Ti2AlC and subsequent exfoliation of bulk Ti2COx in an HF solution (Fig. 5a–c), while another kind of Ti2COx was fabricated through annealing the exfoliated 2D Ti2C(OH)xFy (Fig. 5d and e). During the calcination process, the chemically adsorbed water and –OH group were removed first. With the temperature further increased, the immediate Ti2COxFy started losing F, resulting in the Ti2COx with a layered structure. The component of termination groups could be further adjusted through calcination. While the surface group was –F, the Ti2CTx would generate a non-zero bandgap. When the surface termination group was transferred from –F to –OH, the bandgap value of Ti2CTx increased from 0 to 0.243 eV. Therefore, the surface termination functional groups could efficiently influence their electronic structures and physicochemical properties.

Later, Gogotsi and co-workers resolved the crystal structures of various Ti3C2Tx MXenes through the atomic pair distribution function and high-quality neutron total scattering.114 The intensity of interlayer hydrogen bond was determined by the orientation of –OH group and the content of –OH, –O, and –F groups. Moreover, the van der Waals forces caused the bonding interaction. Therefore, the polar molecules could easily decrease the interlayer hydrogen bond among the MXene sheets, leading to the formation of few-layer MXenes and construction of hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures.
3.2 Heterointerface engineering
Apart from the termination group modification, constructing heterostructures could also adjust the electronic structures and optimize the physicochemical properties of MXenes. The element doped into MXenes can regulate the electronic structures and physicochemical properties of MXenes.115–119 For instance, Bao and co-workers introduced N heteroatoms into Ti3C2Tx nanosheets through an annealing N-doping strategy.115 The crumpled N-doped Ti3C2Tx could increase the specific surface area, porosity, and polysulfide adsorption capability as the S host in Li–S batteries. This N-doped Ti3C2Tx electrode demonstrated good capacity and stable cycling performance. Sun et al. synthesized self-designed S-decorated Ti3C2Tx through a solution soaking method with electrostatic attraction.116 The obtained S-decorated Ti3C2Tx could store more Na+ ions owing to the sulfur groups and rapid ion diffusion paths in the 2D Ti3C2Tx layers.
Then, constructing binary transition metal MXenes (i.e., Mo2TiC2Tx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx) could adjust the electronic structures and enhance their performances.120 Anasori and co-workers studied the electronic structures and physicochemical properties of ordered binary transition metal MXenes, such as Mo2TiC2Tx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx.120 The obtained Mo2TiC2Tx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx were certified as semiconductors with narrow bandgap, while pure Ti3C2 was a metal-like conductor.
Furthermore, hybridizing MXenes with TMCs could adjust the physicochemical properties of MXenes.63,69,112,121,122 For example, Chen and co-workers constructed 2D/2D MoS2-on-MXene heterostructure via sulfurization of Mo2TiC2Tx.63 This 2D/2D MoS2-on-MXene heterostructure with high conductivity could promote lithium and lithium sulfide adsorption upon cycling. Tie et al. synthesized MXene/Ni3S2 heterostructure on 3D Ni foam as a self-supporting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst.122 The 3D porous MXene network could improve the electronic conductivity and provide more redox reaction sites when Ni3S2 could act as spacers to hinder the restacking of the MXene layers. Therefore, this prepared MXene/Ni3S2 heterostructure catalyst demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance toward HER.
Recently, to further facilitate the intrinsic conductivity of the MXene/TMC heterostructure, Cao et al. constructed a ternary Cu1.75Se-MXene-CNRiB heterostructure consisting of 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, Cu1.75Se nanoparticles, and N-rich carbonaceous nanoribbons (CNRiB) via an microbe-assisted self-assembly and a subsequent selenization process (Fig. 6a).123 The MXene Ti3C2TX nanosheets were synthesized through an HF etching following by a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) intercalation/delamination process. The positively charged Cu1.75Se nanoparticles were anchored on the electronegatively hydroxy functionalized MXene surfaces through electrostatic adsorption, while the fungal-derived CNRiB bonded with the other side of MXene through amino bridging and hydrogen bonds, forming a “Janus” sandwiched interfacial effect of MXene (Fig. 6b). The unique Cu1.75Se-MXene-CNRiB heterostructure can prevent the restacking of 2D nanosheets, provide highly ultrafast interfacial electron/ion transport pathways and abundant active surface sites and extra charge storage interfaces, leading to high Na+ storage capacity of 536 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.

4. Applications of hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures
After the introduction of background, synthesis strategies, and heterointerface engineering of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures, we now move to their energy storage and conversion-related applications including batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysis. Recently, the advanced technology of environmental protection and energy storage has attracted much attention because of the energy environmental crisis and the demand for renewable energy sources and electric vehicles. Owing to the 2D layered structure, high conductivity, unique mechanical property, variability of transition metals and termination groups, MXenes can be hybridized with TMCs to form hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures with chemical and structural variability, which have been widely utilized in various applications including LIBs, SIBs, Li–S batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis.25,52,65,67,72,124–126 Herein, we first discuss the recent progress of the hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures applied in LIBs, SIBs, Li–S batteries, and supercapacitors as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Afterwards, we will highlight their promise in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as shown in Table 3.
4.1 Hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures for rechargeable batteries
Rechargeable batteries attract increasing attention because of the low cost, environmental friendliness, high energy density, and power density for electrochemical energy storage.127–131 Especially, LIBs are the most extensive form of energy storage in portable electronics and electric vehicles, which demand high capacity, low weight, and long cycling lives.128,131 The performances of rechargeable batteries are mainly determinate by the electrode materials. Various active materials including transition metal oxides (TMOs), nitrides, and TMCs have been employed as anodes in rechargeable batteries.129,132–135 Particularly, 2D materials are regarded as potential electrode candidates of rechargeable batteries owing to the large surface-to-volume ratio, short ion diffusion length, fast charge transport, and facilitated reaction kinetics. Particularly, MXenes as an extremely important member of 2D materials process metallic conductivity, low diffusion barrier for alkali metal ions, and small volume variation upon cycling.86,136,137 Therefore, the investigation and development of MXenes and their heterostructure composites as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries are continuously growing.

4.1.1 Lithium-ion batteries. 
Encouraged by the fast-growing demand for energy storage and environmental concerns, LIBs have received extensive attention.127,128 MXenes with 2D structure and good stability have been used as the electrode material in the LIBs.113,146,147 According to previous studies,113,148 the functional Ti3C2Tx (f-Ti3C2) monolayers demonstrate a predicted capacity of 320 mA h g−1, assuming Ti3C2Li2 stoichiometry in reaction (4). Ti3C2 + 2Li = Ti3C2Li2(4)
The interlayer spacing of the MXene sheet structure is a critical factor affecting the performance of the MXenes. The stacked MXene is further exfoliated to generate a delaminated MXene, which consists of a few layers or even a monolayer.103,149 The specific surface area is another key factor influencing the electrochemical performance of MXenes. The high specific surface area can be always generated through exfoliating multi-layered into few-layer or even mono-layer MXenes. Interestingly, the delaminated Ti3C2 (d-Ti3C2) demonstrated a much higher capacity of 410 mA h g−1 than f-Ti3C2.103 Hence, Kajiyama et al. fabricated Ti2CTx MXenes with steric chloride terminations and generated increased interlayer distance of MXene sheets.150 The larger interlayer distance could facilitate Li+ diffusion and provide more insertion sites, leading to the enhanced electrochemical performance.
According to recent reports, a V-based MXene V4C3Tx has been successfully fabricated through selective etching the V4AlC3 phase and it possessed large interlayer spacing.151,152 For instance, Zhou et al. first used the ball-milling treatment on a V4AlC3 precursor and then selectively etched the Al atoms of V4AlC3 in an HF solution, forming the 2D multi-layered V4C3Tx MXene.152 The obtained V4C3Tx MXene electrode demonstrated a good capacity of 225 mA h g−1 owing to its high surface area and large interlayer spacing (∼0.466 nm).
Although MXenes possess many advantages as anode materials, the electrochemical performances of MXene are still restrained by the tendency of aggregating or restacking of the nanosheet structure, which limits the ion diffusion and decrease the active sites for the Li+ insertion. To enhance the overall performances of MXenes, various strategies have been proposed to hinder the spontaneous restacking of 2D MXene sheets. One strategy is introducing interlayer spacers, such as porous carbon,153 carbon nanotubes,154 graphene,155 polymers,156 TMOs,102,157 TMCs,63,138 silicon,158 and P.159 The interlayer spacers can enlarge the interlamellar spacing, prevent the restacking of MXene sheets, and facilitate their electrochemical performance. Another strategy is integrating the 2D structures into 3D hierarchical structures160 and porous structures.134 The 3D hierarchical structures and porous structures can address the issues of poor charge transfer and restacking of the MXene sheets, thus significantly enhancing the electrochemical performances of the electrodes.
Among these strategies, constructing hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures can improve the specific surface area, increase the interlayer spacing, hinder the restacking of the MXene nanosheets, facilitate the fast charge transport kinetics, and buffer the volume expansion upon cycling. As a typical 2D layered TMCs material, MoS2 has been widely applied as a LIB anode, because of its high capacity and large interlayer spacing.161 However, the rate capability is hindered by the poor conductivity, huge volume expansion, and sluggish ion diffusion. By combining the advantages of TMCs and MXenes, the MXene/TMC hybrid structures can effectively improve the electronic conductivity, facilitate the Li+ ion transport, and relieve the volume expansion. For example, MoS2-in-Ti3C2 composites were fabricated through electrostatic adsorption and followed by a CTAB regulated growth.162 The prepared MoS2-in-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure with a MoS2 content of 50.3 wt% showed a superior capacity of 340 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1. Shen's group fabricated MoS2 nanoparticles decorated on Ti3C2Tx by using a simple solid sintering method.68 The MoS2 nanoparticles anchored on Ti3C2Tx could benefit the charge transport, prevent the aggregation tendency of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, and thus enhance the electrochemical performance of the MoS2-decorated Ti3C2Tx heterostructures.
Recently, Hu and co-workers synthesized MoS2/Ti3C2 hybrid through freeze-drying and thermal decomposition using (NH4)2MoS4 as the Mo source (Fig. 7a).138 From the TEM and EDS images (Fig. 7b–d), it could be found that the irregularly shaped MoS2 nanocrystals were anchored on the Ti3C2 surface. The lattice distance of ∼0.61 nm was related to the MoS2 (002) plane. The conductive Ti3C2 in the MoS2/Ti3C2 heterostructure could facilitate the charge transport kinetics, prevent the nanosheet restacking, and buffer the volume change of this MoS2/Ti3C2 heterostructure electrode upon cycling. Furthermore, 2D MoS2-decorated Ti3C2Tx MXene was constructed through a simple hydrothermal reaction.163 The prepared MoS2-decorated Ti3C2Tx heterostructure with an enlarged interlayer distance demonstrated a capacity of 355 mA h g−1 over 1300 cycles. Furthermore, a sandwich-like 3D conductive network was also constructed by growing MoS2 layers on the Ti3C2Tx matrix through a hydrothermal method.164

V4C3Tx, another 2D layered MXene, possesses larger interlayer spacing, higher capacity, and better structural stability as LIB anodes.152 To further enhance the electrochemical properties of the V4C3Tx MXene, Bai and co-workers fabricated a hierarchical V4C3Tx/MoS2/C nanohybrid via a hydrothermal reaction.72 In this V4C3Tx/MoS2/C heterostructure, plenty of few-layer MoS2 sheets were grown on the V4C3Tx surface. The nanosheet-constructed V4C3Tx/MoS2/C heterostructure could provide more active sites, enhance the charge transfer, hinder the restacking of the MoS2 and V4C3Tx nanosheets, and relieve the volume change upon cycling. Therefore, this obtained V4C3Tx/MoS2/C heterostructure possessed a high capacity of 623 mA h g−1 and superior rate capability. In addition, this V4C3Tx/MoS2/C anode showed pseudocapacitive characteristics in the charge storage process, owing to the hierarchical nanosheet-constructed structure.
SnS2 is a particular layered TMC structure composed of two closed-packed S atoms layers with Sn atoms between them, possessing superior theoretical capacity and a suitable redox potential as the LIBs anodes.165 To relieve the volume change and enhance the rate performance of SnS2 materials, Li et al. fabricated the SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid decorated on Ti3C2Txvia a simple solvothermal reaction followed by the calcination process.64 The layered Ti3C2Tx sheets could improve conductivity, relieve volume expansion, and hinder the aggregation of the SnS2/Sn3S4 nanoparticles, while the SnS2/Sn3S4 nanoparticles could also decrease the restacking tendency of the Ti3C2Tx sheets.
Similarly, SnS with high theoretical capacity suffers from huge volume expansion (∼300%), low electronic conductivity, and speedy capacity decay upon cycling.44 To solve these problems, Ai et al. synthesized a heterostructure of SnS nanoparticles anchoring on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets through electrostatic attraction using poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) to charge the Ti3C2Tx surface and facilitate the electrostatic attraction of [SnS3]2−.139 This SnS/PDDA-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure could efficiently facilitate the e−/Li+ transport and buffer the volume expansion, resulting in high capacity and excellent rate capability. Tang and co-workers synthesized Ti3C2Tx@C@SnS hybrids with layered stratum structure via a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent calcination.140 During the synthesis process, the carbon encapsulated SnS2 nanoparticles were in situ anchored on the Ti3C2Tx sheets. Subsequently, the SnS2 was reduced to SnS via calcination under the Ar atmosphere. The Ti3C2Tx@C@SnS heterostructure could facilitate charge diffusion and possess more active sites for Li+ insertion, while the carbon layer could improve the electronic conductivity.
Cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), a representative TMC material, has attracted much interest as LIB anodes.166 Nevertheless, the poor conductivity and huge volume change hinder the practical applications of CoSe2 anodes. To solve these problems, Hong et al. coated Ti3C2Tx sheets on the surface of hollow CoSe2 microspheres (CoSe2@Ti3C2Tx) through a simple electrostatic self-assembly method.167 The hollow CoSe2 microspheres were fabricated by the selenization of Co-MOFs based on the Kirkendall effect. The MXene sheets could enhance the electronic conductivity, while the strong chemical interaction (Co–O–Ti covalent bonds) at the interface between CoSe2 and oxygen functionalized Ti3C2Tx could facilitate the charge transport kinetics and improve the cycling performance.
Generally, the electrochemical performances of MXene and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures in the LIB application can be tuned by many factors including surface termination groups, interlayer distance, and composition. Developing MXenes with different metal species, larger interlayer distance, suitable surface termination functional groups, and excellent electronic conductivity can effectively enhance the Li+ intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of the MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures. Moreover, hybridizing MXene with certain TMC materials with high capacity can synergistically improve the overall performance.


4.1.2 Sodium-ion batteries. 
SIBs attract much interest as a promising alternative of LIBs, owing to the abundant Na resources.168 Nevertheless, exploring proper SIB anodes with superior performance is still a challenge. 2D materials with lamellar structure can facilitate the Na+ diffusion and offer more reactive sites.169 Therefore, the 2D materials including graphene, MXenes, and TMCs are promising alternate electrodes for high-performance SIBs.25,170–172 For example, Lian and co-workers prepared alkalized Ti3C2Tx nanoribbons through alkalization treatment in a KOH solution.25 The obtained alkalized Ti3C2Tx demonstrated high capacity of 168 and 84 mA h g−1 at 20 and 200 mA g−1, respectively, owing to the facilitated reaction kinetics, enlarged interlayer distance, and 3D porous frameworks.
Although MXenes possess metallic conductivity, controllable surface functional groups, and layered structure, their electrochemical performances are still hindered by the restacking tendency of MXene sheets and limited theoretical capacity.173 The sodium storage capability of MXene sheets depends on the synthesis conditions and termination groups. Although TMCs possess high theoretical capacity, the poor conductivity and huge volume change of TMC electrodes during the cycling process hinder their applications.174 Thus, constructing hierarchical TMC/MXene heterostructures can be a promising strategy to break through this restriction. For the in-depth study of TMC/MXene heterostructures, plenty of efforts have been made in both theoretical calculations and experiments.25,51,175 For instance, Tang et al. constructed various heterostructures of MoS2 and V2S with various MXenes (M = Ti, V, Nb, or Mo, X = C, and ene = bare or O) to simulate and investigate their potential applications as SIBs anodes through DFT and VASP calculations.51 Among various TMC/MXene heterostructures, the heterostructure of VS2 with an O-terminated MXene could store two layers of Na+ on the surfaces and one layer of Na+ inserted in the interlayers, leading to a high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, the Na+ diffusion barriers in the VS2/MXene heterostructure are extremely small, indicating the fast charge/discharge kinetics in the hybrid anode.
MoS2 has been widely used as SIBs anodes owing to its high theoretical capacity and large interlayer spacing for Na+ insertion.176 To overcome the drawbacks of the low capacity of MXenes as SIBs anode materials, Wu et al. constructed an MoS2/Ti3C2Tx composite to enhance the ion accessibility of MXene sheets through increasing the interlayer spacing and boost its specific capacity.177 In this MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure, the MoS2 nanosheets were intercalated between the Ti3C2Tx sheets through a hydrothermal process. The MXene sheets could provide high electronic conductivity, a low Na+ diffusion barrier, and good mechanical properties for the MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure, while MoS2 could provide more Na+ insertion sites. Du et al. fabricated an MoS2/Ti3C2Tx composite to combine the merits of the Ti3C2Tx layers and MoS2 nanosheets.141 In this hierarchical MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure, the MoS2 nanosheets were anchored on the Ti3C2Tx layers, which could increase the interlayer spacing of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, provide more active sites, and improve the electronic conductivity.
SnS, in which each Sn atom is coordinated with six S atoms, is a potential SIB anode owing to its low cost and high capacity.178 But it is still hindered by the poor conductivity and large volume change upon cycling.179 Constructing SnS nanoparticles with conductive MXene sheets is a promising route to improve the electronic conductivity, buffer the volume change, and thus improve the electrochemical performance. Zhang and co-workers fabricated SnS/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure through a hydrothermal reaction and a subsequent annealing process.142 The SnS nanoparticles could increase the interlayer distance of Ti3C2Tx sheets and improve the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation capacity, while the Ti3C2Tx sheets could improve the conductivity, prevent the aggregation of the SnS nanoparticles, and relieve the volume change, leading to high capacity, excellent rate capability, and a superior cycling performance. Later, Qin et al. used wrinkled Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to confine the SnS nanocrystals with a size of ∼5 nm, resulting in a 3D SnS/Ti3C2Tx architecture.180 The 3D hierarchical architecture with more accessible surface sites could facilitate the charge transfer, while the Ti–S bonds at the SnS/T3C2Tx interface could enhance the structural stability and buffer the volume change.
SnS2 possesses a layered structure consisting of two layers of S atoms with Sn atoms between them and demonstrates high theoretical capacity of ∼1136 mA h g−1.181 But the SnS2 anodes suffer from the huge volume change and inherent poor conductivity. Constructing heterostructure based on the metallic conductivity of MXenes and high Na+ storage performance of SnS2 can effectively eliminate the inherent limitations of SnS2 electrodes. To enhance the electronic conductivity of SnS2 and hinder the restacking of MXene layers, Wu et al. synthesized a layered MXene/SnS2 heterostructure through vacuum-assisted filtration (Fig. 8a).69 In the MXene/SnS2 hybrid anode (Fig. 8b–d), the MXene sheets could provide a stable conductive framework and buffer the volume change of electrode upon cycling, while SnS2 nanoplates could prevent the aggregation of the MXene nanosheets, offer more Na+ insertion sites, and accelerate the reaction kinetics.
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic illustration of synthesizing the MXene/SnS2 heterostructure through vacuum-assisted filtration, (b) SEM image of the pure MXene, and (c) TEM image and (d) HRTEM image of the MXene/SnS2 heterostructure. Reproduced with permission.69 Copyright 2020, Elsevier. 
Cobalt sulfide (CoS) is regarded as another promising SIB anode because of its high capacity and low cost.182 Unfortunately, the poor conductivity and huge volume expansion hinder its electrochemical performances. Decreasing the size of CoS structures and hybridizing with highly conductive materials like MXenes can effectively enhance their electrochemical performances.183,184 Zhang et al. fabricated CoS nanoparticles with a size of ∼6 nm on Ti3C2Tx sheets (CoS/Ti3C2Tx).143 The Ti3C2Tx sheets could form a conductive framework to increase the conductivity and prevent the aggregation of the CoS nanoparticles, while the CoS nanoparticles could hinder the Ti3C2Tx sheets from restacking and provide more active sites.
Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) possesses a proverbial layered structure and is regarded as a potential SIB anode with high capacity.185 However, Bi2S3 suffers from poor conductivity and huge volume changes, resulting in cracking pulverization of the Bi2S3 electrode.186 To overcome these drawbacks, Yang et al. synthesized a Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx composite via a solution reaction and a subsequent freeze-drying process.89 Plenty of ultrasmall Bi2S3 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the MXene sheets. The Bi2S3 nanoparticles could prevent the stacking of the Ti3C2Tx sheets and retard the volume expansion during the cycling process, while the Ti3C2Tx sheets could increase the electronic conductivity. Therefore, the Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure showed excellent performances for SIBs.
Recently, a ternary iron phosphosulfide (FePS3) material with 2D layered nanostructure stacked by van der Waals has attracted increasing interest as a potential SIB anode because of its excellent capacity.187 But it still suffers from huge volume changes and polysulfide dissolution in the conversion reaction upon cycling, resulting in a poor cycling performance. To solve these problems, Ding et al. first obtained few-layer FePS3 through liquid-phase exfoliation of FePS3 bulk crystal and then synthesized the FePS3 nanosheets@Ti3C2Tx composite after the freeze-drying process.188 The 2D/2D FePS3@Ti3C2Tx hybrid could promote the charge transfer, prevent the MXene nanosheets aggregation, and buffer the volume expansion. Moreover, the 2D/2D FePS3@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure could provide a pseudocapacitive contribution to the overall electrochemical sodium storage.
Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) is constructed by 2D Se–Mo–Se atom layers and interconnected by van der Waals forces.189 The MoSe2 electrode is favorable for Na+ insertion owing to its large interlayer spacing of MoSe2 layers (0.64 nm). To improve the electronic conductivity and reduce the volume expansion, the hybridization of MoSe2 with other conductive matrices can be a promising and effective strategy. For example, Xu et al. fabricated MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure via a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent thermal treatment.70 The few-layer MoSe2 sheets were constructed on the Ti3C2Tx surface to generate MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx heterojunction in a loose state. The van der Waals force interaction between MoSe2 and Ti3C2Tx could facilitate the reaction kinetics and reduce the volume expansion during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. The Na+ diffusion barrier in Ti3C2Tx was calculated to be ∼0.066 eV using the DFT calculations, indicating the fast charge transfer of the MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure.
Similar to the issues in LIBs, the sodium ion storage performance of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures are decided by the factors such as material components, surface termination groups, interlayer spacing, and electronic conductivity. Since the sodium ion has a larger ionic radius than the lithium ion, the sodium ion diffusion coefficient is lower than that of the lithium ion. In order to enhance the sodium storage performance, MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures should possess higher reaction kinetics with Na+ and shorter ion diffusion length.


4.1.3 Lithium–sulfur batteries. 
Li–S batteries attract increasing attention because of the high energy density, natural abundance, and environmental friendliness.190 Nevertheless, their practical applications are still hindered by issues including the solubility of intermediate lithium polysulfides and poor cycling stability. To address these issues, various efforts including modulating cathode structure,191 modifying separators,192 and developing novel electrolyte additives193 have been made. The rational design of unique S hosts can effectively improve the utilization of active S and inhibit the polysulfide shuttling effect, thus achieve high-performance Li–S batteries. Some inorganic materials, such as transition metal oxides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides, and hydroxides, can effectively adsorb polysulfide intermediates, and maintain excellent electrochemical performances.190,194–197
In particular, MXenes can be used as promising S hosts for Li–S batteries.198,199 The metallic conductivity of MXenes could enhance the conductivity of the S cathode, while the termination groups can efficiently anchor the Li2Sxvia a strong Ti–S bond.115,200,201 For instance, Nazar and co-workers constructed the CNT-MXene composites under stirring in chlorosulfonic acid and then the suspension was filtered through anodic aluminum oxide membrane.200 The cleavage of the Ti–OH bond with the formation of thiosulfate and the strong Ti–S bond interaction could promote the interfacial interaction between the MXene and polysulfides. The hydroxyl moieties of the functionalized MXene were advantageous to the redox activity with polysulfides, which could form the thiosulfate/polythionate groups. The DFT calculation was consistent well with the experimental results. Furthermore, the CNTs in the MXene layers yielded porous conductive networks with high polysulfide adsorption, thus hindering the polysulfide shuttling across to the anodes. Therefore, the S/CNTs-MXene electrode demonstrated an excellent cycling performance. Later, Tang et al. fabricated S@Ti3C2Tx viscous aqueous ink and binder-free, robust, and highly electronic conductive films through a simple slurry casting.202 The conductive Ti3C2Tx matrix could enhance the electron transport and ion diffusion kinetics. The polar Ti3C2Tx could efficiently chemisorb the polysulfides and convert the polysulfides into thiosulfate and sulfate. The formed sulfate could retard the shuttling of the polysulfide intermediates upon cycling and improve the sulfur utilization. Moreover, an N-doped MXene has been fabricated to further improve the performance of MXene sheets.115
Among various MXenes, V2C with lower molecular weight possesses high electronic conductivity, a unique lamellar structure, and a high Li+ storage capacity of 940 mA h g−1, which make it a promising S host.197,203 Liang and co-workers studied the Li2S loading content, open-circuit voltage, and ion diffusion energy barrier on the V2CTx surface through the VASP calculation.203 The results showed that V2CO2 was the most suitable Li2S host material among the V2C, V2CO2, and V2CF2 materials, owing to the adsorption mode of S-bonding. The S-bonding could promote the stable adsorption of Li2S on the host surface. The energy barriers of Li+ migration on V2CO2 and V2C are 0.24 and 0.34 eV, respectively, indicating the fast Li+ migration on V2CO2 and V2C. Moreover, Wang et al. investigated the S-functionalized V2C (V2CS2) as an S host material.197 The V2CS2 could effectively restrain the shuttling of lithium polysulfides. The low energy barriers of Li+ diffusion could promote the phase transformation of lithium polysulfides and facilitate the reaction kinetics.
Although there are few reports about MXene/TMC heterostructures applied as S hosts in Li–S batteries, it can be predicted that constructing hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures will achieve good comprehensive performance. When the MXene sheets are hybridized with polarized TMC structures, the obtained MXene/TMC heterostructure can effectively adsorb the lithium polysulfides and dissolve the shuttle effect in the Li–S batteries, owing to the synergistic effect of the high conductivity and surface termination groups of MXenes and the strong affinity to polysulfides of TMC materials.


4.1.4 Other metal-ion batteries. 
To date, MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures have also been used as electrode materials in potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs), and zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), which show superior electrochemical performances.67,204,205 In particular, PIBs have attracted great interest because of the similar physicochemical properties of K with those of Li and Na, resource abundance, and low cost.206,207 The standard redox potential of K/K+ (−2.92 V) is close to that of Li/Li+ (−3.04 V) and lower than that of Na/Na+ (−2.71 V), showing the higher operating voltage and energy density of PIBs. Nevertheless, K+ has a larger radius than Li+ and Na+. Thus, it is not easy for electrode materials to accommodate K+ repeatedly. Furthermore, PIBs suffer from low electronic conductivity, sluggish K+ intercalation kinetics, large volume change, and rapid capacity fading upon cycling. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop a highly efficient electrode with enhanced K+ intercalation reaction kinetics. MXenes with 2D layered structures and abundant surface termination groups are favorable for the K+ intercalation reaction.
For instance, Er and co-workers studied the adsorption of K+ on Ti3C2Tx by using first-principles density functional calculations.208 The adsorption energy of K+ decreased when the coverage of K atoms increased. The calculated capacity of K+ ions on Ti3C2Tx was 191.8 mA h g−1. Meanwhile, Xie and co-workers investigated the MXene nanosheets as the PIB anode through the first-principles simulations.19 The bare MXene and O-terminated MXene were proved to be ideal anodes with excellent performances. To further enhance the performances of MXenes, Lian's group synthesized alkalized Ti3C2Tx (a-Ti3C2Tx) MXene nanoribbons through the treatment of bare Ti3C2Tx in a KOH solution.25 The synthesized a-Ti3C2Tx possessed an expanded interlayer spacing of 12.5 Å, an O-terminated surface, 3D porous interconnected framework, and a nanoribbon structure. The expanded interlayer could accelerate the K+ diffusion along the inter-lamination channels, while the 3D MXene networks could enhance the electronic conductivity.
Combining MXenes with TMC materials can efficiently improve the overall electrochemical performances of MXenes. Among various TMCs, MoS2 with 2D lamellar structure can provide abundant K+ intercalation sites and open 2D diffusion pathways and large interlayer spacing, making it a suitable electrode for K+ storage.209 For instance, Li et al. fabricated a hierarchical nanosheet-assembled Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure through a hydrothermal process and evaluated its K+ storage performance.144 In the Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure, the MoS2 nanosheets were anchored on the Ti3C2Tx sheets. The heterostructure could hinder the restacking of MoS2 and Ti3C2Tx sheets, improve the conductivity, facilitate the K+ intercalation/extraction kinetics, and relieve volume expansion upon cycling. Therefore, the Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure demonstrated a high capacity of 206 mA h g−1.
MoSe2 has been utilized as PIB anodes, owing to its large interlayer spacing for the convenient diffusion and intercalation/extraction of K+.210 However, the MoSe2 nanosheets suffer from poor electronic conductivity, aggregation tendency, and rapid capacity fading. Coupling MoSe2 with conductive MXenes can efficiently solve these problems. Recently, Huang et al. constructed MoSe2 on MXene (Ti3C2Tx) sheets through a hydrothermal reaction, followed by coating with a carbon layer (MoSe2/MXene@C) via subsequent carbonization of the surface coated polydopamine (Fig. 9a).67 In the MoSe2/MXene@C heterostructure (Fig. 9b and c), the MoSe2/MXene hybrid structure could prevent the restacking of MXene and MoSe2 sheets and enhance the electronic conductivity, while the outside carbon layer (Fig. 9d) could ensure the structural stability and further improve the conductivity. Furthermore, the strong chemical interactions at the MoSe2/MXene interface could facilitate the charge transfer and improve the cycling stability. Therefore, this MoSe2/MXene@C hybrid structure delivered high capacity and excellent rate capability. This strategy of combining MoSe2 and MXene could be extended to other TMC/MXene anodes for various metal-ion batteries.

Titanium disulfide (TiS2) is a layered structure formed by sulfur–metal–sulfur lamellae, in which metal-ions can be inserted into the 2D channels between the layers.211 The TiS2 material can be used as MIB anode, due to the reversible intercalation/extraction of Mg2+ ions into TiS2 structure.212 Nevertheless, the TiS2 anode suffers from the electronic conductivity and rapid capacity fading. Hybridizing TiS2 with a conductive material like MXenes can improve the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance. Xie et al. predicted that the stable adsorption of Mg2+ on multi-layered MXenes could significantly increase the capacity of the MXene electrode for MIBs.19 Therefore, MXenes with good conductivity and hydrophilia could be considered as an ideal substrate material for supporting TiS2 materials. Li et al. prepared TiS2/Ti3C2Tx composite via a hydrothermal method.145 The obtained TiS2/Ti3C2Tx composite demonstrated high capacity as the MIB electrode.
ZIBs attract increasing interest because of the low potential (−0.76 V), smaller ionic radius, high capacity, low-cost, and nontoxicity.213 Particularly, MXenes can be utilized as ZIB anodes because of high electronic conductivity and abundant termination groups. For example, Li et al. constructed an aqueous ZIB based on a 2D V2CTx electrode.204 The delaminated V2CTx could provide abundant active sites. Therefore, the V2CTx-based ZIB possessed a capacity of 508 mA h g−1 and an ultralong cycling life up to 18000 cycles. Recently, a heterostructure of vanadium oxide on 2D V2CTx (V2Ox@V2CTx) was fabricated through a high-temperature etching method and electrochemical activation process and then utilized as a cathode for aqueous ZIBs.214 Inspired by the 2D layered structure and large interlayer spacing of V2CTx, V2Ox@V2CTx could promote the Zn2+-cation intercalation/extraction.

4.2 Hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures for capacitors
Supercapacitors, also called electrochemical capacitors, are an important type of energy storage devices with low costs, high power density, excellent rate capability, and ultralong cycling lives.215,216 Generally, the electrochemical capacitors can be classified into two categories: (1) electrical double-layered capacitors (EDLCs), which are dominated by the reversible ions adsorption/desorption at the electrode/electrolyte interface;215 (2) pseudocapacitors, which are developed from the quick and reversible surface redox. The most commonly employed supercapacitor electrodes are carbon materials, TMOs, conductive polymers, and TMCs.217–220 Accordingly, the electrochemical reactions of rechargeable batteries including LIBs and SIBs are based on the redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, rechargeable batteries show a relatively higher energy density than the supercapacitors, while the supercapacitors possess higher power-density and better cycling stability. It is a promising strategy to construct a hybrid metal-ion capacitor by combining the advantages of capacitor-type and battery-type electrodes.

4.2.1 Supercapacitors. 
2D layered materials with fast ion diffusion channels and high surface areas can afford more charge storage sites for supercapacitors.227 The MXenes have been extensively used in supercapacitors because of their high conductivity, hydrophilic surfaces, and pseudocapacitance mechanism.57,228,229 For instance, Guan et al. fabricated a 2D V2CTx MXene under the etching in HCl acid-containing LiF.230 The prepared V2CTx delivered a capacitance of 164 F g−1 and a good cycling performance. Gogotsi and co-workers investigated the capacitance mechanism of Ti3C2 and found that the pseudocapacitance of Ti3C2Tx was originated from the redox reactions of the Ti atoms.231 Moreover, increasing the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2Tx can enhance the charge transport in the electrodes. Li and co-workers increased the interlayer distance of the Ti3C2Tx MXenes by K+ intercalation and surface medication by the KOH treatment.232 After the KOH treatment, the intensity of the Ti–F peak was reduced, while the intensity of the –OH group on the Ti3C2Tx surface was increased, indicating the removal of –F termination groups on the surface. Meanwhile, the c lattice parameter increased from 1.92 to 2.5 nm. The lower intensity ratio of –F/–OH and increased interlayer distance could provide more Ti atoms participating in the redox reactions and thus significantly improved the specific capacitance of the Ti3C2Tx MXene.
Nevertheless, the energy density of MXene electrodes is still unsatisfactory for practical applications, owing to small amounts of active sites in MXenes. Hybridizing with other active materials, e.g., graphene and TMCs can effectively enhance the superior capacitance performance of MXenes.233–235 Particularly, TMCs have been extensively applied as supercapacitor electrodes, owing to their good conductivity, high theoretical capacitance, and excellent flexibility.236 MoS2, one of the most attractive TMCs, is widely used as supercapacitor electrodes, due to its high capacitance.237 In particular, 1T-MoS2 is more conductive than 2H-MoS2. Moreover, 1T-MoS2 possesses good hydrophilicity and enlarged interlayer spacing, which are favorable for the ion intercalation. However, 1T-MoS2 is a metastable MoS2 crystal phase. To optimize the performance of MoS2, Wang et al. fabricated 3D interconnected networks of 1T-MoS2/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure via magneto-hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 10a).52 The 3D conductive MXene networks could facilitate the charge transfer. Beneficial from the electrochemical active 1T-MoS2 and 3D conductive MXene matrix (Fig. 10b and c), the 1T-MoS2/Ti3C2 heterostructure delivered a capacitance of 386 F g−1, an excellent rate capability, and a superior cycling performance.
 Fig. 10  (a) Schematic illustration of synthesizing the 2D/2D 1T-MoS2/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure; (b) TEM image and (c) HRTEM image of the 2D/2D 1T-MoS2/Ti3C2 MXene. Reproduced with permission.52 Copyright 2020, Wiley-VCH. 
Copper sulfide (CuS), a typical TMC material, has been regarded as a promising supercapacitor electrode because of its metallic electronic conductivity, high capacity, chemical stability, and low cost.238 To enhance the conductivity of CuS, Pan et al. synthesized 2D Ti3C2Tx decorated with CuS nanoparticles (Ti3C2Tx/CuS) through chemical exfoliation and a subsequent hydrothermal process.221 The CuS nanoparticles could increase the interlayer spacing of the Ti3C2Tx sheets and promote the infiltration of electrolyte into the electrode, while the Ti3C2Tx sheets could enhance the electronic conductivity. Therefore, this Ti3C2Tx/CuS composite demonstrated a high capacity of 169.5 C g−1.
Nickel sulfide (NiS) is regarded as a potential supercapacitor electrode owing to its high theoretical capacitance and low cost.239 But the limited electronic conductivity and structural instability of NiS hinder its practical application. To solve these problems, Liu et al. reported 3D flower-like NiS nanoparticles anchored on Ti3C2Txvia a hydrothermal method.35 The interconnected structure in NiS/Ti3C2Tx could facilitate the ion/electron transfer. The NiS/Ti3C2Tx electrode delivered a superior capacitance of 857 F g−1 and a long cycling life over 3000 cycles. To combine the advantages of the high capacity of nickel sulfides and high electronic conductivity of MXene nanosheets, Luo et al. fabricated Ni–S/delaminated Ti3C2Tx (Ni–S/d-Ti3C2Tx) nanocomposites through a solvothermal process.222 In the Ni–S/d-Ti3C2Tx nanohybrid, the d-Ti3C2Tx sheets could prevent the aggregation of the Ni–S nanostructures, facilitate the charge transfer at the Ni–S/d-Ti3C2Tx interface, and relieve the volume expansion upon cycling, while the Ni–S nanostructures could act as pillars to restrain the restacking of d-Ti3C2Tx sheets. Therefore, the Ni–S/d-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure demonstrated a capacity of 840 C g−1 with good cycling stability.
Furthermore, Ni3S2 with superior capacitance and abundant sources has also been investigated as electrodes for supercapacitors.240 Coupling Ni3S2 with active materials, e.g., graphene and MXene, can efficiently improve the conductivity and performance. For example, Zhao et al. fabricated 2D Ni3S2/delaminated-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure (Ni3S2/d-Ti3C2Tx) supported on Ni foam through a solvothermal method and an electrostatic self-assembly process.112 The 2D Ni3S2/d-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure could facilitate the charge transfer and improve the capacitance and cycling performance.
2D layered tungsten disulfide (WS2), composed of stacked S–W–S layers interconnected via van der Waals force, is used as an electroactive material for supercapacitors because of the huge charge-stored space and abundant electrochemical active sites.241 But the low electronic conductivity and the restacking tendency of WS2 nanosheets hinder their supercapacitor applications. Combining WS2 with conductive MXene sheets can effectively enhance the performance of WS2 electrodes. For example, Vyskočil and co-workers fabricated a 2D stacked structure of Ti3C2Tx and 1T-phase WS2 (Ti3C2Tx/1T-WS2) through inserting 1T-phase WS2 into Ti3C2Tx sheets via a facile sonication-assisted procedure.242 The Ti3C2Tx MXene could prevent the aggregation of the WS2 nanostructures, while the WS2 nanospacers could avoid the restacking of Ti3C2Tx sheets and increase the active sites, thus facilitating the overall performance of Ti3C2Tx/1T-WS2.
According to previous reports, the binary TMCs show better electrochemical activity and higher capacitance than the mono-metal TMCs owing to their abundant redox sites.243,244 For example, Li et al. fabricated NiCo2S4 nanoflakes anchored on the Ti3C2Tx surface (NiCoS4/Ti3C2Tx) on the conductive Ni foam via a cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition process and a subsequent hydrothermal method.223 The conductive Ti3C2Tx could improve the conductivity and release the stress upon cycling, while the bimetallic NiCo2S4 could provide more redox reaction sites. Therefore, this NiCoS4/Ti3C2 composite showed a high capacity of 596 C g−1. Recently, Li et al. constructed chrysanthemum-like NiCo2S4 on MXene sheets, forming an 3D NiCo2S4/MXene hybrid with 3D sandwich architecture.245 The NiCo2S4 nanoparticles encapsulated in MXene sheets could increase the interlayer spacing of MXene sheets and provide more redox reaction sites. The optimized NiCo2S4/MXene electrode delivered a capacitance of 1266 F g−1 and good capacitance retention. Furthermore, constructing 1D hollow NiCo2S4 nanotubes can provide more reactive sites and porous charge transport channels. For instance, Wu et al. synthesized nanohybrids of 2D Ti3C2Tx sheets and 1D NiCo2S4 hollow nanotubes (Ti3C2Tx/NiCo2S4) through a hydrothermal method and subsequent electrostatic adsorption.246 The obtained Ti3C2Tx/NiCo2S4 delivered superior capacitance and a long cycling life, owing to the close interaction of conductive Ti3C2Tx and NiCo2S4 nanotubes. The Ni/Co ratio of the Ni–Co–S can influence the performance of Ni–Co–S/MXene composites. Recently, plenty of Ni1.5Co1.5S4 nanoparticles were grown on few-layer Ti3C2Tx nanoflakes (Ni1.5Co1.5S4@Ti3C2Tx) through a one-step hydrothermal route, forming a Ni1.5Co1.5S4@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure.224 This Ni1.5Co1.5S4@Ti3C2Tx electrode demonstrated an energy-density of 49.8 W h kg−1 and good cycling stability over 8000 cycles.
Polymer materials can act as a protective layer to enhance the structural completeness and stabilize the TMCs nanostructures on MXene sheets. For instance, Wu et al. fabricated Ti3C2@polydopamine/NiCo2S4 (Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4) heterostructure through a hydrothermal route (Fig. 11a) and used it as a supercapacitor electrode.225 The surface modification of PDA on the Ti3C2 sheets (Fig. 11b) could prevent the structure collapse of Ti3C2 during the hydrothermal reaction. Then the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles distributed on the Ti3C2 layers could prevent the restacking of Ti3C2 sheets, while Ti3C2 could facilitate charge transfer. Therefore, this Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 heterostructure demonstrated excellent capacitance (Fig. 11c).
 Fig. 11  (a) Schematic illustration of synthesizing the Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 heterostructure, (b) HRTEM image of the Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 heterostructure, and (c) gravimetric capacitance of the Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 heterostructure. Reproduced with permission.225 Copyright 2019, Elsevier. 
Transition metal selenides also show outstanding electrochemical performance because of their high surface area, excellent electronic conductivity, and porous networks.247,248 For instance, nickel diselenide (NiSe2) possesses good electrochemical performances as a supercapacitor electrode because of its unique structure, various oxidation states, and abundant active sites. But the NiSe2 electrode suffers from low electronic conductivity and unsatisfying cycling stability. Therefore, combining transition metal selenides with conductive and active materials can effectively overcome the drawbacks. Jiang et al. synthesized NiSe2 octahedral crystals coated by few-layer Ti3C2Tx (NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx) through a facile hydrothermal reaction.226 This NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx could provide abundant redox reaction sites, while the strong interaction at the NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx interface could enhance the conductivity and charge transfer, thus facilitating the electrochemical performances.
According to previous reports, the bimetallic transition metal selenides exhibit better electrochemical performances than mono-metal selenides.249 Dakka et al. fabricated bimetallic CuxCo1−xSe2 nanostructures on the Ti3C2Tx substrate via a hydrothermal method and a subsequent selenization process.109 The Cu2+ and Cu/Co ratio played a role in adjusting the energy storage properties of the CuxCo1−xSe2 electrodes for supercapacitors. The optimized Cu0.5Co0.5Se2 electrode exhibited the best performance with a capacitance of 1695 F g−1 and superior cycling performance, owing to the conductive MXene sheets and electroactive bimetallic CuxCo1−xSe2.
For the supercapacitor application, the 2D nanostructure and abundant surface functional groups of MXenes can ensure good performance of MXenes and MXene/TMC heterostructures in capacitors. Enlarging the interlayer distance of MXenes, improving the electronic/ionic conductivity, and hybridizing with binary TMCs can further enhance the capacitor performance of MXenes and MXene/TMC composites. Additionally, understanding the energy-storage mechanisms and ion dynamics between MXene sheets and TMC materials can enable the future development of high-power MXene/TMCs-based capacitors.


4.2.2 Metal-ion capacitors. 
Restricted by energy-storage mechanisms, many supercapacitors show limited energy density. To improve the energy density and power density of supercapacitors, an effective strategy is to construct ion capacitors, e.g., Li-ion, Na-ion, and Zn-ion capacitors.250,251 Generally, the metal-ion capacitors based on battery-type and capacitor-type electrodes can overall combine the advantages of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, generating high energy and power density.252 For instance, in a Li-ion capacitor (LICs), the Li+-type anode possesses high capacity driving from the Li+ insertion/extraction reaction, when the capacitor-type cathode shows high power density by the fast ion adsorption/desorption. Thus, the LICs demonstrate better energy-density and power-density than pure capacitors and batteries.
2D MXenes are widely investigated as pseudocapacitive anodes in nonaqueous half-cell and supercapacitors, because of their good electrochemical performance.113,234 Therefore, MXene-based anodes assembled with active carbon cathodes could further enhance the energy storage properties of LICs. For instance, Li et al. fabricated accordion-like Ti3C2Tx with open channels and high crystallinity via the combustion process and acid treatment.253 The obtained accordion-like Ti3C2Tx was utilized as the anode, and the active carbon was used as the cathode with a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte to assemble LICs. The Ti3C2Tx could facilitate charge transfer, thus improving the overall performance of Ti3C2Tx-based LICs. Furthermore, enlarging the interlayer distance of MXenes can further improve the overall performance of LICs. Tao et al. synthesized pillared Ti3C2 through CTAB and Sn4+ pillaring processes.254 The Ti3C2 interlayer distance could be enlarged because of the prepillaring Sn complex agent. Then the Sn4+/Ti3C2 LIC showed a high capacity of 765 mA h g−1 and a superior energy density of 239.5 W h kg−1. Furthermore, combining MXenes with conductive CNTs can efficiently enhance the conductivity and overall performance. For instance, Yu and co-workers synthesized a Ti3C2Tx/CNTs film by mixing the delaminated Ti3C2Tx with CNTs and a subsequent vacuum filtration process.255 Owing to the existence of CNTs in the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs heterostructure, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-based LIC demonstrated a superior energy density of 67 W h kg−1 and superior cycling performance.
Compared with LICs, sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) possess the merits of abundant Na resources and low cost.250 The MXenes and MXene-based heterostructures are considered as promising SICs anodes because of their high electronic conductivity and abundant active sites.18 For example, Yamada's group utilized Ti2CTx as an anode and Na2Fe2(SO4)3 as a cathode for SICs.18 The prepared Na2Fe(SO4)3-Ti2CTx prototype cell showed an energy-density of 260 W h kg−1. Although MXenes are used as SIC anode materials, they still suffer from the sluggish sodiation kinetics and lower Na+ storage capacity. Enlarging the interlayer distance of MXenes could effectively increase the Na+ insertion sites and enhance the redox reaction kinetics.106 Luo and co-workers used various alkali metal ions as pillars to widen the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2.106 Interestingly, the Na+ pillaring Ti3C2Tx (Na-Ti3C2Tx) could provide abundant reaction sites and lower the Na+ diffusion barrier when compared with pure Ti3C2Tx, Li-Ti3C2Tx, and K-T3C2Tx. Moreover, the termination groups (i.e., –OH) could offer more active sites. To further improve the utilization of surface functional groups of MXenes, Fan et al. used 3D printing technology to fabricate 3D porous N-doped MXene networks and utilized it as an SIC anode coupled with active carbon cathode.256 The surface F-doping could improve the redox reactivity and electronic conductivity of MXene, while the 3D porous structure could facilitate the charge transport and relieve the volume expansion upon cycling.
Zinc-ion capacitors (ZICs) consist of Zn2+ insertion/extraction electrodes and appropriate capacitor-type electrodes with corresponding electrolytes.257 Zn possesses natural abundance, high capacity, and a low potential (−0.76 V). This potential of Zn matched the electrochemical stable voltage window for water, making Zn metal compatible with an aqueous electrolyte. However, the electrode materials (e.g., MnO2 and V2O5) of ZICs suffer from the poor cycling stability and low voltages.258 MXenes can also be applied as the electrode in ZICs because of their high electronic conductivity, termination groups, and pseudocapacitance type mechanism.259 Wang et al. designed a ZIC by assembling a free-standing MnO2-CNTs cathode and a Ti3C2Tx anode.257 The Ti3C2Tx-based ZIC delivered a capacitance of 115 F g−1 and an energy density of 98.6 W h kg−1, which could be attributed to the fast reaction kinetics and stable electrolyte. To further enhance the performance of MXene-based ZICs, Maughan et al. used CTAB as pillars to be intercalated into MXene layers, resulting in pillared MXene sheets with enlarged interlayer spacing.259 The pillared MXene sheets could provide enlarged channels for the ion diffusion and more redox reaction sites.
So far, the research on hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures as electrodes in the metal-ion capacitors is relatively few. Therefore, there are opportunities in developing MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures applied in hybrid metal-ion capacitors.

4.3 Hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures for catalysis
With the constantly increasing environmental and energy crises, renewable energy conversion technologies including electrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting have attracted much attention.260–262 The high-efficient catalysts are the key factors of these catalysis technologies in practical applications. However, the practical applications of some catalysts (i.e., precious metals) are always hindered by the high cost and scarcity. Therefore, developing novel efficient catalysts with low costs is urgently necessary. 2D MXenes with high conductivity, low costs, rich active sites, and abundant surface termination groups are widely utilized as catalysts and catalyst hosts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.56,263

4.3.1 Electrocatalysis. 
Electrocatalytic energy conversion is extremely important for the next-generation renewable energy conversion.273 To date, various TMCs (e.g., MoS2, Ni3S2, and MoSe2) and their composites have been investigated for electrocatalytic reactions, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), owing to their large abundance, low costs, and good electrocatalytic performances.115,274,275 Nevertheless, the TMC materials suffer from inherent poor conductivity and the tendency of aggregation during the electrocatalysis reaction. Combining TMCs with 2D conductive MXenes can effectively improve the electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic performance.65,264,267
As a typical electrocatalytic reaction, HER is valuable for the electrochemical water splitting in alkaline media.276 Thus, developing advanced HER catalysts in alkaline media is critical to electrochemical water splitting. Although the Pt particles show an excellent HER performance, their scarcity and high cost hinder the practical application. Therefore, developing non-precious and abundant high-performance HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media is urgently important.
MoS2, a famous 2D layered material, attracts much concern as HER electrocatalysts because of its low cost and high electrocatalytic activity.277 However, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 is limited by its poor electronic conductivity and sluggish kinetics of electrochemical reduction of water to H2. Coupling MoS2 with a conductive matrix (e.g., MXenes) can efficiently enhance the electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic performance of MoS2-based catalysts. The MXene sheets possess excellent electronic conductivity, various elemental compositions, surface functional possibilities, and adjustable layer thickness, so that their work functions can vary in a wide range. For instance, You et al. deeply studied the electrocatalytic mechanisms and vanishing Schottky barriers at the interfaces between mono-layer MoS2 and six MXene materials (i.e., V2CO2, V4C3O2, V2NO2, CrCO2, Cr2NO2, and Mo2CO2) by using the first-principles calculations.110 The constructed heterostructures composed of the mono-layer MoS2 and these six MXene materials could form Schottky barrier-free contact with MoS2. The formation of Schottky barrier-free contact could efficiently facilitate the charge injection into MoS2, increase the electronic conductivity of MoS2, facilitate the hydrogen adsorption, and thus improve the HER performance.
Furthermore, to verify the enhancement of the HER performance caused by combining MoS2 with MXenes, Ren et al. fabricated MoS2 nanoflowers on a 2D Mo2CTx matrix (MoS2@Mo2CTx) through an exfoliation process and a subsequent hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 12a).264 In the MoS2@Mo2CTx heterostructure (Fig. 12b and c), the Mo2CTx could act as a conductive matrix and provide more redox reaction sites. The incorporation of MoS2 in Mo2CTx sheets could not only modify the surface adsorption energetics but also increase the reaction active sites and facilitate the kinetics of the HER (Fig. 12d). The DFT calculations further proved that the MoS2 could affect the adsorption energy of H atoms on the terminated O atoms of Mo2CO2 and enhance the HER performance. Recently, to enhance the conductivity and break the pH limitation of electrocatalyst, Hu et al. fabricated a MoS2/Nb2CTx heterostructure through a simple hydrothermal process.265 The Nb2CTx could enhance the electronic conductivity, while the low p-type Schottky barrier at MoS2/Nb2CTx interface could promote the efficient charge transition from Nb2CTx to MoS2 and enhance the hydrogen adsorption ability. Therefore, the obtained MoS2/Nb2CTx heterostructure catalyst demonstrated an overpotential of 138.8 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline condition.

According to previous studies, doping transition metals (e.g., Fe and Ni) into MoS2 can enhance the HER activity of MoS2 catalysts.278,279 For example, Liang et al. constructed Co-doped MoS2/Mo2CTx heterostructure (Co-MoS2/Mo2CTx) to facilitate the HER activity in an alkaline solution.266 This Co-doping could regulate the electronic structure of MoS2 and enhance its HER activity, while Mo2CTx could improve the electronic conductivity and provide more reaction activity sites, leading to the optimized HER activity. Recently, Vinoba et al. fabricated few-layer Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets anchored on Ti3C2Tx sheets (Ni-MoS2/Ti3C2Tx) via a liquid exfoliation process and subsequent hydrodesulfurization.280 In the Ni-MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure, the Ni-doping, MoS2 nanosheets, and conductive MXene matrix could synergistically enhance the electrocatalytic activity on clean fuel production.
Compared with single transition metal sulfide, binary transition metal sulfides can further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.281 For instance, Zou and co-workers fabricated porous Ni–Co–S structure on exfoliated Ti3C2Tx sheets (NiCoS/Ti3C2Tx) by using a self-scarified template method (Fig. 13a).267 ZIF-67 was used as a template to synthesize the binary metal sulfides NiCoS through simultaneous calcination and sulfurization. The conductive MXene and intimate interfacial contact of NiCoS and Ti3C2Tx could enhance the conductivity, provide more efficient redox reaction sites, and facilitate the OER activity (Fig. 13b and c). The NiCoS/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure took place a chemical structure transformation of NiCoS into nickel/cobalt oxyhydroxide-NiCoS assembly on the MXene sheets during the OER process. The obtained NiCoS/Ti3C2Tx hybrid catalyst showed an overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 13d) and a stable cycling performance.

MoSe2 has also been utilized as an electrocatalyst due to its abundant sources, low cost, and high electrocatalytic activity.282 But it still suffers from low electronic conductivity. To improve the electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic performance, Huang et al. fabricated 3D MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx nanoflowers assembled by nano-petals and evaluated the electrocatalytic activity toward HER.65 The 3D conductive framework could provide short charge transport pathways and more exposed active sites, while the MoSe2 layer could effectively prevent the ultrathin Ti3C2Tx sheets from oxygen corrosion, leading to high conductivity, good structural stability, and superior HER electrocatalytic activity.
For the electrocatalysis application, the electrocatalytic performance of MXenes and MXene/TMC heterostructures are determined by the aspects such as material composition, surface terminations, interfacial and geometry designs. It is valuable to develop more MXenes and MXene/TMC electrocatalysis with high activity, selectivity, and stability for the future application in the long term. Moreover, it is urgently important to investigate the reaction mechanisms and true catalytic pathways of the MXenes and MXene/TMC heterostructures.


4.3.2 Photocatalysis. 
With the increasing awareness about the energy and environmental crisis, photocatalysis that can convert light energy into fuel has been regarded as a promising strategy.261,283 The efficient photocatalyst is the key factor for photocatalytic reactions including photodegradation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction. Developing high-performance photocatalysts is crucial for the future applications of photocatalysis. To date, various efficient photocatalysts including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, TMOs, and TMCs have been developed.284–286 Among these catalysts, TMCs have been widely regarded as promising photocatalysts owing to their abundance, low toxicity, narrow bandgaps, and superior photocatalytic activity.286 For instance, MoS2 with a relatively narrow bandgap (Eg = 1.8 eV), 2D layered structure, and unique optical properties have attracted much attention in H2 production. Although bulk MoS2 shows poor photocatalytic activity, the MoS2 in nanoscale can shift the valence band (VB) enough to generate better photocatalytic activity owing to the quantum confinement of nanomaterials. The edges of MoS2 layers consist of abundant active sites for photocatalysis.287
The Ti3C2Tx MXene can act as a co-catalyst to regulate the transfer of the photogenerated e− because of its high conductivity, thus enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated e−/holes.268,288,289 For example, Zhang et al. fabricated an MoS2/Ti3C2Tx catalyst with a unique sphere/sheet structure by using a hydrothermal method.268 The prepared MoS2/Ti3C2Tx with a Ti3C2Tx loading content of 30% could effectively hinder the recombination of photogenerated e−/holes and provide more reaction sites, resulting in a high H2 evolution rate of 6.144 mmol g−1 h−1. Subsequently, Yao et al. constructed an R-scheme Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterojunction through a hydrothermal reaction.121 The Ti3C2Tx MXene/MoS2 composite with a low content of Ti3C2Tx (0.5 wt%) could improve the light absorption ability and increase the specific surface area, while the Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure could reduce the electrochemical impedance, facilitate the photocurrent response and electron transfer, and inhibit the charge recombination.
Recently, Jiao et al. fabricated vertically aligned MoS2 layers on Ti3C2Tx (MoS2@Ti3C2Tx) and studied the photocatalytic reaction mechanism.111 Since the MoS2 possesses more negative Fermi levels (EF) than Ti3C2Tx, the photogenerated electron transfers from MoS2 to Ti3C2Tx at the MoS2/Ti3C2Tx interface, yielding a Schottky junction between MoS2 and Ti3C2Tx. Under the visible-light irradiation, electrons excited from the VB of the MoS2 phase could further migrate to the Fermi level of Ti3C2Tx, while the photogenerated holes were left in the VB of MoS2. Then the Schottky junction could trap the photogenerated electrons, which could further transfer to the Ti3C2Tx surface. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes were prolonged from recombination, which could facilitate the oxidation of the liquid paraffin and methyl orange.
As mentioned above, employing MXenes as a medium to transfer photo-induced electrons of TMCs can effectively enhance the photocatalytic performance of the composite photocatalysts. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), a typical TMC photocatalyst, has been extensively investigated owing to its narrow bandgap (2.4 eV) for high-efficiency absorption of visible light.290,291 However, CdS catalysts suffer from the photo-corrosion and fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.292 Fortunately, 2D MXenes with high electronic conductivity can be utilized as a co-catalyst to facilitate the light absorption and accelerate the transfer of photogenerated e−, thus enhancing the photocatalytic properties.293 Li et al. fabricated CdS nanoparticles on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (CdS/Ti3C2Tx) through a low-temperature solution reaction.294 The Ti3C2Tx could extract a photogenerated electron from the CdS phase because of the high Fermi level position of Ti3C2Tx and close contact at the CdS/Ti3C2Tx interface, thus hindering the recombination of photogenerated e−/holes. Therefore, this CdS/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure catalyst demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity.
One-dimensional (1D) CdS with high length-to-diameter ratios can further enhance the photocatalytic properties.295 Recently, a hierarchical CdS nanorod/MXene nanosheet (CdS/MXene) heterostructure was fabricated through a combined electrostatic assembly and solvothermal process.296 Owing to the strong interfacial coupling of the 1D CdS and 2D MXene, the 1D/2D heterostructure could accelerate the photogenerated e−/hole separation and lower the Schottky barrier for the photocatalytic water splitting. The prepared 1D/2D CdS/MXene demonstrated an electrocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2.407 mmol g−1 h−1. Recently, Li and co-workers constructed a CdS-Ti3C2Tx heterostructure composed of 1D CdS nanowires and 2D Ti3C2Txvia an electrostatic self-assembly method (Fig. 14a–c) and evaluated their photocatalytic activity of bioethanol into 1,1-diethoxyethane and H2 evolution.269 The close interfacial contact and matched energy level alignment between CdS and Ti3C2Tx could facilitate the separation of photogenerated e−/holes and migration of charge carriers (Fig. 14d and e). The CdS/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure possessed a porous structure and could facilitate the catalyst/reactant contact. The CH(OH)CH3 acted as the pivotal radical intermediate in the photo-redox reaction.

Ternary composites containing TMCs and MXenes have been used as photocatalysts owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity and wide spectral response range.270,294 For example, Chen et al. fabricated a CdS/MoS2/MXene heterostructure through a facile hydrothermal method and evaluated its photocatalytic H2 production performance.297 In the CdS/MoS2/MXene heterostructure, the MXene could enhance the conductivity, promote the electron transport, and prolong the recombination of photogenerated e−/holes. Therefore, the ternary CdS/MoS2/MXene heterostructure demonstrated an H2 evolution rate of 9.679 mmol g−1 h−1. Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx MXene could be used as a co-catalyst to enhance the quantum efficiency and visible-light photocatalytic H2 production of the binary Zn0.8Cd0.2S, because of the fast e−/hole separation and transfer from Zn0.8Cd0.2S to Ti3C2Tx.298
According to previous reports, constructing cascading junction (Z-scheme) structured catalysts can effectively promote the photogenerated e−/hole separation, increase the light absorption and enhance the photocatalytic activity.299,300 Liu et al. fabricated 2D CdS@Ti3C2@TiO2 nanohybrids through calcination and a subsequent hydrothermal process and used it as photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation.301 The Ti3C2 was calcinated at 500 °C to in situ synthesize Ti3C2@TiO2 with appropriate band edge alignments for the photo-induced electrons migrating from TiO2 to Ti3C2. The CdS could act as the third phase of the Z-scheme CdS@Ti3C2@TiO2 catalyst. In the ternary CdS@Ti3C2@TiO2 heterostructure, the excited e− on the CB of TiO2 could combine with light-induced holes on the VB of CdS through Ti3C2 as a mediator and electron trap, and then the free radical ˙O2− and ˙OH were produced. These free radicals played important roles in oxidizing the pollutant solution. Therefore, the CdS@Ti3C2@TiO2 heterostructure demonstrated superior performance in the visible-light-driven degradation of sulfachloropyridazine and phenol.
In2S3 can be used as a sensitizer to efficiently capture solar light. The In2S3-based heterostructure photocatalysts have gained increasing attention for efficient photocatalysis owing to their suitable alteration in the energy band.302 To improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2/Ti3C2Tx, Wang and co-workers fabricated an In2S3/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure by using a facile hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 15a and b).270 This In2S3/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure with type-II heterojunction and Schottky junction was able to prolong the recombination of photogenerated e−/holes (Fig. 15c). Furthermore, the In2S3 component could facilitate light absorption and alter the bandgap of the composite photocatalyst, while the Ti3C2Tx sheets could ensure the electronic conductivity (Fig. 15d). Therefore, the In2S3/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure demonstrated superior visible-light photocatalytic degradation performance with a degradation rate of 0.049 min−1, much higher than those of In2S3, Ti3C2Tx, and In2S3/TiO2 catalysts.

CdLa2S2, a ternary metal sulfide, have been utilized as photocatalysts because of high chemical stability, suitable bandgap, and strong visible-light absorption.303 Nevertheless, the fast recombination of photogenerated e−/holes hinders the applications of CdLa2S2. To prolong the recombination of photogenerated e−/holes, Cheng et al. prepared a CdLa2S2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure via a simple hydrothermal method and utilized 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets as a co-catalyst to optimize the photocatalytic activity of CdLa2S4.271
Copper selenide (CuSe) has been used in photocatalysis, owing to its high photocatalytic activity. To improve the quantum efficiency of CuSe, Chen and co-workers fabricated a 3D structured CuSe/Ti3C2Tx composite through growing CuSe nanoparticles on the 2D Ti3C2Tx sheets.272 The prepared CuSe/Ti3C2Tx composite with high surface area could provide more electrocatalytic reaction sites, while Ti3C2Tx sheets could improve the conductivity and decrease the impedance of the composite. Therefore, this CuSe/Ti3C2Tx composite showed a high photoelectronic conversion efficiency of 5.12% and good stability.
Generally, MXenes have hydrophilic functional groups (–OH and –O) on their surfaces, which enable them to easily form strong interactions with various TMCs photocatalysts and water molecules. The excellent electronic conductivity of MXenes can guarantee efficient electron shutting. The tunable band gap, hydrophilic nature, and large surface area of MXene/TMC heterostructures can benefit the photocatalytic reactions including photodegradation and photocatalytic water splitting.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, this review highlighted the basics of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures applied in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Particularly, the structures, synthesis strategy, surface/heterointerface engineering, and properties of MXene/TMC heterostructures were presented. The recent advances of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructure and progress of their applications in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis have been presented.
To date, various MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures have been synthesized through selectively etching and exfoliation of layered MAX phases. In general, F-containing compounds are also utilized as etchants to synthesize MXenes from the MAX phases, resulting in the surface modification of MXenes with abundant termination groups (–O, –F, and –OH). On one hand, these surface termination groups can reduce the conductivity of MXenes and lower their electrochemical performance. On the other hand, MXenes could hybrid with other active materials like TMCs (e.g., MoS2, CoS, and MoSe2), which offers an effective way to adjust the electronic structures and properties of MXenes, owing to the termination functional groups and versatile surface chemistry. TMCs can be intercalated into MXene interlayers and effectively inhibit the restacking of MXene sheets as an interlayer spacer. The metallic electronic conductivity, abundant termination functional groups, lamellar structures, and other excellent properties of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures can ensure excellent performances as anodes in LIBs and SIBs, and S host materials in Li–S batteries. Furthermore, when MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures are used as electrodes for supercapacitors, their lamellar structure, abundant active sites, and polar active materials could enhance their electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The unique 2D structure and superior conductivity make MXenes promising flexible electrodes for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. Moreover, hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures show excellent electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties, owing to the metallic conductivity, adjustable electronic structures, abundant termination groups, and exposed metal sites.
Although MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures have demonstrated obvious potential in energy storage and conversion, there are still some challenges for practical applications. First, it is highly desirable to develop safe routes to synthesize high-quality MXenes with a high yield rate, low costs, and controllable surface terminations. Especially, fabricating MXenes with a certain termination group is urgently necessary to understand the interrelation between termination groups and MXene properties. Second, pure single-layer MXenes without surface terminations can be fabricated through CVD or other physical methods to further investigate their electronic, mechanical, and photonic properties. Third, it is urgent to study the intercalation mechanisms, charge storage mechanisms, electronic structures, and other physicochemical properties of MXenes hybridized with TMCs. Various in situ characterization techniques (e.g., in situ XRD, TEM, and Raman) can be utilized to investigate the reaction mechanisms of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures during the electrochemical reactions. Fourth, it is urgently necessary to further understand the heterointerface of hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures, since the heterostructures can effectively enhance the electrochemical performance especially the cycling performance for recharge batteries and supercapacitors, and tailor the catalytic reactions when being composited with high-performance electrocatalysts or adjustable bandgap semiconductors. Finally, heteroatom doping can effectively enhance the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performances of MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures. Nevertheless, heteroatom doping in MXenes was rarely reported, except for a few reports about N- and S-doping of MXenes. Therefore, there are opportunities in developing heteroatom-doped MXenes and MXene/TMC heterostructures for practical applications. Generally, MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures have great potential in energy storage and conversion. It is worth noting that beyond the application fields mentioned here, MXenes and hierarchical MXene/TMC heterostructures are expected to be valuable for other critical fields, such as gas separation, water purification, and sensors.
