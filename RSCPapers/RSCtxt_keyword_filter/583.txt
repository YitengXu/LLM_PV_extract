    , Accepted 8th December 2015First published on 10th December 2015AbstractNanophotonic perovskite solar cells have been fabricated by infiltrating methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) into the interstices of the quasi-single-crystalline TiO2 nanodendrite (ND) array. The TiO2 ND array in the active layer serves as not only the nanophotonic light trapping structure but also the electron transport medium for enhancing both light harvesting and electron collection to challenge the issue of short electron diffusion length in MAPbI3-based solar cells. Finite difference time domain simulation results indicate that the ND in the MAPbI3 matrix exhibits superior light trapping performance compared to the nanorod (NR), which can well explain the comparable light harvesting in the MAPbI3–TiO2 ND and the MAPbI3–TiO2 NR solar cells although the MAPbI3 amount in the former is ∼10% less. Moreover, the branches developed from the trunks of the NDs will extract the photoelectrons from MAPbI3 to reduce the electron transport length in the MAPbI3 matrix. The higher internal quantum efficiencies, especially at longer wavelengths, confirm the enhanced electron collection in the MAPbI3–TiO2 ND solar cell. Compared to the MAPbI3–TiO2 NR solar cell, the 22% and 25% enhancements in the average Jsc and PCE are respectively attained in the MAPbI3–TiO2 ND solar cells.
Introduction
Thanks to their excellent optoelectronic properties and easy fabrication by solution processes, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have emerged as a new generation of promising materials for photovoltaic applications.1–5 In 2009, the pioneering work of Kojima et al.6 concerning the perovskite-sensitized solar cell with liquid electrolytes attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%. Solid-state perovskite solar cells with PCEs ∼10% were demonstrated in 2012 by Grätzel et al.7 and Snaith et al.8 using methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and mixed halide MAPbI3−xClx, respectively. Rapid improvements in the PCE of the solution-processed perovskite solar cells have been achieved in the past 3 years (ref. 1–5) through the advances in device configuration,9 film fabrication methodology,10,11 and the composition of organic–inorganic halide perovskites.12 A certified PCE of 20.1% has been reported in the mesoscopic formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar cell.12
Carrier diffusion lengths in the two most common perovskite solar cells, i.e., MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3 solar cells, have been characterized by the direct measurement of electron beam-induced current (EBIC) profiles of the cross-sections of the solar cells.13,14 Electron and hole diffusion lengths in the MAPbI3−xClx are comparable, which are in the range of 2 μm.13 In the MAPbI3-based cells, the hole diffusion length is ∼1 μm. However, the effective diffusion length of electrons is shorter than that of holes.14 It well explains that a mesoscopic device configuration with the mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transporter is required to overcome the impediment to efficient pure iodide-based perovskite solar cells.14
As a result of the short electron diffusion length, the thickness of the MAPbI3 active layer in the perovskite solar cells should be limited for efficient collection of photogenerated carriers. However, it has been reported that the optical field distribution in the planar MAPbI3 solar cell is dependent on the incident light due to the difference of the absorption coefficients of MAPbI3 as a function of wavelength (λ).15 For λ > 500 nm the optical field in the active layer is governed by low-finesse thin-film interference whereas the absorption is saturated within a thickness less than ∼200 nm as λ < 500 nm. The performance of the MAPbI3 solar cell should be improved by maximizing the light harvesting for λ > 500 nm. Therefore, it confronts a trade-off between light absorption and charge transport for the optimization of the active layer thickness of the perovskite solar cell. Nanophotonic light trapping has been recognized to be a promising strategy for enhancing the absorption and therefore the power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells based on thin active layers.16,17 Periodic dielectric gratings, plasmonic structures and random scattering surfaces have been constructed for nanophotonic light trapping in solar cells.17 Strong light trapping in nanowire solar cells has been demonstrated as well.18,19
A device configuration for perovskite solar cells providing a direct electron transport pathway has been investigated by using one-dimensional (1D) and single-crystalline TiO2 or ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays, instead of the mesoporous layer, as the electron transport medium.20–24 Compared to the mesoporous structure, the vertical 1D NR array also benefits the infiltration of perovskites into the electron transport medium.20 Moreover, high-efficiency and stable perovskite MAPbI3−xClx solar cells and modules have been demonstrated recently by employing the vertical TiO2 nanorod array as the electron transport medium.25,26 However, in the MAPbI3-NR array solar cell, the photoelectrons which are generated in the region near the hole transport layer may not be efficiently collected due to the long transport path to the transparent conducting electrode through the MAPbI3 channels among the NR arrays.
To compromise the issues of charge transport and light absorption, in addition to the construction of the thin solar cell with a nanophotonic light trapping structure, the carrier collection length can also be reduced by the construction of a three-dimensional carrier transport medium into the active layer of the solar cell for developing efficient carrier transport pathways.27–29 In this work, a quasi-single-crystalline TiO2 nanodendrite (ND) array30–32 has been integrated into the MAPbI3 active layer on the basis of the considerations of both electron collection and light propagation to challenge the issue of short electron diffusion length in the MAPbI3-based cells. By using the three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 ND array, the branches developed from the NRs which occupy the space between NRs will extract the photoelectrons from MAPbI3 to surmount the obstacle of short electron diffusion length through reducing the electron transport length in the MAPbI3 matrix. Moreover, the light harvesting efficiency of MAPbI3 in the MAPbI3–TiO2 ND array solar cell can be enhanced due to the nanophotonic light trapping effect induced by the 3D configuration of the TiO2 ND array in the active layer.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b respectively show the cross-sectional SEM images of the TiO2 NR and ND arrays grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The thickness of both TiO2 NR and ND arrays is 400 nm, which is comparable to the active layer thickness of the optimal planar MAPbI3 solar cell.15 The average diameters of the NRs and the trunks of NDs are ∼50 nm. Moreover, the diameters and lengths of the branches of TiO2 NDs are 20 nm and 65 nm, respectively. Raman and XRD characterization revealed the rutile phase of the TiO2 nanostructured arrays grown on FTO electrodes (Fig. S1, ESI†). Single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NR and quasi-single-crystalline rutile TiO2 ND arrays have been examined by high-resolution TEM in the previous work.30

MAPbI3 was prepared in the interstices of the NR and ND arrays using the sequential deposition method.10 Structural characterization of the MAPbI3–TiO2 nanostructured arrays was conducted using XRD (Fig. S2, ESI†). Apart from the diffraction peaks pertaining to the FTO substrate and rutile TiO2, other peaks in the XRD patterns are indexed to those of MAPbI3. There is no PbI2 and CH3NH3I diffraction peak appearing in the XRD patterns, showing nearly complete conversion of PbI2 and CH3NH3I to MAPbI3 within the interstices of TiO2 nanostructured arrays using the sequential deposition method. The cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite–TiO2 NR and perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. They reveal that the interstices of the TiO2 nanostructured arrays are well-filled by MAPbI3. The thickness of the active layers in the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells is ∼460 nm, which is composed of a 400 nm-thick MAPbI3 infiltrated TiO2 nanostructured array and a 60 nm-thick MAPbI3 overlayer.
The nanophotonic light trapping performances of the TiO2 nanostructured arrays in the MAPbI3 solar cells were first examined by optical simulation. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were conducted for the electromagnetic (EM) energy density distributions in the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells. Fig. 2a and b respectively show the schematics of the perovskite–TiO2 ND and perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cells for the FDTD simulations with a pulse EM wave entering from the FTO side. Because the TiO2 nanostructures are not well-ordered arrays on the FTO substrates, simulations were on the basis of the individual vertical nanostructure in the MAPbI3 matrix instead of the consideration of a collective grating like effect.17 For comparison, EM energy density distributions in the two cells were simulated with both 450 nm and 650 nm pulse EM waves. As shown in Fig. 2c, the well-defined standing waves in the trunk of the TiO2 ND, accompanying with the EM energy density distributions in the adjacent MAPbI3 by the coupling effect, can be seen in the FDTD simulation for the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell after a 450 nm pulse EM wave propagates through. However, Fig. 2d reveals a very weak standing wave and a negligible coupling effect appearing in the simulation result of the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell. Obviously, the light trapping ability of the TiO2 ND for a 450 nm pulse EM wave is superior to that of the TiO2 NR in perovskite solar cells.

Simulated EM energy density distribution in solar cells after pulse EM waves passing through: (c) perovskite–TiO2 ND with 450 nm, (d) perovskite–TiO2 NR with 450 nm, (e) perovskite–TiO2 ND with 650 nm, and (f) perovskite–TiO2 NR with 650 nm. 
After a 650 nm pulse EM wave passes through the nanophotonic perovskite solar cell with the 3D ND structure in the active layer, Fig. 2e indicates that not only much stronger standing waves exist in the TiO2 ND but also significant coupling EM energy density is distributed in the adjacent MAPbI3. In the case of the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell, as shown in Fig. 2f, slightly coupling EM energy density is present in the perovskite region whereas well-defined standing waves are confined in the TiO2 NR. FDTD simulation reveals that the 3D TiO2 ND array is a superior nanophotonic light trapping structure in the active layer of the perovskite solar cell. Both 450 nm and 650 nm EM waves can be considerably trapped in the TiO2 ND, which brings about the strong coupling effect with the perovskite region. Additionally, the trapping effect is more significant as the EM wave with longer wavelength enters the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell.
Statistical photovoltaic parameters of the perovskite–TiO2 NR and perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells are shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic parameters of the two cells are listed in Table 1. The average short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and PCE of the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells are all superior to those of perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cells. Compared to the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cells, the 22% and 25% enhancements in the average Jsc and PCE are respectively attained in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells. An average PCE of 11.53% is measured in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the deviations of photovoltaic parameters of the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells are all smaller than those in the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cells. Photocurrent (J)–voltage (V) curves of the best devices for the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells are shown in Fig. 4. An efficiency of 13.17% is monitored in the best device of the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells.

Typical external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells are shown in Fig. 5a. In this work, photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cells were monitored under atmosphere without encapsulation. Due to the degradation of perovskites, the integrated EQE current density value is always lower than the Jsc, which has been reported in the literature as well.33 Nevertheless, the ratio of Jsc and the integrated EQE current density of every perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured solar cell can be maintained as a constant by carefully scheduling the measurement time under the same procedure. As shown in Fig. 5a, higher EQE values are obtained in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. Compared to the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell, 22% enhancement in the EQE integrated current density, which is consistent with the improvement of average Jsc, is obtained in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. With 1D and 3D TiO2 nanostructured arrays respectively in the cells, light harvesting and charge collection in the perovskite–TiO2 NR and perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells, which determine the EQE values and the cell efficiency, were then investigated in this work.
 Fig. 5  (a) EQE spectra, (b) LHE spectra, and (c) IQE spectra of perovskite–TiO2 NR and perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells. 

Fig. 5b shows the light harvest efficiency (LHE) spectra of the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells, which are obtained from the relationship of (1 − total transmittance (T) − total reflectance (R)). With the same thicknesses of the active layers, the volume of MAPbI3 scaffolded by the TiO2 ND array is ∼10% less than that scaffolded by the TiO2 NR array due to the presence of the branches in the TiO2 ND array. Interestingly, the LHEs of the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell are not inferior to those of the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell. The LHEs of the two cells remain at ∼90% in the wavelength range of 350–500 nm and gradually decrease with increasing the wavelength. At the wavelengths ranging from 600–750 nm, the LHEs of the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell are even slightly larger than those of the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell. This well confirms the FDTD simulation results that the TiO2 ND array is a superior nanophotonic light trapping structure in the active layer of the perovskite solar cell. Although the volume of MAPbI3 in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell is less, the light trapping effect induced by the 3D ND configuration results in the increase of the light harvest efficiency of MAPbI3 in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell compared to that in the perovskite–TiO2 NR one.
The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra of the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells are further recorded using the relationship IQE = EQE/LHE. It has been reported that the photocarrier dynamics of MAPbI3 are well described by using a free-carrier model instead of the exciton model.34 The IQE values of the two MAPbI3–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells are mainly determined by the charge collection efficiencies. As shown in Fig. 5c, compared to the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell, higher IQE values are obtained in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. It indicates that the charge collection efficiency in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell is superior to that in the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell. The IQE modulation (ΔIQE) of the two cells is also illustrated in this figure. It clearly reveals that IQE enhancements are more significant at the longer wavelengths.
It has been reported that the effective diffusion lengths of holes and electrons are not comparable in the MAPbI3-based cells. The effective diffusion length of electrons is much shorter than that of holes (∼1 μm).14 Before recombination, electrons can travel only a relatively short distance compared to holes in the MAPbI3-based cells. In the perovskite–TiO2 NR cell, the space between the adjacent NRs is ∼60 nm and the thickness of the active layer is 460 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a and c, respectively. Photogenerated holes in the active layer can efficiently reach the spiro-MeOTAD layer. Photoelectrons in MAPbI3, which are generated within an electron diffusion length of the MAPbI3–TiO2 junction side (named effective photoelectron generation region hereafter), can be effectually injected into TiO2 NRs followed by transporting to the FTO electrode. However, due to the short electron diffusion length, the photoelectrons created out of the effective photoelectron generation region, especially in the region near the spiro-MeOTAD layer, won't efficiently reach the FTO electrode.
With TiO2 branches developed from the trunks (NRs) in the quasi-single-crystalline 3D TiO2 ND array of the active layer, additional electron transport pathways through MAPbI3 → TiO2 branch → TiO2 trunk → FTO electrode are established in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. The presence of TiO2 branches in the active layer increases the MAPbI3–TiO2 junction area and therefore the number of photoelectrons created within the effective photoelectron generation region, which is beneficial to the photoelectron collection by the reduction of the distances of electron transport in MAPbI3. It results in the improvement of IQE in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell as shown in Fig. 5c. Compared to the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell, the electron collection efficiency and the Jsc are consequently improved in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. On the other hand, interfacial recombination occurs more frequently in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells because of the enlarged MAPbI3–TiO2 junction area. It brings about a slightly poor FF in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. Additionally, more significant IQE enhancement in the long wavelength range further supports the fact that the TiO2 ND array in the active layer facilitates the photoelectron collection in the perovskite solar cell. The details of which are discussed with the following FDTD simulation results.
FDTD simulations were also conducted for the EM energy density distribution in the perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells as 450 nm and 650 nm continuous EM waves enter from the TiO2 nanostructured array side. When a 450 nm continuous EM wave passes through both 460 nm-thick active layers of perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured arrays, as illustrated in Fig. 6a and b, the EM energy density significantly decreases in the MAPbI3 region as it approaches the spiro-MeOTAD layer, which is ascribed to the high absorption coefficient of MAPbI3 at a wavelength of 450 nm (Fig. 5b). It indicates that photocharges in both active layers generated by absorbing the 450 nm light are mainly concentrated in the region near the FTO substrate. However, due to the relatively lower absorption coefficient of MAPbI3 at 650 nm (Fig. 5b), the EM energy density gradually gets weakened in the MAPbI3 domain when the 650 nm light passes through the active layer, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Photocarriers, which are generated by harvesting the 650 nm light, are distributed in the whole active layer regions of the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured solar cells.
 Fig. 6  FDTD simulated EM energy density distribution in solar cells after continuous EM waves passing through: (a) perovskite–TiO2 ND with 450 nm, (b) perovskite–TiO2 NR with 450 nm, (c) perovskite–TiO2 ND with 650 nm, and (d) perovskite–TiO2 NR with 650 nm. 
FDTD simulation results (Fig. 6) reveal that in the perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured solar cells, the photocharges existing in the region of active layers far away from the FTO electrode (nearby the spiro-MeOTAD layer) are mainly generated by the absorption of sunlight with longer wavelengths. In the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell, the appearance of branches of ND arrays in the active layer efficiently shortens the distances of electron transport in the MAPbI3 matrix compared to that in the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell. The additional electron transport pathway in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell especially assists the collection of the photoelectrons in the region near the spiro-MeOTAD layer where photocharges are generated by absorbing the long-wavelength light. Therefore, more significant IQE enhancements at the longer wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 5c, confirm the superior electron collection in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell.
Conclusions
We reported a nanophotonic perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell the active layer of which is composed of MAPbI3 scaffolded by a quasi-single-crystalline TiO2 ND array. Compared to the perovskite–TiO2 NR solar cell, the enhancement of PCE through improved control of both electron collection and light propagation has been achieved in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. The 3D NDs efficiently extract the photoelectrons from MAPbI3 to surmount the obstacle of short electron diffusion length through reducing the electron transport length in the MAPbI3 matrix, which has been confirmed by the enhanced IQE values in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell. The TiO2 ND array in the active layer not only performs as an efficient electron collector but also induces significant light trapping in the perovskite solar cells due to the 3D configuration. The light harvesting efficiency in the perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cell is therefore improved as well. The concept demonstrated in this work, the integration of a nanophotonic structure into the active layer of the perovskite solar cell with the dual functions of light trapping and charge collection provides a new approach to challenge the typical issues of short electron diffusion length and low optical absorption towards highly efficient solar cells.
Experimental
Growth of TiO2 nanostructured arrays
TiO2 NR arrays were grown on the FTO substrates in the hydrothermal solution of HCl and titanium tert-n-butoxide at 150 °C. In order to develop branches on the NRs,30–32 the sprout-like nanostructures were first formed on the TiO2 NRs in a solution of HCl and titanium tertisopropoxide at 95 °C. After another hydrothermal process for lengthening the sprouts on the NRs, the ND array was then constructed on the FTO substrate. Tiny TiO2 NPs were further deposited on the surfaces of the NR and ND arrays using an aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 50 °C followed by heat treatment at 450 °C. The morphologies of the TiO2 nanostructured arrays were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010).
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured array solar cells are all fabricated with island-type electrodes35 in the present work. A dimethylformamide solution of PbI2 (460 mg ml−1, prepared at 70 °C) was infiltrated into the interstices of the TiO2 nanostructured array by spin-coating at 6500 rpm for 90 s in a N2-filled glovebox. After being dried at 70 °C for 30 min and cooling to room temperature, the PbI2 infiltrated TiO2 nanostructured array was then immersed in a 2-propanol solution of CH3NH3I (40 mg ml−1) for 3.5 min followed by spin drying. The active layer was further annealed at 80 °C for 30 min. A hole transport layer was spun onto the active layer using a chlorobenzene solution of spiro-MeOTAD, 4-tert-butylpyridine and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide at 4000 rpm for 30 s. A 70 nm-thick gold layer was deposited on the top of the spiro-MeOTAD layer by the sputtering method.
FDTD simulations
The simulations of the electromagnetic energy density distributions in the perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured solar cells were conducted by the FDTD method with perfectly matched layers using the commercially available FullWAVE, Rsoft software (Synopsys). The FDTD simulation cells for the perovskite–TiO2 NR and perovskite–TiO2 ND solar cells are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The MAPbI3, TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD were modeled using the full frequency-dependent dielectric function.15,36,37 The EM energy density distributions in the two perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured solar cells were simulated using both Gaussian pulse and continuous EM waves with wavelengths of 450 nm and 650 nm. The EM waves entered the solar cells from the FTO side. The resolution of the grid was 2 nm.
Characterization of solar cells
Absorption spectra of the perovskite–TiO2 nanostructured arrays were taken by using a UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670). Photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cells were monitored under atmosphere without encapsulation. JV characterization was conducted right after the cell fabrication and EQE measurements were carried out afterwards with carefully scheduling the measurement time. JV characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM-1.5 simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 (300 W, model 91160A, Oriel). A black-painted mask on the FTO substrate side was used to create an exposed area of 0.13 cm2 for all perovskite solar cells. The EQE was measured using a 500 W xenon light source (Oriel) and a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone) equipped with a Si detector (model 71640, Oriel).
