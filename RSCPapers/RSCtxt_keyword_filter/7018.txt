    First published on 14th October 2020AbstractAn evolving trend toward the ever-growing market of portable and wearable electronics has accelerated development in the construction of multifunctional energy generation and storage systems that can be twisted and folded to multiple deformations while retaining their electrochemical performance. The latest advances and well developed approaches for the design of heterocyclic solid-state organic ionic conductors (SOICs) in flexible energy generation and storage devices are discussed here. The development of SOICs with improved physical, optical, and electrochemical properties provides new prospects for flexible photoelectrochemical cells and supercapacitors. Equipped with a better knowledge of SOICs’ multifunctional properties, researchers have made considerable progress in their development that allows modification according to the requirements of different types of flexible energy devices. Within this review, we highlight the design of efficient SOICs and their incorporation into flexible energy generation and storage devices, and address exciting instances that profile the multifunctionality of SOICs such as three-dimensional (3D) ionic channels, excellent thermal stability, dual functionality (hole/ions transportation), one-dimensional (1D) lamellar network, light-harvesting, and non-toxicity to mention a few. It is expected that innovative and customizable properties utilized in the development of multifunctional SOICs will provide a forum for future advancement in flexible and wearable energy generation and storage devices.

1. Introduction
The primary source of world energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, which produces significant amounts of toxic gases (sulfur, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) and results in growing environmental pollution and temperature,1–3 which is a critical issue facing the global community.4,5 Limited fossil fuel sources have led to the development of clean and renewable energy generation and storage systems that are efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. In the last two decades, much progress has been made toward the development of sustainable energy generation and storage systems for diverse applications from grid-scale electricity to small portable devices. Owing to the outlook and demand for advanced electronic technology with revolutionary features discovered by users in our modern society, the development of relevant technologies, and the opening up of new technology opportunities are consistently and significantly taken into account.6 Already, many unique designs and concepts of flexible electronic devices, such as electronic skins, wearable electronics, integrated medical devices, foldable displays, mobiles and clothes that can be flexible, bendable, stretchable, and foldable are commercially available.7–10 To operate flexible gadgets, there is a need to build similarly versatile and portable energy generation and storage devices that can maintain their electrochemical performance under various strong deformations (Fig. 1). Consequently, there have been many attempts to develop high-performance flexible energy generation and storage devices, e.g., dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs), organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (OIHPSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), fuel cells, supercapacitors (SCs), and metal-ion batteries. Among them, photoelectrochemical devices (DS-PECs, OIHPSCs, OSCs) and SC devices have been extensively examined for realistic practical applications due to their simple assembly, low cost, lightweight, excellent flexibility, and environmental friendliness.11–14

For such electrochemical devices, electrolytes are a crucial common component. The role of electrolytes in various electrochemical devices is to maintain a charge by providing a medium for ions or charge transfer (electron/hole) between the positive anode and negative cathode. To achieve high efficiency with adequate flexibility and life span, many works have been devoted to developing suitable and efficient electrode and electrolyte materials. This review offers fundamental information for finding new multifunctional electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance for various flexible energy generation and storage devices. In spite of the progress made so far, in reality, there are still many obstacles as development is still at an early stage. The use of liquid electrolytes in high-performance energy generation and storage devices causes a practical problem of volatilization and leakages, photo-degradation of light-absorbing materials, electrode corrosion, and inadequate sealing of devices for long-term outdoor applications.15,16
In particular, flexible energy-generating devices take many approaches, including the use of solvent-free polymer electrolytes,17 organic or inorganic hole (ionic) conductors,18 and gelling agents. A typical function of these alternative electrolytes is a significant decrease in the performance of the resulting energy-generating devices due to reduced charge (ions/holes) mobility in the solid or quasi-solid media and poor pore-filling with the electrolyte. For instance, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of DS-PECs with polymer gel electrolyte usually does not increase by more than eight percent. Even at low performance, these DS-PECs can become better alternatives to the liquid electrolyte containing Gratzel photoelectrochemical cells due to its enhanced durability and exceptional sealing capability. On the other hand, flexible energy storage devices with polymer hydrogel have faced several drawbacks such as narrow operating voltage window, poor penetration into electrode pores, lower energy density, poor contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and so forth.19,20 However, solid-state electrolytes utilized in these flexible energy devices appear to have limited practical use because strong mechanical stresses create breakage of the electrolyte/electrode interface, which is not desirable for scale-up. In addition, boosting the conductivity and performance of electrolytes through supportive multicomponent additives generates complexity and results in a decrease in overall performance and increase in cost. Recently, many researchers have been trying to explore the possibility of increasing electrochemical performance by designing novel multifunctional and environmentally friendly electrolytes.
There have been some useful review reports based on solid-state electrolytes such as polymer gel electrolyte (PGE),17,21 quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSSE),22 and hole transport materials.23 However, it is worth reporting this first-time review on heterocyclic solid-state organic ionic conductors (SOICs) in the area of flexible energy generation and storage. To solve several electrolyte-related issues (discussed in the next section), SOICs present alternative materials that can be used in both types of flexible energy devices. However, the benefit of SOICs is their excellent electrochemical properties compared with conventional electrolytes. The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive view of the role of various kinds of SOICs in energy generation and storage devices. The influence of different functional groups and supportive additives on SOICs electrochemical properties and flexible energy device performance is also discussed. Single component (avoids the use of toxic and hazardous additives) and multifunctional SOICs properties (i.e., optical, electrochemical and thermal properties) paves the way for the development of environmentally friendly, affordable, better-performing, and long-term stable flexible devices, leading toward commercialization of the same.
2. Molecular architecture of novel SOICs
SOICs are a new class of solid-state electrolyte containing various types of cations (i.e., quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, imidazolium, pyridinium, etc.) and anions (i.e., I−, Br−, SCN−, TFSI−, etc.), with different properties than conventional electrolytes. If we analyze only the currently reported SOICs, then these could be categorized again into aromatic and non-aromatic SOICs. In view of the structural skeleton, they are solid-state derivatives of ionic liquids (ILs). SOICs have a tendency to overcome IL fluidity by maintaining their unique properties like solidity, chemical durability, low toxicity, and electrochemical and thermodynamic stability. However, a few SOICs, although suffering from low ionic conductivity, can provide excellent charge transfer (electrons and hole) for the doped ions as a chemically introduced skeleton.
Especially when compared with PGE and QSSE, SOICs display excellent electrochemical and thermal properties. Most importantly, they can be designed and modified according to the requirements of different types of electrochemical devices (Fig. 2). Tunability of SOICs allows modification of physical, optical, and electrical properties and achieves selective wavelength absorption, conductivity, and thermal stability through substitution with different functional groups. For instance: (i) ester-functionalized imidazolium (IM) cations enhance the charge transfer process and ionic conductivity by creating a 3D ionic channel;24 (ii) alkyl chain length minimizes electron recombination, leading to increased open-circuit voltage (Voc);25 (iii) non-aromatic pyrrolidinium dications conjugated with different alkyl chains display excellent thermal stability, diffusion coefficient, and high melting point;26 (iv) carbazole group delivers dual-functional channels for hole and I3− transportation;27 (v) hetero-anthracene derivatives increase light-harvesting properties and durability of DS-PECs;28etc. Considering the above characteristics, SOICs represent a promising candidate for energy generation devices.

(b) Highlighting the multifunctional properties of novel SOICs. 
However, the use of SOICs for flexible DS-PECs has not been reported to date. Hence, it is worth discussing the vital role of SOICs in developing highly efficient, customizable, and flexible devices for energy generation. On the other hand, research on SOICs is still in the initial stage and very few SOICs are used in the energy storage field. The substitution of small heterocyclic components and functional groups (acidic or basic) in SOICs can be used to satisfy unique needs such as specific cation size, electron transfer rate, mechanical properties, long-term cyclic stability, and ionic conductivity. Usually, SOICs are not limited by the selection of electrolyte material suitable for a variety of organic electrodes (cathode or anode) in energy storage devices (Zn-, Li-, and Na-type batteries).
3. Flexible energy generation devices
As a class of renewable devices for generating electricity, solar cells are the future of advanced technology and have outstanding potential for producing solar power on a wide scale. Here we look at four families (i.e., DS-PECs, Bio-PECs, OIHPSCs, and OSCs) of flexible third-generation solar cell technologies and discuss their operating principles, mechanisms, and performance with various multifunctional SOICs.
3.1 Flexible dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs)

3.1.1 Structural and operating mechanism of flexible DS-PECs. 
DS-PECs have been widely explored as an alternative renewable energy source in the last two decades due to their numerous benefits, including low manufacturing cost, easy fabrication process under environmental conditions, availability of feedstock, colorfulness and transparency, good performance toward low light intensity, and recyclable and feasible roll-to-roll (R2R) coating process for the TiO2-photoanode.29–31 Typical DS-PEC skeletons consist of four different components: light-absorbing materials (metal and metal-free dye), n-type semiconductor (TiO2), electrolyte and platinum back electrode32 (Fig. 3a). Among them, the electrolyte provides considerable impact on the performance of PCE and durability of DS-PECs. The electrolyte in DS-PECs and interaction between the electrolyte and photoanode interfaces would be significantly influenced to the photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). In DS-PECs, an electrolyte containing an iodide (I−)/triiodide (I3−) redox couple is essential as it acts as a mediator and transfers charges from the anode (TiO2-photoanode) to the cathode (platinum counter electrode) using its redox species, and regenerates oxidized sensitizer at the TiO2-photoanode/electrolyte interface.33,34 To date, DS-PECs based on metal-free sensitizer and liquid I−/I3− redox couple have reported the highest PCE of 11.7%.35
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic view of the flexible DS-PCE and its layer-by-layer components. (b) Working principle and charge transfer mechanism of flexible DS-PECs. 
Besides, DS-PECs show effective light-harvesting ability under critical conditions such as cloudy and rainy days, or low light intensity.36 The major challenge encountered thus far is their long-term stability. Solvent leakage and volatilization, degradation of light-absorbing materials, and counter (Pt) electrode corrosion are the limiting factors for the long-term use of DS-PECs.37–40 Therefore, comprehensive research has been carried out to establish alternative solid-state electrolytes.41–43 The DS-PECs operating mechanism presented in Fig. 3b describes four steps: step-i: dye is excited upon exposure to sunlight and excited ground-state electrons (Dye-TiO2 + light → Dye*-TiO2) are injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 thin film (Dye*-TiO2 → Dye+-TiO2 + eCB-TiO2); step-ii: excited electrons pass through the TiO2 matrix, accumulate at a conductive substrate (i.e., PET-ITO) and travel toward a platinum counter electrode (Dye+-TiO2 + eCB-TiO2 → Dye+-TiO2); step-iii: at the platinum electrode, the electrons reduce the I3− ions contained in the electrolyte into I− ions (1/2I3− + e(Pt) → 3/2I−); and step-iv: in parallel, these I− ions are oxidized into I3− ions through redox reaction with the oxidized dye (Dye+-TiO2 + 3/2I− → Dye-TiO2 + 1/2I3−).


3.1.2 SOICs in flexible DS-PECs. 
Over the last two decades, several modifications and various types of electrolytes have been used to develop efficient DS-PECs. Based on this, all redox couple electrolytes are classified by their physical state such as LSEs, QSSEs, and SSEs. As mentioned initially by B. O’Regan and co-workers, liquid state electrolytes contain iodide (I−) and iodine (I2) salts dissolved in acetonitrile and ethylene carbonate solvent.32 The I−/I3− electrolytes have become more popular due to their quick dye regeneration, high ionic conductivity, excellent stability of the redox pair, easy penetration into the TiO2 matrix, and lower light absorption. To achieve higher efficiency of DS-PECs, numerous modifications have been made on redox couple electrolyte components (i.e., the variation of ionic salts, metal clusters, organic solvents, and supporting additives) and established other redox couple electrolytes such as Co(II/III), Br−/Br3−, Fc/Fc+, SCN−/(SCN−)3, Cu(I/II), Ni(III/IV), etc.16,44 DS-PECs were assembled using porphyrin-based sensitizers and collaborative (carbazole and triphenylamine) sensitizers with cobalt redox shuttle have displayed a PCE value of 13% and 14%, respectively.45,46 These liquid redox couple electrolytes contain various kinds of organic solvents (N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), acetonitrile (ACN), valeronitrile, 3-methoxy acetonitrile, ethylene, carbonate, propylene carbonate (PC), propionitrile (PPN) γ-butyrolactone (GBL), etc.)16 that have a higher dielectric constant and lower viscosity. Nevertheless, the availability of organic solvent and inorganic ionic salts (i.e., LiI, I2, and other metal salts) in the redox couple electrolyte achieves impressive efficiency but introduces several restrictions, for example: (i) the leakage of organic solvents, which are highly volatile and can cause explosions and environmental degradation; (ii) iodine is a highly corrosive component; (iii) continuous contact of the TiO2-dye photoanode with liquid electrolyte leads to desorption and degradation of the dye; and (iv) long–term, triiodide ions may be converted to the polyiodide chain (absorb the spectrum at visible region), resulting in a decrease in device performance and durability. Additionally, liquid electrolyte-based DS-PECs are difficult to produce as large-scale modules as this would require chemically assembling and electrically linking each module in a single substrate47
Furthermore, the replacement of toxic solvents with water as electrolyte would be safer for the environment and inexpensive. The introduction of an aqueous electrolyte in DS-PECs, dye desorption occurs in a short time due to the highly hydrophilic nature of the TiO2-photoanode. Previously, aqueous electrolyte-based DS-PECs were made with various types of organic components (e.g., thixotropic gel and (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives)48 and showed substantially lower performance than LSEs and IL-based DS-PECs. One method to overcome the above-mentioned liquid electrolyte issues is to use the non-volatile, non-flammable, and high boiling point nature of ILs and QSSEs in DS-PECs.22,49 The role of IL electrolyte is to improve the durability of DS-PECs; however, its high viscosity is diminished due to TiO2 pore-filling and the charge transport process.50,51 However, QSSEs have thermodynamically unstable and quick-growing crystals on the TiO2 surface, causing poor interface contact. For these reasons, developing an environmentally sustainable, effective, highly stable, and low toxicity solid-state electrolyte materials remains a significant challenge (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of aromatic SOIC-1 to SOIC-49. 
Organic moiety-based ionic conductors with excellent ionic conductivity are a vital candidate for solid-state DS-PECs. Currently, ionic conductors are gaining considerable attention owing to their fast solidification, better thermal stability, and high ionic conductivity. Among all the heterocyclic cations with quaternary-charged nitrogen (NR4+), those obtained from the IM ring are most commonly used for solid-state DS-PECs.52,53 In fact, the non-aromatic nature of IM means excellent electrochemical stability. Several ILs based on imidazolium iodide (e.g., 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII), 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMIMI)) with varying alkyl substituents and their mixtures, have been used in DS-PECs due to their high conductivity, non-toxicity, large operating windows, and negligible vapor pressure. However, they are a viscous liquid and leakage is inevitable during long-term application. The practical application of flexible DS-PECs requires a solid-state electrolyte with excellent ionic conductivity.
3.1.2.1 Alkyl-substituted five-membered SOICs. 
For the above necessity, SOICs based on ester (–COOR′) and different alkyl chain length functionalized IM cations are promising candidates for solid-state DS-PECs.24 This new form of SOICs (SOIC-1–SOIC-5) offers remarkable advantages compared with conventional electrolytes. The interaction between –COOR′ and IM cations may create a dimer of SOICs and minimize the chain distance of polyiodides to allow quick charge transfer along with excellent ionic conductivity. In addition, –COOR′-functionalized SOICs deliver adequate ionic mobility through three-dimensional (3D) polyiodide channels.54 Electrolyte ionic conductivity is a significant parameter of solid-state DS-PECs performance. The presence of a 3D ionic channel in small alkyl side chain-substituted –COOR′-functionalized SOIC-1 indicate high ionic mobility and ionic conductivity (σ = 0.02 mS cm−1) without introducing any additives. The addition of supportive additives, like iodide and lithium iodide, to SOIC-1 demonstrated substantial improvements in the conductivity (σ = 5.76 mS cm−1). This expansion in ionic conductivity begins with the polyiodide (I3−) arrangement by reacting I2 and I− ions. The creation of an iodide chain allows charge transfer across the chain through the Grotthuss exchange mechanism,55 which is the crucial factor for a significant rise of ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain in SOICs is vital for the thermal stability, conductivity, and solidification of SOICs. Small alkyl chain (–CH3, –C2H5, and –C3H7) substitutions in SOICs has a strong electrostatic interaction, which is reduced by extending the alkyl chain; i.e., the melting point is reduced from SOIC-1 to SOIC-3 (95 to 57 °C).56 Long alkyl chain (–C6H13 and –C12H25) substitution in SOICs has a robust van der Waals force, which is enhanced by extending the alkyl chain; i.e., the melting point rises from SOIC-4 to SOIC-5. Likewise, the SOIC skeleton alkyl chain length increases with reduced ionic conductivity because the large alkyl chain interferes with ionic mobility into the polyiodides’ pathway, and decreasing conductivity (with and without additives) and solidification of SOICs with prolongation of the alkyl chain (see Table 1, SOIC-1–SOIC-5).

To evaluate photovoltaic performance, solid-state DS-PECs were fabricated using carbazole-based dye as the light-absorbing material and SOIC-1 as the solid electrolyte along with additives such as I2, LiI, and 1-methyl-3-ethyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIm+BF4−). Single-component (without additives) SOIC-1 failed to generate a photocurrent due to the lack of triiodide, which is required for electron transfer at a platinum electrode. Doping of I2 and LiI into SOIC-1 shows PCE of 0.91% (Jsc = 4.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 480 mV, and FF = 0.40%) and 2.29% (Jsc = 6.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 570 mV, and FF = 0.67%), respectively. Further enhanced PCE up to 6.63% (Jsc = 13.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 660 mV, and FF = 0.73%), when 0.25 M EMIm+BF4−, 1.0 mole I2, and 1.25 mole LiI are added into the SOIC-1.
In terms of the impact of the functional group on device performance, without the –COOR′ group, SOICs exhibit deficient performance (PCE = 1.46%) and the alkyl chain length rises with reduced Jsc in the order SOIC-5(–C12H25) < SOIC-4(–C6H13) < SOIC-3(–C3H7) < SOIC-2(–C2H5) < SOIC-1(–CH3). The small alkyl chain of SOIC achieves better pore-filling in the porous TiO2-photoanode, which encourages the regeneration of oxidized dye molecules and generates a high photocurrent response in DS-PECs. Besides, the researchers investigated the effect of –COOR′ group on TiO2-dye photoanode and counter electrode interfaces by electrochemical impedance technique.57 It was observed that the –COOR′ functional group decreased series resistance between the TiO2 semiconductor/SOIC interface, shifting the conduction band edge of the semiconductor upward and enhancing charge collection efficiency. As a result, the solid-state DS-PECs’ efficiency was significantly enhanced by adding the –COOR′ functional group to the IM ring. Further, SOIC-1 containing a small alkyl side chain was replaced by hydroxyethyl (SOIC-6) functional group to generate over 10% increment in overall performance (PCE = 7.45%, Jsc = 14.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 733 mV, and FF = 0.69%) of solid-state DS-PECs.54 These researchers proved the existence of 3D ionic channels for I− by developing a single crystal of SOIC-6.
Ionic crystals are one of the categories of crystalline materials and comprise cations and anions that have electrochemical properties different than conventional crystals.58 The ionic nature of ionic crystals is indicative of their type of ionic conductor.59–61 The high ionic conductivity and broad electrochemical window deriving from the heterocyclic moiety (IM) based ILs. For example, in 2008, a modified IL chemical structure was used to develop a small SOIC-7 (1-methyl-3-acetylimidazolium iodide) utilizing an equimolar segment of N-methylimidazole and iodoacetic acid.62 There is enough space for improving the ionic conductivity (10−2 mS cm−1) of carboxy-(–COOH)-functionalized IMI. SOIC-7, with the introduction of supporting additives (i.e., I2, Li[(CF3SO2)2N], 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP), and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate (MP-BF4)), exhibited PCE of 2.6% (Jsc = 2.77 mA cm−2, Voc = 640 mV, and FF = 0.75%) and 2.0% (Jsc = 4.42 mA cm−2, Voc = 647 mV, and FF = 0.71%) upon illumination of 50 mW cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. Then, several SOICs were discovered for solid-state electrolytes that demonstrated the impressive performance of solid-state DS-PECs. For instance, IM-based SOICs’ conjugation with thienyl (–C4H3S) and phenyl (–C6H5) aromatic groups (SOIC-8–SOIC-10), recorded the highest PCE of 8.36% (Jsc = 15.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 782 mV, and FF = 0.70%) with > 2000 h stability (around 97% PCE retention) upon continuous illumination of 100 mW cm−2 intensity.63 The phenoxazine substituted IMI (PTZ-IMI)-based SOIC reported PCE of 5.7% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 720 mV, and FF = 0.64%) with 1000 h durability.64 Solid-state cyanobiphenyl-substituted IM electrolyte achieved PCE of 5.11% (at 55 °C, Jsc = 14.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 568 mV, and FF = 0.61%) and 1000 h stability under illumination of 100 mW cm−2.60 Carbazole donor moiety-substituted IMI was explored for dual transportation of electrons and holes.2
However, most of the electrolytes mentioned above are restricted to IMI-based SOICs, which limits research into the conductive process and its operation. In this case, a series of different alkyl-substituted benzothiazole and thiazole dicationic SOICs have been synthesized (SOIC-11–SOIC-17).25 Such large size dications minimize electron recombination at the dye-sensitized TiO2-photoanode and SOIC interface, leading to increased Voc. As seen in Table 1, the series of benzothiazole-based dicationic SOICs (SOIC-11–SOIC-14), exhibits >200 °C thermal stability, which allows the outdoor application of solid-state DS-PECs. The ionic conductivity of benzothiazole SOICs is gradually enhance with alkyl chain substitution from propane to pentane (σ = 0.215–0.444 mS cm−1), but then rapidly reduces with substitution of the hexane chain. A similar trend was noted in the diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of the iodide–triiodide redox pair: SOIC-13 exhibits the highest triiodide Dapp of 0.484 × 10−6 cm2 S−1. From the above analysis, the J–V characteristic demonstrated that the SOIC-13-based DS-PEC had Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 794 mV, and FF of 0.52%, which corresponds to a PCE value of 7.90%, whereas the photovoltaic performance of different substituted dications thiazole-based SOICs (SOIC-16 and SOIC-17) showed lower Voc and PCE compared with benzothiazole-based SOICs due to the bulkier cation found in SOIC affecting the Voc.64,65
The FF is an essential parameter for solid state DS-PECs because it evaluates the maximum achievable PCE along with Jsc and Voc. According to the literature survey, DS-PECs based on solid-state SOICs reported PCE above 7%, with a FF value of approximately 60–70%, which is lower than those of liquid electrolyte-based DS-PECs (see Table 1). Voc is another key parameter regarding DS-PEC performance and is also less than those of DS-PECs based on liquid electrolytes. For improving the Voc and FF of solid-state DS-PECs, different alkyl chain-substituted bis(pyrrolidinium) cations (alkyl chains such as –C4H8–, –C5H10–, –C6H12–, and –C8H16–) and anions (SCN−, TFSI−, and Br−)-based SOICs have been synthesized (SOIC-18 to SOIC-24).26 Photovoltaic performance of SOIC-24-based DS-PECs displayed the highest Jsc of 12.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 810 mV, and FF of 0.60%, leading to an overall PCE of 6.02% upon illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is superior to the DS-PECs reported with other pyrrolidinium-based SOICs. SOIC-24-based DS-PECs also display excellent thermal stability and high ionic conductivity, melting point, and diffusion coefficient. Similarly, other dicationic SOICs based on pyrazolium cation and thiocyanate anion were reported by Zeng et al., (SOIC-25 and SOIC-26).59 The pyrazolium-based cation seems to have a similar aromatic heterocyclic skeleton to the IM cation, except that it contains nitrogen atoms in different positions. Pyrazolium-based derivatives are identified by excellent ionic conductivity and unique electrochemical characteristics that are engaging for use as an electrolyte in DS-PECs.66 The bis-pyrazolium thiocyanate (SOIC-25)-based DS-PEC delivered a Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 779 mV, and FF of 0.79%, resulting in an overall PCE of 7.30%. In similar conditions, mono-pyrazolium thiocyanate (SOIC-26)-based DS-PECs exhibited maximum PCE of 5.47% with corresponding Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2, Voc of 766 mV, and FF of 0.79% under illumination of 100 mW cm−2.
3.1.2.2 Pyridinium-based SOICs. 
Pyridinium-based SOICs are compatible with conventional IMI-based SOICs. They are easy to synthesize and less costly compared with the IMI series of SOICs. Many of the pyridine derivatives (i.e., 2-methylpyridine, 4-tert-pyridine, 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 2-methyl-4-propoxypyridine, etc.) have been used as electrolyte additives to increase the band edge (Fermi level) of the TiO2 semiconductor and the rate of recombination.67–71 It is also highly susceptible to oxidation along with transparency in a broad range of wavelengths. Based on the above-mentioned properties, it would be more useful to develop low-cost and highly stable DS-PECs. Han et al.,65 have developed a series of alkyl (odd/even carbon chains) substituted pyridinium-based SOICs (SOIC-28–SOIC-34) and examined the cationic influence on the TiO2-photoanode with reliance on length of the alkyl chain. When the –CH3 group substituted on a different position of pyridinium SOIC, the Voc and PCE gradually decreased in the order SOIC-29 (Voc of 689 mV and PCE of 7.50%) > SOIC-29α (Voc of 665 mV and PCE of 7.14%) > SOIC-29β (Voc of 648 mV and PCE of 7.08%) > SOIC-29γ (Voc of 630 mV and PCE of 7.05%). Voc is not influenced effectively by substitution of different lengths of alkyl chain (–C2H5 to –C9H20) on pyridinium SOICs. However, even-numbered alkyl chains (–C2H5, –C4H9, –C6H13, and –C8H17 that exhibit Voc values of 690 mV, 689 mV, 696 mV, and 705 mV, respectively) displayed relatively higher Voc than odd-numbered alkyl chains (–C3H7, –C5H11, –C7H15, and –C9H19 showed Voc value of 683 mV, 681 mV, and 684 mV, respectively).
New electron-withdrawing chalcone functional group-substituted pyridinium cation with iodide and bromide anions-based SOICs (SOIC-35 and SOIC-36) exhibit low toxicity, thermal stability (melting point >100 °C), high ionic conductivity, cationic effect, environmental sustainability, excellent catalytic property on a platinum electrode, and high stability in an aqueous medium.72 The J–V characteristic of DS-PECs with water in SOIC-35 and SOIC-36 exhibited overall PCE retention of 61.6% (PCE = 5.61% decreased to 3.46%) and 59.3% (PCE = 6.02% decreased to 3.57%), respectively. Further, they investigated the effect of chalcone group and solvent (water and acetonitrile) on pyridinium SOICs contain nitrogen cation atoms and redox potential by theoretical calculation. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) results suggest that the cationic charge elevates more in acetonitrile solvent relative to an aqueous environment, which concludes destabilization. The redox potential of the chalcone group-functionalized pyridinium SOICs moves toward the ground-level state of the dye and regenerates oxidized dye very quickly compared with pyridinium iodide (without chalcone group). The photovoltaic performance of aqueous DS-PECs was enabled by using single-component SOICs that delivered PCE of 0.9% (Jsc = 2.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 588 mV, and FF = 0.49%) and 0.7% (Jsc = 2.67 mA cm−2, Voc = 637 mV, and FF = 0.41%) for SOIC-35 and SOIC-36, respectively.
3.1.2.3 Phosphonium-based SOICs. 
As we have discussed, there has been intense attention given to nitrogen-based SOICs, such as benzothiazolium, pyrazolium, imidazolium, pyrrolidium, pyridinium, and piperidinium salts; however, very few studies have been performed on phosphonium-based conductors.73,74 Until now, solid conductors-based phosphonium cations have been overlooked and less focused on in the application of energy-generating devices (especially in DS-PECs)75,76 although these materials are smart and able enough to become more durable and, henceforth, have a longer life span compared with ammonium cations.77 For paradigm, Armel et al.,74 reported a series of ILs containing small alkyl chain substitution on phosphonium cations and various anions, which resulted in staggered conductivity along with electrochemical stability. Moreover, ILs based on the phosphonium cation have high thermal stability, low viscosity, and excellent ionic conductivity compared with the quaternary ammonium analog as stated by Tsunashima et al.78 In 2016, Ramirez and Sanchez fabricated DS-PECs using ILs-based phosphonium iodide as electrolyte and that exhibit the highest PCE of 5.7% upon simulated light illumination.79 However, they all are still a form of viscous liquid (or an ionic liquid kind) and leakage is possible with long-term use.
Recent efforts to incorporate a phosphonium-based solid-state electrolyte into DS-PECs have resulted in two phosphonium-based SOICs reported that were synthesized in a single-step procedure using triphenylphosphine with hydroiodic acid and methyl iodide (SOIC-37 and SOIC-38).80 These SOICs based on phosphonium cations demonstrated excellent thermal stability (>200 °C) and high melting points (>100 °C). The small amount of LiI insertion in both SOICs results in conductivity ten times higher than that of single-component SOICs (σ = 0.64–6.8 mS cm−1). They proposed that the doping of LiI in phosphonium SOICs largely boosted the current response because the LiI impurity effectively prevents back current and monitors I3− reduction by TiO2 electrons, resulting in the very smooth diffusion of ions transferred through the dye molecules. As a result, the obtained Jsc value for the SOIC-38 based solid-state DS-PEC is 9.56 mA cm−2, which is almost 30% higher than the single-component SOIC-38 (6.65 mA cm−2). The resultant J–V characteristics of LiI-doped SOIC-37- and SOIC-38-based solid-state DS-PECs are PCE of 6.7%, Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 824 mV, and FF of 0.78%, and PCE of 2.4%, Jsc of 4.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 623 mV, and FF of 0.68%, respectively.
3.1.2.4 Carbazole-based SOICs. 
Organic hole conductors (OHCs) demonstrate fascinating functionality and desirable alternatives to LSEs and ionic polymer electrolytes because they require a simple fabrication method and excellent charge mobility. Small OHCs, based on tetraphenyl benzidines (TPB) and triphenylamine (TPA), have been widely used as a hole transport layer (HTL) due to superior hole conductivity and purity.81–84 Substitution of TPB and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene is used to obtain highly soluble and amorphous Spiro-OMeTAD, which is delivered at more than 6% PCE in solid state DS-PEC.85 Spiro-OMeTAD does not contain any redox species (iodide–triiodide), but oxidized dye regenerates by using the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) electron of OHC and charge transport via a hopping mechanism. Similarly, SOICs based on carbazole (CBZ)-IMI effectively regenerate photo-excited dye molecules through the dual-functional channel (SOIC-39–SOIC-41).27 CBZ was selected as the OHC because many polymeric CBZ derivatives have been used as HTL in high-performance solid-state DS-PECs.86,87 The combination of CBZ-IM cation with I− anion (SOIC-40) delivers dual-functional channels for the hole and I3− transportation (Fig. 5). The corresponding solid-state DS-PEC showed the highest PCE of 2.85% (Jsc = 6.23 mA cm−2, Voc = 718 mV, and FF = 0.63%) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2.

3.1.2.5 Hetero-anthracene-based SOICs. 
In the context of the above study of dual-functional (hole/I3−) SOICs, a series of hetero-anthracene donor moieties (i.e., phenothiazine (PTZ) and phenoxazine (POZ))-functionalized IMI and benzimidazolium iodide (BIMI)-based SOICs (SOIC-42–SOIC-45) was reported by Soni et al.64 These SOICs possess better thermal stability (>150 °C), and melting points (>100 °C) along with excellent ionic conductivity (SOIC-43, σ = 2.94 mS cm−1; SOIC-45, σ = 3.61 mS cm−1). The obtained high ionic conductivity in SOIC can charge transport from the tightly packed polyiodides chain by the Grotthuss bond exchange mechanism, which is ten times greater than the above-discussed alkyl-substituted IMI-based SOICs. However, POZ-BIMI (SOIC-43) and POZ-IMI (SOIC-45) have a higher catalytic property and hole mobility (0.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 0.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively) than PTZ donor-substituted SOICs (0.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 0.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) due to POZ having better electron-donating capacity and smaller interlayer distance. The highly conjugated and electron-donating nature of hetero-anthracene moieties also result in light-harvesting properties. The thin film blend made layer-by-layer with CBZ dye-sensitized TiO2-photoanode and POZ substituted-SOIC materials exhibited around 65 nm improvement in the absorbance spectrum and, thus, higher efficiency in solid-state DS-PECs. In the presence of a single component, POZ-BIMI and POZ-IMI cation (SOIC-43 and SOIC-45)-based solid-state DS-PECs were performed with a maximum PCE of 5.3% (Jsc = 14.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 590 mV, and FF = 0.62%) and 5.7% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 720 mV, and FF = 0.64%), respectively. Further, they demonstrated long-term stability of >1000 h for POZ-IM-based solid-state DS-PEC under continuous illumination by sunlight.
Subsequently, the same SOIC-45 was used with di-anchoring carbazole-based dye for application in DS-PECs and exhibited overall PCEs of 5.20% (Jsc = 10.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 707 mV, and FF = 0.59%) and 4.02% (Jsc = 8.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 691 mV, and FF = 0.55%) in liquid and solid-state electrolytes.88 Besides, they illustrated durability of DS-PECs based on liquid-state vs. solid-state SOICs. After 25 days, liquid-state DS-PECs revealed that much of their electrolyte had evaporated while the solid-state DS-PEC maintained its electrolyte and performance. To see the light-harvesting contribution by SOIC in the device, solid-state DS-PECs were fabricated using di-anchoring hetero-anthracene-based sensitizers and SOIC, which have common donor moieties, i.e., PTZ and POZ.89 In the presence of light-harvesting cum electron-donor group, POZ/PTZ, the SOICs contribute to light-harvesting, controlling electron recombination, and the effective injection of excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band, which ultimately enhances the PCE value and achieves up to 8.7% (SOIC-45, Jsc = 16.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 770 mV, and FF = 0.70%), which is far better than the category of dimer-based sensitizers reported so far with normal electrolyte. DS-PECs assembled with this approach demonstrate excellent stability over 1600 h without facing the problem of electrolyte leakage or performance losses.
In the context of the above results, further work is required to establish promising SOICs with an appropriate substituent that can offer excellent light-harvesting properties, ionic conductivity, redox mediator functionality, and high PCE in solid-state DS-PECs. The SOICs based on hetero-anthracene-functionalized BIMI cations connected with a long alkyl chain between two identical donor moieties (SOIC-46 and SOIC-47), facilitate photo-generation, harvesting ability and ionic conductivity.28 The ultraviolet and visible spectra absorbed by SOICs assist to enhance the photo-generation for dye with their better I− diffusion/hole transport feature, and perform a double role within solid-state DS-PECs. The redox potential (ERedox) of SOIC is a pivotal parameter in describing the performance of solid-state DS-PECs, particularly for Voc, which correlates the gap between ERedox and band edge (Fermi level) of the TiO2 semiconductor. The ERedox value of SOIC is higher than the HOMO level of carbazole dye (SK3), which signifies the easy way for oxidized dye regeneration. Besides, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of SOICs has been found to be greater than the carbazole dye, allowing it to contribute electrons to the carbazole donor moiety of the dye. They mount SOIC-based solid-state DS-PECs with different thicknesses of TiO2 film for improved pore-filling capability. Among them, an 8 μm thickness of TiO2 film with SOIC-46 and SOIC-47 obtained a highest PCE value of 7.9% (Jsc = 16.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 739 mV, and FF = 0.63%) and 6.8% (Jsc = 13.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 735 mV, and FF = 0.64%), respectively. However, the IPCE percentage increased by 79% and 67% compared with conventional electrolyte (47%). To prevent complexity and unwanted side reactions in solid-state DS-PECs, the utilized single-component SOICs obtained PCE of 6.0% (SOIC-40, Jsc = 12.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 728 mV, and FF = 0.65%) and 5.60% (SOIC-41, Jsc = 11.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 720 mV, and FF = 0.66%) upon solar illumination.
To explore SOIC materials in a real-life application, two different energy transfer SOICs were developed, namely, ETRC-1 (1,1′-(10-butyl-10H-phenothiazine-3,7-diyl)bis(3-ethyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium) iodide) and ETRC-2 (1,1′-(10-butyl-10H-phenothiazine-3,7-diyl)bis(3-ethyl-1H-benzimidazol-3-ium) iodide) (SOIC-48 and SOIC-49).90
These SOICs possess stable redox shuttle with faster regeneration of oxidized dye, excellent light-harvesting ability, good catalytic property, and thermal stability. For improved light-absorption capacity of solid-state DS-PECs, the SOIC-substituted PTZ donor moiety transfers its excitation energy to a nearby acceptor molecule (here, N719 dye) having lower excitation energy via the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism (Fig. 6a). In the last few years, several small organic dyes, quantum dots, and co-sensitizers have been developed to support the FRET mechanism and extend light-absorption capacity in DS-PECs. For example, the tris(4-methoxyphenyl)amine molecule was combined with cobalt redox shuttle to improve overall performance (∼26%) and stability (90% retained after 250 h) of DS-PEC.91 The Spiro-TBT small molecule used as a secondary absorber in a TT1-based device exhibited 40% and 16.5% improvement of Jsc and PCE, respectively.92 From the literature survey, DS-PEC performance enhancement was obtained by the inclusion of a secondary absorber into either the electrolyte or sensitizer. This new feature in solid-state DS-PECs contains utilizes the dual nature SOICs (SOIC-48 and SOIC-49) that enables light-harvesting using a redox shuttle and introduces the prospect of boosting dye generation and Jsc. Due to the energy transfer and injection efficiency of the SOIC/N719 blend (∼3.52 ns) is higher than pristine N719 dye (∼1.76 ns) (Fig. 6b). The researchers identified two possible mechanisms for energy harvesting within solid-state DS-PECs: (1) a photo-excited donor moiety electron forwards directly to the TiO2 conduction band and (2) photo-excited donor moiety energy is transferred to the dye molecule via the FRET mechanism (Fig. 6c). The J–V characteristic of single-component SOIC-48-based solid-state DS-PECs exhibited PCE of 4.57% (Jsc = 10.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 700 mV, and FF = 0.63%). The same SOIC showed a PCE value of 5.31% (Jsc = 11.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 702 mV, and FF = 0.65%) in liquid-state DS-PEC. In the presence of additives with SOIC-48, an improved Jsc of 14.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 780 mV, and FF of 0.73% led to an increased PCE of 8.02% while the same SOIC showed PCE value of 6.5% (Jsc = 13.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 745 mV, and FF = 0.66%) in solid-state DS-PECs. In summary, the substitution of strong electron-donating moieties with SOIC can improve the electron transfer kinetics, light-absorbing ability, and overall performance of solid-state DS-PECs. Further in this report, high-performance single-component SOIC-48-based solid-state DS-PEC was performed under the dim light intensity (1.64 mW cm−2) of a working office space (Fig. 6d) and achieved 28% higher PCE than silicon−PV cells (PCE = 15.2%, Jsc = 34 mA cm−2, Voc = 613 mV, and FF = 0.73%). The obtained outstanding PCE upon dim light intensity is considerably higher than previously reported for low-light DS-PECs (e.g., Zhai et al.,93 reported PCE of 15.1% at 350 lux, Park et al.,94 reported PCE of 8.33% at 2.5 mW cm−2, Chen et al.,95 reported PCE of 17.2% at 600 lux, and Tsai et al.,96 reported PCE of 10.9% at 0.31 mW cm−2). Comparison of the SOIC-48-based solid-state DS-PEC with silicon−PV cells at various angles of dim incident light showed remarkable performance over the silicon−PV cell (Fig. 6e). Because the injected majority charge carrier was used by the solid-state DS-PEC, there are no minority conditions or energy losses associated; thus, the same are neglected.97,98

3.1.2.6 Non-aromatic SOICs. 
As discussed above, SOICs based on imidazolium, pyrazolium, benzothiazolium, pyrrolidium, and thiazolium are potential candidates for applications of solid-state DS-PECs. Typically, such SOICs exhibit lower ionic conductivity; hence, solid-state DS-PECs based on them are not favorable without any additives and could not perform efficiently. Nevertheless, the insertion of I2 and LiI into SOICs increases the ionic conductivity along with the efficiency of solid-state DS-PECs.24,28 SOICs containing additives (or multi-components) will increase uncertainty, which is not desirable for scale-up production. Additives are also needed for high-performance OIHPSCs based on organic hole transport materials (OHTMs). For instance, additives like LiN(CF3SO2)2, Li-TFSI, N(PhBr)3SbCl6, and Co complex (FK102, Co(III)-TFSI) were introduced in OHTMs to increase the conductivity and, hence, boost OIHPSC performance.99–101 The presence of multi-components introduces several drawbacks such as increasing the device cost and creating complexity, and unidentified side reactions may affect the stability of the photovoltaic device.
The design of highly conductive single-component SOIC is much required for high-performance, stable solid-state DS-PECs (Fig. 7). Therefore, Wang et al.,102 synthesized pendent propargyl-functionalized piperidinium and IM-based SOICs (SOIC-27 and SOIC-50) for solid-state DS-PECs application. This SOIC allocates the 1D lamellar packing of anions (iodide) and cations (piperidinium or IM) through the attraction of hydrogen (H) bonding and Coulomb forces.103 The ionic conductivity for piperidinium-based SOIC-50 (σ = 40 mS cm−1) was higher compared with the IM-based SOIC-27 (σ = 9 mS cm−1) because the piperidinium-based SOIC possesses better crystallinity along with smaller interlayer (7.6 Å) distance than IM-based SOIC (9.2 Å) (Fig. 8a). Moreover, SOIC-50 showed excellent catalytic property and iodide–triiodide redox reactions on the counter electrodes. The large cathodic and anodic peak currents indicate rapid charge transfer across the polyiodide chain originating through its lamellar structure with narrow interlayer distance (Fig. 8b). Solid-state DS-PECs assembled with single-component propargyl-functionalized piperidinium and IM-based SOICs delivered overall PCE of 6.3% (Jsc = 12.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 710 mV, and FF = 0.70%) and 2.0% (Jsc = 5.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 660 mV, and FF = 0.65%), respectively. The IPCE for piperidinium-based SOIC was also observed to exceed 65–70% in the range of 380–450 nm and reached 77% at 500 nm. The researchers stated that for long-range one-dimensional (1D) lamellar crystallites, the presence of iodine and substituent (propargyl group) is a key factor for developing high-performance SOICs with excellent ionic conductivity.

Furthermore, a non-aromatic cyclic piperidine iodide (SOIC-51)-based SOIC without any substituted functional groups for application in solid-state DS-PECs is synthesized.104 A substituted piperidinium SOIC was integrated to create a 1D lamellar phase with narrow interlayer distance and excellent ionic conductivity. The researchers examined the SOIC with a small amount of I2 to promote a self-constructed 1D lamellar structure through the involvement of Coloumb forces and H-bonding. Ionic conductivity of single-component SOICs was measured at 4.20 mS cm−2, which is higher than widely used conventional and IL-based electrolytes. Ionic conductivity can be further increased by varying the quantity of I2 (40 mM to 60 mM) inserted in the SOIC in order to achieve 10 mS cm−1 (50 mM I2). This improves conductivity by adjusting the molecular packing of SOIC in the presence of I2 (Fig. 8c). At the optimal concentration of 50 mM I2, SOIC displays high intense peaks, indicating development of a 1D lamellar structure in the SOIC with small size (9.5 Å) interlayer distance. Due to the 1D lamellar structure of the SOIC (50 mM I2), anisotropic ionic conductivity in parallel (σ‖) and perpendicular (σ⊥) orientation was 10.32 and 15.4 mS cm−1, respectively. Thus, the perpendicular 1D arrangement between two electrodes enables faster ion transport via Grotthuss bond exchange than the parallel 1D alignment (Fig. 8d). The photovoltaic performance of single-component SOIC with carbazole metal-free dye (SK1)-based solid-state DS-PEC showed a Jsc of 4.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 529 mV, and FF of 0.70%, leading to an overall PCE of 1.7%; although with the introduction of iodide into the SOIC, Jsc and PCE gradually increased when Voc (530 mV) remained constant. However, the single-component perpendicular 1D alignment of SOIC-based solid-state DS-PEC obtained a maximum PCE of 5.2% (Jsc = 13 mA cm−2, Voc = 538 mV, and FF = 0.66%) and demonstrated long-term stability (∼97% retention) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 for 600 h. Another non-aromatic SOIC based on pyrrolidium iodide (SOIC-53) was reported by M. Gratzel et al.105 This solid-state electrolyte was prepared by combining varying molar ratios of SOIC-53, iodide, and succinonitrile. The values of ionic conductivity, melting point, and diffusion coefficient are tabulated in Table 1. Photovoltaic parameters of solid-state DS-PEC constructed with SOIC-53 as the electrolyte showed an overall PCE of 6.7% (Jsc = 7.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 618 mV, and FF = 0.73%) with solar illumination of 51.9 mW cm−2.


3.1.3 Flexible biophotoelectrochemical cells (Bio-PECs). 
A growing field of interest is the use of photosynthetic pigment–protein complexes for sustainable technologies and non-renewable resources such as flexible Bio-PECs.106,107 In flexible bio-PEC systems, light absorbance and charge separation are carried out by light-sensitive biomolecules, such as the reaction center complex (iron or sulfur) of pigments, proteins containing chlorophylls, and other cofactors.108,109 Most of the protein complexes used to assemble protein solar cells contain reaction centers (RCs) or RC/light-harvesting antenna (RC-LH1) from the bacterium Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides.110 Numerous studies on the RC of Rba. sphaeroides have verified the potential application of this RC in flexible Bio-PECs.111,112 RC is the most effective light energy converter system available in nature, capable of giving 100% quantum efficiency.113,114 This RC contains two bacteriochlorophylls (BA and BB), two quinones (QA and QB), two bacteriopheophytins (HA and HB), and one Fe2+ atom, as demonstrated in Fig. 9a and b. The mechanism to distinguish charges within the RC upon light absorption involves the excitation of P to excited state (P*) and transfer of photoexcited electrons to bacteriochlorophyll (BA), bacteriopheophytin (HA), and ubiquinone (QA), and further to QB ubiquinone. At this stage, there are well-separated positive and negative charges (P+QB−). These steps occur repeatedly and QB receives electrons from QA. The 100% quantum yield of the primary charge separation in the protein transmembrane of RC presents a vast opportunity to utilize it in flexible Bio-PECs. Various applications of RCs have been explored based on this concept. Additionally, the possibility of harnessing this into electronic devices such as molecular electronics,115 flexible biosensors,116–118 photovoltaic devices,119,120 fuel cells,121 flexible photo sensors,122 and photo-transistors123 have been reported.

3.1.3.1 SOIC in flexible Bio-PECs. 
Reported work on converting photon energy to electricity by RC or RC-LH1 in flexible Bio-PECs has gained considerable attention with regard to performance enhancement, charge separation mechanism, photocurrent production, and interactions between electrode and protein. However, there has been very little research on redox electrolytes and their optimization, including TEMPO/TEMPO+, I−/I3−, Ferrocene (Fc)/Ferrocenium (Fc+), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), disulfide-thiolate (T2/T−), and so forth.106,119,124,125
The drawback of these Bio-PECs is the chance that the electrolyte may allow back charge recombination between the photo-oxidizing and reducing RC, which directly impacts device performance (i.e., photocurrent and photovoltage). Such redox electrolytes may also promote the movements of electrons from the cathode to the ground-state RC (P+). However, challenges remain in their efficiency and long-term stability. From a materials perspective, the design and synthesis of multifunctional SOICs can overcome those limitations.
Based on the above–mentioned, dicationic SOICs (SOIC-46 and SOIC-47) and photosynthetic protein have been combined as flexible Bio-PEC-type photodetectors that can sense ultra-low UV light intensity and convert sunlight into electricity.126 Compared with their individual use, the complex mixture of RC-LH1 and SOICs significantly improves the photocurrent due to different mechanisms of energy transfer. As shown in Fig. 9c, a photocurrent is produced when SOICs convert the absorbed UV light into visible light energy and the same is absorbed by wide-bandgap photosynthetic RC-LH1 protein (P+ to P*) by the FRET mechanism. Photons with energy larger than the RC-LH1 bandgap promote the electron from the ground state (P+) to excitation level (P*), leaving behind a hole (P+˙) (step (1): photon excitation). The photo-excitation electron (P*) transfer from BChls and carotenoids of the LH1 antenna, resulting in charge separation to reduce the QB ubiquinone. The hole migrates to the ground level of the RC-LH1 (P+˙) (step (2): charge separation and injection). Diffusion of an oxidized redox species through an electrolyte to the cathode and photoexcited electrons through RC-LH1 to the cathode, enabling transfer to both carriers via an external circuit. The P+ and donor moieties of SOICs are reduced by electrons from the external circuit at the FTO electrode and complete the circuit (step (3): electron recapture). The P+˙ generated in the RC-LH1 energy level value is higher than the redox potential of SOIC electrolyte. In addition, one more possibility is the SOICs donor moieties’ excited electrons self-transfer to substituted benzimidazolium iodide moieties. The FRET mechanism begins with SOICs (donor) molecules in the excited state transferring excitation energy to the RC-LH1 complex (acceptor) in a non-radiative fashion assisted by dipole–dipole interaction (step (4): energy transfer). The principle is based on the concept that an excited donor moiety of SOIC acts as an oscillating dipole and may engage in an energy exchange with a second dipole possessing a specific resonance frequency. In fact, if the SOIC molecules’ emission spectrum overlays with the absorption spectrum of the RC-LH1 molecule and both are within a short distance from each other, then the SOICs will transfer their excitation energy to the RC-LH1 directly.
In another energy transfer manner, SOIC donors’ fluorescence intensity is consumed when the protein molecules are excited, allowing them to capture the light in a broader wavelength region and obtain overall high absorption via the radiation-assisted energy transfer (RAET) mechanism (step (4′): energy transfer). Based on the above two energy transfer processes occurring concurrently, SOIC-based Bio-PECs exhibit five times higher photocurrent response than conventional protein-based Bio-PECs. However, SOIC-based flexible Bio-PEC-type photodetector is able to detect ultra-low (2 μW cm−2) UV light intensity and exhibits around two times higher sensitivity compared with the pure protein-based photodetector. As a proof-of-concept for real-life applications, researchers demonstrated a working model of a Bio-PEC-type UV detector with integrated LED display (Arduino) (Fig. 9d). Upon illumination by UV light, the Bio-PEC UV detector gives different signals depending on the UV light intensity. For instance, under high UV light intensity, the LED glows red with “H” sign, while under medium and low UV light it glows blue and green, respectively. After that, they constructed Bio-PECs on a flexible substrate for wearable device application and operated a small electronic gadget under UV light (Fig. 9e), making it a viable coating candidate for UV protection sunglasses (Fig. 9f). This strategy of introducing RC-LH1 into SOICs in dual-function electricity generation and sensor devices broadens the scope for the design of various SOICs for better performance and real-life applications.

3.1.4 Flexible OIHPSCs and OSCs. 
In third-generation solar cell history, there has been no solar cell like OIHPSCs, which in just a short period of seven years have achieved an impressive PCE of 25.2%.127 The performance obtained by OIHPSCs exceeds the PCEs of CdTe polycrystalline thin film (∼21.20%), CIGS (∼22.80%), thin film crystalline Si (∼21.20%), and multi-crystalline Si (∼22.30%) solar cells due to the outstanding electrical, chemical, and optical properties of perovskite materials.128 In recent years, this research perspective has gained significant traction and there are over 12000 scientific papers published and several commercial companies (e.g., Dyesol, Hunt Perovskite Technologies, Oxford PV, Microquanta Semiconductor, Frontier Energy Solutions, Saule Technologies, and so forth) that are setting up their own technologies for the commercialization of OIHPSC panels. The mechanical stability, low-cost material, and ability for R2R fabrication make OIHPSCs appropriate for building flexible solar cells.129,130 Scalable R2R deposition approaches have been successfully used in flexible OIHPSC fabrication; however, the recorded PCE is still as low as 5% (Jsc = 7.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 880 mV, and FF = 0.49%).131
3.1.4.1 SOICs in flexible OIHPSCs and OSCs. 
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, where X = I−, Cl−, or Br−) have enabled notable enhancements in PCE owing to their impressive optoelectronic properties such as long diffusion lengths, intensive photo-harvesting, low exciton binding energies, high charge transport mobility, and long lifetime.132–134 A crucial component of OIHPSCs is the organic hole transport material (OHTM), which should be optimized to achieve high PCE. Several types of OHTMs (spiro-OMeTAD), PEDOT:PSS (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)), PTAA (Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine), and P3HT (Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl))) have been investigated in order to achieve higher Voc and PCEs (25.2% reported in 2019).135–137 However, due to their organic character, OHTMs display comparatively lower hole mobility. To boost OIHPSC performance, they require the presence of organic or inorganic dopants such as Co(III) complex, tBP, CuSN, Li-based salts (Li-TFSI, NaTFSI, and AgTFSI), and Cu(II) pyridine. Utilizing the strategy of additives first used in solid-state DS-PECs38 allows OIHPSCs to achieve outstanding PCEs. Majority of the reported OHTMs contains a trace amount of supportive additives introduced to boost the overall PCE of OIHPSCs. However, the hygroscopic characteristics of additives (Li-TFSI) also facilitate the degradation (or amend the electrical properties) of perovskite and OHTMs materials.138 Overcome device instability, there have been many attempts to establish dopant-free OHTMs for OIHPSCs and exhibited over 18% PCE.139 Based on the above discussion, Cheng et al.,140 disclosed a series of dopant-free A(acceptor)–D(donor)–A(acceptor)-type SOICs (SOIC-55–SOIC-57) using pyridinium dication and bromide or bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (TFSI−) anions for applications of OSC and IOHPSC devices (Fig. 10). These highly conjugated pyridinium cation-based SOICs possess many beneficial properties such as enhanced light absorption ability, excellent ionic conductivity, reasonable energy levels, and better hole mobility. Besides, pyridinium cation with varying anions (Br− or TFSI−) of the SOICs showed major effects on conductivity, hole mobility, and device performance. Among them, pyridinium cation with TFSI− anion (SOIC-57) demonstrated the greatest ionic conductivity and hole mobility (0.324 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) compared with Br− (0.303 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) and pyridine (0.111 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1)-based SOICs. They showed a series of SOICs energy level (HOMO–LUMO) positions to be entirely compatible with the energy level diagram of OSC (ITO/ZnO/PC70BM/SOICs as donor materials/MoO3/Ag) and OIHPSC (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/SOICs/Au) devices (Fig. 11a and b). With regard to photovoltaic performance, OIHPSCs and OSCs fabricated using single-component SOIC-57 exhibited the highest PCE values of 17.4% (Jsc = 22.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 1095 mV, and FF = 0.70%) and 6.89% (Jsc = 12.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 805 mV, and FF = 0.67%), respectively, which is very comparable with conventional Spiro-OMeTAD (with additive) -based OIHPSC (PCE = 17.9%, Jsc = 24.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 1085 mV, and FF = 70%).

Further, it was reported that two ionic OHTMs using POZ substitution BIMI cation with different anions (I− and Br−) were synthesized through a microwave reactor (SOIC-58 and SOIC-59).141 These SOICs have been developed to replace dopant OHTMs owing to their excellent thermal stability (> 200 °C), hole mobility, and ionic conductivity. As-prepared SOIC provides long-range ordering with the short disorder (Fig. 11c and d); as a result, both SOICs possess excellent ionic conductivity, which is necessary for any photoelectrochemical energy devices. The corresponding photovoltaic performance of the single-component SOIC-58-based OIHPSC exhibits a higher PCE value of 15.0% (Jsc = 21.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 1040 mV, and FF = 0.66%) compared with SOIC-59 (Jsc = 20.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 920 mV, FF = 0.61%, and PCE = 12.0%) under the illumination of one sunlight intensity. The researchers observed photovoltaic performance improvement by adding Li-TFSI: J–V characteristics showed that SOIC-58 +Li-TFSI exhibit the overall PCE value of 18.1%, corresponding to Jsc = 23.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 1100 mV, and FF = 0.70%, which is better than the conventional Spiro-OMeTAD-based OHTM (Jsc = 22.5 mA cm−2 and PCE = 17.9%). In addition, the PCE of the SOIC-58 retained approx. 90% of its initial value after ageing of 1000 h (∼70% humidity), suggesting excellent long-term stability of the OIHPSC.

4. Flexible energy storage devices
Demand in flexible and wearable electronics has grown over the last few years. The development of these electronics urgently requires lightweight, able to be rolled, and flexible energy storage devices that have high power and energy density as well as excellent flexibility and stability in order to power different wearable electronics.142–144 Unfortunately, typical energy storage devices, including rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, may not be used directly for these applications due to significant limitations such as their high manufacturing and materials costs, and special procedures needed to prevent leakage of the highly corrosive and poisonous electrolyte. Thus, significant efforts have been made to develop different types of flexible and wearable supercapacitors and batteries. Flexible SCs have received considerable interest due to their remarkable benefits, such as their wide range of working temperatures, small size with shape conformability, excellent reliability, and mechanical properties, making them a suitable candidate for advanced flexible energy storage systems.143,145 They offer great potential for use as energy storage devices for portable and wearable electronics. As shown in Fig. 12a, flexible SC devices typically consist of flexible electrode films, solid-state hydrogel electrolytes, a thin porous membrane, flexible current collector and packaging material. When establishing high-performance flexible SCs, special attention should be given to the mechanical,146,147 electrochemical,148 and interfacial properties of the electrode and electrolyte material.149,150 In recent years, much progress has been achieved in assembling flexible SCs with different solid-state or quasi-solid-state electrolyte materials, including dry solid polymer electrolytes, gel polymer electrolytes, and inorganic electrolytes. In spite of this advancement, flexible SCs possess a few disadvantages, such as lower energy density, restricted mechanical stability, and low gel electrolyte conductivity, which are all significant issues to commercializing this flexible and wearable energy storage device for real-life applications.

4.1. Structural and operating mechanism of flexible SCs
Typically, flexible SCs store energy through two phenomena: pseudocapacitors and electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). EDLCs operate based on charge separation at the electrolyte–electrode interfaces and use a non-faradaic reaction to store energy (Fig. 12a). The EDLC surface electrode charging process involves surface dissociation and adsorption of ions from both the porous electrode matrix and electrolyte. For instance, as for the carbon-based materials, charges accumulate on the surface of the electrode and electrolyte-containing ions while equalizing charges are formed on the side of electrolyte to achieve zero net charge. Energy storage in EDLCs is highly dependent on the conductivity of electrodes for charge transport and surface porosity of specific areas, thus influencing ion adsorption. Therefore, a high surface area containing carbon materials, including CNT, rGO, and activated carbon, are commonly used as electrodes to achieve greater EDLCs. Even after long cycling durability, carbon-based materials suffer from poor energy density due to restricted specific capacitance. In pseudocapacitance, the charge storage phenomenon is entirely different from that in carbon materials that creates EDLC at the electrode–electrolyte interface. This operation involves a chemical (reversible) redox reaction at the metal oxides or conductive polymers that transfers electrons throughout the interface between electrolytes and electrodes, and stores charges through a faradaic reaction.
4.2 Parameters for the determination of flexible SC performance
For EDLCs, charge accumulates at the interface between the electrolyte and the carbon electrodes. The theoretical specific capacitance (C) in the flexible SC is estimated in eqn (1): C = Aε/4πd(1)where ε, d, and A denote the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, distance between conductive electrodes, and surface area of the electrode interface, respectively. In pseudocapacitance, charge accumulation across the electrode surface is by a reversible redox reaction between the metal oxide electrodes and electrolytes. The theoretical specific capacitance of a metal oxide electrode can be found by using eqn (2): C = nF/MV(2)where n, V, M, and F represent the number of electrons involved in the redox reactions, working voltage range, mass of electrode materials, and Faraday constant, respectively. An experimental method to calculate specific capacitance is from a galvanostatic charging–discharging plot and using eqn (3): C = IΔt/mΔV(3)where I, ΔV, and Δt denote discharge current (A), voltage range (V), and discharge time (s), respectively. The essential parameters for evaluating the performance of flexible SCs energy (E) and power (P) are represented, respectively, in eqn (4) and (5): (4) (5)where R is the series resistance of the capacitor. It should also be noted that E and P can be defined by volume (W cm−3, W h cm−3), mass (W kg−1, W h kg−1), and area (W cm−2, W h cm−2), resulting in volumetric, gravimetric, and areal E and P, respectively. Further, the frequency-dependent capacitance (C) is a combination of imaginary real capacitance (C′′ and C′) according to eqn (6) and (7). Real and imaginary specific capacitance are estimated by: (6) (7)where Z′ is the real part resistance, Z′′ is an imaginary part reactance, and |Z| represent the total impedance modules ().

Eqn (8) shows τ0 was derived from the frequency at maximum C′′: τ0 = 1/2 × π × f(8)
4.3 SOICs in flexible SCs
For many decades, liquid electrolytes such as aqueous, organic, and ionic liquid electrolytes have been used as energy storage elements (supercapacitors and batteries) due to their better interaction with porous electrodes. The use of organic and ionic liquid electrolytes could well work at higher potential range, but they are suffering from lower ionic conductivity. Although aqueous electrolytes exhibit excellent ionic conductivity and capacitance performance, they have a narrow working voltage range. The liquid electrolyte-based SC had the possibility of leakage, which could create a series of safety problems. In this scenario, solid-state polymer electrolytes offer promising opportunities to prevent leakage and overcome the safety risk. The reported solid electrolytes mostly exhibit lower performance due to their poor ionic conductivity and surface contact, and slow penetration into porous electrodes.15 In addition, during practical application, these solid-state electrolyte-based SCs suffered poor lifespan. Taking benefit from solid and liquid electrolytes, polymer gel electrolytes (PGEs) have attracted attention because they can act as both an electrolyte and separator.151
The reported PGEs contain several polymer materials have been used such as poly-(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(ethyl oxide) (PEO), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and many others.19,21 To improve the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of PGEs, various types of additives (inorganic salts) are incorporated into the gel electrolyte matrix; e.g., improving the performance of PVA/H2SO4-based hydrogels by introducing LiNO3,152 LiOH,153 CuCl2,154 LiCl,155etc. However, the lack of inorganic salts in pristine PGEs results in very low ionic conductivity. Moreover, multiple additives increase the cost of flexible SCs, generate complexity, and may affect long-term stability. The above issues can be avoided by replacing the low-conductive ILs and toxic inorganic salts with SOICs. Besides, the combination of SOIC with pluronic polymers may improve ionic conductivity, interface contact between electrodes and electrolyte, and electrode pore-filling, and lead to the development of efficient and stable flexible SCs. Pluronic polymers are promising candidates for hydrogels in a wide range of solid-state devices such as supercapacitors,156,157 zinc ion batteries,158 and DS-PECs.159,160 However, few of them have been examined for SOIC used in flexible energy storage devices. SOICs-induced thermo-responsive pluronic hydrogels are recently reported to have a wide operational temperature range in flexible SCs.161 Two SOICs, namely, piperidinium iodide (SOIC-51) and piperidinium bromide (SOIC-52), were added to the hydrogel to enhance the gel's electrochemical properties. SOIC-induced hydrogels have lower volatility and excellent mechanical durability, which reduces the device leakage issue.162,163 As-prepared SOIC hydrogel-based flexible SCs exhibit a specific capacitance (Csp) value of 483 F g−1 at 25 °C and a significantly high Csp of 339 F g−1 at −30 °C. The flexible SC also exhibits impressive results at high temperatures of 65 °C with Csp of up to 487 F g−1. The same temperature at a high Csp of around 70% was found in the flexible SC with SOIC-52. Moreover, researchers demonstrated a high Csp retention of over 95% and 93% after 10000 charge–discharge cycles (GCD) at 25 °C and −30 °C, respectively. The highest specific energy densities of 16.8 W h kg−1 and 11.77 W h kg−1 were obtained from the flexible SC at 25 °C and −30 °C, respectively. The flexible SCs with SOICs as the ionic conductors were found to perform better than those fabricated using conventional LiBF4− salt in the electrolyte. Apart from showing exceptional performance at low and high temperatures, the flexible SCs also exhibit a self-healing thermos-responsive property. The practical application of flexible SCs involves intense mechanical stresses such as bending, twisting, stretching, etc., that can cause cracks and delamination within the solid electrolyte and electrolyte/electrode interface of the flexible SC, respectively. When cracks and delamination occur within the SOIC-induced pluronic hydrogel-based flexible SC, a simple cooling treatment restores its performance (Fig. 12b).
Pumera et al.,164 developed MXene Ti3C2 nanosheets (NS) based on flexible SCs having 1,4-piperazinediium iodide (SOIC-54)-based hydrogels used as an electrolyte for self-powering flexible electronics.
To develop a smart and highly conductive polymeric hydrogel, SOIC with a different weight percent of a pluronic triblock copolymer (30 w/w%, 50 w/w%, and 70 w/w%) dissolved in aqueous solution was used. The different concentrations of pluronic polymer in water self-assemble in the various lyotropic microcrystalline phases and these reveal anisotropic conductivity.165,166 Among them, 30 w/w% SOIC hydrogel showed high conductivity (σ = 2.04 mS cm−1 at 293 K). This is because hydrogel contains 3D intrinsically linked nanochannels that allow faster ion transportation in the polymeric matrix.159,160 To investigate the benefit of SOIC induced hydrogel in FSC, they assembled Ti3C2 NS FSCs in three different configurations, namely sandwich, twisted fiber and interdigitated Ti3C2 NS FSCs. These configurations are typically used to improve the performance and long term stability of FSCs. On this basis, as a fabricated sandwich configuration of Ti3C2 NS-based flexible SCs with 30 w/w% SOIC hydrogel exhibited excellent electrochemical properties, high Csp (307 F g−1) and long life cycles (88.5% retention at 104 cycles). Besides, high capacitive nature of FSCs, flexibility and lightweight are also vital characteristics in the scale-up of FSCs for wearable and portable applications. Hence, they fabricated the interdigitated configuration of FSC, which offers many advantages over the conventional sandwich configuration of FSC. The most crucial advantage of this interdigital design is its small distance between electrodes, which leads to no need membrane (or separator) usually utilized in the conventional FSC. Notably, the interdigitated Ti3C2 NS FSC exhibited good Csp of 92 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1, indicating good rate capability. Because of the lateral ions transport in layered Ti3C2 NS side by side and a large number of accessible edges provided by the interdigitated Ti3C2 NS, it leads to high-performance rate.167,168 Further decreasing the space between the Ti3C2 NS electrodes, drop the resistance of ion transportation and try to enhance both power density and cycling stability at high current density.169–171
Further, evaluate the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2 NS FSC as a flexible energy source for smart and wearable electronics applications, they made twisted fabric Ti3C2 NS FSC on polyester cotton blend fabric substrate. The large number of reported fiber FSCs are mounted in twisted configuration so it can be effectively paired with other fiber shaped flexible electronic gadgets (i.e., sensors,172 and photovoltaic cells173) to accomplished low cost and multifunctional technology. As-fabricated twisted fiber Ti3C2 NS FSC displayed considerably high Csp of 224 F g−1 was achieved at a low current density of 0.8 A g−1, whereas Csp of 44 F g−1 showed at high current density (10 A g−1), which revealed good rate capability. Furthermore, the energy storage capacity of the assembled Ti3C2 NS FSC device using SOIC hydrogel looked to be superior to that of recently reported twisted fiber FSCs based on MXene Ti3C2Tx or metal oxide electrodes with polymeric hydrogels; i.e., graphite (25–40 F g−1),174 CNT fiber (20 F g−1),175 rGO/CNT yarn (31.5 F g−1),176 rGO fiber (40 F g−1),174 SWCNT/AC yarn (74.6 F g−1),177 Ppy/rGO fiber (72 F g−1),178 Ti3C2Tx flakes (362 mF cm−2),179 CF threads (17.8 F g−1),180 and Ti3C2Tx/CNTs (100 μW h cm−2).181 In addition to the electrode design and configurations, SOIC induced hydrogel also plays a pivotal role in obtaining outstanding stability and performance of FSCs. The most significant advantage of this hydrogel is self-assembly microcrystalline phase in the aqueous environment and enhance ionic conductivity and encouraging ion movement within the device.165,182 Hydrogel contains existing long polymeric chains can act as a micro-insulator to inhibit oxidation of titanium (Ti3C2 NS) as well as small discharge current flow. Great hydrophilicity of hydrogel increases the electrode wettability and electrolyte–electrode interface. Besides, SOIC hydrogel was found to perform better than conventional electrolytes, e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4). To study the correlation between ion size in hydrogel and pore size in porous electrodes is also one of the crucial factors in evaluating the performance of energy storage devices.183,184 Interestingly, Largeot et al.,183 reported a relationship between the pore size of carbon electrodes and ion size of ethyl-methylimidazolium-bis(trifluro-methane-sulfonyl)imide for double-layer capacitance. A substantial decrease in Csp was observed in pores that were smaller or larger than the ion size, indicating that the pore size must be adjusted when choosing a pair of electrodes and electrolyte ions. It was found that the SOIC hydrogel-based flexible SCs with the Ti3C2 NS electrode exhibit over threefold higher Csp compared with MAX phase Ti3C2 NS. This is because SOIC contains anions (4.4 Å) and cations (4.2 Å) whose sizes are closer to the pore size range of Ti3C2 NS (7.7 Å). However, as the size of the electrodes’ pores increased, the total distance between the surface of SOIC ions and the pore center also increased, thus reducing device performance.185 They further compared the performance of different configurations Ti3C2 NS FSC in terms of their bending stability, energy density and power density. To the consideration of practical use, small electronic gadgets have been demonstrated to powering through Ti3C2 NS FSC. Based above all on the studies indicate that in-plane interdigitated Ti3C2 NS FSC showed excellent performance upon multiple cycling, various angle of bending and high current density, whereas SOIC induced hydrogel helps to maintain electrode–electrolyte interfacial contact during strong mechanical bending.
5. Conclusions and outlook
This report reviewed the critical difficulties involved in the performance and stability of conventional electrolytes in flexible energy generation/storage devices and the development of innovative solutions, with an emphasis on alternative SOICs. We have discussed the latest literature reports on various kinds of SOICs and their use in different photo-electrochemical cells and supercapacitor devices as crucial components for high-performance cells irrespective of cell interior design. However, the published SOICs for flexible DS-PECs and OIHPSC have yet to be reported. With an emphasis on flexible energy generation and storage devices, we have highlighted the advances and progress made in the structural design and application of SOICs over the last few years. All solid-state photoelectrochemical devices based on novel single-component SOICs have higher overall PCEs than conventional electrolytes (Fig. 13a). Specifically, the highest PCE in solid-state DS-PEC and OIHPSC devices recorded over 8.0%, and 18.0% using novel SOICs with additives.

Different from conventional electrolytes in DS-PECs used to achieve high performance, multifunctionality, and stability, innovative concepts require the identification of SOIC molecular architecture and its work functions. The highly conjugated SOIC molecules display many beneficial properties, including tunable electrical and optical properties, and versatile facile processing. The potent intermolecular (heterocyclic molecules) interaction between backbones improved the near molecule–molecule interaction and enabled charge carrier transportation (electron/hole). Most significantly, SOICs devoid of additives (i.e., single-component) exhibited high charge mobility and conductivity. Despite the excellent durability of solid-state DS-PECs compared with liquid electrolyte devices, there are still problems with further enhancement of PCE, stability, and the scaled-up production on flexible substrates. There is room to boost the performance and durability of reported flexible DS-PECs and tackle unresolved problems concerning the electrolyte interface with a dye-sensitized photoanode and counter electrode. In addition, for solid-state DS-PECs, novel SOICs can be synthesized with a stable organic radical (e.g., 2-azaadamantan-N-oxyl (AZA), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO)) instead of an unstable iodide radical as a solid-state electrolyte due to the organic radical being a potential redox mediator with furnished dual channels for the charge (electron/hole) transport and enhanced DS-PECs performance (PCE = >9.0%)186 and stability. Removing iodide components in the SOIC's skeleton or solid-state DS-PECs would significantly increase device longevity and inhibit the effect of photo-corrosion on the counter electrode. However, considerable room for improvement remains in terms of efficiency, stability, customable flexible energy devices through the rational design of new SOICs. From this review, it is apparent that an important area of investigation is continued research and development of low-cost and effective SOICs as an alternative to commonly reported incumbent conventional electrolytes, such as doped spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA and P3HT, which are both less stable and expensive, properties required for broad use and commercialization. There is diverse sensitivity (i.e., ultraviolet light and moisture) and concentration dependency of additives in conventional electrolytes, which leads to reproducibility problems in the performance of PECs. In contrast, there are many reports of the use of donor–acceptor structures for the development of a single component (or dopant-free) SOICs. These SOICs, prepared by easy synthesis processes, provided efficient and low cost, in high-yield and high-purity, possess high ion/hole mobility and adequate energy levels and exhibited excellent durability.
Also, SOICs can be synthesized using different organic functional groups139,187 or combine with pluronic block copolymers,188 which enhancing optoelectronic properties, long term stability, reproducibility and environmental (light, moisture and thermal) stability. Where a commercial application is envisioned for PECs, single component SOICs can be deposited reproducibly and uniformly over large areas using an industrially scalable methodology. Further, fused heterocyclic compounds (e.g., phenothiazine, phenoxazine, carbazole, xanthene, etc.)-based SOICs can be functionalized with other redox moieties, providing tremendous potential for modifying their physical, chemical, and electrochemical characteristics. These have better electron-donating ability and electron-rich atoms in the hetero-anthracene core, suggesting a promising candidate for next-generation flexible devices such as light-emitting electrochemical cells, transistors, DS-PECs, batteries, and supercapacitors. Prolonged exposure to UV rays can cause permanent retinal damage. Apart from retinal damage, UV-B penetrates the epidermis and causes skin cancer. The UV light-absorbing SOICs (SOIC-46 and SOIC-47) can be suggested as a viable coating candidate for UV protection of cotton fabrics (Fig. 13b). The eco-friendly nature of the SOIC photodetector and the ability of the same to coat surfaces can be harnessed for commercial applications. SOIC-coated fabrics will be used to generate electricity that can charge devices like an emergency light.
On the other hand, very few SOIC materials have been reported for application in flexible energy storage devices and those reported are primarily concerned with aqueous PGEs. However, the aqueous electrolyte maximum working potential window is restricted up to 1.23 V; above that water hydrolysis exists. Of late, maximizing the operating potential window and ensuring device stability without the use of inorganic ionic salts (or organic solvents) are major challenges. In this case, dimensional non-aromatic SOICs can be used as solid-state electrolytes to establish novel organic halide redox devices. It can be possible to engineer and synthesize various ion sizes of SOICs that correspond to the pore size of electrode materials, which will have a significant impact on the attainable Csp. In recent years, specific organic molecules have received considerable interest as electrode materials for flexible energy storage devices; however, there are still major issues to be resolved before scaling-up production.189 There is scope to utilize hetero-anthracene-substituted SOIC materials with 2D materials (e.g., transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets, MXene titanium carbide, etc.) as flexible electrode materials to achieve a fast charge–discharge cycle, stability, energy storage capability, high power, and energy density. With the development of multifunctional novel solid-state organic electrolytes, we expect that SOIC-based materials will serve an even more significant role in flexible energy generation and storage applications in the near future. Besides, reported SOICs have shown that the systematic molecular design strategies allow to utilize of a single-materials for dual applications, i.e., DS-PECs and FSC. Therefore, reducing manufacturing cost for commercialization energy devices, we can integrate photoelectrical conversion and energy storage functions into one device using single SOIC, that allows for more efficient solar energy usage. Further possibilities for portable, wearable, and clinical advances can be created by integrating SOIC properties with both flexible energy generation devices (Fig. 13d–f). Apart from this, indoor solar cells are a great way to harness the energy emitted by indoor lighting in buildings, shopping malls, stations, airports, and so forth. However, the difference between indoor light source spectra and the ideal solar spectrum puts the concept into practical limitations. Therefore, it is important to develop low-light photoelectrochemical cells that can achieve excellent photo conversion efficiency even under low light intensity or with wide-scatter light conditions. Based on our research, SOICs are suitable materials for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics, advertising boards, window integrating semi-transparent solar cells (Fig. 13c). Finally, the development in SOICs should seek to achieve optimum designs to address the efficiency, expense, and environmental friendliness challenges, and provides a platform for future growth in the scale-up of next-generation flexible energy generation and storage technologies.
