    , Accepted 5th November 2015First published on 6th November 2015AbstractPerovskite solar cells with high power conversion efficiency usually employ mesoporous TiO2, however the role of the TiO2 layer has not been clearly resolved. Here we prepared MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite solar cells with an admixture of nanocrystalline TiO2 and Al2O3 to investigate the role of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The Al2O3 content was varied from 0% (pure TiO2) to 100% (pure Al2O3) with nominal composition of (1 − x)TiO2 + xAl2O3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1). The photocurrent density and fill factor decreased as Al2O3 content increased, whereas the open-circuit voltage was hardly changed. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was less quenched as the Al2O3 content increased due to its non-electron-injecting characteristics, where a decrease in PL intensity with increasing TiO2 content was correlated to an increase in photocurrent. Electron injection to TiO2 was also evidenced by time-resolved PL and time-limited photocurrent measurements, where interconnection of TiO2 particles played an important role in charge collection. The slight change in voltage with Al2O3 content was explained by balancing the Fermi position due to a trade-off between charge recombination and the Fermi level. The results observed from the admixture mesoporous layer comprising electron-injecting and electron-non-injecting oxides suggest that electron-injection characteristics play an important role in determining photovoltaic parameters.
Introduction
A surge of research on perovskite solar cells in recent years originates from a report on a long-term durable solid state perovskite solar cell with a basic junction configuration of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD.1 Although the liquid junction type with TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/(I−/I3−) configuration was reported prior to its solid-state version,2,3 it did not provoke much attention due to the instability of organo halide perovskites in polar liquid electrolytes. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solid-state perovskite solar cells has increased sharply from 9.7% in 20121 to 20.1% in 2015,4 corresponding to an annual growth rate of 3.5%. Organo lead halide perovskite works in various device architectures such as meso-superstructures containing mesoporous Al2O3 or ZrO2,5–7 mesoscopic structures containing mesoporous TiO2 and a capping perovskite layer,8–12 and planar structures,13 whose working principles however converge basically into the original junction configuration of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD reported in 2012.1 For instance, although photo-generated electrons in a perovskite cannot be injected into Al2O3 or ZrO214 in a meso-superstructured device, electrons are eventually injected into the thin TiO2 layer since the meso-superstructure contains a thin TiO2 layer on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive substrate. Thus, the basic junction configuration in terms of charge separation and collection is TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD. Both the mesoscopic and planar structures are expected to have also basically the same mechanism for charge separation and collection, where the mechanism is clearer in the planar structure because of the distinct configuration of TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD. Although perovskites are good for electron conduction and therefore planar structures have been widely adopted for perovskite solar cells, the electron diffusion length of perovskites was reported to be significantly dependent on the morphology from ∼100 nm for solution processed MAPbI3 to ∼175 μm for a single crystal of the same material.15–18 For a solution processed perovskite layer, a mesoscopic structure can help charge collection by overcoming the short diffusion length of perovskites. However, for the case of a mesoscopic structure, it has been argued whether electrons are injected into mesoporous TiO2 to be collected through it, although mesoporous TiO2 is assumed to be an extension of the thin TiO2 layer. We observed electron transport in TiO2 using rutile and anatase TiO2 films19 and nanohelical TiO2 layers.20 Recently, we also reported that photocurrent density decreased but photovoltage increased as the thickness of a surface coating of ZrO2 on mesoporous TiO2 increased,21 which is related to electron injection. However, little difference in electron transport rates between mesoscopic (nanostructured) and planar (thin film) devices was reported, arguing against injection into mesoporous TiO2 despite a common working mechanism for both structures.22 This indicates that electron injection is still under dispute in the case of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a mesoporous TiO2 layer. Thus, we are motivated to investigate the behavior of photo-generated electrons in perovskite occupying the mesoporous TiO2 layer by systemically changing the composition of the TiO2/Al2O3 nanoparticle admixture.
We report here the photovoltaic properties of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with the admixture of nanocrystalline TiO2 and Al2O3 to elucidate electron injection from perovskite to TiO2. Anatase TiO2 nanocrystals are mixed with γ-phase Al2O3 nanocrystals, where the Al2O3 content in the mixture of (1 − x)TiO2 + xAl2O3 is varied with x = 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%. At the same film thickness of the mesoporous oxide layers without altering the capping perovskite layer thickness, photovoltaic performance, photoluminescence and capacitance are compared. The studied system delivers important messages that electron injection occurs from perovskite to mesoporous TiO2, affecting the photocurrent density at short-circuit, but such mesoporous layers seem to be hardly involved in determining the photovoltage.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic structure of the perovskite solar cells studied in this work. Mesoporous oxide films with nanocrystalline TiO2, Al2O3 and their mixture are included along with a capping layer comprising only MAPbI3. The Al2O3 content with respect to TiO2 was 25%, 50% or 75%. For the mixed oxide layer, TiO2 and Al2O3 are assumed to be randomly mixed. In addition, the nanoparticles are expected to be interconnected because of heat treatment at 550 °C.

It is important to study and compare the photovoltaic properties of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with well-defined TiO2 and Al2O3. To avoid errors, we tried to prepared oxide layers with similar pore sizes in order to form porous perovskite layers in the mesoporous oxide layer. XRD confirms that TiO2 forms the anatase phase (Fig. 2a), whereas Al2O3 is indexed to be the γ-phase23 in Fig. 2b. Plane-view SEM images show that the mesoporous structure is distinctly developed for the TiO2 film (Fig. 2c), however, a porous structure is not clear for the Al2O3 film due to the amorphous morphology (Fig. 2d). Since a porous nature is important in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells, the pore size distribution was investigated using BET measurements. Except for the large pores exceeding 100 nm in the TiO2 film, similar pore size distributions along with an average pore size of about 50 nm are observed for both the TiO2 and Al2O3 films as can be seen in Fig. 2e and f. Thus perovskite is expected to occupy the pores of the mesoporous oxide layers.

In order to investigate the homogeneous mixing of TiO2 and Al2O3 and the mixing ratio, EDS elemental analysis was performed. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of aluminum, titanium and oxygen and the ratio between Al and Ti. EDS mapping images clearly show that each element is homogeneously distributed, which indicates that TiO2 and Al2O3 are homogeneously mixed. Moreover, the concentration of Al increases and that of Ti decreases as the mixing ratio of Al2O3 to TiO2 increases. The weight percent (wt%) of Al and Ti calculated from the EDS data, using wt% = atomic% × atomic weight, shows that the wt% values of Al/Ti are approximately 0.28 for 25% Al2O3, 0.67 for 50% Al2O3 and 2.48 for 75% Al2O3 (atomic weight of Al = 26.98 and Ti = 47.88), which are in good agreement with the nominal compositions (0.29 for 25% Al2O3, 0.88 for 50% Al2O3 and 2.65 for 75% Al2O3).

Cross-sectional SEM images of the full devices were investigated to determine the thickness and morphology of the mesoporous oxide layers and the perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD layers as well. As can be seen from the FIB-assisted SEM images in Fig. 4, the mesoporous layer thickness is estimated to be about 290 nm and the perovskite capping layer is about 390 nm. The mesoporous structure is well developed for the TiO2 layer without Al2O3. Although the porous nature and compactness change as the Al2O3 content increases, probably due to the different morphology of Al2O3, the mesoporous structure is still retained even in the 100% Al2O3 layer. The surface of the perovskite layer becomes rough upon increasing the Al2O3 content, which is also related to the morphology of Al2O3.

Since perovskite solar cells often exhibit I–V hysteresis due to differences in the I–V curves between reverse and forward scans,24 and I–V hysteresis significantly depends on the scan rate leading to over-estimation for a reverse scan and under-estimation for a forward scan, conditions diminishing I–V hysteresis are important to evaluate photovoltaic parameters precisely. In Fig. 5, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) measured at reverse scan and forward scan are plotted as a function of scan rate. As expected, large differences in PCE between reverse and forward scans at relatively fast scan rates can be observed for all the samples, where the PCE obtained at reverse scan is higher than that at forward scan due to over-estimation. As the scan rate decreases (voltage settling time increases), the difference is smaller and appears to converge to the same value at a voltage settling time of 1000 ms for 0% (TiO2) and 25% Al2O3. The difference in PCE is significantly reduced upon decreasing the scan rate for 50%, 75% and 100% Al2O3, but the scan-direction-dependent PCE hardly converges into one point even at 1500 ms. Photovoltaic parameters were determined at 1000 ms for the 0% and 25% samples and at 1500 ms for 50%, 75% and 100% ones. Increase in the voltage settling time to more than 1500 ms may lead to convergence of PCE for Al2O3 contents higher than 50%, but we selected the time of 1500 ms because of distortion of the I–V curve at higher settling times.

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves measured at reverse scan with voltage settling times of 1000 ms for 0% and 25%, and 1500 ms for 50%, 75% and 100% Al2O3, together with external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1, where the average short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are estimated from the reverse scan and forward scan data. In Fig. 6a, it is evident that Jsc decreases with increasing Al2O3 content but Voc is hardly changed. The shunt resistances are expected to decrease with increasing Al2O3 content judging from the gradual decline in curve shape, which eventually lowers FF. In Fig. 6b, the calculated Jsc from EQE data has the same tendency as the observed Jsc. It is noted that EQE at short wavelengths decreases gradually with increasing Al2O3 content, which is related to the mesoporous oxide layer. However, EQE at long wavelengths is hardly changed because of the same perovskite capping layer regardless of the composition of the mesoporous oxide layer. An average PCE of 15.23% is achieved from the 0% (100% TiO2) sample, which however decreases as the Al2O3 content increases mainly due to decreases in Jsc and FF as can be seen in Table 1. The average photovoltaic parameters are plotted in Fig. 7 in order to show distinctly the dependence of photovoltaic parameters on the compositional change. Jsc starts to decrease when 50% Al2O3 is mixed with TiO2, whereas FF decreases gradually with increasing Al2O3 content. The change in Jsc is likely to be related to electron injection at short-circuit condition because photo-generated electrons can be injected into TiO2 but not into Al2O3 due to the much higher conduction band minimum than the conduction band position of MAPbI3. Thus the decrease in Jsc with Al2O3 content indicates that electron injection into the oxide in the mesoporous layer facilitates electron collection. This also underlines that the mesoporous nature of the perovskite formed in the mesoporous oxide layer could perturb electron transport possibly due to the increased surface states of the mesoporous perovskite.

It is noted here that Voc is hardly affected by the composition, which indicates that Voc is determined regardless of the kind of oxide in the mesoporous layer in the mesoscopic structure. This implies that the major determinant of Voc is the Fermi energy of the perovskite at open-circuit conditions although electron injection occurs at short-circuit conditions.
To find evidence of electron injection, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) were investigated. Fig. 8a shows UV-Vis absorbance and PL spectra, where the emission peaks appear at around 750–800 nm in good agreement with the band gap of MAPbI3.25 Little difference in the absorbance spectra is observed, suggesting that the quality of perovskite layers is similar irrespective of the mesoporous layer composition. However, the PL intensity of the 100% (pure Al2O3) cell is much higher than that of the 0% (pure TiO2) cell, and the PL intensity is gradually decreased with increasing TiO2 content. Since PL quenching results from charge separation,26–28 the decrease in PL intensity in the glass/mesoporous oxide/MAPbI3 configuration is related to charge separation by electron injection into TiO2. Otherwise little difference in PL intensity should be observed regardless of compositional change. The PL results in our mixed oxide system support the direct observation of electron injection from the 2-step deposited MAPbI3 to TiO2 monitored by time-resolved techniques.29 It is noted here that the PL quenching has a correlation with Jsc change as can be seen in Fig. 8b, which suggests that electron injection is beneficial to charge collection. Time-resolved PL is shown in Fig. 8(c). The data are fitted to a biexponential decay equation in which the fast decay component (τ1 ≈ 0.4 ns) is assigned to PL quenching caused by surface state and/or electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 while the slow decay (τ2 ≈ 4 ns) component is associated with radiative recombination in bulk perovskite.15,16 The fit parameters are summarized in Table 2. Since the fast decay component in the glass/mesoporous Al2O3/MAPbI3 (ref) sample without a blocking TiO2 layer is not related to electron injection because of the absence of TiO2, the additional increment in the amplitude (A1) of the fast decay component in the glass/blocking TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3/MAPbI3 samples is due to electron injection from perovskite to TiO2. As the Al2O3 content increases, A1 decreases from 80.9% (0% Al2O3, 100% TiO2) to 79.1% (25% Al2O3) to 69.4% (50% Al2O3) to 72.1% (75% Al2O3) and to 68.7% (100% Al2O3). The injection fraction will be 15.3% (80.9% (100% TiO2) − 65.6% (ref)), of which 12.2% is related to mesoporous TiO2 since 3.1% (68.7% (100% Al2O3) − 65.6%) is related to injection to the blocking TiO2. This indicates that most of the electron injection occurs in mesoporous TiO2. The decrease in the injection fraction indicates that electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 decreases as the content of Al2O3 increases. It is noted that an abrupt decrease in injection is detected the samples with Al2O3 contents higher than 50%, which is indicative of little electron injection and/or fast recombination of the injected electrons with perovskite in the disconnected TiO2 (isolated) particles.

The time-limited current collection was monitored at 10 Hz. In Fig. 9, the 0% sample (pure TiO2) shows two different charge collection kinetics, where a faster component is followed by a slower one. For the case of the 0% (TiO2) sample, two possible pathways are expected because two different decay processes are observed in Fig. 9(a), whereas charges transport through perovskite in the 100% (Al2O3) sample since a single decay component is obvious in Fig. 9(e). Data in Fig. 9(a) and (e) are therefore fitted to a single exponential decay (see insets of Fig. 9(a) and (e)) to isolate the time constants for TiO2 and perovskite, where τ = 2.15 × 10−3 s for 0% (TiO2) and τ = 1.30 × 10−3 s for 100% (Al2O3) are determined. Therefore, the slower decay component with larger τ results from charge transport through TiO2, while the faster component with smaller τ is associated with electron transport through perovskite, which is correlated with the previous results.15,19 The slower component is thus expected to disappear with increasing Al2O3. No slower component is found from the 50% sample (50% TiO2 and 50% Al2O3), which indicates that TiO2 is hardly interconnected when the proportion is less than 50%.

To intuitively elucidate the reason why the slower component corresponding to electron transport through TiO2 is not detected from Al2O3 contents higher than 25% in Fig. 9, we establish a simple mathematical model of TiO2 and Al2O3 admixture networks. For the 3 × 5 arrangement with in total 15 spherical particles that are connected to their neighboring particles (Fig. 10a), we calculate the TiO2 interconnection probability. For the case of 25% Al2O3 content (about four Al2O3 and eleven TiO2 particles are distributed in the matrix), TiO2 particles are connected from MAPbI3 to FTO if no more than two Al2O3 are located in the row as can be seen in Fig. 10b. However, if there are two Al2O3 particles located in the row with another Al2O3 particle under the neighboring TiO2 particle, TiO2 cannot be interconnected from MAPbI3 to FTO as shown in Fig. 10c. In this case, electrons injected to TiO2 cannot be collected at FTO through the TiO2 network. Fig. 10d shows the TiO2 interconnection probability calculated based on the interconnection model, where the interconnection probability is higher than 80% for Al2O3 content less than 25%, however, it is sharply declined at 50% Al2O3 content. Thus, the basis for the absence of the slower component for Al2O3 contents higher than 50% is due to the disconnectivity of TiO2. It was reported that for mesoporous TiO2 based perovskite solar cells using one-step solution processing, charge transport and recombination are dominated by the TiO2 scaffold, similar to solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.30 However, when the pore filling of perovskite is increased, the portion of electron conduction through the perovskite layer is expected to increase as shown in our results. This indicates that understanding the perovskite/scaffold morphology and composition provides important insight into the charge transport process.

Since Voc seems to be independent of compositional change (Fig. 7), it is interesting to investigate the charge recombination behavior with respect to composition. Fig. 11 shows recombination resistance values obtained at voltages of 0.7 and 0.8 V, where the Nyquist plots measured by impedance spectroscopy were fitted using an equivalent circuit composed of a series resistance (Rs) and three R–C (resistance and capacitance in parallel) components in series. It was reported that the semicircle in the low frequency range in the Nyquist plot was related to charge recombination at the interface of perovskite/TiO2 and/or the bulk perovskite.22,31,32 Similar trends in recombination resistance (Rrec) are observed regardless of the applied bias voltage, but Rrec decreases with increasing Al2O3 content. Charges tend to be easily recombined as Rrec decreases. When considering no electron injection in Al2O3, Rrec correlates with recombination in the bulk perovskite as Al2O3 increases. Thus a decrease in Rrec with increasing Al2O3 content indicates that the recombination in bulk perovskite is prone to the recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. When TiO2 nanoparticles become disconnected to form isolated regions, these TiO2 particles can form a potential trap center. The trapped electrons possibly leave TiO2 to be collected through perovskite or have a chance to recombine with holes in perovskite. The underlying trapped electrons probably recombine with holes in perovskite when considering the energetics, which may lead to an increase in charge recombination as Al2O3 increases. Since the conduction band minimum of TiO2 is lower than that of MAPbI3, the increased number of injected electrons are expected to lower the Fermi energy level at equilibrium and thereby decrease Voc.19 Mesoporous TiO2 based perovskite solar cells were reported to show lower Voc than the mesoporous Al2O3 based ones.33,34Voc was also found to increase gradually by passivating the TiO2 surface with electron-non-injecting ZrO2 and increasing ZrO2 shell thickness21 However, almost no change in Voc is observed in the mixed TiO2 and Al2O3 system in this work, which indicates that the mixed mesoporous system works quite differently from the surface passivation system. By combining the impedance results with the fact that the Fermi position is likely to increase with increasing Al2O3 content, the small change in Voc with Al2O3 content can be explained by balancing the Fermi position due to a trade-off between charge recombination and Fermi level.
 Fig. 11  Recombination resistance (Rrec) depending on the Al2O3 content. Rrec was measured under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) at bias voltages (Vapp) of 0.7 and 0.8 V. 
Finally, frequency-dependent capacitance and time-dependent Jsc were measured to investigate the effect of Al2O3 in the TiO2 matrix on the capacitive current. The capacitance–frequency curve features shown in Fig. 12a are typical for the mesoporous perovskite solar cells.35 It is noted that the capacitance in the low frequency range, in relation to dipole polarization at the interface,35 increases gradually as Al2O3 content increases (inset of Fig. 12a), which increases the capacitive current and thereby the I–V hysteresis deteriorates. This is consistent with the I–V hysteresis shown in Fig. 7. The time-dependent Jsc results in Fig. 12b also supports the capacitance–frequency and I–V hysteresis results. Jsc is stabilized to a steady state after 20 s for the 0% sample (pure TiO2), whereas the time to reach constant Jsc increases with increasing Al2O3 and the Jsc for the 100% sample (pure Al2O3) hardly reaches a constant Jsc even after 100 s. The time-dependent Jsc results suggest that a longer voltage settling time is required to diminish I–V hysteresis in cases where a longer time is required to reach time-independent Jsc. In other words, electron injection by the presence of mesoporous TiO2 minimizes the capacitive current and assists in reaching a steady-state current as well.

Conclusions
We prepared mesoscopic perovskite solar cells employing a mesoporous oxide layer comprising an admixture of nanocrystalline TiO2 and Al2O3 with nominal composition of (1 − x)TiO2 + xAl2O3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1). We found that Jsc and FF decreased as Al2O3 content increased, while Voc was independent of the compositional change. Time-resolved PL and time-limited Jsc studies showed evidence of electron injection to TiO2, which had an influence on charge collection. It was found from the admixture layout that interconnection of mesoporous TiO2 particles played an important role in charge collection. The small change in Voc with Al2O3 content was ascribed to balancing the Fermi position due to a trade-off between charge recombination and Fermi level. From our specific design of the admixture mesoporous layer comprising electron-injecting and electron-non-injecting oxides, electron injection characteristics were found to play an important role in determining photovoltaic parameters.
Experimental
Synthesis of Al2O3 and TiO2 paste
15.756 mL of aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Aldrich, 97%) was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized (DI) water. A semi-transparent white precipitate was instantly formed, during stirring for 5 h. 8.56 ml of ammonium hydroxide solution was added dropwise and stirred for a further 6 h, which yielded a white precipitate. The solution was transferred to a high pressure vessel and autoclaved at 240 °C for 16 h. The water in the resultant Al2O3 colloidal solution was replaced with ethanol, to which terpineol (TP, 99.5%, Aldrich), ethyl cellulose (EC, 46 cp, Aldrich) and lauric acid (LA, 96%, Fluka) were added with the weight ratio of Al2O3:TP:EC:LA = 1.25:6:0.9:0.1. A viscous paste was obtained by evaporation of ethanol, which was treated using a three-roll mill for 20 min. TiO2 nanoparticles (diameter of ∼50 nm) were synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method as described elsewhere.10 The seed particles (diameter of ∼20 nm) were hydrothermally synthesized by acetic acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) at 230 °C for 12 h. The seed particles were washed with ethanol and collected by centrifugation. The same hydrothermal process was repeated with the solution including the seed particles to increase the size. TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing the TiO2 particles (∼50 nm) with TP, EC and LA with the weight ratio of TiO2:TP:EC:LA = 1.25:6:0.9:0.1. The paste was further treated with a three-roll mill for 40 min.
Synthesis of methylammonium iodide
CH3NH3I was synthesized by reacting with methyl amine (40 wt% in methanol, TCI) and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h, according to a method described elsewhere.3 The precipitate was recovered by evaporation of the solvent at 90 °C for 75 min, and was washed with diethyl ether three times for 30 min. CH3NH3I was recrystallized in ethanol and diethyl ether solution, and collected by drying at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven.
Solar cell fabrication
FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) with dimensions of 4.8 × 4.8 cm2 was treated in a UVO cleaner for 15 min, cleaned with a detergent solution, washed with acetone, and then finally cleaned in an ethanol bath under sonication for 25 min. To make the compact TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2), 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 2000 rpm for 40 s, then annealed at 125 °C for 5 min. The mesoporous oxide films were formed by spin-coating the diluted paste (0.16 g paste ml−1 ethanol) on the bl-TiO2 layer at a spinning rate of 2000 rpm for 20 s, followed by drying at 125 °C for 5 min and then annealing at 550 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace. The thicknesses of the annealed oxide films were determined to be around 300 ± 50 nm as measured by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bare TiO2 and Al2O3 films were prepared along with the admixture films. For the admixture films, the diluted TiO2 paste was mixed with the diluted Al2O3 paste in the weight ratio of 3:1 (25% Al2O3, 0.75 g TiO2 and 0.25 g Al2O3), 1:1 (50% Al2O3) and 1:3 (75% Al2O3), and sonicated using a micro Ti tip for 1 min.
MAPbI3 was fabricated from the Lewis base adduct PbI2 according to a method described elsewhere.12 PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar), CH3NH3I and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%, Aldrich) were mixed with a 1:1:1 molar ratio in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich), and spin-coated on the mesoporous oxide films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. In order to form a MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct film, diethyl ether was added dropwise after 10 s spinning. DMSO was eliminated by careful heat-treatment at 65 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 9 min. A solution of 72.3 mg 2,2′7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was prepared in 1 ml chlorobenzene including 28.8 μl 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and 17.5 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg in 1 ml acetonitrile (99.8%, Aldrich)). The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 film at 4000 rpm for 25 s. Finally, silver was thermally evaporated on the top of the spiro-MeOTAD at rate of 0.3 Å s−1 for about 1.5 h.
Material and device characterization
Photocurrent density and voltage were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 3A class AAA). A 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) was used as a light source. The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-2 filter. During the measurement the device was covered with a metal aperture mask (area = 0.125 cm2). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a EQE system (PV measurements), where a 75 W xenon lamp (USIO, Japan) was used as a light source for generating a monochromatic beam. Calibration was conducted using a silicon photodiode, which was calibrated using the NIST-calibrated photodiode G 425 as a standard. EQE data were collected at DC mode.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bruker AXS (D8 advance, Bruker Corporation) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at a scan rate of 4° min−1. UV-vis absorbance was measured using a UV spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, lamda35) in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 900 nm. Time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) was measured by a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, HAMAMATSU). The films were photo-excited with a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, HAMAMATSU) pulsed at a frequency of 10 MHz. The PL was detected by high sensitivity photon counting near IR detector. Morphology and elemental analyses were performed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL) combined with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and a focused ion beam assisted SEM (FIB-SEM, Zeiss Auriga). The pore volume and pore size of mesoporous films were measured by a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corp. ASAP 2020).
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were carried out with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 128N, Autolab, Eco-Chemie) under one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). To investigate the charge behavior near open-circuit voltage, a DC bias voltage ranging from 0.7 V to 0.8 V was applied with a potential step of 100 mV, where an AC 20 mV small perturbation signal overlapped with a frequency from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. An equilibration time of 10 s was applied after every step. The obtained Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit comprising a series resistance (Rs) and three series connected R–C (resistance and capacitance in parallel) components using Z-View software. Recombination resistance was obtained from the last arc shown in the low frequency range.
