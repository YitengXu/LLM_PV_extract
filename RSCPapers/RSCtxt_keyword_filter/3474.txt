    , Accepted 19th August 2014First published on 20th August 2014AbstractThree donor–acceptor alternating copolymers abbreviated as PC1, PC2, and PC3, respectively, were designed and synthesized using diindenocarbazole (DIC) and dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) units. Through backbone manipulation, copolymers with large bandgaps (∼2.0 eV) and deep-lying HOMO energy levels (below −5.41 eV) were obtained. The side chains were also investigated to tune the intermolecular interactions and morphology of the copolymers blended with PC71BM. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PC2:PC71BM exhibit an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.26%, which represents one of the highest PCEs ever reported for PSCs while combining an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V and a large optical bandgap of 2.01 eV. Under similar device fabrication conditions, regular PSCs based on PC1 and PC3 achieve PCEs of 2.45% and 6.68%, respectively. Moreover, inverted PSCs derived from PC2 also exhibit an attractive PCE of 6.17% with a high Voc of 0.92 V. In view of its similar optical profiles to P3HT, but a deeper-lying HOMO energy level, PC2 should be a promising candidate as a short wavelength absorbing material for tandem solar cells.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been under extensive investigation in the last decade.1 So far, PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) well over 9% for single-junction devices2 and as high as 10.6% for tandem modules3, have been achieved. To explore novel p-type conjugated polymer materials to further improve the PCE, the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach is one of the most successful and universal strategies, because it enables tunable absorption spectra and tailored frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting polymers. To efficiently capture photons from the solar irradiation to maximize the short-circuit current density (Jsc), many studies have been focused on the development of low-bandgap (LBG) conjugated copolymers. However, there is usually a trade-off between the Jsc and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a photovoltaic device.4 Another effective way to increase the total absorption of solar light is to adopt a tandem device architecture which stacks two or more subcells with complementary absorption spectra, i.e. active layer materials with different bandgaps. In this regard, it is desirable to develop new high-performance large bandgap copolymers with a high Voc to serve as potential candidates for the efficient tandem PSC application.5
Poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) is an excellent example of poly(N-alkyl-2,7-carbazole) derivatives,6 which possesses a deep-lying HOMO level to guarantee an attainable high Voc, high hole mobility for a large Jsc, and remarkable thermal stability. Since its inception in 2007, the PCE has progressed from 3.6% to 7.9% for classical PCDTBT-based BHJ PSCs.7 Although there is no doubt that carbazole-based derivatives deserve to be explored, the number of high-performance carbazole-based polymer donors for PSCs is still limited.8 Previously, we reported a carbazole-based ladder-type heteroheptacene (HHA),9 where the central carbazole core is connected with two outer thienyl rings through two embedded cyclopentadienyl rings (Scheme 1). Subsequently, Cheng et al. explored the photovoltaic characteristics when its analogue was copolymerized with various electron-deficient units, and a moderate PCE of 4.6% was demonstrated.10 Back to our original intention to design the carbazole-based heteroheptacene as a donor unit, considering its extended and rigid planarization that is favorable for intermolecular π–π stacking, we expect that based on some carbazole derived multi-fused polycyclic aromatic systems, a comparable photovoltaic performance relative to the best results of PCDTBT would be achieved through stepwise molecular engineering.
 Scheme 1  Molecular design strategy for high-performance diindenocarbazole-based copolymers. 
Herein, we adopt two benzene fragments to replace the outer thiophenes in our previously reported carbazole-cored heteroheptacene to form another ladder-type heptacyclic arene, namely diindenocarbazole (Scheme 1). As for the acceptor unit, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) is chosen. At the same time, two thiophenes are used to connect the donor and the acceptor similar to PCDTBT. In addition, different aliphatic side chains are introduced onto the donor–acceptor segments to tune the polymer's intrinsic solubility and miscibility with fullerene derivatives. As such, three carbazole-based copolymers, i.e. PC1, PC2, and PC3, were synthesized and tested for PSCs. These three copolymers possess larger bandgaps than P3HT, but show a significantly improved Voc of up to 0.99 V (0.60 V for P3HT:PC71BM) for the PSCs based on them. An optimal PCE of 7.26% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 14.22 mA cm−2, and an FF of 54.7% has been demonstrated in conventional single-junction devices based on PC2:PC71BM. To the best of our knowledge, this Voc value is the highest ever reported for carbazole-based single-junction PSCs while maintaining a PCE over 7%, promising its good potential as a large bandgap material for the tandem PSC application.

Synthesis

Compound 2a. 
To a precooled suspension (ca. 5 °C) of 2,7-dibromo-N-(ethyl)carbazole (4.85 g, 13.74 mmol) and AlCl3 (7.33 g, 4.0 equiv.) in dry CH2Cl2 (80 ml) was added dropwise heptanoyl chloride (6.10 g, 3.0 equiv.) over 25 min. After the addition was completed, the stirring mixture was warmed to reflux for 8 h. When cooling to room temperature, the reaction was quenched by slowly pouring the mixture into some crushed ice. The inorganic precipitate was dissolved in 2 M HCl, and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 ml). The combined organic fractions were washed with water, saturated aq. NaHCO3 and brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 5% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether as the eluent to afford the title compound as a pale yellow solid (4.3 g, 54%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.17 (s, 2H), 7.65 (s, 2H), 4.31 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 3.04 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 1.76 (quintet, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 1.46–1.33 (m, 15H), 0.89 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 203.60, 141.90, 133.18, 121.48, 121.29, 117.45, 114.30, 42.68, 38.24, 31.64, 28.95, 24.64, 22.51, 14.12, 13.79.

Compound 3a. 
In a 250 ml round-bottom flask, equipped with a stirrer and a condenser with a nitrogen inlet needle, compound 2a (4.3 g, 7.45 mmol), phenylboronic acid (2.8 g, 3 equiv.), and aq. Na2CO3 (6.3 g, 8.0 eq., 30 ml H2O) were dissolved in THF (65 ml). The solution was purged with nitrogen for 30 min, and then Pd(PPh3)4 was added. After being flushed with nitrogen for another 20 min, the reaction was carried out at reflux under N2 until completion (ca. 24 h) was indicated by TLC. The cooled mixture was diluted with water, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate for three times. The combined organic layer was dried with MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated via a rotary evaporator. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with EtOAc–petroleum ether (1/20) to get the title compound as a colorless oil (3.7 g, 87%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.36 (s, 2H), 7.45–7.42 (m, 10H), 7.37 (s, 2H), 4.41 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 2.38 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 1.48 (m, 8H), 1.10 (m, 8H), 0.83 (m, 9H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 207.02, 141.99, 141.83, 139.72, 133.49, 129.15, 128.58, 127.64, 121.76, 121.46, 110.36, 42.92, 38.06, 31.45, 28.76, 25.03, 22.42, 14.00, 13.91.

To a dry THF solution (30 ml) in a 100 ml Schlenk flask at −78 °C and under nitrogen protection was added slowly 24.5 ml of n-hexyllithium (1.6 M in n-hexane, 6.0 equiv.). After being kept at the same temperature for several minutes, a solution of compound 3a (3.7 g, 6.47 mmol) in THF (20 ml) was added dropwise into the mixture over 40 min under −60 °C. When the addition was completed and then the cooling continued for 10 min, the resulting mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight, followed by quenching with a saturated NH4Cl solution (15 ml). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated via a rotary evaporator to obtain the product of a crude diol as a viscous oil which could be used directly for the next step without chromatography purification.
To a solution of the crude diol obtained above in dichloromethane (80 ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere was added a BF3–etherate solution (5 ml) at an ambient temperature. A color change was observed somewhat upon the addition. After being stirred for 45 min, 100 ml of dry MeOH was added into the mixture to quench the reaction. The mixture was further stirred overnight, and concentrated to give a viscous oil which was loaded onto a silica gel column and eluted with n-hexane to yield compound 4a as a white solid (1.52 g, 33% for two steps). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.03 (s, 2H), 7.84 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.69 (s, 2H), 7.40–7.31 (m, 6H), 4.52 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 2.10 (m, 8H), 1.60 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H), 1.16–1.03 (m, 24H), 0.78–0.66 (m, 20H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 151.59, 142.05, 141.77, 140.57, 139.42, 126.78, 126.67, 122.98, 119.38, 114.00, 99.15, 54.40, 41.34, 37.81, 31.59, 29.89, 23.87, 22.66, 14.06, 14.01.

Lithium diisopropylamide (1.95 ml, 4.0 equiv. 2.0 M in heptanes) was added dropwise into the solution, upon which a purple color would develop. The resulting mixture was stirred at −78 °C for an hour, followed by the addition of trimethyltin chloride (0.70 g, dissolved in 3 ml of THF, 3.5 equiv.) at −78 °C. After the addition was completed, the liquid N2–acetone bath was removed and the reactant was recovered to room temperature with stirring overnight. When the reaction was quenched by slowly adding of water, the mixture was poured into plenty of water, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was recrystallized from methanol to afford the monomer as an orange crystal (0.55 g, 74%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.52 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 7.34 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 4.14 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.92 (m, 4H), 1.52 (m, 4H), 0.99 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 6H), 0.45 (s, 18H).

Polymer PC2. 
Into a 50 ml round-bottom flask were charged monomer DICBr-Et (0.22 g, 0.25 mmol), monomer RODTBT-Sn (0.21 g, 0.27 mmol), and dry toluene (15 ml). The solution was flushed with N2 for 30 min, then Pd2(dba)3 (10 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (25 mg) were added quickly. After bubbling the mixture with N2 for another 30 min, it was heated to 100 °C for 2 days. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was precipitated into methanol and filtered. The crude polymer was dissolved in chloroform, filtered through a short florisil column, concentrated and precipitated again. The recovered polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction sequentially with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform extract was concentrated and precipitated in methanol.

GPC (THF): Mn = 23.3 kDa, Mw = 44.8 kDa, PDI = 1.9.


Polymer PC1. 
Using a procedure similar to that described above for PC2, monomer DICBr-EH (0.7 g, 0.73 mmol) and monomer DTBT-Sn (0.49 g, 1.05 equiv.) were copolymerized in dry toluene (15 ml) for 3 days to yield PC1 as a purple black solid (0.45 g, 57%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.19–8.09 (m, 4H), 7.78 (br, 4H), 7.57–7.35 (m, 6H), 7.30–7.22 (m, 2H), 2.18 (br, 8H), 1.56 (br, 8H), 1.19 (br, 32H), 0.93–0.81 (m, 21H). GPC (THF): Mn = 13.8 kDa, Mw = 16.8 kDa, PDI = 1.2.


Polymer PC3. 
Following the same procedure as that used for the synthesis of PC2, PC3 was obtained as a deep red solid (0.18 g, 69%) through copolymerization between monomer DICBr-EH (0.20 g, 0.21 mmol) and monomer RODTBT-Sn (171 mg, 1.06 equiv.) in dry toluene (12 ml) for 60 h. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.62 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 2H), 8.08 (s, 2H), 7.88 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.82–7.77 (m, 4H), 7.69 (s, 2H), 7.60 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 4.30 (br, 6H), 2.20 (s, 8H), 2.12–2.05 (m, 5H), 1.71–1.62 (m, 5H), 1.56–1.49 (m, 4H), 1.39 (m, 2H), 1.17–1.06 (m, 32H), 0.97 (m, 4H), 0.85–0.77 (m, 21H). GPC (THF): Mn = 14.7 kDa, Mw = 23.1 kDa, PDI = 1.6.

Instruments and measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference, and the peaks are given in ppm relative to TMS. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured using the GPC method with polystyrene standards. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer. For the measurements of thin films, polymers were spin-coated onto precleaned glass slides from 5 mg ml−1 polymer solutions in chlorobenzene. AFM images were collected by a Veeco Multimode NS3A-02 Nanoscope III microscope. Blend films for AFM measurements were prepared on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates following the same procedure as described for the device fabrication.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, using a Pt disk coated with the polymer film, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in anhydrous acetonitrile) as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The polymers were deposited onto the working electrode from a 2 mg ml−1 chloroform solution and dried under ambient conditions prior to the measurements. The onset oxidation potential (E1/2 ox) of the ferrocene was −0.02 V vs. the Ag/Ag+ electrode under the same conditions. With an assumption that the redox potential of Fe/Fe+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV relative to vacuum, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the following equations, where Eox and Ered are the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.82) (eV)(1) ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.82) (eV)(2)
Hole mobility measurement
Hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au were fabricated to evaluate the hole mobilities of the resulting polymers using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. Unipolar devices were prepared by following the same procedure as described for PSC fabrication except that the PIFB/Al cathode was replaced by the gold electrode. The dark current was measured by an Agilent 4155C source measurement kit, and the J0.5–V curves were fitted according to the following equation: J = (9/8)εrε0μ (V2/L3)(3)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed to be 3), μ is the hole mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the average active layer thickness (92 nm for PC1, 106 nm for PC2, and 73 nm for PC3). V = Vappl − Vs − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vs is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes (0.3 V). The resistance of the device was measured using a blank configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Au and turned out to be 90.5 Ω.
PSCs fabrication and characterization
Devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al were fabricated as follows: indium–tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω per sq.) were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionated water, acetone and isopropanol for 30 min each, and then dried overnight in an oven, and subsequently subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 15 min prior to use. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVPAI-4083) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before being deposited onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The film-loaded substrate was baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the active layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer/PC71BM at different weight ratios (20 mg ml−1) in a mixed o-DCB:CB (1:4, v/v) solvent was stirred overnight at 50 °C and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before being spin-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800–1200 rpm for 60 s. In the case with additive, different volume fractions of DIO were added into the mixed solvent. Before the aluminum deposition, a conjugated polyelectrolyte PIFB was introduced as an interlayer to facilitate efficient electron injection. The PIFB layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s from a methanol solution (0.3 mg ml−1, containing 30 eq. of acetic acid). Finally, a layer of aluminum cathode was thermally deposited through a shadow mask under a high vacuum about 1 × 10−6 Torr. For the inverted devices, the ZnO precursor solution (0.23 M in 2-methoxyethanol) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate, which was pre-treated by UV-ozone for 15 min. The resulting film was then annealed.15 The fabrication of the active layer followed the same fashion as described above for the classical structure. Eventually, an anode interfacial layer of MoO3 (8 nm) and the Ag electrode (100 nm) were thermally deposited. Each sample consists of eight independent devices with an active area of 6 mm2. Device characterization was performed under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell. The current density–voltage curves were tested by a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. EQE spectra were measured on a Newport EQE measuring system.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes toward the monomers and polymers are depicted in Scheme 2. Starting from 2,7-dibromo-9-alkyl-9H-carbazole (1), 3,6-diketo-2,7-dibromo-9-alkyl-9H-carbazole (2) was prepared via Friedel–Crafts acylation with heptanoyl chloride. Compound 2 was coupled with phenylboronic acid by the Suzuki reaction to afford the intermediate 3 in 80% yield. Subsequently, a nucleophilic attack reaction at the keto site of compound 3 by n-hexyllithium produced a crude diol, which underwent cyclization with boron trifluoride–etherate to give the key heptacyclic arene (4) in 33% overall yield. Finally, selective bromination at the linear end positions by copper(II) bromide on an alumina matrix in carbon tetrachloride accomplished the monomer (DICBr-alkyl) synthesis. In parallel, lithiation of DTBT or its dibutoxy-substituted derivative (5) at low temperature followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride afforded the corresponding stannylated DTBT or its derivative. Three copolymers were prepared by the Stille coupling polycondensation between brominated carbazole-based heptacene (DICBr-Et and DICBr-EH) and corresponding stannylated DTBT or its derivative, using toluene as the solvent and Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalytic system. Two thiophenes were flanked on both sides of the BT unit to isolate the donors and acceptors for reducing if any the steric hindrance, which is beneficial to improve the planarity and π–π stacking of the polymer chains. All polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and hexane to remove oligomers and the residual catalyst. Polymers PC2 and PC3 exhibit excellent solubility in common solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. Polymer PC1 has relatively poor but sufficient solubility in these solvents at ambient temperature. As determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using monodispersed polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent, the number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of PC1, PC2, and PC3 are 13.8 kDa (PDI = 1.2), 23.3 kDa (PDI = 1.9), and 14.7 kDa (PDI = 1.6), respectively (Table 1). The comparatively low molecular weight observed for PC1 can be attributed to the fact that there are no alkyl chains on the BT unit. And large molecular weight portions of PC1 are not collected because they are barely soluble in chloroform. Therefore, PC1 has a low Mn of 13.8 K and a narrow PDI of 1.2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen suggests all polymers are favorably stable with the 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) values of 420, 340 and 338 °C for PC1, PC2 and PC3, respectively (Fig. S1†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three copolymers in chlorobenzene (CB) solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 1, and the relevant data are shown in Table 1. Both in solution and in the solid state, two main absorption bands are observed which is typical for D–A copolymers. The lower energy absorbance comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units, while the shorter wavelength band is attributed to π–π* transition of the heteroheptacene. Originating from the same donor skeleton of the carbazole-based heptacyclic arenes, all copolymers possess nearly identical spectroscopic profiles in the shorter wavelength regions. As for the longer wavelength bands, polymers PC2 and PC3 exhibit blue-shifted absorption maxima compared with PC1, which can be attributed to the weakened electron-withdrawing ability of the BT moiety induced by the introduction of two alkoxy groups. In solution, absorption peaks in long wavelength regions are located at 539 nm, 515 nm, and 517 nm for PC1, PC2, and PC3, respectively, which correspondingly red-shift to 549 nm, 520 nm, and 537 nm for the spectra in thin film. These bathochromic shifts in going from the solution to the solid state suggest a stronger interchain π–π stacking and a higher degree of ordered arrangement in thin film. It is worth noting that only a minimal red-shift occurs for the absorption maximum of PC2 in going from solution to thin film. It may be attributed to the fact that the polymer chains aggregate somewhat in solution for PC2 because the bulky alkyl substituents are only present on the one side of the backbone, imposing less barrier to the chains interacting compared to PC3 with bulkier chains on both sides.16 To verify this speculation, the same solution was heated to 80 °C, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), a blue-shift of 12 nm appears for the absorption maximum as compared to that measured at 20 °C, indicating partial disaggregation of the polymer chains at higher temperature. All three polymers exhibit strong absorption ability in the wavelength range from 375 nm to 600 nm, for example, with a maximum extinction coefficient of 6.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for PC2 and 7.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for PC3 at 418 nm in solution, which is beneficial to harvest more sunlight and thus may lead to enhanced Jsc in PSCs. In comparison with its thiophene-substituted backbone analogue, i.e., PCDCTDTBT-C8,10 PC1 exhibits noticeable blue-shifts of the absorption maxima (low energy absorption band) with 50 nm for thin film and 46 nm for solution, which is due to the weaker electron donating ability of the benzene unit compared to the thiophene ring, resulting in decreased electron delocalization along the PC1 backbone. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) deduced from onsets of the film spectra were determined to be 1.90 eV for PC1, 2.01 eV for PC2, and 1.97 eV for PC3, respectively. With similar or larger optical bandgaps relative to P3HT (Eoptg = 1.90 eV)17 which is the state-of-the-art large bandgap (short-wavelength absorbing) polymer for tandem PSCs, these polymers can be promising candidates as the front cell ingredient for multi-junction devices with high efficiencies and large open circuit voltages.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of these copolymers in thin film. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant results are summarized in Table 1. On the basis of onset oxidation potentials in the CV curves, the estimated HOMO levels are −5.41 eV, −5.43 eV, and −5.44 eV for PC1, PC2, and PC3, respectively. These HOMO levels are similar to those of the 2,7-carbazole-based analogues and are significantly deeper-lying than those of their thiophene-substituted backbone counterparts, which is helpful for achieving a high Voc in PSCs. As expected, through the donor structural modification, i.e., changing the more electron-donating thiophene moieties as shown in PHHA-BT into benzenes, lower-lying HOMO levels are acquired. It is common that the HOMO levels of D–A copolymers are mainly governed by the electron donors,18 and therefore similarly located HOMO energies are found in view of their same donor skeleton. Meanwhile, it is found that side chains can exert an influence on HOMO energy levels through the effect on molecular conformation/molecular interactions, i.e., more twisted polymer backbones have been shown to achieve lower-lying HOMO levels,19 so it is reasonable for a slightly descending HOMO levels from PC1 to PC3, accompanied by the strengthened backbone torsion with more or bulkier side chains attached. On the other hand, deduced from the onset reduction potentials of the film CV curves, the LUMO levels were calculated to be −3.67 eV, −3.56 eV, and −3.65 eV for PC1, PC2, and PC3, respectively. These LUMO values are located within a suitable range and are sufficiently higher (>0.3 eV) than the LUMO level of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, ca. −4.3 eV)20 to overcome exciton binding energy and thus guarantee efficient exciton splitting and electron transfer.

Photovoltaic performance and film morphology
The photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in conventional single-junction PSCs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al. All the active layers were spin-coated from a mixed solvent of ortho-dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene (o-DCB:CB = 1:4, v/v) with or without processing additives. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSCs measured under the AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination are plotted in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. Parameters including the blend ratio and the additive amount were screened toward device optimization (Table 3). Through systematic optimization, PSCs based on PC2:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) using 0.5% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive exhibit the best performance with a high Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 14.22 mA cm−2, an FF of 54.7%, and an intriguing PCE of 7.26%. From Table 3, one may find that the devices with the 1:3 blend ratio also exhibit a high averaged PCE of 6.95%. However, the devices with a 1:3 blend ratio have a slightly larger averaged Jsc value with a decreased FF. It can be explained when one considers the relatively better light-harvesting ability and lower carrier mobility of PC2 in comparison with those of PC71BM. To the best of our knowledge, this Voc is a record high value ever reported for carbazole-based single-junction PSCs with a PCE over 7%, and this PCE value is also among the highest of ladder-type or large bandgap donor materials for PSCs. In comparison with its thiophene-substituted backbone counterpart (Voc = 0.74 V)10 or PCDTBT (maximum Voc = 0.92 V),6 PC2 based devices exhibit a higher Voc benefiting from its deep-lying HOMO level. It is worth noting that a high Voc of 0.99 V (PCE = 6.02%) was obtained when no additive of DIO was applied (Table 3). Compared to the devices fabricated without DIO, the reduction of Voc in DIO processed devices may come from the lowering of the charge transfer states upon using the additive.21 It is well recognized that the molecular weight of a polymer has a large impact on the BHJ solar cell performance.22 Therefore, we also prepared a batch of PC2 with relatively low molecular weight (Mn = 17.0 kDa, PDI = 2.0), and the corresponding devices exhibit an optimal PCE of 6.54% with Voc = 0.95 V, Jsc = 12.04 mA cm−2, and FF = 57.2% (Fig. S3, ESI†). While these results demonstrate the importance of molecular weight consideration, they also suggest the possibility that even better performance based on PC2 could be obtained by a systematic optimization on the molecular weight. When the best device based on PC3:PC71BM was prepared under the same conditions, it also exhibits an impressive PCE of 6.68% with Voc = 0.93 V, Jsc = 11.45 mA cm−2, and FF = 62.7%. Whereas, the best cell based on PC1 only has a low PCE of 2.45% with Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 6.25 mA cm−2, and FF = 44.7%, using 0.5% (v/v) DIO as an additive. The inferior maximum performance of PC1 and PC3 as compared to that of PC2 may be ascribed to their lower hole mobilities (see Table 1) and the unfavorable morphology induced by their lower molecular weights (vide infra). As expected, all devices based on these three polymers exhibit high Voc values which is in accordance with their low-lying HOMO levels. Nevertheless, PC1 based devices afford the smallest Jsc and consequently the lowest PCE, which may be ascribed to its decreased solubility that would result in decreased miscibility upon blending with PC71BM, and accordingly deteriorated film quality which in turn unfavorably contributes to exciton dissociation and charge transport. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices prepared with DIO were measured and the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). All devices show a broad photon response range from 300 to 700 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the blend films (Fig. S5, ESI†). Obviously, the EQE values of PC2 based device are higher than those of PC1 or PC3 across the whole photon response range, and high values above 80% in the wavelength region from 360 to 570 nm have been demonstrated, which agrees with the higher Jsc observed for the PC2 based device. Besides, the Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G spectrum agree with those obtained from the J–V measurements.

We also investigated the photovoltaic properties of these three copolymers with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The J–V characteristics of the optimized inverted PSCs are depicted in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding performance data are listed in Table S1.† The best performance was obtained based on PC2 with a PCE of 6.17% and a Voc of 0.92 V. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves (Fig. S4b, ESI†) are consistent with respective values from the J–V measurements (within 3% error).
To disclose the relationship between optimized performance and microstructures, the surface morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blends were screened by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As can be seen in Fig. 4a, due to the poor solubility of PC1 and the resulting bad miscibility with PC71BM, the PC1:PC71BM film features discrete dark and bright regions with a root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 2.78 nm, which also corresponds to the inferior phase separation as indicated by the clear and large scale fibrils in the phase image (also see Fig. S6, ESI†). Under such conditions, photo-induced excitons cannot realize effective dissociation, and interfacial defects between the active layer and the buffer layer modified electrode may induce more traps. Therefore, the PC1 based device exhibits the smallest Jsc, FF and thus the lowest PCE among all the three polymers. In contrast, the PC2:PC71BM blend film with 0.5% DIO exhibits well-defined nanoscale phase separation with an RMS of 0.64 nm (Fig. 4b), indicating good demixing of the polymer and PC71BM. However, in the case of PC2:PC71BM processed without DIO, rather smooth (RMS = 0.23 nm) and uniform film with obscure domains (shown in Fig. 4d) accounts for the corresponding decreased Jsc compared with that of the film with DIO. As for the PC3:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 4c), the relatively rough surface (RMS = 1.13 nm) and large scale phase separation with randomly distributed polymers or PC71BM aggregates may be correlated to its suboptimal Jsc and PCE compared to PC2.

The scan size is 0.5 μm × 0.5 μm. All samples were prepared following the same procedure as the fabrication of the optimized PSCs. 
Conclusions
We have developed three D–A copolymers using DTBT derivatives as acceptor units and new carbazole-based heteroheptacenes, i.e., diindenocarbazoles, as donor units. Through polymer backbone manipulation and side chain tuning, eventually, a champion device based on PC2:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) with 0.5 vol% DIO exhibited an impressive PCE of 7.26% with a high Voc of 0.93 V. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest PCE ever reported for carbazole-based single-junction PSCs while maintaining a Voc of up to 0.93 V. In addition, inverted PSCs also showed a PCE of 6.17% with a large Voc of 0.92 V. In view of the better light harvesting ability in the short wavelength region with a deep-lying HOMO energy level, PC2 should be a promising candidate for use as a short wavelength absorbing material in tandem solar cells.
