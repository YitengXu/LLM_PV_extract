    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 16th September 2020AbstractRecently, halide perovskites have appeared as a superior class of materials for diverse applications, mainly in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. Perovskite halides are broadly classified as hybrid organic–inorganic and all-inorganic analogues depending on the chemical nature of the A cation in the ABX3-type structure. Immense progress has already been achieved in halide perovskites focusing mainly on the hybrid equivalents and all-inorganic three-dimensional (3D) structures, however all-inorganic two-dimensional (2D) layered halide perovskites are relatively new and their nanostructures have gained significant attention in the last few years. In this minireview, we presented a discussion on the recently developed all-inorganic 2D layered halide perovskites highlighting their crystal structure, synthetic methodologies, chemical transformations, and optical properties. We have demonstrated a significant number of examples of Pb-free 2D halide perovskite nanostructures. Strategies for the shape-controlled synthesis of nanostructures and their excitonic properties are discussed in detail. Thermal conductivity and thermoelectric properties are emphasized along with the magnetic properties of layered transition-metal based perovskites. We have also mentioned the recent examples of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites as photocatalysts for solar-driven CO2 reduction.

1. Introduction
In the last few years, significant research has been carried out in the field of metal halide perovskites, ABX3 (where A, B and X are the organic/inorganic monovalent cation, divalent metal cation and halide ions, respectively) predominantly with a three-dimensional (3D) structure.1,2 3D perovskites exhibit an astonishing range of properties, for instance high absorption coefficients, band gap tunability, a wide emissive range, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), long diffusion lengths, high charge-carrier mobilities and probable ferroelectric domains.1–13 In consideration of these versatile properties, a rapid advancement was accomplished toward the energy conversion applications, such as in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and light-emitting devices (LEDs).8,14,15 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs have been improved promptly from 3.8% to ∼25% and 1% to ∼21%, respectively, within a few years.2,16–27 Furthermore, halide perovskites have recently gained extensive attention in photocatalysis owing to their unique crystal structure, broad absorption range, and suitable charge-transport properties.28–30 Mention must be made that the structural distortion and stability of 3D hybrid and all-inorganic analogues are governed by the well-known Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the octahedral factor:  μ = rB/rXwhere rA, rB and rX are the radii of the A-site cation, B-site cation and halide ion, respectively. The stability of 3D perovskite structures is generally predicted by two parameters, t and μ, which lie in the range of 0.8 < t < 1 and 0.442 < μ < 0.895, respectively.1,2,31,32 Recently, Bartel et al. reported a new tolerance factor, which anticipated the stability of perovskites probably better compared to the extensively used Goldschmidt tolerance factor.33
Despite the versatile exploitation, the intrinsic instabilities of 3D perovskite halides during exposure to light, heat, and moisture together with the presence of toxic lead (Pb) limit their future progress in real-world commercialization and application.34,35 To address some of these concerns and also to create structural diversity, layered two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites were first reported as a novel class of materials with outstanding layer-dependent tunable optical properties, generation of stable excitons at room temperature, and large exciton binding energy originating from the quantum and dielectric confinement effects in conjunction with the improved environmental stability and photostability.36–40 2D layered structures are formed by the corner sharing of [BX6]4− metal halide octahedra, and the layers are isolated by the large organic cations.37,38 The 2D structure can be derived from their 3D structure by cutting through a definite crystallographic plane (e.g., 〈100〉, 〈110〉 or 〈111〉) which is discussed later in detail.39 2D perovskites also hold worthy prospects for solar cell and optoelectronic applications.39,41,42 Recently, a PCE value of 12.52% was accomplished in layered Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskite-based solar cells.36 While hybrid 2D perovskites have shown good progress,38,40all-inorganic layered 2D perovskites seem to be a fast growing field and recently it has gained tremendous momentum. In the case of traditional 3D perovskites, all-inorganic halides generally displayed better thermal stability, reduced moisture sensitivity, and minor defect concentration compared to hybrid perovskites. This resulted in intrinsically stable all-inorganic perovskites with favorable optical properties, including high PL intensity, tunable emission, narrower linewidths, high PLQY and a wide color gamut.43–45 Recently, Li et al. successfully fabricated an all-inorganic 2D–3D mixed dimensional perovskite-based solar cell, which demonstrated improved stability and PCE.46 Similarly, all-inorganic 2D layered halide perovskites were expected to show a more robust structure under extreme conditions and promising optoelectronic properties as a consequence of the removal of large organic interlayer spacers.47,48 Due to the presence of toxic Pb in perovskite materials, there is an increasing effort to synthesize new Pb-free perovskites by replacing the divalent Pb with tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi) etc.49–55 Interestingly, due to the higher trivalent oxidation state of Bi and Sb, a stable stoichiometry of A3B2X9 is formed with a predominant 2D form by the corrugated layers of corner-shared [BX6]3− octahedra.55 Thereby, we believe that 2D layered perovskite halides with different nanostructured morphologies possess tremendous structural diversity and exploratory new properties. While major review articles based on all-inorganic halide perovskites were mainly focused on the conventional 3D structures,43,56–61 there is significant scope to summarize the recent results and future prospects of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskite nanostructures.
Here, in this mini-review, we have presented the recent progress in the understanding of the crystal structure, advancement in their morphology controlled synthetic methods and structural transformations of different all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites. A detailed discussion on the optical properties in terms of the tunable band gaps, photoluminescence (PL), and structure–property relationship accompanied by the unique excitonic properties of 2D structures has been reported. Furthermore, we have discussed in brief the progress in the magnetic and thermoelectric properties of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites. The photocatalytic properties of these 2D halides with a particular emphasis on the CO2 reduction have been presented. Lastly, we have concluded the minireview along with the future direction toward the novel structures, exploratory properties, and applications of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites.
2. Crystal structures
A conventional 3D halide perovskite is represented as ABX3. The BX3 unit forms a corner sharing network of BX6 octahedra and A is located within the cuboctahedral cavity (AX12 polyhedron).62 The set of A, B or X atoms which may adopt the perovskite structures that depend upon the ionic radii of the corresponding ions satisfies the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor.33,63,64 2D perovskites can be considered as slicing of the 3D perovskite structure along a specific crystallographic direction.32,65 Typically the 〈100〉- and 〈111〉 slicings of 3D ABX3 perovskites are well-known members of the all-inorganic 2D halide perovskite family. Please note that the dimensionality discussed here is referred to the connectivity of corner sharing BX6 octahedra in the crystal structure. The reduction of dimensionality significantly influences the electronic structure and physical properties of metal halide perovskites (discussed later).
2.1. Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite halides
The 2D layered RP phase of perovskite halides is obtained by the ordered removal of the B cation along the 〈100〉-direction, which possesses a general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (Fig. 1a).32 The RP phase can be visualized as two AX type rock-salt type layers are sandwiched between n numbers of ABX3 perovskite layers along the c-axis and stabilized in such a manner that these layers are offset by one octahedral unit.66 The simplest member of this series is A2BX4 (RP phase, n = 1), which adopts the famous K2NiF4-type structure (space group I4/mmm).67

The RP phase is well known in the hybrid perovskite family, as there are diverse choices of A cation, while for all-inorganic perovskites, a few RP phases have been reported so far.36,38,47,68–70 Recently, mixed halide (B = Sn, Pb) RP phases have been synthesized.47,71 Li et al. synthesized a single crystal of Cs2SnI2Cl2 and Cs2PbI2Cl2 by the solid state method and their structures have been presented in Fig. 1a–c.47,71 A 2D layer is formed by the corner sharing [BI2Cl4]4− octahedra (B = Pb or Sn), where I− ions occupy the out of plane site and Cl− ions occupy in plane site serving as bridging ligands. Cs+ ions counterbalance the charges of the 2D layers. The size of A cation and other halide compositions failed to stabilize the RP structure, which explains the uniqueness of these compositions.47 Rb2CdI2Cl2 also adopts a similar 2D layered RP structure.72
Few transition metal based RP halides (n = 1 and 2) have been reported so far. The RP phases for n = 1 are A2MCl4 (A = Cs, Rb and M = Cd, Mn) and Rb3M2Cl7 for n = 2 (M = Cd and Mn) but an in-depth investigation is required to understand the properties of these materials.73–75 Yamaura's group reported a new double-layered mixed halide perovskite, Cs3Cu2Cl4Br3.76 The structure is formed by double layers of Cu2Cl4Br3 with distorted octahedra, CuCl4Br2 and the structure is similar to that of Sr3Ti2O7 (RP phase n = 2).
2.2. 〈111〉-oriented perovskite halides
The 〈111〉-oriented perovskite with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+3 is the richest subgroup of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites. The bilayer structures (n = 2) are stabilized by trivalent metal ions like Bi3+and Sb3+, where B-sites are occupied by the trivalent cation and vacancy at a ratio of 2:1 resulting in a A3B2X9 structure (A3B2[V]1X9; where V denotes vacancy). In these perovskites, the vacancies are ordered along the 〈111〉 direction, and as a result, the 2D bilayers of corner connected BX6 octahedra are formed, e.g. Cs3Sb2I9.77 Interestingly, A3Bi2I9 can adopt both 2D and 0D crystal structures depending upon the sizes of A cations, which are demonstrated in Fig. 1d.55,78–80 Rb3Bi2I9 adopts a 2D layered structure crystallized in the monoclinic phase (space group P21/n). Replacing Rb+ with the larger Cs+ at the A cation site tends to form a dimer, where BiI6 octahedra fused together to form a face sharing Bi2I93− dimer. These dimers are electronically isolated from each other, making them a 0D crystal structure of Cs3Bi2I9 (space group P63/mmc), Fig. 1d.81 Both the Cs3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9 form a 2D layered structure,82 and similarly, Cs3Bi2Br9, Rb3Sb2Br9, Cs3Sb2Br9, and Cs3Sb2Cl9 form a 2D layered structure.83–85 Recently, Seshadri and co-workers have expanded the 2D family with the composition, Cs3Bi2(Cl1−xIx)9, where for x = 0.09 to 0.52, the structure was described by the corner-shared BiX6 octahedra to form corrugated layers.86 A small incorporation of the I atom in Cs3Bi2Cl9 can alter the crystal structure from a 1D chain to a 2D layered form. Rb3Bi2Br9 also adopts a similar 2D layered crystal structure.83
The dimensionality of 0D Cs3Bi2I9 can be increased by halide mixing, which can modify the electronic structure and the physical properties. Mixing neighboring halides (Br–I, Br–Cl) alters the optical band gap with a similar structure as in the case of 2D Cs3Bi2I6Br3,87 whereas mixing halides with a larger variation of ionic radii (Cl–I) leads to a new 2D structure. Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 is the newest member of 〈111〉-oriented perovskites, which adopts the crystal structure similar to Cs3Bi2Br9, where I atoms situated at the apical position and the Cl atom at the bridging position.88 The presence of the Cl atom at the bridging position leads to the structural transformation from 0D Cs3Bi2I9 to 2D Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, as exemplified in Fig. 1e.
The vacancy site of A3B2X9 can be lowered to 25% by mixing bivalent cations, resulting in a 〈111〉-oriented triple-layered (n = 3) perovskite, A4[B2+(B3+)2]X12.89 Solis-Ibarra's group reported triple layered 〈111〉-oriented perovskites, which are also the first mixed metal halide layered perovskites.90 Cs4CuSb2Cl12 crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system (space group C2/m), where the layer is formed by the alternative corner sharing CuCl6 and SbCl6 octahedra, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The structure is a stretched version of Cs3Sb2Cl9, where CuCl6 octahedra are introduced between the layers of SbCl6.90 Both the octahedra are distorted significantly with a large discrepancy in the Cu–Cl axial and equatorial bond in CuCl6 octahedra, which are characterized by the Jahn–Teller distortion of Cu2+ ions. Similarly, Mn2+ and Cd2+ can also stabilized this triple layered 〈111〉-oriented perovskite.91,92 Recently, Solis-Ibarra's group discovered a series of new 〈111〉-oriented layered perovskites viz. Cs4CdSb2Cl12, Rb4MnSb2Cl12, Rb4CuSb2Cl12, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, and Cs4CdBi2Cl12 by combined theoretical and experimental methods.93

2.3. Perovskite-like 2D structures
APb2Br5 (A = Cs, Rb) is often defined in the category of 2D perovskite-like structures, which crystallized in the tetragonal phase (space group I4/mcm).89 The crystal structure is generally described as the layered structure connected by the [Pb2Br5]− polyhedra, which are separated by the layers of A+ ions, as shown in Fig. 2b. CsPb2Br5 is considered as a thermodynamically stable structure compared to its 3D counterpart. The structure formation can be expressed as:CsPbBr3 (3D) + PbBr2 → CsPb2Br5 (2D)
This formation can be described as breaking of corner sharing PbBr6 octahedra along the c-direction and formation of a PbBr8 capped-triangular prism layer along the ab-direction.94,95 CsBi3I10 is a well-known layered structure, which is similar to BiI3 but these layers are partially broken between the layers due to the presence of Cs+ similar to 0D Cs3Bi2I9.96–99 The crystal structure of CsBi3I10 classified as a quasi-2D layered structure. Recently Kovalenko's group reported a higher order mixed halide layered structure, Cs8Sn6Br13I7.100 It crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system (space group Cmcm), where the layer is formed by the corner (via Br atoms) and edge sharing (via I atoms) of distorted octahedra, [SnBr4I2]−5/3 and [SnBr3I3]−7/6, as displayed in Fig. 2c.100
3. Synthesis, morphology control and chemical transformation
In view of the quantum confinement effect and higher exciton binding energy of 2D all inorganic perovskite halides, substantial attempts have been dedicated toward synthesizing all-inorganic 2D perovskites in the last few years. In this section, we report the progress in the foremost synthetic approaches developed, which are closely related to those utilized for traditional 3D perovskites. Two well-known procedures are consistently implemented to prepare perovskite nanostructures, (a) the hot-injection and (b) the ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) or anti-solvent recrystallization approaches. These processes typically involve the dissolution of precursor salts at a specific stoichiometric ratio in a suitable solvent followed by induced crystallization. In the hot-injection method, the pre-heated cation precursor (e.g. Cs-oleate) is swiftly injected into the pre-dissolved precursor salts in an organic solvent (e.g. 1-octadecene, ODE) containing capping ligands [e.g. oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OAm) etc.] at elevated temperature.101 In contrast, the LARP or anti-solvent recrystallization method involves the dissolution of precursor salts in polar solvents [e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) etc.] and its subsequent injection into an immiscible or anti-solvent (e.g. toluene, hexane etc.) containing the ligands under vigorous stirring at room temperature.102 The schemes of two representative synthetic methods implemented for the preparation of perovskite nanostructures are displayed in Fig. 3a and b.

In 2017, Nag and co-workers103 reported the first colloidal synthesis of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9 by the hot-injection approach. The Cs3Sb2I9 nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by rapidly injecting the pre-heated (at 100 °C) Cs-oleate precursor solution into a reaction mixture containing Sb precursor salt, octanoic acid, OAm and ODE at two different temperatures (i.e., 180 °C and 230 °C). The final product was collected by quenching the reaction mixture in an ice bath followed by centrifugation. The morphology of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs was altered by changing the reaction temperature. At 180 °C, the orange-coloured nanoplatelet (NPL)-type morphology was formed with an average length of 27 ± 3 nm and a breadth of 14 ± 3 nm. In contrast, red-coloured nanorods (NRs) were achieved at 230 °C with the average length and diameter of 655 ± 20 nm and 46 ± 4 nm, respectively. The schematic depiction of the morphology tuning as a function of reaction temperature is presented in Fig. 4a. For the synthesis of Rb3Sb2I9 NCs, a similar procedure was implemented using Rb-oleate precursor solution, in which a nearly spherical-type morphology was attained with an average diameter of 7.5 ± 2 nm and 17 ± 3 nm at 180 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The representative TEM image is shown in Fig. 5a. Afterward, Nag and co-workers synthesized the colloidal NCs of A3Bi2I9 (A = Cs, Rb) by implementing the hot-injection scheme.79 The Cs-oleate or Rb-oleate precursor solution was injected into the Bi-precursor solution in ODE at 180 °C that also comprised OA and OAm. Finally, isopropanol was used as an anti-solvent to precipitate the desired NCs with the estimated yield of 60–70%. A quasi-spherical type of morphology was obtained with an average diameter of 5 ± 1 nm and 4.5 ± 1 nm for Cs3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 NCs, respectively. In the same year, Acharya and co-workers synthesized uniform Cs3Sb2Cl9 nanowires (NWs).104 In this reaction scheme, Cs-oleate was swiftly added in a solution of SbCl3 in ODE containing a mixture of capping ligands, OA and hexadecylammonium chloride (HDA·HCl) under a N2 atmosphere at 170 °C. The NWs were collected after addition of t-butanol in a reaction flask, followed by centrifugation, which had a length of 3.4 ± 0.6 μm and a diameter of ∼20 ± 6 nm. Interestingly, Cs3Sb2Cl9 NRs with an average length and diameter of 165 ± 12 and 20 ± 5 nm, respectively, were obtained under the same reaction conditions of NWs, apart from the use of OAm instead of hexadecylamine (HDA). The TEM images of Cs3Sb2Cl9 NWs and NRs are exemplified in Fig. 5b and c. In a different approach, Creutz et al. synthesized Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br) nanoplatelets through the hot-injection method integrating metal acetate salts and trimethylsilyl halides (TMSX).105 Typically, the desired nanocrystals were obtained by quick injection of neat TMSX (X = Br, Cl, or I) into a degassed hot solution of cesium acetate, bismuth(III) acetate, OA, and OAm in ODE, followed by prompt cooling along with controlled centrifugation and washing. A high ratio of [Bi]/[Cs] and a large excess of OA favored the formation of Cs3Bi2X9 hexagonal nanoplatelets (X = Cl, Br) with a diameter of ∼20–25 nm and a thickness of ∼3 nm. The representative TEM images are shown in Fig. 5d and e. Furthermore, Cs3Bi2I9 nanoplatelets with a similar size were synthesized through an anion-exchange reaction by adding an anion-exchange reagent (e.g., TMSI) into a dilute solution of Cs3Bi2Br9 in toluene in a N2 glove box at room temperature, which showed a color change from yellow to orange and finally to deep red. Likewise, a series of Bi or Sb-based perovskite (A3B2X9, where A = Cs, or Rb, B = Bi or Sb, and X = Cl, Br, or I) NCs were prepared by injecting TMSX in a metal acetate salt solution at 100 °C under a N2 atmosphere, which is presented schematically in Fig. 3a.106 The only modification in the synthesis method was the utilization of a low-cost and environmentally friendly solvent, 1-dodecanol, rather than the conventional ODE to dissolve the appropriate metal acetates in the presence of OA.

ODE = 1-octadecene, OnA = octanoic acid, OAm = oleylamine, and (b) CsPb2Br5 nanosheets (NSs) and nanowires (NWs). Morphology evolution was found to be dependent on (a) the reaction temperature, and (b) the ratio of R-SH/R-NH2 or R-SH/R-COOH. Alkyl-thiols = R–SH, alkyl-amines = R–NH2, alkyl-acids = R–COOH.

We have also synthesized the ultrathin few-layer nanoplates (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and NCs of layered Cs3Bi2I9via the hot-injection approach by changing the reaction temperature from 110 to 180 °C.107 The requisite quantity of pre-heated Cs-oleate solution in ODE was injected rapidly to the reaction mixture of BiI3, OA and OAm in ODE at three different temperatures, for example, at 110, 150, and 180 °C. The NS and NPL-type morphologies were achieved at 110 and 150 °C, respectively, while NCs were formed at 180 °C. The TEM image of Cs3Bi2I9 NPLs is presented in Fig. 5f. Recently, nanostructures of the newest member of 〈111〉-oriented mixed halide 2D perovskites Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 were synthesized via the traditional hot-injection approach by our group.108 Cs-oleate was injected into the reaction mixture at various temperatures, which comprised mixed BiI3 and BiCl3 in ODE along with OA and OAm. Small NCs with ∼20 nm size were formed at a lower reaction temperature (120 °C), while a higher temperature (180 °C) preferred the formation of 2D NSs with a lateral size of ∼5 μm. At the intermediate temperature of 160 °C, a mixture of NCs-NSs was formed. Fig. 6a and b demonstrate the morphology of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 NCs and NSs.

The synthesis of the 2D RP phase of Cs2PbI2Cl2 NCs was reported previously by Manna and co-workers using Cs-oleate and its subsequent injection in a solution of OA, OAm, and ODE containing PbCl2/PbI2 (1:1) at an elevated temperature of 165 °C, which is illustrated in Fig. 6c.109 We have also recently reported the colloidal synthesis of Cs2PbI2Cl2 in a modified approach.110 In this method, we have introduced benzoyl halides in preference to PbX2 as halide precursors. An equimolar mixture of benzoyl iodide and benzoyl chloride was promptly injected into the reaction mixture of cesium carbonate and lead acetate in ODE with a specific quantity of OA and OAm at 160 °C. It is important to mention here that the required amount of OA and OAm was 1 mL and 0.5 ml each for the synthesis of NCs and NPLs with an average size of 17.4 ± 0.5 nm and 500 nm, respectively. The NPLs of Cs2PbI2Cl2 are exemplified in Fig. 6d. On the other hand, Pradhan and co-workers111 used mixed oleylammonium halides (OLA-HX) as a halide source at an optimized reaction temperature of 180 °C for the synthesis of Cs2PbI2Cl2 NPLs.
The synthesis of bright green luminescent CsPb2Br5 NSs was reported by our group based on the solution-based chemical transformation from 3D CsPbBr3 NCs via the hot-injection approach,94 where the addition of Cs-oleate was performed at 200 °C into the reaction mixture of PbBr2, ODE, OA, and OAm. Here, the time for the termination of the reaction played an important role to obtain the pure phase of CsPb2Br5, which was employed at different time intervals, for example, immediately, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min by quenching the reaction mixture in an ice-water bath. It was evidenced that after 20 min, a pure phase of CsPb2Br5 NSs was formed with a thickness of 7–8 nm and lateral dimensions of 1–2 μm, whereas at initial time intervals (2–10 min) a mixed phase of CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 NCs was achieved. The transformed morphology from NCs of 3D CsPbBr3 to 2D CsPb2Br5 NSs acquired by TEM is shown in Fig. 5g and h. Balakrishnan and Kamat also reported ligand (i.e., dodecyl dimethylammonium bromide, DDAB) induced chemical transformation of 2D NSs of CsPb2Br5 from cubic CsPbBr3 NCs.112 The reaction scheme is directed through the formation of stable [Pb2Br5]− from the initial [PbBr3]− complex after the addition of DDAB in pre-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs, which is shown below;    
Zhang et al. synthesized brightly luminescent Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs at room temperature (RT) using a modified LARP approach.113 In a representative synthesis route, DMF or DMSO was utilized as a “good” solvent to dissolve CsBr, SbBr3 and OAm, forming a clear precursor solution. Subsequently, a fixed amount of precursor solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring into a solution of octane and OA, which is recognized as a “poor” solvent for the precursor ions. Fig. 3b shows the schematic illustration of the LARP technique employed for the synthesis of Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs along with the optical images of the as-synthesized solution with and without UV light irradiation. A highly supersaturated state was achieved instantaneously and prompted fast recrystallization. This method was successfully established to produce QDs with an average diameter of 3.07 ± 0.6 nm. In the same year, Yang et al. reported a facile method to synthesize Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs at RT.114 A fixed amount of CsX and BiX3 at a molar ratio of 3:2 was dissolved in DMSO and subsequently added dropwise to toluene (for Cs3Bi2I9) or isopropanol (for Cs3Bi2Br9) or acetone (for Cs3Bi2Cl9) under vigorous stirring. For the fabrication of OA-capped NCs, a certain amount of precursor solution was injected into the mixed solution of isopropanol and OA. A quasi-spherical shape with an average diameter of 6 nm was achieved for the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. Afterward, the synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs was accompanied by initially dissolving CsBr and BiBr3 in DMSO with the addition of OAm. Then, the controlled crystallization of QDs was successfully achieved by the dropwise addition of the precursor solution into the mixed solution of antisolvent, ethanol and OA. For comparison, toluene was also used as the antisolvent; however, the as-synthesized QDs in toluene were not stable under ambient conditions. An average diameter of 3.88 nm was measured for the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs.115
The anti-solvent recrystallization strategy was implemented by our group to synthesize micrometer-sized particles of Cs2PbI2Cl2, where a precursor solution of CsI and PbCl2 (2:1 molar ratio) in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (2:1, v/v) was injected into toluene under vigorous stirring.110 This facile ligand-mediated reprecipitation approach was also applied to control the morphology of nanocrystals. For instance, Ruan et al. reported the synthesis of the NSs and NWs of CsPb2Br5 by changing the ratios of the alkyl-thiol (R–SH) ligands to alkyl-amines (R–NH2) or to alkyl-acids (R–COOH), the scheme of which is presented in Fig. 4b.116 In a typical synthesis, precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsBr and PbBr2 in DMF. After that, a specific amount of R-SH and R-NH2 or R-SH and R-COOH was mixed into CsBr–DMF solution. The addition of PbBr2–DMF solution into toluene and subsequent addition of CsBr precursor solution produced the desired morphology. Octanethiol and oleylamine were added for the synthesis of NWs, while NSs were fabricated by the addition of 1-octanethiol and n-octylic acid in CsBr–DMF solution (Fig. 4b). In both cases, a strong green luminescence was witnessed instantaneously. Furthermore, large-scale synthesis of CsPb2Br5 NPLs was reported by Wang et al.117 A solution of PbBr2 and hexylammonium bromide (HABr) in DMF was injected in toluene followed by the drop-wise addition of CsBr in DMF under vigorous stirring for 2 h resulting in the formation of 2D NPLs with an average size of 10–100 nm and a thickness of ∼3 nm. Sargent and co-workers also implemented the antisolvent ligand-reprecipitation method to synthesize Rb3Sb2I9 NPLs, which are shown in Fig. 6e.118
Recently, solid-state mechanochemical synthesis has appeared as an innovative way for the synthesis of halide perovskites, and holds several advantages over solution-phase synthesis methods, such as intrinsically reduced toxicity by overcoming the use of organic solvents along with rapidity, reproducibility, and improved control over the stoichiometry of the final products.119 We have first executed the mechanochemical synthesis to prepare a scalable quantity of bulk powder of CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2Cl5 with 2D crystal structures.120 In order to design the synthetic protocol and select the starting precursors for the synthesis of 2D CsPb2X5, the retrosynthetic approach was used, where the stoichiometry of CsX and PbX2 in CsPb2X5 is 1:2.  
For a specific mechanochemical synthesis, the stoichiometry decides the actual molar ratio of the initial precursors, which were generally mixed and ground mechanically in a mortar and pestle in a N2-filled glove bag for 2 hours. The post-synthetic transformation of CsPbBr3 to CsPb2Br5 was also achieved by solid-state mechanochemical grinding with a required quantity of CsPbBr3 and PbBr2 and the scheme is shown below:120  
Later on, our group,107,110 Singhal et al.,121 and Ajjouri et al.122 executed this method to synthesize a series of 2D materials, for example Cs3Bi2I9, Cs2PbI2Cl2, Cs4CuSb2Cl12, and A3Bi2X9 (A = K+, Rb+, Cs+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−), respectively. Solis-Ibarra and co-workers also synthesized several 〈111〉-oriented layered double perovskites (Cs4CdSb2Cl12, Rb4MnSb2Cl12, Rb4CuSb2Cl12, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, Cs4CdBi2Cl12, and Cs4Mn1−xCuxSb2Cl12, x = 0–1) by precipitating from the solution of the corresponding metal halides and metal oxides in hot concentrated hydrohalic acid.91,93 Recently, Cai et al. reported the colloidal synthesis of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs for the first time by the hot-injection route with the average diameter of ∼12.5 nm, as illustrated in Fig. 6f.123
4. Optical properties
2D layered halide perovskites received enormous attention thanks to their fascinating optical properties, such as band tunability, emission line-width, bright color emission, PLQY, photostability, and excitonic features,40,124 which will be beneficial for future optoelectronic applications. Herein, we highlight the recent progress associated with the optical properties of all-inorganic 2D perovskite halides.
4.1. Pb(II), Sn(II) and Cd(II)-based 2D all-inorganic perovskites
Kanatzidis and co-workers first synthesized a 2D layered RP phase of all-inorganic Cs2PbI2Cl2.47 The bulk Cs2PbI2Cl2 revealed a sharp absorption edge at 3.04 eV with a small kink like feature, which is mainly ascribed to an excitonic absorption. From the temperature-dependent PL study, a broad PL emission appeared with decreasing temperature and was associated with the self-trapped excited state. Afterward, Manna and co-workers synthesized the NCs of Cs2PbI2Cl2, which exhibited a narrow excitonic absorption around 400 nm (∼3.1 eV).109 A considerably broad PL was evidenced for the as-synthesized NCs with a weak PL quantum yield. At the same time, Kanatzidis and co-workers focused their attention to the development of Pb-free all-inorganic perovskites with low-dimensional structures.71 The 2D RP phase of Cs2SnCl2I2 was also synthesized, which showed a direct band gap of 2.62 eV. Additionally, a series of Cs4−xRbxSn3Cl8I2 solid solutions (where x = 0 → 2) displayed similar band gap behaviours, signifying an unperturbed impact of cation mixing (Cs/Rb) on the band gaps.71 An emission near the band edge of Cs2SnCl2I2 was identified at around 510 nm. Recently, Kovalenko and co-workers synthesized a new Pb-free material Cs8Sn6Br13I7 in the form of orange needles, which showed an optical band edge of 2.23 eV.100
Recently, a layer-dependent band gap of all-inorganic RP phases (for example, Cs2PbI2Cl2, Cs2SnCl2I2, and Cs2PbI4) was calculated theoretically.48,125 With increasing the number of layers, the estimated band gaps were reduced. These 2D RP phases displayed strong anisotropic absorption features. Moreover, the theoretically estimated exciton-binding energy of the monolayer of 2D Cs2PbI4 was found to be larger (181.70 meV) than that of conventional 3D CsPbI3 (59.12 meV). Later on, it was verified that the RP phase of Cs2PbX4 was unstable and challenging to attain the pure phase during solid-state synthesis.47 Recently, we have synthesized the 2D nanoplates (NPs) and small NCs of Cs2PbI2Cl2 along with the scalable quantity of bulk powders.110 The excitonic absorption peak and PL emission were appeared at ∼415 nm and 425 nm, respectively, for NPLs, and NCs. Furthermore, the bulk Cs2PbI2Cl2 showed a sharp adsorption edge with an excitonic peak at around 410 nm and a broad PL band at 459 nm. A broadened and red-shifted PL emission along with a longer excitonic lifetime was evidenced at 77 K compared to the room-temperature PL for Cs2PbI2Cl2 NCs.
The UV-Vis spectrum of the single crystals of layered CsPb2Br5 exhibited only one absorption edge at 370 nm with an estimated band gap of 3.35 eV.126 The colloidal suspension of 2D CsPb2Br5 nanoplatelets exhibited a sharp excitonic peak in the absorption spectrum, which displayed green light emission under irradiation of 365 nm UV light. The nanoplatelet solution of CsPb2Br5 was characterized by a symmetric PL emission peak at 512 nm with a narrow linewidth of 12 nm and the absolute PL quantum yield (PLQY) of ∼87% in toluene solution.117 The PL emission of the as-synthesized nanoplatelets with halide mixing (i.e., CsPb2Br5−xClx or CsPb2Br5−xIx) exhibited a narrow and bright emission color from blue to red and successfully covered the entire visible spectral region, as shown in Fig. 7a. Furthermore, Fig. 7b reveals the color alteration of colloidal suspension from yellow → light green → green-white and yellow → orange → red with the gradual halide exchange from Br-to-Cl and Br-to-I, respectively in CsPb2Br5. A range of 20–90% of PLQY was obtained for the halide-exchanged nanoplatelet solutions.117 Subsequently, Tang et al. synthesized CsPb2Br5 microplates with a narrow PL linewidth of 20 nm, where the emission peak centered at ∼528 nm.127 Later on, the optical properties of NWs and NSs of CsPb2Br5 were reported by Ruan et al.116 The absorption peaks of NWs and NSs were found at ∼512 and 515 nm with the PL emission peaks centered at 525 and 529 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the PLQY of NWs (∼9.9%) was found to be higher than that of the NSs (∼1.0%) at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. The scalable quantity of CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2Cl5 bulk powders was also synthesized by our group,120 which showed an optical band edge at 537 nm (2.30 eV) and 418 nm (2.97 eV), respectively. Solid-state PL spectra of CsPb2Br5 showed band edge emission at 540 nm with a low energy peak at 590 nm, whereas a band edge emission at 446 nm was evidenced for CsPb2Cl5 associated with a low intense additional lower energy peak at ∼500 nm.120 Recently, we offered a critical understanding into the optical properties of 2D CsPb2Br5 NSs by detailed experimental and theoretical investigations.94 Our study mainly highlighted the origin of luminescence properties of CsPb2Br5. CsPb2Br5 NSs possess an indirect band gap (calculated value of 3.06 eV). The formation of amorphous ammonium complexes of [PbBr4]2− and [Pb2Br5]− on the surface of CsPb2Br5 was found to be responsible for the intense PL emission at ∼531 nm of NSs, when excited at 410 nm. These complexes were identified by the optical spectroscopic techniques.94 Similar APb2Br5-type of materials (where, A = Rb and K) were also characterized earlier by Tarasova et al.128 The band gaps of RbPb2Br5 single crystals were found to be ∼3.42 and 3.61 eV at 300 K and 80 K, respectively, whereas for KPb2Br5, the values were ∼3.46 and 3.60 eV at 300 K and 80 K, respectively.

A new all-inorganic 2D RP phase with the chemical composition of Rb2CdCl2I2 was synthesized in the form of single crystals by Li et al.72 The as-synthesized material displayed an absorption edge at 351 nm with the estimated band gap of 3.53 eV. The solid-state PL spectra at room temperature revealed a broadband PL emission spanning the whole visible spectral region with a peak maximum at 585 nm, which became narrower and stronger with the decrease in temperature. The self-trapped excited state was found to be responsible for broad PL, which appeared from the lattice deformation of [CdCl4I2]2− octahedra. Both Cl and I atoms contributed significantly to the electronic band structures of Rb2CdCl2I2 as revealed from the first principles calculations. Likewise, Wu et al. noted an absorption edge centered at ∼306 nm for Rb2CdBr2I2 with a calculated band gap of 3.35 eV.129 Interestingly, Rb2CdBr2I2 crystallizes into the orthorhombic crystal system with the non-centrosymmetric space group of Ama2, in which Cd2+ forms a distorted tetrahedron, [CdBr2I2]2−.129
4.2. Bi-based 2D all-inorganic perovskites
Bi(III) and Sb(III) were implemented as a replacement of Pb in 3D halide perovskites, which formed low-dimensional A3B2X9-type of stoichiometry owing to their higher oxidation state. These materials with reduced dimensions exhibited intriguing optical properties. In 2015, Seshadri and co-workers explored the optical band gaps of several Bi-based halides, A3Bi2I9 (A = K, Rb, Cs).80 The experimental band edges were found at ∼2 eV for all three materials. The steepness of the absorption edge was greater for the layered structures (A3Bi2I9, A = K, Rb) than that of the Cs3Bi2I9 structure having isolated anions. The calculated band structures also revealed the direct band gap for the layered Rb and K-based ternary bismuth iodides, whereas Cs3Bi2I9 showed an indirect band gap. However, a previous report established a relationship between the estimated band gap of several A3B2X9 materials (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Bi, Sb; X = Br, I) and their melting point (Tm) and average atomic number (Zav).130 Recently, Creutz et al. reported the layered and dimer modifications of Cs3Bi2I9, in which the dimer modification has a lower extinction coefficient compared to the layered form in the visible range.105 The absorption peak appeared at 550 nm with a sharp band edge in layered Cs3Bi2I9, while it was blue-shifted to 492 nm in the case of the dimer modification with a broad inclined tail. The band dispersion and bonding character of these materials were discussed using the DFT calculations, which exhibited a predominant contribution of halide np and Bi 6s orbitals to the valence-band maxima, and the conduction-band minima originated from the Bi 6p orbitals. The theoretical calculations predicted a considerably smaller bandgap of layered polymorph (∼1.9 eV) compared to its dimer analogue (∼2.3 eV), which corroborated well with the experimental observations. Although no PL emission from Cs3Bi2I9 was detected at room temperature, at cryogenic temperature of 5 K, the emission was successfully perceived, in which the two structural polymorphs showed markedly diverse emission spectra. The layered polymorph displayed a reasonably sharp emission peak at 605 nm (∼2.05 eV) with a linewidth of ∼85 meV. Conversely, a broad PL emission centered at 643 nm (∼1.93 eV) with a linewidth of ∼200 meV was detected for the dimer polymorph.105
Interestingly, for the 0D dimer structure of colloidal Cs3Bi2I9 NCs, a dual emission peak at 2.66 and 2.28 eV was evidenced, which originated from the de-excitation through the electronic band gap and from the excitonic emission, respectively.79 In contrast, the as-synthesized colloidal NCs of Rb3Bi2I9 with a 2D layered structure did not display any quantifiable PL at room temperature due to the presence of the deep defect states in the band gap region. We have synthesized 2D ultrathin few-layer NPLs, NSs, and NCs of layered Cs3Bi2I9, which showed shape-controlled solid-state and solution phase optical properties.107 The NPLs displayed an optical absorption edge at 611 nm (2.03 eV), whereas the absorption edge for NSs and NCs appeared at 622 nm (1.99 eV) and 634 nm (1.96 eV), respectively, in the solid state. Furthermore, the solid-state PL studies exhibited a broad emission peak for NPLs, NSs and NCs. Each broad PL band was contributed by two distinctive bands, for example the PL bands at 623 nm (1.99 eV) and 645 nm (1.93 eV) for NPLs. However, the blue-shifted and narrower PL bands appeared for all samples in the solution phase due to the presence of a small number of defect states. The emission peaks for NPLs, NSs, and NCs were centered at 544 nm, 535 nm, and 520 nm, respectively.107 Liang et al. reported a material with the composition of CsBi3I10, which possessed a layered crystal structure.97 A high absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 in visible light and an appropriate direct optical bandgap of 1.78 eV were obtained for CsBi3I10 thin films, which have the potential as a light absorber in solar cells.
The polycrystalline powder of Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited optical absorption with an onset at 2.65 eV (468 nm), whereas a sharp excitonic peak at 440 nm was evidenced for the annealed film. In spite of very weak PL, it was possible to resolve the structured emission with several distinct peaks (i.e., 463, 468, 473, 481, and 492 nm), which is rare to detect at room temperature.131 Recently, Gao et al. compared the optical properties of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, synthesized by two different approaches, namely weak-polar solvent at room temperature (WPRT) and conventional LARP.132 The PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs obtained by the WPRT method showed two distinct peaks at 414 nm (∼3.00 eV) and 433 nm (∼2.86 eV), whereas one emission peak was evidenced at 428 nm (∼2.90 eV) for these NCs synthesized by LARP. The dual emission peaks aroused from the various excitonic recombination channels, associated with the direct and indirect band gap transitions. It is worth noting here that the as-synthesized NCs by WPRT produced higher PL quantum yield (PLQY) than those synthesized by LARP.132 The optical properties of Cs3Bi2Br9 single crystals and QDs were also compared by Tang and co-workers.115 The single crystals of Cs3Bi2Br9 displayed an absorption onset at 2.61 eV along with the PL emission centered at 2.62 eV (473 nm) accompanied by a lower energy shoulder peak at 496 nm. In contrast, the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs exhibited excitation and emission peaks at ∼396 nm and 410 nm, respectively. A noticeable quantum confinement effect is responsible for such blue-shifted (60 nm) PL in QDs in comparison to the single crystals. The emission of Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs was tuned in the range of 393–545 nm by the halide mixing approach. A reasonable PLQY of 26.4% was evidenced for the Cs3Bi2Cl9 QDs.115 Additionally, from the temperature-dependent PL spectra, the exciton binding energy was estimated to be 57.1 meV and 210.7 meV for the single crystals and QDs, respectively,115 which play a significant role in the light absorption and emission properties of low-dimensional perovskites.37,124
Similar to Pb-based halide perovskites, halide mixing is also found to be an effective approach for tuning the absorption and PL emission in Cs3Bi2X9 NCs (X = Cl, Br, I), in which the exciton peaks and emission wavelengths were altered from 380 to 510 nm, and 400 to 560 nm, respectively with halide composition (Fig. 7c).114 The tuning of optical properties was accompanied by the color variations from light blue to dark red during the halide exchange from Cl to I, as displayed in Fig. 7d. A pronounced band edge excitonic peak at 439 nm along with the Stokes shifted (175 meV) blue emission centered at 468 nm was accomplished for the ligand-free Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. Similarly, Hodgkins et al. reported the band gap tuning in Cs3Bi2Br9−xIx solid solution, wherein the band gap was reduced from 2.66 eV of Cs3Bi2Br9 to 2.05 eV for Cs3Bi2Br3I6 by substituting I− with Br−.87 Recently, a sonication based approach was implemented for the synthesis of Cs3Bi2I9 NCs and subsequently, an anion exchange reaction was performed to vary the anion composition (X = Br, Cl, and I).133 The direct band gap was confirmed from the Tauc plots, which was found to be varied from 3.37 eV to 2.81 eV to 2.33 eV for Cs3Bi2Cl9, Cs3Bi2Br9, and Cs3Bi2I9 NCs, respectively. The excitonic and emission peaks of Cs3Bi2I9 NCs appeared at ∼485 nm (2.56 eV) and 550 nm (2.25 eV), respectively, associated with the emission line width of 65 nm and a low PLQY of ∼0.3%. Recently, Singh and co-workers tuned the optical properties of Cs3Bi2I9 by the cation mixing approach.134 The emission maxima in the solid-state PL study appeared at 497 nm and 546 nm for Cs3Bi2I9 and Rb0.05Cs2.95Bi2I9, respectively. Most importantly, Rb0.05Cs2.95Bi2I9 showed an improved PLQY of 17.63%.134 The optical band gaps of mechanochemically synthesized A3Bi2X9 powders (A = K+, Rb+, Cs+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) were covered from the near-UV (3.3 eV/380 nm for K3Bi2Cl9) to the red part of the visible spectrum (1.9 eV/650 nm for Cs3Bi2I9).122 Both the dry powders of Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Bi2I9 showed asymmetric and broad room-temperature PL maxima at 478 nm and 657 nm, respectively.
Kanatzidis and co-workers performed a detailed and comparative optical study of Bridgman grown single crystals of A3M2I9 (A = Cs, Rb; M = Bi, Sb), wherein the samples of Cs3Sb2I9, Rb3Bi2I9, Rb3Sb2I9, and Cs3Bi2I9 exhibited band gaps of 1.89, 1.93, 2.03, and 2.06 eV, respectively, at room temperature.82 The variation of band gap was further supported by the color of the crystals, for example the darkest red crystal of Cs3Sb2I9 and the lightest red crystal of Cs3Bi2I9 exhibited the lowest and highest band gaps, respectively. The single crystals of Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9, and Rb3Sb2I9 displayed weak PL emission in the range of 1.58–2.2 eV with a linewidth of 315–403 meV, whereas no emission was evidenced for Rb3Bi2I9 at room temperature and even at 15 K. The low-temperature PL study revealed several overlapping peaks in the specified range for Cs3Bi2I9 at 13 K. Conversely, the PL study of Cs3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9 revealed a broad near band-edge emission at 1.92 eV and a broad skewed peak at 1.96 eV at 13 K. The phonon-assisted recombination of the self-trapped excitons (STEs) was responsible for the broad emission in these materials.82 Significant attention has been given toward the materials displaying a strongly Stokes shifted and broad emission band from STEs, which might offer the prospect for solid-state lighting and white-light generation. Large electron–phonon coupling within the crystal lattice locally trapped the charge carriers resulting in the formation of STEs.65,82,135 The formation of STEs has a favourable connection with the reduced dimensionality and localized electrons–holes of a system.59,136 Recently, several low-dimensional all-inorganic halide perovskites exhibited STE emission bands.59,137–140 Similar STE emission was also reported for a single crystal of the (111)-oriented defect perovskite, 2D layered Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, by Kanatzidis and co-workers.88 In spite of the similar band gap values of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 (2.07 eV) and Cs3Bi2I9 (2.06 eV), the Cl incorporation in the parent Cs3Bi2I9 lattice brought direct band gap nature in layered Cs3Bi2I6Cl3. However, DFT study confirmed that bridging Cl did not contribute to the band edge states of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3. The PL emission at 13 K was characterized by a single broad peak at 1.94 eV associated with a low-energy tail, while the emission band red-shifted to 1.92 eV with increasing temperature and finally quenched at 80 K. The enhanced electron–phonon coupling due to the substitution I with more electronegative Cl is responsible for the phonon-assisted STE recombination.88
Recently, our group reported the synthesis of NCs and ultrathin 2D NSs of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, which showed distinctive morphology-dependent optical properties.108 The nanostructured Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 samples exhibited excitonic peaks at ∼496 nm (∼2.50 eV), while the emission bands appeared at 520 nm (∼2.38 eV) with a narrow FWHM of ∼13 nm. The small Stokes shifted emission of 0.12 eV implied the major role of bound excitonic recombination toward the PL emission. Interestingly, the presence of a minimal trap or defect states due to the passivation effect of bridged Cl was believed to be responsible for the sharp emission of all nanostructured Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 samples in contrast to the broad emission of reported Cs3Bi2I9 nanostructures.107 Furthermore, the minor variations in excitonic dynamics and the broadened PL emission at 77 K were ascribed to the activation of shallow trap states with energy levels close to the band edge. We have also estimated the exciton binding energy value of ∼70 meV for Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 NCs from the temperature-dependent analysis of PL intensity.108 Additionally, fluorescence microscopy and super-resolution optical imaging were implemented to examine the PL properties of individual Cs3Bi2I9 NPL and the NS and NC of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 at the single-particle level, which revealed high photostability and distinct fluctuations of emission events (i.e. blinking) in nanodomains.107,108 The fluorescence nature of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 NSs through fluorescence microscopy SIM) is evidenced from Fig. 6g. Within a single NS, the localized distributions of blinking events were characterized as shown in Fig. 6h–j. Recently Seshadri's group witnessed a dramatic variation in the optical properties for the solid solution of Cs3Bi2(Cl1−xIx)9.86 A shift of absorption edges toward the lower energy associated with the peak widening was evidenced with the increase in the occupancy of I atoms, which was further supported by the observed color changes from yellow to orange.
4.3. Sb-based 2D all-inorganic perovskites
Saparov et al. reported the synthesis of Cs3Sb2I9 with 0D dimer and 2D layered forms as orange and red-coloured materials, respectively, which implied the lower band gap of the layered form.77 The layered Cs3Sb2I9 thin film showed a direct band gap of 2.05 eV with a broad PL peak maximum at ∼633 nm (1.96 eV). The theoretical band structure of Cs3Sb2I9 revealed that the valence band maximum constructed of mixed I p and Sb s states, while the conduction band minimum was acquired from the Sb p states. Later on, Nag and co-workers synthesized colloidal NPLs and NRs of Cs3Sb2I9 and spherical NCs of Rb3Sb2I9.103 The red-coloured NRs of Cs3Sb2I9 showed the lowest energy absorption peak at 574 nm (∼2.16 eV) with a longer energy absorption tail ranging up to 615 nm, whereas a blue-shifted optical gap was evidenced for yellow-coloured NPLs as a result of the quantum confinement effect. The excitonic dynamics indicated a strong influence of non-radiative decay on the PL behaviour of both NRs and NPLs. The optical properties of Rb3Sb2I9 NCs were found to be similar to those of Cs3Sb2I9.
In a recent study, pressure dependent band gap tuning was perceived for the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs, in which the band gap was narrowed down to 1.36 eV from 2.05 eV by applying high pressure due to the lattice distortion and compression of [SbI6]3− octahedra.141 An interesting piezochromic behaviour was observed earlier for Cs3Sb2I9 crystals, in which reversible transformations of the crystal color (orange-yellow ↔ opaque black) and band gap (between 2.34 eV ↔ 1.32 eV) were evidenced upon applying and releasing of pressure. Colloidal dispersion of Cs3Sb2Cl9 NWs showed an optical band gap of 3.4 eV and the PL emission maximum at 436 nm with a PLQY of 4%.104 Recently, Pradhan et al. reported band gap engineering of Cs3Sb2Cl9 upon Bi substitution.142 It was witnessed that all the as-synthesized materials (i.e., Cs3Sb2−xBixCl9) showed indirect band gap behaviour, where the band gap was decreased with Bi substitution up to x = 0.1, and after that an increase in band gap was evident with further substitution of Bi.142 A monotonic decrease of band gap in the range of 3.09–2.05 eV was evidenced with halide substitution in Cs3Bi2X9 NCs associated with a distinct color change from white to dark red.106 Moreover, a series of B-site alloyed Cs3(SbyBi1−y)2Br9 (y = 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4) NCs was prepared, which exhibited a minor blue-shifted excitonic absorption peak from Cs3Sb2Br9 to Cs3Bi2Br9.106 The optical properties of stable and brightly luminescent Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs were compared with their single crystal form.113 The single crystal of Cs3Sb2Br9 showed a direct band gap value of 2.36 eV, accompanied by a PL emission peak at 534 nm with a linewidth of 80 nm. Conversely, the colloidal QDs displayed a noticeable exciton peak at ∼375 nm and a narrow emission peak at 410 nm with a linewidth of 41 nm. A blue-shifted PL emission of around 120 nm for QDs with regard to the single crystal clearly demonstrates a strong quantum confinement effect. A high PLQY of 46% at 410 nm was measured for Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs, which was higher than the other reported perovskite QDs.113 Ma et al. recently synthesized violet-emissive Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs, which also exhibited a high PLQY of 51.2% with an intense PL peak at ∼409 nm.84 Additionally, with increasing temperature, the PL emission intensity was monotonically reduced, which is mainly attributed to the thermal activation of non-radiative recombination. The exciton binding energy (EB) of the QDs was found to be ∼40 meV. Interestingly, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ∼0.206% was achieved by using Cs3Sb2Br9 QD-based electrically driven violet LEDs.84
However, only a few studies were reported based on Rb-based materials with A3B2X9-type composition. Harikesh et al. observed that the color of Rb3Sb2I9 films was red in contradiction of the orange colored films of the direct band gap Cs3Sb2I9 dimer.143 By assuming both the direct and indirect band gap nature of Rb3Sb2I9, the values were calculated to be 2.24 and 2.1 eV, respectively from the Tauc plot fitting. Recently, a band gap tuning was achieved for the Rb3Sb2Br9−xIx (x = 0–9) thin films, where the band gap was varied in the range of 2.24–2.76 eV and 2.02–2.46 eV for the direct and indirect gap, respectively. The PL emission maximum was shifted from 639 nm to 525 nm with Br substitution in Rb3Sb2I9. Furthermore, a lower PL intensity with a narrower linewidth of Rb3Sb2Br9 was evidenced as compared to the iodide analogue.143
4.4. All-inorganic layered double perovskites
Few years back, a layered double perovskite Cs4CuSb2Cl12 was synthesized, which exhibited a direct band gap of ∼1 eV and stability under ambient conditions.90 Subsequently, Singhal et al. reported a similar band gap value of polycrystalline Cs4CuSb2Cl12.121 Later on, Wang et al. synthesized NCs of Cs4CuSb2Cl12, which showed a band gap of 1.6 eV.144 A blue-shifted and prominent excitonic absorption peak at ∼600 nm was evidenced for NCs in comparison to the bulk microcrystals due to the quantum confinement effect. The observed low-energy absorption tail implied the existence of sub-band gap states. The as-synthesized NCs exhibited a weak PL behaviour with an emission maximum at ∼630 nm. Recently, colloidal Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs exhibited a broad absorption band centered at 523 nm with the absorption onset at ∼760 nm and a line-width of 110 nm. Furthermore, Tauc plot analysis revealed a direct band gap of 1.79 eV.123 In 2018, a series of Mn-substituted microcrystalline powder of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 (i.e. Cs4Mn1−xCuxSb2Cl12, x = 0 → 1) was synthesized in order to tune the optical band gap. The pure Mn- and Cu-based materials (i.e. Cs4MnSb2Cl12 and Cs4CuSb2Cl12) showed the band gap of 3.0 and 1.0 eV, respectively. However, a nonlinear change in band gap was evidenced for the mixed compositions. All these materials did not display any noteworthy emission behaviour except for the pure Mn-based Cs4MnSb2Cl12, which exhibited a strong PL emission at 605 nm mainly ascribed to the 4T1 → 6A1 transition of Mn2+.91 In the subsequent year, Lin et al. prepared two direct band gap-based bulk Cs4CdSb2Cl12 and Cs4CdBi2Cl12, which exhibited a band gap of 3.00 and 3.23 eV, respectively.92 The bulk Cs4CdSb2Cl12 showed no PL emission at 298 K, however, PL emission was achieved at low temperatures. Woodward and co-workers examined the optical properties of Cs4CdBi2Cl12 and Cs4MnBi2Cl12 and their mixed solid solution of Cs4Cd1−xMnxBi2Cl12.145 A substantial enrichment of PL intensity was evidenced for Mn2+ substituted Cs4CdBi2Cl12 with a PLQY of 57% at specific composition (i.e., Cs4Cd0.73Mn0.27Bi2Cl12). Recently, a large number of members of 2D double halide perovskites have been explored through collective computational and experimental efforts by Solis-Ibarra and co-workers.93 Out of these, only a few materials were successfully synthesized, for example Cs4CdSb2Cl12, Rb4MnSb2Cl12, Rb4CuSb2Cl12, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, and Cs4CdBi2Cl12. The direct band gaps of Cs4CdBi2Cl12, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, Cs4CdSb2Cl12, and Rb4MnSb2Cl12 were found to be ∼3 eV, whereas a band gap of 0.9 eV was evidenced for Rb4CuSb2Cl12. The color of the as-synthesized materials was significantly varied, such as Mn-based (Rb4MnSb2Cl12 and Cs4MnBi2Cl12) and Cu-based materials (Rb4CuSb2Cl12) were pale pink and black crystalline solids, respectively. In contrast, Cd-based microcrystalline solids (Cs4CdSb2Cl12 and Cs4CdBi2Cl12) were found to be colorless. Interestingly, all of the as-synthesized materials produced a relative broad PL emission, apart from Rb4CuSb2Cl12. Specifically, Cs4CdSb2Cl12 showed a broad PL emission covering the visible spectral region with a FWHM of 220 nm, which was ascribed to the existence of STEs.
4.5. Doping in 2D all-inorganic perovskites
Recently, extensive investigations have been executed on the synthesis and characterization of doped halide perovskites, which demonstrated distinctive electronic and optical properties and improved efficiency for optoelectronic devices.146 Transition and rare earth metal ion doping in traditional perovskites imparts different types of energy transitions, which bring innovative light-emission pathways.146 Only a few handful reports are available on metal ion doping in all-inorganic 2D layered perovskites.110,111,147,148 In early days, Ghosh and Mukherjee first introduced Ni2+ doping in the single crystals of Cs2CdCl4, which is isostructural to 2D layered K2NiF4.147 A broad and weak emission band appeared at 617.28 nm (16200 cm−l) from 2% Ni-doped Cs2CdCl4 at room temperature. In contrast, two distinctive and well-separated emission bands were evidenced at 816.33 nm (12250 cm−1) and 611.99 nm (16340 cm−l) at 77 K, which were assigned to the 1T2(D) → 3T2(F) and 1T2(D) → 3A2(F) transitions of Ni2+, respectively.147 Recently, Eu3+-doped Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were prepared,148 where the absorption band edges of doped QDs were slightly blue-shifted from the absorption edge of the undoped system with increasing dopant concentrations, as displayed in Fig. 8a. The estimated optical band gap was increased from 2.62 eV to 2.72 eV with an increase in Eu3+ concentration in Cs3Bi2Br9. Fig. 8b reveals that the Eu3+-doped Cs3Bi2Br9 displayed an excitonic emission peak centered at 446 nm along with several narrow dopant emission lines at 581, 592, 620, 653 and 697 nm, which were attributed to the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transition of Eu3+ ions. An effective energy transfer from the host to dopant energy level (Eu3+) was confirmed from the gradual increase of dopant emission and the subsequent decrease of excitonic emission with increasing concentration of Eu3+. The average lifetime of Eu3+ dopant emission was found to be 670 μs, which remains unaltered with the dopant concentration.148 The PLQY of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs was found to be 18.1%, whereas the Eu3+-doped Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs exhibited an improved PLQY of ∼42.4%.148 Recently, Dutta et al. first reported Mn2+ doping in the all-inorganic RP phase of Cs2PbCl2I2 NPLs.111 The absorption edge of Mn2+ doped Cs2PbCl2I2 NPLs remained comparable to the undoped NPLs at ∼407 nm with a band gap of 3.04 eV. Doped NPLs displayed a dominant dopant emission at 595 nm ascribed to the d–d transition of Mn2+ together with the host emission at ∼422 nm. The lifetimes of Mn2+ dopant emission in doped NPLs were estimated to be 1.05 ms and 2.34 ms at room and liquid N2 temperatures, respectively.111 A reasonable PLQY of ∼16% was evidenced for 1.7% Mn2+ doped Cs2PbCl2I2 NPLs.111 Subsequently, we have also explored the detailed optical properties of Mn2+ doped Cs2PbCl2I2 NCs at room temperature and at 77 K,110 which showed dopant emission at 585 nm in addition to the host emission (Fig. 8c and d). The d–d (4T1 → 6A1) transition of Mn2+ was responsible of the intense dopant emission and its forbidden nature was verified by the estimated long lifetime on the ms time scale. Finally, we provide a summary of the evolution of PLQY for 2D all-inorganic nanostructures by the use of a bar diagram (vide. Fig. 9).

5. Thermal transport properties and thermoelectrics
Although the influence of the lattice vibration on the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites has been studied,7,82,149 the thermal transport and thermoelectric properties of these compounds have gained significant attention recently.150 The thermometric efficiency of a material can be designated by the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT = (σS2/κ)T, where T, σ, S, and κ denote the absolute temperature, electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, respectively. The progress of efficient thermoelectric materials can be accomplished by the concurrent improvement in power factor (σS2) and reduction in κ.151–153
Recently, few experimental and theoretical studies were reported on the investigation of the thermal properties of halide perovskites, mostly based on organic–inorganic hybrid analogues,154–159 where the thermal conductivity was expectedly low due to their soft lattice structure.150 The investigation of thermoelectric properties in all-inorganic perovskites is limited over the 3D crystal structure. Lee et al. reported the thermal properties of several perovskite NWs (such as CsSnI3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3), which showed ultralow thermal conductivity in the range of 0.38–0.45 W m−1 K−1 and a zT of ∼0.11 for CsSnI3 at room temperature.160 Furthermore, zT was improved (0.14 ± 0.01 at 345 K) via optimization of the Cl doping in CsSnI3−xClx thin films.161 Recently, Kanatzidis’ group has reported the ultralow thermal conductivity of CsSnX3 (X = Br, I), which was ascribed to the dynamic cation off-centering with the distortion of SnX6 octahedra and obtained a zT of ∼0.15 at 550 K for CsSnI3.162 This is the highest experimentally reported zT value among the family of all-inorganic halide perovskites, but this value is significantly low compared to the state of the art thermoelectric materials due to the electrically resistive nature of halide perovskites.150 2D metal chalcogenides are potential thermoelectric materials owing to their anisotropic crystal structure and low thermal conductivity.163–166 Thus, 2D halide perovskites may be a potential contender for future low thermal conductivity materials and thermoelectrics. The thermal conductivity of 2D CsPb2Br5 films was found to be ∼0.33 ± 0.02 W m−1 K−1.167 Recently, we reported an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κL) in the Bridgeman grown single crystals of the all-inorganic layered RP perovskite, Cs2PbI2Cl2, where the measured anisotropic κL was found to be ∼0.37–0.28 W m−1 K−1 in the 295–523 K temperature range. The combined low-temperature Raman and heat-capacity measurements along with DFT calculations revealed that the soft elastic layered structure and the presence of low energy optical phonon modes with strong acoustic-optical phonon coupling led to an ultralow κL in Cs2PbI2Cl2 (as shown in Fig. 10).168 Hence, it is promising to explore the thermal transport properties of all-inorganic 2D halide perovskites, which have potential application in thermoelectric and photovoltaic devices.150,169,170

6. Magnetic properties
Recently 2D transition metal halides with intrinsic magnetism have drawn pronounced attention due to their possible applications in spintronic devices.171,172 In addition, these compounds are enriched with different interesting magnetic states, which include ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), skyrmion and quantum spin liquids.173,174 One can also form hetero-structure interfaces by incorporating these 2D magnetic materials into other functional devices.171,172 Among the 2D transition metal halides, perovskite magnetic halides are comparatively less studied.175 In general the 2D RP phase is adopted in the K2NiF4 structure, where NiF2 layers are separated by two KF layers. The intra-layer interactions are FM in nature, whereas the inter-layer interactions are AFM type.176 Most of the members of this system were magnetically ordered at low temperatures. For example, both 2D Rb2MnCl4 and Cs2MnCl4 undergo the AFM transition at around TN = 55 K.177 On the other hand, the Rb2CuCl4−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2) compounds have a much lower transition temperature, TN = 13.7 K to 17.2 K.176 The super-exchange interaction between transition metal ions via a halogen played the vital role behind the observed magnetism.
It is worth mentioning that transition metal based layered halide double perovskites (〈111〉-oriented, n = 3) with nominal composition, Cs4Mn1−xCuxSb2Cl12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), have certain important magnetic properties.91 The layered Cs4MnSb2Cl12 compound is AFM in nature, whereas Pauli paramagnetic behavior is observed in the case of Cs4CuSb2Cl12, as shown in Fig. 11a. This type of paramagnetic behavior is an indication of the delocalization of thermally excited charge carriers present in the system. This is also in line with the metallic nature of the Cs4CuSb2Cl12 compound.91 Cs3Cu2Cl4Br3 with a double-layered perovskite structure is a new addition to this magnetic halide system.76 It has two layers of Cu2Cl4Br3 with elongated CuCl4Br2 octahedra (see details in the structure section). Like Rb2CuCl4−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2) materials, Cs3Cu2Cl4Br3 also undergoes an AFM transition at around 14 K, which is demonstrated in Fig. 11b (inset). The spin singlet state with a large value of excitation gap is observed in Cs3Cu2Cl4Br3, which arises due to the dimerization between the two Cu2Cl4Br3 layers. In addition to the AFM transition, Cs3Cu2Cl4Br3 has a structural phase transition at around 330 K and this transition is related to the order–disorder transition of Cu2+ orbitals, as shown in Fig. 11b.76

7. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Over the past few years, various attempts have been implemented to design and synthesize halide perovskite materials for their efficient applications in photo-electrochemistry, specifically in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.28–30 A sustainable approach to produce clean solar fuels and feedstocks (such as, CH4, CO, CH3OH, HCOOH, etc.) is the solar-driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. In order to use as a catalyst in CO2 photoreduction, the minima of the conduction band position of a halide perovskite should be higher than the redox potential of CO2. Thus, the excited electrons at the conduction band with an appropriate electronic structure accelerated the redox reaction before experiencing the excitonic recombination. The redox reactions responsible for the CO2 reduction process to generate the final gaseous products (e.g., CH4 and CO) are shown below:178,179    
The adsorbed CO2 reacts with the photogenerated electrons to generate CO and CH4, whereas the protons participated in this reaction were extracted from the oxidation of water at the valence band. In general, if the photogenerated holes and electrons are rapidly recombined, the efficiency of catalysts will be reduced drastically.178,179
Herein, we summarize the recent developments and utilization of 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites in the field of photocatalysis. Little considerations were given to the use of halide perovskites as photocatalysts, until Park et al. revealed the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) catalyzed photocatalytic evolution of H2 from aqueous HI solution, which is better known as photocatalytic HI splitting.180 Since then, several halide perovskite materials were employed in photocatalysis. For example, Xu et al. reported an efficient conversion of CO2 into solar fuels in a non-aqueous medium (e.g., ethyl acetate) by implementing a novel photocatalyst in the form of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 QDs.181 Later on, Guo et al. showed a correlation between the catalytic reactivity and the altered band energy by halide mixing in CsPb(BrxCl1−x)3.182 To date, most of the reports based on the halide perovskite-driven photocatalysis have been directed toward Pb-based perovskites such as CsPbX3 and MAPbX3 with a 3D crystal structure.29,183
However, the toxicity of Pb restricted their use for photocatalytic application. In view of this, a search for Pb-free halide perovskites for the photocatalytic reactions is essential. Bhosale et al. reported the prospective application of Pb-free low-dimensional all-inorganic Bi-based perovskite in the CO2 photoreduction process.184 A new top-down synthetic method through ultrasonication was implemented to synthesize three materials, Rb3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, and MA3Bi2I9, which were found to be stable in extreme environments like light illumination and humidity. All these NCs exhibited rich optical properties in terms of excitonic transitions and intense PL emissions. Furthermore, these NCs were utilized as photocatalysts for the CO2 reduction at the gas–solid interface to form end products, CH4 and CO, which is schematically presented in Fig. 12a. In order to circumvent the difficulties of limited CO2 solubility and formation of harmful products by the photoreaction of solvent molecules, the photoreduction was performed at the gas–solid interface instead of the conventional gas–liquid interface. The yields of end products followed the trends: Cs3Bi2I9 ≫ Rb3Bi2I9 > MA3Bi2I9 ≫ TiO2 for CO, and Rb3Bi2I9 > Cs3Bi2I9 > MA3Bi2I9 ≫ TiO2 for CH4, where TiO2 was used as a standard for the CO2 photoreduction process. During each hour of reaction, the yield of CH4 as the end product using various catalysts is shown in Fig. 12b, whereas Fig. 12c shows the comparison of CH4 and CO production through the photochemical reaction for 10 h. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and diffuse-reflectance infrared (DRIR) spectroscopic measurements were employed in situ to monitor the mechanism of the CO2 reduction reaction. The analysis from EPR measurements revealed a better charge transfer in Cs3Bi2I9, while in MA3Bi2I9 a limited charge transport was evidenced. The CO2 photoreduction process proceeded through the formation of either a carbonate or formate intermediate path. The report suggested the significant role of the crystal structures and cations influencing the catalytic activity. Afterward, Lu et al. implemented 2D Cs3Sb2Br9 perovskite NCs as a catalyst in the solar-driven CO2 reduction reaction, which exhibited an enhancement in activity up to 10-fold in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with an estimated yield of 510 μmol g−1 of CO after 4 h in comparison to the CsPbBr3 NCs, as exemplified in Fig. 12d.185 The morphology of Cs3Sb2Br9 NCs is shown in Fig. 5i. DFT calculations revealed the proficient generation of reaction intermediates in the form of COOH* and CO* (where * indicates the adsorption site) due to the existence of exposed active Sb sites on the surface of Cs3Sb2Br9, while for the limiting step of COOH* adsorption, high free energy was evidenced for the unreactive CsPbBr3 surface. The report demonstrated the significance of the crystal structure of halide perovskite catalysts in influencing the exposure of catalytically active surfaces.

8. Conclusions and future outlook
In this minireview, we have summarized the recent progress in the understanding of the structures, synthesis, chemical transformations, and different properties of 2D layered all-inorganic halide perovskite nanostructures. 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites are promising alternatives of hybrid perovskites due to their superior intrinsic stability and intriguing physical properties. The synthesis of these nanostructures is focused extensively on the hot-injection and LARP approaches in solution. The morphology of the nanostructures depends on the reaction temperature, size of A cation, organic ligand, solvent etc. The anion-exchange reaction by adding different halide sources is a facile way to achieve perovskites with varied halide compositions. Further in situ investigations are required to understand the mechanism and growth kinetics of 2D perovskite halide nanostructures.
Here, we have reviewed different family all-inorganic 2D perovskites, mainly 〈100〉- and 〈111〉-oriented perovskites. The 〈111〉-oriented perovskites or defect perovskites are a rich sub-group of all inorganic perovskites, whereas few 〈100〉-oriented perovskites of RP phase were reported recently. The Dion–Jacobson (DJ) and Aurivillius perovskites are also 〈100〉-direction perovskites, which are well known in solid state metal oxides and some of them are known even in the hybrid perovskite family.186 Thus, these phases are desired with all-inorganic counterparts which can be synthesized by selecting appropriate compositions or by expanding the choice of A cation. Both the theoretical and experimental studies are required to stabilize these phases and to understand their structure–property relationship.
The optical properties including high PL intensity, tunable emission, narrower linewidths, high PLQY, wide band gap behavior, and excitonic properties of various 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites are discussed. PL blinking properties of the nanostructures of 2D halide perovskites are rarely studied, thereby, need to be explored. We have discussed the magnetic properties of transition metal-based 2D perovskites in this mini-review. Recently, halide perovskites showed promise for ultra-low thermal conductivity and decent thermoelectric performance. We believe that heavy metal based all-inorganic halide perovskites are good contenders for future thermoelectrics. Until now, few handful reports on the thermoelectric properties of 3D halide perovskites and the thermal properties of 2D hybrid perovskites have been reported. The family of 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites should exhibit promising thermoelectric properties due to their soft crystal structure, superior stability and bond anharmonicity.
Largely, these halide perovskites are potential candidates for solar cells, LEDs, diodes, lasers, and photodetectors. We have discussed here an emerging area of application of all-inorganic perovskite halides as photocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction. 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites are believed to be promising candidates for photocatalysis due to their superior stability, band gap tunability, and large excitonic binding energy. The challenges are to find novel environmentally benign Pb-free 2D all-inorganic perovskites with appropriate band gap energy and to control the recombination efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Thus, the design of appropriate materials requires additional in-depth investigations through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. However, the photocatalytic applications of 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites require special attention for future investigations, which should be focused on the variation of their structure and electronic properties to understand the reaction mechanism of light-driven CO2 reduction. Hence, the future of 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites is bright and we hope this minireview provides a new opportunity for optoelectronics, magnetism, thermoelectrics and photocatalysis as well as the structure–property relationships in 2D all-inorganic halide perovskites.
