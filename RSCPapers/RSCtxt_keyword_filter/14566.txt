    , Accepted 22nd August 2014First published on 22nd August 2014AbstractA novel strategy was introduced to prepare a Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite, in which the reduction of Pt4+ and the exfoliation of SnS2 were performed in one step. The Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite was applied as the counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). When compared with the energy conversion efficiency (Eff) of SnO2 CE based DSCs, the DSCs with Pt–SnO2 CE showed an overall Eff of 8.83%, giving an improvement of 198%. Meanwhile, better electrocatalytic activity towards I3−/I− redox pairs than Pt CE indicated that the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite was a promising electrocatalyst for DSCs. Moreover, the low Pt content of the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite would accelerate the large-scale applications of DSCs in the future.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were first reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 and have achieved considerable advancement due to their low consumption, easy fabrication and powerful harvesting efficiency.1,2 To date, the highest energy conversion efficiency of DSCs is up to 13%.3 In general, a typical DSC is composed of three key components: a sensitizer dye adsorbed nanocrystalline TiO2 anode, an electrolyte containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple and a counter electrode (CE).4,5 As a superior CE material, platinum (Pt) is confirmed to possess excellent catalytic activity for I3− reduction. However, the limited reserve and high cost of Pt severely restrict the large-scale application of DSCs.6 Therefore, several efforts have been devoted for exploring low-cost and high performance materials as replacements for Pt.
The CE materials investigated thus far include different forms of carbon materials,7–9 conducting polymers,10 metal sulphides,11,12 metal carbides,13 metal nitrides,14 metal phosphides15 and metal oxides.16–20 Compared to other materials, metal oxides have unique properties, such as high stability, low cost, environment-friendly and high catalytic activity.21,22 Among the common metal oxides, tin dioxide (SnO2), as a wide bandgap semiconductor, has been utilized as a CE material.23,24 Unfortunately, the slightly low electrocatalytic activity of pure SnO2 has restricted its applications. Recently, Wu et al. prepared SnO2 under a N2 atmosphere yielded an energy conversion efficiency of 6.09%.23 Pan et al. utilized a highly active nonstoichiometric SnO2−δ as a CE material and achieved an overall efficiency of 4.81%.24 Meanwhile, loading traditional materials with Pt was also confirmed to be a useful method to improve catalytic activity.25 However, the Pt percentage is still very high to achieve the target of low-cost.26
Here, we demonstrate a novel method to synthesize a Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite, and utilize it as a CE material in DSCs. In this method, the reduction of Pt4+ and the exfoliation of SnS2 are performed in one step upon treatment with a solution of n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). The Pt–SnO2 based solar cells yields an energy conversion efficiency of 8.83%, significantly higher than that of SnO2 with an improvement of 198%. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt–SnO2 is even better than traditional Pt, indicating that the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite is a promising catalyst in DSCs. Meanwhile, indicatively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) confirmed that the weight ratio of Pt in the Pt–SnO2 composite was 23.1%, lower than previous reports (66.7–93.0%).26,29
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite
The Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite was synthesized using a two-step method. Firstly, a mixture of 0.6 g of SnS2 nanoparticles (synthesized using a previously reported method12) and 140 mg of PtCl4 (Sinopharm, AR) were added into 50 mL of hexane (Sinopharm, AR) under an argon atmosphere, followed by stirring for 3 h at 323 K. Secondly, 8 mL of n-BuLi solution (1.6 M in hexane) was injected into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 24 h. After the reaction, a black powder was obtained by filteration, washed with hexane and ethanol, and dried in air at 333 K. Finally, the product was sintered in a muffle furnace at 673 K for 30 min.
2.2 Preparation of the counter electrodes
The Pt–SnO2 coated counter electrodes were prepared on a F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) substrate (NSG, 8 Ω per square) using a paste made from the Pt–SnO2 powder obtained by screen-printing technology. The paste was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite powder with 2.03 g of anhydrous terpineol, 2.6 g of ethyl celluloses in ethanol (10 wt%) and 8 mL of ethanol followed by stirring, sonication and concentration. For comparison, SnO2 (AR) was purchased from Sinopharm and the SnO2 CE films prepared using the same procedure. The Pt electrode was prepared by drop-casting a 0.5 mM H2PtCl6/ethanol solution onto the cleaned FTO conductive glass. Subsequently, the films formed were annealed at 723 K for 30 min.
2.3 Fabrication of the DSCs
The procedure for preparing the TiO2 photoanode is described in detail as follows: firstly, the FTO substrate was dipped into 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 343 K (TiCl4 treatment). Then a 12 μm-thick layer of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was loaded on the FTO by a screen-printing technique with an area of about 0.25 cm2. After sintering at 398 K, the layer obtained was further coated with a 4 μm-thick scattering layer of 200 nm-sized TiO2 particles (HEPTACHROMA, DHS-NanoT200) followed by sintering at 773 K. Another TiCl4 treatment was carried followed by sintering at 773 K for 30 min. After cooling to 353 K, the photoanodes (TiO2 films) were immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (v/v = 1/1) for 24 h. The DSCs were assembled together with the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and Pt–SnO2 CE by a 25 μm-thick hot-melt film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont) and sealed up by heating. The cell internal space was filled with typical liquid electrolytes using a vacuum pump. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate with acetonitrile as the solvent. The DSCs assembled were used for the photocurrent–voltage tests with an active area of 0.25 cm2. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the symmetrical dummy cells were assembled by two identical CEs clipping the above liquid electrolyte.25
2.4 Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F, F20, 200 kV), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV). The current–voltage tests of DSCs were performed under one sun conditions using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (Model 91150 V). The EIS experiments were measured with dummy cells in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). The frequency range of the EIS experiments was from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and bias DC voltage of 0.60 V. The curves were fitted using Z-view software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system containing a solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 using a BAS 100 B/W electrochemical analyzer. Platinum served as the CE and a Ag/Ag+ couple used as the reference electrode. Tafel polarization curves were measured with dummy cells in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). Elemental analysis was conducted by indicatively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Vanan 710). The chemical states of the elements in the nanocomposites were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD), and the binding energy of the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was considered to be an internal reference. The nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010N system.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite
A schematic diagram of the synthesis of Pt–SnO2 is shown in Fig. 1A. In this procedure, in order to bind the Pt precursors from the solution onto the SnO2 surface and obtain ultrafine dispersions of Pt nanocrystallites, SnS2 nanosheets were utilized as raw materials because sulfur exhibits a strong affinity for noble metals owing to a soft acid–soft base interaction.25,27 The solution of n-BuLi functioned not only as a strong reducing agent, providing reducing conditions to reduce the Pt4+ but also as an exfoliation agent. SnS2 is one kind of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LMDCs). The solution of n-BuLi offers Li+, which could intercalate inside the LMDCs and crush the bulk material into small particles.28 Residual sulfur can be completely removed from the product by heat-treatment.

The overall morphology of both SnS2 nanosheets and the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite were analyzed using the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 1. The raw SnS2 nanosheets present a typical hexagonal structure and their mean diameter is in the range of 20–30 nm, which can be confirmed by the TEM image (see Fig. 1E). After treatment with n-BuLi, the bulk material were exfoliated and crushed into uniform ultra-small particles, whose average diameter was around 2–3 nm (see Fig. 1D and F). From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (see Fig. 1B) of the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite, it can be seen that all diffraction peaks of the typical XRD pattern could be attributed to SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445) and Pt (JCPDS no. 65-2868), respectively. The ICP-AES measurement indicates that the weight ratio of Pt in the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite is 23.1%.
In order to investigate the impact of sintering (723 K) in the preparation of CEs, the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposite obtained was further calcined at 723 K for 30 min. SEM images and the XRD pattern indicate that no obvious change in the morphology and composition occurred (see Fig. S1†). The valence state of the Pt after the second thermal treatment is Pt0 and Pt (IV), as analyzed by XPS (Fig. S2†). The nitrogen sorption isotherms indicate the specific surface area of Pt–SnO2 is 36.96 m2 g−1, much larger than that of Pt (10.48 m2 g−1) found in a previous report.18 Furthermore, SEM images of Pt–SnO2 and Pt CEs on FTO are shown in Fig. S1.† Both the Pt–SnO2 nanocomposites and Pt nanoparticles disperse well on the surface of the FTO. In order to compare the surface area of Pt–SnO2 and the Pt CEs, the mass of materials on different CEs were obtained using ICP-AES measurements. As a result, the surface area of Pt–SnO2 CE (1.63 cm2) is larger than that of Pt CE (0.63 cm2), and the data are summarized in detail in Table. S1.†
3.2 Photovoltaic measurement
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 2) of the DSCs with different CEs were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and the detailed photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the DSC using SnO2 CE shows an overall energy conversion efficiency (Eff) of 2.96%, which indicates that pure SnO2 CE present poor electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. In contrast, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and Eff of the DSCs based on Pt–SnO2 CEs are 16.24 mA cm−2, 731 mV, 0.74 and 8.83%, respectively. The higher Voc and FF of Pt–SnO2 may be due to the more interfacial active sites of Pt–SnO2 CEs. It is worth noting that the Eff of Pt–SnO2 CEs is even larger than that of Pt CEs based DSCs (8.04%), indicating that the Pt–SnO2 CEs exhibit better electrocatalytic activity than that of Pt CEs.

3.3 Electrochemical measurements
In order to further investigate the different catalytic activity for triiodide reduction between the Pt–SnO2 CEs and Pt CEs, EIS technique was employed and the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells are shown in Fig. 3. After fitting the spectra with an EIS spectrum analyzer, the values of the series resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) were obtained and summarized in Table 1. The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental EIS data is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Rs is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of the CEs material, resistance of FTO glass substrate and contact resistance, etc. The Rs of Pt–SnO2 CEs is 21.46 Ω, while this value for Pt CEs is 21.95 Ω. A smaller Rs value indicates that Pt–SnO2 CEs have faster electron transfer kinetics and better electrical conductivity than Pt CEs, which is consistent with the improvement of Jsc.16Rct is a measure of the ease of electron exchange between the counter electrode and the electrolyte and thus varies inversely with the triiodide reduction activity of the CEs. The slightly lower Rct of Pt–SnO2 CEs leads to a better catalytic activity, explaining its better performance than that of the Pt CEs based cells.17 Although the difference of Rs and Rct between Pt–SnO2 and Pt CEs isn't obvious, the larger capacitance (C) of the Pt–SnO2 CE indicates a higher surface area than that of Pt CE, which is responsible for higher Eff, in agreement with the measured surface area of various CEs in Table S1.†,30 In conclusion, low Rs, low Rct and high C resulted in the high power-conversion efficiency of the DSCs with Pt–SnO2 CE and agreed well with the photovoltaic experiments.

As a powerful electrochemical characterization method, Tafel polarization measurements were carried out to further examine the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the triiodide/iodide couple on the electrode surface with dummy cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE//electrolyte//CE). The Tafel curves in Fig. 4 show that the current density (J) is a logarithmic function of the voltage (U). Generally, the Tafel curve is composed of three zones via the value of overpotential: the polarization zone at low overpotential, Tafel zone at middle overpotential (with a sharp slope), diffusion zone at high overpotential. In the Tafel zone, the curve of the Pt–SnO2 CE shows a larger slope than the conventional Pt CE, indicating the presence of a large exchange current density on the electrode surface, which means that the Pt–SnO2 CE has a higher catalytic activity than that of the Pt CE. Moreover, the current densities of Pt–SnO2 CE obtained in all three zones are higher, which is consistent with the results of photovoltaic and EIS measurements.25

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was further carried out in a three-electrode system to evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of the Pt–SnO2 CE (Fig. 5). Typical curves with two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks were obtained for the Pt–SnO2 CE. The left peak corresponds to the redox reaction shown in eqn (1), while the right one corresponds to the reaction shown in eqn (2). I3− + 2e = 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e = 2I3−(2)

The peak-to-peak splitting (Epp) of the Pt–SnO2 CE is 492 mV, which is much smaller than that of bare Pt CE (670 mV), suggesting that the electrocatalytic activity and reversibility of the I3−/I− redox reaction on Pt–SnO2 CE are better.12
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel method to synthesize Pt–SnO2 nanoparticles, where the reduction of Pt4+ and the exfoliation of SnS2 were performed in one step (via treatment with n-BuLi). As a highly efficient CE material for DSCs, the Pt–SnO2 composite exhibits better photovoltaic performance than a conventional Pt electrode. Furthermore, the low Pt content of the Pt–SnO2 composite achieves the objective of low-cost and this design strategy would be very promising to pave the way towards the large-scale commercialization of DSCs.
