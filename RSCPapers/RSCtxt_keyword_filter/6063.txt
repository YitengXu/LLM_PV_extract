    , Accepted 20th May 2013First published on 21st May 2013AbstractHierarchical one-dimensional SnO2 nanofibers (NFs) consisting of nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized and employed as an efficient light scattering layer to fabricate double layered dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The photovoltaic performance (5.44%) of the DSSC based on the SnO2 NPs (14.5 μm)/NFs (4.0 μm) double layered photoanode showed a 26.3% enhancement compared to that of a SnO2 NPs photoanode (18.5μm, 4.30%). Intensity modulation photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) spectroscopy were used to investigate the kinetic process of electron transport and recombination within SnO2 NPs or NPs/NFs based DSSCs, revealing a faster electron transport rate and a lower recombination rate in the SnO2 NPs/NFs photoanode. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results showed that the SnO2 NPs/NFs possess better light scattering ability which enhanced their photovoltaic performance compared to the SnO2 NPs. Furthermore, an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.31% (with a Jsc of 16.78 mA cm−2, Voc of 711 mV and FF of 0.53) was achieved for the SnO2 NPs/NFs double layered photoanode with an additional SnO2 blocking layer, which suppressed electron recombination between the FTO glass and the electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Much attention has been paid to renewable energy due to the limited reserves of non-renewable fossil fuels and serious environmental pollution issues. Solar energy is undoubtedly the most important type of renewable energy because it is a clean and inexhaustible resource. Concerning the photovoltaic application of solar energy, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) reported in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel are regarded as a promising candidate for the new generation of photovoltaics due to their high efficiency and low-cost of materials and production.1,2 Through the development of photoanodes, dyes and electrolytes, power conversion efficiencies in excess of 12% have been achieved.3 Normally, wide band gap semiconductor photoanode materials (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 or Zn2SnO4) play two salient roles in DSSCs: adsorbtion of the sensitizers (dyes, e.g. N719) and transportation of the injected electrons to the external circuit, hence largely influencing the photovoltaic performance. Different morphologies of photoanode materials such as one-dimensional nanostructures,4–9 hierarchical microspheres,10–14 octahedra,15,16 nanosheets,17,18etc, have been widely investigated and found to influence not only the light harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency relating to the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), but also the electron transport and recombination relating to the open-circuit voltage (Voc).
Tin oxide (SnO2) with a wide direct band gap of 3.8 eV at 300 K is a promising photoanode material for use in DSSCs.19–21 SnO2 has a much higher electron mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 S−1)22 compared to that of TiO2 (∼0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 S−1)23 which has been widely synthesized for DSSC applications. Recent reports on SnO2 hollow spheres photoanode based DSSCs showed a photovoltaic performance of 5–6%.24 Our group reported the sonochemical fabrication of hierarchical SnO2 octahedra which exhibited 6–7% photovoltaic performance due to the material’s excellent electron transport properties and superior light scattering ability.15,16 Compared to nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanostructures possess the advantages of fast electron transport rate and excellent light scattering. However, on the other hand they also suffer from their low surface area which results in smaller dye loading and hence leads to a low Jsc. Interestingly, recent investigations of hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays consisting of long TiO2 nanowire trunks and short nanorod branches on flexible Ti foil or transparent FTO glass substrates, have shown significant power conversion efficiency and are attracting immense attention.4,25
To overcome the aforementioned disadvantage of one dimensional structures, we demonstrate a double layered photoanode composed of a SnO2 nanoparticle bottom layer and a nanofiber top layer, which can combine the larger dye loading of the SnO2 nanoparticles and faster electron transport rate, slower electron recombination rate and superior light scattering ability of the SnO2 nanofibers, leading to a remarkable photovoltaic performance of 5.44% which is significantly higher than that of SnO2 nanoparticle based DSSCs (4.30%).
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of SnO2 NPs and SnO2 NFs
SnO2 nanofibers were prepared according to a modified literature procedure:26 in a typical synthesis of SnO2 NFs, 7.0 g oxalic acid (H2C2O4) was dissolved in 75 mL mixed diethylene glycol (DEG) and polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG 400). After 10 min stirring, 2.75 g SnCl2·2H2O was added to this solution, and continuously stirred for an additional 10 min. Afterwards, 25 mL deionized water was added dropwise to this solution, followed by further stirring for another 10 min yielding a white suspension. The resulting precipitate (SnC2O4 nanofiber intermediates) was collected by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 5 min and was then washed 5 times with absolute ethanol and distilled water. In order to obtain hierarchical SnO2 nanofibers, the as-prepared SnC2O4 nanofibers were calcined at 800 °C for 3 h in air. SnO2 nanoparticles (15 nm) were prepared by refluxing a solution containing 5 mmol SnCl2·2H2O in ethanol and deionized water for 12 h with continual stirring.
2.2 Preparation of SnO2 paste
Hierarchical SnO2 NFs or SnO2 NPs (1.0 g) were ground for 40 min in a mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the mixture was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, giving a viscous white SnO2 paste.
2.3 Fabrication of the SnO2 photoanode
The SnO2 NPs paste was screen-printed onto clean FTO glass (15 Ω/square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) with a thickness of 18.5 μm (film I). For the double layered SnO2 NPs/NFs film (II): SnO2 NPs paste was firstly screen-printed onto FTO glass with a thickness of 14.5 μm and then SnO2 NFs paste (4.0 μm in thickness) was screen-printed onto the NPs surface. For comparison, a compact SnO2 blocking layer (∼120 nm in thickness, 5 nm nanoparticles) was spin-coated onto FTO glass before screen-printing the SnO2 NPs/NFs. The SnO2 (∼5 nm) colloidal solution was prepared as follows: SnCl4 (34.2 mL) was added slowly to a solution containing acetylacetone (10.2 mL) and n-butanol (37.6 mL) with stirring. Hydrolysis of the clear mixture was then performed by the dropwise addition of an aqueous acidic solution (3.8 g para-toluene-sulfonic acid in 18.0 mL H2O). Stable transparent SnO2 sol was obtained after heating the mixture at 60 °C for 12 h. The SnO2 photoanode films were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min. Then the SnO2 films were immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min before being sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80 °C, the SnO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.5 mM N719 dye (Ru[LL′–(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4, 4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, Solaronix Co.) in acetonitrile–tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1) for 24 h at room temperature. The Pt-coated FTO glass for use as a counter electrode was prepared by dropping H2PtCl6 (5.0 × 10−4 M) solution on a FTO glass surface followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min in air. The electrolyte consisted of 1-propyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII, 0.6 M), I2 (0.03 M), LiI (0.05 M), Guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS, 0.1 M, Aldrich), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 0.5 M, Aldrich) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). The active area of the dye-coated SnO2 film was ∼0.16 cm2, measured by profilometery (Ambios, XP-1).
2.4 Characterization
The phase purity of the products was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Thermal field emission environment scanning electron microscopy (TFE-SEM, FEI, Quanta 400) was employed to investigate the size and morphology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed on a JEOL-2010 HR transmission electron microscope. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (UV, Shimadzu UV-3150). The thickness of SnO2 films was measured by using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1). The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192, with 1 kW Xe lamp). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL standard Si solar cell. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) characterizations were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under modulated blue light emitting diodes (457 nm) driven by a Zahner (PP211) source supply. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the samples prepared via a room temperature hydrolysis reaction, with tetragonal SnC2O4 (JCPDS Card No. 22-0496) (curve i). After calcination of the as-prepared SnC2O4 samples, all intense diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a, curve ii) are in good agreement with a rutile-like tetragonal structure of SnO2 (JCPDS Card No. 41-1445) with cell constants of a = b = 4.738 Å and c = 3.187 Å. This shows that the SnO2 semiconductor powders are obtained via the oxidization and decomposition of as-prepared SnC2O4 during calcination. The average size of particles was calculated from the highest intensity diffraction peak (110) using the Debye–Scherrer equation (Dhkl = Kλ/(Bhklcosθ), where Dhkl is the crystallite size in the direction perpendicular to the lattice planes, K is a numerical factor frequently referred to as the crystallite-shape factor, hkl are the Miller indices of the planes being analysed, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, Bhkl is the width (full-width at half-maximum) of the X-ray diffraction peak in radians and θ is the Bragg angle.) and was determined to be 30 nm.

(d) TEM images of the SnO2 NFs, insets are the corresponding HRTEM image of NFs (upper) and the FFT image (lower). 
As shown in Fig. 1b, preparing SnC2O4via room temperature hydrolysis gives rise to the formation of nanofibers with diameters of about 250 nm. After the annealing process, they were turned into SnO2 nanofibers with lengths of several micrometers (Fig. 1c). The higher magnification FE-SEM image (inset in Fig. 1c) shows that the surface of the SnO2 NFs is very rough, which is quite different from the smooth surface of the SnC2O4 nanofibers. The TEM image (Fig. 1d) of the SnO2 NFs reveals that the diameter of the nanofibers is about 250 nm and the length is several micrometers, and also that the nanofibers are composed of SnO2 nanoparticles (∼30 nm in size). The HR-TEM image (inset in Fig. 1d, upper) shows that the SnO2 single crystalline nanoparticle (building block of NFs) exhibits clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.473 nm and 0.264 nm, which can be indexed as (010) and (101) planes respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) image (inset in Fig. 1d, lower) also confirms the single crystalline nature of the SnO2 nanoparticles.
In order to investigate the effect of the SnO2 nanofibers on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs, two different photoanode structures with the same thickness were designed, I: SnO2 nanoparticle film with a thickness of 18.5 μm; II: double-layered film with a 14.5 μm SnO2 NPs bottom layer and a 4.0 μm SnO2 NFs top layer. The photoanode consisted of pure SnO2 NFs (18.5 μm), which can be easily broken off from the FTO glass during TiCl4 treatment, as the connectivity between the NFs and the FTO glass was poor, due to the disordered one-dimensional structure of the NFs. Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the SnO2 NPs and SnO2 NPs/NFs double-layered photoanode film. There is no obvious gap between the SnO2 NFs top layer and the nanocrystalline SnO2 active layer, indicating that the connectivity between the NPs and the NFs is quite good, enabling efficient charge transport from SnO2 NFs to NPs.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs based on cell I and II are shown in Fig. 3 and the detailed photovoltaic parameters such as Voc, Jsc, η and FF (fill factor) are summarized in Table 1. It clearly shows that the power conversion efficiency of Cell II (5.44%) exhibited a significant enhancement compared to that of Cell I (4.30%), arising from the improvement of Jsc (from 12.71 to 14.95 mA cm−2) and Voc (from 677 to 702 mV), which can be mainly ascribed to the introduction of a SnO2 nanofiber light scattering layer. The fill factor of the two cells doesn't show any variations since the same electrolyte and counter electrode were used.

The photocurrent density (Jsc) can be calculated from the following equation:27 Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0(1)where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the charge harvesting efficiency of a cell, ηinj is the charge-injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge-collection efficiency, and I0 is light flux. ηinj is assumed to be the same for the two cells under discussion here, because the same dye (N719) is adsorbed onto the same semiconductor material (SnO2). ηlh is commonly determined from both the amount of adsorbed dye and the light-scattering ability of the films. To determine the amount of dye loading in the two different photoanodes, the dye-adsorbed photoanodes were soaked in 3 mL 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and the UV-vis absorption spectra of the desorbed dye represents the amount of dye originally adsorbed onto the photoanode. It was found that the amount of dye adsorbed onto Cell I (15.65 × 10−8 mol cm−2) was higher than that on Cell II (14.33 × 10−8 mol cm−2), owing to the larger specific surface area of the pure SnO2 NPs (with the same thickness ∼18.5 μm) enabling higher dye uptake. On the other hand, the lower photocurrent and power conversion efficiency of Cell I compared to Cell II is attributed to the more efficient light scattering and/or larger ηcc of the latter.
The light scattering ability of a photoanode film can be evaluated by its UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the two photoanodes without dye adsorption. The reflectance of the bare SnO2 NPs film I is lower than that of the double layer SnO2 NFs film II, revealing that the latter has a higher light-scattering ability than the former (Fig. 4). This reveals that the SnO2 NFs can better utilize the incident solar light, hence enhancing the light harvesting efficiency and thus leading to a higher Jsc.
 Fig. 4  Diffuse reflectance spectra of films I and II in the absence of dye. 
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons, is plotted as a function of excitation wavelength. The maximum value at 530 nm is the typical absorption of N719 dye (Fig. 5). The IPCE value of the Cell II is higher than that of Cell I in the measured wavelength range (350–750 nm), indicating a higher light-harvesting ability for the former. This can be attributed to the higher light scattering ability of double layered SnO2 NPs/NFs, which will result in an increased probability of interaction between the photons and the dye molecules, hence improving the light harvesting efficiency.

In addition to ηlh, the charge-collection efficiency (ηcc), which is largely determined by the competition between charge collection and recombination, is also directly related to the Jsc (see eqn (1)). ηcc can be determined from intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements through the following equation:27,28 ηcc = 1 − τd/τr(2)where τd is the electron transport time and τr is the electron recombination time. The time constant of electron transport (τd) is derived from the IMPS data measured under short circuit according to eqn (3): τd = 1/2πfd(3)where fd is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS.

Fig. 6a shows that the τd of the DSSC based on a double layered SnO2 NPs/NFs photoanode is smaller than that of bare SnO2 NPs photoanode, implying that the former has a faster electron transport rate compared to that of the latter, due to the efficient, one dimensional transport path of the NFs. Furthermore, the τd in the present SnO2 based DSSCs is insensitive to light intensity (from 30 to 150 W m−2), indicating that the trap density in these SnO2 anodes is filled even at lower light intensities.29,30
 Fig. 6  Detailed IMPS and IMVS parameters of the two DSSCs based on Cells I and II: (a) Transport, (b) recombination time, (c) charge collection efficiency and (d) effective electron diffusion length. 
The electron recombination time (τr) between the electrons in the conduction band of SnO2 and the I3− anions in the electrolyte can be determined from the IMVS curves measured at open circuit according to the following expression (Fig. 6b): τr = 1/2πfr(4)where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component. The lifetime of Cell II based on a double layered SnO2 NPs/NFs film is longer than that of Cell I with a SnO2 NPs photoanode, which is consistent with the higher Voc of the former. The τr decreases with increasing light intensity which may be a result of the larger recombination probability (since there are more electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor when under higher intensity illumination).
According to Fig. 6a, 6b and eqn (2), one can calculate ηcc as a function of incident light intensity for the two cells based on I and II (Fig. 6c). The DSSC based on Cell II shows a higher ηcc compared to that of Cell I under various light intensities, which can be ascribed to the faster electron transport and longer electron lifetime in the SnO2 NPs/NFs. This enhancement of charge-collection efficiency (ηcc) consequently leads to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency (η).31,32 In these results, the IMPS and IMVS show the enhancement of Jsc, Voc and η for the DSSC based on double layered SnO2 NPs/NFs films, compared to that based on SnO2 NPs.
The recombination mechanism of DSSCs based on Cell I and II was further investigated by open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. OCVD analysis can reveal the electron recombination kinetics of DSSCs. After the light is switched off with a shutter under a steady voltage, the Voc decays due to the electron recombination with the I3− in the electrolyte, which relates to the electron lifetime. Fig. 7a is a plot of the Voc decay as a function of time, measured for the two DSSCs based on Cell I and II. It is clear that the DSSC based on Cell II has a slower Voc decay rate than that of Cell I, suggesting slower recombination kinetics and a longer electron lifetime in Cell II. This is consistent with the IMVS results. The slower electron recombination kinetics indicate that more electrons survive from the reverse reaction, which is conducive to enhancement of the Voc and Jsc. The lifetime of photogenerated electrons (τn), can be calculated by the following expression:33,34 τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1(5)where kB = 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1 is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Fig. 7b shows the calculated τn as a function of Voc for Cell I and Cell II. It is observed that the τn of the Cell II anode is longer than that of Cell I, indicating a slower electron recombination rate in the double layered photoanode compared to in SnO2 NPs based DSSCs.

The introduction of a TiO2 blocking layer has been proved to effectively reduce charge recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface, hence improving the photocurrent density, photovoltage and power conversion efficiency.35 In the present SnO2 photoanode based DSSCs, a SnO2 blocking layer (∼120 nm in thickness consisting of ∼5 nm SnO2 nanoparticles) was deposited between FTO glass and SnO2 films by spin coating (see experimental section). As a result of the incorporation of this SnO2 blocking layer, a significant enhancement (16%) of the power conversion efficiency (6.31%) for the SnO2 NPs/NFs double layered photoanode is achieved with Jsc of 16.78 mA cm−2, Voc of 711 mV and FF of 0.529, and the IPCE value obtained from the SnO2 NPs/NFs double layered electrode is 80.1% (at 530 nm) as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 8. The present highly efficient photovoltaic performance of the SnO2 NPs/NFs double layered photoanode based DSSCs can be ascribed to the following several factors: 1) SnO2 NFs serve as a light-scattering layer to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency; 2) SnO2 NFs provide a direct linear path for the rapid transport and collection of electrons generated throughout the device; 3) The SnO2 nanoparticles in the SnO2 NFs are of a larger size, highly crystalline and more compact, which minimizes the grain boundaries in the scattering layer, hence reducing charge recombination; 4) The introduction of a SnO2 blocking layer effectively reduces charge recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface and hence improves the power conversion efficiency.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated hierarchical SnO2 nanofibers with diameter of ∼250 nm and length of 5–10 μm, which consisted of ∼30 nm SnO2 nanoparticles. The SnO2 NFs have been demonstrated to be an excellent light scattering layer in DSSCs. The DSSC based on SnO2 NPs (15 nm in particle size and 14.5 μm in thickness)/SnO2 NFs (4.0 μm in thickness) double layered photoanode showed a superior photovoltaic performance of 5.44% compared to that based on a 18.5 μm SnO2 NPs (4.3%) film, which can be mainly ascribed to the faster electron transport rate, slower recombination rate and better light scattering ability of the introduced SnO2 NFs layer. These results were confirmed by IMPS, IMVS, OCVD and UV-vis diffuse reflectance studies. In addition, the introduction of a SnO2 compact layer between the SnO2 film and FTO glass remarkably enhanced the power conversion efficiency by suppressing the recombination reaction between electrons in the FTO glass and I3− anions in the electrolyte, which lead to a maximum efficiency of 6.31%.
