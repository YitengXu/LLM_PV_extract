    , Accepted 15th August 2014First published on 15th August 2014AbstractWe report on the synthesis, and photovoltaic performances of four novel Ru(II)-bipyridine heteroleptic complexes TT206–209, incorporating branched and bulkier alkyl chains compared to their linear analogues C106 and CYC-B11 previously reported. In both series, we found that dyes containing 2-methyl-hex-2-yl substitution gave better performances than 1,1-dipropylbutyl. The best overall performance over the four dyes was obtained for TT207 (CYC-B11 analogue), which contains 2-methylhex-2-yl type substitution, achieving an overall PCE of 8.5%. Furthermore, the optimization of TT207/DSSCs, with respect to the dye-uptake solvent and electrolyte composition, led to a maximum PCE of 9.1% under AM1.5 G standard conditions.
1. Introduction
Until recently, sensitizers based on Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, such as N3 or N719, had maintained a clear leadership in DSSC since 1993 in terms of solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (PCE), with validated PCE over 11% under AM1.5 G standard conditions.1 Some ruthenium-free sensitizers based on Zn(II)-porphyrin have equalled these performances between 2010–2011,2,3 and even surpassed them recently with PCE over 13%.4,5 Nonetheless, these kinds of sensitizers remain the focus of intense study and efficient sensitizers in DSSCs,6,7 although environmental and economic considerations due to ruthenium metal undoubtedly stand out as the most important issues in their possible use in commercial modules. Some of their inherent advantages6 are their high quantum yield of electron-injection from the MLCT excited state of the dye into the TiO2 conduction band (CB), slow back electron transfer (BET), wide absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum up to 700–800 nm, adequate location of their HOMO–LUMO levels with respect to the TiO2-CB and the redox shuttle in the electrolyte, long-lived excited states, and excellent photochemical stability. Two main important factors have limited further improvements of the performances of these kinds of sensitizers in DSSC: (1) dye-aggregation issues and (2) rather low molar extinction coefficients of absorption. A common strategy to improve the performances of Ru(II)-sensitizers consists of using heteroleptic complex modified analogues of N3 or N719, which in their molecular structure one ancillary group beneficial to the dye, and maintain one 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, acting as an anchoring group that is needed to attach efficiently the dye on the metal oxide surface.8,9 Incorporation of alkyl chains in the ancillary group, for instance nonyl chains (n-C9H18) in Z907 dye, or bulky hydrophobic groups,10,11 has proved to be an efficient strategy to improve the performances of a DSSC cell in comparison with the N3 analogue. These amphiphilic heteroleptic analogues display several advantages compared to the N3 complex:12 (1) they help to reduce dye-aggregation, (2) the hydrophobic groups avoid intrusion of water in the operating device, which improves significantly the long-term durability of the device, (3) they enhance the binding strength of the complex onto the TiO2 surface, (4) the decreased charge on the sensitizer attenuates the electrostatic repulsion, which can result in higher dye-loading, and (5) these complexes usually display lower oxidation potential compared to that of the N3 sensitizer, which increases the reversibility of the Ru(III/II) couple,13 and hence also enhances the stability of the dye. On the other hand, incorporation of electron-rich π-systems at one bipyridine moiety (most usually at the ancillary group),8 such as (poly)thiophene,14–17 furanyl,18 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT),19,20 styryl,21–24 (oligo)phenylenevinylene,25 carbazole,26 or (vinyl)triphenylamine,27–29 helps the Ru(II)-dye to absorb sunlight over a wider range and with stronger absorption. In parallel, recent efforts have been also devoted to develop alternative thiocyanate-free ruthenium(II) sensitizers to improve long term stability of DSSCs (in a few cases, accompanied with improved photovoltaic performances), because the monodentate thiocyanate ligands are believed to be the weakest parts of RuLL′(NCS)2-type complexes.30–32
In our previous work,33 we demonstrated that incorporation of bulky groups in the molecular structure of a Ru(II) dye can prevent aggregation, resulting in high photocurrents even in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid, but can lead to lower cell voltages due to possible inefficient dye packing. Moreover, it is also known that bulky groups can help to reduce the recombination rate between injected TiO2 electrons and the redox shuttle present in the electrolyte, by forming a blocking layer between them.34 In this work, we report on the syntheses of four new heteroleptic complex analogues of C10635 or CYC-B11,36 the dyes TT206–209 (Chart 1), which contain branched and bulky substitutions. These sensitizers have been tested in TiO2-DSSC, and their photovoltaic performances compared in each series.

2. Experimental section
(a) Materials
Synthetic procedures were carried out under an inert argon atmosphere, using dry solvents unless otherwise noted. All dry solvents (anhydrous grade) were purchased at SDS, used without purification, dried over molecular sieves (3 Å), and flushed under an argon atmosphere, prior to use. THF was freshly distilled from sodium benzophenoneketyl prior to use. All reagents were reagent grade and used as received without further purification unless otherwise specified. 2,2′-Bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (dcapy), dichloro(p-cymene)-ruthenium(II) dimer ([Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2) were purchased at TCI and ammonium thiocyanate(NH4NCS) at Aldrich. Chromatographic purifications were performed using silica gel 60 SDS (particle size 0.040–0.063 mm) or GE Healthcare Sephadex® LH-20. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed using Merck TLC silica gel 60 F254. MS experiments were performed by the Servicio Interdepartamental de Investigación (SIdI) at the Autonoma University of Madrid. FAB (matrix: m-NBA) and EI-TOF MS/HRMS spectra were recorded on a VG AutoSpec instrument. MALDI-TOF MS/HRMS spectra (matrix: dithranol) were recorded on a Bruker Reflex III spectrometer with a laser beam operating at 337 nm. Poly(ethyleneglycol)-1000 (PEGH) was used as an internal calibration reference for HRMS MALDI-TOF spectra. 1H (300 MHz) and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-300 equipment, and the chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm relative to the residual solvent peak of the deuterated solvent, and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-660 instrument.

General procedure for the synthesis of heteroleptic complexes TT206–209. 
In a sealed tube-flask (closed vessel), a stirred solution of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 dimer (0.6 eq.) and bipyridine ligand 5, 6, 7 or 8 (1 eq.) in dry DMF (9 mL) was heated under MW irradiation at 70 °C for 20–25 min. Then, a solution of 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (1.2 eq.) in DMF (3 mL) was added, and the solution irradiated under MW at 135–150 °C for an additional 20 min. After cooling, a solution of NH4SCN (25 eq.) in DMF (3 mL), was added to the mixture, and irradiated again under MW at 135–150 °C for 30–40 min. After cooling, DMF was removed from the flask by high-vacuum distillation. The remaining pasty solid was triturated in Et2O (10 mL), and the resulting suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with Et2O (2 × 10 mL). The remaining solid was air-dried, dissolved in basic MeOH (NaOH) and subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex™ (MeOH). The main band was collected, and the solvent evaporated to dryness, to afford the desired complex in the disodium salt form. This salt was redissolved in MeOH, and the resulting solution acidified by addition of a 10−2 M solution of HNO3 in MeOH (0.5 eq. of HNO3 per eq. of complex) to afford the complex in the mono sodium salt form.

(c) Device fabrication
NSG10 (purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass company, Japan) FTO glass was washed in water and ethanol, followed by 30 min of ultrasonic cleaning in Deconnex™ solution. The TCO was then thermally treated at 520 °C for 30 min to remove organic contaminants on the surface. The cleaned substrate was chemically treated in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 75 °C, to form a TiO2 underlayer. After this step, the nano crystalline TiO2 (30 NRDT, Dyesol) films were prepared by a screen printing technique, followed by a series of sintering steps (325 °C for 5 min with 15 min ramp time, 375 °C for 5 min with 5 min ramp time, 450 °C for 15 min with 5 min ramp time, and 500 °C for 15 min with 5 min ramp time). Another TiCl4 treatment was done following the procedure similar to the underlayer preparation. The films were further heated at 500 °C for 30 min to remove the surface contaminants before dipping them in the dye solution. The sensitization was carried out for 14 hours at 25 °C in the dark and washed in acetonitrile to remove the loosely bound dye molecules before the cell assembly. For the counter electrode, Pt coated TEC7 FTO (purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland) was used, and the Pt deposition was achieved by thermal decomposition at 410 °C for 20 min of a 2 mM H2PtCl6 ethanolic solution drop casted on the FTO glass. The two electrodes were melt sealed using a 25 μm-thick Surlyn™ polymer film. Two different electrolytes were used in this study, coded as Z960 and Z984. Composition of electrolytes: (i) for Z960: 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl-imidazoliumiodide (DMII) [1 M], LiI [50 mM], I2 [30 mM], guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) [0.1 M], and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) [0.5 M], in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v); (ii) for Z984: DMII [0.6 M], LiI [50 mM], I2 [30 mM], GuNCS [0.1 M], and TBP [0.5 M], in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). The electrolyte was injected by a vacuum back filling technique through a hole sand blasted at the side of the counter electrode.
(d) Photovoltaic characterization procedures
The photovoltaic measurements were carried out using a 450 W xenon light source (Osram XBO 450, Germany) with a filter (Schott 113), whose power was regulated to the AM1.5 G solar standard by using a reference Si photodiode equipped with a colour matched filter (KG-3, Schott) in order to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM1.5 G to less than 4%. The devices were measured with a mask of area 0.159 cm2. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley™ 2400 digital source meter. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was plotted as a function of wavelength by using the light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA), which was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) onto the photovoltaic cell under testing. A computer controlled monochromator was incremented through the spectral range (300–900 nm) to generate a photocurrent action spectrum with a sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 4 s. In addition, photocurrent and continuous irradiated light intensity were measured simultaneously at each wavelength.
3. Results and discussion
(a) Synthesis
The synthesis of Ru(II)-dyes TT206–209 is depicted in Scheme 1. The first step involved an S-alkylation of 2-thiophenethiol with either 2-methyl-2-hexanol or 4-propyl-4-heptanol under BF3-catalysed acidic conditions to afford compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding stannyl derivatives of 1 and 2 were prepared by a one-pot reaction involving regioselective lithiation/deprotonation at the α-position of thiophene derivatives with nBuLi in THF at low temperature, followed by subsequent reaction with SnBu3Cl. Next, Pd-catalysed Stille cross-coupling with 2-bromothiophene in refluxing DMF afforded oligomer, dithiophene compounds 3 and 4.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of bipyridine ligands 5–8 and Ru(II) complexes TT206–TT209. Reagents and conditions: (i) BF3·OEt2, CH2Cl2, 2-methyl-2-hexanol (for 1) or 4-propyl-4-heptanol (for 2), -10 °C, 2 h (1: 62%, 2: 55%); (ii) n-butyllithium, THF, −78 °C (30 min) to RT (1.5 h) then SnBu3Cl, THF, −78 °C (30 min) to RT overnight (quantitative); (iii) 2-bromothiophene, DMF reflux, 24 h (3: 52%, 4: 65%); (iv) 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine, Pd(PPh3)4, DMF reflux, 48 h (5: 54%; 6: 53%, 7: 47%, 8: 48%); (v) [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, MW, 70 °C, 20–25 min, followed by (vi) 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, DMF, MW 135–150 °C, 20 min, and (vii) NH4NCS, DMF, MW 135–150 °C, 30–40 min (TT206: 83%, TT207: 56%, TT208: 82%, TT209: 48%). 
By following the same reaction sequence as for 1 and 2, the corresponding stannyl derivatives of 3 and 4 were obtained by treatment with nBuLi followed by reaction with SnBu3Cl. The stannyl derivatives of 1–4 were then subjected to a Pd-catalysed Stille cross-coupling with 4,4-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine in refluxing DMF to afford the corresponding functionalized bipyridine ligands 5–8. Finally, the Ru(II) complexes TT206–209 were prepared in a one-pot, three-step reaction under microwave-assisted standard procedures previously reported in the literature.37 All compounds were characterized by NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and MS and HRMS spectrometry (copies of spectra are provided in the ESI†).
(b) UV-Vis absorption spectra
The UV-Vis spectra of the four dyes TT206–209 in DMF solutions are depicted in Fig. 1, and the absorption data is summarized in Table 1. Three to four distinct bands at around 300–310 nm, 340–450 nm and 550 nm can be observed for all complexes. For TT206/208, two distinct bands can be seen in the UV region: the first one at around 300–310 nm was assigned to ligand-centered charge-transfer (LCCT) transitions (π–π*) of the bipyridine moieties, and the second one at around 340 nm to the intraligand charge-transfer (ILCT) transition (π–π*) of the ancillary ligand; the two other absorption bands of lower energies in the visible region at around 420 and 550 nm, were ascribed to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions (4d–π*), characteristic of ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes. In the case of TT207 and TT209, the broad and intense absorption band centred at around 400 nm, should contain the overlap of two components: the ILCT transition with major contribution, and the first MLCT transition (MLCT(1)) with minor contribution. The increase in both the electron donating ability and π-extended conjugation over the bipyridyl ancillary ligand from thiophene (TT206 and TT208) to dithiophene groups (TT207 and TT209) can be seen over this second absorption band: this antenna effect produced significant redshift and broadening, accompanied by stronger molar extinction coefficients for the former group. Regarding the lowest energy transition band (MLCT(2)), no significant variations were observed in the two series, and are in the range of values previously reported for the benchmark C106 and CYCB11 dyes (MLCT(2) at 550 nm and 554 nm, respectively). With the exception of TT206, which did not display a very well-defined maximum (quite broad) for the MLCT(2) band, all other dyes display a redshift of 16–18 nm of this band in comparison with the homoleptic dye N719,38 as expected for such heteroleptic Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes.

The photovoltaic performances of the TT-sensitized DSSCs were tested under simulated AM1.5 G Illumination (power 100 mW cm−2), using our standard electrolyte (Z960) containing the iodine/triiodine couple as redox shuttle. These data are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 2 depicts the IPCE action spectra for each DSSC. The IPCE values reached 40%–80% in the 400–700 nm region for the four cells, with maximum values at around ∼550 nm, which correspond to the maximum of absorption of the second MLCT band.

Because of dye-aggregation issues, the IPCE values did not match perfectly with their relative short circuit current density values (JSC). The type of substitution, 2-methylhex-2-yl (Type I) or 1,1-dipropylbutyl (Type II), follows the same trends in each series. First, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is almost unchanged regardless of the type of substitution: VOC = 632.5 mV and 629 mV, for TT206 and TT208 (C106 analogues), respectively, and VOC = 666.5 mV and 668.9 mV, for TT207 and TT209 (CYC-B11 analogues), respectively. The main difference comes from the much larger JSC for type I than for type II, which mostly accounts for their superior overall PCE. Now, if we compare dyes with the same type of substitution, the same trends can be observed: lower fill factor for CYC-B11 analogues than for C106 ones, but which is overcompensated for by larger VOC and JSC, and accordingly this results in higher PCE. The extension and redshift of absorption in CYC-B11 analogues caused by the presence of the dithiophene moieties must confer to these dyes a better light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with their C106 analogues, which explain well the larger JSC of these cells. Moreover, the significantly greater VOC achieved by CYC-B11 analogues than by C106 ones (ΔVOC = +34–40 mV), suggests reduced recombination rates at the TiO2–electrolyte interface between oxidized I3− ions and injected electrons. We assume that the bulky groups located at farther distances from the TiO2 surface in CYC-B11 analogues should act as a more efficient blocking layer than in C106 ones to prevent the penetration of oxidized species to the TiO2 surface. The best performing dye of the series, TT207, was further optimized with respect to dye-uptake solvent and electrolyte composition (Table 3). The highest PCE of DSSC devices made with TT207 dye was obtained when using γ-butyrolactone (GBL) as the dye-uptake solvent and Z984 as the electrolyte. In comparison with our standard conditions (DMF/Z960), the fill factor was slightly decreased, but overcompensated by increases in both JSC and VOC, thus resulting in an improved overall PCE of 9.1%.

4. Conclusion
The photovoltaic performances of four novel ruthenium dyes TT206–209, analogues of C106 or CYC-B11 sensitizers, have been tested in DSSC. Two types of branched alkyl chains, either 2-methylhex-2-yl (Type I) or 1,1-dipropylbutyl (Type II), have been used to design these dyes, and their performances in DSSC were compared in both series. The 2-methylhex-2-yl substitution pattern was found more efficient in both C106 and CYC-B11 series, which provides some guidelines for designing Ru-(II)bipyridine dyes for DSSCs. The dye TT207 that possesses extended and redshifted absorption caused by dithiophene moieties in the ancillary group (CYC-B11 analogue), and 2-methylhex-2-yl type substitution (Type I), logically achieved the highest PCE of the series (η = 8.5%). Furthermore, the optimization of TT207/DSSCs, with respect to the dye-uptake solvent and electrolyte composition, led to a PCE of 9.1% under AM1.5 G standard conditions.
