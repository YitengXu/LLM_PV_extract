    , Accepted 30th October 2014First published on 30th October 2014AbstractAlthough Cl-doping is a common technique for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance, the Cl content is negligibly small and cannot easily be tuned. Therefore, we herein study the formation chemistry of Cl-doped perovskites by examining the chemical interactions between thermally evaporated MAI and PbCl2 through X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). We show that PbCl2 is not stable at the MAI/PbCl2 contact surface. The Cl atom readily detaches from the PbCl2, which subsequently initiates electron transition from Pb to MAI. Via thermal-evaporation, a perovskite with a high PbCl2 content can be prepared and examined. We found that the presence of metallic Pb, associated with increased Cl content, can quench the photogenerated exciton in PV devices. By optimizing the ratio of MAI:PbCl2, a perovskite solar cell with ∼6% efficiency was obtained.
Introduction
Organolead halide perovskites have recently emerged as a new revolutionary light absorber for photovoltaic (PV) devices.1–3 Despite continuous breakthroughs in power conversion efficiencies, fundamental understanding of perovskite solar cells is limited.3,4 Recent studies showed that the perovskite device performances are dominated by the intrinsic properties of the perovskite layer.5–7 It is thus important to control and custom tune the properties of perovskites.8–10
Methylammonium (MA is the abbreviation for CH3NH3) lead iodide (MAPbI3) is a typical perovskite for photon harvesting. Fully or partially replacing iodine in this model structure with other halide atoms (e.g. boride/chloride, and iodide/chloride) can open the band gap from 1.57 to 2.29 eV.11,12 Perovskites with a mixed halide content of iodide/chloride (MAPbI3−xClx) are reported to show good PV performance even in devices using a simple planar structure.13–16 PV devices consisting of MAPbI3−xClx show remarkably high open circuit voltages8 and extraordinary long charge transport distances of over 1 μm.11,17 These impressive findings aroused recent interest in the Cl-doped perovskites.18,19
Since then, there have been attempts to increase the Cl-content by increasing the ratio of PbCl2/MAI in the precursor solution.18 However, the Cl content is still negligibly small19,20 and the ratio of Cl/I in the resulting perovskite films is difficult to tune. Despite the large amount of recent publications on MAPbI3−xClx based PV devices, there are relatively few studies on its chemical structure, mechanism of formation and charge transport.11,21–23 Herein, we perform a surface analysis-based study of the formation chemistry of MAPbI3−xClx by investigating the charge interaction between MAI and PbCl2. The implications of the MAI:PbCl2 ratio in the precursor solution on the charge transport properties of MAPbI3−xClx are discussed.
Experimental
Photoemission studies
All photoemission analyses were performed using a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL surface analysis system equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray gun giving photons of 1486.6 eV for XPS investigation.24 The base pressure of the system is 10−9 Torr. The evaporation source of MAI (from Luminescence Technology Corp.) and the PbCl2 (from Sigma Aldrich) were used as-received. A bilayer film of MAI/PbCl2 is in situ deposited on an ITO glass substrate by thermal evaporation; while mixed films of MAI:PbCl2 are prepared by co-evaporation from PbCl2 and MAI. The formed films are then transferred to a preparation chamber where they are annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour without vacuum break. The prepared films are finally transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurements. XPS core level spectra of Pb 4f (signal from PbCl2) and I 3d (signal from MAI) show spin–orbit splitting. Their peaks are fitted according to a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape along with a Shirley background. The pairs of Pb (i.e. Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2) and I (i.e. I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2) peaks are fitted with a constrained intensity ratio of 4:3 and 2:3, respectively.
Device fabrication
The patterned and routinely cleaned indium–tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrate is ultraviolet–ozone treated for 15 min. Perovskite-based solar cells with a configuration of ITO/perovskite (MAI:PbCl2 ratio ∼0.5:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, 2.3:1 and 4:1, 150 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BPhen (8 nm)/Al (80 nm) are fabricated. The MAI (from Lumtech.) and PbCl2 (from Sigma Aldrich) are used as-received. The perovskite films are prepared by co-evaporation of PbCl2 and MAI onto ITO coated glass substrates, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, the organic layers are deposited. The Al cathode (80 nm) is deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. All of the film thicknesses are monitored using an INFICON crystal monitor with the thickness calibrated using an ellipsometer. The active device area is 0.1 cm2. The devices are encapsulated in a glove box immediately after fabrication without ambient exposure. More details of the device fabrication can be found in the ESI.†25 The performances of the devices are measured using an Oriel 150 W solar simulator with AM1.5G (AM: air mass, G: global) filters at 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Formation chemistry of the perovskites at the atomic level
To examine the chemical interaction between MAI and PbCl2, we performed a surface study of the MAI/PbCl2 interface using XPS. Simple bilayer films of MAI/PbCl2 are thermally evaporated onto an ITO substrate for examination. Chemical changes and electronic interactions are monitored at each incremental film deposition.

Fig. 1a shows the XPS Cl 2p core level spectra of PbCl2 on an ITO/MAI (15 nm) substrate with increasing thickness. It is intriguing that no Cl signal can be measured during the initial deposition (0.2 to 0.5 nm) of PbCl2 on the MAI surface, taking into account the detection limit of the XPS measurement (∼±0.1 atm%).9 The Cl signal is only observed after the coverage of the PbCl2 film reaches over 1.0 nm thick. Fig. 1b shows the Cl content near the MAI/PbCl2 surface. The Cl:Pb ratio gradually increases from 0 to 1.4 as the PbCl2 spreads away from the MAI surface.
 Fig. 1  (a) The XPS Cl 2p core level spectra with increasing PbCl2 thickness on an ITO/MAI (15.0 nm) substrate. (b) The atomic ratio of Cl/Pb from different thicknesses of PbCl2 deposited on ITO/MAI and ITO surfaces. 
We repeat the experiment, replacing the ITO/MAI (15 nm) substrate with a bare ITO substrate. The deposited PbCl2 film shows a stoichiometric Cl:Pb ratio of ∼2 even at a thickness as thin as 0.2 nm. Fig. S1† compares the Pb 4f and Cl 2p XPS core level spectra of PbCl2 films prepared on ITO/MAI and ITO substrates. While PbCl2 deposited on bare ITO shows a strong Cl signal, the same film prepared on the ITO/MAI substrate shows a negligible Cl signal (lower line, Fig. S1b†). This suggests that no Cl loss occurs during thermal evaporation of the PbCl2 source. The absence of Cl in Fig. 1 is therefore attributed to interactions between PbCl2 and MAI. This observation is consistent with the theoretical calculation by Colella et al. The structural mismatch due to the abrupt difference in the ionic radii of Cl− and I− ions hinders the incorporation of Cl− ions in the network of MAPbI3 perovskites.18 Although Cl is energetically unfavorable to be formed at the MAI/PbCl2 surface, it can sit as an inclusion somewhere >1.0 nm away from MAI/PbCl2 surface as shown in Fig. 1b.
We continue our discussion on the structural chemistry of perovskites by examining the core level XPS spectra of different elements at the MAI/PbCl2 contact surface. Fig. 2a compares the Pb 4f core level spectra for 0.2 and 10.0 nm PbCl2 deposited on an ITO/MAI (15.0 nm) substrate (bottom line). When 0.2 nm of PbCl2 is deposited on the MAI surface, the Pb 4f7/2 and the Pb 4f5/2 peaks are observed at 143.1 and 138.2 eV, respectively. Their positions shifted by 0.9 eV, towards the high binding energy (BE) side, when the PbCl2 thickness was increased to 10 nm. Similar peak shifts in Fig. 2b are observed for the I 3d core level peaks, for which the signals come from the underlying MAI film. The 15.0 nm MAI shows I 3d7/2 and I 3d5/2 peaks at 619.01 and 630.41 eV, respectively. These peaks progressively shift by 0.8 eV, to the high BE side, upon depositing 10.0 nm of PbCl2. Both XPS core level peak shifts for the Pb 4f (signal from PbCl2) and I 3d (signal from MAI) suggest a strong interfacial charge transfer at the MAI/PbCl2 contact surface. Neither the Pb 4f nor the I 3d spectra show any new peaks, indicating there is no new chemical bond formation.26 On the other hand, it is interesting to note that both C 1s and N 1s show negligible shifts (Fig. 2c and d). Pristine MAI shows C 1s peaks with two C 1s peaks located at 284.4 and 286.3 eV, from C–C and C–N bonds respectively. Although both of the two C 1s peaks show no energy shift, their intensity ratio changes obviously upon the PbCl2 deposition. Some of the C–N bonds change to C–C bonds during the contact of PbCl2 with MAI.19

Fig. 3 summarizes the net energy shift of the core level signals from both MAI (red) and PbCl2 (blue) during the MAI/PbCl2 interface formation. This figure depicts the chemical response of the different elements during the MAI/PbCl2 contact formation. Pb and I are the only elements showing a vigorous shift and chemical response during the MAI/PbCl2 contact formation. Fig. 4 schematically illustrates the structural formation of the perovskites and the electron transfer that occurs when PbCl2 meets MAI. When PbCl2 is in contact with MAI molecules, the Cl atoms will detach from the Pb atom due to a lattice mismatch with the I atom.18 The Pb, with excess valence electrons, would then subsequently pass its electrons to the I in MAI. During the electron transfer process, the Pb atom retains its oxidation state of 2+ with no sign of further oxidization or reduction, as no new peaks emerged in the Pb 4f spectra (Fig. 2a).26 Meanwhile, after getting an additional electron from Pb, the charge balance in the MAI is regained by the breaking of some of its C–N bonds, and the formation of C–C bonds (or C species).

Although the interfacial surface studies of the MAI/PbCl2 bilayer film (Fig. 2) can disclose the detailed formation chemistry of the perovskite film, it might not totally reflect the charge interactions in a mixed MAI:PbCl2 film after annealing at 100 °C. We therefore also examined the chemical structure of a mixed MAI:PbCl2 (3:1) film before and after annealing at 100 °C for 1 hour. The XPS results are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The XPS spectra of the MAI:PbCl2 mixed films are similar to those for the MAI/PbCl2 bilayer contact (Fig. 2). Most importantly, no Cl signal can be detected even when the MAI:PbCl2 mixed film is thick (15 nm). This indicates that the mixed film and the bilayer share similar chemistry, and also that the 100 °C annealing has no observable effect on the chemical bond structure.22
Impact of increasing the PbCl2 precursor content
We found that the Cl content in the thermally prepared perovskite film can be more easily tuned compared to that from solution processing.27Fig. 5a shows the Cl 2p signals from annealed MAI:PbCl2 (i.e. perovskite) films with different MAI:PbCl2 ratios. Fig. 5b compares the Pb 4f core level spectra of the perovskites films with MAI:PbCl2 ratios of ∼1:1, ∼2:1 and ∼3:1. In these perovskite samples, the signals due to the main pair of peaks for Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 are found at ∼138.7 and 143.5 eV, respectively. This corresponds to Pb atoms with oxidation states of +2. In the film prepared with a high PbCl2:MAI ratio of ∼1:1, an additional pair of Pb peaks emerges at 136.9 (Pb 4f7/2) and 141.8 eV (Pb 4f5/2). These peaks are attributed to a Pb atom with an oxidation state of 0, suggesting that a small amount of Pb2+ is reduced to Pb metal. This observation matches well with the theoretical simulation reported by Miller et al.28
 Fig. 5  XPS core level spectra for the (a) Cl 2p and (b) Pb 4f of the perovskite films with MAI:PbCl2 ratios of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. 
In order to study the effect of increasing the Cl content in perovskites, perovskite-based solar cells with a configuration of ITO/perovskite 150 nm (MAI:PbCl2 ratios 0.5:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, 2.3:1, 4:1)/C60 40 nm/BPhen 8 nm/Al were fabricated. Fig. 6 shows an XRD pattern (top line) of a perovskite film deposited on an ITO substrate. The pattern shows diffraction peaks at 14°, 28°, and 43° that correspond respectively to the (110), (220), and (330) plane of perovskite.4 It is noted that neither MAI nor PbCl2 signals can be detected in the perovskite film. In addition, our XPS data show that no detectable contamination occurred during our fabrication process. The perovskite film shows a characteristic photoluminescence (PL) emission at 780 nm (Fig. S3†). It is noted that the major PL emission at 780 nm is decreased with increasing doping ratio. Also, a blue shift in the PL emission peak is found on increasing the PbCl2 content. This is a common sign of undesirable impurities (i.e. excess Pb metal), which form a new radiation pathway for the film.29 All these characterization data show that the thermally evaporated perovskite film has the same crystal structure, PL emission and absorption as reported by other groups.4,13

(d) The relationship between Voc and the dark current density for the corresponding devices. 

Fig. 6b compares the conductivities of the perovskite devices with different MAI:PbCl2 ratios. When the MAI:PbCl2 ratio changes from ∼1:1 to ∼4:1, the dark current of the formed devices increases by two orders of magnitude. When the PbCl2 content is further increased (i.e. a MAI:PbCl2 ratio of 0.5:1), the device shows a large leakage current with no diode behavior. The corresponding J–V characteristics under illumination are shown in Fig. 6c. It is noted that the device with a MAI:PbCl2 ratio of 2.3:1 shows the best performance with a PCE up to 6.1%. The detailed photoresponses and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the formed devices are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S4,† respectively. Fig. 6d shows the relationship between Voc and the dark current (obtained at −1 V for the Fig. 6b). When the MAI:PbCl2 ratio changes from 4:1 to 1:1, the device’s Voc is found to decrease with an increasing dark current. This observation is consistent with the theoretical calculation using the diode equation, which shows that the dark current is inversely proportional to the Voc.

Although a perovskite film with a higher PbCl2 content can show better conductivity, an excessive PbCl2 content can degrade the PV performance. The formation of metallic Pb could quench the photocurrent in the device by providing charge recombination sites, leading to a high dark current (Fig. 6b) and poor PV device performance (Fig. 6c). It is noted that the morphology may affect the device performance. We thus also examined the surface morphologies of the perovskite films with MAI:PbCl2 ratios of 2.3:1 and 1:1 using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The two perovskite films with MAI:PbCl2 ratios of 2.3:1 and 1:1 show a similar morphology with a root-mean-square (R.M.S.) roughness of ∼1 nm (Fig. S5 and S6†). No further morphology differences were observed when C60/BCP was deposited (Fig. S6†). Both the AFM and SEM results suggested that the doping process has no significant impact on the film morphology. The notable large leakage current in Fig. 6d is not attributed to any morphological issue (e.g. valley or protrusion), but to the increased PbCl2 content. By optimizing the MAI:PbCl2 ratio, an OPV device with an energy conversion efficiency of 6% was obtained.
Conclusion
The formation chemistry of a MAPbI3−xClx perovskite from its precursor materials, MAI and PbCl2, was examined using XPS. Due to the differences in ionic radii of Cl− and I− ions, the Cl leaves the Pb atom when PbCl2 meets with the MAI molecules. The Pb transfers its excess electrons to the MAI during the MAI/PbCl2 contact formation. As a result, a negligible amount of Cl could be observed close to the MAI/PbCl2 contact surface. By controlling the thermal co-evaporation ratio of the MAI and PbCl2, the PV effect of perovskites with a high PbCl2 content was also examined. The excess Pb ions, accompanied with an increasing Cl content, would lead to partial reduction of the Pb ions to Pb metal. The metallic Pb is considered as the cause of the reduced PV performance in some perovskite films prepared with a high content of PbCl2.
