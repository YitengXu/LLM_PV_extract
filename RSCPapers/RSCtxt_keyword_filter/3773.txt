    , Accepted 19th May 2016First published on 6th June 2016AbstractIn the on-going quest to harvest near-infrared (NIR) photons for energy conversion applications, a novel family of neutral ruthenium(II) sensitizers has been developed by cyclometalation of an azadipyrromethene chromophore. These rare examples of neutral ruthenium complexes based on polypyridine ligands exhibit an impressive panchromaticity achieved by the cyclometalation strategy, with strong light absorption in the 600–800 nm range that tails beyond 1100 nm in the terpyridine-based adducts.

Introduction
A world powered exclusively by renewable sources is an attainable goal over the course of the 21st century and constitutes one of the main challenges for humankind.1,2 To reach such an ambitious ideal, solar energy represents one of the most meaningful alternatives to consider in order to finally replace fossil fuels as our principal energy source. Nature's photosynthetic systems found in plants and microorganisms symbolize an unlimited source of inspiration for the scientific community working on solar energy conversion, continuously revealing crucial secrets.3,4 From Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) to artificial leaves, the optoelectronic devices developed so far have all integrated elements, functions or principles observed in photosystem II (PSII).5,6 Among the best example of ideas gleaned from nature, the use of push–pull neutral metalloporphyrins co-sensitized with organic chromophores has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 13% in DSSCs due to greater panchromaticity.7–9 Significant PCE improvements have also been achieved in Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) devices by extending the absorption of photons toward the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region.10–13 The quest for materials that absorb in the NIR resides in the fact that ca. 50% of the total solar radiation intensity hitting Earth's surface is in the range of 700 to 2000 nm, with core part of the flux centered between 600 to 800 nm.10,14 It is, therefore, not surprising that PSII efficiently absorbs light up to about 800 nm.15
Among the best chromophores to reach the red-to-NIR spectral regions are azadipyrromethenes (ADPMs), a family of dye structurally related to dipyrromethene (DPM) and porphyrinoids.16 The advantages that ADPM has over the DPM and porphyrinoids are both synthetic and electronic. ADPM doesn't require the tedious and low yielding macrocyclic formation step of the porphyrinoids and it has an intrinsic bathochromic shift of about 50 nm as compared to DPM. Their high absorbance in the yellow-to-red part of the spectrum and strong NIR luminescence encountered in BF2-chelated Aza-BODIPY analogues are appealing in the context of designing new light-harvesting materials.17–23 This is especially true as they provide a flexible coordinating motif to further fine-tune their properties with various metallic centers.24–31 Lately, DPM- and ADPM-based materials have found application as photosensitizers in DSSC and OPV applications where they have provided significant improvements of panchromaticity and PCE.16,32–38
Herein, we report the development of a novel family of organometallic sensitizers based for the very first time on the cyclometalation of an ADPM chromophore to form neutral ruthenium(II) complexes (Scheme 1). The resulting photosensitizers present an impressive panchromaticity, with strong light absorption in the 600–800 nm range that even reaches beyond 1100 nm in the case of terpyridine-based adducts. Evaluation of their solar energy conversion potential for DSSC and OPV applications is made possible through a systematic investigation of spectroscopic, electrochemical and X-ray structural properties. Computational modelization also provides strong support in order to assess the effect of various structural modifications implemented in the series. Further testing in solar cells points toward efficient charge photoinjection in DSSC and unprecedented NIR light absorption for a ruthenium-based photosensitizer,39–48 even when compared to related complexes bearing the DPM moiety.49–54

Results and discussion
Rational design of cyclometalated ADPM photosensitizers
To fully take advantage of ADPM's intrinsic photophysical and electronic properties for solar energy conversion applications, we undertook the cyclometalation of 1 on a RuII metallic center to generate neutral sensitizers 2–6 (Scheme 1). As verified by X-ray structural data (Fig. 1), this cyclometalation strategy causes the planarization of an aryl group adjacent to the two coordinating pyrrolic cycles. The resulting tridentate ADPM motif with a X2L type of coordination provides better electron delocalization throughout the conjugated π-system and promotes absorption in the NIR due to a reduced HOMO–LUMO band-gap (ΔE).16 In addition, the presence of two σ-donating bonds on the metal from deprotonation of one pyrrole and one phenyl ring destabilize the ruthenium t2g orbital significantly.42 Our cyclometalation strategy presents similar advantages to NCS-free derivatives and the modular synthesis obtained in other cycloruthenated sensitizers, while outperforming their photophysical properties due to the ADPM core.43–46 This is also the case as compared to closely related bidentate DPM ruthenium complexes.50–54 The choice of ADPM 1 bearing electron-rich p-methoxy substituents on phenyl rings was both intended to tune the energy level of the resulting sensitizer and provide, upon photoexcitation, a vectorization of electronic transfer toward the acceptor unit, e.g. titanium dioxide in DSSC or PCBM in OPV applications.7,10,55,56 In addition, ancillary ligands of the ruthenium dication constitute other important levers to tune the energy levels of the sensitizers (carbonyl and bpy/t-Bu-bpy/phen for 2–4, respectively; terpyridine derivatives 4′-4-bromophenyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine [tpy-Ph-Br] for 5 and 4′-([2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridin]-4′-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid [tpy-Ph2-COOH] for 6). Carbonyl ligands are known to stabilize ruthenium complexes and they could be directly formed by oxidation of the methanol ligand present in the Ru(N^N)(MeOH)Cl3 starting materials.57 While compound 7 bearing the carboxylic acid anchoring groups (Fig. 2) was unattainable in our hands due to decomposition during purification, we were able to isolate compound 6 for integration into DSSCs. The series of derivatives obtained herein is also among the rare examples of neutral ruthenium complexes bearing polypyridine ligands (N^N or N^N^N), which are quickly gaining attention for photosensitization.58–62 Finally, our design of neutral sensitizers was envisioned to favour electron injection in a similar fashion to commercially available ruthenium sensitizers such as bpy-based N3 or tpy-based Black Dye and to metalloporphyrins holding the world-record power conversion efficiency.7–9,63 Altogether, we believe cyclometalation of ADPM in neutral Ru(II) sensitizers mimics light-harvesting metalloporphyrinoids such as Chlorophyll a, while offering a simpler synthetic methodology that increases its potential for direct applications.

X-ray diffraction
Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained for compounds 2, 4, and 5 (Fig. 1). They crystallized in the space groups I, P21/c, and P, respectively (Table S.15†). All three complexes display distorted octahedral geometry at the RuII center. They highlight the ADPM moiety coordinated in meridional fashion, acting as a tridentate ligand, by cyclometallation of one of the proximal aryl groups. In both adducts 2 and 4, the coordination sphere around the metal center is completed by an axial carbonyl ligand, and by one bpy and phen ligands, respectively. In compound 5, the tpy-Ph-Br ligand occupies the second meridional position. Selected bond lengths and angles are compared in Table S.16.† In all three compounds, the Ru–NADPM bond lengths are within normal ranges for Ru–N bonds in RuII polypyridyl complexes.64–66 The Ru–N1ADPM bond lengths [2.022(8)–2.055(5) Å] trans to Nbpy/phen (N5) in 2 and 4, and trans to N′phtpy (N5) in 5, are shorter than the Ru–N3ADPM analogues, trans to Ccyclo (C12) [2.192(6)–2.222(3) Å]. The bond lengths Ru–N4bpy/phen (axial, trans to CCO in 2 and 4), and Ru–N4phtpy (axial, in 5) are longer than the Ru–N5bpy/phen/tpy-Ph-Br (equatorial, trans to N1ADPM) ones. In all three complexes, the Ru–Ccyclo bonds are longer than those in cationic RuII complexes with cyclometallated bpy [2.046(8) Å – UBUTUG]67 (Cambridge Structural Database references are given as six-letter codes) and tpy [1.99(1) Å – UDOHUQ].68 The Ru–C12cyclo bonds are similar in 2 [2.071(3) Å] and 4 [2.069(10) Å], and are comparable with those in neutral RuII complexes with cyclometallated bpy ligands [2.063(5) Å – VAKMAX].69 However, it is slightly longer in 5 [2.102(3) Å] most probably due to both steric and electronic reasons: the tpy-Ph-Br ligand forces further away the cyclometallated proximal aryl group of the ADPM moiety vs. the bpy/phen ligands and the absence of carbonyl ligand leads to an enriched metallic center that also stretches the Ru–C12cyclo bond. In 2 and 4, the bond lengths around the RuII center are comparable with those found in other complexes with similar coordination environment (QUBZAO)70 and neutral charge (EJOHUG)71 (Table S.17†). The Ru–CCO and the C–O bond lengths in 2 and 4 are identical within 3σ, with the average values being 1.823(12) Å and 1.158(13) Å, respectively; however the latter are significantly longer than in free CO (1.128 Å)72 as a result of back-donation from the ruthenium in the carbonyl ligand π*-orbitals. Infrared spectroscopy further supports the similar CO bond lengths observed by X-ray diffraction, with stretches of 1908 cm−1 for both adducts 2 and 4 alongside a closely related value of 1909 cm−1 for derivative 3 that falls within the experimental error of the instrument (ESI†). A significant retrodonation is observed in the carbonyl ligand π*-orbitals of the ruthenium complexes in the series in comparison with the uncoordinated CO molecule IR stretch (2143 cm−1) and is in agreement with other closely related neutral RuII complexes bearing both cyclometalated and carbonyl ligands.73 The similar infrared stretches and bond lengths within the series are also in line with the exact same electronic density of 2% on the HOMO−1 and no contribution at all on the HOMO that were calculated for the CO moiety by computational modelization (Table S.2†). In addition, the Ru–CCO and the C–O bond lengths in 2 and 4 are shorter than those found in the pentacoordinated neutral Ru–carbonyl complex of N4-macrocyclic ligands, suggesting a lower degree of back-donation in the latter [e.g. BAMKUW – Ru–CCO 1.87(1) Å and C–O 1.10(1) Å],74 while being in the same range as those reported for the neutral hexacoordinated Ru–carbonyl complexes with pentadentate flexible macrocyclic ligands [e.g. CAHWIR – Ru–CCO = 1.833(5) Å and C–O = 1.156(7) Å].75 In 5, Ru–Nphtpy bonds are similar with those found in neutral RuII complexes with tpy ligands [e.g. ALOMEU – 2.044(4); 1.947(4); 2.037(4)].76 The origin of the distortion from regular octahedron in the three compounds is the small bite angle of the ADPM, phen, bpy, and tpy-Ph-Br ligands. The bite angle of the ADPM ligand coordinated in the tridentate cyclometallated chelate is 161.6(1)° in 2, 164.1(4)° in 4, and 160.2(2)° in 5, values that are slightly higher than those found for the corresponding angles of tpy ligands [e.g. 157.8(1)° in Ru(tpy-Ph)22+],66 but significantly lower than the ideal 180° value. In addition, a lower NADPM–Ru–Ntpy-Ph-br angle in 5 (168.7(2)°) as compared with the trans N–Ru–N angle in Ru(tpy-Ph)22+ [179.1(2)°], results in the larger deviation from the perfect octahedral geometry observed in 5vs.2 and 4. The bite angle of the bpy ligand in 2 [76.9(1)°] is lower than the corresponding bite angle in Ru(bpy)32+ [78.6(2)°],65 while the bite angles of phen in 4 and tpy-Ph-Br in 5 [79.1(3)° and 158.2(2)°] are similar with those reported for Ru(phen)32+ and Ru(tpy-Ph)22+ [80.2(7)°) and 157.8(1)°].64,66 The bite angle of the N,N′-ADPM ligand in 2, 4, and 5 are 82.1(1)°, 85.1(3)°, and 82.3(2). The higher value in 4 is the effect of differences in packing interactions (vide infra), resulting in the non-cyclometallated ADPM proximal aryl being twisted away from the phen moiety. This fact, together with the bigger bite angle of phen vs. bpy, results in 4 being closer to octahedral geometry than 2, which has effects on the optoelectronic properties of the complexes as observed by Hammarström and Johansson.77 The analysis of the differences in conformation of ADPM ligands in 2, 4 and 5vs. the free ligand,25 other metallic mono-ADPM26,78,79 and homoleptic ADPM complexes25,80 was undertaken. The periplanar angles of the aryl rings and the plane of the ADPM backbone are reported in Table S.16.† The most important feature in this respect is the effect of the cyclometallation, resulting in the extended planarization of the ADPM ligand from the pyrollic backbone to the proximal cyclometallated aryl ring. As a consequence, the ‘canting’ of the metal-chelate ring, observed in other metallic complexes of ADPM ligands25,26,78–80 is eliminated. The presence in the structures of an additional N^N or N^N^N ligand capable of forming π–π interactions with the non-cyclometallated proximal aryl ring of the ADPM moiety offers the premises for a second general feature within these complexes, as clearly identified in 2 and 5 (Fig. 1, S.36, S.39 and S.40†). Additional discussion regarding packing features of 2, 4 and 5 can be found in the ESI.†
Panchromatic absorption properties
Investigation of the photophysical properties of photosensitizers 2–6 as compared to ADPM 1 and its corresponding Aza-BODIPY 8 (Fig. 2) revealed a strong potential for NIR photon absorption combined with an unsurpassed panchromaticity for ruthenium-based chromophores (Fig. 3 and Table 1).39–44,47,48,50–53 The overall effect of ADPM cyclometalation for all the compounds studied consists in a decrease of extinction coefficient (ε) joined by a broadening of absorption bands both toward the visible and NIR spectral regions. Combined with corresponding ancillary ligands, a synergy in the absorption profile is obtained which allows light to be harvested steadily throughout the visible spectrum. Free ligand 1 presents a sharp absorption maximum in the red at 627 nm (λmax red; ε = 52 × 103 M−1 cm−1) with a tail up to 700 nm in dichloromethane. For RuII complex 2, this value is red-shifted to 660 nm (ε = 17 × 103 M−1 cm−1) with an almost equally high band as a shoulder at 719 nm (λshoulder red; ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1) that tails past 850 nm. This bpy-based sensitizer also presents a shoulder in the green at 550 nm (λshoulder green; ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and another maximum of absorption in the purple at 436 nm (λmax purple; ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1). Closely related N^N derivatives 3 and 4 present similar spectral features, with λmax red at 654 and 659 nm (ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1), respectively, with shoulders in the red at 712 (ε = 16 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 702 nm (ε = 17 × 103 M−1 cm−1) tailing toward the NIR. Panchromaticity is also preserved for 3 and 4 with λshoulder green at 552 and 544 nm (ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1), respectively, along with λmax purple at 439 and 437 nm (ε = 15 × 103 M−1 cm−1). In the case of tpy-based derivatives 5 and 6, the absorption profile is slightly different and presents a tailing band out beyond 1100 nm. The absorption maximum is hypsochromically shifted in the orange at 610 (ε = 22 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 600 nm (ε = 16 × 103 M−1 cm−1), respectively, but the shoulder of the absorption band reaches 752 (ε = 5.6 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 753 nm (ε = 5.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1) in the NIR region. Photosensitizer 5 exhibits a sharp shoulder in the green at 536 nm (ε = 14 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and a maximum in the purple at 423 nm (ε = 16 × 103 M−1 cm−1). Features in that portion of the spectrum are smoothed out in the case of 6, with a discrete shoulder in the green at 538 nm (ε = 13 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and λmax purple at 422 nm (ε = 13 × 103 M−1 cm−1). In comparison, the BF2-chelation in Aza-BODIPY 8 leads to a shift of the maxima to 691 nm (ε = 79 × 103 M−1 cm−1) with a tailing limited to about 750 nm. Of interest, a B,O-chelated BODIPY derivative used as additive in a P3HT OPV solar cell was reported to have a maxima reaching 747 nm (ε = 148 × 103 M−1 cm−1) tailing up to 800 nm.81 A variety of ruthenium complexes used for DSSC also constitute valuable benchmarks. Classic N3 dye (λmax = 530 nm in MeCN; ε = 13 × 103 M−1 cm−1; tail up to ca. 750 nm)53 and Black Dye (λmax = 605 nm in DMF/MeOH [4:1 v/v]; ε = 8.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1; tail up to ca. 850 nm)82 both exhibit lower extinction coefficients and panchromaticity than related N^N sensitizers 2–4 and tpy-based 5 and 6, respectively (Table 1). This is also the case compared with closely related ruthenium thienyl–DPM complexes where the best bpy-based derivative have a λmax = 540 nm (ε 19 × 103 M−1 cm−1) tailing up to ca. 750 nm and tpy-based derivative reach a λmax of 750 nm (ε = 2.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1) tailing to ca. 950 nm.51,52 Therefore, it appears that cyclometalation of the ADPM moiety with a ruthenium dication provides outstanding spectral features ranging all the way from the visible up to the NIR spectral regions. A detailed investigation of implied transitions by TD-DFT will be discussed in the computational section in order to better understand the trends arising from the structural differences within the series.

Electrochemical properties
To determine if new sensitizers are efficient photoactive materials in DSSC and OPV applications, their exact energy levels need to be assessed and their overall stability must be well understood. For instance, in DSSC applications, a high-lying HOMO level of a given sensitizer might lead to difficulties for the redox mediator (e.g. I−/I3− couple at −5.0 eV)83 to reduce it after photoinjection of an electron into TiO2 or to rapid deterioration of the photovoltaic device upon exposition to air (oxidation threshold at −5.27 eV).43,84–86 A mismatch between the  level of the sensitizer and the corresponding acceptor, e.g. fullerene-based PCBM (between −3.91 and −4.3 eV)87 in OPV or the TiO2 conduction band in DSSC (∼−4.2 eV),5,88 would hinder electron transfer upon photoexcitation.10,16,55 Based on the Rehm–Weller equation for intermolecular electron transfer reaction and accounting for the photoexcited nature of the reductant species in photovoltaic devices, the excited state oxidation potential () must lie above the acceptor electronic level, particularly in coordination complexes which exhibit rapid intersystem crossing to a lower-lying triplet state.5,89 To this end, standard OPV and DSSC requirements are depicted in Fig. 4 along with the HOMO/LUMO and  levels as obtained both by electrochemistry (black), computational modelization (red) and absorption spectra (blue) for photosensitizers 2–6. Additional solar conversion application in the quickly growing field of photocatalysis also requires insights from electrochemistry in order to efficiently achieve new light-mediated organic transformations.90–92 Therefore, the electrochemical properties observed experimentally by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry techniques (CV and DPV, respectively; refer to Fig. S.15–S.29 of ESI† for voltammograms) for the series are discussed herein in detail and will be further rationalized by computational modelization results. Such a systematic analysis is intended to better understand how the structural changes within the series fine-tune the energy levels and alter the stability of the complexes to redox processes.
 Fig. 4  Energy levels of ADPM sensitizers 2–6 (electrochemistry in black, estimated excited state oxidation potential  in blue and DFT calculations in red) vs. standard OPV (left) and DSSC (right) requirements (refer to text and notes thereof). 
An overview of the electrochemical data (Table 2) of ruthenium photosensitizers 2–4 bearing bidendate N^N and carbonyl ligands shows the presence of four oxidation processes, the first two of which are irreversible followed by two “pseudoreversible” ones. In addition, two reduction processes can be observed, the first being pseudoreversible and followed by a second irreversible one. In contrast, the free ADPM ligand 1 presents only three oxidation processes, where the first one is reversible at 0.71 (61) V (mV) vs. SCE and the two others are irreversible (1.10 and 1.30 V, respectively), along with two pseudoreversible reductions (−0.92 (106) and −1.52 (193) V, respectively). The corresponding Aza-BODIPY 8 behaves in a similar fashion to 1, except that its first oxidation at 0.95 V is irreversible and a general increase of the oxidation potentials is due to the electron-withdrawing BF2 chelate (1.34 and 1.52 V, respectively). The two pseudoreversible reduction processes are also at lower potentials of −0.58 (107) and −1.37 (92) V owing to the poorer electron density in the molecule. Interestingly, the conjunction of a RuII cation with the presence of N^N and carbonyl ligands appears to significantly destabilize the energy levels of complexes obtained as compared to the free ADPM ligand and exemplified by the first oxidation ranging between 0.32 and 0.39 V for 4 and 2, respectively, with an intermediate value at 0.34 V for 3. DFT calculations revealed that the HOMO in the 2–4 series resides mainly on the ADPM and cyclometalated moieties (vide infra), which explain the relative order observed in the oxidation processes. Since the carbonyl ligand is constant in the three derivatives, N^N ligands therefore dictate the order of oxidation potentials. The increasing ease of oxidation follows the growth of electron density encountered in the bpy/t-Bu-bpy/phen series. Similarly, the irreversible second oxidation is in the 0.43–0.48 V range (4 and 2, respectively), with an intermediate value at 0.46 V for 3. The third pseudoreversible process standing at 0.79 V in all three compounds is ligand-based. In fact, it closely matches the first pseudoreversible oxidation of ADPM 1 at 0.71 V that was found to be centered on the azadipyrromethene core with additional contribution from the proximal aryls.24 The slight shift to more positive potential as compared to the free ligand is due to the presence of the electron withdrawing RuII cation. The pseudoreversible fourth oxidation at 0.91 (176) for 2, 0.95 (102) for 3 and 0.93 (204) V in the case of 4 is attributable to the metal centered RuIII/II process, in agreement with other closely related neutral RuII complexes bearing both cyclometalated and carbonyl ligands.73 The first pseudoreversible reduction process stands at −1.19 (124) V for 2, −1.28 (157) V for 3 and −1.25 (167) for 4. Both the calculated LUMO obtained by DFT (vide infra) and related RuII diimine complexes suggest this process is occurring on the N^N moiety rather than the ADPM one.93 The second irreversible reduction process follows at −1.82, −1.93 and −1.89 V, respectively, most likely localized on the ADPM ligand based on DFT insights (Table S.2†). The terpyridine-based photosensitizers 5 and 6 present a first oxidation at 0.06 (87) and 0.08 V, respectively, this is about 0.30 V more easily oxidized as compared to related bidentate N^N derivatives 2–4, 0.55 V vs. cyclometalated Ru(tpy)(N^N^C)1+ [0.61 (60) V in ACN; N^N^C(H) = 6-phenyl-2,2′-bipyridine] and 1.25 V vs. Ru(tpy)22+ [1.31 (60) V in ACN], a logical trend based on the extended π-conjugated system of tridentate derivatives and global charge of the complexes.94 Theoretical calculations of van Koten et al. on the two last complexes showed a significant decrease of the Mulliken population on the ruthenium center of the HOMO when changing one L3 type tpy ligand for a XL2 type N^N^C (0.68 vs. 0.50 electron on the dxy orbital, respectively), which is in line with our own calculations indicating that the X2L cyclometalated ADPM ligand further decrease to only 10% the electron density on the metal (Table S.2†). Therefore, this first oxidation for the two neutral complexes reported herein is best described as a ligand-based process with 88% of the electronic density on the ADPM core plus the cyclometalated aryl. Compound 5 has two extra pseudoreversible oxidation processes at 0.66 (50) and 1.30 (153) V. DFT suggests the former reversible one should be the RuIII/II process with a 42% electronic density on the metal (Table S.2†). In the case of adduct 6, data acquired in more polar DMF for improved solubility reveals three additional irreversible oxidation processes at 0.50, 0.94 and 1.31 V. The first pseudoreversible reduction processes at −1.37 (101) V in photosensitizer 5 is localized on the tpy-Ph-Br, as expected for a cyclometalated complex and also supported by DFT (Table S.2†).94,95 Another irreversible process follows at −1.87 V. After its conversion to 6, the first reduction is at −1.25 V along with three other ones at −1.79, −2.04 and −2.35 V.96

The HOMO and LUMO levels expressed in eV (Fig. 4 and Table S.1†) are relevant in order to better understand the structure–property relationship that units photosensitizers 2–6 and to fine-tune their incorporation into DSSCs and OPV devices. As mentioned above, the rising energy of the HOMO that is mainly based on the ADPM ligand for the series 2–4 (−5.33, −5.28 and −5.27 eV vs. vacuum, respectively) is consistent with the electron density contribution trend in the N^N ligands. On the other hand, the first reduction potential determined by electrochemistry and associated to the LUMO exhibits an increase between 2 (−3.76 eV) and 3 (−3.66 eV), while that of adduct 4 stands in between at −3.70 eV. Based on DFT results (vide infra), the LUMO lies mainly on the N^N ligand (ca. 90%) with a small contribution made by the metal center (ca. 5%) for 2 and 3, which explains the relative order of energy levels since bpy should be a better acceptor than the electron-rich t-Bu-bpy. The situation is slightly different in the case of 4 as the orbital appears to be almost entirely based on the phenanthroline moiety (99% of the electronic density, Table S.2†), with no contribution made by the metal center. Therefore, the latter dication might be better considered as an electron-withdrawing group coordinated to the phen, with no contributing electron density, which explains the lowest LUMO level observed. The resulting electrochemical band gaps (ΔERedox) obtained are of 1.57 eV for both 2 and 4 up to 1.62 eV for 3. It is important to note that while ground state electrochemistry of isolated molecules reported here do not provide the formal  needed for a complete picture in actual photovoltaic devices, an estimation was made by adding the ΔEOpt to the first oxidation potential (Fig. 4 and Table S.1†) to give an  for potential photoinjection from the singlet state. Results indicate  levels of the series range from −3.86 to −3.97 eV and are above the requirements of the two solar conversion applications mentioned above. In addition, the low reorganizational energy upon photoexcitation usually associated with polypyridyl ruthenium complexes should lead to a  similar to the measured reduction potential.97 Promisingly, the three ADPM cyclometalated adducts based on a N^N and carbonyl ligands exhibit HOMO levels slightly below the oxidation threshold, low band gaps along with  levels that are over the LUMO energy level of the PCBM acceptor and the energy level of the conduction band of TiO2. With such energy levels features, this new class of neutral RuII sensitizer bearing a cyclometalated ADPM appears to be suited for applications in OPV and DSSC if efficient singlet-state photoinjection occurs. To note, an optimal driving force of about 0.2–0.3 eV is suitable for efficient electron transfers toward the acceptor unit.5,16,48 Tpy-based sensitizers 5 and 6 present a significantly destabilized HOMO level about 0.3 eV higher at −5.00 and −5.03 eV, respectively. In addition to the extended π-conjugated system of these tridentate derivatives discussed previously, this phenomenon is also attributable to the removal of the carbonyl ligand that accepts back-donation into its π* orbitals from the metal center. A better appreciation of such a structural modification can be obtain by comparing the values of the classic Ru(tpy)22+ at −6.26 eV or Ru(dgpy)(Ph-tpy)2+ and Ru(dgpy)(Ph-dpt)2+ bearing a strong σ-donating ligand 2,6-diguanidylpyridine (dgpy) at −5.45 eV.98,99 It can be observed that the presence of the N^N^C dianionic ADPM cyclometalated ligand shifts the oxidation potential compared to these respective complexes by ca. 1.25 and 0.45 eV. Unfortunately, the drastic shift also lead to its air-sensitive nature as observed during the synthesis of 5 and upon long-term air exposition of 6 in solution (vide supra). The LUMO level of adduct 5 is the highest of the series at −3.58 eV, while extension of the conjugation on tpy moiety achieved in sensitizer 6 stabilizes it by 120 mV at −3.70 eV. From the  energy level at −3.97 eV of sensitizer 6, which is slightly higher than for Black Dye (LUMO = −4.00 eV),42 the former adduct bearing a carboxylic acid anchoring group should provide a suitable driving force for the photoinjection in the TiO2 conduction band.
Computational modelization insights
DFT methods provide useful insights for OPV and DSSC applications through careful analysis of the relative energy levels in a given series of photosensitizers, electronic distribution of their frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) and calculated dipole moment.100–104 Based on the simple and accurate approach of Méndez-Hernández et al. for the correlation of experimental redox potentials and DFT-calculated HOMO/LUMO energies,105 we endeavoured to use a joint theoretical–experimental approach to gain a better understanding of electrochemical trends and provide guidelines for further developments of related cyclometalated sensitizers. Theoretical energy levels obtained using the B3LYP/6-31G* (C, H, O, N) and LanL2DZ (Ru) level of theory are depicted in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table S.1.†
A quick visual overview of frontier molecular orbitals represented in Fig. 5 shows that the HOMO is mainly centered on the ADPM ligand, including the cyclometalated moiety, and partially on the ruthenium dication in all the series of sensitizers 2–6. On the other hand, the LUMO primarily resides on the N^N or tpy ancillary ligand along with the metallic center in all cases except for sensitizer 5 where an additional small contribution to this empty orbital can be found on the ADPM moiety. Photosensitizer 6, which bears the carboxylic acid anchoring group for DSSC, clearly exhibits a LUMO delocalized throughout the whole tpy-based ligand as compared to 5 where only the tpy core close to the metal is involved. Further support of this HOMO/LUMO analysis can be found in ESI,† where a definition of the various moieties present in the photosensitizers (Figure S.30†) along with a detailed analysis of the electronic contribution (Table S.2†) are presented.
 Fig. 5  HOMO/LUMO and dipole moment vector of ADPM sensitizers 2–6 as calculated by DFT (isovalue = 0.02; hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity; dipole moment × 3 for 5 and 6). 
The computational results are of great interest since they suggest an important vectorization of the electronic transfer from the electron-rich cyclometalated ADPM ligand toward the pyridine-based counter-ligands and support the rational design of this new family (vide supra). This behaviour suitable for the development of efficient OPV and DSSC sensitizers is further reinforced by calculated dipole moment vectors represented in Fig. 5 (blue arrows) pointing in each case from the Ru(II) metallic center toward the N^N or tpy-based ligand. The vector modulus obtained are of 4.88 and 4.94 Debye for 5 and 6, respectively, and in the range of 8.41–9.95 Debye for N^N based sensitizers. Such an increase of the modulus value in the latter cases is attributed to the electron-accepting carbonyl ligand that helps reduce the electron density of the metallic center.
Regarding the relative position of theoretical HOMO/LUMO as compared to the empirical electrochemical potentials obtained (Fig. 4), the computational results appear to provide a good match with the LUMO trend, while it is more cumbersome for the HOMO. This mismatch for the relative order of the HOMOs might arise from the close proximity of the electrochemical potentials with the oxidation threshold that leads to the structural instability observed in the tpy-based derivatives. Since DFT calculations suggest that the HOMO involves mainly the ADPM ligand, this stability issue could be associated with increased reactivity toward hydrolysis on the pyrrolic carbon adjacent to the N-bridge that would break the π-conjugated system. This hypothesis is further supported by the loss of color observed upon long-term air exposition in a methanolic solution of photosensitizer 6. Nevertheless, the DFT results efficiently depict that the least positive oxidation encountered would be for the tpy-based sensitizers 5 (−4.09 eV) and 6 (−4.07 eV) as compared to the N^N series 2–4 ranging between −4.20 and −4.13 eV. Theoretical calculations provide a perfect match of LUMO relative order within the N^N series as compared to first reduction potentials, with sensitizer 4 (−2.14 eV) in between the t-Bu-bpy adduct 3 (−1.97 eV) and bpy adduct 2 (−2.17 eV). Similarly, tpy-based photosensitizer 5 (−1.94 eV) and 6 (−1.97 eV) follow the order obtained by electrochemistry and are in good agreement with calculated values of the N^N series. Combined together, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels provide theoretical band gaps (ΔETheo, red) that are consistent with the electrochemical values obtained (ΔEEchem, black) within a series of related structures (Fig. 4). In fact, photosensitizer 3 provides the largest band gap both experimentally (ΔEEchem = 1.62 eV) and from calculations (ΔETheo = 2.15 eV) in the N^N series. The two other photosensitizers have identical experimental values (ΔEEchem = 1.57 eV) supported by close theoretical values of 2.03 and 2.05 eV for 2 and 4, respectively. The widest band gap of tpy-based sensitizer 5 observed by electrochemistry (ΔEEchem = 1.42 eV) as compared to 6 (ΔEEchem = 1.33 eV) was also rationalized from calculations (ΔETheo = 2.15 and 2.08 eV, respectively). Overall, the DFT method used herein provides a satisfactory theoretical protocol to understand key parameters controlling the experimental energy levels, including ADPM cyclometalation effect and stability issues. This approach establishes a strong foundation to foster exploration of structural improvements achievable within this exciting new family of photosensitizers.
A systematic TD-DFT analysis is described herein using B3LYP/6-31G* (C, H, O, N) and LanL2DZ (Ru) with the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) of dichloromethane for the series of neutral Ru(II) ADPM cyclometalated photosensitizers. Additional calculations for adduct 6 were done with the PCM of methanol in order to accurately mimic the experimental spectrum. This protocol is analogous to previously reported theoretical investigations of ruthenium complexes for DSSC applications,45,46,51,106 Calculated optical absorption bands, associated oscillator strengths and natural transition orbitals (NTO) implied in the excitations are summarized in Tables S.3–S.14 of ESI.† Assignment of the origin of the transitions was made based on the analysis of this data so as to assess effects of the various structural modifications. A superposition of the calculated absorption bands and experimental spectrum is presented for representatives N^N derivative 2 (PCM = CH2Cl2) and tpy-based derivative 6 (PCM = MeOH) in Fig. 6 and S.32–S.35† for other members of the series.
 Fig. 6  Experimental absorption spectrum for ADPM photosensitizers 2 (top; in CH2Cl2) and 6 (bottom; in MeOH) along with corresponding calculated optical absorption bands (red lines; TD-DFT B3LYP/6-31G*; Ru = LANL2DZ; PCM = CH2Cl2 and MeOH, respectively). 
The theoretical results are in close agreement with the empirical ones as their absorption bands correspond almost perfectly. It is noteworthy that slight shifts obtained for the transition energies calculated by TD-DFT can be attributed to the use of a simple solvent model, i.e. no corrections beyond linear-response, and the use of vertical transition that neglect vibronic effects.107 The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of ruthenium that accounts for the tailing observed at low energy was not included in our modelization in view of the additional computational cost implied and its relatively weak effect compared to osmium derivatives.108 In the case of 5 and 6, an almost perfect match of calculated absorption bands is observed throughout the whole UV, visible and NIR regions of the spectra. The N^N series also match perfectly in the UV and visible regions, but lack good overlap in the red region. A similar situation was observed in related DPM and ADPM complexes that can be rationalized by intrinsic inability of the TD-DFT method to accurately determine the exciton energy splitting between two transitions dipoles, only providing their relative orientation and magnitude.30 This leads us to assign the T1 transition calculated in the N^N series 2–4 as the one associated with λshoulder red (ESI, Tables S.3–S.8†), which imply a bathochromic shift of 50–65 nm.
In fact, careful analysis of NTOs and major contributions to the lowest energy excitation T1 reveals that the shoulder in the red part of the spectrum that tails up to about 850 nm in the NIR for the N^N series (λshoulder red = 702–712 nm) is the result of a strong electronic transition (osc. strength ∼ 0.3–0.4) from the cyclometalated moiety of the ADPM, the ruthenium and the carbonyl ligand toward the corresponding N^N ligand and ADPM core. The λmax red is properly depicted by transition T2 departing from the core and cyclometalated moieties of the ADPM toward the N^N, carbonyl and metallic centers. Therefore, both T1 and T2 are of great interest for efficient photoinjection in DSSC application since they directly involve electronic transfer from the cyclometalated moiety towards the N^N counter ligand as was initially rationalized in our design (vide supra). The shoulder in the green part of the solar spectrum (λshoulder green = 544–552 nm) is more complicated with multiples transitions involved, mainly arising from the ruthenium along with N^N and carbonyl ligands toward the ADPM and cyclometalated moieties. Further panchromaticity is achieved by a series of transitions providing λmax purple (436–439 nm). The main assignments regarding these maxima are either from core and cyclometalated ADPM moieties, ruthenium center and carbonyl ligand toward the corresponding N^N ligand or from metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions where both the ADPM core and N^N ligand receive the electronic density. These last transitions are in the absorption range expected for Ru(II) polypyridine complexes.109
Tpy-based photosensitizers 5 and 6 exhibit NIR tailing beyond 1100 nm (λshoulder red) arising from transitions T1 and T2 between 700 and 900 nm along with a spin–orbit coupling component after 900 nm (Tables S.9–S.14†). The later SOC component can be attributed to a higher metallic character on the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals of the two tpy-based derivatives as compared to their N^N counter-parts which arises from the absence of the carbonyl ligand withdrawing electron density through back donation. In facts, DFT calculations show that both tpy-based adducts 5 and 6 present 10% of electronic density on the ruthenium center for their HOMO and 42% for their HOMO−1 (Table S.2†). In comparison, N^N derivatives 2–4 all exhibit 3% and 18% of electronic density on the metal for these two orbitals, respectively. This assignation of a high metallic character on the HOMO and HOMO−1 leading to a pronounced SOC effect is in agreement with was observed for the tpy-based ruthenium photosensitizer DX1 and other closely derived adducts bearing a coordinated phosphine.110–112 Attention was devoted lately to the tangible contribution of the SOC effect towards improved light-harvesting efficiencies and photocurrent generation in DSSC,56,108,112,113 therefore providing an additional argument for the interest in the cyclometalation strategy of DPM derivatives as a mean to activate it. The first transition calculated at 745 nm (T1; osc. strength = 0.076) in derivative 5 is from the metallic center and the cyclometalated moiety toward the whole tpy scaffold (core + Ph-Br) and, in to lesser extent, the ADPM core. The second one at 736 nm (T2; osc. strength = 0.030) implies the electronic transfer from the whole ADPM (core + cyclometalation) and the metallic center toward the tpy ligand (core + Ph-Br). For sensitizer 6 in methanol, the electronic density is taken upon photoexcitation in T1 (752 nm; osc. strength = 0.088) from the ruthenium center, the cyclometalated moiety and the tpy core toward the ADPM core and the Ph2-COOH. The second transition arises from the whole ADPM (core + cyclometalation) and metallic center toward the tpy ligand (core and Ph2-COOH). Interestingly, when the PCM of dichloromethane is used instead as a direct comparison with other sensitizers, both transitions are from ruthenium and ADPM ligand (core + cyclometalation) toward the whole tpy ligand (core + Ph2-COOH). Thus, T1 and T2 transitions of the tpy-based sensitizers are also of great interest for efficient photoinjection. The λmax red for adducts 5 (610 nm) and 6 (600 nm) is the result of a multitude of transitions mostly involving the electron transfer from the metallic center and the entire ADPM ligand toward the tpy ligand and its substituents. For λshoulder green, sensitizer 5 presents a sharp absorption peak at 536 nm also arising from the cyclometalated and core moieties of the ADPM ligand along with the ruthenium center toward the entire tpy scaffold. On the other hand, photosensitizer 6 has a more complex combination of six calculated transitions that account for the smooth shouldering observed at 538 nm. Their assignment is in close agreement with that found in 5 for this specific shouldering. Finally, λmax purple at 423 nm in 5 is mainly the result of T13 at 452 nm (osc. strength = 0.105), a MLCT transition toward the entire ADPM, and of T15 at 427 nm (osc. strength = 0.249) that involves the cyclometalated moiety and the ruthenium toward the ADPM and tpy cores. Complex 6 in methanol offers a similar behaviour with a MLCT toward the ADPM scaffold (T14; 452 nm; osc. strength = 0.105) and another transition taking electron density from the cyclometalated moiety and the ruthenium toward the ADPM and tpy cores (T18; 428 nm; osc. strength = 0.233). In addition, a series of transitions follow where the ruthenium and whole ADPM ligand transfer electron density toward the entire tpy scaffold upon photoexcitation.
The most interesting feature emerging from TD-DFT analysis of the series is the central impact of the ADPM ligand cyclometalation strategy on the electronic transitions at both low and high energies. The vectorial charge-transfer observed in the Ru(II) complexes of this highly absorbing ligand toward either N^N or tpy derivatives strongly supports further use of dipyrromethene derivatives as cyclometalating ligands for the development of new panchromatic photosensitizers with extended NIR absorption properties.
Photoinjection assay
In order to assess the viable of this class of compounds as photosensitizers, compound 6 was anchored to mesoporous thin films. The thin films of anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites or ZrO2 nanoparticles were deposited on glass substrates using a previously reported method.114 Compound 6 was attached to the thin films by submersion in concentrated DMSO solutions (∼mM range) for a minimum of 24 hours. After rinsing with neat acetonitrile, the sensitized thin films were placed in quartz cuvettes containing an argon-saturated electrolyte solution of 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile.
Pulsed 532 nm excitation (∼5 mJ per pulse) of sensitized TiO2 thin films submerged in the acetonitrile electrolyte resulted in the appearance of visible absorption features that persisted for >80 μs (Fig. 7). Pulsed light excitation of the sensitized ZrO2 thin films under otherwise identical conditions did not result in the appearance of long-lived transients. The electron acceptor states in ZrO2 are much higher in energy (toward the vacuum level) than those in TiO2, which apparently inhibited electron transfer from photo-excited 6. The ZrO2 studies also served as a control and showed that there were no long-lived triplet states created after light excitation of 6, and indicated that the long-lived transient observed on TiO2 was indeed a result of dye sensitization and the formation of a charge separated states comprised of an injected electron and oxidized 6.
 Fig. 7  Absorption change measured at the indicated delay times after pulsed 532 nm light excitation of 6 anchored to TiO2. The inset is absorption change monitored at 540 nm with an overlaid fit to the KWW function. 
The appearance of the oxidized 6 could not be time resolved, consistent with fast excited state injection, kinj > 108 s−1. The subsequent charge recombination, of the injected electron with the oxidized sensitizer did not follow first-order kinetics, but was well described by the Kohlraush–Williams–Watts (KWW) stretched exponential function, eqn (1): A(t) = A0e(−kt)β(1)where A0 is the initial amplitude, k is the rate constant and β is inversely proportional to the width of an underlying Lévy distribution.115,116 A value of β = 0.20 was found to provide the best fits of the kinetic data with k = 1.6 × 106 s−1. An “average” rate constant, calculated as the first moment in the distribution, could be obtained from eqn (2), with kKWW = 1.3 × 104 s−1 (2)
The appearance of a long-lived transient for 6 on TiO2 that was absent on ZrO2 as well as the slow recombination rate constants abstracted from the kinetic data are fully consistent with excited state sensitization. This observation indicates that if the stability issues associated with 6 can be addressed, this class of sensitizers offers the real possibility for practical application in dye-sensitized solar cells with sensitization across the entire visible region.
Conclusion
In summary, a novel family of neutral RuII complexes bearing a cyclometalated ADPM chromophore is reported. The resulting organometallic photosensitizers present an impressive panchromaticity, with light absorption beyond 1000 nm. Evaluation of the potential for DSSC and OPV applications was made possible through systematic evaluation of X-ray structures, and the spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational properties of the complexes. Spectroelectochemistry and photoinjection studies were further made on adduct 6 anchored on a titanium dioxide surface and indicate an efficient photoinjection into its conduction band. Hence, potential for integration in solar energy conversion applications of this series of photosensitizers appears highly appealing. Further studies are on-going in order to rationally develop a new generation of DPM-cyclometalated ruthenium chromophores with optimized energy levels, enhanced stability and efficient harvesting of NIR photons.

The most common redox mediator use in DSSC, iodine, is generally considered to work as a 2-electron chemical transformation between I3− and I− in the cell at a potential of −5.0 eV (+0.3 V vs. NHE). However, a 1-electron transfer process between I2˙− and I− at ∼−5.5 eV (+0.8 ± 0.1 V vs. NHE) cannot be ruled out since the regeneration of the oxidized dye involve only one electron. Refer to:

Although evaluated at −4.2 eV (−0.5 V vs. NHE), the exact position of the TiO2 conduction band is known to depend on several factors including the local pH, the concentration of potential determining ions (e.g. Li+), the nature of the electrolyte solvent and on the dye molecular structure.

It is noteworthy that two small reduction peaks at −0.54 and −0.70 V were also observed by DPV and tend to corroborate the decomposition observed during synthesis of this rather sensitive intermediate (refer to experimental section).
Stability issue was also observed for adduct 6 upon long-term exposition in hot methanol solution during a recrystallization attempt.
