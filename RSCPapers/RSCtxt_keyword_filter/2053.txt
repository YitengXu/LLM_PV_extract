    , Accepted 20th September 2021First published on 20th September 2021AbstractTo elucidate the origin of high charge carrier mobility in bis-lactam compounds with twisted geometries, we designed and synthesized a series of 3,7-diphenyl-1,5-dioctyl-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTDP) derivatives bearing various substituents (i.e., OCH3, CH3, H, F, and Cl) in the end-capping phenyl rings. Despite the distinct dihedral angle between the 1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTD) core and the end-capping groups, all of the derivatives formed rigid molecular structures and the delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs), which could lead to high charge transport properties. Among the derivatives, the fluorinated NTDP molecule (NTDP-F) exhibited the highest hole mobility of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 in vacuum-deposited organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) due to the strong intermolecular interaction, high crystallinity, and two-dimensional (2D) terrace-like morphology in the thin-film. Furthermore, the twisted geometry of NTDP-F allowed facile solution processability resulting in a high hole mobility of up to 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 in solution-processed OFETs.
Introduction
Controlling the electronic properties of organic semiconducting thin films through molecular engineering has been intensively studied to improve the charge transport properties in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).1,2 For high-performance OFETs, it is generally known that rigid planar molecular structures and strong intermolecular interactions in the crystalline states are desirable.3–6 In this respect, bis-lactam-based molecules such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), indigo, isoindigo, and benzodipyrrolidone have often been used as promising organic semiconducting building blocks because of their highly planar backbone structure and the strong π–π stacking interactions.7–13
Introduction of five-membered aromatic rings such as thiophene, selenophene, and furan into bis-lactam core units is a general molecular design strategy to induce strong intermolecular interactions by extending the planar π-conjugated backbone structure.8,14–20 Based on this molecular design strategy, polymers containing quasi-planar bis-lactam molecules exhibited excellent hole mobilities larger than 5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs.21–27 On the other hand, most of the five-membered ring-substituted bis-lactam small molecules have shown only limited field-effect mobility despite their quasi-planar structures. For instance, thiophene-flanked DPP and thiophene-flanked indigo showed relatively low hole mobilities of 0.027 and 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Most likely, this is because they form only one-dimensional (1D) electronic coupling structure or poor morphology due to the strong anisotropic intermolecular interactions, which may adversely affect the charge transport properties.28,29 Recent studies have suggested that strong and well-balanced two-dimensional (2D) interactions between molecules can engender the 2D electronic coupling structure and 2D morphology, where the thin films show better domain connectivity and reduced grain boundary, allowing efficient charge transport pathways and low charge trapping sites.30,31 Therefore, adjusting the molecular conformation to impart optimized relative strength and dimensionality of intermolecular interactions can be an alternative design strategy to improve the charge transport properties in OFETs by controlling the intermolecular packing structures and film morphologies. To this end, bis-lactam molecules flanked with six-membered aromatic ring like substituted phenyl groups should be explored due to their adjustable dihedral angle, which however have been less investigated as organic semiconductors due to their apparently reduced effective conjugation length and π–π overlaps.14,32–34
Recently, we have originally developed and explored an entirely new class of high performance bis-lactam compound, 1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTD).35,36 Common with other bis-lactam derivatives, it was found that NTD derivatives flanked with a five-membered aromatic ring exhibited excellent performance in organic optoelectronic devices due to their planar π-conjugated backbone structure. A novel donor polymer, containing thiophene-substituted NTD (C8-NTDT), exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 10.1% in bulk-heterojunction fullerene solar cells attributed to the superior absorption coefficient (α = 2.0 × 105 cm−1) and appropriately controlled crystallinity.37 Most impressively, the C8-NTDT small molecule showed one of the highest charge transporting properties (1.21 cm2 V−1 s−1) among the p-type bis-lactam small molecule-based OFETs,17,19,28 which is attributed both to 2D intermolecular interactions and a favorable thin-film morphology. Meanwhile, we investigated a naphthalene-flanked NTD derivative, C8-NTDN1, as an active layer of a blue wavelength-selective phototransistor. Surprisingly, C8-NTDN1 showed an unexpectedly high maximum hole mobility of 0.38 cm2 V−1 s−1, despite the large dihedral angles (49.86°) between naphthalene and the NTD core.38 This peculiar observation prompted us to systematically investigate the structure–property relationships of phenyl-flanked twisted NTD molecules in this work, which can provide opportunities for tuning the optical and electrical properties via 2D electronic coupling and additionally excellent solubility compared to the planar structure.
Herein, we synthesized a series of 3,7-diphenyl-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTDP) derivatives bearing various substituents at the para-position on the end-capping phenyl groups, denoted as NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl, respectively (Scheme 1). The molecular properties of NTDP derivatives were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and optical and electrical property measurements in the solution states. A specific molecular conformation in the solid states and the effects of intermolecular interactions on crystallinity, film morphology, and device properties were comprehensively analyzed to explore the origin of high carrier mobility in the twisted NTD molecules.

Experimental section
Materials
All commercially available chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (4-methoxyphenylboronic acid and 4-phenylboronic acid), Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. (4-methylphenylboronic acid), and Alfa Aesar Co. (4-fluorophenylboronic acid and 4-chlorophenylboronic acid), and were used as received.
Characterization of compounds
The chemical structures of NTDP derivatives were identified by 1H-NMR (Bruker AVANCE-300), 13C-NMR (Bruker AVANCE-500), and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, JEOL JMS-700). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimazu UV-1650 PC spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer DSC 7 with a TAC 7/DX instrument controller. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat/Galvanostat 273A with a three electrode beaker cell; an Ag and a Pt wire were used as a reference and a counter electrode, respectively. As a working electrode, 3 nm glassy carbon and the NTDP-coated indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass were used for the solution and the thin-film states, respectively. The solution CV measurements were carried out in CH2Cl2 solutions containing 5 × 10−3 M of NTDP derivatives with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as a supporting electrolyte, while the thin-film CV was carried out in acetonitrile solutions containing only the supporting electrolyte. The redox potential was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, 4.8 eV under vacuum) couple as an internal standard, and the onset of oxidation potential (Eox) and reduction potential (Ered) was measured. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated using an equation (EHOMO (LUMO) = − [Eox (red) + 4.8]). The single-crystal structures were analyzed by using a SMART-APEX II ULTRA (Bruker) in Central Instrument Facility, Gyeongsang National University. Out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a D8-advance X-RAY diffractometer (Bruker Miller Co., Germany). The Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) was performed using a PLS-II 3C SAXS-I beamline of the Pohang Acceleration Laboratory in Korea. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NX-10 (Park systems, Korea).
Theoretical calculation
The geometry optimization and single point energy calculations were performed at the DFT level using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set by the Gaussian 09 package.39 To simplify the calculation, all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The reorganization energies for hole charge transfer were calculated by the adiabatic potential surface method. The reorganization energy (λ) corresponds to the following equation:λ = λ1 + λ2 = [E+(QN) − E+(Q+)] + [EN(Q+) − EN(QN)],where E+(QN) and E+(Q+) refer to the total energies of neutral and charged states at the optimized charged geometry, respectively, and EN(Q+) and EN(QN) refer to the total energies of the charged and neutral states at optimized neutral geometry, respectively. The effective charge-transfer integral values (V) for the selected dimer were calculated with PW91 functional and TZP basis sets using the ADF program package.40–42 The V values were calculated using the following equation:  where J, S and ε1(2) are the transfer integral, spatial overlap, and the site energies, respectively.43 The dimer geometries of NTDP derivatives were directly adopted from their single crystal structures.

Device fabrication and measurement
For the fabrication of bottom-gate top-contact OFETs, SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min with sonication, and dried using N2 gas. After UV-ozone treatment for 30 min, octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) was introduced as a self-assembled monolayer by the vapor phase deposition method in a vacuum chamber at 80 °C for 150 min. To form a vacuum-deposited thin-film layer (30 nm), NTDP derivatives were evaporated on the ODTS treated substrates at different substrate temperatures from room temperature to 110 °C (a deposition rate of 0.1 Å s−1, and a pressure of 3 × 10−6 Torr). For spin-coated thin films, a solution of NTDP-F in CHCl3 (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s followed by an annealing process at 90 °C for 10 min. Then 10 nm thick MoO3 and 50 nm thick Au were subsequently deposited as source–drain electrodes through a shadow mask. The current–voltage characteristics were measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using a Keithley 4200-SCS parameter analyzer.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of NTDP derivatives
We decided to synthesize simple phenyl-flanked NTD derivatives as model compounds because it is easy to introduce various substituents into the twisted end-capping phenyl rings and thus to provide insight into the structure–property relationship.44 Here, we introduced five different substituents from electron donors to acceptors (i.e., OCH3, CH3, H, F, and Cl) to systematically investigate their electrochemical properties, molecular conformations, intermolecular packing structures, and thin-film morphologies. The chemical structures and the synthetic routes for NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl are depicted in Scheme 1. Following the literature procedure, 3,7-dibromo-1,5-dioctyl-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (1) was prepared,30 and then was reacted with the corresponding para-substituted phenyl boronic acids via the Suzuki-coupling reaction to afford the target compounds. All final products were synthesized in high yields of over 75% and characterized by NMR and HRMS. All the target derivatives showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, and THF, facilitating the solution-process for thin-film deposition in addition to the conventional vacuum-deposition method.
Theoretical calculation
To investigate the characteristics of the NTDP core structures and the substituent effects on their charge transport properties at the molecular level, we performed a theoretical calculation based on the DFT method first. In general, it is well known that sufficiently delocalized frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) over the entire conjugation backbone and low reorganization energies are favorable for the charge transport characteristics. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the optimized structures of the five molecules, NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl, show similar geometries with dihedral angles of around 35° between the NTD core and end-capping groups. Although NTDP derivatives show twisted geometries, it is found that their HOMOs are delocalized over the entire molecule, which is presumably beneficial for the efficient electronic coupling to their neighboring molecules. In the optimized geometries, the distances between the oxygen atoms of carbonyls of the NTD core and the 2-hydrogen atoms of the peripheral phenyl rings (C–H⋯O, see the red dotted lines in Fig. S1, ESI†) are estimated to be ca. 2.30 Å (<the sum of the van der Waals radii, 2.72 Å),45 which indicates the presence of intramolecular interactions between them which are often called non-conventional hydrogen bonding. Such specific intramolecular interactions could lock the molecular conformation and thus enhance the rigidity of molecules, resulting in a decreased reorganization energy. In fact, the calculated hole reorganization energies were 309, 232, 225, 256, and 238 meV for NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl, respectively. It is noticeable that these twisted NTDP derivatives have similar reorganization energies to the previously reported planar NTDT (229 meV) except NTDP-OMe.
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The substituent effect on the FMO energy levels will be discussed in more detail with the practically measured values in the next section.
Optical, thermal, and electrochemical properties
To investigate the optical properties of the NTDP derivatives, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy in the solution states (concentration of 10−5 M in CHCl3) and in the vacuum-deposited thin-film states were conducted, respectively (Fig. 1). In the CHCl3 solution, all NTDP derivatives showed almost identical absorption spectra with well-resolved vibronic features, implying first the small effect of substituents in the isolated molecular states and second the quite rigid molecular structures as was predicted from the reorganization energy calculation by DFT methods (vide supra).
 Fig. 1  Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the NTDP derivatives (a) in the CHCl3 solutions (1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1) and (b) in the thin films. 
Likewise, thin-film spectra of all NTDP derivatives showed prominent vibronic features related to the CC symmetric stretching modes (ca. 0.18 eV, see Table S1, ESI†),1 undoubtedly suggesting that these NTDP derivatives form strong intermolecular interactions and rigid structures in thin films. However, the thin films of the NTDP series showed somewhat dissimilar spectra shapes, indicating different molecular packing structures. Particularly, the NTDP-F thin-film exhibited an exceptionally sharp absorption band at 477 nm with a high absorption intensity ratio between 0–0 and 0–1 bands, indicating significantly different intermolecular interactions and crystallinity in their thin films compared to the other compounds. The optical properties of the NTDP series are summarized in Table 1.

The thermal properties of the five compounds were evaluated by DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), all of the compounds exhibited sharp melting and crystallization peaks, implying a high degree of crystallinity.46,47 The melting temperatures (Tm) are 183.1, 187.1, 184.0, 236.1, and 219.8 °C for NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl, respectively. Note that these melting temperatures are comparable to or significantly higher than that of the planar-structured NTDT (Tm = 178.8 °C).28 In particular, NTDP-F not only showed the highest melting temperature of 236.1 °C, but also exhibited the largest crystallization exotherm (ΔHc = 75.9 J g−1) in the cooling process, indicating the highest crystalline properties among the NTDP series due to the strongest intermolecular interactions among others.
To investigate the electrochemical properties of the NTDP molecules including the FMO energy levels, CV was measured in both solution (5 × 10−3 M in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M TBAHFP) and thin-film states (Table 1 and Fig. S4, ESI†). The substituent effect in the NTDP molecules can conveniently be mentioned in terms of the Hammett substituent constants (MeO = −0.268, Me = −0.170, H = 0.000, F = 0.062, Cl = 0.227).48 As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), both HOMO and LUMO energy levels decrease systematically with increasing Hammett substituent constant in the solution state, which in turn are consistent with DFT calculations. In the thin-film, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels follow a similar tendency depending on the substituent variation, with a single exception for the LUMO energy level of NTDP-Cl. All the measured and calculated energy level alignments are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
Molecular packing structure
To investigate the effects of intermolecular interactions and molecular packing structures on the charge transport properties, single-crystal XRD analyses were performed. Single-crystals of the five molecules were prepared by the solvent diffusion crystal growth method using dichloromethane/methanol (1:1 v/v) solutions. Interestingly, the NTDP series showed quite different molecular packing structures depending on the substituents (Fig. 2 and Tables S2–S6, ESI†). NTDP and NTDP-F, comprising relatively small atom substituents at the para-position of the peripheral phenyl rings, adopt the monoclinic crystal system (space group P21/c). As shown in Fig. 2a, they show similar dihedral angles of ca. 25° with the intramolecular short contacts (dO⋯H = ca. 2.22 Å and 2.24 Å for NTDP and NTDP-F, respectively), suggesting that the intramolecular H-bonding plays an important role in maintaining the rigid molecular skeleton in their single-crystal states. Both molecules show in-plane 2D-type intermolecular interactions as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Briefly, there are intimate face-to-face interactions in the [010] direction with inter-planar distances (dπ–π) of 3.43 Å and 3.44 Å for NTDP and NTDP-F (3.40 Å for NTDT), respectively. In addition, multiple intermolecular short contacts derived from the carbonyl group exist in the [001] direction. Accordingly, similar to the packing structure of previously reported planar NTDT, NTDP and NTDP-F adopt co-facial herringbone-like packing modes, which can provide an efficient charge transport pathway by the 2D electronic coupling structure.

Compared to NTDP and NTDP-F, the other molecules (NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, and NTDP-Cl) have relatively bulky substituents at the para-position of the phenyl rings, and adopt the triclinic crystal system (space group P). NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, and NTDP-Cl have relatively large dihedral angles over 30° in their single crystals possibly due to the weak intramolecular hydrogen bonding compared to NTDP and NTDP-F (see dO⋯H in Fig. 2). These three compounds show slipped stacking structures to avoid the steric hindrance induced by the bulky substituents.49 However, they also formed multiple intermolecular short contacts with the neighboring molecules derived from the carbonyl group of the NTD core.
Based on the single-crystal structures, theoretical charge transfer integral values were calculated using the ADF software program (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2b, NTDP derivatives showed distinct transfer integral values ranging over 3–20 meV, which however appears somewhat low compared to their experimental mobility values as high as 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is in part due to the different crystalline structure and polymorphism in the vacuum-deposited thin-film compared to those in the single crystal, and also to the limited accuracy of theoretical calculation (vide infra). At present, because it is difficult to accurately predict the charge transport properties by only the theoretical calculation,50 the other factors such as crystallinity, microstructures, and morphology in the thin films should be investigated.
Thin-film characterization
To investigate the microstructure and morphology of the vacuum-deposited thin-films, XRD, 2D GIWAXS, and AFM analysis were conducted. As shown in the out-of-plane XRD profile (Fig. S6, ESI†), the vacuum-deposited thin films of the NTDP derivatives showed sharp and strong diffraction peaks except for NTDP-OMe. In particular, NTDP-F exhibited the diffraction peaks of multiple order up to [400] with the highest intensity, suggesting high crystallinity and long-range order of the thin-film.51,52 The highest crystallinity of the NTDP-F thin-film is consistent with its markedly high melting and crystallization temperatures compared to the other NTDP derivatives as mentioned above, implying its promising potential as a high performance OFET.
The intermolecular packing structure in the vacuum-deposited thin-film can be different from that in the single-crystal.53 To gain further insight into the microstructure of the thin films, we carried out 2D-GIWAXS analysis (Fig. 3 and Table S7, ESI†).54NTDP-OMe revealed two different diffraction features: clear Bragg reflection points and ring-like features over the entire diffraction image (Fig. 3a). From the clear reflection points, we deduced the d-spacing of the [001] plane as 13.94 Å and in-plane lattice parameters as a = 9.85 Å, b = 13.07 Å, and γ = 107.80°. These parameters are well-correlated with those of the single-crystal structure (Fig. 2 and Table S2, ESI†). However, as mentioned above, NTDP-OMe thin films also showed ring-like features in the 2D-GIWAXS result due to the randomly oriented molecules and low crystallinity. Therefore, although the NTDP-OMe single-crystal structure showed favorable theoretical charge transfer integral values among the NTDP series, its low crystallinity in the vacuum-deposited thin-film must have restricted charge transport properties in OFETs.

Likewise, NTDP-Me showed the d-spacing of the [001] plane as 14.00 Å and in-plane lattice parameters as a = 10.05 Å, b = 12.48 Å, and γ = 105.77°, which are well-matched with those of the single-crystal structure (Fig. 2 and Table S3, ESI†). From the 2D-GIWAXS result of NTDP-Me, we could confirm that the molecular packing structure in the thin-film is almost identical to that in the single-crystal structure.
On the other hand, the thin-film of NTDP demonstrated two different Bragg peaks at 0.37 Å−1 (d-spacing = 17.03) and 0.46 Å−1 (d-spacing = 13.56 Å) along the qz-direction. The former matches well with the [100] lattice parameter of the single-crystal (Fig. 2 and Table S4, ESI†), whilst the latter does not match to any interplanar distance from the single-crystal structure, indicating the existence of a new phase in the thin-film. Considering that the corresponding peak at qz = 0.46 Å−1 (13.56 Å) mainly appeared under high substrate temperature conditions (Fig. S7, ESI†), we speculate that this new phase was formed by substrate-induced film growth.55 Due to the formation of such a polymorph, the diffraction peaks along the in-plane directions were complex. Among them, the major diffraction peaks correspond to a molecular packing structure, the lattice parameters of which are b = 5.11 Å, c = 17.34 Å, and α = 91.2°, consistent with the single-crystal structure (Table S4, ESI†).
In the NTDP-F vacuum-deposited thin-film, the d-spacing value of the [100] plane was 17.55 Å along the out-of-plane direction, which is matched well with the [100] lattice parameter of the NTDP-F single crystal (Fig. 2). However, the thin-film revealed the slightly different in-plane lattice parameters (b = 7.63 Å, c = 12.24 Å, and α = 90.4°) from the single crystal structure (Table S5, ESI†). Interestingly, a spin-coated NTDP-F thin-film revealed almost the same intermolecular packing structure to the vacuum deposited thin-film (Fig. S8 and Table S8, ESI†).
In contrast, the d-spacing value of [001] NTDP-Cl was 15.94 Å, which does not coincide with the single-crystal (Fig. 2), and the in-plane lattice parameter could not be obtained due to the arcing of the diffractions indicating a lower degree of texture.
For an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the morphology and the charge transport properties, the surface morphologies of the thin films were measured by AFM (Fig. 3 and Fig. S9, ESI†). We could find a significant difference in surface roughness and morphology depending on the substituents. NTDP-OMe showed poor substrate coverage with overgrown nano-sprouts on a flat plane, which could form the defects and charge trap sites between the nano-sprouts and flat planes. Accordingly, NTDP-OMe showed the highest root-mean-square roughness (Rq) among the NTDP derivatives. NTDP-Me also formed a rough surface and could not completely fill the substrate. NTDP exhibited relatively smooth morphology compared to NTDP-OMe and NTDP-Me. However, surface defects such as pinholes were formed which adversely affect the charge transport channels. NTDP-Cl completely filled the substrate with the lowest Rq but formed 1D-type grains.
On the other hand, NTDP-F demonstrated relatively isotropic 2D terrace-like morphology with excellent connectivity and low Rq. Such 2D-type grains are beneficial for forming large grains and reduced grain boundaries, which can lead to high charge transport characteristics. Furthermore, the spin-coated NTDP-F thin-film also exhibited well-connected morphology with a smooth surface but formed a relatively small domain compared to the vacuum-deposited thin-film.
Device properties
To investigate the charge transport characteristics of NTDP-OMe, NTDP-Me, NTDP, NTDP-F, and NTDP-Cl, bottom-gate top-contact OFET devices were fabricated by the vacuum-deposited method on the ODTS-treated SiO2/Si substrate. All of the NTDP derivatives exhibited p-type field-effect properties as depicted in Fig. 4, and the corresponding OFET properties at different substrate temperatures are summarized in Table 2. Although all compounds showed moderate hole mobility values, there were large differences in OFET characteristics depending on the substituents. NTDP-OMe showed the lowest OFET performance (μh,max = 4.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), in spite of the highest calculated transfer integral values, due to the roughest surface with the nanosprouts (Rq = 34.94) and the lowest crystallinity. NTDP-Me, which has a nearly identical molecular conformation and packing mode to NTDP-OMe, also formed a poor morphology with pinholes (Rq = 17.37). However, the thin-film of NTDP-Me with good crystallinity provided improved charge carrier mobility (μh,max = 5.88 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to NTDP-OMe. NTDP exhibited the maximum hole mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 ascribed to the rigid molecular structure with a relatively small dihedral angle (ca. 25°), a cofacial herringbone-like packing mode with 2D-type intermolecular short contacts in the aggregated state, and crystalline thin-film morphology. Notably, NTDP-F reached the highest maximum hole mobility of up to 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about 5 times larger compared to that of NTDP. The greatly improved mobility of NTDP-F seems to be due to the high crystallinity attributed to the strong intermolecular interaction as shown in DSC, the UV-Vis spectrum, and the XRD results, and also to the excellently connected 2D terrace-like morphology with a smooth surface (Rq = 2.03). NTDP-Cl showed the maximum hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 as it formed a continuously connected 1D-type thin-film surface.

To investigate the processing versatility of NTDP-F, which showed the best performance among NTDP derivatives, we fabricated OFET devices by the spin-coating method as well. To our surprise, we could confirm that the spin-coated NTDP-F thin-film formed an identical packing structure to the vacuum-deposited thin-film, and demonstrated a well-connected morphology. As a consequence, annealed spin-coated NTDP-F thin-film OFETs achieved a maximum hole mobility of 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to that of the vacuum-deposited device (Fig. S10, ESI†).
Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized and systemically investigated the structure–property relationships of the NTDP derivatives with various substituents at the para-position on the end-capping phenyl ring. Despite the dihedral angles, NTDP derivatives formed rigid molecular structures and low hole reorganization energies attributed to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding and the homogeneously delocalized HOMO, respectively, which is favorable for charge transport characteristics. Among the derivatives, NTDP-F not only exhibited the highest thermal properties but also the highest maximum hole mobility of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 in vacuum-deposited and 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 in solution-processed OFETs, due to the high crystallinity and excellent thin-film morphology. Our results showing the high charge carrier mobilities despite the non-planar structures suggest the versatile and flexible potential of molecular engineering opportunities for NTD based molecules.
