    , Accepted 22nd August 2011First published on 26th September 2011AbstractNanocrystalline TiO2 films were co-sensitized with CdS and CdSe, deposited using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. These films were used to make optimized solar cell devices using polysulfide electrolyte and gold counter electrodes with the highest efficiency of 3.60% recorded under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination using 6 cycles of CdS and 8 cycles of CdSe. CdS(6)/CdSe(8) co-sensitized devices were compared to devices containing only CdS and CdSe with the co-sensitized cells being superior in terms of photocurrent, cell voltage and overall efficiency. Photo-induced processes were investigated using both Transient Absorption Spectroscopy and Transient Photovoltage measurements. Transient absorption kinetics show that following electron injection from CdS/CdSe into the TiO2 film, the polysulfide electrolyte regenerates holes in the CdS/CdSe layer resulting in a long-lived species which lives up to several hundreds of milliseconds. Comparison with transient photovoltage decays indicates that this long-lived species is due to electrons in the TiO2 that eventually recombine with the polysulfide electrolyte. Electron lifetimes are also shown to be longest in the co-sensitized devices in agreement with the larger Voc observed for these cells.

Broader context
The use of inexpensive materials and ease of fabrication are major “selling points” of the emerging photovoltaic technologies. In light of this, solar cells based on the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) are extremely promising. In this type of device the light absorbing function is fulfilled by semiconducting nanoparticles that are deposited by a sequential dipping procedure. Moreover the absorption can be modified by the appropriate selection of materials. Our work here focuses on investigations of charge transfer processes occurring in efficient TiO2/CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells using the polysulfide electrolyte where both CdS and CdSe are deposited via SILAR. A key finding from this study is that the regeneration of holes in CdS and CdSe by the electrolyte may limit efficiency in these devices.

Introduction
Harnessing recent advances in the development of nano-structured materials offers the possibility to fabricate ever more efficient photovoltaic devices.1 Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)2–6 are a leading example of this type of nascent technology with efficiencies of over 11% recorded.7,8 An alternative to using molecular sensitizers and thus bypassing time intensive synthesis and purification steps is to sensitize the metal-oxide with nanocrystalline quantum dots (QDs).9–11 Such materials which show quantum confinement properties and whose absorption and emission properties can be readily tuned via nanoparticle size can be prepared by well-known colloidal routes. Efficiencies of QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) using liquid electrolytes, though still some way off those of DSSCs, have steadily improved.9
An alternative method to colloidal QD preparation is the deposition of these semiconductor nanocrystalline materials via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).12 This process involving the sequential dipping of TiO2 electrodes in solutions containing precursors is extremely attractive from a processing and therefore industrial and commercial point of view. Furthermore, SILAR sensitized metal-oxide films generally show higher optical densities compared to films sensitized with colloidal QDs.13 Several studies of solar cells made using metal-oxide electrodes sensitized with semiconductor nanocrystals deposited using SILAR and employing a polysulfide based electrolyte have appeared recently.13–18 The current highest efficiency of over 4% was reported by Lee and Lo.14
In the present study nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cell devices co-sensitized with CdS and CdSe semiconductor nanocrystals deposited by SILAR are investigated. Moreover these devices are compared to devices containing CdS or CdSe only. Using a polysulfide electrolyte, an excellent efficiency of 3.60% was obtained for the co-sensitized device. Photo-induced electron transfer processes were investigated using Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS) and Transient Photovoltage (TPV) measurements and for the first time spectroscopic evidence of regeneration and the observation of a resultant long-lived species present in this type of cell under operational conditions are presented.
Experimental
TiO2 film preparation, sensitization via SILAR and device assembly
The photoanodes were prepared as described elsewhere.19 F-doped tin oxide (FTO, Hartford Glass inc. with 15 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance) conducting glass substrates were cleaned, calcined and ozone treated prior to spin casting with 0.2 M di-isopropoxy titanium bis(acetylacetonate) solution in anhydrous ethanol at 3000 rpm for one minute by which a dense underlayer of TiO2 was formed. The compact TiO2 layer was subsequently calcined at 450 °C for 30 minutes after which a layer of mesoporous TiO2 paste (Dyesol©, DSL 18NR-T) diluted in terpineol to optimum viscosity was deposited on top by screen printing using a synthetic 90T mesh screen. For optimized cells used to measure cell efficiency, IPCE and CE/TPV measurements the mesoporous layer thickness was approx. 9 μm and a 4 μm scattering layer of TiO2 (Dyesol©, DSL 18NR-AO) was also incorporated into the film with cell areas of around 0.16 cm2 used. For UV-Vis absorption and TAS measurements the samples consisted of 1 cm2 films of approx. 4 μm TiO2. All films were calcined at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min and cooled before commencing with SILAR.
All SILAR solutions were prepared under inert conditions. The CdS SILAR was performed following a slightly modified procedure by Hossain et al.,15 where the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a solution containing 0.02 M (0.617 gm in 100 mL) cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) in methanol for 1 minute and then rinsed with methanol for a further minute. The dried electrodes were then dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, Sigma Aldrich) in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) for 1 minute. The electrodes were then rinsed in methanol for 1 minute and dried again with N2. This procedure comprises one CdS SILAR cycle and was repeated six times in order to get a suitable CdS loading on the TiO2 electrode. The CdSe layer was sequentially deposited following the procedure used by Lee et al.20 30 mM Cd(NO3)2 in ethanol was prepared (0.93 gm Cd(NO3)2 in 100 mL). 100 mg of SeO2 was dissolved in 30 mL ethanol (30 mM), and purged/stirred for about 2 minutes and 70 mg of NaBH4 (60 mM) added into a round-bottomed flask containing SeO2, and purged/stirred until the colour changed from deep red to clear. The films were then dipped into these two solutions for 30 seconds each. In between each dipping the electrodes were rinsed with pure ethanol and dried. This was repeated for eight cycles after which a deep brown colour could be seen on the film surface. ZnS was deposited on top using 0.1 M (1.835 g in 100 mL) aqueous zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%) and 0.1 M aqueous (2.4 gm in 100 mL MilliQ water) Na2S·9H2O, dipping for 1 minute in each solution, with 1 minute of rinsing in deionized water between each immersion in the precursor solution. Two ZnS layers were deposited. The sensitized photoanodes were stored in a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere and dark conditions until they were used to make cells.
Device counter electrodes consisted of approx. 25 nm thick Au sputtered onto clean and calcined FTO glass slides at a deposition current of 30 mA and a rate of about 9 nm min−1. Prior to each measurement, cells were assembled by attaching the working and counter electrodes using a thermoplastic biphenyl frame (Surlyn), 60 μm thick, and the electrolyte introduced through a hole and sealed by a cover slide. The contacts at the electrodes were metal-plated by soldering. The electrolyte consisted of fresh polysulfide electrolyte prepared by dissolving 0.60 M Na2S, 0.20 M S, and 0.20 M KCl in water/methanol (3:7, v/v).
Spectroscopic measurements and device characterization
The UV-Vis absorption of films was measured using a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. The IV characteristics of cells were measured using a Sun 2000 Solar Simulator (150 W, ABET Technologies). The illumination intensity was measured to be 100 mW m−2 with a calibrated silicon photodiode. The appropriate filters were utilized to faithfully simulate the AM 1.5G spectrum. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The IPCE (Incident Photon to Current conversion Efficiency) was measured using a home made set up consisting of a 150 W Oriel Xenon lamp, a motorized monochromator and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter.
Charge extraction and transient photovoltage measurements
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction (CE) measurements were carried out on a system similar to that employed by O'Regan et al.21,22 Briefly, in CE measurements pulses of white light from a series of LEDs are applied to the cell which is allowed to reach a steady state for several seconds under open circuit conditions. When the LEDs are turned off the cell is immediately short circuited and the charge is extracted allowing electron density in the cells to be calculated. By changing the LED intensity the electron density can be estimated as a function of cell voltage. In TPV measurements a constant background voltage is applied to the cells and again an equilibrium is reached in the cell. However a diode pulse (660 nm, 10 mW) is then applied to the sample inducing a change of approx. 2 mV in the cell. The resulting photovoltage decay transients are collected and the τ values are determined by fitting the data to the equation exp (−t/τ). A programmable USB power supply changed the light bias from the LEDs, and a PCI-6251 card (National Instruments) was used for signal control and acquisition.
Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were similar to those carried out previously.23,24 The system consisted of a PTI nitrogen dye laser with tunable excitation wavelength. The cell (1 cm2 area) was placed between the two monochromators and a 150 W tungsten lamp was used as a light probe. A Costronics© Silicon detector connected to a Tektronic oscilloscope TDS 2022 and to an electronic filter box is used to monitor the change in absorbance after the laser pulse excitation.
Results and discussion
TiO2 film absorption
The absorption spectra of TiO2 films following SILAR treatment are shown in Fig. 1. Films were prepared with either CdS or CdSe alone or with both forming a co-sensitized film with the two different light absorbing materials. The number of SILAR cycles is indicated in parentheses. Absorption maxima at around 400 nm are observed in all cases (Fig. 1), however the absorption onset is quite different for CdS and CdSe, around 500 and 680 nm respectively. To harvest photons in the UV-vis region the need to use CdSe is quite apparent. The difference in absorption for the films is also clear to the naked eye as demonstrated in the digital photo (Fig. 1, inset). The best cell efficiencies obtained in this study were obtained with co-sensitized samples consisting of 6 cycles of CdS and 8 cycles of CdSe (see the next section). ZnS layers were also deposited onto films for optimized cells for measurements discussed in the following sections, however, they have negligible effect on film absorption. ZnS is used as a passivating layer.25 It is important to note that unlike colloidal quantum dots, a distinct absorption band corresponding to each of the semiconducting materials could not be observed suggesting perhaps polydispersed size distribution of nanocrystals for these materials. Therefore we shall refrain from referring to CdS and CdSe materials in these devices as QDs, and use the more generic term of semiconductor nanocrystals.

Cell IV and IPCE characterization

Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the IV curves and cell characteristics, namely Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and overall efficiency (η) for TiO2/CdS(6), TiO2/CdSe(8) and TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) cells. These results were very reproducible and indeed repeated a number of times. The number of SILAR cycles for the co-sensitized cell containing both CdS and CdSe was similar to those for efficient cells containing these materials in the literature.14–16 The efficiency for the TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) co-sensitized cell (3.20%) under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination compares rather favourably with efficiencies in similar studies reported elsewhere.14–16 These cells show higher photocurrents than either of the other two cells which is ascribed to improved light-harvesting, supported by the absorption spectra in Fig. 1. In addition they were also superior in terms of Voc. This is ascribed to the improved blocking of loss recombination pathways between photoinjected electrons in TiO2 and electrolyte when both CdS and CdSe are present on the nanocrystalline film.

In addition, a champion TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) cell with an efficiency of 3.60% was constructed. IV curves for this device under several illumination intensities are shown in Fig. 3 along with its IPCE spectrum under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination.

Fig. 4 shows the IPCE spectra for TiO2/CdS(6), TiO2/CdSe(8) and TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) cells shown in Fig. 2 under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination. In agreement with the IV data, the IPCE spectra indicate that the co-sensitized cell shows the highest photocurrent with over 50% photo-to-electron conversion efficiency between 440 and 600 nm. In fact when these spectra are integrated using the AM 1.5G solar spectrum the resultant current densities obtained compare extremely well with the Jsc values given in Table 1 with less than 5% error. The high IPCE can be correlated with the enhancement of the electron lifetime under illumination, data shown later in this work, for co-sensitized devices allowing better charge collection.

Stability of the TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) device
The stability of the TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) device was investigated by measuring IV curves immediately after cell assembly and after a further 3 hours. In between testing the sample was stored in the dark under ambient conditions. These IV curves are shown in Fig. 5 for the champion cell (Fig. 3) which showed an initial efficiency of approx. 3.60% at AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination.

Stability is a key issue for measuring kinetic parameters such as electron lifetime, charge collection and regeneration in photovoltaic devices under operating conditions. Moreover, most of the mentioned parameters depend on the charge density in the device at each bias (i.e. capacitance), which surely changes upon device degradation. Thus, it is paramount to use fast acquisition techniques that allow for the extraction of valuable data of the charge transfer processes that occur in these devices under such conditions (simulated AM 1.5G illumination) while devices are still operating prior to degradation. We among other research groups have shown that light-induced charge extraction techniques as well as photo-induced Voc decays allow for the collection of all data within a few minutes. Fig. 5 clearly indicates that data pertaining to cell processes occurring in the devices presented can be faithfully taken as occurring prior to the onset of any possible degradation pathway.
Charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements
In order to understand the differences in Voc observed for the cells CE and TPV measurements were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 6. TPV data were not collected for TiO2/CdS(6) as the laser excitation used (660 nm) for this measurement was beyond the absorption onset for this sample.

Differences in Voc can generally be explained by either shifts in the TiO2 conduction band edge (manifested by the shift of the exponential distribution of experimental data measured by CE) and/or by TiO2 electron recombination lifetimes (investigated via TPV measurements). In Fig. 6(a) all cells show nearly identical electron densities with little discernible shift in the TiO2 conduction band evident indicating that this cannot account for the different Voc values obtained for these cells. Rather, electron lifetimes explain the trend in Voc with TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) showing longer lifetimes at the same electron densities compared to TiO2/CdSe(8). It should be noted that the Voc of the TiO2/CdS(6) device (0.50 V) is almost the same as that of the co-sensitized TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) device (0.51 V) indicating that after the deposition of CdS nearly all of the TiO2 is covered blocking recombination between photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 and the polysulfide electrolyte. Therefore, the deposition of CdSe, though increasing photocurrent considerably, has negligible effect on cell voltage.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements
TAS was used to investigate charge transfer kinetics in the co-sensitized cell TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) and are shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  TAS data for TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) recorded following excitation at 450 nm (a) at 700 nm in the absence (black) and presence (red) of polysulfide electrolyte and (b) at 980 nm under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination at open circuit (red). The inset in (a) shows the difference absorption spectra recorded in the absence (black) and presence (red) of polysulfide electrolyte at 8 μs and 80 ms respectively. In plot (b) a TPV decay (blue) recorded under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination is also plotted for comparison. 
The kinetics in Fig. 7(a) in the absence of electrolyte (black decay) are ascribed to simple charge recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 film with holes in CdS and CdSe following photoexcitation. These kinetics are faster than those generally observed for similar devices based on dye sensitizers26,27 (such as N3/N719) though still rather long-lived attributed to trapping/detrapping of electrons in the nanocrystalline TiO2 film.28 Moreover these kinetics are similar to those observed for devices based on colloidal QD sensitizers which we have investigated previously.29 The kinetics recorded in the presence of the polysulfide electrolyte (red decay) are somewhat accelerated at faster timescales (1–100 μs) followed by a rather flat signal at slower timescales (1 ms to 1 s). The former is ascribed to regeneration of holes in CdS and CdSe by the electrolyte and the latter the presence of the resultant holes in the electrolyte and/or electrons in the TiO2 film. Similar bi-phasic kinetics have been reported for complete DSSC devices previously,30 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such kinetics have been reported for nanocrystalline TiO2 cells sensitized with semi-conductor nanoparticles deposited by SILAR and based on the polysulfide electrolyte which leads the way for further studies of regeneration kinetics in these cells. Furthermore, these regeneration kinetics recorded under low light intensities are much slower than kinetics for Ru(II) polypyridal and organic dyes recorded under similar conditions (see ESI†). This indicates that regeneration may be a problem in these devices. The inset in Fig. 7(a) shows the rather flat featureless difference absorption spectra recorded for TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) in the presence and absence of polysulfide electrolyte.
In Fig. 7(b) transient absorption kinetics for a TiO2/CdS(6)/CdSe(8) device at 980 nm under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination (provided by a series of LEDs) at open circuit are compared to a TPV decay recorded under almost identical conditions for the same sample in the TPV system. (This was recently done by Anderson et al.).31 It is clear that the decay of the long-lived signal of the TAS and TPV decay correspond rather well. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the long-lived signal in the TAS kinetics is that of electrons in the TiO2.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated that, through SILAR methodology, it is feasible to achieve in a reproducible manner devices of 3.2% light-to-energy conversion efficiency. Moreover, we have shown that these devices are stable over several hours allowing fast spectroscopic techniques to be used to study the key parameters that control device Voc as well as the interfacial charge transfer recombination dynamics. However the stability of these devices over longer periods is still largely unknown and further work on improving the device stability is necessary and, perhaps, the use more stable electrolytes such as the novel cobalt(II)/cobalt(III) redox pair32 could be an option. Finally, TAS data for these devices in the presence of the polysulfide electrolyte indicate that regeneration may not be as efficient as in their counterparts using dyes as the sensitizer and iodide/tri-iodide as the redox couple. Novel strategies to shift holes from the inner layers of the CdS/CdSe light absorbing material to the outer layer will improve this key reaction and, thus, improve the device performance. Moreover, the effect of the ZnS passivating layer on regeneration should also be considered, and if detrimental, alternatives sought.

Broader context
The use of inexpensive materials and ease of fabrication are major “selling points” of the emerging photovoltaic technologies. In light of this, solar cells based on the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) are extremely promising. In this type of device the light absorbing function is fulfilled by semiconducting nanoparticles that are deposited by a sequential dipping procedure. Moreover the absorption can be modified by the appropriate selection of materials. Our work here focuses on investigations of charge transfer processes occurring in efficient TiO2/CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells using the polysulfide electrolyte where both CdS and CdSe are deposited via SILAR. A key finding from this study is that the regeneration of holes in CdS and CdSe by the electrolyte may limit efficiency in these devices.
