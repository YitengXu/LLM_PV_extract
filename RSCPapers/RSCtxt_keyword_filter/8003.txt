    , Accepted 23rd May 2016First published on 23rd May 2016AbstractTwo wide band gap (WBG) polymers based on thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) units, PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, were synthesized. Both polymers showed absorption onsets at 635 nm in solid films. Although PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz are WBG materials with relatively narrow absorption spectra, they have great potential for constructing high-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). By replacing the alkyl side chain of PBT-TTz with an alkylthiol side chain, the HOMO level of PBT-S-TTz was lowered to −5.45 eV. A PCE of 7.92% was then obtained in a single-junction PSC device based on a PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layer. Moreover, high-performance fullerene-free PSCs were fabricated using these polymers and a high PCE of 8.22% was achieved. This work demonstrates that TTz-based polymers PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz are promising candidates as efficient WBG polymers for constructing high-performance PSC devices.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as possible future energy sources due to their low cost, easy fabrication, light weight and ability to produce large-area devices.1–5 The optical band gap determines the light absorption limit of a particular polymer and is a key parameter for the active layer material for PSCs. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to developing low band gap (LBG) polymers for PSCs because their broad absorption spectra are helpful to ensure efficient light-harvesting. This can increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of photovoltaic devices.6–9 However, narrowing the band gap of a polymer will increase the intrinsic energy loss. This is generally referred to as thermalization of charge carriers generated by the absorption of high-energy photons and usually leads to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LBG polymer-based PSCs.10,11 Moreover, in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, the photon-generated excitons (electron/hole pairs) with higher energy than the band gaps of active layer materials relax to the band-edge and then separate into free charges. Thus, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of LBG polymer-based PSC devices are always very low. In comparison with LBG polymers, PSC devices based on wide band gap (WBG) polymers have high Voc and EQE with great potential in PSC applications.
If the absorbed solar photons are utilized efficiently, then the PSC devices based on WBG polymers can also achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) due to their narrow absorption spectra. Fig. 1 shows the solar irradiation spectrum in photon flux as a function of wavelength. Assuming that all photons are absorbed up to the band gap and converted into one electron in an external circuit, the maximum theoretical current density can be calculated and the corresponding integral is shown on the right y-axis in Fig. 1. Notably, a high Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2 can be achieved only by utilizing the photons in the wavelength within 650 nm. More importantly, PSCs based on WBG polymers are favorable to outputting high Voc.12–14 As is known, the Voc of a PSC device can be estimated by the following empirical equation,15 Voc = (1/e)EDonorg − 0.6 V (ref. 15)(1)where e is the elementary charge, and 0.6 V is derived from the required energy for charge carrier dissociation and the empirical factor in voltage loss related to charge transport.16,17 Therefore, PSCs based on a 2.0 eV band gap polymer donor can theoretically yield a high Voc of 1.4 V. Considering the theoretical Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2 and a typical value of 65% for the fill factor (FF), a high PCE of 16.6% can be expected in the PSCs based on 2.0 eV band gap polymers. However, PCEs of PSC devices based on WBG polymers are currently far below the theoretical values, and the development of WBG polymers lags behind their LBG counterparts. Thus, the development of highly efficient WBG polymers is of considerable significance for applications in high-performance PSCs.

P3HT is a polymer with a band gap of 1.90 eV. It is mostly used as the WBG material in PSCs.18–20 With optimal device fabrication conditions, the P3HT:indene-C70 bis-adduct (IC71BA)-based PSC showed a high PCE of 7.4% in the PSC device.21 Recently, we attached electron-withdrawing carboxylate substituents to polythiophene—a WBG polymer with a 1.90 eV band gap. The product was PDCBT, and the corresponding device showed a PCE of 6.9% in PSCs.22 Moreover, Price et al. synthesized a WBG polymer PBnDT-FTAZ with a band gap of 1.98 eV and achieved a PCE of 7.1% in PSCs.23 The band gaps of several typical WBG polymers and the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding PSCs are listed in Table 1.

In the recent two years, rapid progress has been made in PSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors.27–29 PCEs over 8% in fullerene-free PSCs have been reported by several groups, which are comparable to those of the fullerene-based PSCs.30,31 It is well recognized that suitable electronic energy levels and complementary absorption spectra from the donor–acceptor pair are very critical for making high-performance fullerene-free PSCs.32 In fullerene-free PSCs, the high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of WBG polymers can appropriately match those of the typical non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC33 and N2200;34 this ensures efficient exciton dissociation and maximizes Voc of the resulting devices. Moreover, since many efficient non-fullerene acceptors exhibit absorption bands in the 600–800 nm region, the WBG polymer donor materials with absorption spectra complementary to those of the non-fullerene acceptors are strongly desired for achieving optimal light harvesting.
Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new WBG polymer donor materials: PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the two polymers were synthesized based on thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]dithiophene (BDT) units. The HOMO level of the PBT-S-TTz could be lowered if the alkyl side chain of the polymer PBT-TTz was replaced with an alkylthiol side chain. We realized the high PCE of photovoltaic devices based on these WBG polymers using phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and ITIC as acceptors. In the PSCs using PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blends as active layers, a PCE of 7.92% together with a high Jsc of 12.39 mA cm−2 was achieved in the PBT-S-TT:PC71BM-based PSC. Considering that the absorption onset of PBT-S-TTz is at 635 nm, the Jsc obtained from the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layer is close to the theoretical value, suggesting a highly effective utilization of the solar photons. We further fabricated high-performance fullerene-free PSCs using ITIC as the acceptor. A PCE of 8.22% with a Jsc of 15.02 mA cm−2 was achieved in the fullerene-free PSCs based on the PBT-S-TTz:ITIC active layer. The high efficiency of the PBT-S-TTz:ITIC-based fullerene-free PSCs was attributed to the complementary absorption spectra between the donor–acceptor pair and the high extinction coefficients of PBT-S-TTz in solid films. These results suggest that PBT-S-TTz is capable of pairing with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors in constructing high-performance PSC devices.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz copolymers were synthesized by the Stille-coupling reaction as shown in Scheme 2. The two polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene. Fig. S1† shows the structures of PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz via1H NMR. Molecular weight of the two polymers was determined by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 145 °C using polystyrene as the standard. The number average molecular weight was 14.2 K and 13.7 K for PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, respectively. The thermal properties of the polymers were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen (Fig. S2†), with decomposition temperatures at 441 °C and 370 °C for PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, respectively. The thermal stability of both polymers is adequate for the fabrication processes of PSCs and other applications in optoelectronic devices.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized optical absorption spectra of the TTz-based copolymers in dilute chloroform solution and in solid films are shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b).† The corresponding absorption maxima (λmax) are listed in Table 2. PBT-TTz showed similar absorption spectra in solution to those in solid films in which two absorption peaks at 544 nm and 589 nm were observed. Versus PBT-TTz, the absorption peaks exhibited a slight red-shift of ∼8 nm in the PBT-S-TTz; this might be ascribed to the extended conjugation length and the enhanced π–π stacking effect of the polymer backbone. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2(a), the maximum extinction coefficients of PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz in solid films are 1.13 × 105 cm−1 and 1.40 × 105 cm−1, respectively—these are among the highest values in organic semiconductors.35,36 Apparently, the high molar extinction coefficients of the polymers can ensure effective light-harvesting in PSC devices. As typical WBG materials, both polymers have narrow absorption spectra with absorption onsets at 635 nm in solid films. The band gaps (Eg) of the polymers PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz were estimated to be ca. 1.95 eV from the absorption onset in the film spectra.

The molecular energy levels of polymers PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 2(b), the HOMO values of PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials.37 These were −5.41 eV and −5.45 eV, respectively. The HOMO level of PBT-S-TTz decreased slightly versus PBT-TTz. This indicates that the alkylthiol substituents on the thiophene side chains influence the electronic properties of the conjugated polymer. Generally, electron-donating side chains, such as alkylthio groups, can donate some electron density to the conjugated polymer backbones, which makes the polymer HOMO level down-shifted by ca. 0.1 eV compared to that of the alkyl substituted polymer.38,39 The LUMO values of −3.46 eV for PBT-TTz and −3.50 eV for PBT-S-TTz were determined via the differences between the HOMO and the optical band gap. Theoretical calculations were also performed with density functional theory (DFT) to predict the electronic properties and energy levels. The frontier molecular orbitals and optimized molecular geometries are illustrated in Fig. S3.† Although the calculated HOMO energy levels were much higher than the measured ones, the trend in variation for molecular orbital energy levels is consistent with the results obtained via CV.
X-ray diffraction

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz copolymers. The distinct primary strong peaks (100) at ca. 2θ = 5.13° and 4.70° were related to the polymer lamellar spacing and correspond to a d-spacing of 17.22 Å and 18.79 Å for PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, respectively. The lamellar spacing of PBT-S-TTz is slightly larger than that of PBT-TTz because the sulfur atom in the alkylthiol substituents extends the length of the side chains in PBT-S-TTz. Therefore, compared to PBT-TTz, the lamellar distance between the polymer backbones is further stretched by the alkylthiol side chains in the PBT-S-TTz film. Meanwhile, the intensity of the peak (100) of the PBT-S-TTz film is much higher than that of the PBT-TTz film, suggesting a more ordered lamellar stacking of the polymer backbones in the PBT-S-TTz film. The (010) diffraction peaks were located at ca. 2θ = 24.41° and 25.34°. This corresponds to the π–π stacking distance of 3.64 Å and 3.51 Å for PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, respectively. The face-to-face distance of PBT-S-TTz is smaller than that of the PBT-TTz in solid films. This indicates a more compact π–π stacking in the PBT-S-TTz film. Apparently, the compact π–π stacking of the PBT-S-TTz film is beneficial for exciton diffusion and inter-chain charge transport. This usually plays an important role in improving the device performance.

Fullerene-based PSC performances
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz, the fullerene-based PSC devices were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Mg/Al. All the active layers were spin-coated from the polymer:PC71BM solutions in chlorobenzene (CB), and the thickness of the active layers is 110 ± 5 nm. The detailed optimization process is provided in the ESI (Fig. S5 and Table S1†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best PSC devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4, and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. For the PSC devices based on PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layers, we found that the optimal D/A ratios (polymer/PC71BM) were both 1:1.5. At the 1:1.5 blend ratio, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used to further improve the cell performance, and the best photovoltaic results were obtained when 3% DIO was added.

The photovoltaic device based on PBT-TTz showed a PCE of 7.21%, while the PBT-S-TTz-based device had a PCE of 7.92%. As expected, the PBT-S-TTz-based device displayed a slightly higher Voc of 0.936 V than the PBT-TTz-based device (Voc = 0.899 V) due to the deeper HOMO level of PBT-S-TTz. Notably, the Jsc of the PBT-S-TTz-based device was also higher than that of the PBT-TTz:-based device. Obviously, compared with the PBT-TT-based device, the higher PCE attained in the PBT-S-TTz-based photovoltaic device resulted mainly from the simultaneous enhancement of Voc and Jsc. The Jsc of 12.39 mA cm−2 obtained in the PBT-S-TTz-based device was among the highest values for the photovoltaic devices of TTz-based polymers. As shown in Fig. 1, a solar cell with a response onset at 635 nm can theoretically produce a Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2. Considering that the indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate can reflect and absorb solar photons, the Jsc obtained in the PBT-S-TTz-based device is close to the theoretical value.
To understand the high Jsc values in the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM-based device, we first measured the hole mobilities (μhole) of the blend films of the polymers and PC71BM by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.40 The μhole values of the PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM films are estimated to be 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 m−1 and 7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 m−1, respectively (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). Apparently, higher Jsc of the PBT-S-TTz-based device should not be derived from the hole mobility.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs based on PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz prepared by the optimal conditions are plotted in Fig. 5(a). The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves were 11.10 mA cm−2 for the PBT-TTz-based device and 11.91 mA cm−2 for the PBT-S-TTz-based device, which agree well with those values obtained from the J–V curves. In the PBT-S-TTz-based device, a maximum EQE of 83.4% at 500 nm was recorded, while in the PBT-TTz-based device, the maximum EQE was 78.2% at 540 nm. The EQE of the PBT-S-TTz-based device is higher than that of the PBT-TTz-based device from 350 nm to 650 nm. The higher EQE agrees well with the higher Jsc and better performance of the PBT-S-TTz-based device. Moreover, the EQE results are consistent with the spectra data, in which the molar extinction coefficients of the PBT-S-TTz film are higher than those of the PBT-TTz film from 350 nm to 650 nm. Consequently, the higher Jsc of the PBT-S-TTz-based device could be ascribed to the higher absorption coefficient of PBT-S-TTz. We measured the optical densities (O.D.) of the active layers, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The O.D. of the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blend is higher than that of the PBT-TTz:PC71BM through the whole response range, i.e. 300 nm to 900 nm. The PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layer showed O.D. above 50% in the wavelength range from 500 nm to 620 nm. The high O.D. of the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layer improved the EQE of the PBT-S-TTz-based PSC device. These results suggested that TTz and its derivatives are indeed promising units for developing efficient wide band gap photovoltaic materials in high-performance PSCs.

It is well known that a bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the BHJ is crucial to form channels for the transport of both holes and electrons;41 therefore, the morphology of the active layer plays a critical role in improving the device performance. As shown in Fig. 6, the morphologies of polymer:PC71BM blends (weight ratio 1:1.5) processed from CB with and without DIO (3% by volume) as processing additives were investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the AFM images (see Fig. 6(a) and (c)), we observed that the surface of both PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blend films without the DIO additive showed uniform and very smooth morphologies with moderate phase separation. The mean square surface roughness (Rq) of PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blend films without DIO is 1.23 nm and 1.06 nm, respectively. After adding 3% (by volume) DIO additive, both of the blend films show a stronger phase separation and the RMS roughness of the PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blend films increased to 3.09 nm and 2.36 nm, respectively. Obviously, the DIO additive had a similar influence on optimizing the phase-separated morphologies in both the PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM films. This promotes the formation of the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks in the BHJ.
 Fig. 6  AFM topography images (2 μm × 2 μm) (a–d) and TEM images (e–h) of the polymer:PC71BM blend films (1:1.5 w/w): (a and e) for the PBT-TTz:PC71BM film processed by pure CB; (b and f) for the PBT-TTz:PC71BM film processed with 3% DIO; (c and g) for the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM film processed by pure CB; (d and h) for the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM film processed with 3% DIO. 
The TEM images also revealed the beneficial effect of DIO additive on the interpenetrating networks of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 6(f)–(h), the TEM images correlated well with the morphologies observed by AFM. Upon the addition of DIO, phase aggregations on the order of tens of nanometers were observed in both the PBT-TTz:PC71BM and PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM blend films. This phase-separated scale is on the same order with the exciton diffusion length, which is favorable for charge separation and transport, so that the high Jsc could be achieved. These results indicated that the morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blend films could be optimized by using a DIO additive, and such an appropriate phase-separated morphology of the active layer was beneficial to the high Jsc of the PSC devices.
Furthermore, the PCEs of the unencapsulated devices were periodically measured for 10 days to monitor their long-term stabilities. As shown in Fig. S8,† the PSC devices retained 74% of the initial PCE for the PBT-TTz-based device and 71% for the PBT-S-TTz-based device after 10 days. Considering that the decline in the PCEs might be caused by the corrosion effect of the acidic PEDOT:PSS interlayer on ITO, we further fabricated inverted devices using neutral MoO3 as the interlayer. The structure of the inverted PSC devices was ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. Compared with the conventional devices, the inverted devices exhibited higher stability, retaining 81% of their initial PCE values for both the PBT-TTz-based and PBT-S-TTz-based devices.
Fullerene-free PSC performances
The superior photovoltaic performances of the WBG polymers in fullerene-based PSCs inspire us to explore their applications in fullerene-free PSCs. As shown in Fig. 7, ITIC was selected as the fullerene-free acceptor because of its high electron mobility and high electron affinity. More importantly, the combination of the WBG polymer (PBT-TTz or PBT-S-TTz) and ITIC has well-matched complementary absorption peaks that completely cover the broad wavelength range from 300 to 850 nm. Fullerene-free PSC devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/Ca/Al, and the best performing PSCs can be obtained by using the D/A weight ratio of 1:1. The active layers were spin-cast from chlorobenzene solution, followed by thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min. Unlike fullerene-based PSCs, adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive has no effect on enhancing the PCEs of the fullerene-free PSCs.
 Fig. 7  Architecture of the non-fullerene device and the molecular structure of ITIC. 
The J–V curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 8(a) and the corresponding data are listed in Table 4. A maximum PCE of 8.22% and an average PCE of 7.91% were achieved in the optimized PBT-S-TTz:ITIC devices. The enhanced performance of PBT-S-TTz-based devices is largely a result of the simultaneously enhanced Voc and Jsc compared to the PBT-TTz-based devices. The best PSC device based on PBT-S-TTz:ITIC exhibits a high Voc of 0.971 V that is mainly attributed to the low-lying HOMO level of the polymer donor. The Jsc of the PBT-S-TTz-based device was measured to be 14.93 mA cm−2, suggesting that the complementary absorption strategy is helpful to achieve high Jsc in fullerene-free PSCs. We measured the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PSC devices, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Both kinds of PSC devices have broad responses in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves were 11.75 mA cm−2 for the PBT-TTz-based device and 15.02 mA cm−2 for the PBT-S-TTz-based device, respectively. The EQE of the PBT-S-TTz-based device is higher than that of the PBT-TTz-based device from 300 nm to 750 nm, which could be ascribed to the high absorption coefficient of polymer PBT-S-TTz; this improved the EQE of the PBT- S-TTz-based device.

The morphological characteristics of the polymer:ITIC blend films were investigated using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S7,† the PBT-S-TTz:ITIC blend film possesses a relatively smoother surface with a root mean square roughness (Rrms) of 1.71 nm, while the PBT-TTz:ITIC film showed a rough surface with a Rrms of 2.72 nm. The smooth surface of the PBT-S-TTz:ITIC active layers indicates the good miscibility of the PBT-S-TTz donor and ITIC acceptor, which should account for its observed superior device performance. In the TEM measurements, both blends showed distinct nanoscaled phase-separated D/A interpenetrating networks around tens of nanometers, which is favorable for realizing efficient exciton dissociations in fullerene-free PSC devices.
The stabilities of the conventional and inverted fullerene-free devices were investigated, as shown in Fig. S9.† For the conventional fullerene-free devices, the device performance retained 86% for PBT-TTz:ITIC and 83% for PBT-S-TTz:ITIC after 10 days. Compared with the conventional devices, the inverted fullerene-free devices showed better device stabilities with 89% of the initial efficiency for the PBT-TTz-based fullerene-free device and 92% for the PBT-S-TTz-based fullerene-free device.
Conclusions
In summary, two new wide band gap polymers (PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz) were synthesized based on TTz units. The polymers PBT-TTz and PBT-S-TTz showed narrow absorption bands from 300 nm to 635 nm. By replacing the alkyl side chain of the PBT-TTz with the alkylthiol side chain, the HOMO level of PBT-S-TTz was lowered to −5.45 eV, and then a PCE of 7.92% in the single-junction PSC device based on the PBT-S-TTz:PC71BM active layer was achieved. Furthermore, the high PCE of 8.22% obtained from the PBT-S-TTz:ITIC-based PSC device suggested that the combination of a WBG polymer and a LBG acceptor with complementary absorptions is an effective strategy to achieve a high Voc and Jsc simultaneously in fullerene-free PSCs. Therefore, this work represents a successful example of developing advanced WBG polymers for constructing high efficiency fullerene-free PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
The two BDT monomers were synthesized by the reported methods.42,43 The monomer (2,5-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole) was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. Pd(PPh3)4 was purchased from Frontier Scientific Inc. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was purchased from Orgatec Materials, Inc. All of the commercially available compounds and reagents were used without any further purification.
Synthesis procedure of the two polymers
Monomer 1 (1 mmol, 0.9046 g) and monomer 2 (1 mmol, 0.6887 g) were dissolved in 25 mL toluene in a two-neck flask. After flushing with argon for 10 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (40 mg) was added in one portion into the mixture. Then, the mixture was flushed with argon for another 15 min and stirred at 110 °C for 5 h under the protection of an argon atmosphere. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the polymer was precipitated by pouring into methanol and then filtered to collect the unpurified polymer. The resultant polymer was extracted by silica gel chromatography with chloroform as the eluent. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the concentrated solution was precipitated in 200 mL methanol and filtered to obtain polymer PBT-TTz for 701 mg with a yield of 44%.

Polymer PBT-S-TTz was synthesized by the same procedure used in the PBT-TTz. As a result, we obtained the polymer PBT-S-TTzfor 878 mg with a yield of 53%. Anal. calcd for C62H76N2S10: C, 63.65; H, 6.55; N, 2.39; S, 27.41. Found: C, 62.35; H, 6.39; N, 2.28; S, 26.43.
Instruments

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker advanceII-400 spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were measured on a TU-1901 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on a flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was implemented on a CHI650D Electrochemical Workstation. A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode, whereas a platinum wire was employed as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode. CV measurements were carried out in Bu4NPF6/acetonitrile (0.1 M) solution at ambient temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was performed on a Nanoscope V (Vecco) AFM in tapping mode in air. TGA measurements were conducted on a TGA-2050 from TA Instruments, Inc. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were probed by using a JEOL 2200FS instrument with an accelerating voltage of 160 kV.
Device fabrication and characterization
The PSC devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Mg (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated to investigate the optical properties of the two polymers. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 ohm per square was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in surfactant scrub, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. After ultraviolet-ozone cleaning for 18 min, a 35 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-coated onto the glass/ITO substrate and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min. After cooling to ambient temperature, the ITO substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. A solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 8 mg mL−1 was prepared and stirred for several hours for complete dissolution. The additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3 vol%) were added to the blend solution before spin-coating. Then the blend solution was spin-coated atop of the PEDOT:PSS layer to manufacture a 100 nm-thick active layer. Finally, 20 nm Mg and 100 nm Al were thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of ca. 3 × 10−4 pa. The device active area is ca. 3.6 mm2 for all the PSCs.
Fullerene-free solar cells were fabricated in a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/Ca/Al. ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, and subsequently dried in an oven overnight. The glass substrates were treated using UV-Ozone for 20 min before use. PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was spin cast from aqueous solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and then dried at 140 °C for 10 min in air. Subsequently, polymer:ITIC (1:1 weight ratio) in a 10 mg mL−1 chloroform solution was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 60 s. The optimal blend thickness was ∼110 nm, measured on a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer. Then, the device fabrication was completed by thermally evaporating 10 nm-thick Mg and 100 nm-thick aluminum under vacuum at a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The device active area is ca. 3.6 mm2 for all the fullerene-free PSCs.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with an Agilent B2912A Precision Source/Measure unit. The resulting PCEs of the PSCs were measured under one sun, AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), using an XES-70S1 (SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photobeam size). A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (KG3 filter) was purchased from VLSI standard. The EQE was measured by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
