    , Accepted 10th May 2019First published on 10th May 2019AbstractWe demonstrate that employing long alkyl chains perpendicular to the π-conjugated plane of the backbone is a promising strategy to construct efficient organic sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with efficient photovoltaic performance. The perpendicular alkyl chains have been suggested as superior alternatives to parallel alkyl chains for preventing intermolecular interactions in D–π–A dyes, and therefore co-adsorption with deoxycholic acid (DCA) can be avoided. DSSCs employing iodine/iodide electrolytes and an organic dye LJ-8 with long alkyl chains perpendicular to its π-conjugated plane produced a high photovoltage of 0.801 V and a high conversion efficiency over 8%.
Introduction
As a promising alternative to conventional photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention and have been investigated with the aim of achieving low cost and high efficiency.1 During the past two decades, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient sensitizers which play a crucial role in DSSCs.2 So far, there have been mainly two kinds of sensitizers, involving metal-complexes and metal-free organic dyes.3 Metal-complexes such as ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complexes (N3, N719, and black dye) and metal porphyrins show broad absorption spectra extending into the near-IR region and exhibit solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) of up to 13% under AM1.5 irradiation.4 However, the shortage of noble metal resources and the environmental issues would greatly limit their application prospects. In contrast, metal-free organic dyes have been gradually considered as more promising candidates for DSSCs due to their advantageous features, such as low cost, easily tunable absorptions and bandgaps and electrochemical properties through variation of their molecular structure, which typically consists of a donor-π-acceptor (D–π–A) system.5 Besides expanding the light absorption edge of the organic dyes for efficient light harvesting associated with short-circuit photocurrent,6 a valid concept toward achieving high η of DSSCs based on dyes is minimizing the interfacial losses with respect to open-circuit photovoltage.7 The low photovoltage is partially caused by dye aggregation resulting in intermolecular charge transfer, and charge recombination between the injected electrons and the acceptors (the dye cation and I3− ions).8 Coadsorption with bulk molecules, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), 1-decylphosphonic acid (DPA), and cyclodextrins (CD), has been frequently employed to suppress dye-aggregation and to improve their efficiency.9 However, the co-adsorption strategy requires strict optimization of the adsorption conditions (e.g. solvents, dyes and additive concentrations), reduces the dye coverage rate and is hard to drive the ordered assembly (one to one match) on the TiO2 surface.10 As another solution, molecular engineering of organic sensitizers by the introduction of long alky chains into the dye backbone has been intensively investigated.11 However, this strategy claimed the consideration of the chain length and the number, as well as the substitution position. For instance, a famous dye MK-2 with four hexylthiophene groups was found to show a successful advancement in retarding charge recombination by molecular engineering and exhibited efficient photovoltaic performance,11a but its analogues MK-4, MK-5, MK-7, and MK-8 cannot perform efficiently.12a Moreover, alkyl chains cannot suppress the intermolecular interactions completely due to their orientation, and in some cases, the alkylation decreases their efficiencies in comparison with pristine dyes.12 Therefore, the development of a valid method for the suppression of dye aggregation is still a big challenge. Herein, we envisage that using substituents perpendicular to the π-conjugated backbone may be a superior strategy to construct high efficiency dyes without additive engineering.
In order to confirm our assumption, we employed oligothiophene as a π-conjugated backbone, which was often used to develop efficient sensitizers for DSSCs. On the other hand, it has been investigated that the phenyl substituent is almost perpendicular to the thiophene plane in 3-phenylthiophene due to its inherent cross-conjugation properties.13 Therefore, it is reasonable to employ alkyl chains on the phenyl group at the β-positions of the thiophene moieties perpendicular to the π-conjugated backbone. In this context, we design three new D–π–A dyes employing substituted oligothiophene as a π-spacer for DSSCs, and investigated the relationship between the substituents and the photovoltaic performance, particularly focusing on the effect of the orientation of the alky chains on the photovoltaic performance.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of three D–π–A dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 was achieved via bromination, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions in a moderated yield by rational routes shown in Scheme 1. Two substituted bithiophene derivatives 1a and 1b were prepared according to a reported method.14 Compound 5 was used as received from chemical companies without further purification. Bromination of the substituted bithiophene 1a and 1b with NBS produced the desired compounds 2a and 2b,15 respectively. Compounds 2a, 2b and 5 were allowed to react with 5-formylthiophene-2-boronic acid to synthesize aldehydes 3a, 3b and 6,16 respectively. Suzuki coupling between the resulting aldehydes (3a, 3b and 6) and 9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-ylboronic acid produced dye precursors 4a, 4b and 7, which were converted to dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 as black solids via Knoevenagel condensation, respectively. The structures of the desired organic sensitizers were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

The absorption spectra of three new D–π–A dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 1, and the data are summarized in Table 1. The three new dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 exhibit two distinct absorption bands: the longer wavelength absorption band in the visible region (440–500 nm) that can be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the carbazole donating group to the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring moiety; the shorter wavelength absorption band in the UV region (360–400 nm) is attributed to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated molecules as well as the overlapped n–π* electron transitions. There was no obvious difference between the absorption spectra of LJ-7 and LJ-8. Owing to the longer alkyl chains in the electron-donating aromatic substituents on the conjugated oligothiophene backbone, dye LJ-8 exhibits a slight bathochromic shift and a little higher molar extinction coefficient (ε) in comparison with its analogue LJ-7. However the spectra of LJ-9 show an approximately 50 nm bathochromic shift and a lower ε value relative to those of LJ-7 and LJ-8. Without regard to the solvent effect, we suggest that the different kinds of substituted groups on the conjugated oligothiophene backbone of dye LJ-9 and the former two dyes (LJ-7 and LJ-8) led to significant diversity in the configuration of the dye skeleton, which is further discussed in detail in the DFT calculations (vide infra). All the three new D–π–A dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 exhibit similar emission in CH2Cl2 solution but different Stokes shifts (Fig. S1, ESI†). Among these three new dyes, dye LJ-9 exhibits the largest Stokes shift, which indicates the significant structural reorganization of the dye molecule upon photoexcitation and the high degree of rotational freedom in dye LJ-9.17 In contrast, dye LJ-8 exhibits the smallest Stokes shift probably due to the relatively rigid configuration of the dye molecule.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 adsorbed on TiO2 films with or without DCA are shown in Fig. 2. The λmax values for the dye-loaded TiO2 films are also listed in Table 1. After being adsorbed on the TiO2 film, the maximum absorption of the dyes anchored on the TiO2 film exhibits an approximately 40 nm hypsochromic shift in comparison with that in solution. Such a blue shift could be assigned to the solvent effect and/or deprotonation of the carboxylic acid in the anchoring process.18 The influence of the co-adsorption of DCA on the TiO2 surface in the absorption spectra has been investigated (Fig. 2). After coadsorption with DCA, the intensity of the ICT band for these three new dyes reduces, which could be attributed to the decrease of the dye-loading amount during the DCA coadsorption.8b Both dipping in the solution with and without DCA, dialkoxyphenyl substituted dyes LJ-7 and LJ-8 show fine absorption peaks similar to those in solution, suggesting that the steric hindrance of the dialkoxyphenyl groups is effective to suppress the intermolecular interactions effectively. However, the situation of dye LJ-9 employing two hexyl chains is slightly different. Without co-adsorption, the absorption spectrum of LJ-9 is broadened. The results suggest that the hexyl groups on the conjugated oligothiophene backbone of dye LJ-9 are not effective enough to suppress the intermolecular interaction and/or dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface, which will be prevented by means of coadsorption with DCA. The probable reason is further provided by molecular structure analysis (vide infra).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as a supporting electrolyte to investigate the electrochemical properties of three new D–π–A dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9. As shown in Fig. 3, all the dyes exhibit two reversible oxidation waves. Since these three new dyes employ the same donor part and a similar D–π–A skeleton, their HOMO levels corresponding to the first oxidation potentials show little difference, increasing in the order of LJ-8 (0.93 V) < LJ-7 (0.97 V) < LJ-9 (1.01 V), which was associated with the electron-donating ability of the corresponding substituent on the conjugated oligothiophene backbone in these three dyes. The energy-level diagram of the dyes, the electrolyte and TiO2 is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The HOMO levels of these three dyes are all more positive than the Nernst potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring regeneration of the oxidized dyes by I− after electron injection, with a driving force of 0.53–0.61 V. The LUMO levels corresponding to the excited state redox potentials of these three dyes (−1.09 to −1.14 V vs. NHE) are sufficiently more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring a sufficient driving force (0.59–0.64 V) for electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. These results suggested the potential application of these three new sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells.5e

To explain the different absorption properties between dialkyoxyphenyl substituted dye LJ-7 or LJ-8 and hexyl substituted dye LJ-9, we further investigate the optimized configuration of dyes LJ-8 and LJ-9 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The optimized ground-state geometries and the dihedral angles between the π-conjugated units indicated that the configurations of the bithiophene units connecting the donor moieties were different in dyes LJ-8 and LJ-9 (Fig. S3, ESI†). Two flexible hexyl β-substituents in LJ-9 caused large dihedral twisting of the bithiophene units (torsion angle, 62.5°). In contrast, in LJ-8, the two dibutoxyphenyl groups and the bithiophene backbone seem to restrain each other and hamper the rotation around the thiophene–thiophene bond, so that the thiophene units were relatively rigid and twists would be restricted, which facilitated ICT, as suggested by the absorption properties described above. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the hexyl chains are horizontal to the corresponding thiophene planes in dye LJ-9, and they cannot prevent the intermolecular π–π interaction and/or dye aggregation completely even though two thiophene units are twisted, which was suggested by the broad absorption spectra of the TiO2 film in the presence of coadsorption with DCA. However, four butyl chains are located on two sides of the thiophene planes and perpendicular to the π-conjugated backbone in dye LJ-8, which are effective to suppress the intermolecular interaction and/or charge transfer. Moreover, the DFT calculations of dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 are carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G** level to gain further insight into their frontier molecular orbitals. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the LUMOs show localized electron distributions through the cyanoacrylic acid and its adjacent π-spacer, whereas the HOMOs are mainly delocalized from the donor parts to the oligothiophene π-spacer. Hence, both orbitals have sufficient overlap between the donor and the acceptor to guarantee a fast charge transfer transition.
The device fabrication and characterization were performed according to our previous method,15,16 which is detailed in the ESI.† The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs based on dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 and the influence of DCA co-adsorption on their photovoltaic performances were investigated,19 employing a solution of 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The device performance statistics is provided in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which suggested that the reproducibility of devices based on pristine dyes was slightly better than that of those with DCA coadsorption.
The onset wavelength of the IPCE spectra shifts toward the red region in the order LJ-9 < LJ-7 < LJ-8 cells (Fig. 4), in accordance with the absorption spectra observed for the dye-loaded TiO2 films. DSSCs based on dialkoxyphenyl substituted dyes LJ-7 and LJ-8 without coadsorption show a similar maximum IPCE value observed in the range of 400–600 nm in comparison with those upon coadsorption with DCA. However, in the case of hexyl substituted dye LJ-9, the IPCE value increased after the coadsorption with DCA. These results implied that the alkyl chains perpendicular to the π-conjugated plane of dyes LJ-7 and LJ-8 are efficient to retard the dye-aggregation and/or intermolecular interaction for efficient electron injection, whereas that in LJ-9 should be achieved by coadsorption with DCA. This phenomenon was similar to that reported previously.8b As shown in Fig. S6, ESI† the integrated photocurrent values calculated from the IPCE of DSSCs based on LJ-7, LJ-7-DCA, LJ-8, LJ-8-DCA, LJ-9 and LJ-9-DCA were 12.85 mA cm−2, 12.54 mA cm−2, 13.1 mA cm−2, 12.28 mA cm−2, 10.27 mA cm−2 and 10.88 mA cm−2, respectively. The results were close to the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the corresponding devices measured by J–V characterizations at 100 mW cm−2, under simulated AM1.5G conditions (Table 2 and Fig. 5).

J–V curves of DSSCs based on LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 with/without DCA coadsorption. 
The open-circuit voltages (VOC) of DSSCs based on the pristine dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 are 0.738 V, 0.801 V and 0.715 V, respectively. After coadsorption with DCA, the VOC of DSSCs based on LJ-7 and LJ-9 increases to 0.747 V and 0.751 V, respectively, whereas that of the LJ-8 based device decreases to 0.751. The different influence of DCA coadsorption on the VOC of DSSCs based on these three dyes implied the various effects of coadsorption on charge recombination rates, which were further investigated by the measurement of electron lifetimes (τe) in the conduction band of TiO2 by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). As shown in Fig. 6, the τe values of the DSSCs based on pristine dyes vary in the order of LJ-8 > LJ-7 > LJ-9, suggesting that the long alkyl chains perpendicular to the π-conjugated plane of organic dyes (LJ-7 and LJ-8) are superior to those in the parallel mode (dye LJ-9) for suppression of charge recombination between I3− and the injected electron in TiO2.
 Fig. 6  Electron lifetime (τe) as a function of VOC for DSSCs based on dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 with and without DCA coadsorption. 
As shown in Fig. 7, we proposed the possible mechanisms of the influence of DCA on the dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface and the photovoltaic properties. For dyes LJ-7 and LJ-8, the intermolecular energy transfer may be prevented by the steric hindrance being perpendicular to the π-conjugated plane of organic dyes even without DCA, leading to a high IPCE value. On the other hand, upon coadsorption with DCA during the dipping process, the photocurrent decreased slightly. This is probably attributed to the decrease in the dye loading amount on the TiO2 surface because the DCA molecules occupied a part of the TiO2 surface area. In contrast, dye LJ-9 with two hexyl groups attached on the dye backbone cannot retard the intermolecular interactions and/or dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface completely without DCA, which resulted in the photocurrent and photovoltage loss due to the intermolecular energy transfer and excited-state quenching of the dye, as well as serious charge recombination.20 After co-adsorption with DCA, it is expected that the intermolecular energy-transfer between dye LJ-9 molecules was efficiently suppressed, and the photocurrent was therefore improved even though the dye loading amount decreased. The enhancement of VOC of the devices based on LJ-7 and LJ-9 after DCA coadsorption was mainly attributed to the increasing blocking effect. In the case of LJ-8, two long alkyl chains being perpendicular to the dye backbone would assemble a dense blocking layer via the crosslinking effect, and was sufficient to retard the charge recombination between I3− and the injected electron in TiO2, which resulted in a high VOC over 0.8 V. However, when DCA molecules were coadsorbed on the TiO2 surface with LJ-8 there is decrease of VOC, probably owing to the reducing dye-loading amount and the deteriorated blocking effect.

Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed three new D–π–A dyes LJ-7, LJ-8 and LJ-9 bearing substituted oligothiophene as a π-spacer, and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor moiety for high-efficiency DSSCs. Due to the preferable orientation to the blocking effect, the long alkyl chains being perpendicular to the dye backbone seem to be superior to those attached on the backbone in parallel for suppressing charge recombination, which resulted in high photovoltage. Moreover, the long alkyl chains being perpendicular were also superior to those attached on the dye backbone directly for reducing the twisting effect between conjugated planes, which gains broader light harvesting and results in high photocurrent. As a result, a high VOC over 0.8 V and a high power conversion efficiency over 8% were achieved in LJ-8 based devices through molecular engineering by the present strategy. The strategy described here should provide a significant enlightenment for the molecular design of organic semiconductors in the photoelectric field, particularly involving light harvesting and intermolecular interactions.
