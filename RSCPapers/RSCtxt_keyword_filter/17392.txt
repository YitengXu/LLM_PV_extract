    , Accepted 3rd January 2018First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractA new propeller-shaped small-molecule acceptor of BPT-S with S-annulated perylene bisimide (PBI) as peripheral groups was designed and synthesized. Compared to the unannulated counterpart (BPT), BPT-S exhibits a blue-shift absorption spectrum, stronger absorption in the region of 400–510 nm, higher LUMO energy level and twisted molecular geometry. The BPT-S-based device with PDBT-T1 as the donor achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 8.28% with an impressively high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V, a near 16% enhancement in PCE with respect to the BPT-based control device (7.16%). The high photovoltaic performance for the BPT-S-based device can be attributed to its relatively high-lying LUMO level, complementary absorption spectra with the donor material, favorable morphology and balanced carrier transport. To the best of our knowledge, a PCE of 8.28% is the highest value for the device based on S-annulated PBIs as acceptors reported so far. This work indicates the great potential of the 3D S-annulated PBI-based acceptors for tandem (or multi-junction) organic solar cells due to the proper absorption spectra and high photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
In recent years, fullerene-free semiconductor electron materials have attracted extensive attention due to their advantages of easy tunability of energy levels, improved solar light absorption and self-assembly characteristics relative to fullerene-based acceptors.1–10 Up to date, a series of high performance fullerene-free acceptors have been exploited, especially for the systems of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) and perylene bisimide (PBI).11–29 The PCEs of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the family of ITIC acceptors have exceeded 12%,30–32 while the record PCE of PBIs-based OSCs is 9.5%.33 As a fact, most of the PBIs show great potential for application in tandem (or multi-junction) OSCs due to the special absorption spectra below 600 nm.34,35 Therefore, the development of efficient PBI-based acceptors is critical.
In general, PBI derivatives possess some appealing properties such as excellent photochemical stability, high electron mobility and strong absorption ability.36–40 Despite these advantages, traditional PBI derivatives have so large planar structures that they incline to form excessively large crystalline domains, which may result in large phase separation in active layers, thereby limiting the OSC performance.41–54 In order to suppress the aggregation tendency, great efforts have been devoted to the construction of twisted PBI dimers and three-dimensional (3D)-structure oligomers. For example, S,26,51,55 Se25,40 and N56–59 heteroatoms were incorporated at the bay positions of PBI units to obtain more twisted dimers and higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels relative to unannulated dimers, which is favorable for achieving good device performances. It is worth mentioning that the 3D S-annulated PBI-based acceptors have been less studied, and the highest efficiency of the device based on 3D S-annulated PBI-based acceptors did not exceed 7%.51,55 Thus developing 3D S-annulated PBI-based acceptors for high photovoltaic performance is meaningful.
Based on the above considerations, herein we developed a new propeller-shaped small-molecule acceptor named BPT-S with 4,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-Th) as the core and S-annulated β/PBI as peripheral groups (Scheme 1). In comparison with the traditional synthetic route of BDT-Th, we reported a more effective method.60 The acceptor of BPT-S exhibits more twisted molecular geometry relative to BPT, which can suppress aggregation tendency and intermolecular stacking. Benefitting from the electron-donating ability of S annulated polycyclic aromatics and non-bonding intermolecular interactions such as S–S interactions and van der Waals forces, BPT-S shows a blue-shift absorption spectrum, a stronger absorption in the region of 400–510 nm and a higher LUMO level relative to BPT. By using BPT-S as the acceptor and our reported high performance polymer PDBT-T1 as the donor,61 the highest PCE of 8.28% with an impressively high VOC of 1.02 V, a FF of 68.1%, and a JSC of 11.94 mA cm−2 was achieved, which is 16% higher than that of BPT (7.16%). The high efficiency for BPT-S can be ascribed to the relatively high-lying LUMO level and complementary absorption spectra with a donor material, favorable morphology and balanced carrier transport. As far as we know, the PCE of 8.28% is the highest value for the S-annulated-PBI-based devices reported so far. The absorption range of 400–600 nm and comprehensive high photovoltaic parameters of BPT-S make it an outstanding candidate as an acceptor for tandem (or multi-junction) OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the two new acceptors are outlined in Scheme 1. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione was subjected to a classical nucleophilic addition reaction using (5-trimethylsilyl thiophene-2-yl)lithium as a nucleophilic reagent, and then the intermediates underwent Lewis acid-mediated reactions to form the silyl compound BDT-ThSi. The deprotection of the silyl compound was only achieved by dissolving it in a dichloromethane solution dropwise with trifluoroacetic acid and immediate quenching with water to get BDT-Th, which is basically a quantitative reaction. Compared with the traditional synthetic route of BDT-Th, the route is simple in synthesis, easy in purification and high in yield.60 Selective borylation of BDT-Thvia an Ir-catalyzed reaction yielded the BDT-Th-4Bin compound, which is only purified by recrystallization in hexane. Suzuki coupling between BDT-Th-4Bin with 6 equivalents of the corresponding monobrominated PBI generates BPT or BPT-S. The overall yields of BPT and BPT-S are 55% and 54%, respectively. These compounds were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis (EA) and MALDI-TOF (see ESI†).
They show good solubility in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), especially for o-DCB (the solubility of both BPT and BPT-S exceeded 30 mg mL−1). The main reason for such optimal solubility of these acceptors is the combination of branched alkyl side chains and non-planar molecular skeletons.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of BPT and BPT-S in thin films and dilute chloroform solution (10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Compared to BPT, BPT-S exhibits narrow and strong absorption in dilute chloroform solution in the wavelength range of 400–550 nm with a maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.68 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 503 nm, which is higher than that of BPT (1.10 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 530 nm), most likely due to the synergistic effect of π–π interactions and multiple heteroatom–heteroatom interactions.26,62 Neat BPT and BPT-S films display similar absorption spectra to their solution ones, indicating weak intermolecular aggregation in the solid state. The S-annulated PBI increases its LUMO due to the electron-donating ability of the S bridge and thus BPT-S shows a larger band gap (Eoptg) of 2.14 eV than that of BPT (1.95 eV). In addition, the absorption spectra of BPT-S and PDBT-T1 are well complemented to ensure a full harvest of light in the visible spectrum. As shown in Fig. 1c, both BPT and BPT-S showed a strong fluorescence emission, but was completely quenched by PDBT-T1 (over 95%), indicating that an efficient charge transfer occurred between PDBT-T1 and the two acceptors. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the energy levels of BPT and BPT-S (Fig. 1d). The HOMO/LUMO levels of BPT and BPT-S estimated from the onset oxidation/reduction potentials are −5.89/−3.85 and −6.08/−3.79 eV, respectively. The energy offset between the LUMO of BPT-S (−3.79 eV) and the HOMO of PDBT-T1 (−5.36 eV) is 1.57 eV, and thus a high VOC can be reasonably expected.

2.3. Theoretical analysis
Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level was employed to obtain the optimal 3D molecular geometries. In order to facilitate the calculation, we used methyl to replace long branched alkyl chains. Both BPT and BPT-S show 3D nonplanar configuration (Fig. 2), which should contribute to suppress aggregation tendency and intermolecular stacking. For BPT, the dihedral angles between PDIs and thiophene, and PDIs and BDT are very close at 58°. For BPT-S, a more twisted molecular geometry was obtained, the dihedral angles between S-annulated PDIs and BDT, and PDIs and thiophene are very close at 70°. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) electron density localizes in the BDT-Th core, while the LUMO orbitals are mainly distributed on peripheral PDIs, which implies polarization in the excited state.41 The LUMO/HOMO energy levels of BPT and BPT-S are −3.58/−5.72 and −3.57/−5.95 eV through DFT calculations, respectively. The calculated values are consistent with the values by CV measurements.

2.4. Photovoltaic properties
In order to probe the photovoltaic performance of BPT and BPT-S, polymer solar cells were fabricated with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate))/PDBT-T1:acceptors (1:1)/ZrAcAc (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and ZrAcAc served as the hole transporting layer and electron transporting layer, respectively (Fig. 3b). The optimal weight ratio of PDBT-T1:acceptors is 1:1. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PDBT-T1:BPT and PDBT-T1:BPT-S-based solar cell devices without/with 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are presented in Fig. 4.

As shown in Table 2, the as-cast device based on PDBT-T1:BPT-S achieved a PCE of 7.08% with a VOC of 1.03 V, a JSC of 11.27 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.609, while the PDBT-T1:BPT-based control device acquired a PCE of 6.35%, with a VOC of 1.02 V, a JSC of 10.43 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.596. When the two optimal devices were compared, the BPT-S based device showed a higher VOC, JSC and FF than the reference BPT, resulting in a near 12% promotion in PCEs.

In order to further improve the cell efficiency, we employed DIO as a solvent additive to mediate the morphology of active layers on the basis of the best blend ratio. When the DIO concentration was 0.5%, both the devices based on PDBT-T1:BPT and PDBT-T1:BPT-S achieved the best device performance. For the BPT-based device, the PCE was enhanced to 7.16% due to the increased JSC and FF. The BPT-S-based device achieved a significantly higher PCE up to 8.28% relative to the BPT-based device with a VOC of 1.02 V, a JSC of 11.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.681 after the addition of 0.5% DIO. The difference of VOC between the devices of BPT and BPT-S is mainly ascribed to the higher-lying LUMO levels of BPT-S. To the best of our knowledge, the VOC of 1.02 and FF of 0.681 are among the highest values of free-fullerene solar cells with PCEs over 7% based on PBIs as acceptors (see Table S1, ESI†). Compared to BPT, the stronger light-absorbing capability and more complementary absorption may be responsible for the higher JSC of the device based on BPT-S. In addition, the larger FF for the device based on BPT-S should be ascribed to the favorable morphology (as discuss below). The PCE of 8.28% is the highest value for the device based on S-annulated PBIs as acceptors reported so far. Wang and co-workers reported a 3D S-annulated PBI-based acceptor of tetra-PBI-S which achieved a PCE of 6.17% with a VOC of 0.947 V, a JSC of 13.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.50 when it was blended with the PBDT-TS1 polymer donor.55 The significant difference of PCEs between BPT-S and tetra-PBI-S is mainly ascribed to the low VOC and FF of the device based on tetra-PBI-S.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of solar cells based on BPT and BPT-S are displayed in Fig. 4b. Both of the PDBT-T1:BPT and PDBT-T1:BPT-S blend films exhibit a broad spectral response from 300 to 710 nm. In comparison with the BPT blend film, the devices based on the combination of BPT-S and PDBT-T1 display stronger photo response in the wavelength range of 400–660 nm. The maximum value of more than 70% for the device based on BPT-S after adding DIO indicates effective photon harvesting and charge collection. The calculated JSC values integrated from the EQE spectrum for BPT and BPT-S-based devices after the addition of DIO are 11.10 and 11.70 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC value measured from J–V curves.
2.5. Charge carrier mobility
The charge transport rate plays an important role in device performance, thus we utilized a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the charge-carrier mobility of the D/A blend films (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the hole mobilities (μh) exhibit the same orders of magnitude with electron mobilities (μe), which is favorable for the cell efficiency. Both electron and hole mobilities were improved in all devices after adding DIO; the device based on BPT-S exhibits higher μe and μh (2.45 × 10−3 and 1.41 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and more balanced μe/μh (1.73) compared to the device based on BPT, which could be responsible for higher FF and JSC in the BPT-S device.
The electron mobilities of BPT and BPT-S with a device configuration of ITO/Al/BPT or BPT-S/Al were also measured using the SCLC method (Fig. S3, ESI†). Compared with BPT, BPT-S exhibits higher electron mobility (3.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to better intermolecular interactions through C–S⋯S noncovalent interactions,26 which will benefit carrier transport and collection.
2.6. Morphology characterization
In order to better understand the additive role in cell efficiency, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to study the surface morphology of the active layers (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5, ESI†). The blend films of PDBT-T1:BPT and PDBT-T1:BPT-S without additives showed smooth and uniform morphologies with root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.61 and 1.53 nm, respectively. The similar RMS may be responsible for the close FF values in BPT and BPT-S devices. The surface roughness of the both blend films were obviously increased after the addition of 0.5% DIO, which is indicative of obvious molecule aggregation. In comparison to the blend film of PDBT-T1:BPT, the PDBT-T1:BPT-S film showed a significant improvement in RMS, which matches well with the great enhancement in FF for the BPT-S-based device. And the higher RMS value (2.72 nm) for the BPT-S blend film increases the contact area between the active layer and cathode interface, which improves charge transport and collection. The TEM images clearly show the phase separation and packing of different blend films, which is in agreement with AFM images. As shown in Fig. 5, the BPT-S based blend film exhibits more evident phase separation relative to the blend film of BPT, which contributes to improved FF and JSC.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new propeller-shaped small-molecule acceptor with BDT-Th as the core and S-annulated PBI as peripheral groups was developed. In comparison with BPT, BPT-S exhibits a blue-shift absorption spectrum, stronger absorption in the region of 400–510 nm, higher LUMO energy level and twisted molecular geometry. By using BPT-S as the acceptor and our reported high performance polymer PDBT-T1 as the donor, the PCE of up to 8.28% with an impressively high VOC of 1.02 V was achieved. It is worth mentioning that the JSC and FF based on BPT-S are higher than those of the BPT-based device. The higher JSC and FF based on the BPT-S device can be attributed to more complementary absorption spectra with the donor material and balanced μh/μe, better intermolecular interaction and more evident phase separation properties as indicated by AFM and TEM results. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE represents the highest values for single-junction OSCs based on S-annulated PDI-based acceptors. The good photovoltaic performance and the absorption range in 400–600 nm of BPT-S make it an excellent candidate for tandem (or multi-junction) OSCs.

4.1. Synthesis of BPT
Pd2(dba)3 (16 mg, 0.017 mmol) and P(MeOPh)3 (48 mg, 0.14 mmol) were added to a mixture of BDT-Th-4Bpin (129 mg, 0.15 mmol), sulfur annulated monobromo-substituted PBI (700 mg, 0.75 mmol, 5 eq.), THF and 2 M K2CO3 aqueous solution (8 mL) under nitrogen. The mixture was poured into methanol after refluxing for 16 hours. The red precipitate obtained was filtered and purified by column chromatography using chloroform/hexane = 2/1 (v/v) as the eluent and thus BPT was obtained (418 mg, 0.12 mmol, yield: 80%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ [ppm]: 8.80–8.60 (m, 20H), 8.44–8.42 (m, 4H), 8.13–8.07 (m, 4H), 7.62 (s, 2H), 7.28 (m, 2H), 5.25–4.70 (m, 8H), 2.30–1.99 (m, 16H), 1.91–1.68 (m, 16H), 1.28–0.92 (m, 128H), 0.86–0.60 (m, 48H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ [ppm]: 164.56, 145.56, 142.25, 139.24, 136.14, 135.09, 133.59, 132.88, 132.72, 130.04, 129.57, 129.11, 128.83, 128.05, 127.49, 126.89, 124.38, 123.72, 122.91, 119.42, 54.82, 53.45, 32.27, 31.63, 29.20, 26.90, 22.57, 22.50, 14.03, 13.97.

4.2. Synthesis of BPT-S
The synthetic route of BPT-S is similar to the above mentioned methods, except for using PBI-S-Br to replace PBI-Br. The red precipitate obtained was filtered and purified by column chromatography using chloroform/hexane = 3/1 (v/v) as the eluent and thus BPT-S was obtained (400 mg, 0.11 mmol, yield: 75%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ [ppm]: 9.53–9.15 (m, 10H), 8.93–8.79 (m, 6H), 8.57 (s, 2H), 8.35–8.27 (m, 4H), 7.93 (s, 2H), 7.43 (s, 2H), 5.35–4.60 (m, 8H), 2.37–1.96 (m, 16H), 1.90–1.70 (m, 16H), 1.49–1.00 (m, 128H), 0.85–0.50 (m, 48H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ [ppm]: 164.98, 164.05, 149.75, 144.96, 143.09, 137.71, 133.45, 133.22, 131.95, 131.14, 130.26, 127.75, 127.29, 126.66, 126.34, 126.20, 126.11,125.89, 124.56, 124.37, 124.24, 124.05, 122.83, 122.19, 111.66, 54.90, 53.45, 32.32, 31.65, 29.25, 29.13, 26.99, 26.90, 26.82, 26.74, 22.58, 22.49, 14.05, 13.98.
