    , Accepted 25th December 2019First published on 26th December 2019AbstractTwo organic hole-transporting materials comprising a two-dimensional triphenylene core and methoxyl-arylamine terminal units are developed and applied in perovskite solar cells. Enhanced photovoltaic and stability performance are obtained using TPH-T compared with those of spiro-OMeTAD.
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered an emerging star in photovoltaic technology.1 Positioned between the active perovskite absorber layer and the metal back electrode, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play an indispensable role for PSCs through the efficient transporting, extracting and collecting processes of the hole carriers.2 Organic small molecule spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), which features a three-dimensional (3D) steric orthogonal core and arylamine terminals, is recognized as a the state-of-the-art HTM in the field of efficient PSCs. However, the rigid 3D core conformation hinders ordered molecular packing or crystallization, thus weakening the intermolecular charge-transporting processes.3 Moreover, almost all the HTMs based on a spiro-core fail based on their complicated synthesis procedures, tedious purification route and high cost.4 Further exploration for new core building blocks and more economic HTMs is imperative.
Triphenylene, a two-dimensional fused group which possess D3h molecular symmetry, has been widely investigated as functional intermediate in organic light-emitting-diode (OLED) and liquid crystal display (LCD) applications.5 Considering the two-dimensional coplanar conformation and π-conjugation effects, the introduction of triphenylene can improve the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, and enhance charge-transporting ability.6 Moreover, modified using different peripheral functional groups, the π–π and lateral chain interaction can promote the stacking of an ordered structure.7 Obviously, these advantages make triphenylene a promising functional material for use in organic photovoltaics. To the best of our knowledge, the triphenylene core has hardly ever been employed as a core building block in organic small molecule HTMs for PSCs.
In this work, two organic small molecules, N2,N2,N7,N7-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)triphenylene-2,7-diamine (TPH-D) and 4,4′-(triphenylene-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TPH-T), were constructed based on the two-dimensional triphenylene core unit. As shown in Fig. 1, the two new HTMs were synthesized in satisfactory yields by employing the classical Suzuki and Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reactions; details of the synthetic procedures and identification using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are given in the ESI.† The photophysical, electrochemical, thermal and electronic structure characteristics and hole-transporting properties that occur as the result of the triphenylene core introduction and different arylamine terminal substituents were systematically investigated. Applied as a HTM in mixed ion ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) perovskite solar cells, the best-performing device based on TPH-T revealed an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.4%. The multifaceted reasons for the ranking performance of the PSCs based on TPH-T can be ascribed to the appropriate energy level alignment, and improved hole-transporting and extraction ability.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures and synthetic procedures for TPH-D and TPH-T. 
As shown in Fig. 2a, the normalized absorption and emission spectra of triphenylene-based HTMs in dichloromethane (DCM) solution are exhibited. The detailed response data are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). As well as a high-energy spectral feature at around 280 nm, TPH-D and TPH-T show strong absorption band peaks at 366 and 380 nm, respectively, which can be ascribed to the local π–π* electron transitions of their macrocyclic molecule conjugation systems and intramolecular charge transitions.8 The bathochromic shift of TPH-T compared with TPH-D originates from its better extended π-conjugation and stronger ICT interaction. The optical absorption spectra of these two HTMs fail to provide an effective absorption in the visible light region. So sunlight can reach the perovskite layer readily, and this is beneficial for efficient light harvesting. The solution and film state absorption spectra of the new HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD are exhibited in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Obvious onset point bathochromic-shift phenomena for TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD are observed. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, the two new HTMs based on the two-dimensional triphenylene core display more visible red-shifts (11 nm for TPH-D and 8 nm for TPH-T). This fact demonstrates that the two-dimensional triphenylene core can have beneficial effects on the intermolecular packing.9

The maximum emission band of TPH-D peaks at 450 nm, whereas for TPH-T the emission peak is observed at 484 nm. On the basis of the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra, the E0–0 transition energy, and thus optical energy bandgaps (Eoptg) can be estimated to be 2.99 and 2.93 eV for TPH-D and TPH-T, respectively. Estimated from the gap between the maximum absorption and emission peaks, the Stokes shifts of TPH-D and TPH-T are 84 and 104 nm respectively. These large Stokes shifts, which come from the two-dimensional geometrical configuration transformations of TPH-D and TPH-T upon fluorescence excitation, can promote the pore-filling capability, followed by superior charge-transporting ability.10
An appropriate energy level alignment between the perovskite and HTM is important to suppress the energy losses in PSCs. In Fig. 2b, the redox potentials (E0ox) of TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD are studied by employing cyclic voltammetry in DCM solution. For spiro-OMeTAD, two obvious oxidation processes can be distinguished in the low potential region from 0.10 to 0.60 V, which indicate one-electron oxidation of each terminal arylamine group.11 In the case of TPH-D and TPH-T, nevertheless, we can merely find one reversible redox process, suggesting that the two electrons are extracted from each terminal arylamine group almost simultaneously, to form a dication state (HTM+ into HTM2+).12 This fact also shows that the two triphenylene-based HTMs possess superior electrochemical stability and excellent charge transfer capacity.
The highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) is determined by the equation EHOMO = E0oxvs. NHE + 4.44 (eV); the HOMO energy levels of TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD were calculated to be −5.47, −5.44 and −5.20 eV, respectively. These EHOMO values show that the materials are thermodynamically capable of photogenerated hole extraction from perovskite absorber material, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbI3)0.15 in this work, with a valence band edge of around −5.65 eV. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, the two triphenylene-based HTMs give lower-lying HOMO energy levels. The lower EHOMO values, which result from the weaker electronic conjugation between the triphenylene core and arylamine terminals, can be helpful for optimizing the interfacial energy level alignment and suppressing the photovoltage loss.13 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) energy levels for TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD are −2.48, −2.51 and −2.10 eV, respectively, which can definitely allow the HTMs to function as an efficient reverse electron blocking layer.
The thermal behaviour of TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Fig. 2c). For the TPH-D, TPH-T and reference spiro-OMeTAD, a 5% weight loss was recorded at 377, 400 and 425 °C, respectively. The superior thermal stability of the TPH-T molecule can be attributed to the higher Stokes shift and stronger aromatically conjugated effect between the triphenylene core and arylamine terminals.14 The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves indicating the glass transition (Tg), cold crystallization (Tc) and melting (Tm) events are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For TPH-D, the thermal behaviour during the first heating scan reveals a cold crystallization process of the amorphous material at 148 °C, and the sample melts at 174 °C. The second heating scan, which determines the glass transition process, shows a Tg of 97 °C. These results suggest that the amorphous state of TPH-D is stable up to 148 °C, when crystallization occurs. In contrast, TPH-T gives a clearly higher glass transition temperature of 115 °C, and no obvious crystallization and melting phenomena, manifesting its fully stabilized amorphous nature and reduced tendency to crystallize, which is favourable for PSC device stability.15
As shown in Fig. 2d, the hole-transporting capacity across the HTM layer was determined by space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. The hole mobility values (Table S1, ESI†) were obtained on the basis of the Mott–Gurney law.16 Encouragingly, the hole mobility data of the two new HTMs are higher than those of spiro-OMeTAD. These results closely match the deductions made from the reorganization energy (ER) data (Table S1, ESI†), which show that TPH-D and TPH-T exhibit lower calculated values and faster transport rates.17 The findings indicate that the two-dimensional triphenylene core in the organic molecule system is favourable for the hole-transporting process. The larger conjugated system in TPH-T compared with TPH-D leads to more efficient intermolecular π–π stacking geometry, intrinsic crystal structures and charge transport.18
To explore the electronic structure characteristics of the two new HTMs, density field theory (DFT)-optimized structures and resulting HOMO/LUMO distributions were obtained using Gaussian 16 at the B3LYP level with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set. In Fig. S3 (ESI†), distinctly torsional angles (beyond 34°), giving rise to non-planar geometry, are observed between the triphenylene core and arylamine terminals. This fact may provide a path forward to achieve the formation of low-level crystalline or even amorphous HTM films.19 The isodensity surface plots of HOMO and LUMO are illustrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†). TPH-D and TPH-T display similar electron density distribution trends. The orbital density of the HOMO is delocalized on both the diphenylamine and two adjacent phenyl units, while that of the LUMO is delocalized mainly on the triphenylene core. These distribution characteristics are considered beneficial for enhanced hole-transporting capacity when these materials are used as HTMs.20
The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence decay (PL/TRPL) results (Fig. S5, ESI†) are shown and discussed in ESI.† The PL and TRPL results, which coincide well with the above electrochemical properties and SCLC measurements, highlight the superior hole extraction, collection and interfacial transporting behaviors of the new HTMs based on 2D triphenylene core.21
As presented in Fig. 3a, the cross-sectional architectonics of PSC are displayed in detail. The photovoltaic performances of the two new HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD were carefully analysed by assembling mixed ion PSCs according to the following configuration: FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au. The detailed fabrication process can be found in the ESI.† The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices based on TPH-D, TPH-T and spiro-OMeTAD are depicted in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 1.

Under the standard AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2), the devices based on TPH-T gave a leading efficiency (η) of 19.4%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 23.0 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76. The superior performance can be attributed to the appropriate energy level alignment, and excellent hole-transporting and extraction abilities. The devices containing spiro-OMeTAD have a slightly inferior efficiency of 19.0%. These data indicate that TPH-T can serve as a promising HTM for PSC application. Rationalized by the insignificant difference in the positions of HOMO energy levels compared with TPH-T, the devices employing TPH-D as the HTM exhibit a comparable VOC value (1.09 V). However, they show a distinctly weak JSC (20.3 mA cm−2), which leads to very much lower performance. First, this phenomenon can be attributed to the lower charge-extraction, -collection and -transporting abilities of TPH-D. Moreover, the limiting dissolution loading of TPH-D in chlorobenzene is only 20 mg mL−1. The poor solubility would give rise to inferior film-forming capability and high standard deviation (SD) for the fundamental performance of PSCs.22 To confirm the intrinsic origin of the photocurrent, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the homologous devices are depicted in Fig. 3c. All the IPCE curves exhibit a similar profile, which suggests that the optical absorption of the two new triphenylene-based HTMs has a negligible effect on the device performance. To further confirm the J–V and IPCE data, the steady-state current density and power conversion efficiency as a function of working time under the maximum power conditions are shown in Fig. 3d. For the TPH-T-based device, the current density and power conversion efficiency output remain stable during 120 min exposure. Moreover, a considerable PCE value of above 18.2% is observed. Statistical PCE distribution histograms of 24 PSC devices based on the two new HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 3e. The small SD values, in Table 1, demonstrate the reproducibility of the fabrication process. Encouragingly, the devices with TPH-T give superior PCE performance with a narrow distribution between 15.9% and 19.4%.
The stability of the HTM plays a crucial role in preventing the degradation of a PSC. To evaluate the stability performance of the two triphenylene HTMs, we conducted aging tests on the unencapsulated devices under 30–35% relative humidity at room temperature. Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays the PCE attenuation curves as a function of time. The TPH-T-based device demonstrates the best stability among the three devices. The PCE after 20 days of aging had only declined by 24% compared with the original PCE value. The fabrication cost of new HTMs is one of the most crucial concerns for further PSC application. We calculated the lab synthesis cost of TPH-T according to a recognized model.23 The detailed costs of required amounts of reactants, catalysts, reagents and solvents are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The cost of TPH-T is around 47.93 $ g−1, which is distinctly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The lower cost make it a promising HTM for PSCs.
In summary, two new HTMs incorporating a two-dimensional triphenylene core and methoxyl-arylamine terminal units have been designed and synthesized. PSC devices incorporating TPH-T, which contains methoxyl-triphenylamine side groups, exhibit a remarkable PCE of 19.4%. The superior performance can be mainly ascribed to favourable energy level distribution characteristics, and excellent charge mobility and extraction ability. This work highlights the fact that organic molecules based on the two-dimensional π-conjugated triphenylene core can serve as promising HTMs for PSC application.
