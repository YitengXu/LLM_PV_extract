Currently, their performance hovers at a low level due to the contradiction between the exciton diffusion and light absorption of the organic layer. In the present work, we provide an efficient solution by designing a hollow electrode for the HSC, which contains CdS nanoflake arrays (NFAs) coated with a thin organic active layer and a roof-like metallic electrode. The hollow electrode facilitates light absorption, charge separation, and hole transportation simultaneously, and as a result, the novel HSC outperforms traditional solid and core–shell HSCs. Our work demonstrates that the reasonable design of the electrode structure is of great importance for improving the power conversion efficiency of HSCs.
Introduction
In the last two decades, third-generation solar cells, such as organic-based photovoltaic devices, and dye/quantum-sensitized (DSSC/QSSC) and perovskite solar cells, have emerged as the alternatives to traditional silicon based photovoltaics.1–4 Compared to their counterparts, organic-based photovoltaic devices, including organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells (HSCs), have attracted great scientific interest due to their low-cost and low-temperature solution processes, and the potential for large-scale production.5–7 Although the conversion efficiency (η) of OPVs exceeds 10%,6,7 the random microstructure, resulting from the simple blending of donor and acceptor polymers, causes discontinuous electron transport pathways, greatly limiting further performance enhancement.8–10 In contrast, HSCs with regular inorganic 3-D skeletons can provide fast charge pathways and large exciton separation interfaces, which is advantageous to the final performance.10–12
In a typical 3D HSC device, inorganic nanostructures, such as ZnO or TiO2 nanowire arrays, are synthesized and infiltrated with organic polymers to form a solid solar cell.12–20 Although tremendous effort has been made to enhance the performance of 3D HSCs, their properties still lag significantly behind those of bulk heterojunction OPVs.12 The crux of the matter is the contradiction between the exciton diffusion and light absorption of the organic layer,12–20 that is, the former prefers a thin layer thickness due to the short exciton diffusion length (usually less than 15 nm),5,8,10 while the latter demands a thick organic shell of over 100–200 nm, so as to absorb sunlight as much as possible.10,21 Currently, many HSCs possess an organic layer whose thickness is much larger than the exciton diffusion length, resulting in serious charge recombination (as shown in Fig. 1a).22 In contrast, other HSCs adopt a thin organic layer (within 15–20 nm) which is coated on nanowires to form a core–shell structure (Fig. 1b).21–23 Obviously, the thin polymer cannot absorb incident light efficiently; meanwhile, a metallic counter electrode (Au or Cu) is deposited directly on the polymer for hole collection,21–23 and such a metallic layer usually causes light-shading and reflection effects, resulting in serious optical loss. Hence, it is still a big challenge to achieve efficient carrier collection without compromising light absorption.

In a previous work, we demonstrated that 3D CdS nanoflake arrays (NFAs) exhibit excellent light trapping effects, which improve the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of NFAs by up to ∼95%, and more intriguingly, even a ∼15 nm-thick poly-3 hexylthiophene (P3HT) coating on NFAs also attains a high LHE of ∼95% via the light trapping effect;24 thus NFAs show good potential for harmonizing the contradiction of light absorption and exciton separation. Hence, the next crux of the matter is how to conduct holes from the active core–shell-constructed NFAs, which eventually determines the performance of NFA-based solar cells. The traditional electrode structures shown in Fig. 1a and b cause adverse effects on either exciton separation or light absorption, and thus an alternative cathode structure is highly desirable for NFA-based HSCs.
In the present work, we suggest a hollow cathode structure (Fig. 1c and d), where a PEDOT:PSS layer was coated along the contours as well as on top of the CdS/P3HT NFAs, leaving many cavities between the bottom and roof PEDOT:PSS layers. Finally, an Au top layer was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS roof as the collective electrode. This novel cathode brings several advantages for HSCs. First, the unique nanoflake array (NFA) structure provides good guidance to the incoming light, via efficient light scattering and trapping, enabling the CdS NFAs and a 15 nm-thick polymer shell to display efficient absorption.24 Second, the small thicknesses of the CdS nanoflakes and P3HT coating reduce the distance for exciton diffusion, thus significantly improving charge separation. Third, the metallic-like PEDOT:PSS coating around the P3HT shell provides quick paths for the transportation of holes, thus significantly depressing charge recombination. Last but not least, the hollow electrode avoids any possible optical loss: the hollow PEDOT:PSS electrode does not absorb incident light obviously and the flat Au electrode at the end of the device increases, rather than suppresses, light harvesting, because the metallic layer does not shield incident light, but reflects some of the escaping light back into the NFAs. Resultantly, the hollow electrode facilitates light absorption, charge separation, and hole transportation simultaneously. Finally, the HSC with a hollow cathode (H-HSC) obtained an enhanced photocurrent of 3.4 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 0.52%, which outperforms traditional solid and core–shell HSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of the CdS (CdSe)/P3HT hollow HSCs (H-HSCs)
Firstly, a 20–30 nm-thick TiO2 buffer layer was deposited on FTO using a sputtering method;24 secondly, CdS (CdSe) NFAs with a uniform flake size of ∼2 μm and a flake thickness of ∼100 nm were prepared on the FTO/TiO2 substrate according to our published procedure;24 thirdly, the as-prepared CdS (CdSe) NFAs were covered with a chlorobenzene solution of P3HT (15 mg ml−1), left in air for 1 min for P3HT to infiltrate into the free space, and then were spun at a rotation speed of 2500 rpm for 5 seconds to form a thin P3HT shell. Afterwards, an additional drop of P3HT solution (around 0.3–0.4 ml) was spin-coated onto the sample at 2500 rpm until dry; fourthly, a solution of PEDOT:PSS (diluted with two volumes of isopropanol and 5 wt% dimethyl sulfoxide) was covered onto the CdS(CdSe)/P3HT NFAs, left for 1 min, and then spun at 2500 rpm for more than 2 min to dry the sample; fifthly, the sample was annealed at 110 °C for 20 min under nitrogen; and finally, a 100 nm-thick back electrode layer (Au) was deposited onto the samples using a magnetron sputtering method, giving an active area of 0.09 cm2. Then all the HSCs were exposed to air for a week, and then photovoltaic tests were carried out.
Synthesis of CdS/P3HT infiltrated (S-HSCs), core–shell (CS-HSCs) and bilayer planar HSCs
The assembly process for the S-HSC is roughly identical to the above process except for the third step. In this step, a drop of P3HT solution (dissolved in chlorobenzene of 50 mg ml−1 concentration) was spin-coated onto the CdS (CdSe) NFA sample at 2500 rpm until dry. This process was repeated two more times to obtain an infiltrated P3HT layer.
The CS-HSC was assembled using the above process except that the fourth step, the PEDOT:PSS spin coating process, was omitted. Moreover, the thickness of the Au layer was controlled at ∼30 nm.
The bilayer planar HSC can also be made using the above process, except replacing the CdS NFAs with a 150 nm-thick CdS film.
Characterization
Morphology was observed using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a Technai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM), with a field emission gun operated at 200 kV. The chemical composition of the samples was detected using an EDS module attached to the SEM. A Bruker D/max 2500 v/pc diffractometer was exploited for XRD analyses. The light absorption spectra were collected using a Hitachi 3010 UV-VIS absorption spectrometer with an integrating sphere. PL analyses were carried out at room temperature with the help of a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer under excitation from 530 nm wavelength light, and TRPL measurements were conducted using an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer; the emission at 680 nm was recorded after excitation at 405 nm. Photoelectric characteristics were measured under a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol, 1 A 2 × 2, 150 W solar simulator) at one sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) illumination, and the J–V values were recorded using a Keithley 2611 digital source meter. IPCE spectra were measured with a tungsten quartz halogen light source, a monochromator, filters, reflective optics to provide monochromatic light, a mechanical chopper to modulate the light, and a transition impedance amplifier to provide the test device signal to the digital signal processing equipment. EIS analyses were conducted using a Versastat 3 potentiostat electrochemistry workstation over a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under forward bias from 0 V to 0.2 V.
FDTD simulation
The FDTD simulations were carried out using commercial software – Lumerical. The simulated absorption profiles were calculated from the formula Pabs = −0.5ω|E|2imag(ε), and the absorption spectra in a certain volume of interest can be calculated from the expression , where Pabs represents the power absorption per unit volume, ω is the angular frequency, |E| is the electric field intensity and ε is the complex dielectric constant of CdS (P3HT).
Results and discussion
To obtain the H-HSC structure (see Fig. S1†), CdS NFAs with a flake size of ∼2 μm were first fabricated on a conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (Fig. 2a and S2†). Then, a P3HT layer was coated onto the CdS NFAs (Fig. 2b) to form a continuous shell. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations suggest a layer thickness of 10–15 nm (Fig. S3†), which is comparable to the exciton diffusion length of P3HT. Subsequently, the CdS/P3HT hybrid NFAs were coated with an isopropanol solution of PEDOT:PSS, left to rest for 1 min (Fig. S4a†), and spun at a high speed. The gradually concentrated solution flew along the inclined surface of the nanoflakes under the action of centrifugal force. Part of the solution was left on the surface of the nanoflakes to form a conformal layer, and the rest was expelled and connected into a roof on top of the NFAs, giving rise to a hollow PEDOT:PSS conductive layer (Fig. 2c and d).25,26 Finally, an Au layer was sputtered onto the PEDOT:PSS to accomplish a hollow counter electrode.

The photovoltaic performance of the as-synthesized H-HSC was evaluated and compared with a solid HSC (S-HSC, Fig. 1a and S5†) and core–shell HSC (CS-HSC, Fig. 1b). Notably, the thickness of the Au layer in the CS-HSC was optimized at ∼30 nm (Fig. S6†). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for the three kinds of devices are displayed in Fig. 3a, and the photovoltaic characteristics are listed in Table 1. Compared with the S-HSC and CS-HSC, the H-HSC exhibits the highest short circuit current (JSC, 3.4 mA cm−2), open circuit voltage (VOC, 0.43 V) and photo-electrical conversion efficiency (η, 0.52%). It should be noted that the excellent JSC and η are among the top values for wide band-gap semiconductor/P3HT-based HSCs without surface modification (Table 2). Moreover, the slightly increased VOC of the H-HSC was attributed to a smaller reverse saturation current than that of the S-HSC (Fig. S7†).21,22 In addition, the total thickness of the arrays can be adjusted from ∼1 to 4 μm through varying the size of the flakes (Fig. S8a–c†). NFAs with 2 μm thickness show higher photo-electrical conversion efficiency than the other NFAs (Fig. S8d and Table S1†), indicating that an appropriate thickness of NFA can exploit fully the advantages of the H-HSC.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are shown in Fig. 3b. The onset of the photocurrent at 530 nm corresponds to the band gap excitation of CdS. Obviously, the H-HSC exhibits high IPCE values (∼37%) over the wavelength range of 350–500 nm, about 3 times and 6 times those of the S-HSC and CS-HSC, respectively. In the wavelength region of 540–680 nm, where only P3HT contributes to light absorption, the S-HSC and CS-HSC show negligible photocurrent,27 whereas the H-HSC presents a distinctly enhanced IPCE. Moreover, taking account of the number of absorbed photons, the IPCE can be converted into the absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE). As seen in Fig. 3c, the APCE curves show features similar to the IPCE curves.
To investigate the origin of the performance enhancement, we compared the light absorption of the three HSCs. As seen in Fig. 4a, the three samples exhibit similar absorption values and a sharp absorption edge at 650 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic absorption of P3HT. Unexpectedly, the CS-HSC and H-HSC with an ultrathin P3HT layer (∼15 nm) show slightly higher absorption over the 450–650 nm range than fully infiltrated S-HSC, indicating the superiority of the core–shell structure for light trapping.21,24

(d) Simulated cross-sectional space distribution of the light absorption profiles of the (i) S-HSC, (ii) CS-HSC and (iii) H-HSC under 500 nm light illumination. 
Finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed to distinguish the light absorption of the different components (CdS NFs and P3HT) of the HSCs, and the simulated models are shown in Fig. S9.†21 The total absorption calculated in Fig. S10† is consistent with the experimental results, indicating that the computational models and processes are reasonable. According to the calculation results presented in Fig. 4b, the CdS NFs in the H-HSC achieve much higher optical absorption than those in the CS-HSC and S-HSC. Fig. 4c displays the simulated absorption of the 15 nm-thick P3HT layer near the CdS NFAs and, as reported, only excitons generated in these regions of P3HT could contribute to the photocurrent.21 As seen, the P3HT layer in the H-HSC yields an absorption much higher than that of the same thickness in the S-HSC and CS-HSC (Fig. 4c), which can explain the enhanced IPCE of the H-HSC in the 500–650 nm range (Fig. 3b), and demonstrates the superiority of the hollow electrode.
Furthermore, the light propagation within the HSCs under 500 nm light irradiation was simulated, and the corresponding cross-sectional profiles are shown in Fig. 4d. For the S-HSC, the light was mainly consumed by the infiltrated P3HT near the surface (indicated by the box in panel i of Fig. 4d). In the case of the CS-HSC, most of the incoming light was screened by the Au layers. As shown in Fig. S11,† the light must pass through two Au layers before reaching the heterojunctions, causing the so-called light shading effect. This recognition is verified using the simulated results, where the Au layer in the CS-HSC can cause high absorption (Fig. S12†). Therefore, in both the S-HSC and CS-HSC, only the material near the substrates can participate in the photovoltaic processes (Fig. 4di and ii), corresponding well to the low absorption in their CdS NFs and P3HT shells (Fig. 4c and d). From this point of view, they performed more like a common HSC with a bilayer planar structure, which displays poor performance (Fig. S13 and S14, and Table S2†), and the CdS/P3HT heterojunction does not work as expected. In contrast, the heterojunction in the H-HSC can efficiently absorb the incident light, which progresses along the whole depth of the 2 μm NFs (see panel iii in Fig. 4d). Hence, the hollow counter electrode helps achieve sufficient light absorption and fully exploits the function of the CdS/P3HT heterojunction.
Besides light absorption, charge separation and carrier transport are also crucial for the final performance of HSCs. The H-HSC and CS-HSC possess similar structures for carrier generation and transport; hence we merely compared the H-HSC with the S-HSC. Photoluminescence (PL) was first employed to reveal the charge separation in P3HT in the two HSCs. As shown in Fig. 5a, we checked the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the S-HSC and H-HSC under excitation from 530 nm light. The two samples present the same emission peak centered at 680 nm, which can be attributed to the near-band-edge (NBE) emission of P3HT;31 however, the H-HSC exhibits a suppressed peak intensity, suggesting less charge recombination and the rapid transfer of charges in P3HT due to the hollow architecture.

(b) Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the CdS NFA/P3HT infiltrated samples and CdS NFA/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS hollow hybrids; the emission at 680 nm was recorded after excitation at 405 nm. (c) Resistance of P3HT in two HSCs as a function of potential, VF, measured under 1 sun illumination. (d) Cross-sectional schematic diagram of the charge transfer processes in the S-HSC and H-HSC. 
The dynamics of charge separation can also be investigated using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As shown in Fig. 5b and Table 3, the decay curves can be fitted using biexponential decay kinetics after deducting the instrument response function (IRF, also shown in Fig. 5c).15 It is generally proposed that the relatively short lifetime (200–500 ps, τ1) comes from a fast electron extraction process from the polymer to the semiconductor,15,32 whereas the relatively long decay time (τ2, nanosecond scale) can be attributed to the intrinsic photoluminescence of P3HT.33,34 Since the decay time of P3HT might be influenced by many factors, such as the crystallinity or the degree of chain order,33 the τ2 value varies with the concrete system, being 1.98 ns for the H-HSC and 0.99 ns for the S-HSC. The intensity ratio of τ1 to τ2 (I1/I2) is calculated as 19.5 for the H-HSC, dramatically higher than 7.4 for the S-HSC (see Table 3). These results suggest that the excitons generated in the H-HSC mainly separated at the P3HT/CdS heterojunction interface, instead of self-recombination, which is consistent with the PL results.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then adopted to evaluate carrier transfer in the HSCs. EIS measurements were conducted under 1 sun illumination and at different bias voltages, as shown in Fig. S15a.† From fitting the EIS results with appropriate models (Fig. S15b and c†),35,36 the transport resistances of P3HT (RP3HT) were obtained and are shown in Fig. 5c. As seen, the H-HSC exhibits a small value of RP3HT, which is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the S-HSC at all applied voltages. Such a result indicates that the holes generated in the H-HSC flow away rapidly from the active layer.
Based on the above, the advantages of the hollow electrode can be well understood. First, the hollow electrode is transparent for incident light, and thus avoids possible optical loss. Meanwhile, the flat Au electrode at the bottom of the device improves light harvesting by reflecting the escaping light back into the device. Second, the whole P3HT layer sandwiched between the CdS NFAs and hollow PEDOT:PSS electrode can be excited by the incident light, and the photo-generated electrons can flow into the FTO electrode along CdS NFAs, and photo-generated holes can drift into the hollow PEDOT:PSS electrode across the thin P3HT layer (left panel in Fig. 5d). Although the hole mobility in P3HT (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1)8,12,21,23 is worse than the electron mobility in the CdS NFAs (∼1.59 cm2 V−1 s−1, for calculating method see Fig. S16 and S17†), the thickness of P3HT (∼15 nm) is much smaller than the diameter of the CdS nanoflakes (∼2 μm), giving rise to a low RP3HT value. Resultantly, a balance can be achieved in the circuit between hole and electron conduction, which alleviates hole accumulation and carrier recombination in the P3HT layer. Finally, the holes reach the hollow PEDOT:PSS/Au electrode with high conductivity, and transport rapidly out of the H-HSC, realizing a high carrier collection efficiency. In comparison, although the CS-HSC possesses high capability for charge separation and carrier collection, it suffers from low light absorption due to the intensive reflection of the metallic electrode, resulting in a low photo-electron conversion efficiency. In the case of the S-HSC, the holes have to travel a long distance before they reach the Au electrode, and most of the holes recombine with the photo-induced electrons in the thick P3HT, resulting in a relatively high PL intensity (Fig. 5a), slow decay rate (Fig. 5b) and low carrier output.
Moreover, this purpose-built hollow architecture can also be extended to a CdSe/P3HT material system (Fig. S18†). As seen in Fig. S19 and Table S3,† the CdSe/P3HT H-HSC exhibits a high JSC and η of 5.9 mA cm−2 and 0.36%, whereas their infiltrated counterpart (S-HSC) only yields a JSC of 2.1 mA cm−2 and η of 0.2%. It is worth noticing that the JSC obtained using this CdSe/P3HT H-HSC is superior to that of the reported HSCs composed of a CdSe network and P3HT without interfacial modification (Table S3†). These results reveal the universality of this unique hollow architecture for future HSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we present a new H-HSC architecture, which couples a 3D CdS nanoflake array/P3HT as the light active materials and a roof-like PEDOT:PSS/Au layer as the counter electrode. In contrast to earlier reported core–shell HSCs, this H-HSC with a roof-like top electrode effectively avoids the light-shading effect from the metallic electrode and gains light trapping in the 3D CdS/P3HT NFAs, thus achieving sufficient light absorption. Moreover, the balanced electron and hole transfer in the CdS NFAs and P3HT, respectively, enables efficient carrier collection. As a result, greatly enhanced photocurrent and conversion efficiency were realized in such a H-HSC. Our work demonstrates that some of the important challenges summarized above in HSCs can be addressed through engineering this novel hollow device architecture.
