This detailed investigation reveals that apart from the reaction time, the molar ratio of oxalic acid dihydrate to titanium n-butoxide in the precursor reagents plays a key role in the crystallization of TiO2 as well as the formation of the hollow architecture. As confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the as-prepared hierarchical TiO2 hollow microspheres exhibit a stronger light scattering ability and extended electron lifetime compared to commercial P25 nanoparticles, which makes it a promising photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 6.33% is obtained for the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere-based DSSCs, which is lower than the value of P25 nanoparticle-based cells (7.69%) due to the significantly lower dye adsorption. However, the efficiency of the DSSCs can be enhanced to 8.76% when a bi-layer structured photoelectrode composed of P25 nanoparticles (dye adsorption layer) and hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres (light scattering layer) is used. The great improvement in photovoltaic performance is mainly due to the excellent light scattering properties, relatively high dye adsorption and the slower recombination rate of the bi-layer structure.IntroductionOwing to their low cost and excellent photoelectrical conversion efficiency, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as one of the most promising candidates to replace conventional silicon solar cells, have drawn increasing attention in recent years.1–3 Up to now, an overall conversion efficiency of as high as 12% has been reported for DSSCs,4 but this value is still far lower than the predicted maximum values (31%).5 In DSSCs, the photoanode materials serve as porous carriers for dye molecules and electron “vehicles” to transport the injected electrons from the excited dye molecules to the outer circuit, hence a perfect photoanode material should feature a high surface area for dye loading, a strong light scattering effect to increase the optical length, as well as the ability for fast electron transport, so as to achieve a high light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc).6 Since small-size nanoparticles (∼10–30 nm) are too weak to scatter visible light, while large particles with flat surfaces (e.g. 400 nm, CCIC)7 usually suffer from lower dye adsorption due to their much smaller surface area, bi-functional hierarchical-structured materials consisting of smaller building blocks, such as microspheres consisting of nanoparticles7–9 or nanosheets,10,11 dendritic structures composed of long nanowires,12 nanotubes13 and short nanorod branches,14,15 have been widely investigated recently as photoanode materials for DSSCs to provide both high dye adsorption and good light-scattering ability. Usually, a bi-layer structured photoanode with a large particle-based top layer working as the light scattering film and a nanoparticle-based bottom layer for dye loading is adopted, which could largely enhance the light harvesting efficiency and thus increase the power conversion efficiency.16,17Among the hierarchical materials, hollow-structured microspheres have been widely investigated as photoanode materials in DSSCs since they can effectively scatter the incident light, facilitate the infiltration of the electrolyte solution and promote mass transport. For instance, Koo et al. first reported the synthesis of bi-functional TiO2 hollow spheres with diameters of 1–3 μm which exhibited efficient generation of photo-excited electrons, as well as good light-scattering properties when working as the scattering layer of the photoanode in DSSCs.9 Shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres featuring excellent light scattering properties were reported by Wu et al., which resulted in an efficiency of 5.65% for pure shell-in-shell TiO2 and an improved efficiency of 8.27% for a bi-layer structured photoanode using hollow spheres as the scattering layer.16 Multi-shelled ZnO hollow microspheres were also reported by Dong et al., and a high energy conversion efficiency of 5.6% was achieved.17The most adopted method for the synthesis of hollow spheres is the template method, including hard templates (polymers, carbon, silica, metals and metal oxides)18–20 or soft templates (surfactant micelles/vesicles, microemulsions, macromolecules, oil droplets, gas bubbles).21–23 However, the template method requires the sacrifice of the template and increases the complexity of the synthesis procedure. Hence, template-free methods, including the solvothermal24 and hydrothermal methods,16,25–28 are more attractive.In the current study, we report novel hierarchical TiO2 hollow microspheres consisting of anatase nanoparticles synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal method without the involvement of any further calcination process. In comparison with the reported template-free methods, the raw materials (titanium n-butoxide, oxalic acid dihydrate) of this method are cheaper and more abundant, the synthesis procedure is more convenient and the reaction temperature is relatively low. The formation process of the hollow structure is investigated in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization. When used as the photoanode material for DSSCs, the as-prepared hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres exhibit excellent light scattering properties, a relatively high dye adsorption and a slower recombination rate, and a power conversion efficiency of 6.33% can be obtained. This value can be improved to 8.76% when the bi-layer structured photoelectrode is constructed with TiO2 hollow spheres as the light-scattering layer.Experimental sectionSynthesis of the hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheresHierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres consisting of anatase nanoparticles were successfully prepared via a simple template-free solvothermal method using titanium n-butoxide (TBT) and oxalic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O) as the precursors. Typically, 8 g oxalic acid dihydrate was firstly dissolved in 25 mL ethanol, and then 1 mL titanium n-butoxide was added quickly under stirring. After a few minutes, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated in an electronic oven at 140 °C for 12 h. The synthesized powder samples were washed with ethanol several times and finally dried in air at 70 °C. Various samples were prepared by adjusting the molar ratio of oxalic acid dihydrate to titanium n-butoxide, or changing the reaction time, using similar procedures as mentioned above.Preparation of the TiO2 working electrodeBoth the P25 particles (Degussa) and TiO2 hollow sphere-based pastes were prepared according to ref. 8. Briefly, the TiO2 powder (1.0 g P25 or TiO2 hollow spheres) was ground for ca. 40 min in a mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 10 min to form a viscous white TiO2 paste. Before screen-printing the TiO2 pastes onto the surface of FTO glass, an anatase TiO2 colloidal solution was firstly spin-coated onto the cleaned FTO glass (15 Ω per square, NipponSheet Glass, Japan) to form a compact layer. The transparent anatase TiO2 colloidal (3–5 nm in particle size) solution was prepared previously according to a modified literature procedure,29 in which the precursors containing TBT (34.2 mL), n-butanol (37.6 mL), acetylacetone (10.2 mL), para-toluene-sulfonic acid (3.8 g) and H2O (18.0 mL) were heated at 60 °C for 12 h. Then a screen-printing process was carried out to form TiO2 films on the surface of the FTO glass, followed by a calcination process in the furnace through a programmed temperature process (325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and then 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic compounds. The film thickness was controlled by repeating the printing process. After calcination, the TiO2 films were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. Finally, the TiO2 films were immersed into a 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NSC)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, Solaronix Co.), and sensitized for about 16 h at room temperature.Dye-sensitized solar cells assemblyFirstly, the dye-sensitized TiO2 films were rinsed with acetonitrile to remove the physisorbed N719 dye molecules. Then the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were sandwiched together with platinized counter electrodes into a sandwich-type cell. The platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by the thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min. A drop of I−/I3− electrolyte, containing 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.05 M LiI and 0.03 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v), was injected into the space between the two electrodes.CharacterizationThe morphology and structure of the TiO2 hollow spheres was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D-MAX 2200 VPC), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-FEM, JSM-6330F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010 HR). To analyze the diffuse reflectance of the films and the amounts of dye detached from the films, UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and absorption spectra were measured on a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (UV, Shimadzu UV-3150). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Nicolet 330 instrument. The thermogravimetic analysis was conducted on a STA 449 F3 Jupiter instrument. The thickness of the TiO2 films was measured by a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).The photocurrent density–voltage curve (J–V) measurements were performed with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W Xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) served as the light source, whose incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an optical filter to approximate AM 1.5G one sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2) before each measurement. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum as a function of the wavelength from 350 to 800 nm was measured using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator.The intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was conducted using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under modulated green light emitting diodes (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211). The illumination intensity ranged from 30 to 150 W m−2, and the modulated light intensity was no more than 10% of the base light intensity with a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on the same electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. An applied bias potential of −800 mV and a 10 mV magnitude of the alternative signal were employed in the EIS measurements under dark conditions. The impedance parameters were obtained by fitting the impedance spectra with Z-View software. Open-circuit voltage decay measurements were used to determine the electron lifetime in the TiO2 nanocrystalline film. The cells were lit for 5 seconds and tested for 5 seconds, and then the light was turned off.Results and discussionFig. 1 shows the morphology and structure of the as-prepared TiO2 samples. A typical SEM image (Fig. 1a) shows that the TiO2 samples have a spherical morphology with diameters in the range of 0.8–1.6 μm. The magnified image of a single broken sphere (Fig. 1b) reveals that the TiO2 spheres are hollow with a rough surface, and the wall thickness is about 180 nm. Careful observation of the SEM images shows that the multiple spheres are connected to each other, forming an irregular aggregated structure. This is confirmed by the TEM images. As shown in Fig. 1c, the strong contrast between the dark edges and bright centers evidently indicates the hollow structure of the TiO2 spheres. In addition, it is interesting to note that the special hollow structure consists of one to five interconnected spherical shells, that is, several single hollow spheres tend to merge into each other thus forming an irregular multi-shell TiO2 hollow structure (Fig. 1d). The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d, inset) reveals that the TiO2 hollow spheres are composed of single crystalline anatase TiO2 (interplanar spacing of d101 = 3.5 ± 0.1 Å) nanoparticles of size ∼10 nm. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1e) also confirm that the synthesized TiO2 hollow spheres are of the typical anatase phase, owing to the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase (JCPDS no. 65-2900, a = 3.785 Å, b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å, major peaks: 25.4°, 38.0°, 48.0°, 54.7° and 63.1°). Moreover, the crystallite size is about 9.4 nm according to the (101) peak of the XRD pattern, estimated by the Scherrer equation, D = 0.9λ/Bcosθ, where λ, B and θ represent the wavelength of the X-ray source, the full width at half maximum and the Bragg angle, respectively. This value is in accordance with the data estimated by the SEM and TEM observations. All of the results show that a special anatase TiO2 hollow structure with high crystallinity was obtained via a one-pot solvothermal method. This is the first report of irregular TiO2 multi-shell hollow spheres synthesized by a template-free method. Moreover, this hollow structure with high crystallinity should be very attractive as a photoanode material for DSSCs, since the hollow structure may induce a strong light scattering effect which would greatly improve the LHE.

(e) XRD pattern of the TiO2 hollow spheres. It should be noted that the anatase product with high crystallinity was obtained directly in the above solvothermal process without the involvement of any further calcination. It has been reported that acetic acid (HAc), a typical monocarboxylic acid, can work as an efficient reagent to prepare TiO2via reacting with the alkoxide monomers titanium isopropoxide or titanium n-butoxide during the solvothermal process. However, the as-obtained products were usually Ti complex intermediates, e.g., Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)b–n(OH)n (0 ≤ n ≤ 6), which needed further high temperature heating treatment to convert them to the crystalline phase.8,30,31 In order to investigate the contribution of oxalic acid dihydrate, which was first used to prepare TiO2 through a solvothermal method, to the formation mechanism of the anatase TiO2 hollow structures, the concentration of oxalic acid dihydrate in the precursor solution was optimized. Different molar ratios of titanium n-butoxide to oxalic acid dihydrate (1:0, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9.5, 1:11 and 1:21) were utilized while the other experimental conditions were kept constant, and the products were examined in detail by SEM, TEM and XRD characterization (Fig. S1–3†). It was found that no products were obtained in the absence of oxalic acid, namely, a 1:0 ratio of titanium n-butoxide:oxalic acid, because the polycondensation of titanium n-butoxide does not occur in the absence of acid. With a low oxalic acid concentration (1:7), there are several extra peaks in addition to the characteristic peak of anatase TiO2 in the XRD pattern (Fig. S3†), indicating that the product was not pure anatase TiO2 and other Ti-complex intermediates also existed. In addition, the morphology and size of the obtained samples was very disorganized, consisting of particles with diameters from dozens of nanometers to several micrometers (Fig. S1a†), and they were all solid inside, which was confirmed by TEM (Fig. S2a†). As the concentration of oxalic acid dihydrate gradually increased, the products became anatase TiO2 (from a 1:8 ratio), with the crystallinity of the products enhancing gradually, and the morphology became increasingly well-organized. Most interestingly, a hollow interior structure began to emerge when the molar ratio of oxalic acid became greater than 11 (Fig. S2d†). Based on these results, one can conclude that the oxalic acid dihydrate played a crucial role in the formation of the TiO2 hollow structures, not only influencing the crystallinity of the products, but also the morphology and structure of the TiO2 products.To further investigate the formation mechanism of the hollow spheres, time-dependent synthesis experiments were performed. SEM and TEM images, and XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples via different reaction times (0.75 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h and 12 h) are shown in Fig. 2 and S4,† respectively. Smooth spherical particles with diameters of about 600 nm were obtained when the reaction time was only 0.75 h. As the reaction time was extended, the diameter of the products increased gradually, from about 600 nm to 1.3 μm, and remained at about 1.3 μm after 3 h. At the same time, the surface of the products gradually changed from glossy to rough, and nanoparticles can be clearly observed on the surface of the products obtained after 2 h (Fig. 2). A rough surface consisting of small nanoparticles should be beneficial to dye adsorption when used as the photoanode material in DSSCs. What's more, as determined by the TEM images (Fig. 2, inset), the products were solid spheres at first, becoming hollow structures as the reaction time was extended beyond 2 h, and the thickness of the shells decreased gradually from about 300 nm after 2 h to 180 nm after 12 h. As far as the crystalline structure of the products is concerned, it was found that the crystallinity transformation of TiO2 from an amorphous structure to anatase crystal was in good accordance with the formation process of the hollow structures. That is, the products were amorphous under short reaction times (0.75 h, 1 h, 1.5 h), while anatase TiO2 products were formed in cases where the reaction time was longer than 2 h, and the crystallinity enhanced gradually as the reaction time was extended. Additionally, the crystallization of TiO2 was accompanied by the formation of hollow structures and the wall thickness decreased slowly with the extended reaction time. Fig. 2  SEM images of the prepared samples with different reaction times ((a) 0.75 h, (b) 1 h, (c) 1.5 h, (d) 2 h, (e) 3 h and (f) 12 h). The insets are the typical TEM images of the corresponding samples. According to these observations, a possible formation process of the anatase TiO2 hollow spheres can be concluded. Firstly, titanium n-butoxide reacts with oxalic acid to form the solid spherical intermediate products. It has been reported that the carboxyl group could potentially coordinate with the titanium in a chelating, bridging bidentate or monodentate mode, e.g., typical hexamer complexes, Ti6O4(OBun)8(OAc)8 or Ti6O6(OiPr)6(OAc)6 can be formed when acetic acid is used as the reagent.8,30,31 The as-formed intermediate complex should be calcined further to form anatase crystals. In contrast to the monocarboxylic acid, the oxalic acid used the in present system has two carboxyl groups in each molecule to coordinate with the Ti, therefore, the coordination reaction should be much more complicated, and finally form a solid spherical intermediate complex during the solvothermal process. Then, the diameter of the solid spheres enlarges gradually and the intermediate products are transformed to anatase TiO2, with an accompanying improved crystallinity with increasing reaction time. Finally, hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres consisting of nanoparticles are obtained by the Ostwald ripening process.32,33 Moreover, this transformation process was also monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S5,† for the product obtained after 0.75 h, the signal at around 535 cm−1 corresponds to the characteristic peak of the Ti–O bond.30 The signal at around 815 cm−1 can be assigned to the titanium n-butoxide monomer. The peaks at 1305, 1350, 1407 and 1678 cm−1, which can be assigned to the C–O stretching mode, symmetric and assymmetric stretching modes of the carboxylate binding modes, and the CO stretching mode, respectively, indicate the formation of a Ti complex intermediate. As the reaction time was extended to more than 2 h, the signal at around 815 cm−1 disappears, indicating the consumption of the titanium n-butoxide monomer to form TiO2, but the peaks at 1260, 1406 and 1719 cm−1 indicate that some intermediates also exist in the products. When the reaction time was increased to 12 h, the product was almost pure TiO2, and the crystallinity of the product was relatively high. The existence of the Ti complex intermediate during the reaction process is further confirmed by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Fig. S6†). As the temperature increased to 600 °C, the weight loss of the 2 h products is about 26%, indicating the existence of many organic groups, while there is almost no mass loss for the 12 h product.The hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres were further used as the photoanode material for DSSC applications. For comparison, two types of photoanode film (15.0 μm P25, denoted as Cell P25 and 15.0 μm TiO2 hollow spheres, denoted as Cell HS) were screen-printed onto the FTO glass with a pre-coated TiO2 compact layer. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on the different photoanode films, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. For the TiO2 hollow sphere and P25 nanoparticle-based photoanodes of the same thickness, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of Cell HS (808 mV) is a little higher than that of Cell P25 (796 mV), which should be due to the lower electron recombination in the former cell. However, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of Cell HS (11.07 mA cm−2) is much lower than that of Cell P25 (14.07 mA cm−2), which can be ascribed to the lower dye loading for the former. According to the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the solutions containing dyes detached from the photoanodes, the saturated dye adsorption results indicate that the dye loading of the TiO2 hollow sphere film is 95 nmol cm−2, lower than that of the P25 film (128 nmol cm−2). Generally, a lower amount of dye loading will lead to a lower photo-generated current density. However, the micrometer-sized hollow spheres can effectively scatter the incident light, which can compensate for the negative effect of the lower dye loading. As a result, the overall conversion efficiency (η) of the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere-based cell is 6.33%, a little lower than that of the P25 nanoparticle-based cell of the same thickness (7.69%). Fig. 3  The photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSCs based on the different working electrodes, measured under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).

It has been reported that hierarchical microspheres consisting of nanoparticles usually exhibit an enhanced light scattering effect, hence leading to a larger photocurrent.34 As shown in Fig. 4a, the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere film shows a strong reflectance of light over the range of 400–800 nm with a high value above 50%, while the reflectance of the P25 film is lower, especially in the range of 600–700 nm, where an obvious valley can be observed. This strong diffuse reflection capability of the hollow sphere film can be attributed to the comparable sphere size to the wavelength of visible and near infrared light. In addition, the special irregular multi-shell hollow structure of our product may also contribute to the high scattering effect. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the irregular multi-shell structure formed from multiple merged hollow microspheres can multiply reflect and scatter the incident light, which will effectively enhance the optical pathway of the incident light. As a result, a higher diffuse reflection capability in the visible and near infrared regions in comparison with the P25 nanoparticle film is achieved. The high scattering effect will definitely increase the light harvesting efficiency of the photoanode, thus resulting in an enhanced photocurrent density for the DSSCs based on hollow sphere films. Fig. 5 shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two cells as a function of the wavelength. Compared to Cell P25, Cell HS exhibits a slightly lower IPCE over the whole spectrum range, which should be a result of the lower amount of dye anchored onto the hollow sphere film. However, a relatively smaller difference between the two cells in the long wavelength region can be observed, indicating that the stronger light scattering effect of the hollow sphere film contributes to the photocurrent. This result is in agreement with the Jsc data. Fig. 4  (a) Diffuse reflectance spectra of the P25 and HS films without dye loading; (b) schematic of the light pathway in the multi-shell hollow structures.  Fig. 5  Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of Cell P25 and Cell HS, respectively, as a function of the wavelength. According to the J–V data, the TiO2 hollow sphere-based cell exhibits a lower Jsc but a higher Voc value compared to the commercial P25 nanoparticle cell. In general, the Voc value is quite sensitive to the recombination resistance and electron lifetime in the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the electron recombination processes of the two cells. The measurements were carried out in the dark, under a forward bias of −800 mV. As shown in Fig. 6, two semicircles can be observed in the Nyquist curves. The smaller semicircle at the high frequency region can be assigned to the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, and the larger semicircle at the middle frequency region can be assigned to the recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The resistance values were fitted by Z-view software using an equivalent circuit containing resistance (R) and a constant phase element (CPE) (Fig. 6, inset), and the simulated values of resistance (R2) and capacitance (CPE2) are summarized in Table 2. The DSSCs based on the two photoanodes display similar charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1) due to the use of the same Pt/FTO counter electrode and I−/I3− electrolyte. However, the recombination resistance R2 of Cell HS (103.4 ohm) is larger than that of Cell P25 (88.6 ohm), indicating a slower electron recombination process for the former, that is, the more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electrons with the I3− in the electrolyte in the former cell. The electron lifetime estimated by τ = R2 × CPE2 is 115 ms for Cell HS, much higher than for Cell P25 (85 ms), which implies a higher Voc for the former cell.

The electron transport time τd (or lifetime τr) can be calculated from the expression τd = 1/2πfIMPS (τr = 1/2πfIMVS), where fIMPS (or fIMVS) is the characteristic frequency of the minimum IMPS (or IMVS) imaginary component. As shown in Fig. 7, both the electron transport time and lifetime of the two cells decrease with the increase in light intensity, but both of the values for Cell HS are longer than that for Cell P25, indicating slower electron transport but a longer electron lifetime in Cell HS. The slower electron transport of Cell HS should be mainly due to the fact that the dye loading of the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere film is lower than that of the P25 film, which would result in a lower photocurrent density, lower electron density gradient and hence a longer electron transport time. However, the electron lifetime or recombination time of Cell HS is longer than for Cell P25. This may be due to the good connectivity among the nanoparticles in the TiO2 hollow spheres, and fewer trapping sites for electrons which could reduce the electron recombination reaction. A longer electron lifetime will lead to a higher Voc, indicating a higher photovoltage for Cell HS. This result is consistent with the J–V data and the EIS measurements. Fig. 7  Electron transport time and electron lifetime of the DSSCs based on the P25 and HS photoanodes, measured by IMPS and IMVS at different light densities. Furthermore, the electron recombination process in the different photoanode-based DSSCs was investigated by open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. To investigate the electron recombination kinetics, the transient Voc as a function of time upon switching off the light can be monitored. When the illumination of cell is switched off under a steady voltage, the Voc, which is related to the electron lifetime, will decay sharply because of the electron recombination. As shown in Fig. 8, it is evident that Cell HS shows a slower voltage decay rate compared to Cell P25, which means a longer electron lifetime for the former cell. This indicates that the hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres can effectively inhibit the back electron recombination reaction between electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and oxidative species in the electrolyte. The lifetime of the photo-generated electrons (τn), which is defined as the average time that the photo-generated electrons exist for before they recombine, can be calculated by the following equation, τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature,36 and the result is shown in Fig. 8b. It is evident that the τn of Cell HS is longer than for Cell P25. This result is in good agreement with the EIS, IMPS and IMVS studies discussed above. According to these results, one can conclude that the strong light scattering ability and the excellent electron transport and recombination performance make the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere film a good candidate for efficient DSSC photoanode materials, although a slightly lower amount of dye molecules can be anchored on this film than the P25 nanoparticle film due to their quite loose interior structure. Fig. 8  The open-circuit voltage decay curves of DSSCs based on the different photoanodes (a), and the electron lifetime determined from the open-circuit voltage-decay measurements (b). According to these results, a bi-layer structured photoanode was constructed by using a hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere film as the light scattering layer, so as to further improve the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 9a, the bi-layer photoanode with a 15 μm P25 bottom layer and a 4 μm hollow sphere top layer (Cell P25 + HS) shows a Jsc of 15.99 mA cm−2, Voc of 801 mV, FF of 0.68, an overall conversion efficiency of 8.76% and dye adsorption of 144 nmol cm−2. Compared with the single-layer P25 photoanode of the same thickness (Cell P25: Jsc of 14.76 mA cm−2, Voc of 794 mV, FF of 0.68, η of 7.91% and dye adsorption of 150 nmol cm−2), the Jsc of the bi-layer structure photoanode-based cell is much higher, although the dye adsorption amount of the former is a little lower than that of the latter, which should be a result of the strong light scattering ability of the hierarchical hollow structure. Fig. 9b shows the normalized IPCE curves of the DSSCs with different photoanodes. It is clear that the double-layer film-based cell exhibits an obviously higher IPCE value in the long wavelength region (beyond 550 nm) compared to the single-layer film, which should be a result of the better light scattering efficiency of the hollow spheres. It is well known that the scattering efficiency in the DSSCs is higher in the long wavelength region because more light is transmitted through the photoanode and scattered in this region. These results further confirm that the good light scattering ability of the TiO2 hollow spheres can increase the light harvesting efficiency, thus resulting in the enhanced photocurrent density of the DSSCs. As a result, a conversion efficiency as high as 8.76% is obtained. This result further indicates that the hierarchical hollow structures synthesized via a simple one pot solvothermal method can work as excellent photoanode materials for DSSCs.

ConclusionsIn summary, hierarchical TiO2 hollow spheres consisting of small anatase nanoparticles are successfully prepared via a very simple template-free solvothermal method using titanium n-butoxide and oxalic acid dihydrate as the precursors. This detailed investigation reveals that in addition to the reaction time, the molar ratio of oxalic acid dihydrate to titanium n-butoxide in the precursor reagents plays a key role in the crystallization of TiO2, as well as the formation of the hollow architecture. The DSSCs based on the hierarchical TiO2 hollow sphere photoanode show a significant power conversion efficiency of 6.33% due to their strong light scattering ability and longer electron lifetime compared to commercial P25 nanoparticles. The TiO2 hollow spheres can effectively scatter the incident sun light with a reflectance greater than 50% in the range of 400–800 nm. Moreover, the TiO2 hollow spheres can effectively inhibit the back electron recombination reaction in the DSSCs. A bi-layer structured photoelectrode using a TiO2 hollow sphere film as the scattering layer on top of a P25 film exhibits an overall conversion efficiency of 8.76% under AM 1.5G one sun light intensity, ∼14% higher than that of the DSSCs based on pristine P25 film, indicating that the hollow spheres can work as a promising candidate photoanode material for efficient DSSCs.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (20873183, 201103236, U0934003, J1103305), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-11-0533), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (S2011040001464), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (Grant no. 201104374) and the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20100171110014, 20110171120026).Notes and referencesL.
