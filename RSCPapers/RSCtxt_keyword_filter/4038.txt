    , Accepted 9th April 2016First published on 11th April 2016AbstractThe power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PbS quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) reported are typically below 6%. This poor efficiency is mainly derived from the serious charge recombination in internal QDs and at the interface of QDs/TiO2/electrolyte. In this work, PbS/CdS QDs with a core/shell structure, which were used as the photosensitizer to fabricate sensitized solar cells, were prepared through the ion exchange method. With the reduced trapping state defects on the surface of the PbS QDs and resulting effective suppression of adverse charge recombination, the PbS/CdS QD-based cells have been improved remarkably in comparison with the pristine PbS-based QDSCs. By optimization of the thickness of the CdS shell, a PCE of 7.19% under one full sun illumination was obtained on the fabricated devices, which is among the best performances for liquid-junction PbS QDSCs.
1. Introduction
The utilization of regenerable clean energies, especially solar energy, has been supposed to be an effective way to solve the crises resulting from the increasingly severe environmental pollution and global warming.1 Benefiting from multiple exciton generation (MEG), quantum dot-based solar cells with a theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 44% have become one of the promising candidates for new generation solar cells.2–6 The application of PbS QDs with a narrow bandgap of 0.41 eV, a high absorption coefficient of 1 to 5 × 105 cm−1 and a large Bohr exciton radius of 18 nm, in QDSCs makes it possible to harvest the near-infrared solar energy of the solar spectrum.7,8 A PCE over 10% was recently reported for PbS QD-based depleted heterojunction solar cells.9,10 Nevertheless, the diffusion length of minority charge carriers is commonly shorter than their bandgap optical absorption length, which may affect the absorption of solar irradiation and thus limit the performance of heterojunction solar cells.5,11,12 Seeing that sensitized solar cells have the advantages of rapid exciton dissociation by n-type semiconductors (commonly TiO2) and a sufficient absorption amount of QD photosensitizers over the mesoporous film of photoanodes, a simultaneous improvement of optical absorption and electron extraction can be realized in sensitized solar cells.4,13
By the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, Lee and co-workers fabricated PbS QDSCs with a Jsc of 24.17 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.73%.14 Also based on the SILAR method, Park's group reported Hg:PbS QDSCs with an unprecedentedly high photocurrent density (Jsc) of 30 mA cm−2 and a corresponding PCE of 5.6%.15 Although a high Jsc has been achieved from the high coverage through the SILAR method, the PCE of QDSCs still cannot be comparable with that of depleted heterojunction solar cells.9–12 Such a result could be partly ascribed to the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) derived from the undesirable charge recombination in internal QDs as well as at the interfaces of the QD/TiO2/electrolyte.16,17 Because of the easy tailoring of crystallinity, size distribution and surface states of QD sensitizers, the utilization of pre-synthesized QDs is supposed to be an alternative approach to improve the performance and enhance the reproducibility of QDSCs.16,18–24 However, the performance of liquid-junction PbS QDSCs based on pre-synthesized QDs is far from satisfaction so far.25–28 Using L-glutathione (GSH) as linker ligands, pre-synthesized PbS QDs were deposited on a photoanode film, achieving a PCE of 1.1%.26 Also, PbS/CdS core/shell QDs were directly deposited on a mesoporous TiO2 film without the assistance of linker ligands to construct QDSCs with a PCE of 1.28%.27 By electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of pre-synthesized QDs, a PCE of 2.1% was reported for PbS QDSCs.28 Furthermore, a high density of trap defect states on the QD surface can serve as the trapping states for photo-excited carriers. This would seriously deteriorate the performance of the liquid-junction PbS QDSCs.17
Herein, PbS/CdS sensitized QDSCs with a record PCE of 7.19% under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination were constructed using a polysulfide electrolyte and Cu2S/FTO counter electrode. The PbS/CdS core/shell QDs were prepared through = cation exchange of pre-synthesized PbS QDs with Cd2+ ions.29 The capping ligand-induced self-assembly technique was used to tether PbS/CdS QDs on mesoporous film photoanodes, and the sensitized photoanodes were then coated with a ZnS/SiO2 thin layer.16,30 Compared to the reference plain PbS QDSCs, the obtained PbS/CdS QDSCs present a significant enhancement in photovoltage as well as photocurrent, and thus overall conversion efficiency. These results are ascribed to the reduction in adverse charge recombination at internal QDs as well as at QDs/TiO2/electrolyte interfaces.
2. Experimental section
Chemicals
Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.999%), lead oxide (PbO, 99.999%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%) and bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide ((TMS)2S, 95%) were purchased from Aldrich Sigma. Oleic acid (OA, 90%) and thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All reagents were used without further purification.
Synthesis of PbS and PbS/CdS core/shell QDs
The colloidal PbS QDs were synthesized according to the method reported by Hines and co-workers.31 Briefly, 0.8 mmol of PbO powder, 0.5 mL of OA, and 7.5 mL of ODE were mixed in a 25.0 mL three-neck flask, which was then heated to 100 °C with pumping. After being degassed for 30 min at 100 °C, the mixture was heated up to 150 °C under N2 flow. When the solution turned clear, 0.084 mL of (TMS)2S dissolved in 2.0 mL of ODE was rapidly injected into the above solution followed by removing the heating mantle. After the temperature was cooled down to room temperature, the prepared PbS QDs were separated from the reaction solution by centrifugation following the addition of hexane and acetone, and then dispersed in 10 mL of toluene.
The PbS/CdS QDs were synthesized by the ion exchange procedure described in the literature.29 In a typical procedure, 0.75 mmol of CdO was added into a mixture of 7.5 mL OA and 7.5 mL ODE followed by heating to 230 °C to give a 0.05 M Cd precursor solution of a light yellow color. 5.0 mL of the above Cd precursor was transferred into another 25 mL three-neck flask, which was degassed for about 30 min at 100 °C, and then cooled to 80 °C before 5 mL of purified PbS QDs dispersed in toluene was injected. The reaction was monitored using UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. When the desired QDs were achieved, 5 mL of toluene was injected into the reaction solution to quench the QD growth, and the oil-soluble PbS/CdS QDs were finally obtained.
Both the water-soluble PbS and PbS/CdS QDs were obtained using TGA as the phase transfer agent via the ligand exchange method.32,33 Experimental details are available in the ESI.†
Construction of QDSC devices
TiO2 mesoporous films composed of a 9.0 ± 0.5 μm transparent layer and a 6.0 ± 0.5 μm light scattering layer were prepared by screen printing on FTO following our previous reports.34 The TGA-capped water-soluble QDs were deposited on the TiO2 mesoporous film by dropping 40 μL aqueous solution of TGA-capped QDs onto the TiO2 film surface and allowing it to stand for 3 h in the refrigerator (4 °C) before being rinsed with water and ethanol sequentially. The above photoanodes were first coated with ZnS layers by immersing the photoanodes into Zn(OAc)2 and Na2S aqueous solutions (0.1 M for both) alternately for 4 cycles and 1 min per dip. Then the SiO2 passivation layer was coated by soaking the electrodes in 0.01 M tetraethyl orthosilicate ethanol solution at 35 °C for 2 h.30 The Cu2S/FTO counter electrodes were obtained according to our previous reports.35 The polysulfide electrolyte is composed of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S and 0.2 M KCl in distilled water. The solar cells were constructed by assembling the Cu2S/FTO counter electrode and QD sensitized TiO2 film electrode with a binder clip separated by a 50 μm thick Scotch spacer. Polysulfide electrolyte solution was then injected into the cell.
Characterization
Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument. The UV-vis absorption spectra and PL emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 and a Cary Eclipse (Varian) spectrophotometer, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was done using Thermo Elemental IRIS 1000. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was acquired using a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer. Photovoltaic performances of the QDSC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter with a 150 W AM 1.5 G solar simulator at a sweep rate of 60 mV s−1. The intensity of the simulated solar light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a standard silicon solar cell, and the photo-active area is 0.235 cm2 defined by a black plastic circular mask. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained by a Keithley 2000 multimeter. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Zennium) in dark conditions at a forward bias from 0 to Voc applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). During the measurement, the devices were illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the dependence of photovoltage on time was recorded after the switch-off of the light. Transient absorption (TA) setups were used to characterize the samples in the femtosecond (fs) time range. The laser source was a titanium/sapphire laser (CPA-2010, Clark-MXR Inc.) with a wavelength of 775 nm, repetition rate of 1 kHz, and pulse width of 150 fs. The light was separated into two parts: one as a probe pulse, the other as a pump light to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) (a TOAPS from Quantronix) to generate light pulses with a wavelength tunable from 290 nm to 3 μm. In this study, a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe beam wavelength of 1030 nm were used.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis and optical properties of PbS/CdS QDs
High quality PbS QDs were synthesized using leadoleate and bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide according to the literature method.31 A thin layer of CdS shell was then coated on the surface of the PbS QDs via the ion exchange method.29 The detailed procedure is available in the experimental section. By changing the molar ratio of Pb/Cd and reaction time, core/shell QDs with various shell thicknesses can be easily synthesized. The evolution of absorption and PL emission spectra with the growth of the CdS shell are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. With the thickening of the CdS shell, both the absorption onset and the band-edge PL emission peak shift systematically to the short wavelength side. Moreover, the PL intensity is significantly enhanced with the increase of the CdS shell thickness (Fig. 1b), indicating efficient reduction of surface trap states of the PbS QDs by CdS shell formation. It should be noted that no CdS nucleation was formed separately during the ion exchange process, since no new peak appears in both the absorption and the PL emission spectra after CdS overgrowth.

Insets of (c) and (d) are high resolution TEM images of (c) and (d), respectively. 
During the ion exchange process, the size of the QDs remains nearly constant as observed by the TEM images (Fig. 1c and d). The PbS/CdS QDs with an absorption peak of 837 nm have an average particle size of 3.3 nm, which is similar to that of the PbS QDs before the ion exchange reaction. The high resolution TEM image in the inset of Fig. 1c confirms the cubic rock salt crystal structure of the PbS QDs. However, due to the similarity in crystal structure and lattice constant of CdS and PbS, it is difficult to determine the epitaxial CdS shell using high resolution TEM (insets of Fig. 1c and d). The blue shift of absorption onset and PL emission peak of the QDs can be ascribed to the shrinking of the PbS core with the growth of the CdS shell by replacing Pb with Cd.29,36 Following the reported method,37,38 the PbS core diameter and the shell thickness were estimated according to eqn (1): Eg = 0.41 + (0.0252d2 + 0.283d)−1(1)where Eg is the bandgap of the PbS core (or QDs) as determined by the first excitonic peak in the absorption spectrum and d represents the diameter of the PbS core (or QDs) in nm. The estimated core diameter and shell thickness of the PbS/CdS QDs are shown in Table 1. Following the results, the PbS/CdS QDs with various shell thicknesses are denoted as PbS/CdSx, where x represents the CdS shell thickness in nm.

XRD was measured to reveal the formation of the CdS shell on the PbS surface and this is shown in Fig. 2. Compared with the XRD pattern of the pristine PbS QDs, a slight shift of the peak positions can be observed in the XRD pattern of the PbS/CdS core/shell QDs. Moreover, the relative peak intensities are obviously influenced by the CdS thickness. This result demonstrates the formation of the CdS shell with a zincblende structure on the rock salt PbS core.36,38 To further confirm the formation of the CdS shell around the PbS core, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was recorded and the Pb/Cd ratios of the QD samples are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The reduction trend of the Pb/Cd ratios from ICP-AES data indicates the increase of the CdS shell thickness.

The chemical stability of PbS QDs is an important parameter for their application in QDSCs. The stabilities of both the PbS and core/shell PbS/CdS QDs were evaluated by monitoring the absorption spectra of QD toluene dispersions which were stored in ambient conditions (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), the absorption edge of the PbS QDs exhibits a remarkable blue shift (∼44 nm) after 4 weeks, and the poor stability of PbS QDs in air was also found by other groups.39,40 The instability of the pristine PbS QDs is mainly attributed to the surface oxidation of PbS QDs, resulting in size reduction (blue shift of absorption and PL spectra) and uncontrolled defect distribution, thereby deteriorating the optical and electrical properties of the QDs.40,41 The time dependence of the absorption spectra of the PbS/CdS QDs with different shell thicknesses was also recorded, and is illustrated in Fig. S1b–e (ESI†). After being stored in air for 4 weeks, the absorption spectra of the PbS/CdS QDs with various CdS thicknesses show no significant blue shift (<5 nm). The superior stability of the PbS/CdS QDs in air can be ascribed to the surface passivation of the PbS QDs by the CdS coating layer that isolates the PbS core from the oxygen in the air, thereby avoiding oxidation by oxygen. The stability in air of the PbS/CdS QDs should be beneficial to the performance of the resultant cell devices.
Performance of PbS/CdS QDSCs
UV absorption spectra of QD sensitized TiO2 mesoporous films (PbS/CdS–TiO2 films) composed of a 9.0 μm transparent layer without scattering layers have been measured and are shown in Fig. 3a. Compared with those of the QD dispersion in toluene, the absorption peaks of the PbS/CdS–TiO2 films are broadened and have a red shift of ∼10 nm, correspondingly. This can be ascribed to electron injection from the PbS QD or PbS/CdS QD sensitizers into the conduction band of the TiO2 film.42 Moreover, with an increase of the CdS shell, the absorption onset of the PbS/CdS–TiO2 films exhibits systematically a blue shift. But the excitonic peak intensity of the PbS/CdS–TiO2 films shows no obvious change with the thickening CdS layer, and their intensities are comparable to that of the PbS–TiO2 film. The phenomena demonstrate the similar adsorption amounts of PbS/CdS QDs with various shell thicknesses onto the TiO2 film to that of the PbS QDs. This means that the formation of the CdS shell has no influence on the absorption amount of QDs on TiO2 films.

Following our previous procedure, the prepared PbS/CdS QDs as well as PbS QDs were applied as photosensitizers to construct sensitized solar cells using Cu2S/FTO as the counter anode and polysulfide as the electrolyte.30,32–35 The J–V curves of the QDSCs based on PbS/CdS QDs with different CdS thicknesses and the reference PbS QDs are shown in Fig. 3b, and the main photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. It can be observed that the QDSCs using PbS/CdS0.33 nm QDs as sensitizers exhibit the best performance with Jsc = 18.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.595 V, FF = 0.642, and PCE = 7.19% under simulated AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination. With the increase of the shell thickness from 0 to 0.40 nm, the open-circuit voltage increased systematically from 0.375 V to 0.616 V. The enhancement of Voc can be mainly attributed to the effective suppression of charge recombination by the coating CdS layer (discussed below). However, with the thickening of the CdS layer, the value of Jsc was first significantly improved from 7.59 to 19.49 mA cm−2 and then decreased from 19.49 to 14.55 mA cm−2. The enhancement of Jsc of the PbS/CdS-based QDSCs can be attributed to the increase of both the charge collection efficiency ηc and electron injection efficiency ϕinj, while the subsequent decrease of Jsc should be ascribed to the reduction of the light absorption efficiency and the partial suppression of charge injection by the continuous increase of the CdS barrier thickness. Similar results were also observed for PbS/CdS-based QDSCs, where the CdS shell can effectively suppress the adverse charge recombination but hinder the carrier injection from the PbS core to the TiO2 films.27,38

To further investigate the effect of the CdS shell on the performance of the fabricated QDSCs, the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured and are illustrated in Fig. 3c. The IPCE values increase continuously with the thickness of CdS ranging from 0 to 0.24 nm and then decrease with further formation of the CdS shell. The variation trend of the IPCE is consistent with that of the Jsc value described above. Although the subsequent shrinking of the PbS core with the thickening of the CdS shell results in the reduction of the systematic absorbance efficiency of the photoanode, the IPCE and Jsc values first increase with the CdS thickness ranging from 0 to 0.24 nm, and then decease with the continuous growth of the CdS layer. The IPCE and Jsc are not only determined by the light absorption efficiency of the QD sensitizers, but also by the charge injection efficiency from the QDs to TiO2 and the charge collection efficiency, because the IPCE can be expressed as follows eqn (2): IPCE(λ) = [1 − 10−abs(λ)] × ϕinj × ηc(2)where abs(λ) stands for the absorbance of the photoanode at wavelength λ, ϕinj for the electron injection efficiency, and ηc for the charge collection efficiency.43,44 Also, the absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (APCE) was calculated according to the following eqn (3):43,45 APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/[1 − 10−abs(λ)](3)
From Fig. 3d, the CdS thickness of 0.33 nm results in an optimal APCE value under the range of 450 to 850 nm.
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) of QDSCs
The OCVD analysis, providing information about electron recombination processes in QDSCs, was applied to investigate the effect of the CdS coating layer on the performance of the resultant QDSC devices. Before OCVD information was recorded, a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used as a light source to illuminate the cell devices to a steady voltage. The light was then switched off. The measured voltage decay curves for all devices are shown in Fig. 4a. It can be observed that the transient Voc values of all cells start from their open-circuit voltages, which are consistent with their corresponding Voc in Table 2, and then continuously decay to nearly 0 V in darkness. The decay rate of the PbS/CdS QDSCs is obviously slower than that of the pristine PbS QDSCs and a thicker shell of CdS results in a slower Voc decay rate. The electron lifetime (τn) of the devices, which can directly reflect the charge recombination of the devices, is correlative with the Voc decay rate. According to eqn (4), τn can be obtained from the Voc decay rate under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 4b). τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1(4)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T represents the absolute temperature, and e stands for the electronic charge.46 From Fig. 4b, it can be observed that the PbS/CdS QDSCs have a longer electron lifetime than that of the pristine PbS based QDSCs at the same potential. Moreover, the electron lifetimes increase with the thickening of the CdS shell. The enhanced electron lifetime may be ascribed to the reduction of the trapping states on the PbS QD surface. Therefore, the formation of the CdS shell can effectively reduce the trapping states of the PbS/CdS QDs, finally suppressing the charge recombination of the resultant QDSC devices and improving their ηc.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) of QDSCs
IS measurement has been investigated to further unveil the intrinsic mechanism of enhanced performance of the PbS QDSCs by the CdS protective layer. Under dark conditions, IS was recorded at a forward bias ranging from 0 V to Voc of the corresponding cells with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The detailed Nyquist plots for the cells based on the PbS/CdS QDs with various thicknesses of the CdS shell and reference PbS QDs under different bias are shown in Fig. S2a–e (ESI†). The fitting equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S2f (ESI†) was used to analyze the obtained IS data,17,47,48 and the extracted chemical capacitance Cμ, and recombination resistance Rrec, for the cells are illustrated in Fig. 5a and b. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, similar Cμ values for the constructed QDSCs based on PbS/CdS QDs with different thicknesses of the CdS layer as well as for the pristine PbS sensitizers can be observed, indicating that the inherent property of the different sensitizers has no obvious effect on the position of the conduction band-edge of TiO2.17 Notably, the Rrec values for the PbS/CdS QDSCs are bigger than that for the PbS QDSCs in the whole applied forward bias range and the Rrec values increase with the thickening of the CdS layer. It can be concluded that the thicker CdS shell is more effective at the suppression of charge recombination between the QD sensitizers/TiO2/interfaces. This can contribute to the reduction of the surface trap density of the PbS core by CdS shell passivation, resulting in the switch-off of the back electron transfer routes. As shown in Fig. 5c, the observed dark current in the PbS/CdS QDSCs gradually weakens with the increase of the CdS shell thickness, further confirming the effective inhibition of charge recombination at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte. In addition, the calculated electron lifetime τn from the IS results (τn = Rrec × Cμ) exhibits a longer value for the cells with a thicker CdS shell, and the result is in good agreement with that of the OCVD discussed above.

Transient absorption (TA)
To study the excited state dynamics and the electron injection rate from PbS/CdS and the pristine PbS QDs to TiO2 substrates, femtosecond (fs) and nanosecond (ns) transient absorption (TA) were employed.49,50 QD photosensitizers were deposited on insulating SiO2 films or semiconductor TiO2 films following the procedure for photoanode preparation. The normalized TA decay curves of the QD sensitizers deposited on both TiO2 and SiO2 substrates are shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of the QD photosensitizers cannot inject into the SiO2 substrates because of the insulating property of SiO2. From Fig. 6, the bleaching recovery of all the QD sensitizers absorbed on TiO2 is significantly faster than that of the QDs on insulating SiO2, indicating that photo-generated electrons in the QDs can effectively inject into TiO2. All the TA kinetics can be fitted very well to a bi-exponential function of eqn (5): Y = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(5)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes, and A1 and A2 are the relative weights of the two components. The average lifetime τav of the photo-excited carriers can be calculated using eqn (6), and the electron injection rate constant ket from the QDs to TiO2 can be obtained from eqn (7):51 τav = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(6) ket = 1/τav(QD/TiO2) − 1/τav(QD/SiO2)(7)

The bold lines represent the corresponding bi-exponential fit. 
The parameters of all samples are listed in Table 3. It can be found that the values of τ1, τ2 and τav of SiO2/PbS/CdS are much longer than those of the SiO2/PbS samples. Furthermore, the lifetimes of the photo-excited carriers of the QDs deposited on the SiO2 substrate are enhanced with the growth of the CdS layer, revealing that the CdS coating layer can effectively reduce the surface defects of the PbS QDs. Thus, the growth of the CdS layer should be beneficial to the inhibition of the internal recombination of the QDs (the recombination before the photo-generated electrons injection into TiO2).

Among the samples of the PbS and PbS/CdS QDs deposited on TiO2, TiO2/PbS/CdS0.33 nm shows the shortest τ1, τ2 and τav. Notably, the rate constant of the PbS/CdS0.33 nm system (2.7 × 1010 s−1) is ∼3 times higher than that of the PbS system (0.8 × 1010 s−1). For the QDs deposited on the TiO2 samples, the difference of the conduction band energy levels between the QDs and TiO2 semiconductor serves as a driving force for electron transfer from the excited QDs to TiO2 semiconductor after illumination.52,53 With the increase of the energy difference, the electron injection rate would increase.52,53 In our PbS/CdS QD system, the absorption peak blue shifts with the growth of the CdS shell (Fig. 1a), resulting in the widening of the QD bandgap (Table 1). The conduction band commonly up shifts with the widening of the PbS QD bandgap because the effective mass of an election is significantly smaller than that of a hole.54 Therefore, the PbS/CdS QDs with a thicker shell are expected to have a higher conduction band position (i.e. more negative potential versus NHE) and consequently a faster electron injection rate (Fig. 7). However, the CdS shell of the type-I PbS/CdS core/shell QDs could act as an energy barrier for electron injection from the QDs into TiO2, and the inhibition should be enhanced with the increase of the CdS shell. Therefore, the trade-off between the two factors gives the result that the rate constant of the PbS/CdS QDs with a 0.33 nm CdS shell is 2-fold higher than that of the QDs with a 0.40 nm CdS shell.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the formation of a CdS layer on the PbS core surface was achieved via the ion exchange approach during which Pb2+ ions on the surface of PbS QDs were replaced by Cd2+ ions. The experimental results show that the stability of PbS QDs in the ambient environment can be significantly improved by a CdS protective layer. Moreover, the PL QY of the PbS/CdS QDs is gradually enhanced with the growth of the CdS shell, indicating the obvious reduction of trapping state defects on the surface of the PbS QDs. The prepared PbS/CdS QDs were used as photosensitizers to fabricate solar devices. Compared with that of the pristine PbS-based QDSCs, the formation of a CdS layer on the PbS QD surface can significantly enhance the values of the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the overall PCE of the constructed QDSCs. By optimizing the thickness of the CdS shell, the fabricated devices achieved a PCE of 7.19% (Jsc = 18.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.595 V, FF = 0.642) under one full sun illumination. The experimental data of OVCD, IS and TA measurements reveal that the remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance of the PbS QDSCs is attributed to the effective suppression of adverse charge recombination.
