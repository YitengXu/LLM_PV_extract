    , Accepted 12th August 2015First published on 13th August 2015AbstractOwing to the lattice match, aligned CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite array films composed of CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons with the length at the sub-millimeter scale were fabricated on ST cut quartz which showed a fast photo-response. This method provides a simple and flexible approach to grow oriented crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 arrays at the millimeter scale.
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) based solar cells pioneered by Kojima et al. have obtained a significant improvement in power conversion efficiency from 3.8% to 20.1% in the past five years.1–22 It is well known that the diffusion length of perovskite layers, which is closely related to the film crystallinity and morphology, plays a key role in the performances of the device. Numerous efforts have been made to enhance the photovoltaic performance by improving the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbX3 films and therefore increasing the diffusion length.2,13–17,20,23 Horváth et al. first prepared lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) nanowires with a length up to 10 μm.24 Shi et al. obtained crack-free MAPbX3 single crystals exceeding 100 mm3 in volume and observed low trap-state density and large carrier diffusion lengths above 10 μm.23 Nie et al. reported solution-processed perovskite solar cells with millimeter-scale grains and recorded efficiencies approaching 18% with little cell-to-cell variability.20
Besides the crystallinity, it is known that the organization or the arrangements of the materials is also an important issue. For example, oriented arrays of one-dimensional single crystalline ZnO and TiO2, compared to random polycrystalline nanostructures showed longer electron diffusion length and faster charge transport, which provides a solution to further improve the performances of solar devices.25,26 Yet, until now, there is no report on the preparation of well-aligned lead halide perovskite crystals.
Epitaxy has shown to be a powerful strategy to prepare ordered crystalline nanostructures of a wide variety of materials such as giant magnetoresistance nanostructures, semiconducting thin films, and graphene.27–31 Lattice match between the substrate and the target material is essential in epitaxial growth. With a suitable substrate, we may be able to epitaxially grow ordered CH3NH3PbX3 crystals.
We find that the surface of ST cut quartz, which has been widely used to guide the growth of horizontally aligned single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) arrays,32–35 shows similar structural characteristics to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 as shown in Scheme 1. Along the [1 0 0] direction on the surface of ST cut quartz, which is just the direction SWNT oriented, there is a structural period with a scale of 19.65 Å (la). The lattice spacing of (0 0 1) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 is 12.68 Å (d001).1 It can be found that 2la ≈ 3d001 with a mismatch of 3.2%. (1 0 1) plane in CH3NH3PbI3, whose dihedral angle with the (0 0 1) plane is 55.0°, present a lattice spacing of 7.30 Å (d101). In the surface lattice of ST cut quartz, along the direction of 54.5° apart from [1 0 0], a period of 16.91 Å (lb) exists. It can also be found that 2lb ≈ 5d101 with a mismatch of 7.0%. This length adaption is not perfect but still acceptable. However, the angle mismatch is only 0.9%. Hence, ST cut quartz might be possible to act as the substrate for the epitaxial growth of crystallized CH3NH3PbI3 structures relying on the lattice match between the two materials. Also, the surface structure of X, Y, and Z cut quartz was also investigated as shown in Fig. S1† and the periodic lengths are listed in Table S1.† They do not show a good structural match to the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal.

We tried to use the slip-coating24 method to grow CH3NH3PbI3 crystals on the ST cut quartz substrate with DMF (N,N-dimethyl formamide) solution and a glass slide as the slip. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, aligned microribbon arrays with the length of hundreds of microns were grown on the surface of ST cut quartz. All peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample can be readily assigned to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 and the quartz substrate as shown in Fig. S2.† The intensive peaks appearing at 2θ of 13.9°, 14.3°, 28.0°, and 28.6° correspond to diffractions of (0 0 2), (1 1 0), (0 0 4), and (2 2 0) planes of CH3NH3PbI3, respectively.1 This indicates that well crystallized perovskite with good phase purity was formed on quartz. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d shows fringes perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the microribbon with the inter-distance of 3.2 Å, which is in good accordance with d004 (3.17 Å) of CH3NH3PbI3. The Fourier transform pattern of the HRTEM image can also be well ascribed to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore the microribbons extend along the [0 0 1] direction or c axis of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal.

The inset shows the TEM image of a single perovskite microribbon. The bar represents 2 μm. (c and d) TEM (c) and the HRTEM (d) image of the site pointed by the arrow in (c). The corresponding FFT pattern is inserted in (d). 
We also performed slip-coating under the same conditions on X, Y, and Z cut quartz, respectively. On these quartz substrates, CH3NH3PbI3 crystals were randomly oriented (Fig. 2b–d). But on ST cut quartz, no matter what direction we moved the slipping slide, the CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons were always oriented along the same direction, i.e. 45° to the margins of the quartz substrates as shown in Fig. 3. This is the same direction as the aligned SWNT arrays on ST cut quartz and we know it is the [1 0 0] direction of quartz.32,35 All these facts reveal that the surface lattice of ST cut quartz is responsible for the formation of aligned CH3NH3PbI3 ribbons. Taking the HRTEM characterization in Fig. 1 into account, it is obvious that the [0 0 1] direction of CH3NH3PbI3 parallels the [1 0 0] direction of quartz. This is in good accordance to what we already predicted in Scheme 1.

We carried out two-dimensional wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements in the 2θ range of 0 to 30° to further verify the structural correlation between CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons and the ST cut quartz. In the two-dimensional WAXD images, 2θ is represented by the distance to the center. Blank ST cut quartz only shows one diffraction spot at a 2θ of ∼26.6° (Fig. S3†), which was assigned to (1 0 1) planes of ST cut quartz (JCPDS no. 46-1045). This spot also appears in the diffraction patterns of ST cut quartz substrates with CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons (Fig. 4c and d). CH3NH3PbI3 microribbon arrays presents a strong diffraction spot at ∼13.9° (Fig. 4c); while disordered CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons only show a weak ring at the same diffraction angle (Fig. 4d), which corresponds to (0 0 2) planes of CH3NH3PbI3. This result indicates the good alignment of CH3NH3PbI3 microribbon arrays obtained by the slip-coating method. In WAXD patterns, the angle between the (0 0 2) plane of CH3NH3PbI3 and the (1 0 1) plane of ST cut quartz is about 43.0°. We know that the angle between (1 0 1) planes and (1 0 0) planes of ST cut quartz is ∼42.3°. Therefore, the c axis of CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons is parallel to the [1 0 0] direction of quartz. The WAXD measurements reveal the orientation of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal on ST cut quartz and provides further evidence for the epitaxial growth mechanism.

The thickness of the liquid films on the quartz substrate can be varied by changing the pressure exerted onto the slipping slide, and subsequently the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons can be easily adjusted. As shown in Fig. S4,† the average heights have been modulated from ∼400 nm to ∼2 μm, though some sophisticated techniques are needed to realize a precise control. Fig. 2e and f show the typical AFM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 microribbon arrays with a thickness of ∼700 nm. The widths of the ribbons are around hundreds of nanometers to several microns.
Because the CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons were formed on quartz, the samples are ready for direct detection of the UV-Vis-NIR absorption. The microribbons show intensive and broad absorption from UV to the near IR region until ∼800 nm as shown in Fig. S6.† The bandgap was estimated to be ∼1.6 eV, which is very similar to the reported values.1,4
Au electrodes with a thickness of 60 nm and 8 nm of Cr buffer layer were evaporated directly onto the quartz substrates with CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons to fabricate devices and their photo-response performances were studied (Fig. 5). The channel lengths between two electrodes are about 40 μm and the side lengths of the square Au electrodes are ∼200 μm. We measured the I–T curves at an ON/OFF interval of ∼10 s. The response time of the photocurrent was observed to be ∼0.1 s, which actually already reaches the limitation of our detector. The photocurrent of devices built on aligned microribbons is normally 5 times higher than the device of disordered CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons (Fig. S5†). In addition, a sample annealed at 80 °C for 2 hours was measured for comparison. No obvious difference in photoresponse performance was observed. This may indicate that MAPbI3 microribbons formed by epitaxial growth are already with considerable crystallinity.

Conclusions
In summary, aligned CH3NH3PbI3 array films with high-quality crystallization have been fabricated on ST cut quartz via a slip-coating method. The surface lattice of ST cut quartz acts as the template to guide the epitaxial growth of CH3NH3PbI3 microribbon arrays. The matching between the lattice spacing of (0 0 1) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 and the intervals along the [1 0 0] direction of ST cut quartz leads to the oriented growth of CH3NH3PbI3 microcrystals along the [1 0 0] direction of ST cut quartz, resulting in CH3NH3PbI3 microribbons extended along the c axis. These ribbons are in the length of the sub-millimeter scale, width of microns, and thickness of hundreds of nanometers to several microns depending on the preparation conditions. The elimination of grain boundaries is always desired for perovskite-based devices. The epitaxial growth on ST cut quartz provides a strategy to produce large scale aligned microribbon perovskite films with high crystallinity, which may bring about improved performance. In addition, the alignment of the microribbons should lead to heterogeneous performance along different directions, which can also be made use of in certain applications.
