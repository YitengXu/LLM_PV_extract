    , Accepted 28th January 2020First published on 4th February 2020AbstractPolyoxometalates (POMs) have been considered as an efficient catalyst for triiodide reduction in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). However, agglomeration of POMs limits the improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs. In this paper, we improve our previous synthesis process by a simple ultrasonic driving strategy. A series of highly dispersed POM nanoparticles periodically deposited on multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites (abbreviated as POMs/CNTs) is synthesized, which increases the active sites by improving the dispersion degree and inhibiting the aggregation of POM molecules. Additionally, CNTs as a conductive support skeleton and physical barrier promote the rapid electron transfer and protect POM molecules from chemical degradation. The nanocomposites exhibit well-distributed morphology, and highly dispersed POM nanoparticles about tens of nanometers in diameter are in intimate contact with CNTs. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that POM nanoparticles have been periodically deposited on CNTs. POM/CNT counterelectrodes (CEs) exhibit a more remarkable performance towards triiodide reduction than pure CNT CEs, indicating that POMs deposited on CNTs boost electrocatalytic triiodide reduction. Among these POM/CNT CEs, the Co4PW9/CNT CE exhibits the best photovoltaic behavior with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.60%, which is superior to that of the Pt CE (6.59%). The excellent activity originates from the synergistic effect between the high redox activity of POMs and the excellent conductive ability of CNTs. This work provides a foundation for preparing advanced high-efficient CE catalysts of POM materials.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaics have shown great promise to be a high efficiency renewable energy technology to address the growing environmental problems and energy crisis.1 Among various photoelectric conversion technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their inherent advantages of cost effectiveness, easy production and high power conversion efficiency (PCE), since the first embodiment was fabricated by Grätzel in 1991.2,3 Recently, DSSCs have exhibited a high PCE of 14.3% under standard air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) conditions and reached commercial maturity.4,5 Typical DSSCs include a ruthenium-dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing I3−/I− redox mediator and a sprayed platinum (Pt) conductive glass counterelectrode (CE).6,7 Up to now, Pt is still perceived as the state-of-the-art catalyst for efficiently reducing I3− to I−. However, the low abundance (0.0037 ppm), exorbitant cost and limited supply severely hamper its large-scale practical applications.8 In addition, long-term working in I3−/I− electrolyte can result in a decreased performance due to the degradation and dissolution of Pt CE.9 Therefore, development of alternative cheap and abundant catalysts with excellent activity is highly pursued.10
In recent years, considerable effort has been made to search for various Earth-abundant carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, carbon black, nanocarbon and so on, to replace precious Pt for catalyzing the reduction of I3− in DSSCs.11,12 Among these available carbon materials, CNTs have received considerable enthusiasm and great interest of researchers because of its exceptional mechanical and electrical properties.13 Previous reports have proved that CNTs have moderate catalytic ability towards I3− reduction.14 To optimize the catalytic activity of CNTs, breaking up the CNT bundles, CNTs’ functionalization and hybridization with other active species are expected to maximize the specific surface area and actualize the complementary advantages, which is beneficial for enhancing the activity and stability of CNTs. Covalent and non-covalent CNT functionalizations are two main functionalization pathways. The former is conducive to get mechanically and chemically stable materials, but this approach can break the electrical neutrality of planar sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and disrupt the conjugated structure of CNTs, resulting in the reduced electrical performance. The latter mainly exploits the supramolecular interactions such as van der Waals interaction and π–π-interactions to dexterously link active species on the surface of CNTs. Although this approach does not affect the electronic properties, it is not good for obtaining mechanically and chemically robust materials.15 Compared with the covalent and non-covalent CNT functionalizations, the periodic functionalization of CNTs has recently become the hotter research topic. However, how to construct periodically functional CNTs to get well-ordered nanopattern functional structures for optoelectronic applications still remains a great challenge.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of anionic transition metal oxide molecular clusters of V, Mo, W, etc., with well-defined structures, compositions and unparalleled photoelectric properties.16,17 They can undergo multi-electron reduction with minimal structural modifications, rendering them excellent active materials in catalysis field.18,19 To date, tremendous attention has been paid to POMs as an electronic transport medium to modify photoanode materials and cosensitizers for more efficient DSSCs; however, the work about POMs as CE catalysts is still rare.20–22 To the best of our knowledge, POMs have a natural nanosize and the counterions of them can be easily adjusted without structure change. Therefore, POMs may be an ideal functional component to realize periodic nanofunctionalization of CNTs via the interaction between POM anions, counterions and CNTs. The deposition of POM molecules onto CNTs is expected to exhibit outstanding catalytic performance, where the redox active center POM nanoclusters provide a superior catalytic activity and the conducting CNTs provide skeleton support and conductive network.23 In a pioneering study, our group introduced two germanotungstate POMs (with a sandwich-type structure and decorated with a carboxyethyltin functional group) into a screen-printed single-walled nanotube (SWNT) CE by an electrodeposition technique. The obtained electrode exhibits an improved catalytic activity towards triiodide reduction than pristine SWNTs.24 However, it is well known that high specific surface area and active sites, and rapid electron transfer play a pivotal role in catalyzing I3− reduction to realize highly efficient DSSCs.25 The screen-printed SWNT CEs are obtained as bundles, leading to a decreased inner space and electron transport due to the strong π–π stacking of the SWNTs. Moreover, electrodeposition of POMs on the SWNT surface reduces the active sites and stability and limits the adsorption of adsorbents. Based on the above considerations, we have improved our previous work by periodic dispersion of POM nanocrystals on CNTs, which significantly enhanced the catalytic activity, stability and electrical addressability of redox centers.
In this work, we prepared five functionally and structurally robust POM/CNT (PMo12/CNTs, PW12/CNTs, P2Mo18/CNTs, P2W18/CNTs and Co4PW9/CNTs) nanocomposites by nanopatterning of POM nanocrystals on the surface of CNTs via a facile ultrasonic driving strategy. The as prepared POM/CNT hybrid materials display a uniform structure, in which POM nanoparticles are electrical “wiring” to CNTs. Conductive CNTs are in intimate contact with molecular catalytic active center POMs and transfer electrons to POM clusters, leading to the formation of POM/CNT hybrid materials. CNTs conduct charge to the redox POM species, facilitate highly efficient electron transfer throughout the composite and act as a barrier agent to protect POM molecules from chemical degradation. Consequently, the obtained composite catalysts exhibit high activity and excellent stability towards I3− reduction, especially sandwich POMs of Co4PW9. The Co4PW9/CNT CE delivers the highest PCE of 7.60%, which is higher than those of other POM/CNT and Pt CEs (6.59%). The outstanding catalytic activity is attributed to the matched energy level and the synergistic effect between the high catalytic activity of POM nanoclusters and excellent electron transfer properties of CNTs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of POM/CNT catalysts
The POM/CNT hybrid catalysts were fabricated by a simple two-step ultrasonic driving strategy as shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, purified CNT bundles are dispersed in methanol via ultrasonication to interrupt the CNT bundles’ packing forming uniform solution. Then, the adsorption of POMs on the CNT surface is achieved by adding POM acetonitrile solution to the CNT dispersion, which is performed under the second ultrasonication. It was noted that the POM tetra-n-butylammonium salts and sodium salt (Table S1†) were chosen as the precursors since the POM anions, tetra-n-butylammonium cations and CNT surface have natural intimately electrostatic interactions, which can be beneficial for the adsorption of the POMs onto the CNTs. For sandwich-type POM clusters with Na+ as countercations, electron transfer from CNTs to Co4PW9 clusters results in the spontaneous formation of periodic functionalization of POM/CNT redox-active hybrid materials.

Since the five POM/CNT nanocomposite catalysts display the similar morphology and structure, Co4PW9/CNTs was described here in detail as a representative sample since it exhibits the highest catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 2a, Co4PW9 chemisorption onto the CNT surface is confirmed by IR spectra since the nanocomposite shows the unique peaks of both the Co4PW9 molecule and CNTs. For example, the IR spectrum of Co4PW9 displays four characteristic peaks at the wavenumber of 700 cm−1 to 1100 cm−1, in which the peaks at 731 cm−1, 871 cm−1, 937 cm−1 and 1028 cm−1 are assigned to edge W–O–W bending, corner W–O–W bending, terminal W–O stretching and P–O stretching, respectively.26 The corresponding four vibration bands of Co4PW9 shift to 1058 cm−1, 948 cm−1, 866 cm−1 and 774 cm−1 in the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite, and the C–H stretching bands of pristine CNTs can be also observed in the corresponding POM/CNT nanocomposite, which suggests that POM particles have been loaded onto the surface of CNTs and retain the structure in the nanocomposites.27 The minor changes in the peak value is attributed to the conjugated interaction in the terminal oxygen of the POMs and CNTs, which results in the decrease in the electron density of the double bond between terminal oxygen atom and W (or Mo). Other POM/CNT nanocomposites display the similar characteristic, which can also be confirmed by IR spectra (Fig. S1†). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns shown in Fig. 2b provide an extremely powerful evidence for POM nanoparticles’ successful adsorption on CNTs. Pure CNTs exhibit two characteristic peaks located at 26.5° and 44.2°, which are indexed to the (002) planes of graphitically spaced CNTs and (100) planes of graphene character CNTs. The characteristic peaks of CNTs and abundant peaks of Co4PW9 both appear in the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite with a similar position, which provides a strong evidence of Co4PW9 particles’ successful grafting on CNTs.15 PXRD patterns of other POM precursors and POM/CNT nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S2.† The content of Co4PW9 in the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 2c). It can be seen that Co4PW9 shows a relatively large weight loss of 8.2 wt%, while CNTs exhibit a minor weight loss of 1.7 wt%. For the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite, a moderate loss of 5.6 wt% is observed, indicating that the estimated Co4PW9 content in the hybrid material is approximately 63.5 wt%. Besides, full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2d) and EDX results (Fig. S3†) of Co4PW9/CNTs also confirm that the nanocomposite is constitutive of Co, W, P, O and C elements.

Fig. 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f and Co 2p in Co4PW9 and Co4PW9/CNTs. W (VI) 4f and Co (II) 2p signals are centered at the binding energies of 35.18 eV, 37.32 eV and 782.42 eV, 800.43 eV, respectively, for the pure Co4PW9 clusters.28,29 For the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite, W (VI) 4f and Co (II) 2p signals are detected with binding energies of 35.80 eV, 37.92 eV and 783.7 eV, 800.3 eV. The obvious changes in binding energies demonstrate the interaction and electron transfer between POMs and CNTs, which suggests that POM nanoparticles are successfully deposited on CNTs and the structure of POMs is retained.15 CNTs can conduct charge to and from POM nanoparticles, allowing electrical access to redox active POM species, facilitating the efficient electron transfer to improve the performance of DSSCs. This result is consistent with the IR and TEM results. Other POM/CNT nanocomposites display similar results to Co4PW9/CNTs, and the corresponding XPS spectra and EDX results are shown in Fig. S4–S9.†

The structure and morphology of pure CNTs and Co4PW9/CNTs are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images of pure CNTs (Fig. 4a and b) clearly demonstrate that CNT bundles are interrupted and no POM nanoparticles are deposited on the CNT surface when CNT dispersion in methanol solution is performed under sonication. The SEM images of the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite (Fig. 4c and d) reveal that POM nanoparticles successfully deposited on the surface of CNTs and deposition of POMs does not transform the primary structure of CNTs. Moreover, POM nanoparticles are of nanometers in diameter and uniformly grafted on CNTs without aggregation. The TEM images in Fig. 5a and b also confirm that POM nanoparticles are in intimate contact with CNTs. The deposition of POM clusters onto the surface of CNTs led indeed to CEs which stood up to our best expectations, exhibiting outstanding PCE which is higher than that of pristine CNTs. This result is attributed to the fact that the redox active POM clusters maintain their electrochemical activities while benefiting from the conducting properties of the hybrid material. Elemental mapping (Fig. 5c) of Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposites confirms the mixed distribution of C, Co, P and W elements, further demonstrating the deposition of POMs on CNTs. The cross-sectional view of the SEM image shows that the film thickness of the prepared Co4PW9/CNT CE is 57.9 μm (Fig. S10†). The SEM and TEM images of other POM/CNT nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S11 and S12,† which all display a similar structure and morphology to Co4PW9/CNT hybrid materials.

2.2 Electrochemical measurements of POM/CNT catalysts
The Tafel polarization tests were firstly utilized to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of POM/CNT hybrid materials and Pt CEs. The cathodic trace in the Tafel curves can reflect the reduction ability of CE materials to I3−, in which limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) and the exchange current density (J0), two important parameters for assessing the catalytic ability, can be achieved. A larger J0 and Jlim indicate a higher catalytic performance towards the reduction of I3− and a faster diffusion rate of I3− in redox electrolyte, which is propitious for realizing a higher photovoltaic behavior.30–32Fig. 6a shows the Tafel curves of various POM/CNT nanocomposite CEs, which depict the relationship between potential (V) and logarithmic current density (logJ). As shown in Fig. 6a, the Co4PW9/CNT nanocomposite shows the highest J0 and Jlim on the electrode surface with logJ0 = −1.46 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.35 Log A cm−2, demonstrating that it has the best catalytic ability towards the reduction of I3− and the fastest diffusion rate of I3− in the electrolyte, which are superior to those of Pt CE (logJ0 = −1.65 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.46 Log A cm−2). The J0 and Jlim values of all POM/CNT nanocomposite CEs (PW12/CNTs: logJ0 = −1.59 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.50 Log A cm−2, PMo12/CNTs: logJ0 = −1.56 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.48 Log A cm−2, P2W18/CNTs: logJ0 = −1.96 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.63 Log A cm−2, PMo12/CNTs: logJ0 = −1.80 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −2.74 Log A cm−2) overmatch those of pure CNTs (logJ0 = 2.20 Log A cm−2 and logJlim = −3.12 Log A cm−2), suggest that deposition of POM nanoparticles on CNT surface can greatly improve the catalytic behavior. In addition, introduction of transition metals into the POM skeleton may have a potential effect on the catalytic activity of POMs.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are further used to investigate the catalytic characteristic for I3− reduction of various CEs including CNTs, PW12/CNTs, PMo12/CNTs, P2W18/CNTs, P2Mo18/CNTs, Co4PW9/CNTs and Pt, which have been exhibited in Fig. 6b. As shown in Fig. 6b, two pairs of redox peaks appear in all CV curves, which are ascribed to the oxidation–reduction reaction of I−/I3− (on the left) and I2/I3− (on the right). The cathode peak current density (JRed) based on I−/I3− and the peak spacing (Epp) between the anodic and cathodic peaks are key diathesis for appraising the electrocatalytic activity of a CE in CV test.33 CV curves shown in Fig. 6b reveal that CNTs have the smallest JRed (−1.47 mA cm−2) and largest Epp (740 mV), and the JRed increases when PW12 (−3.50 mA cm−2), PMo12 (−6.18 mA cm−2), P2W18 (−2.81 mA cm−2) and P2Mo18 (−3.20 mA cm−2) nanoparticles deposit on CNTs. More importantly, the Co4PW9/CNT CE possesses the highest JRed (−8.43 mA cm−2) and smallest Epp (230 mV), demonstrating the incomparable catalytic activity.34
The electrons’ lifetime (τ) at the electrolyte/CE interface, representing the time it takes for I3− to be reduced, can be obtained through the following eqn (1).35 The τ values of CNTs, PW12/CNTs, PMo12/CNTs, P2W18/CNTs, P2Mo18/CNTs, Co4PW9/CNTs and Pt CEs are calculated to be 7977.66 μs, 31.42 μs, 26.82 μs, 120.56 μs, 44.31 μs, 21.76 μs and 71.27 μs, respectively. (1)where fmax represents the maximum frequency in the Bode phase plots (Fig. 6c). Obviously, the τ values of POM/CNT nanocomposites are much lower than those of CNT CE, indicating that the electrons from external circuit can quickly participate in the reduction reaction of I3− when POM nanoparticles are deposited on CNTs. The Co4PW9/CNT CE shows the smallest τ value in all POM/CNT CEs, confirming the most outstanding catalytic performance.36 This result is consistent with Tafel and CV measurements.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were carried out to further evaluate the electron transfer kinetic characteristics of different CEs. Fig. 6d shows the typical Nyquist plots of different symmetrical CE cells. The EIS Nyquist plots of POM/CNT are fitted to an equivalent circuit (Fig. S13†). The intersection of Nyquist plots and transverse axis at the high frequency represents the series resistance (Rs). The first semicircle in the high frequency refers to the charge transfer impedance at the electrolyte/electrode interface (Rct), and the other semicircle on the right is defined as the diffusion impedance (ZN) of I3−/I− redox couple.37,38 These electrochemical parameters can be obtained from the fitting circuit and are listed in Table S2.† As shown in Fig. 6d and Table S2,† the CNT CE exhibits the largest Rs (19.04 Ω cm−2) and Rct (24.04 Ω cm−2), which is apparently higher than those of the Pt CE with Rs of 10.54 Ω cm−2 and Rct of 13.50 Ω cm−2. The Rs of POM/CNT (PW12: 11.03 Ω cm−2, PMo12: 11.05 Ω cm−2, P2W18: 11.56 Ω cm−2, P2Mo18: 10.48 Ω cm−2, Co4PW9: 11.75 Ω cm−2) nanocomposite CEs are similar to that of the Pt CE (10.54 Ω cm−2), but the Rct values are obviously different. The Rct has been reduced from 24.04 Ω cm−2 for CNTs to 10.90 Ω cm−2 (PW12/CNTs), 15.50 Ω cm−2 (PMo12/CNTs), 6.97 Ω cm−2 (P2W18/CNTs), 10.85 Ω cm−2 (P2Mo18/CNTs) and 1.2 Ω cm−2 (Co4PW9/CNTs), which are close to that of the Pt CE, suggesting POM/CNT nanocomposites have an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide reduction.
2.3 Characterization of photovoltaic performances of POM/CNT catalysts
The photovoltaic performances of POMs/CNTs as CEs were firstly evaluated under AM 1.5 G solar light at room temperature using an I−/I3− couple redox mediator and N719 sensitizer. The J–V curves based on various POM/CNT nanocomposites and Pt CEs are presented in Fig. 7a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The result indicates that pure CNTs exhibit the lowest PCE of 5.74% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.47 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.653 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.608. When different POM nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of CNTs, the PCEs of DSSCs are significantly improved. The optimal PCEs of the DSSCs with PW12/CNTs, PMo12/CNTs, P2W18/CNTs and P2Mo18/CNTs CEs are 6.57%, 6.93%, 6.37% and 6.49%, respectively, which is comparable to that of Pt CE (Jsc = 16.69 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.749 V, FF = 0.527, PCE = 6.59%). Impressively, when Co4PW9 nanoclusters anchored on the CNTs, the PCE has been elevated from 5.74% (pure CNTs) to 7.60% (Co4PW9/CNTs), with a Jsc of 15.98 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.757 V and FF of 0.628, which is superior to PCE of DSSC with Pt as the CE. The excellent photovoltaic performance is attributed to the good synergistic effect between the superior catalytic ability of sandwich-type Co4PW9 POMs and the high electrical addressability of CNTs. Under solar light illumination, N719 dye molecules absorb the photons to produce photogenerated electrons and transfer electrons to the external circuit quickly through the conductive band (CB) of TiO2. The Co4PW9/CNTs CE collects the electrons from the external circuit and injects into the redox electrolyte to catalyze the reduction of I3−, in which CNTs play a prominent role in conducting charge and allowing electrical access to redox species of Co4PW9. Moreover, CNTs act as a physical barrier to protect Co4PW9 molecules from corrosion and promote the efficient electron transfer in the whole catalyst. Co4PW9 POMs accept the electrons from CNTs and then inject into the electrolyte to catalyze the reduction of I3− by exploiting its redox reversibility. The electron injection efficiency at the Co4PW9/electrolyte is an important factor affecting the DSSC performance. The energy-level difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the CB of Co4PW9/CNT CE can be employed to estimate the electron injection dynamics. A larger energy level difference provides a greater electron injection driving force. As shown in Fig. 7b, the CB of Co4PW9 is −4.53 eV, which is higher than the redox potential of the electrolyte, and the energy-level difference between the CB level of Co4PW9 and redox potential of the electrolyte (−4.90 eV) is 0.36 eV, which provides a high driving force of electron injection to get excellent photovoltaic results.23,39,40

2.4 The long-term stability of catalysts
To further analyze the long-term stability of DSSCs based on POM/CNT catalysts, the stability of Co4PW9/CNT-based DSSCs was measured for several days discontinuously. Fig. S14† shows the photovoltaic performance of a Co4PW9/CNT CE based solar cell at different testing times. The fresh DSSC delivers the PCE of 7.60%. After 17 days, the PCE become stable at around 7.60%. With the testing time further going on, no obvious decrease in the PCE was observed over a period of more than 34 days. This result clearly indicates the excellent stability of the DSSC based on Co4PW9/CNT CE.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized five highly dispersed POM/CNT nanocomposites by a simple ultrasonic driving strategy, which were used as highly efficient CE catalysts for catalyzing the reduction of I3−. The synthesized POM/CNT nanomaterials were characterized by IR, XRD, TGA, XPS, SEM, TEM and elemental analysis. The electrochemical characteristics were researched with the Tafel polarization, CV, Bode phase plot and EIS measurements. These POM/CNT nanopatterned hybrid materials exhibit an excellent catalytic ability towards triiodide reduction and equivalent photovoltaic performance to the Pt CE. In particular, the DSSC based on the Co4PW9/CNT CE shows a better PCE (7.6%) than the Pt CE due to the synergistic effect of redox active POMs and the excellent electrical conductivity of CNTs. This work provides a simple strategy for designing low cost and high efficiency POM based catalysts.
4. Experimental
4.1 Reagents
All POMs, including PW12, PMo12, P2W18, P2Mo18 and Co4PW9, were prepared according to the methods reported in the literature.41–43 MWCNTs were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Other reagents (A.R.) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and used without further purification. Milli-Q water was used for all experiments.
4.2 Preparation of POM/CNT nanocomposites
The detailed preparation method of POM/CNT nanocomposites is as follows: 20 mg of purified CNTs were ultrasonic dispersed in 20 mL of absolute methanol to interrupt the CNT bundles’ packing, obtaining a uniform suspension. Then, 2 mL acetonitrile solution containing 40 mg of the respective POM was added to the CNT dispersion, and the dispersion was sonicated at the corresponding frequency for 5 h at room temperature. The obtained POM/CNT nanocomposites were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with methanol. Finally, the composites were freeze dried for 24 hours.
4.3 Preparation of POM/CNT nanocomposite CEs
The POM/CNT nanocomposite CEs were prepared via a simple drop-coating method. In brief, 60 mg of the obtained POM/CNT powder was dispersed in 3 mL isopropanol to get a uniform suspension by ultrasound. The resulting turbid liquid was added dropwise onto the surface of cleaned FTO conductive glass. The total mass of catalysts was controlled to 8 mg, and the active area of the CE was 0.26 cm2.
4.4 Preparation of TiO2 photoanodes
The TiO2 photoanode was prepared by a screen-printing technique, and the TiO2 colloid was synthesized by a similar method documented in the literature.44 Briefly, TiO2 powder and a small amount of glacial acetic acid, deionized water, ethanol, terpineol, and ethyl cellulose were ground in a mortar for an hour and then heated until the mixture was condensed into viscous form. The screen-printing method was adopted to coat the TiO2 paste to the surface of FTO conductive glasses. This screen-printing procedure was repeated four times to control the thickness of the photoanode. The as prepared uniform TiO2 film was heated at 450 °C for 30 min and then post-treated in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution, and the treated anodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min once again. Finally, the TiO2 photoanode was immersed in a 0.25 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye for 24 h under environmental conditions. The effective area of the obtained photoanode was controlled to 0.1 cm2.
4.5 Assembly of DSSCs
The DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching I3−/I− redox electrolyte between a POM/SWNT CE and a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode. An electrolyte solution consisting of 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.1 mol L−1 LiI, 0.5 mol L−1 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.6 mol L−1 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in 3-methoxypropionitrile was injected into the interspace between electrodes from a pinhole.
4.6 Photovoltaic and electrochemical measurements
For evaluating the photovoltaic performance of various DSSCs, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were conducted with a CHI601D (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., P. R. China) electrochemical workstation system under simulated solar light from a 500 W xenon lamp in ambient atmosphere (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination intensity). The effective solar cell area under the light irradiation was 0.1 cm2. CV measurements based on the three-electrode system were recorded in a supporting electrolyte consisting of 10 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile by utilizing a computer-controlled CHI660D workstation, in which the working electrode, reference electrode and counterelectrode were the FTO glass supported POM/CNT nanocomposites, Ag/Ag+ electrode and Pt wire, respectively. The CV tests were carried out under the scan rates of 50 mV s−1 from −1.0 V to 1.5 V at a constant temperature of 20 °C. Tafel polarization curves and EIS measurements were recorded on a Model CS350 (CH Instruments, Wuhan CorrTest Instrument Corporation, P. R. China) electrochemistry station by assembling a symmetric dummy cell consisting of POMs/CNTs–redox electrolyte–POMs/CNTs electrode architecture. Tafel polarization tests for different CEs were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with the voltage ranging from −0.8 V to 0.8 V. The EIS measurements were tested with the frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 1 MHz at ambient pressure and temperature. Z-view software was used to fit the resultant impedance data.
4.7 Other characterization studies
The transform infrared spectra (IR) were obtained on an Alpha Centaurt FT/IR spectrophotometer with KBr pellets in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 at room temperature. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 A) in the 2θ range of 3–90° with a step size of 0.02° to determine the phase identification and crystallinity of the nanocomposites. The TG-DTA analysis was conducted on a PerkinElmer TGA7 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 20 °C to 800 °C to determine the content of active species and thermal stability of the materials. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an Al Kα radiation. The nanostructures and morphologies of the prepared nanocomposites were characterized using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) under 25 kV accelerating voltage. The chemical compositions of samples were verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with a FEI Quanta 200F microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2100F) was employed to analyze the nanostructure and morphology of SWNTs and POM/SWNT nanocomposites.
