    , Accepted 11th April 2017First published on 12th April 2017AbstractA 1,8-naphthalimide derivative (H-NIM) containing an alkyl carboxylic chain has been rationally designed and synthesized for efficient utilization of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The H-NIM fluorophore, which can absorb ultraviolet light and emit green light under illumination, is doped into a TiO2 mesoporous film with N719 molecules by a co-adsorption method. The H-NIM fluorophore adsorbs on the TiO2 by the same method as N719, via its carboxylic groups, ensuring more efficient energy transfer from H-NIM (FRET donor) to N719 (FRET acceptor) via in situ FRET and thereby promoting light harvesting of N719 molecules in the spectral range of ultraviolet light. The co-adsorption of H-NIM and N719 also reduces charge recombination by shielding the contact area between TiO2 and the electrolyte. Our results show that the optimal doping ratio of the H-NIM fluorophore is 17%, at which the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSC is improved by 10.8% and 21% under one sun (AM1.5G) and 600 lux illumination by T5 fluorescent lamps, respectively, compared with a DSSC in which only N719 molecules were adsorbed.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention in the alternative energy field over the past twenty years1–4 because they are among the most promising photovoltaic devices. DSSCs are readily manufactured in quantity by a screen-printing process; also, they are feasible for flexible applications and are cost-efficient. In recent years, the commercial production of DSSCs has focused on indoor and dim-light applications,3 such as TDP (Taiwan DSC PV Ltd.) and GCell (United Kingdom). However, improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs remains a key factor for their development and commercialization. In general, a DSSC contains three major components: a photoanode, an electrolyte system (redox mediator) and a counter electrode. The photoanode is composed of a mesoporous n-type metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) semiconductor film which is coated on a transparent conducting film or metal substrate and adsorbs sensitizing dye. The electrolyte system contains iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) or cobalt(II/III) complex2,5 redox couples in a suitable mediator to reduce the oxidization of the sensitizing dye. The counter electrode, including the catalyst, catalyzes the redox couples for the reduction reaction. Some novel catalysts,6–10 such as Na-embedded carbon,7 3D graphene,8 1T metallic phase MoS2,9 and conductive polymers (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT),10 have been proposed to replace expensive Pt in the counter electrode.
Light harvesting of the sensitizing dye plays a key role in the PCE of DSSC. This is an important task for synthesizing a new sensitizing dye or utilizing co-sensitization to enhance the absorption intensity of light and to broaden the spectrum response range to the near-infrared (NIR) region.11 However, it is challenging to synthesize a sensitizing dye that possesses both a high molar extinction coefficient and a broad absorption spectrum.12 Co-sensitization by mixing two or more sensitizing dyes with different absorption spectrum ranges is a strategy that can be applied to broaden the spectrum response range.12,13 However, the anchoring process of the co-sensitization mixture onto the TiO2 surface is highly competitive and may hinder the effective adsorption of the different sensitizing dyes.
In addition to co-sensitization, there are other methods to enhance the light harvesting of DSSCs by phosphorescence or luminescent chromophores, such as introducing rare-earth-doped oxides14–18 into the DSSC, coating a luminescent layer on the glass of the photoanode,18–21 and adding energy relay dyes (ERDs) to the electrolyte.12,22–29 The doping of rare-earth-doped oxide nanopowders into the mesoporous metal oxide semiconductor film broadens the light absorption range of the DSSC and thereby improves its light harvesting and photocurrent density via down-conversion luminescence14 from ultraviolet light to visible light (Y2O3:Eu3+) or via up-conversion luminescence15–17 from NIR to visible light (Y2O3:Er3+, NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+, and YF3:Er3+/Yb3+). Although the introduction of rare-earth-doped oxides improves the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, the cost of the DSSCs inevitably increases due to the high cost of the rare-earth materials.
The use of ERDs is a novel and fairly effective strategy to strengthen and extend light harvesting. Some highly luminescent fluorophores have been added to liquid electrolytes or organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs).22 After injecting the ERD-containing electrolyte or HTM into a DSSC, the ERD molecules diffuse into the dye-coated semiconductor oxide film. The ERD molecules absorb light that is not in the primary absorption spectrum range of the sensitizing dye; they then transfer energy non-radiatively to the sensitizing dyes by the fluorescence (Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect.30,31 The use of ERDs has some advantages over the co-sensitization method;26,32 however, the ERDs must be designed to be soluble in the electrolyte and cannot be quenched by the electrolyte.12 In addition, the doping amount of the ERDs is usually high to ensure that sufficient ERD molecules (FRET donor) can diffuse into the mesoporous TiO2 film and achieve maximal proximity to the sensitizing dye molecules (FRET acceptor) to induce the FRET effect. An alternative method is to covalently link the FRET donor to the sensitizing dye molecules attached on the TiO2 surface to shorten the FRET distance.26,32,33 Siegers and colleagues33 demonstrated an improvement in the external quantum efficiency of 5% to 10% in the spectrum range from 400 nm to 500 nm. However, the PCE was not high (<2.5%) under one sun illumination, and the synthesis of the dyadic sensitizer was complex.
A 1,8-naphthalimide derivative fluorophore, which was originally applied as a pH sensor in the biomedical field34,35 or as a laser dye,36 was directly doped into a TiO2 mesoporous film with N719 for application in DSSCs. An improvement of the PCE from 7.63% to 8.13% under one sun (AM1.5G) illumination was obtained, in which the 1,8-naphthalimide derivative (N-Bu) functioned as the FRET donor and transferred the energy via spectral down-conversion to the N719 molecules (FRET acceptor).37,38 Unlike the N719 molecules, which can adsorb on the TiO2 surface via their carboxylic groups, the N-Bu molecules lack strong adhesion to TiO2 and can only float around the N719 molecules, as shown in Fig. 1(a). This inevitably lowers the effectiveness of N-Bu as a FRET donor. As a result, the improvement of the PCE was limited to 6.6% (from 7.63% to 8.13%).

(a) The N-Bu molecules are unable to adsorb onto the TiO2 nanoparticles due to lack of carboxylic groups. (b) A schematic of DSSC configuration with the TiO2 nanoparticle film coated with N719 and H-NIM molecules. (c) The H-NIM molecules adhere onto the TiO2 nanoparticles with their carboxylic groups as N719 does. The H-NIM molecules absorb ultraviolet light with a spectrum range of 350 to 450 nm and simultaneously transfer the absorbed energy to neighboring N719 dye molecules via the FRET effect; this remarkably enhances the light harvesting of the N719 dye molecules. 
In this study, a new 1,8-naphthalimide derivative fluorophore with an alkyl carboxylic acid chain, herein named H-NIM, was synthesized. The emission spectrum of the H-NIM fluorophore (FRET donor) greatly overlaps the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye molecules (FRET acceptor). Additionally, the H-NIM fluorophores can adsorb on the TiO2 surface by their carboxylic groups in the same manner as N719, as shown in Fig. 1(c), via a co-adsorption process. The co-adsorption of H-NIM and N719 on the TiO2 surface ensures that the FRET donor can achieve maximal proximity to the FRET acceptor, thus constructing a more efficient in situ FRET system. Upon illumination, the H-NIM fluorophore absorbs ultraviolet light and transfers energy non-radiatively to the N719 molecules to promote the light harvesting of N719. A wide range of doping concentrations of H-NIM, from 9% to 50%, was tested; the optimal doping ratio is 17%, at which the PCE of the DSSCs improved by 10.8% under one sun (AM1.5G) illumination. A more significant improvement of 21% was achieved under dim-light illumination with T5 fluorescent lamps at 600 lux, revealing that the H-NIM fluorophore also has high potential for indoor applications.
Results and discussion
The wavelength ranges of absorption and emission of the H-NIM fluorophore are located between 350 and 450 nm and 465 and 580 nm, respectively, in a solvent mixture of DMSO/ethanol (volume ratio = 1/9), as shown in Fig. 2. The absorption and emission spectra of H-NIM are similar to those of the previously reported N-Bu fluorophore,37,38 indicating that the carboxyl group has a negligible effect on the spectrum response. The spectrum diagram indicates that the green emission energy distributed range of H-NIM (FRET donor) greatly overlaps the absorption energy distribution of N719 (FRET acceptor). This close spectral overlap between the donor and acceptor contributes greatly to the FRET effect. Fig. 3 shows images acquired using an inverted Epi-fluorescence microscope. To elucidate the doping conditions of the H-NIM fluorophores in the TiO2 mesoporous film, the microscope was focused at the interface between the TiO2 mesoporous film and the FTO glass substrate, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Only the H-NIM fluorophore, without N719 molecules, was doped into the TiO2 mesoporous film because the FRET effect impedes the detection of green fluorescence from the H-NIM fluorophore. Fig. 3(b) shows a bright-field image of the bottom of the TiO2 film screen-printed on the FTO glass. The film bottom exhibits a granular morphology, with some very small cracks resulting from high-temperature sintering. Green fluorescence response is observed when the H-NIM-coated TiO2 film is excited by ultraviolet light of 370 to 410 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), indicating that the H-NIM fluorophore can diffuse to the bottom of the TiO2 film. The strong spectral response implies a high fluorescence quantum yield of the donor, which is also an important factor for the FRET effect. The fluorescence response is quite uniform, indicating that the distribution of the H-NIM fluorophore is uniform inside the TiO2 mesoporous film. Furthermore, the H-NIM fluorophore anchors on the active sites of the TiO2 surface via its carboxyl groups, as N719 does; this prevents the H-NIM fluorophores from diffusing out of the TiO2 film when the TiO2 film is filled with the liquid electrolyte during the electrolyte injection. This can assure a high concentration of the FRET donor (H-NIM) on the TiO2 surface to contribute to the FRET effect.

The concentrations of N719 and H-NIM are 5 × 10−5 M and 2 × 10−5 M, respectively, in DMSO/ethanol (volume ratio = 1/9). The fluorescence spectrum of the H-NIM fluorophore corresponds well to the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye molecules, which meets the requirement of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect.

Fig. 4 shows the IPCE spectra of DSSCs with TiO2 photoanodes soaked in various mixing solutions of N719 and H-NIM. The doping concentration ratios of H-NIM in the mixing solutions range from 0% to 50%, in which 0% doping indicates that the solution contains N719 but no H-NIM. The concentration of N719 was fixed at 0.4 mM for all the mixing solutions. The IPCE spectra show that the doping of the H-NIM fluorophore enhances the IPCE mainly in the spectral range of 350 to 450 nm (ultraviolet) for all doping ratios due to the FRET effect. The H-NIM fluorophores can be excited by absorbing ultraviolet light; they then transfer the absorbed energy to the neighboring N719 molecules through the FRET effect. Moreover, the emission peak of H-NIM greatly overlaps the λ1 metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition absorption band of N719 around 550 nm.39,40 For these reasons, the light harvesting of DSSCs is enhanced in the spectral range of ultraviolet light; therefore, the IPCE is enhanced. An evident reduction of IPCE in the spectral range of 450 to 650 nm (visible) was observed for the doping ratio of 50% H-NIM. This implies that overdoped H-NIM fluorophores may accumulate around the N719 molecules and result in a blocking effect which hinders the charge transfer from the electrolyte to the N719-coated TiO2 nanoparticles. Overall, the doping ratios of 13% to 25% show better IPCE performance in comparison with pure N719 (0% doping).

The doping concentration ratios of H-NIM in the mixing solutions range from 0% to 50%, with a fixed concentration of N719 of 0.4 mM for all mixing solutions. 
In order to verify that the N719 and H-NIM molecules were co-adsorbed on the TiO2 nanoparticles, the photoanodes were soaked in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaOH for 3.5 h to desorb the two molecules. Fig. 5 shows the emission spectra of all the desorbed solutions in the spectral range of 450 to 650 nm. A shift of the emission peaks is observed from 500 to 510 nm (Fig. 2) to 540 to 550 nm (Fig. 5), which is a result of the solvent effect. In Fig. 5, the desorbed solution of pure N719 (0% doping) has no fluorescence response, as expected. In contrast, the desorbed solutions with 9% to 50% doping of the H-NIM fluorophore show pronounced fluorescence responses; also, the intensity increases with increasing doping ratio of H-NIM. This also confirms the existence of the fluorophore in the desorbed solutions.
 Fig. 5  Emission spectra of solutions containing N719 and H-NIM molecules desorbed from the TiO2 mesoporous films. The desorption process was performed by soaking the dye-loaded TiO2 photoanodes in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 3.5 h. The desorbed solutions were excited by an excitation light of 380 nm wavelength. 
The absorption spectra of the desorbed solutions (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) can be used to measure the loading amounts of N719 dye molecules and H-NIM fluorophores using the Beer–Lambert law. As shown in Table 1, the loading amounts of N719 dye for various doping ratios of H-NIM were similar, indicating that the doping of H-NIM does not affect the adsorption of N719 dye molecules on the TiO2 surface during the co-adsorption process. Therefore, we believe that the N719 dye molecules adsorb first on the TiO2 surface with their two alkyl carboxylic groups. Subsequently, the smaller H-NIM fluorophores diffuse interstitially through the spaces between neighboring N719 molecules to reach the TiO2 surface and adhere to the unoccupied sites via their single alkyl carboxylic groups, as shown in Fig. 1(c). In many co-adsorption strategies, the anchoring process is highly competitive; therefore, doping with another adsorbent inevitably affects the adsorption of the main dye sensitizer, i.e. N719. In our study, the doping of H-NIM is less competitive; therefore, the adsorption of N719 is not affected. In addition, the loading amount of H-NIM increases with increasing doping concentration of H-NIM and exceeds that of N719 when the doping concentration is 50%. This confirms that the 50% ratio is indeed overdoped and influences the IPCE performance as well as the efficiency. It was also found that the doping of H-NIM increases the IPCE in the ultraviolet spectrum range due to the FRET effect; the incremental amount is roughly proportional to the doping concentration of H-NIM (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). However, overdoping of 50% decreases the IPCE in the green light spectrum range; this is attributed to the blocking effect mentioned above.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs under one sun and dim-light (T5 fluorescent lamps, 600 lux) illumination, respectively. Based on the J–V data, the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs under one sun and dim-light illumination can be deduced; these are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For one sun illumination (Table 1), the PCE (η) of the DSSC that was not doped with H-NIM, that is, a doping concentration ratio of 0%, is 9.16%. The PCE of the DSSCs doped with the H-NIM fluorophore improved; the best PCE of 10.15% was achieved for the doping ratio of 17%. Similar results were obtained under dim-light illumination, as shown in Table 2. The PCE of the DSSC not doped with H-NIM was 16.46%. After doping the H-NIM fluorophores together with the N719 molecules in the TiO2 photoanode, the PCE of the DSSCs improved; the best PCE of 19.92% was also obtained when the doping ratio was 17%. The power (Pmax) is also an important index for indoor (dim light) DSSC applications. It was found that the doping ratio of 17% resulted in the highest power of 6.15 μW, which is an increase of 20% compared to that of the DSSC with 0% doping (5.08 μW). The improvement of the PCE under the two illumination conditions can be mainly attributed to the improvements of the photocurrent density (JSC) from 16.89 to 18.98 mA cm−2 and from 75.74 to 89.2 μA cm−2 for one sun and dim-light illumination, respectively. This further confirms the contribution of the FRET effect to the performance of the DSSCs.

The increase rates of the photocurrent density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), calculated from the data in (a) and (b), are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. The dotted trend lines show that the increase rates of JSC and PCE are enhanced with increasing doping concentration of H-NIM from 0% to 17%; the enhancement is more pronounced for the T5 fluorescent lamps at 600 lux illumination.

Fig. 6(c) and (d) show the increase rates of JSC and PCE, respectively, for the doping ratios less than 17% (the optimal doping ratio). The increase rates of JSC and PCE were calculated from the data shown in Tables 1 and 2. The dotted trend lines show that the increase rates of JSC and PCE are proportional to the increase of the doping concentration of H-NIM from 0% to 17%, indicating that the doping concentration of H-NIM has a positive effect on the FRET effect. Moreover, the slope of the dotted trend line for the 600 lux illumination is larger than that for the one sun illumination, showing that the FRET effect is more pronounced under dim-light illumination. Under one sun illumination, the light intensity is so strong (>100000 lux) that the energy transfer intensity from the H-NIM donor to the N719 acceptor is relatively low. However, the light intensity is much lower (600 lux) under dim light illumination; therefore, the contribution of the FRET effect resulting from the H-NIM donor becomes more significant.
To understand the electron transfer characteristics inside the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed with various bias potentials under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 7(a), Rrec was recorded with changing bias potential from −0.4 V to −0.58 V, in which Rrec is the charge transfer resistance related to the recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The values of Rrec were obtained by fitting the experimental data of EIS using the transmission line model of Bisquert#2.41–45 Obviously, Rrec was larger for the DSSCs doped with the H-NIM fluorophore compared with that not doped with the H-NIM fluorophore, revealing that doping with H-NIM can suppress the charge recombination from TiO2 back to the electrolyte. The electron lifetime (τn)41 was also measured using τn = Rrec × Cμ, where Cμ is the chemical capacitance of the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The values of Cμ (Fig. S5(a) in the ESI†) are almost the same for various doping ratios of H-NIM with different bias potentials. This is because the same electrolyte was used for all the DSSCs. This also implies that the co-existence of the H-NIM fluorophore with N719 molecules does not alter the charge transfer from the electrolyte to TiO2. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the trend of τn is the same as that of Rrec, and τn is longer for the DSSCs doped with the H-NIM fluorophore. The improvement in τn can be attributed to the suppression effect of the H-NIM fluorophore on the charge recombination. As previously mentioned, the N719 molecules adsorb first onto the TiO2 surface during the co-adsorption process, followed by adsorption of the H-NIM fluorophore. This co-adsorption of H-NIM with N719 molecules may form a protective layer on the TiO2 surface, as observed with other co-adsorbents, and thereby protect the TiO2 surface from direct contact with liquid electrolyte.46 This can effectively suppress charge recombination from TiO2 back to the electrolyte; therefore, the recombination resistance (Rrec) and electron lifetime (τn) are improved when the DSSCs co-adsorb H-NIM and N719 molecules simultaneously.

Fig. 8 shows mapping images of the photocurrent density distributions of 4 × 4 mm2 regions of the TiO2 photoanodes of the DSSCs under one sun illumination. In the color scale, the high and low photocurrent densities are represented by red and blue, respectively. On average, the photocurrent density of the DSSC with the doping ratio of 17% is the highest, with more red spots, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The DSSC with the doping ratio of 50% shows the lowest photocurrent density, with more green spots, as shown in Fig. 8(c). In contrast, the DSSC not doped with the H-NIM fluorophore shows a photocurrent density between that of the above two DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 8(a). This photocurrent density order on the basis of the mapping results is in good agreement with the JSC data shown in Table 1.

The mapping results show that the doping of 17% H-NIM results in the highest photocurrent density distribution, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance shown in Table 1. 
The FRET effect is associated with an electrodynamic interaction between a donor in the excited state and an acceptor in the ground state. The FRET efficiency depends upon several conditions,31 in which the extent of spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor plays a crucial role. The doping of the H-NIM fluorophore (donor) is beneficial to induce the FRET effect because its emission spectrum greatly overlaps the absorption spectrum of N719 (acceptor), as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the H-NIM fluorophore can adsorb on the TiO2 surface in the same manner as the N719 molecules due to its carboxylic groups, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Therefore, the H-NIM fluorophores can achieve maximal proximity to the N719 molecules and transfer the adsorbed energy more efficiently to the N719 molecules through the in situ FRET effect. This is the key feature of the molecular design of the H-NIM fluorophore (FRET donor) in this study. We also found that the concentration of the H-NIM fluorophore was relatively low (<10−4 mM) compared with previous studies,12,22–29 which used high concentrations of ERDs (5 to 180 mM) as FRET donors (Table S3 in the ESI†). This is because the ERDs are initially added to the electrolytes, and a high concentration level is necessary to ensure that sufficient ERDs can diffuse into the TiO2 mesoporous film and approach the sensitizing dye molecules.
Conclusions
A 1,8-naphthalimide derivative with an alkyl carboxylic chain, H-NIM, has been introduced into DSSCs to enhance their IPCEs and successfully improve their power conversion efficiencies. After a one-step soaking procedure, the H-NIM fluorophore is doped into the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode along with N719 dye molecules via their carboxylic acid groups to achieve in situ FRET. That is, the H-NIM fluorophore is excited by absorbing ultraviolet light and then transfers energy to the neighboring N719 molecules. Consequently, at a suitable H-NIM doping ratio, we found that the in situ FRET effect can not only improve the light harvesting of the N719 molecules but can also enhance the IPCE in the spectrum range of ultraviolet light to improve the photocurrent. As a result, an improved power conversion efficiency (10.15%) of the DSSC is achieved in comparison with a DSSC not doped with H-NIM molecules (9.16%) under one sun (AM1.5G) illumination. Furthermore, under T5 fluorescent lamps at 600 lux illumination, the power conversion efficiency improved more significantly, with an increase from 16.46% to 19.92%.
Experimental section
Synthesis and characterization of the organic fluorophore H-NIM
H-NIM was synthesized by referring to a procedure in a previous study,35,37 as shown in the ESI (Scheme S1†). In the first stage of the reaction, the commercial starting material 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (compound 1) was reacted with 6-aminohexanoic acid; the system was refluxed in ethanol to afford 6-(6-bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)hexanoic acid (compound 2). Next, compound 2 samples were subjected to reflux with 1-methylpiperazine in ethanol to afford 6-(6-(1-methyl-4-piperazinyl)-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)hexanoic acid (NIM).

6-(6-Bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)hexanoic acid (compound 2). 
Commercially available compound 1, 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (10 mmol), and 6-aminohexanoic acid (15 mmol) were stirred in ethanol solution (20 mL) under reflux for 2 h (monitored by TLC). After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated in vacuum, and the residue was subjected to chromatography on silica gel using acetone/hexane (1/2, Rf = 0.4). The system was filtered to remove the excess amine, and the collected precipitate was crystallized from acetone/ethanol to afford a white solid (yield: 76%). Data for 2: 1H NMR (400 Hz, DMSO-d6, δ): δ (ppm) = 8.564 (d, J = 7.6, 1H), 8.542 (d, J = 8.0, 1H), 8.327 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 8.210 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.992 (dd, J = 7.6, 8.0 Hz, 1H), 4.002 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 2.192 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.671 (m, 2H), 1.527 (m, 2H), and 1.337 (m, 2H).


6-(6-(1-Methyl-4-piperazinyl)-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)hexanoic acid (NIM). 
Compound 2 (10 mmol) and 1-methylpiperazine (12 mmol) were refluxed in ethanol solution (20 mL) for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated in vacuum, and the residue was recrystallized directly from acetone/MeOH (yield: 70%) because it presents a very low Rf value by TLC. Data for NIM: 1H-NMR (400 Hz, CDCl3, δ): δ (ppm) = 8.566 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 8.521 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 8.380 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.686 (dd, J = 8.0, 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.259 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 4.148 (t, 7.6 Hz), 3.319 (s, 4H), 2.86 (s, 4H), 2.478 (s, 3H), 2.333 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.711 (m, 2H), 1.686 (m, 2H), and 1.478 (m, 2H).
After introducing HCl gas into a stirred DMF/acetone clear solution containing the compound NIM, the yellow H-NIM powder was collected by filtrating the turbid solution and was then recrystallized with hot acetone.

Preparation of the photoanodes
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (13 Ω □−1, 3.1 mm thick, 8% haze, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan) was used as the substrate for the photoanodes. The FTO glass was first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing 4% glass cleaner (PK-LCG545, Parker Corporation Co., Ltd., Japan) for 30 min and then immersed in another ultrasonic bath with deionized water for 30 min. After cleaning, the FTO glass was dipped in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered in an oven at 450 °C for 30 min. A thin, dense TiO2 underlayer was formed on the FTO glass to restrain the dark current.47 A TiO2 transparent active film was screen-printed on the TiCl4-treated FTO glass using commercial TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix SA, Switzerland); its thickness and area were 10 μm and 0.16 cm2, respectively. Subsequently, a scattering film was screen-printed on the transparent active TiO2 film using commercial TiO2 paste (PST-400C, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., Japan); its thickness was 2 μm. After screen-printing, the TiO2-coated FTO glass was sintered in an oven with a sequential process of 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min to remove the organic compounds from the TiO2 paste and to generate an anatase TiO2 nano-network structure. After the sequential sintering process, the TiO2-coated FTO glass was again dipped in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered in an oven at 500 °C for 30 min. The post-treatment of TiCl4 dipping enhanced the electron diffusivity in the mesoporous TiO2 film by forming a necking layer.47,48 Finally, the as-prepared TiO2 photoanodes were dipped into a pure N719 (D719, Everlight Chemical Industrial Co., Taiwan) solution and a mixing solution for 4 h. The mixing solutions contained N719 and H-NIM at various concentration ratios, from 9% to 50%, in DMSO/ethanol (volume ratio = 1/9). The concentration of N719 was set at 0.4 mM in all the mixing solutions.
Preparation of counter electrode
FTO glass (7 Ω □−1, 2.2 mm thick, Pilkington TEC 7, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan) was used as the substrate for the counter electrode. A two-step dip-coating process49–52 was used to fabricate the PVP-capped Pt nanocluster counter electrode. The FTO was dipped in 2% conditioner (ML371, OM Group, USA) at 70 °C for 5 min and then immersed in a solution of PVP-capped Pt nanoclusters at 40 °C for 5 min. After dipping, the FTO glass was rinsed with deionized water, dried in air, and then sintered in an oven at 325 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of DSSC devices
The TiO2 photoanode, on which both N719 and H-NIM molecules were adsorbed, and the PVP-capped Pt counter electrode were assembled face-to-face to form a sandwich-type structure and sealed with a 25 μm thick Surlyn film with a 0.36 cm2 open window under hot pressing at 115 °C for 10 s. Finally, a suitable amount of liquid electrolyte (0.2 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M PMII, 0.5 M TBP and 0.2 M TBAI in acetonitrile/valeronitrile, volume ratio = 85:15) was injected into the sealed DSSC via pre-drilled holes on the counter electrode side to fill the gap and form an electrical connection between the photoanode and counter electrode.
Characterization and photovoltaic performance measurements
The absorption spectra of the H-NIM fluorophore and N719 molecules in a solvent mixture of DMSO/ethanol (volume ratio = 1/9) were measured using a Thermo Genesys 6 UV-Visible (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) spectrophotometer, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc., USA) spectrofluorometer with a 1 nm bandpass and 1 cm cell length at room temperature. The fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica AF6000 fluorescence microscope with a DFC310 FX digital color camera (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany).
The resulting DSSCs were evaluated under AM1.5G (one sun, 1000 W m−2) illumination with a solar simulator (YSS-E40, Yamashita Denso Corp, Japan) and under 600 lux illumination with a dim light simulator (YUYI-LLS01, Yu-Yi Enterprise, Taiwan) including a miniature spectrometer pre-configured for general UV-VIS measurements (USB2000+UV-VIS, Ocean Optics, Inc., USA). The incident photo to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by a solar cell QE/IPCE measurement system (QE-3000, Titan Electro-Optics Co., Ltd., Taiwan). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed with various bias potentials from −0.4 V to −0.58 V under dark conditions using a potentiostat instrument (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab B.V., Netherlands) to characterize the electron transfer inside the DSSCs. The EIS settings included an AC amplitude of 10 mV with a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, a two-electrode configuration for the DSSC, and the photoanode as a working electrode. The photocurrent density distributions were mapped by a PV cell conversion efficiency distribution measurement system (MP15, Lasertec Corporation, Japan).

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the H-NIM fluorophore (donor) to N719 sensitizing dye molecules (acceptor) in a DSSC under illumination. (a) The N-Bu molecules are unable to adsorb onto the TiO2 nanoparticles due to lack of carboxylic groups. (b) A schematic of DSSC configuration with the TiO2 nanoparticle film coated with N719 and H-NIM molecules. (c) The H-NIM molecules adhere onto the TiO2 nanoparticles with their carboxylic groups as N719 does. The H-NIM molecules absorb ultraviolet light with a spectrum range of 350 to 450 nm and simultaneously transfer the absorbed energy to neighboring N719 dye molecules via the FRET effect; this remarkably enhances the light harvesting of the N719 dye molecules.	 

 	Fig. 2  Normalized absorption (left) and emission (right) spectra of N719 and H-NIM solutions. The concentrations of N719 and H-NIM are 5 × 10−5 M and 2 × 10−5 M, respectively, in DMSO/ethanol (volume ratio = 1/9). The fluorescence spectrum of the H-NIM fluorophore corresponds well to the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye molecules, which meets the requirement of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic of the position where the fluorescent microscope was focused. The focused position is the bottom of the TiO2 mesoporous film doped with the H-NIM fluorophore. (b) Bright-field image of the bottom of the TiO2 mesoporous film, showing the morphology of the film bottom. (c) Fluorescence image of the bottom of the TiO2 mesoporous film, showing a green fluorescence response which is consistent with the emission spectrum of H-NIM shown in Fig. 2. The fluorescence image is excited by an ultraviolet light cube that passes light through a 390/20 nm bp filter, and the emission is collected through a 405 nm lp filter of the fluorescent microscope. (d) Merged image of (b) and (c).	 

 	Fig. 4  Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with photoanodes soaked in various mixing solutions of N719 and H-NIM. The doping concentration ratios of H-NIM in the mixing solutions range from 0% to 50%, with a fixed concentration of N719 of 0.4 mM for all mixing solutions.	 

 	Fig. 5  Emission spectra of solutions containing N719 and H-NIM molecules desorbed from the TiO2 mesoporous films. The desorption process was performed by soaking the dye-loaded TiO2 photoanodes in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 3.5 h. The desorbed solutions were excited by an excitation light of 380 nm wavelength.

 	Fig. 6  Photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs doped with the H-NIM fluorophore in N719-loaded TiO2 mesoporous films under (a) 1 sun (AM1.5G) and (b) T5 fluorescent lamps with 600 lux illumination. The increase rates of the photocurrent density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), calculated from the data in (a) and (b), are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. The dotted trend lines show that the increase rates of JSC and PCE are enhanced with increasing doping concentration of H-NIM from 0% to 17%; the enhancement is more pronounced for the T5 fluorescent lamps at 600 lux illumination.

The mapping results show that the doping of 17% H-NIM results in the highest photocurrent density distribution, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance shown in Table 1.
