    , Accepted 12th August 2021First published on 25th August 2021AbstractDifferent cyclization reaction sites on the benzene ring will produce isomers during the cyclization process for the synthesis of small-molecule acceptors. Herein, we developed a structural unit (named BTMe) that can prevent isomerization during cyclization by introducing a methyl into a benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT) unit. Two fused ring electron acceptors (BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F) with the BTMe core were synthesized by changing the length of the side chain. When they were blended with donor PM6, the active layer PM6:BTMe-C8-2F exhibited a more excellent charge transport, phase morphology and π–π stacking, which are beneficial to improve the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Compared with BTMe-C6-2F, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on BTMe-C8-2F exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.72% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 19.65 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.76%. These results proved that it is a promising approach to achieve a high-performance small-molecule acceptor by changing the length of the side chain and introducing methyl groups to prevent the isomerization of the fused ring core owing to special reaction sites.
Introduction
Solar energy is considered as one of the most promising sources of energy because it could convert inexhaustible solar energy into electricity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) have many advantages, such as simple device structure, solution processability, flexibility and semi-transparency, so it is now a hot research topic.1–6 As far as the active layer materials of OSC are concerned, fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have attracted great attention due to their easy structural modification and outstanding photovoltaic performances.7–10 With the emergence of the ITIC series and Y6 series of FREAs, the organic photovoltaic (OPV) field has developed rapidly, and now the highest PCE of the single-junction OPV has exceeded 18%.11,12 The rapid development of the OPV is inseparable from the contribution of the FREAs which are usually composed of a central fused-ring core, electron-deficient terminals and side chains. The adjustment and modification of these three parts can effectively adjust the absorption spectrum, energy level and active layer morphology of FREAs, thereby further affecting the performances of OPV devices, such as Jsc, Voc and FF.13–20
Subtle differences in the structure of the materials may seriously influence the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances. However, these subtle differences are sometimes difficult to control during the synthesis process. Simultaneously, by-products often exist as a result of the difference in reaction selectivity. For instance, isomers are often produced due to the different cyclization reaction sites on the benzene ring during the synthesis process of FREAs.21–28 These factors will not only cause the uncertainty of the molecular structure, but also the difficulties in the purification process and the low yield. Therefore, in addition to reasonable molecular design, precise molecular synthesis is also indispensable for the development of high-performance FREAs. In order to achieve the specific structure of the target compound, we have to select the raw materials reasonably. For instance, Bo et al. controlled the cyclization site by introducing hexyloxy groups on naphthalene.25 Therefore, careful selection of raw materials and reasonable design of synthetic routes should be particularly important for precise synthesis of final products.
The performance of the device is not only affected by the optical properties of the active layer materials, but also by the morphology of the blend films. In terms of device fabrication, the morphology of the active layer material may usually be ameliorated by adding additives and/or undergoing post-treatments such as thermal annealing and solvent annealing. However, molecular design is a more effective approach to control the active layer morphology. Among them, side-chain engineering is one of the important means. According to the previously reported results,20,29–34 the π–π stacking in FREAs is considered to be an important factor in controlling charge transport, and the length of the alkyl side chain affects the aggregation behavior and stacking method of FREAs, thereby affecting the recombination and transfer of charges between acceptor and donor, and further affecting the device performance.
Herein, we designed and synthesized the first fused ring electron acceptor BTMe-C6-2F by introducing methyl groups on the BTMe core in order to prevent isomerization and increase the yield of FREA (Fig. 1). The second FREA BTMe-C8-2F was synthesized by reasonably changing the length of the side chain. It regulated the molecular packing behavior of FREA to a certain extent, reduced the energy loss of non-radiation recombination, and improved OSC device performances. The OSC device based on BTMe-C8-2F exhibited a PCE of 12.72%, which is higher than the PCE of 10.68% based on the device of BTMe-C6-2F. The PCE value is also higher than our group's previously reported OSC devices based on the three isomeric acceptors generated by the BTBT structural unit, which are Z1-aa (PCE of 4.56%), Z1-ab (PCE of 9.60%) and Z1-bb (PCE of 12.66%).

Results and discussion
Synthesis of FREAs
The synthetic routes of the FREAs BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the ESI.† We used a cheap p-chlorotoluene as the basic raw material and synthesized compound 1 through a two-step reaction according to the previously reported method.35,36 Then, liquid bromine was used for aromatic electrophilic reaction with compound 1 to obtain the brominated compound 2. Compound 3 was obtained by Miyaura borate reaction. Next, a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction between compound 3 and 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate was used to obtain compound 4. Compound 4 underwent nucleophilic reaction with the prepared Grignard reagent, and then was hydrolyzed to obtain the corresponding intermediate diol, which then was converted into compound 5 by an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization using amberlyst15 as the catalyst. Finally, compound 6 and the final FREAs BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F were obtained through Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction, respectively. The intermediates and target acceptors were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S23).
The comparison of cyclization reactions of BTMe-C6-2F with previously reported Z1-bb21 is shown in Fig. 1. Three isomers appeared when the Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction occurred on the BTBT core due to four reactive sites on the benzene ring.21,37 The efficient FREA Z1-bb achieved only a 13% total yield. The isomerization of the fused-ring core was easily prevented by introducing a methyl group on the BTBT core, the intermediate compound 5 (BTMe-C6) was achieved with a yield of 66%, and a total yield of 47% was achieved from compound 4 to FREA BTMe-C6-2F (similar to 48% for BTMe-C8-2F), which is more than three times that of Z1-bb. At the same time, it is lucky that intermediates 5 and 6 can form crystalline solids, which can be easily purified by recrystallization, instead of the commonly used column chromatography, thus the cost is greatly reduced.
The solubility of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F is slightly different. BTMe-C8-2F is soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform at room temperature, which ensures its good solution processability. But for BTMe-C6-2F, it needs to be sonicated at room temperature or slightly heated up to completely dissolve. In addition, both of the FREAs show good thermal stability from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S24, ESI†). The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F are 390 °C and 388 °C, respectively.
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
In order to explore the influence of introducing methyl groups on the BTMe core and changing the length of the alkyl side chain, we investigated the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the two FREAs. The UV-vis spectra of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F in chloroform solution (1.0 × 10−5 M) and films together with the donor PM6 film on the quartz glass are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. From the absorption curves of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F in solution, we can find that the absorption profile shapes and maximum absorption peak positions of them are very similar. But compared with BTMe-C8-2F, the absorption range of BTMe-C6-2F is slightly wider, and its molar absorption coefficient is about 1.80 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is slightly higher than the 1.71 × 105 M−1 cm−1 of BTMe-C8-2F. These phenomena may be caused by the stronger intermolecular interaction of BTMe-C6-2F, which can be better reflected by the normalized absorption of films. Compared to the absorption in solution, the normalized absorption of the films shows a certain red shift with obvious shoulder peaks (628 nm and 693 nm of BTMe-C6-2F, 624 nm and 681 nm of BTMe-C8-2F), which indicates that both BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F show strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and molecular aggregation in the solid state. Compared with BTMe-C8-2F, the maximum absorption peak position of BTMe-C6-2F exhibits a redshifted absorption peak (12 nm), which indicates that BTMe-C6-2F possesses tighter π–π packing and stronger molecular aggregation. The longer alkyl chain of BTMe-C8-2F may prevent partly the tight aggregation of conjugated building blocks, thereby reducing the probability of electronic transitions. Moreover, compared to the film absorption curve of FREA Z1-bb21 (Fig. 2b), a more obvious ICT peak (628 nm) and wider absorption range can be observed in BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F film for the introduction of electron-donating methyl groups. However, the maximum absorption peak positions of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F are 693 nm and 681 nm, respectively, which exhibit a blue-shifted absorption compared with the 710 nm of Z1-bb. This result may be attributable to the steric hindrance of methyl groups, which can cause weaker intermolecular π–π packing. However, the films absorption of two FREAs show good complementary absorption with the film absorption spectrum of donor PM6.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the two FREAs were measured by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry, which are shown in Fig. 2c. The corresponding energy level diagram is illustrated in Fig. 2d. We can observe that the initial reduction potentials of BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F are −0.32 V and −0.35 V, respectively, and the corresponding LUMO energy levels are −4.06 eV and −4.03 eV, respectively. Both small molecule acceptors show the same initial oxidation potential of 1.32 V, and the corresponding HOMO energy level is −5.70 eV. Compared with Z1-bb (−3.92 eV of LUMO and −5.70 eV of HOMO) without a methyl group, there is no significant change, and their HOMO energy levels match well with the donor material PM6 (−5.40 eV), indicating that they are suitable for blending with PM6 to form an active layer to manufacture OSCs.
Photovoltaic performance
In order to study the photovoltaic performances of the two FREAs, the OSCs were prepared with the inverted device structure ITO/ZnO/PM6:acceptor/MoO3/Al, where the acceptor is BTMe-C6-2F or BTMe-C8-2F. When the mass ratio of the donor to acceptor is 1:1 and CF is used as the solvent, the two devices can achieve better performance after an extra post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. However, the performances of the devices are inferior (Table S1, ESI†) even when the additive, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), is added to the blend film based on PM6:BTMe-C6-2F, which might be attributed to improper phase separation due to excessive aggregation of BTMe-C6-2F and PM6. But adding appropriate additives to the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film can promote the crystallization between the acceptor and the donor, which can improve the performance of the device.38–42 Therefore, the best performances of the two devices were obtained without additives for BTMe-C6-2F and 1 vol% CN for BTMe-C8-2F.
The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2. The device based on PM6:BTMe-C6-2F displays an optimal PCE of 10.68% with a high Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.00%. The Voc of the OSC based on PM6:BTMe-C8-2F is 0.97 V, and its Jsc and FF are 19.65 mA cm−2 and 66.76%, respectively. The Voc obtained from the two devices are similar because the energy levels of the two FREAs are approximative.43,44 The Jsc and FF values of the OSCs based on BTMe-C8-2F are significantly higher than those of the OSCs based on BTMe-C6-2F, so a higher PCE of 12.72% is obtained. The significant difference for photovoltaic performances between the two devices is probably due to the different intermolecular forces leading to different molecular orientations, which affects the dissociation of excitons and the transfer of charges. This will be verified in the later section of exciton dissociation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSCs present high EQE responses in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm (Fig. 3b). Compared with BTMe-C6-2F, the OSC based on BTMe-C8-2F displays the higher EQE response along with the maximum integrated Jsc. These integrated Jcal values (16.79 mA cm−2 of BTMe-C6-2F and 19.05 mA cm−2 of BTMe-C8-2F) are well consistent with the measured Jsc within the experimental error of 5%. The normalized UV-vis spectra of the blend films have also been investigated. As shown in Fig. S25 (ESI†), the blend film based on PM6:BTMe-C8-2F exhibits a slight red-shift absorption compared with PM6:BTMe-C6-2F, which is consistent with the EQE spectra. This phenomenon may be attributed to more appropriate intermolecular packing, which is beneficial to intramolecular charge transfer.

Film morphology and charge transport mobility
The morphology of the active layer is a key factor affecting the performance of OSC devices. The surface height and phase images of the PM6:acceptor films were analyzed by tapping atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4, the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film exhibits a RMS value of 8.72 nm, which is slightly larger than the PM6:BTMe-C6-2F blend film with a RMS of 5.78 nm. The larger RMS of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film may be attributed to the addition of appropriate CN that will improve the crystallinity between the acceptor and donor, resulting in suitable phase separation and tighter molecular arrangement in the active layer. Similar results were reported previously.40,45,46 In addition, a comparatively clearer fiber distribution and continuous nanophase separation can be observed in the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film, which has previously been proved to be beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transportation in OSCs. Therefore, it is reasonable for the device based on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film to show higher Jsc and FF.
 Fig. 4  AFM height and phase images of the blend films of PM6:BTMe-C6-2F (a and c) and PM6:BTMe-C8-2F (b and d) (500 nm × 500 nm). 
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was tested to study the intermolecular packing and orientation. The 2D diffraction images and the corresponding line-cutting diagrams about pure films and blend films are shown in Fig. S26 (ESI†) and Fig. 5 respectively, and detailed data are listed in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). Both BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F pure films don’t show a clear π–π (010) peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The lamellar (100) peaks can be observed in both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions as for BTMe-C6-2F and BTME-C8-2F films, which implies BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F have both face-on and edge-on orientations relative to the substrate. However, the lamellar distance of BTMe-C6-2F is smaller than that of BTMe-C8-2F, showing 1.47 nm (BTMe-C6-2F) versus 1.50 nm (BTMe-C8-2F) from the 100 peaks in the OOP direction. In addition, BTMe-C6-2F shows an extra 002 peak and 200 peak. These results are consistent with the UV-vis absorption rule of films, indicating that BTMe-C6-2F with a shorter side chain possesses stronger molecular interactions which leads to stronger self-aggregation. At the same time, referring to the GIWAXS of Z1-bb, this phenomenon may be attributed to the steric hindrance effect of methyl groups to the movement of molecules, which causes the stacking of molecules to be more disorderly, but the lengthening of the side chain is beneficial to eliminate the influence of steric hindrance. For blend films of PM6:BTME-C6-2F and PM6:BTME-C8-2F, the same 100 peak (0.32 Å−1, d = 1.96 nm) in the IP direction can be observed, and the 100 peaks in the OOP direction were 0.31 Å−1 (d = 2.00 nm) and 0.35 Å−1 (d = 1.78 nm), respectively. The 010 peaks of the two blend films in the OOP direction are both 1.79 Å−1 (d = 0.35 nm), but the intensity of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film is obviously stronger, which indicates that the face-on orientation on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film is preferred to the PM6:BTMe-C6-2F blend film. The preferential face-on orientation is more conducive to the transport of charge carriers.12,29,47–50 These results are consistent with the better devices performances of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film.
 Fig. 5  2D GIWAXS patterns (left) and line-cut scattering profiles along the IP and OOP directions (right) for blend films. 
The charge transport mobilities of the blend films were investigated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (as shown in Fig. S27, ESI†). The hole/electron mobilities of PM6:BTMe-C6-2F and PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend films are 1.90 × 10−4/1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.63 × 10−4/2.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the ratios of hole to electron mobility (μh/μe) are 1.74 and 1.02, respectively (see Table 3). It is obvious that the electron mobility and hole mobility of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film are higher than those of the PM6:BTMe-C6-2F blend film, and the hole mobility and the electron mobility are more balanced (μh/μe is closer to 1). This result is consistent with the results of better phase morphology and better face-on orientation in the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film, which also supports the higher Jsc and FF of the OSC devices based on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F.

Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra (Fig. 6a) were characterized to study exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior in BHJ based on different active layers. When the excitation wavelength is 600 nm, the acceptors’ emission peaks are located at 738 nm (1.68 eV) and 726 nm (1.71 eV) respectively, which is consistent with the rule of the UV-vis absorption spectra. Simultaneously, when blended with PM6, the luminescence phenomenon of BTMe-C8-2F becomes extremely weak with the quenching probability of 97%, which is higher than BTMe-C6-2F of 94%. This result demonstrates that the charge transfer in the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film will be more effective because its photon utilization rate is higher, which is conducive to obtaining higher Jsc.

The degree of exciton dissociation can be evaluated by the curve of photocurrent density–effective voltage (Jph–Veff), and the result is shown in Fig. 6b. When Veff increases to a certain value, Jph reaches a saturated value (Jsat), implying that all of the excitons are dissociated into free charges and collected by electrodes. The charge collection probability can be expressed as Pc = Jsc/Jsat. The Pc of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F device is slightly higher (0.91), compared with 0.88 of the PM6:BTMe-C6-2F device. This indicates that the device based on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film has more effective exciton dissociation and carrier collection.
To study the charge recombination in active layers, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity were investigated. The mechanism of charge recombination can be simply reflected by the formula Voc∝Ilight (nkbT/q). When the n value is close to 2, a higher Voc dependence on the light intensity will be observed, which means that the recombination is dominated by the monomolecular recombination or trap-assisted recombination, and when the n value is close to 1, the recombination is dominated by the bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 6c, the n value of PM6:BTMe-C6-2F and PM6:BTMe-C8-2F devices is 1.40 and 1.29, respectively, which indicates that the recombination is dominated by the bimolecular recombination in both the devices of PM6:BTMe-C6-2F and PM6:BTMe-C8-2F. The Jsc dependence on light intensity can reflect the degree of charge recombination, and its relationship can be simply described as Jsc∝(Ilight)α. When the α value is closer to 1, the bimolecular recombination is basically negligible. On the contrary, the farther the α value deviates from 1, the higher the degree of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 6d, the α values of the PM6:BTMe-C6-2F and PM6:BTMe-C8-2F devices are 0.86 and 0.90, respectively, which indicates that the bimolecular recombination is more suppressed in the device based on PM6:BTMe-C8-2F relative to PM6:BTMe-C6-2F. Based on these results, the charge recombination can be effectively depressed by appropriately increasing the length of the alkyl chain, which is beneficial for higher Jsc and FF, ultimately resulting in a higher PCE of the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F-based device.
Conclusions
In summary, two FREAs BTMe-C6-2F and BTMe-C8-2F were successfully synthesized, both of them can prevent the production of isomers during cyclization by introducing methyl groups into the benzothienobenzothiophene unit. We also studied the photovoltaic performance differences of these two FREAs with side chains of different length. Because the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blended film shows a more suitable phase separation size and a better molecular stacking morphology compared to PM6:BTMe-C6-2F, the OSC device based on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film exhibits more balanced charge transport and less charge recombination, which are beneficial to increase Jsc and FF. As a result, the OSC device based on the PM6:BTMe-C8-2F blend film exhibits a PCE of 12.72% (Voc = 0.97 V, Jsc = 19.65 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.76%), which is higher than the PCE of 10.68% of the device based on BTMe-C6-2F. These results indicate that it is an effective method to achieve low cost and convenient synthesis by introducing methyl groups on the fused ring core to prevent its isomerization originating from special reaction sites changing. At the same time, changing the length of the side chain is also an important way to improve the photovoltaic performances of the OSCs by controlling the morphology of blend films.
