    , Accepted 25th August 2022First published on 26th August 2022AbstractThe layer-by-layer (LBL) processing approach has recently been under intensive investigation to fabricate efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) reconsidering its many positive aspects over the bulk-heterojunction configuration. Moreover, with recently reported successful solid additives as morphology controllers, they are becoming key elements for high-performance PSCs; however, their application in LBL systems has been scarce. Herein, we carry out a comprehensive investigation into the effect of benzothiadiazole (BT) and its fluorinated analogs (FBT and 2FBT) as solid additives on the device performance of a PM6/Y6-based LBL platform. The use of FBT in the PM6 donor layer results in a suitable morphology that ensures efficient charge transport/generation properties and suppresses recombination loss, boosting the photovoltaic performance of the LBL device. These intriguing results prompt us to further study the FBT treatment in other LBL systems (PTQ10/Y6 and PM6/BTP-eC9), leading to a considerable efficiency of up to 17.71% with low inevitable convolution arising from the molecular weight variations of the used polymers. Besides, we also demonstrate efficient large-area FBT-processed LBL PSCs (efficiencies of 16.10% (0.92 cm2) and 10.93% (2.50 cm2)) with high device reproducibility. This study is not only invaluable in shaping our understanding of LBL PSCs, but also provides the possibility of overcoming their device-to-device variations in both small- and large-area single cells.
Introduction
In recent decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received a great deal of attention owing to their unique advantages, such as light weight, mechanical flexibility, and low production cost via roll-to-roll solution processing technology.1–3 The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) configuration comprising a blend of donor and acceptor components is the most efficient strategy to fabricate the active layer in high-performance PSCs.4–6 With tremendous efforts devoted to material development and device engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ PSCs has recently exceeded 18% in laboratory-scale single-junction PSCs.7–11 Despite the great success in PCEs reported for BHJ PSCs, the BHJ processing method has inevitable drawbacks as follows: (i) an extremely complicated process with numerous parameters (e.g., domain size and mixed phase), (ii) strong morphological sensitivity to the history and time of the blend solution, (iii) limited construction of desirable vertical component distribution, and (iv) difficulty in controlling the desired morphology consistently during different film-forming processes.12–16
PSCs with a stacked structure prepared via the sequential deposition of donor and acceptor layers, known as the layer-by-layer (LBL) processing approach, were initially developed before the invention of BHJ PSCs.17–19 Disappointingly, it turned out that the PCEs were less than 2%, which was far lower than those obtained for BHJ PSCs.20,21 This is due to limited donor/acceptor interfaces in the active layer, which is a setback for this approach.22
Driven by its great potential for circumventing the aforementioned notorious issues related to the BHJ approach, the LBL approach has become increasingly popular anew as a promising alternative.13,23–28 Furthermore, several studies have pointed out that the superior stability and eco-friendly fabrication of LBL PSCs over BHJ PSCs might be more favorable for the industrial application of large-scale PSCs.24,25,29–31 Although some high-performance PSCs via the LBL approach have been reported lately, these studies still largely lag behind those of BHJ PSCs; they lack a clear and quantitative morphological picture and the fundamental mechanism underlying the LBL film formation.
In the PSC community, solid additives have recently drawn considerable attention owing to their many attractive advantages, including good morphology-directing abilities, simple post treatments, and enhanced device stabilities; therefore, they are becoming the key elements for high-performance PSC devices.11,32–35 However, successful solid additives in LBL systems have rarely been reported.36,37
By aiming at not only improving the current understanding of LBL PSCs but also elucidating the functional role played by solid additives within them, here we investigated the influence of solid additives, including benzothiadiazole (BT) and its fluorinated analogs (FBT and 2FBT), on the film morphology and device performance of the PM6/Y6-based LBL PSC platform. BT derivatives are the most widely used building blocks for constructing high-performance conjugated materials in optoelectronic applications.5,38–41 Therefore, we thought that their backbone structures are well compatible with high-performance active layer materials, which can assist the intermolecular interactions between the BTs and active layer materials, thus properly modulating the morphology of the active layer. In PM6/Y6-based LBL PSCs tested in our study, adding an optimal amount of FBT into the PM6 donor layer contributed to optimizing the morphology, leading to a PCE of 16.63%, which is higher than those of the references without and with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN). More attractively, upon employing the FBT treatment in the broadened LBL platform toolboxes, we achieved a PCE of up to 17.71%, with minimal device-to-device variations undeniably induced by different molecular weights of the used polymers. In addition, large-scale PSCs were also fabricated and impressive PCEs of 16.10% (0.92 cm2) and 10.93% (2.50 cm2) with highly uniform device performances were achieved.
Results and discussion
Characterization of BT solid additives
Before analyzing, first, we point out the unique and fascinating features of BT derivatives (BT, FBT, and 2FBT), such as easy preparation or commercial availability, excellent stability, and electro-optical characteristics combined with their ability to adopt a quinoid structure (Fig. 1a).42,43

Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) revealed that all the BT derivatives began to lose weight in the low temperature range of 50–70 °C (Fig. S1†), verifying their high volatility for application as suitable solid additives in PSCs. We also calculated the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of the BT derivatives using density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. 1a). It is clear that relative to the symmetric structures (BT and 2FBT), asymmetric FBT has a more localized charge distribution, which can afford the possibility to enhance intermolecular electrostatic interaction with photoactive materials within a polarized molecular environment.44 We expect that employing the BT solid additives during the fabrication of donor and acceptor layers will produce very different intermolecular dynamics, leading to totally different morphology/crystallinity and thus dramatic variation in the device performances.
Next, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAX) was conducted to investigate the effect of BT solid additives on the molecular orientation and crystalline properties of each neat PM6 donor and Y6 acceptor film. The thin films were spin cast without and with each optimal amount of the BT solid additives, respectively, and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 5 min as used for the following photovoltaic tests of LBL devices.
As seen in the GIWAX data (Fig. 2 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2†), all the Y6 acceptor films showed very similar microstructures with a strong (010) π–π diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction accompanied by a (100) lamellar peak in the in-plane (IP) direction, regardless of the use and type of the BT solid additives. Conversely, using the BT solid additives in the PM6 donor considerably improved the microstructural ordering along with forming larger crystallites; this is evidenced by more distinctive (010) π–π diffraction peaks and longer-range ordered (h00) lamellar diffraction peaks along with OOP as well as the increased crystallite coherence lengths (CCLh00 = 39.29–47.96 Å and CCL010 = 20.67–28.68 Å) in the BT solid additive-processed PM6 donor films compared to the nonadditive-processed one (CCLh00 = 36.19 Å and CCL010 = 15.42 Å). This observation could be originated from the well-controlled morphology through the preferential intermolecular interactions between the BT solid additives and PM6 donor polymer. Additionally, by comparing the atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PM6 donor films produced without and with the BT solid additives (Fig. S3 and S4†), we found that the additive-processed PM6 donor films exhibited larger root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) values and more well-connected crystalline structures than the nonadditive one. These observations can provide additional proof of the improved crystalline character via the treatment of the BT solid additives.

Photovoltaic properties
To explore the effect of BT solid additives on the photovoltaic properties, the LBL devices with an area of 0.048 cm2 were fabricated without and with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/PM6 donor layer/Y6 acceptor layer/PDINO/Al (the chemical structures of PM6 and Y6 are shown in Fig. 1b). The optimized fabrication processes of PM6/Y6 based on the LBL layer were performed by the addition of chloroform (CF) solvent mixed with 0.5% (v/v) CN solvent and thermal annealing at 100 °C in the donor and acceptor layers for 5 min, respectively, as reported in a previous study.36,45 All the devices examined in this study were made under the same conditions (the schematic illustration for the fabrication of LBL systems is shown in Fig. 1c and described in the ESI Experimental section† for the detailed information), and their tests were performed using a standard AM1.5 G spectrum with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Although the TGA data already evidenced the proper volatility of the BT solid additives at low temperatures, their complete removal in the optimal devices with such thermal annealing process was further confirmed via additional experiments: after annealing for 5 min at 100 °C, (i) the disappearance of their traces on the Si substrate surface film (Fig. S5a†), (ii) the capture of BT solid additives on the bulk state using the sublimation experiment (Fig. S5b†) and (iii) vanishing of their characteristic peak at 820 cm−1 determined using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurement in the films blended with the PM6 and solid additives (Fig. S6†).46 Furthermore, to clarify that solid additives volatilize perfectly in the fabricated PSC devices, we investigated PM6 + BT solid additives (weight ratio of 1:1) using the TGA measurement (Fig. S7†). In the TGA profile, 50% of weight loss is observed while maintaining the temperature at 100 °C for 5 min, which confirms that under the optimization conditions, our solid additives volatilize perfectly in the fabricated PSC devices. Therefore, we can rule out the possibility that some solid additives might remain in the fabricated PSC devices. For a fair comparison, we first evaluated the device performances of the PM6/Y6 LBL control reference PSCs without any additive and with a 0.5% (v/v) CN solvent additive, respectively, delivering PCEs of 14.75% (without any additive), 14.80% (CN addition into the PM6 donor layer, named PM6(CN)/Y6), and 15.74% (CN addition into the Y6 acceptor layer, named PM6/Y6(CN)) (see Fig. 3a and Table 1 for relevant photovoltaic parameters, such as the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF)). For CN-processed LBL systems, the improvement in FFs is a major contributor to the increase in PCEs.

The device performances of PM6/Y6 LBL with the BT solid additives were then optimized by adjusting their loading contents (10–40% (w/w) addition into the PM6 donor and Y6 acceptor layer, respectively). The best current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are displayed in Fig. 3b, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The other data screened in this study are included in Fig. S8–S10 and Tables S3–S5.†
As listed in Table 1, interestingly, there is an opposite tendency in the device performances compared to the CN-processed LBL systems. The devices fabricated by applying the BT solid additives into the PM6 donor layer (denoted as PM6 (solid additive's name)/Y6) exhibited higher PCEs with improved photovoltaic parameters compared to the PSCs with their use within the Y6 acceptor layer (denoted to as PM6/Y6 (solid additive's name)). This difference in this phenomenon could be due to different mechanisms between the two kinds of additives; that is, the CN solvent additive with a high boiling point helps to improve the crystallization and diffusion.31,47 On the other hand, the volatile BT-based solid additives left enough space for the self-assembly and interdiffusion of the two components to form a preferable vertical component distribution with sufficient donor/acceptor interfaces.48
Furthermore, adding each optimal amount of the solid additives led to a higher JSCs but a slightly lower VOC. For the FBT- and 2FBT-processed cases, optimized performances were obtained with the 30% (w/w) addition into PM6, whereas for the BT case, a 20% (w/w) ratio was added into PM6. The FBT/Y6-processed device delivered the best PCE of 16.63%, with considerable improvements in the JSC (26.14 mA cm−2) and FF (75.57%) values, being far higher than that of the fully optimized one with CN, verifying that FBT can serve as an effective solid additive in LBL systems. We especially focused on the optimized PM6/Y6(CN) reference and PM6 (solid additive)/Y6 devices and compared their device performances in the following studies.

Fig. 3c displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized LBL devices with various additives. It is clear that both FBT and 2FBT-processed devices show enhancement in EQE in the region of 400–900 nm, suggesting that using fluorinated BT solid additives (FBT and 2FBT) in LBL systems can help in organizing the optimal morphology. Notably, we observed that the FBT and 2FBT additive systems remarkably increased the EQE from 650–900 nm, which means that the desirable morphology of the PM6/Y6 under treatment of FBT or 2FBT can trigger the photon to electron response from the Y6 phase (the detailed explanations are mentioned in the morphology section). Moreover, the EQE results are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from J–V characteristics (within a 5% mismatch).
We characterized the charge-carrier dynamics to elucidate the functional role of the solid additives within the PM6 donor layer in the LBL system. First, by fitting the J–V curves in the space-charge-limited current region (SCLC) (Fig. S11†), the hole mobility (μh) values were calculated, as summarized in Fig. 3d and Table S6.†49,50 The μh values were in the order of PM6/Y6(CN) (4.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) < PM6(BT)/Y6 (5.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) < PM6(2FBT)/Y6 (5.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) < PM6(FBT)/Y6 (5.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating the better charge transport properties of the PM6(FBT)/Y6 device. For further investigation of charge carrier mobility, we measured the mobilities of the LBL systems treated with CN and BT solid additives via photo-induced charger-carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurement. As shown in Fig. S12,† the device treated with FBT exhibits the highest mobility of 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 among all devices, which supports the interpretation of the SCLC results.
The light intensity (I) dependent J–V characteristics were next investigated to determine the effect of the additives on the charge recombination of the devices, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. A power-law equation JSC ∝ Iα expresses the relationship between JSC and I, where α denotes the extent of the bimolecular recombination. Furthermore, the dependence of VOCversus ln(I) can be described using the slope of kT/q, where k, T, and q denote the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary charge, respectively.51 Compared with those obtained in the other devices, PM6(FBT)/Y6 had a higher α = 0.988 and a smaller slope of 1.452kT/q, implying the relatively weak bimolecular and Shockley–Read–Hall recombination losses.52 For further investigations, we plotted the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) for the devices (Fig. S13†) and then calculated Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit condition and at the maximum power output (Table S7†), where Jsat is defined as the saturated Jph at a sufficiently high Veff. The Jph/Jsat values of the PM6(FBT)/Y6 device (Jph/Jsat = 99.1% under the short-circuit condition and Jph/Jsat = 78.9% at the maximum power output) were higher than those of the other ones (Jph/Jsat = 97.4–98.8% under the short-circuit condition and Jph/Jsat = 75.1–77.35% at the maximum power output), demonstrating that more efficient exciton dissociation and better charge collection occur in the PM6(FBT)/Y6 device. Collectively, the improved properties in terms of μh, recombination behavior and charge dissociation/extraction efficiency, account for the observed higher JSC and FF values of the PM6(FBT)/Y6 device.
Morphological properties
We characterized the morphology and molecular ordering/packing characteristics of the LBL films with different additives under optimized conditions using GIWAXS, AFM, and TEM. As shown in the GIWAX data in Fig. 4, all the LBL films showed an IP (100) lamellar peak and a strong OOP (010) π–π stacking peak indicating face-on organization on the substrate. All the BT solid additive-processed LBL films have larger lamellar d-spacing and π-stacking distance values than the LBL reference film with CN (Table S8†). Relative to the other films, the CCL100 and CCL010 values increased in the LBL films with FBT and 2FBT, being consistent with the trends observed for the PM6 neat films. From the GIWAXS data, one can conclude that introducing the FBT or 2FBT solid additives tends to form larger crystallite sizes of the PM6/Y6 layers while maintaining the molecular orientation, and effectively improve charge carrier transport properties.25 This result supports the interpretation in the above EQE part.
 Fig. 4  (a) 2D GIWAX images and (b) the corresponding line cut profiles of the PM6/Y6 LBL films with additives. 
As seen from Fig. S14,† the AFM images of all the films exhibit no distinct difference in phase separation surfaces with small Rqs on the top layer (Y6). Note that, compared to the PM6/Y6 film with the CN additive, the PM6(FBT or 2FBT)/Y6 film shows finer phase separation with increased roughness in AFM images. The formation of desirable morphology with the FBT or 2FBT additive increases the interfacial areas of the donor/acceptor domain and thus effectively promotes exciton dissociation probability, which corresponds to the interpretation of EQE enhancement in the range of 650–900 nm. Conversely, their TEM data reveal apparently different morphological features of the bulk; for example, compared with the LBL reference film with CN and BT, uniformly formed larger domains were observed in the FBT and 2FBT solid additive-processed LBL films (Fig. S15†). Specifically, the LBL film with FBT could form appropriate interpenetrating networks with a more optimal domain size than the other cases, being responsible for suppressing the recombination loss and superior charge transport/generation efficacy observed in the above study.53
Effect of the FBT additive on different molecular weights of donor polymers
It is well known that the molecular weight of a polymer has a profound influence on macromolecular ordering, the microstructure, and additionally on optoelectronic and charge transport characteristics.25,54,55 Therefore, it is a key parameter governing the PSC performance. In addition to the optimal-molecular weight of the PM6 batch (number-average molecular weight (Mn) = 41.3 kDa) used in the above study, in our work, we synthesized lower- and higher-Mn PM6 batches (denoted as L-PM6 (Mn = 30.4 kDa) and H-PM6 (Mn = 49.3 kDa), respectively) by controlling the reaction time (see the ESI Experimental section† for the detailed information on different PM6 batches). With such batches at hand, we also investigated the influence of the CN versus FBT additives on the PSC performances of the L-PM6/Y6 and H-PM6 LBL platforms, where the devices were fabricated according to their optimal conditions. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the four LBL devices (L-PM6/Y6(CN), H-PM6/Y6(CN), L-PM6(FBT)/Y6, and H-PM6(FBT)/Y6), and Table 2 summarizes the relevant photovoltaic parameters. As expected, the PCEs of the devices fabricated with L-PM6 and H-PM6 were lower than those of the corresponding optimal-molecular weight PM6-devices. The reason for this phenomenon was explained in detail in our previous study.56 Anyhow, it is clear that the FBT-processed devices outperform the corresponding CN-processed devices (a higher PCE of L-PM6(FBT)/Y6 over L-PM6/Y6(CN) and a higher PCE of H-PM6(FBT)/Y6 over H-PM6/Y6(CN)). We also characterized the morphology of each neat H-PM6 and PM6 with and without FBT by using TEM. As shown in Fig. S16,† excessive aggregation is observed in both the neat H-PM6 and PM6 films, while the FBT-treated films show possibly more optimal aggregates with appropriate domain sizes.

Notably, the PCEs of the CN-processed devices are highly dependent on the Mns of PM6, whereas the devices with FBT have far less sensitivity to their variation (Fig. 5b). Such results are quite encouraging, revealing the possibility of using the FBT solid additive to solve a notorious issue of PSCs.
Herein, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was further conducted to elucidate the vertical component distribution of the optimal H-PM6/Y6(CN) and H-PM6(FBT)/Y6 LBL films. The depth profiles of the active layers with a nitrogen N 1s peak (398 eV) are shown in Fig. 5c and d. Because rather than the PM6 donor, only the Y6 acceptor contained the N element, the N signal was observed as a quantitative character at different depths. Both films without etching showed strong N 1s signals, indicating the good distribution of Y6 at the top region in the LBL systems. With the increasing etching period time, the N 1s signal gradually decreased. Compared to the CN-processed film, the FBT-processed film exhibited higher N 1s signals at different etching depths, indicating the occurrence of downward interdiffused evolution of the Y6 acceptor into the PM6 donor layer phase (so called a pseudo-bilayer morphology); accordingly, the separation and transport of charges could be enhanced. Their morphology-related data, such as AFM and TEM images, are provided in the ESI (Fig. S17),† showing a similar trend to those observed in the above comparative studies conducted with the optimal-Mn PM6 batch.
Broad applications of the FBT additive in different systems
In the final part of this study, to verify the broad applicability of FBT, we chose two high-performing LBL systems, such as PTQ10/Y6 and PM6/BTP-eC9 (the chemical structures of PTQ10 and BTP-eC9 are shown in Fig. S18†) among recently reported LBL PSCs (latest reported LBL PSCs are summarized in Table S9†).
The reference devices were fabricated according to the previously reported optimized process (CF solvent and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)).23,57 In summary, adding the solvent additive (0.25% (v/v) for Y6 and 0.5% (v/v) for BTP-eC9) into the acceptor layer and total thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min and the 30% (w/w) FBT addition into the PM6 donor layer resulted in optimal performances for the FBT-processed LBL systems. Fig. 6 shows the plot of J–V curves of the four LBL devices, and the device parameters are listed in Table 3. As observed in the above PM6/Y6 LBL systems, the PTQ10(FBT)/Y6 and PM6(FBT)/BTP-eC9 devices yielded similar VOCs, but larger JSCs and higher FFs than the corresponding DIO-processed ones. Therefore, higher PCEs of 16.01% and 17.71% could be achieved in the PTQ10(FBT)/Y6 and PM6(FBT)/BTP-eC9 devices, respectively, compared to PTQ10/Y6(DIO) and PM6/BTP-eC9(DIO) ones. Note that a PCE of 17.71% is the highest reported value in PM6 donor-based PSCs with various volatile solid additives (Table S10†). Herein, we compared the performances of the LBL devices containing a higher amount of the Mns-based H-PTQ10 and H-PM6 donor polymers (see the ESI Experimental section† for information related to the Mn values of PTQ10). Relative to the above corresponding results, the devices based on H-PTQ10 and H-PM6 showed somewhat inferior device performances. However, a similar trend was observed regarding the effect of Mn on the above PM6/Y6 device performances; that is, the FBT-processed PTQ10/Y6 and PM6/BTP-eC9 systems have less PCE variation than those of the DIO-processed ones while varying the Mns of the polymers (see Table S11†). The above results validate that using the FBT solid additive can successfully improve the PCEs of polymer-based PSCs while mitigating device-to-device variations.

The printing of large-area PSCs is also regarded as a critical step in their industrial applications. Therefore, we attempted to fabricate LBL PSC devices based on the best-performing PM6/BTP-eC9 combination with large areas of 0.92 cm2 (close to 1 cm2), which is the general area for large-area devices. The J–V curves of the large-area devices are depicted in Fig. S19a,† and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 4. First, the control reference PSCs with DIO showed 15.49% (0.92 cm2) with a reduced JSC of 25.73 mA cm−2 and FF of 72.56%. Increased recombination processes and sheet resistance in the large-area single cells can result in overall lower performances with decreased JSC and FF values than those of the corresponding small-area control devices above. On the other hand, the large-area FBT-processed PM6/BTP-eC9 PSCs deliver better PCEs of 16.10% with higher values of JSC and FF. Furthermore, to confirm the maximized effect of FBT treatment in large-area devices, we fabricated the LBL PSC devices with a sizable area of 2.50 cm2. Compared with the control reference devices with a PCE of 9.63%, the sizable-area devices with FBT treatment achieve a PCE of 10.93%, which also ensures the advantageous usage of the FBT solid additive for achieving efficient large-scale production of PSCs (Fig. S19b† and Table 4). Interestingly, it should be worth noting that relative to the corresponding reference ones, the large-area FBT-processed PM6/BTP-eC9 PSCs reveal superior reproducibility in regard to device performance; more than 15 devices within trivial error ranges of 6.71/19.00% (DIO-processed devices) and 3.85/9.33% (FBT-processed devices) for device areas of 0.92 cm2 and 2.50 cm2, respectively (Fig. 7).

Conclusion
To sum up, we introduced BT derivatives (BT, FBT, and 2FBT) into a PM6/Y6-based LBL platform to investigate whether they are effective solid additives for improving the morphology and photovoltaic performance. Comparative studies along with the control references without and with the CN solvent additive showed that adding an optimal amount of FBT into the PM6 donor layer (so called PM6(FBT)/Y6 device) resulted in combined positive aspects in improving the charge transport/generation properties and suppressing the recombination loss through suitable structural and morphological changes, including appropriate interpenetrating networks with optimal domain size and pseudo-bilayer configuration. Consequently, the PM6(FBT)/Y6-processed device yielded an outstanding PCE of 16.63%, considerably higher than those of the fully optimized references. More interestingly, in the investigation extended to the other LBL systems (PTQ10/Y6 and PM6/BTP-eC9), using FBT resulted in the best PCE of up to 17.71% with an impressive reduction of device-to-device variations derived from different Mns-polymer batches. Besides, by taking unique advantages of FBT-processed LBL systems, efficient large-area PSCs (PCEs = 16.10% (0.92 cm2) and 10.93% (2.50 cm2)) with robust device reproducibility were also fabricated. These results clearly define the utilization of FBT as a promising pathway for improving the device performance of LBL PSCs combined with circumventing the performance variations, regardless of the single device sizes.
