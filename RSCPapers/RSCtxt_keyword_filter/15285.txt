    , Accepted 19th April 2017First published on 21st April 2017AbstractA series of novel benzophenone-based small molecular cathode interfacial materials with different polar groups including hydroxyl groups, neutral amino groups, amino N-oxide, and sulfobetaine ions were synthesized for PTB7:PC71BM-based polymer solar cells between the active layer and Al electrode. The photovoltaic properties of the devices with these interfacial materials were studied. The differences in interface modification performance of hydroxyl and amino interfacial materials were investigated for the first time. The devices with a solution-processed amino N-oxide-based interlayer showed a PCE of 9.34% with the highest short-circuit current density and fill factor by reducing the series resistance and charge recombination compared to the devices with the other interlayers in this work.

Introduction
Lightweight and flexible polymer solar cells (PSCs) have shown bright commercial prospects with an increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% in recent years.1–4 The development of active layer materials widened the light absorption range and decreased the energy loss of charge transport resulting in the improvement of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the cells.5–8 Meanwhile, the progress of interfacial engineering optimized the electronic energy levels and reduced the charge recombination at the interface leading to the maximization of photovoltaic performance of PSCs.9–12
Interlayers including anode and cathode modified materials which are inserted between the active layer and electrodes have attracted the most attention in the interfacial engineering field of PSCs due to the variety of interfacial materials and because they effectively increase the PCEs.13–16 Anode interfacial materials with the high work function (WF) mainly are the commercial mixture of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), while the kinds of low WF cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) are more diverse with extensive research.17,18 Currently the universally concerned CIMs are water/alcohol-soluble organic materials including polymers and small molecules.19–21 The orthogonal solubility of these organic interlayers is suitable for fabricating low-cost and large-area multilayer devices by a wet process compared to the solvents of active layer materials.24 In general, water/alcohol-soluble CIMs structurally contain surfactant-like side groups, such as amino, phosphate, hydroxyl, carboxyl, anionic carboxyl, sulfonic and zwitterionic groups.19–22 Hereinto, amino-functional CIMs are the most popular owing to their excellent interface modification ability22,23 as the successful example of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) CIM with amino group has been widely used in PSCs as a successful example.1 Moreover, the neutral amine group can further transform into several derivatives, for example, quaternary ammonium ions with mobile counter-ions (e.g., Br, I, OH, etc.), sulfobetaine ions and amino N-oxide with immobile counter-ions.24–26 CIMs with mobile counter-ions which could migrate into the active layer may affect the long-term stability of devices.27 Hence, neutral and zwitterionic groups without mobile counter-ions are better choices for the structural design of CIMs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of simple small molecule CIMs with the benzophenone (BP) unit as a core bonding different polar groups. Small molecular CIMs possess good batch-to-batch reproducibility because they have precise molecular structures and high purities relative to polymeric ones. The CIMs, bis(4-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)phenyl)methanone (BPN), 2,2′-((carbonylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylethanamine oxide) (BPO), and 3,3′-((((carbonylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethylammonionediyl))bis(propane-1-sulfonate) (BPS), can be prepared through easy synthetic steps with low cost for their commercial applications. The polar groups included the hydroxyl, amino, amino N-oxide, and sulfobetaine ions. The relationship of different polar functionalities and photovoltaic properties was systematically studied. Besides, the insulating CIMs could transmit the photogenerated electrons by tunneling or thermionic injection and block the photogenerated holes back into the active layer.28,29 Thus, the insulating CIMs could decrease the charge recombination at the interface and effectively extract electrons to the electrode.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route of the CIMs is shown in Scheme 1. Their detailed synthetic procedure and characterization are given in the Experimental section. BPN was prepared by the reaction of bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanone (BPOH) and 2-dimethylaminoethyl chloride hydrochloride. After the oxidation of BPN by H2O2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF), BPO was finally obtained. BPS was synthesized by a ring-opening reaction of BPN and 1,3-propanesultone. The whole synthetic process is very simple with cheap raw materials. The target products as CIMs have good solubility in methanol which is beneficial to fabricating multilayer PSCs by a solution process. The molecules were identified by using 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra and mass spectra.

Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels
The UV-vis absorption spectra of CIMs in methanol solution and solid films are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that all CIMs have similar absorption curves owing to the same benzophenone-based backbone. The polar end groups only have slight influence on the optical properties of these molecules. Moreover, there is negligible absorption in the visible light region for these CIMs. In solution, BPOH showed the absorption peaks at 297 nm. Compared with BPOH, BPN, BPO and BPS displayed mild blue-shifted absorption spectra with the maximum absorption peaks at 293, 289 and 295 nm, respectively. In the solid film, BPOH increased a small shoulder peak at 317 nm, and the maximum absorption peak is blue-shifted to 275 nm, which may be caused by the hydrogen-bonding effect. According to the absorption onsets of the corresponding thin films, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of BPOH, BPN, BPO and BPS were estimated to be 3.26, 3.35, 3.44 and 3.44 eV, respectively. These CIMs could be considered as insulators due to their very large optical band gap and poor conductivity, though their molecular structures contain the conjugated backbone.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the CIMs in anhydrous acetonitrile with 0.1 M TBAPF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The energy levels of CIMs were calculated according to the empirical equation30,31 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), and LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71), respectively, where Eox and Ered are the onset potential in volts vs. Ag/Ag+. The HOMOs and LUMOs of BPOH, BPN, BPO and BPS were obtained to be −5.95/−2.91, −5.49/−2.53, −5.51/−2.56, and −5.61/−2.61 eV from the CV curves in Fig. 3a. The deeper HOMO and higher LUMO levels of these molecules than those of PTB7 donors suggested that they could act as efficient CIMs from the energy level alignment in Fig. 3b.

Photovoltaic properties
To illustrate the photovoltaic performance of these CIMs, PSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/CIM/Al (Fig. 1), where the active layer was a blend of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor (Fig. 1). The CIMs were dissolved in methanol to deposit the thin films on the active layers by spin-coating. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices and control devices under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark are shown in Fig. 4 and the device parameters are listed in Table 1. Compared with the control device without the methanol treatment and the CIMs (bare Al device), Voc, Jsc and FF of the methanol-treated device are effectively enhanced from 0.55 V to 0.76 V, from 14.30 mA cm−2 to 15.24 mA cm−2 and from 49.06% to 69.06%, respectively, and thus the PCE increased from 3.9% up to 7.97%, which is similar to that reported in the literature.24 The results prove that there are positive effects of methanol treatment on device performance originating from increasing the built-in voltage across the device and passivating the surface traps.32 When the CIMs between the active layer and the Al electrode were introduced into the devices, PSCs with BPN, BPO, BPS, and PFN showed the enhanced PCEs of 8.98%, 9.34%, 9.03%, and 8.35%, respectively. However, the PCE of the device with BPOH reduced to 7.78% compared with that of the methanol-treated device because of the low FF, indicating that BPOH is not a suitable CIM. The higher PCEs of the PSCs with BPN, BPO, and BPS than that of PFN prove that the synthesized molecules as CIMs have a bright application prospect for efficient PSCs. However, the BPO-based PSC exhibited the highest PCE of 9.34%, with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 17.09 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.58%. Compared to the control device, Voc, Jsc and FF of the PSCs with CIMs showed very evident improvement. Nevertheless, the Voc of the devices with CIMs is roughly identical to that of the methanol-treated ones, only both Jsc and FF are larger, in agreement with our previous work,33 since the methanol treatment plays a larger role in the change of Voc than the CIMs.

In the bulk-heterojunction PSCs, Voc is associated with the energy level difference between the HOMO of the donor material and the LUMO of the acceptor material.34,35 Moreover, Voc was also influenced by the difference between the WFs of the two electrodes.36 Therefore, inserting a CIM with polar groups, inducing the interfacial dipole, could decrease the WF of the cathode, resulting in a higher Voc.22 To obtain the interfacial dipole inducing WF change, thin films of the CIMs on Al electrodes were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 5a, the sequence of WF change is as follows: BPO (0.38 eV) > BPS (0.32 eV) > BPN (0.27 eV) > PFN (0.26 eV) > BPOH (0.09 eV). It is clear that the BPO modified Al electrode gave the largest change value of 0.38 eV, indicating the strongest dipole moment between BPO and the Al electrode, which could reduce the interfacial energy barrier and facilitate the electron transport and collection. BPOH barely changed the WF of the Al electrode, which illustrated that the amine group caused a larger interfacial dipole than the hydroxyl group for the same benzophenone moiety. As mentioned above, a larger interfacial dipole could result in higher Voc of PSCs. Thus, the BPO-based device with the largest dipole should possess the highest Voc. In fact, from Table 1, it was found that all devices with CIMs showed basically the same Voc as the methanol-treated ones.37–39 The interfacial dipole was also studied by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) which can measure the surface potential of the active layer. The surface potential difference (SPD) (the average value acquired from an area of 500 nm × 500 nm) of the tip and the top film of the active layer with different treatments is displayed in Fig. 5b. The SPD of the methanol-treated PTB7:PC71BM film is larger than that of the films with CIMs, suggesting that methanol treatment plays a greater influence on the Voc than the CIMs in this work. But, CIMs could effectively enhance the electron extraction and transport, and prevent electrode erosion to the active layer, giving rise to higher Jsc compared to that with only methanol treatment.

To investigate the influence of different interfacial treatments on the Jsc and FF, the J–V characteristics of all the devices were measured in the dark. The reverse bias leakage currents of the devices with BPN, BPO, and BPS were greatly suppressed in comparison to those of the other interface-treated devices and the bare Al control device in the range from −1 to 0 V in Fig. 4b. The inhibition of reverse currents could effectively improve the charge selectivity and obstruct the hole transport at the cathode interface, leading to a low charge recombination and high Jsc and FF.29,40 The BPOH-based device showed a higher reverse current than the methanol-treated device, resulting in a lower FF. At the forward bias from 0 to 2 V, the BPO-based device took on the highest injection current than the other ones, implying an efficient electron injection from the Al electrode. It can be seen that the devices with BPN, BPO, and BPS exhibited the ideal charge-selective injection and diode rectification effect compared with the bare Al control device from the entire dark current curves.29 The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices are the important parameters to evaluate the Jsc and FF. A decrease in Rs or an increase in Rsh is indispensable to realizing a high Jsc and FF.41,42 From Table 1, the devices with CIMs showed an obvious decrease of Rs and a significant enhancement of Rsh compared to the control device. The BPO-based device had the lowest Rs of 3.37 Ω cm2 and a high Rsh of 0.98 kΩ cm2, which was in accordance with the best Jsc and FF, suggesting that BPO could achieve the excellent ohmic contact at the interface. However, the BPOH-based device showed a high Rs of 5.87 Ω cm2 and a low Rsh of 0.46 kΩ cm2 against the charge transport and extraction with a large leakage current, thus limiting the improvement of Jsc and FF.
To further confirm the contribution of CIMs to Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all the devices are provided in Fig. 6. All PSCs show a similar and broad EQE curve in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. After introducing the CIMs, the EQE values of the devices increased to a different extent. Herein, the EQE values of the devices with BPN, BPO, and BPS higher than 70% were observed in the region of 400–700 nm, implying that BPN, BPO, and BPS as CIMs were beneficial to the charge transport and extraction at the interface. The BPOH-based device showed a relatively low EQE value.

The charge transport properties of the CIMs were studied by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.43 The architectures of hole-only and electron-only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/CIMs/MoOx/Al and ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/CIMs/Al, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities were calculated by using the J–V curves in the dark which were fit using the Mott–Gurney law, J = 9εrε0μV2/8L3. Here, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative permittivity of the material (around 3 for conjugated polymers), μ is the mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer (about 110 nm in this work). As shown in Fig. 7 and Table S2,† the control device with bare Al revealed a low hole mobility of 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 8.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility of the methanol-treated device increased to 4.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility slightly increased to 9.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The devices with BPN, BPO, BPS, and PFN containing amine groups showed higher carrier mobilities for both holes and electrons, of which the BPO-based device had the highest hole and electron mobilities, 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.75 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, ensuring the maximal Jsc. In comparison, the BPOH-based device with a hydroxyl group exhibited a low mobility of 9.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, illustrating that BPOH as the CIM did not effectively extract the electron and reduce the charge recombination.

To gain insights into the influence of surface morphology on the photovoltaic properties, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphologies of the PTB7:PC71BM films with or without CIMs. From Fig. 8, the pristine film displayed a smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.80 nm. The methanol-treated film did not show an obvious difference in its surface morphology with a similar RMS of 1.66 nm. BPOH, BPN, BPO, and BPS modified films showed the RMS values of 1.71, 1.52, 1.51, and 1.74 nm, respectively. The films with CIMs remain equally smooth without apparent surface reconstruction, suggesting that the CIMs possess uniform film-forming properties which are conducive to the large-area fabrication of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel benzophenone-based small molecular cathode interfacial materials with different polar groups were designed and synthesized for efficient single-junction PSCs. It can be found that the photovoltaic properties of the devices with BPN, BPO, and BPS containing amine groups are better than that of the device with BPOH comprising hydroxyl groups. The interface modification ability of BPO with amino N-oxide is stronger than that of BPN with a neutral amino group and BPS with sulfobetaine ions. The CIMs of BPN, BPO, and BPS between the active layer and the Al cathode could effectively reduce the interfacial energy barrier and extract the electrons, thus facilitating the electron transport and decreasing the charge recombination, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of the device performance. Notably, the solution-processed BPO-based device exhibited higher photovoltaic performance than the devices with other CIMs including PFN in this work, indicating promising application to fabricate low-cost and large-area PSCs. The detailed study on the structure–property relationships in this work provides valid design considerations for high-efficiency CIMs in organic photovoltaic devices.
