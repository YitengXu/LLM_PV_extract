    , Accepted 10th March 2016First published on 11th March 2016AbstractTo improve the catalytic activity of a material, it is critical to maximize the effective surface area by directly contacting the electrolyte. Nanowires are a promising building block for catalysts in electrochemical applications because of their large surface area. Nickel oxide (NiO) decoration was achieved by drop-casting a nickel-dissolved solution onto vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays with a carbon shell (SiNW/C). Based on the hybridization of the NiO and silicon nanowire arrays with a carbon shell this study aimed to achieve a synergic effect for the catalytic activity performance. This study demonstrated that the resulting nanomaterial exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and performs well as a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The compositions of the materials were examined using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Their micro- and nano-structures were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical activity toward I−/I3− was examined using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The obtained peak power conversion efficiency of the DSSC based on the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode was 9.49%, which was greater than that of the DSSC based on the Pt counter electrode.
Introduction
Carbon-based nanomaterials have received much attention and have been actively studied by many research groups for energy harvesting and storage applications because of their natural abundance, eco-friendliness, electrical conductivity, and catalytic activity with high stability. For example, Dai et al. developed sodium-ion batteries based on a three-dimensional anode consisting of N-doped graphene foam, which delivered a high initial reversible capacity and long-term retention.1 Kim et al. also demonstrated three-dimensional gel structures based on reduced graphene oxide, which were employed for high-performance electrical double layer supercapacitor electrodes.2
Recently, many research groups have focused intensive attention on replacing noble metal catalysts within dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with conducting polymer nanocomposites3–5 and carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes,6,7 carbon nanofibers,8 3D graphene,9,10 graphene nanoribbons,11 and graphene nanoplatelets.12,13 Defect-free graphene nanosheets have received much attention because of their unique properties such as their high surface area, efficient electrocatalytic activity, and good electrical conductivity. However, the performance of applications based on these nanosheets remains unsatisfactory because there are insufficient active sites for the reduction of I−/I3−.14,15 Kavan et al. reported that the device performance is dependent on the concentration of both defects and oxygen-containing functional groups.16 In addition to the graphitic domain, the defect sites may be important for any applications that require catalysts because charge carriers are required for transfer from the conducting carbon backbone to an electrolyte or any contacting medium. However, the existence of more defect sites could result in a lower grade of conductivity if a limited amount of graphitic carbon exists. Therefore, the presence of controlled reactive charge carrier sites may increase the catalytic activity without impairing the properties of the carbon. The use of metal, metal oxides, or metal complexes with carbon nanomaterials can synergically improve the catalytic performance, and there have been many previous reports on this subject. Du et al. reported that PtNi–MWCNT hybrid nanostructures functioned as a high performance and durable electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs).17 Dao et al. introduced graphene–NiO nanohybrids as counter electrodes for DSSCs, and the power conversion efficiency increased from 5.2% to 7.4%, both with and without NiO immobilization on the graphene.18 In addition, Gao et al. adopted NiO contained nanocomposites as counter electrodes and obtained improved performances with NiO-NF/MWCNT,19 NiO/AB,20 and RGO/MWCNTs/NiO.21
We report the synthesis of nickel-oxide-decorated silicon nanowires with carbon shells (NiO@SiNW/C) and their application as counter electrodes for DSSCs. A defective carbon shell on the large surface area of silicon nanowires offers a large amount of electrocatalytic sites. In addition, NiO is well known as a p-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap (3.5 eV) and exhibits superior electron-blocking properties in organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells.22 In the same manner, the NiO that is decorated on the carbon shell functions as an electron-blocking layer in this study. Here, we demonstrate that the NiO@SiNW/C exhibits sufficient electrocatalytic activity for the regeneration of I−/I3−.
Experimental
Fabrication of SiNWs
A commercially available, heavily doped n-Si wafer (0.001–0.003 Ω cm, Global Wafer) was cut into 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 pieces. The Si pieces were cleaned using ethanol, acetone, and 2-propanol, which was followed by UVO treatment for 30 min. The Si pieces were chemically etched in a mixture of etching solution containing 5 M HF and 0.002 M silver nitrate (AgNO3). Following etching for 15 min, silver dendrites that were present on the Si surface were removed in a diluted nitric acid (HNO3) solution for 15 min. Finally, the SiNW samples were rinsed using deionized water and acetone and subsequently dried in a flow of N2 gas.
Fabrication of NiO@SiNW/C
Carbon shell coating: the carbon shell coating on the surface of the SiNW arrays was fabricated using the thermal CVD method. Once the temperature reached approximately 1075 °C, 100 sccm of H2 and 100 sccm of CH4 were introduced into the reactor for 5 min, which was followed by cooling to room temperature under an Ar atmosphere.
NiO decoration: the NiO was decorated onto the surface of the carbon shell using the drop-casting method. First, 20 μL of 15 mM nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2) solution in ethanol was dropped onto the sample and dried naturally. The sample was subsequently heated to 450 °C for 30 min under an Ar atmosphere.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The FTO substrate was cleaned with a detergent solution, deionized water, a mixture of ethanol and acetone [1/1 (v/v)], and 2-propanol in an ultrasonic bath. This process was conducted for 10 min for each fluid, followed by UVO treatment for 15 min. Nanocrystalline TiO2 paste (20 nm, ENB-Korea) was doctor-bladed onto the substrate, which was subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. Following annealing, the TiO2-coated substrate was immersed in 0.3 mM (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] (termed N719) dye in a solution consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol [1/1 (v/v)] for 12 h at room temperature. A platinized counter electrode was used as a reference electrode, and it was prepared by coating 10 mM H2 PtCl6 solution in ethanol onto a clean FTO substrate. The electrode was subsequently annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The as-prepared working electrode and counter electrode were sandwiched together and sealed with a 50 μm-thick Surlyn film (DuPont). An electrolyte with the composition of 50 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine, 50 mM 1-hexyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 5 mM lithium iodide, and 2 mM iodine in acetonitrile was introduced into the cell.
Characterization and measurements
Both the micro- and nanostructures, in addition to the compositional information of SiNW, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C, were characterized using SEM (Hitachi S-4700) and TEM (JEOL, JEM-2100F) using EDS, XPS (ULVAC-PHI X-TOOL), and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab) equipment. The J–V curves were measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G (ABET Technology, LS 150 simulator). The electrochemical measurements, including EIS and CV, were performed on a Solartron Electrochemical Workstation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis of the NiO@SiNW/C on the Si substrate. The process involved the following steps: (a) a piece of the Si substrate was immersed in an etching solution consisting of diluted HF and Ag(NO)3 at room temperature; (b) silver dendrites on the surface of the Si substrate were dissolved in diluted HNO3, resulting in vertically aligned SiNW on the Si substrate; (c) a carbon shell was thermally deposited on the surface of the SiNW under a gas mixture of H2 and CH4 at 1075 °C, resulting in the production of SiNW/C; and (d) a drop of nickel solution was dropped on the SiNW/C, which was subsequently annealed at 450 °C under an Ar atmosphere, resulting in the fabrication of NiO@SiNW/C.

Fig. 2a–c present the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the NiO@SiNW/C on the Si substrate. The length and diameter of the SiNWs were approximately 5.5 μm and between 60–180 nm, respectively. Fig. 2a and b show that the SiNWs were vertically aligned, densely packed, and bundled because of their mutual attraction.23,24 The high-magnification SEM image confirms the presence of NiO nanoparticles decorated on the carbon shell (Fig. 2c, obtained from Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we can confirm that the NiO@SiNW/C consists of Si, C, Ni, and O, as demonstrated by the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) data shown in Fig. 2d and S1.†

Fig. 3a–c present the low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of a single NiO@SiNW/C and high-resolution TEM images for the detailed nanostructures of SiNW/C with and without the NiO decoration, respectively. As observed in the inset of Fig. 3b, the carbon shell on the surface of the SiNW grew along the wire's axis and was randomly oriented. The shell had an interdistance of 0.34 nm, which is consistent with that of the (002) planes of the graphitic layers. Based on the high-resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 3c, we confirmed the successful immobilization of the NiO decoration on the surface of the carbon shell; the lattice spacing of the NiO was 0.2 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sample prepared by dropping the nickel solution on bare glass exhibited characteristic peaks of (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes at 2θ degrees of 37.31°, 43.31°, and 62.91°, respectively, which is consistent with the standard pattern (JCPDS card no. 47-1049). Thus, both the FFT-ED pattern in the inset of Fig. 3c and the XRD pattern indicate that the planes of the NiO decorated on the carbon shell can be indexed as (200) planes.

We further investigated the functional groups and chemical oxidation states present in the NiO@SiNW/C using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis; the results are presented in Fig. 4. The XPS survey scan in Fig. 4a shows a comparison of the SiNW/C with and without NiO decoration. Peaks corresponding to Si 2p, C 1s, and O 1s for both the SiNW/C and NiO@SiNW/C were detected, and a peak corresponding to Ni 2p was also detected in the NiO@SiNW/C, which indicates that the NiO was decorated on the surface of the carbon shell.

The high-resolution XPS spectra corresponding to C 1s, Ni 2p3/2, and O 1s of NiO@SiNW/C are presented in Fig. 4b–d. In Fig. 4b, the main C 1s peak at 284.6 eV can be attributed to the graphite-like sp2 carbon (C–C), and the two small peaks at 285.5 eV and 288.5 eV reflect the different bonding structures, which could be attributed to C–O and COOH, respectively. In Fig. 4c, the XPS spectra for Ni 2p3/2 were de-convoluted into three peaks. The binding energies at 853.8 eV and 855.8 eV can be attributed to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively, and the shake-up satellite for Ni 2p3/2 can be observed at 861.0 eV. Because the peak area reflects the atomic concentration, we performed a numerical calculation based on curve fitting, and the Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio was determined to be 1.66. We can obtain information about the chemical oxidation states from the XPS spectra for O 1s. In Fig. 4d, the peaks at 529.7 eV and 531.5 eV can be attributed to divalent25,26 and trivalent25–28 NiO, specifically, nickel(II) oxide (NiO) and nickel(III) oxide (Ni2O3), respectively. Furthermore, the peak at 532.9 eV can be attributed to C–OH and/or C–O–C groups.29 The above explanation for the XPS analysis indicates that two nickel-oxide phases (NiO and Ni2O3) co-exist in the NiO@SiNW/C.
The NiO@SiNW/C electrode was directly applied as a counter electrode in the DSSCs. Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated with the FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C counter electrodes. The reference cell from the FTO/Pt exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.762 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.55 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.4% with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.62%. The DSSC fabricated with the SiNW/C exhibited a Voc of 0.744 V, Jsc of 17.68 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.9% with a η of 8.67%. The maximum performance was achieved with the NiO@SiNW/C, which showed a η of 9.49% with a Jsc of 18.52 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.759 V, and FF of 67.5%. These values compare well with the performances of other cells though other cell performances are, in fact, superior. The difference in the performance of NiO@SiNW/C is mainly due to the Jsc.

To understand the effect of current density on the electrochemical activity, an analysis of the cyclic voltammograms (CV) was conducted for the three different counter electrodes. The CV was measured with a Pt gauze and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and reference electrode, respectively.30 The electrochemical behavior of the counter electrodes with respect to the I−/I3− redox reaction was investigated by CV measurements to clarify the catalytic mechanisms of the FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C counter electrodes shown in Fig. 6. The oxidation and reduction peaks of the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode shift to higher and lower potentials, respectively, compared with those of the FTO/Pt counter electrode. Furthermore, the cathodic and anodic peak current densities of the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode are greater than the current densities of the FTO/Pt counter electrode. This finding implies that the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode exhibits superior electrochemical activity.30,31 Because the CV measurements are important to analyze the ion diffusivity and catalytic mechanism in the electrochemical system, an additional CV measurement (a symmetrical dummy cell) was performed with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As observed in Fig. 7, the current density of the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode was greater than that of the other electrodes, which indicates that the NiO@SiNW/C electrode exhibits superior catalytic properties of the I3− reduction compared with the other two electrodes.32

To investigate the interface characterization of the DSSCs fabricated with the three different counter electrodes, we employed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a circuit that has commonly been used in other studies.33,34Fig. 8 presents the Nyquist plot of the symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C electrodes. The first semicircle at high frequency was assigned to the charge transfer at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, whereas the second semicircle at low frequency was primarily associated with the Nernst diffusion of I3− within the electrolyte.35–38 The introduction of NiO on the surface of the SiNW arrays with a carbon shell induces an obvious improvement in the electrocatalytic activity, which can be directly determined by the first arc.18,30,32,39 While the charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the FTO/Pt was 0.46 Ω cm2, those for SiNW/C and NiO@SiNW/C were 0.23 and 0.07 Ω cm2. In addition, the SiNW/C and NiO@SiNW/C exhibited lower sheet resistance (Rs) values than that of the FTO/Pt, which indicates that the reduction in the Rct and Rs induced an increase in the Jsc. We also carried out the EIS measurements for DSSCs fabricated by FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C as counter electrodes, whose results are presented in Fig. S2.†

Before the wire was connected, the positive Ni2+ ions on the NiO decorated SiNW/C were deprived of electrons by a relatively negative carbon. Ni2+ and Ni3+ exhibited a coexistence state. However, when the wire was connected, the electrons along the wire were introduced into the SiNW/C. At this time, Ni3+ was in a standard state as Ni2+, and the received Ni3+ electrons transformed into Ni2+. These electrons were transported to the electrolyte to pass into the oxidation dyes, depending on the electrolyte. In other words, NiO decoration makes electrons to flow smoothly, indicating that the electroactive surface area is important in enhancing the device performance. The electroactive surface areas of the FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C electrodes were measured via CV in the redox couple of [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3−, and the curves and calculated results are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S2.† The calculation was performed using the Randles–Sevcik equation:ipeak = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cν1/2where n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction (n = 1 in [FeCN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3−), A is the electroactive surface area, D is the diffusion coefficient (6.70 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), C is the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]3− (5.0 × 10−6 mol cm−3), and ν is the scan rate. The electroactive surface areas of the FTO/Pt, SiNW/C, and NiO@SiNW/C electrodes were 2.132, 3.391, and 4.290 cm2, respectively. This trend is consistent with the trend of Jsc corresponding to each device.
Conclusion
NiO was decorated onto the surface of vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays with a carbon shell. Metal-assisted chemical etching was used for the preparation of the SiNW arrays, thermal chemical vapor deposition was used to prepare the carbon shell, and simple solution drop-casting was used for the decoration of the NiO. The fabricated material was employed as the counter electrode for the I−/I3− redox reaction in the DSSCs. The NiO decoration induces a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and an increase in the electroactive surface area, which leads to enhancement of the device performance through an increase in Jsc. Therefore, the DSSC based on the NiO@SiNW/C counter electrode achieved the greatest power conversion efficiency of 9.49%. This result is superior to those of the DSSCs based on both the FTO/Pt and SiNW/C counter electrodes (8.62% and 8.67%, respectively). Therefore, NiO@SiNW/C is a promising alternative to conventional Pt counter electrodes for DSSCs.
