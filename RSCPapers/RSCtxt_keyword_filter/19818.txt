    , Accepted 21st October 2019First published on 23rd October 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from massive ionic defects within perovskite layers, which are regarded as one of the major sources for charge recombination. Herein, a zinc porphyrin dye, YD2-o-C8, is utilized to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with enhanced film crystallinity and uniform morphology. We find that the YD2-o-C8 molecules with carboxylate groups are able to anchor with under-coordinated Pb2+ defects in the perovskite films which would suppress charge recombination. Moreover, perovskites with YD2-o-C8 form an appropriate energy level alignment which is found to be beneficial for both charge separation and extraction in n–i–p devices. Due to these improvements, the best performing device with YD2-o-C8 shows a PCE of 20.5% with reduced hysteresis, while the unmodified devices show a champion efficiency of 18.5%. Unencapsulated PSCs with YD2-o-C8 exhibit better ambient stability, retaining 93% of their initial PCE after storage in ambient air (25–40 °C, 20–40% relative humidity) under dark conditions for 30 days. Our findings present an effective method for defect passivation in perovskite solar cells using mature, low-cost dye molecules which would be favorable for future scale-up fabrication.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced sharp development and emerged as a superstar in the field of photovoltaics in recent years, by virtue of the superb optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, including high light absorption coefficients, tunable bandgaps and long carrier diffusion length.1–6 Continuous efforts have been dedicated to improving perovskite compositions and film morphology, which promote the certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.2%.7–13 However, perovskite films fabricated via the solution process tend to form large amounts of ionic defects, especially at the film surface and grain boundaries, having under-coordinated Pb2+ or lead clusters. These defects may not only act as major charge recombination centers but also accelerate moisture and oxygen induced degradation in PSCs, thus limiting device efficiency and stability.14,15 Therefore, it is important to reduce growth imperfections and develop effective defect passivation techniques for further improvement of device performances.
Among many effective approaches for defect passivation, organic molecules with functional groups have attracted much attention due to their versatility and ease of processing.16–20 Zuo et al. incorporated poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) into perovskites to reduce trap density by pyridine groups, which has been proved to be effective in inhibiting non-radiative recombination and enhancing device performance.21 Peng and co-workers inserted an ultrathin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film with abundant carbonyl groups at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface and found that under-coordinated Pb2+ defects could be significantly passivated which improved device efficiency and stability.22 Recently, Li et al. employed an organic dye molecule AQ310 with carboxyl groups as a passivator on the perovskite surface during the one-step anti-solvent dripping process.23 On this basis, Wu et al. carefully tailored the electron density distribution of organic molecules with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure to increase electron donating ability and coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+ cations, resulting in reduced trap states and non-radiative recombination.24 Apart from finding molecules with appropriate functional groups to optimize the passivation abilities, the charge transport properties of the molecules need to be considered as well since most of the organic molecules suffer from intrinsic electrical insulation.
Porphyrin derivatives, with high light absorption, excellent charge transport properties, and outstanding thermal stability, have recently been studied as additives and HTLs in PSCs.25–29 Chen et al. employed copper and zinc porphyrin complexes as HTLs in PSCs, realizing PCEs of 15.36% and 17.78%, respectively.26 Cao and his colleagues introduced tetra-ammonium zinc phthalocyanine and europium porphyrin complexes into methylammonium lead triiodide, which could form two-dimensional perovskites at the grain boundaries (GBs) of the three-dimensional polycrystalline perovskite film to passivate the local defects, thus improving the device performance and stability.27,28 Significantly, with cobalt porphyrin compounds as HTLs, the devices represented remarkable thermal stability.27 Recently, they further embedded monoammonium zinc porphyrin compounds into perovskite films with the blade-coating process. Owing to the improved perovskite crystallinity and uniformity as well as suppressed film defects, the corresponding devices reached a champion efficiency exceeding 20% with significantly enhanced long-term stability.29 Hence, it is essential and feasible to comprehensively utilize the merits of multi-functional porphyrins with defect passivation and charge transport capability for high-performance PSCs.
In this study, we demonstrate a facile method which incorporates a small amount of functional zinc porphyrin dye molecule (YD2-o-C8) into perovskite films for device performance enhancement. YD2-o-C8 has been widely recognized as an excellent light harvester in dye sensitized solar cells with a typical D–π–A structure, as shown in Fig. 1a.30,31 Perovskite films with YD2-o-C8 molecules (Y-PVSK) show higher film crystallinity, more uniform morphology and enhanced light absorption, in contrast to the control perovskite (C-PVSK). In addition, Y-PVSK films exhibit an appropriate energy level alignment, which enables self-driven charge separation and extraction. Compared to C-PVSK films, Y-PVSK films show a lower trap density by reducing under-coordinated Pb2+ defects. Y-PVSK PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 20.5%, which is significantly higher than that of the control devices (18.5%). Without dye modification, the PCE of unencapsulated C-PVSK devices dropped to 74% of the initial value after storage in ambient air (25–40 °C, 20–40% relative humidity) under dark conditions for 30 days. In contrast, Y-PVSK PSCs show a substantially improved stability, retaining 93% of their original PCEs after aging.

Results and discussion
We incorporated YD2-o-C8 into perovskite films via an in situ solvent deposition process. In detail, we dissolved the YD2-o-C8 molecules in chlorobenzene and dropped it onto the triple-cation CsFAMA perovskite precursor film during the anti-solvent treatment process. To check if the YD2-o-C8 molecules exist in the crystallized perovskite films, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on the perovskite films with and without YD2-o-C8. As shown in Fig. 1b, a typical Zn 2p3/2 peak appears at 1021.7 eV, indicating the presence of YD2-o-C8 in the Y-PVSK film.32Fig. 1c shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the complete PSCs. Denser and trimmer perovskite crystal domains were observed with the YD2-o-C8 treatment. We also observed that the crystal domains grew larger along the vertical direction, i.e. fewer grain boundaries buried in perovskite films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement results displayed in Fig. 1d suggest that the Y-PVSK film has a flatter film surface compared to the C-PVSK film. These improvements can be an indicator of improved crystal growth of the perovskite film.33Fig. 1e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the corresponding as-crystallized perovskite films. We observed that the Y-PVSK film showed stronger perovskite diffraction peaks (marked with diamond) than the C-PVSK film, indicating improved crystal growth, which is in line with the observation of the enhanced morphology.
To investigate the effect of YD2-o-C8 incorporation on the charge transfer, we first studied the energy alignment of perovskite and charge transport layers (CTLs) as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The energy level of YD2-o-C8 has been well studied previously and it typically shows a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.21 eV and a band gap of 2.13 eV.34,35 Due to this, such kinds of small molecules incorporated by the anti-solvent dripping method tend to distribute gradiently inside perovskites as reported and we speculated a better energy level alignment formed with the changed amount of YD2-o-C8.23,36,37 To identify if YD2-o-C8 affected the energy level alignment, we conducted photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements, as shown in Fig. 2b. The valence bands of C-PVSK and Y-PVSK are −5.51 and −5.37 eV, respectively. This could remarkably favor the self-driven charge separation and reduce the energy barrier, thus accelerating the charge transfer from perovskites to the CTLs. We measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and UV-vis absorption spectra of the corresponding perovskite films (Fig. 2c). As a result, the marginally enhanced light absorption in the full-range wavelength could be attributed to the improved film quality and slightly increased film thickness. Also, the presence of dye molecules slightly increased the light absorption at a wavelength below 500 nm (Fig. S1†) and caused a distinct PL quenching simultaneously, indicating more effective light utilization and hole extraction owing to the better energy alignment induced by YD2-o-C8 incorporation. We further performed time-resolved PL measurements and fitted the decay with a bi-exponential decay function (Fig. 2d) y = y0 + ∑Aiexp(−t/τi)(1)where Ai is the decay amplitude and τi represents the decay lifetime.38 The fitting results are listed in Table S1.† C-PVSK and Y-PVSK deposited on glass substrates yielded an average decay lifetime of 465.0 and 317.9 ns, respectively. The obviously shortened lifetime verifies the facilitated hole extraction, leading to improved device photovoltaic performance.

It is believed that the carboxylate group in the D–π–A structured molecule manifests high electron density, which is favorable for coordination with the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations.24 We employed density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the charge density distribution of YD2-o-C8. As shown in Fig. S2,† a high charge density occurs at the terminal carboxylate group, which well supports the aforementioned notion. XPS was performed to figure out the defect passivation behavior at the surface of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3a, Pb 4f peaks shifted to a lower binding energy after YD2-o-C8 incorporation due to the increased surrounding electron cloud density. Interestingly, two additional peaks located at 136.73 and 141.46 eV appeared in C-PVSK, which could be ascribed to the metallic Pb (Pb0) arisen from under-coordinated Pb2+ defects.39,40 We observed that the two peaks almost disappeared in Y-PVSK as a result of the reduced dangling Pb2+ cations via coordination reaction with YD2-o-C8. Moreover, we performed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements to verify the coordination function of the carboxylate group, as shown in Fig. S3.† The stretching vibration of the CO bond in pure YD2-o-C8 was observed at 1683 cm−1, which is consistent with the previous work.41 The CO vibration shifted to a lower wavenumber (1652 cm−1) in YD2-o-C8 complexed with PbI2, indicating that the carboxylate group could interact with Pb2+ and further passivate ionic defects in the perovskite film. We further estimated the bulk trap density of the corresponding perovskite films by fabricating hole-only devices with the structure of FTO/NiO/C-PVSK or Y-PVSK/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 3b displays the dark current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only devices with different perovskite films. The typical J–V curve can be divided into three regions, including an ohmic region at low bias, a trap-filling limited (TFL) region at intermediate bias and a trap-free space charge limit current (SCLC) region.42 The trap density within perovskite films can be reckoned from the trap-filling limited voltage (VTFL), which is the onset voltage of the TFL region, according to the following equation Ntrap = 2ε0εrVTFL/qL2(2)where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the relative dielectric constant of perovskites, q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The trap density was calculated to be 1.12 × 1016 cm−3 and 3.44 × 1015 cm−3 for the C-PVSK and Y-PVSK, respectively. The reduced trap density can be attributed to the satisfactory anchoring of under-coordinated lead ions and the improved perovskite crystallization quality. Based on the above characterization, we proposed a passivation mode of dye molecules as illustrated in Fig. 3c, where the under-coordinated lead cations would be passivated by the carboxylate group in the YD2-o-C8 dye molecule.

To evaluate the effect of YD2-o-C8 incorporation on device performance, we fabricated planar perovskite solar cells with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/C-PVSK or Y-PVSK/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. S4† shows the photograph of YD2-o-C8 dissolved in CB with different concentrations and the J–V curves of the corresponding PSCs from the same batch. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† As we increased the concentration of dye molecules from 0 mg mL−1 to 1 mg mL−1, the PCE of the corresponding PSCs first increased and then decreased with the best device efficiency obtained at a concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1. Fig. 4a shows J–V curves of the champion PSCs based on C-PVSK and Y-PVSK under one sun illumination and Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The Y-PVSK based PSCs achieved a best PCE of 20.5 (20.0)% with a Jsc of 24.4 (24.3) mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.05 (1.04) V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.80 (0.79) under reverse (forward) scan, while the champion PCE of C-PVSK based PSCs was 18.5 (17.6)% along with a Jsc of 23.3 (23.0) mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 (1.02) V and a FF of 0.77 (0.75) under reverse (forward) scan. The remarkably enhanced Jsc with YD2-o-C8 could be ascribed to the increased light harvesting and improved charge separation and extraction. Moreover, the higher Voc and FF of Y-PVSK based devices could be originated from suppressed charge recombination through defect passivation. We defined the hysteresis index (HI index) to reflect the hysteresis degree of the corresponding devices. As listed in Table 1, the PSC based on Y-PVSK showed a reduced HI index of 2.44% compared to that of the C-PVSK based PSC (4.86%). The reduced J–V hysteresis could be due to the enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge accumulation. Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. An obvious enhancement in EQE was observed when comparing the Y-PVSK based device with the control device, which was consistent with the increased light absorption and expedited charge transfer. To ascertain the reliability of photovoltaic performance, we measured the stabilized photocurrent densities and steady-state PCE of the champion devices under a constant bias (Vmpp) at the maximum power output point, as displayed in Fig. 4c. The Vmpp for the C-PVSK and Y-PVSK based devices was 0.884 and 0.904 V, respectively. The Y-PVSK based PSC obtained a steady photocurrent density of 22.1 mA cm−2, resulting in a stabilized PCE of 20.0%. However, the C-PVSK based device achieved a stabilized PCE of 18.1% with a photocurrent density of 20.5 mA cm−2. The results derived from the maximum power point tracking show the same trend with those from J–V measurements, indicating that the YD-o-C8 treatment could substantially enhance the device performance.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to provide insight into charge transfer and recombination processes in PSCs. Fig. 4d displays Nyquist plots of devices with C-PVSK and Y-PVSK measured at a bias of −1.0 V under dark conditions. The relevant equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. S5,† which consists of the series resistance (Rs) and contact resistance (Rco) in the high-frequency region, and recombination resistance (Rrec) in the low-frequency region in EIS, respectively.43 Table S3† lists the fitting results employing the equivalent circuit. To point out, the semicircle at high frequency representing the charge transfer at ETL/HTL layers was too small to be identified in the Nyquist plots measured in the dark.44 As a consequence, only one typical semicircle at low frequency can be observed from Nyquist plots, which is related to the interfacial recombination resistance. The Rrec value increased from 734.7 Ω to 1136.0 Ω after the incorporation of YD-o-C8. The higher Rrec for the Y-PVSK based PSC indicates a lower charge recombination rate, thus contributing to the improved Voc and FF.
To assess the long term stability of the perovskite films and devices, we conducted comparative measurements on the stability of unencapsulated perovskite films and devices by storage in ambient air with a relative humidity (RH) of 20–40% under dark conditions for 30 days. XRD was performed to monitor the degradation process. As shown in Fig. 5a, the peak of the PbI2 phase at 12.8° (marked with circle) for Y-PVSK rose at a slower rate than that for C-PVSK, suggesting suppressed perovskite decomposition with YD2-o-C8. We measured the contact angle of the perovskite surface with water. As shown in Fig. S6,† the Y-PVSK film exhibited a larger contact angle with water than C-PVSK. We therefore attributed the improved stability to the multiple functions including passivation and hydrophobic effect supplied by YD2-o-C8 with a unique D–π–A structure, in which the terminal carboxylate group could anchor with the ionic defects while the hydrophobic alkyl group can prevent perovskite crystals from permeation of water molecules as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5a. We further tested the stability of the complete PSCs in ambient air without encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 5b. The PCE of the C-PVSK based PSCs dropped to 74% of the original value after aging for 30 days in ambient air. In sharp contrast, the PCE of the Y-PVSK based device retained 93% of their initial values under the same conditions, suggesting that Y-PVSK based PSCs exhibited superior stability.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate an effective strategy for enhancing perovskite device performance using the Zn porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8. The YD2-o-C8 treatment improves perovskite film crystallization, enhances light absorption and enables an appropriate energy alignment for better charge extraction. DFT calculation suggests that YD2-o-C8 possesses a carboxylate group at one end of the molecule with high charge density, which could coordinate/passivate with the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations inside perovskite crystals, thus reducing non-radiative recombination. At the other end of the YD2-o-C8 molecule, there exists a hydrophobic alkyl group which improves the moisture stability of the perovskite films. PSCs with YD2-o-C8 show a best PCE of 20.5% with reduced hysteresis. Unencapsulated Y-PVSK devices retain 93% of their initial PCE after storage in ambient air for 30 days, while the PCE of C-PVSK based devices degrades to 74% after aging. This work offers a novel insight to combine multi-functional organic dyes with perovskites to fabricate high-quality perovskite films for efficient and stable PSCs.
