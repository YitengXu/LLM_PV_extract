    , Accepted 12th May 2021First published on 14th May 2021AbstractThe bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect of conventional ferroelectric (FE) materials has sparked a great deal of interest due to anomalous above-bandgap photovoltage. However, large bandgaps and weak photocurrents remain longstanding challenges for FE PV materials in practical applications. To address these issues, we propose a new defect-engineering strategy and demonstrate it on a narrow bandgap centrosymmetric material, BiNbO4 (BNO): the BPV effect is introduced into BNO by tuning the defect amounts, then a defect-modified homojunction structure is constructed to enhance the BPV effect. This defect engineering strategy enables synergetic effects, e.g., enhanced light absorption, FE-like depolarization field and interfacial polarization. This homojunction structure results in two-fold promotion of photovoltage and ten-fold promotion of photocurrent, compared to the defect-modified BNO sample. We believe this new strategy will break through limitations in traditional material design and pave a novel route to future multifunctional materials, especially high performance BPV materials.
1. Introduction
The bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect has received renewed attention in energy conversion due to anomalous above-bandgap photovoltage and the potential to overcome the Schottky–Queisser limit.1–8 Such advantages of BPV generally arise from the non-centrosymmetric structure and controllable spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric (FE) materials.1–3,8 Nevertheless, most conventional FE oxides with a perovskite structure have a wide bandgap (Eg: ∼3–4 eV) and are good electronic insulators, which results in low absorption of solar energy and low photocurrent output.7,8 To increase the utilization of solar energy, bandgap engineering through defect formation or cationic order tailoring becomes one of the most appealing topics, and the bandgap of FE materials can be reduced to as low as 1.4 eV.6,9–13 Unfortunately, the introduction of foreign ions or defects may impair FE properties, and subsequently weaken the built-in field intensity and the ability to separate charge carriers. In addition, the combination of multiple layers, with the capability of absorbing light of various wavelengths is attractive for the improvement of light harvesting without modifying the structure of materials.5,14–17 Up to now, using these approaches, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can reach ∼4% in BiMnO3-based composite films, and ∼8% in the Bi2FeCrO6 multilayer structure.5,18
Among these approaches, defect engineering, especially introducing oxygen vacancies in FE materials to reduce the bandgap and stabilize the depolarization field, is under scrutiny. Although it is believed that oxygen vacancies will increase the leakage current and disrupt the ferroelectricity,19,20 proper control of the oxygen vacancies via doping or quenching under different atmospheres would still enhance PV effects in FE materials.21–25 It is reported that the accumulation of oxygen vacancies at FE/electrode interfaces will bend the band structure and thereby tune photoelectronic properties, while the sub bandgap levels induced by oxygen vacancies can broaden the absorption of solar spectrum.21,22 Defects can essentially affect the internal separation fields. Recent research reveals that the appearance of oxygen vacancies impacts the formation and movement of ferroelectric domains, thereby influencing polarization–electric field (P–E) hysteresis loops.26,27 Moreover, the formation of defect dipoles due to increasing oxygen vacancies can induce depolarization fields in some centrosymmetric materials.28 Indeed, recent investigation of SrTiO3 and our recent results shed light on the possibility to realize stable internal fields in centrosymmetric materials via defect chemistry, and thus some non-FE semiconductors with narrow bandgap may also be candidates for achieving a high-performance BPV effect.29–31
The effective separation of photo-excited charge carriers is one of the most critical factors to produce high performance optoelectronic devices.32 This requires the construction of the contacts that can selectively adsorb and deliver photo-excited charges, which can be significantly facilitated by electric fields.32 Unlike FE materials containing depolarization fields and domain walls, the electric fields in centrosymmetric semiconductors are commonly built via constructing p–n junctions or metal/semiconductor heterojunctions.33–36 Among these devices, p–n homojunctions, which use a single semiconductor treated to have different electrical properties on either side of the junction, play an important role in photoelectronics, especially in PV devices.37–40 Compared with heterojunctions, homojunctions have negligible lattice mismatching and minimal defects at the interface, favoring the transportation of photoexcited charge carriers. To fabricate homojunction structures, the band structure of part of the semiconductor is modified, commonly by doping the aliovalent ions.38,41 However, instead of inducing foreign ions, intrinsic defects, e.g., oxygen/metal vacancies, are also capable of tuning the electrical properties of the semiconductors.42–44
Inspired by the abovementioned defect engineering techniques, this study brings forth a new route to significantly improve PV performance in narrow bandgap materials by combining defect induced depolarization fields with interfacial built-in fields. BiNbO4 (BNO) is selected as the model to demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy because of its attractive structure and properties45–47 At ambient conditions, bulk BNO shows the orthorhombic stibiotantalite-like structure (α-BNO, space group: Pnna, a = 4.980 Å, b = 11.709 Å, c = 5.675 Å), which typically consists of layers formed by vertex sharing distorted NbO6 octahedra along the (001) planes.45,48,49 Within one layer, Nb5+ displaces along the a-direction while in the adjacent layer, Nb5+ ions displace in an antiparallel direction with the same amplitude. The antipolar structure initially forbids the BPV effect, whereas some investigations report that ferroelectricity in this material can be achieved by reducing particle sizes or inducing defect structures.45 In addition, α-BNO shows an excellent oxidization capability with a narrow bandgap (∼2.6 eV), reported as a potential candidate for solar water splitting.50 Taking advantage of these features, we first constructed a stable depolarization field in BNO thin films and then fabricated a homojunction via tailoring the defect distribution. In this structure, the defect-induced and interfacial polarizations have synergic contributions to the PV performance, resulting in a remarkable promotion of both photovoltage and photocurrent simultaneously. This work provides a new route to not only realize the FE-BPV-like effect in narrow bandgap centrosymmetric materials via defect engineering, but also to simultaneously construct a homojunction to further enhance the PV performance through modifying the defect levels. We believe the proposed strategy will contribute significantly to the ongoing development of novel PV materials.
2. Results and discussion
Characterization of BNO thin films
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns collected from BNO thin films show that the BNO films are phase pure and highly crystalline. The XRD patterns can be indexed by the α-BiNbO4 structure and the out-of-plane preferential orientation is along the [121]* direction (Fig. 1a). No remarkable shift of the major peaks of the BNO thin films was observed when annealed under different atmospheres, indicating that the annealing atmosphere does not induce a substantial change in crystal structure or lattice parameters. The cross-section TEM images of the BNO thin film annealed at O2 for 60 minutes (BNO–O2) (Fig. 1b, top) and at N2 for 60 minutes (BNO–N2) (Fig. 1b, bottom) indicate that the interfaces between BNO and LaNiO3 (LNO) and between LNO and Y2O3 are sharp and well-defined, and the thicknesses of Y2O3, LNO and BNO are 30 nm, 10 nm, and 185 nm, respectively. The cross-section HRTEM images as well as SAED patterns of the BNO–O2 and BNO–N2 samples further confirm the [121]* preferential orientation of the BNO layers along the out-of-plane direction on the LNO/Y2O3 structure (Fig. 1c and d). More details on the crystal structure and morphologies of BNO thin films can be found in Note 1, ESI.†

Defect-induced ferroelectricity in BNO thin films
To verify the ferroelectricity of the as-grown BNO samples, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is employed to study the FE domains and switching behaviors of these thin films. Although no well-defined domain patterns are observed in the pristine thin films (Fig. S1c and d†), significant and stable out-of-plane phase contrasts are found on the BNO–N2 sample after poling with a ±15 V bias in a region of 2 μm × 1 μm (Fig. 2a, bottom), in which the bright and dark regions correspond to polarization up and polarization down, respectively. These phase contrasts are quite stable without notable change for 5–6 hours. This is comparable with the domain retention time of the BiFeO3 films, a typical FE thin film, reported in our previous report,51 and also in a good agreement with the results observed in the small written domains of thin FE crystals.52 In addition, the local switching spectroscopy PFM (SS-PFM) of BNO–N2 sample presents 180° phase switching and butterfly-like amplitude, further indicating its switchable surface polarization (Fig. S2a†). However, for BNO–O2 thin film, the tip with the same bias cannot write stable domain patterns (Fig. 2a, top) and no switching behaviors can be obtained during the SS-PFM experiment (Fig. S2b†), which suggests that no switchable polarization can be detected in BNO–O2 thin film.

Considering that local FE switching can be associated with many factors such as defects and bulk flexoelectricity, the P–E hysteresis loops are measured for both samples to confirm ferroelectric polarisation response. Typical saturated ferroelectric behavior for the BNO–N2 thin film is revealed from the P–E loops shown in Fig. 2b (orange line), in which the remnant polarization (Pr) is ∼9.7 μC cm−2 with the coercive electric field (Ec) ∼250 kV cm−1. The Pr exhibits little decay after 1 × 109 switching cycles (∼9.5 μC cm−2), but drops significantly to ∼3.7 μC cm−2 after 2 × 109 cycles (Fig. S3†), indicating the polarization fatigue of the BNO–N2 thin film. Although the cycles for the polarization fatigue in the BNO–N2 thin film are not as many as the BiFeO3 films,53 the higher applied electric field (±333 kV cm−1) and the comparable switching cycles to some typical FE films (e.g., PZT54) imply the FE-like behaviors in this thin film. In contrast, the BNO–O2 thin film exhibits a linear P–E loop with a lossy dielectric feature (Fig. 2b, green line). These PFM and P–E hysteresis results unambiguously indicate the room-temperature ferroelectricity in the BNO–N2 sample, while no ferroelectricity is detected in the BNO–O2 films. It is evident that the main reason for the ferroelectric-like behavior in BNO–N2 is related to the annealing atmosphere. As heat-treatment of oxides in N2 commonly generates oxygen vacancies ,22,44 we suggest that the ferroelectricity in BNO–N2 films may stem from the  and the associated defect structures. As the annealing time will impact the concentration of defects, we further examine the P–E hysteresis loops of BNO thin films with different N2 annealing time. It is found that 5 minute N2 heat-treatment induces nonlinear P–E behaviour. The Pr and induced polarization at 350 kV cm−1 are ∼0.16 μC cm−2 and 1 μC cm−2, respectively (Fig. S4a†). On extending the annealing time to 30 minutes, the slim P–E loop swells up, and Pr increases to 5 μC cm−2 with Ec reaching ∼85 kV cm−1 (Fig. S4a†). 60 minute N2 treatment further increases the Pr and Ec values of the BNO–N2 thin films, and a square-shaped P–E hysteresis loop is obtained (Fig. 2, orange line). The above results unambiguously indicate that FE-like behaviors of BNO can be attained by the N2 annealing treatment and the profile of the P–E hysteresis loops is dependent on the annealing time.
It is known that oxygen-poor atmospheres favour the formation of oxygen vacancies in BiNbO4.55 To further investigate the local defect structures, Raman (Fig. S5†), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques (Fig. 3a–d, S6 and S7†) were used. Detailed analysis of the spectra are elucidated in the Note 2, ESI.†26,27 It was found that: (1) the Raman active modes of BNO–N2 thin films broaden and shift slightly to higher wavenumber as compared to BNO–O2 thin films consistent with the introduction of defects (Fig. S5†); (2) XPS spectra of BNO–N2 thin films resolve peak splitting in Bi 4f and Nb 3d regions which is absent in corresponding spectra of BNO–O2 thin films, consistent with multiple Bi3+ and Nd5+ environments (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†); XPS spectra also resolve multiple O 1s signals consistent with the emergence of defect sites in BNO–N2; and (3) importantly, extending the N2 annealing time progressively increases the relative intensities of the XPS peaks in O 1s, Bi 4f and Nb 3d bands of the BNO–N2 samples that can be attributed to defects (Fig. 3a–d, S6, S7 and Table S1†). Using the O 1s peak at 531.6 eV as a marker for oxygen-deficient regions of the film and the O 1s peak located at 530.1 eV a marker for lattice oxygen,56 the development of defects as a function the N2 annealing time can be obtained (Fig. 3e). A linear relationship is observed demonstrating the N2 heat-treatment induces oxygen vacancies and their concentration increases with extending the annealing time. XPS measurements also confirm that N2 treatment does not produced Nb4+ ions (see Note 2 in ESI†). To compensate the charges induced by the donor defect , an acceptor defect other than Nb4+ must form. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the donor defect  and the acceptor defect  have the lowest energy of formation in an oxygen deficient environment.55 As a result, we deduce that  is the acceptor defect compensating the positive charges induced by . The formation of these two types of defects is further supported by the systematic variations of Raman and XPS spectra (Note 2, ESI†).

Fig. 4 propose a possible defect structure for the BNO–N2 sample. In this structural model, the Bi3+ ion in the Bi1 site substitutes the Nb5+ ion. Since no Nb4+ is formed due to the absence of equatorial O (see Note 2 in ESI†), the loss of one apical O in this BiO6 octahedron generates the oxygen vacancies. As Shown in Fig. 4b, when the apical O ion disappears, the Bi ions at the Bi2 sites are affected and become strongly underbonded, moving away, while the Bi ions in the Bi3 sites are still stable in the lattice. These three distinctive Bi sites are consistent with the Bi 4f XPS peaks (Fig. S6†). Similarly, the  surrounded by four oxygen ions will then influence the Nb5+ ions in their vicinity, causing their coordination environments to differ from the lattice Nb5+ ions, in accordance with the split Nb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks shown in Fig. S7.†

Overall, the oxygen vacancies are positively charged donors and tend to combine with the cation defects in the vicinity, forming defect dipoles centered around  defect dipoles. The appearance of oxygen vacancies will impact the surrounding cationic positions, thereby introducing defect dipoles and nonlinear P–E behaviors.28 When the N2 annealing time is short, the low-concentration defect dipoles are mostly isolated point defects, which distribute randomly and are uncorrelated with each other. Therefore, low remnant polarization and small coercive field are obtained (Fig. S4a,† red line).26,27 With extending the N2 annealing time, more oxygen vacancies are generated and some of them will aggregate to correlated clusters during the annealing process.27 The aggregation of oxygen vacancies and associated metal ions defects will further change the local structures, resulting in the enhanced non-linear P–E relationship. Therefore, with increasing the N2 annealing time, i.e., increasing the concentration of oxygen vacancies, both the FE-like behavior and the stability of written domains of the BNO samples are enhanced.
PV performance of BNO–N2 and BNO–O2 thin films
It is well-known that an effective PV process relies on two factors – generation and separation of electron–hole pairs. The former process requires the narrow bandgap of the PV materials and the latter factor can be effectively improved by a stable separation field.31 To further investigate the bandgaps of the defect-engineered BNO, the UV-visible absorption spectra were measured for both BNO–N2 and BNO–O2 thin films (Fig. 5a). The bandgap is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 5b) and the values of both samples are around 2.7 eV. However, the UV/Vis absorption spectra show that the BNO–N2 thin film exhibits an enhanced absorption mainly in the ultraviolet light region. Such an enhancement of the light absorption can be ascribed to the sub-band states originated from the oxygen vacancies. The photoelectronic properties of BNO thin films are shown in Fig. 5c and d. The BNO–O2 does not exhibit FE-like behavior so that the separation of the photo-generated electron/holes relies on the built-in field created from asymmetric electrodes. On selecting a high work function metal as the top electrode, e.g., ϕAu ∼5.1 eV, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs in BNO–O2 thin films can be separated (Fig. 5c, inset).57,58 It is apparent in Fig. 5c that when the sample is exposed to AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is ∼0.4 V, and the short circuit current density (JSC) is ∼3 μA cm−2. The experimental VOC is lower than the intensity of the built-in field (ϕAu − ϕLNO = 0.7 eV), which may result from the disordered grain boundaries in the samples prompting recombination and thus reducing the photovoltage.59 In addition, non-transparent gold electrodes block most of the illumination and thus a low number of electron–hole pairs are generated, resulting in low photocurrent density. Replacing the gold electrode by a transparent ITO electrode might be expected to enhance the accessibility of photons, but no PV effects is attained in ITO/BNO–O2/LNO because of the almost identical work function for the two electrodes (ITO: 4.5 eV and LNO: 4.4 eV).60 Taking advantage of the FE-like behavior in BNO–N2, the PV effect can be obtained by using the electrodes with a similar work function (Fig. 5d, inset). The I–V curves of an ITO/BNO–N2/LNO device present typical negative diode behavior both in the dark and under illumination after negative poling, indicating that stable depolarization fields are formed after removing the external field. Since the photo-generated electron–hole pairs can be separated by the depolarization fields, PV effects with VOC ∼0.45 V and JSC ∼20 μA cm−2 are detected.

The thin films are poled under 10 V for 10 minutes. 
Construction of homojunction
Despite the effective charge separation by the depolarization field, BNO–N2 thin films exhibit a weak response to illumination due to fast recombination. Most of the photo-generated charges are annihilated at recombination centers formed by the oxygen vacancies or other defects before accessing the electrodes.61 Feasible strategies to overcome this issue include: (1) enhance the separation field, and (2) saturate the recombination centers to increase the lifetime of photo-generated charges.16,62 Previous calculation indicates that BNO exhibits n-type conductivity after treatment in an oxygen-deficient environment, while p-type conductivity is dominant when BNO is annealed in an oxygen-rich environment.55 Inspired by these results, a homojunction can be constructed by combing BNO–N2 with BNO–O2 (Fig. 6a). In this structure, an extra built-in field will be established at the BNO–N2/BNO–O2 interface. Therefore, the overall separation field intensity can be enhanced, and thus the PV performance will be further improved. The cross-section imaged by TEM and AFM shows that there is no evident boundary between the BNO–N2 and BNO–O2 layers (Fig. 6b and c top panel). Nevertheless, the intensive surface potential (SP) contrast across the BNO–N2/BNO–O2 interface indicates that there is a built-in field pointing from BNO–N2 layer towards BNO–O2 layer in this structure (Fig. 6c, middle and bottom).63 These results illustrate that the homojunction is constructed between the two BNO layers heat-treated in different atmospheres, forming an interfacial built-in potential. Fig. 6d reveals the photovoltage and photocurrent density of the as-grown homojunction under AM 1.5 G illumination. Notwithstanding the decrease of the remnant polarization of this structure—probably owing to the introduction of the non-ferroelectric BNO–O2 layer (Fig. S9a†)—both the photovoltage and photocurrent density are much higher than those of the non-homojunction BNO structures (VOCca. 0.85 V, JSCca. 200 μA cm−2). The time dependence of JSC with regards to turning the light on or off after negative poling further indicates that although the JSC remains steadily when the light is switched on and drops to zero as soon as the light is off in all these three structures (including BNO–N2, BNO–O2, or BNO–N2/BNO–O2), the JSC of the ITO/BNO–N2/BNO–O2/LNO homojunction is 10 times and 70 times higher than that of the ITO/BNO–N2/LNO and the Au/BNO–O2/LNO devices, respectively (Fig. 6e). Therefore, we suggest that enhanced PV performance can be achieved via the construction of homojunction, in which light absorber, internal field from polar structure and interfacial built-in potential contribute cooperatively to the PV process.

(e) Time dependence of zero-bias photocurrent for the BNO–O2, BNO–N2 (negative poling) and BNO–N2/BNO–O2 structures (negative poling) with the AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination switching on and off. The poling voltage is 10 V, and the poling time is 10 minutes. 
To illustrate the mechanism of the improved PV performance, the movement of the photo-generated charges and the direction of the internal fields in the ITO/BNO–N2/BNO–O2/LNO device are schematically shown in Fig. 6a. Herein, both the BNO–O2 layer and BNO–N2 layer can absorb solar photons and generate electron–hole pairs. Since the BNO–O2 layer can be considered as the p-type semiconductor while the BNO–N2 layer as n-type due to the difference of defect type and concentration,55 band alignment differences between these two layers are expected, and thus the built-in field (Ebi) forming at their interfaces will cause an additional band bending (Fig. 6d, inset).63 Such a built-in field is capable of enhancing the charge separation and transporting the electrons into the BNO–N2 layer. When the BNO–N2 layer is poled negatively (the direction of the external electric field is towards the top electrode), the depolarization field (Ed) is of the same direction as the built-in field, and thus the internal field (Ei) is equal to Ebi + Ed, by which the photo-generated electrons and holes will be further separated and driven to electrodes, forming photocurrent. Note that Ei would be attenuated when Ebi and Ed are opposite given that the BNO–N2 layer is poled positively (the direction of the external electric field is towards the bottom electrode), inducing a drop in both VOC and JSC (Fig. S9b†). To verify the effects of the depolarization field and the built-in field on PV effects, we examine the PV effect in the sample without poling. These PV effects, therefore, should be ascribed to the contribution of built-in field only. The VOC is estimated to be ∼0.15 V, which is in line with the SP mapping shown in Fig. 6c, and the JSCca. 60 μA cm−2 (Fig. S9c†). In terms of Ei = Ebi + Ed relation, when the ITO/BNO–N2/BNO–O2/LNO device is poled negatively, the photovoltage is ∼0.85 V, in which the Ebi is ∼0.15 V, and accordingly, Ed should be ∼0.7 V. While poling this device positively, the switching-direction Ed will cause the total internal field, Ei = 0.15–0.7 V = −0.55 V, which is consistent with the value of the photovoltage shown in Fig. S9b.† Moreover, as the photocurrent in the cases of both positive and negative poling in the ITO/BNO–N2/BNO–O2/LNO devices (Fig. 6d and S8b†) are higher than that generated in the ITO/BNO–N2/LNO structure (Fig. 5d), we ascribe the enhancing photocurrent in the homojunction structure (regardless of the poling direction) to the absorption of more solar illumination. Therefore, the homojunction combining both a light harvesting BNO–O2 layer and a ferroelectric BNO–N2 layer will significantly enhance the PV effects.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we demonstrate an enhanced PV phenomenon in the polycrystalline BNO thin films through a defect engineering strategy, by which a synergy between the depolarization field, the interfacial built-in field and light absorbers is realized to ensure not only the presence of strong and stable internal separation fields but also sufficient light absorption, thereby achieving both pronounced photovoltage and photocurrent. Although the crystal structure of the BNO thin films annealed under different atmospheres is analogous in terms of XRD and HRTEM results, FE-like behavior is observed in the BNO–N2 thin film, while no ferroelectricity can be detected in the BNO–O2 sample. With the help of Raman and XPS techniques, we further proposed that the FE-like behavior in the BNO–N2 thin film is associated with oxygen vacancies and defect dipoles such as . Prolonging the N2 annealing increases concentrations of the defects, especially oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the remnant polarization and coercive field extracted from P–E hysteresis loops. Taking advantage of this FE-like behavior, it is found that BNO–N2 thin films show the BPV effect. Additionally, BNO–O2 and BNO–N2 films can form a homojunction with interfacial fields. In the constructed ITO/BNO–N2/BNO–O2/LNO device, the BNO layers enable sufficient light absorption and electron–hole pair generation, while the defect-induced depolarization field in the BNO–N2 layer and the built-in field at the BNO–N2/BNO–O2 interface work cooperatively for the charge separation. The photovoltage and photocurrent of this device in turn increases 2 times and 10 times, respectively, compared to single layer BNO–N2 devices. As a result, we believe that this research will not only enrich the investigation of defect engineering but also offer an approach for enhancing the PV effects in semiconductors by introducing defect-induced depolarization fields and constructing defect-modified homojunctions. More importantly, the fact that centrosymmetric structure will be broken with increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies may pave a new route to produce FE-like behavior in centrosymmetric materials, expanding the candidate pools for BPV materials.
4. Experimental section
In this study, the BNO/LaNiO3 (LNO)/Y2O3/Si structure was fabricated using both the pulsed electron deposition (PED) and the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) techniques. An excimer laser (KrF, λ = 248 nm) was used to ablate Y2O3 and LNO targets. The laser repetition rate was set at 5 Hz, and the target-to-substrate distance was kept as 5 cm. The synthesis of the 30 nm Y2O3 layer and the 10 nm LNO layer is reported in our previous work.51 The BNO film was deposited on the LNO/Y2O3/Si substrate by PED. A pulsed electron beam source (PEBS 2.0 Neocera Inc) was used to deposit the BNO films. The distance between the electron gun and the target was 1 cm, and the pulsed electron source was operated at 18 kV with a pulsed repetition rate of 5 Hz. The deposition time was 60 minutes. The oxygen pressure was 150 mTorr, and the substrate was preheated to 450 °C. The as-grown thin films were annealed at 600 °C for 60 minutes under 400 Torr O2/N2. To fabricate the BNO–N2/BNO–O2 homojunction, the first BNO layer was deposited on the LNO/Y2O3/Si substrate by PED with the same conditions mentioned above. The first BNO layer was annealed at 600 °C for 60 minutes under 400 Torr O2. Next, the second BNO layer was deposited on the BNO–O2 layer following the same conditions as above. The second BNO layer was then annealed at 600 °C for 40 minutes under 400 Torr N2. The indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes (thickness ∼50 nm) were deposited at 500 °C and 10 mTorr of oxygen by PLD. The deposition time was 30 minutes. Gold electrodes (∼300 nm) were sputtered on the top of BNO thin films at room temperature.
Characterization
The structures of the BNO thin-film samples were investigated with an X-ray diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical, Empyrean) using Cu-Kα radiation. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer using the diffuse reflection method (Varian Cary 5E). A Helios Nanolab 600 FIB system was utilized to prepare cross-section samples. Prior to the cross-section imaging, a ∼2 μm protection layer of Pt was deposited on the thin films. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were obtained on JEOL-2100F. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) characterizations were performed under ambient conditions on a commercial AFM system (Cypher, Asylum Research), which has integrated signal generator and lock-in amplifier modules. Olympus AC240TM conductive silicon probes (Tip coating, 5 nm/20 nm Ti/Pt; calibrated force constant, k ∼1.8 N m−1) were used. The contact imaging set-points were around 100 nN. For PFM domain imaging, off contact-resonance AC probing signals were used (typically 300 kHz, amplitude VAC = 300 mV) to excite surface oscillations. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops were recorded using a ferroelectric analyzer (aixACCT TF2000). The current–voltage curves of the sample were measured using Solar Simulator model #SS150 equipped with a potentiostat source Autolab PGSTAT302N. The light intensity was calibrated at one Sun (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) using the certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell. The micro-Raman spectra were collected at room temperature (293 K) using confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy (Jobin-Yvon HR800) in backscattering geometry. The excitation used a 632.8 nm line from a He–Ne laser. The laser power was ∼10 W with a spot size ∼1 mm2. The backscattered light was dispersed using a 600 lines/mm grating and collected by a CCD array detector. This configuration allowed the recording of spectra with a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1. Chemical valence states and local defect structures were studied by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCA-LAB250Xi).
