    , Accepted 28th February 2011First published on 3rd June 2011AbstractA new series of organic dyes containing a triarylamine donor group, a triarylene-linked bridging moiety, and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group were synthesized through a simple procedure in high yields. A selected set of substituents were added onto the phenyl group ortho to the cyanoacrylic acid in order to examine their influences on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their photochemical behaviors were examined under AM1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2). A typical device made with a compound containing a -CF3 substituent (PSP-CF3) displayed a short-circuit current (Jsc) 15.16 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) 0.68 V, a fill factor (ff) 0.68, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.0% and a maximal monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) 78%. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were analyzed with the aid of a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) model with the B3LYP functional. Their HOMO and LUMO energy levels are verified by both electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a promising alternative energy source.1 The ruthenium-based complexes, i.e., N3, N719, and black dye reported by Michael Grätzel, have achieved maximal power conversion efficiencies over 11%.2 Compared with metallic materials, organic dyes are indispensable due to their advantages of environmental friendliness, higher structural flexibility, lower cost, easier preparation and purification, etc. A wide variety of organic dyes have been reported in the literature including the derivatives of coumarin,3 indoline,4 cyanine,5 merocyanine,6 hemicyanine,7 perylene,8 dithiensilole,9 and porphyrin,10etc., whilst most of them exhibited energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency in a range 5∼9%. In our previous studies we have developed a series of organic dipolar dyes composed of an aromatic amine donor (D) and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor (A), which were separated by a linearly connected phenylene-thiophenylene-phenylene bridge (PSP). The performance of DSSCs made with these dyes can achieve a maximal quantum efficiency of 7%, considerably close to that of N719.11 To further improve their performance and also to investigate their structure/performance relationship, certain selected substitutions on their triarylene bridge are made.12 Five new organic dyes, i.e., PSP–H, PSP–F, PSP-CN, PSP-CF3 and PSP-OCH3 (Chart 1) were synthesized in this regard. The tuning of electron flow by the addition of a substituent can be viewed from two sides, i.e., the presence of an electron-withdrawing group located on the acceptor side can stabilize the charge-separated excited state; whilst an electron-donating group may improve the charge injection efficiency toward the TiO2 conducting electrode. Nevertheless, the absorption wavelength will be red-shifted with respect to the parent structure, as a result of more extended electronic resonance induced by the substituents. A broader absorption range reveals that more photons can be harvested by DSSCs.13 In all the five structures, the central thiophenylene moiety is replaced by a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophylene (EDOT) group in order to enhance the absorbance of the dyes.14,15 Their device characteristics made with these dyes are examined in this report.

Experimental
General information
All reactions and manipulations were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled freshly according to standard procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker (AV 400/AV 500 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3, THF-d8, and DMSO-d6 as a solvent. Chemical shifts are reported in δ scale downfield from the peak for tetramethylsilane. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Jasco-550 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra and photoluminescence quantum yield were obtained from a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. The emission spectra in solutions were measured in spectral grade solvent by a 90° angle detection, and those of thin film were recorded by front-face detection. The redox potentials were measured by using cyclic voltammetry on a CHI 620 analyzer. All measurements were carried out in THF solutions containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte at ambient condition after purging 10 min with N2. The conventional three electrode configuration was employed, which consists of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a VG70-250S mass spectrometer.
All chemicals, i.e., o-tolunitrile, 1,4-dibromo-2-fluorobenzene, 4-bromo-2-methoxyphenylmethanol, n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane), trans-dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II), N,N-dimethylformamide, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, zinc powder, N-bromosuccinimide, trimethylamine N-oxide, pyridinium chlorochromate, cyanoacetic acid, ammonium acetate, and triethyl amine, were purchased from ACROS, Merck, Lancaster, TCI, Sigma-Aldrich, separately, and purified while necessary before use. The synthetic procedures of compound 1 is shown in ESI. Chromatographic separations were carried out by using silica gel from Merk, Kieselgel si 60 (40–63 μm).
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, transmission <90% in the visible, sheet resistance 8 Ω square−1), titania-oxide pastes of Ti-Nanoxide T/SP and Ti-Nanoxide R/SP were purchased from Solaronix. A thin film of TiO2 (16∼18 μm thick) was coated on a 0.25 cm2 FTO glass substrate. It was immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M dye sensitizers for at least 12 h, then rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and dried. Another piece of FTO with sputtering 100 nm thick Pt was used as a counter electrode. The active area was controlled at a dimension of 0.25 cm2 by adhering a 60 μm thick polyester tape on the Pt electrode. The photocathode was placed on top of the counter electrode and was tightly clipped together to form a cell. Electrolyte was then injected into the seam between two electrodes. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. Devices made of a commercial dye N719 under the same condition (3 × 10−4 M, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) was used as a reference. The cell parameters were obtained under an incident light with intensity 100 mW cm−2 measured by a thermopile probe (Oriel 71964), which was generated by a 300 W Xe lamp (Oriel 6258) passing through a AM 1.5 filter (Oriel 81088). The current–voltage parameters of DSSCs were recorded by a potentiostat/galvanostat model CHI650B (CH Instruments, USA). The light intensity was further calibrated by an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150) and adjusted to be 1.0 sun. The monochromatic quantum efficiency was recorded through a monochromator (Oriel 74100) at short circuit condition.

Quantum chemistry computations
The structure of dyes was optimized by using a B3LYP/6-31G* hybrid functional. For the excited states, a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional was employed. All analyses were performed under Q-Chem 3.0 software. The frontier orbital plots of HOMO and LUMO were drawn using Gaussian 03.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the dyes
Five organic dyes, i.e., PSP–H, PSP–F, PSP-CN, PSP-CF3 and PSP-OCH3 were synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1. All compounds are modified at the ortho-position of the phenylene group near the A terminal. All syntheses utilized 2-substituted 4-bromobeznaldehydes as the key intermediates. For example, the preparation of 5-bromo-2-formylbenzonitrile (1) from o-cyanotoluene took 5 steps with a total yield of 21% (ESI†).16 4-Bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde (2) was prepared by the formylation of 1,4-dibromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene with n-BuLi and DMF. 4-Bromo-2-methoxybenzaldehyde (3) was made form (4-bromo-2-methoxy)phenylmethanol by oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate.17 The presence of a formyl group in these compounds was verified using 1H NMR by a downfield signal at δ 10.30∼10.38 ppm. The donor moiety was synthesized from N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, onto which the third aromatic group was added by a Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction with the aid of Pd(OAc)2.18 The resulting triarylamine was then attached onto a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) group by a Stille coupling reaction. The reaction was repeated again by attaching it to a 2-substituted 4-bromobenzaldehyde to elongate the chain length. The final step was a Knoevenagel condensation between compound 4 and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate.19 This procedure was quite successful for all the products except PSP-CN, for which an apparent decarboxylation happened as a side reaction.20 The synthesis of PSP-CN was finally achieved in low yield by using triethylamine as a base under a refluxed temperature in toluene. All products were confirmed by their corresponding spectroscopic characteristics.

Absorption spectra
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of organic dyes in THF solution are displayed in Fig. 1 and the parameters are listed in Table 1. Each of these compounds exhibits three major absorption bands, appearing at 250–260 nm, 330–340 nm, and 440∼460 nm, respectively. The first two bands were assigned to localized aromatic π–π* transitions, and the last one to a charge-transfer (CT) transition. The high intensity of this band is well-correlated with the large value of oscillator strength, which was calculated by a TDDFT/B3LYP modelling study (Table 1). The molar extinction coefficients of both PSP–H and PSP-OCH3 were quite high, e.g. exceeding 4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 1), while those possessing electron withdrawing groups, i.e., PSP–F and PSP-CF3, displayed slightly lower values. It is noteworthy that compound PSP-CN exhibited the lowest absorptivity (ε = 1.06 × 104 M−1 cm−1), although its longest wavelength tailed to a region comparable to those of PSP–F and PSP-CF3. A longer wavelength absorption is favorable to the performance of DSSCs, as more photons with lower energy can be harvested.

 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of organic dyes in THF. 
The absorption spectra of all dyes on the surface of TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2. All spectra were blue-shifted about 30–36 nm with respect to those in the solution, except PSP-CN which seemed to be red-shifted. The blue-shift on TiO2 is a common phenomenon for most organic dyes, that is regarded as the result of a strong interaction between the dye and the semiconductor surface. A similar trend has been demonstrated while the dyes were deprotonated in the presence of base. Upon deprotonation the electron density in the cyanoacrylate moiety is increased so that the energy level of the LUMO is elevated, consequently the band gap of CT transition is enlarged. However, such an effect is partially annihilated by the presence of a CN group at the ortho-position across a phenyl ring, which attracts the extra electron density from the cyanoacrylate through an efficient π-conjugation (Fig. 4).

Electrochemical properties
The oxidation potentials (Eox), corresponding to the HOMO level of dyes, were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in THF solutions, and the results were shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The introduction of an electron-withdrawing group in π-bridge lowered the HOMO level, thus increased the oxidation potential. The potential energy of ionization decreased slightly in the order of PSP-CN (0.75) > PSP–F (0.72) ≈ PSP-CF3 (0.72) > PSP–H (0.71) > PSP-OCH3 (0.67). The HOMO levels thus obtained were within the range 0.75∼0.67 eV, which were sufficiently lower than that of electrolyte pair I−/I3− (ca. 0.40 V), thus ensured a smooth electron flow from the electrolyte to the dyes. The LUMO levels were estimated by the values of Eox and the 0-0 band gaps, which was estimated at the intersection of absorption and emission spectra. A trend appeared as PSP-CN (−1.61) > PSP-CF3 (−1.63) > PSP–H (−1.68) ≈ PSP–F (−1.68) > N-PSP (−1.70) > PSP-OCH3 (−1.72). All these levels were considerably higher than the conductive band level of TiO2 (ca. −0.5 V).
Computational analysis
The structures of the dyes were analyzed using a B3LYP/6-31G* hybrid functional for full geometrical optimization. In the ground state all compounds possess a nearly co-planar conformation to achieve a maximal extent of π-delocalization. Compared to the parent structure of N-PSP, the addition of a dioxane ring in the EDOT moiety did not increase the dihedral angle between the two adjacent aryl groups (Fig. 4). The EDOT moieties may have a function of preventing the formation of aggregates on the surface of TiO2.21
The charge distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals are depicted in Fig. 5. As shown in the graphs, the HOMO level is localized mostly at the triarylamine (D) moiety, while the LUMO is mostly at the cyanoacrylic acid (A). The electron distributions of both D and A are heavily coupled with the orbitals in the central triarylene bridge (B). The geometry of the bridges must have a critical influence on the transition probability of photo-excitation. The calculated potential energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs compared well with the experimental values of Eox and ELUMO estimated by CV. The electron-withdrawing substituents on the acceptor moiety should have an effect of stabilizing the charge-separated species upon photo-excitation. As indicated in Fig. 5, the electron density on the LUMOs of PSP–F and PSP-CN can spread more widely onto the substituents, cf. that of PSP–H.
 Fig. 5  Computed frontier orbitals of dyes. The left graphs are the HOMOs, and the right ones are the LUMOs. 
The transition probability was estimated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional, and the calculated oscillator strength (f) is shown in Table 1. The f values for the lowest energy transitions, i.e., the CT transitions, are all relatively high, e.g., ranging from 0.72∼0.99. The results are consistent with the absorptivity measured in solutions, except for PSP-CN. The absorption coefficient (ε) of all dyes measured by experiment was significantly lower than expected (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) plots of DSSCs fabricated with these dyes, along with that of N719 for comparison, are shown in Fig. 6. The detailed parameters, i.e., short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and solar-to-electrical photocurrent density (η) measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Table 2. All dyes with an EDOT group exhibit a higher values of Jsc (15.2∼17.0) than the parent compound N-PSP without it (Jsc = 15.0), presumably due to a more extended delocalization. The absorption range of the former is apparently longer than that of the latter (Fig. 2). The only exception is PSP-CN, which yielded a low value for the short circuit current, i.e., 8.3 mA cm−2 only about half of the others. It was mainly ascribed to its low molar absorptivity extinction coefficient, as indicated in Fig. 1 and Table 1. All the new dyes, except PSP-CN, performed better that N-PSP exhibiting a higher quantum efficiency.

It is known that reducing the amount of dark current can retard charge recombination, thus increase the efficiency of the solar cells.22 The dark currents were found to be in the order of PSP-CN > PSP-OCH3 > PSP–H > PSP–F > PSP-CF3 as shown in the bottom of Fig. 6. The amount of open current voltage (Voc) can be benefited by reducing the charge recombination rate in the nanocrystallite/dye/redox electrolyte interface. The order of open current voltages matched with the trend of reducing dark current, i.e., PSP-CN (0.58) < PSP-OCH3 (0.65) < PSP–H = PSP–F (0.68) < PSP-CF3 (0.69). It is noteworthy that the fill factor increased with the strength of the electron-withdrawing ability, particularly in the cases of PSP-CN and PSP-CF3 (ff = 0.68∼0.70).
Among all the devices, except PSP-CN, the ones with strong electron-withdrawing groups performed the best, e.g., the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency for PSP–F was 6.87%, and that for PSP-CF3 was 7.00%. Their IPCE values in the region of 380∼620 nm were all >50% (Fig. 7). For the abnormal behaviour of PSP-CN, it may be compared to previous reports revealing that a strong electron-withdrawing cyano group located at the proximity of the acceptor might jeopardise the injection of electrons toward the conducting electrode.20 The best performance in this work was observed for the device made with PSP-CF3, which exhibited a Jsc value 15.16 mA cm−2, Voc value of 0.68 V, and ff value of 0.68. The overall conversion efficiency (η) was estimated to be 7.0%, which was quite comparable to the well-known ruthenium complex N-719. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was higher than 70% in the range 420∼540 nm. It is worth noting that in a recent report, Chou and Chi has found that adding a fluorine substituent at the meta position to the cyanoacrylate can induce a profound effect on the quantum efficiency of DSSC.12b In our comparative analysis, the trifluoromethyl substituent (PSP-CF3) works even better then the fluorine (PSP–F).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to further elucidate the photovoltaic properties. Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra for the DSSCs made with TiO2 electrodes, dipped with the PSP-series sensitizers under a forward bias of −0.73 V in the dark. Three semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots. The first one is attributed to the high-frequency peak (>102 Hz) is ascribed to the charge-transfer process at the interfaces between the redox couple and the platinized counter electrode. The middle-frequency peak (in the 10–100 Hz region) is related to the transport process of the injected electrons at the interfaces between TiO2 and the electrolyte/dye, and the low frequency one (<1 Hz) is associated with the Nernst diffusion of I3− within the electrolyte (EIS Bode plots in ESI).23
 Fig. 8  EIS Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance of the DSSCs made with the dyes at −0.73 V bias in the dark. 
The charge recombination resistance at the TiO2 surface (Rrec), it can be deduced by fitting curves from a range of intermediate frequencies using Z-view software. It is related to the charge recombination rate, e.g., a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and therefore a larger dark current (Fig. 6). The radius of the biggest semicircle increases in the order PSP-CN (11.3 ohm) < PSP-OCH3 (12.0 ohm) < PSP–H (13.3 ohm) < PSP–F (18.0 ohm) < PSP-CF3 (20.7 ohm). This trend appears to be consistent with both the lower Voc values of PSP-CN (0.58 V) and PSP-OCH3 (0.65 V), as well as the higher values of PSP–F (0.69 V) and PSP-CF3 (0.68 V). It seems reasonable to conclude that the better performance of the latter can be ascribed to a reduced rate of charge recombination, which led to higher values of Voc.
Conclusions
The presence of a substituent on the phenyl group ortho to the cyanoacrylate acceptor of the dyes can effectively elongate the absorption wavelength. A wider wavelength of absorption is favourable to the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. The compound PSP-OCH3 thus exhibited the highest Jsc value of all. However, an electron-withdrawing substituent was capable of stabilizing the negative charge developed in the CT state, and thus reduced the rate of charge recombination. Such an effect can be evidenced by the high Voc values of both compounds PSP–F and PSP-CF3. A combined effect of the above two factors resulted in the highest ff value for PSP-CF3, which yielded the best performance with a η value 7.0%. The replacement of the central thiophene group of N-PSP by an EDOT group have also promoted slightly the performance of devices, presumably due to the prevention of aggregation on the surface of TiO2.
An exception was found for compound PSP-CN, which exhibited a low absorption on the CT transition which led to a small value of Jsc (8.32). Its overall quantum efficiency was found to be 3.37% only, despite its high ff factor (0.70). The low absorptivity may be ascribed to the electronic configuration in the ground state, which does not favour a CT transition from the D (triarylamine) to A (cyanoacrylate). Shifting the CN group to other site of the phenyl group in future designs may alter the selection rule of the CT transition.
