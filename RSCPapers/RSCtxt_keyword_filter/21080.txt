    , Accepted 30th June 2015First published on 6th July 2015AbstractWurtzite Cu3ZnInSnS6 (CZITS) nanodisks were successfully synthesized according to rational design via a hot-injection method. Their suitable band gap and photoresponsive behavior indicate great potential application in solar cells. The structure of CZITS transforms to a tetragonal type after annealing, which is accompanied by grain growth.
Colloidal metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals (CMCSNs) with precisely controlled compositions and morphologies have shown fascinating physical and chemical properties,1 which have potential to impact the fields of energy,2 environment3 and healthcare.4 In particular II–VI, I–III–VI2 and I2–II–IV–VI4 type CMCSNs have received much attention in the photovoltaic field due to their excellent electrical and optical properties. II–VI group compounds (CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe and ZnTe), which serve as window or absorber layers, have shown significant applications in quantum dot sensitized solar cells5 and inorganic semiconductor thin film solar cells.6 Relative to binary chalcogenides, ternary I–III–VI2 (I = Cu; III = Al, Ga, In; VI = S, Se) group compounds can be looked on as the substitution of group I and III atoms for group II atoms, with the octet rule obeyed (see Fig. 1). These semiconductor materials have suitable direct band gaps and high optical coefficients.7–9 The CuIn(Ga)Se2 (CIGS) has currently found photovoltaics market applications.10 Quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) can be regarded as further splitting ternary CuInS2 by replacing the two In(III) atoms with one Zn(II) atom and one Sn(IV) atom (see Fig. 1). The sequential cation cross-substitutions from binary II–VI to ternary I–III–VI2 to quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4 chalcogenides have been brought about perhaps because of the similar ionic sizes of the Zn2+ (0.60 Å), In3+ (0.62 Å), Cu+ (0.60 Å), Sn4+ (0.55 Å)11 and their coordination models. So it can be predicted that through cation mutations, various series of new CMCSNs may be prepared by using different combinations of these metal cations and chalcogenides. Recently, quaternary I–II–III–VI3 nanocrystals of CuZnInS312,13 and I–III3–IV–VI5 nanocrystals of Cu3InSnS514 have been successfully synthesized. Following the cation cross-substitution concept, the most complex form of the combination of these four metal cations, quinary Cu3ZnInSnS6, also could be obtained. Yet it is still an unexplored field for materials science.
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the process of producing quinary Cu3ZnInSnS6, starting from a II–VI parent compound of ZnS. 
Ternary I–III–VI2 and quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4 nanocrystals are of particular interest in photovoltaic applications because of their high energy conversion efficiency, high absorption coefficient, and low toxicity.7–10,15–21 Up to now, the highest solar power conversion efficiencies reported are 21.7% for CIGS7 and 12.6% for CZTSSe.15 However, it has been noted that the limited annual production of the scarce elements In and Ga could restrict the production capacity of CIGS photovoltaics. Though the CZTS consists of earth abundant elements, the power conversion efficiency leaves much to be desired. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design new materials that are facile to synthesize and optimal for solar cells. One of the primary reasons for inferior photovoltaic properties of CZTS-based devices is their lower open circuit voltage (VOC). The facile formation of charged defect complexes, such as [CuZn− + ZnCu+], is suggested as the main factor to cause potential fluctuations and therefore limit the VOC of CZTS devices.22,23 The charged defect complexes that compensate for each other result in low majority carrier (hole) concentration consequently. Thus, increasing the absorber p-type doping concentration would enhance the VOC of CZTS solar cells, which may be addressed by incorporating the element In into CZTS to generate InSn defects owing to the formation energies of InSn defects that are likely to be low. Most recently, Kim et al. applied the In2S3/CdS double emitter on CZTSSe solar cells to reduce the VOC deficit (defined as Eg/q–VOC where Eg is the band gap and q is the electron charge) effectively.24 Indium from the In2S3 diffused into the CdS as well as into the CZTSSe during annealing. By incorporating In, carrier densities in the cells were effectively increased which resulted in an increase in VOC by up to 20% and higher cell efficiency of up to 12.7%. Kuo and co-workers also reported that upon doping of In3+ ions into Cu2ZnSnSe4 bulks, the carrier concentration, mobility, and the resulting electrical conductivity increased greatly compared to the undoped one.25 Here we report the synthesis of I3–II–III–IV–VI6 nanodisks of Cu3ZnInSnS6 (CZITS) for the first time. The CZITS nanodisks have a suitable band gap of 1.48 eV and outstanding photoresponsive behaviour, indicating that this kind of new nanocrystal has the potential to be applied in high-efficiency, yet low-cost photovoltaic devices. Moreover, after annealing at 400 °C, these hexagonal nanodisks coalesce into larger grains accompanied by phase transformation, which has a significant importance in the improvement of the performance of solar cell materials with microstructures.
Experimentally, CZITS nanodisks were synthesized by hot injection of a solution of thiourea in oleylamine (OLA) into the mixture solution of OLA and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) containing CuCl, ZnCl2, InCl3 and SnCl2 at 220 °C (see the ESI† for experimental details). DDT is usually considered to be efficient in minimizing the reactivity difference between the precursors, thereby being favourable for the stoichiometric CMCSNs.26 In this work, compositionally controlled Cu3ZnInSnS6 nanodisks were obtained only when a mixture of OLA and DDT was chosen as the solvent and capping ligand of cationic precursors simultaneously. The overall element ratios of the final products, as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), are 2.88:1.13:1:1.01:6.37, close to the Cu3ZnInSnS6 formula stoichiometry, which indicate that the reactivity of these metal precursors is well balanced. We also note a small relative increase in the sulphur content, which is likely due to the thiol capping ligands that passivate the nanodisk surface. When only OLA without DDT was used as a surfactant, the element ratios of the final nanocrystals were 3.78:1:1.86:1.02:7.93, a rather large off-stoichiometry. The composition of stoichiometric CZITS nanodisks was also studied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to be Cu2.91Zn1In1.01Sn1.01S6.27 (Fig. S2†), which approximately agreed with the results of ICP. To identify the element distribution of the as-synthesized CZITS nanodisks, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDS elemental mapping was performed for CZITS nanodisks. The results shown in Fig. S3† reveal that the five elements Cu, Zn, In, Sn and S are evenly distributed among the nanodisks and there is no apparent element separation or aggregation, indicating that the distribution of all the five elements is very homogeneous within the nanodisks.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of typical as-synthesized CZITS nanocrystal samples are shown in Fig. 2. Rietveld refinements (red line in Fig. 2) are utilized to further analyze the crystal structure and lattice parameters of CZITS nanocrystals based on the experimental XRD patterns using the hexagonal wurtzite phase as a structure model. Similar to wurtzite CIS and CZTS,27,28 wurtzite CZITS can be considered to be a derivative of wurtzite ZnS (see Fig. S4 and relevant simulation details in the ESI†). As displayed in Fig. 2, the refined and experimental patterns are well matched, which confirms that the as-prepared CZITS nanocrystals have hexagonal symmetry with the P63mc space group. The lattice parameters were calculated as: a = b = 3.8674 Å and c = 6.3552 Å, with convergence factors x2 = 2.747, Rwp = 2.00%, and Rp = 1.54%. The XRD patterns of the CZITS nanocrystals synthesized under different reaction conditions by the same method reveal that CZITS nanocrystals have a similar hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure irrespective of the ratio of the precursors, reaction temperature, injection temperature, and DDT used as the surfactant (Fig. S6–S9†). To study the formation mechanism of CZITS, the growth process was monitored as a function of reaction time at 240 °C. XRD patterns (Fig. S10 in the ESI†) reveal that at a shorter reaction time (t = 1 min), two-component nanostructures consisting of Cu1.94S and wurtzite CZITS are formed. At a reaction time of 30 min, only wurtzite CZITS nanocrystals are observed, indicating that the Cu1.94S portion has been converted to wurtzite CZITS. Prolonging the reaction time from 30 to 60 min, the structure of CZITS nanocrystals is still wurtzite. Therefore, it may be speculated that the growth mechanism of CZITS involves the nucleation of Cu1.94S, followed by diffusion of In3+, Sn4+ and Zn2+ into Cu1.94S to form the CZITS phase, which is similar to the literature.29

As is well known, XRD alone is incapable to rule out the existence of secondary phases which have similar XRD patterns to CZITS. Therefore Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the sample. As shown in Fig. S11,† the major peaks appear at 566, 786, 1085 and 1552 cm−1, without any other characteristic impurity peaks, indicating that the CZITS nanodisks do not contain any possible secondary binary, ternary or quaternary phase, including CuxS,30 ZnS,30 SnS2,30 Cu2SnS3,14,30 CuInS2,31 Cu3InSnS5,14 Cu2ZnSnS416,30 and so on. Both XRD and Raman analyses confirm that no major crystalline secondary phases are generated under our optimized synthesis conditions.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the valence states of the five constituent elements in the as-synthesized CZITS nanodisks (Fig. S14†). The Cu 2p XPS displays two peaks at 931.5 eV and 951.3 eV with a peak separation of 19.8 eV, indicating that the valence state of the Cu ion is +1. The Zn 2p peaks which are located at 1021.2 and 1044.1 eV show a peak separation of 22.9 eV, suggesting the presence of Zn(II). The In and Sn are split into 3d5/2 (444.25 eV), 3d3/2 (451.7 eV) and 3d5/2 (486.5 eV), 3d3/2 (494.9 eV), respectively, confirming that elements indium and tin of the nanodisks are in their expected valence states (+3 and +4). The sulfur 2p peaks located at 161.1 (2p3/2) and 162.2 eV (2p1/2) with an energy difference of 1.1 eV are consistent with the 160 to 164 eV range of S in the sulphide phases. These results are consistent with the reported values in the literature.14,30,32,33
To study the morphology and further confirm the structure of the as-synthesized CZITS nanocrystals, TEM analysis was carried out. Fig. 3a shows a low magnification TEM image of nearly monodisperse and well-separated CZITS nanodisks. These nanocrystals have regular hexagonal plate form with sharp edges which lie flat on the edge and self-assemble into 2D arrays on amorphous carbon membranes. Anisotropic morphology may enhance the interactions between the nanocrystals and further promote their assembly, which is highly desirable because it is a key step toward building functional nanodevices such as nanoscale solar cells. A histogram of the size distribution of a typical sample is shown in the inset of Fig. 3a. These nanodisks have an average size of 9.55 ± 0.578 nm. Fig. 3b illustrates a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual nanodisk which exhibits distinct lattice fringes, demonstrating the high crystallinity of the nanocrystals. The interplanar distance calculated from the HRTEM image is 0.335 nm, corresponding to the (100) lattice plane of the wurtzite CZITS structure. Fig. 3c shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a CZITS nanodisk lying flat, which exhibits clear diffraction spots, confirming the single crystalline nature. The diffraction spots in the SAED pattern can be well indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite CZITS structure.34

The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the CZITS nanodisk dispersion (Fig. S12†) depicts that these nanodisks have strong absorbance in the visible region. The band gap of the CZITS nanodisks is estimated to be 1.48 eV, which approaches the optimum value for solar photoelectric conversion. To assess photoelectrical properties of the as-synthesized wurtzite CZITS nanodisks, a photoresponse device, illustrated in Fig. S1,† was fabricated by spin-casting CZITS nanocrystal ink on a glass slide (2 × 2 cm). The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the photoresponse device measured for a 1 V bias range under AM1.5 illumination (red) and in the dark (black) are compared in Fig. S13.† The CZITS nanocrystal film exhibits nearly linear current–voltage curves that are symmetric about the origin, which implies the ohmic nature of the contacts. Under light irradiation, the current of the CZITS nanodisks at 1 V is 60 μA, 2.3 times higher than that in the dark (26 μA). The Ilight/Idark ratio of the CZITS nanodisk film is larger than that of some CZTS nanocrystal films.28,30 This obvious photoresponsive behavior demonstrates that the as-synthesized CZITS nanodisks could be potential candidates in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices.
In polycrystalline semiconductors, grain boundaries are often sites where electrons and holes recombine. Therefore, to obtain larger grains, a further annealing process of the CZITS at higher temperature is necessary for the application of the CZITS nanodisks in thin film photovoltaic devices. Then, it is important to know the stability of wurtzite type CZITS nanodisks. Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CZITS after annealing at different temperatures for 5 min. The CZITS nanodisks annealed at 300 °C and 350 °C maintain the wurtzite structure. When the temperature rises to 400 °C, a tetragonal CZITS phase is observed besides the wurtzite type CZITS. However, the XRD patterns reveal that the structure of CZITS nanodisks annealed at 450 °C and 500 °C changes into a tetragonal type completely (see Fig. S4 and S5† and relevant simulation details in the ESI†). Hence, the annealing temperature plays an important role in the process of the CZITS phase transition between wurtzite and tetragonal. Followed by the phase transition, the CZITS grains grow larger. Fig. S15† shows the SEM images of CZITS after annealing at different temperatures. The size of CZITS annealed at 300 °C is similar to that at 350 °C. When the temperature rises above 400 °C, the grains grow remarkably. Therefore, we deduce that the growth of grains is driven by the phase transition. The wurtzite CZITS nanocrystals are hexagonal disk forms which self-organize into a 2D layer. So the solutions of CZITS may consist of multiple layers of CZITS nanodisks stacked layer by layer along the c axis. When the temperature rises, the CZITS nanodisks might coalesce into large grains through the (002) lattice plane of the wurtzite structure, meanwhile the atoms rearrange into a tetragonal structure, which can be proven from the higher intensity of the diffraction peak at about 28° in the XRD pattern of the sample annealed at 400 °C. The nanocrystal ordering favors their coalescence by reducing the interparticle distance. A direct, isocompositional and complete transition from semiconductor nanocrystals into large grained films is very rare.35 We facilely assist grain growth via annealing a template of metastable wurtzite CZITS nanodisks at a relatively low temperature (see the Annealing experiment in the ESI† for details). These results suggest that by controlling the annealing temperature, semiconductor nanocrystals for nano- and micrometer-scale photoelectric devices can be synthesized by this reaction strategy.

Conclusions
In summary, the pure phase hexagonal quinary CZITS nanodisks with a wurtzite structure have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum demonstrates that the as-obtained quinary CZITS nanodisks have strong absorbance in the visible region, indicating their potential application as solar absorbers. The promising photoresponsive properties of the as-synthesized CZITS nanodisk film are better than those of some CZTS nanocrystal films. In addition, the synthesis of CZITS nanodisks has significantly reduced the amount of the rare and expensive element In to be used compared to CuInS2, which has lowered the fabricating cost sharply. Moreover, through annealing, the as-obtained CZITS nanodisks grow into large grains driven by a direct, isocompositional solid-state phase transition, which can improve the device performance in nanoparticle-ink-based semiconductor thin film solar cells. Furthermore, the rational design and synthesis of CZITS nanodisks should be helpful in fabricating other I3–II–III–IV–VI6 (I = Cu; II = Zn, Cd; III = B, Al, Ga, In; IV = Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se, Te) nanocrystals at lower cost, improved light harvesting and efficient charge separation. These studies are currently underway in our laboratory and will be reported in the following studies. Overall, we have provided new insights and opportunities in designing novel semiconductor materials to address the challenge of fabricating low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.
