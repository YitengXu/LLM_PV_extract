    , Accepted 9th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractA plasmonic liquid junction photovoltaic cell with greatly improved power conversion efficiency is described. When illuminated with simulated sunlight, the device (Au–TiO2/V3+(0.018 M), V2+(0.182 M)/Pt) reproducibly and sustainably produces an VOC of 0.50 V and a JSC of 0.5 mA cm−2, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency of 0.095%.
The use of surface plasmons to carry out, or to enhance photoprocesses such as artificial photosynthesis and photovoltaic solar conversion, previously the domain of semiconductors, has grown steadily in the past half dozen years. Most studies have concentrated on plasmonically-enabled photocatalysis.1–3 In photovoltaics the emphasis, and the greatest efficiencies, have arisen from the use of surface plasmons to enhance the performance of existing semiconductor-based photovoltaic systems.4,5 In contrast, several examples of photovoltaics in which the charge carriers originate entirely, or almost entirely, from the decay products of plasmons have also been reported,6–13 including two from our own laboratory, the first, based on gold nanorods coated with thin TiO2 layers using atomic layer deposition, achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.002%;12 while a plasmonic liquid junction cell using TiO2-covered gold nanoparticles and an iodide/triiodide redox couple, produced a PCE value of 0.005%.13
In this Communication, we describe a surface plasmon-based liquid junction photovoltaic cell with a significantly improved power conversion efficiency arising from a 10-fold improvement in photocurrent and a two-fold improvement in photovoltage over previous liquid junction plasmonic solar cells. This was achieved by nano-texturing the gold cathode to produce a broad-band plasmonic absorber covering most of the solar spectrum; and by selecting a redox couple whose electrochemical potential is significantly negative (in electrochemical scale) than the Fermi level of the plasmonic metal.
The energy diagram and architecture of the liquid junction cell are shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, the cell consists of a plasmonic (Au) light harvesting electrode, an electrolyte containing a redox couple, a dielectric layer isolating the plasmonic metal from the redox couple, and an inert (Pt) counter electrode (Fig. 1a).

As in a metal–insulator–metal diode, the thin dielectric layer between the plasmonic metal and the redox couple serves to sustain the internal potential difference across the solid–liquid interface. On illuminating the cell, hot electrons and holes are created in the plasmonic metal. A significant portion of the hot electrons will traverse the thin dielectric layer and reduce the oxidized form (V3+) of the redox couple. Holes that reach the rear contact, traverse the external circuit performing useful work, then oxidize the reduced form (V2+) of the redox couple at the counter electrode, completing the cycle, thereby preserving the number of the redox species during the process.
The maximum photovoltage achievable by such a cell (Eph) is given by the energy difference between the Fermi levels of the metal (EF,metal) and the liquid phase (EF,redox; eqn (1)). (1)The term enclosed in the square parentheses in eqn (1) derives from the Nernst equation, with E0F,redox being the standard redox potential at which concentration of the oxidized species (Cox) is equal to the concentration of the reduced species (Cred). R, T and n are, respectively, the universal gas constant, temperature and number of electrons involved in the reaction. Eqn (1) can help guide the choice of materials comprising the cell, since a large Fermi energy difference between the plasmonic metal and the contacting liquid translates into a higher photovoltages, which, all else being equal, results in a higher energy conversion efficiency.
The light-harvesting element of our cells consists of a 2-dimensional array of randomly disposed gold islands, produced on an ITO substrate by roughening a 200 nm deposited Au film using electrochemical reduction/oxidation cycles, an established process that has traditionally been used to produce rough Au or Ag surfaces for SERS (see ESI,† experimental details).14,15 This process produces heterogeneously nanostructured gold surfaces which absorb light almost uniformly over the visible and near IR regions of the solar spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†). The 10 nm of TiO2 covering the rough gold substrate was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD).16 The counter electrode is a two-dimensional array of Pt nanoparticles. The cathode and anode are separated by 60 μm spacer, which forms a small volume that is then filled with an aqueous electrolyte containing V2+/V3+ ions that function as a redox couple that ferries charge across the anode–cathode gap (Fig. 1b). Vanadium V2+/V3+ is a one electron redox couple with rapid charge transfer kinetics that has been successfully used to investigate the performance of p-Si, p-InP based systems.17,18 Its work function (4.3 V vs. vacuum) is lower than that of iodine/tri-iodide redox couple that had been used previously,13 suggesting that the V2+/V3+ would present a high energy barrier, resulting in an improved PCE, as was indeed observed. Further, the redox potential values of V2+/V3+ lie close to conduction band edge of TiO2 enhancing the hot carrier extraction efficiency. The cell was illuminated through the ITO with simulated solar AM1.5 light that excites plasmons in the gold island film.
A typical current-density versus voltage plot is shown in Fig. 2, on which typical values of the measured open-circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are listed. We have tested about 7 devices, and the average PCE is 0.095%, indicating excellent reproducibility of our devices. Stable VOC values as high as 478 mV were obtained, significantly higher than previously reported values.12,13

The high currents measured likely result from the panchromatic light absorption characteristics of the nanostructured Au cathode, which, in turn, arises from the wide distribution of sizes and shapes of the gold nano-objects and the large range of interparticle gaps present. Even higher values of JSC are therefore possible with further optimized nanostructured gold surfaces. Cell PCE values 0.095%, were typical. Overall, this represents a 20-fold improvement over what we reported previous for a liquid junction solar cell based on TiO2 coated Au nanoparticles and the iodide–triiodide redox couple.13
Long-term stability tests of the solar cell were carried out under normal ambient conditions. The pertinent photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) retained, respectively, 99%, 91%, 92% and 84% of their initial values after 1000 hours of operation (Fig. 3). The high stability of the cell is in part due to (i) the strong adhesion of the Au film to its ITO substrate, which, in turn, is a consequence of the film fabrication strategy used, (ii) the continuous nature of the TiO2 layer and its high crystallinity, (iii) the non-corrosive nature of the electrolyte, and (iv) the rational Au/semiconductor/electrolyte cell design that isolates the Au arrays from the redox electrolyte, greatly reducing Au corrosion or its oxidization by direct contact with the electrolyte.19,20

In summary, we have demonstrated a liquid junction plasmonic photovoltaic cell using a V2+/V3+ redox couple and TiO2 coated Au arrays. The appropriate choice of redox couple and broad-band light absorber properties of gold nanoislands enabled high VOC and JSC, respectively. A typical set of photovoltaic results yielded VOC = 478 mV, JSC = 470 μA cm−2, FF = 0.423, and PCE = 0.095%. The power conversion efficiency obtained is a twenty-fold increase over the previously described (Au–TiO2/I3−(0.1 M), I−(0.6 M)/Pt) device. The device showed good stability for more than 1000 hours under ambient conditions possibly due to good contact between gold arrays and the ITO substrate and isolation of the gold and the electrolyte to prevent unwanted reactions between them.
