    , Accepted 8th September 2018First published on 10th September 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with high exciton binding energy and great environmental stability have recently attracted great attention for their promising potential optoelectronic applications. The controllable growth of 2D perovskites with desired shapes would be critical for improving the performance of 2D perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. However, the investigation on this is still in its infancy. Here, we report on the controllable synthesis of 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 microstructures with a butterfly shape, (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 and (C4H9NH3)2PbI4/(C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 microstructures with a square shape by a solution-processing method. We have systematically investigated the influence of the substrate, mass ratio and crystallization temperature on the morphology evolution of the as-synthesized 2D perovskite microstructures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM) images show that the size and thickness of the resultant products are positively correlated with their mass ratio and negatively correlated with their crystallization temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, fluorescence imaging, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and absorption studies confirm the crystalline structures and optical properties of the as-synthesized regularly shaped 2D perovskite microstructures. Our studies provide a simple method to controllably synthesize 2D perovskite microstructures without using very toxic solvents and thus offer a platform to investigate the optical and charge transport properties of 2D perovskite materials for the further design of new device architectures with enhanced performance.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, especially CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have undergone unprecedented progress in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells,1,2 photodetectors,3–6 lasers,7,8 transistors and light-emitting devices.9–14 To date, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells has been increasing rapidly to more than 22% within just a few years due to the strong light absorption,10,15–21 long carrier diffusion length and modest carrier mobility of the perovskite materials within the three-dimensional (3D) frameworks.22–25
However, 3D perovskites also have many drawbacks such as long-term instability against moisture, heat and light illumination, which prevent their further commercial applications.2,26–30 One feasible solution to address the long-term stability issue of 3D perovskites is the use of two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with high exciton binding energies and great environmental stability,31–33 which have attracted extensive studies recently.34–38 These 2D perovskites have the general chemical formula R2(A)n−1MX3n+1 (where R is a long chain cation acting as a spacer, X is a halogen, M is a bivalent metal cation, A is an organic cation and n is an integer from 1 to ∞). The structure of the 2D perovskite consists of layers of [MX6]4− octahedra confined between the long chain organic molecules, forming a multi-quantum well structure.39 To date, several methods have been proposed for the growth of specific morphologies of (C4H9NH3)2PbX4 and (C6H5CH2NH3)2PbX4 films while controllable morphology of 2D perovskite individual microstructures is in its infancy.35,40,41 The controllable synthesis of 2D perovskite nanostructures with desired shapes is critical for investigating the optical and charge transport properties of 2D perovskite materials for the further design of new device architectures with enhanced performance due to their unique size and morphology dependent optical and electronic properties.42 Furthermore, 2D perovskites with specially designed shapes can improve the performance of 2D perovskite-based optoelectronic devices and lay a foundation for future research on integrated optoelectronic device arrays. In addition, the controllable growth of 2D perovskites makes it possible to fabricate individual microstructure devices made of 2D perovskites so that the basic optical and electronic parameters of the 2D perovskites can be extracted to further optimize the optoelectronic devices. Recently, butterfly shaped 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 perovskite microstructures have been synthesized with controllable size by carefully selecting the solvent used.40 Nevertheless, the very toxic unfavorable virulent reagent acetonitrile (ACN) was used in order to achieve the high controllability of the resultant microstructures.
Here, we report on the controllable growth of 2D (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 with various shapes and sizes by tuning the mass ratio and crystalline temperature without using the very toxic ACN solution. We have not only successfully synthesized butterfly-shaped (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 microstructures, but also obtained (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 and (C4H9NH3)2PbI4/(C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 square plates by rationally alternating the compositions of the ingredients. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM) studies reveal how the crystal size and thickness of the resultant 2D perovskite microstructures correlate with the crystallization temperature and the mass ratio of the perovskites dissolved in n-dimethylformamide (DMF). XRD patterns, fluorescence imaging, temperature-dependent PL and absorption spectroscopy confirm the excellent crystalline quality and optical properties of the resultant regularly shaped 2D perovskite microstructures.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of methylammonium chloride (MACl)/n-butylammonium iodide (BAI)
For the synthesis of MACl, aqueous methylamine (MA, 40 wt% in water) was dropped into a hydrochloric acid (HCl, 32 wt% in water) solution at a molar ratio of 1:1 at 0 °C accompanied by stirring for two hours. The mixed solution was washed with diethyl ether three times after evaporation at 60 °C and then dried at 70 °C for 12 hours to obtain the MACl powder. As for the BAI solution, the same procedure was adopted except that the MA and HCl solutions were replaced with n-butylamine (BA) and hydriodic acid (HI) solutions, respectively, and the stirring time was prolonged to four hours.
2.2 Synthesis of 2D perovskite sources
The perovskites were synthesized using a previously reported method.33,43,44 0.5 g PbO powder, 0.5 ml hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50 wt% in water) solution and 3 ml hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water) solution were mixed in a flask and heated to 140 °C with magnetic stirring. Then, 2.5 mmol BAI solution was added to the mixture in order to obtain (BA)2PbI4 plates while 0.169 g MACl and 1.75 mmol BAI solution were added to get (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 plates. For the synthesis of (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates, 1.21 mmol BAI solution was added to the mixed solution first and was kept heated for 5 min and then 0.169 g MACl was added to obtain the plates. After 10 minutes, the stirring was stopped and the solution was left to cool to room temperature naturally. After being kept static overnight, the as-prepared perovskite plates were dried at 130 °C for 1 hour and dissolved in DMF to form a solution at a specific mass ratio for the further synthesis of 2D perovskite microstructures with regular shapes.
2.3 Synthesis of regularly shaped 2D perovskite microstructures
For the synthesis of (BA)2PbI4 butterflies, pre-cleaned glass or SiO2/Si substrates were treated with a plasma cleaner (PT-2S) for 180 s, and the as-prepared perovskite precursor solution in DMF (the mass ratio of perovskites: 4.5%, 6%, 8.25%, 12.5%, 15% and 25%) was spin-coated onto the substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 20 s before it was dried at a series of temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 130 °C. As for the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square microplates, a similar procedure was adopted except that the spin-coating speed was changed to 4000 rpm for 40 s.
2.4 Characterization
Ultraviolet-vis absorbance spectra were obtained using a Lambda 35 ultraviolet-vis spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on a home-built microRaman spectrometer (Horiba JY iHR550) in a backscattering configuration collected by the spectrometer excited by a 405 nm laser with a power of 1 μW. The temperature-dependent PL measurements were performed in the same configuration equipped with a liquid helium continuous flow cryostat and the temperature was controlled by a temperature controller (Lake Shore Model 336). XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D2 PHPSER (Cu Kα λ = 0.1542 nm, nickel filter, 25 kV, 40 mA). The fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus BX51 microscope excited by a 488 nm LED. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a TESCAN microscope (TESCAN SB). The thicknesses of the microstructures were confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension Edge) and optical images were acquired using an optical microscope (OM, Mshot-MJ30).
3. Results and discussion
The schematic illustrations of the synthesis of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 microstructures are presented in Fig. 1a. First, the as-synthesized perovskite crystals were dissolved in the DMF solution at a specific mass ratio. Then the mixed solution was spin-coated onto the substrates followed by annealing at an appropriate temperature forming regular shapes. Fig. 1b shows the schematics of the crystal structures of the (BA)2PbI4 (denoted as n = 1), (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (denoted as n = 2) and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (denoted as n = 1–n = 2) perovskites, which illuminate that the basic multi-quantum well structure of these 2D perovskites consists of layers of [PbI6]4− octahedra sandwiched between the long chain organic molecules.33,37 The 2D perovskite crystal is then formed by stacking the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 layers along a specific axis via weak Van der Waals forces.

Fig. 2a–c show the OM images of the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 microstructures for n = 1, n = 2 and n = 1–n = 2. The corresponding SEM images in Fig. 2d–f indicate their relatively smooth surface and regular shape. Fig. 2g–i show the AFM images of the as-synthesized microstructures. As seen in Fig. 2g, the AFM image confirms the relatively smooth surface of the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies with a thickness of 78 nm while a small number of randomly irregular perovskites are found around the microstructure. Fig. 2h shows that the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 plates also possess a smooth surface with a regular square shape. Fig. 2h and i show the striking color difference between the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates. As seen in Fig. 2i, the dark shadow inside the square plates shares the same butterfly shape as that of the (BA)2PbI4 compound. We then inferred a possible situation that the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies crystallized first and subsequently the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 compound grew surrounding the (BA)2PbI4 compound, resulting in (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 heterojunctions. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2j) indicate that the diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized n = 1 and n = 2 2D perovskite compounds agree well with those of the previously reported 2D perovskite crystals.32,33,46 For the n = 1–n = 2 square plates, both the n = 1 and n = 2 perovskite phases appeared, confirming the existence of the n = 1 and n = 2 phases.

The scale bar is 5 μm. (j) XRD patterns of the as-synthesized (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 microstructures for n = 1, n = 2 and n = 1–n = 2 with the main peaks indexed.

Generally, the mass ratio of perovskites in DMF and the crystallization temperature are the two critical factors to determine the size and thickness of the resultant products.40 As seen in Fig. 3, the OM images of the as-synthesized (BA)2PbI4 butterflies spin-coated on Si substrates show that the morphology is closely related to the mass ratio. At a low mass ratio of 4.5%, small size perovskite butterflies with not very regular shapes are obtained owing to the insufficient solute source supplied during the spin-coating process (Fig. 3a). As the mass ratio increases from 6% to 25%, the size and thickness of the butterflies increase simultaneously, and the shapes become more regular due to the increase in the available precursor source (Fig. 3b–e). However, the perovskite butterflies will be stacked together when the mass ratio is very high. Indeed, the optimal mass ratio to obtain the butterfly-shaped (BA)2PbI4 microstructures is around 8.25%. Fig. 3f summarizes how the size and thickness of the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies evolve with respect to the mass ratio, and indicates that both the size and thickness of the as-grown (BA)2PbI4 butterflies continuously increase with increasing mass ratio.

The scale bar is 5 μm. (f) Plots of the crystal size and thickness of the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies against the perovskite mass ratio in DMF. 
Subsequently, we found that the perovskite morphology could also be grown on a glass substrate and a similar experimental result was achieved as that on the Si substrate. Furthermore, we studied the influence of the crystallization temperature on the morphology evolution of (BA)2PbI4 at a fixed mass ratio of 8.25%. As shown in Fig. S1,† the size and thickness of the final products are negatively correlated with the crystallization temperature. When the substrates with the spin-coated perovskite solution are baked at room temperature, (BA)2PbI4 butterflies with large sizes which are surrounded by irregularly shaped perovskites were formed (Fig. S1a†). As the temperature increases from room temperature to 70 °C, the size of the butterflies continuously decreases and the nucleation density gradually increases owing to the fast evaporation rate.40 Meanwhile, the amount of unshaped perovskite structures decreased since the higher baking temperature can help improve the crystallinity (Fig. S1a–c†). When the crystallization temperature was further increased, the perovskite butterflies become smaller and thinner and at the same time they begin to crumble (Fig. S1d†). Almost all of the butterflies turned into broken fragments when the temperature reached 130 °C (Fig. S1e†). The size and thickness of (BA)2PbI4 with respect to the crystallization temperature are summarized in Fig. S1f.† Indeed, the temperature of 70 °C was found to be the optimum temperature to acquire the butterfly-shaped perovskites with the best surface morphology and suitable size and thickness.
We further investigated the morphology evolution of the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates. As shown in Fig. 4 and S2,† the OM images reveal the size and thickness of the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates which follow a similar variation trend to that of (BA)2PbI4 with the change in the mass ratio (Fig. 4f and S2f†). For (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7, the plates are more disperse and coexist with less unshaped matter compared to (BA)2PbI4 at low mass ratios (Fig. 4a–c), which is mainly due to the more regular crystal morphology. However, further increasing the concentration will result in distorted square plates and introduce a small number of randomly irregularly shaped perovskites (Fig. 4d and e). For the (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 microstructures, optimal square plates are obtained when the mass ratio is lower than 12.5% (Fig. S2a–c†). The perovskite plates will coalesce together at higher concentrations (Fig. S2d and e†). It's worth noting that the n = 1–n = 2 square plates are as dense as the n = 1 microstructures and their shape is not as regular as that of the n = 2 plates. This can to some extent support our previous assumption that the (BA)2PbI4 compound crystallizes ahead of the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 compound and the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies become the nucleation sites for the surrounding (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 compound to grow.

The scale bar is 5 μm. (f) Plots of the crystal size and thickness of (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates with respect to the perovskite mass ratio in DMF. 
To sum up, both the mass ratio and the temperature play important roles in the crystal size and thickness of the as-grown 2D microstructures. The temperature affects the nucleation density and growth rate, while the mass ratio of the precursor determines the available precursor source for the microstructures to grow. The higher the crystallization temperature is, the faster the nucleation and growth are, leading to a smaller size of the microstructure at a higher temperature due to the faster evaporation rate. In terms of the mass ratio, the higher the mass ratio is, the larger the size of the resultant microstructures is, due to the larger amount of the available precursor source. Both the two factors can affect the final morphology but from different aspects.
To explore the optical properties of the synthesized microstructures, fluorescence imaging, and PL and absorption measurements were carried out. Fig. 5a–c display the fluorescence images of the as-synthesized (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 microstructures. n = 1 butterflies exhibit the strongest fluorescence owing to the strongest quantum limiting effect of the n = 1 compound while the n = 1–n = 2 microplates show the weakest emission because of the type II band alignment between the n = 1 and n = 2 compounds which can result in the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.44,45Fig. 5d shows the PL spectra of the n = 1, n = 2 and n = 1–n = 2 2D perovskite compounds. The peak of n = 2 exhibits a redshift relative to the peak of n = 1, which is due to the weaker quantum confinement effect in the n = 2 compounds.32,33 The size and morphology can also have a slight influence on the PL spectra. In terms of the size effect, the quantum confinement can be neglected as the size is much larger than the bulk exciton Bohr radius as in our case. But the surface effect might induce the slight shift of the emission peak and the decrease of the emission intensity due to the surface depletion electric field.46Fig. 5e shows the absorbance spectra of the as-synthesized perovskites. In addition to the absorption edge on their respective band edges,33,47 a small peak at 610 nm appears in the spectra of both the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates, which might be due to the presence of small inclusions of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10.

The scale bar is 5 μm. (d) PL spectra and (e) absorption spectra of the as-grown (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 microstructures for n = 1, n = 2 and n = 1–n = 2. 
To further check the crystalline quality of the as-synthesized 2D perovskite microstructures, we have also performed temperature-dependent PL measurements. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, the absence of emission peaks from impurities and narrow peak widths indicate the high crystallinity and purity of these regularly shaped 2D perovskites.32,33 The peak position of the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies shifts from 487 nm to 494 nm as the temperature increases from 77 K to 260 K, then jumps to 520 nm at around 280 K due to an orthorhombic-to-orthorhombic phase transition, consistent with previous studies (Fig. 6d).48,49 As for the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates shown in Fig. 6e, the peak position shows a blue shift from 77 K to 140 K and then a red shift when the temperature is higher than 140 K, agreeing well with that of the solution-processing (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 plates. As expected, the PL spectra of the (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates contain emission peaks from both n = 1 and n = 2 peaks at all temperatures as shown in Fig. 6c and f. Importantly, as the temperature increases, the two peak positions in n = 1–n = 2 follow exactly the same trend as those of n = 1 and n = 2, respectively (Fig. 6f), which can further confirm the high crystalline quality of the as-synthesized structures.

Finally, we found that the morphology of the as-synthesized microstructures strongly depends on the rotation speed during the spin-coating process. When the solution was spin-coated on the pre-treated substrate, a thin solution layer was evenly distributed on the hydrophilic surface allowing the nucleation of the crystal seeds.50 Subsequently, the crystal seeds became larger and turned into specific microstructures with the process of evaporation. If the rotation speed is too slow, the perovskite solution layer would be relatively thick. Therefore, the redundant solution will drive the formed microstructures to continue growing and finally aggregate into a thick film. On the contrary, when the rotation speed is too fast, the perovskite solution layer should be relatively thin leading to the termination of the further growth of crystal seeds. As a result, a large number of irregular perovskites appear. The perovskite butterflies or square plates can be acquired only if the rotation speed is appropriately selected. A suitable thickness of the solution layer can provide enough precursor sources to exactly crystallize into isolated shapes and prevent them from aggregating into a film. The optimal rotation speed is 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 20 s for the (BA)2PbI4 butterflies and 4000 rpm for 40 s for the (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we report on the synthesis of 2D (BA)2PbI4 butterflies, (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2PbI4/(BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 square plates by a solution-processing method. We have systematically investigated the factors that critically affect the morphology of the as-synthesized 2D perovskites. Our studies reveal that the size and thickness of the resultant products were positively correlated with the mass ratio and negatively correlated with the crystallization temperature. XRD, fluorescence imaging, PL and absorption studies indicate the good crystalline quality and excellent optical properties. Our work provides a simple method to controllably synthesize 2D perovskite microstructures without using very toxic solvents and offer a platform to investigate the optical and charge transport properties of 2D perovskite materials for the further design of new device architectures with enhanced performance.
