    , Accepted 1st October 2015First published on 5th October 2015AbstractConjugated systems built by connecting one electron-donor triphenylamine to an electron-withdrawing tetrazine have been prepared using various linkers. We describe here the synthesis, the electrochemical properties and some photophysical properties of these molecules, emphasizing the dependence upon the type of linker between the groups and an organic photovoltaic solar cell was prepared with one derivative.
Introduction

s-Tetrazine (Tz) is a strong electron-withdrawing molecule1,2 which finds many fields of applications such as retro Diels–Alder cyclisation,3–9 energetic compounds,10–16 coordination chemistry,17–24 electrofluorochromism.25–34 Very recently, polymers containing s-tetrazine have been used in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells35–39 and there is one example of a transistor based on a tetrazine-naphthalene diimide system.40 Triphenylamine (TPA) is a well-known electron-donor unit, extensively investigated in diverse fields including electrochromism,41–47 organic electronics48–67 or two-photon absorption.68–74
Recently we showed interest in the study of covalently linked tetrazine–triphenylamine derivatives where the fluorescence of the tetrazine unit could be switched on upon oxidation of the triphenylamine unit.31,33 However it is interesting to notice, that although these compounds can be regarded in principle as donor–acceptor (D–A) systems, no intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) bands were detected in the UV-vis spectra.
In fact, TPA and Tz units have never been covalently combined in a conjugated linked D–A system, in which an ICT band from the donor TPA moiety towards the accepting Tz ring is expected to occur, with the aim of using such an assembly as donor in an OPV cell. Indeed, the structure of efficient molecular donors generally involves a combination of donor and acceptor blocks. The goal is to create an ICT which produces at the same time an extension of the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths and a lowering of the HOMO level leading to an increase in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the OPV cell.75 In recent years, this approach has led to the synthesis of different classes of active molecules.60 In this context, the question of the choice of the link between the donor part and the acceptor part and its influence on the establishment of an ICT emerges as a quite interesting problem.
We report herein the synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical studies of new TPA–Tz systems, supported by theoretical calculations, together with the preliminary OPV results. Ten compounds including four different linkers have been thus investigated: compounds 1–4 with phenyl link, compounds 5–6 with thienyl link, compound 7 with alkynyl link and directly linked compounds 8–10 (Fig. 1).

Results and discussions
Synthesis
Design of tetrazine molecules 1–6 was rationalized in order to get mono or di-substitutions of the tetrazine core.
First we were interested in introducing a phenyl group as a bridge between the tetrazine unit and the triphenylamine moiety and in studying the influence of the position of the substituents on the phenyl bridge. Thus we targeted bichromophores 1–4 (Fig. 1). In order to synthesize the four chromophores, organometallic coupling reactions between bis-(dibromophenyl)-s-tetrazine and functionalized TPA were realized. First of all the dihydrotetrazines 11 and 12 were successfully obtained using the Pinner type reaction76–79 which involves sulphur addition on monohydrate hydrazine and then reaction with an aromatic nitrile (Scheme 1). Compounds 11 and 12 were then directly oxidized with nitrogen dioxide80 produced in situ to give the tetrazines 13 and 14. Purification of 14 appeared to be difficult as it is an insoluble product, so this explains its lower yield.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of bis(bromophenyl)-s-tetrazines 13 and 14. 
Then triphenylamine stannane derivative 15 was obtained by using described methods81 and was used without further purification (Scheme 2). Modest yield is due to the formation of triphenylamine and tetrabutylstannane during the reaction.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of bichromophores 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b. 
Then triphenylamine stannane derivative 15 and tetrazine compounds were bounded by a Stille cross coupling reaction,82 using conditions which are efficient and compatible with the tetrazine moiety.35,36,38,39,83 Because of the weak solubility of 14 in toluene (usual solvent for Stille reaction), we used tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent.
We were also interested in the synthesis of bichromophores linked with thiophene between triphenylamine and tetrazine moieties. In order to increase the solubility, we chose to add an alkyl chain on the thiophene moiety. The synthetic pathway leading to 3,6-bis(5-bromo-4-decylthiophen-2-yl)-s-tetrazine 16 is outlined in Scheme 3. 3-Decylthiophene 17 was obtained in good yield by Kumada–Corriu coupling between 3-bromothiophene and decylmagnesium bromide synthesized in situ,84 using a literature procedure.85,86 Then 3-decylthiophene 17 was brominated to give 2-bromo-3-decylthiophene 18.87 Treatment of 2-bromo-3-decylthiophene 18 with Et2NLi in THF at −78 °C for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of dimethylformamide,88 gave the expected aldehyde 19 with 70% yield. 5-Bromo-4-decylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde 19 was then oxidized in the presence of iodine and ammoniacal solution89 to give the corresponding nitrile 20 in 75% yield. The desired 3,6-bis(5-bromo-4-decylthiophen-2-yl)-s-tetrazine 16 was obtained from 5-bromo-4-decylthiophene-2-carbonitrile 20 with 20% yield using the Pinner reaction type described previously76–79 followed by an oxidation.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of 3,6-bis(5-bromo-4-decylthiophen-2-yl)-s-tetrazine 16. 
Optimized Suzuki–Miyaura coupling90 conditions (compatible with tetrazine moiety) were used with 3,6-bis(5-bromo-4-decylthiophen-2-yl)-s-tetrazine 16. Indeed solution of 3,6-bis(5-bromo-4-decylthiophen-2-yl)-s-tetrazine 16 and tetrakistriphenylphosphine Pd(PPh3)4 in toluene was mixed with triphenylamineboronic acid solution in methanol and aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The expected bichromophores 5 and 6 were then isolated in 40% and 55% yields respectively (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of bichromophores 5 and 6. 
To get the new compounds 7–10, we used different strategies for the synthesis of the tetrazine systems: Pinner-type condensation of aromatic nitriles, nucleophilic substitution of particularly electrodeficient tetrazine synthons or Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling with specific tetrazine precursors.
The electrodeficient 3-chloro-6-morpholino-s-tetrazine 21 (Fig. 2) was then chosen as starting material for the synthesis of 7 as it can undergo nucleophilic substitution in very mild conditions. On the other hand, 3,6-bis(3-bromophenyl)-s-tetrazine 13 and methylthiotetrazines 22 and 23 were selected to be functionalized according to cross-coupling reactions, in order to lead respectively to 8, 9 and 10.
 Fig. 2  Tetrazine derivatives used as starting materials. 
To provide the alkynyl spacer between the TPA and Tz substructures of compound 7, we used aromatic nucleophilic substitution of an alkynide on a chlorotetrazine (Scheme 5), a method which has only once been briefly reported.1 First, 4-(diphenylamino)-benzaldehyde 24 was obtained from triphenylamine through a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with a reasonable yield (77%).56 The action of the Bestmann–Ohira reagent 2591 (previously synthesized using a literature procedure)92,93 led to 4-ethynyl-N,N-diphenylaniline 26 in 73% yield. Finally, treatment of ethynyl compound 26 with BuLi in THF at −78 °C for 3h30, followed by addition of chlorotetrazine 21 (obtained by an aromatic nucleophilic substitution of 3,6-dichloro-s-tetrazine with morpholine), led to compound 7 in 12% yield. It must be noted that the low yield for this last step, was however mainly due to a low conversion of the starting material since 48% of 26 was recovered at the end of the reaction.
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of 7. 
Synthesis of compound 8 where TPA and Tz are directly linked was achieved using Hartwig–Buchwald coupling94,95 on synthon 13 (previously prepared with Pinner reaction76,77 on 3-bromophenylnitrile) (Scheme 6). A first coupling between 3,6-bis(3-bromophenyl)-s-tetrazine 13 and excess of anisidine gave 3,3′-(s-tetrazine-3,6-diyl)bis(N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) 27 (40% yield). A second Hartwig–Buchwald coupling between 27 and bromoanisole gave the expected 3,3′-(s-tetrazine-3,6-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) 8 in 47% yield. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Hartwig–Buchwald conditions on dibromoaryltetrazine are reported. The same synthesis from 3,6-bis(4-bromophenyl)-s-tetrazine isomer did not give the expected product because of insolubility of the starting tetrazine.
 Scheme 6  Synthesis of 8. 
In order to link directly the tetrazine unit with the para position of triphenylamine, we decided to use to the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling. Again, we were aware of only one report where Suzuki–Miyaura conditions were used for the direct functionalization of a tetrazine ring.96 As 3-methylthio-6-morpholino-s-tetrazine 22 and 3-methoxy-6-methylthio-s-tetrazine 23 gave the best yields,96 we decided to undergo the cross-coupling on these two synthons.
3,6-Di-(thiomethyl)-s-tetrazine 28 was then obtained according to the method developed by Sandström.97 Then this precursor underwent an aromatic nucleophilic substitution with sodium methanolate on the one hand and with morpholine on the other hand leading respectively to the expected thiomethyltetrazines 22 (23%) and 23 (74%) (Scheme 7).
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of the tetrazine precursors 22 and 23. 
A Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling between triphenylamine boronic acid and each precursor 22 and 23 gave the expected products 9 and 10 with respectively 15% and 29% yields (Scheme 8).
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of compounds 9 and 10. 
Finally we obtained ten new compounds 1–10, centrosymmetrical or not, according to original synthetic ways in tetrazine chemistry. Thus, we can study the influence of the nature of the linker between the active subunits on the properties of our tetrazine-based compounds.
Electrochemical properties
The redox properties of all bichromophores were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical data of all dyads are exemplified in Fig. 3 for compound 8 and summarized in Table 1. Two well defined redox systems can be identified corresponding to the oxidation of the triphenylamine moiety into its cation radical and to the reduction of tetrazine moiety into its anion radical. The triphenylamine oxidation peaks of 8 and all the other compounds are reversible whereas the tetrazine electrochemistry is not entirely reversible. In the case of the compounds 1, 3 and 4, the reduction is totally irreversible and no standard potential could be determined. No clear explanation can be given but a similar behavior has been observed by Ding et al. in analogous compounds.36

The reduction potential E0/−1 has a very low variation and is around −1.45 V, except for the tetrazines 8, 9 and 10, where it is ca. 150 mV higher, but these ones have a quite different structure with much less donating substituents. The oxidation potential E1/0 is around 0.45 V. It is slightly lower in the case of 8 because the triphenylamine is substituted with methoxy donor groups which stabilize the cation radical and facilitate its formation. Conversely, the oxidation potential is higher in the cases of 9 and 10 because the electron-withdrawing tetrazine is directly linked to the para position of the triphenylamine and thus makes the oxidation more difficult. To summarize, it seems, as previously observed with ferrocene–tetrazine compounds5j that the reduction potential of the tetrazine is weakly affected by the substituents, while on the other hand, the electron-withdrawing tetrazine induces a noticeable rise on the oxidation potential of the triphenylamine, when it is directly linked to it (compounds 9 and 10). Since the oxidation process affects the HOMO and the reduction the LUMO, this tends to show that there is an efficient mixing of the HOMOs while the LUMO of the tetrazine is quite unaffected by the substituents besides purely inductive effects.
Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of 6, 8 and 10 in dichloromethane solutions are displayed in Fig. 4 and the absorption data are collected in Table 2. These bichromophores display several bands, the number depending on the delocalization between the tetrazine moiety and the triphenylamine unit. For all compounds, there are one or two intense bands in the UV region in agreement with π–π* transitions located both on tetrazine and triphenylamine units. The corresponding molar absorption coefficient varies between 13000 and 76000 L mol−1 cm−1 depending on the nature of the substituents on the tetrazine, which is reasonably high enough to be used in organic solar cells. Another band is located at around 545 nm and displays a weak molar absorption coefficient (around 500 L mol−1 cm−1) due to a forbidden n–π* transition centered on the tetrazine unit. This band is not always well-defined because of its lower intensity. A last band appears around 400 nm for all the compounds where tetrazine moiety and triphenylamine unit are conjugated but not in the case of 1 and 2 because of the meta position of TPA on the phenyl link. This band is most probably an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band. Its molar absorption coefficient depends on the strength of the electronic delocalization. Indeed the molar absorption coefficient of 8, where tetrazine is linked to the triphenylamine via the meta position, is only 3300 L mol−1 cm−1 whereas the one of 6, where the tetrazine and triphenylamine moieties are linked through a thiophene, reaches 49000 L mol−1 cm−1.

The absorption solvatochromism of this third band (between 360 and 440 nm) for compounds 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 has been studied in seven different solvents: cyclohexane (cy), dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofurane (THF), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), acetonitrile (ACN), dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO) and ethanol (EtOH) and the results are gathered in Table 3. The variation of the localization of the band is weak (around 7 nm) in the case of the compounds 9 and 10 where the tetrazine and triphenylamine units are directly linked and in the case of 7 which has an alkyne link. This is probably due to the fact that the different solvents have similar effects on the two orbitals implied in this transition. However, the variation is, as expected, more important (around 14 nm) in the case of the compounds 3, 4 and 6 which have an extended conjugated pathway. A general trend for all the compounds can be observed from the values given in Table 3. When increasing the polarity of the solvent from cyclohexane (apolar solvent) to dichloromethane (a little more polar one), one can see a bathochromic shift. Then, when the polarity further increases (from DCM to ACN), a hypsochromic shift occurs. It shows that the polarity influences the localization of the intramolecular charge transfer band. A similar change has been reported on the donor–acceptor compound 3-chloro-6-tetrathiafulvalene-s-tetrazine.18 Behaviors in DMSO or ethanol (high polar solvents) are difficult to understand because there is no general trend for all compounds.

A more detailed study has been realized in the case of compound 3 using a general and multiparameter scale developed by Catalán98 based on four empirical scales: the solvent polarizability (SP), dipolarity (SdP), acidity (SA) and basicity (SB). The absorption wavenumber (v) is fitted with these solvent parameters according to the equation: = ° + aSP + bSdP + cSA + dSBwhere ° is the gas phase wavenumber, and a, b, c and d are the regression coefficients describing the sensitivity of  to the different parameters. From this treatment, it appears that this chromophore presents a solvatochromism dominated by non-specific interactions as seen by the predominance of de solvent polarizabilty parameter (a = −3715, b = 118, c = 91, d = 157, r2 = 0.87), as already observed for charge transfer molecules.99,100
Finally, these compounds have a high absorbance and solvatochromic intramolecular charge transfer band, which is an important property for various applications such as organic solar cell or two-photon absorption.
Molecular modelling
Quantum chemical calculations were carried out on the ten compounds. Geometry optimizations were first performed at the B3LYP level of theory and with the 3–21 g basis set. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations at the PBE0 level of theory with the 6-31+g(d) basis set were subsequently performed. Note that a C4 chain was used instead of a C10 chain in the case of 5 and 6 in order to shorten the calculations.
All these compounds have a central planar part (Fig. 5). In the case of 7, this plane surface is constituted by the tetrazine moiety and the phenyl ring which is linked to the alkyne. In the other cases, the planar surface is constituted by the tetrazine moiety and the adjacent aromatic part(s). In the case of the phenyl or thiophene links, the linker forms an angle with the first adjacent phenyl of the triphenylamine: 40° for 3 and 4, 41° for 1 and 2 and 50° for 5 and 6. The angle is more important for the thiophene linker because of the sterically hindered alkyl chain. In all cases, the two phenyl groups at the end of triphenylamine are out of the plane.
 Fig. 5  Calculated geometries of compounds 1–10. 
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is a π*-orbital centered on the tetrazine ring, which reflects its electron-withdrawing ability. Contrariwise, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is always a π-orbital localized on the triphenylamine and the adjacent linker. The non-bounding orbital of the tetrazine is found at a lower energy.
All compounds show one absorption band around 300 nm. This absorption band is due to a transition from the π-orbital to π*-orbital both centered on the tetrazine unit and the adjacent link (Fig. 6a). The important overlap between the orbitals of the latter transition explains the intense absorption. Molecular modelling shows that the energetic gap between these two orbitals varies slightly, depending on the molecules (between 3.75 and 3.92 eV, Fig. 6b), which is in agreement with the experimental observation (maximal wavelength between 295 and 307 nm). The energies of the π and π* orbitals of the symmetrical compounds 1, 3 and 6 are slightly higher than the ones of the corresponding molecules with only one triphenylamine moiety 2, 4 and 5. Indeed, the replacement of an inductive attractor bromine atom with a donating triphenylamine core induces a destabilization of the orbitals. In the case of 7, the orbitals are higher because the electron-donating morpholine moiety is directly linked to the tetrazine ring.

A weak transition is found at around 550 nm. This is the classical band localized on the tetrazine ring (n–π*, Fig. 7a), usually responsible for the colors of the tetrazine molecules, and the difference of symmetry of these orbitals explains the weak molar absorption coefficient found experimentally and also confirmed by calculations. For some compounds, this band is hidden by a very intense band located close to it. As with other tetrazine compounds, the localization of this band does not vary since the energy difference between the pair of orbital stays constant (from 3.52 to 4.09 eV, Fig. 7b).
 Fig. 7  (a) Representation of the molecular orbitals involved in the absorption band at 550 nm of 8; (b) energy levels of n (yellow) and π* (sky blue) orbitals involved in the transition at around 550 nm of 1–10. 
The compounds 3–10 also exhibit a third band which does not exist in the case of the compounds 1 and 2. The localization and the intensity of this absorption band are strongly dependent on the compounds (360 nm < λ < 441 nm and 3300 L mol−1 cm−1 < ε < 59000 L mol−1 cm−1, Table 2). Molecular modelling shows that this band is due to a transition from a π-orbital centered on the triphenylamine unit to a π*-orbital centered on the tetrazine ring and the link (Fig. 8a). This is an intramolecular charge transfer band. The energetic gap between these latter orbitals is higher in the case of 7, 9 and 10, compared to the other compounds (Fig. 8b). It fits well with the experimental observations since these three molecules show the weakest absorption wavelength. The energy of the π-orbital remains mainly constant whereas the π-orbital is destabilized in the case of 7, 9 and 10. It is probably due to the donating effect of the methoxy or morpholine groups which are directly linked to the tetrazine ring. The experimental and calculated wavelengths do not fit very well because intramolecular charge transfer bands can be difficult to calculate precisely with standard programs.101

Organic solar cells
Knowing that the creation of an intramolecular charge transfer in the donor considerably improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell,102 we selected the compound 3 – which displays the highest intramolecular charge transfer band- to be tested as donor in an organic solar cell. Since donor 3 is weakly soluble in most common organic solvents, a donor/acceptor bilayer heterojunction solar cell structure was chosen. Donor 3 was first thermally evaporated (20 to 30 nm) on ITO substrates precoated with a 30 nm-PEDOT-PSS layer. Then fullerene C60 was evaporated on top on donor 3 (25 to 40 nm) to achieve a donor/acceptor planar heterojunction. The photovoltaic parameters have been measured under simulated solar illumination in AM 1.5 conditions at 100 mW cm−2. The influence of thermal annealing and of the donor and the C60 layers thicknesses on the photovoltaic performance has been investigated. The best results were obtained with a 20 nm-thick layer of 3 annealed at 150 °C and a 40 nm-thick layer of C60 (Fig. S18 and Table S12, ESI†). This device exhibits a short-circuit current density JSC of 2.0 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.26 V. This low voltage is quite far from the expected theoretical value of 1.2 V obtained by the formula:103VOC ≈ ELUMO(acceptor) − EHOMO(donor) − 0.3where 0.3 V is an empirical factor corresponding to the voltage loss due to the presence of ohmic contacts at both interfaces.104ELUMO and EHOMO were estimated from the cyclovoltammograms according to the formula.105ELUMO = −(E1/0onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.8)EHOMO = −(E0/−1onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.8)
Some voltage loss at interfaces can explain this value of 0.26 V. Moreover, the high dark saturation current observed in the devices also reduces VOC.106
A short-circuit current density of 2 mA cm−2 shows that excitons are actually generated and separated even if the energy difference ΔE of 0.1 eV between the LUMO of the donor 3 and the LUMO of the acceptor C60 is not sufficient for efficient charge separation. Furthermore, donor 3 absorbs at too low wavelengths to enable the collection of a large ratio of the solar spectrum, which results in a rather low JSC. However, this value is close to the 2.4 mA cm−2 obtained for a triphenylamine/tetracyanobutadiene-based D–A–D system.60 Combined with a fill-factor FF = 0.42, these results led to a PCE of 0.21% (Fig. 9).

While these first results are not as good as we could expect, some further improvement may be achieved through an optimization of the solar cell structure. For example the use of a bulk heterojunction may improve charge separation and the insertion of charge transport interlayers could improve VOC through the lowering of the dark saturation current.
Conclusions
In summary, symmetrical and unsymmetrical D–A–D π-conjugated systems based on a tetrazine unit as acceptor and triphenylamine moiety as donor have been synthesized. Some of these compounds exhibit strong absorption in the visible range due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band. We have shown that the covalent bridging of the tetrazine acceptor group by a phenyl, a thiophene or an alkyne linker represents an efficient synthetic approach for engineering the ICT and the LUMO energy level of donor triphenylamine materials based on dipolar small donor–acceptor molecules. Taking into account the simplicity of the devices used for photovoltaic evaluation, these preliminary results suggest that the use of a more advanced technology for the devices fabrication can be expected to lead to higher performance. Also, bulk heterojunction solar cells could be fabricated using the soluble compound 6 as donor.
Experimental part
Spectroscopic measurements
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer in 1 cm optical length quartz cuvettes. Cyclohexane, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofurane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxyde and ethanol (SDS, spectrometric grade) were used as solvents for absorption measurements.
Electrochemistry
Dichloromethane (SDS, HPLC grade) and electrolyte salts (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate from Fluka, puriss.) were used without further purification. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a three-electrode cell with a potentiostat (VersaSTAT4, Princeton Applied Research) driven by a PC. Carbon electrode disk (1 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode, whereas platinum wire and Ag+ (0.01 M in acetonitrile)/Ag were used, respectively, as the counter and reference electrodes. All the investigated solutions were deaerated by argon-bubbling for at least 2 min before performing the electrochemical measurements. The reference electrode was checked versus ferrocene as recommended by IUPAC.
Quantum chemical calculations
Calculations were performed at the MESO calculation centre of the ENS Cachan (Nec TX7 with 32 processors of type Itanium 2). Molecules were drawn with the Gaussview 03 software using included templates and their geometry optimized at the B3LYP/3-21g level of theory. Infrared spectra were calculated on the final geometry to ascertain that a minimum was obtained (no negative frequencies). Time-dependant density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations at the PBE0 level of theory with the 6-31+g(d) basis set were subsequently performed.
Synthesis
Reagents were commercially available from Aldrich and used without further purification. Column chromatography was performed with SDS 0.040–0.063 mm silica gel. All compounds were characterized by the usual analytical methods: 1H, 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL ECS (400 MHz) spectrometer. All chemical shifts are referenced to solvent peak (J values are given in Hz). Melting points were measured with a Kofler melting-point apparatus. IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Avatar 330 FT-IR spectrometer.
The compounds 22107, 2592,93 and 2897 were synthesized as already described.
General procedure for Stille cross-coupling
Dibromophenyltetrazine compound (1.0 eq., 0.1 M) and N,N-diphenyl-4-tributyltinaniline (1.1 eq. for monosubstitution and 3.0 eq. for disubstitution) were dissolved in toluene (for 1 and 2) or THF (for 3 and 4). [Pd(PPh3)4] (5 mol% for each substitution) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 10 hours (for 1 and 2) or 100 hours (for 3 and 4) under argon. 30 mL of a solution of potassium fluoride was added and the precipitate was removed by filtration on celite. The filtrate was extracted with diethylether (2 × 50 mL), the organic layer was washed with water (100 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate Na2SO4. The crude product was purified by a silicagel column chromatography to give an orange solid.
