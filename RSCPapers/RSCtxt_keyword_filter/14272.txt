Introduction
In the past several years, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (OILHPs) have attracted considerable attention, due to their striking photovoltaic conversion efficiency and their role in the optoelectronic field, including photovoltaics, lasers, and photodetectors.1–3 In particular, solar cells based on OILHPs exhibit a power conversion efficiency higher than 25.2% after only a few years of development.4 However, several studies have focused on all-inorganic lead halide perovskite, due to its resistance to moisture, oxygen, light, and heat, while it maintains its intriguing photoelectronic characteristics, such as long carrier lifetime, long diffusion length, and wavelength tunability.5–9 Cesium lead halide (CsPbBr3), with a direct bandgap of 2.27 eV at room temperature, is a typical all-inorganic lead halide perovskite.10 Moreover, it is considered as a prospective material in various optoelectronic applications due to its excellent light absorption properties and chemical stability.
Recently, many efforts have been devoted to investigating all-inorganic perovskite in solar cells, lasers, and photodetectors.11–13 The single-crystalline material based on the CsPbBr3 micro/nanoscale structure is an optimal candidate to expand the optoelectronic research branches focusing on lasers and photodetectors. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method without the use of solvents prevents the evolution of gain boundaries, surface defects, and groups in these materials. This may effectively enhance the carrier transport characteristics and the material stability as compared to the solution process.14–16 In order to grow high-quality perovskite single crystals, researchers have tried to fabricate perovskite nano/micro-structures via the CVD method, including nanoplates, nanowire networks, and nano/microrods.17,18 Chen and co-workers reported the preparation of horizontal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) nanowires and microwires via a vapor-phase epitaxial growth. The calculation of the on-to-off ratio of the wire photodetector reported a value of >103.19 Li et al. used the vapor transport deposition technique to prepare a high-quality CsPbCl3 microfilament network.20 The Ilight/Idark ratio of their device could reach up to 2.0 × 103 and showed a photoresponsivity of 14.3 mA W−1 and a fast response speed of 3.212/2.511 ms. Shoaib et al. prepared ultralong CsPbBr3 nanowires on annealed M-plane sapphire substrates by using the graphoepitaxial effect. They then fabricated photodetectors using CsPbBr3 nanowires.21 The photodetectors showed an ultrahigh responsivity of 4400 A W−1 and an ultrafast response speed of 252 μs. These pioneering studies demonstrated the high performance of photodetectors based on high-quality CsPbBr3 micro/nano-structures and have greatly promoted the development of novel high-performance all-inorganic perovskite photodetectors. However, until now, few studies were reported on the structure–activity performance of photodetectors based on CsPbBr3 micro/nano-structures. Furthermore, investigations on flexible all-inorganic perovskite photodetectors are significant for the development of perovskite optoelectronic devices.
In this work, high-quality single-crystalline microstructures, including microwires, microplates, and triangular pyramids, were synthesized via the micro-environment controlled CVD method. Upon the decrease of the deposition temperature, the discrepant morphology and the crystal quality of the microstructures were explored. Moreover, the structure–activity relationship between the material microstructures and the device properties is illustrated. The results indicate that CsPbBr3 microwire photodetectors possesses higher performance than microplates, due to their higher crystallization quality and the lower bulk defect density of the microwires. Moreover, the Fabry–Pérot cavity effect produced along the cross-sectional direction of the microwire facilitates the absorption of light, thus improving the performance of the microwire photodetector. In addition, flexible CsPbBr3 microwire photodetectors were demonstrated for the first time. The results show that their photocurrent can be maintained at 90% after 3000 cycles for a small bending radius. This study is of great significance for the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials.
Results and discussion
CsPbBr3 perovskite microstructures, including microwires, microplates, and triangular pyramids, were grown on mica substrates by using a one-step method in a home-built vapor transport CVD system (for more details refer to the Experimental section).22 The one-step experimental setup is presented in Fig. 1a. To synthesize microstructures, the tube furnace temperature was set within the 560–580 °C range. The mica substrates were placed inside the tube in zones with variable temperatures of 380 °C, 340 °C, and 300 °C. Upon the decrease of the deposition temperature, highly crystalline microwires, microplates, and triangular pyramids were formed on the mica substrates under an inert carrier argon gas atmosphere (Fig. 1a). When compared to the OILHPs, the CsPbBr3 all-inorganic perovskite without hydrophilic organic groups shows an excellent stability against moisture, oxygen, light, and heat. Fig. 1b presents CsPbBr3 microwires, which are characterized by a length up to several hundreds of micrometers. These samples were obtained in the high temperature zone (380 °C). The bulk of the microwires possesses a triangular cross-section, as the magnified image of the end facet of the wire shows in the inset of Fig. 1(b). The microwires exhibit very smooth surfaces, a triangular cross section, and a 60° angle at the intersection of two wires, denoting their excellent crystal quality. The nearby aluminosilicate mica sheets are limited by van der Waals attraction. Therefore, high-quality crystals were grown on the freshly stripped mica surface promoted by the epitaxial growth and then cleaved to obtain atomically smooth surfaces. The [001] direction of CsPbBr3 matches precisely the [010] direction of mica. The CsPbBr3 [110] direction shows instead a slight lattice mismatch along with the [100] direction of mica, leading to an epitaxial unlimited growth of the CsPbBr3 crystal along the [001] direction and a limitation in its width along the [110] one (Fig. S1, ESI†).23 The anisotropic growth of such surface-bound forms microwires. In a typical growth process, the dominant position is always occupied by the microwires, while the microplates and the pyramids are more scattered. Moreover, the surface morphology of the CsPbBr3 microplates, obtained in the 340 °C temperature zone, is highly smooth and flat, as shown in Fig. 1c. The typical thickness of the perovskite microplates measures hundreds of nanometers (Fig. S2†) and their length is about 100 μm. Two-dimensional microplates usually exhibit a (001) top surface and (100) and (010) side walls with the lowest surface energy for a low substrate temperature (Fig. S3†).24 Fig. S1 and S2† show the real spatial morphology of the microwire and microplate on mica, respectively. As for the microwire, the [001] direction of CsPbBr3 matches precisely the [010] direction of mica. The CsPbBr3 [110] direction shows instead a slight lattice mismatch along with the [100] direction of mica, leading to an epitaxial unlimited growth of the CsPbBr3 crystal along the [001] direction and a limitation in its width along the [110] one. Fig. S4† obviously demonstrates that two-dimensional microplates usually exhibit a (001) top surface and (100) and (010) side walls with the lowest surface energy for a low substrate temperature. In order to keep the balance of surface energy, CsPbBr3 expands on the mica substrate, and due to the homogeneous epitaxy, the molecule will grow preferentially in the original CsPbBr3, in agreement with a previous report.25 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1d, the crystals are characterized by a well-defined triangular pyramidal structure, when they are grown in the low temperature zone (300 °C). The inset shows the high-magnification SEM image of an individual triangular pyramid: its shape is determined by the crystalline structure of CsPbBr3. The three exposed facets of the pyramids are located on the (001) planes, and the lattice mismatch between the perovskite [111] and the mica substrates [001] is a significant factor (Fig. S4†).26Fig. 1b–d display the low- and high-magnification SEM images of the CsPbBr3 perovskite microstructures in different temperature regions: the samples present rather smooth surfaces and sharp edges, suggesting their excellent crystalline quality.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectral analyses for the three single crystal microstructure morphologies were carried out under identical conditions to investigate how the morphology affects the optical properties of the three CsPbBr3 microstructures (Fig. 2a). The results demonstrate that the microstructures exhibit a strong PL emission peak at 528 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16–18 nm, in agreement with previous studies.27 The PL spectra indicate the high-quality of the crystal microstructures. Moreover, the extraordinary PL intensity of the CsPbBr3 microwires is stronger than that of the microplates and pyramid samples, probably due to their higher crystallization quality and lower bulk defect density.28 Generally, for CVD-grown micro/nanoscale structures, the high growth temperature favors the formation of single crystals with high quality and low defect density. This results in a superior crystal quality of the microwire structures, which are grown in the high-temperature region. The Raman spectra (Fig. 2b) of the CsPbBr3 microstructures were also recorded. They were collected under the excitation of a 633 nm-source at room temperature. Three Raman peaks, which are located at 72, 126, 263, and 309 cm−1 (ref. 29), appear in the spectra: the peak located at 263 cm−1 corresponds to the mica substrate (Fig. S5†). As reported in previous work, the peaks at 72 and 127 cm−1 were assigned to the oscillation mode of the [PbBr6]4− octahedron and to the movement of the Cs+ cations.30 The low-intensity, wide band located at 309 cm−1 corresponds to the second-order phonon mode of the octahedron. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbBr3 microstructures are shown in Fig. S6.† The spectrum is in agreement with previously reported studies.19

CsPbBr3 is used as an ideal material in photodetectors, due to its high optical absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, and low density of defect states. In this work, a high-performance photodetector based on these microstructures was obtained. The pyramids were not used due to their peculiar shape. In order to explore the structure–activity relationship between the material microstructures and the device properties, the performance of the photodetectors based on the microwires and on the microplates was investigated under identical conditions. The schematic structures of the device composed of a single CsPbBr3 microwire/microplate photodetector are shown in Fig. 3a. The I–V curves of the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector (Fig. 3b) were measured in the dark and under illumination by using a 405 nm-source with a light power density in the 3–28 mW cm−2 range. Under illumination, the photocurrent rises sharply to 4.79 μA at 5 V, while the dark current measures 1.1 nA, demonstrating the linear and symmetric behavior of the I–V curves. This result demonstrates that an Ohmic contact between CsPbBr3 and Au electrodes was formed. Moreover, the I–V characteristic curve of a typical microplate photodetector was measured at the same wavelength (405 nm) and in the identical light intensity range (Fig. 3d). The photocurrent of the microplate photodetector rises sharply to 16.1 μA, whereas the dark current is ultralow (0.6 nA). As shown in Fig. 3b and d, the photocurrent increases dramatically upon the increase in the power intensity. This observation can be explained with the enhancement in the energy of the incident phonons and the formation of electron–hole pairs with an energy equal or larger than the band gap for a fixed voltage.

(e) Photocurrent and R value measured for the microplate photodetector. (f) The detectivity of photodetectors as a function of the wavelength for the CsPbBr3 microwire and microplate. The results shown in the (b–e) panels were obtained by using a light source emitting at 405 nm, with a power in the 3–28 mW cm−2 range and a bias of 5 V. 
The performance of the photodetector can be estimated by R and D*. The wavelength dependency of R can be described as follows:31 (1)where Ilight and Idark are the photocurrent and the dark current, P is the incident light power intensity, and S is the effective illuminated device area. Fig. 3(c) shows the responsivity (R) and photocurrent measured for a varying light intensity in the 3–28 mW cm−2 range at 405 nm. The CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector exhibits an Rmax of 312.2 A W−1. Moreover, the R value decreases upon the increase in the illumination power intensity. Fig. 3e shows that the Rmax of the microplate photodetector is equal to 1.74 A W−1.

D* is another key constant to estimate the detector sensitivity, which can be expressed as32 (2)where R is the responsivity, A is the effective area of the detector, Δf is the bandwidth, and in is the noise current. The comparison between the D* value of the microwire and of the microplate photodetector in the UV–Vis region is presented in Fig. 3f. The shot noise, which limits D*, in the photodetector is obtained. This value shows that the noise current is related to the current fluctuations and can be directly derived from the dark current: it measures 1.6 × 1013 Jones when a 405 nm source is used, while it is equal to 2.41 × 1012 Jones in the case of the microplate photodetector. The results indicate that the microwire-based photodetector has a higher detectivity than the microplate-based one. As one can notice from Fig. 3(b–e), the photocurrent of the microplate, Iph1 (1.6 × 10−5), is about 3.3 times higher than that of the microwire, Iph2 (4.8 × 10−6), for an identical excitation power of 28 mW cm−2. However, the microplate has an effective area 500 times larger than the microwire's, as shown in Fig. S7.† This indicates that no linear relationship exists between the photocurrent and the effective area and that the microwires have a higher photocurrent-effective area yield. This can be attributed to two possible reasons: (1) the excellent performance of the microwires depends on their higher crystallization quality and lower bulk defect density when compared to the microplates and (2) the micro-sized wires tend to produce the Fabry–Pérot cavity effect,11,33 which influences the excellent performance of the microwire-based devices. Fig. S8† shows the schematic of the Fabry–Pérot cavity, which is formed along the cross-sectional direction of the microwire. A distributed Bragg reflector was used to force the light wave to reflect back and forth in the cavity to form a stable standing wave field. This contributes to the absorption of light and in generating an increase in the photogenerated carriers, which lead to an enhancement in the photocurrent.
The photoresponse switching behavior of the microwire/microplate photodetector was measured at 5 V, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c). The on/off switching behavior was investigated for multiple cycles, and the values of Ilight and Idark were uniform as the reversible shift between the illuminated and dark states. The optimal Ilight/Idark ratio for the microwire and microplate photodetectors measures 6.57 × 103 and 5.72 × 104, respectively, upon illumination with a 405 nm-source emitting 28 mW cm−2. A fast response time is one of the key constants to evaluate the photodetector performance and it greatly expands the application range of such a device. The rise time (τ1) and the decay time (τ2) are defined as the time needed for 10% of the incipient current to increase to 90% of its peak value and vice versa. The response of the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector measured at 5 V is shown in Fig. 4a and its on/off switching behavior is reproducible for multiple cycles. Moreover, the response of the CsPbBr3 microplate photodetector measured under identical conditions is shown in Fig. 4c. The measured rise (τ1) and decay (τ2) times of the photodetector based on CsPbBr3 microwires are 20 ms and 5.8 ms, respectively (Fig. 4b). The microplate photodetector shows response times of 55 ms and 10 ms, respectively. The faster response times suggest that the photogenerated carriers were extracted more quickly in the CsPbBr3 microwire when compared to the microplate. In order to compare the properties of the CsPbBr3-based photodetectors, the crucial parameters of the previously reported studies are summarized in Table 1: the on/off ratio obtained in this study is in agreement with most reports and the responsivity is higher than that of any other CsPbBr3-based photodetector. Such high responsivity may be attributed to the high quality and the single crystal nature of the CsPbBr3 microstructures.

Due to the increasing consumer demand for handheld portable devices, the investigations on flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices have attracted significant attention.36 In order to study the flexibility and the photoresponse of the inorganic perovskite microwires, a photodetector was prepared on a thin mica substrate. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the photograph of such a flexible CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector. The device was bent at a fixed radius of 2.5 mm at a constant temperature of 25 °C and a humidity of 45%. Fig. 5a depicts its I–V characteristic curves in the dark and for a light power intensity of 28 mW cm−2. Fig. 5b shows the photocurrent variation when the photodetector is bent upon several bending cycles: the photocurrent remains 90% after 3000 cycles. These results indicate that the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector possess extraordinary flexibility and remarkable performance, which may greatly broaden its application domain, especially as a portable device.

Conclusions
In summary, CsPbBr3 microstructures for high quality photodetectors grown by using the micro-environment controlled CVD approach are reported. The structure–activity relationship between the material microstructures and the device properties was investigated. The results show that the microwire-based photodetectors possess higher performance as compared to the microplate-based ones. This has two possible explanations: (i) higher temperature during the growth process tends to accelerate the formation of CsPbBr3 microwires with higher crystallization quality and lower bulk defect density; and (ii) the Fabry–Pérot cavity effect facilitates the absorption of light, increasing the photogenerated carriers and thus improving the performance of the microwire photodetectors. The CsPbBr3 microwire-based photodetector shows high performance with an R value reaching 312.2 A W−1 and its D* value of 1.6 × 1013 Jones. Moreover, it has a fast response time of 5.8 ms. As compared to the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector, the CsPbBr3 microplate exhibits an R of 1.74 A W−1, a D* value of 2.41 × 1012 Jones, and a response time of 10 ms. Furthermore, the photocurrent maintains 90% of its value after 3000 cycles for a radius of 2.5 mm. High-performance CsPbBr3 photodetectors may be potentially matched with low-cost, large-scale production and photoelectronic applications.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 microwires, microplates and triangular pyramids
The CsPbBr3 perovskite microstructures were synthesized via a one-step approach using a single zone CVD system. A few samples of freshly air-cleaved muscovite mica substrates of 10 mm × 20 mm dimensions were located downstream of a quartz tube mounted in a furnace. An alumina boat loaded with a mixture of PbBr2 and CsBr powder was located inside the heating center of the quartz tube. The molar ratio of CsBr (Sigma):PbBr2 (Xi'an Baolaite) was set to 2:1. The quartz tube was initially evacuated by using a 50 sccm flow of high-purity Ar (99.999%) and kept at constant pressure. At this point, the furnace was heated up to a temperature in the 560–580 °C range for 20 min and then kept at a fixed temperature for 60 min. The CsPbBr3 microwires were grown at 380 °C, whereas the microplates and the pyramids were obtained at 340 °C and 300 °C, respectively. After the growth of the samples, the tube was let cool down to room temperature.
Device fabrication
Gold and silver (Au/Ag) electrodes (30/30 nm) were thermally evaporated on the microwires and on the microplates through a shadow mask with a channel width of 1000 μm and a channel length of 80 μm, respectively.
Measurements of the properties
All the samples were characterized under ambient conditions. The microstructure morphology and elemental analyses of CsPbBr3 were carried out via SEM (JSM-6490LV/JEOL, Japan). The steady-state PL spectra were obtained by using an enhanced charge coupled device detector (Witec, Alpha 300R, Germany). The Raman spectra were obtained by using an InVia detector (Qontor, England). The photodetector performance was tested via a probe station connected to a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. The experiment was conducted under ambient conditions characterized by a relative humidity of 35% and at room temperature (about 25 °C). A 365 nm light emitting diode (LED) lamp was used as the UV source. The illuminating source used was a microlaser with a wavelength in the 405–532 nm range. The optical power density was defined by inserting a series of attenuators between the light source and the samples.
