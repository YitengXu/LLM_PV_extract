    , Accepted 23rd October 2022First published on 25th October 2022AbstractSilver selenide (Ag2Se) is a ductile material with a low lattice thermal conductivity that can be a valuable substitute for both PbSe and Bi2Se3 for Pb toxicity free and Bi scarcity. However, its narrow band gap in bulk phase and low dopability for its monolayer form, limit the potential of Ag2Se as a practical energy converter. Whereas earlier halogenated Ag2Se studies show a greatly elevated Seebeck coefficient due to the broadened band gap, the approach yielded little improvement for the dopability of its monolayer. Motivated by the positive effects of lighter alkalis on optical and thermoelectric responses of semiconductors, the thermal stability, thermoelectric and luminescence properties of bulk and two-dimensional (2D) RbxAg1−xSe phases were comprehensively investigated using a global evolutionary algorithm and density functional theory (DFT), followed by semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism. The electronic structure and chemical bonding (COHP) results show that these structures are thermodynamically and mechanically stable for the entire Rb composition range, with a band gap that increases monotonically with Rb content, and is in the range of 1.41–2.75 eV within the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional, which demonstrates the possibility of their laboratory synthesis. Satisfactory optical absorption in the order of 104–105 cm−1 is seen spanning the visible and ultraviolet regions. The fundamentally low lattice thermal conductivity below 1.0 W m−1 K−1 throughout the temperature range studied is attributed to the complex structure and relatively low sound velocity. Under optimal hole concentration, their thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) and power factor (PF) can reach magnitudes of 0.6–1.0 and 0.68–24.2 mW m−1 K−2, respectively, between 300 and 1000 K. The monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 in particular stands out with its high ZT and improved dopability when compared to those of the monolayer Ag2Se. Comparison of the band edge positions with the redox potential of water indicates that the bulk Rb2Ag2Se2 phase exhibits satisfactory photocatalytic activity in seawater splitting. This work validates that the grinding together of stoichiometric quantities of Rb2Se and Ag2Se is an effective alternative for improving the dopability of monolayer Ag2Se and engineering RbxAg1−xSe, with focused characteristics to suit environmental conditions.
1. Introduction
With the extreme climates that are seen these days, managing energy resources is the priority of every government. Energy harvesting by a traditional process of burning fossil fuels is causing various environmental issues such as global warming, air pollution and severe flooding.1 As a result of the social and political turbulence associated with these negative effects, energy management has become one of the most discussed issues of the international environment and development agenda, among researchers and leaders. The goal set by the United Nations for challenging carbon neutrality by 2050, has drawn positive responses from more than 110 countries, with a global median of 54% making significant progress in developing and triggering the need to augment and improve existing renewable energy technologies, particularly thermoelectric (TE) power generators, solar photovoltaics, and hydropower, which can provide clean, dependable and abundant ways to generate electricity. Currently, there is a substantial amount of waste heat energy to salvage globally,2 and, in this circumstance, environment-friendly TE materials are appropriate alternatives because they operate by converting waste heat into practical net zero greenhouse gas emissions and electric energy. Therefore, these materials are expected to find use as power generators of electronic devices, and coolers or heaters of temperature control devices.
Generally, a promising TE material should demonstrate a large Seebeck constant (also known as thermopower, S), a reasonably high electrical conductivity (σ) and a low thermal conductivity (κ), which is made up of both electronic (κe) and lattice (κl) contributions. The previously mentioned characteristics are needed to increase the power factor (PF = S2σ) and dimensionless figure of merit ZT = (S2σT)/(κe + κL), which determine the power output capability and conversion ability, respectively. Because a higher ZT value is a measure of good TE performance, the aim is to discover commercially viable materials with a satisfactory ZT value, which preferably approach the benchmark value of unity. This includes augmenting the inter-reliant parameters such as the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity, which is laborious. The fact that most TE materials have a brittle nature3,4 and only present a high conversion efficiency at temperatures above 800 K, also makes them impractical for use in technological applications.5,6 Moreover, a large pool of competitive candidates possessing extraordinary ZT values are Pb-containing compounds.7–9 The ideal strategy to mitigate environmental damage and related ecological complications caused by the toxicity of these materials is by the replacement of Pb with non-toxic elements. Similarly, solar cell materials demonstrating a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25% and above are frequently in the form of a PbI-based perovskite. In short, the presence of lead is the main bottleneck due to its toxic nature, and the lethal threat it is poses to the ecosystem.10–12 More effective methods are needed for the investigation of Pb-free materials, and at the same time sufficient structural and chemical stability of the new Pb-free compounds under ambient conditions needs to be ensured. Over the years, different types of Pb-free materials have been studied for use solar and TE applications. For example, theoretical research has shown that some of the Pb-free double perovskites and fluoride perovskites are promising solar and TE materials.13–17 Another example is delafossite-based materials such as XMnO2 (X = Ag, Au, Cu), which are known to have good optical properties, and their specific heat capacity increases with temperature.18 Recently, a half-Heusler (HH) compound BCaGa was found to be an excellent TE material due to its low thermal conductivity and large power factor at certain carrier concentrations and temperatures.19
Over the years, a handful of 2D materials have been theoretically predicted and synthesised. Compared to bulk materials, low-dimensional materials could have larger ZT values ascribed to their lower thermal conductivity, which is due to the lower phonon boundary scattering, the quantum confinement effect and the dependency of their intrinsic energy on the density of states (DOS).20–24 For example, the scaling of a bulk single crystal of SnS2 to nanosheets results in an improvement of the ZT by a factor of 1000 at room temperature.25 Experimentally, a Cu2Se based thin film with an impressive PF of 11.12 μW cm−1 K−2 was reported at 275 °C.26 From the theoretical side, many Se-based monolayers have been predicted to be a good TE material. For example, the ZTs for monolayer ZrSe2, HfSe2, PdSe2 are calculated to be 0.87, 0.95 and 1.1, respectively, at 300 K.27,28 For monolayer SnSe2 and ZrI2, the maximum ZT is predicted to be 4.84 and 7.86, respectively, at 700 K.29,30 In some cases, the improved TE performance in metal chalcogenides is attributed to the widened band gap induced by a high S.31 Preparation of a monolayer Ag2Se from Cu2−xSe template films has also been realised via cation exchange at room temperature.32
Focusing on Ag2Se, this compound has gained increasing research interest due to its unique high ductility, intrinsically low κl and mechanical exfoliation.33,34 However, the narrow band gap feature in the bulk phase and low dopability trait in the monolayer phase restrict its potential. Fortunately, its optoelectronic properties have been shown to be controllable via halogenation.35 Also, a number of investigations have pointed towards the positive effect of Rb addition on the electronic properties of energy materials.36,37 In the work of Gu and Qu,38 a monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 has been reported. However, the work was carried out using ordered relaxation instead of random optimisation, where calculations within were performed by assuming that the relaxed lattice parameters adopted a fixed tetragonal structure, which is less than optimal. Whenever a new atom is added or replaced, a gradual relaxation scheme must start from a random structure.
These reasons prompted us to continue exploring ways that can boost the potential of materials incorporating conformable Ag2Se for multiple energy conversion applications. Using an evolutionary algorithm, three bulk phases and one monolayer RbxAg1−xSe phase were identified. With the information of compositional atoms arrangement, their intrinsic properties related to electronics, optics, vibration, photocatalysis and TE were systematically examined using first-principles calculations. Based on the results, the RbxAg1−xSe was found to possess a high stability, a high combined ZT and PF over a broad temperature range, a high absorption coefficient within the visible light domain, and an ability to split seawater to obtain hydrogen. Overall, the current work provides a fundamental understanding of the energy conversion properties of this scarcely explored compound, and accentuates its potential as a renewable energy technology, together with helpful compositional guidance that will expedite the design of more stable, ductile, Ag-based chalcogenide semiconductors.
2. Computational methods
An effective variable composition calculation of ternary bulk RbxAg1−xSe compounds was carried out on 4–8 and 8–16 atom sample sizes using the USPEX algorithm39–41 combined with a VASP enabled42,43 density functional theory (DFT) scheme via five consecutive relaxation procedures on each candidate structure, covering up to 16 atoms per unit cell, starting from cell shape and ionic position optimisations at 2π × 0.15 Å−1k-resolution and gradually switching to full optimisations with increasing convergence quality, where the final step was converged to within 10−5 eV under 2π × 0.04 Å−1k-point spacing. For steps 1–4, the ionic relaxations ended when all the forces dropped below the threshold of 0.01 eV Å−1. A Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with generalisation gradient approximations (PBE–GGA)44 with a projector augmented wave (PAW) setup was used for all the relaxation procedures. The Rb2Se and Ag2Se precursor structures (as shown in S1, ESI†) were added as seeds to mimic the reaction of these parent compounds by heating under vacuum followed by slow cooling, hence improving the screening reliability and efficiency. This approach is different from most theoretical research which produced new structures via a doping procedure. The population size for these ternary searches fluctuated between 20 and 60 structures, where upon optimisation of randomly generated structures in the first generation, offspring were produced and stored in the succeeding generation using the 60% fittest minimum energy structures by heredity (40%), random symmetric (30%) for diversifying the population, and transmutation (10%), soft mutation (10%) and lattice mutation (10%) variation parameters. This procedure was repeated cyclically until all the best structures stored, remained unchanged for 15 generations. In addition, a fixed composition search was performed for each stoichiometry on the convex hull which was obtained during the variable composition search.
An estimation of the electronic properties was performed using a generalised gradient approximation parameterised by PBE–GGA, which was later recalculated by means of HSE06.45 For the optical calculations, a dense 20 × 20 × 20 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid was used. Electrical transport coefficients were calculated by solving the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using the BoltzTraP software46 with a similar dense k-mesh setting, based on the rigid band regime, and the relaxation time (τ) estimated from deformation potential theory,47 which considers the acoustic phonon scattering mechanisms by: (1) (2)where C, kB, ħ, m and ED are the specific plane stiffness, the Boltzmann constant, a reduced Planck's constant, geometric average of the effective mass along the x (armchair) and y (zigzag) directions, and deformation potential, respectively. Acoustic phonon scattering is generally the major carrier scattering mechanism due to the fact that the wavelength of a thermal electron sits within the lattice constant scale. The difference between PBE and the HSE06 computed band gaps (scissor factor) was added into these two procedures (see S5, ESI†). The important κl was calculated using Slack's equation:48 (3)where γ, V, , n, ΘD and kB represent the Grüneisen parameter, volume per atom in Angstroms, average atomic mass in amu, atoms per unit cell, Debye temperature and Boltzmann constant, respectively. The thermal stability of each stable phase was examined using the Nosé thermostat algorithm within the ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulation,49 under a 300 K temperature for 10 ps with a 1 fs interval time. For the monolayer phase, the force constants were evaluated by applying density generalised perturbation theory (DFPT) to a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, under a strict convergence criterion of 10−8 eV. The obtained phonon spectra were later obtained by processing the atomic forces with the PHONOPY software.50
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Stability and electronic structure of the RbxAg1−xSe phases
Enthalpy of formation, ΔH, per atom of each stable bulk phase under ambient pressure was evaluated as: ΔH(RbxAg1−xSe) = E(RbxAg1−xSe) − [E(Rb2Se) + E(Ag2Se)](4)where E refers to the total energy of the resultant compound and the binary parent block. As shown in Fig. 1, a convex hull plot, was constructed by plotting ΔH per atom for each fit structure based on enthalpy against the ratio of Ag2Se/(Ag2Se + Rb2Se), and three low-lying energy bulk structures were identified, namely the global minimum orthorhombic Rb2Ag2Se2, metastable triclinic Rb2Ag6Se4 and trigonal Rb6Ag2Se4 phases. The theoretically predicted Rb6Ag2Se4 structure was precisely identical to the one discovered by Wang et al.51 using a high-throughput approach, which indicating the reliability of the theoretical method used for structure prediction, but with a much higher formation enthalpy compared to those of the Rb2Ag2Se2 and Rb2Ag6Se4 phases. For the 2D RbxAg1−xSe screening, each of the identified bulk phases underwent fixed composition calculations with a 3 Å thickness confinement and a 20 Å vacuum size added, mirroring the exfoliation of the monolayer from the bulk system. The setting for variation operators was similar to those applied for bulk structure screening. Among the three bulk phases, only Rb2Ag2Se2 yielded a negative enthalpy 2D counterpart. Their crystallographic information is listed in S1 (ESI†).

The projected DOS plots shown in Fig. 2 reveal a relatively small contribution from the Rb states, which confirms their similarity with the results of an earlier report on Rb-based compounds.36 The peak of the Rb-p orbital was observed between −10.0 and −12.0 eV, and formed a weak hybridisation with the Se-s states. The Ag-d states were seen to occupy larger bands in the range of −3.0 to −5.0 eV, whereas the valence edge was derived from the hybridised Ag-d and Se-p orbitals, which contributed to the formation of covalent Ag–Se bonds. A strong band convergence or overlap between heavy- and light-hole bands near the Fermi level was noted for these structures, where the gap in energy between valence bands with heavy and light effective masses was reduced by the Rb2Se/Ag2Se alloying. As a result, their DOS near the valence band maximum (VBM) was larger than the one around the conduction band maximum (CBM), which indicated a higher population of holes near the VBM and an increasing of the S of the p-type compounds. Overall, increasing the Rb content caused the DOS to show a right shift trend.

The calculated band gaps for bulk phase Rb2Ag2Se2, Rb2Ag6Se4, Rb6Ag2Se4 and monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 after correction to the self-interaction error using the HSE06 scheme were 2.63, 1.41, 2.75 and 2.62 eV, respectively. These band gaps were broader than several good TE materials such as BiSe (1.67 eV) and SnSe (1.28 eV),52,53 and thus had a higher tolerance to the bipolar conduction effect, which typically occurred at a high temperature and may degrade the TE performance. From the photovoltaic viewpoint, the band gaps obtained were smaller than those measured for large band gap materials with the presented photovoltaic application, namely, titanium dioxide nanomaterials.54,55 Due to the indirect band gap nature, bulk phase Rb2Ag2Se2 and Rb2Ag6Se4 can be made thicker to allow more absorption of incoming photons. In short, the construction of solar cells from direct or indirect materials relied on a delicate balancing act between optical absorption, achieved by varying the thickness and the carrier collection.
The mechanical properties of the RbxAg1−xSe compounds were evaluated by means of second order elastic constants, determined by linear fitting of the stress–strain curves and applying ±1%, ±2% strains to each primitive cell studied. The calculated elastic stiffness parameters of each structure, listed in Table 1, were found to satisfy their respective stability constraints based on the Born–Huang theory,56 described as follows:

According to Pugh's rule,57 the plasticity behaviour of materials can also be estimated by the value of the B/G ratio. If B/G > 1.75, a material exhibits ductility. In reverse, a solid displays brittleness when B/G < 1.75. From Table 1, it can be seen that the calculated B/G ratio of bulk phase RbxAg1−xSe is larger than 1.75, once again confirming its ductile performance and conforming to υ > 0.2658 obtained for bulk structures. Increasing the Rb content appears to reduce the ductility. Thus, the ductility was improved when stronger hybridisation between the Ag and Se atoms is present, as demonstrated by the electronic structure and chemical bonding. This explains the reason behind the higher υ, and hence the marginally better ductility for pristine Ag2Se.33 As illustrated in Fig. 3, the results from the NVT ensemble lattice dynamics calculations indicated that the change in total energies between the initial and final structures was confined to a mere 0.04 eV, without any noticeable structural reconstructions after 10 ps, which implied the absence of phase transition for these structures at 300 K, and the studied materials were thermally stable at room temperature. Another crucial attribute of the newly predicted 2D structures which was used specify the prospects of their application in technological areas, was dynamic stability.

If a system contains N number of atoms in the unit cell, then there are always 3N number of phonon modes present in the system. As shown in Fig. 4, the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 with six atoms per unit cell has 18 phonon modes. An absence of negative modes along the high symmetry direction in the complete Brillouin zone (BZ) confirmed its dynamic stability and its potential to be realised experimentally. The phonon DOS in Fig. 4 clearly indicated that the acoustic branches were driven by the vibration of Ag atoms with a lesser contribution from the Rb and Se atoms, individually. The low optical branches arose from the Rb atom hybridising with the Ag atom whereas the lightest Se atom dominated the intermediate to high frequency region, with some Ag modes appearing conjointly. In particular, the peak frequencies of the acoustic and optical branches (∼5 and 33 meV) were inferior to those measured for isostructural materials such as TiNX (X = Br, Cl, F) (∼20 and 50 meV),59 which have been reported to exhibit weak phonon harmonic vibrations. The less dispersive low-energy optical phonon branches reflected the weak bonding associated with the weakly bonded Ag atoms in those modes. The feature of relatively flat bands, mixing with acoustic phonons has been shown to be very efficient in reducing the κl of the crystalline solids.60 The latter creates several scattering routes through which phonons can be scattered, thereby lowering the κl. In addition, the feature of high frequency optical phonon branch flattening was also observed in the vicinity of the Γ point. This implied that the group velocities of high frequency optical phonon modes were insignificant.
 Fig. 4  The phonon dispersion plot for the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 phase, which does not contain negative frequencies, indicating adequate dynamic stability. 
Thus, the group velocities of the acoustic phonon modes can be deduced to be the main contributor of sound velocity, which was evaluated by solving the equation based on the computed elastic moduli, and transverse and longitudinal acoustic velocities. The formulations used are described in S3 (ESI†). The low average sound velocity of ∼1800 m s−1 in bulk structures (listed in Table 1) is a synergistic result of a low Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G), Debye temperature (ΘD), and large Grüneisen parameters (γ). In accordance with the incredibly low Debye temperature (under 150 K), all the phases studied were expected to exhibit weak bond stiffness, and thus an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity below 1.0 W m−1 K−1. Using a crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method61,62 which yielded the localised basis set from plane wave functions transformation obtained using VASP, and bonding environments for bulk phase and 2D RbxAg1−xSe were also determined. This approach reallocated the electronic band energies of a structure into different pairs of orbital or atomic interactions, thus, enabling a crucial indication of the chemical bonds and their associated strengths within a structure to be revealed. Hypothetically, a positive value of –pCOHP implied the bonding interaction, whereas the antibonding state was denoted by the negative one. It is evident from Fig. 5, that the absence of antibonding states crossing the EF implies that there is sufficient electronic stability in these compounds.
 Fig. 5  (a) Total COHP of Ag–Se, Rb–Se, Ag–Rb and Ag–Ag, (b) Orbital resolved averaged COHP of Ag–Se. 
Within the vicinity below EF, the interactions between Ag(d) and Se(p) orbitals have negative –pCOHP values, which were indicative of the antibonding states. Interestingly, from −5 to −1 eV, it was also observed that the Ag(s)–Se(p) and Ag(d)–Se(p) orbital interactions present positive –pCOHP, thus stabilising the electronic structure via formation of bonding states. Hence, the covalent bond formed by Ag and Se was the driving force behind the stronger phonon anharmonicity and the ultimate low κl. Analysis of their integrated COHP (ICOHP), was obtained using:  and is an imperative measure for bond strength assessment, and additionally signifies robust bonding strength as the computed ICOHP for all the compounds studied had large negative values (see Table 2).

3.2 Dielectric and luminescence properties
The frequency dependent dielectric functions, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) of the bulk and 2D phases of Rb–Ag–Se phases, respectively, are shown in Fig. 6. The real part ε1(ω) was determined by application of the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relationship63–66 on the imaginary part ε2(ω). Important optical properties such as refractive index n(ω) and α(ω) absorption coefficient were then calculated using the knowledge of the imaginary part ε2(ω) and the real part ε1(ω) of the dielectric function, as follows: (5) (6)
 Fig. 6  Real part ε1(ω) and imaginary part ε2(ω) of the calculated dielectric functions, absorption coefficient α(ω) and refractive index n(ω) as a function of energy for the bulk phases of (a) Rb2Ag2Se2, (b) Rb2Ag6Se4, (c) Rb6Ag2Se4, and (d) the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 phases, at the random phase approximation (RPA) level with local field effects. 
For the bulk phases, values of ε1(ω) at zero energy, range from 4.34 to 6.53 and agreed with Penn's equation where ε1(ω) ≈ 1 + (ħωp/Eg)267 and p denotes the plasma frequency. For the ε2(ω) spectra, it is worth noting that the peak detected first is located away from zero energy, which confirmed the absence of energy states at EF, and a semiconducting nature in all the phases studied. Absorption in the visible light zone was characterised by the integral value of ε2(ω) with a range between 1.59 eV ≤ ω ≤ 3.26 eV. Focussing on ε2(ω), the absorption in the visible region typically diminished with an increase in the amount of Rb, which signified an improvement of the transparency in the visible region by the Rb substitution. High transparency inside the visible region is a desirable characteristic for solar control films and glass applications. It was evident that the α(ω) for bulk phases of Rb2Ag2Se2, Rb2Ag6Se4 and Rb6Ag2Se4 phases could achieve 105 cm−1 order in the visible light range, which intensified as the Rb content was reduced, and it was considerably higher than that measured for Rb2Ag2Se2 monolayer counterpart.
3.3 Thermoelectric properties
Relaxation time and carrier mobility are two parameters which have a strong influence on the electronic transport dependence of the TE properties. Upon obtaining the τ, the μ can be estimated from μ = eτ/m*, where m* is the effective mass in the transport direction. The deformation potential constant (ED), which is expressible by the second derivative of the energy near the VBM or the CBM, is shown in S2 (ESI†). The E(eV) is the total energy of the unit cell, whereas Δx/x and Δy/y are the uniaxial relative strain variable, with a value ranging from −4% to 4%, and a step size of 2% at 300K. Values of Cij in Table 1, and ED were substituted into eqn (1) and (2) to estimate the value of τ for each studied structure. For the Rb2Ag2Se2 monolayer, the large difference between its C11 and C22 indicated the presence of anisotropy, and thus a modified model68 which combined various anisotropic factors was employed instead: (7)

Fig. 7 illustrates the lattice and total thermal conductivities as a function of temperature. Whereas the depletion of Rb leads to a further reduction of κL in Rb2Ag6Se4, its κ is the highest all the bulk compounds due to the decline of band degeneracy and DOS in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which increased the electrical conductivity slightly, and subsequently the electronic thermal conductivity (κe). In contrast, the process of alloying Ag2Se with Rb significantly increased the Seebeck coefficient, causing the σ and κe to decrease because the Rb addition raised the DOS near the Fermi level and elevated the effective mass of holes substantially. These trends were consistent with the computed carrier mobility (μ) shown in Table 3, where the measured μ for Rb2Ag6Se4 was the highest whereas the Rb6Ag2Se4 had the lowest hole μ. Overall, the κL remained ultralow upon alloying with Rb but at the expense of μ, thus making the TE performance to be highly dependent on S.

As shown in Fig. 8, the quantified positive S indicated that all the considered samples were indeed p-type semiconductors, and the S profile of all studied structures fluctuated considerably with temperature, thus adopting a positive value above room temperature that declined dramatically as the temperature rose, producing an asymmetrical shape that stabilises under certain higher levels of doping, denoting a bipolar effect tolerance. Although the PF of Ag-rich Rb2Ag6Se4 was several orders of magnitude higher than that of other phases, its average ZT of 0.65 at the ideal doping level was the lowest among the bulk structures due to its significantly higher electronic thermal conductivity (κe), albeit corresponding to an ∼80% improvement when compared to that of the doped bulk phase Ag2Se. The superior PF was related to its comparatively higher μ and multi-energy valley formation, which enhanced the number of conducting channels and lead to a superior electron transport performance. For the Rb2Ag2Se2 phase, reducing its dimensionality from the bulk to the monolayer could significantly decrease the m and ED of the holes, that improving its p-type nature TE performance. Upon optimal doping, bulk phase of Rb6Ag2Se4 and monolayer phase of Rb2Ag2Se2 displayed a coexistence of ZT around unity over a wide temperature range and a reasonable PF, particularly the latter which showed PF > 2.5 mW m−1 K−1 above a medium temperature, which was comparable to the typical good thermoelectric GeTe69 and surpassing WSe2 (0.8 at 1200 K)70 plus GeSb (0.7 at 700 K).71

3.4 Photocatalytic chance for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions
Developing materials with satisfactory hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is another crucial aspect required to progress the use of multifunctional renewable energy technologies. Using water electrolysis, these processes can lead to an effective conversion of hydrogen to electrical power. Presently, state-of-the-art catalysts such as the enhanced iridium-based and platinum-based compounds are widely used for catalysing these processes. However, the use of comparatively critical catalysts is detrimental to large-scale production because of their high cost and susceptibility to supply fluctuations. This section explores the applicability of RbxAg1−xSe as alternative precious-metal free catalysts. For bulk structures, calculations of the band edge position were carried out via the following formulations: ECBM = χ − EH − 0.5Eg(8) EVBM = ECBM + Eg(9)in which EH is the free electron energy on the scale of hydrogen, and χ represents the Mulliken electronegativity of the studied compound, computed using: χ(RbaAgbSec) = [χ(Rb)a × χ(Ag)b × χ(Se)c]1/(a+b+c)(10)where a, b and c are the number of atom types per unit cell, whereas χ for each element was retrieved from ref. 72, and listed in Table 4. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the negative values of the CBM potentials for all RbxAg1−xSe approved the viability of H+ to H2 reduction, with Rb6Ag2Se4 showing the strongest HER due to its most negative CBM position.

 Fig. 9  Calculated potentials of the band edges for bulk (a) Rb2Ag2Se2, (b) Rb2Ag6Se4 and (c) Rb6Ag2Se4 phases via the Mulliken electronegativity method on the natural hydrogen electrode potential scale. For (d) the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 phase, the location of the band edge was determined using the HSE06 functional and vacuum level as the energy reference. By averaging the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the monolayer surface, the vacuum level can be determined (see S4, ESI†). 
However, all the bulk RbxAg1−xSe phases had a VBM displaying more negative values than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O, resulting in the absence of an OER. A similar trait was also observed for the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 phase. Interestingly, by considering standard redox potentials at pH = 7, in which the oxidation and reduction potentials were raised by EO2/H2O = −5.67 eV + pH × 0.059 eV and EH+/H2 = −4.44 eV + pH × 0.059 eV, the bulk phase of Rb2Ag2Se2 has a VBM which nearly coincides with the oxidation potential at pH = 7. Therefore, upon slight strain engineering, the bulk Rb2Ag2Se2 phase could be a potential material for use with water splitting (at pH = 7) or be readily used for seawater splitting (pH value = ∼8) under the irradiation of sunlight.
4. Conclusion
In this work, using an evolutionary algorithm and first-principles calculations, several ductile RbxAg1−xSe phases with sufficient thermal stability and reasonable thermoelectric–photovoltaic properties are revealed. The effect of alloying and electron–phonon scattering on the thermoelectric performance of the stable phases identified are explored using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism incorporating the carrier lifetime. The coupling between low-energy anharmonic optical modes and heat-carrying acoustic phonons, in addition to the existence of high Grüneisen parameters, low group velocity and Debye temperature are accountable for the intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. The elevated Seebeck coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity resulted in a peak ZT ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 in a low-medium temperature region. The absorption coefficient of 104–105 cm−1 attained within the visible-ultraviolet spectrum proves their potential use as photovoltaic devices. Upon strain engineering, the bulk phase of Rb2Ag2Se2 have the potential to perform redox reactions of water splitting at pH = 7 or alternatively it can be implemented on seawater of pH = ∼8. The idea of having a solar-driven photocatalytic composite for green seawater splitting is a promising process due to the unlimited seawater supply. The structure–property relationships of this scarcely explored system are expected to provide operational possibilities for experimental teams when designing devices with specific phenomenal characteristics.

 	Fig. 9  Calculated potentials of the band edges for bulk (a) Rb2Ag2Se2, (b) Rb2Ag6Se4 and (c) Rb6Ag2Se4 phases via the Mulliken electronegativity method on the natural hydrogen electrode potential scale. For (d) the monolayer Rb2Ag2Se2 phase, the location of the band edge was determined using the HSE06 functional and vacuum level as the energy reference. By averaging the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the monolayer surface, the vacuum level can be determined (see S4, ESI†).
