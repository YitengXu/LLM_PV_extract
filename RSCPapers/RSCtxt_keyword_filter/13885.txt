    , Accepted 16th November 2017First published on 16th November 2017AbstractAlthough perovskite solar cells have achieved extremely high performance in just a few years, their device stability and fabrication cost are still of great concern. For inverted p–i–n perovskite solar cells, the commonly used electron-transporting layers are C60 and PCBM, which have stability issues and are very expensive. Here, we report a novel and highly stable perovskite solar cell using an inorganic electron-transporting layer made of microwave-assisted solution-processed indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) nanoparticles. With NiO as the hole-transporting layer, the perovskite solar cells with all-inorganic selective contacts demonstrate a decent power conversion efficiency of over 16%. More importantly, the IZO-based perovskite solar cells demonstrate impressive long-term stability under air or light-soaking conditions. With encapsulation, our device retained 85% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 460 hours of light soaking. This result reveals that good device performance, low fabrication cost and impressive light-soaking stability can be realized simultaneously by employing facile microwave-synthesized oxides (IZO and NiO in this work) as inorganic selective contacts.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells have received increasing attention since their initial report by Prof. Miyasaka in 2009.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite devices has increased from 3.9% to over 20%.2–5 The advantages of perovskite materials for achieving impressive photovoltaic performance are strong absorption coefficient, low excitation binding energy, long carrier diffusion length, and tunable band gap.6–9 To optimize device performance and stability, past research has focused on the perovskite composition, additive doping materials, different precursors for perovskite film formation, and alternative charge-transporting layers.3,10–14 In most perovskite solar cells, low-temperature procedures with mild chemistry are applied to deposit organic selective-contact materials (Spiro-OMeTAD, PCBM or C60) on top of the perovskite active layer. This is due to the vulnerability of perovskite thin films to high-temperature processes and polar solvents, which make the subsequent deposition of inorganic materials on perovskite absorbers challenging. However, these organic materials are not the best choice for device stability. Therefore, identifying inorganic hole-transporting layers (HTLs) and electron-transporting layers (ETLs) is crucial to producing highly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells. The charge-transporting material should have the following characteristics: high carrier mobility; appropriate energy-band level that matches that of the perovskite absorber for hole or electron injection; and ability to form uniform and dense thin layers with stability. Several new types of inorganic materials for charge-transporting layers have already demonstrated excellent performance. Nickel oxide (NiO) thin films and mesoporous structures with suitable energy levels for hole injection and great stability have been employed in inverted perovskite solar cells.12,15 Wang et al. first incorporated nickel oxide nanoparticles as p–i–n heterojunction solar cells and achieved a PCE of 9.51%.16 Tian et al. reported that the NiO electrode is a p-type perovskite-sensitized solar cell.17 Since then, NiO has received considerable attention and been successfully applied in mesoporous and planar perovskite solar cells.12,18,19 Moreover, Cu2O, CuO, CuGaO and CuSCN have been employed as novel hole-transporting layers in perovskite solar cells.20–24 For ETLs, Han et al. reported that coating the PCBM layer with an Nb-doped TiOx inorganic transport layer enhances charge-extraction ability and device stability. They fabricated a large-scale perovskite device with an aperture size of 1.02 cm2 and achieved 16.2% PCE with a degradation of less than 10% of the initial PCE under light-soaking conditions for up to 1000 hours.25 The ETL metal oxides mentioned above are fabricated via low-temperature solution processes, as is necessary for application in the PCBM/perovskite layer. Similarly, Savva et al. showed that another doped n-type oxide, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), on PC70BM improved the ambient stability.26 Zhu et al. demonstrated crystalline SnO2/C60 as an efficient ETL with very high efficiency and device stability.27 Recently, Liu et al. reported a high PCE and great ambient stability when PCBM layers were capped with Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles.28 The above-mentioned studies combined fullerene derivatives with oxides as ETLs to improve the stability. However, C60 and other fullerene derivatives are expensive and have stability concerns that should be addressed before commercialization. Devices using fully inorganic selective contacts without any organic ETL or HTL constituents (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD and fullerene derivatives) are very limited in the literature. Prof. Yang et al. reported perovskite solar cells with all-inorganic interfaces using zinc oxide (ZnO) as an n-type ETL. The device had a PCE of 16.1% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after 60 days of storage in the dark at room temperature.12 This indicated the potential for obtaining stable devices by constructing all-inorganic layers as selective contact materials for perovskite solar cells.
In this work, we further demonstrate that the stability under light soaking can be achieved using all-inorganic selective contact materials. Indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) nanoparticles synthesized by microwave-assisted methods can be well dispersed and deposited on top of the perovskite layer with appropriate solvent exchange. The perovskite active layer was sandwiched with all-inorganic interfaces between NiO and IZO in an inverted configuration via low-temperature spin coating. The IZO film showed high mobility (17 cm2 V−1 s−1), high transparency, and thermal stability for application in thin-film transistors and organic solar cells.29–32 Moreover, the suitable energy level of IZO matched that of the perovskite layer for electron injection and hole blocking. Therefore, we selected IZO as new n-type ETL for perovskite solar cells. Both amorphous and crystalline IZO are often used in photovoltaic devices with high mobility and transmittance. Due to its high transparency in the near-IR region, IZO thin films have been applied as transparent conducting layers in perovskite solar cells, especially for tandem designs. For bifacial transparent devices or tandem applications, amorphous IZO films are commonly deposited using sputter techniques with high power and/or high temperature,33 which could damage the perovskite active layer.34,35 A buffer layer such as MoOx is usually required to allow the deposition of IZO on soft materials like Spiro-MeOTAD. There has only been one report of the direct deposition of TCO on top of perovskite using a hydrogenated indium oxide (In2O3:H) layer by RF sputtering, which resulted in a moderate PCE of 10.1%.36 In this study, for the first time, IZO nanocrystals are used as a mesoscopic selective contact layer (instead of an electrode) for perovskite solar cells.
Another requirement is to use a solvent that has selective solubility between perovskite and oxide materials. Therefore, we tried to synthesize crystalline IZO nanoparticles and disperse them into IPA solvent (which does not dissolve perovskite) for spin coating on the perovskite layer using a low-temperature process.
Our device has the following components: FTO, NiOx film, mesoporous NiO, perovskite, IZO nanoparticle, and Al. These transporting metal oxide layers provide better intrinsic material stability and effectively protect the perovskite layer against moisture to enhance the lifetime of the device. The device delivered a power conversion efficiency of 16.2% with a Voc of 1.02 V, Jsc of 22.86 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 69.43%. More importantly, the device demonstrated excellent stability in ambient air and under light soaking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the direct deposition of an inverted perovskite solar cell with all-inorganic contacts, decent PCE and impressive light-soaking stability.
Results and discussion
IZO nanoparticles were synthesized via a microwave-assisted method. Zinc acetate (Aldrich, 99.99%) and indium chloride (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) were mixed in benzyl alcohol and subjected to a two-step heating process at 120 °C and 160 °C. Fig. 1a presents a schematic showing the process used to synthesize IZO. The precursor solution was processed stepwise at 120 °C and 160 °C, resulting in transparent and yellow-colored solutions, respectively. After the microwave-assisted reaction, the benzyl alcohol solvent was replaced with 2-propanol because benzyl alcohol would erode the perovskite active layer. The detailed synthetic procedure is described in the Methods section.

Deconvolution was performed in (d); the red line shows the raw data, the black line presents the combined fitting curves, the blue line presents the fitting curve of peak at 529.7 eV, the pink line presents the fitting curve of the peak at 530.7 eV, and the orange line presents the fitting curve of the peak at 531.9 eV. 
To confirm the incorporation of indium into the zinc oxide structure, the chemical composition was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a broad survey scan (Fig. S1†). All the signals were calibrated with C 1s at 285 eV. Binding energies of Zn 2p, In 3d, and O 1s were observed and are shown in Fig. 1b–d. The binding energy of narrow peaks at 444.3, 452.0, 1021.2, and 1044.2 eV for the nanoparticle layer consisting of ZnO doped with 5% indium (5% IZO) can be assigned to In 3d3/2, In 3d5/2, Zn 2p1/2, and Zn 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 1b and c).37 The In 3d3/2 signal at 444.3 eV agrees with the In2O3 signal, demonstrating the successful incorporation of indium into the ZnO matrix.38 The peak center of the O 1s signal at 530.2 eV (Fig. 1d) is asymmetrical, which indicates the involvement of oxygen with a different chemical shift. We deconvoluted the O 1s signal to study the detailed bonding environment in the IZO nanoparticles. Three deconvoluted peaks can be observed at 529.7, 530.7, and 531.9 eV, where the lowest binding energy (529.7 eV) corresponds to metal–oxide bonding (e.g., Zn–O and In–O). The peak at 530.7 eV is assigned to the vacancy site of oxygen, and the peak at 531.9 eV corresponds to the hydroxyl group with metal–OH binding.12,32,39
The UV-vis spectra for ZnO and 5% IZO are shown in Fig. 2a. The onset of absorption of the 5% IZO sample is slightly red-shifted from 380 to 385 nm due to indium doping.40 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnO and 5% IZO nanoparticle powders are shown in Fig. 2b to evaluate crystallinity. The characteristic peaks for ZnO at 31.68°, 34.47°, and 36.09° correspond to the (100), (002), and (110) crystal planes, respectively. This indicates that the indium-doped ZnO formed by the microwave-assisted method maintained the hexagonal wurtzite structure and polycrystalline phase.41 After indium was doped into ZnO, the XRD peak of the (002) plane was significantly reduced in intensity. This agrees with a previous report suggesting a decrease in crystallinity.42

Band alignment between the In-doped zinc oxide ETL and the perovskite active layer is crucial for carrier transport to the electrode. Baena et al. reported that a mismatch in band alignment influences device performance by energetically hindering carrier injection.43 We conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy to measure the energy level of the IZO nanoparticle coating on an FTO substrate. The work function level and valence band level were calculated by subtracting the Fermi level from the vacuum energy level. The onset of the Fermi level is shown in Fig. S2.† The work function and valence band of IZO were calculated as ∼4 eV and ∼7.6 eV versus vacuum, respectively. Therefore, we could calculate the conduction band level as Econduction = Evalence + Eg (bandgap), which is approximately −4.3 eV. The energy profile for the perovskite device with all-inorganic selective contacts is illustrated in Fig. 3a and indicates favorable band alignment for electron and hole extraction. To further investigate the electron-injection ability from the perovskite active layer to the IZO nanoparticles, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was employed to measure free-carrier quenching (Fig. 3b). The PL signal of the pure perovskite layer (labeled as PSK in Fig. 3b) exhibits a strong and sharp fluorescence peak, which is characteristic of a high-quality perovskite film. Significant quenching is observed upon the deposition of the IZO nanoparticle layer onto the perovskite layer (labeled as PSK with IZO in Fig. 3b), which implies effective carrier injection to the IZO nanoparticle layer.

The device configuration of the inverted perovskite solar cell with all-inorganic selective contacts is shown in Fig. 4a. In this structure, the compact NiOx layer combines mesoporous NiO and IZO nanoparticles, which are employed as the hole-transporting and electron-transporting layers, respectively. The perovskite active area is sandwiched between the all-inorganic interfaces of the charge-selective layers. The thicknesses of the sputtered NiOx film and mesoporous NiO seriously affect device performance because of the low conductivity of NiO. Therefore, an optimized sputtered film and lithium-doped mesoporous NiO are necessary for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In our work, we used a 10 nm-thick NiOx film with 50 nm of Li-doped mesoporous NiO as the efficient hole-extraction layer. The transmittance of the NiO substrate is presented in Fig. S3;† the substrate shows a high transmittance of over 90% in the visible region and more transparency in comparison with n-type TiO2 substrates. The high transmittance enhances the photocurrent by harvesting more photons with the perovskite active layer. Moreover, the suitable energy level for NiO and IZO at 5.3 eV and 4.3 eV forms a perfect selective layer for charge collection. To test the device performance, we fabricated the perovskite active layer by adopting triple-cation perovskite with a precursor composition of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17))0.95, which is a state-of-the-art perovskite composition for solar cells with PCE > 21% in n-type perovskite devices.4 The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite active layer is shown in Fig. S4.† The image shows that homogeneous grains and a pinhole-free surface formed on the mesoporous NiO layer. The XRD pattern of triple-cation perovskite on the mesoporous NiO substrate is illustrated in Fig. S5.† The pattern shows the typical signal of tetragonal perovskite (2 theta = 14°) without any signal of the photo-inactive FAPbI3 phase. The sharp and strong signal of the perovskite (110) plane indicates a high degree of perovskite crystallinity, which is required for high-performance perovskite solar cells. The excess PbI2 in our perovskite film indicated in the XRD pattern is beneficial for promoting device performance.44,45

The cross-sectional SEM image of the IZO nanoparticle device is illustrated in Fig. 4b, where the thicknesses of the perovskite and IZO layers are 450 and 150 nm, respectively. The J–V curve was measured under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with an active area of 0.2 cm2 using microwave-synthesized nanoparticles as the ETL for the inverted structure (shown in Fig. 4c). The ZnO device shows a PCE of 12.11% with a Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 21.36 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.25%. We determined the optimal amount of indium doped in zinc oxide to be 6.5%; the corresponding perovskite solar cell achieved a PCE of 16.20% with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 22.86 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.43% under reverse scan direction (from open circuit to short circuit) (Table 1). We tested 16 IZO perovskite solar cells and achieved an average PCE of around 15% (the statistic histogram is shown in Fig. S6†). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined, and the result is presented in Fig. 4d for an integrated Jsc of ∼20 mA cm−2.

In the photovoltaic characteristics, the lower performance of the ZnO-based device is mainly attributed to the poor FF, indicating some loss during carrier transportation by the ZnO nanoparticles. The device performances for different indium contents in ZnO (0%, 5%, 6.5% and 8%) are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1.† Moderate indium doping in ZnO is beneficial for charge transport, leading to higher FF and Jsc values. However, excess indium (8%) results in poor device performance (2.67%), primarily resulting from the worst FF of 15%.
Furthermore, we examined the uniformity of different ETLs on the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. It is clear that the ZnO nanoparticles deposited on perovskite resulted in poor coverage with the perovskite film exposed to electrode, allowing direct contact between the electrode and active layer (Fig. 4e). On the other hand, the smaller IZO nanoparticles with sizes of 20–30 nm formed a dense and uniform coating on the perovskite layer. This morphological variance is expected to significantly affect device performance. The conformal coverage of the oxide layer can prevent direct contact between the active layer and the back counter-electrode, which helps prevent internal short-circuiting. Without the perfect coverage of ETL on perovskite, serious hole and electron recombination occurs during charge transport, thereby reducing the fill factor.
Unlike the conventional inverted NiO/perovskite/PCBM p–i–n device, IZO-based solar cells show hysteresis effect with different scan direction (Fig. S8†). The hysteresis effect has two possible explanations: ion motion in the perovskite active layer or unbalanced charge extraction between interfaces.39,46 To understand the possible mechanism, we fabricated normal inverted perovskite solar cells with similar architecture by replacing IZO with C60 (FTO/compact NiO/Li-doped mp-NiO/perovskite absorber layer/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al) and compared the device performances. In the reverse scan, the C60-based device demonstrated a PCE of 14.04% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 21.36 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.93%, slightly lower than those of the IZO-based device (PCE = 16.20%). For the C60-based device, BCP was employed as a buffer layer on top of the C60 layer to avoid direct contact between the electrode and perovskite active layer. The different scan direction of the J–V curve for the C60-based device is presented in Fig. S9,† which shows an almost hysteresis-free J–V curve. Therefore, the origin of hysteresis from the perovskite active layer itself is unlikely to be the main reason for the hysteresis. Hysteresis behavior in a zinc oxide-based perovskite device using an aluminum-doped material was recently reported by Zhao et al., which also implies the effect of unbalanced charge extraction.39 Further investigation is required to understand the mechanism underlying the hysteresis phenomenon associated with the IZO-based device.
The inorganic material, IZO nanoparticles, can completely cover the perovskite layer to effectively protect the device against moisture. The high PCE of the IZO-based device demonstrates the potential of this metal oxide as an inorganic contact layer. Furthermore, the cost of the metal oxide material is much lower than that of commercial C60 or PCBM, which is an important consideration for large-scale manufacturing. Beyond the conversion efficiency and cost consideration, another advantage of using inorganic transporting layers is the enhancement of stability. Long-term stability is another concern for perovskite photovoltaics, in which degradation under light soaking in air or moisture is frequently observed. Thus, we tested the stability of the perovskite devices with all-inorganic contacts in ambient conditions (open cells without sealing) and under light soaking (with encapsulation). In the preliminary long-term stability test (without sealing), the cell was stored in ambient environment with a relative humidity of 25% ± 5%. The device performance was measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The results of the stability test are presented in Fig. S10,† which shows normalized PCE as a function of time. The IZO-based perovskite device demonstrated excellent ambient stability and maintained 95% of its initial PCE after 15 days. The stable PCE signifies that the IZO nanoparticles have high air stability, and that the all-inorganic contact layer shields the perovskite active layer from moisture. The moisture stability test is a preliminary test prior to the light-soaking test. Currently, most stability tests of perovskites cells are conducted by storing the device in the dark under a dry atmosphere without continuous full illumination. However, this test only demonstrates the intrinsic material and structural stability in the dark under an ambient environment. Therefore, we further tested the stability of the device with all-inorganic contacts under light-soaking conditions with encapsulation. The light-soaking device was sealed in a N2-filled glove box using epoxy. Device performance was then measured under 1-sun illumination in ambient environment. The sealing is crucial because the light-soaking process is not conducted in a N2-filled glove box or vacuum condition. The penetration of air and water could affect the long-term stability if the sealing is not perfect. A light-emitting diode (LED) was calibrated to a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The temperature of the device was maintained at approximately 30 °C. J–V curves were recorded periodically to examine the aging of IZO-based perovskite solar cells. Fig. 5a and b illustrate device aging by plotting the device parameters against hours for the sealed IZO-based device. Our sealed device is shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. After four hours of light illumination, the efficiency of the IZO device decreased from 15% to 14% due to the decrease in FF from 69% to 63%. However, the device remained highly stable for more than 460 hours under light-soaking conditions. The device maintained almost 85% of its initial PCE without losing voltage and current density. The IZO contact material developed in this work demonstrates great potential for application in various perovskite photonic devices such as solar cells and LEDs.

Recently, two inorganic materials, CuGaO2 and La-doped BaSnO3, were used as novel hole- and electron-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells, which demonstrated high stability under ambient or light-soaking conditions for up to 1000 hours.24,47 For La-doped BaSnO3 employing a laminated architecture with two half cells, the light-soaking test demonstrated the concept of fabricating solar cells with all-inorganic contacts. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated the feasibility of conventional monolithic perovskite solar cells with all-inorganic contacts that allow the direct deposition of metal oxide on perovskite and show impressive stability and high device performance. In addition, this study demonstrated the potential of the IZO-based deice for application in perovskite-based LEDs. Strong electroluminescence can be observed with the naked eye (Fig. S11†). A detailed investigation of its characteristics in LEDs is ongoing.
Conclusion
We used a microwave-assisted method to synthesize IZO nanoparticles as a novel electron-transporting layer for perovskite solar cells. When combined with the NiO layer to form all-inorganic selective contacts, the perovskite photovoltaic device demonstrated high performance with a PCE of 16.20%. The air stability test revealed that the IZO-based perovskite solar cell retained 90% of initial PCE after 15 days. The light-soaking device maintained approximately 85% of its initial PCE after 460 hours. This impressive result demonstrates the great potential of IZO-based perovskite photonic devices in future applications.
Methods
Synthesis of NiO nanoparticles and paste
NiO nanoparticles were prepared by the following procedure. Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.01 mol; Sigma) was dissolved in 50 ml deionized water and stirred for 10 min. Later, ammonia solution (25% in water) was dropped into the precursor solution followed by 3 h of stirring, resulting in a blue-colored solution. Subsequently, a microwave-heating process was employed to react the precursor solution at 60 °C for 10 min. The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 75 °C and annealed at 400 °C for 3 h to form black NiO nanoparticles. For Li-doped NiO, LiCl (Sigma) was added to the precursor solution with a 5% molar ratio. NiO paste was fabricated following the procedure described in the literature.48
Synthesis of IZO nanoparticle solution and powder
IZO nanoparticles were synthesized via a microwave-assisted method. Zinc acetate (Aldrich, 99.99%) and indium chloride (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) were mixed in benzyl alcohol with a concentration of 0.02 mol/5 ml and subjected to a two-step heating process at 120 °C and 160 °C. The desired concentration of indium doped into ZnO modified the ratio of Zn (acetate) to indium chloride. After mixing the precursors in the solution, a microwave synthesizer (CEM) was employed to heat the precursor solution via a two-step procedure. In the first step, all the precursor powders were dissolved in benzyl alcohol at 120 °C for 6 min. In the second step, the temperature was increased to 160 °C to synthesize the indium-doped ZnO solution. The solution-processed IZO was then centrifuged twice after replacing benzyl alcohol with isopropanol. For ZnO and IZO powders, the solvent was dried in the oven overnight.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The FTO substrate (∼10 Ω per square) was cleaned with detergent, DI water, acetone, and alcohol. The NiOx film was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate via RF sputtering at 120 W for 150 s. The base pressure of the sputter chamber was below 5 × 10−6 torr. The Li-doped NiO paste dissolved in ethanol (1:7 weight ratio) was then spin-coated on the NiOx film substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h. The perovskite precursor was prepared by mixing FAI, MABr, PbBr2, and PbI2 at concentrations of 1.05 M, 0.02 M, 0.02 M, and 1.15 M, respectively, into DMF:DMSO solvent (4:1 volume ratio). Then, 1.5 M of CsI solution was added to the perovskite solution to synthesize the triple-cation perovskite precursor. The perovskite precursor was deposited on mesoporous NiO via a two-step spin-coating process: 2000 rpm for 10 s followed by 5000 rpm for 20 s. During the second 5 s process, 200 μl of chlorobenzene was slowly poured onto the substrate to form a uniform perovskite layer. The perovskite layer was further heated at 100 °C for 60 min. After cooling the substrate to room temperature, 100 μl colloidal solution of IZO dissolved in IPA were spin-coated on the perovskite substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of aluminum was evaporated onto the IZO nanoparticle layer to finish the back-contact electrode.
Characterization
We characterized the device performance by measuring current density–voltage (J–V) curves in a solar simulator (SS-F5, Enli Tech., Taiwan) with AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. Photovoltaic responses were recorded using a Keithley 2401 instrument. The solar simulator of light intensity was calibrated using certified standard silicon solar cells (SRC-2020-KG3, Enli Tech.). The effective active area of the device was defined by a metal mask with an aperture size of 0.2 cm2. All the J–V curves were scanned in an air environment with a positive prebias. To avoid light scattering, we adhered black tape on the metal mask around the aperture. To measure the shelf stability of the device, the sample was stored in ambient environment at room temperature with a relative humidity of 20% to 40%. The light-soaking device was sealed in a glove box and continuously illuminated in air (30 °C) using a LED light source. Light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. For the stability tests, the J–V curves were measured under 1 sun AM 1.5G conditions after various aging times. A xenon lamp (Newport, 300 W), monochromatic equipment (Newport Cornerstone 260), and Keithley 2401 instrument were employed to measure the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. SEM images were obtained using field-emission SEM (ZEISS SUPRA™ 55VP). XRD measurements were conducted using a Bruker AXS GmbH diffractometer [λ(Kα1) = 0.15405 nm] in the 2θ range of 10–60°. Steady-state PL measurements were conducted under excitation at 532 nm. UV-vis spectra were measured with a HITACHI U-4100 instrument. XPS was performed an Al K-α X-ray source with a spot size of 30–40 μm.
