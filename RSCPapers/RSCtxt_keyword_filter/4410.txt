    , Accepted 22nd September 2017First published on 22nd September 2017AbstractPlatinum (Pt) nanoparticles were stably anchored on triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (TfGnPs), which were prepared by a two-step reaction starting from carboxylic acid- (CGnPs), acyl chloride- (AcGnPs) and amide-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (AfGnPs). The resulting Pt nanoparticles on TfGnPs (Pt/TfGnPs) exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity with significantly enhanced stability compared with commercial Pt-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells (FCs) and the iodine reduction reaction (IRR) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For the ORR in FCs, the onset and half-wave potentials of Pt/TfGnPs under acidic conditions displayed greater positive shifts to 0.58 and 0.53 V, respectively, than those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.57 and 0.52 V). For the IRR in DSSCs, Pt/TfGnPs displayed a reduced charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.13 Ω cm2 at the CE/electrolyte interface. This value was much lower than the Pt CE of 0.52 Ω cm2. More importantly, Pt/TfGnPs exhibited profoundly improved electrochemical stability in both the ORR and IRR compared to the Pt-based catalysts. The combination of extraordinarily high electrocatalytic activity with stability could be attributed to the high specific surface area (963.0 m2 g−1) and the triazine units of the TfGnPs, respectively, which provided more active sites and stably anchored the Pt nanoparticles.
1. Introduction
Increasing energy prices and growing concerns due to global warming have accelerated efforts to develop environmentally harmonious, ecologically clean, as well as safe, sustainable, and energy-efficient chemical technologies that can be employed as alternatives to fossil fuels. Promising solutions include fuel cells (FCs) and solar cells (SCs), which provide clean, sustainable power with little pollution. Catalysts, such as those based on platinum (Pt) and/or its composites, are important components in a number of these alternative energy approaches. For example, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is an important reaction in life processes such as biological respiration, is also exploited in energy conversion systems such as FCs and secondary metal–air batteries.1–3 Platinum (Pt) and its composites, which are expensive and scarce, are the most important and efficient catalysts for the ORR in FCs. Currently, the ORR in FCs still poses challenges, which have yet to be overcome, including high over-potential, slow kinetics and low durability under operating conditions.4,5
Pt based catalysts are also important in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), one of the currently preeminent photovoltaic technologies. DSSCs consist of three principal components, a photoanode (dye-adsorbed nanocrystalline titanium dioxide, TiO2), an electrolyte (a solution with a redox mediator, iodide/triiodide, I−/I3−) and a counter electrode (CE).6 Pt catalysts are highly efficient for the iodine reduction reaction (IRR) in dye-sensitized SCs (DSSCs).7,8
Despite considerable recent advances, existing FC and DSSC technologies still have drawbacks, including the instability of the Pt-based catalysts used for both the ORR and IRR processes.9–13 As approaches to ensure high catalytic activity and durability, Pt nanoparticles have been loaded on high surface area supporting materials such as carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes,14 graphene,15,16 carbon black17 and carbon nanofibers.18 However, Pt catalysts on carbon-based materials often suffer from dissolution (leaching in electrolytes), aggregation and detachment during operation, because the Pt and the carbon frameworks are ionized and oxidized, respectively, under electrochemical operating conditions.19,20
It has been widely reported that nitrogen (N)-doped carbon materials exhibit n-type semiconductor and/or metallic behaviors. The C–N sites in N-doped carbon materials are also catalytically active sites by themselves, as well as coordination sites for stably anchoring catalytic metal nanoparticles.
In this study, starting with carboxylic acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (CGnPs), we prepared triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (TfGnPs) as the catalytic support for stably deposited Pt nanoparticles. The precursor CGnPs were conveniently prepared by a mechanochemical reaction.21–23 When used for the ORR in FCs, the Pt nanoparticles on TfGnPs (Pt/TfGnPs, 14.0 wt% Pt) showed onset and half-wave potentials that were comparable to those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (40 wt% Pt) under acidic conditions. When applied for the IRR in DSSCs, Pt/TfGnPs as a counter electrode (CE) displayed a much lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface than a Pt CE. More importantly, the Pt/TfGnPs exhibited profoundly improved electrochemical stability for both the ORR and IRR operations, compared to conventional Pt-based electrocatalysts.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Graphite was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Natural, ∼100 mesh, 99.9995% metal basis) and used as received. Dry ice was purchased from Hanyu Chemical Inc., Korea. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2), ammonia (NH3, anhydrous, ≥99.99%) and all other solvents were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Inc. and used without further purification, unless otherwise specified.
Synthesis of carboxylic acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (CGnPs)
As previously reported in the literature,21 CGnPs were prepared by ball-milling graphite in the presence of dry ice (solid-state CO2). The resulting elemental analysis was C, 73.26 wt%; H, 1.59 wt%; O, 24.84 wt%.
Synthesis of acyl chloride-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (AcGnPs)
In a one-neck round bottom flask, CGnPs (5.0 g) were dried under reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) at 80 °C for 24 h. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2, 300 mL) and 1,1-dimethyl formamide (DMF, 0.1 mL) were added dropwise into the reaction flask. Then, the mixture was heated under reflux for 24 h. At the end of the reaction, excess SOCl2 and DMF were removed by distillation to yield AcGnPs (5.84 g).
Synthesis of amide-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (AfGnPs)
In a one-necked round bottom flask, AcGnPs (2.4 g) were dispersed in xylene (150 mL). The flask was placed in an ice bath and ammonia (NH3) gas was purged into the reaction mixture. Then, the reaction mixture was slowly heated to 30, 50, 70, 100 and 130 °C for 3, 2, 2, 2 and 3 h, respectively. The resultant precipitates were collected by filtration, and the product was Soxhlet extracted with acetone and deionized water to completely remove impurities, if any, and then freeze-dried at −120 °C under reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) for 48 h to yield AfGnPs (2.0 g). The final elemental analysis was C, 76.65 wt%; H, 1.26 wt%; O, 13.91 wt%; N, 4.96 wt%.
Synthesis of triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (TfGnPs)
AfGnPs (0.6 g) and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5, 3.0 g) were placed into a glass ampoule. After five charging/discharging cycles of argon under reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg), the ampoule was sealed with a propane torch and placed in a box furnace. The temperature was raised to 500 °C for 12 h. The product was Soxhlet extracted with de-ionized water to get rid of P2O5. The final product was then freeze-dried at −120 °C under reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) for 48 h to yield TfGnPs (0.60 g). The elemental analysis of the product was C, 78.74 wt%; H, 1.74 wt%; O, 15.66 wt%; N, 2.43 wt%.
Synthesis of the Pt nanoparticles on triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelet (Pt/TfGnPs) catalyst
In a one-necked round bottom flask, TfGnPs (200 mg) were dispersed in de-ionized water (100 mL) by sonication for 1 h. Chloroplatinic acid hydrate (H2PtCl6·H2O, 50 mg) in de-ionized water (50 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and vigorously stirred for 24 h. The Pt nanoparticles were formed by vigorous stirring while adding sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 0.1 M aq. solution, 100 mL). After the completion of the reaction, the Pt nanoparticles on TfGnPs (Pt/TfGnPs) were collected by filtration, washed with de-ionized water several times and freeze-dried at −120 °C under a reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) for 48 h to yield 216 mg.
Instrumentation, electrochemical measurements, fabrication and measurement of the single PEM fuel cell, the preparation and fabrication of electrodes for the IRR, and the detailed fabrication and characterization of the DSSCs are described in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
Pt nanoparticles were prepared on triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (Pt/TfGnPs) by the conventional impregnation method (Fig. 1a and Scheme S1†).24,25 TfGnPs were prepared as a stable anchoring substrate for the Pt nanoparticles by the following method. First, carboxylic acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (CGnPs) were prepared by ball-milling graphite in the presence of dry ice (solid-state CO2) as reported in the literature.21 Second, acyl chloride-functionalized GnPs (AcGnPs) were prepared by treating CGnPs with thionyl chloride (SOCl2), which converts the carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups of the CGnPs into acyl chloride (–COCl) in AcGnPs. Third, the AcGnPs were converted into amide-functionalized GnPs (AfGnPs) by treating with ammonia (NH3) gas, which turns the acyl chloride into amide. Finally, triazine-functionalized GnPs (TfGnPs) were prepared by the trimerization of the amide groups in the AfGnPs in the presence of P2O5 as a dehydration agent.

The scale bar is 1 μm; (c) HR-TEM image of Pt/TfGnPs; (d) powder XRD diffraction patterns of TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs; (e) TGA thermograms of TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs obtained at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. 
The resulting TfGnPs were characterized using several techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Fig. S1†), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S2–S5†), elemental analyses (EA, Table S1†), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA, Fig. 1e and S6†) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (Table S2†). Detailed characterizations with corresponding discussions are presented in the ESI.†
As shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the CGnPs, AfGnPs and TfGnPs, which are the precursors of the Pt/TfGnPs, the morphologies of CGnPs, AfGnPs and TfGnPs are all similar, with small grain sizes (<1 μm) and round shapes (Fig. S7†). Images of the Pt/TfGnPs show that the Pt nanoparticles are well distributed on the TfGnPs, without notable aggregation (white dots in Fig. 1b). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images of the Pt/TfGnPs (Fig. 2c, S8d and f†) show uniform Pt nanoparticle distribution along the edges of the TfGnPs, where the triazine units are located, and provide sites to stably anchor the Pt nanoparticles. In contrast, HR-TEM images of commercial Pt on activated carbon (Pt/C) catalysts (Vulcan XC-72R, Fig. S8a–c†) show randomly-distributed Pt nanoparticles on the carbonaceous support. The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles on the Pt/TfGnPs are in the ideal range for maximum electrocatalytic activity, 5–8 nm.26,27 And also, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images clearly showed the lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (111) planes of a face center cubic (fcc) crystal structure (Fig. S9†).
The difference in chemical bonding states between the TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs was compared using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S3 and S4†). The survey spectra of the TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs showed major C 1s, N 1s and O 1s peaks, along with minor peaks for S and P elements (the sky blue box in Fig. S3†). The unexpected presence of S and P elements is associated with the synthesis procedures of AfGnPs and TfGnPs, which were converted from CGnPs into AfGnPs using SOCl2 and from AfGnPs into TfGnPs using P2O5, respectively.
High-resolution XPS survey spectra together with the curve fittings and deconvolutions showed that the C 1s of the TfGnPs consisted of sp2C–C (284.4 eV), C–O/CN (285.5 eV), C–N (286.3 eV) and CO (289.9 eV) (Fig. S4a†). The O 1s of the TfGnPs consisted of quinone (530.4 eV),28 CO (532.4 eV), C–O (533.9 eV) and H2O (538.0 eV)29 (Fig. S4b†). In addition, the N 1s of the TfGnPs consisted of triazine CN (398.8 eV) and C–N (400.0 eV) (Fig. S4c†),30,31 indicating that triazine units were formed by the trimerization of three amide units, as schematically represented in Scheme S1.†
The XPS survey spectrum of the Pt/TfGnPs showed Pt 4d and Pt 4f peaks in addition to major C 1s, O 1s and N 1s peaks (Fig. S3†). The content of Pt in the Pt/TfGnPs was about 2.32 at% (Table S3†). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Pt/TfGnPs showed similar C 1s, O 1s and N 1s peaks to those of the TfGnPs (Fig. S3 and S4†). Its Pt 4f spectra were comprised of Pt0 4f7/2 (71.2 eV), Pt2+ 4f7/2 (72.0 eV), Pt4+ 4f7/2 (73.1 eV), Pt0 4f5/2 (74.5 eV), Pt2+ 4f5/2 (75.5 eV) and Pt4+ 4f5/2 (77.9 eV) (Fig. S5†).32
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs indicated that both samples had the same [002] peak at a 2θ value of 26.4° (Fig. 1d), which corresponds to the interlayer distance of the graphitic layers. The particular peaks obtained from the Pt/TfGnPs at 39.7°, 46.2°, 67.6° and 81.6° are respectively assignable to the [111], [200], [220] and [311] lattice planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt crystals.33,34 The volume-averaged particle size was calculated according to Scherrer's formula.35 From the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the [220] peak, the average Pt nanoparticle size of Pt/TfGnPs was estimated to be approximately 8.5 nm, which is consistent with the HR-TEM observations (Fig. 1c and S8d†).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air provided the quantitative amount of Pt in Pt/TfGnPs. The char yields of the TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs at 1000 °C in air were 4.5 and 18.5 wt%, respectively (Fig. 1e). It was notable that the TfGnPs showed higher thermal stability compared to the precursors, CGnPs21 and AfGnPs (Fig. S6†). This result may be due to the formation of the aromatic triazine units and the removal of dangling edge-functional groups such as carboxylic acid and carboxyamide during the heat treatment at 500 °C (Fig. 1e). Based on a comparison of the char yields of TfGnPs and Pt/TfGnPs, the Pt content was estimated to be approximately 14.0 wt%.
The specific surface areas of samples were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. Compared with the precursor CGnPs (635.8 m2 g−1 and 0.601 mL g−1) and AfGnPs (634.0 m2 g−1 and 0.591 mL g−1), TfGnPs showed a remarkably increased specific surface area (963.0 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.760 mL g−1). The increase in the BET surface area of the TfGnPs is likely associated with the chemical activation of H3PO4, which is generated from the reaction between the dehydrating agents P2O5 and H2O produced during the trimerization of amide groups in AfGnPs.36 The larger surface area and pore volume of the Pt/TfGnP composite is expected to contribute significantly to improved electrocatalytic performance when it is used as an electrode material for the ORR in FCs and for the IRR in DSSCs (vide infra).
Following the structural identification of Pt/TfGnPs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique were used for an initial evaluation of electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. The TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C catalysts (Vulcan XC-72R, 40 wt%) were used as reference materials for comparison. CVs of the samples were obtained in both nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2)-saturated 0.1 M aq. HClO4 (Fig. S10a–c†) as well as 0.5 M aq. H2SO4 electrolyte solutions, respectively (Fig. S11a–c†).
In the N2-saturated electrolyte solutions, none of the sample electrodes exhibited electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S10 and S11†). In the O2-saturated electrolyte solutions, the TfGnPs displayed a weak reduction peak potential, whereas the Pt/TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C showed a significant reduction in peak potentials and peak currents. The reduction peak potentials (current densities) of the Pt/TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C were at 0.54 V (−1.52 mA cm−2) and 0.54 V (−1.51 mA cm−2), respectively, in the O2-saturated 0.1 M aq. HClO4 electrolyte solution (Fig. 2a).

For further investigation, CVs were also scanned in 0.5 M aq. H2SO4 electrolyte solution, and the reduction peak potentials (current densities) of the Pt/TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C were found to be 0.59 V (−0.74 mA cm−2) and 0.59 V (−0.77 mA cm−2), respectively (Fig. S12a†). The results indicate that the ORR kinetics of Pt/TfGnPs were better than that of the commercial Pt/C.
The greatly enhanced ORR activity of the Pt/TfGnPs can be explained by the spillover effect. This occurs when the oxygenated species generated on the catalytic Pt sites are transported to the nearby C–N active centers in the TfGnPs. As a result, the lower coverage of oxygenated species on the Pt sites permits better ORR kinetics.37 In other words, the overall ORR kinetics are improved by the combination of optimum Pt nanoparticle sizes (5–8 nm) on the Pt/TfGnPs, the C–N active sites, and the high specific surface area of the TfGnPs (963.0 m2 g−1). Interestingly, although the Pt content in Pt/TfGnPs (Pt: 14.0 wt%, as estimated from the TGA (Fig. 1e)) was much lower than that of commercial Pt/C (40 wt%), the Pt/TfGnPs exhibited higher ORR activity. The results suggest that Pt/TfGnPs may be a promising alternative catalyst for the ORR in acidic electrolytes.
More importantly, the prolonged cycling stability of Pt/TfGnPs was superior to that of the commercial Pt/C (Fig. 2b and S12b†). After 10000 cycles, the Pt/TfGnPs exhibited only 5.8 and 2.8% capacitance losses in the 0.1 M aq. HClO4 and 0.5 M aq. H2SO4 solutions, respectively. On the other hand, the commercial Pt/C showed substantial capacitance losses of approximately 54.30 and 47.3% in corresponding solutions (Fig. S10 and S11†). The superior durability of Pt/TfGnPs compared with commercial Pt/C is due to the triazine units of the TfGnPs, which stably anchor the Pt nanoparticles.
To further estimate the electron transfer number (n) per oxygen molecule, Pt/TfGnPs and the commercial Pt/C were subjected to rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements in O2-saturated 0.1 M aq. HClO4 solution with different rotating speeds at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 2c). The corresponding ring current (IR) for the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide ions (HO2−) was measured with a Pt ring disk electrode. The ORR performance of the Pt/TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C is summarized in Table 1 and shows that the onset potential of Pt/TfGnPs was 0.58 V, which is a more positive shift compared with the commercial Pt/C (0.57 V). In addition, the half-wave potential of Pt/TfGnPs (0.53 V) was also positively shifted, compared to that of the commercial Pt/C (0.52 V). Last but not least, Pt/TfGnPs showed a limiting current density (LCD) of 3.33 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (3.07 mA cm−2).

The electron transfer number (n) and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) percentage per oxygen molecule were calculated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively, (1) (2)where ID is the faradaic disk current, IR is the faradaic ring current density, and N is the current collection efficiency of the employed Pt ring (N = 0.424).38 The n value for Pt/TfGnPs was about 3.95–3.97 in the potential range from 0 to 0.5 V. The results revealed that the electrocatalytic process of Pt/TfGnPs is a one-step four-electron pathway for the ORR (Fig. 2d). The H2O2 value of Pt/TfGnPs was in the range of 0.52–2.16%, while the corresponding value of the commercial Pt/C in the same potential range was 0.73–0.81%.
The catalytic activities of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (40 wt% Pt) and Pt/TfGnPs (14 wt% Pt) were compared using hydrogen (H2) and O2 at 75 °C in a single proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The polarization curves and power densities of the single PEM fuel cell using the commercial Pt/C catalyst and Pt/TfGnPs as a cathode were 0.4 mg cm−2 and 0.7 mg cm−2, respectively (Fig. 2e and f). The H2 oxidation when the commercial Pt/C catalyst was used as an anode was 40 wt% Pt, 0.4 mg cm−2. The maximum power densities of the commercial Pt/C and Pt/TfGnP catalysts were 0.90 and 0.68 W cm−2, respectively.
Converting unit area (cm2) to Pt loading weight (mg), the maximum power densities of the commercial Pt/C and Pt/TfGnP catalysts were approximately 5.63 and 6.94 W mg−1, respectively. The results indicate that Pt/TfGnPs had a 23.3% higher maximum power density than the commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the maximum power density of the cell with Pt/TfGnPs only marginally decreased after 20 cycles, from 0.68 to 0.67 W cm−2. However, the commercial Pt/C showed a notable decrease in maximum power density, from 0.90 to 0.75 W cm−2 after only 5 cycles. These results suggest that the stability of the Pt nanoparticles on the TfGnP catalytic support leads to the improved electrocatalytic activity (Table S4†).
In order to further investigate the differences between the Pt/TfGnPs and commercial Pt/C catalysts, HR-TEM images were compared before and after cycling stability tests conducted in 0.5 M aq. H2SO4 electrolyte solution (Fig. 3). Although the dimensions of the Pt nanoparticles were increased, images of the Pt/TfGnPs confirmed that the Pt nanoparticles remained well supported on the TfGnPs (Fig. 3d). On the other hand, most of the Pt nanoparticles on the commercial Pt/C catalyst had been chipped off, and thus only a few Pt nanoparticles remained after the cycling test (Fig. 3b). Once again, the superior durability of Pt/TfGnPs can be attributed to the triazine units in TfGnPs, which play the pivotal role of stably anchoring the Pt nanoparticles.

In addition to the ORR study, we further studied Pt/TfGnPs for potential application as a promising counter electrode (CE) material for DSSCs. The iodine reduction reaction (IRR) in DSSCs is very sensitive to surface electronic properties and the surface atomic coordination of the catalyst.39 Hence, it is believed that engineering the surface properties, including the surface electronic structure and atomic arrangement of the catalysts, can effectively tune the catalytic properties of the Pt catalyst, enabling enhancement of both electrochemical activity and durability.
In order to investigate the electrocatalytic properties of Pt/TfGnPs as a CE for the IRR in DSSCs, a uniform Pt/TfGnP film was prepared on a fluorine (F) doped tin oxide (SnO2, FTO)/glass substrate by using an electrostatic spray (e-spray) technique (experimental details are described in the ESI†).40 For comparison, a Pt-FTO CE was also fabricated (Fig. S13†).
The electrocatalytic performance of CE materials in DSSCs can be evaluated by several techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization plots, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and step-potential polarization and rotating disk electrode (RDE). Nyquist plots obtained from EIS measurements for the IRR are shown in Fig. 4a. For Pt and Pt/TfGnP electrodes, two distinct semicircles appeared in the EIS spectra, corresponding to the charge transfer process at the interface of the CE/electrolyte, and Nernst diffusion in the bulk electrolyte, in the high and low frequency regions, respectively.

Conventionally, EIS spectra can be evaluated using an equivalent circuit (EC),41 but this EC model is not suitable for the TfGnP electrode. It shows three semicircles (inset of Fig. 4a), which are generally associated with porous carbon materials.8,42,43 Recently, to evaluate this effect a new EC has been proposed by Ju et al.44 In this study, the EIS parameters calculated using the above two different ECs are summarized in Table 2.

The Rct of the TfGnPs was 2.66 Ω cm2, while it was substantially reduced to ca. 0.13 Ω cm2 for the Pt/TfGnPs, which is much lower than that of the Pt electrode (0.52 Ω cm2). These results indicate that the Pt/TfGnP electrode has faster charge transfer kinetics for the IRR.
The Rct value at the interface of the CE/electrolyte can also be used to calculate the exchange current density (J0) at CE in the DSSC via the following equation: (3)where R is the ideal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The smaller the Rct values, the faster charge transfer becomes at the film/electrolyte interface. The J0 values of the TfGnPs, Pt and Pt/TfGnPs were 4.83, 24.7 and 98.8 mA cm−2, respectively. It is notable that Pt/TfGnPs had the highest J0 value, indicating that they have the best charge transfer ability.
In order to further precisely evaluate the electrocatalytic performance, several additional analytical techniques were carried out on the sample electrodes including Tafel polarization plot, cyclic voltammetry (CV), step-potential polarization and rotating disk electrode (RDE). For the Tafel polarization analysis, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained for sample electrodes at a low scan rate of 50 mV s−1, and these LSV curves were further converted to logarithmic current–voltage (J–V) curves, known as Tafel curves (Fig. 4b). The slope of the Tafel plots at a potential around 0 V characterizes the overall cell resistance (RCV) that can be attained at low current densities. The RCV values calculated from the Tafel plots are also summarized in Table 2.
The curve at the intermediate potential with a sharp slope can be attributed to the Tafel zone. Here, both the anodic and cathodic branches of Pt/TfGnPs show a larger slope than those of the TfGnP and Pt electrodes, indicating that Pt/TfGnPs have a higher J0 value. Furthermore, from the CV curves of the Pt and Pt/TfGnP electrodes (Fig. 4c), it can be noted that the ΔEpp of Pt/TfGnPs (35 mV) is slightly narrower than that of the Pt electrode (41 mV), indicating that Pt/TfGnPs have a higher kinetic redox capability than the Pt electrode.
These results are also supported by the Ipc value of Pt/TfGnPs (2.43 mA cm−2), which is higher than that of the Pt electrode (0.78 mA cm−2). As shown in the J–V curve (Fig. 4d) from the step-polarization measurement (Fig. S14†), the results can also be explained by fact that the limiting current of Pt/TfGnPs is higher than that of the Pt electrode. It can be concluded that the higher catalytic capability of Pt/TfGnPs is due to their lower charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, as indicated by the previous EIS, Tafel polarization and CV measurements.
Once again, to further precisely evaluate the intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and effective surface area (Ae) for the IRR, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out using rotating disc electrodes (RDEs, Fig. S15†). Thus, k0 and Ae values were estimated in accordance with the following simplified Koutecký–Levich equation,45 (4)where i is the disk current obtained from the LSV curve at the formal potential (E0), and n is the number of electrons involved in I3− reduction, F is the Faraday's constant, C and D (3.62 × 10−6 cm2 s−1)46 are the bulk concentration and the diffusion coefficient of I3−, respectively, v is the kinematic viscosity of acetonitrile, ω is the angular velocity of the disk (ω = 2πN, N is the linear rotating speed). The Koutecký–Levich plots of J−1versus ω−1/2 at a potential of 0 V on the sample electrodes exhibited good linearity (Fig. 4e). The intercept and slope of a fitting line in Fig. 4e were, respectively, used to determine the k0 and Ae values. The corresponding values for the TfGnPs were 1.69 × 10−3 cm s−1 and 0.055 cm2, respectively. For Pt, they were 5.94 × 10−3 and 6.62 × 10−3 cm s−1. For Pt/TfGnPs, they were 0.056 and 0.397 cm2.
Because the Pt electrode is inherently unstable in DSSCs, developing alternative CE materials is a major consideration. Accordingly, the electrochemical stabilities of the TfGnPs, Pt electrodes and Pt/TfGnPs were tested on an I−/I3− redox couple through 1000 consecutive CV and EIS cycles (Fig. S16†).
The results showed that as the number of cycling potentials increased, the Rct value of Pt-CE significantly increased compared to that of the Pt/TfGnP-CE (Fig. 4f). The Rct values of Pt and Pt/TfGnPs were 2.92 and 0.15 Ω cm2, respectively, in the first cycle (e.g., after 200 CV cycles). In the final cycle (that is, after 1000 CV cycles), the Rct values of Pt and Pt/TfGnPs were 4.52 and 0.25 Ω cm2, respectively. These results suggest that the electrocatalytic performance of Pt/TfGnPs is almost invariant after 1000 cycling potentials, while the Rct of Pt dropped to near 15% for the I−/I3− redox couple in the final cycle (Fig. 4f). Thus, Pt/TfGnPs provided much better stability for the IRR than the Pt electrode.
N719-based DSSC devices with the TfGnP-, Pt- and Pt/TfGnP-CEs were fabricated for comparison. Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with the I−/I3− redox couple, and their photovoltaic (PV) parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSSC with the TfGnP-CE showed a Jsc of 17.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 744 mV, a FF of 67.2% and a PCE of 8.61%. The corresponding parameters for the Pt/TfGnP-CE were 17.89 mA cm−2, 763 mV, 73.8% and 10.07%, and these values were higher than those of the Pt-based DSSC (17.38 mA cm−2, 759 mV, 73.3% and 9.67%). The PV parameters of the Pt/TfGnP-based DSSC were slightly higher than those of the Pt-based DSSC.

To further examine the improved PV parameters of the Pt/TfGnP-CE-based DSSC, EIS measurements were carried out with the same DSSCs (Fig. 5b). The smaller Rct measured at the interface of the Pt/TfGnP/electrolyte indicates that there was a more effective electron-transfer process compared to those of the TfGnPs and Pt counterparts (Fig. 5c and Table 3). As a result, the Pt/TfGnP-CE-based device displayed a higher FF and Jsc.
The comparatively high recombination resistance (Rrec, Table 3) value observed for Pt/TfGnPs can retard charge recombination, resulting in an increased Jsc and Voc in the DSSC. The longer electron lifetime of the DSSC with Pt/TfGnP-CE compared to the DSSCs with TfGnP- and Pt-CEs is associated with more effective suppression of the backward reaction of the injected electron with I3− ions in the electrolyte, which leads to a higher Voc and improved device efficiency.
The electron lifetimes (τn, Fig. 5d) estimated by τn = Cμ·Rrec47,48 were 22.6 (TfGnPs), 31.8 (Pt) and 33.2 ms (Pt/TfGnPs), which are in good agreement with the observed Voc values for the DSSCs (Table 3).
4. Conclusions
In this study, we prepared a new material, triazine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (TfGnPs), for stably anchoring platinum nanoparticles (Pt). As a result, the Pt nanoparticles on TfGnPs (Pt/TfGnPs) exhibited outstanding catalytic performance compared with commercial Pt-based catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and iodine reduction reaction (IRR). As a cathode material for the ORR, even though the Pt content in Pt/TfGnPs (14.0 wt% Pt) was much lower, it displayed higher ORR activity with superb stability compared to the commercial Pt/C (40 wt% Pt). In addition, a single PEM fuel cell based on Pt/TfGnPs also showed higher electrocatalytic activity with stability than those using commercial Pt/C.
As a counter electrode (CE) material for the IRR in a DSSC, Pt/TfGnPs exhibited improved electrocatalytic activity with superior stability compared to a Pt counterpart. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of the Pt/TfGnP-CE/electrolyte decreased to 0.13 Ω cm2, a value much lower than that of the Pt-CE/electrolyte (0.52 Ω cm2). The DSSC with an optimized Pt/TfGnP-CE showed a high fill factor (FF, 73.8%) and efficiency (10.07%), whereas those of the DSSC with the Pt-CE were 73.3% and 9.67%, respectively.
The extraordinarily high ORR and IRR activities of the Pt/TfGnPs, and their superb electrochemical stability, can be attributed to having optimum sized Pt nanoparticles on the Pt/TfGnPs, the high specific surface area (963.0 m2 g−1) and the existence of triazine units on the TfGnPs, which provide more active sites, improving catalytic activity, as well as anchoring sites for Pt nanoparticles to enhance stability. These results suggest that Pt/TfGnPs can be a promising electrocatalyst for both the ORR in FCs and the IRR in DSSCs, respectively. The combination of advantages exhibited by the Pt/TfGnPs, including outstanding electrocatalytic activity, unusual electrochemical stability, simple manufacturing process and low Pt loading (low-cost), suggest that Pt/TfGnPs can be a promising alternative to conventional Pt-based catalysts for FCs and DSSCs.
