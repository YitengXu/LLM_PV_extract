    , Accepted 14th August 2017First published on 15th August 2017AbstractWe report a systematic study of the efficiency limitations of non-fullerene organic solar cells that exhibit a small energy loss (Eloss) between the polymer donor and the non-fullerene acceptor. To clarify the impact of Eloss on the performance of the solar cells, three thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione-based conjugated polymers (PTPD3T, PTPD2T, and PTPDBDT) are employed as the electron donor, which all have complementary absorption spectra compared with the ITIC acceptor. The corresponding photovoltaic devices show that low Eloss (0.54 eV) in PTPDBDT:ITIC leads to a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, but also to a small quantum efficiency, and in turn photocurrent. The high Voc or small energy loss in the PTPDBDT-based solar cells is a consequence of less non-radiative recombination, whereas the low quantum efficiency is attributed to the unfavorable micro-phase separation, as confirmed by the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence experiments, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering, and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements. We conclude that to achieve high performance non-fullerene solar cells, it is essential to realize a large Voc with small Eloss while simultaneously maintaining a high quantum efficiency by manipulating the molecular interaction in the bulk-heterojunction.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received continuous attention in the last two decades due to their potential applications in low-cost and flexible large-area devices.1 Owing to the development of novel organic conjugated materials2,3 and device architectures,4,5 the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the key parameter in OSCs, has been continuously improving from 1%6 to 13%,7 now enabling commercialization. Conversion of photons into electrons in OSCs occurs in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer that typically consists of an electron donor and acceptor. Upon photon absorption, excitons are generated in both the donor and the acceptor phase and successively dissociated into free charge carriers at the heterojunction interface driven by the energetic difference between the donor and the acceptor and the built-in electric field caused by the work function difference between the two device electrodes.8,9 Both the donor and the acceptor are important for light absorption and contribute to the photocurrent of the solar cell.10 However, the absorption coefficients of most donor materials are significantly larger than those of the acceptors, commonly fullerene derivatives.11 Consequently, a lot of research addressing charge generation in organic solar cells has focused on optimizing the alignment of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the donor and the acceptor. Although this is important for the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor,12–20 studies concerning the physics of charge generation after the excitation of the acceptor phase are rarely reported in the literature.10,21–25
The development of novel non-fullerene acceptors in recent years has allowed complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor phases to be achieved in the BHJ photoactive layers, which ultimately leads to more efficient harvesting of photons from the sun.26–33 In particular, several conjugated small molecules34–39 and polymers40–46 have been developed as electron acceptors absorbing in the near-infrared spectral region, and considerable contributions to the photocurrent generated from the acceptors were observed. In this case, free charge carriers are generated via the dissociation of excitons created in the acceptor phase, when holes transfer from the acceptor molecules to the donor. This process, similar to the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor upon excitation of the donor, requires a sufficient thermodynamic driving force at the donor/acceptor interface in the BHJ, in part provided by the energetic offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donor and acceptor molecules.47
In fact, energetic differences between the donor and the acceptor, namely HOMO and LUMO offsets, play an important role in charge generation in OSCs.48,49 Although it has been widely reported that a LUMO offset of more than 0.3 eV is required for efficient charge separation,12,50 some studies demonstrate that polymer/fullerene systems with lower LUMO offsets can perform equally well and achieve high performance.15–18 However, the role of the HOMO offset in charge generation is still debated. Recently, Janssen et al. reported that there was a dichotomous energy offset when exciting the polymer donor or the fullerene acceptor, in which a higher offset was required for efficient hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor. This could be a consequence of lower electronic coupling at the donor/fullerene acceptor interface, when exciting the fullerene acceptor.47 Nevertheless, the recent high PCEs demonstrated in several OSCs with HOMO offsets less than 0.3 eV that use the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC developed by Zhan et al. are a promising contribution to the field of organic solar cells.34–36,51
The different observations prompted us to investigate the charge generation process in non-fullerene OSCs with small energy offsets. Hence, we chose three conjugated polymers (PTPD3T, PTPD2T, and PTPDBDT), which are all based on the well-known electron-deficient thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit,52 that exhibit different HOMO levels as the electron donor and the well-known ITIC as the acceptor (Fig. 1). The donor polymers all absorb in the spectral range from 300 to 650 nm, whereas ITIC has a complementary absorption between 650 and 800 nm. We show that, despite the reduced voltage loss in the system, which exhibits the smallest energy loss (Eloss), the overall performance of the solar cells is less compared to those with larger Eloss, primarily due to the significantly reduced photocurrent generation. The voltage losses and reduced quantum efficiency in these solar cells were systematically studied by Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS), steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. Furthermore, we investigated the micro-phase separation and concluded that low voltage losses and high quantum efficiency in non-fullerene solar cells with low Eloss could be realized simultaneously by the optimization of the BHJ morphology.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Absorption and energy levels of TPD-based polymers
The TPD unit is a weak electron-deficient building block used to construct wide band-gap conjugated polymers with absorption in the visible spectral region.52–55 We synthesized three alternating conjugated polymers based on the TPD unit and terthiophene (PTPD3T),56 bisthiophene (PTPD2T),57 and two-dimensional alkylthienylbenzodithiophene (PTPDBDT)58 as electron-donating groups according to the previously reported literature protocols.56–58 The molecular weights were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as an eluent. PTPD3T has the highest number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 59.9 kg mol−1 (Fig. S1 in ESI†), whereas PTPD2T and PTPDBDT have a relatively low Mn of 13.7 kg mol−1 and 29.0 kg mol−1, respectively. The three polymers show similar absorption spectra in thin films with optical band gaps (Egs) of 1.79–1.85 eV as determined from the absorption spectra. The electron acceptor ITIC displays a complementary absorption spectrum compared to the polymers (Eg = 1.59 eV) (Fig. 2a). The absorption spectra of the polymer:ITIC (1:1) thin film blends are presented in Fig. 2b, and show two distinct absorption bands, one from the polymer and the other from the ITIC. The three polymers were also tested as electron donors in the fullerene-based solar cells and found to exhibit open-circuit voltages (Voc) ranging from 0.79 V to 1.0 V.56–58 The difference in Voc implies that the three polymers have different HOMO levels.

The energy levels of the polymers and ITIC were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†) and summarized in Table 1. The three polymers show HOMO levels of −5.46, −5.50, and −5.60 eV as obtained from CV measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†), whereas the HOMO levels are −5.05 eV, −5.09 eV, and −5.14 eV as observed by UPS measurements (Table 1). The difference in HOMO levels originates from the different reference of the two experiments, as indicated in the literature.59 The HOMO level of ITIC was found to be −5.61 eV and −5.74 eV from the CV and UPS measurements, respectively. Hence, the HOMO offsets between the polymers and ITIC are 0.15, 0.11, and 0.01 eV, respectively, as concluded from CV measurements, which are similar to those reported for other ITIC-based solar cells.60 However, the HOMO offsets observed by the UPS measurements in these polymer:ITIC systems are significantly higher than 0.3 eV, which is a value that is recognized as a sufficient driving force for hole transfer (electron transfer) from the ITIC to the polymer (the polymer to ITIC).50 For Eloss we used the difference between Eg and qVoc as a measure to study the charge generation in these systems.

2.2. Performance of polymer:ITIC solar cells
Inverted solar cells with ITO/ZnO cathodes and MoO3/Ag anodes were fabricated and measured. The photoactive layers were processed from CHCl3 solutions. Detailed information about the deposition conditions, including the use of solvent additives, the donor to acceptor ratio, and the thickness of the active layer, is listed in Tables S1–S3, ESI.† The current–voltage characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The average performance from the eight optimized cells is summarized in Tables S4–S6, ESI.†

The PTPD3T-based solar cells demonstrated the highest PCE of 8.4% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 0.68. The PTPD2T-based solar cells showed a PCE of 7.0% with a reduced Jsc of 12.3 mA cm−2 and an enhanced Voc of 0.96 V. The PTPDBDT-based solar cells, with negligible HOMO offset, still exhibited a PCE of 5.4% with a Jsc of 8.5 mA cm−2, and a high Voc of 1.05 eV. The Jsc of the devices matched the photocurrents as calculated from the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices, as shown in Fig. 3b. All three photovoltaic systems showed virtually the same photoresponse from 300 nm to 800 nm, whereas the PTPD3T-based solar cells had the highest EQE of up to 0.65. The maximum EQE was 0.60 and 0.40 for the PTPD2T and PTDBDT-based solar cells, respectively. We also calculated the energy loss (Eloss) between the optical band-gap of the thin films and Voc, which showed that Eloss is gradually reduced from 0.68 eV for the PTPD3T-based cells to 0.54 eV for the PTPDBDT-based cells. From the photovoltaic performance, it seemed that when the HOMO levels of the donor polymers are closer to that of ITIC, the charge generation efficiency in the solar cells was reduced. Hence, we performed further experiments to understand the charge generation process in these polymer:ITIC solar cells.
2.3. Voltage losses
As shown in Table 2, the highest Voc was obtained from the solar cell with PTPDBDT as a donor, whereas the solar cell based on PTPD3T had the lowest Voc. To further elucidate the reasons for the different Voc in photovoltaic devices, we used a model based on Marcus theory that allows the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) to be determined from the lower energy part of the EQE spectrum:61 (1)where EQEPV is the photovoltaic external quantum efficiency, λ is the reorganization energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, f is a factor proportional to the oscillator strength of the CT-state and the density of CT-states at the donor/acceptor interface, and E is the photon energy. The Voc of the solar cells according to the detailed balance theory is then determined by the following equation:61

 

(2)where h is Planck's constant, q is the elementary charge, c is the speed of light, and EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence of the device. This equation reveals that Voc is directly related to ECT and losses due to the rate of radiative (the 2nd term on the right side of eqn (2)) and non-radiative recombinations (the 3rd term on the right side of eqn (2)).
From the EQE spectra measured with highly sensitive Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS), we obtained ECT using eqn (1) for the solar cells based on PTPD3T (Fig. 4a). ECT of the PTPD3T-based solar cell is about 0.07 eV lower compared with that of PTPD2T (Fig. 4b). However, for the solar cell based on PTPDBDT (Fig. 4c), an accurate determination of ECT is not possible because of the absorption band of the CT-state being too close to that of ITIC. This is further confirmed by EL measurements (Fig. 4d), which showed that the emission spectra of the blend of PTPDBDT:ITIC and neat ITIC are virtually identical. Nevertheless, it is clear that the onset of the EQE of PTPDBDT-based solar cells is blue-shifted, compared to that of the other two donor polymers, which indicates a higher energy of the CT-state in the solar cell based on PTPDBDT.

The values correspond to the calculated values for ECT, non-radiative losses, and radiative losses according to eqn (1) and (2). (d) Normalized EL spectra of the optimized solar cells. 
We further investigated the origin of energy losses based on radiative and non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. Energy losses due to non-radiative recombination can be quantified by measuring the EQE of the CT-state's electroluminescence (EQEEL). As shown in Fig. S4, ESI† and Table 2, we found that the quantum efficiency is one order of magnitude higher in the system based on PTPDBDT, than those of the other two systems. This results in significantly lower non-radiative recombination losses, and it suggests that the reduction of the HOMO offset improves Voc due to reduced energy losses during hole transfer and suppression of losses from fast non-radiative recombination.
The voltage losses due to radiative recombination of charge carriers are calculated using the fitting parameters for the CT state EQE, and they are found to be similar for the solar cells based on PTPD3T and PTPD2T (Fig. 4a and b). The radiative recombination losses are not expected to be very different in these OSCs since they depend logarithmically on the density of charge-transfer states and thus the degree of nano-scale phase separation between the donor and the acceptor. It is therefore reasonable to assume a similar radiative recombination loss for the system based on PTPDBDT. This allows us to predict the Voc for the different material systems, using only the fitted ECT and calculated losses coming from recombination. We found that the predicted values agree well with the measurement, as also indicated in Fig. 4.
It should be noted that for the solar cell based on PTPDBDT, the difference between qVoc and the optical bandgap of the active layer (Eg of ITIC) is as small as 0.54 eV. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the smallest values reported so far. In fact, electroluminescence of the blend was found to be identical to that of neat ITIC, which suggests that the energy difference between the CT-state and the ITIC singlet state is rather small (Fig. 4d). Nevertheless, generation and extraction of charge carriers are still quite efficient as indicated by the moderate Jsc (8.5 mA cm−2) and FF of 0.6. In the next section, we will present and discuss the charge generation in these polymer:non-fullerene acceptor systems with different energy losses.
2.4. Quantum efficiency losses
The optical properties of the polymer:ITIC systems that use different donors are similar, as indicated by the similar absorption of the photoactive layers of the solar cells obtained by optical transfer matrix simulations (Fig. 5a). Therefore, the difference in Jsc of the three systems can only be explained by differences in the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, namely the internal quantum efficiency (IQE). This is confirmed by IQE calculations shown in Fig. 5b. The difference in IQE is associated with either a difference in the exciton quenching/dissociation efficiency of the singlet excitons generated in the neat donor/acceptor phases and/or recombination losses of photo-generated charge carriers. Dissociation of singlet excitons is controlled by the orbital energy offsets between the donor and the acceptor and the bulk-heterojunction morphology, whereas recombination losses depend on many parameters including charge carrier mobilities, energetic landscape at the donor–acceptor interface, as well as the internal electric field of the solar cell.

The exciton dissociation efficiency can be accessed from the steady-state PL measurements, as shown in Fig. 6a. Compared to neat ITIC films, PL from PTPD3T:ITIC thin films was significantly quenched, whereas the PL quenching efficiency of the PTPD2T:ITIC thin film was less. However, PTPDBDT:ITIC thin films showed almost identical PL intensity as observed from neat ITIC films, which is in line with our observation of similar CT-state energies as shown in Fig. 4d. The blends were further characterized by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. These measurements were carried out by exciting into the ground state absorption of the ITIC acceptor and probing of the decay of the ITIC photoluminescence using a streak camera system. Fig. 6b shows the PL intensity decay of neat ITIC films in comparison to the BHJ thin film blends using PTPD3T, PTPD2T, or PTPDBDT as donors. Bi-exponential fits were applied to parameterize the decays and to extract average exciton lifetimes, τavg, (3)in order to allow a qualitative comparison of the exciton quenching. We note that the description by a bi-exponential decay is not based on a photophysical model and does not imply the presence of two separate exciton pools with different lifetimes, but rather a parameterization of the dynamics that yield average lifetimes (decay rates) to allow a qualitative comparison of the exciton quenching efficiency. We observed that singlet excitons created in the PTPD3T-based blend exhibited the shortest calculated average ITIC exciton lifetime of 18 ps, whereas the exciton lifetime increased to 26 ps in the PTPD2T-based blend. Clearly, the PTPDBDT-based blend showed the longest average exciton lifetime of 114 ps of all the investigated polymer:ITIC systems. From the obtained lifetimes, the PL quenching efficiencies were determined (see Table 3), which are in qualitative agreement with the steady-state PL spectra. The average exciton lifetimes and the obtained quenching efficiencies also correlate well with the observed quantum efficiencies, that is, the poor PL quenching will cause insufficient exciton dissociation, corresponding to the low EQE and IQE of the PTPDBDT:ITIC solar cells.

The decay dynamics were obtained by integrating the PL signal between 715 and 865 nm (filled dots) and fitted with a bi-exponential equation (solid lines). All films were excited into the ground state absorption of ITIC at 700 nm.

2.5. Thin film morphology
In this part, we provide an insight into the micro-phase separation in order to elucidate the origin of quantum efficiency differences in these solar cells with different Eloss. The degree of donor/acceptor phase separation in the three different material systems was characterized by several techniques. The AFM images indeed revealed differences in the topography of the photoactive layers (Fig. 7), in which the PTPDBDT:ITIC blends showed higher roughness and larger domain size. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) revealed that PTPDBDT has smaller ‘crystal’ sizes than the other two polymers in blended thin films (Fig. 8 and Table 4), as indicated by the smaller π–π coherence length of PTPDBDT observed in PTPDBDT:ITIC systems.62 Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to investigate the phase separation of the blend films and PTPDBDT showed considerably larger and less pure domains compared to the other two polymer:ITIC systems (Fig. 9).63 This suggests that the exciton dissociation efficiency in the PTPDBDT:ITIC blend is mainly limited by the large domain size, leading to inefficient exciton quenching, which in turn explains the low quantum efficiency in this system. From these studies, we conclude that poor micro-phase separation in the PTPDBDT:ITIC blend is responsible for its low quantum efficiency. The results also imply that if the morphology of the BHJ system could be optimized, higher quantum efficiencies in combination with low energy losses could be achieved. We note that systems fulfilling these conditions have been reported recently.60,64

We provide some discussion about the large micro-phase separation in the PTPDBDT:ITIC blend thin film. Phase separation in binary components is originally determined by chemical structures, such as the length of the side chains,65,66 the crystallinity of the conjugated backbone,67 molecular weight,68,69 and solubility.70 These properties are able to influence the miscibility between the donor and the acceptor, and the crystal growth during film formation, resulting in distinct morphology. It has been reported that conjugated polymers that have similar backbones to PTPDBDT show highly side chain-dependent properties in solar cells,54 indicating that PTPDBDT with varied side units will result in better phase separation. In addition, from the GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 8a–c), we note that PTPD3T and PTPD2T show highly ordered (h00) diffraction peaks, but PTPDBDT only shows a (100) diffraction peak. This means that PTPDBDT has relatively poor lamellar stacking compared to the other two polymers. Therefore, we infer that by using short side chains and improving crystallinity, such as alkylthio units attached to BDT units, the micro-phase separation will be improved. The relative work is in progress in our lab.
3. Conclusions
Three TPD-based wide bandgap conjugated polymers were used as donors in combination with the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC in organic solar cells, in which the ITIC substantially contributed to the photocurrent generation. We demonstrate that in principle by fine-tuning the chemical structures, a high CT-state energy, low non-radiative recombination loss, and hence large open circuit voltage can be achieved. However, the overall performance of the solar cell with the lowest Eloss compared to the other two polymer blends with larger Eloss was reduced due to an overall lower internal quantum efficiency. The reason for the low quantum efficiency in the system with low Eloss was identified as insufficient exciton dissociation, revealed by reduced photoluminescence quenching and comparably long PL lifetime of the ITIC acceptor in blended thin films. We found that the reduced PL quenching is a consequence of donor–acceptor demixing and large-scale separation confirmed by the GIWAXS and R-SoXS measurements, which demonstrated larger domain sizes and lesser phase purity in blended thin films, respectively. In conclusion, non-fullerene solar cells with small Eloss can indeed lead to high photovoltages; however, an optimized micro-phase separation is essential to achieve high photovoltaic performance in these systems.
