    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 27th June 2018AbstractMedium-bandgap small-molecule acceptors including YITI-0F, YITI-2F, and YITI-4F with a thiophene π-bridge are designed and synthesized. The PBDB-T:YITI-2F-based device shows the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of up to 10.05%, a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 15.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69%. Tandem devices are fabricated by applying it as a front cell and the PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based device as a rear cell, giving a high PCE up to 11.86%.
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid development as a prospective technology for clean and renewable energy sources because of their advantages such as low cost, lightweight, mechanical flexibility and potential applications in large-area devices.1–3 Over the past two decades, fullerene derivatives have been applied as dominant electron acceptors in the OSC field and achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%.4–8 However, fullerene derivatives suffer from drawbacks such as weak absorption in the visible region, high production cost and poorly tunable chemical and electronic properties. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to developing high-performance non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).9–14 Recently, the PCEs of OSCs based on NFAs have been promoted over 14% in single-junction OSCs.15–18 Nevertheless, single-junction OSCs suffer from the problems of inadequate overlapping of the solar spectrum and thermalization energy loss from the absorption of photons with higher energies than the bandgap. Using tandem organic solar cells (TOSCs) is proved to be an effective method to solve these problems by stacking two or more cells with complementary absorption spectra,19 where both open-circuit voltage (Voc), which equals the sum of Voc of sub-cells under ideal conditions, and short-circuit current density (Jsc), which is limited by the lower value of sub-cells, need to be as high as possible. It is worth noting that due to the greatly tunable properties, NFAs offer a great opportunity for the development of efficient non-fullerene TOSCs.20–25
To develop efficient NFAs suitable for TOSCs is crucial to realize high PCEs. Chen and co-workers reported the first NFA-based TOSC in 2015,20 which showed a PCE of 8.48% with a quite high Voc of 1.97 V by applying SF(DPPB)4 (ref. 26) with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.8 eV and IEIC (Eoptg: 1.5 eV).27 Hou and co-workers utilized IEIC- and IEICO-based devices as sub-cells and realized a PCE of 10.70% (ref. 21) and further promoted PCEs over 13% (ref. 22) by changing the front cell into an ITCC-M-based device, where the acceptors were all improved from a well-known NFA, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)28 through side-chain engineering or end-group adjustment. Jen's group developed an efficient inverted TOSC with sub-cells based on 6TBA (Eoptg: 1.52 eV) and 4TIC (Eoptg: 1.39 eV), which showed a PCE of 13.20%.23 Recently, Chen et al. reported a high-performance TOSC with PCEs over 14% based on acceptors, F-M and NOBDT.24 F-M (Eoptg: 1.70 eV) is designed from FDICTF (Eoptg: 1.63 eV)29 by adding methyl groups onto the terminal electron-deficient moiety, 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN), to widen the bandgap and NOBDT (Eoptg: 1.39 eV) comes from NFBDT (Eoptg: 1.56 eV)30 by introducing alkoxy side-chain and fluorine substitution on the terminal groups.
In our previous work, we developed a small-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor ATT-2 (Eoptg: 1.32 eV).31 When it was blended with a low-bandgap polymer donor, PTB7-Th, the opaque inverted device showed a PCE of 9.58% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 20.75 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 63%, which means that the PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based device can be a favourable rear cell to utilize long-wavelength solar radiation in a TOSC. Accordingly, the design of acceptors with a medium-bandgap for the front cell is of great importance. In our recent research, NITI, whose structure contains an indenoindene core, a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT) linker and a 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile terminal (INCN-2F), was designed and showed excellent photovoltaic performance.32 NITI exhibits an absorption onset at 832 nm, corresponding to a low Eoptg of 1.49 eV giving a Voc of 0.86 V when matched with a large-bandgap polymer donor, PBDB-T. The broad absorption and moderate Voc mean that NITI may not be suitable for TOSCs. Herein, we report three new NFAs with medium bandgaps by replacing TbT in NITI with a thiophene π-bridge, which can reduce the quinoidal feature and lead to blue-shifted absorptions. With different numbers of fluorine atoms on INCN terminals, the three small-molecule acceptors are named by YITI-0F, YITI-2F and YITI-4F, respectively. We find that YITI-2F shows the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE reaching 10.05%, while YITI-0F and YITI-4F show lower PCEs of 8.81% and 6.64%, respectively, when matched with PBDB-T. Furthermore, in consideration of the favourable bandgap (Eoptg: 1.64 eV) and photovoltaic parameters of the YITI-2F-based device, we apply it as the front cell and the PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based device as the rear cell that can form matched absorption spectra and realize a high PCE of 11.86% in TOSCs.
The synthetic route to YITI is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Intermediate 3 is obtained by the Suzuki coupling reaction between 2,2′-(5,5,10,10-tetra(2-ethylhexyl)-5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) 1 (ref. 33 and 34) and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde 2, followed by Knoevenagel reactions with INCN to afford YITI-0F, with mono-fluorine substituted INCN (INCN-F) to afford YITI-2F and with INCN-2F to afford YITI-4F. Conventional NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopies were carried out to fully characterize the molecules. The acceptors exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents. The thermogravimetric analysis (see Fig. S2†) indicates that the molecules are thermally stable (5 wt% loss at 327 °C for YITI-0F, 322 °C for YITI-2F, and 321 °C for YITI-4F).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of YITI in chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. S3a† and 1, and detailed parameters are summarized in Table S1.† In solution, YITI-0F shows a maximum absorption peak at 644 nm while that of YITI-2F shows a red shift to 652 nm and that of YITI-4F makes a further red shift to 658 nm. And the absorption coefficients (ε) are 7.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for YITI-0F, 7.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for YITI-2F and 7.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for YITI-4F. In thin films, absorption onsets show red shifts from YITI-0F (732 nm) to YITI-2F (756 nm) and YITI-4F (768 nm), respectively. The broadened absorption and the appearance of shoulder peaks indicate strong molecular interactions in the solid state. The Eoptgs are estimated to be 1.69, 1.64, and 1.61 eV, respectively, which indicates that the introduction of thiophene as a π-bridge can blue-shift the absorptions obviously compared with NITI. And with the increase of F substitutions on INCN, the electron withdrawing ability increases and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is strengthened, which leads to red-shifted absorption with a lower optical bandgap. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out to investigate the energy levels (see Fig. S3b†). The potentials were corrected with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are calculated to be −5.59/−3.86 eV for YITI-0F, −5.60/−3.92 eV for YITI-2F and −5.61/−3.99 eV for YITI-4F. It can be summed up that with increasing fluorine substitutions on INCN, both HOMO and LUMO show down-shifts simultaneously but the effect on the LUMO is more obvious.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the three acceptors, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:acceptor/ZnO/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate and ZnO nanoparticles are prepared as reported.35 The active layers were obtained by using chloroform as the solvent. The photovoltaic performance of the OSCs was further optimized by screening the donor:acceptor weight ratios, the temperature of thermal annealing (TA) and the active layer thicknesses (see Tables S2–S10†), and our optimized donor:acceptor weight ratio was 1:1, temperature was 130 °C and the thickness of 100 nm was most suitable for all three acceptors. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PBDB-T:YITI-0F, -2F, and -4F solar cells under the optimized conditions and the detailed device parameters are listed in Table 1. Among three YITI-based devices, the device using PBDB-T:YITI-2F as an active layer shows the best PCE of 10.05% with a Jsc of 15.54 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.928 V and a FF of 69.69%, while PBDB-T:YITI-0F shows a Voc of 0.978 V, a relatively lower Jsc of only 13.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.18%, and PBDB-T:YITI-4F shows a low Voc of 0.825 V, a slightly lower Jsc of 14.41 mA cm−2 and a quite low FF of 55.89%. Finally, devices based on YITI-0F, -4F can only reach the PCEs of 8.81% and 6.64%, respectively. In the wake of more fluorine atom substitutions on the INCN, Voc decreases from 0.978 V to 0.928 V and to 0.825 V due to the deeper LUMO. Compared to YITI-0F, YITI-2F and YITI-4F show higher Jscs partly because of the larger photocurrent generated in the red region. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 2b. The YITI-2F-based device exhibits a higher EQE value over 60% in the wavelength region from 420 to 700 nm with the maximum value reaching 70.8%. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves are 13.36, 15.14, and 13.97 mA cm−2 for the YITI-0F, -2F, and -4F-based devices, respectively. All the integrated Jsc values are within 5% errors compared to those values obtained from J–V tests, indicating that the measurements are reliable for the PCEs.

In order to evaluate the charge generation and extraction efficiencies, we measured the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) in the devices, where Jph is defined as Jph = Jlight − Jdark (Jlight is the photocurrent density under illumination while Jdark is the photocurrent density under dark conditions), and Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va (V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage). The Jphversus Veff plots are shown in Fig S4c.†Jph increases linearly with the increase of Veff at low Veff and reaches saturation (Jsat) when Veff is over 2 V, where the recombination is totally suppressed by the high internal electric field. The highest Jsat of YITI-2F is consistent with its broad absorption and high EQE. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) can be calculated using the equation of Jph/Jsat. The P(E,T)s are 96.8%, 98.9% and 92.3% for YITI-0F, -2F, and -4F-based devices under short-circuit conditions, which implies that the YITI-2F-based device exhibits the most efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection process and this contributes to its best performance. We also examined the vertical charge-carrier mobility by using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model (see Fig. S5†) where the hole-only device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:YITI/MoO3/Ag, while the electron-only device structure is ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T: YITI/PFN/Al. The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) are 5.51 × 10−5/2.76 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the YITI-0F-based device, 5.91 × 10−5/3.90 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the YITI-2F-based device and 5.66 × 10−5/1.53 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the YITI-4F-based device. It can be concluded that the YITI-2F-based device shows the best μh/μe balance (μh/μe = 1.51), contributing to the highest Jsc and FF among all three devices, while the μh/μe values of YITI-0F and YITI-4F-based devices are 1.99 and 3.70, respectively. The μe reduction in the PBDB-T:YITI-4F blend can be related to the blend morphology. As we can see from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. S6,† PBDB-T:YITI-0F and PBDB-T:YITI-2F blends show similarly uniform and proper phase separation, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. The unbalanced μh/μe may increase the recombination in the devices.
To understand charge recombination behaviour in the devices, the dependence of Voc and Jsc of the devices on light intensity was investigated. The slope of Vocversus natural logarithm of light intensity can help to determine the main recombination mechanism. When the slope is kT/q, bimolecular recombination is the primary mechanism, while a slope of 2 kT/q implies that the monomolecular recombination is dominating, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge. It can be seen in Fig. S4b† that the YITI-2F-based device shows a slope of 1.15 kT/q while slopes for YITI-0F and -4F are 1.17 kT/q and 1.30 kT/q, which means that the YITI-2F-based device displays the least monomolecular recombination among all three devices. On the other hand, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) can be described by the formula of Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α indicates the bimolecular recombination extent. The α value approaches 1 when there is no bimolecular recombination and the value is smaller than 1 when the device shows bimolecular recombination behaviour. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the α values are 0.97, 0.98, and 0.96 for YITI-0F, -2F, and -4F-based devices, respectively, which manifests that bimolecular recombination is suppressed in the YITI-2F-based device, which is beneficial to improve the FF.
Ideal TOSCs aim to realize Voc and Jsc as high as possible where Jsc needs to be matched in each sub-cell. In our previous report, PTB7-Th:ATT-2 was proved to have good photovoltaic performance in the long-wavelength region, which can be used as a rear cell in TOSCs. Considering that the PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based device showed a quite high Jsc up to 20 mA cm−2 and the PBDB-T:YITI-2F-based device showed outstanding photovoltaic performance with comparatively higher Voc and the highest Jsc among the three YITI-based devices, a tandem device was fabricated by using PBDB-T:YITI-2F as the front cell to utilize solar radiation in the range of 500–770 nm and PTB7-Th:ATT-2 as the rear cell to utilize sunlight between 700–930 nm. But in previous research, chlorobenzene was chosen as the solvent during the PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based device fabrication, which took a long time to volatilize during the fabrication process, resulting in the erosion of the front cell. Thus, we here chose chloroform as the solvent. After device optimization (details in Table S11†), a PCE of 9.52% is realized in a conventional device, and is close to that of the device fabricated using chlorobenzene (9.58% for the inverted device). The all-solution fabricated tandem solar cell used a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:YITI-2F/ZnO/neutral PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:ATT-2/ZnO/Al.
In tandem solar cells, it is crucial to balance the current densities generated from each sub-cell. Thus, a delicate adjustment of the active-layer thicknesses of sub-cells is quite necessary to achieve matched currents. We tuned the thickness of the front cell from 100 to 150 nm while fixing the rear cell thickness at 100 nm. Similarly, the performance was also investigated when keeping the thickness of the front cell at 125 nm while varying the rear cell thicknesses in the range of 75–125 nm. The PCEs with different sub-cell thicknesses can all reach over 11% (Table S12†) and when the thicknesses are 125 nm for the front cell and 100 nm for the rear cell, the PCE reaches the maximum value of 11.86%, with a Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.628 V and a FF of 64.31%. The J–V curve and EQE spectra of the optimized device are shown in Fig. 3 and the relative parameters are summarized in Table 2. The Jsc integrated by the EQE curves is 10.80 mA cm−2 for the front cell and 11.11 mA cm−2 for the rear cell, suggesting balanced current generation in each sub-cell.

Conclusions
In summary, by introducing thiophene as a π-bridge and regulating the number of fluorine substitutions on the INCN moiety, three new NFAs (YITI-0F, YITI-2F and YITI-4F) with medium bandgaps and with an indenoindene core are designed and synthesized for OSC application. The three molecules show strong absorption between 500 and 800 nm. When blended with a large-bandgap donor PBDB-T, the single-junction device based on YITI-2F gives the best PCE of 10.05%, attributed to the red-shifted absorption and good charge transport properties, while YITI-0F and YITI-4F-based devices only show moderate PCEs of 8.81% and 6.64%, respectively. Thus, the introduction of the thiophene π-bridge can effectively widen the bandgap, making YITI-2F an appropriate material for TOSCs. Based on the good performance of YITI-2F, we applied it as the front cell in TOSCs by combining it with a narrow-bandgap PTB7-Th:ATT-2-based sub-cell, and the optimized TOSC shows a significantly improved PCE up to 11.86%. Considering the relatively large photon energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVoc = 0.71 eV) in the PBDB-T:YITI-2F-based front cell and the overall relatively lower FF, enough room exists for the TOSC development based on this material system through optimal molecular design and device fabrication.
