    , Accepted 10th October 2020First published on 12th October 2020AbstractTwo dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted great interest due to their tunable band gap and structural stability. In this study, biaxial strain behavior and carrier mobility of monolayers (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are investigated by first principles calculations. (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 still retain their structural stability at ε = 13% and ε = 15%, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation has confirmed that the system at 300 K is still thermodynamically stable at a biaxial strain of ε = 8%. The band gaps of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 calculated from the HSE06 functional are increased from 2.427 and 1.953 eV at zero strain to 3.002 and 2.626 eV at ε = 8%. Deformation potential (DP) models based on longitudinal acoustic phonon (LAP) and optical phonon (OP) scattering are used to investigate mobility. The mobility of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 is lower than that of (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. It is mainly determined by the scattering from OP with lower energy and decreases sharply with an increase in biaxial strain. Compared with Pb based perovskites, (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 exhibits high carrier mobility and thermodynamic stability.
1. Introduction
Pure perovskite compounds usually have a crystal structure similar to that of CaTiO3, in which an O anion is used to combine Ca and Ti cations.1 An organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite can be regarded as a derivative of a perovskite oxide, in which organic molecules, metal cations and anions replace Ca, Ti and O atoms, respectively.2,3 Halide perovskites have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.4–6 Their chemical formula is of the form ABX3, where A is an organic cation (CH3NH3+, NH2CHNH2+, C2H5NH3+, etc.), B is a divalent metal cation (Pb2+, Cu2+, Sn2+, etc.), and X is a halogen anion (I−, Br− and Cl−). The inorganic atomic layer is composed of six halogen anions forming a perfect octahedral structure with one divalent metal cation at its center. Organic molecules are filled between the inorganic atomic layers. In recent years, a hybrid halide perovskite has been widely studied as a promising photoelectric material.7–9 It is found that the power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film has reached 21%–22%,10,11 and this record may be exceeded soon. However, the application of the compound is still facing challenges due to its poor environmental stability and toxicity.3
In contrast, a two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite is regarded as a promising alternative material due to its low fabrication cost and excellent environmental stability.12,13 Recent studies have found that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells based on the 2D perovskite has reached 12.5%.14 Compared with the bulk CH3NH3PbI3, the 2D material has a smooth surface, and the layers are bonded by van der Waals interactions.15–28 So, impurities, defects and dangling bonds are more easily eliminated in them. Carrier mobility is a physical quantity that describes the speed of carrier movement in semiconductors under electric field, including electron and hole mobilities.29,30 It plays an important role in electronic devices.31–33 The high carrier mobility of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is still a controversial issue.12,34–36 It is well known that the physical properties of some materials can be improved by strain engineering.37–43 The hole mobility of widely used silicon is about 400 cm2 V−1 s−1, which seriously limits its application. However, the value is increased to 50% using strain engineering.44 2D materials can bear more strain than bulk ones, and some of them can maintain a good elastic behavior with a strain of over 20%.45 Strain behavior can be used to tune the photoelectric properties of materials, which are widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.46–50 Recently, 2D hybrid perovskites, (C4H9NH3)2MI4 (M = Ge, Sn), have been successfully synthesised.51 Compared with Pb based perovskites, they may be promising materials due to their non-toxicity, stability and low effective mass.12 Previously, research on them mainly focused on their structure, optical properties and electronic structure. However, their strain behavior and carrier mobility have not been investigated. This encourages us to do further research on them.
In this study, we perform a detailed first-principles investigation on the biaxial strain behavior of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. First, the materials are applied with a biaxial strain in the range from zero to 20% with an interval of 1%. The elastic range is predicted accurately. Then, the carrier mobility is calculated using the deformation potential (DP) models based on longitudinal acoustic phonon (LAP) and optical phonon (OP) scattering. The effect of strain on carrier mobility is studied. The upper limit of carrier mobility is predicted. This study provides some valuable knowledge for insight into the novel organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.
2. First principles calculations
The main calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4).52–54 The exchange–correlation functional is treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method is used to describe the interaction between the core and electron. The (C4H9NH3)2MI4 (M = Ge or Sn) unit cell exhibits two possible configurations with space groups C222 (no. 21)13 and PBCA (no. 61)12,51 and is composed of 156 atoms, including 16 I atoms, 4 Ge or Sn atoms, 8 N atoms, 32 C atoms, and 96 H atoms. The lattice and atomic position optimizations are performed with an energy cutoff of 500 eV and a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point sampling. All atoms are fully relaxed during geometric optimization until the maximum force is less than 4 × 10−3 eV Å−1 and the total energy change is less than 10−6 eV. In this study, the van der Waals (VdW) interaction between layers is corrected by the DFT-D3 method. Monolayers (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are obtained by separation from the bulk structure with the space group PBCA (no. 61). A 30 Å vacuum region is used to completely eliminate the interaction between layers.55 The GGA–PBE functional underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors or oxides. So, a hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to investigate electronic band structures.56 Furthermore, the spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect is also considered during the calculation, which is more reasonable to predict the effective mass. Carrier mobility is calculated using LAP and OP models, which will be explained in the Results and discussion section.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure characteristics and biaxial strain behavior
The hybrid perovskites (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 can be considered as n-layer GeI64− and SnI64− octahedral sheets sandwiched by organic cations, which exhibits the space group of C22213 or PBCA.12,51 These structures are optimized by the GGA–PBE functional without and with the DFT-D3 method, as shown in Table 1. The calculated results are compared with experimental measurements.51 The free energies of bulk (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 with the space group PBCA are lower than those with the space group C222. Therefore, the system with the space group PBCA (no. 61) is more stable. Compared with (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 produces stronger distortion. However, the distortion does not change the structural symmetry. This is different from the experimental measurement with the space group of no. 62. If the van der Waals interaction with the DFT-D3 method is used for correction, the lattice constants will be slightly reduced. The calculated values are in agreement with the previous investigation of a = 8.473/b = 8.168 Å for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and a = 8.726/b = 8.500 Å for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4.57 To facilitate further work by researchers, these optimized structures have been provided in the ESI.†

Monolayers (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are obtained by separation from the bulk structure with the space group PBCA (no. 61). Fig. 1 shows the unit cell structure of monolayers (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, and the corresponding Brillouin region. Compared with other inorganic materials, it is difficult to relax. The lattice constants will increase slightly when the interaction between layers is excluded. It is found that the lattice constants of perovskites are related to the relaxation process, which may be the reason why the lattice constants reported in previous investigations are slightly different.12,13,57 In this study, we first let the monolayer structures maintain a certain tensile strain, and then gradually relax toward the equilibrium position. The calculated lattice constants and lattice angles for the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 are a = 8.821/b = 8.541 Å, α = 88.47°, β = 90.03°, and γ = 90.11°, respectively. The values for the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are a = 8.829/b = 8.700 Å, α = 89.04°, β = 89.98°, and γ = 89.99°, respectively. It is noted that an I anion forms an octahedral structure with Sn or Ge cations at its center. The structure distortion for the octahedron is caused by the excess valence electrons around Sn or Ge. A more obvious distortion is observed on (C4H9NH3)2GeI4. In (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, four in-plane Sn–I bonds are very close with an average value of 3.184 Å, and two out-of-plane Sn–I bonds with an average value of 3.227 Å. In (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, two long in-plane Ge–I bonds are about 3.454 Å, and two short Ge–I bonds are about 2.801 Å. Two out-of-plane Ge–I bonds are about 3.086 Å.

(b) Brillouin zone and its special points of Γ (0, 0), X (0.5, 0), S (0.5, 0.5) and Y (0, 0.5). (c and d) Side views of the atomic structure along [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] directions, respectively. 

Fig. 2 shows the free energy and pressure versus the strain. The free energy of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 keeps increasing with the strain until the strain reaches ε = 13%, and then drops suddenly at ε = 14%. It is noted that the system pressure along x and y directions drops at this point. The free energy of (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 drops suddenly at ε = 16%. Fig. S1† shows the atomic structure at different biaxial strains. The biaxial strain is applied to the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, the two short in-plane Ge–I bonds decrease slightly, and two long bonds increase gradually with the strain. At ε = 13%, the long bonds are increased to 4.296 Å, the short bonds are decreased to 2.760 Å, and two out-of-plane bonds are about 3.093 Å. It is observed from ε = 13% to ε = 14% that structural recombination occurs. For the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, the octahedron will produce structure distortion similar to that of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4. At ε = 15%, two short in-plane Sn–I bonds are about 2.956 Å, and two long bonds are with values of 3.983 and 4.626 Å. Out-of-plane Sn–I bonds are about 3.226 Å. The structural recombination occurs at ε = 16%. To further confirm thermal stability, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed in a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell with the NVT ensemble. At 300 K, the system runs 3000 steps with a step length of 0.5 fs, as shown in Fig. S2.† The results show that the system can still maintain thermodynamic stability at a strain of ε = 8%.

In this study, electronic band structures are investigated by local GGA–PBE, PBE–SOC and hybrid HSE06 functionals. Fig. 3 shows the results by GGA–PBE and HSE06 functionals, in which the Fermi level has set to zero. The band structures from PBE–SOC are exhibited in Fig. S3.† The results reveal that they are direct band gap semiconductors with conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) at the Γ point. The band gap increases gradually with an increase in biaxial strain, which is consistent with the previous investigation of inorganic materials.47 The band gaps of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4/(C4H9NH3)2SnI4 from GGA–PBE and PBE–SOC are 1.811/1.410 and 1.680/1.165 eV at ε = 0, 1.976/1.524 and 1.843/1.293 eV at ε = 2%, 2.118/1.704 and 1.981/1.500 eV at ε = 4%, 2.218/1.870 and 2.077/1.685 eV at ε = 6%, 2.299/1.984 and 2.156/1.807 eV at ε = 8%, respectively. After considering the SOC effect, the band splits and the gap decreases slightly. Compared with (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 and (C4H9NH3)2PbI4,12 the SOC effect is weak. The HSE06 functional improves the band gap to 2.427/1.953 eV at ε = 0, 2.624/2.090 eV at ε = 2%, 2.793/2.303 eV at ε = 4%, 2.910/2.497 eV at ε = 6% and 3.002/2.626 eV at ε = 8%, respectively. Previous investigations have confirmed that the CBM and VBM of these materials are mainly determined by inorganic layers.12 To further verify the orbital composition, the p orbitals of Ge, Sn/I atoms are projected onto the energy band, which is shown in Fig. 4. It is noted that CBM is mainly determined by px of Ge atoms in (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and px and py of Sn atoms in (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, and VBM is mainly dominated by px, py and pz of I atoms.

The Fermi level has been set to zero. The black and red symbol lines denote the results obtained from GGA–PBE and HSE06. The band gap has been marked in the figure. 
 Fig. 4  Electronic band structure of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 projects to p orbitals of I and Ge/Sn atoms, which is calculated by GGA–PBE, PBE–SOC and HSE06 functionals. The Fermi level has been set to zero. 
The band offset is an important parameter for metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs). In order to effectively control the leakage current, the valence band offset (VBO) and the conduction band offset (CBO) should be greater than 1 eV.56 Therefore, the band edge position of semiconductors should be carefully verified. Fig. 5 shows the conduction band and valence band edges versus biaxial strain, in which the vacuum level has been scaled to zero. The VBM decreases with an increase in the strain, while the CBM shows a slight upward trend. The electron affinity calculated from GGA–PBE is in the range from 2.747 to 2.990 eV for the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and from 2.900 to 2.967 eV for the monolayer (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. Compared to GGA–PBE, the HSE06 functional reduces them to 2.514–2.778 eV and 2.686–2.769 eV. The electron ionization energy calculated using GGA–PBE is in the range from 4.801 to 5.046 eV for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and from 4.372 to 4.883 eV for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. It is noted that the HSE06 functional will increase them to 5.205–5.516 eV and 4.720–5.312 eV.

3.2. Carrier mobility calculated from the LAP model
The LAP model usually causes a change in crystal volume, which leads to a change in band edges. The deformation potential can be described as follows: (1)or (2)
Hamilton of the system is expressed as Ĥ = Ĥ0 + Ĥ′ with a perturbation term Ĥ′. V0 and V are the volume at equilibrium and after scattering. |Ec − E0c| and |Ev − E0v| represent the change in the CBM and the VBM after scattering. Ee and Eh represent the deformation potential constants of the CBM and VBM. The scattering rate of the carrier can be obtained by time dependent perturbation theory. (3)kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Eα is the deformation potential. The subscript denotes the scattering to electrons for α = e and to holes for α = h.  is the carrier effective mass. ħ is the reduced Planck constant. C denotes the longitudinal modulus of elasticity. After taking into account the anisotropy of effective mass, elastic modulus and deformation potential, the carrier mobility of 2D semiconductors can be described as58–60 (4) (5) is calculated using the band edge shape with the relationship . Deformation potential (Eα) is determined using  with the uniaxial stretching strain Δε. The elastic modulus is calculated using  and  with the side pulling forces Fx and Fy, and lattice constants a and b. The above equation implies that the mobility in the x direction is only determined using deformation potential and elastic modulus in the same direction, but independent of those in the y direction. To describe the carriers scattered by phonons from all directions, the model can be modified to be61 (6) (7)
In the modified model, the carrier mobility along the x or y direction is determined by the phonon scattering in x and y directions, which can reasonably describe the carrier mobility.
Carrier mobility is closely related to effective mass, elastic modulus and deformation potential. The effective mass can be calculated by analyzing the band structure near the CBM and VBM. In this study, it is determined using an energy less than 0.1 eV from the CBM and VBM. Table 2 shows the result with GGA–PBE, PBE–SOC and HSE06 functionals. In the absence of strain, the reported effective masses of electrons and holes are about 0.190 and 0.280m0 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI413 and 0.327 and 0.278m0 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4.57 They are related to the directions, which may be the reason for the different values. In most cases, the values calculated using the GGA–PBE functional are higher than those calculated using the HSE06 functional. It is generally believed that the shape of the band edge is corrected after considering the SOC effect, which gives a reasonable prediction of the effective mass.62 The values will increase with the biaxial strain. It seems that the effective masses of holes for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 increase faster than those for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. At ε = 8%, the values from PBE–SOC are increased to  = 1.693 and  = 2.786 m0 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and to  = 0.797 and  = 0.659 m0 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4.

Elastic modulus can be regarded as a physical quantity to determine the elastic deformation. The larger the value, the greater the force required for elastic deformation, and the harder the material. Table 3 lists the calculated results. If all atoms are relaxed with a force convergence criterion of 10−2 eV Å−1, the values are Cx = 24.3 and Cy = 25.5 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and Cx = 36.6 and Cy = 35.3 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 is slightly harder than (C4H9NH3)2GeI4. The reported values are 305 J m−2 for BC6N,63 306–317 J m−2 for BC2N,64 256–318 J m−2 for BC3,63,65 362–373 J m−2 for C3N,47 71 J m−2 for C2N,66 340 J m−2 for graphene,67 93 J m−2 for α-graphyne, 124 J m−2 for β-graphyne,68 267 J m−2 for BN,69 140 J m−2 for MoS2,70 50 J m−2 for InSe,49 and 13–44 J m−2 for SnS, SnSe, GeS and GeSe.49,71 Compared with that of other inorganic 2D materials, the elastic modulus is low. If biaxial tensile strain is applied to them, the elastic modulus will be decreased. At ε = 8%, the values are about Cx = 8.2 and Cy = 12.7 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and Cx = 7.4 and Cy = 8.0 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. The elastic modulus is related to the convergence criterion. If the force convergence criterion is improved, the elastic modulus will decrease slightly. However, atoms can reach the equilibrium state through more relaxation steps, which will cause a deviation in the simulation of longitudinal acoustic phonons.

In order to verify the contribution of organic molecules to the elastic modulus, we further calculate them by fixing organic molecules and only relaxing inorganic atomic layers. Fig. 6 shows Fx/b and Fy/a versus uniaxial tensile strain along x and y directions. Here, Fx and Fy are the pulling forces along x and y directions, a and b denote the lattice constants. The uniaxial strain is in the range from zero to 0.5% with an interval of 0.1%. Fx/b and Fy/a exhibit a linear change with the strain. The elastic modulus can be obtained by the slope of the linear fitting function. If the contribution of organic molecules is completely excluded, the elastic modulus will be greatly improved with the values of Cx = 186 and Cy = 192 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and Cx = Cy = 192 J m−2 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. At ε = 8%, the values are reduced to Cx = 147 and Cy = 151 J m−2. Therefore, we infer that the relaxation of organic molecules in hybrid perovskites results in a decrease in elastic modulus.

(a) (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (b) (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. The linear fitting equation and error are presented, and the elastic modulus can be obtained using the slope. 
Another parameter contributing to mobility is the deformation potential. In order to effectively simulate LAP, uniaxial tensile strain along x and y directions in the range from zero to 0.5% with an interval of 0.1% is applied to the lattice. Fig. 7 and 8 show the conduction and valence band edges versus uniaxial strain. It is noted that the band edge shows a good linear dependence on uniaxial strain. A linear fitting function and its standard deviation are shown. The deformation potential constant can be calculated by the slope of the linear fitting functional. The values are Ee,x = 1.76/Ee,y = 3.77 eV and Eh,x = 3.88/Eh,y = 3.32 eV for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and Ee,x = 4.39/Ee,y = 1.61 eV and Eh,x = 5.10/Eh,y = 4.82 eV for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. I, Ge or Sn atoms determine the CBM and VBM, which plays a dominated role in the deformation potential. The values are close to the previous investigations on 2D materials composed of inorganic elements with the values of Ee,x = 3.28/Ee,y = 2.32 eV and Eh,x = 6.67/Eh,y = 4.37 eV for SnS,48Ee,x = 7.04/Ee,y = 1.82 eV and Eh,x = 9.20/Eh,y = 5.19 eV for SnSe,72 and Ee,x = 5.38/Ee,y = 3.14 eV and Eh,x = 5.39/Eh,y = 1.17 eV for BC2N.64 The deformation potential has a decreasing trend with an increase in the biaxial strain.

Table 3 presents carrier mobility based on LAP scattering. The electron mobility is μe,x = 1845/μe,y = 883 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μe,x = 1878/μe,y = 2920 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, while the hole mobility is μh,x = 202/μh,y = 150 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μh,x = 752/μh,y = 742 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. It is found that the anisotropy of mobility is mainly determined by the deformation potential. The mobility decreases rapidly as the biaxial strain is applied to the sample. At ε = 8%, the electron mobility is decreased to μe,x = 338/μe,y = 189 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μe,x = 231/μe,y = 354 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4, while the hole mobility is reduced to μh,x = 17/μh,y = 13 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μh,x = 39/μh,y = 48 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4.
3.3. Carrier mobility calculated using the OP model
Compared with acoustic phonons, OP reflects the relative vibration between atoms without changing the size of the unit cell. The variation of the distance between atoms leads to the perturbation potential, which is the scattering source of the carriers. The mobility from OP scattering can be calculated using the model as follows.18 (8) (9)where ρ denotes the mass density, ωqλ represents the angular frequency of the OP at the Γ point for the branch index λ and the wave vector q, which can be obtained by solving the dynamical matrix. E′α is the deformation potential for OP, determined by |ΔEα/Δd| with the band edge change ΔEα and the atomic displacement Δd. Nqλ is the Bose Einstein distribution. Δ1 = 1 − exp(−ħωqλ/2kBT) and Δ2 = exp(−ħωqλ/2kBT) are the weight factors, which have been explained in previous investigations.18
The unit cell is composed of 78 atoms, so there are 234 branches, including 231 OP. It is very complicated to calculate the contribution of each OP to mobility. According to the OP model described in eqn (8) and (9), the mobility is proportional to the OP energy. In this study, we only investigate the contribution of phonons with an energy less than 30 meV to mobility. Optical phonons with higher energy have little effect on mobility, so they are excluded from the calculation. Fig. 9 shows the deformation potential for conduction and valence bands versus OP energies. The maximum deformation potential for conduction and valence bands is 4.868 and 3.206 eV Å−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and 2.196 and 3.424 eV Å−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. Fig. 10 shows the reciprocal mobility versus the OP energy. The mobility is mainly determined using the phonons with an energy less than 20 meV. So, the optical phonons with low energies play a decisive role in scattering. According to Matthiessen's rule,73 the mobility from OP scattering is calculated by using . At 300 K, the value is about μe,x = 41/μe,y = 27 and μh,x = 25/μh,y = 17 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μe,x = 228/μe,y = 230 and μh,x = 116/μh,y = 112 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. Considering all optical branches, the mobility using the OP model may be underestimated.18 Previous investigations have suggested that the mobility is determined by a branch of optical phonons with the lowest value,74–76 which can give a more reasonable prediction for OP mobility. At 300 K, the lowest branch mobility is about μe,x = 141/μe,y = 95 and μh,x = 101/μh,y = 69 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μe,x = 732/μe,y = 738 and μh,x = 258/μh,y = 250 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. The mobility calculated from OP scattering is much lower than that from the LAP model. Therefore, the total mobility is mainly determined by OP scattering. Previous studies have confirmed that LAP overestimates carrier mobility of some semiconductors.77,78 Total mobility is calculated by using 1/μ = 1/μLAP + 1/μOP. The values are μe,x = 131/μe,y = 86 and μh,x = 67/μh,y = 47 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4, and μe,x = 527/μe,y = 589 and μh,x = 192/μh,y = 187 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. The effective mass increases with the strain, and the mobility is inversely proportional to the square of the effective mass. Therefore, it will decrease rapidly with an increase in strain.

 Fig. 10  Reciprocal mobility versus optical phonon energy. In this study, only optical phonons with energies less than 30 meV are considered in the calculation. 
At 300 K, the mobility of MoS2 is about 354–410 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons, and 26–219 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes.74,77,79,80 The value of SnSe is 757–826 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons, and 376–415 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes.48 The electron mobility of InSe is about μx = 296 and μy = 334 cm2 V−1 s−1.49 Previously, a large number of experimental investigations have been done on Pb based hybrid perovskites with electron mobility in the range from 0.07 to 67 cm2 V−1 s−1.35,36 Poncé et al. predicted its electron mobility with a value of 80 cm2 V−1 s−1.34 They demonstrated that the mobility is dominated by the low-energy longitudinal OP associated with stretching of I–Pb bonds. Compared with Pb based hybrid perovskites, (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 exhibits higher mobility. At present, some theories have predicted that (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 may exhibit higher carrier mobility,12 however, the experimental measurement shows that the mobility is still less than 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.3 After improving the technology, impurities and defects are completely removed from the sample, and the carrier mobility will be improved.
4. Conclusions
In summary, biaxial strain behavior and carrier mobility of (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are investigated using density functional theory. The first principles calculations reveal that (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 can retain their structure stable when the biaxial strain is less than 13% and 15%. Molecular dynamics simulations show that they maintain thermodynamic stability at room temperature as the strain is less than 8%. The band gap increases with the biaxial strain changing from zero to 8%. The values for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 are 1.680–2.156 eV in PBE–SOC, 1.811–2.299 eV in GGA–PBE and 2.427–3.002 eV in HSE06, while the values for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 are 1.165–1.807 eV in PBE–SOC, 1.410–1.984 eV in GGA–PBE and 1.953–2.626 eV in HSE06. The variation of electron affinity and ionization energy with strain is also analyzed. The electron affinity calculated from HSE06 is in the range from 2.514 to 2.778 eV for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and 2.686 to 2.769 eV for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. The ionization energies are 5.205–5.516 eV and 4.720–5.312 eV, respectively.
The semiempirical models based on LAP and OP scattering are used to investigate mobility. The values from OP scattering are lower than those from the LAP model. Compared with that of inorganic materials, the mobility of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite is mainly determined by the scattering from optical phonons with lower energy. At 300 K, the phonon limited mobility is estimated to be μe,x = 131/μe,y = 86 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh,x = 67/μh,y = 47 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2GeI4 and μe,x = 527/μe,y = 589 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh,x = 192/μh,y = 187 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (C4H9NH3)2SnI4. High carrier mobility can be obtained by replacing Pb with Sn in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. The effective mass increases with the biaxial strain, which leads to the rapid decrease in mobility. Compared with Pb-based perovskites, (C4H9NH3)2SnI4 exhibits good mechanical properties, thermodynamic stability, moderate band gap and high carrier mobility, so it will become a promising material in nanoelectronic devices.
