Upon thiophene substitution the complexes presented enhanced optical properties compared to the reference dye with no thiophene substitution. DSCs based on the dithienyl-derived dye showed power conversion efficiencies up to 5.7%, more than twice that containing the complex without the thiophene substitution.
Introduction
Solar energy is expected to play a strategic role to satisfy the increasing global energy demand and properly address issues related to fossil fuels pollution, costs, and shortage.1 New generation thin film molecular technologies offer a good trade-off of low costs and energy conversion efficiencies (η) for solar applications.2 To this end, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)3,4 have reached the highest efficiencies, exceeding the value of 12%.5 The photosensitizer dye plays a key role in DSCs, absorbing the solar light and promoting, at the interface with a mesoporous high bandgap semiconductor (typically TiO2 nanoparticles) and a charge transport layer (the redox couple I−/I3−), the formation of an electron–hole pair, which is then separated, transported, and collected at the electrodes. The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energies of the sensitizer must properly fit the conduction band (CB) of the electron semiconductor and the redox couple Nerst potential, in order to provide efficient charge transfer mechanisms.3 2,2′-Bipyridyl (bpy) Ru(II) complexes,6 such as the benchmark dye cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(bpy-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) (N37 and N719)8 are amongst the best performing photosensitizers. More recently, heteroleptic ruthenium complexes have been investigated, where one of the two bpy-4,4′-dicarboxylate (dcbpy) anchoring ligands has been replaced by a functionalized ancillary bpy ligand carrying two electron-rich aromatic conjugated substituents on the 4,4′ positions of the bpy core.4,9,10 In particular, thiophene-based substituents led to tunable optical and energetic properties by inducing bathochromic and hyperchromic effects, which resulted in enhanced light-harvesting capacities, higher external quantum efficiencies, improved device photocurrents, and top-ranked power conversion efficiencies.10 On the basis of these distinct and superior characteristics, Grätzel and others referred to these compounds as “supersensitizers”.4 Some of us have described the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-substituted heteroleptic complex Ru-EDOT, which yielded photovoltaic efficiencies of 9.1% and photocurrent densities (Jsc) of 19.7 mA cm−2 under standard global AM 1.5 irradiation.11
A main drawback of these Ru(II) complexes is the presence of the thiocyanate SCN ligand. Thiocyanate coordinates through only one atom, which makes easier the replacement by other competing ligands yielding less efficient species, and its coordination to metal ions requires purification steps in order to separate the active N- from the inactive S-coordinated isomer.4,12 Unfortunately, previous efforts to replace SCN by other ligands such as halides or cyanide always yielded much lower energy conversion efficiencies.7 Recently, Nazeeruddin, Grätzel and co-workers have described the cyclometalated ruthenium complex 1b (Fig. 1) where the thiocyanate ligands have been replaced by the deprotonated form of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine.13 This sensitizer is the first reported thiocyanate-free Ru(II) complex showing power conversion efficiencies of approximately 10%. These types of ligands have been widely investigated in cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes mainly for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic light-emitting electrochemical cells (OLECs) thanks to their strong photoemissive properties,14 but also in nonlinear optics15 and, more recently, in DSCs.16
 Fig. 1  Formal conversion from unsubstituted complex 2 to heteroaromatic-derived complexes 3 for additional tunable properties. 
On the basis of the enhanced photophysical and photovoltaic properties exhibited by the supersensitizers based on thiophene-substituted bpy ancillary ligands,10 we were interested in checking whether 2-phenylpyridine and 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine derivatives carrying thiophene-based conjugated substituents on the 4-position of the azine ring could provide a new class of cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes 2 (Fig. 1) with tunable photophysical, electronic, and photovoltaic properties. Indeed, cyclometalation has been shown to be an important tool for significantly perturbing the optical and electronic properties of the corresponding complexes.17
Rather surprisingly cyclometalated ruthenium complexes carrying 4-(heteroaromatic-substituted)-2-arylpyridines have never been described in the literature. Cyclometalated ruthenium complexes with unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine or substituted with simple electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl ring of the anionic ligand have been very recently described by Berlinguette et al., who demonstrated the relevant effects of the conjugated groups on the electrochemical and optical properties and HOMO–LUMO energies.18 Other cyclometalated complexes, with ligands other than 2-arylpyridines, have been recently proposed as very efficient DSC sensitizers.19 We have recently reported two families of thiophene-based 2-arylpyridines ligands, where the pyridine ring of the new compounds is substituted in 4-position with π-conjugated electron-rich and electron-poor thiophene-based fragments in order to tune the optical and energetic properties.20 Indeed, absorption/emission, redox features, and HOMO–LUMO energy levels data have demonstrated that the photophysical and electronic properties of the ligands may be tuned over a broad range.
We present here two new thiocyanate-free cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes of type 2 of Fig. 1 containing, in combination with dcbpy anchoring ligands, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine anionic ligands bearing thiophene-based π-conjugated groups on the pyridine ring. The investigated cyclometalated complexes are presented in Fig. 2, together with the corresponding complex containing the reference ligand 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (FPh-Py) with no thiophene-based substitution.13 For comparison, the complex with the unsubstituted ligand 2-phenylpyridine (Ph-Py)18b with no fluorine groups on the phenyl ring has been studied as well. The new complexes 3a and 3b have been investigated in regards to their optical and electronic properties. DSCs containing the complexes as photosensitizers have been prepared and photovoltaic properties measured in comparison with reference species 1 and 2.

Results and discussion
Synthesis, and optical and electrochemical properties of the Ru(II) cyclometalated complexes
The new Ru(II) complexes 3 listed in Fig. 2 have been synthesized starting from the ligands FPh-Py-T and FPh-Py-T-T, which were prepared according to our previous report.20 The synthetic procedure, similar to that previously described in the literature,18 involves three steps as shown in Scheme 1: (i) preparation of dimer [C6H6RuCl2]2; (ii) reaction with 2-arylpyridine ligand in the presence of acetonitrile to give a cyclometalated Ru(II) intermediate; (iii) substitution of acetonitrile by dcbpy. Remarkably, we found that the use of a microwave reactor in the last step leads to a drastic reduction of the reaction time (from 25–40 h to 25–30 min), higher selectivity, and easier work-up (further purification by column chromatography is no longer needed).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the cyclometalated complexes. 
As previously outlined,4a complex 2 shows three absorption bands in the visible region in place of the two bands usually present in thiocyanate-based ruthenium complexes. Interestingly, the lowest energy MLCT band in 2 is red-shifted by 25 nm compared to N719, with overall remarkable high molar extinction coefficient substantially exceeding that of N719 over the whole visible domain. This is due to the cyclometalated ligand, which is a stronger donor than the two thiocyanate groups, resulting in a destabilization of the HOMO higher than that of LUMO.4a The absorption spectra of the cyclometalated complexes 3, along with those of the reference systems 1 and 2, are depicted in Fig. 3. The main photophysical parameters in EtOH are collected in Table 1.

Similarly to the reference complexes 1 and 2, the thiophene-substituted complexes 3 present three bands in the visible region due to MLCT transitions. The introduction of the thiophene-based substituent causes a red-shift of the visible bands. Comparison between 3a and 3b shows that, upon introduction of a second thiophene ring, the two bands at lower energies are almost unvaried, but a red-shift is recorded for the band centered around 430 nm and a new band at ca. 380 nm appears. All of the complexes are characterized by high molar extinction coefficients.
The electrochemical properties of the dyes were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dimethylformamide (DMF). Current potential profiles are shown in Fig. 4. The redox processes related to dye oxidation (potential > 0.0 V) appear as quasi-reversible overlaps of several current waves, whereas the reduction (potential < −1.0 V) has a somewhat irreversible character. Due to the difficulty in defining the oxidative current onset, we preferred to apply differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV) for the estimation of the HOMO energy levels (see ESI Fig. S1†). The resulting electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2.

The main difference in the electrochemistry of the complexes is the higher oxidation potential of 2, and the correspondingly lower HOMO energy value. The higher oxidation potential of 2 compared to its formal precursor 1 is likely due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring. The presence of electron-donating thiophene groups in 3 makes the oxidation easier, resulting in potentials which are back again similar to the value of 1. If we consider a redox potential of the iodide/triiodide electrolyte of ca. +0.35 V vs. NHE,4 the data of Table 2 suggest that the driving force for regeneration of the dye is somewhat lower for 1 and 3 compared to the reference dye 2. If we use the calculated values of the LUMOs from the reduction processes to estimate the energy of the dye excited states we find a slightly more negative potential than −0.7 V vs. NHE, that is analogous to that of N3.4 This corresponds to an offset with the semiconductor CB slightly higher than 0.2 V (considering a value of −0.5 V vs. NHE for the TiO2 CB),4 which is enough for an efficient electron injection mechanism.
Fabrication and characterization of DSCs
The new complexes have been used as photosensitizers in liquid DSCs (see experimental for details). The sensitizer solution contained CDCA as a de-aggregating co-adsorbent agent in 1:1 proportion.22 Different kinds of electrolyte solutions were used for improving the photovoltaic property of devices by varying the concentrations of I2, LiI, guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile–valeronitrile 85:15. The best average power conversion efficiencies were measured using the electrolyte A6141 (0.60 M N-butyl-N-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.50 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile–valeronitrile 85:15).8,23
Main photovoltaic parameters of the new dyes 3 are listed in Table 3 together with those of the reference cyclometalated complexes 1 and 2 and thiocyanate-based benchmark Ru(II) dye N719. The overall conversion efficiencies η were derived from the equation: η = Jsc × Voc × FF, where Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc the open circuit voltage, and FF the fill factor. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves of DSCs based on the new dyes.

The DSC data show the advantages of both the fluorine substitution on the phenyl ring and of the thiophene substitution on the pyridine ring. The DSC based on the complex 3b, which combines both features and contains a dithienyl substituent, is significantly better performing than those containing the other dyes, exhibiting a power-conversion efficiency at standard solar conditions which is more than twice that of the other devices. In particular, upon substitution with the dithienyl-based substituent on the pyridine ring on going from 2 to 3b, the efficiency increases from 2.4% to 5.7%. This is mainly the consequence of the largely improved photocurrent (from 7.0 to 12.4 mA cm−2 from 2 to 3b), which we ascribed to the more favorable (red-shift of the vis bands) optical features of the latter.
The evaluation of the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the DSC based on the best performing dye 3b is displayed in Fig. 6. The IPCE shows a plateau in the range 450–570 nm, with a maximum of ca. 60% and extension up to 800 nm.
 Fig. 6  IPCE of DSCs using cyclometalated Ru(II) sensitizer 3b. 
In order to elucidate the reasons for the higher performance of the dithienyl derivative 3b compared to the monothienyl analog 3a, we have analyzed in greater detail the different components of the IPCE response. We have thus separately examined the two constituting factors of IPCE according to eqn (1): IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × APCE(λ)(1)where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency, associated to the ability of the cell to harvest the light, and APCE which is the absorbed monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency. APCE gives the true quantum efficiency of the cell for generating electric current (internal quantum efficiency) and is related to the electron injection efficiency from the dye to the semiconductor oxide Φinj, the dye regeneration efficiency ηreg, and the charge collection efficiency ηcoll.4,5 Since LHE can be directly measured only for transparent dye-coated films, as similarly performed for previous representative studies,5 the whole set of comparative IPCE, LHE, and APCE spectra were recorded for transparent 9 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 monolayers (Fig. 7 and Fig. S2 and S3 in ESI†).
 Fig. 7  IPCE of DSCs using cyclometalated Ru(II) sensitizers 3a and 3b (9 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 monolayer). 
From the comparative investigation it is evident that the IPCE efficiency of 3b over the whole visible wavelength range is much higher than 3a, with values which are almost twice as large for the former, in agreement with the measured photocurrent densities. Analysis of the LHE and APCE factors shows that both are higher for 3b than 3a. Therefore, 3b performs better than 3a for its better efficiency in the collection of photons when coated onto TiO2 films and its greater efficiency in converting them into electrons.
The properties of the thin films were investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)24 to elucidate the effects of the recombination processes on the performance of the DSCs. Due to the different involved kinetics the most detrimental recombination pathway is that involving the charge transfer between injected electrons in TiO2 and the oxidized forms of the electrolyte (I2 and I3−).25 The analysis of the impedance spectra was performed in terms of Nyquist plots (Fig. 8) where the imaginary part of the impedance was plotted as a function of the real part over the range of frequencies. The impedance of a DSC can be described by an equivalent circuit model, in which the different cell components and their interfaces are treated as discrete electrical elements (see inset Fig. 8). Under illumination at open circuit voltage conditions the properties of the TiO2–electrolyte interface can be derived from the DSC Nyquist plot in terms of recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance for charge accumulation in the semiconductor (Cμ), both associated to charge transfer phenomena at the interface between the oxide and the electrolyte. The results of the EIS investigation are summarized in Table 4, wherein the recombination resistance Rrec and the capacitance Cμ have been obtained from the width of the main arc and by fitting the data with the equivalent circuit reported in the inset of Fig. 8.24 The apparent electron lifetime τn can be calculated from τn = RrecCμ. The two cells show a similar chemical capacitance but the complex 3b exhibits a larger recombination resistance, which affords a three times longer electron lifetime. Thus, a more effective suppression of the dark current is present for the complex 3b likely due to the more extended terminal dithienyl substituent.

Conclusions
Two new Ru(II) cyclometalated complexes 3 based on thiophene-substituted 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridines have been synthesized, characterized, and tested in DSC devices. The optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic parameters have been compared with those of the corresponding complexes with no fluorine and/or thiophene substitution on the aromatic rings of the cyclometalating ligand. The introduction of the thiophene-based substituent causes a red-shift of the visible bands, with a more evident shifting for the dithienyl-based complex 3b, for which a red-shift is recorded for the band centered at 430 nm and a new band at ca. 380 nm appears compared to the monothienyl-based complex 3a. The dithienyl-based complex 3b showed significantly higher photocurrents compared to the similar devices with the other photosensitizers. This, combined to a larger cell photovoltage, afforded a power conversion efficiency of 5.7%, that is more than twice that of the complex 2 based on the unsubstituted 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. A detailed comparative investigation of DSCs based on the thienyl-substituted complexes 3a and 3b revealed that the higher efficiency of the latter mostly originated from a more effective IPCE and LHE (higher photocurrent) and a larger recombination resistance (higher voltage).24
These data are encouraging for the design of a new class of stable and high performing thiocyanate-free cyclometalated complex sensitizers for DSC. The investigation of new complexes based on a variety of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands substituted with tailored electron-acceptor and electron-donating substituents to further improve the optical and photovoltaic parameters is in progress.

(ii) With a microwave reactor. In a vial containing [Ru(CH3CN)4(FPh-Py-T)]+PF6− (0.015 g, 0.0196 mmol) in methanol (10 mL), were added 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (dcbpy, 0.0096 g, 0.0393 mmol) and NaOH (0.0031 g, 0.0775 mmol). The red-brown solution was put in a microwave reactor, modality dynamic, for 30 min at 100 °C (maximum pressure: 2 bar; maximum power: 280 W). The obtained dark-red product was dissolved in distilled water and acidified with HNO3 0.2 M, until a precipitate was formed. The dark-red precipitate was isolated by filtration under vacuum using fritted glass G4, washed first with some drops of water and then with diethyl ether.

Electrochemical investigation
The dyes were dissolved (10−4 M) in a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Fluka, electrochemical grade, >99.0%) in anhydrous DMF (Aldrich, 99.8%). Differential pulsed voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry were carried out at a scan rate of 20 and 50 mV s−1, respectively, with a PARSTA2273 EG&G potentiostat–galvanostat in a two-compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell. All the measurements were carried out in a glove box filled with argon ([O2] < 1 ppm). The working, counter, and pseudoreference electrodes were a well-polished Au pin, a Pt flag and a Ag/AgCl wire, respectively. The Ag/AgCl pseudoreference electrode was externally calibrated by adding ferrocene (10−3 M) to the electrolyte.
Preparation and characterization of DSCs
DSCs have been prepared adapting a procedure reported in the literature.23 In order to exclude metal contamination all of the containers were in glass or Teflon and were treated with EtOH and 10% HCl prior to use. Plastic spatulas and tweezers have been used throughout the procedure. FTO glass plates (Solaronix TCO 22–7, 2.2 mm thickness, 7 Ω per square) were cleaned in a detergent solution for 30 min using an ultrasonic bath, rinsed with pure water and EtOH. FTO plates were treated with a freshly prepared 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then rinsed with water and EtOH. A first transparent layer was screen-printed using a 15–20 nm transparent TiO2 paste (Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide T/SP). The coated films were dried at 125 °C for 6 min and then a titania scattering layer (Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide R/SP) was screen-printed. The coated plates were kept in a cabinet for 5 min and then thermally treated under an air flow at 125 °C for 6 min, 325 °C for 10 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. The heating ramp rate was 5–10 °C min−1. The sintered layer was treated again with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 (70 °C for 30 min), rinsed with water and EtOH and heated at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80 °C the TiO2 coated plate was immersed into a 0.1 mM solution of the dye in EtOH containing 1:1 chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for 20 h at room temperature in the dark. The thickness of the layers, consisting of a transparent 11 μm layer and a scattering 5 μm layer was measured by means of a VEECO Dektak 8 Stylus Profiler.
Counter electrodes were prepared according to the following procedure. A 1 mm hole was made in a FTO plate using diamond drill bits. The electrodes were then cleaned with a detergent solution for 5 min using an ultrasonic bath, 10% HCl, and finally acetone for 10 min again using an ultrasonic bath. After heating at 400 °C for 15 min a drop of a 5 × 10−3 M solution of H2PtCl6 in EtOH (1 mg mL−1 Pt) was added and the thermal treatment at 400 °C for 15 min repeated. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot-melt ionomer-class resin (Surlyn 25 μm thickness) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of the electrolyte solution was added to the hole and introduced inside the cell by vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed with a Bynel. An aluminium foil at the back side of the counter electrode was taped to reflect unabsorbed light back to the photoanode.
Photovoltaic measurements of DSCs were carried out using a 500 W xenon light source (ABET Technologies Sun 2000 Solar Simulator). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) using a reference Si photodiode. Values were recorded after 3, 24, 48 h, and 7 days of ageing in the dark and the best efficiencies collected as experimental results. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were recorded as a function of excitation wavelength (between 300–800 nm), using a monochromator (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) and a 400 W xenon lamp as incident light, in AC mode. The monochromatic light was mechanically chopped (chopping frequency of 1 Hz) and the AC-photocurrent response was measured using a lockin-amplifier. A white light bias (0.3 sun) was applied to the sample during IPCE measurements. LHE were measured on dye-coated 9 μm transparent TiO2 monolayers.
EIS spectra were obtained using an Eg&G PARSTAT 2263 galvanostat–potentiostat. The measurements have been performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz using an ac stimulus of 10 mV under 250 W m−2 (0.25 sun) illumination at open circuit conditions (no applied bias voltage).
