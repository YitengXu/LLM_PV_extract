    , Accepted 24th March 2022First published on 19th April 2022AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great research interest due to their significant device performance and optoelectronic properties. However, reducing charge recombination and efficiency loss due to surface defects of the perovskite layer are still big issues to overcome for PSCs. Herein, we have employed a simple molecule, 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (2TiCOOH), via post-treatment to passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ on the perovskite film surface and improve the stability at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface. The spectral results illustrate that the 2TiCOOH passivated devices exhibit higher carrier lifetime, charge extraction, and minimized defect induced recombination. Also, solar cells with 2TiCOOH show better charge collection, improved JSC, FF, and outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, 2TiCOOH passivated solar cells show tremendously stable performance output with less than 1% PCE drop after 100 days. This work provides a facile surface passivation strategy for fabricating highly efficient, low cost, and stable perovskite solar cells, which can be used for large scale technology and commercialization.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest because of their significant optoelectronic properties besides the ease of production and low-cost fabrication techniques.1–5 In the last decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic lead halide PSCs have jumped remarkably from 3.9%1 to 25.5%6 due to enhancements of the materials,7 solvents/antisolvents,8,9 and engineering of the interfaces.10,11 To achieve well-performed PSCs, the passivation of defects, elimination of the energy level mismatch at the interface, the improvement of the absorber film quality is the key parameter.7,12,13 The unsteady behavior of perovskite crystal decomposition would induce large disorders at the surface/interface of the perovskites such as iodide vacancies, clusters, and halide deficiency due to uncoordinated lead–halide ions.14,15 The abovementioned point/interstitial defects or vacancies in the perovskite lead to energy loss in the PSCs because of non-radiative recombination, which is caused by trap states at the surfaces and grain boundaries.16,17 Such surface defects act as charge recombination centers that involve less charge carrier extraction and reduce the device parameters such as fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (JSC). The defects also lessen long term stability, which is indispensable for commercialization through the uncoordinated halides migrating toward the metal contacts, which is among the essential degradation mechanisms of organic–inorganic lead halide PSCs.18,19 Intrinsic perovskite instability and humidity sensitivity could be solved with different strategies or applications that are interface engineering, material composition changing of an absorber, and bulk/surface and grain boundary defects passivation.12,16,20 In this context, the passivation of defects is a powerful and easy way to obtain efficient and stable devices via some methodologies such as surface treatments implementing functional molecules, pre-deposition, or post-deposition modifications.21 For example, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) was employed to passivate the dangling bonds in the perovskite layer and suppress the surface defects; thus, a higher efficiency was achieved.22 The treatment of the perovskite layer and hole transport layer (HTL) with pyridine, thiophene, thymine, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTS–2DPP), and other Lewis bases reduces the non-radiative recombination significantly and increases the efficiency of PSCs.23–25 Correlatively, an iodine-blocking layer has been inserted in the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, which leads to the suppression of iodine doping into Spiro-OMeTAD and obtaining better stability even at 85 °C.26
Herein, we report a detailed study on interface passivation between the perovskite film and HTL using the functional molecule 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (2TiCOOH) in organic–inorganic lead halide PSCs. 2TiCOOH is an electron rich Lewis base molecule that facilitates weak chemical interaction with the perovskite layer.27,28 The excess positive charge of the uncoordinated Pb atoms is neutralized by the sulfur atom in thiophene via bidentate coordination. We proposed that this passivation process increased the electron density of the Lewis base group and reduced non-radiative recombination, eliminating the deep level traps.23 Also, the intended surface passivation would enhance charge carrier transfer at the perovskite/HTL interface and cell performance, besides improving the device reproducibility and long-term stability. In addition, the acid part of the 2TiCOOH would decrease the recombination losses and degradation of the cells that hydrogen bonding interactions between the acid and Spiro-OMeTAD, which originated from its dispersibility and p–p interactions between the –COOH group and Spiro-OMeTAD.29 As a result, 3 mg mL−1 2TiCOOH-passivated devices exhibit higher JSC, FF, and PCE than those of the solar cell devices without passivation. On the other hand, over 100 days, the PCE of the unencapsulated devices without 2TiCOOH decayed dramatically to 50% of its initial value, while under the same conditions, the 2TiCOOH-passivated devices retain about 90% of their initial PCE, indicating that the 2TiCOOH passivation process enhances the long-term stability of the devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
2-Propanol, hydrochloric acid (HCL), titanium isopropoxide (TiOPr4), anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB), 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and caesium iodide (CsI) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2) was purchased from TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead bromide (PbBr2) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Lumtec. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Merck. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li–TFSI) were purchased from Acros. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Borun New Materials. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (25 × 25 cm2, 14 Ω cm−1) were purchased from OPV Tech. 2-Thiophene carboxylic acid was purchased from Fluka. All the purchased materials were used without any further purification.
2.2. Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were cleaned with an ultrasonicator for 15 min with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively. The cleaned substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 7 min to activate the surfaces. Titanium dioxide precursor solution (5.6 mL isopropyl alcohol, 35 μL hydrochloric acid, and 369 μL titanium(IV) isopropoxide) was coated by the spin coating method to form cd-TiO2. The compact layer TiO2 was formed by annealing at 460 °C for 60 min. The TiO2 layer was doped with Li by spin-coating with 150 μL Li–TFSI solution (30 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 3000 rpm for 10 s, and then annealing at 460 °C for 1 hour. After being cooled down to 170 °C, the films were immediately taken to the N2-filled glove box to deposit the perovskite layer. The triple cation perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving corresponding amounts of PbI2 (470 mg), PbBr2 (66 mg), MABr (18.81 mg), FAI (167 mg), and Csl (15 mg) in 1 mL DMSO/DMF (4/1) mixed solvent. The perovskite layer was coated by two-step spin-coating (2000 rpm 12 s and 5000 rpm 20 s, respectively) and 100 μL chlorobenzene was dropped 9 s before the end of the second step. Then, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour. After the perovskite deposition, 2-thiophene carboxylic acid dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene in different amounts was spin-coated with 100 μl at 4000 rpm for 40 s upon the perovskite layer as the passivation layer and annealed at 100 °C. The thickness values for 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% are 12.91, 14.52, and 17.41 nm, respectively) for 10 min. As the hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD (76 mg mL−1 in CB), which doped with 16 μL Li–TFSI (260 mg/500 μL ACN) and 30 μL 4-tBP was coated with 80 μL at 4000 rpm for 35 s. Finally, 8 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag contacts were deposited by a thermal evaporator.
2.3. Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were recorded by a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated illumination (AM1.5G, 100mWcm−2). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Si reference solar cell before each measurement. Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using an Enlitech QE-R measurement system. Electrochemical Impedance Measurements (EIS) were recorded by an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Co.) at different frequencies from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC electrical perturbation. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films deposited on top of the glass substrate were recorded using an Edinburgh Instrument with a 655 nm wavelength laser. Raman scattering was measured with a Renishaw Raman spectrometer.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Surface passivation
We prepared the triple cation perovskite layer with the composition of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 with a one-step solution process using the solvent washing method.30 The fabricated device architecture, chemical structure of 2TiCOOH, and schematic demonstration of the passivation process on the perovskite film surface with 2TiCOOH are illustrated in Fig. 1. 2TiCOOH was deposited on the top surface of the perovskite layer as a passivation interlayer the between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD by spin coating the solution of 2TiCOOH in chlorobenzene (CB). The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films with and without 2TiCOOH passivation show that the perovskite films are dense and pinhole-free, as can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†). There is not a large difference between the SEM images of 2TiCOOH passivated and the neat perovskite films, indicating that the passivation did not affect the morphology significantly. Contact angle measurements were carried out to determine the hydrophilicity of the perovskite surface after 2TiCOOH deposition (Fig. S2, ESI†). The surface becomes more hydrophobic after 2TiCOOH passivation (from 64.61° to 69.96°) in comparison with the neat perovskite surface. Due to the surface topography and roughness, which is related to the wettability, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the root mean square (RMS) values of the perovskite layers with and without 2TiCOOH passivation have been investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurement. The RMS values of the perovskite surfaces decreased slightly from 8.9 to 7.5 nm after 2TiCOOH passivation, in agreement with the optical images of the films. The perovskite crystal structure was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the control perovskite layers showed characteristic diffraction peaks at 14.0° and 28.3°, which are assigned to the (110) and (220) planes of the tetragonal phase 3D perovskite layer.31 A similar diffraction pattern was observed in the 2TiCOOH-treated perovskite film, demonstrating that 2TiCOOH passivation process did not change the crystal structure and the perovskite lattice. To take a closer look at the changes in the perovskite films after 2TiCOOH treatment, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were used. The same absorption edge for the perovskite films with and without passivation can be seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†), showing that the 2TiCOOH interlayer did not affect the perovskite energy band structure. To investigate the interaction between perovskite and 2TiCOOH, we carried out Raman spectroscopy. In Fig. 2a, one new weak Raman band at 225 cm−1 can be observed, which is related to Pb–S stretching in comparison with unpassivated perovskite surface.32 This band is proof of the Lewis adduct formation between the S atoms in 2TiCOOH and the uncoordinated Pb atoms in the perovskite film. The assignment of the broadband ranging from 271 to 310 cm−1 represents methylammonium (MA) torsional modes, which is predict the tetragonal structure.33 Meanwhile, to explore the mechanism of 2TICOOH passivation on the perovskite layer, we used X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). According to the XPS results, there was no S signal on the unmodified perovskite film and a small S 2p peak appeared at 162.8 eV after 2TiCOOH passivation, confirming the presence of S atoms on the modified surface (Fig. S6, ESI†). In Fig. 2b, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 peaks of the neat perovskite film appeared at 143.08 eV and 138.28 eV, respectively. After 2TiCOOH treatment, these Pb 4f peaks shifted to the low binding energy region and peaks appeared at 142.93 eV for Pb 4f5/2 and at 138.10 eV for Pb 4f7/2, which is evidence of the coordination between Pb+2 and S atoms in 2TICOOH. Also, the energy separation between the two Pb 4f peaks is 4.83 eV, which confirms the binding of Pb–S.34,35 To further understand the passivation effect of 2TiCOOH, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. The PL peaks of glass/perovskite and glass/perovskite/2TiCOOH substrates are seen at the same wavelength at 780 nm but the PL intensity increased about 35% after 2TiCOOH passivation (Fig. S7, ESI†). The PL intensity can reveal the quantity of the intrinsic defects in connection with charge carrier recombination centers.36 The increase in the PL intensity after 2TiCOOH treatment can be related to decreased surface non-radiative recombination centers and improved charge extraction. To deeply investigate the carrier recombination mechanism, TRPL is a widely used method. In our work, TRPL curves were fitted using two-component exponential decay, which are short PL lifetime (τ1) and long PL lifetime (τ2). τ1 is the shortest lifetime attributed to non-radiative recombination, which proceeds from defect or trap states, and τ2 corresponds to intrinsic radiative recombination.37 Meanwhile, Fig. 2c shows the TRPL decay of glass/perovskite and glass/perovskite/2TiCOOH, indicating that the PL lifetimes (τ1 and τ2) of the 2TiCOOH-treated perovskite film extended to τ1 = 0.46 ns and τ2 = 15.53 ns, which is much longer than that of the untreated perovskite film (τ1 = 0.33 ns and τ2 = 9.26 ns) yielding the lifetime of carriers. The longer carrier lifetimes of the 2TICOOH-passivated devices illustrate the reduced defect-assisted non-radiative recombination. In Fig. 2d, the time-resolved PL decay of glass/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits PL lifetimes of τ1 = 0.45 and τ2 = 7.78 ns, while the PL lifetimes are shortened to τ1 = 0.42 and τ2 = 6.48 ns after the 2TiCOOH modification of the perovskite film, demonstrating better charge extraction and improved solar cell performance.

3.2. Current voltage characteristics
Solar cells based on the 2TiCOOH-treated perovskite films were fabricated to interpret the passivation effect. The planar one-step solution-processed cells with n–i–p type architecture of FTO/TiO2/Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag were operated and three different concentrations of 2TiCOOH in CB (1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1) were used to passivate the perovskite layer. Table 1 shows the solar cell parameters of the devices with and without passivation and the effect of the concentration variation of 2TiCOOH on the device performance. The concentration of 2TiCOOH increased from 1 mg mL−1 to 3 mg mL−1, exhibiting favorable passivation effect, thus enhancing the PCE from 15.23% (control device) to 15.31% and 16.21%, respectively. With the increase in the 2TiCOOH concentration from 3 mg mL−1 to 5 mg mL−1, the device performance dropped to 14.07%, which can be attributed to reduced charge carrier transport caused by the over-thick interlayer. According to these results, 3 mg mL−1 was selected as the optimum concentration of 2TiCOOH for the passivation of the perovskite surface. Fig. 3a and b shows the typical current density voltage (J–V) under forward and backward (reverse) scan characteristics of the optimized devices. The control device, which is without 2TiCOOH treatment, exhibited a short circuit current (JSC) of 23.31 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1050 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.62%, giving a PCE of 15.23 (Fig. 3a). After 2TiCOOH passivation, the treated cells display enhanced PCE of 16.21% along with a JSC of 23.84 mA cm−2, VOC of 1030 mV, and FF of 0.66% under the same scan conditions (Fig. 3b). FF is a crucial parameter to achieve more efficient devices because of it is direct relation to undesired charge loss at the interfaces.38 The higher FF of the treated devices indicates reduced interfacial defect cites by the coordination of the S atoms in 2TiCOOH with the Pb atoms, leading to less charge recombination. Furthermore, the JSC was increased after 2TiCOOH passivation due to reduced defects, giving rise to enhanced charge collection. In addition to these, the hysteresis behavior was investigated to determine the effects of passivation on charge accumulation during the device operation. The difference between the forward and reverse scan directions of the devices without treatment are small, yet the cells with 2TiCOOH passivation show reduced hysteresis devices, which could be associated with improved charge collection and decreased defect sites.39 In Fig. 3c, the variation in the photocurrent density of the optimized devices with and without passivation was recorded for 100 s under stimulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 irradiance by applying a bias voltage near the maximum output point. Regarding the control devices, the stabilized power output is much improved with 2TiCOOH passivation, resulting in an output current density of ∼21.2 mA cm−2, whereas for PSC without treatment, the steady-state output current density was ∼20.5 mA cm−2. Fig. 3d illustrates the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices with and without 2TiCOOH passivation. The 2TiCOOH passivated devices represent stronger IPCE response, which can be result from recombination reduction40 with the integrated current density of 22.08 mA cm−2 being much higher than that of the integrated current density of the control cells of 20.53 mA cm−2. The integrated JSC of the J–V characteristics was slightly different because of the environmental conditions during the IPCE measurement.41 To verify the positive influence of 2TiCOOH passivation on the device performance, we investigated the solar cell data from 10 optimized devices. Fig. 4 represents the statistical performance including the distribution of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE data for the cells with and without treatment on the box chart graphics. According to the obtained results, the VOC data distributions of the cells are almost similar; however, the treated cells still show closer values (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the PCE, FF, and JSC distributions of the 2TiCOOH passivated cells are narrower than that of the control devices (Fig. 4b–d). In the presence of 2TiCOOH passivation, the devices show a better reproducibility of 90% with higher PCE in comparison with cells without treatment, exhibiting a reproducibility of 80%. To clarify the photoelectrochemical effects of passivation with 2TiCOOH, a series of optoelectronic measurements were performed. Dark current–voltage analyses were carried out to investigate the fundamental device behavior behind the observed improvements using the Shockley–Read–Hall equation.42 The dark current density–voltage curves of both the PSC devices are shown in Fig. 5a and the obtained electrical parameters including the reverse saturation current density (Jo) and ideality factor (n) are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The lower dark current density and reduced values of n and Jo in the 2TiCOOH passivated devices resulted in enhanced JSC and reduced charge carrier recombination.43,44 Besides the intrinsic properties of the perovskite, the electronic charge transport properties between the perovskite and the hole transport layer also affect the performance of the device. We measured the impedance spectra at an applied DC bias of near VOC and a frequency range from 100 MHz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots (imaginary and real parts of the impedance) of the PSC devices. In the Nyquist plot, the high-frequency response is associated with charge carrier transport resistance and the low frequency is related to ionic diffusion and charge recombination within the perovskite film and the interface of the adjacent layers.45–47 Similar values in the high-frequency region indicate the serial resistance of the devices since both the devices possess the same structure and contacts. In the low-frequency region, the passivated devices exhibit higher recombination resistance, indicating the suppression of charge recombination, resulting in more efficient charge transport at the interfaces than the non-passivated counterparts.41

These results clarify the reduced hysteresis of the treated devices and are also compatible with dark J–V results.48,49 To take a closer look at the charge extraction and recombination process, light intensity-dependent (1 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2) photovoltaic measurements were realized. The JSC and VOC values were extracted from the normalized current density voltage characteristics of the control and passivated devices under various light intensities. Fig. 5c represents the variation in JSC with light illumination. Using the power-law dependency, in which α is the slope of the natural logarithm of JSCversus the natural logarithm of light intensity, the value in the range of α = 0.98 and α = 0.99 was obtained for the control and the 2TiCOOH treated cells, respectively. An increased value of α indicates that charge extraction is improved and the bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism in the device.50,51 In addition, the charge recombination mechanism was analyzed by the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot of VOCversus light intensity using the following equation  where q is the electron charge, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, I is the intensity of incident light, and n is the ideality factor.52,53 In Fig. 5d, the slope that indicates the ideality factor (n) was found to be 1.32 and 1.64 kBT/q for optimized devices with and without 2TiCOOH passivation, respectively. The value of n introduces the dominant type of recombination mechanism where the unity value of n is responsible for bimolecular recombination and n = 2 represents trap-assisted recombination.49,54 The higher value of the ideality factor of the control devices indicates the dominant existence of the trap-assisted recombination. After 2TiCOOH passivation, the trap-assisted recombination is significantly suppressed due to reduced trap density in the perovskite film. These results confirm that the passivated devices exhibit higher FF and less hysteresis because they contain a low density of traps and hence ions.49
3.3. Device stability
The long-term stability of organic–inorganic PSCs is still one of the major challenges since they were invented. The intrinsic long-term stability tests of the fabricated devices were carried out using J–V analyses for 100 days without any encapsulation under the same storage conditions (T = 25 °C in the dark). The device figure of-merit is exhibited in Fig. 6, illustrating the variation of all the device parameters for over 2000 hours. Fig. 6a shows that the VOC of devices having 2TiCOOH passivation exhibited a minimal reduction of 30 mV over 100 days, whereas the control devices result in a significant drop of about 80 mV. Besides, it can be seen that the 2TiCOOH treated devices preserved 90% of their initial JSC values, while the non-passivated cell maintained only 55% of initial JSC in Fig. 6b. As presented in Fig. 6c, FF has also been investigated in 100 day-stability tests for devices. FF of cells without passivation showed a drop of about 30% of the first value, whereas the 2TiCOOH-treated cells preserved 95% of their initial value. The devices with 2TiCOOH passivation show a tremendously stable performance output with less than 1% PCE drop after 100 days. However, the drop of PCE was larger than 4% from the original PCE for cells without 2TiCOOH treatment (Fig. 6d). The obtained results have proved that 2TiCOOH served as a protective layer decreasing ionic defects which initiates the degradation of the perovskite film.55 In addition, it can be concluded that the relatively hydrophobic nature of 2TiCOOH could prevent water penetration into the perovskite layer and enhance the stability of the passivated devices against humidity.56 After 2TiCOOH passivation, PSCs displayed much better performance and long-term stability than that of the controller due to reduced charge recombination, defect passivation, and inhibition of the perovskite layer degradation.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we proposed 2TiCOOH molecule as a new interfacial passivation reagent that coordinates Pb atoms at the perovskite/HTL interface. Raman analyses demonstrated that the electron vacancies of uncoordinated Pb were filled by the electron-rich sulphur-atom in 2TiCOOH. Furthermore, the steady-state and time-resolved PL results proved that 2TiCOOH passivation reduced the defect-assisted charge recombination in the perovskite film and enhanced the charge extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface. Passivated devices with 3 mg mL−1 2TICOOH have exhibited improved JSC, FF, and higher PCE of the solar cells. Increased JSC (from 23.31 mA cm−2 to 23.81 mA cm−2), FF (from 62% to 66%), and PCE (from 15.23 to 16.21) after 2TICOOH passivation indicate enhanced charge carrier transport in the PSC devices. In addition, 2TiCOOH served as a relatively hydrophobic surface and acted as a protection layer against the degradation of the perovskite layer; thereby, the passivated cells have exhibited enhanced long term device stability. According to the stability tests, passivated devices with 3 mg mL−1 of 2TICOOH sustained about 90% of their initial PCE over 100 days, while the control devices lost 50% of the first PCE under the same conditions.
