    , Accepted 30th May 2016First published on 6th June 2016AbstractTwo organic small molecules based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units having a D–A–D–π–D–A–D structure denoted as DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were synthesized. Their optical and electrochemical properties relevant to organic solar cells were investigated. The wider optical absorption coverage from 450–800 nm, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (−5.23 eV and −5.34 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (−3.47 and −3.45 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively) make these small molecules suitable as donors for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells based on an active layer consists of a blend of these small molecules as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor with an optimized weight ratio of 1:2 cast from chloroform (CF) showed overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.98% (with Jsc = 5.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.84 V and FF = 0.42) and 1.85% (with Jsc = 4.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.42) for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP respectively. The relatively high Voc value based on the DPPTDPP based device has been attributed to the deeper HOMO of DPPTDPP compared to DPP-DPP. The optimized DPP-DPP:PC71BM (1:2) and DPPTDPP:PC71BM (1:2) active layers were subjected to two step annealing (TSA), i.e. thermal annealing and subsequent solvent vapor annealing and the corresponding BHJ organic solar cells showed a PCE of 5.28% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.52% (Jsc = 10.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V and FF = 0.56), respectively. The enhancement in PCE is mainly due to the improvement in Jsc and FF, related to light absorption in an active layer, a better nanoscale morphology, and an increase in the crystalline nature of the active layer and balanced charge transport, induced by the TSA treatment.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer have attracted significant attention over the last few decades due to their unique advantages such as light weight and low cost of fabrication.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs using conjugated polymers as donors along with fullerene derivatives as acceptors has increased from 1% to over 11% in the past 15 years2 with the morphology control of the active layer and device architecture. In comparison with conjugated polymers, OSCs based on solution processed BHJ active layers with small molecules as donors demonstrating many advantages, such as well defined structures and definite molecular weights, ease of purification and consistency in the batch to batch synthesis, have been investigated in the last few years.3 Moreover, high open circuit voltage (Voc) and hole mobility can be obtained by energy tuning via molecular engineering and novel design execution in the photoactive layer.4 Recently the PCE of 10% has been achieved for these solar cells, indicating that the PCE of small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) could be comparable with that of solar cells based on conjugated polymers and even higher PCE could be projected for SM-OSCs through the combination of suitable molecular design and device optimization.5 The frequently used strategy to enhance the PCE of SM-OSCs is to design low band gap donor–acceptor (D–A) materials by introducing an appropriate electron rich moiety (i.e. donor D) and an electron deficient unit (i.e. acceptor A). This strategy is used to tune both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies and the absorption profile for the better utilization of solar light absorption. A variety of structures such as D–π–A, D–A–D, D–π–D, A–π–A and D–π–A–π–D were designed and found to be promising as donors for BHJ SM-OSCs.6
The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety has recently proven to be an efficient electron acceptor unit used in the synthesis of both D–A copolymers and small molecules, because of its planar conjugated lactam structure, resulting in strong π–π interactions. The attachment of alkyl side chains at the DPP nitrogen atoms results in better processability.7 The thiophene and phenyl bridged DPP dimers as small molecule donors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been reported by Jo et al. in 2013.8 Balandier et al. and Choi et al. have shown that the thiophene bridged DPP dimers exhibit a blue shift in absorption with increase in the number of thiophene units between DPP moieties due to the higher flexibility of the conjugated π-system.9 A series of conjugated copolymers and small molecule donors based on the DPP unit have been successfully designed which exhibit promising photovoltaic performance, when used as donors in organic solar cell devices.10 DPP based copolymers used as donors for polymer solar cells showed a PCE between 6.05–9.4%.11 Huang et al.12 and Lin et al.13 employed small D–A molecules with DPP as the acceptor with the benzodithiophene (BDT) moiety as the donor, which demonstrated the PCE of OSCs to be greater than 5%. Peng et al. recently reported a D–A small molecule with porphyrin as the core and DPP as the arm used as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for SM-OSCs and achieved a PCE of 8.08%.14
In this manuscript we report the synthesis of two novel dimers of DPP containing vinyl and acetylene bridges between two DPP units having a D–A–D–π–D–A–D structure (denoted as DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP) by a straightforward method and investigated their optical, electronic and computational properties. The HOMO (−5.23 eV and −5.34 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively) and LUMO (−3.47 and −3.45 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively) energy levels of these small molecules indicate their applicability as donors for the BHJ organic solar cells along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. We have used these small molecules as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor for solution processed BHJ organic solar cells and achieved a PCE of 1.98% (with Jsc = 5.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.84 eV and FF = 0.42) and 1.85% (Jsc = 4.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.42) for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively. In order to improve the PCE further, we employed TSA (two step annealing i.e. thermal annealing with subsequent solvent vapor annealing) treatment of the active layer and significantly improved the PCE up to 5.28% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.52% (Jsc = 10.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V and FF = 0.56), for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively. This improvement has been related to a better nanoscale morphology for exciton dissociation, crystallinity for improved hole mobility, and balanced charge transport, leading to the higher values of Jsc and FF.
Results and discussion
DPP based small molecules denoted as DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of monobromo DPP1 with a half equivalent of bis(tributylstannyl)ethene and bis(tributylstannyl)acetylene in 65% and 58% yield, respectively (Fig. 1 and Scheme S1, ESI†). The precursor monobromo DPP1 was synthesized by the reported procedure from the literature.15 Both small molecules DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were purified by silica-gel column chromatography and are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene, and chloroform. DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra (as shown in the ESI†).

The normalized absorption spectra of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP dimers in chloroform (CF) and in thin films cast from CF are shown in Fig. 2 The maximum absorption peak (λmax) of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP in solution was observed at 618 nm (a molar extinction coefficient of 5.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 584 nm (a molar extinction coefficient of 4.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively, owing to the ICT transition between the donating and withdrawing groups. The difference in the absorption peak corresponding to the ICT band may be attributed to the different π-linkers in these small molecules. The thin film exhibited similar absorption spectra to those in solution, but the λmax value was redshifted and the peak was broadened, suggesting π–π intermolecular interactions in the solid state and leading to the enhanced π-electron delocalization across the molecular backbone.16 The absorption spectra of both DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP in thin films display strong absorption covering the entire range from 500–850 nm and also complementary absorption to PC71BM. The optical bandgap calculated from the absorption edge in thin film absorption spectra is about 1.54 and 1.62 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (CV and DPV) techniques in the dichloromethane solvent using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The CV and DPV plots of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP are shown in Fig. 3 and experimental data are listed in Table 1. Both DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP exhibit one reduction wave and two broad oxidation waves. The reduction wave corresponding to the DPP core was observed at −0.99 V in DPP-DPP and at −1.01 V in DPPTDPP, respectively. The oxidation waves were observed at 0.89 V and 1.34 V and 0.99 V and 1.29 V for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively. DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP show two oxidation waves, one corresponding to the oxidation of terminal thiophene and another to the oxidation of thiophene adjacent to the ethene or ethyne bridge.

The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP estimated from the first onset oxidation and reduction potential observed in CV measurements and are −5.23/−3.47 eV and −5.34/−3.45 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gap is the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is 1.76 and 1.89 eV for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively. The higher value of the electrochemical bandgap may be induced by the occurrence of an energy barrier at the interface between the DPP film and the electrode surface.16 The LUMO–LUMO offset between DPP-DPP and PC71BM (−4.0 eV) is about 0.65 eV, which is sufficient for efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface. The deeper HOMO level of DPPTDPP is advantageous for high Voc of the BHJ organic solar cell, when used as the donor along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor.
The thermal properties of the DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere and their plots are shown in Fig. 4. DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP exhibit high thermal stability and the decomposition temperature was found to be 355 °C and 304 °C at 5% weight loss respectively. The ethyne bridged DPPTDPP is more stable as compared to its ethene bridged analogue DPP-DPP. The thermal properties of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP were also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The melting temperatures were observed at 165 °C and 156 °C for DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP, respectively. However, no other transitions were observed which may be due to the low crystalline nature of the compounds.

The normalized absorption spectra of DPP-DPP:PC71BM blended thin films cast from CF are shown Fig. 5. Similar absorption spectra have been observed for DPPTDPP:PC71BM blended film. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the blended film showed a broad absorption profile covering the 350–750 nm range and showed the absorption band at around 386 nm, attributed to the absorption of PC71BM and the longer wavelength region corresponds to absorption of DPP-DPP in the active layer. This broad absorption is beneficial for the light harvesting efficiency of OSCs.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the geometry, and the electronic structure of the DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP dimers using the Gaussian09W program.17 The geometry optimization was performed in the gas phase. The DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31+G level for C, H, N, S, O and the frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 6. The long alkyl chains were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the computation time. The HOMO of DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP are distributed over the entire molecule whereas the LUMO is concentrated mainly on the DPP core. The electronic transition occurs from the HOMO orbital to the LUMO orbital.

Photovoltaic properties
The organic solar cell based on a blend active layer consisting of DPP dimers as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor was fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (85 nm)/Al. The active layer was deposited by spin coating at a constant concentration of 14 mg mL−1, comprising a mixture of DPP-DPP or DPPTDPP and PC71BM in CF. In order to optimize the photovoltaic response of the devices, the weight ratio between DPP-DPP or DPPTDPP and PC71BM was changed to 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1.2.5 and 1:3, of which the weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best power conversion efficiency. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the device based on the optimized active DPP-DPP:PC71BM and DPPTDPP:PC71BM spin cast from CF are shown in Fig. 7a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device showed a PCE of 1.98% with Jsc = 5.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.84 V and FF = 0.42 and 1.85% with Jsc = 4.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.42 for DPP-DPP:PC71BM and DPPTDPP:PC71BM based devices, respectively. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the device (Fig. 7b) closely resemble the absorption spectra of the DPP-DPP:PC71BM active layer (Fig. 5) indicating that both DPP-DPP and PC71BM are contributing to the photogeneration process. The Voc value of the device is quite high and is related to the deeper HOMO level of the donor molecules. The high value of Voc for DPPTDPP may be due to its deeper value of HOMO as compared to DPP-DPP. These devices showed a poor value of PCE, which is mainly attributed to the low values of both Jsc and FF. This may be due to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layer, which is a decisive factor for charge separation and charge transport within the device.

In order to further improve the PCE, we have adopted two step annealing (TSA) i.e. thermal annealing and subsequent solvent vapor annealing of the active layer as employed for OSCs based on conjugated polymers and small molecules.18 First of all we have used thermal annealing and solvent annealing separately and the photovoltaic data are complied in Table 2 for comparison. The J–V characteristics of the device processed with optimized TSA treated active layer are shown in Fig. 7a and the results are compiled in Table 2. The PCE of DPP-DPP:PC71BM and DPPTDPP:PC71BM has been increased up to 5.28% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.52% (Jsc = 10.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V and FF = 0.56), respectively. The enhancement in Jsc is consistent with the corresponding IPCE spectra (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7b, the IPCE values of the OSC processed with the TSA treated active layer were higher than those of the device without TSA, in the entire visible region of the spectrum and also have a broader profile. The Jsc values assessed from the integration of IPCE spectra are 5.28 mA cm−2 and 11.42 mA cm−2 for the devices with and without TSA treated active layers, respectively.
The Jsc value of the BHJ OSCs strongly relates to the light harvesting efficiency of the device, which in turn is the absorption profile of the active layer. Since the effect of TSA treatment on the photovoltaic response of devices based both the small molecule is similar, we are discussing this effect only for DPP-DPP based devices. In order to investigate the effect of TSA on the Jsc value of the device, we have recorded the UV-visible spectra of the blended thin film cast from CF and TSA treated film and shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, in comparison with the absorption spectrum of the DPP-DPP:PC71BM thin film cast from CF, the absorption spectra of TSA treated DPP-DPP:PC71BM showed a redshift and the overall absorption coefficient also increased, which are related to the enhanced π–π stacking.19 The increase in the absorption coefficient and broader absorption profile of the TSA treated active layer is attributed to the improvement in light harvesting efficiency of the device, thus resulting in higher Jsc.
A suitable nanoscale morphology of the active layer is an additional fundamental feature in balancing the different physical kinetics after the absorption of light by the active layer, i.e. exciton dissociation at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface in the active layer and transportation of free electrons and holes towards the electrodes. The surface morphology of the blended films with and without TSA treatment was investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 8. The blend film cast from CF shows a very smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.62 nm, indicating the poor phase separation between the donor and the acceptor phase, which hinder the charge transportation. However, for the TSA treated film, the RMS surface roughness of the active layer film increases to 1.84 nm and the phase separation was clearly observed in the phase image, indicating the better phase separation which is favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transportation, leading to an increase in Jsc, FF and PCE.20

The crystalline nature of the active layer is another factor that also affects the charge transport and collection, thereby disturbing the overall performance of the BHJ organic solar cell. The change in crystallinity of DPP-DPP:PC71BM with TSA treatment and the X-ray diffraction patterns of the blend films processed with CF and TSA treatment were recorded (Fig. 9). The film cast from CF shows a relatively broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.28° corresponding to crystalline domains of DPP-DPP. However, in the TSA-processed films, the diffraction peak becomes narrower and more intense, advocating for the growth of a greater number and also larger crystallites of DPP-DPP, compared to the film cast from CF. The active layer processed using TSA treatment is more ordered and the domain between the donor and the acceptor is well formed.21 Therefore, TSA favored promotion of DPP-DPP to exhibit improved crystallinity and network, which can further progress carrier transport.22,23 The overall increase in order in the molecular packing improves the film photon-to-current conversion efficiency and is likely to be accountable for the increase in Jsc.

Hole mobilities of the DPP-DPP:PC71BM film spin cast from CF solution with and without TSA treated were estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.24 The J–V characteristics of the hole only devices of the DPP-DPP:PC71BM active layer using the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au are shown in Fig. 10a. The hole mobility of 1.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for film processed with and without TSA treatment, respectively, was observed. This implies that the TSA improves the crystallization and molecular ordering in the blended thin film. The higher hole mobility is beneficial for the charge transport in thin films that will improve the Jsc value of the OSC. Moreover, from the J–V characteristics of the electron only device with structure ITO/Al/active layer/Al (Fig. 10b), the electron mobility is slightly higher for the TSA treated active layer (2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the as-cast active layer (2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Both the hole and electron mobilities of the TSA treated active layer are higher than the as-cast active layer attributed to better molecular packing of small molecules. But the degree of increase for hole mobility is higher than that for electron mobility. The ratio of electron to hole mobility for the device for as cast and TSA treated active layers are 20.51 and 2.7, respectively, resulting in a more balanced charge transport for the latter than the former. The balanced charge transport leads to the improvement in FF of the device.24

In order to investigate the effect of TSA treatment of the active layer on the exciton dissociation efficiency and photogeneration of the charge carrier in our organic BHJ solar cell, we have measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) as shown in Fig. 11. The Jph is given as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and under dark conditions, respectively. Veff is estimated as Veff = Vo − V, where Vo is the compensation voltage where Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage. Veff corresponds to the strength of the electric field within the device to extract the charge carriers after exciton dissociation. As shown in Fig. 11, at low Veff, Jph increases linearly with Veff and starts to saturate beyond 0.63 V and fully saturates at higher Veff for the device processed TSA treated active layer and Jph is independent of Veff. Therefore at full saturation, we assume that all the excitons generated after the absorption of photons by the active layer are associated with the free charge carrier and subsequently collected by the cathode (electrons) and the anode (holes). In the case of the device based on the as-cast active layer, Jph does not fully saturate even at a higher value of Veff, indicating that the field is not enough to extract the charges25 which is consistent with the low values of Jsc and FF. Jph at the highest value of Veff for as-cast and TSA treated devices is 10.23 mA cm−2 and 13.52 mA cm−2, respectively. Therefore the exciton generation and charge generation in the devices are influenced by the TSA treatment of the active layer. The maximum generation rate of free charge carriers (Gmax) was estimated accordingly Jphsat = qGmaxL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. Gmax is significantly influenced by TSA treatment with values of 7.1 × 1021 cm3 s−1 and 9.3 × 1021 cm3 s−1, for as-cast and TSA treated active layers, respectively. The increase in Gmax for the TSA treated device is consistent with the enhancement in the Jsc value as well as the UV-visible absorption coefficient, indicating more exciton generation and free charge carriers for the device processed with the TSA treated active layer. Moreover, the charge collection probability (Pc) estimated according to Pc = Jsc/Jphsat, for the devices fabricated from with and without TSA treatment was found to be 0.81 and 0.54, respectively. The higher value of Pc for the TSA treated device is attributed to the better phase separation between the donor and the acceptor in the active layer, increased electron to hole mobility ratio and enhancement in the light absorption ability.

Moreover, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were assessed from the slope of the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination around Voc and Jsc, respectively and are complied in Table 2. As illustrated in Table 2, the value of Rs decreased with TSA treatment can be attributed to the balanced charge transport and hence improved FF of the device.26Rsh is correlated with the leakage current27 and thus a slight decrease in Voc is observed for the device with the TSA treated film.
Conclusions
In this article, we have reported the synthesis of two new DPP-DPP and DPPTDPP dimers as small molecules with an optical bandgap of 1.54 and 1.62 eV, respectively, and investigated their optical and electrochemical properties due to their potential use as electron donors along with the PC71BM electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ organic solar cells. The literature reveals some reports on the synthesis of dimers of diketopyrrolopyrrole bridged via different aryl groups such as thiophene, bithiophene, fused thiophene, and naphthalene by different methods and few of them have been used in organic solar cells and shown a power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 1.30% to 4.4%. The solution processed BHJ organic solar cells based on optimized DPP-DPP:PC71BM (1:2) and DPPTDPP:PC71BM active layers cast from chloroform showed a PCE of 1.98% and 1.85%, respectively. In order to further improve the PCE, we have employed TSA treatment of the optimized active layer resulting in a device with an overall PCE of 5.28% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V and FF = 0.58) and 5.52% (Jsc = 10.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V and FF = 0.56), respectively. This improved PCE is ascribed to the enhancement in the Jsc and FF values, resulting from the enhanced IPCE response and better nanoscale morphology in the active layer, which leads to more balanced charge transport and enhanced mobility in the BHJ active layer.
