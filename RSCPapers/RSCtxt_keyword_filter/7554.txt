    , Accepted 5th January 2018First published on 5th January 2018AbstractLong-term stability of perovskite solar cells appears to be the bottleneck that limits its large-scale industrialization. Herein, we innovatively introduce gallium(III) acetylacetonate (GaAA3) as the precursor additive to in situ induce a metal–organic-complex monomolecular intermediate ([GaAA3]4), which allows to realize CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 (0 < x < 1) hybrid perovskite materials. The formed hybrid perovskites are proven to possess a thus far unreported structure with CsxFA1−xPbI3 core and [GaAA3]4 shell, and the presence of thin [GaAA3]4 shells remarkably enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite thin films. As a result of an effective passivation effect by the core/shell heterostructure, the formed perovskites demonstrate superior photoelectronic performance in comparison with the independent archetype 3-dimensional (3D) counterparts, e.g., they show low defect-state density, strong luminescence, and long lifetime of photo-generation charge carriers, which finally result in a high power conversion efficiency of 18.24% for core–shell planar perovskite solar cells. Equally important, the stabilized power output (SPO) of the unencapsulated cell remains over 18% for 5 h in an adverse atmosphere with 50% relative humidity (RH). The present study provides a facile approach to fabricate core–shell perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and long-term stability against moisture.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged as a class of dominant semiconductor materials in the photovoltaic field with an unprecedented sharp enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.7%. However, their inferior stability has been the most serious bottleneck toward commercialization of the perovskite solar cells. We incorporated gallium(III) acetylacetonate (GaAA3) to the perovskite precursor solution to in situ create a core–shell structure. The isomerized [GaAA3]4 shell is able to effectively protect the CsxFA1−xPbI3 crystallites against water ingress from ambient atmosphere and passivate its defect states, and thereby enhance the long-term stability while maintaining high PCE. As a result, the stabilized power output (SPO) of the unencapsulated planar solar cells remained over 18% for 5 h at forward applied bias under ambient atmospheric conditions with 50% relative humidity. Our study opens a new direction in the development of more stable and well passivated perovskite heterostructures, which will be an important step for ongoing developments in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide materials (AMX3, A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, NH = CHNH3+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br− and I−) have emerged as a promising class of light-harvesting absorbers in solar cells over the past seven years. Its power conversion efficiency (PCE) rapidly increased from 3.8% to 22.1%.1–10 However, the stability of the perovskite solar cells appears to be the bottleneck toward its commercialization.11,12
A typical three-dimensional (3D) perovskite crystal consists of A being 12-fold cuboctahedra coordinated with X anions and M occupying the center of an octahedral [BX6]4− cluster, which gives rise to a perfect cubic crystal lattice in an ideal case.13 In such structure, the generated heat in the solar cell by carrier thermalization may speed up the vibration of CH3NH3+ in [PbI6]2− octahedral frame, and thereby drive the CH3NH3+ group out of the perovskite lattice. Upon long-term light soaking, the separated CH3NH3+ is easily decomposed by means of photochemical catalysis. This irreversible decomposition process can give rise to defects associated with the lattice vacancies, and thereby reduce the stability of the thin films and, thus, the solar cells.14 The smaller ion radius of CH3NH3+ was assumed to be the main reason causing the unstable lattice structure.15 These smaller interstitial ions, i.e., CH3NH3+, in [PbI6]2− octahedral frame usually have a lower decomposition activation energy, which leads to the observed inferior thermal stability of perovskite thin film.1,6,9 The perovskite structure was also demonstrated to be easily decomposed in ambient atmosphere with relatively high humidity (>50% RH), which is likely the reason that the widely-used 3D perovskites can be considered to be intrinsically unstable. Various approaches including interfacial engineering,14,16–18 composition substitution9,19 and solvent engineering20 were employed to address the issue of stability of perovskite solar cells. However, it appears that the improved stability has been at the cost of the solar cell efficiency.
Recently, the homologous layered structure of 2D halide perovskites provide a promising class of efficient light-absorbing materials for solid-state photovoltaics with high stability.21–25 Henry Snaith et al. reported that the formation of 2D perovskite platelets, interspersed between highly orientated 3D perovskite grains, suppressed non-radiative charge recombination and exhibited average stabilized power conversion efficiency of 17.5%.26 Meanwhile, Shengzhong (Frank) Liu demonstrated that the cesium cation (Cs+) doped 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cells resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.7% with excellent humidity resistance.27 Despite the great success in the engineering of 2D/3D perovskite thin films and solar cells in terms of stability, it remains a great challenge to further advance the photovoltaic performance to the 22% efficiency as obtained for 3D perovskite films. Moreover, the interspersed 2D materials inside the hybrid perovskites may not effectively protect the whole perovskite thin film against humidity with respect to the exposed surface. Sealing off the potential paths from the outside sensitive atmosphere that might degenerate the perovskites seems to be essential toward fundamentally tackling the stability.
In this study, we took a novel approach to address the issue of volatility/vibration of the small cations in the 3D perovskite matrix. We incorporated gallium(III) acetylacetonate (GaAA3) to the perovskite precursor solution to in situ create a core–shell structure of perovskite crystals, which was confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The as-prepared [GaAA3]4 shell is able to effectively protect the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 crystallites against water ingress from ambient atmosphere and passivate its defect states, and thereby enhance the long-term stability while maintaining high PCE. As a result, the stabilized power output (SPO) of the optimized planar solar cells remained over 18% for 5 h at 0.84 V forward applied bias under ambient atmospheric conditions with 50% relative humidity.
Considering the high water vapor impermeability and hydrophobicity of GaAA3, we employed it as precursor additive, aiming to enhance the long-term stability of 3D perovskite thin films against moisture in ambient atmosphere. In particular, the additive GaAA3 was introduced by means of directly introducing various amounts of GaAA3 (0–60 mg mL−1, we refer to as Ga-0,…,Ga-60) into the precursor solution containing CsI (0.18 M), FAI (1.02 M), and PbI2 (1.2 M) in GBL:DMSO 7:3 (v:v), which allows an in situ induction process. Ideally, the GaAA3 additive would induce the precursor solution to generate a complex. The formed intermediate compounds were assumed to functionalize the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite crystals, which will be discussed below. To clarify the structural evolution of the hybrid thin films, we carried out the XRD studies of the as-prepared thin films as a function of the added amount of GaAA3 precursor. As shown in Fig. 1a, with increasing concentration of GaAA3 precursor, the as-prepared thin films tend to show two phases, which are ascribed to the cubic CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskites and the formed intermediate compound, respectively. Aside from the well-defined perovskites peaks, we observe XRD peaks at 5.5°, 10.8°, and 13.2°, which we attribute to the intermediate compound. The XRD results thus suggest that the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskites coexist with these intermediate compounds. However, the XRD patterns of the intermediate compounds are different from that of the pure GaAA3.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed to further certify the composition of the intermediate compounds (Fig. S1, ESI†). No signal due to Ga was observed for the control film, whereas the peak at 1116 eV and 1146 eV in the intermediate compounds can be ascribed to Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 respectively, and their intensity tends to increase with increasing Ga concentration (Fig. S1a, ESI†). This suggests that the Ga species is actually involved in the formation of the hybrid perovskite thin films. In addition, we fitted the C peak (Fig. S1b, ESI†). As expected, the peak at 288.4 eV originating from the sp2-bonded carbon (N–C–N) and the peak at 286.3 eV ascribed to CN were observed, respectively.28–30 Both of the peaks are associated with the FA+ group and their intensities are independent of the Ga concentration. Aside from these peaks, we also found a peak at 288.9 eV that can be ascribed to CO bonds.31 Again, the peak intensity appears to strengthen with increasing Ga concentration. This trend is also observed for the O peak, and the increased oxygen amount is thus considered to be likewise associated with the GaAA3 species involved.
To determine the crystal structure of the intermediates and the hybrid perovskites, we prepared the GaAA3 additive and intermediate compound single crystals by means of simply dissolving GaAA3 in acetylacetonate with/without DMSO solvent (details can be found in Experimental section). The corresponding single crystal structures were resolved and refined by SHELXT and OLEX2,32,33 and the detailed crystallographic parameters and thermal ellipsoid representation for single crystal structures are shown in the ESI† (Table S1, Fig. S2 and CIF files). The intermediate compound is clearly confirmed to be an isomerized complex from GaAA3, which displays a kind of sheathlike arrangement. Here, we referred it as [GaAA3]4 unless otherwise mentioned. After the isomerization process, the spatial arrangement of GaAA3 is changed from P2(1)/n (monoclinic crystallographic system) to Pna2(1) (orthorhombic crystallographic system) that has relative high spatial symmetry. Moreover, the lattice size of the unit cell of the [GaAA3]4 single crystal is significantly enlarged by a factor of ∼4 in comparison with a GaAA3 single crystal (Fig. 2a and b). It is worth noting that the minimum asymmetric unit for a GaAA3 single crystal can be simply regarded as a monomolecular GaAA3, whereas the four-molecules configuration of GaAA3 with different torsional angle and Ga–Ga atom distance is certified to be the minimum asymmetric unit in the case of [GaAA3]4 single crystal, which enables to enlarge its unit cell while maintaining the exact same monomolecular structure as the GaAA3 single crystal. We then calculated its XRD patterns according to the single crystal results. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the XRD pattern of GaAA3 single crystal is the same as that of GaAA3 commercial powders. Meanwhile, the XRD patterns of [GaAA3]4 single crystal are exactly the same as the so far unidentified peaks in the case of hybrid perovskite thin film, allowing us to confirm that the as-prepared perovskite thin film can be considered a CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 hybrid structure.

Fig. 1b and c magnify the corresponding XRD patterns of the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 hybrid perovskite thin films. To avoid any error, the stable FTO peak located at 26.5° was used as a reference (Fig. 1d). Obviously, the peaks of (100) plane remain stable, whereas the peaks of (110) plane shift toward higher angle with increasing GaAA3 concentration. For GaAA3 concentrations up to 20 mg mL−1, the peaks of (110) plane stay at the same position. It turns out that an increasing amount of [GaAA3]4 is able to continuously distort the lattice of 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskites up to a certain point, whereas superfluous [GaAA3]4 cannot affect the lattice structure any further. We will discuss the potential reasons hereafter, in combination with the micro-characterization results.
To elucidate the growth morphology and structure of the hybrid CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 thin films from a micro-dynamics and thermodynamics point of view, we performed HRTEM (Fig. 2d–f). This clearly points out that the hybrid thin films possess a kind of core–shell structure (Fig. 2d). As shown in Fig. 2e and f, we present the HRTEM image of the junction region taken from the dashed rectangle of Fig. 2d, which clearly exhibits the heterostructure between the CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite core and the [GaAA3]4 shell crystallographic phases. As expected, the core CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite displays a cubic perovskite phase judging from the interplane distance. The corresponding d value is 3.1 Å for the (200) plane, which is exactly the same as obtained from the XRD result of pure perovskites. On the other hand, the interplane distance in the shell is 4.1 Å, which is consistent with the XRD results of [GaAA3]4 thin films (Fig. S3, ESI†). Fig. 2f exhibits the Fourier transforms of corresponding lattice fringe of the perovskite and [GaAA3]4, and the major diffraction spots are indexed in yellow with a subscript C (cubic system) and O (orthorhombic system), respectively. We assume that the core/shell structure is related to the different nucleation rates of the perovskite and [GaAA3]4. In particular, the perovskite crystal template is firstly formed along with low miscibility of GaAA3 during the spin coating process. The [GaAA3]4 shell is afterward coated on perovskite core with the evaporation of DMSO solvent during the following annealing process, in which the isomerized [GaAA3]4 singe crystal is nucleated and grown with respect to its relatively higher solubility in DMSO. The evaporation of DMSO triggers the isomerized process of GaAA3, which gives rise to the formation of core/shell CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4. It is presumed that the homogeneous [GaAA3]4 shells are formed as a result of the in situ induced growth of truncated 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 cubes. The highly oriented cubic perovskites promote this unusual type of crystal growth. The heterogeneous crystal growth mechanism for the formation of the [GaAA3]4 shell can be understood by considering multiple truncated cubes, at different orientations to one another, trying to form simultaneously from the same highly faceted 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 core, providing multiple surfaces at different angles for growth of the [GaAA3]4 shell.
The HRTEM reveals the perfect hetero-epitaxy between CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite and [GaAA3]4 shell, facilitated because the (100) and (110) plane family of 3D cubic CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite has almost the same orientation as their counterpart in the [GaAA3]4 shell. This epitaxial growth is favored by the similar lattice parameters of both structures in these two directions. In particular, along the direction of (h00) plane family, there is alternating arrangement of Pb–I without the Cs+ and/or FA+ ions located at the A sites in this series plane family, whereas one can find that these ions/groups (Cs+/FA+) are arranged along the orientation of (hk0) plane family. This discrepancy is likely the reason that the (100) peak remains stable upon variation of the GaAA3 concentration, while a slight shift toward higher diffraction angles is observed for the (110) peak, which is associated with the disturbance of the crystal lattice as the [GaAA3]4 shell epitaxially grows on the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite in the heterostructure region (Fig. 2c). In this scenario, [GaAA3]4 is expected to alternately and lineally arrange with corner-sharing [MX6]4− octahedral along its orientation direction at the heterostructure region at the core/shell interface.
To clarify how the shell connects with the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite, we prepared the hybrid GaAA3·MAI single crystal and resolved its structure. The detailed crystallographic parameters are shown in the ESI† (Table S1) and the minimum asymmetric unit of single crystal is displayed in Fig. 2b, respectively. In general perovskites, excess ions, i.e., iodide (I−) or methylammonium (MA+) are likely present as interstitial defects and are quite mobile throughout the film, which is known to inadvantageously facilitate ion immigration and thereby induce hysteresis effects.34,35Fig. 2b clearly demonstrates that the GaAA3 connects with MA+ by means of hydrogen bond between the H atom in MA+ and O atoms in GaAA3. The single crystal structure implies that the shell prefers to link with MA+ and excess I− ions, which enhances the stability of perovskite structure while decreasing defect states in the perovskite film and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices.

Fig. 3a–c display the top-view SEM images of perovskite thin films with different concentration of GaAA3 additives (Ga-0, Ga-1.5, and Ga-10). Clearly, the perovskite morphology varies and the grain size appears to be smaller with increasing concentration of GaAA3 additives. As mentioned previously, the in situ induced process likely distorts and/or distributes the crystal lattice in the inter-junction domain, thereby shrinking the grain size of perovskites via truncating 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 cubes by means of interpenetrated shell growth.
It is well known that the organic-inorganic perovskite materials are hygroscopic and soluble in water.16 The GaAA3 is widely known to possess superior hydrophobicity performance and the corresponding [GaAA3]4 shells are thereby presumed to be notably moisture resistant, which is definitely favorable to protect the 3D perovskite against humidity in ambient environment. Following this train of thought, we carried out the hydrophobic interaction experiment by means of contact angle measurements between the modified CsxFA1−xPbI3 films and water. Fig. 3d–f show that the corresponding water contact angle increases from 53.1° to 72.6° after the introduction of GaAA3 with increasing concentration, which demonstrates a significant enhancement of hydrophobic property of perovskite thin film due to the GaAA3 additive. Besides, we carried out the waterproof experiment with the control thin film and the as-prepared core/shell hybrid thin film. As the video shows (ESI†), the black control thin film immediately changed to yellowish when contacting water, associated with the formed PbI2 derived from the decomposition of CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite and/or the yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-FAPbI3). In contrast, the color of the as-prepared core/shell hybrid thin film remains black and is extremely well water resistant. In this regard, the formed [GaAA3]4 shells are distributed homogeneously over the grain boundary of 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3, making them to function as a barrier preventing moisture permeation.

Fig. S4 (ESI†) demonstrates the stability test on the control and hybrid core/shell perovskite thin film at different times (24 h, 42 h, 60 h). Note that the test humidity was controlled to be 100% at room temperature by means of saturated steam (Fig. S4a, ESI†). As expected, the control perovskites were gradually decomposed to PbI2 with time, and nearly pure PbI2 was obtained after 60 h under such severe conditions. In contrast, the hybrid core/shell perovskite was demonstrated to retain its color and phase, which is testified by the corresponding XRD characterizations (Fig. S4b, ESI†).
As high-quality films are usually associated with slower photoluminescence (PL) decays and longer lifetime, we carried out the steady state and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra with different GaAA3 additive concentration (0 mg, 1.5 mg and 10 mg), respectively.36Fig. 4a exhibits the steady state local PL spectra of the corresponding perovskite thin films, inset image displays the device structure. Clearly, the 3D CsxFA1−xPbI3 thin film exhibits a stronger local PL emission with increasing concentration of GaAA3 additive. We assume that the presence of the [GaAA3]4 shell shifts the conduction and valence bands of 3D perovskites away from each other and thereby causes band-gap widening. It should be noted that reduced band-gap energy is different from the energy of the optical gap. The optical gap remains stable with the variation of involved GaAA3, which is associated with the band filling rather than the simple recombination of photo-generated carriers (Fig. S5, ESI†).37

(b) Corresponding time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the as-obtained thin films (inset exhibits the fitted decay time). (c) Quantified lifetime of the corresponding films. (d–f) Bulk fluorescence lifetime imaging the corresponding films. 
In order to further verify the recombination rate of carriers, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was conducted using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method at a fixed acquisition time (Fig. 4b). Three TRPL spectra of glass/perovskite devices are displayed in Fig. 4b and fitted with exponentials. The local PL decay time of control perovskite device are τavg = 94 ns. The PL decay time of Ga-1.5 and Ga-10 device are τavg = 223 ns and τavg = 396 ns, respectively. The ultra-long decay time of 3D perovskite thin film with GaAA3 additive suggests that the film owns superior heterostructure region. The trap states in perovskites were certified to mainly originate from the under-coordinated metal cations and halide anions at the crystal surface. The relatively deep trap-state energy-level would result in severe potential wells at grain boundaries for charge carriers and thereby give rise to serious trapping, accumulation, and recombination.38,39 In this scenario, the epitaxial growth of [GaAA3]4 shells likely participates in constructing the bulk heterostructure with perovskite, leading to an effective trap-state passivation in the interface region, which is favorable to promote charge carrier transport and reduce charge carrier recombination.26
We used the fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to detect the bulk PL lifetime of the control, Ga-1.5 and Ga-10 films, respectively (Fig. 4d–f). The data can be found in Fig. 4c. In all of the cases, the bulk PL lifetime displays a homogeneous distribution throughout the thin films. Consistent with the images where bright regions had fewer nonradiative pathways, bright regions (red-greenish) suggested a slower PL decay. Particularly, most of the perovskite domains in the control thin film had a relative short lifetime around ∼5 ns, whereas the lifetime distribution was widely broadened in the case of usage of GaAA3 additives, where it was centered on ∼6 ns. With increasing GaAA3 concentration, the lifetime distribution increased significantly up to 8 ns. Again, the variations in PL intensity in the hybrid perovskite films suggest local variations in nonradiative decay. Previously, the PL dynamics was modelled as a combination of trapping, monomolecular, and bimolecular recombination.36 In this regard, we assumed a higher trap-state density in the dark region as compared to the bright region, which we will demonstrate afterwards.
To further investigate the defect-state density, we fabricated perovskite film-based hole (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CsxFA1−xPbI3/Au)/electron (FTO/TiO2/CsxFA1−xPbI3/PCBM/Au)-only devices. We calculated the hole and electron trap-state density (Ntrap) taking the logarithm of J–V curve in dark, both with the control and CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 films, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). The current increased linearly with the voltage up to a clear kink-point. Further increasing the voltage over the kink-point, the current shows a more rapid exponential rise, which is due to filling of the trap states by the injected carriers. The applied voltage at the kink point is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which allows determining the trap density as follows:40Ntrap = ed2/VTFL(2εε0), where d is the film thickness, e and ε0 represent the elementary charge and vacuum permittivity, respectively. The relative dielectric constant of perovskite ε is ∼35.41 The thickness of the measured films is 0.35 μm. After fitting and calculating, the corresponding electron trap density is 2.93 × 1016 cm−3 for the control CsxFA1−xPbI3 film and 8.52 × 1015 cm−3 for the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 film. In contrast, the corresponding hole-trap density is 2.49 × 1016 cm−3 for the control CsxFA1−xPbI3 film and 8.21 × 1015 cm−3 for the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 film. Clearly, in both cases, both for electrons and holes the core–shell hybrid perovskite thin film exhibits a defect-state density which is a factor three lower than the control CsxFA1−xPbI3 films. The presence of [GaAA3]4 shell can effectively passivate the trap states along the grain boundaries, which also accounts for the blue shift of PL peak as observed in previous report.42

We then carefully studied the photovoltaic performance of as-fabricated core/shell perovskite solar cells prepared by tuning the concentration of GaAA3 additives (Fig. S6, ESI†). The Ga-1.5 solar cell displays the best overall photovoltaic performance. Fig. S7a (ESI†) demonstrates the VOC decay. The decay times (τ) were fitted and calculated to be 0.15 ms and 2.23 ms for the control CsxFA1−xPbI3 device and CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 device, respectively, which suggests an obvious decrease of the charge-carrier recombination rate by the thin [GaAA3]4 passivation shells.

Fig. 6a gives the J–V curves of the best solar cell with Ga-1.5 core/shell perovskites, which exhibits, in the reverse scan, a high JSC of 22.48 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.98 V and a FF of 0.82, resulting in a PCE of 18.24%. In the case of the forward scan, the J–V curve is almost identical to the reverse scan except for a slight decrease of FF from 0.82 to 0.79. It should be noted that our optimized CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 solar cell exhibits an unprecedented FF for a perovskite solar cell, with a value of 85% (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The inset curve of Fig. 6a shows the statistic PCE distribution for the control and the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 solar cells. Obviously, the statistical average PCE shows a significant improvement in PCE, from 14% to 17% upon introduction of the GaAA3 additive. The measured JSC is consistent with the integrated JSC of 22.46 mA cm−2 determined from external quantum efficiency as shown in Fig. 6b. Note that the thickness of [GaAA3]4 shell was proved to be only few nanometers between perovskite grains. In heterojunction thin films, the charge transport ability through ultra-thin insulating film is usually linearly dependent on the applied voltage, which enables the injected charge to be extracted at high offset voltages. Likewise, the charge-carrier recombination efficient was found to be strongly reduced in the presence of ultra-thin insulating film.43 In this regard, the presence of ultra-thin [GaAA3]4 shell plays a crucial role in passivating the trap state in interface region, thereby facilitating the charge carrier transport and reducing charge carrier recombination as we mentioned above.

In order to rule out the influence of hysteresis effects on the transient photocurrent density and stabilized power output of the cells, we performed the photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency as a function of time for the same cell held close to 0.84 V forward bias. As shown in Fig. 6c, the photocurrent density and stabilized power output of the unencapsulated devices remain stable for 5 h, and a highly stable PCE over 18% and JSC over 21.35 mA cm−2 was obtained. Likewise, the long-term stability of the control and the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 solar cells in ambient environment (50% humidity, T = 25 °C) was also studied and the results are shown in Fig. 6d. Clearly, the decrease in PCE in the case of the CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 solar cell in this high humidity ambient is less than 10% over 800 h, while that for the control devices shows more than 30% decline. The long-term stability of the power conversion efficiency suggests that these core/shell hybrid perovskite solar cells are a possible avenue towards a highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cell.
In addition, we tried to prepare other metal(II)- and (III)-based acetylacetone compounds, e.g., aluminum(III) acetylacetonate (AlAA3), cobalt(III) acetylacetonate (CoAA3), chromium(III) acetylacetonate (CrAA3), and nickel(II) acetylacetonate (NiAA2), and fabricate the hybrid solar cells. The AlAA3-based perovskite solar cells exhibit slightly improved photovoltaic performance, whereas the other metal based acetylacetone compounds obviously quenched the photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells. Both of Al and Ga are group III elements, which likely functionalizes the perovskite thin films and devices the same way, accounting for their similar characteristics. Further studies concerning the effect of other metal(II)- and (III)-based acetylacetone compounds on perovskite solar cells are underway.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile approach to prepare core/shell passivated perovskite crystals as a thin film for solar cell applications. By carefully controlling the GaAA3 additive concentration, we obtained CsxFA1−xPbI3–[GaAA3]4 hybrid perovskite thin films with well-matched passivating interfaces between the 3D perovskite crystals and the [GaAA3]4 shells, enabling a longer recombination lifetime of carriers and a decreased trap-state density. Importantly, the [GaAA3]4 shells allow to significantly improve the hydrophobicity of the film, reducing moisture penetration, and thereby remarkably enhancing the long-term stability of the corresponding device against humidity. Consequently, the optimized core/shell hybrid perovskite solar cell displays high PCE and long-term stability under 50% RH conditions in comparison to the control device. This core/shell nanostructure provides a mechanism to relieve the stability issue of perovskite solar cells. The present study opens a new direction in the development of more stable and well passivated perovskite heterostructures, which will prove to be an important step for ongoing developments in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged as a class of dominant semiconductor materials in the photovoltaic field with an unprecedented sharp enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.7%. However, their inferior stability has been the most serious bottleneck toward commercialization of the perovskite solar cells. We incorporated gallium(III) acetylacetonate (GaAA3) to the perovskite precursor solution to in situ create a core–shell structure. The isomerized [GaAA3]4 shell is able to effectively protect the CsxFA1−xPbI3 crystallites against water ingress from ambient atmosphere and passivate its defect states, and thereby enhance the long-term stability while maintaining high PCE. As a result, the stabilized power output (SPO) of the unencapsulated planar solar cells remained over 18% for 5 h at forward applied bias under ambient atmospheric conditions with 50% relative humidity. Our study opens a new direction in the development of more stable and well passivated perovskite heterostructures, which will be an important step for ongoing developments in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
