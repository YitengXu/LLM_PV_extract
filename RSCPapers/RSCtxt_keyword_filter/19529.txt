    , Accepted 14th March 2019First published on 3rd April 2019AbstractThe development of coordination polymers (CPs) originated from crystal engineering, which mainly focuses on crystals and their physico-chemical properties. This has now reached molecular- and nanoengineering, which push these CPs into practical applications. Depending on the application, the deformability of CPs becomes an important issue. To use CP films in flexible devices, it is necessary to develop CP films that can be bent/stretched. The present review illustrates how nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry work cooperatively to make CP films soft through numerous procedures. These soft films show non-interrupted performances under mechanical deformation, demonstrating that CPs can be used in next-generation flexible devices.

Design, System, Application
This manuscript summarizes the recent advances in the integration of coordination polymers, a class of an emerging molecular solids, for mechanically flexible films. Several supramolecular strategies have been incorporated into this manuscript. Specific applications including sensing, energy storage and conversion, and information storage benefit from the design of these flexible films. Thus, these unique molecular films can be used in wide applications.

1. Introduction
Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), are an emerging class of molecular solids with great potential in various applications.1–12 CPs are generally formed by coordination bonds between metal-containing nodes and organic ligands, and therefore are recognized as typical inorganic–organic hybrid materials. In general, CPs are categorized as brittle inorganic materials. Although some CPs are called soft crystals because their lattice structure can deform upon external stimuli, the change in dimension is usually less than 0.1 nm. From the point view of mechanical engineering, this type of deformation is not significant.13–21 In most applications such as gas storage or catalysis, CPs are often used in particulate form. However, the need for flexible films of CPs has become urgent in some growing areas such as wearable electronic devices, foldable batteries, membranes, and air purifier masks.22–32 In these cases, films composed of CPs should be able to deform significantly, for example like rubber, when stress is applied.
To fabricate flexible films, the combination of nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry is useful. Nanotechnology can lead to anisotropic low-dimension nano-components. Low-dimension nanocomponents have a limited number of repeating units in one or two dimensions, permitting materials to be foldable or curled.33 At the nanoscale, intermolecular interactions become significant. These non-covalent interactions can manipulate and connect nano-CPs to generate films. Since supramolecular interactions are relatively weaker than ionic bonding or covalent bonding, CP films can deform elastically. Nanoarchitectonics, which is the combination of nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry, has been demonstrated to be effective for the fabrication of many soft materials.34–38 In this short review, we summarize the examples of flexible CP films fabricated through nanoarchitectonics. To distinguish this concept from nano-CPs, which are brittle and summarized in other papers and reviews,39–59 this review will focus on “flexible films” of CPs. We will discuss the synthetic strategy first, then illustrate the significance of these flexible films in various applications.
2. Synthetic strategy
To overcome their intrinsic brittleness, CP crystals need to be hybridized with other flexible materials, softened by molecular design or downsized into low-dimension nanostructures. The related synthetic strategies are summarized below.
2.1 Incorporation of flexible scaffolds
One of the most used strategies is to form composites with flexible scaffolds. By incorporating CPs with flexible substrates, the composite films can inherent the flexibility from the substrates and become soft.
The colloidal route is a widely applied strategy. In general, CP particles are mixed with flexible polymers to form a suspension in a solvent. After evaporation of the solvent, the CP particles are anchored on the networks of the polymers. The anchored CP particles do not detach from the polymer matrix during deformation of the polymers, making the whole composite robust and flexible.60–63 For example, EuxTb1−x(L)1 was formed by coordination between L (L represented ligand) and LnCl3·6H2O (Ln = Eu, Tb) in dichloro–ethanol (1:1) solvent.60 The obtained CP crystals were dispersed in MeOH solution to form a colloidal solution. By casting this solution together with a DMF solution of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), a composite film several microns in thickness was obtained (Fig. 1). In this composite, PMMA was the matrix, while the EuxTb1−x(L)1 particles were dispersed in the matrix. Since the molecular structure of PMMA was not changed by the CPs, the composite was flexible. The emission behaviour of EuxTb1−x(L)1 was correlated to temperature, making the thin film useful as a temperature sensor.60 The evaporation conditions for the colloidal suspension can determine the final structure of the composites. Through natural evaporation of solvents, the polymer chains gradually gather together, forming dense films or membranes. When freeze-drying is employed, the distance between the polymer chains can be retained after removal of the solvents, leaving networks with large pores. For example, in a typical operation, MOF particles were mixed with cellulose nanofibrils (CNCs) to generate a colloidal suspension.63 Surface interactions such as van der Waals interaction were generated between the MOFs particles and the CNCs. Then, a solution of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was mixed with the CNC/MOF suspension. The CNCs were crosslinked with the CMCs to form clusters. Interestingly, the MOF particles were trapped inside the clusters due to the surface intramolecular interactions between the MOFs and CNCs. These clusters were stable in the colloidal suspension. The suspension was frozen first, and after freeze-drying, aerogels were left. In the aerogel, the MOFs particles did not occupy the pores inside the aerogel, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Thus, the aerogels could be compressed reversibly. The flexibility of the aerogel was due to the crosslinking between the CNCs and CMCs. In contrast, the samples without CMCs inside were brittle (Fig. 2b and c).

To make the composite wearable, the colloidal process can be further alternated. For instance, preformed multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) arrays were grown vertically on a substrate first.64 Then, MWCNT sheets were drawn from the substrate and stacked together. Subsequently, a ZIF-67 colloidal suspension in ethanol was drop-casted on the MWCNT sheets. After deposition, the sheets containing ZIF-67 crystals were twisted into fibers. The fibers could be easily further processed to make wearable devices (Fig. 3).64

When flexible substrates possess groups to interact with CPs, in situ crystallization of the CPs inside/on the flexible substrates becomes possible.65–67 For instance, filter paper is a foldable porous substrate. Thus, the deposition of ZIF-8 on filter paper can lead to a composite, which is expected to be a good adsorbent. However, the surface interaction between the paper and ZIF-8 is relatively weak. To solve this problem, filter paper was carboxymethylated to generate a negatively charged surface, which had strong electrostatic interaction with the positively charged ZIF-8 particles. Therefore, crystallization of ZIF-8 inside the filter paper became possible (Fig. 4).65 Besides electrostatic interaction, chemical bonding is another way to integrate CPs inside polymer substrates. Cotton fabric contains carboxylate side groups. These groups can coordinate with Cu2+ ions. Coordinated Cu2+ ions have unsaturated coordination sites, and thus can be further linked with tricarboxylates ligands to generate CPs. Therefore, by using cotton fabric as a scaffold, HKUST-1 crystals could grow on the fibers of the cotton fabric matrix.66 If the polymer scaffold does not have appropriate side groups to bind CPs, a modification agent can be used to coat the surface of the targeted scaffold. For instance, bacterial cellulose was modified with poly-dopamine (PDA), which could coordinate with metal ions. With a layer of PDA, crystallization of ZIF-8 occurred on the surface of the modified bacterial cellulose scaffold to form a composite (Fig. 5).67

The diffusion sequence of ligands and metal ions plays an important role during in situ crystallization.68 When a sodium alginate matrix was used, loading metal ions first led to crosslinking of the polymer chains because the Na+ ions were replaced by divalent metal ions. The subsequently added ligands could not diffuse into the matrix, and thus reacted with the divalent metal ions to form HKUST-1 or MOF-74, blocking the further penetration of the ligands into the scaffold. To overcome this blocking effect, the ligands had to be loaded inside the matrix first. In this case, the subsequently poured divalent metal ions were able to penetrate the matrix, forming uniform CPs (Fig. 6).

Polymer matrices containing metal sources can directly react with ligands to form CPs inside. When the channels of the matrix were full of ZnO, 2-methylimidazole ligands we added, which reacted with ZnO to form ZIF-8, occupying the channels of the matrix (Fig. 7).69 This soft membrane could even be curled on a rod (Fig. 7f). An advantage of this seeding technique is that the position of the MOFs is determined by the ZnO seeds. Therefore, MOF patterns were realized on paper when the ZnO seeds were patterned first.70

For some CPs, a single precursor can provide ligands and metal ions simultaneously. In this case, forced disassociation of the single precursor in the polymer matrix can be useful. For example, a double-network hydrogel was formed via the crosslinking of poly-acrylamide (PAAM) and poly-2-acrylamide-2methylpropanesulfonic acid (PAMPS).71 This hydrogel can release protons upon heating, which can trigger the dissociation of K3[Fe(CN)6] in solution, then prompt crystallization of Prussian blue (PB) crystals. Thus, by immersing this hydrogel inside a solution of K3[Fe(CN)6], PB nanocrystals were formed inside the hydrogel.71 By shaping this hydrogel into pipe first, PB crystals were fabricated inside the pipe (Fig. 8a). The colorless pipe changed to deep blue after formation of PB inside (Fig. 8b–d). This pipe could be bent at 90°, as shown in Fig. 8e. The existence of PB crystals was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), IR spectroscopy, and PXRD (Fig. 9).71

The in situ crystallization process can also lead to aerogels. After in situ crystallization of CPs in a wet matrix, the solvent-containing composite can be frozen first. Subsequent evacuation of the frozen composite results in flexible aerogels composed of both CPs and polymers. For instance, the cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) extracted from wood were coordinated with divalent metal ions to generate ionic gels. Ligands such as 2-methylimidazole or trimesic acid were diffused into the gel, then coordinated with the metal ions, forming MOFs inside the matrix. After freeze drying, a light-weight and flexible MOF aerogel was obtained (Fig. 10).72

Rather than discrete CP particles deposited in flexible scaffolds, continuous CP films are needed in some cases. To grow continuous CP films on flexible substrates, the density of the anchor groups coordinating with the CPs should be as high as possible. The hybridized interface needs to be carefully controlled. For a substrate possessing a limited number of anchor groups, depositing a buffer layer of polymer is helpful. For instance, the polyester surface of a flexible polymer substrate was connected with polyvinylamine (PVA) first.73 PVA contains rich amine groups, which were further bonded with bromoacetic acid (BAA). The final surface had high density of carboxylic groups exposed. Thereby, a continuous HKUST-1 film was deposited on the substrate (Fig. 11).73

To save time compared to stepwise growth, contra-diffusion synthesis is a possible route. In brief, a flexible scaffold (nylon membrane) was set between a 2-methylimidazole solution and Zn2+ solution (Fig. 12a).74 The concentration gradient forced the ligands and metal ions to diffuse to the counter sides. When the ligands and metal ions came into contact each other in the scaffold, continuous ZIF-8 films on both sides of the scaffold were obtained.74

Beside continuous films, patterning CPs is of great importance due to their unique optical properties and the demands in device fabrication. The plasma polymer coating technique was employed to selectively modify the surface of the targeted substrates. The modified areas of the targeted substrates were rich in carboxylate or amine groups. These groups had strong interactions with ZIF-9, guiding the preferential deposition of ZIF-9.75
It is known that cracks can form during the evaporation of colloidal films. In general, the formation of these cracks are uncontrollable. However, by controlling the evaporation front and withdrawing speed, pattern films can be obtained. For example, MIL-101(Cr) nanoparticles (around 25 nm in size) were dispersed in ethanol to form colloids. During the dip-coating process (Fig. 13a), three characteristic zones were identified. In zone I, which was just above the solution, the particles were in the form of a wet gel. In zone II, cracks emerged and propagated perpendicular to the drying line when the withdraw speed was less than 0.5 mm s−1. The competition between relaxation and accumulation eventually resulted in periodic cracks inzone III (Fig. 13b).76 Subsequently, the crack-type film was coated on a flexible polypropylene substrate (Fig. 13c).

Besides examples in which the flexibility comes from the scaffold, CPs can act as nodes to connect organic molecules to form flexible networks, and therefore are truly an essential component of flexible solids. To realize this aim, supramolecular chemistry was employed.77–81 By using the smallest unit of CPs, metal–organic cubes (MOCs) or metal–organic polyhedrons (MOPs), molecules could bridge the MOCs or MOPs, forming supramolecules.77,78 For example, the anionic [Ga8(ImDC)12]12− (MOC) was connected with molecular binders to form hydrogels (Fig. 14).77 After formation of the gel, the negative ion acquisition mode high-resolution mass spectra confirmed that the MOCs were stable because the characteristic peaks of their moieties were retained. These MOCs were intact according to powder PXRD. The hydrogelation was caused by the interaction of NH4+ with the MOCs when NH4+ was used as the binder. Electron microscopy of the obtained xerogels illustrated that different binders resulted in different shapes of the assembly.77 An MOP, [Rh2(bdc-C12)2]12, could react with linear molecular linkers with two imidazole functionalities at both ends, forming a cross-linked suprapolymer (Fig. 15).78 The polymerization process was monitored via electronic absorption spectroscopy and DLS experiments. The formed particles were composed of intact MOPs according to the amorphous diffraction profiles and infrared spectroscopy. By controlling the kinetics of the polymerization process, an excess amount of linkers led to fast polymerization. As a result, supramolecular colloidal gels were formed. Nanosized MOFs can be interconnected with molecular ligands as well. By immersing Cu2+ ions with Net3 and other ligands such as trimesic acid in a solvent, the metal ions could connect with all the ligands initially, forming amorphous networks. Subsequently, the trimesic acid moved to reorganize with Cu2+ ions locally. As a result, nano-sized HKUST-1 was formed inside the networks without breaking the bonding with molecules according to electron microscopy and PXRD.79 Layer-by-layer assembly can lead to flexible CPs as well. By using molecular-thick Mg–Al-layered double hydroxide nanosheets as the substrate, CPs were deposited on the nanosheets via a layer-by-layer process. The growth of the thin film was monitored via UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, powder XRD and SEM. The hybridized thin films were fluorescent and flexible, as shown in Fig. 16.81

Since supramolecular interaction is relatively weaker than covalent bonding, sometimes polymerization based on covalent bonding is necessary if the flexible body has to be loaded with repeated stress. One strategy is to polymerize ligands first into polymers via covalent reaction of their side groups. Subsequently, the carboxylic side groups in the obtained polymers coordinated with Zn2+ ions, leading to CPs bonding the preformed polymers.82 By extending this concept, nanosized UiO-66-NH2 was post-modified with methacrylicanhydride, forming double bonds on the ligands. Then, the modified CPs reacted with butyl methacrylate through co-polymerization, forming a flexible body (Fig. 17).83

2.2 Downsizing of CPs and their assemblies
CPs can become flexible by downsizing their size in one or two dimensions below a few tens of nanometers. The obtained two-dimension or one-dimension structured CPs have a limited number of repeating units along the reduced directions. Therefore, the steric hindrance can be reduced, permitting the deformation of the CPs. Exfoliation is a powerful method to fabricate ultrathin nanosheets. With the help of mild mechanical exfoliation in the presence of propanol, Zn2(bim)4 nanosheets were fabricated.84 These monolayer nanosheets could deform smoothly to cover the pores of anodic Al2O3. Another way to fabricate CPs with a low-dimension nanostructure is spatially confined growth, which is usually realized using templates.85–88 For instance, CPs with 2D networks can grow on planar or particulate templates. When Fe3+ ions were mixed with tannic acid, two-dimensional Fe–TA networks were formed.85 These Fe–TA networks were grown on a planar polystyrene substrate, generating flat thin films with a thickness of less than 5 nm (Fig. 18A). When the Fe–TA networks were deposited on polystyrene particles, the obtained thin film became capsules, which could swell with liquid and shrink after drying (Fig. 18B–K).85 When coordination between the metal ions and ligands occurred at the liquid interface, CPs thin films were obtained as well. Depending on the shape of the interface, the Prussian blue thin films were either shell-shaped or ribbons.87,88

The low-dimension structures of the CPs make the inter-particle forces become non-neglectable. vdW forces become strong enough to manipulate the assembly of nanostructured CPs. For example, 2D nanosheets of Ni(H2O)2[Ni(CN)4]·4H2O could stack on each other to form a lamellar-structured film.89 The nanosheets were bonded with each other tightly through vdW forces. Mild mechanical deformation such as folding could not break the film.90 1D nanowires can be woven with each other like polymers. vdW forces and intergrowth can crosslink the nanowires to form pure CP assemblies with significant flexibility. Metal oxide flexible mats are generally fabricated through electron spinning and calcination. The metal ions are released from the metal oxides under hydrothermal conditions and reacted with a variety of ligands to form CPs nanowires such as MIL-53(Al), HKUST-1, ZIF-8, UiO-66 and MIL-88B. The nanowires assembled together like metal oxides according to electron microscopy, forming mats, which are highly flexible (Fig. 19).91

3. Applications
After introducing mechanical flexibility, CPs have been utilized in various applications. One of the most investigated applications of CPs is molecular sieving due to their ordered porous structure. However, in most cases, the CPs are supported on porous inorganic scaffolds, which are brittle and hard to be processed/fabricated. Thus, to make CPs membranes more durable and easier to fabricate, it is necessary to deposit CPs on porous polymer scaffolds. Using the method described in the previous section, CP membranes were successfully coated on a porous polymer scaffold in the presence of a buffer layer. The obtained coherent CP membranes adhered on the substrates tightly, which exhibited flexibility under bending and tensile tests.92,93Fig. 20A illustrates a ZIF-8 membrane coated on hollow-fiber PVDF (PVDF = polyvinylidene fluoride) with embedded TiO2.92 The H2 permeation and H2/CO2 selectivity of this membrane were tested. Surprisingly, the selectivity and permeability of the membrane were well maintained under both bending and stretching (Fig. 20B). The stress-elongation results and SEM images demonstrated that the ZIF-8 membrane could be elongated without loss in its continuous structure (Fig. 20C).

Applications such as molecular sieving, catalysis, gas storage, flexible/wearable micro-electronics and devices urgently require flexible CPs. Electrochromic CP films can switch their absorbance or reflectance through electrochemical redox processes. Compared to metal oxides, the fabrication of CPs does not require high vacuum, which makes their synthetic procedure simpler. Through controlled solution-based deposition, electrochromic CP, which was formed by coordination between PdCl2(PhCN)2 and metal polypyridyl complexes, films were spin-coated on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates.94 The film was integrated into an electrochromic device. During bending of the whole device, reversible ON/OFF could be observed, as suggested by the color change, similar to the result obtained in the planar state (Fig. 21a and b). However, the changes in the absorbance, which corresponded to the oxidation and reduction states of the CPs were different in the planar and bent configurations, demonstrating that mechanical deformation did not alter the function of the device, but affected its performance.

Switchable CPs, which have switchable ON/OFF states under varied stimuli, are promising optoelectronic materials. By integrating molecular CPs into flexible films, foldable switches become possible. For instance, imidazolium-FCrO3 was deposited on flexible ITO/PET substrates via spin-coating. The obtained film was flexible, as demonstrated in Fig. 22a. This film showed a stepwise behavior in the temperature dependence of dielectric constants, which was different from the sharp peak observed in crystals (Fig. 22b). The difference in the film should be mainly attributed to the internal stress at the interface.95 Thermal/electric/optical stimuli could trigger reversible changes in the dielectric or photoluminescence properties of [C5H13NBr][Cd3Br7] CPs.96 The film made by depositing [C5H13NBr][Cd3Br7] on PET could be folded more than 10000 times at 90° without losing its fast response towards stimulus.

CPs have been used for sensing because they can respond to electrons, photons and guest ion–molecule interactions through redox/binding of their metal nodes or energy transfer through ligands. By recording the alternation of the properties of CPs, such as color change, photoluminescence, and resistance, sensing towards specific targets can be achieved. Integrating CPs with flexible substrates makes the fabrication of next-generation flexible CP sensors possible. Using the strategies summarized in the above sections, various CP flexible sensors have been fabricated.97–100 For instance, non-invasive monitoring of glucose is important in diagnosis. Although Prussian blue, as one type of CP, can accurately detect the concentration of glucose, the difficulty in integrating it in a flexible device that can bind tightly on human skin is a great challenge. By sandwiching Prussian blue with various flexible components, a skin-like biosensor was fabricated available (Fig. 23A and B).97 Basically, the sensor was composed of five layers including a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer (80 nm in thickness), polyimide (PI) (1.6 mm in thickness) film, gold thin film (100 nm in thickness), a Prussian blue layer (51.8 nm), and a graphene oxide layer (close to 1 mm in thickness). This device could be attached on the skin tightly, and could wrinkle with the skin together (Fig. 23D). The reason for this flexibility was the precise design of the microstructure of the substrates. For example, directly depositing Prussian blue on a smooth gold film led to an easily cracked film. In contrast, a nanostructured gold film with more defects on the surface could be coated by Prussian blue tightly. This flexibility gave highly accurate results during an in vivo test, which can compete with the current invasive measurements.97

Information storage is a promising application of CPs. The most investigated CPs are spin-crossover (SCO) CPs, which have high-spin and low-spin states, and therefore can mimic 0 or 1 for information storage. Although they have not been commercialized to date, SCO CP-based flexible films need to be explored for future flexible memory devices. Since the high/low spin transition of SCO CPs can be controlled by photons, it is important to deposit SCO CPs on transparent flexible substrates. The [FeII(L)2](BF4)2 (L = 4,4′′-dioctylated 2,6-bispyrazolylpyrine) complex is soluble in common solutions.101 Therefore, this CP can be dissolved first and patterned by lithographic patterning with the help of PDMS. Polystyrene films have been used as a flexible substrate for [FeII(L)2](BF4)2. This film structure was confirmed by SEM thoroughly.101
Besides switching of the spin states, resistance switching of CPs can be used in other information storage techniques such as memristors and resistance random access memories.102,103 For example, a memristor was realized by depositing HKUST-1 on a gold-coated polyethylene terephthalate substrate through liquid-phase epitaxy.102 The structure of the device could be retained under a strain of 2.8%. Furthermore, the resistance change behavior was stable during more than 300 cycles under bending (Fig. 24a). Both the high and low resistances remained almost constant during the test (Fig. 24b). In addition, the device could endure reversible bending several times. During more than 160 cycles of bending, the resistance and the working voltage of the device were constant (Fig. 24c and d). These results implied that flexible CPs can be potentially used in flexible memristors.

With the development of wearable devices, the batteries used inside these devices should be flexible, and therefore, wearable energy storage and conversion devices become highly necessary. CPs have a large surface area and can transfer electrons, and therefore can be processed into flexible components for batteries and solar cells. For instance, the large surface area of CPs encourages scientists to utilize this type of material in electrochemical capacitors and lithium–sulfur batteries.104–106 The surfaces of the CPs can adsorb charges, and their pores can store sulfur. By integrating CPs with flexible conductors such as carbon nanotubes, flexible energy storage systems become possible. A typical process is to fabricate a scaffold by mixing metal hydroxide nanostrands and carbon nanotubes.106 By dipping this scaffold into a solution of trimesic acid, the metal hydroxide was replicated by HKUST-1 through coordination replication. The obtained composite was used as a flexible electrode for Li–S batteries followed by loading S8 into the film.

The significance of CPs has also been demonstrated in flexible solar cells.107,108 In a solar cell, a layer for electron transfer is necessary. However, in most cases, the electron transfer layers are composed of metal oxides, which require high temperature treatment. This high temperature treatment hinders the deposition of these materials on flexible substrates, such as polymers. CPs, which can transfer electrons to electron conductive electrodes, can be deposited on flexible polymers via several liquid-based procedures at room temperature. For instance, MIL-125 has been used to replace titanium oxides in solar cell. A nanocrystalline film of MIL-125 was successfully used in a flexible perovskite solar cell. A power conversion efficiency was maintained at 17.43% after bending 700 times (Fig. 26).108

4. Conclusions
Although still in their infancy, flexible CPs films have been demonstrated to be experimentally available through various approaches. Among them, integrating CPs with flexible scaffolds is the most common. This methodology is not only applicable to most CP systems, but also can facilitate the fabrication of devices in the next stage. Different from other inorganic materials, processing of flexible CP films is mainly performed in the liquid phase, matching with the fabrication of most polymeric soft substrates. In addition, due to the organic parts of CPs, the interaction between CPs and polymeric substrates can be easily adjusted through supramolecular chemistry, which can help to enhance the mechanical stability of the devices under mechanical deformation. An important feature in all these flexible CPs or composites is that the structure of the CPs is well maintained before and after mechanical deformation of the films/devices. Therefore, all the intrinsic properties of CPs, such as high porosity, high crystallinity, large surface areas, and electron conductivity, can be retained, permitting their utilization as expected. Therefore, flexible CPs have great potential as essential components for next-stage flexible devices.
For the synthesis of flexible CP films, the large-scale integration of CPs with flexible substrates should be developed for the rapid development of CP-based devices. Due to the compositional and molecular features of CPs, supramolecular chemistry should be considered as a very important methodology. In addition, colloidal routes such as casting and layer-by-layer deposition are important pathways.
Regarding devices containing CPs, applications that require host–guest interactions or tunable electronic properties of materials may be more appropriate because many CPs contain ordered nanospaces, which are suitable for hosting guest ions or molecules. The significant process in tuning electron conductivity of CPs may help in the development of functional devices.
To date, systematic investigation of the mechanical properties of flexible CPs is still rare. Thus, efforts into this area, on one hand, may bring new phenomena in non-linear mechanics, and on the other hand, can result in many skin-like devices, which can be very useful in future applications.
