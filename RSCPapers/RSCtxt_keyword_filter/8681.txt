    , Accepted 21st February 2023First published on 21st February 2023AbstractMixed halogen wide-bandgap perovskite materials are often applied to the top cells of tandem solar cells. Nevertheless, serious halogen vacancy defects in mixed halogen perovskite materials remain one of the main factors restricting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fluoride has been proposed to inhibit halogen vacancy defects, but fluoride-induced crystallization behaviour is not thoroughly understood in wide-bandgap mixed halide perovskite systems. Here, we introduce tetrafluoroborate ion (BF4−) into the wide-bandgap perovskite precursor solution to regulate the crystallization dynamics. Due to high electronegativity and strong electron affinity, a strong interaction between BF4− and the [PbX6]4− octahedron increases the formation energy of perovskite crystal, inhibiting perovskite nucleation. The reduced nucleation site slows down the crystallization rate of the perovskite film. Moreover, we demonstrate that BF4− enters the perovskite lattice and fills the halogen vacancy defect. The reduced trap density and optimized energy level structure guarantee high device performance. As a result, the wide-bandgap PSC with BF4− achieves an excellent PCE of 20.09%. Benefitting from the eliminated halogen vacancies, the device achieves improved operating stability, and it maintains more than 80% of its initial PCE under continuous 1-sun illumination for 1000 h.
Introduction
Wide-bandgap organic–inorganic mixed halogen perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often used as the top cells of tandem solar cells.1–3 The desired optical bandgap (1.6–1.75 eV) can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of bromine ion (Br−) to iodine ion (I−).4,5 Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of wide-bandgap PSCs are far less than those of silicon solar cells at the bottom, making it difficult to meet the commercial needs of tandem solar cells.6–8 The defect state in wide-bandgap perovskite films is one of the most important factors restricting their performance.9–11 Wide-bandgap mixed halogen polycrystalline perovskite films are usually prepared by solution method, and their crystallization behaviour is more elusive than that of single halogen perovskite films.12 It has been widely recognized that mixed halogen perovskite films possess lower defect formation energy than single halogen perovskite films.13 Halogen vacancy defects are one of the main defect states, especially at grain boundaries (GBs) and surfaces of perovskite film.14 They act as the recombination centre of carriers, damaging device performance. Moreover, halogen vacancy defects induce halogen ion migration, which leads to serious phase separation of perovskite films, reducing the stability of the solar cell.15,16 Therefore, it is very necessary to inhibit the formation of halogen vacancies for achieving efficient and stable wide-bandgap mixed halogen PSCs.
It is an excellent strategy to address this issue by introducing some additives to fill the halogen vacancies of films, such as Lewis adducts, amino acids, pseudo halogens, etc.17–20 Recently, fluorinated halogen anions were also used as additives to suppress halogen vacancies in narrow-bandgap PSCs.21,22 Fluorinated halogen anions possess better electron affinity than common halides due to their high electronegativity.23 The resulting stronger force between fluorinated halogen anions and lead ions would increase ion migration activation energy, forming a more stable [PbX6]4− octahedral structure. Some researchers have introduced fluorinated halogen ions into a wide-bandgap perovskite system to address the phase separation issues, improving the performance and the stability of PSCs. Chen et al. introduced 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ABF) into the mixed-halide perovskite precursor, suppressing the initial vertical halide phase separation during perovskite crystallization.24 Liu et al. employed p-FPEAI (para-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide) to passivate the anti-site defects and inhibit the non-radiation recombination.25 Nevertheless, the crystallization kinetics of fluorinated halogen ions in wide-bandgap perovskite films are still elusive, and the relevant physical mechanism needs to be further explored.
In this work, we introduced tetrafluoroborate ion (BF4−) into a wide-bandgap mixed halide perovskite precursor solution to study the crystallization behaviour. The crystallization process of perovskite films was monitored by laser confocal microfluorescence technique. Due to the stronger interaction between BF4− and lead iodide (PbI2), there is increased formation energy of perovskite crystal perovskite nucleation. The smaller number of crystal nuclei slows the crystallization rate of perovskite, resulting in increased grain size and improved film quality. We have demonstrated that BF4− entered the perovskite lattice and filled the halogen vacancy. BF4−-assisted perovskite film not only reduced the defect density, but also changed the energy level. These facilitate carrier transport and inhibit non-radiative recombination, guaranteeing improved device performance. As a result, the PSC with BF4− achieved an excellent PCE of 20.09%, accompanied by a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.18 V and a high filling factor (FF) of 83.33%. Benefiting from the hydrophobic fluoride and the eliminated halogen vacancies, the resulting wide-bandgap PSC achieved improved operating stability. The device with BF4− still maintained more than 80% of its initial PCE under continuous 1-sun illumination for 1000 h, and it maintained 90% of its initial PCE after storage at 45–50% relative humidity (RH) for 1000 h.
Experimental
Materials
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, PbI2, PbBr2, and FAI were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co. Ltd PTAA, CsI, and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Formamidine tetrafluoroborate (FABF4) and cesium tetrafluoroborate (CsBF4) were purchased from TCI Chemicals. Bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Chlorobenzene (CB), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The 1.5 M FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 precursor solution (control solution) was prepared by dissolving PbI2, PbBr2, FAI, and CsI in the mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1) at the stoichiometric ratio. For the solution with BF4−, the mixed additives of FABF4 and CsBF4 at 4:1 were added into control solutions. We added BF4− mixed additive with different molar ratios (0.5 mol%, 1 mol%, 1.5 mol%, 2 mol%) into the perovskite precursor solution.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass was cleaned according to the previous method.26 PTAA films were fabricated by spin-coating a PTAA solution (2 mg mL−1 in CB) onto the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 35 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 35 s, respectively. Next, 100 μL of CB was quickly dripped at 25 s, and the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. Thereafter, PCBM solution (20 mg mL−1 in CB) was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 35 s. Then, BCP solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, Ag electrode was deposited under a vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The devices were measured by a customized mask with an effective area of 0.085 cm2.
Characterizations and measurements
Microscopic imaging and photoluminescence (PL) mapping of perovskite films were performed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (ISS fastFLIM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 ADVANCE). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two infrared spectrometer. The surface potential of the films was evaluated via Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured based on an FLS920 (Edinburgh Instruments) fluorescence spectrometer. The valence bond was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB 250Xi). The ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) was measured under the light energy of 21.22 eV and bias voltage of −5 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were completed using a CHI 660E (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) electrochemical station. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5G solar illumination using a Newport Oriel solar simulator (model SAN-EI, ELS 155(XE)). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by the CrownTech quantum efficiency measurement system (QTesT1000ADX) in air.
Results and discussion
To inhibit the halogen vacancies, we proposed to partially replace the halide ion (I− and Br−) with BF4− in wide-bandgap perovskite crystals (Fig. 1a).21 We thus introduced the mixed additives, FABF4 and CsBF4, into the perovskite precursor solution (FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3). To reveal the important role of BF4−, we excluded the effect of newly introduced cations by controlling the FA/Cs proportions, consistent with control solution. Due to high electronegativity and stronger electron affinity, BF4− could interact strongly with the [PbX6]4− octahedron and prevent anions from escaping the perovskite crystal structure. As expected, the perovskite film with BF4− showed that XPS characteristic peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 shifted towards higher binding energy (143.46 eV and 138.62 eV)27 compared with the control film (143.35 eV and 138.49 eV) (Fig. 1b). Moreover, FTIR spectra further confirmed our speculation. As displayed in Fig. 1c, the film with BF4− showed that a stretching vibration peak of B–F bond shifted to 1061 cm−1, compared with pure BF4− samples (1012 cm−1).28 This is because the chemical environment of BF4− was changed after BF4− entered the [PbX6]4+ structure.

(e) Laser confocal microscope images of in situ crystallization kinetics for perovskite precursor solution with and without BF4−. 
We then explored the effect of the interaction force on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. In situ crystallization laser confocal microscopic images were carried out under 70 °C and a 405 nm laser source. On the basis of the traditional optical microscope, a conjugate focusing device shows the in situ crystallization behavior of wide-bandgap perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1e, many small crystal nuclei have formed in the control sample at 5 s. Subsequently, the resulting crystal nucleus induced the rapid transformation from the solution phase to the solid phase (Fig. S1†). By contrast, the strong interaction force between BF4− and [PbX6]4− octahedron increases the formation energy of the perovskite phase, inhibiting the formation of perovskite crystal nuclei (Fig. 1d). Having fewer nucleation sites slows the crystallization rate in perovskite film with BF4−, which would result in larger perovskite grain sizes than the control film. The field emission SEM images showed the average grain size of perovskite films increased from ∼500 nm to ∼800 nm (Fig. S2†), which is also confirmed by the XRD patterns of perovskite films (Fig. 2a). We extracted full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (001) plane according to the XRD patterns. As shown in Table S1,† perovskite film with BF4− exhibited smaller FWHM values (0.127) than control film (0.133). This implies larger grain sizes and fewer GBs of perovskite crystals, which is conducive to reducing the defect states in perovskite films.

The BF4− in perovskite precursor solution not only changes the crystal kinetics but also induces the lattice change of perovskite crystals. As shown in Fig. 2a, XRD patterns exhibited two main peaks at 14.31° and 28.75° in the control film, corresponding to the (001) and (002) reflections of perovskite crystal (Fig. S3†). The two main diffraction peaks of perovskite film with BF4− is shifted to 14.27° and 28.68° respectively, which confirmed that BF4− has successfully replaced the halogen ion (I− and Br−). The introduced BF4− (218 pm) possesses a similar ionic radius as I− (220 pm), and it is bigger than Br− (196 pm). The atomic orbital hybridization of BF4− and Pb2+ is weaker than that of I− and Pb2+, and thus the chemical bond between BF4− and Pb2+ should be weakened. Moreover, the effective ion radius of BF4− increases, which results in the increased bond length of Pb–X and expanded unit cell.21 Optimized crystal structure usually adjusts the band structure of the material. As shown, UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite film with BF4− displayed an obvious redshift (Fig. S4†), corresponding to a decrease in the optical bandgap from 1.699 eV to1.685 eV, which is consistent with the XRD results.
We then further analysed the energy level structure of the perovskite films by measuring UPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Fermi levels (Ef) of perovskite film increase from −4.37 eV to −4.34 eV, and the work function (Wf) decreases from 4.37 eV to 4.34 eV, after introducing BF4−. This indicates that the resulting film possesses more N-type properties.29 This helps to increase the built-in potential in the photovoltaic device, resulting in a high Voc. We then calculated the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite film (Fig. 2c). The increased CBM value of perovskite films with BF4− is more favourable for photo-induced electron transport from the perovskite layer to the PCBM electron transport layer.30,31 We further analyzed the electrical properties of perovskite films under the synergistic effect of KPFM and AFM.32,33 As shown in the Fig. 2d–i, the perovskite films containing BF4− showed a relatively uniform local contact potential difference (VCPD). The VCPD difference (ΔVCPD) between GBs and the grain interior (Fig. 2i) is about 13 mV, and a relatively high potential was shown at GBs (represented by the green circle). Moreover, a flatter surface potential facilitates uniform charge extraction and inhibits carrier recombination at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layer.34 For the control film, the VCPD difference between GBs and grain interior (Fig. 2f) is about 27 mV, and a relatively low potential was shown at GBs (represented by the blue circle). This implies that the charge carriers are likely trapped at the GBs, increasing the leakage current of the device.35 Notably, the overall improved VCPD of the BF4−-containing perovskite film resulted in a lower surface potential (SP) (30.4 mV) compared with the control film (58.3 mV), indicating a more N-type nature. Such level structure could contribute to carrier extraction and transport in the p–i–n devices.36 This is consistent with the UPS results (Fig. 2b), indicating that introducing BF4− causes the Fermi level of the perovskite film to shift upward (Fig. 2c).
To evaluate the effect of BF4− filling the halogen vacancies, we measured the trap density (nt) of resulting perovskite films by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, using an electron-only and hole-only device (Fig. 3a and S5†). A rapid nonlinear trap-filled limit (TFL) rise was observed, which indicates all the available defect states were filled by the injected carriers. The onset voltage, VTFL, was linearly proportional to the density of defect states,  where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, εr is the relative dielectric constant, e is elementary charge, and L is the perovskite layer thickness. As expected, the electron-only device showed that the defect density (4.44 × 1015 cm−3) of perovskite film with BF4− was one order of magnitude lower than that of control films (1.55× 1016 cm−3), and the hole-only device also exhibited the same result. Considering the ion migration issues of perovskite films, we then measured the defect density through thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS). It could characterize shallow and deep defects of wide-bandgap perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S6,† the film with BF4− exhibited a lower defect density of states (tDOS) over the whole trap depth than the control one. This is consistent with the SCLC results.37–40 We then extracted the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) from the child region with the Mott–Gurney equation of

(d) Steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films without and with BF4−. (e and f) Laser confocal fluorescence lifetime mappings (right) and their Gaussian fitting distribution (left) of perovskite films (e) without and (f) with BF4−. 
It could be observed that the μh/μe of perovskite film decreased from 1.50 to 1.16 after introducing BF4− (Fig. S7† and Table S2†). This indicated that more balanced electron and hole transfer was achieved, which was beneficial for the high FF of PSCs.
Less defect density and more balanced charge transfer are conducive to suppressing carrier recombination and extending carrier lifetime. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the confocal fluorescence microscopy (TCFM) images display the fluorescence intensity profile of perovskite films. According to the Gaussian fitting of fluorescence intensity, perovskite film with BF4− exhibited stronger and more uniform fluorescence than the control sample, which implies reduced nonradiative recombination induced by defect states. Steady-state PL spectra also showed stronger PL peaks in perovskite film with BF4−, further confirming this conclusion (Fig. 3d). It is worth noting that the PL peak position is red-shifted from 730 nm to 736 nm. This further confirmed the XRD and absorption results. As halogen vacancies are filled with BF4−, the perovskite lattice expands, reducing the optical bandgap of the material. As shown in Fig. 3e and f, perovskite films with BF4− possessed a longer and more uniform fluorescence lifetime than the control sample, which further indicated that the former achieved reduced defects. Moreover, we analyzed the TRPL spectra of resulting perovskite films (Fig. S8† and Table S4†). PL lifetime could be fitted by a double exponential decay equation:  
In general, τ1 is dominated by trap-assisted recombination, and τ2 is dominated by bimolecular recombination. For perovskite film with BF4−, fewer τ1 components and longer τ2 lifetimes demonstrated reduced non-radiative recombination and enhanced carrier lifetimes.
Improvements in the optical and electrical properties of perovskite guaranteed high-performance solar cells. We then prepared wide-bandgap PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. S9†). J–V curves of the resulting devices are shown in Fig. 4a. The control device displayed a PCE of 17.31%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.42 mA cm−2 and Voc of 1.11 V. As expected, the device with optimal BF4− concentration (1 mol%) achieved an excellent PCE of 20.09% (Fig. S15†), accompanied by a high Voc (1.18 V) and FF (83.33%). This is attributed to the reduced halogen vacancy, which inhibits non-radiative recombination and promotes balanced carrier transport. The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE spectra (Fig. 4b) is consistent with the result of J–V curves. The device with BF4− exhibited negligible hysteresis and reproducibility (Fig. S10† and Table S3†). Moreover, the resulting device maintains a stable power output under continuous illumination with a maximum power point (MPP) (Fig. S11†).
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves, (b) EQE spectra of PSCs, (c) dark J–V curves, (d) Vocversus light intensity, (e) EIS spectra, and (f) C–V curves of PSCs with and without BF4−. 
We then examined the relationship between defect elimination and device performance improvement at the device level. The J–V characteristics of PSCs usually follow the diode equation by a formula:41  where n is the ideal factor, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, q is elementary charge, Jph is photocurrent density, and J0 is reverse saturation current density under dark conditions. We therefore measured the dark J–V curves of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4c, the device with BF4− exhibited lower J0 than the control device, indicating suppressed trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, we obtained n by fitting the slope of Voc with light intensity, corresponding to the degree of charge recombination (Fig. 4d). The device with BF4− showed a lower n value, which is consistent with the dark J–V curve. We then evaluated carrier transport and recombination by EIS spectra (Fig. 4e and Table S5†). The transmission resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec) were obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit. The device with BF4− showed a smaller Rtr value (928.31 Ω) in the high-frequency region than the control device (958.82 Ω), while the Rrec of the device with BF4− (8560.11 Ω) in the low-frequency region was much larger than that of the control (5558.09 Ω). This indicated that the transmission resistance was reduced and the recombination resistance was increased after introducing BF4−, which is conducive to the separation and collection of carriers.42 To further explore the physical mechanism of Voc increase, we carried out capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4f, the built-in potential (Vbi) of the device could be obtained by the Mott–Schottky curve. The device with BF4− displayed a Vbi of 0.95 V, which was larger than the control device (0.80 V). The higher Vbi value is beneficial to the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, reducing Voc loss of PSCs.43
Light stability is an important reference for the application of mixed halogen wide-bandgap PSCs. We thus evaluated the perovskite films' light stability by measuring the PL spectra under continuous 1-sun illumination. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, PL peaks of the control film displayed a distinct redshift from 730 nm to 738 nm after continuous illumination for 60 min. It is easy to understand that photo-induced phase separation results in iodine-rich perovskite components in the film. In contrast, the perovskite film with BF4− exhibited a consistent PL peak position. This could be further confirmed by the in situ XRD pattern evolution as a function of illumination time (Fig. S12†). For the perovskite films containing BF4−, the diffraction peak at 14.27° is almost unchanged after continuous illumination. The PL intensity decreased and the FWHM increased in the control film. Meanwhile, the diffraction peak at 14.31° shifted to a smaller angle, and the iodine-rich phase appeared. The initial halogen vacancy at the GBs provides a channel for subsequent ion migration and phase separation. After BF4− was introduced, the halogen vacancy was filled, which inhibited the decomposition of perovskite films. Subsequently, we extracted the peak intensity and FWHM of PL spectra (Fig. 5c). For the control film, decreased PL intensity and increased FWHM suggested that halogen vacancies provide ion migration channels and accelerate perovskite decomposition. As expected, almost constant PL intensity and FWHM were found in perovskite film with BF4−. This demonstrated that BF4−, by filling the halogen vacancy, eliminated the ion migration channel and ensured photostability. In addition, the humidity resistance of perovskite film with BF4− is also particularly obvious, due to the strong hydrophobicity of fluoride. The film with BF4− showed a larger contact angle than the control sample (Fig. S13†). The resulting perovskite films were stored in an atmospheric environment with 45–50% RH for 30 days, and their XRD patterns showed negligible change (Fig. S14†). In stark contrast, an obvious PbI2 signal was found in the control film after only 3 days.

(d) PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under N2 environment with 30–40% RH and 25 °C. (e) PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under continuous 1-sun illumination in nitrogen. 
We tracked the PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under N2 environment with 30–40% RH and 25 °C. As displayed in Fig. 5d, the device with BF4− maintained more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1000 h, while the PCE of the control device quickly dropped to 58% of its initial value.44 We then tracked the PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under an atmospheric environment with the same humidity (Fig. S16b†). The PCE of the control device quickly dropped to 56% of its initial value after 1000 h, while the device with BF4− remained at about 88% of its initial PCE at the same time. We then tracked the PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under continuous 1-sun illumination in nitrogen. As displayed in Fig. 5e, the device with BF4− maintained more than 80% of its initial PCE after 1000 h, while the control device has decreased to lower than 50% of its initial PCE. We also tracked the PCE evolution of encapsulated devices stored in 85% RH and at 85 °C in the dark. As displayed in Fig. S16a,† the device with BF4− still maintained more than 83% of its initial PCE after 1000 h, while the control device decreased to lower than 38% of its initial PCE. Benefiting from the hydrophobic fluoride and the eliminated halogen vacancies, the resulting wide-bandgap PSC achieved significantly improved operating stability.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an efficient and stable wide-bandgap perovskite photovoltaic via fluoride-assisted crystallization regulation. We introduced BF4− into the wide-bandgap perovskite system to regulate the crystallization dynamics. Due to the high electronegativity and stronger electron affinity of fluoride, the strong interaction between BF4− and the [PbX6]4− octahedron increases perovskite formation energy and inhibits the formation of crystal nuclei. The reduced nucleation site slows down the crystallization rate of perovskite film. Moreover, many characterizations have demonstrated that BF4− enters the perovskite lattice and fills the halogen vacancy. The reduced defect density and optimized energy level structure guarantee high device performance. As a result, the wide-bandgap PSC with BF4− achieves an excellent PCE of 20.09%, with high Voc of 1.18 V and FF of 83.33%. Benefiting from the eliminated halogen vacancies, the device obtains significantly improved operating stability, maintaining more than 80% of its initial PCE under continuous 1-sun illumination for 1000 h. Our work provides a reference for promoting the application of wide-bandgap perovskite materials in tandem solar cells.
