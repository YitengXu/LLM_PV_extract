    , Accepted 12th February 2018First published on 12th February 2018AbstractThickness-tunable and compact FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite thin films are achieved with a large grain size up to 12 microns. They are then employed to fabricate functional solar cells with a simplified planar structure without the use of electron-transport (ETL) layers. These results are highly encouraging for the future large-scale fabrication of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3-based solar cells.
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have been considered as one of the most promising contenders for emerging solution-processed photovoltaics (PVs).1 These materials are of ABX3 perovskite-type structure where the A site cation is typically an organic molecule such as methylammonium or formamidinium, the B site cation is a metal such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, and the X site anion is a halide (such as I−, Br− or Cl−). They have been applied in a variety of solid-state structures, including mesoporous2 or planar3 p-i-n cells, using various chemical and physical deposition techniques.4–10 A micron-scale carrier diffusion length has been identified in methylammonium lead iodide perovskites and free charges are believed to form within a few picoseconds upon photoabsorption.11,12 The global research effort on this topic has led to a substantial increase of power-conversion efficiency (PCE) for single junction perovskite solar cells, from 3.8% in 200913 to the current record of 22.1% in 2016.14,15 Such a rapid increase of PCE suggests a huge potential for hybrid halide perovskites to enter the PV market.
One promising strategy for perovskite solar cells to enter the PV market is to apply them on a mature technology such as a silicon (Si) “bottom cell” to create a “tandem junction”.16 Such a strategy ideally requires a halide perovskite “top cell” component with a band gap of ∼1.75 eV to current-match the crystalline Si bottom cell with a band gap of 1.1 eV.17 Toward this objective, a series of mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskites based on FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I(1−x)Brx)3 (FA = formamidinium [HC(NH2)2]) were synthesized with a tunable band gap by controlling the value of x.16,18 The partial substitution of Cs+ in the A site cation promotes photo- and moisture stability19,20 and the partial substitution of I− by Br− enables a monotonic tunability of the band gap. In particular, when x = 0.4, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 exhibits an optimal optical band gap of ∼1.74 eV favorable for the above-mentioned tandem strategy together with highly competitive PCEs ranging from 14.7 to 17%.16,18 These PCEs were achieved by a planar device structure with the perovskite absorber sandwiched between an n-type electron transport double layer (SnO2 together with phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM)) and a p-type hole-transport polymer layer (HTL; 2′-7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, Spiro-OMeTAD). While these results are highly interesting, it remains unclear whether such an electron transport (or hole-blocking) double layer is necessary for FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I(1−x)Brx)3-based solar cells. A more simplified device structure should be in principle desirable towards low-cost fabrication. While the blocking layer-free device structure can enable high-performance solar cells based on methylammonium lead iodide,21–25 this approach has not been explored yet on FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I(1−x)Brx)3, to the best of our knowledge. Compared to standard solar cell structures, the simplified electron transport layer-free (ETL-free) structures offer opportunities such as reduced surface recombination (between the electrode and the ETL),25 the possibility to decouple the study of the perovskite growth mechanism and that of the ETL,23 and low-temperature fabrication adaptable to flexible polymer substrates.26 In particular, the perovskite morphology was found to be of particular importance for ETL-free structures because any direct contact between the FTO and the HTL can lead to detrimental reduction of photovoltaic performance.21
In this work, we report on the realization of ETL-free efficient planar solar cells based on mixed cation and mixed halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite grown directly onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. In particular, by controlling the precursor molar concentration, we optimized both the film thickness and morphology of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 which have important impacts on the final photovoltaic performance of the ETL-free solar cells. We applied solution-processed pinhole-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 on a simple planar FTO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/gold device structure. A comparison of devices built with and without a single planar n-type TiO2 ETL is carried out to investigate the necessity of such a layer. Optimized ETL-free planar solar cells based on FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 exhibited a PCE of 13.80% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V under the reverse voltage scan. Our results therefore demonstrate that the molar concentration of the perovskite precursor can be an effective tool to control both the thickness and the film morphology of mixed cation and mixed halide perovskites and to improve the photovoltaic performance of ETL-free planar solar cells based on them.
Highly crystalline and compact FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite films fully covering the substrate (oxygen plasma-treated FTO) were achieved via a simple spin-coating of the perovskite precursor and a post-spin-coating annealing procedure. No solvent dripping during spin-coating was necessary. The precursor solution contains a mixture of four chemicals, FAI, CsI, PbBr2 and PbI2 in a stoichiometric proportion according to the target perovskite composition of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. We first applied the molar concentration (0.95 M) optimized by McMeekin et al.16 Under these conditions, a perovskite film with a thickness of about 330 nm was obtained on FTO exhibiting complete surface coverage with grain sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers to about 2–3 microns large (Fig. 1a). Such a perovskite absorber layer may be too thin for a fully optimized solar cell.22 We therefore experimented a series of precursor solutions of higher molar concentration. Together with the increase of film thickness, grain coarsening was observed when the precursor concentration increases (Fig. 1f). Using the intercept procedure27 we analyzed the average grain size of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 films obtained from different precursor concentrations (Fig. 1f). Films made from the 1.25 M precursor exhibited particularly large grains of lateral dimension up to 12 microns (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†). When further concentrated precursor solutions (1.40 M and 1.55 M) were applied, the final perovskite films started to exhibit some sparse pinholes (Fig. 1d and e). The XRD patterns of the above-mentioned FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 films on FTO indicate that all films are well-crystalline into the cubic phase α-FAPbI3 structure28 (Fig. 2a). The XRD results are in good agreement with previous reports on this family of perovskites.16,18 In addition, the perovskite films of this work are highly textured in the (001) direction. It is worth noting that the crystallization of the current FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite is a much slower process than that of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites. For CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, crystallization is typically complete after spin-coating as indicated by the appearance of brownish-dark color of the film.29 By comparison, for FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite, right after spin-coating the film still retained the yellow color. The XRD spectrum of a film at this stage (before annealing) revealed only limited perovskite formation (Fig. S2, ESI†). Full crystallization with film color-change from yellow to dark occurred after a thermal annealing step at 185 °C for 90 minutes, during which further nucleation, growth and grain coarsening happened. The current observation of textured grain growth and larger grains on thicker films is similar to that observed in oxide thin films deposited via sol–gel routes.30,31 The (001) oriented perovskite should be a result of preferential grain growth (vertical mode perpendicular to the substrate) to minimize the substrate–film interfacial energy and surface free energy. The lateral growth mode (resulting in larger grains) is more important for thicker films due to the decrease of strain within the film.31 Precursor solutions of different concentrations resulted in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite films of similar absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) with an optical bandgap of ∼1.72 eV determined by a Tauc plot (Fig. 2b and c, Tauc plot in Fig. S3, ESI†), which is in reasonable agreement with previous reports.16,18

FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite films grown directly onto FTO were then applied to build ETL-free planar solar cells. The cross-sectional SEM image of a typical device is shown in Fig. 3a, where different layers composing the solar cell can be clearly distinguished. Coherent with the planar SEM observation (Fig. 1), large areas without grain boundary of a few microns large can be observed in the cross-sectional layer. No lateral grain boundaries perpendicular to the substrate were observed, suggesting that the vertical charge transport and collections mainly occur within a single grain. The measured current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under reversed voltage scans of ETL-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cells fabricated on the same day and deposited from different precursors are shown in Fig. 3b and summarized in Table 1. As the precursor concentration increases from 0.95 M to 1.25 M, accompanied by the increase of the average grain size and thickness, there is a monotonic increase of photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill-factor (FF) and therefore PCE. This observed improvement of photovoltaic performance can be a combined consequence of the increased absorber thickness towards its optimal value and of the reduced charge recombination due to a larger grain size. At further higher precursor concentrations starting from 1.40 M, however, despite the appearance of a large grain size we started to observe a deterioration of photovoltaic performance due to the reduction in both Voc and FF. The reduction of FF can be attributed to the increased thickness of the absorber layer: as it increases beyond the optimal value, photogenerated carriers cannot be collected efficiently, therefore leading to an increased recombination loss. In addition, pinholes started to appear on perovskite films deposited from a high concentration precursor solution (Fig. 1). Pinholes in these cases can lead to a direct contact between the HTL and the FTO substrate resulting in losses in both Voc and FF.

The optimal precursor concentration is therefore found to be 1.25 M, by which a compact perovskite layer of relatively large lateral grain dimension and an optimal thickness of ∼500 nm can be achieved. At this precursor concentration, the best performing ETL-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cell exhibited, under the reversed (and forward) voltage scan, a Jsc of 18.54 (18.54) mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.04 (1.04) V, an FF of 71.57 (69.39)% and a PCE of 13.80 (13.38)% (Fig. 4). The integrated current density under AM1.5G illumination from the EQE spectrum was 18.41 mA cm−2, which is in reasonable agreement with the measured Jsc. While the origin of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is still a subject of debate, it is typically more pronounced on devices with a planar and blocking-layer-free structure likely linked to the compromised charge extraction.22,32 The current observed ratio of PCE between forward and reversed voltage scans (∼0.97) is comparable to the reported optimized results obtained on ETL-free planar methylammonium lead halide solar cells.21 The ETL-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cells from this work are nevertheless highly encouraging due to factors such as (i) the simplified fabrication, (ii) the lack of high-temperature annealing step (e.g. ∼450 °C required for compact TiO2), and (iii) the elimination of device degradation paths inherent to the blocking layer applied (e.g. SnO2 and PC60BM). Unencapsulated ETL-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cells kept under room light and argon exhibited only a small PCE decrease of ∼5% from the original value over 552 hours (23 days) (Fig. 4c).

We further investigated whether the application of a 50 nm-thick compact TiO2 (cp-TiO2) ETL layer can improve the FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cell performance. We found that it is more difficult to form compact FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite with complete substrate coverage on cp-TiO2/FTO compared to bare FTO substrates (Fig. S4, ESI†). While it is difficult to completely eliminate all perovskite pinholes on cp-TiO2/FTO, by controlling the precursor concentration, on cp-TiO2 we obtained FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite films with a thickness of ∼500 nm and an average grain size of ∼2.5 microns (Fig. S4, ESI†). Time-resolved PL measurements of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 revealed a shorter mean carrier lifetime (∼36 ns versus 183 ns) on cp-TiO2/FTO compared to FTO, suggesting a slight improvement of charge extraction associated with the use of cp-TiO2 ETL (Fig. 4d). The photovoltaic performance of planar FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cells with cp-TiO2 ETL is comparable to that of ETL-free devices with only a slightly compromised Voc (1.00 V instead of 1.04 V, Fig. 4a). The appearance of perovskite pinholes on cp-TiO2 may lead to the observed compromised Voc. This suggests that the insertion of a high-temperature-annealed cp-TiO2 ETL layer in planar FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cells may not be advantageous unless the perovskite morphology issues on cp-TiO2 can be eliminated.
In summary, thickness-tunable compact FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite thin films with a large grain size up to 12 microns were achieved by controlling the concentration of the perovskite precursor. By applying grain size- and thickness-optimized compact FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite thin films grown directly onto FTO substrates, we fabricated functional solar cells with a simplified planar device structure without electron-transport layers. The best-performing planar ETL-free FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cell exhibited a PCE of 13.80% and prolonged stability. The FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite is a highly promising candidate due to the possibility of its immediate application on Si solar cells through a tandem strategy. The current results on morphology and thickness control together with a simplified device structure are highly encouraging towards its future large-scale fabrication.
