    , Accepted 10th November 2020First published on 12th November 2020AbstractAn (s)-(−)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyric acid molecule (AHBA) with trifunctional groups is proposed as an effective multisite passivator and crosslinker to improve optoelectronic performance and stability of perovskite films. Here, amino and hydroxyl from AHBA can anchor iodide of PbI64− octahedra, while the carboxyl moiety can coordinate with lead, all of which contribute to high-quality perovskite film with reduced trap state densities. The addition of AHBA also delays the crystallization of perovskites and involves more FA+ and Pb2+ in precursor solution to form full coverage, low defect density and highly crystalline perovskite films with increasing grain sizes. More importantly, the AHBA doping stabilizes the perovskite crystal structure via impeding the loss of surface Br− and ion migration. As a result, both efficiency and stability are significantly enhanced in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The champion device shows an efficiency of 20.31% and retains over 94% of the initial efficiency after 60 days of storage.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites with a general formula of APbX3 (A is organic cation, X is halide anion) have recently emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic semiconductor materials because of their extraordinary optoelectrical features, including excellent bipolar charge mobilities,1–3 long charge carrier diffusion lengths,4,5 desirable band gap,6,7 high optical absorption8–10 and low-cost solution processability.11,12 The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on these lead halide perovskites have risen from an initial 3.8%13 to the highest-level 25.5%14 within the past few years, attributing to composition engineering, processing improvement and architecture optimization. However, for most of the PSCs, a large number of surface defects and grain boundaries with high densities of deep level trap states exist in polycrystalline perovskite films,15–18 and they will only trap either electrons or holes, which cannot escape even with the assistance of thermal activation and will be annihilated with an oppositely charged carrier via non-radiative recombination on the basis of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) theory.19 SRH recombination through deep level traps has been considered as the dominant pathway for the loss of charge carriers in perovskite materials.20
Defective passivation of perovskites has become an important means of suppressing charge recombination, improving film quality of perovskites and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. So far, different passivation molecules containing Lewis bases (e.g., S donor21–23 and N donor22,24,25), Lewis acids (e.g., fullerene derivatives26–28) and π-conjugated molecules29 have been reported to perform as electron donors or electron acceptors that can interact with the charged defects of perovskites, and thereafter annihilate the relevant defect-induced charge traps.
Among them, amino acids and their derivatives as the most widely used amphiphilic organic coupling agents are capable of guiding the formation of a high-quality perovskite film. They are frequently used to modify the mesoporous scaffold of the transporting layer, e.g., mp-TiO2, to accelerate the electron transfer and further improve the efficiency of mesoscopic PSCs since carboxyl groups in amino acids can bind very well onto the surface of transporting layer, while amino groups are able to coordinate with the Pb ions and form hydrogen bonds with iodide ions on the surface of the perovskite layer.30–33 While for planar heterojunction PSCs, the passivation based on the surface coating or treatment of the top surface cannot thoroughly eliminate the traps from inner grain boundaries within the perovskite films, thus adding amino acid or its derivative into the precursor solution of perovskites seems to be a feasible way to reduce electronic defects and improve the film quality of perovskites and thus device performances.
Yun et al. added a rigid p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA·HI) molecule as a crosslinker into perovskite precursor solution. Similar to other amino acids, the amino group and the carboxylic acid group in PABA·HI were capable of interacting with the Pb–I perovskite framework at grain boundaries through hydrogen bonds, while the π-conjugated benzene ring in PABA·HI could enhance the crosslinking efficiency compared with other freely rotating flexible molecular crosslinkers by allowing the conformation of PABA·HI to be readily aligned. The appearance of PABA·HI at perovskite grain boundaries hampered the water intrusion into the perovskite film, thus the PSCs exhibited improved stability in a high-humidity atmosphere (relative humidity of 75%) for 312 h.34
Very recently, Yang S. et al. employed an additive molecule D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine (D4TBP) with trifunctional groups into a perovskite precursor to passivate surface defects and grain boundaries of Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45. In D4TBP, 4-tert-butylphenyl, amine and carboxyl groups enable to passivate Lewis acid type surface defects of iodine and undercoordinated Pb2+, boosting a high efficiency of 21.4% with an extremely high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23 V in p–i–n PSCs.25 Guo et al. demonstrated strong and stable interactions between the uncoordinated Pb ions in MAPbI3 and the carboxylic, hydroxyl and amino groups on the edge of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) via density functional theory calculation. They also identified that the passivation of CQDs not only increased the PCE (from 17.59% to 18.81%) but also enhanced the stability of PSCs via forming a CQDs protective layer.35 These works demonstrate that additive molecules with multifunctional groups can simultaneously passivate different types of defects in perovskites.
Here, to combine the advantages of different functional groups, a trifunctional small molecule AHBA is introduced to passivate the perovskite defects. It contains a carboxyl group and amino group at different terminals of the molecule and another hydroxyl group linked to the carbon backbone. The hydroxyl group can form a hydrogen bond with iodide ion in the perovskite film.36,37 Thus, the multisites interaction with perovskites arising from –COOH, –OH and NH3+ groups of AHBA can ensure sufficient passivation of traps/defects at the grain boundaries or the surface of the perovskite via coordination or hydrogen bonds. The obvious reduced defects via passivation eventually contribute to significant increases in Voc from 1.065 V to 1.110 V and PCE from 17.96% to 20.31% in our inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. Moreover, this strategy also enhances the intrinsic stability of devices, which can maintain over 94% of the initial PCE after 60 days of storage in a N2 atmosphere.
2 Results and discussion
The quality of perovskite films is a key factor influencing device performance. The top-view SEM images of perovskites with different concentrations of AHBA are presented in Fig. 1. The concentration of AHBA in perovskite precursor solution is varied from 0 to 1 mg mL−1. The results in Fig. 1 show that the apparent PbI2 aggregates on the surface of the perovskite film were reduced with the increased AHBA additives. The AHBA additives in the perovskite precursor solution can react with PbI2 and reduce the PbI2 aggregates formed on the perovskite film, which will be further discussed in the XPS analysis. Besides, a smooth film morphology accompanied with increased grain size can be found in the perovskite film with optimized AHBA additives. The average grain size increases from 331 nm to 359 nm for the perovskite film with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA additives and further increased to 394 nm for the perovskite film with 1 mg mL−1 AHBA (see Fig. S1, ESI†). However, some white dots appeared on the surface of the perovskite film with 1 mg mL−1 AHBA, which may ascribe to the excess AHBA. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the pristine perovskite film and the perovskite film with AHBA additives, respectively. According to the height image, the pristine perovskite film shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ∼16.5 nm. However, the RMS roughness is ∼13.5 nm for the perovskite film with AHBA additives. The smooth surface of the perovskite film with AHBA additives would facilitate the interfacial contact between perovskite and the electron transport layer, and thus improve the device performance. Besides, the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film with AHBA additives can be found in the phase images (Fig. S2, ESI†). From the above analysis, we suppose the AHBA additive plays an important role in controlling the morphology and quality of the perovskite film.

Then, we discuss the effect of AHBA on the structural and optical properties of perovskites. To examine the crystal structure, we analyzed the XRD patterns of the annealed Cs0.03(FA0.85MA0.15)0.97Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 films with different AHBA concentrations (0 to 1 mg mL−1), which were deposited on quartz substrates (Fig. 2a). The films present the typical peaks of tetragonal perovskite with the dominant (110) lattice reflection at 14.0°, which is the preferred orientation for the perovskite films. The introduction of AHBA additives in perovskite films did not change their typical 3D perovskite crystal structure. Magnifications of the XRD peaks around the (110) crystal plane with various AHBA content are illustrated on the right of Fig. 2a. The diffraction peaks shift towards low 2θ values with increasing AHBA concentration, indicative of lattice expansion in the AHBA-incorporated perovskite.38 The reason why AHBA induces the lattice expansion needs to be further studied. The diffraction peak at 12.5° is assigned to the (001) plane of the hexagonal PbX2 (12.5°, X = Br−, I−).39 In the XRD patterns, we observe considerably reduced PbX2 diffraction peak intensity with the increasing amount of AHBA, which is consistent with the results obtained by SEM. Furthermore, the light absorption of the film in the visible range of 300–500 nm is obviously improved with a small amount of doping (see Fig. 2b). When the amount of AHBA additive is more than 0.5 mg mL−1, the absorption of the film is greatly reduced because the potential interaction of excessive AHBA with more Pb2+ in the precursor suppresses perovskite generation to some extent. This point can be clearly observed with the disappearance of the PbI2 diffraction peak in Fig. 2a with a greater amount of AHBA, and the interaction of AHBA with Pb ions can be further demonstrated by XPS, which will be discussed later.

To explore the photophysical mechanism of the AHBA-doped perovskite, we performed PL and TRPL measurements on the pristine and doped (0.25 mg mL−1) perovskite films. The samples were excited at 510 nm, and both the perovskite films exhibited an emissive band with a maximum value at approximately 780 nm and a broad emission band ranging from 720 to 850 nm (see Fig. 2c), we observe an obvious increase in the PL intensity of the perovskite film with a small amount of AHBA additive. The increased steady-state PL intensity of the perovskite:AHBA composite film is attributed to the suppression of charged trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses via the interaction of –NH3+ and –OH groups of AHBA with halide from PbX64− (X = Br−, I−) octahedra or the interaction of –COOH/COO− with undercoordinated Pb ions in the perovskite film. Here, we also fitted the TRPL curves in Fig. 2d by the bi-exponential decay equation (eqn (1)): I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)where τ1 and τ2 represent fast and slow decay time constants, and the average lifetime τavr can be calculated with τavr = A1τ1 + A2τ2(2)From the fitted result shown in Table S1 (ESI†), we found that AHBA-incorporated perovskite exhibits a longer bulk carrier lifetime (τ2) of 164.13 ns, surpassing 79.71 ns of the pristine counterpart. Meanwhile, the amplitude of τ1 is decreased from 19.28% to 1.75%, and the decrease in τ1 amplitude is indicative of declined trap-mediated nonradiative recombination due to the reduced defect density. Thus, the resulting AHBA-doped perovskite composite film has an average lifetime τavr of 161.43 ns, which is much longer than 66.93 ns of the pristine one. The enhancements of both steady-state PL intensity and carrier lifetime indicate the passivation of AHBA additive successfully suppresses trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the perovskite film.40
To further confirm the interaction of AHBA with the 3D perovskite, the surface chemical composition and chemical environment of the pristine and doped (0.25 mg mL−1) perovskite films were examined with XPS spectra, with the survey spectra shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and N 1s, I 3d, O 1s, Pb 4f, Br 3d and C 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 3, Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). In Fig. 3a, the N 1s spectra of the control perovskite film can be divided into two characteristic peaks at 400.2 and 401.7 eV, assigned to FA+ and MA+, respectively, matching the initial precursor ratio of MA/FA. For the AHBA-doped perovskite film, it can be deconvoluted into three peaks of 399.9, 400.2 and 401.7 eV, which correspond to FA+, AHBA and MA+, respectively.41,42 The –NH2 group from AHBA shows a 0.2 eV shift towards high binding energy (BE) compared to that (400.0 eV) of the pristine AHBA in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Moreover, the BE of FA+ shows a 0.3 eV shift towards low BE while that of MA+ remains unchanged. In order to clarify the possible reasons for the N 1s BE alterations related to FA+ and AHBA, I 3d, O 1s and Pb 4f XPS spectra are also examined. It is found in Fig. 3b that the BEs of I 3d valence electrons are shifted towards higher energies, further identifying that the iodide of PbI64− octahedra interacts with –NH2 or –NH3+via hydrogen bonding (N–H⋯I), which can explain the 0.2 eV shift of –NH2 (from AHBA) towards high BE (Fig. 3a). Here, –NH3+ is the product of the reaction between –NH2 and H+, both of which are from AHBA. Then, O 1s spectra are analyzed to verify which group from AHBA in addition to –NH2 or –NH3+ interact with perovskite. From Fig. 3c (top), the O 1s spectra of AHBA can be divided into two characteristic peaks at 531.3 and 532.5 eV, assigned to –OH and –COOH, respectively, and they shift to 531.2 and 532.7 eV in the AHBA-doped perovskite. The slight reduction of the BE of the –OH group arises from the formation of a hydrogen bond (O–H⋯I) between the –OH group of AHBA and the iodide of the PbI64− octahedral similar to N–H⋯I. The shift of –COOH towards higher BE probably results from the formation of a coordination bond between –COO− and Pb2+. This point is clearly evidenced by the Pb 4f XPS spectra in Fig. 3d, and the disappearance of two weak peaks of 140.3 and 135.4 eV that originate from uncoordinated Pb ions further confirms such bonding between –COO− and Pb2+, which is capable of reducing Pb2+ defects and thus nonradiative recombination of carriers. The coordination of –COO− with partial Pb2+ also favors to retard the crystallization of PbI2, involving more PbI2 and FAI to react and form a perovskite, which can be identified by the XRD results in Fig. 2a. It is found that more FA ions entering into the lattice causes the lattice expansion and then generates the low angle displacement of the (110) crystal plane in consideration of a larger FA+ radius than those of Cs+ and MA+. The corresponding N 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 3a further verifies this point. The wide full width at half maximum (FWHM) of BE for FA+ in the top figure of Fig. 3a consists of FA-based perovskite and FAI, while the decrease in FWHM with the addition of AHBA (bottom figure of Fig. 3a) indicates that FA-based perovskite is the main component with the sufficient reaction of FAI in the AHBA-incorporated sample. The shift of the FA+ characteristic peak from 400.2 to 399.9 eV might be related to the component change.

From the Br 3d XPS spectra shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the surface/inner ratio of Br 3d is increased in the composite perovskite film doped with AHBA, which demonstrates that the AHBA incorporation favors to reduce Br vacancy via blocking the loss of surface Br−. In the C 1s XPS spectra of perovskite films (Fig. S5, ESI†), the presence of FA+/MA+ cations can be confirmed by the detected C–C (284.5 eV) and C–N (285.6 eV) bonds. For the emerged CO bond (288.3 eV) in the pure perovskite film, we speculate these oxidized carbon species may come from the decomposition of the perovskite film, induced by the absorption of water or oxygen when exposing to the ambient condition.43,44 While for the AHBA-incorporated perovskite, both oxidized perovskite and –COOH/–COO− from AHBA commonly contribute to the slight change of CO bond from 288.3 to 288.1 eV. In addition, the AHBA-added perovskite film has an additional peak at ∼286.1 eV, which is assigned to the –OH moiety from the alkyl chain. As a summary for the above analysis, the functional groups of amino and hydroxyl from AHBA can anchor the halide anions of PbI64− octahedra via hydrogen bond (N–H⋯I/O–H⋯I), while the carboxyl moiety can coordinate with the Pb2+ cations, retarding the crystallization of PbI2 and promoting the reaction of FAI into FA-based perovskite, which restrains the formation of PbI2 and sufficiently reduces the trap states of under-coordinated Pb2+ and their quenching to the carriers inside the final perovskite film. Furthermore, a lower level of Pb defects can reduce the non-radiative recombination and increase the carrier lifetime, in good agreement with the PL and TRPL results, which favors to obtain the enhanced fill factor (FF) and Voc in eventual PSCs. More interestingly, the addition of AHBA into the precursor solution simultaneously reduces the loss of the surface Br− from the perovskite, increasing the stability of the perovskite crystal.
Based on the XPS analysis on the perovskite films, we draw schematic illustrations of the perovskite crystal structures with and without AHBA passivation, with the chemical structure of the AHBA additive also attached, as shown in Fig. 4. Because of the large molecular size of AHBA, the additive prefers to stay at the periphery of the perovskite grains, the –COO− group of which will react with uncoordinated Pb2+, exhibiting the passivation effect to the Pb defects, meanwhile the protonated –NH3+/–NH2 and the –OH groups of which undergo a hydrogen bond interaction (N–H⋯I and O–H⋯I) with iodide from PbI64− octahedra, effectively passivating and crosslinking grain boundaries of perovskite films and forming pinhole-free homogeneous, dense and stable Pb-based perovskite films. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images of the perovskite film with or without AHBA additives and the surface potential maps of corresponding films were obtained. The surface potential difference between the GBs and grains is reduced for the perovskite film with AHBA additives, indicative of the sufficient passivation of traps/defects at the grain boundaries. Note that a small molar excess of PbI2 in the precursor solution was used to fabricate the perovskite active layers. The AHBA additives may react with the excess PbI2 and reduce the PbI2 aggregates formed on the perovskite film (Fig. 1). Besides, the excess PbI2 is one of the sources for the under-coordinated Pb site in the perovskite film.45 Thus, the –COO− group of AHBA may react with uncoordinated Pb2+ from the excess PbI2.

To investigate the effect of AHBA on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we fabricated inverted planar heterojunction PSCs with the configuration of ITO/PTAA: 0.25 wt% F4-TCNQ/perovskite/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Ag (Fig. 5a). The triple cation perovskite with a chemical formula of (Cs0.03(FA0.85MA0.15)0.97)(Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) was used in this work and the fabrication details can be found in the Experimental section. The J–V curves of the PSCs with different concentrations of AHBA are shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device without AHBA yields a maximum PCE of 17.96%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.10 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.065 V, and FF of 76.33%. Interestingly, with AHBA doping concentration of 0.25 mg mL−1, the champion PSC shows a significantly improved PCE of 20.31% with Voc, Jsc and FF of 1.110 V, 23.32 mA cm−2 and 78.51%, respectively. However, further increase of AHBA above 0.5 mg mL−1 causes the deterioration of photovoltaic performance. This variation in photovoltaic performance may be ascribed to the successful passivation of surface and grain boundary of the perovskites induced by a suitable amount of AHBA.

As the statistical data in Fig. S8 (ESI†) indicate, the PSCs based on 0.25 and 1.0 mg mL−1 AHBA exhibit improved Voc of 1.110 and 1.135 V, respectively, compared to that of the pristine device (1.065 V). To observe the possible influence of AHBA modification on the valence band (Ev) of perovskites and Voc of our PSCs, we performed the UPS spectra measurements of the perovskite films without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA, with results illustrated in Fig. S9 (ESI†). From Fig. S9 (ESI†) and the schematic diagram of energy levels of our PSCs in Fig. S10 (ESI†), it is found that the AHBA-doped perovskite film presents an upward-shifted Ev from −5.69 to −5.54 eV compared to the pristine counterpart, which will make the Ev of perovskites more compatible with PTAA and facilitate to reduce energy loss at the PTAA/perovskite interfacial layers,46,47 resulting in a higher Voc in the modified devices. Moreover, the defect passivation of perovskite absorption films with amino, hydroxyl and carboxyl trifunctional groups from AHBA will reduce the charged defects and nonradiative recombination centers within the perovskites, which will also result in a higher density of photogenerated charges and therefore provide larger quasi-Fermi level splitting and Voc values.48
The J–V curves in forward and reverse scans of the PSCs without (pristine) or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA are compared in Fig. 5c. It can be found that the champion device with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA shows a reduced hysteresis in the J–V curves. This can also be confirmed by the J–V curves of the PSCs under different scan rates (Fig. S11 and Table S2, ESI†). Previous studies suggested that the hysteresis behavior in PSCs is mainly related to the native defects and ion migration.34,49 The addition of AHBA reduces the charged defects of perovskite grains via coordination or hydrogen bonds, which remarkably reduces ionic defects (e.g., iodide and bromine vacancies) and simultaneously impedes ion migration, both of which contribute to the suppressed hysteresis.50

Fig. 5d shows the incident IPCE curves of the devices without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA. The integrated Jscs of the corresponding devices are 20.31 mA cm−2 and 21.59 mA cm−2, which coincide well with those experimental values from the J–V measurements. It is worth noting that the IPCE of the device with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA is up to ∼90% in the whole visible light range of 400–750 nm. More interestingly, the IPCE at 350–600 nm is obviously improved, which is much higher than that of the control device. This improvement of IPCE over the whole region can be derived from increased charge extraction due to the elimination of traps and recombination sites in the device. In our study, the AHBA was added in the perovskite solution to form a high-quality perovskite film. Thus, we suppose that the passivation of defects including both the front and rear surface of the perovskite film and grain boundaries in the perovskite bulk. Because the blue light is mainly absorbed very close to the front surface, the IPCE response is significantly influenced by the charge traps on the surface of perovskite. Thus the efficient passivation of defects by AHBA will show much improvement in IPCE response in this region. Besides, the improved IPCE in blue light region for the device with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA should partially stem from the enhanced absorption in this region, as shown in Fig. 2b. The reproducibility of the PCE was examined by fabricating 20 devices for each kind of PSCs without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA. From the histograms of PCE values of the 20 devices, as shown in Fig. 5e, the average efficiency of the devices was increased from 17.02% to 19.33% when 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA was added in the perovskites. Furthermore, the champion device with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA was held at the maximum power point (MPP) to track the power output. As shown in Fig. 5f, the photocurrent stabilized within seconds to be 21.7 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 19.7%. This indicates the effectiveness of the AHBA additive in the perovskites for improving the device efficiencies of PSCs.
To further explore the charge transport and recombination kinetics information in the device, we conducted the EIS measurements for the PSCs without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA under dark conditions. The Nyquist plots of the corresponding PSCs as well as an equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 6a. It can be seen that only one semicircle appears in the Nyquist plot of the corresponding PSC, which is similar with the references based on inverted planar heterojunction PSCs.51,52 As the equivalent circuit schemed in the inset, the impedance spectra are fitted by the equivalent model consisting of series resistance (Rs), recombination resistance (Rrec)53,54 and constant phase element (CPE) of the electrical double layer. The PSC based on the AHBA-doped perovskite shows a larger Rrec (7529 Ω vs. 4720 Ω) and lower Rs (29.06 Ω vs. 30.25 Ω), which further verifies the suppressed carrier recombination and efficient charge transfer in the AHBA-doped device. As reported before, the charge recombination could be assessed by the Rrec, where the high Rrec indicates that the charge is hard to recombine by traps.54 Therefore, the increase in Rrec indicates a reduction in the charge recombination, which is mainly attributed to the reduced defect density in the AHBA-doped perovskites.55,56 In contrast, the higher interface charge recombination (a smaller Rrec) in the control device could deteriorate the fill factor and Voc, which is consistent with the J–V characterization (Table 1). Fig. 6b shows the dark J–V curves of the devices without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA. The AHBA-doped PSC possesses smaller leakage current than the control one. The lower dark current indicates that the optimized perovskite films with AHBA can prevent the current leakage, which is beneficial for the improvement of device efficiency. Moreover, we employed the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique for directly analyzing the trap-state density of the corresponding films with the structure of ITO/perovskite (w/o and with AHBA)/Au.34 In the trap-filled limited region, all the trap states are continuously filled by the injected carriers until the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).57 The trap density is calculated using eqn (3):58 (3)where εr is the dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and e is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig. 6c, the VTFLs of pristine and AHBA-doped devices are 2.428 and 0.775 V, respectively. The calculated trap densities of the perovskite films without and with AHBA are 2.38 × 1016 and 7.55 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Thus, we can conclude that the trap density inside the AHBA-doped perovskite film is lower than that of the pristine counterpart, which may ascribe to the sufficient multisite defect passivation of perovskites by AHBA.57,59–62

In order to investigate the stability of the PSCs without or with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA, we tested the devices by storing the devices under N2 conditions as well as air conditions (room temperature and 30 ± 5% relative humidity) under dark conditions without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 7, the stability of the PSCs with 0.25 mg mL−1 AHBA was found to be significantly better than that of the control device. The PSCs without AHBA decay to 70% of the initial PCEs after 39 and 21 days in the N2 and air conditions, respectively. In contrast, the AHBA-doped devices still maintain as high as over 94% of the initial value after 60 days of storage under N2 conditions, and even in an air atmosphere, they retain 70% of the initial efficiency after aging for 50 days, exhibiting extremely good stability. Besides, Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows the PCEs as a function of light exposure time under AM 1.5G one sun illumination, where the PCE is reduced by 40% and 70% within 24 h for devices with and without AHBA additives, respectively. This further confirms an improved stability of PSC with AHBA additive. Considering that only perovskite layers are different, the improved stability only arises from the modification of the perovskite films by AHBA, which stabilizes the crystal structure of the perovskites and retards their degradation process via preventing the loss of the surface Br− and ion migration with multisite passivation.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we introduced a new amino acid molecule AHBA with trifunctional groups of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups into a perovskite precursor solution to sufficiently passivate iodide anions of PbI64− octahedra and uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite film. The addition of AHBA also delayed the perovskite crystallization process and involved more FA+ and Pb2+ in the precursor solution to form full coverage, low defect density and high crystallinity perovskite films with increasing grain sizes. Moreover, the moderate AHBA doping stabilized the 3D perovskite crystal structure via reducing the loss of surface Br− and retarding ion migration of the Pb–I perovskite framework. With a suitable doping amount of AHBA into the 3D perovskite, both PCE and stability were significantly enhanced for planar heterojunction PSCs. The champion device showed a PCE of 20.31% and maintained over 94% of the initial PCE after 60 days of storage under N2 conditions. Our work on multisite passivation offers a feasible approach to boost both efficiency and stability of PSCs.
