    , Accepted 3rd October 2012First published on 9th October 2012AbstractWe experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the hierarchical structure of SiO2 nanorod arrays/p-GaN microdomes as a light harvesting scheme for InGaN-based multiple quantum well solar cells. The combination of nano- and micro-structures leads to increased internal multiple reflection and provides an intermediate refractive index between air and GaN. Cells with the hierarchical structure exhibit improved short-circuit current densities and fill factors, rendering a 1.47 fold efficiency enhancement as compared to planar cells.
InGaN-based solar cells (SCs) have attracted extensive interest due to their direct and tuneable bandgaps spanning nearly the full solar spectrum, which promise a theoretical efficiency over 40%.1–9 In addition, the advantages such as high absorption coefficients, high mobilities, and superior radiation resistance for operation under harsh environments promote the InGaN SCs to practical applications.1–4 Employing multiple quantum well (MQW) structures further expands the tenability of short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) which helps maximize the efficiency,4,5 and avoids the lattice mismatch between GaN and InGaN which degrades the device performance.4–6 However, up to now, the conversion efficiencies (η) of the InGaN-based SCs are still limited.7–9 Preventing the optical loss at interfaces, which arises from the abrupt change of refractive index between air and the device, is a critical issue for the pursuit of higher efficiencies. Implementing nanostructures as antireflection (AR) layers has been shown as an effective strategy to smoothen the abrupt index change at interfaces. As for the structure dimension, the functionalities of the AR layers can be grouped into two types. When the structure dimension is much larger than the incident wavelength, multiple reflection plays a dominant role in light trapping.10 When the geometric feature of the structure is smaller than the incident wavelength, the decreased reflectance can be attributed to the gradient change of refractive index (n) from air to the device.11–14 The hierarchical structure is a hybrid concept combining the two mentioned geometries by integrating large (or microscale) and small (or nanoscale) structures to achieve the optimized photovoltaic (PV) performance.15–19 For example, Si microgrooves and ZnO nanowires (NWs) have been employed on single crystalline Si SCs for eliminating the reflection loss.15 The hierarchical structure employing TiO2 and SiO2 NWs was demonstrated as an effective AR structure over a broad range of wavelengths.18 Fan et al. developed three-dimensional hierarchical NW arrays with significantly enhanced light absorption.17 However, the studies of hierarchical AR structures fabricated on InGaN-based SCs have been rarely reported to date.
Another vital issue in the development of nitride SCs is the crystal quality of epitaxial layers. Various techniques used to improve the epitaxial qualities have been reported in the field of light-emitting diodes (LEDs).20–23 For example, roughening the p-GaN layer can relieve the in-plane strain, decreasing the amount of defects at the interface and reducing the piezoelectric effects, thus boosting the emission efficiency of LEDs.22,23 Recently, a similar concept has been applied to InGaN-based SCs, where the fill factor (FF) was enhanced from 44% to 71%.24
In this study, we propose a hierarchical scheme using SiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) and p-GaN microdomes to enhance the PV performance of InGaN SCs. The microdome structure is employed to improve the crystal quality of p-GaN and to increase the multiple reflection on the device surface. The subwavelength SiO2 NRAs further reduce the surface reflection over a wide range of wavelengths due to their intermediate refractive index (n = 1.56) between air (n = 1) and GaN (n = 2.5). The MQW SC with the SiO2 NRA/p-GaN microdome structure exhibits a 1.47 fold enhancement in η, compared to that of planar SCs. The result is attributed to the improvement of crystal quality and excellent light absorption of the hierarchical structure. Simulation results based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis support the improved optical absorption upon the application of SiO2 NRAs/p-GaN microdomes. The design concept and the fabrication techniques adopted here provide a viable scheme for light harvesting in nitride-based SCs.
The MQW SCs were grown by metal–organic chemical vapour deposition on c-plane sapphire substrates. The layer structures consist of fifteen periods of intentionally undoped In0.15Ga0.85N (2.4 nm)/GaN (14 nm) MQWs, sandwiched between a 2.5 μm n-type (Si-doped) and a 0.2 μm p-type (Mg-doped) GaN layer. Ammonia (NH3), trimethylgallium (TMGa, for n-GaN and p-GaN), triethylgallium (TEGa, for MQWs), and trimethylindium (TMI) were used as the precursors. Surface morphologies of p-GaN were controlled by TMGa flows and substrate temperatures. For planar p-GaN, the TMGa flow rate was 45 μmol min−1 and the substrate temperature was in the range of 980–1050 °C; for p-GaN microdomes, the TMGa flow rate was 55 μmol min−1 and the substrate temperature was decreased to the range of 880–920 °C. In device fabrication, indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited by electron beam evaporation on p-GaN to form transparent ohmic contacts. The 1 × 1 mm2 diode mesas were then defined by chlorine-based plasma etching. The contacting scheme consists of fingered Ti/Al/Ni/Au metal grids deposited on the ITO and n-GaN.
The fabrication process of the hierarchical surface is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ag (15 nm)/SiO2 (450 nm) were subsequently deposited by electron beam evaporation onto the ITO layer with p-GaN microdomes. Then, a thermal annealing was carried out in a furnace at 280 °C for 2 min, leading to segregated Ag nanoparticles through a self-assembly mechanism. Using these Ag nanoparticles as etching masks, the SiO2 layer was patterned by the RIE process with CHF3 gas (30 SCCM) and rf power of 90 W for 9 min. After removing the remaining Ag nanoparticles by HNO3, the vertically aligned SiO2 NRAs were obtained on the p-GaN microdome layer.

Morphological studies of the roughened structures were performed with a JEOL JSM-6700 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Optical reflectance measurements were carried out by a standard UV-visible spectrometer (JASCO ARN-733) at the incident angle of 5°. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of SCs were measured by coupling the halogen lamp to a monochromator. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of SCs under the illumination of air mass 1.5 global (100 mW cm−2) were obtained with a Keithley 4200 source meter.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the AR nanostructures, where the p-GaN microdomes are 530 ± 250 nm in height and 600 ± 370 nm in diameter. The SiO2 NRAs exhibit the height in the range of 300 to 450 nm and diameter in the range of 90 to 180 nm. The diameters and heights of NRAs are controllable through the annealing temperature of the Ag film and the etching time of the RIE process.

The light-trapping abilities of the three devices with different surface morphologies, namely, (i) flat, (ii) p-GaN microdomes and (iii) SiO2 NRAs/p-GaN microdomes, were investigated with the specular reflectance spectrum. Fig. 3 shows the measurement results. The flat surface reflected 3–8% of the incident light. The p-GaN microdomes reduce the reflectance to 1–3% (black line), and adding the SiO2 NRAs further suppresses the reflectance to <0.5% (red line). The reduction in reflectance for the roughened surfaces can be explained by several effects. Firstly, the p-GaN dome structure at the micron scale leads to the light trapping effect due to the strong light scattering. As light strikes the microdomes, it diffracts to several beams and rebounces between the microdomes, preventing the optical waves from escaping back to air. Considering the addition of SiO2 NRAs, the subwavelength dimensions of NRAs and the low refractive index of SiO2 make the NRAs behave as an effective medium. The improved impedance mismatch of the refractive index between air and microdomed p-GaN leads to destructive interferences between the reflected beams, in which waves with different phases can be partially or wholly cancelled by each other. For the incident wavelengths shorter than the feature size of NRAs, the multiple reflection in the SiO2 NRAs also traps the reflected light. Additionally, the SiO2 NRAs acting as a homogeneous medium with low effective refractive index facilitate light transmitting across the interface, and thus provide broadband reduction of reflectance. The reduced reflectance on the hierarchical AR structure is expected to increase the optical absorption by the underneath active region.

FDTD analysis was performed to gain insight into the incident light propagating through the device interfaces, where three surface morphologies are modelled: planar surface, p-GaN microdomes and hierarchical SiO2 NRAs/p-GaN microdomes. The electric-field profiles of the transverse electric (TE)-polarized light with the wavelength of 400 nm are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). They clearly show that the field intensities into the MQW are enhanced by the microdome surfaces and can be further amplified as NRAs are implemented, in good agreement with the experimental results described above. In the figures, it is also found that the fields are strongly confined within the SiO2 NRAs/p-GaN microdomes, demonstrating the superior light trapping characteristics of this hierarchical structure. Furthermore, the enhanced forward scattering of light across the air/device interface by the hierarchical surface prolongs the optical path, and should benefit the photon absorption in the active region of SCs, which will be demonstrated later. The normalized optical absorption as a function of time corresponding to the three different structures is shown in Fig. 4(d), where the optical powers within the MQW region are compared. The values of steady-state absorption for devices with planar, p-GaN microdomes and SiO2 NRAs/p-GaN microdomes are 0.65, 0.75 and 0.78, respectively. The simulation results indicate that the hierarchical structure not only increases the light scattering but also helps light propagate across the interfaces by avoiding the abrupt index transition from air to GaN.

Fig. 5(a) shows the measured current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the InGaN MQWSCs with three surface conditions. The device performances are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the planar SCs, the enhanced Jsc for InGaN MQW SCs with p-GaN microdomes is due to the enhanced light absorption by the microdome surface and the improved crystal qualities.24–26 The superior crystal qualities of p-GaN microdomes are also reflected by the increased FF.24–27Fig. 5(b) presents the EQE spectra for the three cells. The p-GaN microdomes result in the higher EQEs at 360–450 nm. The excellent light-harvesting hierarchical structure consisting of SiO2 NRAs and p-GaN microdomes leads to the highest EQEs, which agrees with the highest increment in Jsc by the SiO2 NRA/p-GaN microdome structure. In short, due to the notable increase in Jsc and FF, the MQW cell with the hierarchical surface morphology attains the largest η, which is 21% and 146% higher than those with bare p-GaN microdomes and planar cells, respectively. We note that a slight decrease in Voc is also observed for the microdome solar cells. This has been predicted by previous simulation works focusing on nanowire solar cells, reporting that increasing the cell roughness could lead to the decrease in Voc in spite of increases in efficiency.2,3 The optimization considerations must be made in future with respect to the geometric parameters of microdome structures due to the inverse behavior of Jsc and Voc.

In summary, we employed a hierarchical surface texture consisting of SiO2 NRAs and p-GaN microdomes as the AR layers for InGaN MQW SCs. The nano- and micro-scale structures significantly suppress specular reflection over a wide range of wavelengths, which is attributed to multiple reflection caused by the microdome morphology and the subwavelength feature of the nanorods. The boosted EQE and FF led to the giant η enhancement by up to 146%, as compared with planar surfaces. The presented light-harvesting design using the hierarchical structure should also be a feasible scheme for many other PV devices.
