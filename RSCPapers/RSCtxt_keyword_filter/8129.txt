    , Accepted 29th April 2021First published on 6th May 2021AbstractA series of narrow band gap conjugated copolymers with different alkyl side chains were synthesized via Stille copolymerization of benzodifuran (BDF) and benzothiadiazole (BT) monomers. The origination effect of the alkyl side chains, linked to the thienyl side groups of BDF based backbone, on the optical, electronic and morphological properties of the resulting polymers were investigated and correlated with the photovoltaic performance. It was found that the different alkyl side chains positions have a significant impact on the polymeric optoelectronic properties due to differences of torsion in the backbones. The best performance of the bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJ) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.73% was achieved with PBFDBT-o as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor, which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility as well as the optimized interpenetrating network with respect to the other two polymers. The results demonstrated that the alkyl side chain position manipulations play a crucial role in adjusting the optoelectronic properties of BDF based copolymers and it is a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells.
Introduction
In the last few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their light weight, low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large-area flexible devices.1–12 So far, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, using a solution-processed active layer composed of an electron-rich donor and an electron-deficient acceptor, sandwiched between ITO and metallic electrodes, can achieve promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15–17%.13–16 Conjugated photovoltaic polymers generally contain two parts: π-conjugated backbones and flexible solubilizing side chains. The former mainly determine the optoelectronic properties of the resulting polymers. Consequently, most research efforts have focused on the conjugated backbones.17 For the latter topic of flexible solubilizing side chains, it has not been fully exploited even though numerous side chain substituents have been tried over the years.18 It is found that the alkyl side chains also have close relationships with the physical properties of polymers, such as solubility, morphology, thermal property and so on. These physical properties will further affect the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.19 For example, in the polythiophene (PTh) system, both length and regioregularity of alkyl side chains attached to polymeric main chains could obviously affect the macromolecular aggregation state, crystallinity, melting point, absorption range, charge mobility, the electronic energy levels and even optoelectronic device results.20–22 Besides the simple conjugated aromatic structure in PTh main chains, there are more complicated conjugated structures such as alternative D–A copolymers or random copolymers, having alkyl side chains on every repeat subunit.23–26 Commonly, the alkyl side chains studied focus following two main issues: alkyl length (carbon atom number), chain constitutions (straight chains or branch chains), both of which affect their performances to some degree. For example, for indacenodithiophene (IDT)-co-benzothiadiazole (BT) copolymers, although the absorptions and energy levels of the series changed only a little, with the change of alkyl side chains length attached to indacenodithiophene, the photovoltaic efficiencies obviously varied between 0.66 and 5.5%.27 In another case, a series of highly efficient PTB polymers, composed of alternating thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) and benzodithiophene (BDT) units, yield one of the top photovoltaic efficiencies of ca. 7%. But with the varying length of side chains in thienothiophene and/or benzodithiophene subunits, the corresponding efficiencies changed in a range of 2.3–7.4%.28,29 Therefore, exploring the alkyl side chains effects on polymer properties and device results are one of the important aims in organic molecular structure optimization.
Recently, the Huo group reported a series of benzodifuran (BDF) based copolymers, which exhibit efficient photovoltaic efficiencies due to the planar molecular structures and high mobilities of the BDF units.30,31 When alkyl side chains linked to the thienyl side groups were introduced into a BDF based backbone as two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated side chains, the corresponding polymers show a promising PCE.32,33 Meanwhile, a very interesting phenomenon had been found recently where para-hexyl-phenyl and meta-hexyl-phenyl substituted IDT based copolymers show different optical and electronic properties and photovoltaic device results.34 In addition, both the Yang group and the Huo group reported some work about side chain steric strategy.35–40 That implies that the alkyl side chains with different positions may affect molecular crystallinity, the electronic energy levels and other optical-electronic properties.
Inspired by these preliminary results, in this work, we systematically designed a series of BDF based copolymers with different alkyl side chains positions, and investigated the corresponding optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers. Although several studies have been reported concerning the comparison between alkyl side-chain length, regioregularity, straight or branch chains effects, there is no investigation into para-, ortho- and meta-positions linked to thienyl side chains effects with the same BDF units as the backbone.
With the different alkyl substituent positions linked to thienyl side groups as conjugated side chains, alkyl chains are classified into three types: a long branch para-hexyldecyl-thienyl (p-hexyldecyl-thienyl) side chain, two ortho-dioctyl-thienyl (o-dioctyl-thienyl) side chains and two meta-dioctyl-thienyl (m-dioctyl-thienyl) side chains. Correspondingly the polymers are PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m, respectively (see Scheme 1). Since the polymers have the same backbones, the comparison between them with the same number of soluble alkyl carbon atoms will provide useful information on the influence of the alkyl side chain positions on the polymeric optical, electrical, and photovoltaic properties. Solution-processed BHJ solar cells, using PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m as electron donor materials and PC71BM as an electron acceptor counterpart, were fabricated under optimized device conditions. An obvious difference in the PCE values (4.86%, 6.73% and 5.51%) was obtained from PBFDBT-p:PC71BM, PBFDBT-o:PC71BM and PBFDBT-m:PC71BM based device results. It means the architecture of different alkyl substituents positions plays a determining role in BDF based polymeric photovoltaic devices.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The chemical structures and synthetic routes toward the polymers are outlined in Scheme 2. Compound (2) of 3-bromo-5-octylthiophene was almost quantitative obtained by LDA from 2-bromo-5-octylthiophene (1). Both compound (3) and compound (5) were got by common Grignard reactions. Compound (6) of 2-hexyldecylthiophene was synthesized according to previous literature procedures.41 In the following similar reactions, compounds b1, b2 and b3 was obtained by the modified literature.42 The DTBT monomer was prepared through the reported method.43 The tin monomers of c1, c2 and c3 also were prepared using similar literature methods.42 As a result, we synthesized the three alternative copolymers by typical Stille coupling reactions under the same polymerized reaction conditions. After the polymerizations were finished all polymers were purified by Soxhlet funnel and extracted using methanol, hexane, and chloroform successively. The chloroform fraction was collected, concentrated and precipitated from a large amount of methanol. All these polymers appear soluble in common solvents such as chloroform and dichlorobenzene. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against polystyrene standards in CHCl3 eluent and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1.

Instruments

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker arx-400 spectrometer in CDCl3 at 293 K. Absorption spectra were obtained on a Hitachi U-3100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC the method, wherein polystyrene was used as a standard by using chloroform as the eluent. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a CHI650D Electrochemical Workstation using a Pt disk, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System (QE-R3011) from Enli Technology Inc. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Fabrication of polymer solar cells
Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated under conditions as follows. After spin-coating a 35 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto a pre-cleaned indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, the polymer/PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated. The concentration of the polymer/PC71BM blend solutions used in this study for spin-coating were 10 mg ml−1 (polymer/o-dichlorobenzene), and o-dichlorobenzene was used as the solvent. The thickness of the active layers was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin-coating process and measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The devices were completed by evaporating Ca/Al metal electrodes with an area of 4 mm2 as defined by masks. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under a 100 mW cm−2 standard AM 1.5 G spectrum using an XES-70S1 (San-EI Electric Co., LTD.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photo-beam size) 2 cm × 2 cm. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ, purchased from VLSI Standards Inc) prior to performing the J–V measurements.

Thermal stability
The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis(TGA), as shown in Fig. 1a. The TGA analysis reveals that, in the air, the onset points of the weight loss with 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) of PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m are 301 °C, 320 °C and 343 °C, respectively, which indicate that PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m containing ortho-positions or meta-positions side chains possess a slightly better thermal stability against oxygen than PBFDBT-p with para-position side chains.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in diluted chloroform solutions and in solid thin films are shown in Fig. 1b. There are three absorption bands for each polymer and the maximum absorption bands for these polymers should be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The absorption main peaks of PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m of ca. 589 nm, 577 nm and 554 nm are recorded. Compared to the main peak of PBFDBT-p, that of PBFDBT-o appears blue-shift by 12 nm and that PBFDBT-m appears more blue-shift by 35 nm, respectively. That implies that the para-position alkyl side chains linked to thienyl-substituted PBFDBT-p are beneficial to form the strongest π–π interactions between polymeric backbones. And the shortest main absorption peak of PBFDBT-m implies the meta-position pendent side chains may penetrate the planar molecular structure of polymeric backbones and therefore the biggest steric hindrance is formed, which causes the weakest π–π interactions between polymeric backbones and blue-shifted absorption.
From Fig. 1c, it was found that all the absorption spectra of these polymers in films were red-shifted compared to these of the polymers in solutions due to stronger aggregation states in films. And the same order of absorption main peaks positions in films is found in comparison with that of absorption peaks in solutions. The main absorption peaks of PBFDBT-m, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-p are located at ca. 570 nm, 592 nm and 606 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, in comparison with the smooth main absorption peak of PBFDBT-m, that of PBFDBT-o appears with a shoulder peak located at 636 nm, from which it is tentatively concluded that PBFDBT-o containing ortho-positions side chains possess weaker steric hindrances than PBFDBT-m containing meta-positions side chains and it is easier for the former to form a relatively ordered aggregation state. From a distinguished more red-shifted shoulder peak of at 651 nm in the PBFDBT-p film, it is implied that para-positions side chains possess fewer steric hindrances than ortho-position side chains. Furthermore, from the absorption onsets of these polymers in solid thin films, the above conclusion can be rationalized. Correspondingly, their optical band gap of Eoptg could be calculated and related absorption data and Eoptg values are listed in Table 2.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was adopted to measure the oxidation and reduction potentials. From Fig. 1d, it can be seen that all three polymers present reversible p-doping (vs. Ag/Ag+) processes. The oxidation potentials of PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m are 0.53 V, 0.58 V and 0.77 V, respectively. PBFDBT-o showed a slightly higher oxidation potential than PBFDBT-p by 50 mV. It is obvious that PBFDBT-m with meta-positions side chains had a higher oxidation potential by ca. 0.2 V than that of the para-position and ortho-position polymers. From the Eox and Ered, HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the energy gap of the polymer were calculated according to the equations of LUMO= −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV) and HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV),44 where the units of Eox and Ered are volt versus Ag/Ag+. And correspondingly, CV values of these polymers calculated from these electrochemical measurement results are listed in Table 3 and Fig. 1e.

To further explain the different HOMO values of these polymers with the same molecular backbones but different alkyl side chains positions, density functional theory (DFT) at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level was employed to evaluate the different alkyl side chains positions influence. To simplify the calculations, only different alkyl-positions attached to theineyl-substituted BDT units were subject to the calculations, with alkyl chains replaced by CH2CH3 groups in Fig. 2. Considering the molecular conformation differences among these polymers along the vertical direction due to different alkyl positions, we calculated the dihedral angles (θ1) between thienyl-substituents and BDF units. From the calculated results, we found the θ1 values are 48.2°, 53.3° and 83.7° for PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m, respectively. These results indicate that steric hindrances between BDF and thienyl substituents increase from one para-position alkyl chains to two ortho-position side chains and further to two meta-positions side chains, which are also coincident with the optical absorption spectra. The largest value of θ1 between two meta-positions side chains and BDF means the thienyl substituents are almost vertical. This not only decreases electron density distributions in thienyl substituents, but also lower the corresponding HOMO levels and improve anti-oxidation ability. For PBFDBT-o, the moderate θ1 value between two ortho-position side chains and BDF cause its moderate HOMO level and anti-oxidation ability. Meanwhile, the simulated results are coincident with the measured results. Therefore, from the electrochemical experiments and theory analyzed results we could conclude that the meta-positions side chains have the largest influence and ortho-positions side chains have the least influence on the oxidation potential and HOMO levels. In addition, it can be seen from Table 3 that although discrepancies exist between the calculation and experimental results, the trends of variation in the HOMO and LUMO levels as well as the energy gaps are identical.

As one of the very important tools to detect the nano-morphology of these polymeric films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to gain insight into the intermolecular interactions since the value of the (100) spacing corresponds to the distance between polymeric backbones, which is determined by the alkyl side chains. As shown in Fig. 3, PBFDBT-p and PBFDBT-o display obvious diffraction signals in the (100) direction at 4.23° at and 4.62°, corresponding to the d-spacing of 20.87 Å and 19.11 Å, respectively, which means that the lamellar distance of PBFDBT-p is larger than that of PBFDBT-o. This could be explained to be because the longer para-positions branch hexyldecyl side chains in PBFDBT-p require more lamellar stacking space than ortho-positions two octyl side chains in PBFDBT-o. Compared with the stronger diffraction intensities of PBFDBT-p and PBFDBT-o, however, PBFDBT-m seem to have no signal in the (100) direction, which can be explained by the larger steric hindrances caused by the meta-positions two octyl side chains that result in more interdigitated molecular configurations. In the (010) direction, the reflection corresponds to the interchain π–π stacking distance. PBFDBT-p and PBFDBT-o exhibit 2θ peaks at 25.13° and 24.61° respectively, corresponding to the d-spacing of 3.51 Å for PBFDBT-p and 3.60 Å for PBFDBT-o. However, for PBFDBT-m no obvious reflection signals are detected and it showed amorphous films mostly due to the same larger steric hindrances reason caused by vertical meta-positions alkyl side chains. Based on these results, we could conclude that from para-positions alkyl chains to ortho-positions alkyl chains and further to meta-positions alkyl chains, they could effective tune polymeric crystallinity.

Hole mobility measurement and fabrication of polymer solar cells
We used a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au for the hole mobility measurement, based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model. According to the following equation ln(JL3/V2) ⋍ 0.89(1/E0)0.5(V/L)0.5 + ln(9εε0μ0/8), where μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, L is the thickness of the polymer layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). According to the equation, hole mobility can be calculated (see Fig. 4) and correspondingly the mobilities are 4.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBFDBT-p, 7.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBFDBT-o and 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBFDBT-m, respectively. The para-position and ortho-position alkyl chain based polymers show higher hole mobilites by one magnitude than meta-position alkyl chain based polymer due to their better crystallinity.

Polymer solar cells were fabricated from these three polymers and (6,6)-phenyl-C71 -butyl acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with a typical device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. Different D/A weight ratios in chlorobenzene solutions were tested for every polymer to optimize the device performances. Other processing conditions such as additives and annealing were also studied. Typical current density–voltage (I–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5 and the device performance data with the optimized conditions are listed in Table 4.

For PBFDBT-p based devices, with the increase of polymer content in the active layers, all parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF dropped. When the optimized weight ratio (1:1) of PBFDBT-p: PC71BM was further annealed at 110 °C for 15 min, the corresponding photovoltaic performances such as Jsc was improved from 8.39 mA cm−2 to 11.60 mA cm−2 and ultimately a PCE of 4.86% was attained. For PBFDBT-o based devices, under the optimized weight ratio (1:1.5), Voc decreased to 0.73 V from 0.76 V. After annealing at 110 °C 15 min, an efficient PCE of 6.73% was obtained from PBFDBT-o based devices mostly because the Jsc increased by 15% to 14.72 mA cm−2 from 12.86 mA cm−2. In comparison with PBFDBT-p and PBFDBT-o based devices, PBFDBT-m showed the highest Voc of 0.89 V and a moderate PCE of 5.51% under the 1:2 weight ratio and annealing conditions. From these device processing cases it can be seen that the devices were strongly dependent on the morphology of the active layer and annealing conditions.
Among these optimized device results, the Voc of PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m based devices varied in a large range of 0.67–0.89 V, which should be closely related to their different HOMO levels. PBFDBT-m owing to the lowest lying HOMO of −5.48 eV has the highest Voc of 0.89 V. On the contrary, PBFDBT-p owing to the highest lying HOMO of −5.24 eV has the lowest Voc of 0.67 V. Therefore, in this system it is proved that the Voc can be effectively manipulated in a large range by the different alkyl side chains positions. In the meantime, it is noted that for PBFDBT-M and P71CBM based devices, the Voc values changed greatly for different blending weight ratios considering that Voc is related to the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) state (Ect) as Voc = Ect/q − 0.6 V, which is affected by nanoscale phase separation morphology.45 It is proposed that the low crystalline PBFDBT-M blending ratios cause a greater effect on Ect and thus lead to the great change in Voc. The similar phenomena also have been observed for lower crystalline donors such as PPV or P3HT cases, et al.46,47
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the device with optimized D/A ratios for these three polymers were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b. The PSC devices exhibited excellent response in their absorption range. For PBFDBT-o based devices, the higher EQE values than that of PBFDBT-p and PBFDBT-m based devices, as well as the larger EQE response range than those of others together contribute to the highest Jsc.
Considering that the alkyl side chains positions are very sensitive to the subsequent photovoltaic results, their morphologies also should be studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 6 shows the AFM height images of PBFDBT-p:PC71BM, PBFDBT-o:PC71BM, and PBFDBT-m:PC71BM blend films with their optimized weight ratios and process conditions, respectively. As clearly evidenced by AFM, the PBFDBT-p:PC71BM and PBFDBT-o:PC71BM blend films show a relatively highcoarse surface with the root mean square (RMS) of 4.21 and 3. 56 nm, respectively. The high RMS values for both blends should be attributed to the strong crystalline tendency of para-positions and ortho-position side chains (Fig. 6a and b), which is coincident with their XRD curves. As for the PBFDBT-m:PC71BM blend film, it shows a relatively low RMS of 1.87 nm (Fig. 6c), which may come from the bigger twisting tendency of meta-position side chains of PBFDBT-m. These different RMS values resulting from different alkyl side chain orientations agree well with the surface coarseness degree observed in the AFM height images and would affect blend film microscale morphologies. The PBFDBT-o:PC71BM blend film with a moderate RMS shows a reasonable surface, which may lead to better bicontinuous carrier transport channels being formed, and hence improve the corresponding Jsc values comparing with those of PBFDBT-p:PC70BM and PBFDBT-m:PC71BM based devices.

In summary, to finely tune BDF based polymer crystallinity to optimize its morphology and PCE, three novel benzodifuran–benzothiadiazole copolymers, PBFDBT-p, PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m, were designed, synthesized, and characterized. We found that the different alkyl substituent positions linked to thienyl side groups as conjugated side chains significantly influence the intermolecular interactions. In particular, the polymer PBFDBT-p containing a long branch para-hexyldecyl-thienyl (p-hexyldecyl-thienyl) side chain shows a more planar backbone conformation, compared to PBFDBT-o and PBFDBT-m, which promotes more aggregation configurations and larger domains in blend polymers, agreeing well with the red-shifted absorption spectra and the stronger crystalline intensity. In contrast, two meta-dioctyl-thienyl (m-dioctyl-thienyl) side chains of PBFDBT-m causes great steric hindrance because meta-dioctyl-thienyl side chains are almost perpendicular to the BDF backbone. As a result, PBFDBT-m showed the largest blue-shifted absorption spectra, weak crystalline signals and partly amorphous nano-structure. Ultimately, a highest PCE of 6.73% with a maximum Jsc of 14.72 mA cm−2, a moderate Voc of 0.71 V and a FF of 64% were obtained from the PBFDBT-o:PC71BM blend, which can be attributed to its more balanced molecular aggregation against strong crystallinity or amorphous configurations, and optimized interpenetrating network than the PBFDBT-p or PBFDBT-m based blends. All these results demonstrated that the crucial role of steric effect of the alkyl chains positions on the optoelectronic properties of BDF based copolymers and the steric effect is proved to be an easy and promising molecular design strategy for the further development of BDF based photovoltaic polymers.
