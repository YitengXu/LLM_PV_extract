    , Accepted 1st March 2013First published on 12th March 2013AbstractA new four-armed molecule Th4(DTPAB) with a triphenylamine–benzothiadiazole–triphenylamine unit as the core and 4-hexylthiophene as arms was synthesized. Solution-processed organic solar cells based on blends of Th4(DTPAB) and PC71BM demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of 3.18% with a high open circuit voltage of 0.96 V.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on blends of solution-processable small molecules and fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM) have attracted considerable attention in recent years because the small molecules have unique advantages, such as well-defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, and high purity without batch to batch variations in comparison with conjugated polymers.1 Tremendous progress has been made in this field2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.38% has been achieved from the OSCs based on a solution-processable linear small molecule and PC71BM.2d However, few soluble small molecules used as electron donors in OSCs demonstrated decent PCEs compared with their polymer counterparts and therefore more molecules need to be synthesized and evaluated in OSCs.
Compared with linear small molecules, star-shaped molecules with three dimensional (3D) structures have better miscibility with PCBM because the arms of these molecules can hold the fullerene balls.3 Owing to the noncoplanarity of the three phenyl substituents, triphenylamine (TPA) is widely used as a core for tri-armed molecules.4 Combining TPA with linear-conjugated systems, amorphous materials with isotropic optical and charge-transport properties could be obtained.5 Several TPA-based star-shaped molecules have been used as donors in solution-processed OSCs. The highest PCE of 4.4% was reported.6 The tri-armed star-shaped molecules have better miscibility with PCBM than the linear and bi-armed molecules.7 When a linear conjugated molecule containing two TPAs was used as a core instead of TPA, four-armed molecules could be attained with longer conjugated length.8 Besides, with four arms holding the fullerene balls, better miscibility with PCBM in BHJ OSCs can be expected. Two four-armed small molecules with strong polar groups have been reported by J. A. Mikroyannidis et al.8a However, a modified PCBM and 1-chloronaphthalene were needed to optimize the BHJ morphology due to the strong polar groups in the molecules.
Here we synthesized a novel four-armed triphenylamine molecule [Th4(DTPAB)] with triphenylamine (electron-donating)–benzothiadiazole (electron-accepting)–triphenylamine (electron-donating) unit as the core and 4-hexylthiophene as arms. As expected, the absorption spectrum of a Th4(DTPAB) molecule with donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure as the core is extended to lower energy regions compared with that of a star-shaped TPA molecule containing a similar arm structure due to its intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the D–A–D (TPA–Bz–TPA) structure core.9 Without a strong polar group in the structure, Th4(DTPAB) has good solubility in organic solvents and good miscibility with commercial PCBM to achieve optimum morphology in the active layer for BHJ OSCs, which is corroborated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. OSCs fabricated from Th4(DTPAB):PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:3 without thermal/solvent annealing and additives show a PCE of 3.18% and a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V. Moreover, a large driving force (∼0.65 eV) deduced from EL spectra indicates space for further improvement of the efficiency of the OSCs through tuning chemical structures of molecules.10
The synthetic route to the four-armed triphenylamine-based molecule is shown in Scheme 1. 4,7-Dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole was first coupled with 4-diphenylaminophenylstanne by a Stille reaction to afford 4,7-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, which was brominated with NBS to yield the compound 4,7-bis(4-(di(4-bromophenyl)amino)-phenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole [Br4(DTPAB)]. The compound Br4(DTPAB) was then coupled with 4-(hexyl-2-thienyl) stannane by a Stille reaction to obtain the final product Th4(DTPAB). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measured at 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen shows that this four-armed molecule has excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) at 380 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†).

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of Th4(DTPAB) in dilute chloroform (CF) solution (concentration 10−5 mol L−1), in the solid state and also the blend film of Th4(DTPAB):PC71BM in the weight ratio of 1:3 are plotted in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum of Th4(DTPAB) in dilute solution shows two absorption peaks (at 352 nm and 472 nm), which can be assigned to the π–π* absorption of the molecule and ICT from electron-donating units (thiophene and TPA) to the electron-accepting unit (benzothiadiazole).3a The molar absorption coefficient of Th4(DTPAB) calculated from Beer's law is 1.94 × 104 mol L−1 cm−1 at 472 nm. Compared with the absorption spectrum in solution, a redshift and a broader absorption spectrum in the solid state can be found, which indicates the existence of aggregation or π–π stacking of the molecules. The absorption onset for the film spin-coated from Th4(DTPAB) CF solution is located at ∼570 nm and thus the optical band gap is about 2.18 eV. Compared with that of the small molecule depicted in ref. 9, which has TPA as the core and thiophene as arms (λmax = 368 nm), λmax for the absorption of Th4(DTPAB) film is extended to 485 nm. This should be attributed to the ICT in the D–A–D (TPA–Bz–TPA) structure which extends the absorption towards longer wavelengths.3a,9 The absorption spectrum of the blend film shows an intense band at ca. 350 nm due to the absorption of PC71BM and the absorption band of Th4(DTPAB) at 352 nm. The second broad band at 475 nm is due to the ICT in Th4(DTPAB) and the optical contribution of PC71BM. The PL quenching measurements were performed on the pure Th4(DTPAB) and blend Th4(DTPAB):PC71BM films. The results are plotted in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of Th4(DTPAB) in chloroform solution, in solid state and its blend film with PC71BM in the ratio of 1:3, and their PL spectra in solid state. 
The two films were spin-coated from CF solutions on glass substrates. A green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and an intensity of 2 mW cm−2 was used as an excited source. It can be seen that a strong emission band around 900 nm from the blend film was not present in the emission spectrum of either pure Th4(DTPAB) or pure PC71BM, which thus should be assigned to the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states formed between Th4(DTPAB) and PC71BM. Completed PL quenching of Th4(DTPAB) in the blend film suggests that most excitons generated in donor phase reach the interface with PCBM within their lifetimes.
To estimate the HOMO level of Th4(DTPAB), cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed and the curve is plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The onset of the irreversible oxidation wave (Eox) is 0.92 V and that of the irreversible reduction wave is −0.88 V (Fig. S2, ESI†). The HOMO level was estimated as −5.32 eV from the onset oxidation potential according to an empirical formula [EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV)]11 and the LUMO level was estimated to be −3.52 eV from the onset reduction potential according to an empirical formula [ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) (eV)]. The electrochemical bandgap of Th4(DTPAB) is 1.80 eV. The HOMO level of Th4(DTPAB) is desirable for a higher Voc in OSCs. According to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (−5.85 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively) of PC71BM, a large driving force for exciton dissociation and charge generation can be expected.
The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/Th4(DTPAB):PC71BM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (80 nm) (Fig. S3, ESI†). The active areas of all OSCs are roughly 4.5 mm2 defined by the overlap between two electrodes, which were measured by optical microscopy. The weight ratio of the donor and acceptor was varied from 1:2.5, 1:3 to 1:3.5. The resulting thickness of the active layers is about 60 nm, which was obtained by a surface profiler (Dektak 6M). The OSCs fabricated using CF as solvent present superior device performance to those using o-dichlorobenzene. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs are presented in Fig. 2. Without annealing and other solvent additives, a promising device performance is achieved from the device with 1:3 blends, which shows a PCE of 3.18% and a large Voc of 0.96 V (Table 1). For all OSCs made with three different stoichiometries, the Voc values are the same. The high Voc (0.96 V) of the OSCs is consistent with the lower HOMO level (−5.32 eV) of Th4(DTPAB). The relatively low FF of 0.48, common for the amorphous small molecule donors, may be due to discontinuous paths for hole transport. With a weight ratio of 1:2.5, smaller Jsc and FF were obtained, which was attributed to the low hole mobility of the molecule. With a ratio of 1:3.5, the decreased FF indicates morphology change where the percolation pathways for charge carrier transport are disturbed with too much PC71BM.

In order to show the photo response of devices at different wavelengths, corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the OSCs was measured under the illumination of a monochromatic light source. For all of the blends, there is a broad photo response from 300 nm to 700 nm which is similar to the absorption spectrum of the blend (Fig. S4, ESI†). With the four-armed structure, the good solubility of Th4(DTPAB) and good miscibility with PC71BM were confirmed using the AFM image (Fig. 3), in which the 1:3 blend film processed from CF shows a very smooth surface with an RMS of only 0.3 nm. The EL spectra of devices made of blend and neat Th4(DTPAB) recorded under the same injection current and normalized at the peak position are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is obvious that the emission of pure Th4(DTPAB) at 624 nm almost vanished in the blend film, which also confirms good mixture of two materials and a large D–A interfacial area. In addition, a driving force of ∼0.65 eV can be deduced from EL measurements,10 which indicates a huge space for molecular modification.

In summary, a new four-armed Th4(DTPAB) molecule with a triphenylamine–benzothiadiazole–triphenylamine unit as the core and 4-hexylthiophene as arms was synthesized and evaluated in solution-processed OSCs. The four-armed Th4(DTPAB) with alternating electron-accepting and electron-donating units in the structure shows good miscibility and energy matching with PCBM. A PCE of 3.18% and a large Voc of 0.96 V are achieved with a conventional OSC structure without solvent additives and thermal annealing treatment.
