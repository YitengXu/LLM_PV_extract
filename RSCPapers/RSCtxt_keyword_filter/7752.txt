    , Accepted 7th April 2020First published on 8th April 2020AbstractA highly ordered nanoporous structure based MIS type photo-detector is a promising device for next-generation optoelectronic applications due to its excellent light absorption, better mechanical strength, low density with a larger diffusion coefficient and charge accommodation ability. Herein, we have fabricated a highly sensitive MIS Schottky barrier diode by sandwiching nanoporous:Sn–WO3 films as the interfacial layer prepared by a jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique. XRD patterns confirmed the polycrystalline nature with monoclinic and orthorhombic phases of Sn–WO3 films, whose crystallite size gradually increased with the Sn concentration. The FE-SEM images confirmed that the Sn–WO3 composite films with 12 wt% of Sn exhibited unique surface morphology of nanoplates, nanowires and nanoporous-like structures. The optical band gap energy improved from 3.2 to 3.6 eV with increased Sn concentration. By establishing the nanoporous structure of Sn–WO3, we are the first to report on the photo-diode properties of Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si diodes which recorded a positive photo-response with a higher reverse saturation current under illumination. This is supported by the enhanced detectivity of the interface layer with an increased Sn concentration. We have achieved an ultra-high responsivity of 5083.5 mA W−1 for the diode fabricated with 12 wt% of Sn, which is 154 times higher than that of pure WO3. The presence of a nanoporous:Sn–WO3 layer in the MIS diode helped in recording ∼60% quantum efficiency thereby making it ideal for ultra-violet photo-detector applications.
1. Introduction
Currently, the fabrication of metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) layer based electronic devices namely Schottky-diodes, photo-diodes and UV photo-detectors is becoming more popular, when compared with other types of layered devices. They are the essential components in the area of semiconductor devices and play an active role in discrete applications like radio-frequency generators, optical communication systems, smoke detectors, etc.1–3 In contrast, the MIS structure has a great impact on the Fermi level depinning, improved carrier mobilities at the interface, limiting the charge leakages and large enhancement of the device tunneling/current. Deep-rooted formation of the depletion region in the semiconductor of a MIS diode can provide an electric field for the separation of photo-generated charge carriers (electron–hole).4 The insertion of an ultra-thin interlayer in the MIS structure reduces the Schottky barrier height by inducing an interfacial dipole effect thereby reducing the specific contact resistivity of the device.5
Thin films with a unique surface morphology have received wide attention from the research community in the fabrication of advanced optoelectronic based applications.7,8 Indeed, the presence of novel surface structures like nano-sized porous, rods, belts, plates, flowers, wires, tubes and honeycombs arranged in-between the metal–semiconductor interface enhances the reverse saturation current, photo-responsivity and quantum efficiency of the diode.9–12 This behaviour is attributed to its superior surface to volume ratio, longer lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers, better electrical conduction at the M/S junction and quick light absorption. Particularly, the honeycomb/nonporous-like morphology is highly significant and unique as it provides better mechanical strength, accommodates more charge and has low density with a larger diffusion coefficient.6–8,11–14 Based on the synthesis fabrication technique, the hallmark features of the honeycomb-structure can be modified as it plays a major role in various modern technological applications such as solar cells, organic memory devices, light-emitting diodes and electrochromic devices.15–17 A honeycomb-like structure with a very well ordered film induces an interface dipole effect for homogeneous charge carrier extraction as well as separation with high optical absorbance.7,12,15
Certain morphologies of metal oxide can provide spacious channels in films and can facilitate the movement of charge or ions, which can improve the performance of the electronic device. Indeed, transition metal oxides (V2O5, WO3, Ta2O5, etc.) offer a number of diverse surface structures depending on their preparation procedures.18–20 Among them, tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a prospective material which can yield a variety of surface morphologies especially honeycomb.19 The TiO2/WO3-nanohoneycomb structure prepared by the sol–gel method can strongly enhance the photo-electrochemical behavior of both water splitting and hydrogen production due to its novel properties like lesser energy gap, huge surface area and improved charge separation.21 Honeycomb structures can control the ion insertion kinetics which will improve the charge transfer behavior and the porosity can enhance the gas sensor properties of the Schottky diode by intercalating the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules.22,23
It is worth mentioning that the oxygen vacancies could act as doubly ionized donors and also contribute at least a maximum of two electrons for the conductivity. Mukherjee et al.24 confirmed this behavior by adding Sn ions into the WO3 lattice effectively, which reduced the resistivity and improved the film conductivity owing to the increase in the oxygen vacancy and carrier concentration. Thus controlling the surface morphology of the materials is a big challenge in thin film technology as it is confined to the deposition process and methods. Moreover, the physical and chemical properties of the films like thickness, doping concentration, deposition-temperature/time and pressure do have a significant role to play in device formation. Thus the scientific world have probed different approaches to fabricate a nanoporous/honeycomb-like structure, such as spin coating, spray pyrolysis, sputtering, ete.,13,14,21 Among these methods, spray pyrolysis enables us to produce good quality films with a novel surface morphology by forming uniform-sized spray droplets. Specifically, the jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique (JNSP) has several advantages, which include less deposition time, uniform coating with large area coverage and low-cost.
In this study, we have incorporated Sn ions in a WO3 matrix. Through the JNSP technique, nanoporous and nanowire-like surface morphologies of Sn–WO3 films were formed. The films were analyzed for their structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties based on the Sn–WO3 composite films that were formed on the glass substrate with different concentrations of Sn (0, 4, 8 and 12 wt%). We fabricated Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si diodes, with the nanoporous:Sn–WO3 structure, by sandwiching them between the Cu and p-Si layers to enhance the performance of the MIS type Schottky diode. More importantly, the photo-detector parameters which include the ideality factor (n), barrier height (ΦB), saturation current (I0), photo-sensitivity (PS), responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and specific detectivity (D*) of the MIS diodes were calculated and interpreted based on the influence of nanoporous structures on the device performance. By establishing the nanoporous structure of Sn–WO3, we are the first to report on the photo-diode properties of Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si structured Schottky barrier diodes.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Pure WO3 and nanoporous:Sn–WO3 films preparation
Thin films of pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 were chemically deposited on a heated glass substrate using aqueous solutions of tungsten hexachloride and tin dichloride through a JNSP technique according to our previous work.25 The homogeneous spray solution was prepared with 0.2 mole of tungsten hexachloride and different wt% of tin dichloride (0, 4, 8, and 12) which is dissolved in 5 ml of ethanol separately and stirred continuously at room temperature for 1 hour using a magnetic stirrer.
Finally, the prepared homogeneous solution was effectively sprayed on the ultrasonically cleaned glass substrates (2 cm × 2 cm) at an optimized temperature of 400 °C with air as the carrier gas. This particular mole and temperature range have been chosen from the optimized results.26 The substrate temperature is controlled by using a PID thermometer which is also connected to a heater. The complete experimental setup and schematic illustration of the thin film growth process are shown in Fig. 1.

2.2 Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si Schottky barrier diode fabrication
The p-type silicon (p-Si) substrate with 279 μm thickness (±25 μm), (1 0 0) orientation and 60 Ω cm resistivity was employed as a semiconductor in the fabrication of MIS structured SBDs. The p-Si substrates with extra impurities like grease, metallic impurities, dust, and organic residues were cleaned using different acids. The key process of silicon substrate cleaning involves the following steps.27
(i) All the Si wafers were degreased for 10–15 min in boiling acetone and ethanol.
(ii) The organic residues were removed from the substrates using piranha solution by mixing sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4 + H2O2) in the ratio of 3:1.
(iii) Finally, the native oxide layer on the Si wafers was removed with the help of hydrofluoric (HF) acid diluted with water (H2O) in the ratio of 1:10.
(iv) Notably, all the wafers were completely rinsed with de-ionized water after each step.
The prepared WO3 and Sn–WO3 precursor solutions of 3 ml were deposited separately on the cleaned p-Si substrates (1 cm × 1 cm) by the JNSP technique with different concentrations of Sn (0, 4, 8 and 12 wt%) at an optimized substrate temperature of 400 °C. After deposition, the copper (Cu) metal contact was coated on the Sn–WO3/p-Si using dc sputtering (Model Name: HIND high vacuum-PS 2000) with 4 mm diameter and 500 nm thickness. The instrument details and deposition conditions of the metal contacts have been mentioned previously.25,26 Better contact is established with the silver paste, which is applied on both sides of the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si diode and was dried for 6 hours under ambient conditions.
2.3 Characterization techniques
The dual crystal structure of the Sn–WO3 composite thin films was studied using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Rigaku Miniflex-II) with a CuKα1 radiation source of wavelength 1.5418 Å. The surface morphology and composition of the Sn–WO3 films were analyzed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (Zeiss-Sigma, Model No. FEI quanta 250). The band gap energy of the films was obtained using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (JASCO) (Model No. V-770PC). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the Sn–WO3 composite films and MIS SBDs were measured by using a Keithley electrometer (Model No. 6517-B). Also, the dark current and photocurrent measurements of the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si diode were carried out using a portable solar simulator (Model No. PEC-L01).
3. Results and discussion
Pure WO3 and nanoporous:Sn–WO3 composite thin films were prepared with different Sn concentrations through the JNSP technique and were used as an interfacial layer in the MIS diode. The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the coated films were analyzed by XRD, FE-SEM, UV-Vis and I–V characterization. Highly sensitive Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si diodes were fabricated with different concentrations of Sn films as the interfacial layer. Moreover, various photo-detector parameters like n, ΦB, I0, PS, R and QE were calculated and discussed. Remarkably, the unique nanoporous:Sn–WO3 film when interfaced between Cu and p-Si strongly improved the photo-response of MIS type Schottky diodes.
3.1 Structural properties

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 composite thin films with different concentrations (0, 4, 8 and 12 wt%) of Sn. Notably, polycrystalline nature with dual-phases of monoclinic and orthorhombic was observed for pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 thin films. A well-defined triplet peak was recorded for the pure WO3 film at diffraction angles of 2θ (°) = 23.34, 23.85 and 24.56 and their corresponding h k l values are (0 0 2), (0 2 0) and (2 0 0). This indicates the monoclinic (γ-WO3) phase and is in accordance with standard JCPDS card no. 83-0950.28 The growth of the (2 0 0) plane was much better relative to that of (0 0 2) and (0 2 0) planes as shown in for the pure film. Moreover, the triplet peak intensities (002), (020) and (200) of pure WO3 are suppressed without any change in its phase due to the addition of higher wt% of Sn. This is supported by the emergence of additional peaks in the directions of (133), (351), (410) and (081) indicating the formation of a new crystalline phase of SnWO4 (Orthorhombic). Interestingly, the Sn–WO3 composite film coated with 8 wt% of Sn exhibits a peak shift along the lower angle side. This may be attributed to the difference in the atomic radius of the guest and host atoms along with the variations of lattice parameters of the films.28
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD pattern and (b) variations of the texture coefficient for pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 films with different concentrations of Sn. 
The most preferential growth occurred along the (1 3 3) and (0 8 2) directions when increasing the Sn concentration from 0 to 12 wt% (JCPDS card no. 29-1354). Besides, the growth of the (3 5 1) and (4 1 0) planes was found to increase gradually with Sn concentration. These results indicate that Sn atoms are strongly present in the WO3 lattice. Thus, the Sn–WO3 composite films are polycrystalline in nature and consist of the orthorhombic crystal structure (α-SnWO4). Furthermore, some additional peaks (SnO and SnO2) are spotted in Sn–WO3 films, which are marked with an @ symbol (Fig. 2a) and they are in good agreement with JCPDS cards No's. 72-2324 and 78-1063. The crystallite size (D) of the films was calculated by the Debye–Scherrer equation.29 The average crystallite size (DA) was found to increase linearly, whose corresponding FWHM dwindled with increasing Sn concentration. The Sn–WO3 films deposited with 12 wt% of Sn recorded a maximum average crystallite size (DA) of 50.8 nm. Apparently, the incorporation of Sn atoms in WO3 improved the crystallite size of the films, which could enhance the electrical conductivity of the films and charge transport properties of the MIS SBDs.
The calculated structural parameters of (0 0 2), (0 2 0) and (2 0 0) planes are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The mean values of dislocation density (δ), micro-strain (ε) and stacking fault (SF) were found to decrease continuously on increasing the Sn concentration from 0 to 12 wt% (Fig. S1, ESI†). A minimum average value of δ, ε and SF was obtained for the film deposited with 12 wt% of Sn. This leads to the improved crystallinity and stoichiometry of the sample, which in turn facilitate the volumetric expansion of the films. Mariappan et al. observed a similar behaviour for Cd doped SnO2 thin films.29
The texture coefficient (TC) is an essential parameter to analyze the diffraction peaks of the films. The TC values indicate the structural information, development of the peak and orientation of the plane. TC > 1 suggests the preferential growth of the films and the 0 < TC < 1 condition implies the lack of grain orientation in a particular direction. From Fig. 5 it is evident that the calculated TC values are higher for the (1 3 3) plane and are varied from 4.46 to 3.40 with Sn concentrations as shown in Fig. 2b. Thus, these planes have the most favorable preferential growth compared to others. Our XRD results demonstrated that the incorporation of Sn atoms has a stronger influence on the structural parameters of Sn–WO3 composite films.
3.2 Surface morphology

Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 composite films deposited at an optimized substrate temperature of 400 °C for various concentrations of Sn. Inter-connected larger grains with a randomly arranged structure were observed for the pure WO3 films. Remarkably, the incorporation of Sn atoms exhibits a randomly oriented nanoporous-like surface morphology on the composite films deposited with 4 and 8 wt% of Sn. The diameter of the nanoporous structure varied between ∼50 and 200 nm. The open submicron nanoporous structure can increase the rate of ion and electron diffusion in the films.30

The vertically porous-like structures will act as good light harvesters, allowing light photons to penetrate deeply into the thin layers by the scattering effect.31 This might enhance the quantum efficiency of the detector. Moreover, a porous structure with a large surface area will provide higher charge transport/separation, which will enhance the power conversion efficiency of the device. Interestingly, the 12 wt% of Sn–WO3 composite films show different structures with surface morphologies like nanoplates, nanowires and also nanoporous. We believe that the presence of tin dichloride and the impact of spherical droplets on the heated substrate might have facilitated the unique morphology. The nanoporous structure can have a higher charge accommodation ability, which will increase the density of the charge carriers and diode performance.13
3.3 Composition analysis
The EDX spectrum of jet nebulizer sprayed pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 films with different Sn concentrations of (0, 4, 8 and 12 wt%) is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results confirm the presence of expected elements such as W, Sn and O. In addition, all the films have good stoichiometric properties. Table S2 (ESI†) shows the atomic percentage of Sn–WO3 thin films. Obviously, the atomic % of Sn was found to increase and the corresponding W reduced considerably for 12 wt% of Sn. This indicates the strong incorporation of Sn in the host WO3, which is in good accordance with our XRD and FE-SEM results. Moreover, the oxygen content is almost stable after incorporating the Sn.
3.4 UV-visible spectroscopy
The optical parameters of the pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 composite films were studied using UV-Vis spectra in the wavelength range from 275 to 800 nm and are shown in Table 1. The optical absorbance spectrum of the Sn–WO3 thin films for different Sn concentrations is shown in Fig. 4a. The absorbance of all the films was found to increase (UV region) sharply with increasing wavelength up to 282 nm (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the absorption reduced slowly for all the concentrations of Sn and finally became almost constant in the visible region. All these films exhibit a sharp absorption edge of wavelength between 250 and 285 nm. Compared to pure WO3, the Sn–WO3 films showed a huge variation in the optical absorbance, especially with 8 wt%. These changes in the optical absorbance might be due to the deviation in the density of localized states in the band gap. This could be the impact caused by higher concentrations of Sn, inducing the changes in the density of unsaturated bonds.32 Moreover, the transformation of the pure film (Inter-connected network grains) to the nanoporous structure with 8 wt% of Sn concentration might have facilitated for the variation in the optical absorbance. Indeed, a thin film with better absorbance can enhance the performance of the MIS diode as a result of a higher amount of photo-generated charge carriers.

 Fig. 4  (a) Absorption spectrum and (b) plot of (αhν)1/2vs. (hν) for pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 films with different concentrations of Sn. 
The Eg values of the coated films were deduced from Tauc plots ((αhν)1/2vs. hv) by extrapolating the vertical straight line.33 The variations of Eg with Sn concentration are shown in Fig. 4b, in which the pure WO3 film recorded a value of 3.2 eV. Besides, the incorporation of Sn atoms into the WO3 lattice increased the Eg values to 3.6 eV (Table 1). Here, Sn atoms might offer an additional carrier inducing a shift in the Fermi level towards the conduction band, resulting in the enhanced Eg values of the Sn–WO3 composite films. Moreover, the absorption edge facilitates the improved Eg according to the Moss–Burstein effect.34 The improvement in the crystallite size (Fig. S1, ESI†) and variations in the surface morphology at higher concentrations of the Sn–WO3 nanostructured films are some of the possible reasons for the variation of the band gap. The ionic size of the dopant (Sn4+) is 0.71 Å nm which is relatively higher than that of W6+ (0.60 Å).35,36 A similar variation of band gap was observed for WO3 films when the doping concentrations of Tb3+ (0.92 Å) and In (0.94 Å) are increased.37,38
The changes of α, k, Eg, σopt and n values with different Sn concentrations are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is obvious from Fig. S3 (ESI†) that α and k values were found to decrease with the increase in Sn concentration up to 8 wt% and then they show slight improvement for 12 wt% of Sn–WO3 composite films which is due to the crystallographic defects like grain boundaries and porous nature of the films.39 Also, the optical scattering and losses might affect the extinction coefficient (k) of the films. The k values may help in the identification of the absorption level of photons for all the semiconductor materials for the given wavelength. The optical conductivity of all these films was determined using their corresponding absorption edge (i.e. 280 m). The estimated optical conductivity of the Sn–WO3 films varied between 1.42 and 5.83 × 1014 S cm−1. The variations in the optical conductivity are mainly attributed to the reduction of interband transition channels among the bulk states (i.e. conduction band and valence band) and also reduced film thickness.
The refractive index (n) of our composite films follows the inverse trend of the energy band gap. From Table 1, we observe a steady decrease in the n value for the Sn–WO3 composite films, when the Sn concentration is increased from 0 to 12 wt%. However, the pure WO3 recorded the maximum refractive index n = 3.42 due to the increased optical density and lower k value. Composite films with a lower refractive index can enhance the light propagation in the material which will intensify the photo-generated charge carriers. UV-Vis analysis confirmed that the strongly incorporated Sn atoms enhanced the energy band gap of the Sn–WO3 films so as to act as an insulating layer in MIS diodes according to our expectation.
3.5 Electrical conductivity

Fig. 5a shows the temperature-dependent I–V characteristics of pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 composite films for different Sn concentrations (4, 8 and 12 wt%). The current values were measured as a function of temperature (30–170 °C) by applying constant voltage ranging from 10 to 100 V (step of 10 V). All the films reveal a better response with temperature and voltage. Particularly higher current values are obtained at 170 °C than at other temperatures, which is evident from Fig. 5a. Pure WO3 films showed a ρ of 3.0 × 1014 Ω cm, which was found to decrease linearly (ρ = 9.7 × 1012 Ω cm) while adding Sn into the WO3 matrix. This is attributed to the increase in the crystallite size of the Sn–WO3 composite films. In fact, the grain boundaries and the crystal lattice deficiency of the films were reduced along with the increased doping concentration of Sn and measuring temperature. This would considerably reduce the ρ of the film and improve the mobility of the charge carriers in it. Interestingly, a similar trend was observed by Mukherjee et al.24
 Fig. 5  (a) I–V characteristics and (b) Arrhenius plot of 1/T vs. ln(σ) of pure WO3 and Sn–WO3 films for different concentrations of Sn. 
The electrical conductivity of the coated films was calculated using the conventional equation σdc = t/RA (S cm−1), where R is the resistance, t is the thickness, and A is the area of the film.33 We found that on increasing the Sn concentration from 0 to 12 wt%, the experimental electrical conductivity of the Sn–WO3 composite films improved linearly. The composite film with 12 wt% of Sn recorded a maximum conductivity of σdc = 1.3 × 10−13 S cm−1 (Table 2). This is due to the decrease in the scattering along the grain-boundary and increase in the oxygen vacancies of the Sn–WO3 films.24 In addition, the incorporated Sn ions/atoms might increase the rate of volume required for ionic carriers to drift in the host WO3. This can improve the ionic mobility in the composite films to have enhanced conductivity.40 Interestingly, this behavior is well supported by the fact that the increasing crystallinity of the films can evidently decrease the charge transfer resistance during the double injection or ejection of ions and electrons, leading to an enhanced electrical conductivity.22 Moreover, a film with larger pores will have a good bonded structure, which can have an impact on the recorded values as per the studies by Zhu Ke and Cuevas et al.41,42 The obtained conductivity (10−13–10−15 S cm−1) suggested a nearly insulating nature of the Sn–WO3 films. Indeed, all our coated films will be ideal and suitable to act as an insulating layer in MIS type SBDs to improve their performance.43

Fig. 5b exhibits the Arrhenius plot of 1/T (K)−1vs. ln(σ) for Sn–WO3 films. It is clearly seen from the Arrhenius plot that the calculated ln(σ) values of all films seem to increase slowly with 1/T (K)−1. Improved ln(σ) at higher temperature is a fact that the independent charge carriers might hop from one localized state to another state due to the increase in their free volume and segmental mobility at suitable temperature.44 Activation energy is the most important factor to analyze the electrical properties of the Sn–WO3 films. Herein, the calculated activation energy is found to decrease slowly on increasing the Sn concentration from 0 to 12 wt% as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
Compared to other films, the 12 wt% recorded the minimum activation energy of Ea = 0.041 eV. As the guest atoms (Sn) are incorporated into the host WO3, a redistribution of energy levels especially with respect to the Fermi level takes place, which in turn decides the activation energy and conductivity. Notably, Nguyen Minh Vuong and Patil et al. also revealed a similar behaviour of decreasing activation energy after doping Au and Ti atoms with the parent WO3.45,46 Moreover, the Vogel–Tamman–Fulcher and Mott's three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism can explain the non-Arrhenius behaviour.47,48 From the conductivity results, we conclude that the nanoporous:Sn–WO3 films are highly appropriate for the interfacial layer in MIS diodes to improve the device performance.
3.6 Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si (MIS) type Schottky barrier diodes
The current–voltage (I–V) measurement under dark and light conditions explores the photodetector properties and performance of the fabricated device. Fig. 6a displays the I–V characteristics of the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si SBDs measured under dark and light conditions with different concentrations of Sn (0, 4, 8 and 12 wt%) based insulating layer. The forward and reverse current values of the MIS diode were measured by applying a constant bias voltage ranging from +4 V to −4 V with a Keithley electrometer. The measuring parameters of the fabricated MIS SBDs under dark and light conditions using a portable solar simulator (PEC-L01) have been reported in our previous work.25 The diode measured under light conditions exhibits higher current values than under the dark conditions (Fig. 6a). This behaviour outcome indicates that all the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si diodes are highly photo-conducting in nature. In particular, the diode fabricated with 12 wt% of Sn shows higher current values (mA level) when compared to other diodes (Fig. 6a).
 Fig. 6  (a) I–V characteristics and (b) semi-logarithmic plot of ln(J) vs. V for Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si SBDs fabricated with different concentrations of Sn. 
The reverse saturation current (I0) was calculated under dark (D) and light (Ph) conditions for the pure MIS diode which was found to be ID = 2.8 × 10−9 A and IPh = 2.06 × 10−8 A respectively. Remarkably, the MIS diode fabricated with 12 wt% of Sn revealed an improved ID = 3.31 × 10−4 A and IPh = 8.94 × 10−4 A values. This is due to the presence of the nanoporous structure at the M/S interface which offers more channels for charge transportation with a larger surface area for charge transfer. Also, the Sn–WO3 layer can reduce the ID as a result of large photon absorption compared to the semiconductor surface. We presume that the incorporation of Sn atoms in the WO3 matrix has effectively improved the photocurrent of the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si diodes. Table 3 shows the calculated photodetector parameters like n, ΦB, I0, PS, R, QE and D* of the MIS type SBDs for various Sn concentrations.

The semi-logarithmic plot of the MIS diode is shown in Fig. 6b. The ideality factor (n) of the diodes was found to reduce steeply under dark conditions on increasing the Sn concentration from 0 to 12 wt% (Table 3). Compared to the dark conditions, the diodes measured under light conditions revealed lower n values. This is mainly due to the increase in the photo-generated charge carriers (e−−h+) along with the improved conversion efficiency of the semiconductor layer and absorption of interfacial layer.32 However, the 4 wt% MIS diode shows a higher ideality factor of n = 4.03 under light conditions compared to that under dark conditions. This may be ascribed to the generation of a smaller amount of e−−h+ pairs and their recombination. The MIS SBDs fabricated with 12 wt% of Sn obtained a lower ideality factor (n = 2.35) in particular under light conditions. Generally, the deviation of the ideality factor from the ideal value is because of the presence of a large number of trapping states. Also, a higher n value is sometimes observed in the hetero-structures of two different materials due to the large lattice mismatch.49–52
The estimated barrier height (ΦB) was found to vary from 0.62 to 0.69 eV with Sn concentration. In fact, the potential variation across the thin interfacial layer and the effect of interface states with applied voltage are the main reasons for the changes in the barrier height (ΦB) of the diode, which has been analyzed by Turut et al.53 A Schottky diode with lower barrier height will improve the quantum efficiency of the photo-detector as per studies by Joshua Duran et al.54 The maximum quantum efficiency was recorded for a lower barrier height. This trend is in good agreement with our case (Table 3). The energy band diagram of the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si type diode is shown in Fig. 7a.

The variations of photodetector parameters with Sn concentration are shown in Fig. 7b. The estimated value of Ps was found to vary from 83.04 to 960.95% with Sn concentration as shown in Table 3. We demonstrated that all diodes are very sensitive to both light and impurity concentration. The photosensitivity of the diode is mainly due to the intensity of incident light and the absorption rate of the interfacial layer, which is in accordance with our optical parameters (Table 1). The ratio of the generated photocurrent and incident optical power is measured in terms of photoresponsivity (R) of the diode. We observed an expeditious variation in R of the diode when the interfacial layer is varied between 0 and 12 wt% Sn concentrations. Most importantly, the 12 wt% of Sn based MIS diode recorded a very high responsivity of Rs = 5083.5 mA W−1 which is due to the deep penetration of light in the nanoporous channels facilitated by the effect of scattering. Notably, the obtained responsivity is much higher than that reported by Shuang Qiao et al.55 The increment of responsivity might be attributed to the relaxation of stress and reduction of surface pit density in the porous sample.56
The study of quantum efficiency (QE) and specific detectivity (D*) of the MIS diode is very useful for connecting the present Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si structured diode with an ultra-violet (UV) photo-detector. Compared to lower concentrations, the MIS diode fabricated with 8 and 12 wt% of Sn disclosed better quantum efficiency and higher detectivity. Especially, 12 wt% of Sn recorded a very high QE and D* of 1971.1% and 12.089 × 1010 Jones, respectively. Interestingly, we have achieved a higher detectivity value than that reported by Ouyang et al. (3.7 × 107 Jones) and Lim et al. (1.38 × 107 Jones).57,58 In general, the quantum efficiency of the diode mostly depends on the photon absorption coefficient of the device. Compared to other types of structures (MS, MOS and MIM), the MIS structure has a depletion region very closer to the surface and is one of the reasons for exhibiting higher quantum efficiency. The larger detectivity values imply a less noise level of the fabricated diodes.59 From the Cu/Sn–WO3/p-Si diode results, we observed that the presence of nanoporous-like structured Sn–WO3 films in between the metal and semiconductor interface strongly enhanced the photo-diode parameters, particularly, the MIS diode fabricated with 12 wt%, which suggests that the nanoporous structure has promising potential for MIS type diode applications.
4. Conclusion
Nanostructured WO3 and nanoporous:Sn–WO3 films have been successfully deposited with different Sn concentrations by a low-cost spray technique at an optimized temperature of 400 °C. The dual-phase (monoclinic and orthorhombic) nature of the Sn–WO3 films was confirmed from the XRD patterns. The composite film deposited with 12 wt% of Sn recorded a maximum average crystallite size (DA) of 50.8 nm and exhibited a variety of surface structures like nanoplates, nanowires and nanoporous. A maximum optical Eg of 3.6 eV was obtained for a higher concentration of Sn. The measured electrical conductivity was found to be improved from 10−15 to 10−13 S cm−1. Also, the Sn–WO3 film with 12 wt% of Sn showed a minimum activation energy Ea of 0.041 eV and a resistivity of ρ = 9.7 × 1012 Ω cm. The nanoporous:Sn–WO3 films were employed as a charge transfer layer, which can also harvest more photons. This enhanced the performance of Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si diode. Remarkably, a lower ideality factor of n = 2.35 was obtained for the Cu/nanoporous:Sn–WO3/p-Si diode measured under light conditions. Most importantly, the diode fabricated with 12 wt% of nanoporous:Sn–WO3 film achieved a very high detectivity of 12.089 × 1010 Jones with a quantum efficiency of 1971.1%. Our results proved that the nanoporous:Sn–WO3 film is an ideal interfacial layer for the MIS diode, making it suitable for UV photo-detector applications.
