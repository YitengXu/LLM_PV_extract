    , Accepted 16th April 2008First published on 24th April 2008AbstractA facile approach to improve the output power of a dye-sensitized solar cell by more than 5 times has been developed by an optimum wavelength-selective photonic crystal concentrator.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on titania have been extensively studied due to their great potential for cost-effective photovoltaic devices.1 Most attention has been paid to improving the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency by modifying the cell's intrinsic structure2 and using new materials.3 Despite the remarkable research achievement of a DSSC with high efficiency of 11.18%4 (with a cell area of 0.2 cm2), the efficiency drops sharply as the cell area increases. The problem can be solved by using concentrators, which can retain the high efficiency of cells and produce more output power. For example, Faiman et al. used reflectors to concentrate light 1000 times or more onto a cell, and made best use of the intrinsic cell performance and greatly reduced the cost of the cell.5 However, conventional concentrating systems are not suitable for DSSCs, since the cell cannot endure the heat produced from the concentrated infrared (IR) light, and the concentrated ultraviolet (UV) light would simultaneously increase the recombination of electron–hole pairs and accelerate dye degradation upon titania.6 Recently, a research team at the University of Delaware7 set record for solar cell efficiency with a value of 42.8% by a novel light-splitting technique, which provided a constructive inspiration to improve the performance of DSSCs. In this communication, we report the development of a novel concentrator with wavelength selectivity via photonic crystals (PCs). The as-prepared PC concentrators could effectively improve the output power of the DSSC by more than 5 times by converging the desired light (i.e., the absorbance of the dye) and filtering out harmful IR and UV light, which demonstrated a promising strategy to promote the DSSC practical application.
A PC can selectively modify the propagation of light with a specific wavelength based on its intrinsic periodic structure.8 Various photonic devices have been fabricated based on PC structures and light manipulation properties,9–11 such as a light waveguide that causes light to curve at acute angles,9 dielectric mirrors10 and so on. In recent years, scientists have coupled PC structures into DSSCs and investigated the influence on cell performance.12–15 Typically, Mallouk et al. pioneered the coupling of a TiO2 PC layer into a TiO2 photo-electrode, which brought about an enhancement of light harvesting efficiency due to the light localization properties of the PC.12 Miguez's group carried out a series of theoretical and experimental studies to illustrate the light-harvesting enhancement of PCs on a DSSC.13 Huisman et al.14 replaced the conventional TiO2 photo-anode by its inverse opal. However, the procedure gave rise to an obvious drop of the cell efficiency due to difficulty of fabricating a PC anode with large area. Herein, a facile approach was demonstrated for highly efficient output of DSSC with a PC concentrator. The PC concentrator was developed by combining the advantages of light-focusing by a concave mirror and wavelength-selective filtration of PC.

Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic illustration of the photovoltaic system containing a PC concentrator. The PC concentrator was used as a light-harvesting module, it could concentrate light for the DSSC to generate electricity. The light corresponding to the absorbance of N719 dye can be converged when the stopband of the PC concentrator just overlaps the absorbance of the dye, and the IR and UV light could be filtered out simultaneously.

(b) Typical photographs of the PC concentrators with different colours, the stopbands of the PC concentrators from left to right are 448, 475, 530 and 647 nm, respectively. The scale bar is 2 cm. 
The PC concentrators were fabricated by self-assembly of latex spheres on concave watch glasses based on the vertical deposition method. Here, a suitable angle between normal direction of the concave surface and the gravity direction was necessary to reduce the gravity effect on the assembly and to ensure the well-ordered assembly of the latex spheres upon the concave glass surface (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). The latex spheres were synthesized based on our previous method.16,17 The specific morphology, with a hydrophobic PSt core and a hydrophilic PMMA–PAA shell, was favourable for the formation of strong hydrogen bonding interactions among latex spheres,16 which contributed to the homogeneous PC with large dimensions in Fig. 1(b).

Fig. 1(b) shows photographs of the as-prepared PC concentrators assembled from latex spheres with diameters of 173, 191, 216 and 280 nm, respectively, which show homogeneous violet, blue, green and red colours, respectively. It can be seen that the PCs displayed good optical properties, which can be attributed to the well ordered structures (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The UV-vis spectra of the as-prepared PC concentrators are presented in Fig. 2(a). The PCs exhibited stop bands of 448, 475, 530 and 647 nm, respectively. Additionally, Fig. 2(a) also shows the absorbance spectrum of N719 dye18 with the maximum absorbance (λmax) of 550 nm (black line), which just overlaps the PC concentrator with the stopband of 530 nm. Fig. 2(b) shows the relative irradiance at the focal point of the PC concentrator. The wavelength range, amplitude and position of the dip are very similar to the stopbands of the corresponding PC concentrators.

(b) The relative irradiance at the focal point of the PC concentrators. (c) The I–V characteristics of the DSSC under various conditions: 1) control sample, which was directly exposed to the solar simulator, 2), 3), 4) and 5) the lights were focused by PC concentrators with stopbands of 647, 448, 475 and 530 nm, respectively. (d) The Pmax calculated from the I–V curves in (c). 

Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the corresponding I–V characteristics of the DSSC under various testing conditions (also see Table S1 in ESI†). The maximum output power, Pmax, is an important index to evaluate the output performance of the DSSC. As expected, when keeping the same solar simulator (with same light intensity) and DSSC, Pmax varied from 4.79, 7.37, 5.33 to 11.4 mW cm−2, when using the PC concentrators with stopbands of 647, 448, 475 and 530 nm respectively. That is, Pmax displayed 2–5 times increase compared with the control sample (2.09 mW cm−2). The biggest enhancement reached more than 5 times when using the concentrator with a stopband of 530 nm. It can be expected that an even greater enhancement will be achieved by increasing the concentrated area and broadening the reflection spectrum of the PC concentrator. The dependence of the Pmax on the stopband of the PC concentrators mainly arose from the overlap degree of the stopband with the absorbance of N719, i.e., the light, which was converged by the PC concentrator with the stopband of 530 nm (see green curve in Fig. 2(b)), just overlapped with the absorbance of N719 and could be absorbed fully by the N719 dye, which contributed to the biggest enhancement of Pmax in Fig. 2(d). In contrast, the enhancement of Pmax would decrease when the stopbands depart from the absorbance of N719. This decrease was mainly due to the fact that the converging light could only be partially utilized. Thus, the smallest output value from the PC concentrator with the stopband of 644 nm was obtained due to a minimum overlap between the stopband of PC and the absorbance of N719.
As stated above, the highest output power was achieved when the stopband of the PC concentrator completely overlapped with the absorbance of N719. Interestingly, an obvious enhancement of output power was also observed even when the stopband did not correspond with the absorbance of N719. The reason could be attributed to the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve of DSSC at different light wavelengths (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5) in Fig. 3(a). High IPCE performance (>70%) was observed in the range from 400 to 640 nm, although the wavelength range was not fully consistent with the absorbance of N719. As the light wavelength converged by the PC concentrators falls over the high IPCE performance range, the light-to-electricity behaviour of the DSSC under various PC concentrators coincides with the IPCE behaviour of the DSSC under the corresponding wavelengths. That is, the enhanced light-to-electricity behaviour of the DSSC (Fig. 3(c), (d)) occurs as though the stopbands of the PC concentrators did not coincide with the absorbance of N719.

Comparison of the output power of DSSC in the presence or absence of PC concentrators is demonstrated vividly in the ESI movie.† At the very beginning, the electric fan could not move due to insufficient electric energy produced from the DSSC. In contrast, the electric fan started to rotate quickly under the same conditions except using the PC concentrator. The experimental phenomenon further confirms that the application of a PC concentrator can effectively promote the generation of more output electricity for the same DSSC.
Further experiments were carried out to compare the stability of the DSSC when continuously working under a PC or Al film concentrator. Fig. 4 presents the experimental results when the DSSC was kept working under various concentrators for more than 11 h. Generally, a rapid decrease of I–V characteristics with increasing irradiation time could be clearly observed when concentrated by concave Al film, which indicated that the application of an Al film concentrator would accelerate dye degradation. In contrast, the data remained stable when using the PC concentrator, which implied that the PC concentrator could effectively prevent the dye from degrading and promote the efficient output of the DSSC. Typically, a rapid decrease of Pmax for DSSC with increasing irradiation time could be clearly observed when using Al film concentrator (see Fig. 4(b)), while the value under the PC concentrator showed more stable performance. Thus, a crossing point (1598.2 min, 4.067 mW cm−2) of the two curves was deduced as shown in Fig. 4(b), which indicated that the Pmax of the DSSC under the PC concentrator would exceed that under the Al film concentrator in 1598 min (about 26.77 h). This different stability of the DSSC could be attributed to the dye degradation resulting from concentrated UV or IR when using the Al film concentrator.6 The light wavelength converged by the PC concentrator accorded with its stopband, indicating the corroborative filtration of UV and IR light. Thus, the use of the PC concentrator was beneficial for the stable performance of the DSSC.

In conclusion, a wavelength selective PC concentrator for DSSC has been developed for the first time. The PC concentrator can selectively converge the useful light, i.e., the absorbance of dyes for DSSC, and filter out the unnecessary light, such as UV and IR.19 The application of the PC concentrator could effectively improve the Pmax of the DSSC by more than 5 times, and retain the stable high performance of the DSSC. This approach demonstrates a promising strategy to efficiently improve the output of DSSCs, and would be of great significance for DSSC applications and solar energy exploitation.
