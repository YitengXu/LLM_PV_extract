Herein, we propose an analytical method for SiNWs under different interface confinements in terms of the atomic-bond-relaxation correlation mechanism and continuum medium mechanics. Moreover, an analytical expression for the relationship between carrier mobility and bond identities is derived and the results are validated with the related experimental measurements. It is found that the size reduction of SiNWs can not only increase the energy bandgap, but also enhance the phonon and surface roughness scattering, thereby allowing for the depression of carrier mobility. Moreover, the underlying mechanism regarding the temperature dependent-carrier mobility in SiNWs with different orientations embedded within Ge coating layers is clarified, which provides a pathway to modulate the transport properties in Si-based nanostructures for desirable applications.
1. Introduction
Si nanowires (SiNWs) have recently drawn significant attraction as candidates for the high performance photoelectrochemistry, field effect transistors, and photovoltaic devices due to their excellent electrostatic control and transport properties.1,2 To date, many significant studies both experimentally and theoretically have shown that the improvement of related optoelectronic properties will appear in the Si-based nanostructures, but the power conversion efficiency of single SiNW solar cells is still low due to the depression of carrier transport properties induced by the surface scattering effect and the high ratio of surface-to-volume (SVR).3–8 Therefore, how to enhance the carrier mobility of the SiNWs becomes an important challenge, which can provide a real possibility for improving the performance of photovoltaics. Fonoberov et al.9 and Dhungana et al.,10 respectively, reported that the mobilities in Si/diamond and Si/Ge core/shell NWs are about a factor of 2 and 5 higher at room temperature than that of bare SiNWs, which suggests that the mobility enhancement is accompanied by an extra benefit of improved thermal management and field effect transistor performance. Moreover, some theoretical attempts, such as nonequilibrium Green's function, atomistic simulations and quantum transport approaches, have been made to pursue the mechanism of the enhancement of mobility.11–14
In general, shrinking the size of nanostructures down to the nanoscale, on the one hand, can improve the phonon and surface roughness scattering, resulting in the decrease of carrier mobility.5,15 On the other hand, according to the atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) correlation mechanism,16,17 low-dimensional nanostructures can leave large numbers of dangling bonds, leading to a self-equilibrium state and inducing the appearance of lattice strain, which can make electronic properties deviate from the bulk case and thereby allowing for changing the carrier mobility. These two factors can be a great way to explain the decrease of the electron mobility, but it is not enough to describe the transport properties of hole mobility due to the influence of the subband as the diameter reduces.13,18–20 Moreover, the effects of the epitaxial layer play a crucial role in the transport properties as well, which can greatly suppress the surface effect, phonon scattering, and surface roughness scattering, leading to the carrier mobility enhancement.9,21–23 Even more than that, the epitaxial layer can participate in the carrier transport and provide a strong molecular acceptor, resulting in the remarkable reducing carrier recombination and the enhancement of mobility, as well as consequently improving the performance of the photovoltaic.10,24 In addition, some research studies also revealed that the orientation of NWs and the imposed temperature play a significant role in the carrier mobility. In fact, the thermal effect can change not only the efficiency of scattering with acoustic phonons in the more dispersive electronic band, but also the gap in the phonon density of states between the mixed states of acoustic and optical phonons and the optical phonon modes,3,25,26 while the orientation of NWs relates to the band structures, scattering rate between the carrier and the phonon, effective mass as well as the inter-valley splitting.7,27,28
Although a number of investigations have been carried out to elucidate the electronic and transport properties of semiconductor nanowires, the performance of mobility is still a deviation from the expected achievements. Generally, two inevitable issues urgently need to be solved: one is the reason for the discrepancy in mobility between the electron and the hole, the other is the physical mechanism regarding the surface, interface and thermal effects caused by the size, shell, orientation and temperature. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose an analytical model to explore the interface confinement that involves the size, orientation and imposed temperature of the band offset and related carrier mobility in Si/Ge core–shell NWs. Our theoretical method provides a useful way for gaining insight into the transport properties of Si-based nanostructures.
2. Principle
In fact, when reducing the size of the system to a few nanometers, the surface atoms will play an important role in the physical and chemical properties. Because of less-coordinated numbers of surface layers in low-dimensional systems, the bond would be shorter and stronger.16 Therefore, the nanosystem will be in the self-equilibrium state and the lattice strain will take place. In our case, the lattice strain can be expressed by ε = d*/d − 1, where d* and d, respectively, denote the average bond length and that of the bulk. Considering the discrepancy between the surface and the core interior, the strain of NWs can be expressed as: , where z[hkl]i and zb are the coordination numbers (CNs) of the specific ith atomic layer for the [hkl] orientation and that of the bulk, ns is the number of surface shells,  is the SVR for the [hkl] orientation of NWs, c[hkl]i = 2/(1 + exp((12 − z[hkl]i)/8z[hkl]i)) is the bond contraction coefficient for the [hkl] orientation, and D denotes the diameter of a NW.
In addition, considering a NW coated with an epitaxial layer, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the mismatch strain at the interface will arise due to the discrepancies of lattice constants between the shell and the core interior, resulting in the energy and band structure differing from those of the bulk case.29,30 In our case, the strain induced by the interface effect can be written as: εm = (as − ac)/ac, where as and ac are, respectively, the lattice constants of the shell and core parts. According to the continuum mechanics,31 the mean strain is (1)heref = (vp + 1)/[(1 − k)(1 − 2vp)rc2 − (1 − 2vp + k)rs2], G = vp/[(rs2 − rc2) + krc2], k = Yc/Ys, and vp = (vc + vs)/2, where Yc(Ys) and vc(vs) are the bulk Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the core (shell); the radial, tangential and axial directions are denoted by r, θ and z; rc = D/2 and rs = D/2 + ht represent the core and shell radii; and ht is the shell thickness.
 Fig. 1  Dependence of a relative change of bandgap on size and Ge coating layers for Si NWs. The inset shows the schematic illustration of Si/Ge core/shell NWs. The formation enthalpy of an interfacial bond is obtained from ref. 57, Ec−s = 1.71 eV. 
Taking the joint effect of the surface relaxation and interface mismatch into consideration, the cohesive energy of a NW under a given temperature T can be obtained as follows, (2)withEsi = Ei + ΔEiT, EB = Eb + ΔET, Eξ = Sh0Y〈εξ〉|〈εξ〉|/2(1 − v)and  
It should be noted that the first term in the right-hand side of eqn (2) is the chemical energy, and the last part indicates the strain energy. Ni(N), zi(zb) and Ei(Eb) are, respectively, the atomic number, the effective CNs and the single bond energy of the ith surface layer (bulk), Ni is the interface atomic number of the core, Ec–s and x denote the formation enthalpy of an interfacial bond and the molar ratio of interfacial atoms, zr, zθ and zz are the effective CNs of the core in the radial, tangential and axial directions, S is the cross-sectional area of an atom, ΔE is the thermal energy gain induced by external stimuli with temperature T, η[hkl]i and ηb are the heat capacity of surface for the [hkl] orientation of NWs and that of the bulk, and Na, kB, and Θ are the Avogadro's number, Boltzmann's constant, and Debye temperature, respectively.16
Physically, the energy bandgap (Eg) is from the crystal potential and the width of the gap is an approximation calculated using the first Fourier coefficient of the crystal potential energy, which is proportional to the mean cohesive energy per bond 〈E0〉, i.e., Eg ∝ 〈E0〉 = E(D)/〈z〉N, where  is the average CNs. Therefore, the size-dependent energy bandgap can be obtained as (3)where γint = 4dint(1 + εr)/D is the interface-to-volume ratio and Ebg is the bandgap of the bulk at zero temperature.
With the aim of addressing the relationship among the size, shell thickness and related transport properties of semiconductor NWs, we consider that the factors which contribute to the carrier mobility can be separated into several parts, i.e., 1/μ = 1/μ0 + 1/μ1 +⋯+ 1/μn, where μ0 is the intrinsic carrier mobility. In our case, the main factors are from phonon scattering, surface roughness scattering, and the sub-bands. The phonon scattering is mainly induced by the acoustic phonons, whereas optical phonons are not affected significantly by confinement.20 The acoustic phonon scattering rate using Fermi's golden rule with the elastic scattering approximation is given by,14, the matrix element after integrating over phonon coordinates, for scattering from subband n with wavevector x to subband m with x′. Generally, the ionized impurity scattering mobility can be derived from the Brooks–Herring formula, resulting in μ ∝ T3/2.32 In addition, the phonon scattering has a μph ∝ D2m*−1.5 dependence,3,20 and surface roughness scattering approximately has a μsr ∝ μph/Δ2 ∝ D2m*−1.5/Δ2 dependence,33,34 where Δ is the root mean square roughness. In the light of the tight-binding method, the effective mass of low-dimensional materials is proportional to the bandgap. Thus, μsr ∝ D2Eg−1.5/Δ2.35 Moreover, the number of subband can be shown as , where En is the subband energy level spacing, ħ = h/2π and h is Planck's constant.36 Notably, we consider that the effect of the subband energy level spacing on the subband number is much weaker and thus can be ignored. Additionally, Neophytou et al.20 proposed μsub−1 ∝ P. Consequently, we have (4)where A and B are constants, and T0 is the room temperature, and C is the constant that relates to the band curvature. Note that the influence of the subband curvature on the electron mobility can be ignored.20 Therefore, we take C = 0 for electron mobility.
3. Results and discussions
In order to elucidate the effects of the size and shell on the transport properties of NWs, we take the typical Si[111]/Ge and Si[110]/Ge core–shell NWs as examples to explore the electronic properties and carrier mobility (including electron and hole mobility) of the Si core by controlling the diameter and shell thickness as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The necessary parameters are listed in Table 1. We select the Si/Ge core–shell NWs as an example mainly due to its compatibility with the current Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor integrated circuit technology and their better scalability and leakage control. Moreover, the heteroepitaxy between Si and Ge follows a Stranski–Krastanov mechanism due to the 4.2% lattice mismatch, which implies that the Si/Ge core–shell NWs can not only be prepared via the experiment but also is suitable for nanoelectronic devices. Notably, we assume that the coating layer is just adhered to the surface of SiNWs to passivate dangling bonds and the energy of the interface strain is not large enough to form a dislocation and heterojunction. Also, we focus on the influence of bond parameters such as the bond length and bond energy on the band structures, and then combine the band theory and the scattering theory to calculate the related carrier mobility.

Using eqn (3), we calculate the size-dependent bandgap of SiNWs under various Ge coating layers. As shown in Fig. 1, the bandgap of the SiNWs increases with reducing diameter and shell thickness. The physical origin can be ascribed to the surface relaxation and confinement effect. These two factors can modulate the surface state of the SiNWs. Similarly, Park et al.37 showed that the surface dangling bond has an important impact on the bandgap, and they found that the surface dangling bond decreases with increasing diameter and shell thickness. Also, Gao38 indicated that the atoms at the surface of nanosystems have a lower average CN, which leads to the electronic structure deviating from that of the core interior. Our predictions are consistent with the available calculations and simulations.39,40
In fact, the electronic properties and surface state determined by the surface coordination defects and SVR play a crucial role in the carrier transport. In order to understand the effects of size and confinement on the carrier transport properties, we predict the electron and hole mobility in SiNWs under different Ge layers at room temperature. As plotted in Fig. 2(a), we can see that the electron mobility decreases monotonically with diminishing diameter. This larger sensitivity in thin NWs can be elaborated as follows: (i) the enhancement of phonon and surface roughness scattering effects in the miniaturized NWs and (ii) the appearance of self-equilibrium strain induced by the dangling bond can make the electronic properties different from that of the bulk case. Fig. 2(b) shows the size-dependent hole mobility under different shell thicknesses. Unlike the electron mobility, the hole mobility in SiNWs exhibits a first rapid increase with increasing size and then reduces as the diameter is beyond ∼3 nm. The decrease of the hole mobility in thick wires can be attributed to the influence of sub-bands. The results suggest that the hole mobility in small-size nanostructures is determined by the phonon and surface roughness scattering, while the sub-bands play a dominant role in the hole mobility for the thick wires. The competition among phonon scattering, surface roughness scattering and the sub-bands results in a maximum value for the hole mobility. Evidently, our predictions are in good agreement with the available evidence.7,20,27,41–43
 Fig. 2  Size-dependent mobility of SiNWs under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers, (a) electron and (b) hole. Note that the intrinsic carrier mobility of electron (hole) is μe0 = 1100 (μh0 = 5000),3,42 and Δ = 0.48 for bare Si[111] NWs [20], while Δ = 0 when the NW is coated by a shell. Moreover, the constants A, B, and C of electron (hole) mobility are, respectively, 1.0 × 10−2 (2.0 × 10−6), 6.0 × 10−2 (6.0 × 10−6), and 0 (0.8). 
Also, the enhancement of the carrier mobility can be achieved by coating a layer on SiNWs. As shown in Fig. 2, we can see that the carrier (including electrons and holes) mobility increases with increasing Ge coatings, even a 0.5 nm-thick Ge layer results in a great increase of the mobility. Indeed, the presence of a passivation layer is of great benefit to the mobility of SiNWs as the surface passivated NWs can approach ideal values of perfect semiconductor crystals and suppress the influence of the acoustic wave on the band structure.9,44 Strikingly, as plotted in Fig. 2(b), the maximum values of hole mobility with coating 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 nm Ge shells are, respectively, 1181, 1487, 1583, 1665, and 1761 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are much bigger than that of the bulk case, 450 cm2 V−1 s−1.20 Additionally, the maximum values of hole mobility of SiNWs shifted with the thickness of the Ge shell coating, suggesting that the maximum hole mobility can be tunable by controlling the shell thickness and specimen size.
To explore the possible advantages of shell thickness in the enhancement of carrier mobility, we further investigate the relationship between the shell thickness and mobility at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. It is clear to see that the carrier mobility shows a first-rapid increase with increasing size and then gradually tends to a constant with a slow increase. For example, the electron mobilities of 4 nm SiNWs with coated 0.5 nm and 10 nm Ge are, respectively, 547 and 602 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are nearly 2 and 2.1 times larger than that of the bare wire, 280 cm2 V−1 s−1. Remarkably, the effects of the coating layer on the carrier mobility become weaker as the diameter increases. For instance, the electron mobility in 4, 8, and 12 nm SiNWs and the hole mobility in 2, 4, and 8 nm SiNWs under 10 nm Ge coating are, respectively, enhanced 2.00, 1.30, and 1.14 times and 1.38, 1.09, and 1.04 times compared to those of bare NWs. This trend is expected since the influence of SVR and strain induced by the radial growth of the Ge shell on the electronic properties of Si NWs becomes less. Similarly, Hashemi et al.45 presented that the difference between hole mobilities of SiNWs without and with hydrogen annealing, which can smooth and/or reshape suspended NWs, gradually decreases with increasing size.

Moreover, we explore the effect of low mismatch strain on the transport properties of SiNWs and check the validity of this model using the available evidence. Fig. 4 shows the mobility of Si[110]/Ge core–shell NWs at room temperature. Just like the transport properties of Si[111]/Ge NWs, the electron mobility in Si/Ge core–shell NWs decreases when the diameter is reduced, while the hole mobility shows a maximum value at 2 nm. In addition, we can see that the electron and hole mobilities in Si[110]/Ge core–shell NWs are lower than those in Si[111]/Ge NWs. This is mainly due to the difference of the band structure, lattice potential and scattering potential in various orientations.20,27 Importantly, we found that the electron mobility of a 1 nm Si core covered with a 0.25 nm Ge shell is about 5 times larger than that of bare Si NWs. It should be noted that not just Ge can suppress the surface roughness scattering and modulate the band structure of the Si core, but SiO2,46 Al2O3,44etc., have a significant impact on the transport properties of the Si core as well.
 Fig. 4  Size-dependent mobility of Si[110] NWs under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers. The intrinsic carrier mobility of electron (hole) is μe0 = 900 (μh0 = 5000),34,42 and Δ = 0.48 for bare NWs [20], while Δ = 0 when the NW is coated by a shell. The constants A, B, and C of electron (hole) mobility are, respectively, 2.0 × 10−3 (1.5 × 10−3), 2.0 × 10−2 (1.0 × 10−4), and 0 (2). 
Moreover, to clarify the relationship between external stimuli and transport properties, we calculate the temperature dependence of electron and hole mobility of 4 nm Si[111] and Si [110] under different Ge shells, as shown in Fig. 5. Evidently, all the curves show the increase in mobility with reducing temperature, and the log–log dependence of mobility versus temperature is linear. Compared to the available results, we find that our predictions do not match well with the experimental results (ref. 47 and 48) and some theoretical results (ref. 7 and 25), while they coincide well with the evidence at high temperatures. In fact, the effect of impurity scattering and the shift of the Fermi level are not considered in our case. Thus, the carrier mobility that changes with imposed temperature in our calculations may not be consistent with some experimental and simulation results, especially for thin wires.9 Moreover, the carrier mobility is determined by not only the phonon scattering, surface scattering and band structures, but also the impurity scattering and carrier concentration. On one hand, the impurity scattering plays a key role in the carrier mobility at low temperatures, while it is phonon scattering at high temperatures. Thus, our model may not apply to low temperature, but it can be suitable for the carrier mobility at high temperature. On the other hand, the doping effect determines the carrier mobility as well. To the best of our knowledge, almost semiconductor devices may be used in the heavily doped region, which can modify the activation energies of Coulomb traps and smoothen the random potential landscape, shift the Fermi level and concomitantly change the carrier hopping system.49,50
 Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent mobility of 4 nm Si[111] and Si[110] wires under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers. 
Furthermore, to illustrate how the strain affects the transport properties, we focus on the effect of self-equilibrium strain on the carrier mobility. As plotted in Fig. 6, our calculation indicates that the electron and hole mobilities increase monotonically with increasing self-equilibrium strain, and the relative change of electron mobility (see the blue line in Fig. 6) is more remarkable than that of hole mobility (see the red line in Fig. 6). Moreover, the mobility induced by the compressive strain is larger than that of the tensile strain. When the compressive and tensile strain are fixed at 0.2, the relative changes of the electron mobility are, respectively, 11.3% and 6.6%, and 5.5% and 3.3% for the hole mobility. The physical origin can be ascribed to the change of the effective mass and the inter-valley scattering.18 In our case, the strain in SiNWs can be applied by the Ge shell as the discrepancy of the lattice constant, which is of great benefit to the carrier mobility as the strain can break the degeneracy of the v2 (heavy) and v1 (light) valence bands at Γ and the reduction of the transport effective mass.51,52 Noticeably, although we focus on Si/Ge core–shell NWs, in our case mentioned above, one may also carry out a similar process on other materials, such as 2D materials, including MoS2, WSe2, black phosphorus, heterojunctions, etc.,53 which also demonstrate size dependence of transport properties and high carrier mobility, especially covered by a thin film or metal-ion modification.54,55

4. Conclusion
In summary, we establish an analytical model to address the dependence of the carrier mobility of SiNWs on the size, shell, orientation and imposed temperature at the atomic level. Our predictions show that the decrease in dimension is of great benefit to improve the phonon scattering and surface roughness scattering, resulting in the depression of carrier transport. In addition, we found that the competition among the phonon scattering, surface roughness scattering and sub-bands determines a maximum value of the hole mobility. Also, we demonstrate that even a 0.25 nm-thick Ge layer, which can weaken the surface state, self-equilibrium strain and scattering effect, leads to the enhancement of the carrier transport efficiently. Importantly, our results agree reasonably well with the experimental measurements and simulations, suggesting that the proposed method could be a general approach to deal with transport properties of one-dimensional nanostructures.

 	Fig. 2  Size-dependent mobility of SiNWs under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers, (a) electron and (b) hole. Note that the intrinsic carrier mobility of electron (hole) is μe0 = 1100 (μh0 = 5000),3,42 and Δ = 0.48 for bare Si[111] NWs [20], while Δ = 0 when the NW is coated by a shell. Moreover, the constants A, B, and C of electron (hole) mobility are, respectively, 1.0 × 10−2 (2.0 × 10−6), 6.0 × 10−2 (6.0 × 10−6), and 0 (0.8).	 

 	Fig. 3  Carrier mobility of SiNWs as a function of shell thickness, (a) electron and (b) hole. The inset shows the relative change in mobility under different diameters. μh=0e(D) (μh=0h(D)) is the electron (hole) mobility of bare Si[111] NW with D diameter.	 

 	Fig. 4  Size-dependent mobility of Si[110] NWs under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers. The intrinsic carrier mobility of electron (hole) is μe0 = 900 (μh0 = 5000),34,42 and Δ = 0.48 for bare NWs [20], while Δ = 0 when the NW is coated by a shell. The constants A, B, and C of electron (hole) mobility are, respectively, 2.0 × 10−3 (1.5 × 10−3), 2.0 × 10−2 (1.0 × 10−4), and 0 (2).	 

 	Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent mobility of 4 nm Si[111] and Si[110] wires under different thicknesses of Ge coating layers.	 

 	Fig. 6  The relationship between relative shift of carrier mobility and self-equilibrium strain in SiNWs.
