    , Accepted 4th November 2019First published on 5th November 2019AbstractLow solar light absorption and high electron–hole pair recombination are still the main challenges for solar energy conversion. Here, we design a plasmonic nanoparticle (NP)-film with a unique structure combining the advantages of a Au NP and film, which exhibits strong broadband absorption from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range. In addition, the high density of sub-1 nm inter-particle gaps in the Au NP-film supports electromagnetic field enhancement of several orders of magnitude that greatly promotes the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs. Accordingly, the plasmonic NP-film-assisted photocatalyst (TiO2/90Au/TiO2) leads to an 88-fold increase in the photocurrent density at 0.75 V vs. RHE in 25% methanol solution under visible-NIR light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) compared to a TiO2 film, which is higher than those of the ever reported Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in the entire visible-NIR range. Our finding indicates a promising way to explore full solar spectrum photocatalysts, which can be easily extended to other energy conversion applications.
Introduction
Solar energy conversion has been regarded as one of the most promising strategies to resolve the world's potential energy crisis.1–4 The use of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells has been one of the indispensable approaches to produce fuel-hydrogen.5–9 Recently, more research studies have focused on the development of highly efficient photocatalysts exhibiting high solar absorption, but many photocatalysts suffer from poor visible and near-infrared (NIR) light absorption, with even no response in the NIR range.10–13 Therefore, it is very important to explore photocatalysts with the capacity to harvest a wide range of solar light. More recently, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) has been applied in solar energy harvesting, conversion, and storage, ascribed to their advantage of high optical absorption expanding to the visible or NIR range of the solar spectrum.14–23 SPR can lead to an enhanced near-field electric field and strong light scattering into the far-field, which are controlled by the size and shape of the metal NPs.24–27 The catalysts integrated with metal NPs have been demonstrated to exhibit remarkably increased solar light absorption.28–33 However, only the metal NPs with a definite size and shape display a particular SPR in a discrete wavelength range, the other wavelength ranges of solar light have not been fully harvested.34,35 Thus, two or more kinds of metal NPs were simultaneously applied to the photocatalytic system in order to cover more wavelength range of the solar spectrum.29,36,37 Nevertheless, isolated plasmonic metal NPs could only provide 1 order of magnitude of electromagnetic field enhancement (E2/E02),38,39 which presented much smaller enhancement in the entire visible and NIR range. Moreover, the complicated synthesis and fabrication process largely limit their practical applications and commercial viability.
In this work, we constructed a plasmonic NP-film based on the facile self-assembly of Au NPs at the water/oil interface for photoelectrochemical catalysis. Such a Au NP-film combines the SPR modes of the particle and the film, which demonstrates wide-range SPR modes across the entire visible-NIR region. To certify the advantages of the plasmonic Au NP-film, a uniform TiO2 film was fabricated by spin-coating to form a Au NP-film/TiO2 film photoanode. Significantly, the enhanced photoelectrochemical catalytic activity of the Au NP-film/TiO2 photoanode could be optimized by modulating the size of Au NPs and the position of the Au NP-film relative to the TiO2 film. An 88-fold increase in the photocurrent density (λ > 420 nm) of TiO2 is obtained, which is the highest enhancement factor obtained for a Au/TiO2 photocatalyst in the entire visible-NIR region. A Au NP-film with a high density of sub-1 nm inter-particle gaps is beneficial for photoelectrochemical catalysis, not only because it provides wide optical absorption expanding to the visible or NIR range of the solar spectrum, but also because it supports electromagnetic field enhancement of several orders of magnitude that greatly promotes the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs. This work offers a promising and simplified strategy to design plasmonic photoelectrodes with a wide-range SPR mode and effective charge separation, which are highly expected for the application in the conversion of solar energy into chemical or electrical energy.
Experimental section
Materials
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate hydrate (auric acid, HAuCl4·3H2O) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trisodium citrate dehydrate (99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methanol, alcohol and n-heptane were of analytical grade and purchased from Enox. Water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm−1 was used throughout the experiments.
Synthesis of the Au seed (13 nm)
Firstly, 100 mL of 0.4 mM HAuCl4 was added into a 250 mL three-necked flask with a round bottom followed by vigorous stirring for 15 min. At the same time, the solution was heated using a heating mantle. After the solution boiled, 5.0 mL of 0.04 mM sodium citrate was injected. Then, the light purple color changed to purple-black in 15 min.
Synthesis of Au NPs of different sizes
Firstly, 3.0 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4, 200 μL Au seed and 20 mL H2O were mixed in a flask. Secondly, 600 μL of 400 mM H3NO·HCl was added to the flask under vigorous stirring. Then, 1.0 mL of 0.04 mM sodium citrate was added to the flask after the color of the solution changed. Finally, dispersed and uniform 30 nm Au NPs were successfully synthesized.
Fabrication of the Au NP-film
Au NPs were centrifuged, and then dispersed in water. Then, the Au NPs at a certain concentration were injected into a vial followed by the addition of 1.0 mL n-heptane. After the addition of 100 μL ethanol, Au NPs formed a film at the water/n-heptane interface. Finally, the film was transferred onto the TiO2 film/FTO substrate.
Fabrication of TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes
Firstly, 100 μL of 0.5 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (diluted with n-Butanol) was spin-coated on the FTO substrate (1 cm × 2.5 cm) at 4000 rpm s−1 for 20 s, followed by baking on a heater at 120 °C for 5 min. Then, the above operation was repeated twice. Afterwards, the close-packed Au NP-film was transferred onto the TiO2 film. Finally, another TiO2 film with the same thickness was deposited on the Au NP-film, followed by annealing in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 2 hours. The total thickness of TiO2 is 300 nm.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an FEI Quanta 200 F SEM spectrometer. The UV-vis spectra of TiO2/xAu/TiO2 were recorded on an Aglient 8453 UV-Vis Diode Array Spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluromax-4) with an excitation wavelength of 275 nm. The quantity of evolved hydrogen was determined by gas chromatography (Shanghai Tianmei, GC-7890T).
PEC measurements
Typically, the PEC performance was determined using a standard 3-electrode cell (Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode). All the tests were carried out in degassed methanol solution (25%, pH = 5.9). All biases were tested versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and were subsequently converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by the following equation:40 (1)where ERHE is the converted bias versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the applied bias measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and  is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 25 °C (0.1976 V). A Xe lamp (300 W, Newport) acted as the light source. Visible-NIR light and single wavelength light were obtained by adding a series of filters in front of a light source. The IPCE was evaluated by the photocurrent and the power of the incident light at each wavelength and was calculated using the following equation:41 IPCE = (1240 × I)/(λ × Jlight)(2)where I is the measured photocurrent density, Jlight is the measured irradiance at a specific wavelength, and λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm). Impedance measurements were conducted under visible-light illumination (λ > 420 nm) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at an open circuit voltage over a frequency range from 105 to 10 Hz with an AC voltage of 10 mV.
FDTD simulation
The simulations were conducted using the commercial finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) software package Lumerical FDTD Solutions 8.5. According to the SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S1,† the electrode models were constructed with the hexagonal close packed Au NPs embedded in the TiO2 matrix. The diameters of the Au NPs are 30 nm, 60 nm and 90 nm, respectively, and the gaps between the neighboring Au NPs are 1.3 nm, 0.86 nm and 0.7 nm, which will not give rise to the nonlocality effect.42 The thickness of the upper and lower layers of the TiO2 matrix is 150 nm. In the simulation, periodic boundary conditions are used in the x-direction and the y-direction, and perfectly matched layer boundaries are along the z-direction. A plane wave with the wavelength ranging from 400 nm to 1200 nm was chosen as the excitation source, which propagated along the −z direction. The frequency-dependent complex dielectric constants of TiO2 were obtained by ellipsometry measurements and those of Au were taken from the literature.43

Results and discussion
High solar light absorption and electromagnetic field enhancement are two of the many important factors in the plasmon enhanced photocatalytic reaction.19,20,29,44 Au NPs are usually used as a light absorber to enhance the absorption property of a semiconductor, however, single wavelength absorption of 520 nm (Fig. 1a) only leads to a smaller enhancement in photocatalytic activity in the visible region.15,17,20 The evaporated Au film (thickness: 90 nm) has better light absorption at wavelengths greater than 600 nm (Fig. 1a); nevertheless, a dense film blocks most solar light hindering photocatalysis. Moreover, a dense Au film provides only a small electromagnetic field enhancement due to surface plasmon polariton (SPP).45,46 Therefore, we design a “Au NP-film” structure combing the advantages of a particle and a film to achieve absorption in the entire visible-NIR range (λ > 420 nm, Fig. 1a) and high electromagnetic field enhancement resulting from the high density of sub-1 nm gaps in the Au NP film.47–50 The fabrication process of the Au NP-film is illustrated in Fig. 1b (detailed processes are given in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S1† (Au NPs of different sizes), the scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly exhibit the high density of Au NPs with uniform size and uniformly distributed gaps. The average gaps decreased from 1.3 nm to 0.7 nm when the size of Au NPs increased from 30 nm to 90 nm. Such an extremely small gap is expected to generate an extremely enhanced electromagnetic field in coupled Au NPs,47,50,51 which is beneficial to the electron–hole generation rate.52–56 In order to verify this concept, a photoanode with the TiO2/Au NP-film/TiO2 structure was fabricated. The cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 2d and Fig. S2† show that the Au NP-film is sandwiched well between two TiO2 layers. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to confirm the crystal structures of the photoanodes (Fig. S3†). All samples exhibit strong diffraction peaks at 25.37° and 37.8°, corresponding to the (101) and (004) crystal planes of anatase phased TiO2 (JCPDS No. 71-1166). Besides this, the diffraction peaks of the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 samples (38.15°, 44.4° and 64.6°) are assigned to Au (JCPDS No. 01-1172) and the peak intensity of Au increases gradually when the size increases, indicating that more Au NPs are embedded in the TiO2 film.

The photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 and TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanodes was determined in a 3-electrode configuration, where the reference electrode and conductor electrode are Ag/AgCl and platinum wire, respectively (details are given in the Experimental section). Fig. 2e shows the photocurrent density versus bias curves (J–V) under visible-NIR light illumination (λ > 420 nm) recorded in 25% methanol solution. Clearly, the TiO2 photoanode shows negligible photocurrent compared to the dark current, agreeing well with the reported literature.10,15 Compared with a bare TiO2 photoanode, the TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanode exhibited substantially larger photocurrent under illumination. Furthermore, chronoamperometric I–t curves at 0.75 V vs. RHE for the TiO2 and TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanodes under visible-NIR light were determined. As shown in Fig. 2f, TiO2/90Au/TiO2 achieved a photocurrent of ∼80 μA cm−2, this is about 88 times that obtained from a bare TiO2 photoanode. The increase in the photocurrent is consistent with the enhanced solar absorption under visible-NIR light (Fig. 1a), suggesting that more charge carriers are generated in the presence of the Au NP-film.21 Moreover, the effect of the thickness of TiO2 on the photocurrent was studied (Fig. S4†). It is obvious that the optimal thickness is 150 nm (top TiO2 layer), showing the highest photocurrent. When the thickness of the top TiO2 layer further increases, the photocurrent decreases. This is probably due to the increased diffusion length with the increase in the thickness, resulting in enhanced recombination of the generated e−–h+ pairs.57,58
In order to explore the effect of the position of the Au NP-film in the TiO2 film on the photocatalytic performance, three different structures (bottom, inner and top) are fabricated (Fig. 3a). It is reported that the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of noble metal NPs can promote e−–h+ generation/separation as their localized electromagnetic energy is close to their surface, which improves the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductors.59–61 In particular, the intensity of the electromagnetic field plays a key role in the plasmon enhanced photocatalytic reaction,62,63 therefore, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation is conducted to simulate the electromagnetic responses of the three structures. According to the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2, the electrode models were constructed with the hexagonal close packed Au NPs embedded in the TiO2 matrix. The gaps between the neighboring Au NPs are set at 0.7 nm. The cross-sectional electromagnetic wave (log10(|E|2/|E0|2)) distributions in the xz plane are plotted in Fig. 3b. The normalized electric field intensities were calculated from 400 nm to 1200 nm at the wavelength steps of 2 nm. Then, they were weighted according to their relative intensities of solar irradiance and superimposed to form a weighted superposition contour map. Clearly, the electric field surrounds the Au NPs, which is much enhanced at the contact area between the Au NPs and the TiO2 film. In particular, the hot spots show electromagnetic field enhancement of several orders of magnitude (|E|2/|E0|2) (marked with a red dashed rectangle), which indicates that the photon absorption rate is increased by several orders of magnitude.59–61 The photocatalytic enhancement factor (PEF) is defined based on the FDTD results, which is calculated by integrating the weighted superpositions of the normalized electric field intensity in the middle section. The domain of the integration is the area of the TiO2 matrix except the areas of the Au NPs. As shown in Fig. 3c, the inner structure shows the highest integration value. This indicates that TiO2 surrounding the Au NP-film will generate more charge carriers in the inner structure, suggesting the best photocatalytic performance. To verify the result, the PEC performance was determined. Fig. 3d shows the J–V curves of TiO2/xAu/TiO2 under white light illumination. Clearly, all these three structures show a higher photocurrent density than TiO2. Importantly, the inner structure exhibits a substantially larger photocurrent than other structures. In particular, the inner structure showed the maximal photocurrent density of 0.129 mA cm−2 at 0.75 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3e), which is about 2 times and 1.7 times those of the top and the bottom structures, respectively. This result agrees well with the variation of the integration of electric field square (Fig. 3c), further confirming the important role of the electromagnetic field intensity in improving the PEC catalytic activity.

TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes with different particle sizes were fabricated to investigate the effect of the size of the Au NP-film on enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Firstly, the absorption spectra of the pure TiO2 film and TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes were evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 4a. The pure TiO2 film alone shows a very weak absorption in the visible-NIR range because of its large bandgap.64,65 By contrast, all TiO2/xAu/TiO2 samples illustrate a greatly extended absorption in the entire visible-NIR range because of the plasmonic coupling effect among the neighboring Au NPs.53,66 Furthermore, the intensity gradually becomes strong with increasing size of Au NPs in the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 samples. Fig. 4b shows chronoamperometric I–t curves for bare TiO2 and TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes under visible-NIR light illumination. Obviously, TiO2 showed only a weak photocurrent density of 0.9 μA cm−2. As expected, the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes show a much enhanced photocurrent density and the photocurrent increases with the increase of the size of Au NPs, with a photocurrent density of ∼16 μA cm−2 for TiO2/30Au/TiO2, ∼37 μA cm−2 for TiO2/60Au/TiO2 and ∼80 μA cm−2 for TiO2/90Au/TiO2, respectively. One of the reasons for the much-improved photocurrent density is enhanced solar absorption in the visible-NIR range (Fig. 4a) with increasing size of Au NPs. Another aspect that results from the enhanced electromagnetic field with increasing size of the Au NPs (Fig. S5†) is the promotion of the generation and separation of e−–h+ pairs of TiO2 surrounding the Au NP-film.59–61 Moreover, electromagnetic field integration in the xz plane (Fig. S5d†) increases with increasing size of Au NPs, which is consistent with the photocurrent enhancement factor of the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes under visible-NIR light illumination (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the chronoamperometric I–t curves under white light (AM 1.5G) were studied as shown in Fig. 4c. As expected, the TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanode exhibits the highest photocurrent density of 129 μA cm−2, exceeding the photocurrent density of ∼36 μA cm−2 for TiO2/30Au/TiO2 and ∼49 μA cm−2 for TiO2/60Au/TiO2.

(d) IPCE curves of pure TiO2 and TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes. 
To further elucidate the LSPR effect of the Au NP-film in enhancing the photoactivity of TiO2, incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of TiO2 and TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes are recorded at 0.75 V vs. RHE. The IPCE was evaluated by the photocurrent and the power of the incident light at each wavelength.41 As shown in Fig. 4d, the TiO2 photoanode only has a negligible value in the visible-NIR range. Significantly, all the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanodes present enhanced photoactivity in the visible-NIR region compared to the bare TiO2 photoanode. In particular, the TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanode exhibits the maximal value in the visible-NIR range. The IPCE curve exhibits two peaks at 700 nm and 1040 nm, which is similar to the two absorption peaks in Fig. 1a. This result suggests that the improved photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/xAu/TiO2 photoanode in the visible-NIR range results from the plasmon resonance coupling of the close-packed Au NP-film. Furthermore, the photoresponse of TiO2/90Au/TiO2 under single wavelengths (500 nm, 630 nm, 790 nm, and 970 nm) was studied (Fig. S6†). TiO2/90Au/TiO2 exhibits a higher photoresponse compared to TiO2 under these wavelengths, which further confirms that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the visible-NIR range is due to the plasmon resonance coupling of the close-packed Au NP-film.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained to verify the LSPR effect of the Au NP-film on the charge generation and charge separation properties. Generally, PL intensity is positively correlated with the combination of photogenerated charges.10,67 As shown in Fig. 5a, TiO2 exhibits a strong PL intensity with a broad emission peak at around 377 nm, resulting from the recombination of photoexcited charges in TiO2.68 This intense PL signal indicates high charge recombination of the TiO2 film. Nevertheless, the PL intensity of TiO2/xAu/TiO2 is remarkably decreased. In addition, the PL intensity decreases with increasing size of Au NPs. Therefore, it is suggested that the recombination of charges (electron–hole) in TiO2 is effectively restrained because of the strong LSPR effect of the Au NP-film. To further probe the interfacial properties between the photoanode and the electrolyte, Nyquist plots of EIS were obtained under visible-NIR-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, Fig. 5b). Compared with TiO2, TiO2/xAu/TiO2 shows a remarkably decreased capacitive arc radius. In particular, TiO2/90Au/TiO2 exhibits the smallest arc radii, indicating the most effective separation of electron–hole pairs under visible-NIR light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). More importantly, the result agrees well with the results of PEC and PL, demonstrating the highest separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs of the TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanode. To further confirm the effective generation of e−–h+ pairs in TiO2 under visible-NIR light, the volume of produced hydrogen (H2) was measured at 0.75 V vs. RHE under illumination of visible-NIR light (AM 1.5G, 500 mW cm−2) by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. S7,† no H2 was generated at the pure TiO2 photoanode and 6.18 μM H2 was produced at the TiO2/90Au/TiO2 photoanode after 24 h of testing, which showed that e−–h+ pairs are generated under the low photo energy of visible-NIR light.55,69 Accordingly, we proposed a schematic of the mechanism, shown in Fig. 5c. When the Au NP-film is excited with visible-NIR light, a strong local electric field will form at the contact area between TiO2 and Au NPs due to the LSPR effect. In particular, the huge electric field produced in the “hot spot” regions greatly promotes the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs though the photo energy of visible-NIR below the band gap of TiO2.55,69 After electron–hole separation, electrons would reduce H2O to form H2 on the platinum electrode; meanwhile, a hole will migrate to the TiO2/liquid interface to oxidize methanol in solution.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel architecture of a plasmonic NP-film was designed based on integrating the merits of a Au NP and a film, which extended the absorption spectrum to the entire visible-NIR range. Furthermore, the Au NP-film with a high density of sub-1 nm inter-particle gaps was demonstrated to show huge electromagnetic field enhancement. Accordingly, such plasmonic photocatalysts exhibited high photoelectrochemical catalytic activity under visible-NIR light when employed in a water splitting system. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical catalytic activity can be optimized by the size and position of the Au NP-film relative to TiO2. The experimental results showed that TiO2/90Au/TiO2 (inner structure) presents the best performance with about 88-fold enhancement compared to the bare TiO2 electrode under visible-NIR light illumination (λ > 420 nm). With the confirmation of FDTD simulations, the remarkable enhancement is due to the enhanced solar light absorption (generating more electron–hole pairs) and electromagnetic field enhancement (promoting electron–hole pair separation) with increasing size of Au NPs. Thus, by combining the SPR models of the particle and the film, one can easily exploit the photocatalyst with high activity in a broad spectrum range. Our study provides a promising strategy for designing a plasmonic photocatalyst with high activity in the full solar spectrum.
