    , Accepted 25th September 2012First published on 25th September 2012AbstractA simple two step strategy was developed to introduce carboxyl groups via Vilsmeier–Haack formylation on the commercially available conjugated polymer BEHP-co-MEH PPV followed by Knoevenagel condensation. Adsorption of the carboxyl-modified polymer onto TiO2 film and J–V curves were studied for the dye sensitized solar cell and compared with the base polymer BEHP-co-MEH PPV. Carboxyl-modification of BEHP-co-MEH PPV resulted in significant enhancement in the efficiency (3%), compared to the base polymer which showed an efficiency of only 0.3%. The details of the synthetic procedure, characterization and the photovoltaic property measurements are presented and discussed.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) promise to be a potential alternative to the conventional silicon solar cells due to use of relatively low cost materials and possibility of large scale production on hard and flexible substrates. Based on organic–inorganic hybrid architectures, DSSCs have already shown fairly high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) primarily with ruthenium based dyes as sensitizers.1–4 Use of such metal containing dyes, however, represents a major disadvantage in terms of cost as rare earth metals are expensive. Another disadvantage is the instability of these dyes at high temperature which limits certain otherwise potentially accessible cell processing protocols and explorations of cell performance at enhanced temperatures. Moreover, the efficiency of these dyes is dependent on many factors such as the structure of dyes, electrodes, photo-anode, etc.5,6 In view of these considerations; explorations of metal-free dyes have attracted considerable scientific attention. Metal-free dyes which include small organic molecules7–9 and conjugated polymers (CPs) with a broad-band absorption in the visible region are promising candidates for DSSCs. Ability of such dyes to load on the semiconducting metal oxide structure facilitates the photo-excited electron–hole pair transfer via proper matching of their HOMO–LUMO levels with the respective electrodes10 and the electrolyte11 which is the key to their effective use in DSSC architecture.
Conjugated polymers have broadband absorption in the visible region due to their extended conjugation and exhibit interesting charge carrier transport properties. They are potential candidates for DSSCs because of high values of their molar extinction coefficient, tunable optical properties, and solution processability. In addition to being useful as possible sensitizers, CPs can be employed as electrolytes in solid state DSSCs.12–15 Recently, various CPs have been used as sensitizers in DSSCs.16–19 However, considerable work is needed to obtain more insight into their utilization and functioning in DSSCs. Amongst the various reports, comparatively high numbers for PCE in polymer sensitized solar cells have been reported for triphenyl based polymer by Zang et al. (3.3%)20 and terthiophene–benzothiadiazole polymer by Fang et al. (3%).21
Our work is focused on using a conjugated polymer as a sensitizer in the DSSC with the iodide electrolyte. We have modified a commercially available conjugated polymer BEHP-co-MEH PPV (poly{[2-[2′,5′-bis(2′′-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl]-1,4-phenylenevin-ylene]-co-[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevin-ylene]}) (PPV A) so as to introduce carboxylic acid as the anchoring groups on the polymer chain. The anchoring group effect is a crucial factor in the device performance. Carboxylic groups are known to have a good adsorption on TiO2 through Ti–O–C covalent bond which also helps in the efficient charge injection. There are evidences from analysis and computer simulation about the role of such anchoring groups.22–26 In the present work, our main emphasis was to design a strategy to introduce carboxyl groups on the BEHP-co-MEH PPV (PPV A) and study the effect of carboxyl anchoring group on the overall performance of the solar cell. The performance of the base polymer which is devoid of the carboxyl functionality was very low as compared to the carboxyl-modified one which showed ca. 10 fold increase in the device performance with IPCE ∼50% and PCE 3%.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of acid derivative of BEHP-co-MEH-PPV starting from BEHP-co-MEH-PPV
The synthesis of PPV acid involves two steps consisting of well known organic transformations (Scheme 1). Vilsmeier–Haack formylation is a useful method for introduction of formyl groups on the electron rich aromatic rings. Polymer PPV A contains electron rich aromatic rings and thus is a good candidate to perform the formylation reaction. Also PPV A contains vinylene bonds, which are compatible towards the formylation conditions. The first step involves Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of the base polymer PPV A using N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) affording its aldehyde derivative. Knoevenagel condensation of PPV CHO with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine yielded PPV acid (Chart 1). The reactions were followed by 1H NMR spectra of the polymers (Fig. 1). The appearance of the characteristic peaks of the aldehyde functional group at 9.83 ppm and 10.13 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra after the Vilsmeier–Haack formylation confirmed the formation of the PPV CHO. We observed two peaks for aldehyde in the NMR spectra which could be attributed to the formylation at two different positions, as the PPV A contains two types of electron-rich aromatic rings having different chemical environments. The disappearance of the aldehyde peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of PPV acid confirmed the condensation of the aldehyde with the cyanoacetic acid group affording the target product, acid derivative of the polymer (PPV acid) (Scheme 1).

UV-Visible spectroscopy
The absorption spectrum of the modified polymer PPV acid is compared with the PPV A in chloroform solution (0.05 mmol) in Fig. 2. The base polymer PPV A showed broadband absorption in the visible region from 350 nm to 550 nm with the absorption maximum at about 460 nm. The PPV acid showed a broadband absorption from 350 nm to 600 nm and absorption maximum at 450 nm with a blue shift. After modification of polymer, a red shift was expected in the UV-visible absorption spectrum because of the extension in conjugation due to incorporation of cyano acrylic acid moiety. However, surprisingly the modified polymer showed a blue shift as stated above. Please see also the ESI-1.† Despite the electron withdrawing nature of cyano acrylic acid moiety, its presence on the aromatic ring of pendant chain at position indicated by “(a)” (Scheme 1) can cause a break in the conjugation, leading to the observed blue shift in the case of PPV-acid.27,28
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis spectra of PPV A and PPV acid derivative respectively. 
The molar extinction coefficients were calculated from the corresponding absorption spectra of PPV A and PPV acid and values were found to be 4.2 × 105 cm−1 mol−1 and 7.9 × 105 cm−1 mol−1 respectively. This result corroborates with the increased conjugation.
FTIR study
The FTIR spectra of polymers were taken in the solid state using a KBr pellet (Fig. 3). The peaks at 1741 cm−1 and 1744 cm−1 represent the characteristic carbonyl frequencies in PPV CHO and PPV acid, respectively. Also the presence of a broad absorption near 3400–2400 cm−1 (at 3390 cm−1) in the PPV acid indicates the –OH frequency.

Band alignment of polymer with TiO2
The band alignment of the PPV A and PPV acid with the TiO2 was obtained using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 4). Electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry) of the PPV A and modified polymer PPV acid were studied in the DCM solution. HOMO of the modified polymer PPV acid is −4.9 eV and that of the base PPV A is −4.8 eV with reference to the vacuum level.

The band gap increased from 2.58 eV to 2.69 eV in PPV acid, supporting the blue shift observed in the UV-vis spectra. Please see also the ESI-2,† for photoluminescence results.

J–V characterization and IPCE measurement

J–V characteristics for the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5(a) for the case of commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticle films using base polymer PPV A and PPV acid polymer dye. The thickness of the TiO2 films used was 8–10 micrometers. Please see also the ESI-3,† for comparison of I–V characteristics of PPV A, PPV CHO and PPV acid.

The current density is seen to have increased dramatically from 1 mA cm−2 to 6.7 mA cm−2 in the case of PPV acid, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 3%. The Voc is also seen to have increased significantly from 0.53 V to 0.69 V. Fig. 5(b) shows the IPCE measurement data for TiO2 sensitized with the polymer dye as a function of wavelength. IPCE was calculated using the equation:IPCE (%) = 1240Jsc/λPinwhere Jsc is the short-circuit current density, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and Pin is the power of the incident light. The PPV acid exhibited 47% broad peak as against the base polymer PPV A which showed only 7% IPCE. This indicates that there is effective charge transfer because of the good adsorption and electronic anchoring of the –COOH functional groups on the surface of TiO2 in the modified polymer PPV acid. The –COOH functional group thus plays a very important role in the charge transfer in case of PPV acid. The IPCE peak in the case of PPV acid is seen to be broad and centered at around 500 nm, which is red shifted from the optical absorption peak around 450 nm (Fig. 2). Such red shift has been reported and attributed to aggregation of dye on TiO2 or influence of double layer at the interface between TiO2 and the electrolyte.29,30 Please see also the ESI-4.† Interestingly, for the non-adsorbing PPV A dye the IPCE and optical absorption maxima remain close. This explains the change from a blue shift for PPV acid in UV-vis absorption (as in Fig. 2 to a red shift in the IPCE as in Fig. 5(b).
We also employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques to further establish and elucidate the nature of binding of the PPV acid on the anatase TiO2 surface. The corresponding results presented in the ESI-5,† clearly bring out that synthetic inclusion of –COOH functional group does enable the desired anchoring of the dye on the TiO2 surface.
Thermal stability
A thermal stability test was conducted on the PPV acid based DSSC and the results were compared with the stability of a standard N719 dye based DSSC. Please see also the ESI-6.† It was found that the solar cell efficiency was stable up to 100 °C for the PPV acid dye while that in the case of N719 it began to degrade above 50 °C (Fig. 6). For the PPV acid dye, the efficiency did not drop completely even above 100 °C, but started degrading gradually above 200 °C which is in accordance with the TGA results of the PPV acid (please see the ESI-7†).

Experimental section

BEHP-cococo-MEH-PPV (PPV A) (MW = 18900, 60:40) and POCl3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. DMF and toluene were dried over calcium hydride followed by distillation under reduced pressure.
Procedure

Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of BEHP-cococo-MEH-PPV (PPV A). 
Into a 500 mL two-necked round bottom flask equipped with a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser, was added PPV A (0.3 g, 1.3 mmol) under argon atmosphere. Dry 1,2-dichlorobenzene (250 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and PPV A was dissolved by ultrasonication for 50 min and purged with argon for 10 min. DMF (0.13 mL, 1.66 mmol) was added using a syringe and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath. POCl3 (0.15 mL, 1.66 mmol) was added drop wise using a syringe over a period of 20 min with continuous stirring, under argon atmosphere. After completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to attain room temperature and stirred for 10 min. The reaction mixture was then heated at 70 °C for a period of 12 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature. It was then diluted with 30 mL of chloroform and poured into ice-cold water and stirred for 1 h. The organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Further purification was done by washing with the methanol. Methanol was decanted and the product was dried in a vacuum oven for 6 h at 60 °C. Yield = 0.2 g.


Knoevenagel condensation of BEHP-coco-MEH-PPV-aldehyde (PPV CHO). 

PPV CHO (0.19 g, 0.87 mmol) was taken into a 100 mL single necked round bottom flask and was degassed by three simultaneous freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Dry toluene (45 mL) was added by using a syringe into the reaction vessel and PPV CHO was dissolved by ultrasonication for 15 min. This solution was transferred into a 250 mL two-necked round bottom flask and piperidine (0.06 mL, 1.13 mmol) was added under argon atmosphere. Cyanoacetic acid was then added to the reaction mixture (0.096 g, 1.13 mmol), and refluxed at 120 °C for 17 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and toluene was removed under reduced pressure. Methanol (30 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min to remove excess piperidine and cyanoacetic acid. After stirring for 30 min, methanol was decanted and the orange product PPV acid was dried in a vacuum oven for 6 h at 60 °C. Yield = 0.16 g.

Characterization of physical properties
The absorption spectra of solutions of PPV A and PPV acid (mM) were recorded in chloroform on a CARY 5 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.). Diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on Jasco instruments and FTIR spectra were recorded using Perkin Elmer instruments. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer at resonance frequency of 500 MHz for 1H and 13C using chloroform-d (Sigma-Aldrich) and methanol-d4 (Sigma-Aldrich) as a solvent. TGA was recorded using TGA-7 Perkin Elmer instrument. The J–V characteristics were measured under exposure with 100 mW cm−2 (450 W xenon lamp, Newport), 1 sun AM, simulated sunlight as a solar simulator. The current was measured using a Keithley 2400 source. Measurements of the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were performed by changing the excitation wavelength (Newport).
Fabrication and testing of DSSCs
To make and to study the DSSC, doctor blading method was employed. After making the films they were annealed at 450 °C for 60 min. For sensitization, the films were dipped in samples viz. solutions of modified or unmodified polymer in chloroform for 24 h at room temperature. The films were then rinsed with chloroform to remove excess polymeric dye on the surface and air-dried at room temperature. This was followed by redox electrolyte addition and top contact of Pt coated FTO. The electrolyte used was 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The J–V characteristics and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were then measured.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a simple two step strategy to introduce carboxylic groups on a conjugated polymer BEHP-cococo-MEH-PPV (PPV A). The introduction of carboxyl groups clearly proves to be beneficial for charge injection through proper anchoring to TiO2 film for its use in DSSCs. Modified polymer PPV acid gives considerably high efficiency (3%) as compared with the unmodified counterpart. Such a simple two step modification may open up new avenues towards potential use of commercially available and chemically stable conjugated polymers for possible use in DSSCs. Interestingly this polymer is thermally stable up to 200 °C.
