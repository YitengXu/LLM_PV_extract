Herein, a fluoroaniline molecule-terminated graphene oxide (GO) is fabricated as an interface modulator in all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Owing to the amidation reaction induced p–π conjugation effect with an adjacent benzene ring, the spontaneous electron transfer from oxygen-containing groups at the GO surface to the aniline unit causes the self-reduction and p-type doping of GO, benefiting hole extraction and delocalization. Together with the passivation effect by –F termination with under-coordinated Pb2+, the best device delivers an efficiency of 11.08% with superior stability originating from the presence of hydrophobic C–F bonds, the reduced defects and suppressed ion migration. Moreover, the functionalized GO can effectively capture and obstruct the leakage of Pb2+ ions from a destructive device, demonstrating its unique advantages in high-performance PSC platforms.
Introduction
As a rising photovoltaic star, organometallic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the “center of the focus” around the world, driving tremendous research to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to the recorded 25.6%.1–4 Because of the low formation energies of perovskite phases, the easy control of film composition and quality by a solution-processing strategy at near room temperature is responsible for this flourishing scene, but inevitably induces chemical instability and decomposition under external stimulus.5,6 With the aim of stabilizing the crystal, the complete substitution of organic species by inorganic Cs+ to form all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, I− or mixed) perovskites is regarded as a promising solution to meet the commercial requirement.7–9 Counterproductively, there is a paradox between the efficiency and stability with respect to the X-site, delivering the emergence of a mixed halide CsPbIBr2 to balance this incompatibility.10,11 Great effort on improving CsPbIBr2 PSC efficiency to over 10% has made steady progress, but is still significantly lower compared to the theoretical value due to mismatched interfacial energetics and defective nanostructure-induced nonradiative recombination.12,13 Following this line of thought, the multi-dimensional regulation of the perovskite surface is crucial for obtaining a high-performance device.14,15
Reconfiguring interfacial driven force for charge extraction and transfer by p-type materials and healing the charged defects with organic molecules based on Lewis acid–base chemistry are till now two mainstreams for maximizing the charge scavenging and for toughening the perovskite surface.16–18 Among them, two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) with a highly π-conjugated carbon–skeleton structure and smaller lattice parameter of 0.246 nm than I− (0.412 nm) displays fascinating capacity in boosting the hole extraction and suppressing the ion migration from the perovskite film, helping overcome the disadvantages of conventional organic hole transport materials (HTMs).19,20 Furthermore, the presence of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO surface can act as Lewis bases to passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+,21 and also play the role of a negative charge center to localize the extracted positive hole, making a substantial charge recombination loss.22 Although this issue has been alleviated by adding a reducing agent, such as a metal or oxide,23,24 the intrinsic passivation ability will undoubtedly be weakened. Therefore, GO should be rationally functionalized if they are to be used to increase the PSC performances.
In this study, we have demonstrated a fluoroaniline molecule-terminated GO (FA-GO) as an efficient interlayer in an all-inorganic, HTM-free CsPbIBr2 PSC. After systematical characterizations, the amidation reaction between –COOH on the GO surface and –NH2 in fluoroaniline results in the self-reduction of GO owing to the spontaneous electron transfer induced p-type doping from oxygen-containing groups to the aniline section, which is beneficial for the hole extraction and delocalization. By simultaneously forming the strong Pb–F and Pb–O chemical bonds, the defective perovskite surface is effectively healed, finally promoting the efficiency to as high as 11.08%, which is one of the highest values for carbon-electrode based CsPbIBr2 PSCs (the performances of state-of-the-art CsPbIBr2 PSCs are summarized in Table S1†). More importantly, the device tolerance to the environment is significantly improved after storage in air for over 80 days because of the superior hydrophobicity under the presence of F atoms with a high heat of hydration (123 kcal mol−1) and low polarizability (0.86 Å3).25 Moreover, the intimate contact between GO and the perovskite layer can also potentially trap or hinder the Pb leakage from PSC to eliminate its detrimental impact on environmental sustainability.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
All materials and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.
Synthesis of An-GO and FA-GO ultrathin films
GO nanoplates were synthesized according to our previous study and the detailed procedure is provided in the ESI.†23 In detail, 1 g graphite powder was added into 20 mL concentrated H2SO4 and 3 g KMnO4 was gradually added under stirring. It should be noted that the temperature of the mixture was not allowed to go over 20 °C. After stirring for 4 h, 40 mL deionized water was added. After further reacting for 1 h, the solution was terminated by adding 100 mL deionized water and 5 mL 30% H2O2 solution, resulting in violent effervescence and an increase in temperature to 100 °C. Then, the suspension was washed with a 1:10 HCl solution (250 mL) in order to remove metal ions using a filter paper and funnel. The suspension was washed with deionized water around 5–8 times for two days using a filter paper and funnel, until the pH was nearly 7. The obtained brown dispersion was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min to remove the unexfoliated GO with a rotor radius of 10 cm. 1 mL aniline or 1 mL 4-fluoroaniline was quickly added in 200 mL GO aqueous (0.5 mg mL−1) solution and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at 60 °C for 24 h. After that, aniline-terminated GO (An-GO) or FA-GO precipitate was washed with isopropanol four times and the final concentrations of An-GO and FA-GO were fixed at 0.1 mg mL−1.
Fabrication of solar cells
The designed FTO substrate was successively cleaned with detergent, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water. After drying, the cleaned FTO was treated with plasma for 180 s and then a compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) acting as electron transport layer was deposited onto the FTO glass by spin-coating an ethanol solution of titanium isopropoxide (0.5 M) and diethanol amine (0.5 M) at 7000 rpm for 30 s, which was subsequently calcinated at 500 °C for 2 h in air. Prior to preparing perovskite films, the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates were treated via oxygen plasma again for 3 min and then quickly transferred into a glove box. The CsPbIBr2 precursor (367 mg PbBr2 and 260 mg CsI dissolved in 1 mL DMSO) was spin-coated onto the FTO/c-TiO2 surface at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 3000 rpm for 50 s, respectively. Then, the as-casted perovskite thin film was heated at 30 °C for 1 min and then 260 °C for 10 min to obtain a high quality perovskite thin film. Subsequently, an An-GO or FA-GO isopropanol solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite film surface at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a carbon back electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was deposited on the perovskite film by the doctor-blade coating method.
Characterization
The polycrystalline structures of perovskite and various GO samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphologies and elemental mapping images of FA-GO treated CsPbIBr2 were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and the nanostructures were studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (UV8000A, METASH). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were obtained on PHI5000 VersaProbe III. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Varian 800 FT-IR spectrometer. The electronic states of samples were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Kα X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The thickness of the GO interlayer was measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM, Seiko SPA400). The performances of solar cells were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) under irradiation of simulated solar light at an optical intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A, AM 1.5G, calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of various devices were obtained using an IPCE kit from Enli Technology Co., Ltd equipped with a standard Si crystalline solar cell as a reference. The voltage decay curves were measured at an open-circuit mode by illuminating the device under simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 for several seconds and then instantaneously switching off the light. Transient photovoltage (TPV) curves were recorded by a digital oscilloscope on a self-built system with a modulated 355 nm pulse laser as excitation. The Mott–Schottky plots were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E, Shanghai Chenhua) at a frequency of 5 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV in the dark. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves were recorded with a Horiba spectrometer excited by 510 nm laser, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded via a fluorescence spectrometer excited by a 450 nm laser. The concentration of Pb2+ was determined by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) instrument.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structure of FA-GO, in which the fluoroaniline molecule is grafted onto GO via a dehydration reaction to form an amido bond with F atom oriented out-of-the plane. Notably, we have also fabricated the aniline molecule terminated GO (An-GO) without F atoms to better highlight the advantage of fluoroaniline on defect passivation. After functionalization, which is confirmed by the detection of N/F elements (Fig. S1†) and the stretching vibration of N–H/C–F bonds and benzene ring (Fig. S2†), all the samples present a single-layered structure with lateral size of several micrometers (Fig. 1b–d) and a thickness of 1 nm according to AFM images (Fig. S3†), demonstrating no negative effect on the pristine morphology of GO. By carefully comparing XRD patterns in Fig. S4 and Table S2,† the nearly disappeared and left-shifted peak (lattice expansion) indicates that the introduction of the aniline molecule turns the semicrystalline GO into amorphous by overwhelming the interlaminar π–π interactions,26 which is beneficial for the homogeneous coverage on perovskite surface. To explore in detail the effects of termination on GO, the XPS spectra of the C 1s core-level were recorded and shown in Fig. 1e–g, which can be deconvoluted into five components including O–CO (i), CO (ii), C–O (iii), C–C (iv), and CC (v), respectively.27 Obviously, the proportion of CC bonds increases, while the oxygen-containing functional groups are significantly reduced for An-GO and FA-GO, an indicator of self-reduction of GO. This can be cross-checked by Raman spectra (Fig. S5†). For a typical graphene material, two feature peaks centered at 1550 cm−1 (G peak) and 1360 cm−1 (D peak) always correspond to the bond-stretching motion of the sp2-bonded carbon atoms and edge defects, respectively.28 Therefore, the reduced peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) undoubtedly confirms the above conclusion. The mechanism behind this phenomenon can be attributed to the spontaneous charge transfer from the edged oxygen-containing groups to the grafted organic molecules due to the p–π conjugation effect with the adjacent benzene ring, i.e., the diversity of electron constraint capacity.

UPS spectroscopy was further obtained to reveal the evolution of the band-edge electronic structure of GO. From the secondary electron cut-off spectra and valence band regions in Fig. 1h, the work functions (WFs) are determined to be 4.47, 4.64, and 4.67 eV with valence band maximum of −5.01, −5.08, and −5.09 eV for GO, An-GO and FA-GO, respectively, indicating a p-type doping of GO, which is in high accordance with previous reports.22,23 This conclusion can be further cross-checked by the reduced surface potential for terminated GO with the order of GO > An-GO > FA-GO in Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM) images (Fig. 1i). Considering the energy level of CsPbIBr2 in this study (see Fig. S6†),29 the reduced energy barrier at the perovskite/FA-GO heterointerface will inevitably accelerate the interfacial charge transfer and suppress the charge delocalization upon assembly into solar cells. More importantly, it is well known that the presence of fluorine atom can heal the under-coordinated Pb2+ induced by the soft perovskite lattice, playing the role of a Lewis base. Evident details about the interaction between FA-GO and perovskite film are deduced from the XPS peak shift of the Pb 4f core level, as shown in Fig. 1j, and nearly unchanged feature of Cs 1s, I 2p and Br 1s XSP spectra in Fig. S7.† For the CsPbIBr2/An-GO film, there is a slight shift to a higher binding energy, mainly attributed to the formation of the Pb–O bond with dangling oxygen-containing groups, which can be cross-checked by the shift in the binding energy in the O 1s core-level spectra (Fig. S8†).30 However, a three-fold shift with 0.58 eV for CsPbIBr2/FA-GO is achieved, indicating a stronger interaction under the presence of F atoms with larger electronegativity (see the electrostatic potential mapping images of two molecules in Fig. 1k); that is, Pb–F bonds.31
Based on the above-mentioned characterizations, the visual mechanism for FA-GO as an interfacial modulator is illustrated in Fig. 1l. On the one hand, the charge transfer induced self-reduction and p-type doping of GO effectively accelerates the charge extraction and inhibits the charge localization within the GO surface; on the other hand, the formation of Pb–F and Pb–O chemical bonds benefits the defect passivation. As a result, the charge nonradiative recombination is expected to be minimized, allowing a high-performance PSC.32–34
As shown in Fig. 2a, we have fabricated CsPbIBr2 PSC with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbIBr2/GO/carbon to better understand the effect of GO on photovoltaic performance. The perovskite film was made via a one-step spin-coating method, which can be found in the Experimental section, displaying a compact and pinhole-free morphology (Fig. 2b, and the other detailed characterizations have been also provided in Fig. S9†). Arising from the strong interaction, the large-scale GO nanosheets spread well on the surface of the perovskite film to form a stable heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 2c and S10,† which can be further cross-checked by the uniform distribution of F and N atoms from EDS elemental mapping images (Fig. S11 and S12†). Fig. 2d and Table 1 show the typical current–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of various PSCs. Obviously, compared to the control device with a PCE of only 7.75% under one standard sun illumination, the efficiency is gradually increased to 8.22%, 9.83% and 11.08% after incorporating GO, An-GO and FA-GO onto the perovskite interface, respectively. The superiority of the latter scenario undoubtedly contributes to the simultaneous interface energetics regulation and defect passivation, which is beneficial for reducing hysteresis (Fig. S13†). By plotting the statistical photovoltaic parameters from 20 devices for four batches, as shown in Fig. 2e and S14,† it can be found that the efficiency enhancement is a consequence of increased Voc from 1.253 V to 1.318 V and Jsc from 10.11 mA cm−2 to 11.87 mA cm−2; alternatively, a significantly reduced recombination loss is observed. To further ensure the reliable performance, EQE spectra and steady-state power outputs under bias at maximum output power points of various PSCs were recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 2f and g. As expected, the device with GO exhibits higher integrated current density and steady-state efficiency in an order of FA-GO > An-GO > GO > control, agreeing well with the results in J–V curves and confirming the positive effect of terminated FA on charge scavenging.

To clearly reveal the intrinsic reason for the performance enhancement of PSC, the carrier recombination features were studied by characterizing PL and TRPL decay spectra of perovskite films under the presence of GO. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL peak intensity of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film centered at 595 nm is sharply quenched upon introducing GO, An-GO and FA-GO interlayers, respectively. It is well known that the PL intensity highly depends on the defect state density and charge extraction efficiency.35 For the former, by recording the dark J–V curves of electron-only devices according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mode (Fig. S15†), it can be concluded that the detrimental defects are effectively healed owing to the smaller trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) by forming Pb–O and Pb–F bonds.20,36 Considering that the defect passivation generally induces higher PL intensity,37 therefore, the reverse evolution in Fig. 3a undoubtedly indicates a more efficient carrier extraction behavior from the perovskite film to GO due to the suppressed charge localization and matchable energy level, leaving more positive holes accumulated on the surface of the perovskite film under light irradiation (the higher surface photovoltage in Fig. S16†). This result is echoed by the faster PL decay and shorter average carrier lifetime from 1.143 to 0.269 ns after FA-GO modification (Fig. 3b and Table S3†).

To further elucidate the effect of this heterostructure on corresponding solar cells, the relationship between capacitance and voltage (C–V curve) was conducted to determine the built-in electric field (Vbi) based on the Mott–Schottky equation. As shown in Fig. 3c, the derived Vbi values of PSCs follow an order of FA-GO (1.46 V) > An-GO (1.45 V) > GO (1.42 V) > control (1.37 V), an evident indicator of a larger driving force for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and a wider depletion region for suppressing carrier recombination.38,39 Furthermore, the largest slop for FA-GO tailored PSC also demonstrates the lowest interfacial trap density owing to their inversely proportional relationship. Together with the reduced ideality factor from 1.87 kT/q to 1.54 kT/q upon toughening of the CsPbIBr2 surface with FA-GO, derived from the dependence of Voc as a function of incident light intensity (I), as shown in Fig. 3d, the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the optimal device has been significantly suppressed;40,41 that is, a longer carrier lifetime in solar cell (Fig. S17†), resulting in decreased leakage current density (Fig. S18†). Following the above analyses, the dual-functional FA-terminated GO shows great potential for promoting the application of GO in high-performance PSC.
Great weatherability is another inevitable criterion for future commercialization of PSCs.42 In this fashion, we have evaluated the environmental tolerance of the control and champion devices without encapsulation by recording the efficiency evolution at room temperature (25 °C) and 10% relative humidity (RH). As shown in Fig. 4a, the FA-GO tailored device still maintains 87% of initial efficiency over 80 days storage; however, the PCE of the control device quickly drops down to 58% of the initial value within 71 days. The self-encapsulation of GO to inhibit the penetration of external O2 or water vapor to destroy the underlying perovskite crystalline is responsible for the improved longevity owing to the presence of hydrophobic F atoms (Fig. S19†).43,44 Particularly, under persistent illumination at temperature of 25 °C and RH of 30%, the PCE conservation rate for the optimal device without encapsulation is remarkably higher than that of the control device (Fig. 4b). Considering ion migration as a fatal factor to facilitate the degradation process because of the compositional segregation, morphological change and irreversible chemical reaction with electrode,45–47 we have further characterized the cross-sectional element mapping images of two PSCs. As shown in Fig. S20,† the smaller lattice parameter of the graphene structure (0.246 nm) can hinder the substantial Pb2+, Cs+ and I− ion diffusion into the upper carbon electrode, playing the role of a “sieve” to protect the perovskite film.

(d) Optical photographs of Pb ions testing paper, (e) UV-Vis spectra and (f) Pb concentrations of solar cells with and without FA-GO after immersing in deionized water. 
Based on the above conclusion, we hold a point that the strong interaction between FA-GO and CsPbIBr2 will slow down the escape of harmful Pb2+ from the destroyed PSC, as illustrated in Fig. 4c. By immersing the carbon-based device free of encapsulation (with 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm area) into 5 mL deionized water for 3 min, as shown in Fig. 4e, the reduced absorbance intensity around 300 nm suggests the lower Pb2+ concentration in the final solution, which can be intuitively reflected by the color difference of Pb-indicator paper (Fig. 4d). ICP-MS characterization demonstrates that the Pb2+ concentration dramatically decreased from the average value of 32.2 ppm for the control device to 18.1 ppm for the FA-GO containing one (Fig. 4f), indicating that over 43.8% of Pb2+ ions are confined within the solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the FA terminated GO as an interface modulator to simultaneously regulate the carrier transfer kinetics, passivate the surface defect, improve the long-term stability and minimize the Pb2+ leakage. Compared to the pristine GO, the amidation reaction between the aniline molecule and GO results in self-reduction owing to the charge transfer from the oxygen-containing groups on the GO surface to aniline, benefiting the charge delocalization, which in turn increases the WF and therefore accelerates charge extraction. In addition, the defective perovskite surface healed owing to the presence of F atoms, consequently delivering an increased efficiency as high as 11.08% with good stability under air conditions over 80 days with persistent light irradiation. Considering the role of “sieve” to suppress ion migration and Pb2+ leakage, our findings provide a prototype in rationally designing the GO termination to realize the green and sustainable utilization of solar energy.
