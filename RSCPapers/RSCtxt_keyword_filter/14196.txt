    , Accepted 2nd September 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractWe demonstrate that the δ to α phase transition temperature of formamidinium-based perovskites is reduced by ∼50 °C through the incorporation of ∼2 wt% γ-butyrolactone (GBL) into the crystal lattice. The intercalation of GBL is found to expand the unit cell of the δ-phase, reducing the energy barrier for thermal conversion.
Metal halide perovskites with ABX3 structure, where A stands for methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+), B for lead or tin, and X for halide (I, Br or Cl), have attracted tremendous attention as light absorbers for photovoltaic applications.1 The organic cations that occupy the A-site can freely rotate within the cage comprised of PbI6 octahedra2 and hence give the system a relatively high degree of freedom. Due to the stronger molecular interaction between FA and the surrounding iodide ions, FAPbI3 exhibits a higher thermal and photo stability than MAPbI3.1c,3 Moreover, the bandgap of FAPbI3 is 1.41 eV, lower than the value of 1.53 eV for MAPbI3,4 which gives the former a higher theoretical power conversion efficiency as the bandgap is better matched to the solar spectrum.5 These features make FAPbI3 in principle an attractive material for perovskite solar cells. However, FAPbI3 is unstable at room temperature and suffers from a spontaneous phase transition from the desired cubic α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase to the hexagonal δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite phase.5,6 This phase transition hinders the application of FAPbI3 for long-term solar cell applications, with the δ-phase possessing a larger bandgap and inferior electronic properties due to the chainlike PbI6 octahedron structure.6
Even though the phase transitions of FAPbI3 have been characterised by techniques such as XRD, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and neutron powder diffraction, there exists a wide range of temperatures reported for the δ to α phase transition. For example, Aguiar et al.7 reported that for FAPbI3 films, the black α-phase starts to form at 135 °C, with a processing temperature of 175 °C recommended despite evidence of PbI2 being produced. Jeon et al.6 reported an endothermic peak at 160 °C from DSC which they assigned to the phase transition temperature for FAPbI3 films. This temperature is significantly lower than the value of 185 °C reported by Han et al.3a in their DSC study of FAPbI3 single crystals. A neutron diffraction study suggested an energy barrier exists between the two phases due to the complex reconstruction of the organic cation, Pb and I anions.8 Reasons for such a large variability in the literature could be due to different sample histories and nature (i.e. thin film vs. single crystal) since the chemical and physical properties of FAPbI3 are very sensitive to the preparation methods and environment.9
Overcoming issues associated with the δ to α phase transition is important for obtaining high-quality FA-based perovskites, which is a prerequisite for solar cell applications. For example, annealing δ-FAPbI3 films at high temperature (>150 °C) often results in irreversible sample degradation.10 To date, lowering the conversion temperature of FA-based perovskites has involved the use of mixed cations such as FA+ combined with Cs+ or MA+. A study by Srinivas et al. demonstrated that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-vapour assisted annealing can facilitate the formation of pure black FAPbI3 films at 100 °C.11 Meanwhile, we noticed that by adopting the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method, black FAPbI3 crystals readily precipitated from γ-butyrolactone (GBL) at 115 °C,12 which is lower than the above-mentioned phase transition range. Here we report a simple method exploiting FAPbI3–GBL intercalation to lower the phase transition of FAPbI3 crystals from 135–150 °C to ∼100 °C. Moreover, for the mixed cation perovskite FA0.8MA0.2PbI3, the transition temperature was reduced from 115–125 °C to 40–70 °C.
First, in order to verify the effect of GBL on the conversion temperature of FAPbI3, single crystals of δ-FAPbI3 were synthesised through the anti-solvent vapour-assisted crystallization (AVC) method.13 Briefly, 1 M FAPbI3 precursor was prepared by dissolving 1:1 FAI and PbI2 powder in GBL. The yellow δ-FAPbI3 crystals gradually precipitate as a result of the slow diffusion of anti-solvent dichloromethane (DCM) into the precursor at room temperature. The filtered crystals were finely grounded and thoroughly washed by the mother liquid maximising the crystal–GBL interaction. The final filtered crystal powder was then annealed for 5 min at various temperatures in air. Ex situ XRD measurements were performed on these samples with the results shown in Fig. 1a. It is well known that δ-FAPbI3 is characterised by a strong diffraction peak at ∼12° (010) while α-FAPbI3 is characterised by a peak at ∼14° (001).9 The XRD data reveal that for these crystals, a weak peak at 14° starts to emerge at a temperature of 90 °C indicating formation of α-FAPbI3 phase. The major change however occurs at 100 °C where the α-FAPbI3 phase becomes the dominant phase. Further annealing above 100 °C inhibits the remaining δ-FAPbI3. This conversion temperature of 90–100 °C is much lower than the values reported before, as cited above.

(b) Comparison of the XRD patterns of FAPbI3 crystals with and without (removed through vacuum treatment) GBL measured at room temperature. (c) Schematic illustration of the change in crystal structure during annealing for the FAPbI3–GBL crystal. 
To demonstrate that residual GBL is incorporated into single crystal δ-FAPbI3 prepared in this fashion, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed, see Fig. S1a (ESI†), which shows a 2 wt% weight loss with heating to 105 °C. Placing these single-crystal samples under vacuum overnight was found to be effective in removing the residual GBL, with TGA analysis of vacuum treated samples showing no weight loss. Apparent differences are seen in the XRD patterns of δ-FAPbI3 crystals with and without vacuum treatment (Fig. 1b) with an overall shifting of peaks to a lower value for vacuum-treated δ-FAPbI3 crystals, compared to as-prepared δ-FAPbI3 crystals. As no new peaks are seen for the as-prepared δ-FAPbI3 crystals, these observations provide reasonable evidence that GBL molecules have intercalated into the 1D hexagonal structure and thus expand the unit cell. Fig. 1c schematically illustrates the proposed change of crystal structure during annealing for the FAPbI3–GBL crystal: interaction of GBL in δ-FAPbI3 crystals facilitates the face-sharing PbI6 octahedra transformation into the corner-sharing cubic system.14 During annealing, the hexagonal structure went through a crystal reconstruction involving thermally activated bond breakage and reformation. Through neutron diffraction and first-principles calculations, Chen et al.8 showed that the two structural states are separated by an energy barrier, and the hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition occurs at 350 K (∼77 °C). Thus, the δ → α transition is thermodynamically favourable above ∼77 °C but kinetically suppressed through an activation barrier. Our results suggest that the intercalation of GBL within the δ-FAPbI3 structure lowers the activation energy and facilitates the transition to α-FAPbI3.
We further confirm the above observed effects through ex situ Raman spectroscopy with excitation wavelength at 1064 nm, which suppress interference of the background fluorescence of the crystal samples. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the study of materials with its sensitivity to molecular and crystal lattice vibrations. We find that the intensity of the organic vibrational modes in the 250–900 cm−1 frequency range is much stronger for the cubic α-FAPbI3 phase than for the hexagonal δ-FAPbI3 phase (Fig. 2a). We thus can evaluate the phase transition extent through change of Raman intensity via a temperature-dependent study. For the GBL-free δ-FAPbI3 crystal (vacuum-treated), the intensity of the modes at 521, 595, 710 cm−1 that are related to the δ to α phase transition remain unchanged when annealed under 120 °C, and a drastic increase when annealed in the range 135–150 °C (Fig. 2b), indicating the occurrence of a phase transition. In contrast, for the FAPbI3–GBL crystal sample, the phase transition took place in the range of 90–110 °C (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with the ex situ XRD study above. The GBL in the FAPbI3–GBL crystal sample can also be identified through the typical GBL Raman features at 675, 802, 868, 930 and 1243 cm−1 (Fig. 2d) and these signals gradually disappear upon annealing at higher temperature (Fig. 2c), confirming the TGA results.

In situ XRD studies were next performed by gradually annealing the crystal powders from room temperature to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, for FAPbI3–GBL crystals, the phase transition was seen to start at 125 °C and is complete by 135 °C. In comparison, the crystal sample without GBL shows a higher onset of 135 °C with the phase transformation complete by 150 °C (Fig. 3b). Compared with the ex situ study above, the effect of intercalated GBL is not as pronounced. Examining the results of DSC measurements of these two samples (Fig. S1a, ESI†) the FAPbI3–GBL shows two peaks, one at ∼100 °C (attributed to GBL evaporation) and another at 130 °C (attributed to the FAPbI3 phase transition). For the GBL-free FAPbI3 sample, a sole peak is seen at ∼135 °C. Assuming the FAPbI3–GBL intercalation can lower the phase transition temperature, this can only occur if there is still residual GBL in the sample. Thus, the kinetics of the annealing plays an important role; if temperature is slowly increased, as in the in situ XRD experiment and DSC study, the GBL incorporated in the sample will evaporate before the transformation can take place. When the temperature is increased quickly, as in the ex situ experiment, the phase transition occurs before the GBL is completely removed. This explains why the FAPbI3–GBL sample did not show a significantly lowered phase transition temperature when annealed continuously from room temperature (in situ study of Fig. 3a). This observation also help can rationalise why different studies have observed various conversion temperatures.
 Fig. 3  
In situ XRD measurements of (a) δ-FAPbI3 crystals interacted with GBL and (b) GBL-free δ-FAPbI3 crystals. Samples were heated from 30 to 200 °C in air at 5 °C min−1. 
From the above experiments, we have shown that the intercalation of GBL within the δ-FAPbI3 single crystals facilitates the δ → α phase transition at a lower temperature. Films were next studied to investigate whether this effect can also be observed in films. PbI2 and FAI salts were dissolved in either GBL or dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a 1 M precursor solution. 30 μL of FAPbI3 precursor (either in GBL or DMF) was drop-cast onto a glass substrate that was placed on a hotplate and the resulting films each annealed for 5 min at various temperatures in air, matching the conditions of the ex situ experiment of Fig. 1a. The ex situ XRD data (Fig. S2a, ESI†) reveals that for films drop-cast from GBL, a weak peak at 14.1° (001) starts to emerge at 90 °C indicating the formation of the α-FAPbI3 phase. Further elevation of temperature leads to a stronger 14.1° peak and a weaker 12° peak, indicating the conversion from one phase to the other upon an increase in temperature. Finally, the δ-FAPbI3 phase was fully inhibited above 110 °C, which is consistent with the finding in the single crystal format. In contrast, when films were prepared from DMF, the major phase transition was found at a higher temperature, ∼130–150 °C (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The large difference in terms of the phase transition temperature highlights the role of GBL during the crystallization of α-FAPbI3. Although both samples have the same set of diffraction peaks for the same phase, the relative peak intensity varies. This observation may reflect different orientations in films prepared from different organic solvents. Meanwhile, we have compared perovskite solar cell performance for FAPbI3 by preparing in GBL and DMF, and the former shows a slightly better performance, even though the efficiency of both sets decreases upon extended aging time, indicating the phase transition to δ-FAPbI3 (Fig. S3, ESI†). Thus the long-term stability of devices prepared using this low temperature route will need addressing in future work.
Lastly, to study the effect of GBL on the mixed cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 system in terms of phase transition, we synthesised FAxMA1−xPbI3 single crystals with a series of compositions. From the powder XRD patterns (Fig. S4a, ESI†), it can be seen that there is still a strong diffraction signal at 12.1° corresponding to the δ-FAPbI3 phase for FA0.8MA0.2PbI3, while this peak is not present when decreasing the FA composition to x = 0.6 and below (Fig. S4a, ESI†). After annealing at 150 °C for 5 min in air, all samples show complete conversion to the α-phase (Fig. S4b, ESI†). Comparing the UV-vis absorbance spectra before and after annealing (Fig. S5, ESI†), no significant phase transition is observed for those samples with FA composition more than 0.4. For the annealed samples the peak at ∼28° can be assigned to the (002) planes of cubic α-FAPbI3, which is shifted to a higher diffraction angle with a decrease in the FA:MA cation ratio in the precursor solution. This was due to the reduction of lattice parameters of the crystals upon the partial substitution of FA by MA molecules. It should be noted that it is still controversial in the literature whether the actual compositions in the crystal is the same as in precursor due to a contradictory report from a NMR study.15 Thus, here we only aim to provide an overall XRD trend upon the change of FA/MA ratio.
Thus far, there has been no report of determining the phase transition temperature for FAxMA1−xPbI3. Fig. 4a presents the results of an in situ study of GBL-free FA0.8MA0.2PbI3. The peak at ∼12.3° for δ-FAPbI3 was found to start to decrease from 115 °C and is completely disappeared by 125 °C, which is consistent with the endothermic peak found at around 115 °C with DSC (Fig. S6a, ESI†). Both XRD and DSC confirm that the incorporation of 20% MA incorporation into FAPbI3 not only partly inhibits the δ-FAPbI3 phase, but also lowers the phase transition temperature for the mixed cation sample. In contrast, for the FA0.8MA0.2PbI3–GBL sample, ex situ XRD found the relative peak intensity between 12° and 14.1° started to change at a very low temperature, i.e., 40 °C, with α-FAPbI3 as the dominating phase by 50 °C, and the δ-FAPbI3 phase fully inhibited at 70 °C (Fig. 4b). From DSC for this sample, the endothermic peak was found at around 105 °C rather than ∼70 °C (Fig. S6b, ESI†) with this discrepancy explained using the same rationale as stated above. As FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 has a FA/MA ratio similar to the best performing solar cell with a common annealing temperature of 150 °C used for solar cell fabrication,5,16 the use of GBL could significantly lower the processing temperature required to fully covert the residual δ-FAPbI3 to the α-phase. Thus, our study provides a broader annealing temperature spectrum for solar cell processing.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of GBL into the lattice of δ-phase FAPI3 dramatically lowers the temperature required for transformation to the α-phase. This effect was observed for both single-crystal samples and films. In particular, the intercalation of GBL in the δ-FAPbI3 crystal structure facilitates the face-sharing PbI6 octahedra transformation into the corner-sharing cubic system over a temperature range of 90–110 °C, compared to 135–150 °C for the GBL-free sample. For the mixed cation system FA0.8MA0.2PbI3, GBL incorporation enabled phase transformation to be initiated at 40 °C and complete by 70 °C, which is much lower than 115–125 °C for samples without GBL assistance. Avoiding high temperature annealing is not only energy-efficient for practical large-scale solar cell manufacturing, but also prevents film degradation, which is a common issue in lab-processed perovskite films.
