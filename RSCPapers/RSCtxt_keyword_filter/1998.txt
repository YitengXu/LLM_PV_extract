Broader context
The research on dyestuffs is of great importance in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells. A photosensitizer functions not only as the carrier photogenerator, but also as the barrier controlling the back electron-transfer reaction, which is of paramount importance for the photovoltage output. Apart from the ruthenium and zinc coordinate complex light-absorbers, metal-free organic dyes have attracted enormous research efforts in recent years in spite of their so far relatively lower efficiencies. In this paper, we have valued the feasibility of derivatizing the chromophoric core of cyclopentadithiophene-benzothiadiazole to obtain organic photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells with over 11% power efficiencies.

Substantial efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 have been devoted to the quest for powerful dyes, bearing the signs of reduced energy gaps and enhanced molar absorption coefficients, to harvest more solar photons.2 The state-of-the-art DSC dyes are ruthenium polypyridine3 and zinc porphyrin4 complexes, which have been shown to convert solar light to electricity at a power efficiency of about 12%. Meanwhile, metal-free organic dyes featuring intramolecular charge transfer transitions have been attracting increasing attention owing to the abundance of the raw materials and the flexibility of their molecular design.2g–k In this context, cyanoacrylic acid has been utilized as the electron acceptor for a large portion of the numerous organic DSC dyes so far.5 Herein we will start from the chromophoric core of cyclopentadithiophene-benzothiadiazole (CPDT-BT) to devise efficient DSC dyes.6
With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we first scrutinized the energy level and energy gap evolutions in the CPDT-BT derivatization by sequentially tethering triphenylamine (TPA) and benzoic acid (BA) in two patterns, going either from CPDT-BT to TPA-BT-CPDT and then to C257, or from CPDT-BT to TPA-CPDT-BT and then to C258. Their molecular structures are displayed within Fig. 1. Note that TPA2g,2h,2j,5c and BA2f,7 have been respectively used as the electron donating and molecular anchoring moieties in the design of DSC dyes. As outlined in Fig. 1, the path linking the electron-rich segments of TPA and CPDT has a more profound influence on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) upwards movement than that attaching the electron-rich TPA with the electron-deficient BT. In addition, a negligible impact on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels is observed for both TPA attachment strategies. Furthermore, directly linking BA to BT has a more noticeable effect on the LUMO downwards displacement than attaching BA with CPDT. Moreover, no significant impact on the HOMO levels is perceived for the BA attachment.
 Fig. 1  Theoretical HOMO (red line) and LUMO (blue line) energy levels of the herein studied chromophores in THF calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. Their respective chemical structures are displayed in the middle of the panel. 
As listed in Table S1,† the theoretical wavelength (λcalcmax) of the maximum absorbance obtained from the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations are in general consistent with the theoretical HOMO/LUMO energy gaps of C257 and C258. However, a simple analysis of the HOMO/LUMO energy gaps for the TPA-BT-CPDT and TPA-CPDT-BT isomers does not give a correct indication of their λcalcmax. The absorption bands for all of these five chromophores stem completely or mainly from the charge transfer transition from HOMO to LUMO. However a more sizable contribution from the transition between HOMO−1 and LUMO is noted for TPA-CPDT-BT with respect to TPA-BT-CPDT, clarifying the apparent inconsistency between the theoretical HOMO/LUMO energy gap and the wavelength of maximum absorbance for the TPA-CPDT-BT and TPA-BT-CPDT isomers. As presented in Fig. S1,† there are considerable distributions of LUMOs for CPDT-BT, TPA-BT-CPDT, C257, TPA-CPDT-BT and C258, on the BT moiety, suggesting its dominant electron-withdrawing role. Actually, the BA segment in C257 and C258 only functions as a weaker electron acceptor. The experimental wavelengths (λmeasmax) of maximum absorbance of the five chromophores are compiled in Table S1† and nicely reproduce the theoretical values calculated by TDDFT. The bathochromic and hyperchromic shifts obtained by extending the π-conjugation through resonance could be easily understood for the two structural evolution patterns.
The monochromatic incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSCs based on the C257 and C258 dyes were first compared through the use of the tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-bpy) redox couple. Details of the cell fabrication are described in ESI.† As presented in Fig. 2A, a ∼60 nm red-shift of the onset wavelength of photocurrent response can be noticed for the C258 dye in comparison with C257, which is in general consistent with the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2B) of dye-grafted titania films. In consideration of both the comparable efficiencies of green photon absorption (Fig. 2B) and electron injection (Fig. S3†) for cells made from C257 and C258, we deduce that the variation in charge collection efficiency may contribute to their IPCE height difference.8 This has been further verified by recording the photocurrent action spectrum of a C258 control cell with the tris(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-dmbpy) electrolyte, which actually does not impact on the light absorption (Fig. 2B). Note that an improved charge collection efficiency could be expected by attenuating the kinetics of charge recombination between the photogenerated electrons in titania and cobalt(III) ions in the cell employing the Co-dmbpy redox couple, which has a lower redox potential and a larger diameter than Co-bpy.

(B) Absorption spectra of the 4.6 μm-thick, dye-grafted translucent titania films in contact with the cobalt electrolytes for cell fabrication. The absorption of a reference cell without dye-grafting has been subtracted for clarity of presentation. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (j–V) curves (Fig. 3A) of the Co-bpy cells made from C257 and C258 were further measured at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM 1.5 sunlight. The C257 dye exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc) of 15.34 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 887 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.728, giving a power conversion efficiency (η) of 10.0%. However, C258 with a smaller energy gap in comparison with C257 presents a very slightly improved jsc of 15.58 mA cm−2 and an over 70 mV decrease in Voc, resulting in a remarkably reduced η of 8.9%. As shown in Table 1, the measured jsc values for the C257 cell are proportional to the various AM 1.5 irradiances (G), and are very close to the photocurrent densities (jcalcsc) predicted by integrating its IPCE spectrum measured at lower light irradiances over the whole AM 1.5 spectrum; however, for the C258 cell there is a ∼8% negative deviation of the one-sun jsc from jcalcsc, i.e. a 1.33 mA cm−2 smaller experimental value, while its higher photocurrents over its C257 counterpart can be perceived at lower light irradiances. The photocurrent loss for the C258 cell under full sunlight irradiance could be ascribed to the charge recombination of photogenerated electrons in the titania with the oxidized form of C258 and/or cobalt(III) ions.

One can easily perceive from Fig. 3B that at a certain jsc the C258 cell has a diminished Voc compared to the C257 counterpart. It is widely recognized that for a fixed redox electrolyte, the Voc of a DSC is determined by the electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) in titania, which is in nature correlated with the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and electron density. At a certain carrier photogeneration flux, the electron density is controlled by the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons in titania, which can be captured by the oxidized forms of the dye molecules and cobalt(III) ions. As Fig. 3C presents, the titania films grafted with C257 and C258 store a similar charge (Q) at the same potential bias or Voc, suggesting an invariable conduction-band edge of titania with respect to the electrolyte Fermi-level. As depicted in Fig. 3D, the electron lifetime (τn) in the C258 cell at a certain extracted charge is reduced by nearly one order of magnitude with respect to that in the C257 cell, giving evidence of the aforementioned photovoltage dissimilarity. However, we consider that the information on electron lifetime is not sufficient to realize the further rational design of the DSC dyes. For example, it is actually not easy to predict the relative electron lifetime for the titania films grafted by the two isomeric dyes C257 and C258. Therefore it could be highly instructive to have a basic understanding of the surface microstructure of the dye-grafted titania films.
In some previous papers,9 the Ti2p signal intensity (I) recorded in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments10 could be nicely associated with the rate of charge recombination between the electrons in titania and electron-capturing species in the DSC electrolytes. We herein examined again the damping effect of a dye coating on the photoelectron emission from titania to the vacuum, and also recorded evident attenuations of both the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 signals for the C257 and C258 grafted titania films with respect to the bare control (Fig. 4A). If a compact dye layer is simply assumed to be located on the surface of the titania, the Ti2p3/2 signal intensity can be quantitatively related to the mean thickness (d1) of the “compact” dye layer, via a two-layer model I = I0exp(−d1/λsinα),11 where I0 is the signal intensity of a bare titania substrate, α the electron take-off angle of 90° and λ the inelastic electron mean free path (IMFP) in a compact organic solid composed of the dye molecules. The same λ value of the two geometric isomers C257 and C258, being 31.7 Å, was computed with the aid of some semi-empirical equations and parameters from the literature,12 and the d1 values of dye coatings on titania were further derived as 21.8 Å for C257 and 29.3 Å for C258, in terms of the Ti2p3/2 intensities. The d1 tendency can be well understood by looking at the measured dye load amount: 1.59 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C257; 1.90 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C258.

(B) Measured (symbols) and calculated (solid line) X-ray reflectivity curves for the bare (green star) and dye-grafted ALD titania films (blue square for C257 and red triangle for C258). For clarity, each curve is offset by 10−2 with respect to the previous one. (C) Pictorial representation of the self-assembled dye layer of C257 (left) and C258 (right) on the titania surface. 
There is, however, a clear breakdown of the positive relationship between the thicknesses of compact dye layers estimated using XPS and the electron lifetimes estimated using the transient photovoltage decay (TPD) method. This phenomenon has also been observed in our recent study13 on another system and can be ascribed to the porous features of the organic coating layer on the titania. In addition, one may argue that the electron lifetime estimated by TPD may have included a contribution from the recombination of photogenerated electrons with the oxidized forms of the dye molecules. Thereby in Fig. S4† we also present the dark current–voltage curves, which mainly reflect the recombination of electrons in titania with the cobalt electrolytes. Thereby, we further investigated the mean thicknesses (d2) for “incompact” dye layers composed of the two dye isomers grafted on the surface of a planar titania made by the atom layer deposition (ALD) method with X-ray reflectometry (XRR).9e,14 A two-layer model (the inset of Fig. 4B) was employed to fit the initial reflectivity profiles of the dye-grafted ALD titania films and the calculated d2 values are very similar, being 24.2 and 23.7 Å for C257 and C258, respectively. Also, the simulated value of the X-ray scattering length density (SLD) for C258 (12.3 × 10−6 Å−2) is larger than that for C257 (10.5 × 10−6 Å−2), suggesting a smaller average porosity for the C258 dye layer. The combined information on the d2 and SLD values from XRR is in rough accord with the d1 value determined using XPS. To gain insights on the origin of different dye load amounts and dye layer average porosities for the two isomeric dyes, we also looked at their molecular geometries (Fig. S5†) but did not obtain very instructive information. The stronger dye–dye intermolecular interaction for C258 could be correlated to its larger dipole moment of 11.5 Debye in comparison with that of 8.5 Debye for C257.
With combined information from the molecular geometry simulations as well as the dye loading amount, XPS, XRR and electrical measurements, we thereby imagine that with respect to the C257 dye layer, there may be more penetration channels in the C258 dye layer, albeit that is composed of a larger number of dye molecules, which is illustrated by the left panel of Fig. 4C. These nanochannels allows the relatively smaller Co(III)-bpy ions to penetrate and thus to be in closer proximity to the surface of titania. On the other hand, although the C257 dye molecules form a larger porosity organic coating on the surface of titania, the diameter of the resultant pores should be mostly smaller than that of the Co(III)-bpy ions. It can also be deduced that in the C257 coating there is a relatively homogeneous distribution of medium pores, but for the C258 counterpart, small and large pores exist simultaneously. Our findings presented here suggest the critical microstructural influence of penetration and exclusion via nanochannels in the dye layer upon charge recombination, apart from the previous notions on the dye load amount and the dye layer thickness associated with the molecular length and molecular orientation.
On the basis of the preceding fundamental comprehensions, we tried to remove the penetration channels for the cobalt(III) ions by co-grafting C258 with the C239 dye (Fig. 5A), which has been identified by us to feature a superior ability to control the interfacial charge recombination, albeit a very poor light-harvesting capacity.15 The j–V curve at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM 1.5 sunlight, is shown in Fig. 5B and the cell parameters jsc, Voc, FF and η are 18.28 mA cm−2, 855 mV, 0.715 and 11.2%, respectively. As compiled in Table 2, the measured jsc values are very close to the values predicted via wavelength integration of the measured IPCE spectrum (Fig. 5C) over the standard AM 1.5 emission spectrum. At a lower light irradiance, the cell efficiencies are even higher, up to 12.2%, mainly owing to the excellent fill factors. Moreover, the elaborately tailored C259 dye (Fig. 5A) exhibits even higher efficiencies, in the range from 11.5% to 12.8%, owing to the improved photovoltages presented in Fig. 5B and Table 2. Our work has set a new benchmark for organic dye-sensitized solar cells.

Broader context
The research on dyestuffs is of great importance in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells. A photosensitizer functions not only as the carrier photogenerator, but also as the barrier controlling the back electron-transfer reaction, which is of paramount importance for the photovoltage output. Apart from the ruthenium and zinc coordinate complex light-absorbers, metal-free organic dyes have attracted enormous research efforts in recent years in spite of their so far relatively lower efficiencies. In this paper, we have valued the feasibility of derivatizing the chromophoric core of cyclopentadithiophene-benzothiadiazole to obtain organic photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells with over 11% power efficiencies.


 	Fig. 1  Theoretical HOMO (red line) and LUMO (blue line) energy levels of the herein studied chromophores in THF calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. Their respective chemical structures are displayed in the middle of the panel.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) Photocurrent action spectra of the dye-grafted bilayer (4.6 + 4.7 μm) titania films in conjunction with the cobalt electrolytes. An anti-reflection film was adhered to a testing cell during the IPCE measurement. Aperture area of the employed metal mask: 0.158 cm−2. (B) Absorption spectra of the 4.6 μm-thick, dye-grafted translucent titania films in contact with the cobalt electrolytes for cell fabrication. The absorption of a reference cell without dye-grafting has been subtracted for clarity of presentation.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) j–V characteristic curves of the C257 and C258 cells with a Co-bpy electrolyte measured at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM 1.5 sunlight. An anti-reflection film was adhered to the testing cell during the j–V measurement. Aperture area of the employed metal mask: 0.158 cm−2. (B) Comparison of the open-circuit photovoltages at a certain short-circuit photocurrent density. (C) Comparison of the charges extracted from the C257 and C258 grafted titania films at a certain open-circuit photovoltage. (D) Comparison of the electron lifetimes at a certain charge extracted from the C257 and C258 grafted titania films.
