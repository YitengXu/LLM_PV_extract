    , Accepted 13th February 2014First published on 17th February 2014AbstractHere we present a comprehensive investigation of TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junction solar cells with different back contacts (Au, ITO, Cu or Ag). Combinatorial hetero-junction libraries consisting of a linear TiO2 thickness gradient produced by spray pyrolysis and a bell shaped Cu2O profile synthesized by pulsed laser deposition were chosen to investigate the impact of the two metal oxide layer thicknesses. The back contacts were deposited as round patches onto a grid of 13 × 13 points, 169 contacts for each contact material, forming a library containing 4 × 13 × 13 = 676 back contacts. Each back contact represented a solar cell with an individual TiO2 and Cu2O thickness. I–V measurements show that all four materials provide an ohmic contact and that the open circuit voltage of ∼300 mV is rather independent of both layer thicknesses and contact material. The size of the Cu2O crystals drastically decreases with distance from the center of deposition, which leads to a drastic increase of series resistance when the crystal size is <50 nm.
Introduction
The market for photovoltaic (PV) modules has shown exponential growth over the last few years, yet in most places PV generated electricity still relies on subsidies.1,2 To achieve grid parity, further price reductions are required, which might be achieved by up-scaling existing production processes. However, larger price reductions could be achieved using new PV materials that, ideally, should be cheap, non-hazardous, and easy to manufacture using low cost fabrication methods.
Metal oxide (MO) semiconductors are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications; many MOs are abundant, non-toxic, and chemically stable, which enable material deposition under ambient conditions.3 Today, MOs are already widely used as components in commercially available solar cells as transparent conducting front electrodes, or as window layers, which improve the selectivity for electron collection at the front contact. In PV technologies based on nano-composite materials such as dye-sensitized solar cells,4 perovskite-sensitized solar cells,5–7 quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells,8–10 and extremely thin absorber solar cells,11 MO nano-structures are used to provide a very high microscopic surface area for a thin absorber layer.
All-oxide photovoltaic hetero-junction cells are presently attracting significant attention, with ZnO–Cu2O being the most investigated system.12–17 The wide band gap ZnO window layer acts as an electron transport layer, while Cu2O is the light absorber with a band gap of around 2 eV.18 Remarkable photovoltages of 690 mV with light to electric power conversion efficiencies of up to 3.8% have been reported recently for ZnO–Cu2O hetero-junction cells.14 With an alternative window layer such as Ga2O3 higher photovoltages of up to 800 mV and a light to electric power conversion efficiency of 5.4% were achieved.19 This calls for the investigation of novel MOs and MO hetero-junctions, for further progress in the field of all-oxide photovoltaics.20,21
Combinatorial material science is a powerful tool for rapid screening of new material compositions22,23 for a wide range of applications such as catalysis,24 passivation,25 solid state electrolytes26 or solar water splitting.27 In organic photovoltaics combinatorial methods have been used for the development of fullerene blends.28 Here we apply the concept of combinatorial material science to the field of all-oxide photovoltaics.29 In contrast to ZnO–Cu2O hetero-junctions TiO2–Cu2O solar cells are much less investigated.20,30 We present combinatorial TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junction device libraries for a comprehensive investigation of how the thickness of both MO layers affects the solar cell performance using Au, ITO, Cu, and Ag as four different back contact materials. The implementation of combinatorial material science in photovoltaics allows understanding from a single device library the importance of crystal size, the inherent voltage limitation of a specific hetero-junction, and the role of the back contact.
Experimental
Spray pyrolysis of TiO2
Commercially available fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass substrates with a size of 71.2 × 71.2 mm2 and a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) were thoroughly washed with soap, rinsed with ethanol followed by de-ionized water, and were dried under a dry air stream. Compact TiO2 layers were deposited by spray pyrolysis, where the substrates were placed onto a Ceran hotplate (Harry Gestigkeit GmbH). A precursor solution of 0.1 M titanium tetraisopropoxide and 0.1 M acetylacetone in ethanol and isopropanol (mixing ratio 1:1) was sprayed using a pneumatic spray nozzle (Spraying Systems Co.) onto the substrates at a hotplate temperature of 450 °C. The nozzle was mounted onto a commercial x–y–z scanner (EAS GmbH),31,32 the precursor flow rate of 60 cm3 h−1 was controlled using a syringe pump (Razel Scientific Instruments), while clean dehumidified compressed air, at a flow rate of 6 l min−1, was used as a carrier gas. The x–y scan velocity was 30 mm s−1, and the nozzle to substrate distance was approximately 6.9 cm. For combinatorial device fabrication a linear thickness gradient was produced using a series of spray cycles with a successively decreasing scan area.
Pulsed laser deposition of Cu2O
The Cu2O absorber was deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a commercial system (Neocera) consisting of a KrF excimer laser with an emission wavelength of 248 nm (Coherent, CompexPro102). The square substrates were placed into the PLD system in front of the radiative heating stage using a custom-made sample holder. Deposition was carried out at a target to sample distance of 67 mm, a heater temperature of 400 °C, and an Ar pressure of 150 mTorr. A laser fluence inside the vacuum chamber of 70 mJ and a laser spot size of 7.2 mm2 were measured, corresponding to an energy density of ∼1 J cm−2. Deposition was carried out using a Cu2O target with a purity of 99.9% (Kurt J. Lesker Co.). To achieve the inhomogeneous thickness profile required for combinatorial device libraries, the target was ablated by 60000 laser pulses at a repetition rate of 5 Hz without sample rotation.
Deposition of electrical contacts
For I–V characterization the FTO substrate served as a transparent conducting front electrode. To provide a good electrical contact to the measurement system, the TiO2 and Cu2O layers were mechanically removed close to the library edges using a diamond pen, followed by ultrasonic soldering (MBR Electronics) of a thin frame of a soldering alloy around the device library.
As back contacts, a grid of 13 × 13 metal patches was deposited either by sputtering or by thermal evaporation onto the Cu2O layer using a shadow mask. Each contact patch had a diameter of 1.8 mm, corresponding to an area of ∼0.026 cm2, which defined the solar cell area. Rotating the shadow mask by 90°, 180° and 270° provided a way to deposit four different back contact materials, each of them on a grid of 13 × 13 contact points (see Fig. 1). In this work Au, Ag, ITO, and Cu contact patches were investigated and their thicknesses were ∼100 nm. Au, ITO, and Cu were deposited by sputtering while Ag was thermally evaporated. To provide each contact material with a good electrical connection to the measurement system, the ITO and Cu patches were additionally covered with a 40 nm thick layer of Au.

(c) Joint thickness profile of the absorber deposited onto the linear TiO2 gradient. (d) Cross-section and top view of a combinatorial device library. The FTO layer serves as a joint front contact which is electrically connected via an ultrasonically soldered tin alloy frame (red). Four arrays of 13 × 13 round back contacts have been used to investigate different back contact materials. Each contact patch defines a single PV cell. 
Structural characterization
Structural characterization of the PV cell library was carried out before deposition of the metal back contacts. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Rigaku Smartlab workstation with a θ–2θ scan range from 25° to 80° at 4 different points. SEM measurements were carried out at the same points using a Helios 600 system (FEI).
Optical characterization
Optical transmission and reflectance spectra were recorded using a home-built mapping system, consisting of a computer controlled x–y scanning table (Märzhäuser Wetzlar GmbH & Co. KG) in conjunction with a specular reflectance probe and two integrating spheres, connected by optical fibers to CCD array spectrometers (HR4000, Ocean Optics Inc.).33 Total transmittance, total reflectance, and specular reflectance were measured after the deposition of each layer.
Thickness analysis
The thickness of the TiO2 layer was determined using commercially available optical modeling software (CODE),34 fitting simulated reflection and transmission spectra, in a spectral range from 350–1000 nm, to the measured ones with the TiO2 thickness, dTiO2, as a fit parameter. The simulation was based on the OJL interband transition model35 and it was validated on different samples using SEM images of focused ion beam (FIB) produced cross-sections.
The Cu2O thickness, dCu2O, was derived from total transmission (TT) and total reflectance (TR) data at 480 nm, dCu2O = α(480 nm)−1log(TT(480 nm)/(1 − TR(480 nm))), using an absorption coefficient, α = 1.4 × 105 cm−1 at 480 nm (2.58 eV).36 The Cu2O thickness derived from optical measurements was verified by thickness determination from cross-section SEM measurements taken at the maximum thickness of the deposition profile; both measured and calculated thicknesses were in good agreement with each other.
Solar cell characterization
The I–V characteristics of all 676 solar cells (169 for each contact type) were measured with a homebuilt automated scanning I–V system consisting of a Keithley 2400 source meter, an x–y scanning table (Märzhäuser Wetzlar GmbH & Co. KG) in conjunction with a motorized z-arm (Olympus/Märzhäuser Wetzlar GmbH & Co. KG) and a laser pumped Xe lamp (LDLS, from Energetics Co.), which was coupled through an optical fiber to the scanning stage. The solar cell device library was placed onto the x–y stage and mechanically clamped using metal clips, which also provided the electrical connection between the FTO via the soldered metal frame and the source meter for electrical measurements (Keithley 2400). Temporary electrical contact to each individual solar cell was established by a gold plated spring loaded tip (Ingun Prüfmittelbau GmbH), mounted onto the motorized z-arm, touching the back contact metal patch for the duration of the measurement. After each measurement was completed the tip was lifted and the x–y scanning table moved the library to the next contact patch. For each point the I–V curve was measured twice, in ascending and descending scan directions, to exclude capacitive effects due to charge trapping. Solar cells which showed a difference of more than 15% in the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), or the fill factor were not considered for further analysis, as well as I–V curves that showed less than three measurement points in the quadrant of photovoltaic action.
The light spectrum of the Xe lamp was adjusted to the sun spectrum using an AM1.5G filter. Furthermore, a long pass filter was used to suppress all photons with a wavelength shorter than 400 nm, in order to exclude the excitation of electron–hole pairs within the TiO2. The illumination was confined to a round spot with a diameter of ∼6 mm using a collimating lens. The light intensity of 95.4 mW cm−2 (corresponding to the AM1.5G spectrum without photons that have a wavelength below 400 nm) was adjusted by neutral density filters and by varying the distance between the collimator lens and the device library.
Data acquisition
Labview programming was used to control the scanning systems for optical and solar cell characterization and for data acquisition. Solar cell parameters from the I–V curves were derived using a Matlab script while Gnuplot was used for graphical data representation.
Results and discussion
A scheme of the combinatorial TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junction solar cell library with four different grids of back contacts is shown in Fig. 1. The thickness profile of the linear TiO2 gradient is schematically shown in Fig. 1a (top) while the bottom shows TiO2 thickness data ranging from 200 to 500 nm derived from optical measurements. The bell-shaped Cu2O profile in Fig. 1b can be approximately described by:37,38 d(x,y) = d0cosnx(αx)cosny(αy)(1)withαx = arctan((x − x0)/h)andαy = arctan((y − y0)/h),using the substrate coordinates x and y and the maximum deposition thickness d0 at the center of the plasma plume located at (x0, y0). The distance between the FTO substrate and the Cu2O target is denoted by h, and the exponents nx and ny depend on PLD parameters such as pressure in the deposition chamber, laser power, and laser focus on the target.38,39 Thickness data derived from optical measurements are shown at the bottom of Fig. 1b with a maximum thickness of 200 nm, located at the top edge of the library, slightly off-centered towards the left side. The sum of the TiO2 and Cu2O thickness profiles is shown in Fig. 1c.
Structural analysis was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2 shows measurements taken at four different points of the hetero-junction library from the top at the highest Cu2O thickness down to the bottom edge of the library, which has a Cu2O thickness of ∼60 nm. The locations of the measured points are schematically shown by bold blue dots, superimposed onto the Cu2O thickness profile map (inset of Fig. 2a). The morphology shown in the SEM images clearly reveals the cubic Cu2O structure with the largest crystal size of ∼150 nm near the deposition maximum, in the center of the deposition plume at the top of the library (Fig. 2a(i)). With increasing distance from the center of the plume the crystal size decreases down to <50 nm, at the bottom of the library (Fig. 2a(vi)). Droplets were observed in the vicinity of the center of the plume while a major part of the library was droplet free.

SEM, XRD and optical transmission and reflection measurements were performed before the deposition of the back contacts. The I–V curves (d) were measured using the Cu back contacts. 
XRD measurements show pronounced peaks of Cu2O at 29.55° (110), 36.42° (111), 42.30° (200) and 61.36° (220) with a decreasing intensity at the bottom of the library where the Cu2O thickness was around 60 nm. Furthermore, TiO2 anatase peaks can be recognized at 25.28° (120), 37.80° (012), and 68.76° (116) as well as rutile peaks at 36.09° (131) and 39.19° (040). To find the rutile phase besides anatase in the spray pyrolysis deposited TiO2 layer was unexpected due to a deposition temperature of 450 °C, which is below the phase transition temperature from anatase to rutile. However, it is possible that the local temperature in the spray zone was higher due to the release of energy (heat) from the pyrolysis process, which might explain the existence of the rutile phase.
SnO2 peaks at 26.51° (110), 33.77° (101), 37.84° (200), 51.61° (211), 54.59° (220) and 65.75° (301) which originate from the FTO layer are also seen. The relative peak intensities of TiO2 and SnO2 remain constant from top to bottom of the library, due to the constant thickness of both layers in this direction of the library. Besides these peaks two rather weak peaks appear at 43.29° and 50.42° at the top (i) and in the lower half of the library (iii) (Fig. 2) that coincide with peaks of Cu64O. This might be an indication of a copper rich phase, either at the TiO2–Cu2O interface, in the Cu2O bulk, or on the surface (note that XRD spectra were recorded before the deposition of the back contact). Copper rich phases are a well-known limitation for metal–Cu2O Schottky junction solar cells, because the formation of a Cu rich phase at the interface determines the Schottky barrier height, and thus limits the achievable photovoltage.40 Also for metal oxide–Cu2O hetero-junctions the existence of a copper rich phase has been discussed.41
Tauc plots42 of the hetero-junction library are shown in Fig. 2c, where the absorption coefficient α was derived from optical transmittance (TT) and reflectance spectra (TR), and the local Cu2O thickness d(x,y) according to: (2)in a wavelength range from 350 to 1000 nm, corresponding to a photon energy of 1.24–3.54 eV. For direct band gap semiconductors the value of the band gap can be extracted from the intercept of a linear fit of (αhν)2vs. hν with the x-axis, shown as a red line in Fig. 2c. A band gap of 2.5 eV is derived in all four places of the library, which corresponds to the first symmetry allowed optical transition of Cu2O.18,36 The value of 2.5 eV is measured for the entire library, with a variation of ±30 meV. Optical transitions at ∼2 eV at room temperature, corresponding to the widely reported band gap of 2.18 eV at 4 K, are parity forbidden and thus very weak. Such transitions can in general be extracted from (αhν)nvs. hν plots with n = 2/3,43 however with this TiO2–Cu2O library it was not possible to identify a clear linear regime suitable for fitting and extracting the symmetry forbidden transition.
After the deposition of four different back contact metals (Au, ITO, Cu and Ag), each of them deposited onto 13 × 13 grid points, I–V scans were performed using an automated measurement system with x–y scanning capability. A spring loaded Au coated metal tip was automatically brought to the metal patch making temporary electrical contact for each individual measurement while a metal clip provided permanent electrical contact via the soldered frame with the joint FTO front contact. I–V scans were recorded in the dark and under illumination, where a laser pumped Xe lamp in conjunction with an AM1.5G filter and a 400 nm long pass filter were used as the light source, providing a spectrum in good agreement with sunlight but without the photons below 400 nm. By removing these photons electron–hole generation was restricted to the Cu2O light absorber. The current and power were normalized with respect to the metal contact area of 0.026 cm2. The patch size was a compromise between lateral resolution of the photovoltaic device library and a systematic error that is introduced due to edge effects around the contact patch. Edge effects can, for example, occur due to lateral charge carrier diffusion into the contact patch, such that the active PV cell area is larger than the geometric patch size. Consequently, current densities recorded on a single library can be compared with each other but for comparison with literature values measurement errors due to the small cell size might exist.44Fig. 2d shows light and dark I–V curves measured at four different points of the library from a maximum Cu2O thickness of ∼200 nm down to ∼60 nm. The first three cells (from top to bottom, as marked in the inset of Fig. 2a) show a comparable performance while the cell with the thinnest Cu2O layer has a poor rectifying behavior due to a high series resistance.
A complete library analysis of the PV parameters, Jsc, Voc, fill factor and Pmax, is presented in Fig. 3. Photographs of the libraries from the back contact side and from the glass side, through which the cells were illuminated, are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Note that the coordinate system is chosen with the origin in the top left corner of the library when looking through the illumination side. In this representation the linear TiO2 gradient is parallel to the x-axis, with the maximum TiO2 thickness at the left and the minimum at the right hand side. The Cu2O profile has its maximum close to the middle of the top edge of the library. The different contact metals are symbolized by a square (Au), pentagon (ITO), circle (Cu) and diamond (Ag). From the color maps, one can see that all four contact materials show a very similar behavior indicating that all four materials made a very similar type of contact to the Cu2O.

(B) and (C) were additionally covered with a 40 nm thick Au layer for better electrical contact to the measurement tip. (b) Photograph of the PV library from the glass side. (c) Map of the Jsc, (d) Voc (e) fill factor and (f) Pmax. Cells with Au contacts are shown as squares, ITO contacts as pentagons, Cu contacts as circles and Ag contacts as diamonds. Non-photovoltaic cells or cells which were touching each other (top row) are shown as black points. 
The map of the Jsc shows low currents at the bottom and towards the right edge of the library, where the absorber thickness is low and where only a few photons are absorbed. At the top half towards the left part of the library higher current densities are measured, which unexpectedly seems to correlate with the total thickness (TiO2 + Cu2O) and less with the maximum Cu2O absorber thickness. The Voc on the other hand is rather constant, around 300 mV, throughout the library, while a fill factor of 40–45% is achieved which drops to 25% at the bottom of the library. The maximum power density, Pmax, which is a product of the Jsc, Voc, and fill factor, shows a similar behavior as the Jsc due to the low changes of Voc and fill factor in this region.
Maps of the shunt and series resistance, Rsh and Rs, derived from I–V curves in the dark and under illumination are shown in Fig. 4. The series resistance drastically increases from ∼20 Ω cm2 to several kΩ cm2 at the bottom of the library where the Cu2O is thin (Fig. 4a and c) for measurements in the dark and under illumination. The resistance ratio Rdarks/Rlights indicates that Rs does not change significantly with illumination; only at the bottom of the library Rs is ∼2.5 times larger in the dark than under illumination (Fig. 4e). A low Rs is desired for solar cell operation to minimize the Rs related losses of the fill factor.

The shunt resistance, Rsh, on the contrary should be large for good solar cell operation, and in the TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junction library values between 3 and 11 kΩ cm2 were observed under illumination (Fig. 4b) and up to 250 kΩ cm2 in the dark (Fig. 4d). The Rsh in the dark is approximately 10 times larger at the top 2/3 of the library than Rsh under illumination (Fig. 4f), which is an undesired effect. Comparison with Fig. 2 indicates that the resistance is closely connected with the average crystal size, which is smallest at the bottom of the library. The impact of the crystallite size on the transport properties of Cu2O has also been discussed by others and lead to the conclusion that large crystal grains are required for well performing solar cells.45
The Jsc, Voc, fill factor, and Rs under illumination as a function of the Cu2O thickness are shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5a one can see that the Jsc keeps increasing with the absorber thickness however with rather scattered points. The highest Jsc of this library is achieved for cells with a lower Cu2O thickness of around 100 nm. These cells have the thickest TiO2 (∼500 nm) and are located toward the left edge of the library. The fact that the TiO2 electron conducting layer thickness also has an impact on the Jsc is not fully understood. The origin of the TiO2 thickness impact might be due to optical interference effects, generating a local maximum of the electric field at wavelengths corresponding to a photon energy above the band gap. We note that all the photocurrent densities of the library are significantly lower when compared to high performance ZnO–Cu2O hetero-junction cells. We attribute this to the significantly lower Cu2O crystal size which does not exceed ∼150 nm. This leads to a high density of grain boundaries at which recombination takes place.
 Fig. 5  (a) Jsc, (b) Voc, (c) fill factor and (d) Rs as a function of the Cu2O absorber thickness. 
It should also be noted that the most efficient Cu2O PV cells today are based on thermal oxidation of highly pure Cu metal, which is a synthesis known to provide large Cu2O crystals and subsequently a large diffusion length for efficient charge collection.14,19,45 The problem of a short diffusion length on the other hand is known from electrochemically deposited layers with a smaller Cu2O crystal size.12,15
Conversely, the Voc remains very constant at 300 mV and shows only a weak Cu2O thickness dependence below 100 nm. Cells with a Ag contact show Voc > 300 mV, cells with a Au contact show a constant Voc throughout the entire thickness range, and ITO and Cu contacts show a Voc < 300 mV, below 100 nm (Fig. 5b). A low Voc has also been reported for TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junctions produced by electrophoretic deposition (TiO2) and electro-deposition (Cu2O), which did not exceed 250 mV.30 The low photovoltage relative to the band gap of the Cu2O is likely due to a large conduction band offset at the TiO2–Cu2O interface, which can be in the order of 1 eV.46
The fill factor is above 40% for cells with a Cu2O layer thicker than 100 nm. Below 100 nm the fill factor is lower due to a high series resistance of above 100 Ω cm2 caused by the small Cu2O crystal size. One can see that the performance of the solar cells is rather independent of the type of back contact material. Furthermore, the I–V curves do not show any indication of an energy barrier between the Cu2O and the back contact which would lead to a non-ohmic behavior with an s-shaped I–V characteristic. This is particularly interesting for the transparent ITO back contact in conjunction with the semi-transparent Cu2O to design semi-transparent PV cells.
Conclusions
We have shown that the open circuit voltage of TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junctions is limited to approximately 300 mV and is nearly independent of the MO layer thickness or the type of back contact. We observe that Au, ITO, Cu, and Ag back contacts show an ohmic behavior in the photocurrent range up to 0.5 mA cm−2. These photocurrent densities in the sub mA cm−2 regime are far below reported values for ZnO–Cu2O or Ga2O3–Cu2O heterojunction cells. This can be either due to poor charge separation at the TiO2–Cu2O interface or recombination within the Cu2O due to the much smaller grain size of PLD synthesized Cu2O compared to Cu2O produced from thermally oxidized copper sheets. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between the size of the Cu2O crystals and the shunt and series resistance, Rsh and Rs, respectively. At very low Cu2O thicknesses a drop in the fill factor, down to 25%, is observed due to a drastic increase of the series resistance, Rs, which can be attributed to the very small Cu2O grain size <50 nm in that region of the library. The successful application of combinatorial material science to thin film photovoltaics opens a path for rapid screening of novel all-oxide photovoltaic systems.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Combinatorial PV device library design. (a) Synthesis of a compact TiO2 layer with a linear thickness gradient along the x-axis, deposited onto a FTO covered glass substrate. The bottom shows a top view where different colors represent the varying thickness of the layer. (b) Thickness profile described by eqn (1) of the Cu2O absorber deposited by PLD. (c) Joint thickness profile of the absorber deposited onto the linear TiO2 gradient. (d) Cross-section and top view of a combinatorial device library. The FTO layer serves as a joint front contact which is electrically connected via an ultrasonically soldered tin alloy frame (red). Four arrays of 13 × 13 round back contacts have been used to investigate different back contact materials. Each contact patch defines a single PV cell.	 
d(x,y) = d0cosnx(αx)cosny(αy)	(1)
αx = arctan((x − x0)/h)
αy = arctan((y − y0)/h),

 	Fig. 2  (a) SEM images, (b) XRD spectra, (c) Tauc plots and (d) I–V measurements taken at four different locations of the hetero-junction library shown in the insets of (a) as blue points superimposed onto the Cu2O thickness profile: (i) at the library top edge close to the center of the Cu2O deposition, (ii) 1/3 below the top edge, (iii) 2/3 below the top edge and (iv) at the bottom of the library. SEM, XRD and optical transmission and reflection measurements were performed before the deposition of the back contacts. The I–V curves (d) were measured using the Cu back contacts.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photograph of the TiO2–Cu2O hetero-junction library from the back contact side. The inset (top right) shows a magnification of four contacts with (A) Au, (B) ITO (C) Cu and (D) Ag. (B) and (C) were additionally covered with a 40 nm thick Au layer for better electrical contact to the measurement tip. (b) Photograph of the PV library from the glass side. (c) Map of the Jsc, (d) Voc (e) fill factor and (f) Pmax. Cells with Au contacts are shown as squares, ITO contacts as pentagons, Cu contacts as circles and Ag contacts as diamonds. Non-photovoltaic cells or cells which were touching each other (top row) are shown as black points.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Series resistance, Rs, derived from I–V curves under illumination. (b) Shunt resistance, Rsh, under illumination. (c) Rs derived from dark I–V. (d) Rsh in the dark. (e) Rs dark divided by Rs light. (f) Rsh dark divided by Rsh light.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Jsc, (b) Voc, (c) fill factor and (d) Rs as a function of the Cu2O absorber thickness.
