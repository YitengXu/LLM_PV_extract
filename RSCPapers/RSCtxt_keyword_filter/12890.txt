    , Accepted 7th November 2013First published on 7th November 2013AbstractTiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 nanotubes were synthesized through a combination of templating and solvothermal processes. Selenium nanowires have been used as a template for the first time to synthesis a family of functional metal oxide nanotubes. The nanotubes so obtained were composed of fine particles with sizes as small as 6–8 nm. These nanotubes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectra. The influence of TiO2 nanotubes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the TiO2 nanotube/nanoparticle composite films was investigated. The power conversion efficiency of DSSC was enhanced from 5.84% for the pure nanoparticle film to 6.66% for the composite film with 10 wt% nanotubes. Advantages of this method include that it is a simple and general process that can open new avenues for the synthesis of a variety of functional nanotube structures.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, the study of metal-oxides has gradually become one of the hottest topics in the field of materials science. The unique properties of metal-oxides such as wide bandgaps,1,2 high dielectric constants,3,4 good electrical,5 and optical6 characteristics are anticipated for the development of multifunctional materials to use in various applications. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, and nanobelts have attracted special attention because of their size and dimensionality dependent electrical, optical and mechanical properties and also they are expected to play an important role as building blocks for the future nanoscale electronic and optical devices.7 Compared with solid nanowires, metal oxide tubular nanostructures have attracted significant research interest because of their large specific surface areas, very narrow inner pores, and enhanced surface catalytic properties. Furthermore, 1D nanotubes have showed improved performance in gas sensors,8,9 field-emission,10 photovoltaics,11,12 and lithium rechargeable batteries.13
Among various metal oxides, TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO are common wide band gap semiconductors and have been found to be widely used in many fields. TiO2 (Eg ≈ 3 eV) is one of the most extensively studied oxide material and has been widely used in photovoltaics, and photocatalysis.14 As a n-type direct wide-band gap semiconductor SnO2 (Eg ≈ 3.6 eV), has attracted the most scientific attention because of its excellent properties, which make it suitable for use in gas sensing and as anode materials in lithium rechargeable batteries.8,15 Because of its unique optical and electrical properties ZnO have potential application in UV lasers, light-emitting diodes (LED), field-effect transistors, and solar cells.16 Fe2O3 is widely used in gas sensors, lithium ion batteries, catalysis, and magnetic storage.17 ZrO2 is an important material and widely used in ceramics, fuel cells, thermal barrier coatings, and refractory materials.18
Up to now, a number of synthesis strategies for 1D nanotubes have been reported, such as template-directed process, hydrothermal/solvothermal process, sol–gel techniques, electrochemical synthesis, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) into the template.19–23 Among them, the template-assisted approach has been demonstrated to be a powerful method for the construction of 1D nanotubes. The templating method has many advantages over templateless methods, such as simple fabrication, various compositions of materials, and control over the sizes of the formed nanotubes. Many different templates such as, carbon nanotubes,24 carbon nanofibres,25 anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes,26 ZnO arrays,27 1D silica mesostructures,28 and microporous organic nanotubes were used to fabricate 1D metal oxide nanotubes.13 Since different metal salt sources have different reactivities towards one particular template, it is difficult to extend any reaction process obtained from previous experiments to others. There are very few reports on the synthesis of various metal oxide nanotubes through a common method. For example, Ogihara et al. synthesized ZrO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 nanotubes using carbon nanofibers as templates.25 Gong et al. used highly active carbonaceous nanofibers as templates to synthesize TiO2, Fe2O3, SnO2 and ZrO2 nanotubes.29 However, it is always highly desirable to establish a general method to obtain various nanotubes with different functionalities using safe, inexpensive, and “user-friendly” reagents.
Herein, we report a general approach for the synthesis of a family of functional nanotubes, using selenium nanowires (Se NWs) as templates. In literature, Se nanowires/nanotubes have been used as a chemical template to obtain CdSe,30 and CuSe31 nanotubes. However, there is no report on the synthesis of metal oxide nanotubes using selenium nanowires as physical templates. Compared with the conventional templates, selenium nanowire templates possess many advantages. Se NWs can be easily synthesized in large scale at room temperature using water as solvent. This makes the synthesis very simple and inexpensive. Unlike CNTs, Se NWs could be well-dispersed without any bundle-up and serves as very long and straight 1D physical template. Due to the low melting point, Se template can be completely removed which is difficult in the case of silica templates.28
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3), ascorbic acid (C6H8O6), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OBu)4), tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl45H2O), Zinc chloride (ZnCl2), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl36H2O), zirconium(IV) butoxide solution (Zr(OBu)4), and titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719) was purchased from Solaronix. DSSC electrolyte Livion™ 10 was purchased from Merck, Germany. Ethyl alcohol was purchased from Samchun chemicals Korea. Ultra pure water (18 MΩ cm) was obtained from a μ pure HIQ water purifying system.
2.2. Synthesis of selenium nanowires
Selenium nanowires were synthesized by a modified procedure obtained from the literature.32 In a typical synthesis, sodium selenite Na2SeO3 (0.5 g) was taken in a glass beaker containing deionized water (50 mL). The solution was stirred for about 10 min to give a clear solution followed by the addition of ascorbic acid (1 g in 50 mL water) under continuous stirring. The mixture changed rapidly from colorless to yellow, followed by an immediate formation of a brick-red suspension, indicating the formation of amorphous Se. The reaction was continued for another 30 min and the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol two times. Then it was re-dispersed in ethanol and allowed to age in dark for 12 h without stirring. A color change from brick-red to metallic-gray indicates the formation of nanowires.
2.3. Synthesis of metal oxides nanotubes
The synthesis of metal oxide nanotubes was achieved by a hydrothermal process using 1D selenium nanowires as sacrificial templates, which was based on a method developed by our group with slight modification.33

2.3.1. Functionalization of Se NWs. 
The selenium nanowires were functionalized using 3-mercaptopropionic acid in order to get COOH groups on the surface. Briefly, A 10 mM solution of 3-mercaptopropionic acid in ethanol (10 mL) was added to the 0.020 g of Se NW's solution in ethanol (15 mL) and then sonicated for approximately 5 minutes. After 12 hours, the solution was centrifuged (3300 rpm, 10 minutes). The precipitates were washed two times with ethanol to remove excess 3-mercaptopropionic acid and were redispersed in 15 mL of ethanol.


2.3.2. Synthesis of TiO2, SnO2, α-Fe2O3, and ZrO2 nanotubes. 
In a typical synthesis of metal oxide nanotubes, 4 mM precursor solutions (Ti(OBu)4, SnCl45H2O, FeCl36H2O, and Zr(OBu)4 for TiO2, SnO2, α-Fe2O3, and ZrO2, respectively) in 4 mL of ethanol was added, drop-wise to the functionalized selenium nanowires in ethanol (15 mL) under stirring. After 30 minutes, 1 mL of deionized water was added slowly to the mixture and the mixed solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was placed in an electric oven and heated to 120 °C for 12 h. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the supernatant was decanted, and the resulting precipitate was washed with ethanol three times, dried under vacuum, annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to get metal oxide nanotubes.


2.3.3. Synthesis of ZnO nanotubes. 
Functionalized selenium nanowires were taken in 15 mL ethylene glycol and 4 mM ZnCl2 in ethanol was added under stirring at room temperature. After 30 minutes, 1 mL of deionized water was added and the solution was transferred to 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave which was placed in an electric oven and heated to 150 °C for 12 h. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the supernatant was decanted, and the resulting precipitate was washed with ethanol three times, dried under vacuum, annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to get ZnO nanotubes.

2.4. Preparation of TiO2 composite films and fabrication of DSSC
TiO2 pastes including the TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes with nanotube content of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 wt%, were prepared according to reported literature procedures.34 TiO2 pastes were coated on a conducting glass with F:SnO2 film (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1, Aldrich) using a doctor-blade printing technique. After printing, the electrode was dried at 70 °C and then was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. After sintering at 450 °C, the TiO2 films were treated with 40 mM TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. At 80 °C in the cooling, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into dye solution (N719, Solaronix, 0.5 mM in ethanol), and kept at the room temperature for 18 h. Then, the dye-adsorbed electrode was washed with ethanol and dried. Platinum counter electrodes were prepared by conventional thermal decomposition method using H2PtCl6 precursor. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and counter electrode were stacked and sealed with a sealant (Surlyn, 60 μm-thick, Meltonix) at 100 °C for 15 s. The electrolyte solution of composition with 1.0 M 1,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.05 M LiI in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85/15, v/v) was injected into the cell through a hole and end sealed.
2.5. Characterization
The products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800 UHR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS, Tecnai G2F30), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex II) and FT-IR spectrometer (Shimadzu IRAffinity-1). Raman spectra were measured on a Jobin Yvon-Labram spectrometer using He–Ar laser (514.5 nm) as excitation source. Solar energy conversion efficiency was measured using solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A Solar Simulator, 94063A, Newport Stratford Inc.) under a simulated standard solar light, i.e., 100 mW cm−2; AM1.5G checked with an NREL-calibrated Si-solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and functionalization of Se NWs template
The synthesis approach for the metal oxide nanotubes briefly composed of two steps. At first, the selenium nanowire templates were coated with amorphous metal oxide nanoparticles by a solvothermal process. Secondly, the core selenium nanowires were removed by calcination in air. The selenium nanowire templates were prepared at room temperature using ascorbic acid as reducing agent. SEM images in Fig. 1a and b show that selenium nanowires with lengths of tens of micrometers can be readily prepared. Fig. 1c shows the TEM image of the Se nanowires with diameters 80 ± 10 nm. The chemical composition of the product was confirmed with EDS. The spectrum (Fig. 1d) indicated that the products were pure selenium. The detected copper and carbon came from the carbon-coated copper grid used to make TEM sample.

The surface of the selenium nanowires were functionalized with MPA to get COOH functional group on the surface. The presence of surface functional groups will facilitate the chemisorptions of the precursors on the surface of nanowires. The IR spectra displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the successful functionalization of selenium nanowires with 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The broad IR absorption band between 3100 and 3500 cm−1 is due to O–H stretching of carboxylic group. The strong vibration of the carbonyl group at 1705 cm−1 of MPA decreased upon surface functionalization of Se NWs. The peak at 2927 cm−1 is due to C–H stretching of MPA. The peaks at 1400 and 1550 cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibrations of the carboxyl group of MPA. The absence of the vibration peak of S–H (2570–2670 cm−1) shows the bond between thiols and Se atoms on the surface of selenium nanowires. The absorption features in the spectra at 2350 cm−1 arise from small variations in the carbon dioxide content in the infrared spectrometer during the experiments.
3.2. Templating synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes
The first step in the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes involves the synthesis of Se@TiO2 core–shell nanowires. Fig. 2a shows the SEM image Se@TiO2 core–shell nanowires. It can be clearly seen that tiny TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly coated over the entire surface of selenium nanowires. TEM image in Fig. 2b reveals the core–shell structure of Se@TiO2 nanowires and the TiO2 shell thickness was about 10–15 nm. TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by removing the selenium nanowire core at 500 °C. SEM images of the obtained TiO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. 2c and d, which displays a morphology of nanotubes with uniform lengths and diameters.
 Fig. 2  (a) SEM (b) TEM images of Se@TiO2 core–shell nanowires, and (c and d) SEM images of TiO2 nanotubes. 
The crystal structure of the products was characterized by XRD. The XRD pattern of the as prepared Se@TiO2 core–shell nanowires and TiO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. 3. The presence of selenium and TiO2 diffraction pattern in Se@TiO2 nanowires shows that the TiO2 shell is crystalline. All the diffraction peaks of the TiO2 nanotubes can be indexed to the tetragonal anatase TiO2, which match well to standard diffraction data of TiO2 crystal (JCPDS card, no. 21–1272). No signals of impurities or side products were found in the product.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of Se@TiO2 core–shell nanowires and TiO2 nanotubes. 
The average crystallite size can be calculated from XRD data using Scherrer's equation.35d = Kλ/βcosθwhere d represents the crystallite size, λ = 1.54 Å is the X-ray wavelength (for Cu Kα line), β (in rad) is the peak width at half-maximum, θ is the angle of reflection, and K = 0.9 is the shape factor. The calculated average size of the crystallites was 9 nm.
The morphology and chemical composition of the nanotubes are obtained through TEM studies accompanied by EDS. Fig. 4a and b clearly show the hollow nature of the nanotubes with diameter of 70 ± 10 nm and lengths of several micrometers. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) image provide further insight into the structure of TiO2 nanotubes (Fig. 4c). Fig. 4c clearly shows that the nanocrystals with about 6–8 nm in size were in contact each other to form hollow 1D nanostructure. This is in good agreement with the average crystallite size calculated from XRD data. The HRTEM image (Fig. 4d) confirms that the nanocrystals displays well-defined lattices with a spacing of 0.35 nm, which corresponds to the lattice spacing of the (101) face of the tetragonal anatase phase. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 4d) confirms the polycrystalline nature of the nanotubes, and the most distinct four diffraction rings can be assigned to (101), (004), (200), and (105) planes of the anatase TiO2 from the center. The elemental composition of the nanotubes was analyzed by EDS, which is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The absence of Se peak shows that the selenium core can be completely removed by heating at 500 °C. It further reveals the coexistence of Ti and O in the sample confirms the TiO2 structure. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of TiO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was found to be 92.64 m2 g−1. The BJH pore volume and pore size of the TiO2 NTs were 0.29 cm3 g−1 and 9.8 nm, respectively.

3.3. Templating synthesis of SnO2, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, ZrO2 nanotubes
Our synthetic approach could easily be extended to synthesize other metal oxide nanotubes in high yield. We carried out the synthesis of SnO2 nanotubes in a similar way to TiO2 nanotubes. SEM image of as synthesized Se@SnO2 core–shell nanowires is shown in Fig. 5a. EDS spectrum in Fig. 5b clearly shows that the nanowires is made up of Se, Sn, and O elements, supports the formation of Se@SnO2 core–shell nanowires. SEM images of SnO2 nanotubes obtained after removal of the selenium core are shown in Fig. 5c and d. Compared to the TiO2 nanotubes the obtained SnO2 nanotubes were thicker in diameter.
 Fig. 5  (a) SEM image, (b) EDS spectra of Se@SnO2 core–shell nanowires and (c and d) SEM images of SnO2 nanotubes. 
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared Se@SnO2 nanowires an SnO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Unlike Se@TiO2 nanowires, there were no peaks correspond to SnO2 shell in the Se@SnO2 nanowires. This suggests that the SnO2 shell is amorphous in nature. After removing the selenium core the XRD pattern shows the characteristic of the tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 (JCPDS card no. 41-1445), indicating that tetragonal rutile SnO2 is the only crystalline phase existing in the obtained nanotubes.

Fig. 6a and b shows the TEM images of the SnO2 nanotubes. The diameters of the nanotubes were in the range of 100–140 nm and length of several micrometers. HRTEM in Fig. 6c shows the nanocrystallites with clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.335 nm, corresponds to the d value for (110) planes of rutile SnO2. SAED pattern of the SnO2 nanotubes is shown in inset of Fig. 6c. The diffraction rings are indexed to the (110), (101), (200), (211), and (310) planes of the tetragonal-phase of SnO2 with rutile structure. This image confirms the polycrystalline nature of the SnO2 nanotubes. The EDS spectrum (Fig. 6d) of the nanotubes shows intense peaks of Sn and O, displays the composition as Sn and O only. The Mo signal comes from the TEM grid. The average Sn/O composition was measured to be 1:2.1, in accordance with the stoichiometry of SnO2.

Similarly, ZnO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 nanotubes can also be easily synthesized through this approach. The XRD patterns show that the products can be indexed as hexagonal ZnO with wurtzite structure (JCPDS no. 36-1451), rhombohedral hematite α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 33-0664), and tetragonal phase ZrO2 (JCPDS no. 49-1642), respectively (Fig. S7–S9, ESI†). SEM and TEM images of the ZnO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. 7. These results clearly show that nanotubes with different compositions can be readily prepared using selenium nanowires as templates.

3.4. DSSC application of TiO2 nanotubes
Motivated by the potential application of TiO2 nanotubes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), we fabricated DSSCs with various amount of as-obtained TiO2 nanotubes to explore their potential application.36–38Fig. 8 and Table 1 compare the photocurrent density and photovoltage properties of DSSCs with various nanotube content (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 wt%) measured at 1 sun (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G). When the nanotube content was less than 10 wt%, the short-circuit current density of the DSSCs based on the composite films were larger than that of the TiO2 nanoparticle DSSC. The Jsc value of the 10 wt% nanotube DSSC was 11.4 mA cm−2, which was 15.26% greater than 9.89 mA cm−2 of the nanoparticle DSSC. The increase in Jsc is probably due to both the higher charge collection efficiency and light scattering caused by the nanotubes.39,40 The open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs were almost same for all the nanotubes contents. The highest efficiency of 6.66% was achieved from DSSC with 10 wt% nanotubes. The efficiency was enhanced by 14.04% compared to 5.84% efficiency of the nanoparticle DSSC. These results indicate that the 14.04% improvement in the efficiency mainly resulted from the 15.26% increase in Jsc. However, when DSSCs made from 20 and 50 wt% nanotubes, the efficiency was lower than that of nanoparticle DSSC. This may due to the reduction in dye uptake by nanotubes. These studies clearly show that the nanotubes prepared in the present study could have potential application in dye sensitized solar cells and other fields.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of a family of functional metal oxide nanotubes such as TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 by a general and facile way using selenium nanowires as templates via a solvothermal approach. The morphology and composition of the nanotubes were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS analysis. The nanotubes so obtained have uniform diameters and lengths of tens of micrometers. HRTEM analysis showed that the nanotubes were composed of fine particles with sizes as small as 6–8 nm. DSSC made using the composite with 10% TiO2 nanotubes and 90% nanoparticles demonstrated 14.04% higher device efficiency than that made using TiO2 nanoparticles alone. These obtained nanotubes can have a wide range of applications in different fields such as sensing, catalysis, and photovoltaic devices.
