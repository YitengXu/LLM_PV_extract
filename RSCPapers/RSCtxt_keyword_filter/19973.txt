        Nickel
        sulfides have been, for the first time, electrodeposited on transparent conductive glass by a facile periodic potential reversal (PR) technique to supersede Pt counter electrodes (CEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The composition and electrochemical catalytic activity of the nickel sulfide films prepared by PR technique are different from those of the ones deposited by the commonly used potentiostatic (PS) technique. PR technique produces transparent single-component NiS, while co-deposition of Ni and NiS is found in the opaque films prepared by PS method. The nickel sulfide deposited by PR technique shows high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− in a DSC. DSC with the CE deposited by PR technique performs much better (6.82%) than that by PS method (3.22%), and is comparable to the device with conventional Pt coated CE (7.00%).

Broader context
As one of the renewable energy sources, photovoltaics (PV), which convert solar radiation into electricity, have experienced fast growth in recent years. To raise the competitiveness of PV against traditional fossil energy, the main challenges to overcome lie in increasing the light-to-energy conversion efficiency and reducing the cost of the PV devices. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising PV devices due to their low cost and relatively high conversion efficiency. Typical DSCs consist of dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, electrolytes and Pt counter electrodes (CEs). For the purpose of further cost-cutting, novel high performance Pt-free CEs are of high demand. In this paper, nickel sulfides have been, for the first time, electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by a facile periodic potential reversal (PR) technique to supersede Pt CEs. DSC with the CE deposited by PR technique presents comparable performance (6.82%) to the device with conventional Pt loaded CE (7.00%). In addition, high performance CoS CEs can also be prepared by the same way, indicating that the PR technique is a promising way to fabricate low cost and high performance Pt-free CEs for future large-scale applications of DSCs.

1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising candidates for light-to-energy conversion devices due to their low-cost, easy fabrication and relative high conversion efficiency.1–4 Further cost reduction, which lies in finding cheaper raw materials and simplifying the manufacturing procedure, is one of those key issues during the development of DSCs. As an important component of DSCs, counter electrode (CE) collects electrons from external circuit and promotes the regeneration of I− from I3−. Thus, a CE is often composed of a conducting substrate with catalytically active materials deposited on it. The conventional CEs are thermally decomposed Pt on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, which have shown excellent performance and stability. However, the large-scale manufacturing of DSCs may be impeded since Pt is one of the most expensive materials available in the world.5–8 On the other hand, heat treatments are needed during the preparation of conventional Pt CEs, which exclude the choice of a flexible plastic substrate due to its thermal instability and is unfavorable for the development of lightweight flexible application of DSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new Pt-free CEs with simple room-temperature fabrication procedure while maintaining their high performances. Previous studies have showed several options for Pt substitution, such as inexpensive carbonaceous materials8–12 and conducting polymers.13–16 Recently, electrochemically deposited CoS has been reported as efficient CE materials with remarkable stability,17 demonstrating a new way to find novel catalytic materials in metal sulfides. Among the family of metal sulfides, nickel sulfide has attracted much attention because of their potential application in hydrogen evolution and lithium battery cathodes.18–20 There are numbers of binary nickel sulfide compounds, such as Ni3S2, Ni9S8, NiS, Ni3S4, and NiS2, depending on the synthetic conditions,21 such as solid-state reaction,22 soft solution-processing routes23 and electrodeposition.24,25

Electrodeposition of nickel sulfide is preferred for its simple procedure and high fabrication efficiency under room-temperature. Compton et al. have found an easy way to fabricate Ni/NiS electrode by anodic oxidizing Ni at an acid sulfide solution.26,27 However, the long-term stability of metal Ni substrate in the corrosive I−/I3− electrolyte of DSCs is still unknown.28Co-deposition of nickel and sulfur is another way for fabricating metal sulfide electrode on different kinds of conductive substrates.17,29Thiourea is commonly used as the source of sulfur in the deposition bath for the co-deposition, combined with ammonia for adjusting the pH and stabilizing the metal ions. The volatilization of the added ammonia introduces instability of the alkaline deposition bath, and means that the metal ion concentration is unknown due to the formation of complex compound. Therefore, neutral or near neutral deposition bath of good stability and simple composition is favored. Meanwhile, raising metal ion concentration in the deposition bath will shorten the deposition time and benefit the fabrication efficiency. Since the composition of the conventional deposition bath is going to be changed, new deposition techniques and parameters are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a nickel sulfide electrode prepared by electrodeposition on the transparent conducting glass substrates in a near neutral aqueous bath simply containing NiCl2 and thiourea. The novel Pt-free electrodes exhibit excellent performance as CEs in DSCs. And to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time nickel sulfides have been reported as an efficient catalytic material in the CE of DSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of nickel sulfide CEs
The nickel sulfide electrodes were prepared by electrochemical deposition methods. The deposition bath was a 50 ml aqueous solution containing 50 mM nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., A.G.) and 1.0 M thiourea (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., A.G.). The deposition was conducted at room temperature in a single-compartment glass cell with three-electrode configuration using a CHI 660D electrochemical work station (CH Instruments). The substrate was previously cleaned FTO (TEC-15, LOF) glass. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as auxiliary electrode and reference electrode, respectively. After electrodeposition, the FTO glass was removed from the deposition bath, washed with deionized water and dried under an air flow.
2.2. Fabrication of DSC devices
The TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on well-cleaned FTO glass by screen printing technique. A 10 μm thick transparent layer with 20 nm sized anatase TiO2 particles was first printed on the FTO glass and further coated by a 5 μm thick scattering layer of 300 nm sized rutile TiO2 particles. The detailed preparation procedures and components of the TiO2 pastes for screen printing are the same as those reported in the literature.30 After screen printing, TiO2 layers were gradually heated to 450 °C and held at that temperature for 30 min. Electrodes were further treated in TiCl4 solution, rinsed, dried, and heated to 500 °C in a hot air stream for 30 min. When the temperature was cooled down to 80 °C, they were immersed into a 0.3 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye (RuL2(SCN)2·2H2O, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, Dyesol) overnight. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried in the air before being assembled with different CEs. For comparison, the Pt/FTO electrode was fabricated by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 (30 mM in isopropanol) on FTO glass at 385 °C for 30 min. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M methylhexylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M iodine, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M lithium iodide in 3-methoxypropionitrile. Photoanodes and CEs were sealed with surlyn 1702 (DuPont), and electrolyte was introduced into the configuration via vacuum backfilling through the pre-drilled holes, which were then sealed.
2.3. Characterizations and measurements
The microstructures and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of the synthesized nickel sulfides on FTO glass were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded by Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nickel sulfide films were recorded by a diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a Pt wire as auxiliary electrode, an Ag/Ag+ electrode as reference electrode and the fabricated nickel sulfide electrode as working electrode with a total exposure area of 0.5 cm2 in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2. The scan rate is 50 mV·s−1 and the data were acquired using a CHI 660D electrochemical work station (CH Instruments). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using the IM6ex electrochemical work station with the frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 KHz. The amplitude of the modulated signal was 10 mV. For photovoltaic testing, a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91192) was used to give an illumination of 100 mW·cm−2 (AM 1.5) on the surface of solar cells. The incident light intensity was measured with a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel, 70260) before each experiment. A potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Model 263A) was used to record the current–voltage plots.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. 
          Electrodeposition methods
Before electrodeposition, linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 1) was carried out to characterize the electrochemical behavior of Ni2+ and thiourea on FTO glass, and determine the deposition parameters. The aqueous electrolytes used contain (i) 50 mM NiCl2, (ii) 1 M thiourea and (iii) 50 mM NiCl2 and 1 M thiourea, respectively.
 Fig. 1  
Linear-sweep voltammetry of various deposition systems: (a) cathodic sweep; (b) scaled cathodic sweep; (c) anodic sweep. 
In the cathodic sweep (Fig. 1(a)), aqueous solution (ii) is almost electrochemically inert on the surface of FTO glass. The deposition of bulk Ni starts at −0.9 V from the deposition bath (i), indicating a quite large overpotential which can be attributed to the polarization of Ni2+ at the FTO surface. The onset of bulk Ni deposition shifts to −0.71 V after introducing 1 M thiourea into the bath, owing to the depolarization effect. The depolarization can be explained by the adsorption of thiourea and its electroreduced products at the surface of the substrate and their reaction with Ni2+ ions.24 The small cathodic current before bulk Ni deposition in the bath (i) suggests the existence of hydrogen evolution24 (Fig. 1(b)). However, a hump is observed at around −0.6 V when 1 M thiourea is added, indicating the electroreduction of thiourea and incorporation of S into the Ni films during the bulk Ni deposition. Several mechanisms have been proposed to describe the decomposition mechanism of thiourea during the electrodeposition of metals.24 The content of S in the deposition film increases with an increasing thiourea concentration in the deposition bath,24 suggesting the feasibility of depositing NiS using potentiostatic technique (PS) with deposition bath of high thiourea concentration. Unfortunately, the co-deposition of metal Ni is inevitable.
On the other hand, anodic polarization curve reveals that the oxidation of deposited Ni starts at −0.6 V and the oxidation peak is at −0.1 V for the NiCl2 solution (Fig. 1(c)). The anodic dissolving rate of Ni is much higher in the presence of a large amount of thiourea and reaches a maximum at 0.1 V. Inspired by the greatly enhanced anodic dissolving of Ni, we notice that applying an anodic bias following the cathodic deposition can help to remove the undesirable metal Ni deposited during the cathodic process. Periodic repetition of such procedure is applied for the total removal of Ni and sufficient amount of NiS. Such technique is featured as periodic potential reversal technique (PR). Similar method has been used to prepare single-crystal Au nanowires31 and CuInSe2 films.32
NiS electrodes were prepared by both PR and PS using the aqueous deposition bath of 50 mM NiCl2 and 1 M thiourea. After optimization (see supplementary information‡), the cathodic deposition bias was selected at −0.9 V for both techniques to provide certain overpotential. The anodic bias for PR was set at 0.1 V for the maximum Ni dissolving rate. In each period, the anodic and cathodic time was set at 24 s and 6 s, respectively, to ensure the complete removal of metal Ni. The duration of PS was 60 s, which is equal to the total cathodic time of 10 cycles for the PR (Fig. S1‡).
The current–time (I–t) curves of the different deposition methods are shown in Fig. 2. In the PS deposition, the current experiences a fast drop followed by a continuous increase. The initial drop is caused by the depletion of Ni2+ ions at the surface of FTO substrate, while the subsequent increase in the current indicates the polarization of the Ni2+ at the deposited film has been greatly reduced. The relatively slow growth of the current is a sign of progressive nucleation. In the PR deposition, large current has been found at every reverse operation. The instantaneous large cathodic current is caused by the enrichment of Ni2+ near the electrode surface during the anodic process, while dissolving of freshly deposited metal Ni is attributed to the instantaneous large anodic current. The current approaches zero at the end of each anodic polarization, suggesting the metal Ni has been completely removed.
 Fig. 2  The I–t curves during the electrodeposition by different techniques: (a) PS and (b) PR. The deposition bath is aqueous solution containing 50 mM NiCl2 and 1.0 M thiourea. 
3.2. Appearance and morphology
The two different preparation methods result in distinct appearance and morphology of the nickel sulfide electrodes. The film prepared by PS method (NiSPS) is less transparent and more reflective compared with the one prepared by PR deposition (NiSPR) (Fig. 3(a)). Besides the difference in composition, the amount of the deposits, which can be deduced from the calculated Q–t curves (Figure S2‡), is considered as another possible reason for the difference in the transparency of the electrodes. The accumulated charges in NiSPR are less than that of NiSPS due to periodical anodic polarization, resulting in a more transparent NiSPR electrode (Fig. 3(a)).
 Fig. 3  (a) Photographs of nickel sulfide electrodes prepared by PS (left) and PR (right) technique; SEM images of (b) NiSPS and (c) NiSPR. 
The microstructure morphology of these electrodes have been scharacterized by SEM (Fig. 3(b), (c)). The PR deposition results in a film with a large number of small grains. The distribution of grain size is quite uniform and the average grain size is about 40 nm. However, the surface of NiSPS is covered by a film with larger grains of about 110 nm in size. The difference of the grain size in these two electrodes should be attributed to the difference in the imposed bias. Continuously applied cathodic bias leads to the continuous growth of the grains, forming larger grains, while the periodically applied anodic bias restricts the grain growth by dissolving the metal Ni and favors the formation of smaller NiS grains. SEM images of NiSPR prepared using various deposition times can also help to understand the formation of the grains (Fig. S3‡). There are a few tiny grains of several nanometres in size after a 2-cycle deposition. The numbers of the grains, as well as the grain size, grow as the deposition time extends, indicating the growth of the NiSPR grains follow a progressive nucleation mechanism.
3.3. Composition
The contents of Ni and S in the NiS electrodes have been determined by EDX spectroscopy. Table 1 lists the atomic percentage of Ni, S and the Ni:S ratio in the prepared films. High Ni:S ratio of 3.67:1 is found in NiSPS, suggesting the abundance of metal Ni in the electrode. The Ni:S ratio is significantly reduced to nearly 1:1 when applying the PR technique, which agrees with our above predication that Ni has been dissolved under periodically imposed anodic bias. It should be noticed that the relative percentage of Ni and S decrease in NiSPR film. The main reason lies in the enhanced signal of other elements, such as Si and O from the FTO substrate, since the deposited NiSPR film is thinner.

The XPS measurements are applied to analyze the surface chemical composition of the synthesized NiS electrodes. In the Ni 2p3/2spectra (Fig. 4(a)), there are two detectable peaks for both electrodes without Ar sputtering, corresponding to Ni in two different chemical environments. Both electrodes exhibit a peak at 855.6 eV, which is consistent with Ni in the oxides/hydroxides.25,33 The other peak in NiSPR spectrum located at lower energy value (853.1 eV) with relative low intensity is assigned to Ni2+ of NiS according to the literature,25,33,34 while a weak peak of metal Ni has been found in the NiSPS with the energy value of 852.6 eV.34 The abundant existence of nickel oxides/hydroxides is due to the fast oxidation of the freshly prepared electrodes in the air and is reported to be difficult to avoid.25 After Ar sputtering, the peaks of nickel oxides/hydroxides are greatly repressed, with an enhanced signal of the peaks at low energy value. The locations of the peaks at low energy value remain almost the same after Ar sputtering, confirming that the deposited NiSPR and NiSPS films are mainly composed of NiS and Ni respectively, other than nickel oxides/hydroxides. Comparing the peak intensity of the electrodes after Ar sputtering, we can clearly see that there is abundant Ni in the NiSPS, which is in good accordance with the results of EDX. The binding energy values of S 2p in these two electrodes are at around 162 eV, indicating that most of the S species exist as S2− other than incorporated elemental S, whose binding energy value is located at 164 eV (Fig. 4(b)). The observation of peaks at 168 eV before Ar sputtering is related to sulfur oxides, further confirming the existence of surface oxidation.

Since the difference between the binding energy of Ni2+ in NiS and metal Ni is very small (0.5 eV), which may lead to false conclusions, we have also checked the XRD patterns of these electrodes. There are no detectable diffraction peaks in the patterns of the as-deposited electrodes, suggesting that the deposited films are amorphous. After annealing the electrodes at 300 °C in flowing Ar, the NiSPS film shows mixed structures of metal Ni and Ni9S8, while the peak of metal Ni is not observed in the patterns of NiSPR film (Fig. 5). These results have further proved the removal of metal Ni during the anodic polarization in the PR method.

3.4. Electrochemical activity and stability
The electrochemical catalytic activity of NiSPS and NiSPR electrodes, which is crucial for CEs used in DSCs, are examined by cyclic voltammetry under I−/I3− electrochemical system using three-electrode system (Fig. 6(a)). The two electrodes exhibit totally different electrochemical activity towards I−/I3−redox reaction because of the observed distinct cyclic voltammetry curves. No significant current is observed at the potential range from −0.6 to 0.3 V for the Ni-rich NiSPSelectrode, pointing to the poor catalytic activity of the electrode. However, the NiSPR behaves quite similarly to the Pt/FTO electrode and exhibits two distinct pairs of redox peaks. The left peaks are corresponding to the redox reaction between I− and I3−, while the right ones are corresponding to the reaction between I3− and I2. The high peak current density of the left redox peaks reveals that the reduction of I3− to I− has been greatly enhanced at the surface of the electrode, making it more suitable to use the NiSPR as CEs in the DSCs instead of NiSPS. A 20 consecutive cycle scan shows unchanged curve shape and constant peak current density (Fig. 6(b)), showing the excellent electrochemical stability of NiSPR in the I−/I3− system.

The inset shows the anodic and cathodic peak current densities vs. cycle times. 
A symmetric sandwich-like configuration with two identical electrodes,16 has been introduced to further study the electrochemical behavior of the NiS and Pt/FTO electrodes in the same electrolyte used in the DSCs. As shown in Fig. 7, the Ni-rich NiSPS exhibits no significant current even under a large imposed bias, revealing its poor activity for either I3−reduction or I−oxidation. However, the NiSPR and Pt/FTO reach their mass transport limitation under imposed bias of 0.5 and 0.8 V, respectively. The limiting current densities of cells with NiSPR and Pt/FTO electrodes, which are determined by the diffusion of the ionic carriers in the electrolyte, are about 34 mA·cm−2. The slope of the polarization curve of the NiSPR is larger than that of Pt/FTO electrode in the low bias region, indicating a higher exchange current density for NiSPR in terms of the Tafel equation. The polarization curves also suggests that with the same current flowing through the electrodes, NiSPR requires lower overpotential than Pt/FTO, which will reduce the potential loss at the CE side of the DSCs and result in higher fill factor (FF).
 Fig. 7  Polarization curves of the nickel sulfide and Pt/FTO electrodes. The scan rate is 5 mV·s−1. 

EIS has been carried out to study the charge-transfer process at the interface between the NiS electrodes and the electrolyte. Again, we use the symmetric sandwich-like configuration to exclude the influence of TiO2 photoanode. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 8. There are two well-defined semicircles for the plots of Pt/FTO and NiSPR. The semicircles in high and low frequency range are assigned to impedance related with charge-transfer processes occurring at the CE/electrolyte interface and the finite layer Nernst diffusion impedance within the electrolyte, respectively. However, the NiSPS only shows part of a semicircle, suggesting a large charge-transfer resistance (Rct), which is in good accordance with the cyclic voltammetry study. The Rct of these electrodes have been obtained by fitting the experimental data with the equivalent circuit (Fig. 8(c)) and shown in Table 2. The Ni-rich NiSPS possesses a large Rct of 105 Ω·cm2. After removing the metal Ni, the Rct of NiSPR can be dramatically decreased to 0.60 Ω·cm2, which is even below the Rct of commonly used Pt/FTO (1.70 Ω·cm2), leading to only 9.0 mV loss under a 15 mA cm−2 current flow. The electrochemical stabilities of NiSPR electrodes were further investigated by testing the freshly prepared cells and the 10-day aged ones. Fig. 8(d) shows that the Rct of NiSPR experiences a slight decrease after aging for 10 days, which can be explained by better contact or enhanced I3−reduction between the electrolyte and the electrode.17 This result indicates that the NiSPR electrode is electrochemically stable in the electrolyte employing I−/I3−redox couple, which is also in good accordance with the result of the consecutive voltammetry scan test presented above.

3.5. Photovoltaic performance

Fig. 9 compares the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells assembled by (A) a NiSPS CE, (B) a NiSPR CE and (C) a conventional Pt/FTO CE under standard simulated AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW·cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. An apparent low FF for NiSPS CE base DSC has been found, leading to the poor performance of the device (3.22%) compared with a 7.00% conversion efficiency of the cell using Pt/FTO CE. The FF can be improved from 0.315 to 0.640 by removing the excess Ni in the NiS electrode, leading to a conversion efficiency of 6.83% for DSC with NiSPR CE. The FF of NiSPR based device even exceeds that of Pt based device slightly owing to its lower Rct. The results are in good accordance with the EIS analysis measured using the symmetric sandwich-like cells.
 Fig. 9  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSCs using NiSPS, NiSPR and Pt/FTO CEs. 
After replacing the Pt/FTO CE with NiS CEs, a 25 mV drop in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is observed. To investigate the causes of the Voc loss in the NiS based devices, EIS measurements of DSCs with NiSPR and Pt/FTO CEs have been performed by varying the applied potential in the vicinity of Voc in the dark.35–39 The spectra were analyzed by fitting with equivalent circuit in the literature to yield chemical capacitance (Cμ) and charge transfer resistance (Rrec) for each device.36Fig. 10 presents the Cμ and Rrec of the TiO2 photoanode as a function of applied potential. The value of Cμ indicates the distribution of electron state density in the TiO2 electrode. The use of NiSPR CE raises Cμ of the film, causing an increase in the number of recombination centers available at a given cell potential and promoting the recombination of the electrons in the TiO2 with electrolyte. The increased recombination when using NiSPR is also confirmed by the observed smaller Rrec compared with that of Pt/FTO based devices, and therefore decreases the Voc in NiS based devices. The recombination of the electrons in the TiO2 photoanode can be related to the electrolyte composition, electronic properties and surface modification of the TiO2 nanoparticles. In our case, a possible source of the surface modification comes from the organic decomposition produced during the electrodeposition.24 They may dissolve into the electrolyte and adsorb at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, nickel sulfide films with high electrocatalytic activity have been, for the first time, electrochemically deposited on FTO glass by using a novel developed PR technique with a neutral aqueous bath. Different from the PS technique, by which a mixture of nickel sulfide and non-electrocatalytic metal Ni are co-deposited at a constant potential, the PR technique employs periodically imposed anodic bias to dissolve the excess metal Ni and ensures the preparation of single-component nickel sulfide. The NiSPR electrodes show lower Rct at the CE/electrolyte interface and perform comparable to the conventionally used Pt/FTO CE in DSCs. Remarkable electrochemical stability indicates that NiSPR is an extremely interesting candidate to replace Pt in photoelectrochemical cells employing the I−/I3−redox couple. Recent works also suggest the PR technique can be applied to prepare high performance CoS CEs, promoting it as a promising low-temperature electrodeposition technique of fabricating low cost and high performance Pt-free CEs for future large-scale application of DSCs.

Broader context
As one of the renewable energy sources, photovoltaics (PV), which convert solar radiation into electricity, have experienced fast growth in recent years. To raise the competitiveness of PV against traditional fossil energy, the main challenges to overcome lie in increasing the light-to-energy conversion efficiency and reducing the cost of the PV devices. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising PV devices due to their low cost and relatively high conversion efficiency. Typical DSCs consist of dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, electrolytes and Pt counter electrodes (CEs). For the purpose of further cost-cutting, novel high performance Pt-free CEs are of high demand. In this paper, nickel sulfides have been, for the first time, electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by a facile periodic potential reversal (PR) technique to supersede Pt CEs. DSC with the CE deposited by PR technique presents comparable performance (6.82%) to the device with conventional Pt loaded CE (7.00%). In addition, high performance CoS CEs can also be prepared by the same way, indicating that the PR technique is a promising way to fabricate low cost and high performance Pt-free CEs for future large-scale applications of DSCs.
