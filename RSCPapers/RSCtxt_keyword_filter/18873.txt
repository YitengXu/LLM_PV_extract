    , Accepted 27th July 2012First published on 27th July 2012AbstractIt is intriguing and challenging to utilize aerogels with a very high surface area to enhance the light-harvesting capacity of a photoanode. Here we demonstrate highly efficient aerogel-modified photoanodes by modifying both the aerogel's microstructure and the photoanode's functions. A low-cost sol–gel and ambient-drying route is developed to fabricate high-quality SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogels with tunable surface area (500–1170 m2 g−1) and packing density (0.03–0.27 g cm−3). Two series of hybrid photoanodes integrating SiO2–TiO2 aerogel microparticles and TiO2 nanocrystallites are designed, to overcome the intrinsic weakness of the mesoporous structure in the electron-transporting property. The aerogel-modified photoanodes yield significantly higher photocurrent densities than the TiO2 nanocrystallite photoanode due to their increased dye-loading capacity and the enhanced visible light scattering effect. A distinctive interaction enhancement of the cell efficiency between the dye-loading and the light-scattering effect induced by the aerogel microparticles is observed. At optimal conditions (aerogel: 0.202 g cm−3 packing density, 15 wt% incorporation), the primitive aerogel-modified photoanode exhibits a conversion efficiency of 7.57%, much higher than the pure TiO2 counterpart (3.67%). When optimized with TiCl4 treatment and a higher film thickness, it shows the highest efficiency of 9.41%, 16% higher than the TiCl4-treated TiO2 photoanode modified with a conventional scattering layer. The work affords a simple, powerful and versatile route towards highly efficient hybrid photoanodes utilizing mesoporous materials, and also shows great promise for extension to other applications such as supercapacitors or photocatalysis.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been attracting continuous research interest and industrial attention as a potential low-cost, clean, and renewable energy source.1–4 The DSC is the only photovoltaic device that separates the two functions of light harvesting and charge-carrier transport, mimicking photosynthesis found in green leaves. The photoanode film, as the core component in a DSC, undertaking two major functions of supporting the dye molecules and transporting photoexcited electrons, has to be mesoporous and possesses a high internal surface area, guaranteeing the large uptake of dye molecules and high light harvesting. In state-of-the-art DSCs,4–7 a porous electrode made of TiO2 nanocrystallites (usually with a surface area of 50–100 m2 g−1) is used, which has achieved an excellent balance between dye-loading and charge-carrier transport. While the nanocrystallite photoanodes are currently approaching the maximum photocurrent theoretically achievable with Ru-based sensitizers (e.g. N719 dye), the quest for novel nanostructured photoanodes is flourishing,8,9 aiming to further enhance the two major functions of DSCs by utilizing organized arrays of nanotubes,10–12 nanowires,13–15 hierarchical structures,16–20 or nanoparticle/nanowire/graphene based hybrid structures.21–23 In view of the moderate surface area of the TiO2 nanocrystallite electrode, it is intriguing to construct photoanodes by utilizing mesoporous materials with a higher surface area (e.g. >100 m2 g−1), which is expected to remarkably improve the dye-loading capacity of the photoanode and the power conversion efficiency, if good charge transport can be maintained in these mesoporous structures. Several mesoporous TiO2 structures, in the form of powder,24–27 spheres,28,29 or films,30,31 have been developed, which possess much higher surface areas (∼120–320 m2 g−1) than TiO2 nanocrystallites, demonstrating an obviously higher performance than the commercial P25 TiO2 counterpart and moderate power efficiencies of ∼5–8%. By using mesoporous TiO2 beads as the photoanode, DSCs with efficiency higher than 10% and solid-state DSC devices were also reported,32,33 demonstrating the great potential of mesoporous structures in improving the functions of the photoanode.
Aerogel, a typical mesoporous material characterized by light weight (as low as 0.003 g cm−3) and high surface area (up to 1600 m2 g−1),34 shows greater promise in boosting the dye-loading capacity of the photoanode than other counterparts. The application of aerogels in the photoanode of a DSC was pioneered by J. J. Pietron and J. T. Hamann in 2007–2008.35–37 The former work demonstrated an incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of ∼85% in the 500–600 nm range and ∼52% at 700 nm for an N719 sensitized aerogel photoanode prepared by the direct doctor-blading of crushed TiO2 aerogel particles.35 The latter presented aerogel based DSCs with efficiencies of 2.4% (for the ZnO cell) and 4.3% (for the TiO2 cell) by using atomic layer deposited ZnO or TiO2 layers as the active layer, templated by a supercritically dried SiO2 framework.36,37 However further work on aerogel photoanodes was scarce. There are two obstacles hindering its advance: (1) the supercritical drying technology used to produce high-quality aerogels is a labor intensive, time-consuming and expensive process, which has greatly limited the application of aerogels not only in DSCs, but also in many other fields such as photocatalysis, lithium batteries and thermal insulation, etc. (2) The electron-transport property of aerogels is inferior to that of a nanocrystallite electrode, due to its higher porosity and lower particle coordination number, which greatly weakens the high surface area advantage of aerogels, especially in photoanodes composed of crushed aerogel particles or pure aerogel films.35–37 Similar problems also exist in photoanodes using other mesoporous materials.24–33 These two obstacles have to be overcome before aerogels or other advanced mesoporous materials can really drive the development of DSCs.
In this work, we successfully overcame the above two obstacles and demonstrated a highly efficient aerogel photoanode with the highest efficiency of 9.41%. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the pure SiO2 aerogel, SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel, and the aerogel photoanode. High-quality SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogels with a high surface area (∼500–1170 m2 g−1) and low packing density (0.03–0.27 g cm−3) were synthesized by simple sol–gel and ambient-drying processes, replacing the expensive supercritical drying technology, and making the aerogel accessible to ordinary researchers. Aerogel photoanodes were prepared by integrating aerogel microparticles into a TiO2 nanocrystallite photoanode, to utilize the inherent electron-transport path of the latter, and to achieve a good balance between the electron-transporting and the dye-loading capacity. Through this integration, a strong enhancement of both the dye-loading quantity and the light-scattering effect was realized, which resulted in a remarkable efficiency improvement (up to 108%) in the primitive electrodes without TiCl4 treatment (versus the TiO2 nanocrystallite electrode). The optimized aerogel photoanode exhibited an absolute efficiency of 9.41%, 16% higher than the TiO2 nanocrystallite counterpart with the traditional scattering layer. To our best of knowledge, this is the first report on hybrid photoanodes integrating mesoporous materials and TiO2 nanocrystallites. Its wide potential for hybrid aerogels (SiO2 templated semiconductors, metals or graphene), together with its applicability to other mesoporous materials, and good compatibility with the state-of-the-art preparation of nanocrystallite electrodes, provides a great opportunity to tune the dye-loading, electron-transporting and light-scattering properties of the photoanode.

Experimental section
Synthesis of SiO2 aerogel powder
The sol–gel method was used to prepare SiO2 aerogel by using water glass as the silica source (26 wt%, Shanghai Qingfeng Chem. Inc.). Diluted sodium silicate aqueous solution (5%) was treated with an ion exchange resin with stirring for 5 min, resulting in a sol of silicic acid (pH: 2.4–2.8). The gelling of the sol was catalyzed by diluted ammonia (0.1 mol l−1), and strengthened by microwave irradiation (dosage: 160 W per 100 g gel for 6 min). Then the water in the gel was exchanged with ethanol and cyclohexane in sequence, and it was then treated with chlorotrimethylsilane dissolved in cyclohexane. The powder was collected and dried at 200 °C for 2 h, forming the superhydrophobic SiO2 aerogel power (packing density or PD: 0.03–0.04 g cm−3).
Synthesis of SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel
0.6–0.8 g SiO2 aerogel particles were mixed with 30 ml TiO2 sol, synthesized from tetrabutyl titanate dissolved in ethanol and hydrolyzed with H2O (TiO2 molar concentration: 0.05–0.2 mol l−1), and soaked at room temperature for 4 h with mixing. The aerogel powder was filtered and sintered at 500 °C for 2 h, which completed one coating cycle. The quantity of TiO2 loaded into the SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel was controlled by varying both the concentration of the TiO2 sol and the coating cycle. Typically, we obtained an aerogel with a PD of 0.075 g cm−3 by using 0.05 mol l−1 TiO2 sol and 1 coating cycle, and obtained an aerogel with a PD of 0.27 g cm−3 by using 0.2 mol l−1 TiO2 sol and 4 coating cycles.
Preparation of aerogel based photoanode film
SiO2 or SiO2–TiO2 aerogel powders were milled in an agate mortar for 20 min in ethanol, forming a suspension of aerogel microparticles. The suspension was transferred into an ethanol suspension of hydrothermal TiO2 nanoparticles. A hybrid slurry containing TiO2 (18% by weight), ethyl cellulose (9%) and terpineol (73%) was prepared according to the procedure described elsewhere.38 The aerogel/TiO2 weight percentage (ATP) ranged from 0.05 to 0.2. The area of the photoanode was 0.8 × 0.8 cm2. Usually two layers of slurry were applied, which produced a photoanode film with a thickness of ∼10–12 μm.
For the photoanode film with the traditional TiO2 scattering layer, the third layer of TiO2 slurry (200 nm TiO2 particles:hydrothermal TiO2 nanoparticles = 1:1 by weight) was applied on the top of a 2-layer TiO2 film, functioning as the scattering layer.
Sensitization of photoanodes and assembly of the cell
Pure TiO2 and aerogel photoanodes were sensitized in N719 dye solution dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) for 20–24 h at room temperature. The sensitized electrodes were sandwiched with platinized FTO electrodes separated by a hot-melt spacer (40 μm thick, Dupont, Surlyn 1702). The internal space of the cell was filled with an electrolyte containing 0.6 mol l−1 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 mol l−1 I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15). The active cell area was typically 0.2–0.27 cm2.
Characterization
The packing density of the aerogel particles was determined right after the complete cooling of the particles after sintering. The weighed powder was placed into a graduated cylinder, and the volume of the powder was determined after tapping the cylinder on a rubber desk 200 times. The packing density was calculated by dividing the weight by the volume.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope operating at 10.0 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were acquired on a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The N2 adsorption–desportion isotherms and the pore structure were determined with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. In particular, for photoanode films we used powder samples (∼0.1 g in weight) peeled from large-sized photoanode films deposited on a glass substrate. Optical transmittance, absorbance and diffusive reflectance spectra of the unsensitized and sensitized photoanode films, and desorbed N719 aqueous solution were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, with the light beams incident from the film side, and with FTO or KOH aqueous solution as the reference.
An electrochemical work station (CHI660B) and an Oriel solar simulator (91160, 300 W) were employed to characterize the photoelectrochemical performance of the cells under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). J–V curves were measured by sweeping the bias voltage in the range of 0–0.9 V, while electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at Voc with a bias AC signal of 10 mV in the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz. The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curves were obtained by measuring the open-voltage decay over time by switching off the illumination of the solar simulator in a dark environment.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of an ultralight SiO2 aerogel was a first step towards the SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel. Traditionally, without the supercritical drying process, it was very difficult to obtain ultralight silica aerogels with a packing density (PD) below 0.05 g cm−3.39–42 Here we adopted a special quick-gelling technique assisted by microwave irradiation, which could promote the hydrolysis of the SiO2 sol and strengthen the SiO2 framework in several minutes. The obtained SiO2 aerogel powder had a PD value of 0.03–0.04 g cm−3, much lower than those prepared by other ambient-drying methods.39–42 This aerogel could be an excellent template for a hybrid aerogel because of its very low volumetric percentage of SiO2 (∼1.7%) and its very high porosity. As shown in Fig. 2a, the SiO2 aerogel possessed a large number of interconnected pores with a broad pore size distribution. SiO2 nanoparticles in the aerogel had an average size of 3–10 nm, exhibiting uniform distribution at the micro/nano level, and an amorphous nature (Fig. 2c–e). In contrast, the SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel exhibited a much denser structure (Fig. 2b), and TiO2 nanoparticles were evenly distributed in the SiO2 framework, with particle size of 3–5 nm due to the geometric limitation of SiO2 template (Fig. 2f and g). These TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited an anatase structure (Fig. 2h and i), but the crystallinity was weak, possibly resulting from the poor coagulation of crystallites confined by the SiO2 framework.

(e) and (h) show SAED patterns of the SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogels, respectively. 

Fig. 3 (upper) shows the typical N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel powders. While both aerogels exhibited a higher volumetric adsorption of N2 (>1000 cm3 g−1) than ordinary nanoparticles or nanoporous materials,43–45 the hybrid aerogel showed a relatively lower N2 uptake than the SiO2 aerogel, indicating its reduced surface area. For the SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel prepared in this work, its PD value was an effective and easily measured indicator for the loading quantity of TiO2 nanoparticles in the SiO2 framework. Fig. 3 (bottom) shows the variation of the BET surface area and the average pore diameter of hybrid aerogels with PD value. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the hybrid aerogel basically remained at a level of 500–650 m2 g−1 as PD increased from 0.075 to 0.27 g cm−3, which, though obviously lower than that of the SiO2 aerogel (1177 m2 g−1), was much higher than those of commercial P25 TiO2 (∼50 m2 g−1), hydrothermal or sol–gel synthesized nanoparticles (∼60–300 m2 g−1).46–48 The average pore size first underwent a rapid increase from 11.4 nm to 14.6 nm, then a plateau at 14–15 nm, and subsequently a gradual decrease to 8.8 nm with increasing PD, which reflected the filling behavior of colloidal TiO2 in the pore system of the SiO2 aerogel via the sol–gel process. At low TiO2 content, the smaller pores were blocked first, as their smaller radii of curvature caused them to have a higher density of low-coordination number SiO2 sites, which had a higher density of defects on the SiO2 surface. By removing the smaller pores from the statistics, the average pore size went up, which was consistent with the increasing pore size but decreasing surface area. It was at higher TiO2 loading that the large pores were filled in, making the large pores smaller and bringing down the average pore size.

The aerogel powders were first milled into microparticles (as shown in Fig.4a), and then blended into the hydrothermal TiO2 slurry, forming the aerogel paste. The aerogel films prepared from the aerogel paste via the doctor-blade method were somewhat opaque, and featured good uniformity and adherence to the substrate. SEM analysis (Fig. 4b and c) indicated that the introduction of aerogel microparticles into the TiO2 film caused the film to roughen obviously. A considerable amount of micron and submicron pores were formed (Fig. 4c and d), which was closely related to the micron size of the aerogel particles. While these pores can enhance the scattering effect of the photoanode, they may also induce poor charge-transport at the interface (Fig. 4e). This drawback can be overcome by reducing the particle size of the aerogel, and by optimizing the solvent-evaporation process to eliminate the uneven settlement of the microparticles.

Fig. 5a illustrates the transmittance spectra of unsensitized TiO2 and aerogel-modified photoanodes with an aerogel/TiO2 weight percentage (ATP) of 5–20%. The incorporation of aerogel microparticles in the photoanode can effectively enhance the scattering effect on visible light, and the film with 20% ATP exhibited the lowest transmittance of 15–20% in the 400–800 nm range. The dye-loading property of each photoanode film was examined by the absorbance spectra of N719 dye desorbed in KOH aqueous solution, and the normalized absorbance spectra are given in Fig. 5b. All of aerogel photoanode films exhibited an obviously higher dye-loading quantity than the TiO2 film at similar film thickness (∼10–12 μm), with an improvement of 28–43%. This result was further supported by BET analysis. While the pure TiO2 photoanode exhibited a surface area of 68 m2 g−1 and an average pore diameter of 16.6 nm, the aerogel photoanode with 10% ATP showed an obviously higher surface area of 103 m2 g−1 and a slightly lower average pore size of 13.5 nm. So it is feasible to improve the dye-loading capacity of the photoanode by integrating mesoporous microparticles into the TiO2 nanocrystallite electrode.

(b) Normalized absorbance spectra of N719 dye desorbed from pure TiO2 and aerogel electrodes and dissolved in 0.1 mol l−1 KOH aqueous solution. The film area is 0.8 × 1.0 cm2. 
For the preparation of DSC devices, all of the electrodes were in the primitive state without post-treatment with TiCl4, in order to examine precisely the effects of the aerogel incorporation on the cell performance. The typical J–V curves, shown in Fig. 6a, and the cell parameters in Table 1 show that almost all of the aerogel photoanodes exhibited higher conversion efficiency than the TiO2 photoanode (η = 3.64%), and the highest efficiency (η = 7.57%) was acheived by the aerogel photoanode with a PD value of 0.202 g cm−3 and 15% ATP (Fig. 6a), amounting to an improvement of ∼108%. While the aerogel based cells exhibited similar open-circuit voltages (Voc) and lower fill factors compared with the TiO2 cell, the increase in the photocurrent density was the major reason for the efficiency improvement.

By comparing the J–V curves of three photoanodes in Fig. 6a, i.e., (1) pure TiO2, (2) SiO2 aerogel modified, and (3) SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel modified electrodes, we can determine the contribution of the dye-loading and the scattering to the efficiency improvement. The contribution of the scattering was evaluated to be ∼8% by comparing samples (1) and (2), due to the inert nature of SiO2 aerogel in both the dye-loading and electron-transporting processes. The total contribution of the dye-loading and the scattering was found to be ∼108% by comparing samples (1) and (3). In view of the fact that the dye-loading capacity of the aerogel photoanode was only 28–43% higher than that of the TiO2 sample, we can reasonably deduce that there should exist a strong interaction enhancement on the cell efficiency between two factors greatly influencing the cell performance, i.e., the dye-loading capacity and the light-scattering property induced by the incorporation of aerogel microparticles. This interaction may prompt us to design more effective photoanodes by fully utilizing the overlapping or mutually enhancing factors including the architectural, physical or chemical parameters.
The packing density of the aerogel and its content in the photoanode had significant effects on the cell efficiency. As seen from Fig. 6b, with increasing PD and with ATP fixed at 5%, the cell efficiency basically showed an increasing trend. The higher loading quantity of TiO2 nanoparticles in the SiO2 aerogel framework with increasing PD was responsible for the improvement, in view of the inert nature of SiO2 in the dye-loading and electron-transporting processes. The effect of the ATP value on the cell efficiency followed a similar trend, and the cell with 15% ATP showed the highest efficiency (Fig. 6b). Two contradictory factors brought about by the increased aerogel content in the photoanode may lead to this result, i.e., the improved light-scattering and dye-absorbing effects, and the reduced interfacial electron-transport capacity from the deteriorated film structure due to the high-volume incorporation of aerogel microparticles.
One drawback of using aerogel in the photoanode is the inferior electron-transport property, which originates from the high porosity and low particle coordination number of aerogels. So we developed an aerogel–TiO2 nanocrystallite hybrid photoanode to overcome this shortcoming. Analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra of TiO2 and aerogel cells (Fig. S5 and Table S1†) showed that both the pure TiO2 and the aerogel photoanodes exhibited similar recombination frequency (21.23–25.7 Hz) and effective electron lifetime (39–47 ms),49,50 indicating that the aerogel incorporation in the TiO2 nanoparticle matrix didn't change the nature of the electron-transport, and the recombination process occurred at TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface. However, the effective electron diffusion coefficients of the aerogel photoanodes (5.3–5.98 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) were obviously lower than that of the pure TiO2 electrode (8.93 × 10−4 cm2 s−1), indicating that the electron-transporting capacity of the aerogel photoanodes was inferior to that of the pure TiO2 counterpart. This result was also consistent with open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis (Fig. S6†), which indicated a much faster electron–electrolyte reaction and much shorter electron life in the aerogel photoanodes than in the pure TiO2 photoanode when the illumination was shut off.51 The SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel microparticles contained a much larger number of grain boundaries and interfaces than the TiO2 nanocrystalline electrode due to their higher porosity, smaller particle size, and lower particle coordination number, which could trap the photo-excited electrons and promote their recombination process. So it is the distinctive microstructure of the aerogel that is responsible for the retarded electron transport and the short electron lifetime in the OCVD measurement of the aerogel photoanodes. It should be mentioned here that the performance of SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel photoanodes in this work was different from that of the previously reported TiO2–SiO2 core–shell structured photoanode, which was found to enhance the performance of DSCs due to the energy barrier effect of SiO2.52 In the SiO–TiO2 aerogel, SiO2 is the core material, and TiO2 nanoparticles were deposited on the SiO2 framework. So it is not SiO2 but TiO2 that was exposed to the dye adsorption and electrolyte, and SiO2 didn't act as the energy barrier in this case. In addition, the microstructure of the SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogels was not a core–shell structure, but the intermixture of SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles with a similar size (∼3–5 nm). So the aerogel photoanode exhibited intensified recombination behavior in this work. A possible strategy to solve this problem is to enhance the aerogel with highly conductive materials such as metal nanowires or graphene, which can serve as highways for photo-excited electrons towards the TiO2 bulk film and the bottom electrode.
We can derive from these observations that the efficiency improvement in aerogel photoanodes comes not from the enhancement of the interfacial electron-transporting behavior and the inhibition of electron–hole recombination, but from the increased dye-loading capacity and the enhanced visible light scattering effect.
While the effect of the dye-loading quantity on the cell efficiency is obvious in the aerogel photoanode, its scattering mechanism is intrinsically different from the traditional scattering layer utilizing large-size TiO2 or ZrO2 particles (200–400 nm).53Fig. 7a illustrates the comparison of the two kinds of scattering behavior in the traditional scattering photoanode and in the aerogel photoanode. Firstly, the major scattering centers in the aerogel photoanode were not the solid large-size particles, but the submicron pores present in the aerogel and at the interfaces between the aerogel particles and the bulk film, though the micron/submicron aerogel particles and aggregates of nanoparticles may contribute part of the scattering. Aerogel is a typical porous material with most of its volume occupied by pores, including primarily mesopores and a considerable amount of submicron pores.54Fig. 7b and c confirm the existence of submicron pores in both pure SiO2 aerogel and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel microparticles. In addition, though the deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles in the pore walls of the SiO2 aerogel may bring about the densification of the pore structure, its influence on the submicron pores was minor because of the high porosity of the SiO2 aerogel (∼98%) and the low concentration of the TiO2 sol (0.05–0.2 mol l−1). It was these pores, with their size similar to the wavelength of the incident visible light, that induce the major scattering effect. Secondly, the distribution of the scattering centers in the photoanode was not merely concentrated at the top layer, but dispersed in the whole bulk film. This structure would greatly increase the optical distance of the visible light travelling in the photoanode, thus creating more chances for scattering by submicron pores and absorption by dye molecules, and greatly reducing the radiation loss. Thirdly, the scattering centers (submicron pores) present in the aerogel particles usually carried more sensitizers than the bulk film due to their high surface area, which was expected to enhance the light-harvesting capability of the photoanode as well. Fig. 7d and e illustrate the diffusive reflectance spectra of pure TiO2 and typical aerogel photoanodes (unsensitized) and their absorbance spectra (sensitized) in visible band, respectively. The unsensitized aerogel photoanodes showed much greater scattering effects than the TiO2 film, and the scattering showed an increasing trend with increasing aerogel content in the film. The absorbance spectra of the sensitized films followed the similar trend, indicating that the enhanced visible absorption originated from the scattering effect. The large absorbance difference between the pure TiO2 and the aerogel photoanode indicated that the scattering of the aerogel photoanode made a considerable contribution to the enhanced light-harvesting capacity and the power conversion efficiency, which was further supported by the external quantum efficiency measurements (Fig. S7†).

SEM images of (b) pure SiO2 aerogel and (c) SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogel, illustrating the presence of submicron pores. (d) Diffusive reflectance and (e) absorbance spectra of pure TiO2 and typical aerogel photoanodes with N719 dye in the visible band. 
It should be noted that the scattering induced by the submicron pores in an aerogel is different from that occurring in an inverse opal photonic crystal scattering layer, where the periodic and regular submicron pores (originating ordinarily from self-assembled polystyrene spheres) can produce pronounced stop bands in the optical transmittance spectra and enhance the photocurrent via the functions of dielectric mirror, multidirectional scattering and coherent scattering.55,56 The scattering centers (i.e., the submicron pores) in the aerogel photoanodes were characterized by their irregularity, aperiodicity, and broad size distribution, which would induce mainly multidirectional scattering of the full visible and infrared spectra, without stop bands. So the scattering behavior in the aerogel photoanodes is in essence similar to that of the traditional scattering layer utilizing solid large particles of TiO2 or ZrO2.
To explore the potential of the hybrid aerogel in enhancing the conversion efficiency of DSCs, we optimized the aerogel photoanode by adding the TiCl4 treatment process and by increasing the film thickness to 18 μm, which was compared with TiO2 photoanodes with and without the scattering layer (Fig. 8). Results showed that, while TiO2 photoanode gave an efficiency of 7.29% (the best result on the current platform), which can be improved to 8.09% by adding the scattering layer (∼10% improvement), the aerogel photoanode presented the highest efficiency of 9.41%, improved by 16% compared with the TiO2 photoanode with the scattering layer. In view of the slightly decreased Voc value and fill factor in the aerogel based cell, the obviously increased photocurrent density (15.9 mA cm−2 to 19.0 mA cm−2) was responsible for the efficiency improvement.
 Fig. 8  
J–V curves of DSCs based on the pure TiO2 photoanode with and without scattering layer and the aerogel modified photoanode. 
The results above confirm that the incorporation of mesoporous aerogel microparticles into the hydrothermal TiO2 nanoparticle system can effectively improve the photocurrent density of DSCs by enhancing the dye-loading capacity and the visible light scattering effect. Compared with the TiO2 nanocrystalline electrode, the aerogel-modified photoanode exhibited an efficiency improvement up to 108% for samples without TiCl4 treatment, and 16% for treated ones. Meanwhile, as a new type of photoanode integrating both large micron/submicron particles and nanoparticles, its preparation technique and microstructure still need refinement, and the removal of large pores or cracks should be beneficial for good interfacial charge transport. In addition, the complicated effects of the submicron pores on the visible light scattering behavior, the effects of the large and interconnected pores on the transport of electrolyte and the regeneration of the sensitizer, and the electron-transporting mechanism in the multi-scale pore system, are also far from answered by the current work. Much more in-depth and systematic work on this topic is required.
Conclusions
In summary, an ultralight SiO2 aerogel obtained from the ambient drying process was used as a template, and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid aerogels with a high surface area (500–650 m2 g−1) and different packing densities (0.075–0.027 g cm−3) were prepared. These hybrid aerogels were integrated into the hydrothermal TiO2 nanocrystallite photoanode, demonstrating a significantly improved photocurrent density and conversion efficiency compared to the pure TiO2 photoanode, with the highest efficiency of 9.41% for the optimized aerogel photoanode. The increased dye-loading quantity resulting from the high surface area of the aerogel microparticles and the enhanced visible light scattering effects may be responsible for this improvement. The work not only opens up a simple and effective route to improve the light-harvesting capacity of the photoanode in DSCs, but also shows great promise in other nanoporous semiconductor related areas, such as photocatalysis, supercapacitors, and lithium ion batteries, etc.
