    , Accepted 5th April 2013First published on 5th April 2013AbstractTwo polymers, r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh, were synthesized as acceptors applicable for solution-processed BHJ OSCs. By introducing a bulky, dove tailed side chain and thereby suppressing the π–π interactions between perylenediimide units in the backbones of acceptor polymers, more effective phase segregation of these acceptors with a donor polymer (P3HT) was realized. By employing the inverted device configuration to better match the vertical phase separation of donor–acceptor polymers produced by solution processing, undesirable polaron pair recombination was suppressed, and PCE up to 2.17% was achieved from the regio-regular acceptor r-PDI-diTh.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received enormous attention in the past two decades for the attractive features of low cost, flexibility, and solution processability. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeded 10% in a recent publication.1 To improve and optimize the device performance, enormous work has focused on the chemical modifications of polymeric donors by expanding the absorption range, increasing hole mobility, and enhancing the charge separation efficiency.2 To date, fullerene derivatives have played a dominant role in serving as acceptors in BHJ OSCs, while few polymer materials have been examined as electron acceptors in all-polymer OSCs.3–7 The reported PCE of solar cells using polymer acceptors reached about 2%. In spite of the merely moderate efficiency achieved so far, binary polymeric blends of donor and acceptor materials present a number of distinct advantages over the polymer–fullerene recipe. First, polymeric acceptors are more effective solar-light harvesting systems and may be tailored to complement the absorption of the donors through chemical modifications.8 Second, excitons and charge carriers diffuse and transport efficiently in the polymer (acceptor) phase. Additionally, polymer acceptors with high molecular weight are more compatible with polymer donors and likely produce more stable phase separation between the donor and acceptor.9
To design acceptor polymers, a number of issues need to be addressed including the absorption features, orbital energy matching with the donor counterpart, charge separation and transporting capability, etc. In terms of the morphology control, the challenge is to obtain a desirable phase separation pattern with an appropriate size and vertical distribution. There are two main approaches to regulate or modulate the phase separation. One is changing the chemical structures of donors and/or acceptors,7 and the other is modifying the fabrication method to gain desirable mixing and distribution of the donor and acceptor.5,10
Herein, we report our recent study on all-polymer solar cells in which perylenediimide-based conjugated copolymers, r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh, served as acceptors. Such polymers employed in this work present two features. First, dove tailed 1-hexylheptyl chains are introduced at the imide nitrogen atoms. The solubility of the acceptor is greatly improved, allowing for solution processing, because the π–π interaction and self-aggregation of the perylenediimide moieties are sterically hindered significantly.6,7,11 Suppressed interchain association of the acceptor polymers leads to better mixing of the acceptor with the donor, and hence enlarges the interface area. Therefore, using i-PDI-diTh blended with P3HT as the active layer, the device affords a PCE of 0.45% under the conventional configuration. This value is three times higher than that previously reported in the literature for perylenediimide-based acceptor materials with P3HT.6,7 Second, by eliminating the structural defect in the acceptor polymer, namely using a similarly structured but regio-regular polymer, r-PDI-diTh, the device PCE further increases to 0.94%. Furthermore, the inverted device configuration12 is adopted in accordance with the observed vertical distribution of donor and acceptor materials, which is spontaneously formed from solution processing the polymer blends. The inverted device configuration dramatically improves the PCE to 2.17%. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the highest PCE values ever reported for all-polymer solar cells.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic routes to two polymer acceptors, r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh. Specifically, both acceptors were acquired via a Stille coupling polymerization between dibromoperylenediimide and 5,5′-bis(tributylstanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, following the reported protocol.13 The typical bromination of perylenediimide afforded a mixture of 1,6- and 1,7-regio-isomer (at a molar ratio of approximately 1:3 according to 1H NMR features). This isomer mixture was directly used for polymerizations without further purification to give i-PDI-diTh. To understand the effect of the polymer purity and regio-regularity on the devices performance, the 1,7-dibromo isomer was isolated and purified via repeated column chromatography, and then subjected to the Stille polymerization to afford the regio-regular polymer r-PDI-diTh. Both polymers were characterized with 1H NMR spectroscopy and gel permission chromatography (GPC).
 Scheme 1  Syntheses of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh. 
Both r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh possessed very good solubility in common organic solvents. A concentration of 60 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was achievable, which allowed for solution processing of active materials in solar cells. The absorptions of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh in thin films were nearly identical, and featured three peaks with λmax at 355, 478, and 594 nm, covering nearly the entire visible range (Fig. 1). These materials thus imply a potent solar energy harvesting capacity. The absorption features of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh in thin films were almost identical to those recorded in solution, suggesting minimal aggregation occurred in the condensed state. According to grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), thin films of both polymers show no obvious diffraction patterns, thus they are all amorphous in the solid state. Such weak aggregation of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh was ascribed to the steric hindrance of the bulky, dove tailed substitutions at the imide nitrogen positions. The energy diagram of the device components is shown in Fig. 1. The measurement of cyclic voltammograms showed that the LUMO levels of both r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh were at ca. −3.8 eV. Such a level was nearly identical to that of PCBM (measured under the same condition in our lab). Hence, a comparable open-circuit voltage (VOC) was expected. The optical band gap of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh was estimated to be 1.68 eV, according to their absorption onset in thin films. Thus, a HOMO level at roughly −5.5 eV was calculated based on the band gap and their LUMO levels.

The mixtures of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh with P3HT were first applied to BHJ OSCs under the conventional device configuration (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/LiF/Al). P3HT and PDI-diTh were dissolved in ODCB at a series of different weight ratios, with an unvaried total concentration of 40 mg mL−1. After spin coating these solutions onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate, the wet films of the active layer were subjected to solvent annealing, prior to subsequent layer depositions. Subsequently obtained devices performance characteristics are collected in Table 1 and Fig. 2. At a weight ratio of 1/1.5 (i-PDI-diTh/P3HT), the PCE reached a maximum value of 0.45%. Nonetheless, at the same donor/acceptor ratio, P3HT/r-PDI-diTh offered a PCE of 0.94%, much higher than that of previously reported OSCs based on similar recipes. Such results indicated that the device performance was affected by the structural defects caused by the presence of 1,6-disubstituted perylenediimide units.

J–V curves under convention (A) and inverted (B) configurations with varied weight ratios of r-PDI-diTh/P3HT at 2:1 (filled circles), 1.5:1 (filled squares), 1:1.5 (empty squares), and 1:2 (empty circles), in comparison with i-PDI-diTh/P3HT (1:1.5, dashed lines). 
As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, all OSCs containing different ratios of P3HT to PDI-diThs exhibited high series resistances around 150 Ω cm−2, which was suspected to result from the unfavorable contact between the active layer and electrodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to investigate the surface composition and vertical distribution of donor–acceptor polymers in the active layer. Specifically, the distribution of P3HT and r-PDI-diTh (or i-PDI-diTh) on the surface was characterized by the quantum yields of escaped electrons from the 2p orbital of the sulfur atom (S2p) and electrons from the 1s orbital of carbon (C1s). The number ratio of S and C atoms (S/C) present in the X-ray beam area was proportional to the ratio of the quantum yields of S2p and C1s. The ratios of quantum yields of S2p and C1s in P3HT and PDI-diTh were 0.165 and 0.05, respectively, determined by XPS conducted under the same condition. The difference in this ratio thus allows for semi-quantitative analysis. The S/C ratio detected on the top surface of the polymer blend spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS substrate was found to be nearly identical to that of the pure P3HT film. These results indicated that the top surface was dominated by P3HT, with minimal presence of r-PDI-diTh or i-PDI-diTh. However, in the ideal model of BHJ OSCs, the cathode LiF/Al is in contact with the acceptor component, rather than with the donor, in order to realize effective electron collection. The observed undesirable vertical distribution of donor and acceptor was speculated to be caused by the higher affinity of PDI-diThs, bearing imide functionalities, to the polar PEDOT:PSS substrate.14,15 The large series resistance in the conventional device configuration was thus suspected to be a result of such an unfavorable donor–acceptor distribution.
Subsequently, efforts were made to reduce the contact resistances between the polymer layer and two electrodes, in order to improve the photovoltaic performance. XPS data suggested that more P3HT appeared in the upper region of the active layer, in contact with the cathode LiF/Al. Such a vertical distribution was caused by the different surface energies of the donor and the acceptor. P3HT tended to crystallize at the interface of nitrogen gas and solvent, while polar PDI-diThs preferred to precipitate down to the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS surface.15 Therefore, it was speculated that an inverted device configuration should be able to better match with the currently obtained vertical distribution of donor–acceptor polymers, hopefully resulting in reduced contact resistances. Based on such a hypothesis, sol–gel processed ZnO was deposited onto the ITO substrate and used as the electron transporting layer, replacing PEDOT:PSS. After spin coating and thermal annealing the polymer film, MoO3 and Ag were deposited sequentially under vacuum. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, upon switching to such an inverted configuration, the series resistances of the fabricated devices were reduced sharply from ca. 150 to 16 Ω cm−2, leading to a considerable increase in the fill factor (FF) from 0.30 to 0.55. As a result, PCE was improved to 2.17% for r-PDI-diTh and 1.55% for i-PDI-diTh, respectively.
To unambiguously validate that such dramatic enhancements in device performance were achieved simply by altering the device configuration from the conventional to the inverted state, a two-by-two solar-cell array was fabricated and systematically analyzed. This array consisted of four cells featuring conventional or inverted configuration, using r- or i-PDI-diTh as the acceptor, while all other fabrication conditions were rigorously kept the same. The device characteristics are summarized in Table 1, and the J–V curves and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 3a and b. With the conventional configuration, devices with r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh as acceptors demonstrated similar characteristics. The FF values were as low as 0.3 and the series resistances were above 100 Ω cm−2. The devices based on r-PDI-diTh displayed higher short-circuit current (JSC) than the ones based on i-PDI-diTh. The inverted devices, however, exhibited more than doubled PCE compared to the conventional ones, by manifesting much lowered series resistance and improved JSC and FF, regardless of the regio-regularity of the acceptor. Among all four devices, r-PDI-diTh in combination with the inverted configuration manifested most optimal device performance, with the PCE reaching 2.17%.

XPS was again applied to analyze the surface composition of the four arrayed devices, particularly those of the inverted configuration. It was confirmed that the top surfaces of all four polymer layers were dominantly occupied by P3HT (Table 1). The morphology of the active layers in the four devices was subsequently investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), before the metal electrodes were deposited. As shown in Fig. 4, all polymer layers displayed similar roughness around 8 nm. The fibrous structures on the surfaces were ascribed to crystallized P3HT, in accordance with XPS data. As shown in Fig. 3c, UV-vis absorption spectra of the four devices were almost identical, indicating that the interactions between the donor and acceptor polymers were not significantly altered in the inverted devices.

The thickness of the active layers in the four devices all fell in the range of 120 to 130 nm, as determined by a profiler. The photocurrents of all devices in the reversed region were tested (Fig. 3d), which became saturated at high applied voltages. The nearly identical saturated photocurrents implied that the concentrations of polaron pairs were very similar in these four different devices. The saturation voltages were higher under the conventional configuration than those under the inverted one. This observation suggested that the recombination of the polaron pairs were more severe in the conventional cells, which is explained as follows. The vertical distribution of P3HT and PDI-diThs was undesirable in the conventional cells, with P3HT directly in contact with the cathode. Such an unfavourable interface curbed the collection of electrons by the cathode. Hence, recombination of the polaron pairs intensified. A higher effective voltage was therefore necessary for complete separation of the polaron pairs and extraction of charge carriers. In comparison, the saturation voltages in inverted cells were about 0.5 V lower than those in conventional ones, presumably benefitting from the more effective hole and electron collections, due to the more agreeable electrode arrangement with the donor–acceptor distribution. The favorable connection between P3HT and the anode improved the hole collection efficiency and thus suppressed charge recombination. The electron mobility was tested using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method in an electron-only diode with relevant active materials. The electron mobility of r-PDI-diTh and i-PDI-diTh were 5 × 10−4 and 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher electron mobility of r-PDI-diTh accounted for its larger Jsc values.
All these results have proved our hypothesis that the vertical distribution of the active layers are greatly influenced by the higher affinity of r- and i-PDI-diTh to the polar substrates (PEDOT:PSS or ZnO). The large contact resistances observed in the conventional configuration are due to the mismatch between electrodes and the active layer of the donor–acceptor distribution, thus creating a significant injection barrier. When the inverted configuration is engaged, the energy level between the active layer and electrodes becomes better complemented, which lowers the injection barrier. Therefore, reduced contact resistance and enhanced FF are realized.
Conclusions
We have synthesized two polymers applicable as acceptors in solution-processed BHJ OSCs. By blending the regio-regular r-PDI-diTh with P3HT and employing the inverted device configuration, PCE up to 2.17% was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest PCE values attained in all-polymer solar cells. Specifically, by introducing a bulky, dove tailed side chain and thereby suppressing the π–π interactions among perylenediimide units in the acceptor polymer, more effective mixing and suitable phase segregation of these acceptors with P3HT are realized. The regio-regular polymer r-PDI-diTh shows improved device performance compared to the irregular i-PDI-diTh, as higher JSC is achievable by the former. Most importantly, significant device performance optimization is accomplished by harnessing the inverted device configuration, in which the electrode arrangement better matched the donor–acceptor phase separation pattern generated from solution processing. Thereby, the charge collection efficiency is improved and recombination of polaron pairs is suppressed, giving rise to enhanced FF and PCE.

Device fabrication
Glass coated with patterned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) with the square resistance of 13 Ω cm−2 was purchased from Tianjin Glass Factory. Prior to device fabrication, the glass underwent a wet-cleaning course in an ultrasonic bath sequentially in acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol. It was then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 10 minutes followed by 15 minutes oxygen plasma treatment. ZnO sol–gel was then spin-coated onto the ITO surface at the speed of 4000 rpm for 18 s. A 30 nm thick ZnO layer was thus formed and baked at 140 °C for 1 h in the air.12b All active layers were spin-coated in a sealed spin-coater at 1300 rpm for 15 s in the glove box. The wet films were put in covered Petri dishes and allowed to dry overnight. The dried films were annealed in the glove box at 100 °C for 15 minutes before being transferred to a vacuum chamber for metal deposition. The thickness of the active layer was 120–130 nm, measured by the surface profiler. A MoO3 layer of 15 nm thick and an Ag layer of 60 nm thick were thermal deposited sequentially under a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the devices was 15 mm2. All devices were encapsulated in the glove box and tested under ambient conditions. The PCE was tested under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport Solar Simulator 94021A), calibrated by a NREL certified standard silicon cell (4 cm2). J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2636A semiconductor analyzer. IPCE tests were carried out under monochromatic illumination (Newport 74125 monochromator equipped with a 66984 ARC lamp) via a lock-in technique and the calibration of the incident light intensity was performed with a calibrated silicon photodiode.
