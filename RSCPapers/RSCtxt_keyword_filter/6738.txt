    , Accepted 27th May 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractDesalination techniques, such as reverse osmosis, distillation, capacitive deionization, and battery desalination, require lots of electrical or thermal energy consumption. Herein, we propose a consumption-free electrochemical desalination method based on a light-driven photocathode with a Pt/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS)/Mo architecture. Modification of a CdS layer on CZTS can improve the desalination performance due to the formation of inner p–n junction between CdS and CZTS which enhances the separation of the photoexcited carriers without recombination. This photocathode-assisted electrodialysis desalination plays the dual functions of both energy conversion and ion removal with the blocking of ion exchange membranes. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couples are recirculated between the anode and photo-cathode as the electrolyte while the salt streams are fed into the middle compartment. Under light illumination, this architecture produces photo-generated electrons to the redox couples with the conversion of [Fe(CN)6]3− to [Fe(CN)6]4− at the positive chamber, causing cation capture in the presence of an ion-exchange membrane. At the same time, [Fe(CN)6]4− is oxidized at the negative reservoir. The light-driven electrochemical reaction of electrolyte redox couples can result in a continuous desalination process. This work will be significant for consumption-free photoelectrochemical desalination research.
1. Introduction
The zero discharge of industrial wastewater is of key importance nowadays, and the people's demand for fresh water resources is steadily increasing, which has become one of the world's challenges.1–9 According to the estimation of the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 20% of world's population are facing the problem of inadequate drinking water crisis.10 The ocean accounts for 97.3% of the total water reserves on the Earth.11 To solve the crisis of freshwater, a lot of effort has been paid to seawater desalination. There are several methods adopted as desalination technologies, such as multi-effect distillation (MED), multi-stage flash (MSF), reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED) etc.12–17 However, these technologies require energy inputs such as thermal or electrical energy, which is a burden in the era of energy shortage. For example, the energy expense of matured RO, MSF or MED accounts for 50–77% of the total cost.3,18 The energy consumption may critically affect the future of these technologies. It is necessary to look for renewable energy supplies to drive desalination processes. Direct photovoltaic desalination and solar thermal desalination have been widely investigated using sustainable solar energy. In a photovoltaic (PV) desalination system, PV powered reverse osmosis (PV-RO) has emerged as a mature and commercially available technology which has been studied in depth.19–26 In PV, the semiconductor p–n junction on the solar panel absorbs sunlight to form electron–hole pairs. Under the effect of the built-in electric field in the p–n junction, the holes flow from the N region to the P region, and the electrons flow from the P region to the N region, forming a current output electric energy. RO is a pressure-driven desalination technology which consumes a large amount of energy. Thus, PV-RO desalination systems use a PV power supply to solve the energy consumption problem in RO.27–29 As for the solar thermal desalination, a solar thermal collector absorbs solar radiation and converts it into localized heat, leading to seawater evaporation.30–37 In general, a solar thermal evaporation desalination system contains two layers: the top solar absorbing layer which has high absorption in the solar spectrum absorbs and converts the incident solar radiation into heat; the bottom thermal insulating layer which prevents the heat loss and increases the solar thermal efficiency is used to transport water to the surface heat region. For example, Kim et al. designed an efficient solar desalination device with a high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 91.8% under one sun illumination.38 The device was constructed with a three-dimensional mesopore graphene network as the photo-absorber material at the top layer and a water-transporting layer (wood piece) as thermal insulation on the body. The mesopores in the photo-absorber material enhance the light absorption and help the generated vapors to escape into the air. The wettable wood piece provides very efficient water paths by capillary force. Yin et al. developed a high-efficiency solar steam generation device with a solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 91.5% under one sun illumination.39 The designed device utilized a macroporous double-network hydrogel of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and PANi as the light absorbing layer and a cellulose-wrapped layer served as both thermal insulation and water supply. In addition to direct photovoltaic desalination and solar thermal desalination, photoelectrochemical desalination has emerged recently. For instance, Liang et al. proposed a bio-photo-electrochemical desalination cell with a bio-photocatalyst anode and K3[Fe(CN)6] catholyte.40 However, the salt can be intermittently removed due to the two separated electrodes, and an additional medium is required in order to avoid bacteria growth on the anode. More recently, Kim et al. proposed the water-energy nexus technology,41 including the tri-functions of desalination, energy conversion and hydrogen production. The photo-generated charge carriers were produced by the photo-anode with TiO2 nano-rod arrays to facilitate ion transportation, resulting in desalination at the middle salt compartment and electricity production outside. However, there are still some issues in the system such as chloride oxidation, the pH value changes, the reduced energy efficiency etc. In our recent work, we reported a photo-anode-based continuous desalination unit based on the redox reaction of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO),42 which consists of a TiO2 photoanode modified with LEG4 dye and TEMPO redox electrolyte. The salt removal rate (SRR) is very limited due to the low photocurrent but still serves as an important proof-of-concept for continuous photo-desalination. Until now, photo-desalination based on photocathodes has not been demonstrated yet. During the past few years, CZTS has been widely explored as a promising candidate for thin film solar cells because of its optimum band gap energy (1.5 eV) and high absorption coefficient (104 cm−1) with good absorption ability in the visible region.43,44 Moreover, CZTS is regarded as a low-cost, Earth-abundant, toxic-element-free and sustainable photocatalyst with high light absorption and good stability.45,46 The combination of CdS layer and CZTS can form an internal p–n junction, which promotes the separation of photo-induced electrons and holes by the built-in electric field, thus improving the desalination performance.47
In this work, we propose a photocathode-assisted redox-flow electrochemical desalination method by utilizing the light absorber CdS/CZTS as the photocathode, carbon cloth coated with Pt nanoparticles as the anode, and [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− as the redox electrolyte. The reduction of ferricyanide happens with cation extraction from the near salt stream through a cation ion exchange membrane which is driven by the CdS/CZTS photocathode, while the anions in the diluted stream are transferred to the other concentrated salt stream through an anion ion exchange membrane, resulting in the desalination. The present work can achieve continuous desalination by circulating the redox flow electrolyte based on CdS/CZTS photocathode illumination. Deposition of a CdS layer on CZTS can form an inner p–n junction at the interface of CdS/CZTS which not only enhances the separation rate of photoexcited carriers but also reduces surface recombination, thus generally enhancing photocathode performance. This new consumption-free electrochemical desalination method based on a light-driven photocathode with a Pt/CdS/CZTS/Mo architecture is firstly proposed which might open up an avenue for energy-free desalination based on photocathode illumination, and will further motivate the development of photocathode materials to enhance the electrochemical desalination performance.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and fabrication of the photocathode
The specifications of chemicals in this work can be given as follows: SC(NH2)2 (Macklin, 99%), Cu(NO3)2 (Macklin, 99.99%), Zn(NO3)2 (Aladdin, 99.99%), Sn(CH3SO3)2 (Macklin, 50 wt% in H2O), HNO3 (Macklin, 98%), CdSO4 (Macklin, 99%), NH4OH (Macklin, 25–28%), H2PtCl6 (Macklin, 99.995%), K3Fe(CN)6 (Energy Chemical, 99%), K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O (Macklin, ≥99.5%) and NaCl (Aldrich, 99.5%). All these reagents were of analytical grade and used without any purification. The water solution used in the experiment was prepared using deionized water.
The preparation process of the photocathode is reported elsewhere.48–50 In brief, the first layer of the CZTS thin film was prepared using 50 mM thiourea, 17 mM copper nitrate, 11.5 mM zinc nitrate, and 11.5 mM tin methanesulfonate as precursors under aqueous conditions. The pH value was adjusted to 1.5 using nitric acid before spraying onto the Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrate (Mo/glass) that was preheated for 10 min at 380 °C. Finally, the obtained CZTS thin film was further sulfurized using a sulphur powder source at 600 °C for 30 min. The second layer of CdS film was deposited using the chemical bath deposition method (CBD) as follows: the as-synthesized CZTS film was dipped into an aqueous solution of 12.5 mM CdSO4, 0.22 mM SC(NH2)2, and 11 M NH4OH for 13 min at 60 °C. The final catalyst layer of Pt particles was deposited on the CdS/CZTS films by photoelectrodeposition. The deposition was conducted using a three-electrode electrochemical system with CdS/CZTS as the working electrode, Pt sheet as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution containing 1 mM H2PtCl6 as the electrolyte. During the deposition process, the working electrode was illuminated under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation with a 300 W Xenon lamp for 30 seconds.
2.2. Fabrication of the PC-ED device (photocathode electrochemical desalination)
The PC-ED cell comprises two redox streams (RS), two salt streams (SS), a photocathode (PC) and counter electrodes (CE). The configuration is sequenced as follows:PC|RS∥SS∥SS∥RS|CEwhere “|” denotes the separation of components, and “∥” represents the membranes which play an important role in the effective separation of molecules,51,52i.e., anion exchange membrane (AEM) or cation exchange membrane (CEM). One AEM was inserted between two salt streams A and B as shown in Fig. 1a. Two CEMs were placed between redox flow and salt streams. The redox electrolyte contains a mixture of 40 mM of potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide with the addition of 2000 ppm of NaCl. The salt streams contain the same concentration of NaCl as that in the redox chambers.

The anode and cathode chambers were both fed with ferri-/ferrocyanide solution with a concentration of 40/40 mM. The electrolytes with the total volume of 4 ml were prepared by dissolving K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O with a mole ratio of 1:1 in a 2000 ppm NaCl solution. The desalination and concentrate chambers (A and B) were fed with the same concentrations of 2000 ppm of NaCl as initial salt feeds and each volume was 1.35 ml. The thickness of each plate was 3 mm. In the centre of this compartment, the square-cut area exposed to the electrolyte was about 1 cm2, which was the applied active membrane area. The tube with 1 mm diameter was applied in the tests, and the flow rates were controlled at 4.15 ml min−1.
2.3. The tests of electrochemistry, photo-electrochemistry and desalination
The electrochemical measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) with a conventional three-electrode system. Glassy carbon, Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl electrodes served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and 40 mM/40 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− solution containing 2000 ppm NaCl was the electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was also performed with three electrodes, whereas the selected working electrode was a photocathode material (CdS/CZTS), the other two electrodes and electrolyte were same as that for CV and EIS tests. The photo-driven discharge of PC-ED at zero bias was conducted using a CHI760E potentiostat with the I–t program. The photo-driven discharge of PC-ED with constant current was measured using the NEWARE Battery Testing System. The flow rate of salt and redox solution was controlled with a peristaltic pump (NKCP-C-S04B). The conductivity of the salt concentration was monitored with conductivity meters (eDAQ, EPU357). The controllable wavelength of 400–800 nm was used as the continuous light source from A YSL Photonics SC-Pro, and a concave lens was located between the light source and the device to enlarge the light spot in order to cover the whole photocathode. The light source output spectrum was measured using a spectrometer (Maya2000 Pro, Ocean Optics).
3. Results and discussion
The SEM scan was conducted to obtain the surface morphology of CdS/CZTS as shown in Fig. S1.† It was clearly observed that CdS is well covered on the surface of CZTS grains.49 Fig. S2† shows the photograph of the photocathode electrochemical desalination (PC-ED) device set-up with illumination and Fig. 1a shows the schematic configuration for the PC-ED device. The PC-ED device consists of four compartments, three membranes and two electrodes. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couples are recirculated using a peristaltic pump in negative and positive chambers. The other two middle compartments are fed with salt streams (stream A & stream B), and circulated individually. The salt stream A and stream B are separated by the anion exchange membrane (AEM) and two cation exchange membranes (CEM) are placed between salt streams and the redox-flow chambers. The mechanism of the photocathode is displayed in Fig. 1b. Upon illumination, the CZTS photoactive material is excited and generates electrons at the conduction band (CB), followed by electron acceptance by the nearby n-type semiconductor CdS and tunnelling to the Pt layer that expedites the reduction of ferricyanide ion. Simultaneously, the sodium ions in stream A are coupling extracted to the photo-cathode chamber through the CEM in order to compensate the static balance while chloride ions are transmitted to stream B through the AEM. The extracted sodium ions are carried to the anode compartment together with the redox couples. With the further oxidation back to ferricyanide, the sodium ions in the anode chamber are released to stream B. In the outside circuit, the electrons from the anode collector are provided to the excited state of CZTS holes via the conducting Mo layer. The overall effect is that the salt in stream A is removed to stream B under light illumination on the CdS/CZTS cathode.

Fig. 1c shows the absorption spectra of CdS/CZTS and the continuous wavelength light source output spectrum in the range of 400–1000 nm. The CdS/CZTS absorption spectra overlap well with the light source spectrum between 420 nm and 800 nm. Therefore, sufficient photons will be absorbed by CdS/CZTS layers in this research. The I–V curves of CdS/CZTS with/without illumination are demonstrated in Fig. 1d. The current density can reach 1.4 mA cm−2 under light irradiation with a power of 153 mW cm−2. However, the current density is close to zero under dark conditions. The obtained photocurrent can be used for continuous electrochemical desalination.
To investigate the redox reaction of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− couples, the CV technique is utilized by the electrochemical workstation with the glassy carbon as the working electrode, Pt sheet as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in an aqueous medium that contains 40 mM/40 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couples and 2000 ppm of NaCl. As shown in Fig. 2a, a pair of redox peaks are assigned to oxidation at 0.45 V and reduction at 0.07 V. According to the Nernst equation (1):53 (1)where Cox and Cred are concentrations of [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Fe(CN)6]4−. During the desalination process, the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]3− is equal to the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4−. Thus, . Furthermore, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) appears at −4.5 eV at the vacuum level, and the relationship between the redox potential Eredox and the Fermi level EF, redox can be presented in the below eqn (2):54 EF, redox = −4.5 eV − eoEredox(2)

Combining eqn (1) and (2) and the CV curve, Eredox = E1/2 = 0.26 V, eo = 1 (electron), the Fermi level of the redox couple is found to be EF, redox = −4.76 eV, which matches well with the energy band of CdS/CZTS demonstrating efficient charge transfer.
To understand the charge transfer kinetics, EIS was carried out using three electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2b, the photocathode material has a smaller semi-circle on the EIS Nyquist diagram under light illumination, compared under dark conditions. This indicates the lower surface resistance caused by the photo-induced carriers. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical properties of CdS/CZTS photoelectrodes were further determined by LSV under 153 mW cm−2 chopped illumination (Fig. 2c). It is observed that the photocurrent difference between light and dark conditions is larger at the zero potential vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent obtained under light condition can be used for desalination. Fig. 2d shows the effect of the power density of the light source on the photocurrent density. The specific photocurrent densities are 2, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with the specific power densities of 10, 35, 95 and 153 mW cm−2, respectively. Among the tested batch, the highest photocurrent can be obtained at the power density of 153 mW cm−2. Thus, this power density is chosen for further desalination.

Fig. 3a shows the variation of photocurrent intensity at zero bias under 153 mW cm−2 illumination. It can be seen that after turning on the light, the photocurrent immediately jumped to 0.47 mA cm−2, then gradually decreased from 0.25 mA cm−2 with the prolongation of time. At the same time, the salt concentrations of the two salt channels (stream A & stream B) were recorded using two conductivity meters, as shown in Fig. 3b. The salt conductivity decreases from the initial 4143 μS cm−1 to 2866 μS cm−1 in stream A. The charge efficiency and salt removal rate are 0.64 and 1.06 μg cm−2 min−1, respectively. At the same time, the salt conductivity in stream B increases from 4136 μS cm−1 to 6081 μS cm−1. Thus, the salt in stream A is removed to stream B, which is driven by the photo-illumination. The relatively weak photocurrent results in a poor desalination performance which is affected by many factors such as ion exchange membranes, electrodes surface areas, the thickness of device as well as some other uncontrollable factors. Currently, we are working on some strategies to improve the photocurrent and desalination performance.
 Fig. 3  (a) Photo-driven current density at zero bias (short circuit) and (b) the corresponding conductivity variation; (c) photo-driven discharge curve at 0.1 mA cm−2 constant current density and (d) the corresponding conductivity variation. 
The photocatalytic desalination mechanism of the PC-ED device can be described as follows; hν + CdS/CZTS → e(Pt)− + K3[Fe(CN)6]3− → K3(Na)[Fe(CN)6]4−(3) (4) K3(Na)[Fe(CN)6]4− → K3[Fe(CN)6]3− + e−(IE) + Na+(5) (6) (7)

Fig. 3c shows the voltage curve under the discharge of 0.1 mA cm−2 constant current density, which was recorded with the battery tester. On light illumination, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) can reach 0.32 V immediately. Once applying the discharge current of 0.1 mA cm−2, the voltage drops to 0.20 V and keeps decreasing gradually with the desalination process and the energy consumption of the desalination cell. The salt conductivity is recorded as shown in Fig. 3d during the photo-discharge. The conductivity decreases from the initial 3988 μS cm−1 to 3945 μS cm−1 in stream A. The charge efficiency and salt removal rate are 0.16 and 0.52 μg cm−2 min−1, respectively. The salt conductivity in stream B rises from the initial 3982 μS cm−1 to 4073 μS cm−1 after 60 minutes. There are some differences of conductivity change in stream A and stream B which may be due to the short desalination time and small photo-current. Specifically, the desalination system is not stable at the initial stage, especially under the condition of small photocurrent. In the case of photo-driven desalination at zero bias (short circuit) in Fig. 3a and b, the photocurrent is larger, and thus the desalination effect is more obvious, and the desalination time reaches 14.7 hours. However, a small constant current density with the value of 0.1 mA cm−2 is applied, which is smaller than that at zero bias. Hence, the desalination effect is poor as shown in Fig. 3c and d, only lasting for 60 minutes. Actually, in the initial stage of short-circuit desalination in Fig. 3b, the variation of salt concentration is also unstable. However, with the long desalination process, the change of salt concentration tends to be stable.
4. Conclusion
A photocathode-assisted redox-flow electrochemical desalination method was proposed. The CdS/CZTS photocathode can be excited under illumination and transport electrons to ferricyanide ions through the platinum layer for reduction reaction. The reduced ferrocyanide ions carry the sodium ions and flow to the anode channel where the sodium ions are extracted by the salt stream B due to the oxidation of redox couples. The redox reaction is accompanied by the transport of sodium and chloride ions in the two salt streams (desalinated salt stream A and salinated salt stream B). This photocathode-assisted redox flow electrochemical system can achieve continuous desalination by circulating the redox flow electrolyte. This new method can open up an avenue for energy-free desalination based on photocathode illumination, and will further motivate the development of photocathode materials to enhance the electrochemical desalination performance.
