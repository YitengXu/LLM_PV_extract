    , Accepted 19th December 2016First published on 19th December 2016AbstractBased on the crystal structure prediction, we propose a new allotrope of phosphorene, ψ-phosphorene (ψ-P), with a porous structure, which is both thermally and dynamically stable in comparison with the previously reported allotropes. Due to its unique atom configuration, ψ-P has highly orientation-dependent mechanical properties and excellent flexibility. Calculations using the HSE functional predict that ψ-P is semiconducting with an indirect band gap of 1.57 eV and possesses anisotropic transport properties. Particularly, the electron mobility along the x-direction is up to 1.3 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable with that of black phosphorene. Considering its intrinsic porous structure, the performance of monolayer ψ-P as a gas purification membrane was investigated. The calculation demonstrates that ψ-P could be used for hydrogen purification from the mixture of CH4, CO2, N2, CO, and H2 with high selectivity. Furthermore, combining a suitable band gap with high carrier mobility, a MoSe2/ψ-P van der Waals heterojunction is predicted to be a good solar cell material, whose power conversion efficiency is estimated up to 20.26%. Finally, we demonstrated that the Au(110) surface could be a suitable substrate for the synthesis of ψ-P.
1. Introduction
As a new member of the two dimensional (2D) materials family, black phosphorene (α-P) possesses extraordinary electronic,1–4 thermal,5,6 and mechanical properties.4,7–10 With a direct band gap, α-P has been applied to field effect transistors displaying attractive characteristics,3,11 including a room-temperature on/off ratio of 105 and a peak field effect mobility near 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which makes α-P a promising candidate for electronic and optoelectronic devices. From the theoretical aspect, first-principles simulations demonstrate that α-P could sustain tensile strain10 up to 27% and 30% along the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. This enormous strain limit of α-P results from its unique puckered structure. Compared with graphene, α-P displays superior flexibility with a smaller magnitude order of Young's modulus and a highly anisotropic rippling pattern.12 Another attractive property of α-P is that it has a negative Poisson's ratio9 along the out-of-plane direction, which has recently been experimentally demonstrated.13
Except for α-P, elemental phosphorus can exist in several allotropes, among which the most common are white and red solids.14,15 In addition, other allotropes, including β-P,7 γ-P, δ-P,16 α-P6, and β-P6,17 have been proposed. According to the theoretical studies, these allotropes display a variety of electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, which open a window for designing new nanodevices. For example, β-P has been successfully synthesized on a Au(111) surface18 and a twisted bilayer β-P19 was found to be a promising candidate as a solar cell or photodetection device. α-P6 and β-P6 are expected to emerge in the epitaxial growth of β-P.17 With a high electron mobility and good optical absorption in the visible light region, these two phosphorus sheets may find applications in solar energy conversion.17 In addition, our previous study predicts that δ-P has a strong auxetic effect, and the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is much higher than that in other previously reported 2D materials.20
Although the above allotropes have been proposed, all of those structures are built from chemical or physical intuition, which is incomprehensive and biased. In this study, we perform an unbiased state-of-the-art theoretical crystal structure search based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as implemented in CALYPSO.21,22 Except for those proposed structures, a new thermally and dynamically stable phosphorene allotrope, named ψ-P, was found. ψ-P has a formation energy comparable to previously predicted allotropes such as β-P6,17 δ-P16 and ζ-P,23 and may be synthesized on a Au(110) surface by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The intrinsic porosity makes ψ-P applicable in hydrogen purification with a high selectivity from the mixture of CH4, CO2, N2, CO and H2. Furthermore, MoSe2/ψ-P is predicted to be a promising candidate for constructing highly efficient solar cell devices because of its suitable band gap and high electron mobility.
2. Computational methods
Systematic 2D structure searches were performed using the recently developed CALYPSO21,22 code with the particle swarm optimization algorithm containing 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 phosphorus atoms per unit cell. The first-principles calculations were carried out by applying the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).24 Structural relaxations and electronic property calculations were simulated by adopting the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)25 exchange–correlation functional. We also used the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional26 to correct the band gap errors. Electronic wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV. The convergence criteria for electronic SCF iterations and ionic step iterations were set to be 1.0 × 10−6 eV and −5.0 × 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. A vacuum layer of at least 20 Å was chosen to eliminate the interaction between the images resulting from the periodic boundary condition. The reciprocal space was set to be 0.03 × 2π Å−1 for ionic iterations and 0.02 × 2π Å−1 for electronic SCF iterations using Monkhorst–Pack meshes centered at the Γ point. The van der Waals27–29 (vdW) correction proposed by Grimme (DFT-D2) was chosen due to its good description of the long-range vdW interactions (more details see the ESI†).
3. Results and discussion
Geometric structure and stability
We conducted the PSO search several times with different unit cells (Pn, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20) and the locally optimized structures were selected by comparing their energies. During the search, we obtained the most stable allotrope, α-P, and some previously reported structures,3 which demonstrates the validity of this calculation. Apart from familiar phosphorene allotropes, a new structure with 10 atoms per unit cell was gained, namely ψ-phosphorene (ψ-P). From the top view [see in Fig. 1(a)], ψ-P is composed of 4, 6 and 10 membered rings, which is similar to the previously studied metastable structure of phagraphene.30 The optimized lattice parameters are a1 = 6.14 Å and a2 = 7.78 Å. The stability can be approximately estimated by the “octet rule” as in other non-planar structures: each phosphorus atom adopts sp3 hybridization, and is bonded to three other phosphorus atoms, ensuring eight electrons in the sp shell. To quantitatively compare the relative stabilities of ψ-P with previously predicted structures, the average energy of different allotropes was calculated and is shown in Fig. 1(b). ψ-P is about 0.09 eV per atom higher than that of α-P, which may arise from the 4-membered ring with large ring tension. However, the energy difference among ψ-P, β-P6,17 δ-P16 and ζ-P23 is very small, implying that these structures have similar stability.

To check the dynamic stability of the ψ-P phase, the phonon spectra was calculated. As shown in Fig. 1(c), ψ-P is dynamically stable because all of the vibrational modes are real in the first Brillouin zone. In addition, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations under constant temperature and volume (NVT) were also performed to check the thermal stability. The system was simulated at T = 300 K, 500 K and 800 K for 5.0 ps with a time-step of 1.0 fs using a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell. To visualize the evolution during the AIMD, we display the snapshot of the crystal configuration in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†). The results indicate that the geometries at 300 K and 500 K remaining nearly intact at the end of AIMD simulation. However, at 800 K, there is a noticeable structure distortion, illustrating a phase transition at this temperature, which is approximately the melting point of red phosphorus (863 K).31 By contrast, the sublimation temperature of 2D α-P (673 K)32 is lower than this temperature, indicating ψ-P is more stable than α-P under high temperature.
Mechanical properties
The elastic constants, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio obtained by our PyGEC package20 are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculated four elastic stiffness constants C11, C12, C22 and C66 satisfy the mechanical equilibrium conditions:33 C11C22–C122 > 0 and C11, C22, C66 > 0, implying that ψ-P is mechanically stable. In order to get a full understanding of the mechanical properties, the polar diagrams of Young's modulus E(θ) and Poisson's ratio ν(θ) as a function of angle are plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The deviations of E(θ) and ν(θ) from a perfect circle further indicate that ψ-P has an anisotropic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. For Young's modulus, the maximum E was 119.87 GPa with θ equals to 0° and 180°. That is to say, the x direction holds the largest Young's modulus. However, unlike α-P, the minimum Young's modulus was along the direction with θ = 60.69°. And Emin (69.67 GPa) was a little smaller than the Ey (72.65 GPa). Compared with other 2D materials, we found that Emin was much smaller than the Young's modulus of graphene (1.0 TPa), MoS2 (0.33 TPa) and BN (0.25 TPa),10,34–36 which proves that 2D ψ-P has good flexibility. The Poisson's ratio of ψ-P displays a petal shaped dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with θ, as presented in Fig. 2(b). It is highly anisotropic, with a maximum value of 0.38 along the direction with θ = 35.47° and a minimum value of 0.18 along the y direction.

Electronic properties
We calculated the band structure and projected density of states for ψ-P. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), ψ-P was predicted to be an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 0.83 eV, since the valence band maximum (VBM) was located at the Γ, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) lies between the Y and Γ in the Brillouin zone. Its corresponding density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig. 3(b). Based on the DOS, the VBM is mainly contributed by 3pz orbitals. However, unlike VBM, the CBM is a hybridized state of 3s and 3p. This was confirmed by the charge density distribution of VBM and CBM, as shown in Fig. 3(c). These features of VBM and CBM will directly affect the strain engineering of band gaps and transport properties. Since the PBE functional systematically underestimates the band gap, the HSE06 functional was also used to correct the band gap. The calculated band gap was 1.57 eV.

It is known to all that carrier mobility is a crucial factor for electronic and optoelectronic applications because high mobility will prevent electrons and holes from recombination.37 Therefore, we calculated the carrier effective masses by parabolic fitting energy dispersion close to the CBM and VBM. The results are listed in Table 1. It can be found that the effective masses of ψ-P were comparable with that of α-P.38 Furthermore, it was distinct that the effective masses of electrons along the x and y directions were similar, while the effective mass of the holes along the x direction were about 5 times larger than that of the y direction. The carrier mobility of ψ-P was also estimated using eqn (S5) (ESI†). As we can see, ψ-P displays strong electrical transport bias, and the electron mobility is larger than that of the hole. In particular, the electron mobility along the x direction was as high as 1.3 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in the same order of magnitude of that in α-P.11,38,39 As for the hole, it also had a relatively large mobility value of 5.8 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x direction.

We explored the electronic properties of unstrained ψ-P; however, as a 2D material, the electronic properties of ψ-P were expected to be tunable by applying strain, which has been widely used for α-P, MoS2 and other 2D materials.3,4,40,41 In this work, a constant stress of 6.0 GPa was acted on ψ-P along different directions, since a previous study showed that a maximum stress of about 14 GPa was accessible for graphene.42 The corresponding strain is displayed in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†), where the maximum and minimum strain were 8.6% (θ = 60°) and 5.0% (θ = 0°), respectively. Using the orientation-dependent Poisson's ratio ν(θ) and strain ε(θ), the geometric structures under in-plane stress with different directions can be calculated according to eqn (S4) (ESI†). The band structure of ψ-P under the constant stress of σ = 6.0 GPa along different directions is shown in Fig. 4(a). With increasing stress-application angle, the VBM and CBM changed non-monotonously. The VBM always locates at the Γ point whereas the CBM gradually moves from between the Γ and Y to the Γ point, leading to an indirect to direct semiconductor transition when the angle was larger than 30°. Due to the different orbital components, energy shifts of the valance band and conduction band changes at the Γ point are quite different. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the ΔEVBM was 0.24 eV; however, the ΔECBM had a small value of 0.05 eV. To further illustrate the variation trend of the band gap under stress, the band gap-angle relationship is also presented in Fig. 4(b). Apparently, ψ-P presents an anisotropic mechanical response since the band gaps have a strong relation to the stress directions. As angle θ increases from 0° to 180, the band gap value reduces to the minimum value of 0.559 eV along the y direction and then reaches the maximum of 0.774 eV along the x direction. This indicates that ψ-P is more sensitive to strain along the y and its neighboring directions.

(c) The evolution of band gap relative to the number of layers in few-layer ψ-P nanosheets at the PBE and HSE06 calculation level, respectively. 
To investigate the possible quantum size effect on the electronic properties of ψ-P, the band gaps of two-, three-, four- and five-layer ψ-P nanosheets were also calculated. Our results show that AB-stacking was the most stable configuration for multilayer ψ-P. Using a stable stacking configuration, we found the band gaps varied dramatically with the number of layers, which is similar to other multilayer 2D materials.43–46 An exponential fit (Ae−αN, N stands for number of layer) is employed in Fig. 4(c). Meanwhile, we used the HSE06 functional to correct the band gaps, and the results display a similar trend.
Potential applications
Given that ψ-P possesses superior mechanical and electronic properties, an exploration of its potential applications was desirable. In this work, we investigated its potential applications as a purification membrane and as a solar cell material.

Hydrogen purification membrane. 
Hydrogen purification from other gases is of particular importance for energy applications.47 Taking the advantages of easy operation and low energy cost, membrane separation has been widely used in hydrogen purification.48 Since a natural porous structure exists in ψ-P, we explored the possibility of ψ-P as a candidate hydrogen separation membrane. The stability of molecule adsorption on ψ-P, including CH4, CO2, N2, CO and H2, was firstly evaluated. As summarized in Table 2, the equilibrium distance between ψ-P and gas molecules ranges from 2.77 to 3.56 Å. The adsorption energy of H2 was about 0.04 eV and the largest adsorption energy was about 0.12 eV for the CO molecule. Therefore, the conclusion was that porous ψ-P was chemically inert to these gas molecules, and gas molecules interacted with ψ-P via weak vdW interactions.

Then we examined the permeation of gas molecules through the hole of ψ-P. The minimum energy pathways49 (MEPs) are plotted in Fig. 5(a). The structures of initial state (IS), most stable state (SS) and transition state (TS) for H2 molecule adsorption onto ψ-P are shown in Fig. S3(a), (b) and (c) (ESI†), respectively. We defined the diffusion energy barrier as Eb = ETS − ESS, where the ESS and ETS stand for total energy of SS and TS when the gas molecules are passing through the hole of ψ-P. As listed in Table 2, the Eb of CH4, CO2, N2 and CO are 1.27, 1.06, 0.83 and 0.79 eV, respectively, which are much larger than that of H2 (0.11 eV). Thus, compared with the other gas molecules, it is much easier for H2 molecules to pass through the porous ψ-P, which suggests that ψ-P can work as an ideal hydrogen purification membrane.

(e) Diffusion rate and (f) selectivity as a function of temperature for different molecules. 
Furthermore, the hydrogen separation efficiency of porous ψ-P was compared for different gas molecules. According to the Arrhenius equation,50 the selectivity of H2 relative to other gas molecules through the hole of ψ-P can be evaluated by eqn (S10) (see the ESI†). Assuming that the diffusion pre-factors of these gas molecules are identical (A = 1011 s−1),51 we calculated the temperature-dependent diffusion rate and selectivity [Fig. 5(b) and (c)]. The diffusion rates of H2 molecules were much higher than those of CH4, CO2, N2 and CO, consistent with the calculated diffusion energy barriers. We found a high selectivity on the order of about 1019, 1015, 1012 and 1011 for H2 over CH4, CO2, N2 and CO, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). Compared with previously reported silica-based52,53 and graphene-based50 membranes, ψ-P exhibits high selectivity for H2 over CH4, CO2, N2 and CO gas molecules. Considering the high selectivity for H2 over CO [3.16 × 1011 (298 K) to 4.08 × 108 (398 K)], ψ-P could be used as a promising purification membrane to reduce the CO concentration in reformate H2 from 1000–10000 ppm to the several ppm level, where CO in reformate H2 is known to degrade the performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by poisoning the anode active sites.54 All in all, the special geometric structure makes ψ-P a potential hydrogen purification membrane.


Solar cell. 
A previous study55 has indicated that α-P was a promising material for fast and broadband photo detection and solar cell application56 due to its high carrier mobility and suitable band gap (1.53 eV). Noting that the band gap of ψ-P is close to the value of α-P, to see whether ψ-P was also a good candidate semiconductor for solar cells, we calculated the frequency dependent absorption coefficients. As a comparison, the absorption coefficients of α-P were also plotted in Fig. 5(d). Although ψ-P is an indirect semiconductor, it still exhibits comparable sunlight absorption with α-P, which manifests that ψ-P can be a good donor material if an appropriate acceptor material can be found. For ψ-P, the computed VBM and CBM were −5.39 eV and −3.82 eV, respectively; while for MoSe2,57 the VBM and CBM levels are −5.59 eV and −3.91 eV, respectively. The latter energy levels match those of ψ-P very well, giving a type-II alignment [see Fig. 5(e)]. Thus, a potential solar-cell device consisting of MoSe2/ψ-P was constructed. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the performance of the MoSe2/ψ-P system, we calculated the power conversion efficiency56,58–60 (PCE) according to eqn (S8) (ESI†). As displayed in Fig. 5(f), the MoSe2/ψ-P hetero-bilayer could yield a PCE of 20.26%, which is higher than that of PCBM/CBN (12–20%)58 and MoS2/α-P systems (16–18%).56 Noting that the direct band at the Γ point is only 0.19 eV higher than the band gap of ψ-P, the real PCE should be close to the theoretical value.

Potential CVD or MBE substrate
Although 2D ψ-P shows intriguing structural and electronic properties for potential applications as a hydrogen purification membrane and in solar cells, the synthesis of this material is a critical issue. Through careful searching, we found the Au(110) surface, with the 2 × 2 supercell (a = 5.77 Å, b = 8.16 Å), may be used to match the lattice of ψ-P, whose mismatch is smaller than the previously reported blue phosphorene on Au(111) surface.18 Moreover, the total energy of ψ-P, with lattice parameters a = 5.77 Å and b = 8.1,6 is only 0.0636 eV per atom higher in energy than that of free standing ψ-P. Therefore, the Au(110) surface [see Fig. S4(a) and (b) in ESI†] will be a potential substrate for the synthesis of the ψ-P monolayer using prevailing techniques such as CVD or MBE. To help identify possible ψ-P in future experiments, we also calculated the STM images of ψ-P on a Au substrate [see Fig. S4(c) in ESI†].
4. Conclusions
In summary, on the basis of an unbiased PSO searching algorithm and DFT calculations, we present a new thermally and dynamically stable allotrope of phosphorene, namely ψ-P. The Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and strain under constant in-plane stress are highly orientation-dependent. The calculation shows that ψ-P is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.57 eV. Moreover, the number of layers and external stress can be used to tune the band gaps, which will broaden its applications for different semiconductor devices in the future. Due to its porous structure, single layered ψ-P is demonstrated to be a promising membrane for hydrogen purification from gas mixtures of CH4, CO2, N2 and CO with high selectivity. Besides its outstanding mechanical, electronic and structural properties, ψ-P also has good transport properties and optical properties, which makes ψ-P a potential solar cell donor material. Combining with a suitable acceptor material, the MoSe2/ψ-P van der Waals heterojunction was predicted to be a good candidate for a solar cell with a theoretical PCE up to 20.26%. Finally, we propose that ψ-P may be synthesized on the Au(110) surface using the CVD or MBE method due to the relatively small lattice mismatch between the ψ-P monolayer and the Au substrate. We hope our study will stimulate further experimental efforts on this subject.
