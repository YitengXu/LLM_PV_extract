    , Accepted 30th November 2011First published on 6th January 2012AbstractRegioregular pentacene-containing polymers were synthesized with alkylated bithiophene (BT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as comonomers. Among them, 2,9-conjugated polymers PnBT-2,9 and PnCPDT-2,9 achieved the best performance in transistor and photovoltaic devices respectively. The former achieved the most highly ordered structures in thin films, yielding ambipolar transistor behavior with hole and electron mobilities up to 0.03 and 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 on octadecylsilane-treated substrates. The latter achieved photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies up to 0.33%. The impact of regioregularity and direction of conjugation-extension (2,9 vs. 2,10), on thin-film order and device performance has been demonstrated for the pentacene-containing polymers for the first time, providing insight towards future functional material design.
Introduction
The field of material design for organic field-effect transistor (OFET) and photovoltaic cell (OPV) applications is a growing area of research and development. Among conjugated molecular structures, solution-processable macromolecules are considered promising materials for their applicability in low-cost, high-throughput, roll-to-roll device fabrication procedures. New polymeric materials have been the chief driving force in dramatically improving the performance of these electronic devices over the years. Polymer thin-film transistors have come from early breakthroughs (with field effect mobilities on the order of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 1)) to performances of late that rival the best performing small molecules and amorphous silicon, with hole mobilities exceeding 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.2–5 Furthermore, polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies exceeding 8%, with new high-performing materials constantly resetting the benchmark over the recent years.6–12
Of the many design parameters under consideration for the synthesis of a high-performing polymer, in transistors as well as solar cells, molecular structural properties and crystallization habits that dictate charge transport properties need to be tuned. For donor polymers in solar cells, a small band gap and a low-lying highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level are desirable, the former for increased photon harvest from the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and the latter for generating high open-circuit voltage in a molecular heterojunction blend film.13 Various efficient polymers, generally based on a donor–acceptor copolymer motif, have HOMO levels below −5 eV and band gaps not exceeding 1.7 eV.12,14

Pentacene, the archetypal acene that exemplifies superior charge transport among molecular materials,15–18 also has inherently low band gap in thin films owing to its extensive π-conjugation and electron delocalization. These properties enable pentacene to be extensively applied in organic thin-film transistor devices,19 as well as demonstrate its potential in photovoltaic applications.20 In 2008, the synthesis of a mixture of 2,9-dibromopentacene and 2,10-dibromopentacene monomers (with the central core positions protected with a triisopropylsilylethynyl group for stability and solubility21) enabled the synthesis of the first pentacene-containing polymer.22,23 The polymerization of pentacene proved to further reduce the band gap and resulted in a new class of solution-processable materials. These first-generation polymers are regiorandom (RRa), with the 2,9- and 2,10-monomers statistically incorporated along the backbone. Their structures, together with those of the dibromopentacene monomers, are summarized in Chart 1.
 Chart 1  Isomerically mixed and pure dibromopentacene monomers (top); regiorandom and regioregular pentacene-containing polymers (bottom). 
Recently, we discovered the crucial synthetic route to prepare pure 2,9- and 2,10-dibromopentacene monomers (2,9-TIPSE-Br22P and 2,10-TIPSE-Br22P).24 This enabled the synthesis of the first regioregular pentacene-containing copolymers, PnDEB-2,9 and PnDEB-2,10.25 (The structures of the regiospecific monomers and polymers are shown in Chart 1.) This is an important step towards further understanding pentacene-containing polymers, as the regioregularity of conjugated polymers is known to dramatically impact thin film morphology, and in turn, device properties.1 The regioregular pentacene-diethynylbenzene (PnDEB) copolymers in our previous report had overall low charge carrier mobilities on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1;25 nevertheless, we observed that the regioregular 2,9- and 2,10-copolymers achieved higher mobility than the corresponding regiorandom copolymer. In this work, to further explore the impact of regioregularity on the properties of these pentacene-containing conjugated materials, we chose alkylated-bithiophene (BT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as comonomers with pentacene. These building blocks have shown to provide promising transistor and photovoltaic properties in systems with various comonomers.2,3,7,26 Through characterizing the charge-transport and thin-film structure via thin-film transistor (TFT) devices and X-ray scattering experiments, we were able to demonstrate that regioregularity rendered contrasting device properties and amount of order in thin films. In particular, the 2,9-pentacene-bithiophene copolymer was observed to exhibit higher thin film order and therefore field-effect mobility than its 2,10- and regiorandom counterparts.
Experimental
Materials and characterization methods
Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were of reagent grade obtained from Aldrich, Acros, or TCI Chemical Co. Anhydrous grade solvents were purchased from these commercial sources. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Inova 300, Merc 400 or Inova 500 in deuterated chloroform at 293 K. Chemical shifts for 1H and 13C NMR spectra were referenced to solvent peaks. Relative molecular weight was measured by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. DSC thermographs were recorded on a Mettler DSC 822 and calibrated with a pure indium sample with a scan rate of 10.0 °C min−1. Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a Mettler TOLEDO TGA/SDTA 851e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow of 20 mL min−1.
Electrochemical and photophysical properties measurement

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed under a stream of argon in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with 0.05 M of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (nBu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. Platinum electrodes were used at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with the Fc/Fc+ redox system as an internal reference oxidation potential. Films for UV-vis spectroscopy experiments were prepared by spin-casting 5 mg mL−1polymer solutions from chloroform (at 800 rpm). Their thicknesses were measured on a Dektak 150 profilometer (Veeco Metrology Group).

          OTFT fabrication and measurement
Active organic semiconductor layers were deposited on phenyltrichlorosilane (PTS) or octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)-modified SiO2/Si substrates by spin-casting from 5 mg mL−1 or drop-casting from 1 mg mL−1polymer solutions in chloroform respectively. Samples were dried overnight under vacuum. 40 nm thick gold electrodes were deposited on the polymer films through a shadow mask. I–V characterization was carried out using a Keithley 4200, four-channel semiconductor parametric analyzer with femtoamp resolution. All devices were electrically tested inside a nitrogen glovebox.
Solar cell fabrication and measurement

          Indium
          tin oxide (ITO) on glass was cleaned and deposited with a 30 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer of resistivity 1 kΩ cm. The polymers were dissolved in o-DCB overnight at 60 °C. PCBM was then blended with the polymer solution for 3 h at 95 °C. The hot blend was immediately spin-cast on ITO at 400–700 rpm over 70 s. The resulting films were allowed to dry and solvent anneal overnight in a covered Petri dish under room temperature, before depositing 100 nm thick aluminium electrodes through a shadow mask. The active layer thickness of the solar cells is typically 70–90 nm. I–V characterization was carried out in the dark and under simulated 1 sun AM 1.5 radiation with a Keithly 2400 source meter. Illumination was achieved with a 91160 300 W Oriel solar simulator equipped with a 6258 ozone-free Xe lamp and an air mass AM 1.5 G filter. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation of the solar cell films was done using a Multimode Nanoscope III with Extender electronics (Veeco Metrology Group).
Synthesis
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without purification. The various comonomers—the pentacene regioisomers (TIPSE-Br22P),22,24(3,3′-didodecyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (BT)27 and (4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (CPDT)28—were synthesized according to reported procedures.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of the pentacene-containing copolymers is summarized in Scheme 1. As we have reported,24 the seven-step synthesis of the regioisomers 2,9-TIPSE-Br22P and 2,10-TIPSE-Br22P depended on a pivotal separation step, where silanated precursors 2,9-Br22-3,10-TMS22PQ and 2,10-Br22-3,9-TMS22PQ were fractionally recrystallized from o-DCB. The pure monomers were then condensed with bis-stannylated bithiophene and cyclopentadithiophenevia Stille cross-coupling. To demonstrate the effects of regioregularity, we also synthesized regiorandom copolymers, with mixed dibromopentacene monomers and the same thiophene-based comonomers, as control materials. The molecular weights and polydispersity of the two sets of six copolymers, hereby termed PnBTs and PnCPDTs, were measured by size exclusion chromatography eluted with tetrahydrofuran, and are summarized in Table 1. Stille coupling yielded high molecular weight polymers, with Mn generally above 20000 g mol−1. These polymers generally exhibited good thermal stability up to almost 400 °C, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry thermographs did not reveal visible melting or crystallization transitions for all polymer samples. (Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the thermal properties of PnBT-2,9 as a representative of all six polymers).

Electrochemical and optical properties

Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical and optical properties of the six polymers; their UV-Vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1. All of the polymers possess low band gaps of 1.65 eV or less. Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, as measured from cyclic voltammetry in solution, are relatively shallow ranging from −4.9 to −4.8 eV. For PnBT, the pentacene-bithiophene series, PnBT-2,9 measured a slightly lower band gap in solution as compared to PnBT-2,10 and PnBT-RRa. More clearly, its λmax at around 690 nm is red-shifted by 10 nm as compared to the latter two. This could be a result of the continuous conjugation of the 2,9-structure, which is absent in the 2,10-structure and reduced in the RRa-structure, leading to a slightly longer conjugation length. In the thin-film state, the optical band gaps of all three polymers are essentially the same, and almost unchanged from that in solution states. The difference between the λmaxs of PnBT-2,9 and 2,10 or RRa is reduced. This agrees with the hypothesis that, while the 2,9-conjugated polymer has the most extended conjugation, leading to more extensive frontier orbital overlap and a lower band gap in a single molecule state, the aggregation behavior of the polymers is similar enough to be indiscernible from UV-Vis spectroscopy. The CPDT series carries a somewhat more obvious trend where PnCPDT-2,9 possesses the lowest band gap in both single molecule state and in film. As compared to the BT series, the HOMO levels of all the PnCPDTpolymers are slightly elevated, indicating that CPDT is a stronger donor compared to BT. Slightly earlier absorption onsets were also measured for the 2,9 polymer in the CPDT series, both in film and in solution. On the other hand, the spectroscopic differences observed did not form obvious trends in general. More conclusive evidence with regards to the polymer's structural and device properties will follow.

Charge transport properties characterized with OTFT devices
To characterize their charge transport properties, thin-film transistors with bottom-gate top-contact geometry were fabricated for the six polymers where the active materials were spin-cast onto phenyltrichlorosilane-treated SiO2 surfaces. The resulting devices showed hole mobilities on the order of 10−4 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The regioregular BTpolymers showed higher mobilities, compared to their CPDT counterparts. First, the BT series achieved higher hole mobilities overall than the CPDT series, especially when the regioregular polymers of the two series are compared. The bulky branched sidechains on CPDT, which also extend out of the polymer backbone plane, could hinder packing and the formation of an ordered morphology, thus limiting the charge transport properties. Interestingly, the 2,9-copolymers achieved hole mobilities two to ten times higher than their 2,10- and regiorandom counterparts, in both the BT and the CPDT series.
This observation could be attributed to several factors. On inspection of the structures, and as suggested by the optical measurements (vide supra), the 2,9-polymers' continuous conjugation as compared to the 2,10- and RRa-polymers could lead to larger extent of conjugation and better delocalization of charges. On the other hand, the differences in optical properties are slight; advanced spectroscopic techniques are needed to determine whether or not they play a role in localizing charges and determining transport properties. Second, PnBT-2,9, the polymer showing the highest hole mobility at 3.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, also has the highest molecular weight at 58 kg mol−1. It has been demonstrated that poly(3-hexylthiophene) with higher molecular weight exhibits better charge transport30,31 owing to more interconnected crystalline domains. However, it should be noted that PnBT-2,9's rigid and rod-shaped backbone could cause an overestimation of its molecular weight as measured by size exclusion, and as a result may not dramatically differ from those of PnBT-2,10 and PnBT-RRa. A final hypothesis is that a 2,9-conjugation is likely to bring about a linear polymer backbone, especially for the PnBT case, as compared to a “zig-zag” or spiral conformation that could result from 2,10-conjugation. The former would enable polymer chains to more effective π-stack in the solid state and form more ordered domains. This hypothesis is supported by evidence from grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) studies of the polymer thin films, as detailed in the following section.
The GIXD scattering patterns (Fig. 2a) corresponded with TFT data, whereby the highest performing PnBT-2,9 formed the most crystalline film. As the in-plane scattering intensity profiles of the PnBTpolymers (Fig. 2b) indicate, scattering peaks that indicate the presence of crystallites oriented in the plane of the substrate were observed only for PnBT-2,9. Peak intensities and widths are lower and widened for PnBT-2,10 and PnBT-RRa. These two polymers, despite differing device performance—where hole mobilities of the former are three times those of the latter—did not show appreciable differences in their thin-film diffraction patterns, neither did the CPDT series, where no in-plane peaks could be observed for any of the polymers. These polymers, being generally disordered, do not exhibit significant morphological difference despite having disparate charge transport properties.

(b) In-plane (left) and out-of-plane (right) diffraction intensity profiles for PnBT. PnBT-2,9 shows diffraction patterns, especially in-plane, with the most defined peaks. (010) and (100) peaks, corresponding to polymer π-stacking and lamellar distances, are observed in and out of the substrate plane respectively. 
For PnBT-2,9, the (010) and (100) peaks, corresponding to polymer π-stacking and lamellar spacings, are primarily observed in and out of the substrate plane, respectively. The (010) peaks at a qxy value of around 1.5 Å−1 correspond to a π-stacking distance of 4.1–4.2 Å for all three polymers. A small amount of scattering intensities at a qz value of around 1.5 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, indicating π-stacking perpendicular to the substrate is also present. Lamellar spacings are observed at qz = 0.43 Å−1 and 0.40 Å−1 for PnBT-2,9 and PnBT-2,10/RRa, respectively. This indicates a slightly shorter layer spacing for the 2,9 (14.5 Å) than for the other two polymers (15.8 Å).
Device fabrication conditions were further optimized for the best performing PnBT-2,9. When films were drop-cast from a solution in chloroform onto a crystalline octadecylsilyl-treated SiO2 surface,17 hole mobilities improved by an order of magnitude, to around 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, while on–off ratios and threshold voltages remained roughly the same (Table 2). Moreover, n-channel transport was observed in nitrogen, with electron mobilities at rather balanced values of around 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fig. 3 illustrates the representative current–voltage behavior of these ambipolar devices. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans (Fig. 4) for the surfaces of PnBT-2,9/OTS devices revealed somewhat more defined features as compared to PnBT-2,9/PTS surfaces. The dense silane layer could have also helped to passivate from the oxide surface, freeing electrons from traps from SiOH bonds under n-channel measurement conditions, and enabling ambipolar transport.

Photovoltaic properties
The polymers' low band gap makes them attractive candidates for photovoltaic cells. However, bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated showed poor performance, less than 0.4% power conversion efficiency, as summarized in Table 3. All polymers performed optimally in blend films composing of 80% phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) by weight. Low current density up to 2 mA cm−2 could be attributed to the low film absorption coefficient of pentacene-containing polymers, generally on the order of 10−4 cm−1 (Fig. S2†), in the visible wavelengths. As a result, the PnCPDT series, being three to six times more absorbing than the PnBT series, generated higher current densities. The polymers' low solubility in o-DCB, at 5 mg mL−1, also limited the investigation of thicker, more absorbing films. It is worth noting that blending with high-boiling processing additives could potentially improve the solar cell performance, as it has been previously shown in another acene-cyclopentadithiophene based system (Fig. 5).

It is to be noted that pentacene forms Diels–Alder adducts with fullerenes,32,33 and we have previously verified the instantaneous formation of impurities upon mixing mm-TIPSEBr22P and PC61BM with NMR spectroscopy.34 Similar degradation was also observed for PnCPDT-RRa (used as an example for verification), upon mixing with PC61BM's NMR at 50 °C over 3 h. Therefore, a direct chemical incompatibility of the bulk heterojunction components may be a major factor to the low current densities observed.
The 2,9-conjugated polymers once again showed higher power conversion efficiency due to higher photocurrent. Better charge transport properties, of which better field-effect transistor performance is an indication, could have enhanced charge collection efficiency in these polymers. The 2,10-conjugated polymers yield higher power conversion efficiencies than their regiorandom counterparts; however, less obvious trends overall in the open-circuit voltages preclude further conclusions. AFM topographs of blend films (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) of PnCPDT-2,9 and PnCPDT-2,10 show smooth and essentially featureless surfaces, which do not provide morphological evidence for the device performance differences observed.
Conclusions
The ability to prepare pure regioisomers of pentacene monomers allows us to prepare regioregular pentacene-bithiophene (PnBT) and cyclopentadithiophene (PnCPDT) copolymers. Just as previously synthesized regioregular polymers with diethynylbenzene comonomer (PnDEBs), the 2,9-polymers show the highest field-effect hole mobilities as compared to the 2,10- and regiorandom counterparts. X-Ray scattering shows that thin films of PnBT-2,9 exhibit the highest degree of order, with lamellae and π-stacked features observed out of and in the substrate plane, respectively. This contrasts with the 2,10- or RRa-polymers' relatively disordered morphologies. This confirms that regioregularity is essential for conjugated polymers to form ordered structures. Furthermore, within the regioregular 2,9- and 2,10-polymers, the direction of conjugation-extension for pentacene also impacts its thin-film order, with PnBT-2,9's more linear and rod-like backbone being able to come closer together and form more ordered domains for better charge transport, as compared to PnBT-2,10's bent backbone. This suggests that there exists an optimum backbone shape to enable close packing. Therefore the structure–property relationship of these regioregular pentacene polymers enabled us to gain insight towards material design to enhance charge transport and performance. With improved device fabrication conditions, PnBT-2,9 achieved a moderate TFT hole mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon optimization of device fabrication conditions. PnCPDT-2,9 achieved the highest bulk heterojunction photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies up to 0.33%.
