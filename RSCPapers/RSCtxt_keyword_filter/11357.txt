    , Accepted 18th May 2021First published on 31st May 2021AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) Y6 have drawn tremendous attention due to the great progress in their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Recently, experimental researchers found that the performance of BTPT-4F (like Y6 but having different side alkyl chains and a shorter fused-ring skeleton simultaneously) based OSCs is much worse than that of Y6 based OSCs. However, it is still confusing how the individual change of the fused-ring skeleton length or side alkyl chains of Y6 affects the photovoltaic properties, especially molecular arrangements and electron mobility. Therefore, we have modelled possible molecular arrangements of Y6, BTPT-4F, and two new intermediate NFAs, named BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12, to systematically study the effects. The computed results could explain the experiment well, and show that terminal/central side alkyl chains and the length of the fused-ring skeleton all have noticeable influences on molecular planarity and arrangements. The outputs also illustrate that extending the fused-ring skeleton can increase electron mobility more than engineering side alkyl chains, and high electron mobility mainly depends on the formation of close face-on stacking of end groups and overlapping of partially flat backbones. Last but not least, both BTPTT-4F-C12 and BTPTT-4F-C8 are superior to Y6 in dipole moment, absorption spectra, charge separation, and electron mobility.
1. Introduction
The continuous breakthrough of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) is mainly due to successful syntheses and developments of new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs),1 hence researchers are paying more attention to NFAs. They have great advantages such as tunable energy levels and absorption range, better solubility, and lower energy loss relative to fullerene acceptors.2–4 So far, researchers have mainly focused on novel NFA syntheses, and the device engineering and morphological optimization of the OSCs based on NFAs.5–7 Now the highest PCE of NFA based OSCs has exceeded 18%.8 This should be attributed to the emergence of a series of excellent NFAs such as ITIC1 and Y6.9 In 2015, Zhan et al. firstly reported a non-fullerene small molecule ITIC, and the device fabricated in combination with polymer donor PTB7-TH achieved a new record PCE of 6.8% for fullerene-free OSCs.1 Later, Zou et al. designed and synthesized a novel non-fullerene small molecule acceptor Y6, and the PCE of the OSC (with copolymer donor PM6) was improved up to 15.7% in 2019.9 Such rapid progress is mainly because of the superiority of the structure of Y6, which has an A2–DA1D–A2 (A: acceptor; D: donor) type of molecular structure. The A2 peripheral groups of Y6 are composed of two strong electron-withdrawing groups called 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC); and the central unit DA1D consists of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT). The long side alkyl chains were also introduced on the central skeleton to increase the solubility and suppress the excessive phase separation domain.10 In addition, a donor–acceptor fused compound can cause a strong intramolecular electron push–pull effect, thus regulating the energy levels and absorption spectra.4 Because of the A2–DA1D–A2 framework, Y6 has enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects. Therefore, it has strong absorption strength in the visible and near-infrared regions.9
The OSCs based on Y6 have achieved outstanding photovoltaic efficiency by matching with many polymer donor materials,8,11–13 which proves that it is a very promising small molecule acceptor. Since then, a large number of modifications of Y6 have been developed.14–16 On one hand, researchers found that increasing the length of central alkyl chains of Y6 appropriately can improve the PCE slightly. For instance, a high efficiency of 15.89% of an OSC (donor: PBDB-TF) was achieved by increasing the length of central side alkyl chains from eight to nine carbon atoms to synthesize a novel NFA Y6-C2.17 Hou et al. increased the length of central alkyl chains by replacing 2-ethylhexyl of Y6 (named BTP-4F-8 too) with 2-butyloctyl to obtain BTP-4F-12, and the PCE of the OSC (PBDB-TF/BTP-4F-12) was 16.4%.18 On the other hand, increasing the length of the fused ring skeleton of NFAs is also one of the effective strategies to improve the PCE. Y6 can be traced back to the synthesis of a small organic molecule BZIC. It was first synthesized by Zou et al., and the PCE of the HFQx-T/BZIC OSC was 6.3%.19 Then, a new molecule Y1 was obtained by fusing thienyl into the backbone of BZIC, and a PCE of 13.4% of the PBDB-T/Y1 OSC was achieved.20 Another counter example is the BTPT-4F NFA, which was synthesized and modified from Y6 by Huang et al.21 The main differences of this NFA from Y6 are: (1) the two thiophene rings in the fused-ring backbone and the two terminal side alkyl chains are removed from Y6; (2) 2-ethylhexyl in the central side alkyl chains is replaced with 2-butyloctyl,21 as shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, in the experiment, the PCE of the OSC based on Y6 (donor: a wide-bandgap copolymer donor P2F-EHp) was up to 16.02%. But, the efficiency of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F OSC was only 1.09%. Very recently, Zhang et al. theoretically studied the exciton dissociation and charge recombination at the donor/acceptor interfaces using P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/Y6 bi-molecular models by replacing all side alkyl chains with methyl groups, further explaining why the Y6-based OSC is superior to the BTPT-4F based OSC.22

The difference between BTPTT-4F and BTPTT-4F-C8 is highlighted in blue; the difference between BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 is highlighted in red; and the difference between BTPTT-4F-C12 and BTPT-4F is highlighted in purple. 
As mentioned above, clearly, researchers have made great progress in Y6 molecular modifications. However, a systematic study on how the individual change of terminal/central side alkyl chains or fused-ring skeleton length of Y6 affects its photovoltaic properties is still missing, and many open questions need answers. For example, the length of the fused-ring backbone and the side alkyl chains of BTPT-4F are both changed with respect to Y6, therefore it is hard to know which factor is more important for the PCE change. In addition, there are two types of side alkyl chains: terminal and central positions on the Y6 backbone. So, one question arises: which position has more influence on morphology and photovoltaic properties when the side alkyl chains are changed? Answering these questions is critical for the further improvement of the photovoltaic properties of Y6-based OSCs.17,23
Therefore, in this work, we have respectively modelled the possible molecular arrangements of Y6 (BTPTT-4F), BTPT-4F, and two new intermediate molecules named BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12, as shown in Fig. 1, to systematically study the individual influences of the changes of fused-ring skeleton length or terminal/central side alkyl chains on molecular arrangements and electron mobility, which have been proved to be critical for the performance of OSCs in many cases.21,24,25 Furthermore, the optimized structures of the four molecules are given in the ESI,† Fig. S1. For consistency and clarity, we shall use BTPTT-4F instead of Y6 in the rest of this paper. BTPTT-4F-C8 is obtained by removing the terminal linear alkyl chains from BTPTT-4F (Y6), and the difference is highlighted in blue on BTPTT-4F (Y6); the difference between BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 is only the length of the central alkyl branch chains and is highlighted in red; the difference between BTPTT-4F-C12 and BTPT-4F is only the length of the fused-rings on the backbone and is highlighted in purple on BTPTT-4F-C12. Through this way, every time we only change one ‘variable’ (the central/terminal side alkyl chain or the length of the fused ring). On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT),26 time dependent DFT,27 semi-classical Marcus theory28 and the Marcus–Levich–Jortner (M–L–J) formula29 are utilized to calculate the key parameters including binding energy, reorganization energy, electronic coupling, and electron mobility of these NFAs since they are the most cost-effective methods for the calculations of electronic structures and charge transport properties of organic molecules.22,30–33
2. Computational details
Most calculations were accomplished with the Gaussian 09 Rev E.01 version software package.34 To simulate the surrounding environment of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F in the solid state, the integral equation formalism variant polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM)35 was applied in all calculations. Simultaneously, the chosen solvent was dibutyl-ether (ε = 3.0).36 We run the geometry optimizations with the B3LYP37 hybrid density functional and the 6-31G(d)38 basis set for monomers because B3LYP can accurately reproduce the organic molecular structures,26 and the 6-31G(d) basis set has achieved satisfactory results in previous studies.31,39 To study molecular arrangements in the solid state, we built seven dimer configurations of these compounds. The morphology in thin films consists of different dimer configurations, and studying them can unveil basic molecular arrangements in the solid state.31,40 The B3LYP+GD3/6-31G(d)/PCM theory level was used for dimers of these compounds, where Grimme's dispersion with the original D3 damping functional (GD3) was utilized to estimate non-covalent interactions.41
The theory level used in this work was based on thorough benchmark calculations with different combinations of density functionals and basis sets, and the experimental frontier molecular orbital energy of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F was used to calibrate them. Three density functionals B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and tuned ωB97X with basis set 6-31G(d) were first applied to calculate the HOMO/LUMO/gap energy of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F monomers and dimers, and then other basis sets i.e. 6-311G(d) and 6-311G(d,p) were selected to consider the basis set effects.
The range-separation parameter ω of the long range corrected (LRC) functional ωB97X can be optimized by minimizing the following equations: J2(ω) = JN2(ω) + JN+12(ω)(1) JN2(ω) = [εωHOMO(N) + Eω(N − 1) − Eω(N)]2(2) JN+12(ω) = [εωHOMO(N+1) + Eω(N) − Eω(N + 1)]2(3)where εωHOMO(N)/εωHOMO(N + 1) represents the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the neutral/anion system, respectively. Eω(N)/Eω(N − 1)/Eω(N + 1) denotes the corresponding total energy of the neutral/cation/anion system, respectively. Here, N, N − 1 and N + 1 mean the number of electrons in the neutral, cation and anion systems. In this work, the optimized ω parameters obtained with the ωB97X/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F are 0.017 and 0.015 Bohr−1, respectively.
The binding energy (Ebinding) was calculated to study the interaction energy of dimers, and the formula is as follows Ebinding = |2Emonomers −Edimers|(4)where Emonomers/Edimers represents the energy of monomers/dimers, respectively. In addition, the intermolecular distances were measured by excluding all the alkyl side chains because they have no significant contributions to charge transfer. Three key distances were presented, i.e., the shortest atom distance (DA) between two skeletons, the geometry center distance (DGC) between two backbones, and the average distance (DAve) of DA and DGC.31
The electron mobility (μe) in these NFAs was calculated by using the Einstein–Smoluchowski formula42–44 (5)Here e is the elementary charge; D denotes the diffusion coefficient of the charge carriers; kB is the Boltzmann constant; and T represents the absolute temperature (T = 298.15 K). In this study, the electron mobility was calculated in one dimension because of dimer modelling, hence there is a formula45 (6)where r denotes the charge transfer distance between two adjacent molecules. Note that we used the DGC value to obtain the charge transfer distance.46 Furthermore, k means the charge transfer rate constant, which can be calculated with the semi-classical Marcus formula of the hopping model28,47 (7)Here, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. One can see that k mainly depends on two key parameters, i.e. V and λ values. The parameter V denotes the electronic coupling (or transfer integral) between adjacent molecules, and λ means the reorganization energy, including both intramolecular (λi) and intermolecular (λo) reorganization energies.
Considering the nuclear relaxation following charge transfer, we also applied the Marcus–Levich–Jortner (M–L–J) formula29,48 (8)where n′ represents the final vibrational level (initial vibrational level n = 0); ωeff is the frequency of one effective mode incorporating the effect of all quantum modes in an average way, and ωeff = 1500 cm−1 was selected by using the CC stretching high frequency;49–51Seff is the effective Huang–Rhys factor, which reflects the coupling degree of electron and nuclear vibration (or phonon), and the Seff values of the four NFAs can be calculated according to the formula .
The electronic coupling (V) for electron transfer (ET) is defined by eqn (9)52–54 (9)where Hif is the non-diagonal element of a two-state Hamiltonian matrix; Sif denotes the overlap between the initial and final states; and Hii/Hff is the Hamiltonian of the initial/final state of charge transfer respectively. The overall electronic coupling is computed directly with the “1 + 1” approach in the Q-Chem 4.3.2.1 program package,55 where the zeroth order wave-functions are composed of the HF wave-functions of the two fragments.
Meanwhile, the intramolecular reorganization energy (λi) can be estimated by56 λi = [E0(A−) − E0(A0)] + [E−(A0) − E−(A−)](10)where E0(A−) is the energy of the neutral molecule in the equilibrium geometry of the anion state; E−(A0) represents the energy of the anion in the equilibrium geometry of the neutral molecule; and E0(A0)/E−(A−) means the energy of the neutral/anion molecule in the equilibrium geometry, respectively.
Considering the environmental effect, the external reorganization energy (λo) is defined as the energy required for nuclear relaxation and electron polarization of the surrounding molecules of acceptor dimers during charge transfer. The calculation formula of external reorganization energy (λo) was given as30,57 (11)where Δe is the element charge; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10-12 F/m); and εopt/εs denotes the optical/static permittivity of the solvents, which was set to 2.0/3.0 respectively. Additionally, RD/RA represents the effective radius of the donor/acceptor, respectively. In these dimer configurations, there is an equality of RD = RA, so rDA was set as the effective radius of the dimers.
Finally, the molecular electrostatic potential plots of monomers obtained with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level were drawn with GaussView Rev 5.0.8. Then, the Multiwfn Rev 3.7 software package58 was used to calculate the intramolecular electron transition distance (DCT) and charge transfer amount (qCT). The electron/hole distribution of monomers calculated with the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level was generated with the Multiwfn Rev 3.7 program58 based on TDDFT outputs and was drawn with the IQmol software package.59 Furthermore, the transition density matrix of monomers based on the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level was also generated and drawn with the Multiwfn Rev 3.7 program58 based on TDDFT outputs.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Dimer configurations
Considering the influence of the molecular arrangements and film morphology on electron mobility, we have modelled seven possible dimer configurations of the four NFAs. In order to explain the effect of changing fused-ring skeleton length and/or side alkyl chains on molecular packing, the same initial configurations are constructed as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the optimized dimer configurations are as shown in the ESI† Fig. S2–S8. Note that all the side alkyl chains are retained in all optimizations and calculations, but are omitted for clarity in these figures. Configurations 1–7 represent bi-molecular parallel (2BTPTT-1/2BTPTT-C8-1/2BTPTT-C12-1/2BTPT-1), anti-parallel (2BTPTT-2/2BTPTT-C8-2/2BTPTT-C12-2/2BTPT-2), end-group overlap (2BTPTT-3/2BTPTT-C8-3/2BTPTT-C12-3/2BTPT-3), end-group anti-overlap (2BTPTT-4/2BTPTT-C8-4/2BTPTT-C12-4/2BTPT-4), vertical (with central sulfur atoms pointing left, 2BTPTT-5/2BTPTT-C8-5/2BTPTT-C12-5/2BTPT-5), anti-vertical (with central sulfur atoms pointing right, 2BTPTT-6/2BTPTT-C8-6/2BTPTT-C12-6/2BTPT-6), and tail to tail overlap (2BTPTT-7/2BTPTT-C8-7/2BTPTT-C12-7/2BTPT-7) configurations respectively.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representations of the initial dimer configurations with Y6 as a sample: (a) parallel; (b) anti-parallel; (c) end-group overlap; (d) end-group anti-overlap; (e) vertical-left; (f) vertical-right; and (g) tail to tail overlap. The side alkyl chains are omitted for clarity. 
Molecular planarity is crucial for charge transfer nature, therefore the dihedral angles of four monomers and all dimers are measured.4,10 We analyzed three characteristic dihedral angles of BTPTT-4F (α1, β1, γ1), BTPTT-4F-C8 (α2, β2, γ2), BTPTT-4F-C12 (α3, β3, γ3), and BTPT-4F (α4, β4, γ4) monomers and dimers, as shown in Fig. 3, to illustrate the changes of molecular planarity before and after dimerization. Note that α and β represent the dihedral angles between the center donor unit and two peripheral acceptor units, and γ denotes the planarity of the central donor unit. All measured angles are available in the ESI,† Table S1. For these monomers, because of the longer conjugated skeleton length, BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 have smaller α (range: 0.03–1.27°) and β (range: 0.05–0.47°) dihedral angles than BTPT-4F (α: 5.22°; β: 2.63°), whereas the γ (range: 11.15–11.66°) dihedral angles of the four molecules are similar and much larger than α and β because of the steric effects of two central side alkyl chains. Overall, BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 have better planarity of backbones than BTPT-4F because of the longer conjugation skeleton length. Also, for these monomers, removing terminal side alkyl chains does not change the planarity noticeably, neither does changing the central side alkyl chains.
 Fig. 3  Illustration of selected α, β, and γ dihedral angles of BTPTT-4F/BTPTT-4F-C8/BTPTT-4F-C12 (left) and BTPT-4F (right). Color codes: grey—carbon, white—hydrogen, yellow—sulfur, red—oxygen, light blue—fluorine and blue—nitrogen. The side alkyl chains are omitted for clarity. 
After dimerization, the planarity of the backbones of these molecules is changed due to intermolecular interactions, and larger dihedral angles can be generally observed with respect to the monomers. For BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F dimers, the ranges of α/β/γ dihedral angles are 0.42–19.87°/0.69–23.96°/7.63–23.87°, 0.18–13.73°/0.29–10.94°/6.33–16.72°, 0.05–15.55°/0.17–12.19°/0.18–15.63°, and 0.63–33.69°/0.92–18.61°/4.51–14.04°, respectively. Clearly, removing the terminal side alkyl chains of BTPTT-4F generally benefits the planarity of individual molecules somehow in these dimers because the ranges of the three dihedral angles of BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F dimers are generally smaller than those of BTPTT-4F. One exception is BTPT-4F, in which the value of α is up to 33.69°. In addition, increasing the length of the central side alkyl chains generally increases the α and β values (more twist between the central unit and peripheral acceptor units), but decreases the γ (better planarity of the donor unit) according to the dihedral angles of BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 dimers. On the other hand, changing the length of the fused-ring backbone also affects the planarity. Comparing BTPTT-4F-C12 to BTPT-4F (both having the same side alkyl chains), obviously, reducing the length of the fused-ring backbone increases the ranges of α and β, but decreases the range of γ. These delicate changes of planarity may influence electronic coupling for charge transfer. We shall discuss this later.
In order to analyze the torsion of the molecules more comprehensively, we also select BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F as two representatives to measure all dihedral angles between each fused-ring of the central skeleton (DA1D), which are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S9 and listed in Table S2. It can be seen that the changes of these dihedral angles are small (<10°) because both central fused-ring skeletons are exceedingly rigid and planar.
3.2 Benchmark
In this part, the frontier molecular orbital energies of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F monomers and dimers are calculated with the three functionals B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and tuned ωB97X functionals and the 6-31G(d) basis set via PCM (ε = 3.0) and listed in the ESI,† Fig. S10 and S11 and Table S3. For clarity, the HOMO/LUMO/gap energies of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F in the solid films measured by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in the experiment are marked with black dotted lines in the ESI,† Fig. S10–S1. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S10, for B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and tuned ωB97X functionals, the ranges of HOMO/LUMO/gap values of BTPTT-4F are: −5.49 to −5.38/−3.58 to −3.44/1.86–2.01 eV, −6.50 to −6.38/−2.72 to −2.56/3.73–3.90 eV and −5.31 to −5.20/−3.13 to −3.01/2.13–2.27 eV. In the experiment, the HOMO/LUMO/gap energy of the BTPTT-4F neat film is −5.68/−4.06/1.62 eV, respectively. The calculated results of the B3LYP and tuned ωB97X functionals are relatively close to the experiment compared with those of the CAM-B3LYP functional, and the frontier molecular orbital energies obtained with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level are the closest to the experimental results. Moreover, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S11, the ranges of HOMO/LUMO/gap values of BTPT-4F for the B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and tuned ωB97X functionals are: −5.80 to −5.60/−3.75 to −3.59/1.90–2.11 eV, −6.83 to −6.60/−2.85 to −2.69/3.78–4.02 eV and −5.60 to −5.42/−3.33 to −3.20/2.13–2.32 eV. We know that the experimental HOMO/LUMO/gap energy of BTPT-4F neat films is −5.73/−4.00/1.73 eV, respectively. Indeed, the B3LYP density functional seems to be the most suitable for predicting the frontier molecular orbital energy in this work.
In addition, the basis set effects are also considered. The frontier molecular orbital energies of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F monomers and dimers are calculated with density functional B3LYP and basis sets 6-31G(d), 6-311G(d), and 6-311G(d,p) via PCM (ε = 3.0), as shown in the ESI,† Table S4. For the sake of clarity, the average HOMO/LUMO/gap values of all configurations are considered for discussion. It can be seen that the difference between the calculated results based on the 6-311G(d) and 6-311G(d, p) basis sets is negligible. The HOMO/LUMO energies based on them are closer to the experimental values, and they are about 0.20–0.25 eV lower than those based on the 6-31G(d) basis set; however, the gap energies are all similar. Overall, the data obtained with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level are feasible too.
Finally, we chose the B3LYP/6-311G(d, p)/PCM(ε = 3.0) theory level to calculate the frontier molecular orbital energies of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F monomers and dimers. As shown in Table 1, the HOMO and LUMO values of BTPTT-4F are both 0.04 eV higher than those of BTPTT-4F-C8. The BTPTT-4F and BTPTT-4F-C8 monomers both have almost the same gap energy, indicating that the terminal side alkyl chains have little influence on the frontier molecular orbital energies. Similarly, the difference between BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 is also negligible, showing that the influence of central side alkyl chain modification on the frontier molecular orbital energies is subtle too. However, compared with BTPTT-4F-C12, BTPT-4F has obviously lower HOMO/LUMO values and a higher gap energy, which can explain the blue-shifted absorption spectra and lower the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the OSCs based on the BTPT-4F acceptor in the experiment.21 Hence, according to the analyses of the frontier molecular orbital results, we confirm that shortening the fused-ring skeleton will lead to the decrease of VOC values and the blue-shift of the absorption spectra.

3.3 Dipole moment and molecular electrostatic potential
Molecular dipole moment has a crucial influence on the morphology of an OSC. An appropriately enhanced dipole moment can strengthen molecular self-assembly and improve molecule crystallinity.60,61 In contrast, excessive dipole moment will lead to unnecessary aggregation, which is not conducive to phase separation and exciton decomposition.62 The dipole moments of these monomers are computed and given in the ESI,† Fig. S12. Obviously, the dipole moment (11.64 D) of BTPT-4F is about 13 times larger than that (0.86 D) of BTPTT-4F, which would form unnecessarily large domains. Indeed, in the experiment, OSC P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F has a larger domain size (root mean-square roughness – RMS: 4.84 nm) than OSC P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F (RMS: 1.22 nm).21 The large grain is bad for donor–acceptor interpenetration, and is detrimental to the efficient charge separation at the donor–acceptor interfaces.21 In addition, the dipole moments of BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 are 2.94 D and 2.96 D respectively, which are about 3.4 times larger than that of BTPTT-4F. Clearly, removing the terminal alkyl linear chains can enhance the dipole moment significantly, but increasing the length of the central branched alkyl chains has little influence on the dipole moment. Shortening the fused-ring backbone can even enhance the dipole moment more: both BTPTT-4F-C12 and BTPT-4F have the same central side alkyl chains, but the dipole moment of BTPT-4F is almost 4 times larger than that of BTPTT-4F-C12.
Furthermore, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F monomers based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level are presented in the ESI,† Fig. S13. The potential values of the molecules are set from −0.03 a.u. (the deepest red) to 0.03 a.u. (the deepest blue). Because of the A2–DA1D–A2 (A: acceptor; D: donor) type of molecular structure, the negative charge regions of these molecules are mainly located at the terminal groups and the central benzothiadiazole (BT), while the thiophene ring and alkyl side chains on the skeletons are positively charged. In addition, BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 have similar MEP maps.
3.4 Electron/hole distribution and transition density matrix
The electron/hole distributions of the first bright excited states of the four molecules based on the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level, used to investigate intramolecular charge transfer properties, are given in Fig. 4. Overall, the intramolecular charge transfer amounts (qCT) of the four monomers do not change too much (0.354–0.424), indicating that changing the skeleton length or side alkyl chains has a small influence on qCT. However, the intramolecular charge transition distance (DCT) of BTPTT-4F/BTPTT-4F-C8/BTPTT-4F-C12 is 1.555/1.787/1.792 Å, respectively; obviously, removing the terminal side alkyl chains increases DCT noticeably, but increasing the central branched side alkyl chains has a very small influence. In addition, these DCTs are clearly much longer than that of BTPT-4F (0.527 Å). This is mainly because of their longer conjugated skeletons, which means that the intramolecular charge recombination of BTPTT-4F/BTPTT-4F-C8/BTPTT-4F-C12 after local excitation should be harder than that of BTPT-4F. Consequently, the intermolecular charge transfer may be easier. Furthermore, one can see that removing the terminal side alkyl chains and shortening the length of the fused-ring skeleton increase the energy and oscillator strength of the first bright states.
 Fig. 4  Electron/hole distributions of the first bright local excited state of (a) BTPTT-4F (Y6); (b) BTPTT-4F-C8; (c) BTPTT-4F-C12; and (d) BTPT-4F obtained with the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level. The intramolecular electron transition distance (DCT), the intramolecular charge transfer amount (qCT), the local excited state energy (e), and the oscillator strength (f) of the four molecules are given. Red and green represent electrons and holes, respectively. 
In summary, only based on the computed results for monomers, we may conclude that removing terminal side alkyl chains may be a reasonable way to further improve the performance of Y6 because it can moderately increase the dipole moment (consequently increasing crystallinity), enhances photon absorption, and is favorable for intermolecular charge transfer simultaneously.
In addition, in order to understand the electron excitation phenomenon, the transition density matrix (TDM)32 of the S0 → S1 state based on the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level is presented in Fig. 5. Because all of the hydrogen atoms have little contribution to the transitions, we omit the hydrogen atoms in Fig. 5, and the detailed labels of the atoms are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S14. Furthermore, we know that the four molecules have the same A2–DA1D–A2 type of molecular structure, hence we subdivide these molecules into three parts: the central electron withdrawing part (A1), the electron donating part (D), and the terminal electron withdrawing part (A2). It can be seen that the TDM maps of the four molecules exhibit similar behaviors in that electron coherence mainly appears at the skeletons including the central A1, the terminal A2, and the D parts. These excitations are delocalized along the skeletons, which is consistent with Fig. 4. The dark parts in these TDM plots are from side alkyl chains, which are not involved in the excitations (also see the ESI,† Fig. S15). When looking carefully along the diagonals, we can see that electrons slightly migrate from the D to the A2/A1 part during excitation processes.

3.5 Binding energy and intermolecular distances
In this section, the binding energies and intermolecular distances i.e. DGC, DA, and DAve of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F dimers are calculated and listed in the ESI,† Fig. S16 and Tables S5 and S6. Based on the binding energy of the dimers, we can find most of the stable configurations. All the side alkyl chains are not included when measuring the intermolecular distances because they do not have much contribution to the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S16, removing terminal side alkyl chains clearly decreases the binding energy according to the binding energy data of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 dimers; that is, the binding energies of the BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 dimers are generally much smaller than that of BTPTT-4F. And increasing the central side alkyl chains generally increases the binding energy when observing the energy data of BTPTT-4F-C8 and BTPTT-4F-C12 dimers. Also, decreasing the length of the fused-ring skeleton obviously enhances the molecular stacking and the intermolecular distances are generally much smaller when comparing BTPTT-4F-12 to BTPT-4F. In addition, the intermolecular distances are roughly inversely related to the absolute value of binding energy. For instance, configuration 2BTPTT-7 (‘2’ means the dimer, and ‘7’ denotes the seventh configuration, and for simplicity, BTPTT is used instead of BTPTT-4F) is the most stable structure among the BTPTT-4F dimers, and the binding energy of this dimer configuration is 354.38 kJ mol−1; correspondingly, it has the shortest DAve of 3.57 Å. As expected, since in the third and fourth configurations there is only partial overlap between end groups, they have very long DGC values and the binding energies of these configurations are relatively small. In addition, due to the longer fused-ring skeleton of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12, in the end-group overlap configurations, DGC can be up to more than 18 Å, while the longest DGC in similar BTPT-4F configurations is only 14.84 Å. Clearly, different fused-ring skeleton lengths have a pronounced influence on charge transfer distance. In general, a long charge transfer distance may benefit high carrier mobility according to eqn (5) and (6). But, the short distance between the two backbones of the dimers may be conducive to electronic coupling. We shall discuss this dilemma later.
3.6 Reorganization energy
The calculation of reorganization energy (λ) includes internal and external parts. Internal reorganization energy (λi) is defined as the energy caused by the change of geometry (vibration mode) of acceptor dimers during the charge transfer processes, and external reorganization energy (λo) means the energy required for nuclear relaxation and electron polarization of the surrounding molecules of acceptor dimers during charge transfer. The calculated results of reorganization energy are listed in Table 2 in line with eqn (10) and (11), and the calculation of λi is based on the monomer model with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM (ε = 3.0) theory level. Considering the basis set effects, we list the λi values based on the 6-31G(d) and 6-311G(d, p) basis sets in the ESI,† Table S7. The results show that the difference between the two basis sets is only 0.003 eV, indicating that the basis set effects are negligible. Therefore, in Table 2, we only list the results obtained with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Obviously, BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 show a similar reorganization energy, which indicates less energy loss than BTPT-4F during the charge transfer process and is beneficial for electron mobility. The effect of removing the terminal side alkyl linear chain (BTPTT-4F-C8) and increasing the central alkyl branch chain length (BTPTT-4F-C12) on the total reorganization energy, as expected, is very small, and the differences are only 0.006 and 0.003 eV respectively. On the other hand, the influence of changing the fused-ring skeleton length is much stronger because the total reorganization energy of BTPT-4F during charge transfer is higher by 0.058 eV than that of BTPTT-4F-C12. In addition, the change of external reorganization energy due to different dimer configurations of one NFA is negligible (<0.001 eV), which can be attributed to the small differences in the effective radius of the dimers (see the ESI,† Table S8). In summary, BTPTT-4F/BTPT-4F has the smallest/largest reorganization energy during charge transfer processes.

3.7 Electronic coupling and electron mobility
Electronic coupling, i.e. electron transfer integral, characterizes the degree of molecular orbital overlap between two adjacent molecules.52 The probability of charge transfer increases towards larger electronic coupling.63 The calculated electronic coupling (V) and charge transfer rate constant (k) of these dimers are shown in Table 3 and the ESI,† Fig. S17. One can see that the k value has the same trend as V for all dimers of the four NFAs, indicating that the electronic coupling is a determinant of the rate constants.

Clearly, changing the side alkyl chains and the length of the fused-ring backbones has an important influence on electronic coupling. From BTPTT-4F to BTPTT-4F-C8 (deleting two terminal side alkyl chains), a higher electronic coupling is generally observed: the electronic coupling ranges are 2.55–45.26 and 3.45–56.80 meV respectively. This trend is consistent with the dihedral angle changes of the backbones. In our previous discussions, the ranges of α, β, and γ dihedral angles became smaller from BTPTT-4F (0.42–19.87°/0.69–23.96°/7.63–23.87°) to BTPTT-4F-C8 (0.18–13.73°/0.29–10.94°/6.33–16.72°), which can be attributed to smaller steric effects from removing the terminal side straight alkyl chains. The better planarity generally brings about better electronic coupling. This rule works too for the trend from BTPTT-4F-C8 to BTPTT-4F-C12. Increasing the central side alkyl chains somehow decreases the electron coupling due to steric effects. On the other hand, changing the length of the fused-ring backbones shows stronger effects on the electronic coupling. From BTPTT-4F-C12 to BTPT-4F (removing two thiophene rings from the backbone), most electronic coupling values drop: the electronic coupling ranges are 0.72–69.1 and 3.34–42.71 meV respectively. This is also generally consistent with the changes of the ranges of α, β, and γ dihedral angles (BTPTT-4F-C12: 0.05–15.55°/0.17–12.19°/0.18–15.63°; BTPT-4F: 0.63–33.69°/0.92–18.61°/4.51–14.04°) according to our previous discussions; that is, shortening the length of the fused-ring core would generally bring about worse planarity in the dimer.
To further understand the reason for high electronic coupling in different dimer configurations, we select the dimers with high electron coupling (>30 meV). We find that they generally share one character: end-group face-on stacking, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S18. This is consistent with the previous experimental and molecular dynamic simulation results,64,65 confirming the reliability of our modelling and computational methods. In addition, we have more new findings. We measure the geometric center distances between end-groups (Dend-group) in these dimers, as shown in Fig. 6 and the ESI,† Table S9. Generally, the typical end-group π–π stacking distance is less than 5 Å.10 According to the Dend-group values of the 12 dimers with high electron coupling, there are 7 dimers with Dend-group values smaller than 5 Å, and they are 2BTPTT-1 (4.25 Å), 2BTPTT-3 (3.61 Å), 2BTPTT-7 (3.53 Å), 2BTPTT-C8-3 (3.54 Å), 2BTPTT-C8-6 (4.31 Å), 2BTPTT-C12-3 (3.75 Å), and 2BTPT-4 (4.32 Å). In these configurations, two end groups are generally parallel and have good overlap; hence there is a large enough contact surface between them, benefitting strong electronic coupling. However, for 2BTPTT-C8-4 (5.80 Å), 2BTPTT-C12-4 (5.74 Å), 2BTPTT-C12-6 (5.68 Å), 2BTPTT-C12-7 (7.69 Å), and 2BTPT-3 (6.80 Å), the large electronic coupling cannot be explained with end-group face-on stacking anymore because of the larger Dend-group (>5 Å). In fact, the first and second largest electronic couplings are observed in 2BTPTT-C12-6 (5.68 Å) and 2BTPTT-C12-7 (7.69 Å) with long Dend-group, respectively. For these five dimer configurations, we can find that they share one common character: partly face-on flat backbone overlap, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S4, S5 and S7, S8. For example, looking at 2BTPTT-C12-7 (7.69 Å) with the longest end-group stacking distance in these dimers, the partial backbones of two BTPTT-4F-C12 molecules with good planarity (α, β, and γ dihedral angles all are smaller than 8°) have good overlap. This rule works for the other four dimer configurations with long end-group stacking distances too. This new finding is different from previous study results (end group stacking)64 and unveils the complexity of the influences of molecular stacking on electronic coupling.
 Fig. 6  End-group stacking and distances of the dimer configurations with high electron coupling. 
Next, the electron mobility (μe) of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F is presented in Table 4 and the ESI,† Fig. S19, and all of the detailed parameters i.e. charge transfer distance (r), the absolute value of electronic coupling (), reorganization energy (λ), charge transfer rate constant (k), and electron mobility (μe) are listed in the ESI,† Table S10. Clearly, the highest electron mobility of these four molecules comes from the end-group overlap or anti-overlap configurations because they have strong electronic coupling and long charge transfer distance simultaneously. The order of the highest μes of the four NFAs is 2BTPTT-C8-3 (10.84 cm2 V−1 s−1, V = 56.80 meV) > 2BTPTT-3 (7.40 cm2 V−1 s−1, V = 45.07 meV) > 2BTPTT-C12-3 (6.61 cm2 V−1 s−1, V = 43.34 meV) > 2BTPT-4 (2.05 cm2 V−1 s−1, V = 42.71 meV). Only the largest electronic coupling cannot guarantee the fastest electron mobility. Among them, 2BTPTT-C8-3 has the highest electron mobility of 10.84 cm2 V−1 s−1, and it is about 1.5 times higher than that of 2BTPTT-3 (the second highest mobility of 7.40 cm2 V−1 s−1). Without the terminal side linear alkyl chains, the steric effect in 2BTPTT-C8-3 is decreased (see Fig. 6) and the electronic coupling increases by 11.73 meV. In addition, the electron mobility of 2BTPTT-C8-3 is also about 1.6 times higher than that of 2BTPTT-C12-3 (6.61 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that the steric hindrance effect of BTPTT-4F-C12 is stronger (see Fig. 6). In sharp contrast, the electron mobility of 2BTPT-4, which has the highest value among BTPT-4F dimers, is only 2.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is 3.2 times lower than that of 2BTPTT-C12-3. Obviously, between BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F-C12, the difference is only the fused-ring skeleton length. BTPT-4F has the shorter skeleton length, leading to the decrease of electron transfer distance, the increase of reorganization energy, and the weakened electron coupling. As mentioned above, the effect of changes of the fused-ring skeleton length on electron mobility is more significant than that of the side alkyl chains. On the other hand, for the sake of systematic consideration, the ones with the lowest electron mobility among the seven configurations of the four NFAs cannot be ignored, which may determine the speed of the overall electron migration. The lowest electron mobility in BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F dimer configurations appears for 2BTPTT-6 (5.43 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), 2BTPTT-C8-5 (3.81 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), 2BTPTT-C12-1 (2.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 2BTPT-1 (1.22 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively, hence the order of the slowest electron mobility is BTPTT-4F > BTPTT-4F-C8 > BTPT-4F > BTPTT-4F-C12.

Furthermore, considering the nuclear tunneling effect, the kM–L–J and μe,M–L–J values obtained with the M–L–J formula are shown in Table 4 and the ESI,† Table S11. According to the formula , the Huang−Rhys factor Seff values of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, BTPTT-4F-C12, and BTPT-4F are 0.705, 0.695, 0.695, and 0.995 respectively. For BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 dimers, kM–L–J is about 3 times larger than k while kM–L–J of BTPT-4F is about 4 times larger than k, indicating that the coupling between electron and nuclear vibration cannot be ignored. It seems that shortening the length of the skeleton can enhance the coupling between electron and nuclear vibration more. Note that the trend of the calculated results with the M–L–J formula is consistent with that obtained with semi-classical Marcus theory. The configurations with the highest electron mobility (μe,M–L–J) are still 2BTPTT-3 (23.54 cm2 V−1 s−1), 2BTPTT-C8-3 (32.77 cm2 V−1 s−1), 2BTPTT-C12-3 (20.30 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 2BTPT-4 (9.11 cm2 V−1 s−1).
As shown in Table 5, we also calculate the averaged values of charge transfer distance (rAve), electron coupling (VAve), and reorganization energy (λAve) of the seven configurations of each NFA, and then bring them into eqn (5)–(8) to calculate the overall electron transfer rate constants (kAve/kAve,M–L–J) and electron mobility (μeAve/μeAve,M–L–J) respectively. The order of the μeAve/μeAve,M–L–J values is as follows: BTPTT-4F-C12 (1.07/3.32 cm2 V−1 s−1) > BTPTT-4F-C8 (0.84/2.53 cm2 V−1 s−1)> BTPTT-4F (0.67/2.14 cm2 V−1 s−1) > BTPT-4F (0.17/0.76 cm2 V−1 s−1). The result further demonstrates that the impact of changes of fused-ring skeleton length on electron mobility is exceedingly remarkable because BTPT-4F has much lower μeAve/μeAve,M–L–J than any other NFA. In addition, both removing the terminal side alkyl chains and increasing the central side alkyl chains seem to be favorable for electron mobility too.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the influence of individual changes of molecular structures i.e. fused-ring skeleton or terminal/central side alkyl chains of Y6 on molecular arrangements and planarity, and electron mobility. Changing the length of the fused-ring skeleton, removing terminal side alkyl chains, and increasing central side alkyl chains all have noticeable influences on molecular planarity, and intermolecular interactions and distances, bringing about noticeable differences in electronic coupling. The order of the averaged electron mobility obtained with semi-classical Marcus theory or the M–L–J formula of the four NFAs is BTPTT-4F-C12 > BTPTT-4F-C8 > BTPTT-4F > BTPT-4F. (For BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F, the order is consistent with the experiment.) The results demonstrate that the change of conjugated skeleton length has more significant effects on electron mobility with respect to the changes of side alkyl chains. Compared to BTPT-4F, the longer conjugated skeleton of BTPTT-4F, BTPTT-4F-C8, and BTPTT-4F-C12 leads to longer intermolecular charge transfer distance, a decrease of reorganization energy, and an increase of electron coupling. Hence the highest and averaged electron mobility of these three NFAs is much faster than that of BTPT-4F. Furthermore, removing/increasing terminal/central side alkyl chains seems to further improve electron mobility, respectively. Overall, both BTPTT-4F-C12 and BTPTT-4F-C8 are superior to the prototype Y6 in dipole moment, absorption spectrum, charge separation, and the averaged electron mobility. In addition, the data demonstrate that high electron coupling and electron mobility mainly depend on the formation of close face-on stacking of end-groups and partial flat backbone overlap between these molecules. Our work reveals the important influence of the fused-ring skeleton and side alkyl chains on molecular arrangements and electron mobility, which will be helpful for molecular design and effective regulation of film morphology, thereby providing a guideline for future molecular modification of Y6-based NFAs.
