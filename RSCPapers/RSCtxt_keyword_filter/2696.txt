    , Accepted 7th December 2013First published on 11th December 2013AbstractIn this work, a self-sacrificial template directed hydrothermal route to synthesize Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) 3D-hierarchical microspheres in the presence of citric acid is reported. The phase purity and morphology of the as-synthesized product were optimised. Citric acid plays a key role in reducing the chance of phase segregation and at the same time it helps in the formation of the 3D structure by affecting the crystal growth process. A time dependent growth study of the microspheres has been performed and a possible growth mechanism is proposed. UV-Vis absorption analysis shows that the material has a strong absorption in the visible range with a direct band gap of 1.45 eV. The photoelectric response of the sample has also been studied which shows significant photo current for the sample fabricated into thin films. Thus the as synthesized CZTS microspheres are an optimum candidate for use as an absorber layer in solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
The world has been going through a great energy crisis in recent times and the enormous demands from society will drive us to search for unconventional and environmentally friendly renewable energy sources in the near future.1–3 In this respect, the inexhaustible source of solar energy is the most promising alternative to bridge the ever increasing gap between the demand and supply of the energy needs for daily human life.4 To harness this energy the use of photovoltaic (PV) devices has recently been geared up.5,6 However solar cell technologies are still developing and require further research for better efficiency and performance of devices. In the last few decades, ‘Progress in Photovoltaics’ has published lots of such reports which demonstrate the current state-of-the-art of PV cell research.7 The selection of an appropriate absorber material which can absorb most of the solar radiation has become the key issue in solar cell technologies. Chalcogenide semiconductors such as CuInSe2(CIS), CuInGa(S/Se)2(CIGS) and CdTe are in the forefront as an absorber material in this respect.6–8 However, the high cost of resources, lower abundance of metals like indium (In) and tellurium (Te) and/or toxicity issues for cadmium (Cd) limit their application. To solve this problem the new I2–II–IV–VI4 chalcogenide material Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has received considerable attention as a next generation thin film solar cell, because it is composed of earth abundant, non-toxic metals and has a high absorption coefficient ~104 cm−1 and optimum band gap ~1.5 eV.9–14
Crystallographically, CZTS is derived from the chalcopyrite structure CuInS2, by replacing the In atom with Sn and Zn. Based on symmetry arguments, this operation produces two lower symmetry structures, known as the kesterite-type and stannite-type. Both the structures can be viewed as a 1 × 1 × 2 tetragonal expansion of zinc-blend only differing in the occupation of the Cu and Zn atoms in the sublattices. However, from ab initio calculations it has been found that the kesterite structure has a total energy −1.3 meV per atom lower than its corresponding stannite counterpart.15 The ideal stoichiometry of CZTS corresponds to Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 1 and Zn/Sn = 1, though, this only exists within a small compositional range in the ZnS–Cu2S–SnS2 ternary phase diagram.16,17 However, the literature suggests that almost all CZTS based solar cell applications require a CZTS stoichiometry which is slightly Cu-poor and Zn-rich along the line between the kesterite phase and ZnS phase in the ternary phase diagram.18 We also require an inherently safer synthesis procedure for the making of highly crystalline and pure kesterite CZTS which has better control over the cation stoichiometry and is easy to scale up. Previous reports describe various routes for CZTS synthesis such as spray pyrolysis,19 sol–gel,20 sputtering21 and electrolytic deposition.22 However these methods involve expensive electrolytic setups or complex vacuum technologies and additional requirements such as annealing temperatures and controlled atmospheres. On the other hand the solvothermal/hydrothermal method is very efficient for nanoparticle synthesis as it is cost effective and gives high yields and crystalline nanocrystals.23–25 Moreover, spin casting or printing technology enable the roll to roll processing of nanoparticle ink for large scale production of films.26 One major advantage of the hydrothermal method over these synthesis routes is the controlled stoichiometry and chemical homogeneity of the final product. To date, some solvothermal based syntheses of CZTS have been reported in the literature27–31 but a facile hydrothermal based approach has been sporadically investigated.26,32 Nonetheless, the previous hydrothermal based studies seriously lack any morphological evolution of the resulting material.
Three dimensional (3D) flower-like hierarchical morphologies are very promising for the fabrication of thin film solar cells as they enhance the power conversion efficiency owing to the enhanced surface area and multiple sunlight scattering modes. Herein we report a novel hydrothermal route for the synthesis of kesterite type CZTS microspheres using citric acid as the structure directing agent.33 Citric acid plays an important role in the formation of the phase pure CZTS. The as prepared samples were thoroughly analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The growth of the CZTS microspheres was mechanistically discussed. The phase pure sample was then characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The current voltage characteristics of the CZTS films were measured in the dark and in the presence of light which shows that the material has photo response properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 99%), zinc(II) chloride (ZnCl2, 95%), citric acid (C6H8O7, 99%) and thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%) were purchased from Merck and tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O, 98%) was obtained from Loba Chemie.
2.2. Synthesis procedure
In the synthesis procedure of the CZTS microspheres the precursor chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis 4 mmol of copper(II) chloride dihydrate, 2 mmol of zinc(II) chloride and 2 mmol of tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate were dissolved in 80 ml of deionised water and stirred for 15 min. Then 12 mmol of thiourea was added and stirred for another 30 min. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 ml Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at a temperature of 190 °C in a hot air oven for 24 h. The autoclave was then cooled naturally to room temperature and the collected black sample was washed with ethanol and de-ionised water alternately several times to remove the byproducts. The final product was then vacuum dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The dried powder sample was then used for characterization.
The synthesis process was repeated by adding various amounts of citric acid (1 mmol, 2 mmol, 4 mmol, 8 mmol, 16 mmol) into the solution of metal salts prior to the addition of thiourea, keeping the temperature, time and concentration of the other precursors constant. Also the experiment was repeated for various times (0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h etc.) for the sample containing 16 mmol of citric acid.
2.3. Characterization
Proper phase information of the synthesized samples was inferred from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku III Dmax) analysis in the 2θ range from 20° to 80° using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). For the Rietveld refinement of the phase pure CZTS sample, PXRD was taken with 4 s of stepping time and the data was analysed by MAUD 2.14.34 This program was prepared especially for the simultaneous refinement of both structural and micro-structural parameters through a least square method.34 The morphology of the as prepared samples was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The stoichiometric analysis of elements was characterized with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The micro/nanostructure of the phase pure CZTS sample was further studied by High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM 2100) operated at 200 kV. Room temperature Raman spectra were recorded using a Witec Raman instrument with a laser source of λ = 532 nm. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, SPECS HSA-3500 hemispherical analyser) analysis was performed using a monochromatic X-ray source of Al Kα radiation to investigate the elemental states of the phase pure CZTS sample. Finally, the optical properties of the material were studied by UV-Vis (Shimadzu UV-3101 PC) absorbance spectroscopy in the wavelength range 400 to 1100 nm at room temperature. The absorbance spectrum was measured by ultrasonically dispersing the powder sample in ethanol. The direct band-gap of the sample was calculated using the standard procedure. Current–voltage characteristics of the as-prepared CZTS films were observed using a standard I–V measurement set up. The I–V measurements were done in-plane of the drop casted films. Two silver metal contacts were deposited over the films at a distance of 10 mm from each other which acted as the Ohmic contact.35 White light from a tungsten lamp (Philips) with a measured light intensity of 9.45 mW cm−2 was used as the light source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase analysis by XRD
Phase identification of all the synthesized samples was done by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized under hydrothermal conditions with varying citric acid concentrations. From the analysis we found that when the citric acid concentration was less than or equal to the total metal ion concentration (≤8 mmol), impurity peaks of CuS (JCPDS file no. 060464) and SnS2 (JCPDS file no. 401467) were observed along with the required CZTS phase (JCPDS file no. 260575). However, if the citric acid concentration was increased (double with respect to the total metal ion concentration; 16 mmol), a phase pure, crystalline CZTS was formed after 24 h of hydrothermal treatment. Fig. 1(b) shows the time dependent evolution of the CZTS phase when isothermally heated at 190 °C in the presence of 16 mmol citric acid. From the XRD analysis it was revealed that, for a lower reaction time (≤12 h), an additional phase of CuS was observed but which changed into the CZTS phase after 24 h of reaction. Thus from the above analysis we conclude that citric acid indirectly controls the formation of CZTS, when isothermally heated at 190 °C for 24 h. Rietveld refinement analysis of the pure CZTS sample was carried out in order to evaluate the isotropic size, average micro strain and lattice parameters of the sample. The refinement parameters are background polynomial coefficients and scale factor, basic phase parameter, microstructure (isotropic size-strain), crystal structure (lattice parameter and atomic position of the anion), profile half-width parameters (u, v, w) and texture. The occupancy factor of the different metal ions were not refined in this study. In the MAUD program the theoretical profile, adjusted to the measured diffraction pattern, was selected from the Crystallography Open Database (CIF no. 9004750).36 The Crystallographic Information File (CIF) generated in the present study for the CZTS microsphere sample is displayed in the ESI,† Section S1. The observed and simulated diffraction patterns (shown in Fig. 1(c)) correspond well (reliable values of Rw, Rb, Rexp) with those for the ‘kesterite’ type crystal structure with a tetragonal unit cell of a = b = 5.428 Å and c = 10.762 Å. The results obtained from the Rietveld refinement analysis are given in Table 1. A typical representation of the kesterite unit cell (space group I2m(121)) of the sample under investigation was developed by the ‘Diamond Crystal and Molecular Structure Visualization program’37,38 (Version 3.2f for Windows)39 and is shown in Fig. 1(d). The metal–sulphide bond distances in the two different types of metal layers were calculated and are listed in Table 1.

To investigate the mechanism of the formation of the CZTS and CuS phases, we characterized the white intermediate product that appeared just after the addition of thiourea (Tu) to the metal salts solution, since the in situ generated seeds are often crucial to the formation of nanostructures.
3.2. Characterization of the intermediate
The XRD pattern of the white product as shown in Fig. 2(a) (at the bottom) matches well with the typical Cu(Tu)3Cl complex reported in the literature40 (JCPDS file no. 721097), where Cu is present in the +1 state. Thiourea selectively reduces Cu2+ to Cu1+ at room temperature followed by coordination of four S-atoms from the corners of a slightly distorted tetrahedron. These tetrahedra are then arranged spirally around an axis parallel to the c axis.40 Two S-atoms are bound to one Cu1+ atom with a shorter Cu–S distance while the remaining two S-atoms are shared by 2 Cu1+ atoms of neighbouring tetrahedral corners with longer Cu–S distances. This effectively creates an infinite chain of [Cu(Tu)3]+ cations and thus the structure is ionic.40Fig. 2(b) shows the FESEM analysis of the intermediate product which signifies that the powder is actually made of nanorods of the Cu(Tu)3Cl complex. Nanorods are typically 100–200 nm in diameter and several micro meters in length and appeared in bunches owing to a high surface energy. These nanorods provide the self-sacrificial template for the growth of the CZTS microstructures. EDX analysis of the precursor compound is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b) which clearly depicts the presence of Cu, S, C, N and Cl. Additional characterization of the precursor molecule was done by FTIR. Comparison with respect to pure thiourea, as shown in Fig. 2(c), indicated that the CS bond is red shifted from 730 cm−1 in pure thiourea to 696 cm−1 in the complex, while the C–N bond is blue shifted from 1472 cm−1 in pure thiourea to 1514 cm−1in the complex. Nonetheless, the N–H stretching modes of vibration (3400–3100 cm−1) were found to be slightly blue shifted upon coordination. This strongly suggests that coordination has occurred from the S atom to the central Cu1+ ion.41 During the initial period of reaction (1 h), the Cu(Tu)3Cl complex starts to dissociate which drastically reduces the crystallinity of the starting material (cf. middle of Fig. 2(a)). Though the molar ratio of Cu2+ to thiourea was observed to be 1:3, a small fraction of Cu2+ ions still remain free in solution, which at elevated temperatures under hydrothermal conditions react with S2− ions to give CuS.

3.3. Detailed analysis of the microspheres

Morphology and elemental analysis. 
The field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis (FESEM) of the 24 h sample indicates the distribution of hierarchical CZTS solid spheres with diameters of 4–8 μm over a large area (cf.Fig. 3(a)). Recently Lee et al. also obtained CZTS microspheres with diameters of ∼2 μm built from nanoflakes which were synthesized via a facile solvothermal approach.29 Closer inspection of a typical microsphere (cf.Fig. 3(b)) revealed that the microspheres are compact in nature and are made of CZTS particles and sheets which are precipitated during the hydrothermal treatment. The sheets are typically ~50 nm in thickness and are connected to each other like petals in a flower (cf.Fig. 3(a)). Particles of CZTS were found to be deposited over the nanosheets resulting in dense spheres. Elemental analysis of a typical CZTS microsphere sample was performed by EDS and the results are shown in Fig. 3(d). The atomic ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S was found to be 2.05:1.28:0.84:4 (error ±2 atom%) which is close to the stoichiometric value of 2:1:1:4.28 The morphology of the CZTS microspheres was also investigated by TEM and HRTEM analysis. A typical microsphere of diameter more than 5 μm and a piece of nanosheet were observed and are shown in Fig. 4(a) & (b), respectively. The HRTEM image taken of the nanosheet shows well resolved lattice fringes corresponding to the crystallographic plane (112) (cf.Fig. 4(c)). From FFT analysis (cf.Fig. 4(d)) it was found that the nanosheets are actually made of a single crystal. However, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (shown in Fig. 4(e)) clearly indicates the poly crystalline nature of the sample. This combined result indicates that the (112) plane was the preferred growth plane for the polycrystalline CZTS microspheres.28

Raman and XPS analysis of the microspheres. 
A room temperature Raman spectrum of the as synthesized CZTS microspheres was obtained using laser excitation of 532 nm and is shown in Fig. 5(a). For CZTS, a strong peak at 336 cm−1 and two weaker peaks at 285 and 362 cm−1 have been reported in the literature which can be classified according to group analysis.42 In our sample one intense peak appears at 334.9 cm−1 which is accompanied by two shoulders that can be deconvoluted into two weaker peaks at 291.6 and 367.6 cm−1. Different deconvolution parameters are listed in the inset of the Raman spectrum. The Raman peaks for Cu, Zn, Sn binary and ternary metal chalcogenides, as reported in the literature, are listed in Table 2. As mentioned in the table, no other peaks for any impurity phases were detected which again confirms the phase purity of the as synthesized sample. Nevertheless, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value for the most intense peak is a good indicator of the size and crystallinity of the material under study. In our case the FWHM for the 334.9 cm−1 peak was calculated to be 25 cm−1 which is the narrowest of the three peaks. Such narrow widths are associated with nanoparticles where the phonon confinement effect does not contribute to the line width broadening and indicate good crystallinity of the sample.43 This observation corresponds well with that of the XRD analysis discussed previously. Again the line width of the Raman peaks is strongly governed by the timescale of the de-excitation process that can be derived from the energy time uncertainty relation ; where, τ is the mean phonon life time (τ = t1/2ln 2), ΔE is the uncertainty in the phonon energy state, ħ is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s), c is the velocity of light (2.998 × 1010 cm s−1) and Γ is the FWHM of the most intense Raman peak in cm−1. Based on this equation the average phonon lifetime (τ) of the CZTS microsphere sample was calculated to be 0.214 × 10−12 s.

Information regarding the oxidation states of the different elements present in the CZTS sample was recorded by high resolution XPS analysis and the observations are shown in Fig. 5(b). The spectrum was charge corrected considering the binding energy of C 1s at 284.3 eV as reference using the CASA XPS software program. In the Cu 2p spectrum, two narrow and symmetric peaks appear at 932 and 951.8 eV with a splitting of 19.8 eV which indicates the presence of Cu1+. For zinc, the 2p peaks appeared at 1021.8 and 1044.8 eV and a peak separation of 23 eV is consistent with the standard splitting of 22.97 eV, suggesting Zn2+. Two Sn 3d peaks found at 487.5 and 495.9 eV and a peak splitting of 8.4 eV indicate the existence of Sn4+. Two peaks for sulphur 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in the spectra emerge at 161.7 and 162.8 eV and are consistent with the 160–164 eV range expected for sulphur in sulphide phases. These results are consistent with the literature.44 Thus with the combined XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS and TEM analysis; we can confirm that the CZTS microspheres are crystalline, phase pure and stoichiometric.


Influence of citric acid concentration. 
The effect of citric acid concentration on the phase of the resultant product has already been established by XRD analysis. Phase pure CZTS was formed only when the citric acid to total metal ion ratio was greater than one. FESEM analysis of the CZTS samples prepared with different citric acid to metal ion ratios is shown in Fig. 6. The absence of any citric acid or the presence of a small amount of citric acid (one eighth of total metal ion concentration) does not affect the morphology significantly (cf.Fig. 6(a) & (b)). Thus irregular shapes and sizes were observed in the FESEM analysis. However, with an increase in citric acid concentration to one quarter or half of the total metal ion concentration, the morphology of the CZTS particles changes into flower like spherical superstructures with diameters of more than 5 μm (cf.Fig. 6(c) & (d)). The spheres are mainly composed of several interconnected nanosheets stacked together on the surface of the microspheres. When the citric acid concentration was increased further the size of the microspheres was found to remain unchanged while morphology altered slightly. When the citric acid to total metal ion ratio was 1:1 or 2:1, additional deposition of the particles occurred on the surface of the nanosheets (cf.Fig. 6(e) & (f)).

Influence of the reaction time. 
The phase analysis of the products synthesized by varying the reaction time was previously done by XRD which suggested that phase pure CZTS was only formed after 24 h of isothermal treatment. However, the morphology of the synthesized samples was analysed by FESEM and the observations are shown in Fig. 7. From the figure it is clear that during the initial period of the reaction (up to 1 h) the nanorods ruptured into small fragments and/or assembled together into micro-rods (cf.Fig. 7(a) & (b)). After 3 h, microspheres were formed. As the citric acid concentration was maintained at double the total metal ion concentration in each case, dense microspheres were formed with diameters of ~5 μm after 3 h (cf.Fig. 7(c)). Nanosheets that formed at the surface have thicknesses of ~30 nm. Deposition of the CZTS particles on the surface of the nanosheets was also observed. However, the extent of the deposition is small owing to kinetic effects. When increasing the reaction time to 6 h, the size of the microspheres increased. With a further increase in reaction time to 12 h, the size did not change considerably but the surface morphology changed significantly (cf.Fig. 7(d) & (e)). Huge deposition of the particles on the nanosheets was observed and the nanosheets became thicker. After 24 h, the deposition continued which resulted in more dense microspheres of phase pure CZTS (cf.Fig. 7(f)).

Growth mechanism. 
On the basis of the above results, we proposed a possible growth mechanism of the CZTS microspheres which is illustrated in Fig. 8. Under hydrothermal conditions, the Cu(Tu)3Cl complex first hydrolyses to form Cu2+ and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The H2S then again reduces Cu2+ to Cu1+ under the hydrothermal conditions.28 At the initial period of the growth process, this leads to rupture of the nanorods into small fragments which then aggregate to form thick micro-rods or spherical clusters to reduce their surface energies, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b).41 During this time the crystallinity of the starting complex drastically reduces. This can be observed in the XRD pattern of the sample collected after 1 h of hydrothermal reaction as shown in Fig. 2(a). During the next 2 h of reaction, other ions like Zn2+, Sn4+ and S2− preferentially orient themselves on the surface of the template fragments to form CZTS nuclei, which is evident from the XRD pattern of the sample shown at the top of Fig. 2(a). The tetragonal crystal habit of the template material may provide the preferred growth direction of the CZTS phase. Thus, after 3 h, the CZTS microstructures have formed in the solution with various shapes as directed by the template fragments (cf.Fig. 7(c)). Citric acid plays an important role in assembling the structural components into a sphere. After 3 h of reaction the solid microspheres of diameter ~5 μm are obtained with some additional broken or detached microstructures. The surface of the microspheres is mostly made of nanosheets of thickness 50–100 nm along with some other microstructures (cf.Fig. 7(c)). Recently, Xie et al. reported the epitaxial growth of CuInSe2 ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of CuSe nanosheets via a cation exchange process.45 In the present case, ultrathin and relatively clean nanosheets are obtained when the citric acid concentration is low. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the thick micro rods of the starting material can act as an effective template to manipulate the thickness of the nanosheets. The anisotropic crystal habit of the starting complex exacerbates the discrepancy in the internal and external reaction rates which can create enough strain and distortion inside the microstructures to eventually cause detachment of the ultrathin nanosheets (thickness varies from 10–20 nm) of CZTS under the hydrothermal conditions.45 Finally all the building subunits arrange together in the presence of citric acid to form the dense microspheres of CZTS. As stated earlier, the presence of free Cu2+ in the solution results in the formation of the CuS impurity phase (cf.Fig. 1(a)). At high citric acid concentrations and after 24 h of reaction, phase pure CZTS is obtained. Ostwald ripening plays a leading role at this stage. Raman and XPS analyses of the 24 h sample also support the phase purity as discussed in the previous sections (cf.Fig. 5(a) and (b)). Ostwald ripening is a process by which smaller particles are dissolved into the bulk solution and recrystallize into bigger ones due to thermodynamic reasons.46 It is known that the solubility of binary metal sulphides increases with increasing acidity of the solution. In the present case, when the citric acid concentration is low, the acidity of the solution is not sufficient enough for Ostwald ripening to occur within 24 h. However, with a higher citric acid concentration, the impurity phase (CuS) is dissolved and phase pure CZTS is obtained within 24 h of hydrothermal reaction. This is clearly evident in the XRD pattern of the samples as shown in the Fig. 1(a).

3.4. UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis
The absorption profile of the microsphere sample was investigated in the UV-Visible region of the spectrum and the observation was shown in the Fig. 9. From the figure it is clear that the sample absorbs radiation spanning the whole range of the visible spectrum. This accounts for the black colour of the powder sample. For a direct band gap material the absorption coefficient satisfy the relation (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), where, α, ν, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy and a constant respectively. The direct band gap Eg calculated by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve of (αhν)2vs. (hν) (shown in the inset of Fig. 9) gives a value of Eg = 1.45 eV which is in good agreement with the reported value in literature.47,48 This value for a direct band gap material is ideal for application as absorber layer of solar energy devices.

4. Photo response
The photo response property was investigated of the CZTS films that were successfully fabricated (by dripping the concentrated CZTS powder sample dispersion) on cleaned sodium lime glass substrates using isopropanol as the solvent. I–V measurements of the films were done in dark and under illumination of visible light. A schematic of the I–V measurement setup is shown in the inset of Fig. 10(a). We see a linear nature of the I–V curves which shows that the metal contacts are Ohmic in nature as reported by other researchers.35 As depicted in the Fig. 10, it was observed that the photo response property was improved when the citric acid concentration increases. We can see from the XRD analysis (cf.Fig. 1(a)) that phase purity of CZTS increases as we increase the citric acid concentration. So the phase purity has a direct correlation with the photo response. We notice that both the phase purity and change in morphology from irregular to microspheres (by increasing citric acid concentration) makes the photo response better (cf. 6 and 10).

Here the visible light photons produce excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, thus the generation of majority carriers in presence of light enhances the film conductivity.49,50 This property may be utilised for the generation of photocurrent and potential application of CZTS in solar energy conversion devices.
5. Conclusion
In summary, a facile hydrothermal route for the synthesis of CZTS microspheres in the presence of citric acid has been reported. The in situ generated Cu(Tu)3Cl complex nanorods provide an effective self-sacrificial template for the nucleation and growth of the CZTS micro/nano structures. On the other hand, citric acid plays a key role in the formation of the rigid microspheres. An excess amount of citric acid is found to be vital for the formation of the phase pure CZTS. The as prepared sample has strong absorption in the visible spectrum, having a band gap of 1.45 eV. The samples fabricated into thin films show photo response property. The ideal band gap and superior photo response property of the as synthesized CZTS sample makes it an effective material for use in photovoltaic applications.
