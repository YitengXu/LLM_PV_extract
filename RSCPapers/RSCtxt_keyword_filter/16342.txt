1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, a type of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, have attracted considerable attention due to some advantages, such as low cost, light weight, solution processability, fabrication on flexible substrates and large area fabrication, as well as potential for roll-to-roll production.1 Nowadays, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been achieved for BHJ OPV cells based on blends of narrow bandgap polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.2 The exploration of novel electron acceptor molecules is less developed than the search for new electron donor materials. Fullerenes and their derivatives, especially PC61BM and PC71BM, have been the dominant electron acceptors in BHJ OPVs3 because of their high electron affinity and electron mobility, isotropy of charge transport, and good ability to form favorable nanoscale networks with donor materials. However, the performances will reach a limit due to the intrinsic drawbacks and limitations of fullerenes, e.g. poor photostability in air, poor solar energy harvesting, difficulty in synthesis and purification, high production cost (especially for PC71BM)4 and the difficulty in tuning the optical properties and electronic structures of fullerenes over a wide range of energy.5 As a consequence, there is growing interest in the synthesis of non-fullerene electron acceptors for OPVs,6 which possess a strong absorption ability in the visible and NIR regions in a complementary zone to that of the electron donor, adjustable energy levels, tunable electronic properties, effective charge separation and transportation, and good match capability with donor materials.
1.1. Perylenediimides
Among all the families of electron-accepting molecules, perylenediimides (PDIs)7 are in a prominent position due to the large number of outstanding properties they display. In particular, they possess high thermal, chemical and photochemical stabilities, the latter being an important requisite for a component in an OPV cell. PDIs absorb light intensely in the visible region. They have a strong electron-acceptor character, comparable in some cases to that of fullerene derivatives, showing high electron mobility also. Moreover, the easy functionalization of the aromatic core and imide positions allows the rational fine tuning of their solubility and HOMO–LUMO levels, as well as of the optoelectronic and self-assembling properties.8 Finally, they are economical starting materials.
PDIs, indeed, have been used as acceptors in OPV cells, reaching three years ago PCEs of 3% (Fig. 1).9

However, despite these favorable properties, the evolution of the performance of PDI derivatives has not been very promising until recently. The main drawback of these molecules is the strong tendency for π–π stacking due to its planar nature, which leads to a poor solubility in most solvents and to the formation of large aggregates (typically micrometer scale) which are deleterious for the efficiency of OPVs as these aggregates allow strong self-trapping of excitons, severely limiting the exciton diffusion/separation process, which may be related to the cell's relatively low fill factor (FF) and reduced short-circuit current density (Jsc). To solve this problem, various alkyl chains were introduced on the bay positions (positions 1, 6, 7 and 12, Fig. 1) of the PDI, although performances of the corresponding OPV cells did not improve much.
At this stage, some groups initialized molecular engineering aiming at weakening the strong aggregation of PDI derivatives to avoid large crystalline aggregate domains without compromising their charge transport properties. Thus, very recently, the introduction of the “twisted” concept in the PDI system to diminish the aggregation has been investigated and twisted PDI compounds have been designed, mainly by means of PDI dimers linked at the imide positions or bay positions either by direct attachment or through small rings.10 Very promising results have been achieved with these PDI-based systems, reaching PCEs higher than 8%.
In this review, we will look over the last advances in the design of perylenediimides as electron acceptors for OPVs, together with some new developments in the film processing of PDI-based cells.
2. Twisted PDI dimers
The three-dimensional molecular structure is a crucial factor affecting many molecular and bulk properties of the PDIs such as the electron delocalization and the electronic structures, the intra- and intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, the abovementioned π–π stacking, etc.), the molecular packing in the solid (and the crystalline or amorphous nature of the latter), the solubility and processability, and the charge transport properties. Therefore, some groups have directed their research to the modification of the 3D structure of PDIs.4
2.1. Dimerization through rings in the bay positions
One of the pioneering studies in the area compared the performances of six PDI dimers, named as PDI 1–6, bearing different arylene linkers, namely p-phenylene, m-phenylene, thiophene-2,5-diyl, 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl, spirobifluorene-2,2′-diyl and spirobifluorene-2,7-diyl (Fig. 2). It was expected that the linker groups should assume non-coplanar orientations with respect to the PDI units. In accordance with this presumption, the LUMOs of all dimers were maintained at a similar level to that of a PDI monomer, reassuring for adequate open-circuit voltages (Voc) of solar cells. When mixed with P3HT (1–1 w/w) and introduced into a cell with an inverted configuration (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:acceptor/MoO3/Ag), these PDIs yielded PCEs ranging from 0.90 to 2.35. PDI-6, with the spirobifluorene-2,7-diyl linker, showed the best result, with a Voc of 0.61 V, Jsc of 5.92 mA cm−2, FF of 0.65 and PCE of 2.35%. PDI-5, with the spirobifluorene-2,2′-diyl moiety, displayed a somewhat higher Jsc, but a worse FF and PCE than PDI-6.11

Later studies on PDI-6 (named in the paper as SF-PDI2) were conducted to find a better matching donor polymer. The best partner found was PffBT4T-2DT (Fig. 2), taking advantage of the difluorination of the benzothiadiazole unit, which not only increases the crystallinity and hole transport ability of the polymer, but also lowers the HOMO level of the polymer, and thus increases the Voc of the OPV cell. Introducing the donor and acceptor materials in an inverted structure BHJ OPV (ITO/ZnO/PffBT4T-2DT:PDI-6/V2O5/Al) with an impressive efficiency of 6.3 was obtained (Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.57). This high performance was achieved without using any additives or interlayers, which would simplify the processing and optimizations of OPV cells. The high Voc was attributed to the high-lying LUMO level of PDI-6 (because of the spirobifluorene bridge) compared to the HOMO level of PffBT4T-2DT. Another factor for this PCE is the reduced intermolecular aggregation (also caused by the bulky spirobifluorene bridge), which allows PDI-6 to form films without any excessive crystallization, but keeping a reasonably good electron transport ability.12
Another pioneering work in this line was brought about with bis-PDI-T-EG (Fig. 3), a thiophene-linked PDI dimer (actually, a mixture of the three possible regioisomers). Molecular modeling indicated that the PDI dimer had a highly twisted dimeric backbone, with dihedral angles between the PDI-thienyl-PDI planes of 50–65°, thus inducing a significant reduction in aggregation compared with the reference monomer PDI-1. Compared to that of PDI-1, the LUMO of bis-PDI-T-EG was slightly depressed, by −0.10 eV, while its HOMO was considerably raised, by +0.33 eV, yielding a narrower bandgap. In order to prepare OPVs, the conjugated polymer PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. 3) was selected as the donor material because it complemented the absorption spectrum of the PDI dimer, while the generally used P3HT (Fig. 2) overlapped with the absorption band of the PDIs. By using the conventional architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/bis-PDI-T-EG:PBDTTT-C-T/Ca/Al, the 1:1 blend of donor:acceptor material gave, after using 5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a cosolvent, a PCE of 4.03%, with a Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 8.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.541. On the other hand, PDI-1, under the same conditions, yielded devices with a very low PCE of 0.13%. Using AFM, it was demonstrated that the use of 5% DIO produced a more favorable phase separation in the blend. The electron and hole mobilities in the BHJ blended films were μe = 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.13

This previous efficiency was further improved combining the donor polymer PBDTTT-C-T with a slightly modified PDI dimer: bis-PDI-T-MO (Fig. 3). Through a combined control of surface D/A compositions, phase separation, and phase size by screening the DIO concentration, the electric performance of a cell device in an inverted structure ITO/ZnO/D:A/MoOx/Ag was fine-tuned and the best efficiency of 4.34% (with Voc of 0.78 V, Jsc of 10.17 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.548) was obtained, using 2% DIO as a cosolvent.14
In a step forward, a series of oligothiophene-bridged perylenediimide dimers (PnTP, n = 0–3) was synthesized (Fig. 4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that these molecules have a twisted structure due to steric hindrance. P0TP exhibited a dihedral angle of 62.7°, while P(1–3)TP showed smaller dihedral angles of 50.7–52.3°.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of PnTP (n = 0–3). 
When PnTPs were blended with PBDTTT-C-T, the films showed hole mobilities from 10−6 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities from 10−6 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Because P0TP exhibited the largest dihedral angle and steric hindrance among the four PDI dimers, which led to poor π–π stacking, the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend showed the lowest electron mobility. On the other hand, oligothiophene-bridged PDI dimers possessed smaller dihedral angles and, consequently, PBDTTT-C-T:P(1–3)TP blend films exhibited higher electron mobilities.
Best performing OPVs [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Ca/Al] were obtained by blending in a 1:1 ratio PBDTTT-C-T as the donor and P(0–3)TP as acceptors. Compared to P0TP (PCE: 0.76%), PDI dimers with the oligothiophene bridge gave better performance due to broader absorption and higher electron mobilities. The devices based on PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP with 3% DIO gave the best efficiency among these molecules: Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 7.78 mA cm−2, FF of 0.521 and PCE of 3.61%, due to the highest hole and electron mobilities of all the molecules. Increasing the number of thiophene units led to lower performances, which was attributed to lower hole and electron mobilities.
An AFM study of the film morphologies showed large aggregation domains (around 100 nm) and large phase separation in the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend film, suggesting poor miscibility between the donor and acceptor. PBDTTT-C-T:P2TP and PBDTTT-C-T:P3TP blend films had smooth morphology and small aggregation domains (around 10 nm), indicating good donor–acceptor miscibility, which was beneficial to exciton diffusion/separation but not favorable for charge transport and finally led to low mobilities and low PCEs. In the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film, suitable aggregation domains (tens of nanometers) and phase separation facilitated both exciton diffusion/separation and charge transport; thus, the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film exhibited the highest hole and electron mobilities and the best device performance.15
The flexible or semiflexible geometries of the previous PDI dimers decrease the effective conjugation and raise the rotational disorder and the reorganization energy, negatively affecting the charge mobility and morphology in the OPV. On the other hand, a nonplanar geometry is required to ensure the formation of a bicontinuous network with donor materials. The combination of these two statements leads to an ideal PDI acceptor possessing enhanced conjugation and molecular packing order to assure charge mobility but keeping a nonplanar structure to avoid the formation of large aggregates. Following these thoughts, FPDI-F, FPDI-T and FPDI-Se were synthesized (Fig. 5). All three compounds have similar energy levels, but different molecular geometries due to the different sizes of the chalcogen atom. Compared to the non-fused systems, these compounds have higher lying LUMOs (which is beneficial for a larger Voc). OPVs were prepared in an inverted architecture ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:FPDI/MoO3/Ag, where the optimal blending ratio of donor polymer:FPDI was found to be 1:2. The best performance was obtained with FPDI-T (PCE = 5.76%, Voc = 0.94 V, Jsc = 11.80 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.52), which was increased by using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive to modulate the morphology (PCE = 6.72%, Voc = 0.94 V, Jsc = 12.48 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.58). Devices based on FPDI-Se showed slightly worse performances (PCEs of 4.65 and 5.77% in the absence and presence of CN, respectively), while those based on FPDI-F showed a modest 3.29%. The difference in PCEs in this FPDI series was attributed to the different morphologies. μe, being two orders of magnitude lower than μh, was the limiting factor of the device performance, especially for Jsc and FF.16

2.2. Dimerization by direct linkage through the imide nitrogen
In 2012, the nonplanar dimeric PDI-1 (Fig. 6) was used in a fullerene-free OPV blended with the 2D-conjugated polymer PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. 3) in an inverted device geometry of ITO/ZnO/polymer–acceptor/MoOx/Ag achieving an encouraging PCE of 2.78% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.46. This result was attributed to the twisted N–N single bond, as the PDI subunits were oriented perpendicular to each other to minimize the electronic repulsion between the oxygen atoms, which significantly weakened the aggregation effect of acceptors, reduced the formation of intermolecular states and expedited charge separation at the interface (Fig. 7).17

A more detailed study on this PDI-1:PBDTTT-C-T system (1:1 blend in the abovementioned inverted geometry) showed a maximum device efficiency of 3.2%, with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.46 and charge carrier mobilities μh = 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe/μh = 0.54).18
This study motivated the development of new strategies to produce dimeric PDIs with twisted structures. Thus, the dimer PDI-1 was optimized by replacing the C7H15 chains with C5H11 ones. This modified acceptor, named as PPDI (Fig. 6), was blended with PBDTTT-C-T in an OPV with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDI/Ca/Al architecture, yielding a PCE of 3.78% (a Voc of 0.76 ± 0.01 V, Jsc of 10.46 ± 0.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.49 ± 0.02).
Using the same device architecture but replacing the polymer donor by PBDT-TS1 (Fig. 6) in a 1:1 ratio, the OPV gave an average PCE of 5.45% along with a Voc of 0.80 ± 0.01 V, Jsc of 12.85 ± 0.23 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.53 ± 0.02. The PBDT-TS1/PPDI device showed a relatively balanced hole/electron mobility (μe = 1.2 × 10−3 and μh = 8.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Inverted OPVs with a device geometry of ITO/PFN/polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Al were also studied. The best-performing inverted devices based on PBDT-TS1/PPDI showed a PCE of 5.31% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 13.19 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51.19
2.3. Dimerization by direct linkage through the bay positions
A study was performed by comparing singly linked, doubly linked and triply linked PDI dimers. The first one (s-diPBI) has a flexibly twisted structure with an angle of about 70° between the PDI moieties, while the second one (d-diPBI) possesses a locked twisted structure with nearly perpendicular PDI systems and the third one (t-diPBI) is rigid and almost planar (Fig. 8). As expected, t-diPBI and d-diPBI showed much higher mobilities than s-diPBI. However, the best performing compound in solar cells with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:diPBI/Ca was the N,N′-bis(pentylhexyl)-substituted s-diPBI with a PCE of 3.63% (Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 10.58 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.468), which was attributed to its flexible and twisted structure that disrupts the crystallinity.20
 Fig. 8  PDI dimers linked through the bay positions. 
The photovoltaic performances of s-diPBI were further enhanced by selecting a polymer counterpart PBDTBDD (Fig. 9), due to its low-lying HOMO level and the strong aggregation effect in a solution state. After the selection of a ternary processing solvent (o-dichlorobenzene:DIO:CN), a PCE of 4.39% (Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 8.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.611) was realized in a conventional device architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBDD:s-diPBI 1:1/Ca/Al). This result was attributed to the high exciton dissociation efficiency, enhanced crystallinity as well as optimal phase separation.21
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of the acceptor s-diPBI and the donor polymers PBDTTT-C-T, PBDTBDD and PTB7-Th. 
In the next report, still using s-diPBI, PTB7-Th (named in the paper as PBDTT-F-TT, Fig. 9) was selected because of its deeper HOMO and red-shifted absorption. Also an inverted device architecture (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:s-diPBI/MoO3/Ag) was chosen because the results from optical modeling showed that it offers better optical field distribution and exciton generation. In addition, the performance of the device was improved with a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (PC61BM-SAM)-modified zinc oxide (ZnO) interlayer to enhance charge extraction. With all these modifications, a PCE of 5.90% (Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 11.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.59) was reported. The estimated electron mobility was around 3.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the hole mobility was 4.36 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The shifted exciton generation profile towards the cathode in the inverted devices compensates for the poor electron mobility in the BHJ, which reduces charge recombination.22
A further improvement in this work line came with the synthesis of SdiPBI-S (Fig. 10). Because of the rigidity increase introduced by the two fused thiophene rings, SdiPBI-S has a more twisted configuration. Thus, the dihedral angle between the two PDI subunits in s-diPBI is 67° and increases to 80° for SdiPBI-S. On the other hand, the electron-donating ability of the thiophene rings leads to a higher lying LUMO energy in comparison with s-diPBI, which is favorable for improving the Voc of solar cells. Comparison of the UV-Vis spectra of SdiPBI-S in solution and in thin film shows similar optical absorption spectra in which the main absorption peaks are maintained at the same positions, indicative of weak aggregation in the solid state.
 Fig. 10  Chemical structures of the acceptors SdiPBI-S and SdiPBI-Se and of the donor PDBT-T1. 
Conventional BHJ solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-S/Ca/Al) based on SdiPBI-S and the wide-band-gap polymer PDBT-T1 (Fig. 10), 1:1 blend ratio with 0.75% of DIO, showed a PCE of 7.16% with an Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 11.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.661.
For the sake of comparison, solar cells based on the PDBT-T1/s-diPBI blend were fabricated in parallel. Under the same conditions, a PCE of 5.40% was obtained.
The high photovoltaic performance of SdiPBI-S-based cells was explained in terms of a favorable phase separation and balanced carrier mobilities in the BHJ films. The hole mobility was calculated to be μh = 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility was μe = 2.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe/μh = 2.3).
Finally, DIO was found to increase the aggregation of the SdiPBI-S acceptor, leading to favorable phase separation and balanced carrier mobilities in the BHJ films.10
Taking into account that selenium has a bigger and more polarizable electron cloud than sulfur, which may enhance the orbital overlap and charge carrier mobility, the next step was the study of SdiPBI-Se (Fig. 10). The calculated geometry for this molecule showed a dihedral angle between the two PDI subunits of 77°, very close to that of SdiPBI-S, which ensured a weak aggregation in the solid state. OPVs with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-Se/Ca/Al with a 1:1 weight ratio of the donor and acceptor showed a PCE of 7.55% with Jsc = 11.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and FF = 0.678. The addition of 0.25% DIO led to a record PCE of 8.42% with Jsc = 12.49 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.702. Further increasing the amount of DIO lowered the PCE. The hole and the electron mobilities in the blend were found to be 3.6 10−3 and 4.8 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, pointing out to a nearly balanced charge transport (μe/μh = 1.3).23
A more elaborate approach was obtained by the covalent linking of two PDIs through an ethylene bridge. Because of its twisted molecular conformation, helical hPDI2 (named in the paper as Helical PDI 1, Fig. 11) does not aggregate strongly, while it shows a relatively high electron mobility, good electron-accepting ability and a LUMO level (∼4 eV) similar to those of PC61BM and PC71BM. OPVs were fabricated with this material and the donor polymer PTB7-Th (named in the paper as PBDTT-TT) in an inverted geometry of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:hPDI2/MoOx/Al. The best resulting PTB7-Th:hPDI2 solar cell showed Jsc = 13.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.803 V, FF = 0.566 and PCE = 6.05%. These values are lower than those of the corresponding cells with fullerenes as the acceptors, but those partners were optimized for each other. For the PTB7-Th:hPDI2 blend film, the hole and electron mobilities were calculated to be 2.9 × 10−4 and 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
 Fig. 11  Chemical structures of the acceptors hPDI2, hPDI3 and hPDI4. 
The authors showed that photogenerated excitons from hPDI2 largely contribute to the photocurrent in these solar cells and conclude that electron and hole transfers from the photoexcited donor and acceptor, respectively, both occur efficiently at the donor–acceptor interfaces in the blended film.24
An extension of this synthetic methodology was achieved with the synthesis of oligomers hPDI3 and hPDI4 (Fig. 11), the higher analogues of hPDI2, which consist of PDI subunits linked together by ethylene bridges. The steric congestion at the fusion point between the PDI units creates helical junctions, and longer oligomers form helical ribbons.
Electrochemical measurements reveal that the trimer hPDI3 and the tetramer hPDI4 can accept up to five electrons. The estimated LUMO energies for hPDI3 and hPDI4 are slightly lower than the LUMO level of PDI monomers and close to that of common n-type materials such as PC61BM.
The electron mobility increases from the dimer hPDI2 to the tetramer hPDI4, for the latter being 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. AFM studies show that compounds hPDI2–hPDI4 formed very smooth films.25
The oligomers hPDI3 and hPDI4 were used with the polymer PTB7-Th (named in the article as PBDTT-F-TT) for the preparation of inverted solar cells (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:hPDI/MoO3/Al). This polymer was selected because its absorption bands are red shifted relative to those of hPDI3 and hPDI4. For devices based on the acceptor hPDI3, best results were obtained with a donor:acceptor mass ratio of 1:1.5, using 1% DIO: PCE of 7.9% with Jsc = 14.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V and FF = 0.67. In the case of hPDI4, optimal device performance was achieved with a donor-to-acceptor mass ratio of 1:1 and 1% DIO: PCE of 8.3%, with Jsc = 15.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V and FF = 0.68. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveals that excitons generated in both the donor and acceptor phases contribute to the photocurrent by effective hole and electron transfer at the interface between the donor and acceptor. For the PTB7-Th:hPDI3 blended film, the hole and electron mobilities were calculated to be 1.0 × 10−4 and 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while for the PTB7-Th:hPDI4 blended film, the hole and electron mobilities were 1.2 10−4 and 1.5 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The authors claimed that the film morphology of the active layer was composed of an interpenetrating network of hPDI-rich domains, embedded in a PTB7-Th-rich matrix.26
2.4. The quasi-spherical approach
Given that the most successful electron acceptor in OPVs, fullerene, has a ball-like structure, which allows for isotropic charge transport, some research has been directed to the synthesis of a quasi-spherical PDI derivative, Me-PDI4 (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Chemical structure of Me-PDI4. 
The geometry of Me-PDI4, optimized using DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*), shows that the PDIs are pointing to the vertices of a tetrahedron, with a dihedral angle of 110.17° between each PDI unit and the connected phenyl group. This molecule has four degenerated LUMOs which can accept up to eight electrons.
A conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:Me-PDI4/Ca/Al was first fabricated, which after the addition of DIO and annealing showed a PCE of 2.35%. In order to further increase the device performance, an inverted device with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C-T:Me-PDI4/PEDOT:PSS/Ag was fabricated. With a 3% DIO concentration and thermal annealing, the inverted device showed a PCE of 2.73%, with Jsc = 7.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.77 V and FF = 0.45.
The as-prepared film under optimal conditions has a relatively low hole mobility of 5.55 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a lower electron mobility of 1.78 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the relatively low FF was attributed to the unbalanced electron–hole mobility (μe/μh = 0.032).27
Another step forward was achieved by the synthesis of tetra-PDI, where the PDI subunits were attached to the tetraphenylsilane core through the bay positions (Fig. 13). A DFT calculation showed that, although each PDI unit and phenyl group in tetra-PDI are covalently linked by rotatable single bonds, the four PDI units on the compact Si core have a 3D interlocked geometry, which is non-rotatable and differs from the previously reported nonplanar molecules. Tetra-PDI brings together four PDI units into a crowded space, thus enabling the energy transfer and electron communication among PDI units. Inverted devices (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:tetra-PDI/MoO3/Ag) were fabricated to investigate the performance of solution-processed BHJ OPVs and after optimizing the blend ratio of the active layer to be 1:1.2 between PTB7-Th (named in the paper as PBDTT-F-TT, Fig. 9) and tetra-PDI, the device showed a PCE of 3.21% (with Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 7.66 mA cm −2 and FF of 0.48) without applying any post-treatments or additives. While DIO was found to have a negative effect on the performance of tetra-PDI based devices, the addition of 3% CN led to an improved PCE of 3.54% (Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 8.39 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.49).28
 Fig. 13  Chemical structure of tetra-PDI. 
The same strategy as in the previous work led to the synthesis of compounds TPC-PDI4, TPSi-PDI4 and TPGe-PDI4 (Fig. 14), which have similar 3D structures except that the sizes of the core atoms (C, Si, and Ge) are different. Solar cell devices with a commonly used low bandgap donor polymer (PffBT4T-2DT, Fig. 2) were fabricated (ITO/ZnO/PffBT4T-2DT:TPX-PDI4/V2O5/Al, X = C, Si, Ge) showing PCEs of 4.3% (Voc = 0.96 V, Jsc = 9.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.49) for TPC-PDI4 and 4.2% (Voc = 0.94 V, Jsc = 8.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.53) for TPSi-PDI4 without any solvent additives or interlayers, indicating that these acceptors could be easily applied to fast and roll-to-roll industrial processing. Devices based on TPGe-PDI4 showed a PCE of 1.6% due to stronger bimolecular recombination and monomolecular recombination in the PffBT4T-2DT/TPGe-PDI4 film than in the other films.29
 Fig. 14  Chemical structures of TPX-PDI4. 
A different approach to PDI-based three-dimensional structures has been achieved with the synthesis of S(TPA-PDI) (Fig. 15), which takes advantage of the special propeller starburst molecular structure of TPA. The absorption of S(TPA-PDI) films suggests a weak intermolecular interaction and molecular aggregation in the film, because of the quasi-3D molecular structure of the molecule. The BHJ cells prepared using the low-bandgap polymer PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. 3) as an electron donor (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:S(TPA-PDI)/Ca/Al) showed an efficiency of 3.32% (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 11.92 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.336) when 5% DIO was used. The DIO solvent additive increased the film roughness and crystalline size. The crystalline domains were attributed to the self-organization of PBDTTT-C-T, which was beneficial to the ordered structure formation and charge transport in the thin film. The blend with the 5% DIO additive exhibited enhanced charge transport with a hole mobility of 7.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 2.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.30
 Fig. 15  Chemical structure of S(TPA-PDI). 
Another example of a 3D structure obtained from a highly twisted scaffold is represented by the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) core-based TPE-PDI4 (Fig. 16). The TPE structure was selected because its four phenyl rings are highly twisted due to strong steric hindrance: they all tilt by about 50° relative to the plane of the center double bond and form a “four-wing propeller-shape” molecular structure in the solid state. As a consequence, TPE-based molecules exhibit weak intermolecular interactions and thus, TPE-PDI4 shows excellent solubility in common organic solvents, and also forms ultra-smooth and amorphous films.
 Fig. 16  Chemical structures of TPE-PDI4 and BP-PDI2. 
BHJ OPV devices were fabricated using PTB7-Th (named in the article as PBDTT-F-TT, Fig. 9) as the donor and TPE-PDI4 as the acceptor. The authors claimed that without optimization of many of the device parameters, initial device-fabrication attempts yielded an impressive PCE of 5.53% (with Jsc = 11.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V and FF = 0.52). This high performance, achieved without using any single or binary additives or special interlayers, may simplify device processing and optimization.
CV and UV-Vis data indicated the lack of conjugation between the four PDI units in TPE-PDI4, which allows it to maintain a relatively high LUMO level and achieve OPVs with a higher Voc than those of the corresponding PCBM-based cells. Moreover, the 3D structure of TPE-PDI4 facilitates the formation of a 3D charge-transport network and thus enables a reasonably good electron-transport ability. These advantageous features of TPE-PDI4 were clearly demonstrated by comparing TPE-PDI4 with BP-PDI2, which has a 2D molecular structure.31
3. Modification of the film-forming kinetics
Shape is a remarkable difference between fullerenes and small-molecule acceptors; thus, the spherical shape of the formers favours phase segregation giving rise to a nanoscale interpenetrating network, which accounts, in part, for the excellent performances of these solar cells. On the other hand, efficiencies in non-fullerene cells suffer from the lower electron mobility and recombination losses.
The twisted conformation of a PDI dimer such as bis-PDI-T-EG (Fig. 3) is a hindrance to phase segregation in the blend and also to the aggregation of the acceptor molecules.
Recently, a dramatic increase in the power conversion efficiency (from 1.4 up to 6.1%) in a polymer:small molecule (D:A) system of PBDTTT-C-T and bis-PDI-T-EG (Fig. 3) has been described. This efficiency was achieved from a conventional single-junction solar cell with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca/Al, after using solvent-vapor annealing (SVA), a method to put the as-cast active film in the vapor of a solvent to reconstruct the film morphology. The improvement was attributed to the fine-tuning of the parameters relative to the film-forming kinetics, which was optimized by the manipulation of the additive content during film processing, the volume of the host solvent for SVA, the volume ratio of the additive versus the host solvent for SVA, and the time for SVA. The result of this process was an increase in the photocurrent and the fill factor as a consequence of the reduction of the monomolecular and bimolecular loss and the improvement of the electron mobility. These improvements were associated with an enhancement of the phase segregation and consequently an enhancement of the self-aggregation of the donor and acceptor molecules in the solar cell blend.32
4. Summary and future perspectives

Table 1 lists the electronic characteristics and photovoltaic performances of the most efficient PDIs in BHJ solar cells. For the development of nonfullerene acceptors, research studies on PDIs would possibly remain dominative in future. Selecting appropriate linkage units to get finely controlled aggregation and transportation properties seems to be the major research direction.33
