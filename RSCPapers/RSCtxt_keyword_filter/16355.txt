    , Accepted 10th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractHerein, we report the fabrication of flexible solar cells based on a crystalline p-Si/n-ZnO heterostructure for the first time. An enhancement of ∼52% in the base efficiency was achieved by the application of spherical SiO2 nanoparticles as light trapping structures on the top. The use of ZnO not only offers a facile route of synthesis, but also provides an additional advantage of large band bending, leading to notable open circuit voltage and formation of an intermediate ultra-thin barrier layer of Zn2SiO4 for minimized carrier recombination. The spherical silica nanoparticles act as nanoresonators, causing absorption hot-spots in the thin silicon absorber, along with the capability of providing wide-angle light-collection. Simulation showed, for the higher angle of incidence, that the silica nanoparticles have the ability to bend light on the same side of the normal to the incident wave-front, thereby acting as a negative index metamaterial (NIM). The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of this device can make it important for the next-generation photovoltaics and roll-to-roll electronics.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, various types of solar cells such as organic, inorganic–organic hybrids, DSSCs, and perovskites are being investigated by researchers; however, conventional c-Si solar cells with and without structural modifications still dominate the photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and better stability as compared to those of others.1–5 There are still some challenges in the conventional 180 μm c-Si solar cell technology, which may act as a barrier for establishing photovoltaic systems as a prime power source in the renewable energy sector. The major drawback of the conventional c-Si solar cell is its high capital cost, thicker absorber layer, and incompatibility with the next-generation flexible electronics. Thus, it is very essential to fabricate stable and flexible c-Si solar cells by a facile synthetic route for compatibility with roll-to-roll processing. For this reason, to achieve low-cost and efficient solar cells, we have to scale down the c-Si wafer thickness, which will allow lower material usage along with flexibility. Shockley reported that an approximately 30 μm Si wafer is sufficient for fabricating high efficiency single-junction c-Si-based solar cells.6,7 However, to date, the PV industries have shown minimum interest in developing thin c-Si-based solar cells on a large scale. Therefore, it is high time to focus on the c-Si cell fabrication processes that will minimize material consumption without compromising the efficiency. During the past couple of years, there has been a boom in Si-based hybrid heterojunction solar cells, especially for heterojunctions made up with organic hole-transporting materials, as reported by J. He et al.8–10 According to their report, this type of solar cells can achieve conversion efficiency as high as 16.2%.8 Moreover, it has been theoretically proven that the use of ZnO as an active n-layer as well as an antireflection coating can help to achieve the conversion efficiency of ∼19%.11 Therefore, in this study, we aimed at introducing a pathway of fabricating thin c-Si/ZnO-based hybrid and flexible solar cells using a 30 μm wafer and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), as light trappers, as a pilot scheme. In the near future, this may lead to large scale production of cost-effective solar cells.
ZnO is an n-type semiconductor with unique properties such as piezoelectric, pyroelectric, optoelectronic, and ultraviolet lasing. It is also a promising material as an antireflecting coating (ARC) and a window layer for solar cell applications.11–16 In this study, we introduced ZnO for multi-functionality like the n-type counterpart with p-Si to form a heterojunction as well as an ARC material. Spherical SiO2 nanoparticles are also known to act as Mie resonators, which help to favorably couple light inside the device. Further, note that the refractive index of ZnO is less than that of c-Si but greater than that of both air and silica. This composite layer helps in grading the refractive index mismatch between air and silicon, resulting in more photon injection and subsequent electron–hole pair generation. The wide band-gap energy of ZnO (∼3.2 eV) also allows the entire visible light to pass through it and reach the Si wafer.17,18
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Device fabrication
Initially, we adopted the top-down approach to prepare the 30 μm c-Si wafer from a 180 μm p-type (100) wafer by patent pending alkali etching and exfoliation technique due to the unavailability of a commercial flexible wafer with a 30 μm thickness. On developing and commercializing a proper technique for the fabrication of thin silicon wafers, the improvement in throughput was achieved. Flexibility was gained at the 30 μm wafer thickness, which offered about 45° bending angle, making these wafers suitable for getting mounted on curved surfaces. These flexible wafers were then cleaned by boiling in a 10% HCl solution for 2 hours at 80 °C, and then, they were treated with 10% HF for 5 minutes for the removal of native oxides. A 5 μm thick ZnO layer was then deposited on the flexible c-Si substrate via chronoamperometry using a three-electrode electrochemical unit (CHI 6145E potentiostat/galvanostat) with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The working solution was 0.1 M aqueous Zn(NO3)2 solution, and the pH value was ca. 6. The electrochemical reaction was carried out at 90 °C without stirring. Chronoamperometric scan was performed at the fixed peak potential of −1.04 V for 1800 sec to obtain the ZnO layer with a 5 μm thickness on the flexible Si substrate. The Si/ZnO hybrid structure was then annealed at 600 °C for 10 min in air to obtain better crystallinity and junction formation.
The flexible c-Si/ZnO hybrid structure was tested for the solar cell performances, which were then notably improved by the application of SiO2 nanoparticles on the top as a light harvesting material. Modified Stöber method was adopted to synthesize SiO2 NPs with 300 nm diameter using the following recipe: 75 mL ethanol (anhydrous, 99.5%) was mixed with 10 mL of de-ionized water (18 MΩ) using a magnetic stirrer at 30 °C. Then, 5 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%) and 3 mL ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 30%) were slowly added to the solution under constant stirring at 2000 rpm for 45 min.19 The reagents were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. After 45 minutes, SiO2 NPs with 300 nm diameter were obtained in the form of a colloid. Next, 0.5 mL of these colloidal SiO2 NPs was then spin-coated on the c-Si/ZnO hybrid structure. Silica (SiO2) was chosen to serve as the light harvester due to its unique properties such as optimum refractive index (1.27) between air (1) and ZnO(1.5–2.5), which makes it an important candidate for favorable scattering of light inside the cell.1,6,7,17,18 Finally, front and back ohmic contacts were obtained using metallic Ag and Al, respectively, by thermal evaporation technique. The complete cell was encapsulated within two transparent films of polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 13 μm, Sigma Aldrich). The schematic of this solar cell and the image of the real finished device are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The total area of the device was 1 cm2, and after taking the front contacts, as shown in Fig. 1b, the active area of the device becomes around 0.65 cm2. The ratio of the metal shadow to ZnO layer was 0.35:1.

2.2. Characterization
To investigate the material properties of the Si(30 μm)/ZnO(5 μm)/SiO2 hybrid structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and optical reflectance measurements were carried out. XRD was performed using a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer with a Bragg–Brentano goniometer, Cu Kα radiation source, and θ–2θ scanning mechanism. FESEM and FTIR were carried out using a Zeiss SIGMA electron microscope and Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two spectrometer, respectively. Optical reflectance and current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device were measured by a Bentham PVE-300 spectral response unit. Optical simulations were carried out using Lumerical FDTD Solutions to verify and elucidate the experimentally observed phenomena. The angular efficiency response of the fabricated solar cell was measured with the help of a rotating zig, which rotated the solar cell with respect to the light source. This technique provides an additional advantage of accounting for the cosine effect for non-normal angles of incidence.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization by XRD and FTIR
The XRD pattern of the flexible Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid device is presented in Fig. 2. The main diffraction from Si was observed at 2θ = 33.23 degree, corresponding to the (211) plane (JCPDS #170901), whereas a strong diffraction peak was observed at 2θ = 68.78 degree, which was in good agreement with the standard ZnO(201) plane (JCPDS #790208). A small diffraction peak of ZnO(102) was also noticed at 2θ = 47.36 degree. Moreover, three diffractions at 2θ = 54.18, 55.97, and 61.34 degree can be assigned to SiO2(210), (552), and (681) planes (JCPDS #840791), respectively. A small diffraction peak at 2θ = 32.57 degree was also observed, which reflected the presence of Zn2SiO4(113) in the device. High temperature annealing of the Si/ZnO hybrid structure in air might be the reason behind the formation of zinc silicate. It was expected that zinc silicate will be formed in the Si–ZnO interface, which acts as the passivation layer as well as a barrier layer for this p–n junction device due to its high dielectric constant and wide band-gap energy (∼5.0 eV).20 The amorphous hump in the lower 2θ region (from 20° to 40°) might be attributed to the presence of the top amorphous SiO2 layer. The XRD pattern confirms the presence of the constituents Si, ZnO, and SiO2 in the proposed device.20–23

To further probe the presence of a Zn2SiO4 layer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out from 500 to 4000 cm−1 spectral range by scraping off the required amount of material from the Si/ZnO hybrid structure after annealing and prior to SiO2 NP coating. A KBr pellet was prepared with the scraped off material using a standard procedure to carry out the analysis. The FTIR spectrum of the sample (Fig. 2b) revealed the presence of seven distinct peaks. The broad peak centered at 3422 cm−1 and the small peak at 1647 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the O–H groups, respectively, in the physically adsorbed water molecules.24 The peak centered at 1090 cm−1 is attributed to the presence of asymmetric Si–O–Si stretching, whereas the shoulder peak at 986 cm−1 is due to the presence of Si–O symmetric stretching of the SiO4 group.25,26 The torsional vibration of Si–O was also observed at 811 cm−1.25 The band for Zn–O–Si symmetric stretching was found to be centered at 624 cm−1, which is the signature band for Zn2SiO4.27,28 At 560 cm−1, the band for symmetric stretching of Zn–O (from ZnO4 moiety) was observed.29,30 The presence of the absorption bands corresponding to Zn–O–Si and Zn–O suggests a possible formation of Zn2SiO4.
3.2. Morphology
The cross-sectional FESEM image of the ZnO film on a flexible c-Si substrate after annealing is shown in Fig. 3a, which reveals a thickness of about 5 μm for the ZnO layer. The top view of the Si/ZnO structure (Fig. 3b) reveals a quite uneven surface morphology of the ZnO layer. Fig. 3c represents the topography of the SiO2-coated Si/ZnO structure. Perfectly spherical SiO2 NPs with around 300 nm diameter were found to be randomly distributed on the Si/ZnO heterostructure. The extremely uneven morphology of the Si/ZnO structure might be responsible for this random distribution of the SiO2 NPs as the top layer. This uneven morphology of the Si/ZnO heterostructure, as well as random distribution of the spherical SiO2 NPs on the ZnO layer, will help in better light trapping by multiple bouncing and scattering. Multiple layers (approximately 5 layers) of SiO2 NPs are also evident in Fig. 3d, which are expected to play a constructive role towards better light trapping.

3.3. Reflectance
In this type of a device structure, the ZnO layer not only acts as the n-type counterpart, but also performs as an anti-reflecting coating (ARC) on the cell. It has been mentioned in the introduction that the refractive index (RI) of ZnO is 1.5–2.522,23, which falls between that of SiO2 (RI = 1.27) and Si (RI = 3.34). This makes ZnO a suitable bi-functional material for the junction formation as well as an anti-reflecting coating. The layerwise matching of the refractive index may lead to a lowering of reflectance from the overall device. To investigate this phenomenon, a layerwise reflectance (%) measurement was carried out for the proposed hybrid cell. The reflectance of bare Si, Si/ZnO, and Si/ZnO/SiO2 is shown in Fig. 4, and the integrated values were found to be 37%, 27%, and 24%, respectively (considering AM 1.5G solar spectrum). A significant lowering (27%) of reflectance was observed after coating the flexible Si with a 5 μm ZnO layer. A further lowering of 11.11% in the integrated reflectance was obtained by coating Si/ZnO with SiO2 nanospheres. This provided an overall lowering of 35.13% in reflectance for the Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid structure compared to that of the bare flexible c-Si. After ZnO coating, the lowering in reflectance was mainly observed in the visible region, with minor decrease in NIR. When Si/ZnO was coated with the SiO2 nanospheres, the major decrease in reflectance was observed within 700–1100 nm, mainly in the NIR region. This indicates significant exploitation of both visible and NIR photons of the incident light by this Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid structure, which is attributed to the matching of RI of different layers and suitable scattering of light by the SiO2 nanospheres.

3.4. Current–voltage characteristics

Fig. 5 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid solar cell under AM 1.5G illumination (measured using a Cell Tester CT-50AAA from PET, California, USA). A conversion efficiency of 2.73% was observed for the Si/ZnO heterojunction with Voc = 540 mV, Isc = 11 mA, and fill factor (FF) = 46%. On SiO2 coating, the conversion efficiency enhanced to 4.14% with Voc = 540 mV, Isc = 16 mA, and fill factor (FF) = 48%. This indicates about 45.5% enhancement in Isc and 52% improvement in the conversion efficiency, achieved by SiO2 coating on Si/ZnO. The maximum power output was calculated to be 2.99 and 3.89 mW respectively for Si/ZnO and Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid cells. Better light trapping by the SiO2 nanospheres might be the reason behind this enhancement in the efficiency of the Si/ZnO/SiO2 hybrid solar cells.

As the bandgap engineering of these solar cells is very crucial, care should be taken such that the lattice mismatch at the heterojunction interface should be minimized while maintaining proper band alignment of the constituent materials at the heterojunction. The performance of the Si/ZnO heterostructure as a solar cell can be explained with the help of the band diagram, as proposed in Fig. 6. Due to the large difference in the band gap energy of p-Si and n-ZnO, when a junction between them was formed, significant offset between the respective valence band and conduction band was observed. This led to notable band bending and favorable carrier transport with minimized charge recombination and significant open circuit voltage. On the other hand, the presence of the ultrathin Zn2SiO4 layer between p-Si and n-ZnO acted as the passivation layer in the junction, which also helped in restricting carrier recombination by reducing the interfacial trap densities, and it behaved like a barrier layer for this p–n junction device due to its high dielectric constant and wide band gap energy (∼5.0 eV).20 This in turn restricted the carrier recombination and helped increase the performance of the device. The presence of this intermediate passivation barrier layer makes this hybrid solar cell geometry similar to that of a conventional heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) solar cells.

On the other hand, spherical silica nanoparticles also act as nanoresonators, causing absorption hot-spots in the thin silicon absorber, along with the capability of providing wide-angle light-collection, which has been elaborated in Fig. 7. Angle of incidence greater than 60° has not been plotted as it would not be very realistic in a real working solar cell configuration.7 The enhancement ratio (ratio of the conversion efficiency of the solar cell with and without nanoparticles) is also shown in the same figure. Interestingly, it was observed that the enhancement ratio increased for higher angles of incidence (50% for normal angles of incidence and 70% for an angle of incidence of 60 degree). This behavior may be attributed to the advanced light management provided by the silica nanoparticles, especially at higher angles of incidence, which has been elaborated in the next section.

3.5. Rationale of advanced light management
To obtain an insight into the advanced light management capability offered by the silica nanoparticles, a simulation of the geometry resembling the real working solar cell was carried out in Lumerical FDTD Solutions®. A silicon substrate having a thickness of 30 μm with 5 μm ZnO layer and 5 overlying layers of silica nanoparticles was experimentally simulated. It is quite evident from the simulated result (Fig. 8a and b) that at higher angles of incidence (60°), the silica nanoparticles act as metamaterial Mie resonators. Although the behavior of the silica NPs as Mie resonators has been well researched,31 its ability to bend light on the same side of the normal to the incident wave-front (metamaterial behavior) is not well explored to the best of our knowledge. This phenomenon of negative refractive index exerted by the silica metamaterial stack can be clearly seen from Fig. 8a and b, which show the electric field distribution along air/silica/ZnO/Si at the wavelengths of (a) 750 nm and (b) 1000 nm for a 60° angle of incidence.
 Fig. 8  Electric field distribution along air/silica/ZnO/Si at wavelengths of (a) 750 nm and (b) 1000 nm for 60° angle of incidence. 
Herein, note that for normal angles of incidence, the role of the silica nanoparticle stack was somewhat limited as it offered normal Mie scattering due to the excitation of quadrupolar or higher order modes at particular frequencies (Mie resonance). At these resonance frequencies, they coupled the incoming light, efficiently causing electric field hot-spots in the underlying ZnO and Si layers. Note that lower resonance frequencies (higher wavelength) of the nanoparticles are of particular interest for solar cell applications as they allow trapping of light in the higher wavelength region (especially the NIR region) of the incident AM 1.5G solar spectrum. The electric field hot-spots will lead to enhanced absorption hot-spots only in the absorber silicon layer and not in the ZnO layer (band gap of 3.4 eV with negligible imaginary portion of refractive index). Alternatively, the light management capability of the silica nanoparticles (Fig. 8) can also be understood via whispering gallery modes (WGM), wherein the incident light gets trapped in the silica spheres by total internal reflection and leaks into the underlying substrate due to evanescent modes. The same phenomenon is evident from Fig. 4, which shows significant reduction in reflection (increase in absorption) in the wavelength region of 700–1100 nm, especially in the NIR region.
However, for higher angles of incidence, such as 60° (Fig. 8), the light management offered by silica nanoparticles can be best explained by the phenomenon of WGM. For high incident angles, the incoming light gets coupled into the topmost silica layer and spins into the underlying silica layer. The spinning of the incident wave-front causes the refracted wave-front to come back on the same side of the normal to the incident wave-front. This makes the silica nanoparticle stack to act as a metamaterial, offering negative index of refraction. However, the spinning of light coupled with the evanescent modes leads to electric field hot-spots in the underlying substrate with absorption hot-spots in the absorbing silicon layer, especially at higher wavelengths. Fig. 8a and b show two typical results obtained at the wavelengths of 750 nm and 1000 nm at the angle of incidence corresponding to 60°. It was observed that electric field enhancements occurred in the silicon absorber layer, which in turn led to the absorption hot-spots. Thus, the enhancement factor in photon absorption obtained at higher angles of incidence was higher as compared to that of normal incidence. The simulation result were found to correlate with those shown Fig. 10, where the enhancement ratio (ratio of the conversion efficiency of the solar cell with and without nanoparticles) is shown.
3.6. Photon collection

Fig. 9 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) under an AM 1.5G radiation of the fabricated solar cells with and without silica nanoparticles. As evident from the figure, there was a significant increase in the EQE (7.97%), especially in the longer wavelength (800–1100 nm, 6.77%) region for the ZnO/Si hybrid solar cell with silica nanoparticles as a Mie resonator. To gain a deeper insight into the matter, the enhancement factor of the external quantum efficiency and injected photons for the silica/ZnO/Si hybrid solar cells with respect to wavelength is shown in Fig. 10. Note that the enhancement factor of EQE is more than that of the injected photons. In fact, it was observed that the enhancement ratio increased for higher angles of incidence (50% for normal angles of incidence and 70% for an angle of incident angle of 60°). This can be attributed to the better collection of the injected photons over the entire AM 1.5G solar spectrum, especially in the wavelength range of 800–1100 nm. The better collection of the injected photons, i.e. the enhancement in the internal quantum efficiency, is attributed to the formation of more absorption hot-spots in the higher wavelength region, as already shown in Fig. 8. This further establishes the fact that the silica nanoparticles act as a composite anti-reflection coating(ARC)/light trapping structure (LTS), which offers not only a better injection of the incident photons but also a better collection of the injected photons due to its advanced light management capabilities that are essential for future thin/ultrathin solar absorbers.

 Fig. 10  Enhancement factor of external quantum efficiency and injected photons for silica/ZnO/Si hybrid solar cells with respect to wavelength. 
Moreover, to establish the coherency between the I–V characteristics and spectral response, the EQE of the final device was integrated with respect to the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. The calculated value of Jsc in this case was 27.71 mA cm−2. When scaled with respect to the active device area of 0.65 cm2, the expected current to be delivered by the device was found to be 18.01 mA. This is in close agreement with our experimentally observed value for Isc (16.0 mA) and falls almost within the tolerance limit.
To evaluate the bending characteristics of the fabricated solar cells, I–V parameters were analyzed by bending the PET-encapsulated solar cell along the x and y directions, as shown in Fig. 1b. A cylindrical support with ∼5 mm radius of curvature was used to mount the cell. Fig. 11 shows the I–V characteristics of the cell under no bending, X-bending, and Y-bending conditions. The current delivered by the solar cell under X and Y bending conditions was found to be about 13.72 and 13.50 mA, respectively. For the X-bending condition, the Voc, FF, and efficiency were found to be 542.8 mV, 47%, and 3.5%, respectively. For the Y-bending condition, the Voc, FF, and efficiency were found to be 541.5 mV, 47%, and 3.44%, respectively. The values of Isc and efficiency are to some extent less than the values (16.0 mA and 4.14%, respectively) obtained for the no bending (flat) condition. This might be attributed to the lower amount of illumination received by the bent solar cell surface. The results can be highly correlated with our previous observations on angular efficiency response, as described in the Section 3.4 and Fig. 7, in which the actual illumination on the flat solar cell was varied due to the rotation of the zig housing of the cell with respect to the source. No significant change in Voc and FF was observed due to these X and Y bendings. When the bend was released, the Voc, Isc, FF, and efficiency became 533.3 mV, 15.75 mA, 47%, and 3.95%, respectively. The bending of the solar cell did not cause any irreversible influence on the I–V characteristics of the device, as can be seen from the I–V curve (Fig. 11) obtained after releasing the bend force and making the cell flat again.

4. Conclusions
In this study, we focused on the simple fabrication technique of a flexible solar cell with low material consumption and proper light management as a pilot scheme. It was observed that the silica nanoparticles helped coupling the incident light via whispering gallery modes (WGM) into the underlying substrate. The exertion of the WGM due to the nanoparticles helped to bend the incident light on the same side of the normal to the incident wave-front, resulting in a negative index of refraction. Further research on proper bandgap engineering by the introduction of AlN or TiN at the heterojunction interface can be carried out to minimize the recombination velocity and lower the lattice mismatch between p-Si and n-ZnO, which would lead to further increase in the Jsc. Doping of ZnO with a proper element, such as Ga, or using a suitable hole transporting material, such as PEDOT:PSS, on the ZnO layer can also be performed to improve the device performance. This can make the device an acceptable candidate in the low-cost flexible solar cell community for future flexible roll-to-roll processing-based electronics.
