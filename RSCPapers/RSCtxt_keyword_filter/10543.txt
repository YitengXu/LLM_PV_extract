    , Accepted 1st July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractWe prepared three new push–pull dyes JA3, JA4 and JA0 through structure optimization, and applied them in DSSCs. Judicious molecular structure optimization of dyes can significantly improve the performance of DSSCs. Spirobifluorene as a building block was introduced onto the phenothiazine donor groups. Compared to JA1, the steric effect of the spirobifluorene building block can effectively reduce charge recombination by preventing the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thus the Voc of JA3 increased from 701 mV to 800 mV. In order to further improve the light-harvesting ability of the DSSC, we introduced a benzothiadiazole unit (BTD) and prepared D–A–π–A dye JA4. As expected, the Jsc of JA4 increased from 12.32 to 14.43 mA cm−2 compared to that of JA3, and the device reached the highest PCE of 7.0%. Moreover, since extending the π-conjugated system is known to decrease the Voc of DSSC, the porphyrin unit was removed and dye JA0 was synthesized. Notably, the DSSC based on JA0 reached a very high Voc of 840 mV and a high PCE of 6.69%: to our knowledge, this is the highest Voc for DSSCs based on phenothiazine dyes with I−/I3− electrolyte.
Introduction
With the energy crisis and environment pollution becoming more and more serious, the development and utilization of new energy sources has become one of the immediate tasks for mankind. Solar energy has great potential for exploitation, the characteristics of a rich resource, convenient collection and a clean pollution-free process completely meet the requirements for sustainable development of human society.1,2 In 1991, Grätzel and co-workers first reported dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), they obtained 7.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with low cost.3 Over the next 20 years, DSSC underwent rapid development with the continuous efforts of many researchers, and a large number of excellent dyes and related materials have been developed.4–8 Recently, Kakiage prepared the silyl-anchor dye ADEKA-1, which exhibited a high PCE of 14.3% with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte. To our knowledge, this is the highest PCE by far for DSSCs.9
A complete DSSC is made of photoanode, sensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode.10–12 The core of a DSSC is to use a sensitizer to absorb photons and generate electrons, thus the development of novel and efficient sensitizers is one of the most direct and effective ways to improve the performance of DSSCs. A D–π–A (donor–π–acceptor) structure is the most common framework for efficient dyes.13–15 This framework has outstanding efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) properties, moreover it is very easily modified.16–19 Many groups devote their efforts to optimizing the dye molecular structure, because this strategy can achieve the following aims: (i) improve the spectral response of dyes, thereby enhancing the light-harvesting ability of DSSCs; (ii) adjust the energy levels of dyes, thereby enhancing the electron injection rate and dye regeneration rate; (iii) suppress dye aggregation and reduce charge recombination, thereby enhancing the Jsc (short-circuit current density) and Voc (open-circuit photovoltage) of DSSCs; (iv) improve the photostability and adsorption stability of dyes, thereby enhancing the long-term stability and durability of DSSCs.20–22 Through the continuous efforts and exploration of researchers, many new frameworks such as D–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–A, D–π–(A)n and D–A–π–A have been explored.23–26 In particular, for the D–A–π–A structure, the additional acceptor can adjust the energy levels of dyes, improve the spectral response, enhance the photovoltaic performance and greatly improve the photostability of dyes: Zhu et al. have discussed this in detail.27,28 Thus, the structure optimization of dyes plays a very important role in improving the performance of DSSCs. Impressively, the PCE of YD2-o-C8 was 12.3% in 2011; later, SM315 was prepared after further optimization in 2014, and the PCE of SM315 reached 13%.29,30
Phenothiazine is often used as a donor in DSSCs for its efficient π-conjugated system and unique hole-transporting ability.31–35 In our previous work, we used a phenothiazine unit containing a long alkyl to modify the porphyrin dye JA1. The DSSC based on JA1 exhibited a PCE of 5.76%, with the Voc of 701 mV, Jsc of 12.10 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.8%.36 Herein, we further modified the molecular structure of JA1 and prepared JA3, JA4 and JA0 (Fig. 1). Spirobifluorene as a building block was introduced onto the phenothiazine donor groups, as we deduced that the steric effect of spirobifluorene can effectively prevent the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing charge recombination, thus the Voc of JA3 was increased to 800 mV. In order to improve the light-harvesting ability of the DSSC, benzothiadiazole (BTD) was added in D–A–π–A dye JA4. BTD has been widely used in the design of D–A–π–A dyes.37 Herein, the additional strong electron-withdrawing unit results in significant broadening of the Soret and Q-band absorbance features compared to JA3, yielding improved light-harvesting and efficiency. Because the absorption behaviour of JA4 has been improved compared to JA3, the Jsc of JA4 increased from 12.32 to 14.43 mA cm−2. In addition, incorporation of BTD into JA4 as an electron trap is favourable for electron distribution, and facilitating the electron migration direction to the acceptor. Moreover, since porphyrin units can cause dye aggregation and π–π stacking, we got removed the porphyrin unit and synthesized dye JA0. Notably, the DSSC based on JA0 reached a very high Voc of 840 mV and a high PCE of 6.69%; to our knowledge, this is the highest Voc for DSSCs based on phenothiazine dyes with the I−/I3− electrolyte. Because the theoretical Voc is about 900 mV with the I−/I3− electrolyte, this strategy is very beneficial to improve the performance of DSSCs. We investigated the optical properties and photovoltaic performance of the three dyes, and analyzed the differences caused by the different structures.

Synthesis of dyes
The chemical structures of JA1, JA3, JA4 and JA0 are shown in Fig. 1, and the synthesis route is depicted in Scheme S1.† The synthesis details and characterization data are shown in ESI.†
Fabrication of DSSCs
The working electrode (active area 0.196 cm2) was prepared by screen printing TiO2 paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (15 Ω sq−1). For preparation of the DSSCs, FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min two times followed by rinsing with water and ethanol. Then, the plates were immersed into 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The TiO2 paste consisted of 12 μm thick films (particle size 20 nm, pore size 32 nm). The TiO2 films were formed with a programmed procedure: (1) 80 °C for 15 min; (2) 135 °C for 10 min; (3) 325 °C for 30 min; (4) 375 °C for 5 min; (5) 450 °C for 15 min, and (6) 500 °C for 15 min. Then the films were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Then the electrode was immersed into dye solution (0.3 mM of JA0, 0.2 mM of JA3 and JA4, THF/EtOH = 1/4) for 18 h at room temperature. The working electrode and the Pt counter electrode were then sealed with a Surlyn film (25 μm) by heating the sandwich-type cell at 110 °C. The electrolyte was introduced through pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling, and the hole was sealed with a Surlyn film and a thin glass (0.1 mm thickness) cover by heating. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 50 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in acetonitrile.
Characterization of DSSCs
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard global AM 1.5G solar irradiation supplied by a xenon light source (Oriel). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs were measured by a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of the irradiance. The single wavelength was selected by a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125). Light intensity was measured using a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured using an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
Theoretical calculations
Density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2DZ level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.
UV-Vis spectra, photoluminescence, electrochemical properties and measurement of the amounts of dye adsorption
The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence lifetimes of the dyes were measured on a FLS920 spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were recorded by an IM6EX Electrochemical Workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using a Chenhua CHI660D model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai).
The amounts of dye adsorption on the TiO2 films were measured by a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The sensitized electrodes were immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (H2O/THF = 1/1), which resulted in desorption of each dye.
Results and discussion
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of JA0, JA3 and JA4 in THF are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. D–π–A dye JA3 exhibited typical porphyrin absorption characteristics at the Soret and Q bands. The absorption below 400 nm can be attributed to electronic transitions from π–π*, and the 400–700 nm range can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). At the Soret band, dye JA3 showed a high molar extinction coefficient (3.66 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at 447 nm. When the benzothiadiazole unit was added in D–A–π–A dye JA4, the spectrum was changed, most evident by the splitting of the Soret band, resulting in a shoulder at 459 nm on the maximum at 435 nm. The whole spectrum became broader compared to that of JA3, especially at the Q bands, the band at 574 nm changed slightly compared to that of JA3, but the lowest-energy Q-band absorption of JA4 was significantly red-shifted to 648 nm. For JA0, there was no porphyrin unit in the molecular structure, thus dye JA0 displayed a narrow absorption. The maximum absorption peak of JA0 appeared at 452 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of 8.2 × 103 M−1 cm−1. The major emission bands of JA3, JA4 and JA0 are at 638 nm, 685 nm and 567 nm, respectively, consistent with the trend of the absorption spectra of the three dyes (Fig. S1†). The absorption spectra of the three dye-sensitized 12 μm thick TiO2 substrates were further investigated (Fig. S2†). All the spectra showed a broader and higher absorption compared to the spectra in THF. After anchoring the dyes on the TiO2 surface, the ICT bands of dye JA3 and JA4 displayed a slight blue-shift (H-aggregation), which can be ascribed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. The ICT bands of dye JA0 displayed a red-shift (J-aggregation); it was assumed that the amount of dye adsorption increased sharply due to the lack of porphyrin units, resulting in J-aggregation.38 This speculation can be supported by the absorption spectra of the dyes on TiO2 films with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). We found that the ICT bands of JA3 and JA4 displayed a slight red-shift and the ICT band of JA0 displayed a blue-shift. Though dye aggregation may quench the excited state and hamper electron injection, J-aggregation can also enhance the performance of the DSSC due to enhanced light-harvesting at longer wavelengths.39,40

Electrochemical studies
We measured the cyclic voltammetry curves of the three dyes to evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. The cyclic voltammetry curves are shown in Fig. S3,† and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The ground state oxidation potentials (EOX) of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are 0.98 V, 1.11 V and 1.04 V (versus NHE), respectively. Because the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple is about 0.4 V (versus NHE), and the EOX values of the three dyes are all more positive than 0.4 V, the three oxidized dye molecules can be regenerated by the reducing species in the iodine electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S4,† the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) was estimated from the intercept of the normalized absorption and emission spectra. The values of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are 2.41 eV, 2.07 eV and 1.90 eV, respectively. Hence, the corresponding excited oxidation potentials  of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are −1.43 V, −0.96 V and −0.86 V, respectively. The values are all more negative than the CB level of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE), which implies an efficient electron injection process from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2. Especially for JA0, such a high electron injection driving force suggests that the DSSC based on JA0 will have a good electron injection rate.
Theoretical calculations
Density function theory (DFT) calculations at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2DZ level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs were utilized to gain insight into the electron-density distributions of the three dyes. As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO levels of porphyrin dyes JA3 and JA4 are delocalized throughout the phenothiazine donors and the porphyrin rings, and the HOMO levels of JA0 are delocalized in the phenothiazine donor. When the benzothiadiazole unit was added in D–A–π–A dyes JA0 and JA4, the electron-density distributions were significantly different from those of D–π–A dye JA3. For JA3, the LUMO orbitals are mainly delocalized in the porphyrin ring and acceptor. For JA0 and JA4, the LUMO orbitals are mainly delocalized in the BTD units and acceptors. The electronic properties of the three dyes indicate that such a well-separated orbital distribution is conducive to the electron transfer from HOMO to LUMO and can induce the photoinduced charge injection from the LUMO to the conduction band of TiO2.
 Fig. 3  The HOMO and LUMO frontier molecular orbitals of JA0, JA3 and JA4 calculated at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2DZ level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. 
We performed time-resolved luminescence experiments of the dyes in THF and on a TiO2 surface to gain insight into the electron injection dynamics of the three dyes (Fig. S5†).29,30 The fluorescence lifetimes of JA0, JA3 and JA4 in THF are 6.42 ns, 2.51 ns and 4.83 ns, respectively. When the three dyes are anchored on a TiO2 surface, the emissions of the three dyes are all strongly quenched. The lifetimes of JA0, JA3 and JA4 on TiO2 are about 600 ps, 610 ps and 570 ps, respectively. The results suggest that the three dyes all have high electron injection efficiency, as a result of efficient photoinduced charge injection from the LUMO of the dyes to the conduction band of TiO2.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
DSSCs based on the three dyes were fabricated under the same conditions. The photocurrent-density–photovoltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4, and the photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 2. In our previous work, the DSSC based on JA1 exhibited a PCE of 5.76%, with the Voc of 701 mV, Jsc of 12.10 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.8%. When the spirobifluorene unit was added in the phenothiazine donor, the DSSC based on JA3 exhibited a PCE of 6.27%, with the Voc of 800 mV, Jsc of 12.33 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.52%. It is clear that the Jsc changes slightly, in contrast the Voc increased by 99 mV. We deduced that the steric effect of spirobifluorene can effectively prevent the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing the charge recombination, thus the Voc of JA3 increased by 99 mV compared to that of JA1. When the BTD unit was added in JA4, the PCE of the device reached the highest value of 7.0%, and the Jsc increased from 12.33 to 14.44 mA cm−2. But the Voc decreased by 28 mV: the reason was that the conjugation extension may cause dye aggregation and π–π stacking, thereby resulting in a decreased Voc. Interestingly, upon removal of the porphyrin unit, the DSSC based on JA0 still exhibited a high PCE of 6.69%, although there was a decrease in the Jsc, but the Voc reached the highest value of 840 mV. To our knowledge, this is the highest Voc for DSSC based on phenothiazine dyes with I−/I3− electrolyte. It is known that with the same electrode materials and the same electrolyte for DSSCs, the key to improving the Voc is to improve the electron density of the TiO2 conduction band. We can improve the electron injection rate or reduce the electron recombination to achieve this purpose. Wang et al. designed a series of double D–π–A dyes: this strategy was favorable for reducing intermolecular interaction and retarding charge recombination, thus the Voc was greatly improved.41–44 Herein, the LUMO of JA0 is sufficiently high for electron injection, in addition the steric effect of spirobifluorene can effectively retard charge recombination, thus the Voc of JA0 is very high.

As shown in Fig. 4b, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were also measured. The IPCE curves of JA1 and JA3 exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 680 nm, but the value of JA3 was higher than that of JA1 in the range of 450–680 nm. JA4 displayed impressively high IPCE values in the whole visible range, with photocurrent generation up to about 750 nm, demonstrating the utility of the BTD unit for improvements in visible and infrared light-harvesting properties. Interestingly, we found JA0 had an excellent IPCE spectrum; the DSSC based on JA0 not only exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 680 nm, but also had a higher value in the whole visible range. It is consistent with the Jsc values of the DSSCs. We measured the amounts of dye adsorption of the three dyes anchored on TiO2 surfaces. The values of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are 6.95, 1.25 and 1.56 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. This may be another reason for the differences between the Jsc values of the DSSCs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
With the same electrode materials and the same electrolyte for DSSCs, the fluctuation of electron density (charge recombination rate in DSSCs) has an important influence on the Voc. At a given photocarrier generation flux, the electron density is mainly determined by the interfacial recombination rate of TiO2 electrons. We investigated the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark conditions to study the charge recombination dynamics of the DSSCs.45–47 The applied voltage was −0.7 V and was scanned from 105 to 1 Hz.48,49 As shown in Fig. 5, the large semicircle represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Obviously, the radius of the large semicircle decreased in the order: JA0 > JA3 > JA4, suggesting that the JA0 based-device had the largest Rrec. The results suggested that JA0 can efficiently reduce the charge recombination. In generally, extending the π-conjugated system decreases the Voc of DSSCs. It is in agreement with the Voc values of the DSSCs based on the three dyes. In addition, the peak frequency (f) in the lower frequency region from the Bode phase plots of the DSSCs can be obtained (Fig. 5b). The electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated from τ = 1/(2πf).50–52 The f values of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are 3.8, 7.0 and 13.5 Hz, respectively. The corresponding electron lifetime values of JA0, JA3 and JA4 are 41.9, 22.7 and 11.8 ms, respectively. A longer electron lifetime corresponds to a lower dark current. Thus, the DSSC based on JA0 has the highest Voc.

Conclusions
In summary, we prepared three new push–pull dyes JA0, JA3 and JA4, and applied them in DSSCs. Compared to JA1, the steric effect of the spirobifluorene building block can effectively reduce charge recombination, thus the Voc of JA3 increased from 701 mV to 800 mV. The BTD unit added in dye JA4 can further optimize the molecular structure. The additional acceptor of the BTD unit adjacent to the donors can improve the distribution of donor electrons and enhance the light-harvesting ability, thus the Jsc of JA4 increased from 12.32 to 14.43 mA cm−2 and the device reached the highest PCE of 7.0%. Moreover, since extending the π-conjugated system is known to decrease the Voc of DSSCs, the porphyrin unit was removed and dye JA0 was synthesized. Notably, the DSSC based on JA0 reached a very high Voc of 840 mV and a high PCE of 6.69%; to our knowledge, this is the highest Voc for DSSCs based on phenothiazine dyes with I−/I3− electrolyte. Thus, judicious molecular structure optimization of push–pull dyes can significantly improve the performance of DSSCs.
