    AbstractThis study presents a novel nanocomposite conducting plate (CP) reinforced by graphene at a low weight fraction percentage, and compares the properties of this novel nanocomposite CP with those containing various weight fractions of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) (0.2, 0.5, and 1 phr). Adding only 0.2 phr of graphene as reinforcement remarkably enhanced the thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of the nanocomposite CP. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of nanocomposite CP below the glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased from 49.7 μm−1 m °C−1 to 26.9 μm−1 m °C−1 and the CTE above Tg decreased from 119.2 μm−1 m°C−1 to 55.2 μm−1 m °C−1. Thermal conductivity increased from 18.4 W m−1 K−1 to 27.2 W m−1 K−1. The flexural strength increased from to 28.0 MPa to 49.2 MPa. The in-plane electrical conductivity increased from 155.7 S cm−1 to 286.4 S cm−1. The enhancement percentages of these properties are 47.8%, 75.7%, and 83.9%, respectively, which are much higher than that of the original composite CP. These results indicate that using graphene as reinforcement in the preparation of nanocomposite CP is effective in terms of cost and performance, because of the low cost the raw material, graphite, and the fact that a lower loading of graphene than of MWCNT can yield the same performance. Moreover, this novel multi-functional nanocomposite CP has wide potential for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) counter electrode, and vanadium redox battery (VRB) applications.
1. Introduction
Composite conducting plates (CPs) are widely used alternative materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs),1,2 direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),3 and vanadium redox battery (VRB) applications,4,5 as shown in Scheme 1. Among these alternative power sources, PEMFCs have been intensively researched for both alternative energy and environmental considerations owing to their attractive features of high power density, low operating temperature and converting fuel to water as the only by-product.6 Conducting plates are the most costly,7 massive,8 and have multifunctional character. The CP must exhibit excellent electrical conductivity as a current collector, possess adequate mechanical strength to resist the clamping force during stack assembly, and long-term dimensional stability to prevent fuel gas leakage. Due to (i) brittleness, high cost, and difficulty in machining flow channels on a traditional graphite plate;9 (ii) high density and possible leaching of metal ions into the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) during cell operation, and passivation layer formation on the metal surface of the metal CP, the composite CP is a promising alternative material because of its low cost, ease in directly molding flow channels on the plate during processing, good corrosion resistance, and low weight.1,2 Cost models also estimate that using composite Cost models estimate that using composite CPs as an alternative material to replace graphite plates would reduce the cost of CPs of the stack from 60% to 15%–29%.10
 Scheme 1  The applications of nanocomposite conducting plate in energy fields. 
To optimize the electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composite CPs (>100 S cm−1, >25 MPa, respectively, the target of the Department of Energy (D.O.E.) in 201011,12), 20–30 wt% of resin13–15 is required to incorporate with graphite. However, most polymer resins are insulators and are associated with the problem of improving composite CP properties that need solving. Therefore, researchers have studied macro-/nano-filler reinforced composite CPs to overcome these problems. Among various reinforcements, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted considerable attention as a candidate for fabricating multi-functional composite CPs,2,6,15–17 due to their intrinsically high aspect ratio, lightweight, electrical conductivity, thermal properties, and mechanical properties. However, until now, researchers have endeavored to improve composite CP properties by incorporating a relatively small amount of reinforcing material.
Novoselov et al.19 reported graphene as a single layer of carbon atoms compactly packed into a two-dimensional (2-D) honeycomb lattice.18 Graphene is a potential new material for developing novel nanomaterial in a variety of applications, due to its unusual electronic character (with carrier mobilities up to 200,000 cm2 V−1 s−120,21),22–24 high thermal conductivity (∼4840–5300 W m−1 K−1),25 high mechanical properties and elasticity.26 Although micromechanical cleavage,19,27 liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite,28,29 and epitaxial growth30–32 have been considered as methods for preparing high-quality, non-oxidized monolayer graphene, these methods only produce flakes in very limited quantities. However, it is necessary to produce graphene or exfoliated graphite in bulk quantities for a wide range of applications with polymer composite materials.33–39 Hence, massive production of graphene is based mainly on preparing the precursor, graphite oxide (GO), and then reducing GO by two main approaches to remove a large portion of oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxide, and hydroxyl groups. One approach is chemical reduction via reducing agents such as hydrazine,36,40 sodium borohydride,41,42 hydroquinone,43 and strong alkaline.44 The other approach is thermal treatment by a rapid heating rate above the critical temperature of 550 °C under an inert atmosphere.45 The advantages of thermal de-oxygenation include rapid productivity of bulk amounts,39,46 used directly for further applications due to this dry process.
Graphene-based polymer nanocomposite has recently exhibited some interesting properties compared with the single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) or multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT). Stankovich et al.33 reported the lowest electrical percolation threshold value (∼0.1 vol%) for any carbon nanotube-excluded carbon-based polymer nanocomposite. The unique morphology of graphene dramatically affects the behavior of the surrounding polymer matrix corresponding to an unprecedented shift in glass transition temperature,34 and on enhanced mechanical properties at significantly lower content.39,46 Given these latest experimental results, graphene with a few layers may be a new suitable nano-filler in the polymer matrix with low quantity, resulting in considerably enhanced electrical and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite CP.
In this study, thermal reduction utilized to prepare bulk amounts of graphene. The structural change from GO to graphene was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and TEM. The fractured surfaces of MWCNT/VE and graphene/VE nanocomposite and the dispersion of graphene in VE were examined via SEM and TEM. The current investigation compared the thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of nanocomposite CP for vinyl ester-based composite CP with a fixed weight fraction (0.2 phr) of graphene with that of 0–1 phr of MWCNT nanocomposite CPs.
2. Experimental
Materials
Natural graphite powder (Alfa Aesar) was used as the starting material in the preparation of graphite oxide. The graphite had a particle size of ∼70 μm, a purity of 99.99995% and a density of 2.25 g cm−3. The graphite powder used to prepare composite conducting plate was obtained from the Great Carbon Co. Ltd., Taiwan. The density of the graphite powder was 1.88 g cm−3 and the particle size was less than 1000 μm. The bisphnol-A epoxy-based vinyl ester (VE) was obtained from the Swancor Co., Taiwan. MWCNTs (trade name : Ctube 100) with a purity of 95% and a surface area of 150–250 m2 g−1 were obtained from CNT Co., Ltd., Korea. The diameters of the MWCNTs were 10–50 nm and their lengths were 1–25 μm.
Preparation of graphite-oxide and graphene
Natural graphite powder was oxidized using Staudenmaier's method47 to produce graphite oxide (GO). In this method, graphite (5 g) was first mixed with sulfuric acid (87.5 mL) and nitric acid (45 mL), and the mixture was stirred. When graphite was dispersed uniformly, potassium chlorate (55 g) was added slowly and stirred for over 96 h. After the completion of the oxidizing reaction, the mixture was added into deionized water and then filtered. The GO was rinsed repeatedly and redispersed three times in a 5% solution of HCl. It was then washed continuously with deionized water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The GO slurry was dried and pulverized twice. Finally, the GO was heated to 1050 °C in an inert atmosphere and held in a furnace for 30 s to form graphene.45
Preparation of graphene/vinyl ester and MWCNT/vinyl ester nanocomposite
MWCNTs/VE and graphene/VE nanocomposites were prepared for SEM observation of their fractured surfaces and for TEM observation. The VE (6.75 g, 75 wt%) and initiator (tert-butyl perbenzoate, TBPB, 0.162 g, 1.8 phr) were dissolved in styrene monomer (SM, 1.53 g, 17 wt%)/low profile agent (polystyrene/styrene monomer (PS/SM) series) (0.72 g, 8 wt%); MWCNTs (18 mg, 0.2 phr) or graphene sheets (18 mg, 0.2 phr) were added. The mixtures were dispersed in the solution by sonication for 10 min. The mixtures thus prepared were poured slowly onto an aluminium plate, on which they were cured by increasing the temperature slowly from 80 to 120 °C in an oven. Finally, MWCNT/VE and graphene/VE nanocomposite were cured completely by evacuation at 140 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of graphene/vinyl ester and MWCNT/vinyl ester nanocomposite conducting plates
The bulk-molding compound (BMC) was prepared by mixing the VE mixture: a low profile agent, SM, a thickening agent (MgO), a release agent (Zinc Stearate, ZnSt) and an initiator with the graphite powder, in a kneader for 30 min. After 36 h of thickening, the BMC was compression-molded for 5 min at 150 °C. Various weight percentages of MWCNT (0.2, 0.5, and 1 phr) and 0.2 phr of graphene were added into the VE mixture, and BMC materials were prepared using the method that was described above. Table 1 elucidates the formulation of BMC.

Characterization and Instruments
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out at room temperature at a scan rate of 2 °C min−1 using a Shimadzu XD-5 X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 0.1542 nm) with a copper target and an Ni filter. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a PHI Quantera SXM/AES 650 Auger Electron Spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI INC., Japan) that was equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and an scanning monochromated Al Kα (hυ = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. A small spot lens system enabled a sample with an area of less than 1 mm2 to be analyzed. The Raman spectra were performed in a Stellar-PRO confocal Raman microscopy system (MODU-LASER, LLC), and the laser wavelength is 488 nm. A holographic notch filter reflected the exciting line into an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a DuPont-TGA951 at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in an N2 atmosphere. The thermal conductivity was measured using a Hot Disk thermal analyzer (TPS2500, Sweden), based on the TPS method.48 The dimensions of the bulk specimens were 50 × 50 × 4 mm and the sensor was placed between two similar slabs of CPs. The thermal conductivity of the samples was determined by fitting the data, according to the method of Gustavsson et al.49 The fractured surfaces of MWCNTs and graphene sheets in VE were investigated using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6330, Japan) (at OR with) an accelerating potential of 15.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed using a JEM-2100 electron microscope at 200 kV, and the as-prepared graphene was prepared for TEM measurements by casting one drop on carbon-coated copper grids, and then evaporating the solvent in air at room temperature. Ultrathin sections of graphene/VE nanocomposite with a thickness of less than 100 nm were prepared by cutting with a diamond knife using a microtome technique, and collected on 300-mesh copper grids. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was determined by TMA (TMA2940, DuPont, USA) at temperatures from 30 to 200 °C in both the X and Y directions, based on ASTM D-696.50 The flexural strength of specimens with dimensions 60.0 mm × 13.0 mm × 3.0 mm (L × W × T) were measured by the ASTM D-790 method using an Instron Model 4468 universal tester. The in-plane electrical conductivity of the composite bipolar plate was measured using a four point probe detector (C4S-54/5S, Cascade Microtech, Beaverton, Oregon, USA).
To test the performance of single PEM fuel cells, commercially available catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs, HEMEA 3 layers, Hephas Energy Co., Ltd., with Nafion-211 as polymer electrolyte membrane, and the platinum catalyst loaded on the sides of the anode and cathode were 0.3 mg cm−2 and 0.5 mg cm−2, respectively) with a 4 cm2 active electrode area and a gas diffusion layer (GDL) (SGL SIGRACET®, type 24 BC, with a hydrophobic microporous layer (MPL) coating on one side) were assembled by sandwiching them together with gaskets to provide gases sealing. The cell was closed tightly to a uniform torque of 20 kg-f-cm. The single fuel cell was tested at 70 °C with H2/O2 at ambient pressure. The hydrogen and oxygen gases were fed to the anode and cathode after they were passed through a bubble humidifier at 70 °C; the flow rates were maintained at 100 and 250 sccm, respectively, throughout the polarization testing). The performance of the single fuel cell was evaluated by measuring the I–V characteristics under an applied electronic load (Agilent, N3301A).
3. Results and discussion
Analysis of graphite oxide and thermal reduced graphene
The preparation of thermal reduced graphene involves two steps, (i) the fully oxidized graphite oxide (GO) by reaction of raw graphite under high oxidation circumstance, (ii) removing oxygen-containing functional groups from the surface of GO, forming the completely exfoliated graphene by a very rapid heating rate above the critical temperature, 550 °C.45 The exfoliation degree of GO and the obtained graphene were monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the present graphite, GO, and graphene. The graphite exhibits a typical sharp (002) peak at 26.25° with a d-spacing of 0.340 nm. As the graphite was converted into GO, the graphite peak shifted to a lower degree, 11.96°, with corresponding d-spacing of 0.740 nm, indicating that a large amount of oxygen atoms intercalated into the interlayer space and bonded to the graphite planar surface. A shoulder with a small peak observed at around 24°, implied that some portion of the GO did not fully intercalated. After thermal reduction, the sharp peak of graphite oxide disappeared and the (002) graphite peak reappeared due to the removal of most oxidized functional groups. The inset of Fig. 1 shows a typical multiple Lorentzian fitting for the (002) reflection in the case of graphene. Two peaks of 22.1° and 25.6° values are obtained from this fitting, corresponding to d-spacing values of 0.402 and 0.348 nm, respectively. These peaks are slightly lower than the raw graphite and the broad diffraction peak, implying that the graphene is composed of randomly ordered graphitic platelets with a corrugated structure.51 The current study calculated the corresponding layers of graphene with these two fitting peaks using Bragger and Scherrer formulas,52 primarily consisting of four layers.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of pristine graphite, graphite oxide, and graphene. The inset is graphene with Lorentzian fitting. 
Qualitative characterization was conducted by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) to elucidate the surface composition and variation of GO and graphene. Fig. 2 presents the C1s core level spectra of graphite oxide and graphene. The sp2 CC peak at 284.2 eV and deconvolution reveal three main oxygen component peaks presented in GO, C–OH (at 285.7 eV), C–O–C (at 286.2 eV), and C=O (at 287.5 eV), respectively, and a minor component from the O–C=O group appeared at 289.4 eV. The intensity summation consisting of C–OH and C–O–C obviously overtakes the sp2 CC peak, clearly reflecting a considerable degree of oxidation. The π–π* satellite peak at 291.5 eV assigned to π–electrons delocalized at the aromatic network in graphite, disappears with increasing oxidation.53 The peak intensities following subsequent thermal treatments associated with C–OH (285.4 eV), C–O–C (286.2 eV), and C=O (287.4 eV) decrease dramatically, indicating the removal of most of these functional groups from the graphene. The π–π* satellite peak at 291.5 eV observed in the graphene is too weak for characterizing in GO, indicating that the delocalized π conjugation is restored in the graphene. The sp2 CC peak at a slightly higher binding energy (0.3 eV up-shift) in graphene (284.5 eV) than in GO (284.2 eV), is located at the same binding energy as that in the raw graphite (284.5 eV, the C1s of XPS is not shown). This implies that the lack of π conjugation in the basal plane of GO leads to a higher energy state of sp2 CC, lowering the binding energy. In contrast, the recovery of the basal plane structure in graphene stabilizes the sp2 CC bonding, leading to a higher binding energy.
 Fig. 2  High-resolution C1s XPS spectra of graphite oxide and graphene. 
This research used Raman spectroscopy to further characterize the conjugated graphene-based materials. Fig. 3 presents the Raman spectra of pristine graphite, GO and graphene. GO and graphene possess a typical broad D- (breathing mode of A1g) and G-band (the in-plane bond-stretching motion of pairs of C sp2 atoms, E2g mode) shape due to the sp2 carbon network that has been broken into a nano-scale oxidized domain and an aromatic domain during the GO fabrication process.54,55 The current study attributes the D- and G-band at ∼1335 cm−1 and ∼1591 cm−1 to defect/disorder-induced modes and in-plane graphene vibrations. The graphite oxidation reflects on the broader D- and G- band and the up-shift of the G-band to a higher frequency in GO than that in graphite, which is located at 1581 cm−1. However, during GO transformation to the graphene, the G-band shifts back to a lower frequency located at ∼1582 cm−1, and the D-band decreases in intensity because of graphite “self-healing” with heat-treatment.54 The current study calculated the intensity ratio of the G- to D-bands (i.e. IG/ID), related to the in-plane crystallite size (or size of sp2 ring clusters (the aromatic domain) in a network of sp3 and sp2 bonded carbon56), La = 4.4(IG/ID).57,58 The ratio of GO and graphene and the corresponding crystallite size are IG/ID = 0.929, La = 4.09 nm for GO, and IG/ID = 1.27, La = 5.57 nm for graphene, respectively. According to the structure model suggested by Mattevi et al.,56 the decrease in the IG/ID ratio and the increase in La value after thermal reduction of GO to graphene reveal that the aromatic domains in GO isolated by oxygenated groups connect by the formation of new smaller aromatic domains during thermal reduction. The results of XPS, Raman, “self-healing”,54 and Mattevi's model56 suggest a reasonable interpretation to illustrate the G-band shift. The highly disordered oxidized domain (sp3 C–C and oxygenated groups) surrounding the aromatic domains destroys the long-range stabilized delocalization π conjugation structures corresponding to a smaller La value and the disappearance of the π–π* satellite peak in GO, leading to a higher frequency (higher energy) of G-band.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of pristine graphite, graphite oxide, and graphene. 
However, after thermal treatment, the G-band shifts back to lower frequency (lower energy), which may be attributed to repaired delocalized π conjugation structures, observed from the larger La and reappearance of the π–π* satellite peak in XPS. Precise interpretation of peak shifts reflected on Raman and XPS for GO and graphene is still ambiguous. These phenomena of peak shifts were reported by donor/acceptor molecules doping on the graphene were due to the modified Fermi level of graphene.59,60 The different electronic environments between insulated GO and conductive graphene might similarly induce the shift of Raman and XPS peaks. Compared to the La = 5.51 nm (IG/ID = 1.25) for MWCNT used in this study (Raman spectra is not shown), the La of graphene is slightly higher or comparable, which indicates that the obtained graphene provides considerable electrical conductivity for use.
The TEM image and the selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) were used to investigate graphene morphology and structure. The graphene dimensions shown in Fig. 4 (a) are about 6.5 μm × 4 μm with a wrinkled surface and are composed of 4–5 single graphene sheets, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 4 (c) also illustrates that the crystalline hexagonal structure with Bernal (AB) stacking, i.e., bright spots in a triangular geometry,61 are still preserved in graphene.
 Fig. 4  TEM observation of graphene with (a) low-magnification, (b) high- magnification, and (c) the SAED pattern (the scale bar is 2 nm−1). 
The thermal behavior of GO and graphene were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a slow heating rate (2 °C min−1) to avoid GO exfoliation during the scan.45,62Fig. 5 plots the TGA curves of GO and graphene. The main weight loss of GO is found at 200 °C–300 °C because of the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups to CO, CO2, and H2O. The weight loss between 300 and 800 °C is 12 wt%, associated with the removal of more thermal stable oxygen functionalities, and thermal decomposition of GO. In contrast, graphene exhibits a much higher thermal stability compared to GO. The weight loss of 3 wt% below 500 °C illustrates residual oxygen-containing functional groups or absorbed water on graphene. Weight loss onset occurs at 550–600 °C relative to graphene thermal decomposition and is calculated as a total of 8 wt% weight loss at 800 °C.

Thermal properties of nanocomposite conducting plates
The thermal properties were studied by investigating the thermal stability and thermal conductivity of nanocomposite CPs. As the supportable skeleton or the substrate of the operation unit, CP should possess low thermal expansion to avoid the formation of micro-pores/micro-cracks and warpage in the operation environment, which would cause the leakage of fuel or electrolyte. High thermal conductivity is also required for discharging the formation of waste heat efficiently to prevent the unit overheating and non-uniform temperature distribution. Fig. 6 shows the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and glass transition temperature (Tg) of MWCNT/VE and graphene/VE nanocomposite CPs. The CTEs of original VE composite CP below and above Tg are 49.7 and 119.2 μm m−1 °C−1. Previous research has shown that CNTs have a negative CTE value,63,64 and for graphene, it exhibits a negative in-plane CTE before 470 °C.65,66 Due to these facts, incorporating MWCNT or graphene into VE resin exhibited a significant reduction of CTE for MWCNT/VE and graphene/VE nanocomposite CPs. Especially above Tg, the mobility of polymer chains was obviously restricted by the structure of nano-carbon fillers. The result shows an interesting phenomenon, that whether below Tg or above Tg, the reduction percentage of CTE for 0.2 phr graphene/VE nanocomposite CP is 45.9% (26.9 μm m−1 °C−1) and 53.7% (55.2 μm m−1 °C−1), respectively, which shows a more significant improvement than that of the MWCNT/VE nanocomposite CP at the same loading (11.6% (43.9 μm m−1 °C−1) and 9.90% (107.4 μm m−1 °C−1)). Even the effect of CTE reduction is slightly higher than that of 1 phr of the MWCNT/VE nanocomposite CP. A previous study reported,63 for multiphase materials, the CTE of SWCNT/epoxy nanocomposite is dependent on each component phase and on the interactions between each phase. Pristine MWCNTs hold together as bundles or as entangled agglomerates, resulting in a decreased contact surface area with the resin, with a very weak interaction with the resin. Therefore, a reduction in CTE at low filler content loading is not apparent. Unlike the SWCNT/epoxy nanocomposite, graphene prepared from GO by thermal reduction is evidently functionalized (partially oxygenated).34,46 These residual functional groups enhance chemical compatibility between graphene and resin and facilitate their homogenous dispersion in resin, together with the ultra-high surface area of graphene, and provide a more effective utilization contact area to reduce the CTEs of nanocomposite CP.
 Fig. 6  Coefficient of thermal expansion of various nanocompsoite conducting plates before and after Tg and the corresponding Tgs. 
The variation of Tg of the thermoset resin is due to the two mechanisms of (i) the cross-linked network percentage of resin, influenced by carbon nanofillers, resulting in a low conversion and increased mobility of polymer chains; (ii) the embedded carbon nanofillers restrict the motion of polymer chains and reduce the mobility of these molecules.67 The balance between these two mechanisms determines whether Tg shifts upward or downward. The Tgs of MWCNT/VE nanocomposite CPs with 0.2, 0.5, and 1 phr MWCNT are 97.8, 98.3, and 101.6 °C, respectively, which are lower than that of the original VE composite CP, 101.0 °C. As MWCNT incorporates into VE, steric limitations near the interfaces and the formation of localized MWCNT clustering cause the first mechanism to dominate, causing decreased Tg temperature. With increasing MWCNT content, MWCNTs tend to form a 3D network through the resin, resulting in increased Tg with respect to the second mechanism.
These indings show that the Tg increases slightly with increasing MWCNT content. Due to high surface effects, partial oxygenation, good dispersion within resin and special wrinkled 2D topology of graphene, lead to stronger interfacial interaction with VE and thus change the Tg from 101.0 °C to 108.0 °C for the graphene/VE nanocomposite CP. Some literature68–70 indicates that graphene defects could increase reactivity or alter the absorption ability of aromatic molecules contained in both VE and the styrene monomer, the cross-linker. The literature suggests that these factors provide the possibility of grafting VE chains onto the graphene surface, hence increasing Tg.

Fig. 7 shows the thermal conductivity of composite CPs with various MWCNT contents and 0.2 phr graphene. The corresponding thermal conductivities are 18.4 W m−1 K−1 for original composite CP, 20.0 W m−1 K−1 for 0.2 phr MWCNT, 27.3 W m−1 K−1 for 0.5 phr MWCNT, 25.0 W m−1 K−1 for 1 phr MWCNT, and 27.2 W m−1 K−1 for 0.2 phr graphene nanocomposite CPs, respectively. The thermal conductivity of nanocomposite CP with MWCNT is higher than that of the original composite CP. At low MWCNT loading (0.2 phr), the lack of strong interaction between MWCNT and VE suppresses heat (phonon) transfer, limiting the improvement in thermal conductivity. The highest thermal conductivity of the MWCNT nanocomposite CP was that associated with 0.5 phr MWCNT and the related formation of a percolation network. Further loading to 1 phr MWCNT reduced the thermal conductivity owing to aggregation of MWCNTs to form bundles, which reduces the effective aspect ratio of MWCNT and increases the MWCNT/VE interfacial thermal resistance. However, for the nanocomposite CP with 0.2 phr graphene, the thermal conductivity can be increased to an extent close to that achieved using 0.5 phr MWCNT. This is because of the following features: (i) the partially functionalized two-dimensional surface of graphene provides better compatibility with the matrix and enhances the interaction between graphene and the matrix, (ii) the good dispersion of graphene preserves their high aspect ratio and higher surface area, (iii) compared to a very limited contact area of 1D MWCNT, 2D graphene sheets will have contact with each other at a larger area, and (iv) the matrix layer existing between each sheet is thinner than in the case of MWCNTs.71 Due to the above reasons, graphene enhances the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite CP more effectively, and significantly reduces thermal interfacial resistance between nanosheets and the matrix.

Mechanical property of nanocomposite conducting plates
The high electrical conductivity of composite CPs derives from their high graphite powder loading, which reduces mechanical strength. Graphene exhibits superior mechanical strength due to sp2 carbon bonding network in large 2D surface areas. Graphene sheets support the load and enhance the mechanical property in nanocomposite material more effectively than CNTs do. Fig. 8 clearly shows that the CPs with graphene additives outperform the MWCNTs. The flexural strength of graphene/VE nanocomposite CP (49.2 MPa) is not only about 75.7% higher than that of the original VE composite CP (28.0 MPa), but also significantly higher than the enhancement percentage of MWCNT/VE nanocomposite CP (19.2%) at the same 0.2 phr content. Even if obtaining comparable enhancement of flexural strength, the fraction of MWCNT loading is 2 to 5 times higher than that of graphene. To further understand the flexural strength difference between MWCNT and graphene nanocomposite CPs, 0.2 phr MWCNT and graphene VE nanocomposites were prepared respectively for investigating the morphology of fractured surfaces by SEM. Observations show an extraordinary difference in the fractured surfaces of these nanocomposites. Fig. 9 (a) and (b), indicate a smooth fragile rupture surface of the neat VE. However, the nanocomposite with pristine MWCNT shows non-uniform dispersion entangling as agglomerates (Fig. 9 (c)) and poor-adhesion with the matrix. Without modifying the atomically smooth non-reactive surface of MWCNTs, the lack of interfacial interaction or bonding with the matrix limits the load-transfer efficiency from the matrix to MWCNTs; consequently, pulling out the MWCNTs from the matrix as shown in Fig. 9 (d). By comparison, the graphene/VE nanocomposite shows good dispersion on the fractured surface and good compatibility with the matrix due to polarity interactions and hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in VE resin and partial oxygenation extended the 2D graphene surface, as shown in Fig. 9 (e). The distortions caused by oxygen functionalization, as well as the few nanometre thickness, resulted in a wrinkled, wave-like topology with nanoscale roughness.34 This unique surface texture with nanoscale roughness leads to an enhanced mechanical interlocking with the matrix.34,39,46 Because of possible grafting of VE chains on graphene, mentioned in the previous section, observations show that the graphene sheets embed in the matrix, where they are tightly held, shown in the high magnification SEM image in Fig. 9 (f). To sum up, the matrix load transfers to graphene more effectively than to MWCNT, hence, significantly improving the flexural strength of graphene/VE nanocomposite CP.

In-plane electrical conductivity of nanocomposite conducting plates
In addition to thermal properties and mechanical strength, high in-plane electrical conductivity is the most essential feature for CPs. However, polymer resin often forms a thin insulating layer around the conductive graphite powder, decreasing the effective electrical conductive pathway along the graphite powders. Therefore, the graphites only contribute to limit conductivity of the composite CP. Fig. 10 compares the in-plane electrical conductivity of original VE composite CP, MWCNT/VE, and graphene/VE nanocomposite CPs. The figure shows in-plane electrical conductivity in the order of 0.2 phr graphene > 0.5 phr MWCNT > 1 phr MWCNT > 0.2 phr MWCNT > original VE, and the corresponding electrical conductivity values (enhancement percentage with respect to original VE) are 286.4 S cm−1 (83.9%), 261.1 S cm−1 (67.7%), 233.7 S cm−1 (50.1%), 168.3 S cm−1 (8.09%), and 155.7 S cm−1, respectively. For pristine MWCNTs, in-plane electrical conductivity increases with MWCNT content at first. However, the formation of local clusters due to the lack of compatibility between MWCNTs and the matrix increases the number of filler-filler hops required to traverse a given distance, thus causing decreased in-plane electrical conductivity at a much higher MWCNT loading (1 phr). Accordingly, uniform dispersion of the nano-filler would build an efficient conductive pathway throughout the insulator polymer resin to enhance electrical conductivity. On the other hand, graphene provides a high aspect ratio in the range of 5200 to 3200 (dimensions and thickness are determined from the TEM observation in Fig. 4), high surface area, and with some oxygenated functional groups, and thus, graphene possessing these properties could homogeneously disperse in VE with a three-dimension random orientation. The TEM observation gives evidence of graphene/VE nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 (a) and (b) indicate that graphene sheets with only 0.2 phr uniformly distribute within VE as observed over the entire TEM image area. At higher magnification shown in Fig. 11 (c) and (d), the weak contrast of the wrinkled thin graphene layers, which are difficult to observe at low magnification, extend into the regions confined among more visible graphene layers. This implies a fully constructed three-dimension electrical conductive pathway throughout the VE, leading to a more in-plane electrical conductivity enhancement than that of MWCNT.

Application
To ensure that the graphene reinforced nanocomposite conducting plates developed in this study will be a promising alternative materials for application experimental polarization curves of PEMFC were investigated. Since the performance of PEMFC depends directly on the electrical conductivity of nanocomposite CP, therefore, nanocomposite CP with 0.5 phr MWCNT was selected for comparation with that of 0.2 phr graphene nanocomposite CP.

Fig. 12 plots the performance of single PEMFCs assembled with 0.2 phr graphene, 0.5 phr MWCNT, and original composite CPs. The open circuit voltages (OCV) of all of the single cells are approximately equal at 0.83 V. The maximum current densities and power densities for 0.2 phr graphene, 0.5 phr MWCNT, and original composite CPs are 2.37, 2.32, 2.06 A cm−2 and 0.788, 0.760, 0.650 W cm−2, respectively. Obviously, the nanocomposite CP with 0.2 phr graphene can enhance the current and power densities (15.0% and 21.2%, respectively) more effectively comparing to those of enhancements for nanocomposite CP with 0.5 phr MWCNT (12.6% and 16.9%, respectively). The results can be concluded from two points of view. The first is the difference between the intrinsic properties of graphene and MWCNT. Graphene is a 2-D structure with a higher surface area, higher aspect ratio, and higher nano-scale roughness than MWCNTs. The second is the compatibility with the VE matrix. Graphene that is prepared from GO contains un-removable functional groups (residual oxygen-containing functional groups), which can interact with the polar VE matrix, causing it to disperse more homogenously than MWCNT. Accordingly, more continuous electrical conducting paths, as displayed in Fig. 11, are associated with improved transfer of electrons in PEMFCs. These results reflect the fact that the performance of PEMFC can be significantly improved by incorporating only a slight loading of graphene.

Table 2 compares some properties of the composite CPs in the literature72–87 with those in this study. Nanocomposite CPs that are reinforced by graphene not only satisfy the D.O.E11,12,72,73 and commercial requirements74–76 but also exhibited more enhanced properties than achieved using other reinforcements.

Conclusions
The thermal reduction method provides a rapid and massive production route to fabricate graphene from graphite oxide for nanocomposite applications. A novel nanocomposite conducting plate (CP) reinforced with graphene at low content exhibits significant thermal, mechanical, and electrical property enhancement compared to MWCNTs. Special two-dimension topography, which includes high surface area, high aspect ratio, wrinkled structure, and partially functionalized surface provides good dispersion, strong interaction, reduced interfacial thermal resistance, and high contact area with the VE matrix. Results indicate that utilizing graphene as a reinforcement for composite CPs significantly out-performs MWCNT reinforced nanocomposite CPs with the same loading. To achieve comparable enhancement of the composite CPs, a 2–5 times higher MWCNTs content than that of graphene is required. The overall performance confirms that the graphene/VE nanocomposite CP prepared in this study is a suitable alternative material for PEMFCs, DMFCs, DSSCs counter electrode, and VRB applications with better performance/nanofiller content than MWCNT to fulfil the requirements.
