    , Accepted 31st July 2012First published on 2nd August 2012AbstractFour new ruthenium bipyridyl complexes denoted as MC103–MC106, with novel unsymmetrical bipyridines as ancillary ligands have been successfully synthesized as efficient sensitizers for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC). The spectral, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the new sensitizers have been investigated. Alkyl thiophene/alkyl bithiophene and trialkyl phenyl as substituents on ancillary ligands improved the spectral properties and hence better efficiencies of DSCs are achieved. The higher efficiencies of the new sensitizers obtained are 9.56%, 9.58%, 8.34% and 8.32%, respectively, compared to 7.2% for the standard N719 sensitizer fabricated and evaluated under similar conditions.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are attracting increased interest among scientists worldwide as less expensive alternatives for the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy.1 Among several sensitizers used for DSC fabrication,2,4,5 the classical ruthenium complex, cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II), N719 has shown a respectable η value (more than 10%).3 While one of the dicarboxybipyridines (dcbpys) serves as an anchoring ligand for efficient electronic communication with TiO2, modification of the other dcbpy of the N719 sensitizer as an ancillary ligand has been the trend to achieve better efficiencies. Efforts have been made by us and several groups to improve the spectral properties of the sensitizer by the selection of a suitable organic chromophore on the pyridyl rings of the ancillary bipyridine.2g–p,5a–h Thiophene has been extensively used in organic dyes as well as highly conjugated ancillary ligands in ruthenium sensitizers to increase the light-harvesting ability and red-shift the MLCT band.4 We have demonstrated the influence of mesityl, di-tert-butyl and/or tri-iso-propyl phenyl moieties with or without conjugation on ancillary bipyridyl ligands for improved photovoltaic parameters of DSC test cells.5c–g We also effectively utilized the coadsorbent concept for the prevention of competitive absorption by the electrolyte in a black dye based device and achieved a record DSC efficiency of 11.4% which was independently certified by AIST, Japan.6 Recently, porphyrin-sensitized devices with a cobalt(II/III) based redox electrolyte showed efficiency that exceeds 12%, the highest to date by increasing the Voc of the device by 16% over cells containing an iodide-based redox couple.7a New DSC architectures using energy relay dyes (ERD) attached to the sensitizing dyes (SD) or coadsorbed on a TiO2 surface have been invented for better light harvesting via efficient Forster resonant energy transfer from ERD to SD and the device efficiencies have been further improved by increasing the sensitizer dye loading with ERD placed within the electrolyte.8 Further to avoid the possibility of photoluminescence quenching of the ERD within the hole transporter, a light absorbing conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has been used as both an ERD and hole transporter in a novel solid-state DSC device structure.8f Improving the performance of the device without addition of a new element that would otherwise demand further optimisation is an important issue and hence N719 modification is still an attractive alternative.
As a part of our continued program on the design and synthesis of novel, efficient ruthenium sensitizers for DSC applications,5 we found that the examples of modification of the ancillary bipyridine with different chromophores on each of the two pyridyl rings are scant. Our research interest in the development of new C–C bond forming/aryl–aryl coupling reactions coupled with the demand for diverse bipyridines not only for ruthenium sensitizers but also as chelates for one electron outer-sphere redox couples such as cobalt(II/III) complexes inspired us to investigate the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted bipyridines for DSC applications.7,9 Using conventional symmetric bipyridines on ruthenium sensitizers, one can either increase the light-harvesting ability and red-shift the MLCT band by incorporating π-conjugation or improve electron donating/hole transport properties by derivatizing with a desirable chromophore, whereas the unsymmetrical bipyridine ligand concept allows the possibility of a large variety of bipyridine ligands with varied structural features as shown in Fig. 1. By careful selection of substituents on bipyridines, the properties of ruthenium sensitizers can be tuned in multi-directions such as solubility, extention of π-conjugation and electron donating/hole transport properties to enhance their efficiency of sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 without increasing the steric bulk (in symmetrical bipyridines both the moieties responsible for higher efficiency have to be appended on each pyridine) of the molecule. A similar concept can be used to bring about desirable properties in the cobalt(II/III) complexes as alternative redox electrolytes to prevent recombination in DSCs. Therefore this concept has the potential to find a one stop solution for sensitizer as well as electrolyte problems to enhance the efficiency of DSCs. However there are difficulties such as long reaction routes, formation of mixtures of products, lower yields etc., involved in the synthesis of unsymmetric bipyridines.10
 Fig. 1  Unsymmetrically substituted bipyridines. 
In this communication, we present the design and synthesis of four novel multifunctional unsymmetrically substituted ancillary bipyridine ligands L1–L4 for molecular engineering of highly efficient ruthenium sensitizers in DSC applications.
The chemical structures of the new ruthenium sensitizers denoted as MC103–MC106 that are chelated with the ancillary ligands L1–L4 respectively are shown in Fig. 2. Alkyl thiophene and trialkyl phenyl are tethered on each pyridine ring of the ligands L1 and L2 in the complexes MC103 and MC104 whereas alkyl bithiophene was tethered in place of alkyl thiophene for the ligands L3 and L4 in the complexes MC105 and MC106 for further extension of conjugation. Thus three performance increasing features are integrated in one bipyridine as the ancillary ligand. The triple advantages of these ligands are: (1) the thiophene moiety serves as the source of two double bonds in conjugation for the increasing light harvesting ability and red-shift of the MLCT band, while providing aromatic stability avoiding isomerisation (unlike in double bonds); (2) the hexyl chain provides a hydrophobic environment for the sensitizer, increases the solubility, and prevents the approach of the redox electrolyte in the vicinity of TiO2, reducing recombination; (3) the alkyl groups at two ortho and para positions of the phenyl ring facilitate electron pumping and red-shift the absorption. The new ligands L1–L4 and the corresponding Ru-complexes MC103–MC106 were successfully synthesised and fully characterised by their electronic absorption, electrochemical properties, IR, 1H NMR and mass spectra (ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Structures of new sensitizers MC103 (R = Me, n = 1); MC104 (R = iPr, n = 1); MC105 (R = Me, n = 2); MC106 (R = iPr, n = 2). 
The optical absorption characteristics of the new sensitizers measured in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent are shown in Fig. 3. All of the new sensitizers exhibited broad absorption ranging from 400 nm to above 700 nm. The high energy ligand–ligand transitions with higher extinction coefficients (εmax) corresponding to the ancillary ligands in the 400 nm region for MC105 and MC106 sensitizers compared to those of MC103 and MC104 are the result of extended conjugation arising from two thienyl moieties. This effect is also reflected in the low energy metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions where the εmax (546 nm) of MC105 is 20150 M−1 cm−1 and that of the MC106 sensitizer is 17890 M−1 cm−1 (545 nm). The sensitizers with only one thiophene moiety exhibited a blue shift in the lower energy MLCT band associated with a lower extinction coefficient. Thus, MC103 showed an absorption band at 533 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 16250 M−1 cm−1 whereas MC104 absorbed at 532 nm with an εmax value of 13800 M−1 cm−1. The electronic absorption properties, such as shift and molar extinction coefficient, of the sensitizers in solution are in accordance with the molecular structure. The simulated absorption spectra of MC103 and MC105 obtained from the theoretical calculation are in good agreement with the one obtained from experiments (Fig. S28, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of sensitizers MC103–MC106 in DMF solvent. 
The emission patterns for all of the new sensitizers MC103–MC106 match their respective absorption spectra (Fig. S26, ESI†). The fluorescence maximum of MC104 is red-shifted by 22 nm relative to MC103. The sensitizers have been screened for electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetric studies (Table 1, Fig. S27, ESI†). The lower oxidation potentials of MC104 and MC106 compared to MC103 and MC105 are because of the higher electron donating power of the isopropyl groups (compared to methyl) present in these dyes.
The ground state optimised geometry of the sensitizers MC103 and MC105 is shown in Fig. 4 where the hexyl chains have been replaced by simple methyl groups. To study the electron density distribution within the frontier and other close-lying orbitals, we report the important molecular orbital compositions (Table S4 and S5, ESI†) and the isodensity surface plots (Fig. S29 and S30, ESI†) of some selected molecular orbitals. The calculations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is centered on Ru-d orbitals and the NCS ligand, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is a π* orbital centered mainly on the anchoring ligand dicarboxybipyridine (dcbpy).

The photovoltaic performance experiments of the sensitizers MC103–MC106 compared with N719 were conducted on the test cells constructed from 0.25 cm2 active area TiO2 electrodes and a thermally stable electrolyte composed of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile. The incident monochromatic photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength for the sensitizers MC103–MC106 compared with N719 is shown in Fig. 5. The IPCE values for MC103 and MC104 are above 70% over the visible range from 380 nm to 700 nm reaching up to a maximum of 90% at 550 nm. The sensitizers MC105 and MC106 achieved a maximum of 70% IPCE values at 550 nm with above 60% in the entire visible wavelength region starting from 380 nm to 674 nm. Inspite of better light harvesting ability, the low IPCE of these sensitizers is because of low dye loading arising from the large size compared to MC103 and MC104. Though the incident photon to current conversion efficiencies are comparable, the higher efficiencies of cells fabricated from MC103 and MC104 than the N719 based cell are because of the inhibition of recombination which is also supported by the large difference in Voc values. The comparison of J–V curves for the devices constructed from MC103–MC106 sensitizers with the N719 sensitizer is shown in Fig. 6 and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are described in Table 1. The highest efficiency values of 9.56% and 9.58% were obtained for the sensitizers MC103 and MC104 with the corresponding short circuit current densities (Jsc, mA cm−2) of 18.084 and 19.023, open circuit voltages (Voc, V) of 0.729 and 0.704 and fill factors (ff) of 0.725 and 0.716, whereas the sensitizers MC105 and MC106 exhibited lower efficiencies of 8.34% and 8.32% with the corresponding Jsc (17.146, 16.786), Voc (0.670 and 0.674) and ff (0.726 and 0.736) parameters. Under similar fabrication and measurement conditions, the standard N719 exhibited Jsc, Voc and ff of 18.435 mA cm−2, 0.582 V and 0.671, respectively corresponding to overall light to electricity conversion efficiency of 7.2%.

In summary four novel unsymmetric bipyridine ligands have been designed and successfully synthesized. These multifunctional bipyridines worked as excellent ancillary ligands in ruthenium complexes for DSC applications. Alkyl thiophene tethered sensitizers perform better than the sensitizers with alkyl bithiophenes. We successfully demonstrated that by careful tailoring of bipyridine ancillary ligands, the optical properties of sensitizer can be effectively fine tuned for better light harvesting in DSCs. These bipyridine ligands also have tremendous potential for the synthesis of a great variety of recombination inhibiting cobalt(II/III) based redox electrolytes, which is in progress. This potential strategy would be a single solution for sensitizer and electrolyte problems for achieving highly efficient DSC devices.
