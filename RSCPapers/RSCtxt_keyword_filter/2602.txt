    , Accepted 25th October 2017First published on 26th October 2017AbstractFor planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs), the bottom hole transporting layer (HTL) material is crucially important, since it can greatly affect the device performance in two aspects: (1) hole collection and transportation and (2) the crystallinity of the perovskite layer formed on it. Herein, a series of catechol derivatives, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), norepinephrine (NE) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzhydrazide (DOBD), were employed as dopants in PEDOT:PSS and applied as HTLs, and the influence on performance of p–i–n Pero-SCs was systematically studied. It is found that all these three catechols can improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Pero-SCs, among which DOBD shows far better performance than the other two. Under optimized conditions, a PCE of 17.46% was achieved for the p–i–n Pero-SCs using DOBD-doped PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. The investigations on morphology, fluorescence and electrochemical impedance spectra indicate that the PCE improvement should be mainly attributed to the facilitated charge collection and transportation due to the doped HTL and the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite films. This line of research demonstrates that the easily accessible catechols can be employed as an excellent dopant in PEDOT:PSS for application as HTLs in Pero-SCs and opens a novel avenue for further improving the performance of the devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have received wide research attention in recent years due to the simple fabrication procedure, the high record power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the superior optical and electrical properties.1–5 Among the presently developed Pero-SCs, the planar p–i–n Pero-SCs are attracting plenty of attention due to the negligible hysteresis and the possibility of low temperature processing.6–11 The hole transporting layer (HTL) between ITO and perovskite thin films (Pero-TFs) can not only affect hole transportation and collection but also perovskite crystal growth on it, which are crucially important factors for Pero-SCs.12,13 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene-sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), is a commonly used HTL in p–i–n Pero-SCs due to its good hole mobility and simple solution processability;14–16 however, it was found that PEDOT:PSS is flawed mainly in two aspects. First, charge transport within the PEDOT:PSS layer is deficient, resulting in charge accumulation at the interfaces that in turn reduces the performance of Pero-SCs.17,18 Second, Pero-SCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTLs exhibit relatively low open circuit voltages (Voc < 1 V).19–21 Changing the charge transport ability and energy levels by addition of dopants into PEDOT:PSS can be a feasible method to solve the abovementioned problems.
A number of doped-PEDOT:PSS have been investigated and applied as effective HTLs (the typical dopants together with their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI†). These doped PEDOT:PSS films showed better charge transport abilities and thus can improve the PCEs of solar cells.22–36 Taking PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS as an example, Gong et al. reported that such a film showed higher conductivity and resulted in increased PCEs of Pero-SCs because of the enhanced photocurrent density (Jsc).22 In addition to the charge transport properties of the HTLs, as the bottom interlayer of p–i–n Pero-SCs, the crystal growth of Pero-TFs can also be simultaneously improved with a suitable dopant, thus further enhancing the overall device performance.
Catechol derivatives have drawn a great deal of attention in the biological field due to their reactive feature towards the oxidized surfaces. However, they are seldom addressed in optoelectronic devices.37 Very recently, Li et al.' synthesized a polymer complex by conducting the polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene in the presence of dopamine. Their results indicate that the polymer complex DA-PEDOT:PSS as a HTL can greatly enhance the PCE of the corresponding devices, and improve the stability of the devices.35
Inspired by Li's study, we would like to use catechol derivatives as dopants in commercialized PEDOT:PSS instead of adding dopamine in the polymerization process of PEDOT:PT:PSS, and see whether the simple doping can also have similar effect on the performance of Pero-SCs. For this purpose, a series of catechol derivatives, such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), norepinephrine (NE) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzhydrazide (DOBD) (the molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1), were investigated. For convenience of description, the PEDOT:PSS doped with DOPA, NE and DOBD were named DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The results indicate that, compared to neat PEDOT:PSS, the doped PEDOT:PSS showed better hole extraction ability and facilitated the crystal growth of Pero-TFs. The Pero-SCs with DOBD-PEDOT:PSS as the HTL showed far better device performance than those devices based on the other HTLs doped with DOPA or NE, and reached an optimal PCE as high as 17.46%, showing a significant enhancement compared with those using neat PEDOT:PSS as the HTL (highest PCE of 13.53%).

Results and discussion
All through this study, p–i–n Pero-SCs with the configuration of ITO/HTL/Pero-TFs/PC71BM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al was adopted. The films of PEDOT:PSS doped with different catechol derivatives were spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, such that the thickness of PEDOT:PSS was controlled to be ∼45 nm. The concentrations of DOPA, NE and DOBD in PEDOT:PSS solutions were optimized to 6, 6 and 9 mg mL−1, respectively, which were determined by the concentration dependent device performance, as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S2 in the ESI.† The Pero-TFs on the PEDOT:PSS layer were prepared by a two-step deposition method38 followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 3 min. The thicknesses of the Pero-TFs were controlled to ∼320 nm. It is worth noting that a thin layer of PC71BM (45 nm) was capped on Pero-TFs to facilitate the electron transportation, and a thin layer of BCP (8 nm) atop PC71BM was employed to block hole transportation.
The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the Pero-SCs based on different HTLs are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The devices with neat PEDOT:PSS as the HTL were taken as control, and their highest PCE obtained under our experimental conditions was 13.53% with a Voc of 0.94 V, Jsc of 20.39 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 70.9%. The average PCE analysed from 25 pieces of cells was 11.65 (±1.31)%. Upon addition of the catechol derivatives, either the highest or the average PCEs showed significant improvement. The average PCE increased to 13.68 (±0.69)%, 13.23 (±0.77)% and 16.82 (±0.54)% for the Pero-SCs based on DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Clearly, the DOBD-PEDOT:PSS led to a significant increase of PCEs, and the highest PCE obtained was 17.46% with a Voc of 1.04 V, Jsc of 21.45 mA cm−2 and FF of 78.6%. All Jsc values were confirmed by integrated current densities based on external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† In addition, the introduction of the catechol derivatives in PEDOT:PSS did not cause any observable hysteresis, which can be proved by forward- and reverse-scan J–V curves, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3 in the ESI.†

To figure out the reasons for the improvement of the device performance caused by doping of catechol derivatives in PEDOT:PSS, the crystallinity of Pero-TFs was firstly investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3, the peak intensities of the Pero-TFs on top of catechol-doped PEDOT:PSS are much higher than those of the Pero-TFs on neat PEDOT:PSS. These results indicate that the doped PEDOT:PSS should be in favour of the crystal growth of the Pero-TFs.39

An insightful study on the reasons for the enhanced crystallinity was carried out based on the morphology of the Pero-TFs and the doped PEDOT:PSS films. The morphologies of Pero-TFs on neat and doped PEDOT:PSS films were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 4, the Pero-TFs prepared on PEDOT:PSS were apparently smoother and more uniform than those on neat PEDOT:PSS. Apparently, the morphology change supports the XRD data, and implies that the doped PEDOT:PSS should result in higher device performance, in accordance with the J–V characteristics.

The sizes of the crystal grains were statistically analysed and are presented in Fig. 5. The average size of grains in Pero-TFs on neat PEDOT:PSS is approximately 226 nm, and those on DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS is approximately 380, 340 and 430 nm, respectively. Bigger grains and fewer grain boundaries will definitely reduce the carrier recombination and benefit performance improvement.40,41 These results are consistent with the tendency of the device performance indicated by the J–V characteristics.

The preceding studies have demonstrated that the crystallization of Pero-TFs and the charge dissociation and transportation are strongly correlated with the surface component and morphology of the supporting layer.12,42 The surface component of the neat/doped PEDOT:PSS was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 6a, the XPS spectra shows two major contributions of S 2p, one from PEDOT located at 167–163 eV and the other from PSS located at 171–167 eV.43,44 The ratio of these two portions in the surface can be calculated from the integrated areas of these two peaks. As shown in Table S4 in the ESI,† the ratios of PEDOT/PSS were 0.14, 0.19, 0.17 and 0.18 for the neat PEDOT:PSS and DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS films, respectively. After being doped with the catechol derivatives, the PEDOT portion at the surfaces clearly increased though to a different extent. According to the literature, the higher composition of PEDOT at the surface should promote the crystal growth of Pero-TFs, and thus consequently lead to improved device performance.34 In addition, a strong N 1s signal (Fig. 6b) appears after doping catechol, and the peak located at around 402 eV can be assigned to the presence of positively charged amine groups (e.g., –NR3+),43,45 which could also interact with lead atoms and improve the crystallization of Pero-TFs.46,47
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra of (a) S 2p and (b) N 1s neat PEDOT:PSS and DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS films. 
In addition to the XPS analysis, the doping effect can also be reflected by the morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS films. As shown by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 7, the contrast of the adhesion images was intensified, which suggests that the phase separation of the doped PEDOT:PSS films should be enhanced compared with that of the neat PEDOT:PSS films. The enhanced phase separation should be in favour of the charge collection and transportation.48
 Fig. 7  AFM adhesion images of (a) neat PEDOT:PSS and (b) DOPA-, (c) NE- and (d) DOBD-PEDOT:PSS films (scanning area, 1 × 1 μm2). 
The enhanced phase separation can also be supported by Fourier transform near infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The peak located at around 1203 cm−1 is contributed by the bonding between –SO3H and PSS. This peak shifted to 1197 cm−1 upon addition of catechol derivatives into PEDOT:PSS, implying that the bonding was disrupted.49 In this way, the interaction between the PEDOT and PSS chains is reduced, which causes the enhanced phase separation between them.
The XPS, AFM and FTIR results are consistent with each other, and prove that the doping of catechol derivatives resulted in phase separation of PEDOT and PSS. More importantly, the NR3+ groups that appear at the surface of doped PEDOT:PSS films can interact with the lead atoms and act as the crystal nucleus in the crystallization of the perovskite, which synergistically improve the quality of Pero-TFs.
In the following, in order to explain the improved Voc of Pero-SCs upon addition of the catechol derivatives, the work functions (WFs) of the neat/doped PEDOT:PSS films on ITO substrates were investigated. According to recent literature, the WFs of PEDOT:PSS would be reduced by reacting with methylamine iodide (MAI) in the deposition process of Pero-TFs.50,51 Therefore, the PEDOT:PSS films were pre-treated with adsorption and desorption of the perovskite (the perovskite was spin-coated and washed off with dimethylformamide (DMF); see the details in the Experimental section), and then the WFs were determined by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). The WFs were 4.68, 4.74, 4.70 and 4.75 eV for the neat PEDOT:PSS and DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS films, respectively. As known, the Voc of Pero-SCs is related to the difference between the WFs of the HTL and the valence band of the perovskite.52,53 As presented here, the WFs of the doped PEDOT:PSS films are relatively higher than those of the neat PEDOT:PSS, which provides a rational explanation to the improved Voc of the Pero-SCs.
The charge extraction ability of the HTLs can also be investigated by photocurrent density–effective voltage (Jph–Veff) plots. Fig. 8 presents the Jph–Veff plots in double-logarithmic coordinates. Jph is determined by the equation Jph = JL − JD, in which JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively (the corresponding curves are shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Veff is calculated from the equation Veff = Vo − V (V is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at Jph = 0).54,55 As shown in Fig. 8, the Jph firstly presented a quasi-linear increase with Veff until 0.1 V, and then reached a plateau with a further increase of Veff to 1 V. All through this detection range, the Pero-SCs with doped PEDOT:PSS demonstrated relatively higher Jph, especially in the low Veff region, reflecting the higher charge extraction efficiency of the doped PEDOT:PSS films, which makes a rational explanation for the enhanced Jsc and FF.56
 Fig. 8  Plots of Jph–Veff for devices with neat PEDOT:PSS (black, short dot) and DOPA- (red, dash dot), NE- (blue, dash) and DOBD- (green, solid) PEDOT:PSS as HTLs. 
In addition to Jph–Veff plots, the steady state photoluminescence (PL) can qualitatively indicate the charge extraction ability of the HTLs, as well. As shown in Fig. 9, the PL intensities of Pero-TFs on top of the doped PEDOT:PSS are strongly quenched in comparison with those on the neat PEDOT:PSS film. These results indicate that the hole transfer of the excitons effectively occurred between the Pero-TFs and the doped PEDOT:PSS films, which demonstrates the facilitated charge transportation between the perovskite and the cathode.57–59

The charge transfer abilities of the neat/doped PEDOT:PSS films were addressed in terms of the conductivity by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The measurement was conducted in the dark near the Voc, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 10a. The equivalence circuit shown in Fig. 10b was employed to fit the plots, and the detailed parameters are summarised in Table 2. The hemi-cycle in the high/low frequency range is ascribed to the transport resistance (Rtr) and the recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively.60 It was found that Rtr decreased dramatically from 117.8 to 35.3, 31.8, 28.6 Ω when PEDOT:PSS was doped with DOPA, NE and DOBD, respectively. Moreover, the Rrec values of Pero-SCs with neat PEDOT:PSS and DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS were 12.9, 27.3, 16.5 and 42.1 Ω, respectively. The decreased Rtr and increased Rrec suggest a facilitated transportation and a lower recombination rate of charge carriers in the Pero-SCs based on the doped PEDOT:PSS, thus resulting in a higher Jsc and FF. This is in good agreement with the photovoltaic parameters obtained from the J–V curves.61,62

Finally, the stability of the Pero-SCs with neat and doped PEDOT:PSS as HTLs was investigated with storage time. The PCEs of the Pero-SCs with DOPA-, NE- and DOBD-PEDOT:PSS as HTLs remained 39%, 43% and 47% after being stored in a glovebox for 39 days, respectively, whereas that with neat PEDOT:PSS as the HTL decayed to 28% of its initial value. The detailed photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S6 in the ESI†) showed that the PCE drop for the Pero-SCs with neat PEDOT:PSS is mainly dominated by the rapid decrease of FF. We assume that the reduced acidity and hygroscopic feature of PEDOT:PSS due to the doping of catechol derivatives should provide a reasonable explanation for the slower degradation of the Pero-SCs.
Conclusions
In this paper, a series of catechol derivatives were doped in PEDOT:PSS, which are applied as HTLs in planar p–i–n Pero-SCs. The doping led to great enhancement of device performance, especially for the Pero-SCs with DOBD-PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. The enhancement of the device performance can be attributed to two aspects: (1) formation of smoother and higher crystalline Pero-TFs induced by the increased surface components of PEDOT and NR3+ in the doped PEDOT:PSS films; (2) facilitated hole collection and transportation (verified by Jph–Veff plots, PL and EIS) due to the enhanced phase separation between PEDOT and PSS caused by addition of catechol derivatives. What is more, the stability of the Pero-SCs was also increased, which can be ascribed to the alleviated acidity of PEDOT:PSS by the catechol derivatives.
Experimental
Catechol doped PEDOT:PSS film preparation
The PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios P VP Al 4083) has a concentration of 1.3 wt%. DOPA, NE, and DOBD were added into PEDOT:PSS with a resulting concentration of 6, 6 and 9 mg mL−1, respectively. After being stirred for 8 h, the doped PEDOT:PSS solutions were filtered and spin-coated on ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s in air, and dried in a vacuum.
Device fabrication
The Pero-TFs was fabricated by a two-step deposition method. The PbI2 solution was prepared by the dissolution of PbI2 in DMF and stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. The MAI and methylamine chlorine (MACl) solutions were obtained by dissolving MAI and MACl in isopropanol with concentrations of 50 and 5 mg mL−1, respectively. The PbI2 solution was spun on ITO/PEDOT:PSS at 4500 rpm for 20 s, then a drop of mixture solution containing MAI and MACl was dropped on the centre of spin-coated wet precursor film for 30 s. The as-prepared samples were annealed at 100 °C for 3 min in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. A layer of PC71BM (7 mg mL−1 in chloroform) with a thickness of 45 nm was spin-coated on Pero-TFs at 1200 rpm for 30 s. Finally, BCP (8 nm) and Al (∼80 nm) were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The J–V curves of Pero-SCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter placed in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. The measurement was conducted under AM 1.5G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A shadow mask was attached to the substrate to define an active area of 7.57 mm2. The EQE was measured by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, QE-R3011) in air. The XRD data of Pero-TFs with neat and doped PEDOT:PSS were collected using a D2 PHASER. SEM images of Pero-TFs with neat and doped PEDOT:PSS were recorded on an S-8010 (Hitachi) with an applied acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The surface components of neat and doped PEDOT:PSS were determined by XPS (Escalab 250Xi). AFM images were captured on a MultiMode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) in peak force quantitative nanomechanical mode in air. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70 V. After deposition of Pero-TFs on neat and doped PEDOT:PSS films and being washed away by DMF, the WFs of these films were measured by KPFM in air. The PL spectra were collected on an FLS980. EIS curves were measured on an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) in the dark with a bias near the corresponding Voc of individual cells.
