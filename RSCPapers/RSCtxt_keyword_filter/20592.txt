    , Accepted 2nd October 2021First published on 4th October 2021AbstractSustainable hydrogen (H2) production via photocatalytic water splitting is considered the most promising form of energy storage, in which two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more 2D monolayer materials, have emerged as excellent H2 storage materials. Here, we have designed two-dimensional vertical ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures and estimated their electronic and optical properties and the effects of applying strain using hybrid density functional theory calculations. The energetic, dynamic and thermal stabilities were verified via the interface adhesion energy, phonon dispersion curve and molecular dynamics simulations. ZrS2(HfS2) and BiOCl are stacked through weak van der Waals forces, leading to easy growth of the heterostructures. The results show that ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures possess an intrinsic type-II band alignment that could efficiently reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers. Moreover, the in-plane biaxial strain tunes the bandgap and induces a transition from indirect to direct semiconductor. Additionally, the ZrS2/BiOCl heterostructure band alignment can straddle the water redox potential at pH 0–7. Our theoretical findings are beneficial in revealing the mechanism of enhanced photocatalysis and provide strategies to improve the performance of 2D monolayer materials in solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices.
I. Introduction
Energy storage and conversion have a significant influence on modern society's development. Because the combustion of fossil fuels causes climate change and environmental degradation, the world's reliance on non-renewable and limited fossil fuels has compelled researchers to discover alternative renewable and sustainable fuels.1 Using semiconductors for hydrogen storage and conversion, photodecomposition of water and pollutant degradation is an attractive approach in addressing environmental pollution and energy issues.2
Hydrogen produced from renewable sources is the energy carrier of the future. The water splitting process uses water and sunlight to produce oxygen and hydrogen.1 The photocatalysis process in a heterogeneous system involves light-harvesting, charge transfer and separation and the redox reaction.3 Ideally, a semiconductor photocatalyst's high activity needs enough electron reduction power on the conduction band, strong oxidation power of the hole on the valence band,4 and a bandgap energy of <2.0 eV to utilize the solar energy efficiently.5 Since narrow bandgap semiconductors can barely offer satisfactorily strong redox energy to oxidise and reduce water concurrently, finding a suitable material with appropriate visible light absorption and high water splitting efficiency is of significant interest.6
Due to their unique electronic and optical properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have received much attention.7 These properties make them promising in environmental purification, water splitting and solar cells.8 The recent promising synthesis of 2D metal sulphide has created a new class of materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).9 The 2D nature of these materials offers the flexibility of tuning their structural and electronic properties, which is difficult in pure three-dimensional materials.10 Recently, bismuth-based photocatalysts, including Bi2O3,13 BiOCl,14 BiVO4,15 Bi2WO616 and others,11–16 have extensively been used as photocatalyst materials. Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) has received high interest in photocatalysis because of its non-toxicity, cost-effectiveness, high photocatalytic activity, and high thermal and structural stability.17 Nonetheless, the wide bandgap of pure BiOCl18 leads to poor visible light activity.19 Therefore, reducing the bandgap energy and improving the redshift of the absorption intensity and edge of pure BiOCl are of much interest to achieve higher photoactivity.
To date, group VIB monolayers, such as MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te), have broadly been investigated,20 while group IVB monolayers, such as ZrX2 and HfX2, have barely been investigated but can have excellent electronic and optical properties.21 Recently, ZrS2 and HfS2 with effective charge carrier mobility have attracted wide attention in photocatalysis.22,23 ZrS2 is a semiconductor with a graphite-like layered structure. ZrS2 and HfS2 have an optimal bandgap and high potential difference to drive the OER and HER.24 However, when a single 2D material is employed as a photocatalyst for water splitting, the reduction and oxidation processes occur at the surface, potentially limiting catalysis efficiency.25,26 This can be addressed by constructing a type-II (staggered band structure) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure in which the reduction and oxidation reactions take place at separate components.27 In a type-II vdW heterostructure, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) exist in different layers, indicating the HER of the anode and the OER of the cathode are spatially separated,28 thus greatly increasing the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency.
The heterojunction structures between two components are promising for designing various hybrid materials with several functionalities, particularly in photocatalysis.29–31 The difference in chemical potentials between the layers in a heterostructure generates a built-in electric field, which improves charge carrier separation at the heterostructure interface.32 Electric field, strain, and the creation of a 2D vdW heterostructure may efficiently adjust the bandgap width and band edges, which are a research focus in photocatalysis.33–35 Higher photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the reduced band gap and various defects (vacancy, impurity and deformation),36,37 which enable visible light harvesting and offer more active sites for photo(electro)-catalysis reactions. It has been demonstrated that the physical mechanism of charge carrier transfer and separation at the interface exists.38,39 vdW heterostructures with type-II band alignments are favourable for developing highly efficient photocatalysts and photovoltaic devices. We have been inspired by various theoretical and experimental studies based on type-II heterostructures as promising photocatalysts. As such, we constructed novel 2D vertical ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures for photocatalysis applications and investigated their structural stability, electronic and optical properties, as well as strain effect using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). Moreover, strain may be used to control the electronic characteristics of the proposed heterostructures, resulting in a transition from indirect to direct bandgap semiconductors. This research could provide a new approach for the possible application of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures in solar energy conversion and new ideas for the exploitation and fabrication of photocatalyst materials with high-performance HER.
II. Computational methodology
The plane-wave DFT method implemented in the Quantum Espresso package40 with the norm-conserving pseudopotential was used to simulate the electronic properties and structural relaxation. The exchange–correlation energy was accounted for using the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.41 Since BiOCl, ZrS2 and HfS2 are stacked together by weak vdW interaction, a dispersion method by Grimme D3 with Becke–Johnson damping dispersion correction was employed in all calculations.42,43 A vacuum region of 20 Å and an artificial dipole44 were applied along the z-axis to avoid interaction between adjacent periodic images. In all the simulations, the cut-off energy for wave function and charge density was set to 50 Ry and 560 Ry, respectively. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh45 was employed to sample the Brillouin zone integrations with k-point grids of 8 × 8 × 1 for all the structures. All atoms were allowed to relax until the convergence of energy and Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom were smaller than 10−4 Ry Å−1 and 10−8 Ry, respectively, using the conjugate gradient method46 of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon. The hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional47 is considered as a more precise and widely applied method and was chosen to address the bandgap underestimation induced by the DFT-PBE method. The thermal stability of the optimized heterostructures was verified using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 300 and 800 K. The Nosé thermostat48 method was utilized to control the temperature on the conditions of the number-volume-canonical temperature ensemble for 50 ps at 1 fs time intervals. The phonon dispersion curve was studied using density functional perturbation theory,49 which is included in the Quantum Espresso program.40 We utilized the VESTA package50 for the visualization of the optimized structures and their charge density difference.
III. Results and discussion
To guarantee the accuracy of our calculations, we first compared the optimised geometry and electronic structure parameters of pure BiOCl, ZrS2 and HfS2 to previous data. Fig. 1 shows the optimised structures of pure BiOCl, ZrS2 and HfS2.
 Fig. 1  Optimised crystal structures of the top (upper panel) and side (lower panel) views of pure (a) BiOCl, (b) ZrS2 and (c) HfS2. The purple, blue, red, yellow, green and gold balls indicate Bi, Cl, O, S, Zr and Hf atoms, respectively. 
Pure BiOCl is a PbFCl-type tetragonal structure with a P4/nmm space group (Fig. 1a).51 The unit cell of BiOCl comprises the [–Cl–Bi–O–O–Bi–Cl–] layer, which is connected by [Bi2O2]2+ slabs with a lattice parameter of a = b = 3.887 Å and c = 7.354 Å.52 The [Bi2O2]2+ slab is incorporated by two slabs of chloride ions via weak vdW interactions along the z-axis.53 The negative [Cl]− and positive [Bi2O2]2+ layers induce a built-in electric field along the z-axis to improve the separation of photoexcited charges. The lattice parameters of pure BiOCl (a = b = 3.899 Å and c = 7.828 Å) agree well with the experimental lattice constant.52 The ∠Bi–O–Bi of 113.358° in the crystal structure of pure BiOCl is slightly comparable to that of 114.22° measured in other studies.54 The Bi–Cl and Bi–O bond lengths of 3.085 and 2.333 Å, respectively, are slightly comparable to those of 3.06 and 2.31 Å previously reported.54
Both ZrS2 and HfS2 have a Pm1 space group with the metals arranged in trigonal antiprismatic coordination with the sulphide atoms,55 resulting in a D3d symmetry for the transition metal sites. ZrS2 and HfS2 have hexagonal symmetry and a sandwich-like structure (Fig. 1b and c). The lattice parameters of ZrS2 (a = b = 3.669 Å and c = 6.611 Å) and HfS2 (a = b = 3.633 Å and c = 5.846 Å) are comparable to previous studies.56,57 Moreover, the bond length between Zr (Hf) and S predicted to be 2.572 Å (2.549 Å) agrees well with previous studies.58,59
As shown in Fig. 2, ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures composed of a 4 × 4 supercell of BiOCl (a = b = 15.596 Å), ZrS2 (a = b = 14.676 Å) and HfS2 (a = b = 14.532 Å). The lattice mismatches are 5.898% and 6.822% for the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures, respectively.

The vertical separations of the fully optimised heterojunctions are 3.044 and 3.062 Å for ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl vdW heterojunctions, respectively. This represents the distance separating the S atom in ZrS2(HfS2) and the O atom in the BiOCl layer. The vertical separations of the proposed heterostructures are close to other studies,60,61 which are typical distances of vdW heterostructures. The smaller vertical separation demonstrates that the interactions between the ZrS2 and BiOCl are stronger than that between the HfS2 and BiOCl.
After the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures were proposed, we first evaluated the energetic, thermal and dynamical stability. The interface adhesion energy (Eads) can determine the thermodynamic stability of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures according to the following equation: Eads = (EZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl − EZrS2(HfS2) − EBiOCl))/A(1)where EZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl, EZrS2(HfS2)and EBiOCl are the total energies of the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl, isolated ZrS2(HfS2) and BiOCl, respectively. A is the contact surface area. Our calculated Eads values of the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures are −13.06 and −29.29 meV Å−2, respectively. Such low values favour experimental exfoliation. The Eads values suggest that the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures are stable.
Moreover, the variations in the total energies of the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures after heating at 300 K and 800 K in Fig. 3a and b are small after 50 ps, confirming the high thermal stability. Moreover, the temperature fluctuation data in Fig. S1 (ESI†) are also in the small range. Moreover, the dynamic stability of the pristine and heterostructures is evaluated by calculating the phonon dispersion curve (Fig. 3c and d). The stabilities of ZrS2, HfS2 and BiOCl (see the ESI,† Fig. S2) are also verified. Interestingly, both heterostructures and their corresponding pristine monolayers have positive vibrational frequencies with the linear acoustic branch along the Γ point, thus confirming the dynamic stability. Considering the negative interface adhesion energies, smaller interlayer distance, dynamic and thermal stabilities, once ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures are fabricated, they can remain stable and robust even at 800 K.

The electronic band structures of the pristine materials and ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures are calculated using the HSE06 formalism along the path of Γ(0,0,0)–M(0.5,0,0)–K(0.667,−0.333,0)–Γ(0,0,0), as shown in Fig. 4.

The bandgap energy of pure BiOCl is comparable to the indirect bandgap previously reported.62 The VBM and CBM of pure BiOCl are located at the M and Γ points, respectively. Fig. 4b and c show the band structures of the isolated ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers, respectively. The band structures of ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers have a similar shape. The results show an indirect semiconductor nature (CBM and VBM locate at M and Γ points, respectively) for ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers with Γ-M bandgap energies of 1.931 and 1.995 eV, respectively, which agree with earlier data.60,63 From the calculated projected band structures in Fig. 4d and e, the VBM of the heterostructures mainly stem from ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers, while the CBM mostly comes from BiOCl. This indicates that the 2D ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures show intrinsic type-II band alignment, which is advantageous to the effective separation of charge carriers, thereby increasing the solar energy conversion efficiency.64–66 As shown in Fig. 4d and e, the ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures had 1.745 and 1.944 eV bandgap energies, with the CBM and VBM situated at Γ and M points, respectively. The band structures of the heterostructures are almost a superposition of those of the corresponding monolayers. Thus, the heterostructures preserve the properties of the individual monolayers with an indirect character due to the vdW interaction. Because the bandgap energies of the heterostructures are greater than the redox potential energy of water (1.23 eV), they are a promising photocatalyst in water splitting. Moreover, the reduced bandgap can make the proposed heterostructures absorb mostly sunlight and increase the lifetime of charge carriers, which favour high-efficiency optoelectronics.67
In order to evaluate the contribution of the isolated ZrS2(HfS2) and BiOCl monolayers in the heterostructures, the total density of states (TDOS) and relevant partial density of states (PDOS) are plotted in Fig. 5.

For pure BiOCl, the VBM mostly comprises Cl 3p and O 2p orbitals, while the CBM is contributed by the Bi 6p orbital (Fig. 5a), which agrees with earlier studies.68 The VBM and CBM of ZrS2(HfS2) in Fig. 5b and c mainly constitute S 3p and Zr 4d (Hf 5d) orbitals, respectively. This is in agreement with an earlier study.23,69 The CBM is dominated by the O 2p orbital, while the VBM is contributed by the S 3p orbital, resulting in the formation of type-II band alignment at the interface of ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures, which is similar to ZrS2/HfSe2,63 C2N/ZnSe,70 C2N/g-ZnO71 and HfS2/h-BN (g-C3N4)60 vdW heterostructures.
The Fermi energies of the BiOCl, ZrS2 HfS2, ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures are estimated as −2.625, −3.523, −2.729, 0.469 and 0.397 eV, respectively. Due to the interfacial interaction between ZrS2(HfS2) and BiOCl, a significant Fermi level shift of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures compared to the BiOCl and ZrS2(HfS2) exists, which can induce interfacial charge transfer. Because the ZrS2(HfS2) monolayer has a higher Fermi level, electrons will flow from the ZrS2(HfS2) monolayer to BiOCl.72 We evaluated the charge density difference to check if interfacial charge transfer occurs in ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures (Fig. 6).

The positive (yellow) and negative (blue) charge densities represent charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
Due to weak vdW interactions, charge redistribution mostly occurred in the interfaces of the heterostructures, leading to a built-in electric field, which could further facilitate the separation of charge carriers. The plane-averaged electrostatic potential (blue line) along the z-direction of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures indicates a much deeper potential of BiOCl than that of ZrS2(HfS2), see Fig. 6c and d. Moreover, the excitonic behaviour of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures differs from that of isolated layers, which can impact electron–hole pair separation.73 As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the potential drop (ΔV) of ZrS2/BiOCl is deeper than that of HfS2/BiOCl due to the difference in electronegativity of Zr (3.64) and Hf (3.80). The ΔV between BiOCl and ZrS2(HfS2) is 7.78 (2.74 eV). Moreover, we observe a large ΔV at the interface of the ZrS2/BiOCl heterostructure, which can lower the photoexcited charge carrier recombination rate and thus increases the solar energy conversion efficiency. However, when HfS2 and BiOCl are in contact, few electrons are transferred from HfS2 to BiOCl, resulting in the small ΔV. This explains the occurrence of large ΔV at the interface of ZrS2/BiOCl heterostructures, resulting in a strong electrostatic field that facilitates charge carrier transfer across the interface. Also, according to Löwdin charge population analysis,74 about 0.4 (0.1) electrons are transferred from ZrS2(HfS2) to BiOCl.
Work function (Φ) is an important parameter used in evaluating charge transfer and band alignment.75Φ can easily influence a material's surface state, thereby changing the surface electric field generated by interfacial charge carrier distribution.76 The relationship between work function and the catalytic activity23 is given as follows: Φ = Evac − EF(2)where Evac and EF are the vacuum and Fermi energy levels, respectively.

Φ is estimated as 7.469, 6.165 and 6.3 eV for BiOCl, ZrS2 and HfS2, respectively (Fig. 7). The calculated Φ values of ZrS2 and HfS2 are consistent with previous values.77 When BiOCl and ZrS2(HfS2) monolayers are in contact, electrons are expected to transfer from ZrS2(HfS2) to BiOCl at the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl interface because of the larger Φ of BiOCl. Thus, BiOCl will be positively charged, while ZrS2(HfS2) will be negatively charged due to strong electrostatic induction, which increases the power conversion efficiency.78 The calculated Φ for ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl are 5.193 and 5.584 eV, respectively (Fig. 6c and d). As given in Fig. 7, compared with the Φ of BiOCl, ZrS2 and HfS2, those of the heterostructures are decreased due to charge transfer and efficient interfacial formation.79 The low Φ suggests that electron transfer can easily occur between the VBM and CBM under light irradiation in the heterostructures.80 Generally, Φ and photocatalytic activity have an inverse relationship,23,76 which suggests that ZrS2/BiOCl has better catalytic activity than HfS2/BiOCl.

Coupling ZrS2 and HfS2 can prolong their visible light absorption edge for several wide bandgap semiconductors. The UV–visible absorption spectra as a function of wavelength of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures and the corresponding monolayers are shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Absorption spectra of BiOCl, ZrS2, HfS2, and ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures. 
For pure BiOCl, the wide bandgap limits its potential application to the UV region, while ZrS2 can absorb in a broader wavelength due to its reduced bandgap energy. The absorption intensity and edge of pure BiOCl in the UV region are because of the intrinsic electron transfer and the wider bandgap. The absorption intensity of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures prolonged to a broader wavelength region (visible light) compared with pure BiOCl and this confirmed the observed narrowed bandgap energy. Thus, coupling ZrS2 and HfS2 on BiOCl may enhance its photocatalytic performance. In comparison to the HfS2/BiOCl heterostructure, the absorption edge of the ZrS2/BiOCl heterostructure has a higher optical response in the visible light range, making it a superior photocatalyst with a promising future.
In the photocatalytic water splitting reactions, the photogenerated charge carriers result in redox reactions comparable to the electrolysis process. In this process, water molecules are oxidised and reduced by the accumulated holes and electrons to generate O2 and H2 gases, respectively. The CBM and VBM band edges are essential in semiconductor photocatalytic materials. The band edges with reference to water oxidation/reduction potentials are evaluated following the method by Nozik.81 The calculated CBM and VBM positions of BiOCl, ZrS2, HfS2 and ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures are shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  (a) Band edge positions of BiOCl, ZrS2, HfS2 and ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl with respect to the water redox potentials. The potentials of the OER and HER as a function of pH with respect to the band edge positions of the (b) ZrS2/BiOCl and (c) HfS2/BiOCl vdW heterostructure. 
Considering the influence of the pH value, the reduction and oxidation potentials are obtained from the value of the pH as:82 Eoxidationpotential = −5.67 eV + pH × 0.059 eV(3) Ereductionpotential = −4.44 eV + pH × 0.059 eV(4)At pH = 0, the standard water redox potentials for oxidation (O2/H2O) and reduction (H+/H2) are positioned at −5.67 and −4.44 eV, respectively.82,83 As given in Fig. 9a, the CBM of BiOCl is lower with reference to the H+/H2 reduction potential. Thus, it is energetically unfavourable for BiOCl to produce hydrogen. However, the band edges of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures straddle the standard redox potentials, making them promising for water splitting at pH = 0. When compared to BiOCl, ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures with proper band alignment have a high solar energy harvesting efficiency and low charge carrier recombination rate, making them efficient photocatalysts for water splitting into hydrogen using solar energy.84 Moreover, we investigated the potentials of the OER and HER to decompose water at different pH. Fig. 9b and c show the redox potential of water at different pH. By increasing the pH value, the materials tend to be favourable for reduction, while the value of oxidation further decreases. The band edge of ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures can still induce the OER and HER at pH 0 to 7 and pH 0 to 6, respectively.
Mechanical strain may dramatically alter the electronic properties of 2D materials. In-plane biaxial strain has been shown to be an efficient method for modifying the structural properties of 2D vdW heterostructures.85 The influence of biaxial strain on the electrical characteristics of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures is thoroughly investigated in this paper. The biaxial strain is applied along the a-b axis. The biaxial strain is applied by varying the lattice constants from −5% to +5%. The negative and positive strain values represent the compressive and tensile strains, respectively. The biaxial strain is evaluated as: ε = [(a − a0)/a0] × 100%,(5)where a and a0 are the optimized lattice constants with and without strain, respectively. Fig. 10a depicts the computed binding energy findings. According to the estimated binding energy, with the increase of compressive biaxial strain, ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures are relatively less stable than the untrained ones. However, when tensile strain is applied, the binding energy gradually rises, increasing the stability of the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructure over untrained ones. As a result, when compressive biaxial strain is applied, the lowest binding energy value is achieved. Furthermore, when tensile/compressive strain rises, the binding energy exhibits an increasing/decreasing trend with a nearly perfect linear form.
 Fig. 10  (a) Strain-energy curve and (b) variation of the electronic bandgap with the application of biaxial strain. 
The variation of the bandgap of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures against biaxial strain is given in Fig. 10b. The bandgaps of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures with tensile strain are all reduced. The bandgap, on the other hand, increases rapidly as the compressive strain strength increases. The bandgap of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures increases in the range of −3% to −1%, while it decreases linearly within −3% to −5%. The bandgap reduction after −3% is attributed to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition, which will be discussed later. It is also evident that the bandgap of the vdW heterostructures is sensitive to in-plane strain, progressively decreasing when the in-plane biaxial strain turns from compressive to tensile strain. A narrower bandgap is better for solar energy conversion because it requires less energy to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band.
To better understand the physical mechanism of the change in the bandgap of the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures under biaxial strain, we evaluated the band structure under compressive and tensile strains, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). Moreover, when tensile strain is applied to the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures, the VBM position remains at the M point, while the CBM is situated at the Γ point under the strain of 1% to 5%. Thus, the indirect bandgap character of the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures is maintained after applying tensile strain. Furthermore, the CBM moves from the Γ point to the M point when compressive strain is applied, whereas the VBM remains at the M point. This finding implies that a transition from indirect to direct bandgap semiconductor occurs when a compressive strain is applied. Thus, in-plane compressive strain may be used to tune an indirect to direct bandgap transition in ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures. The direct band structure tends to show excellent optical properties due to the absence of phonons, which makes them suitable for high-performance solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices. As a result, direct bandgap materials will have a high absorption coefficient as well as highly efficient electron–hole pair generation.86
The band edge positions of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures against biaxial strain are given in Fig. 11. The CBM and VBM of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures under a biaxial strain of −5% to +5% all straddle the redox potentials of water. Obviously, under tensile strain, the VBM slightly shift downward, while the CBM shift upward. However, the CBM of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures under compressive strain slightly shift downward, while the VBM shift upward. Hence, the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdW heterostructures with compressive strain are more suited for visible light absorption. Furthermore, the type-II band alignments are still preserved under compressive and tensile biaxial strain. As a result, in-plane biaxial strain has the potential to efficiently alter the electronic properties of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl vdWs heterostructures. The favourable band edge position suggests that ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures have strong tensile and compressive strain resistance for photocatalytic water splitting applications.

IV. Conclusions
Based on first-principles calculations, we explore the electronic structure, structural stability, and optical and photocatalytic response of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures. BiOCl, ZrS2, HfS2 and ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures are indirect bandgap semiconductors with a HSE06 bandgap energy of 3.347, 1.931, 1.995 and 1.745 (1.944) eV, respectively. The electronic properties of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures can be modulated by applying strain engineering. Applying compressive biaxial strain gives rise to indirect–direct bandgap transitions. The phonon spectrum and AIMD simulation show that the ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures are dynamically stable and energetically favourable at room temperature, respectively. Weak vdW interactions occur at the interface, leading to easy exfoliation of ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures. Compared to bulk BiOCl, the heterostructures have a reduced bandgap, which confirms that ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl could absorb visible light from the solar spectra. Furthermore, both heterostructures exhibit type II (staggered) band alignment, which facilitates charge carrier separation at the interface. Moreover, interfacial electron transfer results in an internal built-in potential pointing from ZrS2(HfS2) to BiOCl, which can extend a photogenerated charge carrier's lifetime. ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures show a lower Φ than the monolayers. The band edge of ZrS2/BiOCl and HfS2/BiOCl heterostructures is found to be favourable for water splitting at pH 0 to 7 and pH 0 to 6, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that ZrS2(HfS2)/BiOCl heterostructures with improved visible light absorption and suitable band edges are promising candidates for designing novel optoelectronic and solar energy conversion devices for hydrogen generation.
