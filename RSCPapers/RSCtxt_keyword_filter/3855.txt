    , Accepted 12th January 2017First published on 12th January 2017AbstractRecently, perovskite based solar cells have attracted lots of research interest, some of which is in the passivation of perovskite surfaces, particularly the heterojunction based surface passivation. In this study, the optical dynamics of MAPbBr3 single crystals with and without heterojunction passivation were studied systematically by means of a time-resolved spectroscopic technique for the first time. The emission lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals under two-photon (1064 nm) excitation is a few orders of magnitude longer than that measured under one-photon (355 nm or 532 nm) excitation. Interestingly, with surface passivation, the lifetime measured at 355 nm excitations could be tuned significantly, whereas the lifetime change under 1064 nm excitations was considerably less. Our results give a direct evidence of surface quench by comparing the lifetimes before and after surface passivation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that proper MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions can dramatically reduce the recombination channels in the surface region, which can be potentially useful for perovskite based solar cells, light emitting diodes (LED), and sensitive detectors.
Introduction
Hybrid organometal halide perovskites, due to their outstanding photovoltaic properties, have been demonstrated as a superior semiconductor material for a wide range of applications, particularly in the field of solar cells1–4 and LEDs.5–7 The latest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite thin film based solar cells has reached 22.1%, which was certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).8 The high PCE is commonly believed to be due to perovskite's superior physical and optical properties, such as high absorption coefficiency, low exciton binding energy, long carrier recombination lifetime, high mobility and, consequently, long carrier diffusion length.9–11 Among the abovementioned intrinsic physical properties, the long carrier recombination lifetime and the long diffusion length is the key success to the achieved high PCE.11–13 The longest reported carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline perovskite thin films exceeds 1 μm,9 which explains that high PCE has been achieved in solar cells thus far. However, the diffusion length of perovskite thin films could be considerably limited due to the grain boundary effects, which create trap states.14–18 Along this research field, heterojunction based surface passivation has been used to reduce the defects on perovskite thin film surface, and therefore, the PCE of solar cells could be further increased.19,20
Recently, large size hybrid perovskite single crystals have been reported to be synthesized through a simple solution method.21,22 Compared with the properties of perovskite thin films, the reported trap density of these single crystals is five orders of magnitude lower on the order of 109 cm−3 to 1010 cm−3, which is in the same order of single-crystalline Si.12,13,21 The longest reported diffusion length of single perovskite crystals is 175 μm,13 while there were different values of 10 μm12 and 50 μm23 based on different measuring techniques. These superior fundamental properties made perovskite single crystals the most promising and suitable materials for applications in photodetectors,24,25 solar cells26 and other sensitive optoelectronics, lasers and LEDs.21,27
Despite a few fundamental studies on single perovskite crystals,12,13,28 the intrinsic optical properties and photon carrier recombination processes are still unclear.22,29 For example, there is a large difference between the measured lifetimes of MAPbI3 (MA is CH3NH3+) single crystals under one-photon (UV light) and two-photon (infrared light) excitations.29 A similar phenomenon was observed by another group with different wavelength excitation measurements.23 These measured different lifetimes were basically the reason for the reported different diffusion lengths mentioned above. Notably, there has not been any detailed discussion of the carrier recombination processes regarding the surface and interior regions of the perovskite single crystals. The different lifetimes were assumed to arise due to emitters from different regions of perovskite single crystals.12,23,29 In detail, due to the high absorption coefficient, the short wavelength light can only excite the near surface region of bulk crystals, where there are generally numerous surface trap states, while the long wavelength light has a rather long incident depth and can excite the internal region of crystals with much better crystal structure and fewer defects. Although the surface quenching effect has been considered to have an important role in characterizing perovskite single crystals and the corresponding devices,24 finding direct evidence for the surface quenching effect is still of vital importance for further studying the intrinsic optical dynamic properties of perovskite single crystals, such as the excitons/carriers diffusion and recombination processes. It also has to be noted that the surface quenching effect plays a non-negligible role for device performance.24 Thus, it would be fundamental to know whether surface passivation can eliminate the surface quenching effects and improve the performances of perovskite single crystal based devices.
In order to investigate the surface quenching effects and surface passivation, heterojunctions were fabricated onto the surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals. It is expected that there would be different optical dynamics with heterojunction modifications under 355 nm or 532 nm excitations if the majority of trap states were in the surface region. In this study, we report for the first time MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 or MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions fabricated onto the surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals through a simple ion exchange method. Briefly, MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 or MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions were obtained by heating MAPbBr3 single crystals with MACl or MAI powders in a glove box, respectively. More details are given in the experimental section. Optical dynamic properties were measured under both one-photon (355 nm or 532 nm) and two-photon (1064 nm) excitations by means of a time-resolved spectroscopic technique. The measured lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals decreased after forming MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, whereas it increased with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions under one photon (355 nm or 532 nm) excitation. It has to be noted that under 355 nm excitation, the lifetime of single MAPbBr3 crystals was increased by more than an order of magnitude with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunction passivation. Comparing with the results under 355 nm excitation, the change under 1064 nm excitations was considerably small. These results gave direct evidence for the existence of surface defects even on perovskite single crystals, demonstrating an important role that surface passivation could play in the optical dynamics from a perspective of surface band alignments or energy transfer processes reported recently in mixed band gap perovskite materials.7 Given the fact that the trap density is much higher in perovskite thin films, the reported surface passivation19,20 for improving perovskite thin film based solar cells may not just be a modification of grain boundary, but also a modification of surface defects. More importantly, MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions could be a useful way to improve the performance of perovskite single crystals based devices.
Experimental
Synthetic procedures
MAPbBr3 single crystals were synthesized according to the literature published by Prof. Liu et al.21 The procedure can be described in detail: an equimolar PbBr2 and MABr were mixed at a concentration of 0.7 M at first, and the mixture was dissolved in a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent at 50 °C in ambient air. Then, the solution was heated at 100 °C on a hotplate overnight until pink coloured 1–2 mm size single crystals appeared. Afterwards, one of the as-prepared small size single crystals was used as a seed and placed into the 0.7 M PbBr2 and MABr mixture solvent for another 24 hours to produce larger size MAPbBr3 single crystals. The dimension of the MAPbBr3 single crystal used in this study is 7 mm × 7 mm × 3 mm (the dimension is shown in Fig. 1 below). As far as the fabrication of MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 or MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions on the surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals, the as-made MAPbBr3 single crystals were heated on the top of MAI or MACl powders at 140 °C in a glove box for two to five hours, as illustrated in Fig. 1 below. PbBr2 (99.999%), CH3NH3Br (99.999%), CH3NH3I (99.999%), CH3NH3Cl (99.999%) and DMF (99.9%) were purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd. All these materials were used as received without further purification.

Crystallography

Fig. 2 displays the XRD data of MAPbBr3 with MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, pure MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions. XRD data shows main peaks of MAPbBr3 (red line in Fig. 2) at 2θ = 14.9°, 30.2°, 45.9°, which confirm the cubic structure of MAPbBr3 single crystals, and this is consistent with the previously reported data.30 For MAPbBr3 single crystals with MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, the main peaks shifted to the left, while for MAPbBr3 with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, the main peaks shifted to the right. XRD data shows the characteristics of MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 single crystals, separately, and indicates a lattice space decrease from MAPbI3 to MAPbCl3.21 It has to be noted that the broad peaks for MAPbBr3 single crystals with heterojunctions is due to a mixture of the characteristics of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3/MAPbCl3.

Results and discussion
The optical dynamics of MAPbBr3 single crystals with and without heterojunctions were studied systematically. For one and two-photon excitation measurements, a 5 ns pulsed Nd: YAG laser was used as the excitation source. The diffracted emission light from the crystal surface was dispersed in a monochromater and detected by a photomultiplier. The emission spectra of MAPbBr3 single crystals, excited at both 355 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths are shown in Fig. 3 below. Under 355 nm excitation the spectrum peaks were obtained at 575 nm, which is consistent with previous reports.12,31 A 3 nm red shift was observed under 1064 nm excitation, which may be due to MAPbBr3 single crystal absorbance of the emission light from the interior region.12,32 It has to be mentioned that for the two-photon excitation measurements, a photon was emitted due to the band to band transition after absorbing two 1064 nm wavelength photons simultaneously. Fig. 3 displays the 575 nm emission decay curves of MAPbBr3 single crystals excited at both 355 nm and 1064 nm. Interestingly, the average lifetime (1754 ns) measured under 1064 nm excitation is several orders of magnitude longer than that (60.1 ns) measured under 355 nm excitation (average lifetime calculation is described in the subsection). The fitted long lifetime is normally due to the emission from the interior region of MAPbBr3 single crystals.12,23 To the best of our knowledge, although there was a report about the lifetime of MAPbI3 single crystals,29 the lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals under two-photon excitations has not been reported thus far. We note that the lifetime of MAPbBr3 under two-photon excitations was considerably longer than any previous reported value under photoluminescence or transient absorption measurements.12 In order to clarify that the difference between one and two-photon excitations was not due to the different excitation condition, the lifetime was measured under 355 nm excitation with various intensities. This data is given in the ESI.†

The photoluminescence intensity decay curve was fitted with a double exponential decay equation as follows: (1)where I(t) is the decaying intensity, A1 and A2 are the exponential pre-factors and τ1 and τ2 are the fitted decay times. The two fitted decay times are assumed to be due to different environments of the emitters (in the bulk or near the surface region) or different energy transfer processes.33 The average lifetime was determined as follows: (2)It has to be noted that all lifetimes measured in this study were fitted with the abovementioned double exponential decay eqn (1) and the average lifetime was calculated using eqn (2).
In order to reveal the surface quenching effect, MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 or MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions were fabricated onto the surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals for comparison. Due to the different band gaps between MAPbI3/MAPbCl3 and MAPbBr3 single crystals,12,21 heterojunctions could possibly be built as illustrated in Fig. 4. In detail, the conduction band of MAPbI3 was lower than that of MAPbBr3, whereas MAPbI3's valance band was higher than that of MAPbBr3's. Therefore, photon excited electrons and holes inside MAPbBr3 single crystals could likely be injected into MAPbI3 through the interface. On the contrary, compared with MAPbBr3's conduction and valance bands, MAPbCl3's conduction band was higher, but the valance band was lower. In this case, photon excited electrons and holes within MAPbBr3 single crystals were obstructed by the energy barrier. Correspondingly, with MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions the lifetime of MAPbBr3 could be much shorter compared to its intrinsic lifetime, whereas the lifetime of MAPbBr3 could be extended with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions by surface passivation.

Fig. 5 displays the measured lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals with MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, excited at 1064 nm. Interestingly, the average lifetime decreased to 1489.7 ns and 760.3 ns for MAPbBr3 single crystals that reacted with MAI for 2 and 5 h, respectively. Surface defects of perovskite single crystals were commonly neglected;29 however, our results suggested that the surface region plays a role in the optical dynamics even under two-photon excitation. Considering that the emission light is from the interior region of the bulk crystals under 1064 nm excitation, the decreased lifetime is actually an evidence of the long diffusion length inside the bulk crystal. Under 355 nm excitation, the measured lifetime (shown in the ESI†) decreased to less than 5 ns, which was outside of the instrument's capabilities. Given that the penetration depth of the 355 nm light was around a few hundred nm,34 MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions play a more important role near the surface.

Fig. 6 displays the lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, measured under the same conditions as mentioned above. As expected, there was no lifetime decrease under either one or two-photon excitations, as the generated electrons and holes inside MAPbBr3 crystals cannot overcome the energy barrier and be injected into MAPbCl3 through the interface. Under 355 nm excitation the measured lifetime increased with the reaction time between MAPbBr3 and MACl from 2 to 5 h during the heterojunction fabrication processes. Surprisingly, the average lifetime increased to 655.2 ns, as shown in Fig. 6(a), which is almost an order of magnitude longer than the intrinsic lifetime (shown in Fig. 3) of MAPbBr3 single crystals. Bear in mind that the 355 nm laser has a few hundred nm penetration depth, and therefore the long lifetime cannot be due to the emitters from the interior region of the bulk crystal. This is direct evidence of surface quenching effects. In this scenario, the MAPbCl3 layer covers the majority of the defects on the surface of the MAPbBr3 single crystals.
 Fig. 6  Lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals with MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunction (a) excited at 355 nm; (b) excited at 1064 nm (the inserted is the intensity decay during the initial 200 ns). 
Furthermore, under 1064 nm excitation, the lifetime was slightly increased from 2064 ns to 2243 ns, as the average lifetime is mainly dominated by the radiative recombination processes in the interior region, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Herein, we talk about the fast and slow lifetime components separately in order to have a clear picture of the recombination processes. The fast lifetime component of MAPbBr3 single crystals with 2 and 5 hours reaction time was 323 ns and 772 ns separately. There is an evident difference during the initial 200 ns, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b). For MAPbBr3 with 5 h reaction time, the decay is much slower. The results from the 1064 nm excitation verified the improved radiative recombination processes, and more importantly, these results further confirmed the existence of the surface defects even for a perovskite single crystal and the effective MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunction passivation.
Finally, the lifetime was also measured under 532 nm excitation with various excitation intensities, as the 532 nm wavelength could have a larger penetration depth than 355 nm, but a shorter penetration depth than 1064 nm. Unfortunately, no significant difference was observed compared with the 355 nm excitation results (shown in the ESI†). The penetration depth under 532 nm excitation is still probably too short compared with that under the 1064 nm excitations. It also has to be noted that there were spikes in the luminescent decay curves under one photon excitation, which were due to a weak intrinsic laser spike.
Conclusion
The optical dynamics of MAPbBr3 single crystals were studied comprehensively in this study, including recombination processes in the surface as well as interior regions after heterojunction based surface passivation. MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions were for the first time fabricated onto the surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals using an ion exchange method. With MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunctions, the lifetime of MAPbBr3 single crystals could be dramatically improved, particularly under one-photon excitation. This gives a direct evidence of the surface defects on MAPbBr3 single crystals. Furthermore, it demonstrates an important role that the surface defects could play and provides an alternative way for improving the performance of perovskite single crystals based devices. In addition, the optical dynamics of MAPbBr3 single crystals under two-photon excitations are reported for the first time, and to the best our knowledge, the measured lifetime of the intrinsic MAPbBr3 single crystal is the longest among the reports in the literature. Considering the revealed long internal lifetime, the reported diffusion lengths could still be underestimated. Last but not least, according to the measured lifetimes with and without heterojunctions under both one and two-photon excitations, the fast and slow lifetime components were proven to be due to emitters from surface and interior regions of perovskite single crystals. All these optical dynamic studies give a deeper understanding of recombination processes of the bulk MAPbBr3 single crystals from the perspective of both the near and interior regions and the surface passivation. It is believed that, MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 or MAPbCl3–MAPbBr3 heterojunction modifications could play an important role for some novel photovoltaic devices such as photon detectors and LEDs. This piece of study is currently being carried out in our lab, and it will be presented in another report soon.
