    , Accepted 29th June 2015First published on 30th June 2015AbstractWe report characterizations and device performance for dye-sensitized solar cells using cis- and trans-isomers of 2D–π–2A zinc porphyrins with carboxyphenyl and thienyl groups in their meso-positions. Under identical experimental conditions with similar dye loadings, we observed overall power conversion efficiencies of 2.44% and 0.88% for devices made of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A, respectively. This uneven performance among cis and trans isomers under the same experimental conditions can be rationalized with detailed investigations via spectroscopic, quantum chemical, and femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion investigations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that a small amount of electron density is localized over carboxyphenyl groups in the LUMO of cis-2S2A, but there is no electron density populated on the carboxyphenyl groups in the LUMO of trans-2S2A. The femtosecond fluorescence decay measurements revealed that the excited-state lifetime of trans-2S2A on Al2O3 is half of that of cis-2S2A on Al2O3. Moreover, the dye-to-TiO2 electron injection time of trans-2S2A is 2.54 ps, which is shorter than that of cis-2S2A/TiO2 (2.95 ps). Electrochemical impedance spectra measured under one sun illumination also revealed that the charge recombination time of cis-2S2A is longer than that of trans-2S2A. This thorough understanding of isomeric effects on the performance of porphyrins will serve as a guideline for the design of future sensitizing dyes for solar cells.
Introduction
Global warming has already had observable effects on our climate, community, and health. Hence, researchers worldwide are pursuing the ideas of harnessing renewable energy options to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.1,2 One of these renewable energy alternatives is the use of photovoltaic cells to convert solar energy into electrical energy. Among the various photovoltaic cells, recently investigated new generation solar cells known as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) composed of sensitizing dye, electrolyte, and electrodes have attracted tremendous attention.3–5 The key component of the DSSC is the photosensitizing molecule, which absorbs solar radiation and converts it into electrical energy. Porphyrins are optimal sensitizers in DSSCs due to their strong absorption in the Soret band region and moderate absorption in the Q band region. In addition, the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of zinc porphyrins match well with the requirements for dye-sensitized solar cells.6–8 Moreover, it is revealed from photo-physical measurements that the kinetics of electron injection from zinc porphyrins into the conduction band of TiO2 is indistinguishable from the reported highest efficiency ruthenium sensitizers.9 Recently, Lin and co-workers reported several zinc porphyrins with 10% efficiency, based on a push–pull type D–π–A system.10–13 A major breakthrough for the utilization of zinc porphyrin dyes was the push–pull zinc porphyrin sensitizer YD2 with a diarylamino electron-donating group and an ethynylbenzoic acid moiety serving as the electron-acceptor, which demonstrated an η value of 11% under standard illumination conditions.14 The porphyrin sensitizer YD2-o-C8 of a similar framework has demonstrated 12% efficiency under standard one sun illumination conditions combined with a cobalt electrolyte.15 The record high efficiencies of 12.75% and 13% have been achieved by D–π–A type porphyrin dyes, GY50 and SM315, respectively, when assembled with a cobalt electrolyte under standard one sun illumination.16,17 Majority of the DSSC research is focused on 1D–π–1A type porphyrins. Although it has been observed that the position and type of anchoring groups of the dye play important roles in determining the performance and stability of the device, very few examples of multi donor–acceptor porphyrins to study the orientation effects on the photovoltaic performance have been reported in literature.18,19 There are only a handful of reports in the literature using cis-/trans- isomers of zinc porphyrins as the sensitizer in DSSCs;20–26 however, detailed investigations comparing porphyrin orientations with their photovoltaic performance are still necessary. The excited-state relaxation dynamics and the interfacial charge transfer mechanisms for these cis-/trans- isomers will help understand the orientation effects of donor/acceptor groups on the DSSC performance.
Our group has been involved in the development of multi-anchor porphyrins,27–31 core-modified32,33 and expanded porphyrins34,35 for application as sensitizers in DSSCs. Our prior systematic studies of a series of meso-thienyl and carboxyphenyl substituted zinc porphyrins, namely, 3S1A, trans-2S2A, cis-2S2A, and 1S3A, elucidated significant influence of position and number of carboxyphenyl and thienyl groups on the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. We systematically studied the effects of carboxyphenyl as an anchoring group and the heavy atom effect of thiophene in zinc porphyrins on the power conversion efficiency. During these studies, we observed for the first time that devices made of structural isomers cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A (Scheme 1) under the same experimental conditions showed distinctly different photovoltaic performance. We carried out quantum chemical calculations, femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in order to understand the correlations between the isomeric structure and device performance for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A porphyrins applied in DSSCs.

Experimental section
1. Synthesis
The synthetic details and characterization data of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A have been reported elsewhere.27
2. Characterization
The absorption spectra of the porphyrins in THF were obtained using a JASCO V-670 UV-Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional (TD-DFT) calculations were performed with the GAUSSIAN 09 package to study the electron distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals and the photoexcitation transitions.36 All ground state geometries of the porphyrins studied were optimized in the gas phase by the hybrid B3LYP functional and the 6-31G basis set. The TD-DFT calculations were based on the same functional and basis set. The molecular orbitals were visualized by the ChemOffice software Chem 3D Ultra 2013.
3. Photovoltaic measurements
To characterize the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO; 30 Ω sq−1, Sinonar, Taiwan) glass (typical size 1.0 × 2.0 cm) coated with platinum nano-cluster catalyst using the thermal decomposition method was used as the cathode.37 The Pt catalyst was coated using a precursor solution composed of 5 mM solution of hexachloroplatinic acid in anhydrous isopropanol through spin-coating on the FTO glass and dried in air for 3 min. The Pt electrode was gradually heated in an oven at 360 °C for 15 min. The TiO2/porphyrin layer served as the working electrode (anode). We immersed the TiO2 coated FTO38,39 (TiO2 thickness 7 ± 0.5 μm, active area 0.4 × 0.4 cm2) in a THF solution containing trans-2S2A (1 × 10−4 M) and cis-2S2A (2 × 10−4 M) at 40 °C for 3 h. To fabricate the DSSC device, the two electrodes were assembled into a sandwich type cell, spaced, and sealed with a hot-melt film (SX1170, Solaronix, thickness 30 μm). The thin layer of electrolyte was introduced into the space between the two electrodes.40 A typical redox electrolyte contained 50 mM iodine (I2), 0.5 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.6 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.5 M dimethyl-propyl-benzimidiazole iodide (DMPII) in dry acetonitrile. Under similar conditions, the average efficiency of N719 is 7% and the fill factor is 0.71. The photocurrent and voltage curves were recorded with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5 one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) from a solar simulator (Sanei Electric XES-502S) calibrated with a Si-based reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133). The IPCE measurements were carried out with a homebuilt system, which includes a Xe lamp (PTi A-1010, 150 W), a monochromator (Dongwoo DM150i, 1200 g mm−1 blazed at 500 nm), and a source meter (Keithley 2400). A standard Si photodiode (ThorLabs FDS1010) was used as a reference to calibrate the power density of the light source at each wavelength so that the IPCE of the DSSC device could be obtained.
4. Femtosecond lifetime measurements
The dynamics of excited states of zinc porphyrins on TiO2 were measured with the fluorescence up-conversion technique. Basically, a fluorescence optically-gated (up-conversion) system (FOG100, CDP) is implemented in combination with a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Mira 900D, Coherent) pumped with a 10 W Nd:YVO4 laser (Verdi-V10, Coherent). The femtosecond laser system generates output pulses at 860 nm (or 840 nm) with duration of 120 fs at a repetition rate of 76 MHz. The frequency of the laser pulse was doubled for excitation. The residual fundamental pulse was used as an optical gate; a dichromic beam splitter was used to separate excitation and gate beams. The excitation beam intensity was appropriately attenuated, and then focused onto a 1 mm rotating cell containing either the solution or the solid thin-film samples. The femtosecond system includes two optical paths for excitation: path one is designed for measurements of thin-film samples via collection of emission from the front face, while the second path is designed for measurements of solution samples via collection of emission from the back face. The emission was collected with two parabolic mirrors and focused onto a crystal (BBO type-I); the gate pulse was also focused onto that BBO crystal for sum-frequency generation. The latter signal was collected with a lens and separated from interference light with an iris, a band-pass filter, and a double monochromator (DH10, Jobin Yvon) in combination, then detected with a photomultiplier (R1527P, Hamamatsu) connected to a computer-controlled photon-counting system. On varying the temporal delay between gate and excitation pulses via a stepping-motor translational stage, we obtained a temporal profile (transient). The polarization between pump and probe pulses was fixed at the magic angle conditions. The fluorescence transient signals were fitted through convolution of the instrument-response function with the molecular response function containing multi-exponential decay components.41
Results and discussion
Absorption spectra
The absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A were measured in THF. Although structural conformations of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A are different, Fig. 1 shows similar optical absorption wavelengths for both isomers in THF solution. The intense Soret peak is at 427 nm, and the Q(1, 0) and Q(0, 0) peaks are at 558 and 600 nm, respectively, and the extinction coefficient at the Soret peak is about twenty times more intense than that of the Q(1, 0) peak in both trans-2S2A and cis-2S2A.

The extinction coefficient of trans-2S2A is higher than that of cis-2S2A, which means that the radiative lifetime of trans-2S2A is shorter compared to that of cis-2S2A. The fluorescence spectra of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A were measured in THF by exciting at the Soret band wavelength. The fluorescence spectra of both zinc porphyrins display the same emission maxima of Q(0, 0) and Q(0, 1) bands, indicating that the fluorescence is dominantly emitted at the S1 state and the excited lifetimes for both the isomers are similar, about 1.5 ns under air. Previous investigations by our group showed that the excited state lifetime is strongly dependent on the number of thienyl groups at the meso-position controlled by the presence of a heavy atom effect. However, cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A have the same number of thienyl groups, thus allowing us to examine the orientation effect of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A under an identical heavy atom effect.
DFT and TD-DFT calculations
The molecular orbitals of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A at various energy levels are shown in Fig. 2. The distributions of electron density in HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A are mainly localized on the π orbitals of the conjugated porphyrin ring. For HOMO orbitals, some π electron density distributes onto thienyl groups of both cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A. In the LUMO and LUMO+1 of cis-2S2A, it is observed that a part of the π electron density is localized over one of the two carboxyphenyl groups; whereas, for trans-2S2A, there is no π electron density localized on any carboxyphenyl in the LUMO; and in the LUMO+1 of trans-2S2A, the electron density is located on both of the carboxyphenyl groups. This indicates that electron injections from the LUMO and LUMO+1 levels into the conduction band of TiO2 are feasible in cis-2S2A, while the excited electrons in trans-2S2A are unlikely to inject from the LUMO level into the conduction band of TiO2. As interpreted in Fig. 3 for both isomeric porphyrins, electron injections may occur from both LUMO and LUMO+1 levels for cis-2S2A but it is feasible only from the LUMO+1 level for trans-2S2A. This may be one of the reasons that accounts for the lower efficiency of the trans-2S2A device than the cis-2S2A device, for which the details will be given in the next section. Moreover, the π electrons in the two LUMO+2 levels are dominantly distributed over the carboxyphenyl groups. The electronic injections involving the LUMO+2 level may be more efficient for cis-2S2A than for trans-2S2A due to a dual anchoring mode.

 Fig. 3  Different electron density distribution in the LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A. 
The excitation energies (E) and oscillation strengths (f) of the first four singlet electronic transitions (S1–S4) of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A were obtained via the TD-DFT calculations; the corresponding results are shown in Table 1. For cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A, the four singlet electronic transitions are similar. The major compositions of these electronic transitions include HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1, and minor compositions of S3 and S4 electronic transitions include LUMO+2 and LUMO+3. The LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 show that higher π electron density localized on both carboxyphenyl groups in the S3 and S4 electronic transitions of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A might cause efficient charge separation and increase electron injection rate.

We also carried out Mullikan charge analysis for these isomeric porphyrins to understand the reasons behind the superior performance of cis-2S2A over trans-2S2A. We calculated the amount of electron density located on the carboxyphenyl anchor (CA) and the rest of the porphyrin (P) in the HOMO and LUMO and summarize them in Fig. 4. The electron density localized on CA in the LUMO of cis-2S2A is much higher than that in trans-2S2A, indicating that the charge injection probability might be higher in cis-2S2A than in trans-2S2A.

Photovoltaic characterizations
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were examined with the devices made with cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A sensitized on TiO2 in the absence of CDCA. All samples were measured under identical and controlled molecular loading conditions. To adjust to near identical absorbances for both dyes adsorbed on metal oxide (TiO2 and Al2O3) films, the concentration of cis-2S2A solution (1 × 10−4 M) was half of that of trans-2S2A (2 × 10−4 M). The J–V curves of the two devices are shown in Fig. 5; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, both JSC and VOC values are higher for the cis-2S2A device than for the trans-2S2A device. The dark J–V curves for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A (Fig. 5b) are the same. In the case of trans-2S2A, which binds to the TiO2 surface with only one anchoring unit, the distance between the triiodide and surface of TiO2 is greater. On the other hand, the distance for back electron transfer for cis-2S2A could be shorter due to the dual anchor bonding mode on TiO2. Although the length of trans-2S2A adsorbed on TiO2 is longer than that of cis-2S2A, the net shielding effect is similar for both porphyrins, as it is compensated for by the fact that the outer thienyl groups of cis-2S2A have more negative charge on the sulfur atom to repel I3− and therefore decrease the back electron transfer. Overall, although the position of the anchoring groups in cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A alters the photovoltaic performance, it does not change the dark current density under similar dye-loadings.
In order to realize the current density at short-circuit, we measured the IPCE action spectra of the cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A devices under similar dye loadings; the results are shown in Fig. 6. From the IPCE spectra, we noticed that the quantum efficiency of photon-induced electron transfer at the Soret band is more effective than at the Q band. The IPCE values of all excitation wavelengths are significantly greater for cis-2S2A than for trans-2S2A. The efficiency of photo-current generation is dependent on three components: the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (ϕinj) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc). The IPCE value at each wavelength is given by the product of the three efficiencies as:IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × ϕinj(λ) × ηcc(λ)Under similar dye loadings on TiO2 films confirmed by the absorption spectra of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A, the major factors to determine the IPCE values of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A should be ϕinj and ηcc. Therefore, we conclude that the product ϕinj × ηcc is higher for cis-2S2A than for trans-2S2A. Moreover, both samples showed three times higher photocurrent density under short-circuit at the Soret band than at the Q bands. This result is attributed to better overlapping between the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 orbitals of the porphyrins and the CB of TiO2 when both molecules were excited at the wavelengths of the Soret band. The inset of Fig. 6 shows that the IPCE at the Q band region for cis-2S2A is greater than for trans-2S2A. The higher IPCE of cis-2S2A could be due to either the dual anchoring groups, which could increase the interfacial electron transfer process or the non-bonding anchoring group of trans-2S2A, which could decrease the efficiency of the electron injection process.

Femtosecond fluorescence decay measurements
Femtosecond fluorescence transients of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A on Al2O3 and TiO2 films are displayed in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively, with the excitation at 430 nm and the probe at 610 nm. The band edge of the conduction band of Al2O3 is higher than the S2 and S1 states of zinc porphyrins, which prohibits the interfacial electron transfer from the excited porphyrins to Al2O3. Thus, the measurements of zinc porphyrins on Al2O3 film simply reflect the excited-state relaxation dynamics of the porphyrin itself. On the other hand, the fluorescence transient of zinc porphyrins on TiO2 involves not only the excited-state relaxation process but also the interfacial electron transfer from the excited porphyrin to the conduction band of TiO2. In order to obtain the yields of the electron injection, we measured the fluorescence decay times for both cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A porphyrins adsorbed on Al2O3 (τAl2O3) and TiO2 (τTiO2) films. All fluorescence transients were fitted by an appropriate kinetic model with multi-exponential decay functions. The average fluorescence decay lifetime of a zinc porphyrin on Al2O3 film (τAl2O3) can be dominated by the excited-state relaxation and an intermolecular aggregation quenching effect, while the average fluorescence decay lifetime of zinc porphyrin on TiO2 film (τTiO2) involves additional relaxation due to the interfacial electron transfer. From these two time coefficients, the time of interfacial electron injection (τinj) and the quantum yield of interfacial electron injection (ϕinj) can be expressed as42 (1) (2)The obtained interfacial electron injection times and quantum yields of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A are listed in Table 3. According to the results obtained from the femtosecond fluorescence decay measurements, the electron injection rates of both cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A are comparable. The factor influencing the yield of interfacial electron transfer will be the excited-state relaxation of zinc porphyrins on the nanoparticles of Al2O3 or TiO2.

Although the excited-state lifetimes for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A in THF are similar (1.5 ns), the excited-state lifetime of trans-2S2A on Al2O3 film is one half that of cis-2S2A. The shorter excited-state lifetime can be ascribed to the effective aggregation quenching among trans-2S2A molecules on Al2O3. The effective intermolecular aggregation quenching of trans-2S2A on nanoparticle colloid surfaces could be mainly attributed to a shorter intermolecular distance for trans-2S2A than for cis-2S2A, because trans-2S2A molecule has a free non-bonding carboxyl group, which can induce intermolecular hydrogen bonding on the surface.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under one sun condition
In general, VOC is determined by the potential difference between the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO level of redox couples (Eredox) in the electrolyte, which could be described by the following equation:43,44  where γ is a characteristic constant of the TiO2 tailing states, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, and NCB is the effective electron density of the states at the TiO2 conduction band edge. In the same electrolyte, the VOC of a zinc porphyrin sensitized solar cell is dependent on the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 under the same Eredox. In addition, the number of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band is determined by the balance between electron injection and charge recombination, which influences the quasi Fermi level in TiO2. The higher VOC of cis-2S2A than trans-2S2A is attributed to the larger number of electrons with high effective interfacial electron injection yield. However, not only the interfacial electron transfer yield, but also the rate of charge recombination between electrons in TiO2 and redox couples in electrolyte can affect the VOC. Therefore, the value of VOC is closely related to the surface charge and charge recombination. As a consequence, the influence of zinc porphyrin on VOC has mostly been attributed to the electron lifetime under illuminated open circuit voltage, which is related to several factors such as the molecular bonding orientations and the position of substituents.
EIS is a powerful technique for characterizing the important interfacial charge transfer and carrier transportation process in DSSCs. In order to realize the lifetime of electrons in TiO2 under VOC conditions, we measured the EIS of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A under AM 1.5 solar illumination. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots for DSSCs based on cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A under VOC and AM 1.5 G illumination conditions. The EIS data were analyzed with equivalent circuit model consisting of dye-TiO2/electrolyte interface and electrolyte/Pt-TCO interface with Z-view program. The analyzed results of EIS are summarized in Table 4 and indicate that the electron lifetime of 7.2 ms for cis-2S2A is longer than that of 4.2 ms for trans-2S2A, and the lifetimes of regeneration redox with Pt-TCO are about 0.2 ms for both cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A molecules.

The electron lifetime is related to the product of resistance of charge recombination (Rrec) and capacitance (CPE) between the TiO2 and electrolyte interfaces. The longer electron lifetime of cis-2S2A is mostly attributed to the large CPE value, which means electron density in TiO2 is higher for cis-2S2A under VOC conditions. However, the EIS results reveal that the resistance of charge recombination of cis-2S2A (56.3 Ω) is smaller than that of trans-2S2A (110.2 Ω). The difference of charge recombination resistances for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A is attributed to the orientation of dyes on TiO2. The adsorbing molecules on TiO2 can protect electrons from recombining with triiodide in the electrolyte near the interface. A larger size and a longer alkyl chain of dyes can increase the resistance of charge recombination. Therefore, the Rrec of trans-2S2A is larger than that of cis-2S2A as the distance between the surface of the TiO2 and I3− close to the surface of trans-2S2A is longer because trans-2S2A is bound on the TiO2 using a single carboxyphenyl group. Fig. 9(b) shows the Bode plots of DSSCs based on cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A under AM 1.5 G solar illumination conditions. The Bode phase plots of both cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A exhibits a broad single peak from 10 to 10000 Hz. In general, the electron lifetime (τn) can be estimated from the frequency peak (fp) as follows.45,46  The frequency peak of the DSSC based on cis-2S2A shifts to a lower frequency with respect to the DSSC based on trans-2S2A. The electron lifetimes under VOC conditions estimated by Fig. 9(b) are 0.51 and 0.29 ms for cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A, respectively. The values of electron lifetime calculated from Bode plots are smaller than those calculated by fitting with equivalent circuits caused by the broadened peaks, which could be a combination of two frequency peaks from the charge recombination and charge transport from platinum.
EIS measurements under dark conditions
The electronic processes in DSSCs were well described by the transmission line model shown in Scheme 2. The equivalent circuit elements have the following meaning: RS is the series resistance; RCO and CCO are charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance at the TCO/electrolyte interface, respectively; Rt and Rrec are electron transport through the TiO2 nanoparticles and charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively; and Cμ is the chemical capacitance of TiO2.
 Scheme 2  Transmission line model of electronic processes in DSSCs. 

Fig. 10(a) shows Nyquist plots of cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A sensitized solar cells with applied potential of 600 mV in dark conditions, and Fig. 10(b) shows the chemical capacitance of TiO2 based on cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A as a function of applied potential in dark conditions. Based on the analysis of dark Nyquist plots with the transmission line model, the charge recombination resistance (690 Ω) of cis-2S2A is smaller than Rrec (929 Ω) of trans-2S2A. However, the chemical potential of cis-2S2A is larger than trans-2S2A under reversed applied voltage. The smaller Rrec indicates an inefficient molecular shielding of cis-2S2A, which might be attributed to the charge recombination in cis-2S2A, containing exposed thienyl groups. For trans-2S2A, the two thienyl substitutes are not as boldly exposed to the electrolyte due to its dense packing on the TiO2 surface after adsorption giving higher recombination resistance. It is noticeable that Fig. 10(b) shows larger chemical capacitances for cis-2S2A/TiO2 than that of trans-2S2A/TiO2. It indicates that the electron densities of states of TiO2 can be affected by the orientation of isomeric sensitizers on TiO2. When cis-2S2A and trans-2S2A adsorb on the TiO2 surface, the distance between electrolyte and TiO2 surface for trans-2S2A is longer than cis-2S2A due to the different binding mode on TiO2 surface. The steric hindrance due to the sensitized porphyrins on TiO2 could inhibit lithium ions from reaching the surface of TiO2, so the longer distance of trans-2S2A on TiO2 might decrease the density of states of TiO2, which increases the voltage on TiO2 under the same amount of injected electrons. The population of densities of states (DOS) on TiO2 is mainly influenced by the concentration of lithium ions on the surface, which interact with electrons on TiO2, so the molecular orientation of trans-2S2A decreases the concentration of surface lithium ions.

Conclusions
We report results from quantum chemical calculations, femtosecond fluorescence decay and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements to rationalize the photovoltaic performances of devices fabricated using the cis- and trans- isomers of a model zinc porphyrin system. The DFT calculations revealed that in the LUMO of cis-2S2A, a small amount of electron density is localized over one carboxyphenyl group, whereas in case of the trans-2S2A there is no electron density on the anchoring carboxyphenyl. Due to the dual anchoring mode of the cis isomer, there is a chance of increased electron injection involving the LUMO orbital and higher excited states, whereas in the trans isomer, the electron injection is feasible only through the higher excited states. This observation is well supported by Mullikan charge analysis. From femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements, we observed that the excited-state lifetime of cis-2S2A on Al2O3 is twice as long as that of trans-2S2A on Al2O3. Moreover, the electron injection time for cis-2S2A is longer than that for trans-2S2A. Electrochemical impedance measurements under one sun illumination also reveal that the charge recombination time of cis-2S2A is longer than that of trans-2S2A. Collectively, superior electron injection, longer excited-state lifetime, and higher electron injection yield are responsible for the photovoltaic performance of the cis-2S2A device being greater than that of its trans-2S2A counterpart. This thorough study will be an important guideline for the development of future dual anchoring porphyrin dyes for DSSCs.
