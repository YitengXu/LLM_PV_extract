    , Accepted 16th October 2014First published on 17th October 2014AbstractWe introduce a novel colloidal quantum dot solar cell (CQD SC) architecture, defined as inverted Schottky CQD SCs, which consists of a thin film of PbS CQDs sandwiched between a low-work-function, transparent conducting oxide (Lϕ-TCO) and a high-work-function metal anode. On Lϕ-TCO substrates, which were generated by coating a thin layer of polyethylenimine (PEI) onto FTO, a series of inverted Schottky CQD SCs with varied PbS CQD sizes and QD layer thicknesses were fabricated and characterized using capacitance–voltage (C–V), current–voltage (J–V), and external quantum efficiency (EQE). A Schottky junction, of about 180 nm in width, was formed at the front TCO contact, resulting in an EQE of approximately 70% in the short-wavelength region. The champion device reached 3.8% AM1.5 in power conversion efficiency, and retained efficiency over several weeks of air-exposure. A record open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.75 V was achieved by employing PbS CQDs of 1.56 eV in the bandgap. Advantages including the simple device structure, efficient carrier extraction, and air-stability demonstrated in this study suggest that inverted Schottky CQD SCs can reduce the price per Watt ratio and facilitate the development of CQD tandem solar cells.
Introduction
Lead chalcogenide PbX (X = S or Se) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been intensively investigated as light harvesters for next generation solar cells (SCs) due to their simple synthetic schemes, the tunability of the absorption edge, and ability to fabricate large-scale solar panels, and especially due to the carrier multiplication originating from a potential efficiency boost.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CQD SCs reached 8.6%,5 and is expected to exceed 10% in single or 15% in tandem cells.6 According to the device architecture, three primary types of CQD SCs exist, including (i) CQD sensitized solar cells (QD-SSCs),7–9 (ii) Schottky CQD SCs,10–15 and (iii) p–n junction (PNJ) CQD SCs.16–18 In the QD-SSCs, individual CQDs are used to replace organic dye molecules in DSSCs and PCEs greater than 5% have been reported.8,9 In the others, solid assemblies of CQDs are used and regarded as conventional p-type semiconductors. Photogenerated electrons and holes within the QD layer are separated by a built-in electric field formed at the low-work-function (Lϕ) metal (in the Schottky SCs) or n-type semiconductor (in the BHJ SCs) contacts. Despite the simplicity in the device configuration, providing a platform for investigating the CQD film without complication caused by other layers,19 and recent developments in device performance,11,12,20 the Schottky CQD SCs have several disadvantages. First, the performance of Schottky CQD SCs decreases quickly in air because Lϕ-metals are easily oxidized.20,21 Second, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is low due to the Fermi-level pinning at the metal–QD layer contact.13,14 Most importantly, in the Schottky CQD SCs the junction is formed at the back Lϕ-metal contact opposite from the TCO front side where the rate of carrier generation is higher than elsewhere. Minority carriers (electrons) may recombine before reaching the top cathode in thick devices where a quasi-neutral or even a dead zone is present at the TCO contact.22,23 To overcome drawbacks from the back junction scheme, a PNJ structure, such as TCO/n-type TiO2 or ZnO/p-type PbX QD film/Au,16,24 was proposed because the oxide layer creates a depletion region at the front of the QD layer where photogenerated carriers are enriched.25 Consequently, the EQE (external quantum efficiency) exceeding unity and most of the high-performance SCs have been realized only in PNJ structures.3,17,26 PNJ-CQD SCs are also known for their air-stability originating from the high-work-function (Hϕ) metal top anode.24 However, PNJ-CQD SCs typically require cost-ineffective, high-temperature treatment of the oxide layer, which is not suitable to construct QD tandem SCs because of the thermal instability of PbX CQDs.27,28 Furthermore, with regard to the QD layer the p–n junction requires fine control over the doping density, interfacial trapping density, and energy alignment, which remains challenging.29–31
In this study, we successfully moved the junction from back to front by simply lowering the work-function of TCO. Our proposed device architecture was defined as inverted Schottky CQD SCs consisting of a p-layer of CQDs sandwiched between an Lϕ-TCO cathode and an Hϕ-metal anode. A Schottky junction formed at the Lϕ-TCO contact takes the advantage of PNJ SCs in the carrier extraction while maintaining the simplicity of device fabrication of conventional Schottky SCs. We first confirmed the feasibility of this concept using SCAP simulations,32,33 whereby both the JSC (short-circuit current density) and EQE increased by interchanging the metal and TCO work-function, (ESI, Fig. S1†). A series of inverted Schottky SCs were then fabricated having a common structure Lϕ-FTO/PbS CQD/MoOx/Au–Ag with varied QD sizes and PbS thicknesses. VOC scales linearly with the bandgap of QDs and a record value of 0.75 (V) was achieved using small PbS CQDs with a bandgap of 1.56 eV. The devices have a Schottky junction with a depletion width of about 180 nm formed at the Lϕ-FTO contact, giving rise to an EQE of approximately 70% in the short-wavelength region. The champion device yielded a PCE of 3.8% with enhanced air-stability under AM1.5 illumination.
Results and discussion
An important factor limiting the performance of CQD SCs is the short diffusion length originating from a high density of surface trap states (∼1017 cm−3).26,34 As a result, the thickness of the QD layer is limited approximately to the width of the depletion region, of about 150 nm in normal Schottky or 240 nm in PNJ junction solar cells.7 Therefore, we need to increase our understanding of the transport mechanism in QD solids to improve the diffusion length19,27,28 and engineer the QD bandgap (Eg) into multiple absorption layers such as quantum junctions,35 or tandem structures,36 as well as to modify the device architecture to increase light absorption on a single QD layer and increase the performance of CQD SCs.37
The solar cell performance is directly proportional to the rate of carrier generation within the active layer and how efficiently the photocarriers are extracted to the corresponding electrodes. The latter factor is primarily determined based on the electrostatic potential profile across the active layer. Fig. 1 shows the influence of inverting the Schottky junction on carrier extractability. The colored background indices the rate of carrier generation, G(x,λ), within a 200 nm thick layer of PbS CQDs (Eg = 1.35 eV) upon a double-pass excitation by different wavelengths (λ, left y-axis) according to eqn (1).23,25 In eqn (1), Tλ, αλ, Φλ, and d (=200 nm) are the transmittance of the front TCO, the absorption coefficient of the PbS QD layer, the photon flux of the simulated AM1.5 solar spectrum at λ, and the thickness of the PbS QD layer, respectively. These values and the total integrated carrier generation rate are shown in Fig. S2 (in the ESI†). In addition, Fig. 1 shows the energy diagrams for a normal and inverted Schottky cell, which are sketched with assumptions that the devices have 150 nm wide depletion regions,22 and the work-function of TCO in the inverted structure equals the metal work-function in the normal structure and vice versa. G(x,λ) = TλαλΦλ[e−αλx + eαλ(x−2d)](1)
 Fig. 1  Calculated rate of carrier generation in the 200 nm thick PbS QD (Eg = 1.34 eV) layer excited by incoming light through TCO and light absolutely reflected at the back metal electrode. Inset: electrostatic potential energy for inverted (solid line) and normal (dashed line) Schottky devices with a 150 nm wide depletion region. 

Fig. 1 shows that short-wavelength light (λ < 600 nm) is absorbed near the TCO side and that carriers are generated in this region faster than elsewhere. Similar to the PNJ SCs,25 this carrier-rich region is always depleted in the inverted Schottky devices, while it is opposite to the junction in the normal structure. The minority carriers generated near the TCO side drifted to the Lϕ-TCO cathode but were easily lost upon recombination or trapping during the diffusion process in normal Schottky cells. Theoretically, by inverting the junction the PCE could increase from 3.4% to 5.4%, which is comparable with that of PNJ-SCs, as shown in Fig. S1 (in ESI†).
Based on the above considerations, we fabricated a series of SCs with a common structure Lϕ-FTO/PbS CQD/Hϕ-metal, which is defined as inverted Schottky CQD SCs in this article. Herein, PEI, whose chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2(a), was used to control the work-function of FTO because it is a cheap, solution-processable, and effective polyelectrolyte.38 The work-function of PEI coated FTO, denoted as Lϕ-FTO, was reported to be 3.6 eV,38 which is comparable with Ca or Mg work-functions.14 The optimal thickness of the PEI layer on the performance of inverted Schottky SCs was found to be about 3 nm, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (in the ESI†). PbS CQDs with a Eg ranging from 1.19 to 1.56 eV were synthesized as reported previously.39 Their UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are shown in Fig. S5 (in ESI†). The Eg was calculated from the position of the PL peak.13 The layers of PbS CQDs were spin-coated by a layer-by-layer procedure using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) as a cross-linking ligand on the as-prepared Lϕ-FTO substrate,20 and the thickness of the QD layer was controlled by repeating the coating cycle, as shown in Fig. S3 (in the ESI†). Notably, this QD coating step did not affect the PEI layer based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, in which the XPS spectra of PEI on FTO with or without treatment with EDT solution in acetonitrile were identical, as shown in Fig. S6 (in the ESI†). Finally, 10 nm thick MoOx and 80 nm thick Au–Ag alloys were sequentially vacuum-deposited on the top of the PbS CQD layer to complete the solar cells. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the schematic structure and cross-sectional SEM image of an inverted Schottky CQD SC. The MoOx layer was added to prevent the Fermi level of the Hϕ-metal from pinning upon direct contact with the QD layer and to block electrons and transport holes.14,17 Using the same PbS CQD sample, normal Schottky SCs in an ITO/EDT-treated PbS CQD/LiF–Al were also fabricated for comparison. Fig. S7 (in the ESI†) shows the effects of the PbS CQD thickness (d) on device performance under simulated AM1.5 illumination. In the inverted structure, the JSC increased monotonically with d, mainly due to increased light absorption, and peaked at a 200 nm thickness before decreasing slightly, while the VOC and FF (fill-factor) did not change significantly at d ≥ 100 nm. Consequently, the PCE peaked at approximately 3.5% when the d was 200 nm. For normal structures, the optimal d was 150 nm, corresponding to a PCE of 3.3%. Thickening the device, d > 150 nm, induces a rapid decrease in JSC from the formation of a quasi-neutral region at the ITO contact, which was supported by the observation that EQE was lost in the short-wavelength region in a 200 nm thick device, as shown by the blue curve in Fig. 2(d).

(d) The EQE of an inverted and a normal Schottky solar cell with a 200 nm thick PbS QD layer. The structure of a normal Schottky cell is ITO/PbS CQD/LiF–Al. A UV-vis absorption spectrum of the corresponding PbS CQDs is inserted and scaled with the right y-axis. Inset: J–V curves of the devices on a semilogarithmic scale. These devices yield 3.0% (inverted) and 2.3% (normal) PCE under simulated AM1.5 illumination. (e) The energy band diagram for the inverted Schottky device under open-circuit conditions. Carriers generated in the PbS layer are separated by a Schottky junction formed at the front FTO contact. Electrons tunnel through an ∼3 nm thick PEI layer to the Lϕ-FTO cathode while holes move to the Au–Ag anode via trap states of MoOx. 
The band diagram under open-circuit conditions of the inverted Schottky SCs is shown in Fig. 2(e). The energy levels were determined in previous reports.14,17,38 A Schottky junction formed at the Lϕ-FTO contact separated carriers photogenerated in the PbS CQD layer. Electrons tunnel to the Lϕ-FTO cathode through a thin PEI barrier, whose height is assumed to be 3.4 eV, following drifting by the junction. Holes move to the Hϕ-metal anode through trap states of the MoOx layer, as reported for PNJ-CQD SCs.17
Photogenerated carriers are thought to be separated by a Schottky junction at the Lϕ-FTO contact, as shown in Fig. 2(e). First, if the junction is at the front of the PbS CQD layer (which is supported by Fig. 1), the short-wavelength region of the solar spectrum is effectively harvested, even in thick devices. Fig. 2(d) shows the EQE spectra of inverted and normal Schottky cells, both having 200 nm thick PbS CQD layers (Eg = 1.35 eV). The J–V curves of these devices and the absorption profile of the used PbS CQDs are also shown. Both devices feature the first excitonic peak, as seen in the absorption profile, and yield comparable EQEs with λ ≥ 560 nm. However, while the short-wavelength light (λ ∼ 420 nm) was poorly utilized in the normal cell since the photogenerated carriers localize mostly at the front, opposite to the junction (Fig. 1), EQE increased in the inverted cell, which indicated that the inverted cell had a front junction. Notably, an EQE of about 70% obtained in the inverted cell is comparable with that of the best normal Schottky cell.11
Additional data supporting the Schottky junction as shown in Fig. 2(e) indicate that VOC scales linearly with the energy gap (Eg) of PbS CQDs as: VOC = 554.98(Eg/q) − 146.38, where q is the elemental charge, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Physically, the VOC of a Schottky cell is proportional to the barrier height (−qϕb), which equals Eg − q(ϕm − χ), where χ and ϕm are the electron affinity of a p-type semiconductor and metal work-function, respectively.14 The increasing trend observed in Fig. 3(a) is similar to normal Schottky CQD SCs13,14,20 and is attributable to the quantum confinement effect that lowers the valence band energy level at increasing Eg.40

All devices had a 200 nm thick PbS QD layer. The gray line with the inserted equation is a least-squares fit to the experimental data. (b) Capacitance–voltage characterization of devices with 80 ± 10, 200 ± 20, and 350 ± 25 nm thick PbS QD (Eg = 1.28 eV). (c) J–V characteristics of the 200 nm thick device under dark and simulated AM1.5 illumination. Photocurrent (Jphoto = Jlight − Jdark) equals to zero at a compensation voltage of 0.56 V. 
In addition to the above linear dependence, we observed that by using the same PbS CQD sample VOC was always higher by 70–200 meV in the inverted cells when compared with the normal Schottky cells, as shown in Fig. S8(a) (in the ESI†). High VOC yielded in the present cells may be attributable to the lower dark-saturation current (Jo = Jo,minor + Jo,major, see dotted curves in the inset of Fig. 2(d)) induced by the insulating PEI layer according to eqn (2), where n, k, T, q, and JSC are the ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, temperature, charge of an electron, and short-circuit current density, respectively.13 Herein, the PEI layer is sufficiently thin (about 3 nm) and does not reduce JSC while effectively reducing J0 by suppressing both the electron injection current (Jo,minor) and thermo emission current of the hole (Jo,major) and is established in the mature metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) Schottky SCs.41 (2)
Additionally, the PEI layer can remove the Fermi energy level pinning effect, to which the lower VOC of the normal Schottky devices is widely attributed. The highest VOC of 0.75 V was obtained on devices using 1.56 eV bandgap-PbS CQDs, as shown in Fig. S8(b) (in the ESI†), which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value ever reported for QD solar cells.
Finally, capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were conducted to analyze the Schottky junction as shown in Fig. 2(e). Fig. 3(b) shows the C–V curves obtained on devices with different PbS CQD layer thicknesses. The two thick devices (200 nm and 350 nm) showed a more similar capacitance at zero bias than the thin cell (80 nm). We assumed that the thinnest device was fully depleted; the dielectric constant (ε) of the PbS CQD layer was then calculated to be 17 ± 2 using eqn (3), where εo, W, A, and Co represent the permittivity of the vacuum, the width of the depletion region (taken to be the PbS QD thickness, of 80 ± 10 nm), the area of the electrode, and the capacitance at zero voltage, respectively. By inserting this ε and Co obtained from Fig. 3(b) into eqn (3), the depletion width in the thick devices was 180 ± 18 nm. This value was consistent with the above assumption that the thinnest device was fully depleted, with an optimal PbS CQD thickness, as shown in Fig. S7 (in the ESI†), of 200 ± 20 nm. CoW = εεoA(3) (4)
Additionally, we calculated the doping density (NA) of the PbS QD layer according to eqn (4), in which Vbi is the built-in potential of a Schottky junction that can be measured from the J–V curve, as shown in Fig. 3(c) (Vbi equals 0.56 V). The acceptor density was about 3.36 ± 0.33 × 1016 cm−3, which is in agreement with previous reports for EDT treated PbS CQD solids.6,13,30,31
CQD SCs are expected to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit42 due to their ability to generate multiple electron–hole pairs by absorption of one high-energy photon, which is known as carrier multiplication (CM).4 CM has been demonstrated for various CQDs, QD solids, and QD solar cells,3 and typically exhibits a threshold photon energy of three to four times the QD energy gap. Devices such as conventional PNJ SCs and the inverted Schottky SCs demonstrated herein that can efficiently utilize the short-wavelength region of the solar spectrum are very promising for the use of CM. Additionally, the simplicity in controlling the absorption edge of CQDs, ranging from the visible to the near-infrared region,37 allows for the engineering of size-tuned CQDs in tandem structures to boost the power conversion efficiencies.36,43 During the fabrication of CQD tandem SCs, depositing a recombination layer on the bottom cell is difficult because of the thermal-instability of CQDs.27,28 However, inverted Schottky SCs made in solution and low-temperature-processed Lϕ-TCO38 presented here are a suitable structure for this purpose.
For the application of CQD SCs, improving their air-stability is important, which can be accomplished by modifying the surface of the CQDs26 using small PbS CQDs,39 covering the cell with an additional air-stable metal,21 or using air-stable Lϕ-electrodes. To this end, the inverted Schottky SCs have benefits over the normal Schottky devices. As shown in Fig. 4, the performance of normal Schottky cells decrease quickly in air, while that of the inverted cell maintains 70% of their initial value after several weeks. Fig. S9 (in the ESI†) shows variations in shunt-resistance (RSh), series-resistance (RS), FF, JSC, and VOC. For the normal cell, both FF and JSC decreased as the RS increased from 19 to 600 Ω cm2, probably due to a decrease in the conductivity of the LiF–Al cathode originating from oxidation. Furthermore, since the Schottky junction is formed at the metal contact, oxidation of LiF–Al also responds to a decrease in the built-in potential as indicated by decreases in VOC and RSh. In contrast, the RSh and RS of the inverted cell varied slightly around 240 ± 20 Ω cm2 and 22 ± 3 Ω cm2, respectively, because both PEI and Au–Ag top anodes are air-durable. The decrease in inverted cell performance is most likely due to the decreased JSC, which may be due to the heavy oxidation of PbS CQDs.

Conclusions
In this report, we demonstrate the simple device architecture with a junction at the front of the CQD active layer, where carriers are generated at the earliest in the device by using Lϕ-TCO. The device Lϕ-TCO/PbS CQD/Hϕ-metal was newly defined in this article as inverted Schottky colloidal quantum dot solar cells. Junction formation in the front with a width of about 180 nm was confirmed by EQE enhancement, linear dependence of VOC on the energy gap of CQD, and Schottky analysis. The inverted Schottky CQD SCs boost 70% EQE in the short-wavelength region of the solar spectrum. Devices presented in this study also yield high VOC and a record value of 0.75 V was achieved using small PbS CQDs with a bandgap of 1.56 eV. The ultimate inverted Schottky cell showed a VOC of 0.64 V, a FF of 43.3%, and a JSC of 13.6 mA cm−2, corresponding to an AM1.5 PCE of 3.8%, which is air-stable. The inverted Schottky CQD SCs demonstrated in this study overcome both the air-instability of conventional Schottky SCs and the complex and high-temperature fabrication procedure of PNJ SCs. Our inverted structure could be utilized as the top cell in the tandem structure.
Experimental
Materials
PbS CQDs with variable sizes were synthesized according to our previous report.39 Briefly, a mixture of PbO (4.2 mmol), 1-octadecene (ODE, 18 ml), and oleic acid (OA, 8.4–66.5 mmol) was degassed at 120 °C for 2 hours followed sequentially by adjusting to an elevated temperature (65–130 °C), injection of bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (2 mmol in 4 ml ODE), and cooling to room temperature. The size of the QD was varied by changing the injection temperature and/or the amount of added OA. After being washed once with ethanol and twice with acetone using the typical solvent – non-solvent precipitation procedure, PbS CQDs were dispersed in anhydrous n-octane to produce 30 mg ml−1 stock solution.
Device fabrication
FTO substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication in acetone, methanol, and deionized water, and finally dried by N2 flow. PEI solution (0.0–1.0 wt% in methoxymethanol) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 5000 rpm for 1 min and an acceleration time of 5 s followed by annealing at 100 °C on a hot plate in air. The resultant PEI/FTO substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box for PbS QD film fabrication, which was conducted using a layer-by-layer procedure. Each coating cycle consisted of dropping 0.2 ml PbS stock solution onto the substrate while spinning followed by treatment with 0.3 ml of 1,2-ethanedithiol 1.0 volume percentage in acetonitrile, and rinsing with fresh acetonitrile and octane. This coating cycle was repeated to adjust the thickness of the PbS QD layer. After annealing the QD films at 90 °C for 5 minutes in air, MoOx (10 nm) and Au–Ag (80 nm) were sequentially deposited onto PbS CQDs to complete the cells.
Characterization
The absorption spectra of PbS CQDs in tetrachloroethylene and the transmittance of the FTO and PEI/FTO substrate were obtained using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV3600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CQDs were measured on a fluorometer (Fluorolog, Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ, USA) and the energy bandgap of QDs was calculated from the PL peak maximum. X-ray photoemission (XPS) analyses were conducted on an ESCALAB 210 spectrometer equipped with an aluminium anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV) and operated at a steady pressure of ∼10−10 torr to confirm formation of the PEI layer on FTO. Cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was conducted on a JSM-7500F microscope (JEOL, Asikima, Tokyo, Japan) to measure the thickness of the PbS QD layer. The thickness of the PEI layer was estimated using ellipsometry (SE) with an M2000D (J. A. Wollam Co. Inc., U.S.A.). Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed using an Agilent 4294A under CP–RP model. The AC signal was set 100 mV and 1 kHz. The bias was applied on the top Au electrode and varied from 0.7 V to −0.6 V with an increasing step of 6.5 mV. Each C–V curve was the average of 16 scans. J–V measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter. An Oriel solar simulator operating at 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a silicon solar cell, was used to simulate the solar spectrum under AM1.5 conditions. EQE measurements were conducted on a custom-built set-up, which consisted of a power supply (Newport 69911), a xenon lamp, a monochromator (Newport Oriel 1/8m Cornerstone), and a Merlin™ lock-in amplifier.

 	Fig. 1  Calculated rate of carrier generation in the 200 nm thick PbS QD (Eg = 1.34 eV) layer excited by incoming light through TCO and light absolutely reflected at the back metal electrode. Inset: electrostatic potential energy for inverted (solid line) and normal (dashed line) Schottky devices with a 150 nm wide depletion region.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Chemical structure of PEI. (b) schematic structure and (c) cross-sectional FE-SEM image of an inverted Schottky solar cell; the yellow line and white-blue line sketched in (c) indicate the PEI and MoOx layers, respectively. (d) The EQE of an inverted and a normal Schottky solar cell with a 200 nm thick PbS QD layer. The structure of a normal Schottky cell is ITO/PbS CQD/LiF–Al. A UV-vis absorption spectrum of the corresponding PbS CQDs is inserted and scaled with the right y-axis. Inset: J–V curves of the devices on a semilogarithmic scale. These devices yield 3.0% (inverted) and 2.3% (normal) PCE under simulated AM1.5 illumination. (e) The energy band diagram for the inverted Schottky device under open-circuit conditions. Carriers generated in the PbS layer are separated by a Schottky junction formed at the front FTO contact. Electrons tunnel through an ∼3 nm thick PEI layer to the Lϕ-FTO cathode while holes move to the Au–Ag anode via trap states of MoOx.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The dependence of VOC on the energy gap of PbS CQDs. Each data point is the average of six devices with different active areas from a single Lϕ-FTO substrate. All devices had a 200 nm thick PbS QD layer. The gray line with the inserted equation is a least-squares fit to the experimental data. (b) Capacitance–voltage characterization of devices with 80 ± 10, 200 ± 20, and 350 ± 25 nm thick PbS QD (Eg = 1.28 eV). (c) J–V characteristics of the 200 nm thick device under dark and simulated AM1.5 illumination. Photocurrent (Jphoto = Jlight − Jdark) equals to zero at a compensation voltage of 0.56 V.

 	Fig. 4  Air-stability tests for the inverted and normal Schottky solar cells. The cells were kept in air and measured in the N2-filled glove box. Inset: J–V curves and data sheets obtained under simulated AM1.5 illumination.
