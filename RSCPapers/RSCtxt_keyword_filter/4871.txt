    , Accepted 24th May 2019First published on 11th June 2019AbstractMolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively used as a hole transport layer in many inverted polymer solar cell devices. However, its potential as an electron transport layer in a solar cell device has rarely been reported. In this paper, we demonstrate an iPSC with enhanced photovoltaic performance by the introduction of a MoS2 nanosheet (NS) interlayer. Herein, MoS2 NS thin films were uniformly deposited on a polyethylenimine ethoxylated polymer by an electrostatic interaction. The MoS2 NS interlayer in the iPSC device plays important roles as a sub-photo sensitizer and an electron transport layer and provides effective charge separation for the enhancement of device performance. iPSCs with MoS2 NSs based on bulk heterojunction active materials such as P3HT:PC60BM, PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM showed maximum power conversion efficiencies of 3.54%, 8.12%, and 9.08%, respectively, which were 27%, 11%, and 15% higher than those of the reference, respectively. Furthermore, the enhanced photovoltaic performance and electron transport mechanism of the iPSCs with the MoS2 NSs were confirmed experimentally using finite-difference-time-domain modeling and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. The computational simulation results showed that the light absorption of the iPSCs with the MoS2 NS interlayer was slightly better than that of the iPSCs without the MoS2 NS interlayer. The electron decay time of PTB7:PC71BM with the MoS2 NS interlayer at a wavelength of 700 nm was reduced to 60 ps from 100 ps of PTB7:PC71BM without the MoS2 NS interlayer. The efficient light absorption and electron transfer characteristics of MoS2 NSs significantly improved the photovoltaic conversion performance of the iPSC devices.
Introduction
In recent years, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide compounds, materials resembling graphene with semiconducting properties, have been attracting greater attention1,2 due to their excellent optical, electronic and mechanical properties which can be applied to a variety of applications, including nano-electronics, photovoltaics, and photochemical devices.3–7 In particular, MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising candidate for fabricating ultrathin-layer photovoltaic devices with a combination of excellent photovoltaic performance, good flexibility, long lifetime and low-cost fabrication.8–11 Intrinsic MoS2 has n-type semiconductor properties and wide band gap ranges from 1.2 eV to 1.9 eV according to the number of layers.12 Furthermore, monolayer MoS2 having a direct bandgap of Eg = 1.9 eV has an electron mobility of ∼200 cm2 V−1 s−1 enabling its application in field effect transistors having a high current ON/OFF ratio (∼108).13 It also has an excellent optical response with very high optical absorption over a wide spectrum of wavelengths.14 Therefore, MoS2 with strong absorption of sunlight can be a potential material for the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells.15
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are attractive because of their simple manufacturing process and low material consumption due to their thin-film structure, high absorption coefficient, ability to use various organic materials, and low-temperature processes involved.16 For this reason, MoS2 is considered to be a suitable material which can improve the efficiency of PSCs, and thus a considerable amount of research has been carried out in this regard.17,18 There are various reports of using MoS2 materials as a hole transport layer (HTL) in polymer solar cell devices.19–21 A recent study by Kesavan et al.20 reports on PSCs using MoS2 as a HTL in a PTB7:PC71BM bulk heterojunction based solar cell device by adding MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) to the active layer. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency of 8.17% was obtained for a 30% loading of MoS2 NSs in the active layer.20 Furthermore, according to the study of Yang et al., the PSCs were fabricated by applying a thin film of a chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2) lattice with oxygen atoms incorporated as a HTL material. As a result, an improved power conversion efficiency of 7.64% was obtained compared to the devices using PEDOT:PSS and ce-MoS2 as HTL materials.21 However, there have been very few studies on the application of MoS2 NSs as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted polymer solar cell devices (iPSCs). Here, we report a novel approach to enhance the photovoltaic performance of iPSCs by introducing the MoS2 NS interlayer as an ETL. Also, we suggest that MoS2 NSs conjugated with a polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) polymer of a tunable work function material can be used as efficient ETL materials for high-performance iPSCs. Because of its various roles as an optical absorption layer and an ETL, the introduction of the MoS2 NS layer offers an opportunity to increase the light conversion efficiency of iPSCs with various photovoltaic active materials. To demonstrate the roles of MoS2 NSs, the optical, structural and electrical properties were studied along with the device structure and photovoltaic behavior of the fabricated iPSCs with the MoS2 NS interlayer using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM energy dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, modeling of finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements.
Results and discussion
In order to utilize MoS2 NSs as an ETL in iPSC devices, the MoS2 NSs should be a few nanometers in size since a thickness above a certain level can act as a barrier which interrupts carrier transfer. Fig. 1a–c shows the overall processes of MoS2 NS dispersion. Commercial MoS2 sheets were mechanically exfoliated to MoS2 NSs that are a few nanometers in size using tip-sonication and centrifugation process (2 g of the commercial MoS2 sheets was dispersed in 1 L of ethanol). After the centrifugation process, the MoS2 NS supernatant was diluted in ethanol to a concentration of ∼16.67 mg L−1 for the introduction of the interlayer into the iPSCs. The TEM image in Fig. 1d shows that the diameter of MoS2 NSs is ∼20 nm. Fig. 1e shows an enlarged high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the area marked by the red dotted rectangle in Fig. 1d. It presents the hexagonal crystalline structure of the MoS2 NSs with a lattice spacing of 2.7 Å, corresponding to the (100) plane. In addition, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the MoS2 NSs illustrates the hexagonal symmetry from the [001] zone axis (Fig. 1e).22 AFM was performed to compare the average diameter of MoS2 NSs before and after mechanical exfoliation as shown in Fig. S1a and d.† The average diameter of MoS2 NSs after exfoliation was around 25 nm, whereas that of the MoS2 sheets before exfoliation was ∼300 nm (Fig. S1†). These results mean that MoS2 NSs were well distributed without aggregation after the mechanical exfoliation process. The UV-vis absorption spectra of MoS2 NSs are shown in Fig. 1f. Three excitonic features are observed at around 385 nm, 610 nm, and 665 nm. Among them, the feature at a wavelength of around 385 nm seems to play a supporting role in the absorption process in this study, which is in good agreement with the literature for MoS2 nanoclusters.23

For further optical characterization of the MoS2 NS layer, Raman spectroscopy measurement was carried out and is shown in Fig. 1g. The two peaks in the lower wavenumber range (350–450 cm−1) correspond to the in-plane E12g mode (∼385 cm−1) and the out-of-plane A1g (∼407 cm−1) mode of MoS2, respectively. The frequency difference (Δk) between E12g and A1g is 22 cm−1 and represents the feature of few-layer MoS2.24 The Δk value is slightly inconsistent with the previously reported value for MoS2 NSs but it seemed acceptable.24Fig. 2a depicts a schematic illustration of the iPSC structure with the MoS2 NS interlayer. To understand the interface between PEIE and the MoS2 NSs in the iPSC device, a cross-sectional TEM image was taken using a focused ion beam technique. Fig. 2b shows the formation of MoS2 NSs with an average height of 8.31 nm and an average width of 23.01 nm on the PEIE surface. There is a variation in thickness and width of MoS2 NSs from 7.43 to 9.79 nm and from 16.89 to 37.16 nm, respectively. This thickness variation is mainly due to the MoS2 NSs being obtained through mechanical exfoliation by tip-sonication without a surface stabilizer. The highly magnified HR-TEM image in Fig. 2c is the magnification of the zone marked by the white dotted rectangle in Fig. 2b. It reveals an inter-planar spacing of 0.61 nm corresponding to the (002) plane, which is in good agreement with the typical feature of MoS2.25,26 To meticulously inspect the atomic configuration for quantitative evaluation of MoS2 NSs in the iPSC device, a STEM-EDS and an annular dark field (ADF)-STEM were used. In the left-hand side of the ADF-STEM image in Fig. 2d, the contrast of the MoS2 NS layer shows the presence of MoS2 NSs on PEIE/ITO/glass. Also, the STEM-EDS mapping of MoS2 NSs reveals the localized spatial distribution of Mo and S as shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 2d. Furthermore, the annular dark field (ADF) and annular bright field (ABF) images of the MoS2 NSs are shown in Fig. S3, ESI.† From all the above analysis, we suggest that the MoS2 NS layer bonded through electrostatic interactions. AFM was used to investigate the surface morphology of the as-formed MoS2 NSs. Fig. 2e shows the 1000 × 1000 nm2 AFM topography image with the color contrast of the MoS2 NSs spin-coated onto the PEIE/ITO/glass substrate. The AFM measurement was also performed for SiO2/Si and pure PEIE on SiO2/Si (Fig. S2†). The surface morphologies of SiO2 and PEIE are very smooth and their RMS values are 0.696 nm and 0.257 nm, respectively. The white bright spots in Fig. 2e represent the differences in height which correspond to the thickness of the multilayer MoS2 NSs. It is also evident that the diameters of MoS2 NSs are distributed between few nanometers and few tens of nanometers on the surface. The particle density was estimated to be 7.7 × 1012 cm−2. Interestingly, the MoS2 NSs were well distributed and packed with each other without any aggregation on the PEIE layer. This result implies that there is some chemical interaction between the MoS2 NSs and the PEIE layer. Fig. 2f presents the diameter distribution of MoS2 NSs on PEIE, which was investigated with the AFM topography and line profile. It is shown that the diameter of MoS2 NSs is dominantly distributed around 27 nm, which is comparable to the average width obtained from the TEM image.

To closely examine the bonding mechanism, Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) measurement was performed. The process of conjugation between PEIE and MoS2 can be explained from the FT-IR analysis of MoS2 NSs. The peak at ∼3400 cm−1 indicates the presence of hydroxyl (OH) groups on the surface of MoS2 NSs as shown in Fig. 2g.27–29 The result of the FT-IR measurement reveals that the MoS2 NSs can form an electrostatic interaction such as hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amine groups of PEIE and the hydroxyl groups of the MoS2 NSs. The uniform distribution of the MoS2 NSs on PEIE can be attributed to not only the formation of electrostatic interactions by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amine groups of PEIE and the hydroxyl groups of the MoS2 NSs but also the centrifugal force by spin coating.
The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) to explain the energy level of MoS2 NSs in the iPSC structure. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammogram of the MoS2 NS solution of Nafion measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The VB and CB were calculated from the oxidation initiation potential  and the reduction initiation potential . The VB of the MoS2 NSs was calculated to be −6.391 eV from the following equation: . The CB of the MoS2 NSs was calculated to be −4.311 eV from the following equation: .30,31

To describe the carrier transfer mechanism of this solar cell device in detail, the energy level diagram of the iPSC structure is shown in Fig. 3b and S5† along with the possible pathways of current generation and transport after the excitation.
The VB and CB of the MoS2 NSs are located below the corresponding VB and CB of PTB7 and PC71BM as depicted in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, the work functions (Φ) of both ITO and ITO/PEIE structures were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. S4, ESI.†32 Bare ITO exhibits a Φ of 4.29 eV that is calculated from the secondary electron cut-off region. After a thin PEIE layer was coated on ITO, its Φ decreased down to 3.36 eV. The presence of the PEIE layer can decrease the Φ of ITO due to the formation of a dipole layer as shown in Fig. 3b,32,33 which improves the electron movement to ITO. The movement path of the electrons, by referring to the energy band diagram, is described as follows. Under the light, the photo-generated electrons in the active layer (P3HT, PTB7 or PTB7-Th:PC71BM) can be easily transported to the ITO electrode through the MoS2 interlayer, then finally collected on the ITO electrode through a PEIE layer. The energy level diagrams of the iPSCs with P3HT:PC60BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layers are shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† Accordingly, the energy level of MoS2 NSs obtained from the CV is suitable for the carrier transfer to other organic layers.
To investigate the effect of optical absorption on the device performance, numerical simulations were performed using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) solution. The broadband plane wave source (400–800 nm) was set to normally incident at the solar cells, and the light absorption was calculated using Pabs = 0.5ε0ε′ω|E|2, where ε0 and ε′ are the permittivity of free space and that of the imaginary part of each layer, respectively, ω is the free space frequency, and E is the electric field. The simulation size was 104 × 104 × 1500 nm in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. A periodic boundary condition was used in the x and y directions while a perfect matching layer boundary condition was used in the z direction. The solar cell structure used for the simulation was Ag/MoO3/PTB7:PC71BM/MoS2/PEIE/ITO/glass (Fig. S6 ESI†). Optical constants of Ag, MoO3, and MoS2 were taken from the literature, and those of the others were obtained using an ellipsometer (Woollam M2000D).34,35Fig. 4a shows the simulated optical absorption spectra of iPSCs with and without the MoS2 NS interlayer. The simulation shows broad absorption spectra with two peaks at around 450 nm and 650 nm. Although there was no significant difference in absorption between the two samples, a few percent increase in absorption was observed at around 400 nm. In addition, Fig. 4b presents the absorption profiles of the simulation at 400 nm for the iPSCs with MoS2 NSs, which clearly show an increase in absorption upon the introduction of MoS2 NSs. The small increase in the absorption may affect the absorption efficiency of the device but does not mainly contribute to the improved performance of iPSCs. Since MoS2 has a high extinction coefficient, it may play a role in increasing the efficiency by increasing the absorption rate in solar cell devices.36

To understand the enhanced charge transport phenomena between the MoS2 NSs and the PTB7:PC71BM heterojunction concerning the excited electron–hole recombination, the TCSPC measurement was carried out at room temperature using a laser excitation wavelength of 400 nm (λex) with data fitted by an exponential function, as shown in Fig. 4c. The calculated average lifetimes at around 700 nm for the reference and PTB7:PC71BM/MoS2 NS structures are 0.1 ns and 0.06 ns, respectively (Table 1). This result demonstrates the effective charge transfer from PTB7:PC71BM to MoS2 NSs in the iPSCs, which can be explained using the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism.33 The FRET process appears to be dominant since the donor-to-acceptor distance is smaller than 10 nm.33 The PTB7:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction was deposited as photoactive materials on the surfaces of MoS2 NSs in this study, and the FRET process from PTB7:PC71BM to the MoS2 NSs occurs in the stacked composite (photoactive materials/ETL) structures of iPSCs.

Table 1 shows the PL lifetimes of iPSCs with and without the MoS2 NS interlayer. The PL decay curves were fitted by an exponential function to calculate the lifetimes (τ1) and average lifetimes (f1τ1) of the samples, where f1 is the fractional intensity, τ1 is the lifetime, and χ2 is the reduced chi-squared value. The FRET efficiency of the charge transfer can be estimated from the following equation: η = 1 − (τDA/τD),(1)where τDA and τD are the fluorescence lifetimes of the donor (PTB7:PC71BM) in the presence and absence of the acceptor (MoS2 NSs), respectively.37
From eqn (1), a FRET efficiency of 67% at a wavelength of around 700 nm is determined from the lifetimes of the donor (PTB7:PC71BM) and the acceptor (MoS2 NSs) from the time-resolved PL data. In this case, the electron decay of PTB7:PC71BM with MoS2 NSs was much faster than that without MoS2 NSs. This result implies the existence of an additional high-efficiency relaxation channel and confirms the efficient electron transfer from PC71BM to the MoS2 NSs. There are two possible reasons for an efficient electron transfer. One is the excellent electronic and optical properties of the MoS2 material.38,39 The other is an easy electron transfer from the active layer to the MoS2 ETL. The energy band diagram obtained through the CV measurement shows that the lower energy level of MoS2 leads to more effective electron transfer to the electrode. Taken together, these results suggest that the MoS2 NS interlayer acts as not only the sub-photo sensitizer but also the carrier transport layer in the iPSC.
To experimentally demonstrate the use of MoS2 NSs as an effective interlayer, iPSCs with three representative donor–acceptor polymers namely PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM and P3HT:PC60BM were fabricated with and without the MoS2 NS interlayer.40–46Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic performance of the iPSCs, and the corresponding details are shown in Table 2. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, and P3HT:PC60BM based iPSCs with the MoS2 NSs were obtained as high as 8.12%, 9.08%, and 3.54%, which were about 11%, 15%, and 27% higher than those without MoS2 NSs, respectively. Fig. 5b, d and f show the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of three kinds of photoactive materials. It is noteworthy that the iPSCs with MoS2 NSs tend to increase the EQE across the whole UV-visible spectrum (wavelength from 350 nm to 750 nm). An overall improvement in the EQE across the broad spectrum is not in accordance with the simulation results that showed an increased absorption only at around 400 nm. Therefore, the effect of MoS2 NSs as a sub-photo sensitizer on the EQE is not great in real iPSC devices. Although the MoS2 NSs have only a negligible effect on the enhancement of absorption, the photovoltaic performance of the iPSCs with MoS2 NSs was significantly improved, which could be due to the excellent electron transport of MoS2.

The photovoltaic performances show that the rate of increase of the PCE was the highest for P3HT:PC60BM based iPSCs with MoS2 NSs. However the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based iPSCs with MoS2 NSs was the best, which is mainly due to a broader absorption band in PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The improvement of the PCE is attributed to an increase of the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF). This can be explained by the fact that the MoS2 NSs and PEIE layers play a critical role in charge generation and transport processes between ITO and the active layer (P3HT:PC60BM, PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM). To clearly explore the increase of the FF, the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSh) were calculated from the inverse slopes in the J–V curves obtained from Fig. 5a. The RS decreased from 9.0 Ω cm2 to 3.0 Ω cm2 while the RSh increased from 858 Ω cm2 to 1115 Ω cm2. The increased RSh and decreased RS suggest that the decreased contact resistance between the MoS2 NSs and PTB7:PC71BM contributes to an increase in the FF. These results indicate that MoS2 NSs can be used as an effective ETL to improve the PCE of iPSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically studied the application of MoS2 NSs as an ETL for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance of iPSCs. The fabricated iPSCs with the MoS2 NSs interlayer conjugated with the PEIE organic material exhibited an improvement in photovoltaic performance. The photovoltaic behavior of the fabricated iPSCs with the MoS2 NS interlayer demonstrates that the MoS2 NS layer is an efficient ETL layer and sub-photo sensitizer. The effect of MoS2 NSs as an ETL was studied through systematic experiments on iPSCs with various active materials (P3HT:PC60BM, PTB7:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM). Among them, PTB7-Th, the PC71BM-based solar cell with MoS2 NSs, exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 9.08%, which is 15% higher than that of the reference. Also, the P3HT:PC60BM and PTB7:PC71BM based solar cells with MoS2 NSs as the ETL showed power conversion efficiencies of 3.54% and 8.12%, which were 27% and 11% higher than that of the reference, respectively. A significant improvement of the photovoltaic conversion performance is mainly attributed to effective charge transport via MoS2 NSs supported by an increased FRET efficiency of 67% from PTB7:PC71BM to MoS2 NSs based on the estimated average lifetime (with reduced τavg (∼60 ps)). The results suggest that MoS2 is a versatile material that can be used as an ETL for improving the performance of iPSCs. The present study demonstrates the potential of MoS2 and opens the way for the real application of these nanomaterials.
