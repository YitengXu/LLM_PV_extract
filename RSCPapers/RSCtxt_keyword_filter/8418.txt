    , Accepted 6th August 2012First published on 7th August 2012AbstractWe report herein lightweight, and economical dye-sensitized solar cells fabrication facilitated by an all plastic, metal free cathode consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene).
Renewable sources of energy, especially conversion of solar energy into electricity, are now being regarded as green and clean solutions to the world's massive energy needs. Among the various technologies investigated, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC, also called the Grätzel cell) is one of the promising alternatives, and it is now being probed both by academic and industrial research teams because of its low-cost fabrication processes.1,2 The ability to be designed as a flexible device, with high efficiency under low and diffuse light, further adds to its advantage compared to other photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Significant efforts have been focused on the development of new sensitizers, semiconductor photoanodes and redox couples to obtain efficient devices,3,4 however, not much emphasis has been given to finding alternate current collectors which could lead to drastic reductions in the cost of the DSSCs. Up to now transparent conducting oxide (TCO) coated glasses are the principal charge collectors in DSSCs and contribute to a major share of the cost in fabrication (US $ 8–12 m−2 on the GW scale). In order to make DSSCs commercially viable (US $ <20 m−2), at least one of their glass substrates needs to be replaced.1 The limited resources, high cost of metal, brittleness and the high energy treatment required during its deposition process make TCO coated glass un-economical and alternatives are being sought by replacing it with doped ZnO coatings or metal grids.5–9 To lower the materials' cost further, it is foreseen to replace also the typically used platinized cathode in DSSCs, which is typically employed and exhibits excellent catalytic activity. Therefore it is paramount to develop new TCO and Pt free cathode using materials that are cheaper and which are still capable of yielding comparable efficiencies and device stabilities to those in the past. Carbon based materials are envisioned as an alternative to Pt as they are inexpensive, have low electrical resistance and show electro-catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide. Carbon nanotube/graphene conductive coatings are also being probed as a possible replacement of various TCOs and possess high optical transparency along with low electrical resistance.10 Conducting polymers are being exploited as an easy alternative to TCO coating applications. Typically conductivity is lower for conducting polymers than that for inorganic materials, but these polymers have the advantage of being flexible, less expensive and more environmentally friendly in processing and in manufacturing. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has been extensively exploited owing to its relatively high conductivity, low band gap, excellent electrochemical and environmental stability, and transmittance in the visible spectrum,11–13 rivaling TCO coatings. The high transmittance of the films opens the road towards potential applications such as in power-producing windows or metal foil supported DSSCs. The PEDOT coated cathode has been successfully demonstrated as an alternative to Pt catalysts,12,14,15 and by using ionic liquids the microstructure can be altered so as to produce grains with diameters in the nanometer scale, resulting in the increased hardness and electro-catalytic activity of PEDOT. Recently an in situ chemical polymerization process has been utilized directly on the glass for the fabrication of TCO free DSSCs,16 however these films suffer from very low adherence and can easily be peeled off from the substrate. Herein, as a proof of concept, we report the fabrication of a metal free DSSC cathode on plastic substrates i.e. electropolymerized PEDOT (e-PEDOT)-on-PEDOT-PET substrates. Flexible DSSCs can be fabricated using a reel-to-reel mass production process and are considered to be suitable systems for electronics-integrated lightweight PV.17,18 We believe that acceptable PV values can be obtained, with fine-tuning and further optimization of these systems.

Table 1 summarizes the PV properties obtained using D21L6 dye19 (structure provided in ESI,†) on a TCO free cathode and comparisons are made with reference platinized TCO coatings. The large difference in efficiency can be attributed to the high resistance of the PEDOT film, which resulted in reduced current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), especially under full sun illumination intensity. In order to reduce the resistance, additional layers of PEDOT were deposited by electropolymerization (hereafter called “e-PEDOT”), resulting in an additional bluish coating on the PEDOT substrate itself. The high resistivity of PEDOT compared to TCO coatings leads to large voltage drop during electropolymerization and to achieve the required current density the potential was applied for a longer period of time during electropolymerization. Table 1 shows that the double layer PEDOT deposition increases JSC and FF, which was made possible by minimizing the sheet resistance resulting in an improvement of the conductivity. The JSC was eventually improved from 4.6 to 9.3 mA cm−2 and attained up to 80% of the reference platinized cathode value with a power conversion efficiency of 1.94% at full sun. Still high resistivity of PEDOT places limitation on charge collection and limits the current density. To achieve the enhanced PV parameters these films were treated with ethylene glycol to increase the charge transport properties of the PEDOT. The conductivity of PEDOT can be increased many fold utilizing a post-treatment of ethylene glycol.8 After treatment with ethylene glycol the device shows improvement in FF and in JSC values, these ameliorations being most likely due to a lower series resistance. Moreover, the good adherence of the polymer layers to the substrates gave reproducible device performance. The open circuit potential (Voc) of the polymer cathode device is almost identical to the platinized cathode devices while the FF values are relatively low in the case of polymer cathodes. The low FF witnessed is due to the high series and charge transfer resistances leading to loss of current and, thus of power conversion efficiency. The redox couple Z960 consists of 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) 15/85 (v/v) mixture of valeronitrile and acetonitrile.

 Fig. 1  The J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with PEDOT as shown in Table 2. DSSCs employ Y123 dye on a single layer TiO2 film of ∼6.5 μm, PEDOT double layers, and electrolyte: I3−/I− (JH34) (black lines), [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (JH70) (blue lines), and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ (JH180) (red lines). All solid, dashed, and dash-dotted curves indicate the J–V curves at 1, 0.51, and 0.095 Sun, respectively, while all dotted lines indicate dark currents. 
The second step adopted was to improve device efficiency, and involves increasing the current density by replacing the dye and changing the electrolyte. Recently3,20,21 a dye called Y123 (structure in ESI†, Fig. 1b) has shown very promising PV performance particularly with cobalt complexes, both [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ were used to replace I3−/I− as a redox couple. Redox couple JH34 was formulated as (0.6 M DMII, 0.05M LiI, 0.03 I2, 0.05 M GuNCS, 0.25 M TBP 15/85 (v/v) mixture of valeronitrile and acetonitrile), while JH70 consist of (0.22 M [CoII(bpy-pz)2](PF6)2, 0.05 M [CoIII(bpy-pz)2](PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M TBP in acetonitrile) and JH180 was made from (0.22 M [CoII(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2, 0.05 M [CoIII(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M TBP in acetonitrile). The high charge transfer resistances seen with Pt cathodes were reduced by replacement with a conducting polymer cathode.3Table 2 summarizes the PV results obtained using Y123 sensitized TiO2 film in conjunction with cobalt electrolytes comparing them to devices made with Y123 and the I3−/I− redox couple. Open circuit voltage (Voc) was the principal improvement: ∼150 mV with [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and ∼260 mV with [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+, respectively, in comparison to the I3−/I− redox couple. The higher Vocs are associated with the higher redox potentials of the cobalt redox couples. Improvement in the FF is plausibly ascribed to low charge transfer resistance with the conducting polymer, which is in agreement with our previous study.3,21 Following the PV results, the best result, 4.22% at full sun (Fig. 1), was achieved using a [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couple while 3.96% was achieved by [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+. It is noteworthy that the cells utilizing either [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ or [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ produced efficiencies close to 7 and 6%, respectively, under low illumination intensities, i.e. 0.095 sun. Although there was enhancement in the FF when employing the cobalt shuttle, the values are still lower (∼0.70) than that achieved with Pt/FTO, which is, once again, most likely associated with high series resistance. This finding implies that decreasing the series resistance can further enhance PV performance.

The Jsc and Voc of these devices show notable decrease as the light intensity was lowered, while the FF increases and highest efficiencies were obtained at 0.1 Sun. The current density increases in linear proportion to light intensity, indicating that it is not limited by charge transport. The device employing the Y123 sensitizer, the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox shuttle, and PEDOT as a cathode shows a broad IPCE, almost plateau-like in the UV-Vis region, with the highest IPCE maxima of >60% (Fig. 2), without significant decrease in the optical transmission. These metal free DSSC cathodes exhibit comparable quantum efficiency over the whole spectrum range.

We have shown the feasibility of a metal free cathode made up of all plastic (e-PEDOT–PEDOT–PET). Iodine free DSSCs composed of noncorrosive cobalt(III/II) redox shuttles were also investigated and delivered better results than the classical iodide electrolytes. Electropolymerized PEDOT layers deposited on a PEDOT coated PET surface act as both a charge collector as well as an efficient electro-catalyst for interfacial electron transfer. To the best of our knowledge, a record metal free plastic cathode cell performance of 4.22%, can be achieved at full sun, which is 27% less than the standard value of platinized TCO coated electrodes, but at a fraction of its cost. Together with metal foil based photoanodes these newly developed cathodes will pave the way for reel-to-reel DSSCs fabrication. We believe that with further modification this process can be optimized to give equivalent results and the reported system shows great potential for cost effective DSSCs fabrication.
