    , Accepted 6th August 2020First published on 7th August 2020AbstractHalide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high power conversion efficiency. Compositional engineering and surface passivation technologies have been drawing great attention to enhance their energy conversion efficiency and moisture resistance. In this study, the density functional theory method was employed to understand the effects of compositional engineering at the A site of perovskites and the 3-butenoic acid-based passivation layer on the structural, electronic and optical properties of halide perovskites. Our results suggest that the electronic and optical properties of CsPbI3 can be tuned by the mixing of caesium and FA cations. Moreover, the calculation of adsorption energies on mixed-cation Cs1−xFAxPbI3(001) surfaces reveals that the much stronger adsorption strength of 3-butenoic acid facilitates blocking of the interaction of surfaces with water molecules. Meanwhile, the calculated results indicate that adopting such an organic molecule as a passivation layer does not compromise their excellent electronic and optical properties. Our theoretical understanding of the A cation engineering and organic molecule-based surface passivation will be beneficial to the improvement of the overall performance of perovskite solar cells.
1 Introduction
Increasing global energy consumption and limited sources of fossil fuels call for sustainable and renewable energy. One of the most promising strategies is solar cell technology which can convert sunlight into electricity and provide an eco-friendly renewable energy route.1 In the past decade, halide perovskite materials have attracted tremendous interest in optoelectronics and spintronics and have been recognized as promising candidates for application in next-generation photovoltaic (PV) devices owing to their unique combination of electronic and optical properties.2–8 Since 2009, halide perovskite solar cells have witnessed an unprecedented increase in their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 3.8% to 25.2%.9–16
Halide perovskite light absorbers have the general formula ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation with relatively large size, commonly inorganic caesium or an organic cation, methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) or formamidinium (FA, NH2CHNH2+); B is a divalent metal cation, possibly lead, tin, or germanium; and X is a halide anion.17 By engineering either of the A, B, or X site ions, metal halide perovskites can be modified to fit a specific application.18–23 On the other hand, the instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) caused by their vulnerability to environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, light, heat etc. presents a major hurdle for commercialization.24,25 Particularly, moisture instability is a threat to the long-term application of perovskites because perovskite light absorbers can be rapidly decomposed by water.26 For example, (CH3NH3)PbI3 (MAPbI3) would be decomposed into the monohydrate phase ((CH3NH3)PbI3·H2O) with poor photovoltaic properties.27 Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to improving the moisture resistance of perovskite layers.28 Surface passivation is one of the most commonly used strategies to enhance their moisture resistance.29 By introducing functionalized organic molecules, the perovskite surface is passivated. And the effective adsorption of organic molecules can, therefore, block the interaction between the perovskite surface and water. As a result, the passivated surface can be stabilized with the enhanced moisture stability. Recently, oleic acid (C18H34O2 (CH3(CH2)7CHCH(CH2)7COOH)), an omega-nine fatty acid, has been used as a surfactant to passivate the surface of perovskites, which can significantly improve their moisture stability.30,31 Abdelmageed et al. reported a method in which the surface of the MAPbI3 perovskite films was modified by spin coating oleic acid (OA) to create a water-resistant layer, making the system stable in dark humid air at ∼76% RH for 4 weeks.32 Hao et al. synthesized Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 quantum dot solar cells by an OA ligand-assisted cation-exchange method, achieving a champion PCE of 16.6% with negligible hysteresis.21 Although the OA-based surface passivation is an effective way to improve the moisture stability, theoretical studies on the effect of such an organic passivation layer on the electronic and optical properties of perovskite materials are still rare.
In this study, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the effects of the A cation engineering and the 3-butenoic acid [C4H6O2(CH2CHCH2COOH)] based passivation layer on the properties of the perovskite surface. 3-Butenoic acid was selected because it has the same functional group (–COOH) and carbon–carbon double bond as OA. Due to the entropic stabilization induced by the concomitant incorporation of FA and Cs,33 mixed-cation Cs1−xFAxPbI3 surfaces were used as objective perovskite structures. The theoretical results demonstrate that the mixing of Cs and FA cations can alter the overall performance of the light absorbers. 3-Butenoic acid is adsorbed strongly on the Cs1−xFAxPbI3 surface, which can maintain the surface structure by blocking the adsorption of water molecules. Moreover, the adsorbed 3-butenoic acid has a small impact on the electronic and optical properties of perovskites.
2 Computational details
The DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method in this study.34,35 Electron–ion interactions are described using PAW potentials,36 with valence configurations of 5s24d105p66s1 for Cs (Cs_sv_GW), 6s24f145d106p2 for Pb (Pb_sv_GW), 5s24d105p5 for I (I_sv_GW), 2s22p2 for C (C_GW_new), 2s22p3 for N (N_GW_new), 2s22p4 for O (O_GW_new) and 1s1 for H (H_GW). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional,37 a form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), was employed throughout as the electron–electron exchange–correlation (XC) functional. Since traditional DFT calculations at the PBE level cannot correctly include the nonlocal van der Waals interactions,38–41 the calculations with dispersion corrections may affect the adsorption energies of small molecules.42 As such, the DFT-D3 method was adopted for dispersion corrections here.43 This paper is focused on the comparison between the systems with different compositions since the differences caused by the computational methods, e.g. the spin-orbital effects and non-localization of the exchange–correlation functionals,44 should be similar. Moreover, although the PBE functional often underestimates the bandgaps of semiconductors, previous reports showed that for hybrid perovskite band gaps obtained by using the GGA-PBE functional without taking into account the SOC effects are in good agreement with the experimental values.14,17,19,45 Additionally, as reported by Li et al., the band gaps of CsPbI3- and FAPbI3-based perovskites calculated using the GGA-PBE functional without the SOC effects were close to the results obtained using HSE (α = 0.43) + SOC, which proved that the PBE functional can provide a reasonable band gap to estimate the real band gap.46 In this regard, only the calculations at the same DFT-D3 level were performed here. The plane-wave kinetic cut-off energy was fixed at 520 eV to expand the smooth part of wave functions. And the Brillouin zone was sampled using Gamma-centred (4 × 4 × 1) k-point grids for all Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (001) surfaces. During the geometry optimizations, all atoms were allowed to relax until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1, and the convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent loop was set to 10−5 eV. Based on previous experimental studies, the FA+ cations have isotropic orientation with large entropy to stabilize the cubic structure.47 In addition, the DFT calculation results demonstrate that the FA+ cation orientation does not significantly affect the ground state of FAPbI3.48 Therefore, the impact of the FA+ orientation on all perovskites with a cubic phase is not considered in our work.
The cubic structure (α phase) of the bulk geometry of Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) was used to build our models as suggested by the recent experiments.21 Since the van der Waals corrections can achieve theoretical lattice constants close to experimental ones,17,49 the experimental data of five cubic Cs1−xFAxPbI3 structures were used.21 The surfaces were modelled by five-layer slabs, constructed by cutting the bulk crystal along the (001) crystallographic plane. The (001) surface was selected because of its highest stability among all low-index surfaces of the cubic perovskites.50 The surfaces were separated by a vacuum layer of 20 Å in this study. During the geometry optimizations, the top three layers of the surfaces including the adsorbate were relaxed, while the bottom two layers were fixed at the bulk position.
The adsorption energy of each adsorbate (ΔEad) was calculated using the following equation: (1)where Ead, Esurf and Ead/surf are the energies of an adsorbate (H2O or 3-butenoic acid molecule), the clean (001) surface and the surface with adsorbates, respectively and n is the number of adsorbates on the surface. For the calculations on H2O and 3-butenoic acid molecules, a (20 × 20 × 20) Å3 unit cell and a Γ-only k-point grid were used.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties of bulk Cs1−xFAxPbI3
The optimized atomic structures of cubic CsPbI3, Cs0.75FA0.25PbI3, Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3, Cs0.25FA0.75PbI3 and FAPbI3 bulk are shown in Fig. 1. Their structural parameters are listed in Table 1. With the increase of the content of FA, the symmetry of the bulk crystals is strongly dependent on the Cs/FA ratios. This is because the structure of the Pb–I framework has a crystal distortion after the mixing of Cs and FA due to their different sizes and morphologies. Compared with cubic CsPbI3, the lattice constants increase with the increase in the percentage of FA. This can be ascribed to the increased size of the FA cation in terms of that of the Cs cation. Consequently, Pb–I bond lengths also increase accordingly. Due to the distortion of the Pb–I inorganic framework after the mixing of FA and Cs, the smallest I–Pb–I angles deviate from the right angle. And the impact on the deviation of the I–Pb–I angles increases with the content of FA.

The total density of states (TDOS) of the bulk cubic CsPbI3, Cs0.75FA0.25PbI3, Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3, Cs0.25FA0.75PbI3 and FAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 2. It is found that these Cs1−xFAxPbI3 bulk crystals are semiconductors. The introduction of FA makes the bandgap (Eg) close to the optimal value of 1.4 eV to reach the Shockley–Queisser limit or detailed balance limit. Interestingly, the band gap first increases with the increase of FA, which reaches the maximum in Cs0.25FA0.75PbI3. The further increase of FA reduces the bandgap. This trend is similar to the change of the thermodynamic stability of Cs1−xFAxPbI3 reported in our recent paper.21 Previous studies demonstrate that the main components of the conduction band maximum (CBM) and valence band minimum (VBM) are Pb 5p and I 5p states.17,49 As such, the observed change of the bandgap by compositional engineering is mainly caused by the distortion of the Pb–I framework. Our results, therefore, suggest that Eg values can be indirectly tuned by engineering the A composition.

3.2 Surface properties of Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (001)
The surface of the light absorber is essential for the overall performance of solar cells since it directly interacts with other key components, e.g. electron/hole transport layers. Moreover, the moisture instability of the light absorbed is strongly related to the interaction between the water and the surface of light absorber materials.27,28 To this end, the properties of the (001) surface of Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (x = 0, 0.5 and 1) were investigated (see Fig. 3) because the results on their bulk properties suggest that they may have considerably different properties. After the structural optimization, the surface Pb–I bond length of CsPbI3(001) is 3.094 Å, which is almost identical to that in its bulk structure. As a comparison, the surface Pb–I bond lengths of Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3(001) and FAPbI3(001) are 3.183 Å and 3.268 Å, which are 0.86% and 2.86% longer than those in their bulk structures, respectively. Additionally, the surface I–Pb–I bond angle of CsPbI3 (001) has a slight distortion with 89.7°, while the surface I–Pb–I bond angle of Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 (001) is 84.5°, 3.98% smaller than that of the bulk phase. The surface I–Pb–I bond angle of FAPbI3 (001) is 86.5°, which is 2.8° larger than that of the bulk material. The relatively small change of the surface structures supports that the (001) surface is thermodynamically stable. It further indicates that the existence of FA has a larger effect on surface relaxation.

The corresponding DOS images of three surfaces are calculated as shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the bandgaps of three surfaces are smaller than that of the bulk. The change of CsPbI3 is the smallest, which is only 0.03 eV. The biggest change of 0.19 eV is found in the FAPbI3 (001) surface. The reduced bandgap suggests that the formation of the surface states is caused by the undercoordinated surface atoms. Since the Pb–I bond length in the FAPbI3 surface increases most significantly among three systems after the surface relaxation, it suggests that the impact of surface states is relevant to the change of the Pb–I bond length. The large Pb–I bond length in FAPbI3 can be ascribed to the larger FA cation at the A site. As a result, the reduction of the bandgap is also subtly affected by compositional engineering at the A site.

To probe the influence of the compositional engineering on the optical properties, the optical absorption coefficient and refractive index of the Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (x = 0, 0.5, and 1) surfaces were calculated through the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω),51 where ε1 and ε2 are the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric function, respectively. The frequency-dependent optical absorption coefficient (α(ω)) was derived from the following equation: (2)The refractive index (n(ω)) of the light absorbers also has a strong influence on light trapping, which is given by the following equation: (3)due to the distortion of the Pb–I frameworks after the mixing of FA and Cs, the optical properties of our systems become anisotropic. As such, both α(ω) and n(ω) along the x, y and z directions of all surfaces were calculated here. Since only the visible light regain is concerned for the practical application, the α(ω) and n(ω) values in the range of 300–800 nm are shown in Fig. 5. The visible light absorption coefficient and refractive index of the clean (001) surface along the x and y directions are almost identical, while those along the z-direction are distinctly different due to the breaking of the symmetry. Furthermore, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3(001) surfaces have similar optical properties. And the much different CsPbI3(001) surface can be ascribed to its smaller bandgap and higher symmetry. Especially, the α(ω) peaks of CsPbI3(001) along the x and y directions are sharper than those of the other two surfaces. And its highest peak with the visible light range locates at around 340 nm. Accordingly, the highest peaks of Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3(001) locate at around 350 and 370 nm, respectively. The α(ω) values of Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 are slightly larger than those of FAPbI3, which suggest better light absorption performance for Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3. In comparison with α(ω), the variation in n(ω) of the three surfaces is relatively small. The largest n peak of CsPbI3 locates at around 500 nm, which is slightly larger than those of Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3. It is worth noting that the optical properties are calculated based on the electronic structures of the systems. At the DFT-D3 level, the calculated electronic structures may differ greatly from the correct ones due to the limitation of semi-local XC functionals and the lack of consideration of SOC effects.17,44 Thus, the results presented here are for comparison only. Our comparative results confirm that the optical properties of the perovskite light absorbers, especially their light absorption coefficients, can be tuned by changing the composition of A cations of halide perovskites.

3.3 Adsorption of 3-butenoic acid molecules
Due to the instability of halide perovskites under humid conditions, the organic passivation layer, e.g. OA, has been widely used to block the adsorption of water. Thus, the theoretical understanding of the competitive adsorption properties is essential. Here, the energies of water and 3-butenoic acid molecules on these three surfaces were calculated with the 100% coverage of water or 3-butenoic acid on the Cs1−xFAxPbI3(001) surfaces. The 100% coverage is considered here to simulate the formation of the passivation layer on the top of the perovskite surfaces. Their optimized adsorption structures are displayed in Fig. 6. After the structural optimization, the water and 3-butenoic acid molecules are adsorbed on undercoordinated surface Pb atoms due to the existence of unoccupied p orbitals. For 3-butenoic acid molecules, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group (CO) is bonded with the surface Pb atoms.

Top panel: surfaces with adsorbed H2O; bottom panel: surfaces with adsorbed 3-butenoic acid. Colour code: Purple, I; dark grey, Pb; green, Cs; pink, H; brown, C; red, O; and light blue, N. The numbers represent bonds between two adsorbate molecules and the surface in a unit cell. 
The bond distances between the two adsorbates and surface Pb atoms are listed in Table 2. It is found that the bond lengths between the O atom in water and the surface Pb atoms are almost identical after the optimization. However, 3-butenoic acids have two different types of adsorption states, as evidenced by two different bond lengths between the O atoms in the adsorbates and the surface Pb atoms. This discrepancy of the adsorption properties between water and 3-butenoic acids suggests that the impact between the adsorbed water is smaller. As a comparison, the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions between 3-butenoic acids are considerably strong with the formation of the hydrogen bonds after structural optimization caused by their relatively large size. Consequently, their adsorption properties are also affected. For the three Cs1−xFAxPbI3(001) surfaces, the bond distances between the O atoms in the adsorbates and the surface Pb atoms are similar. It indicates that the A cation on the surface has a small impact on the adsorption properties of water and 3-butanoic acids.

The small relaxation of the top layer was found after the adsorption of 3-butenoic acid. For the CsPbI3(001) surface, the surface Pb–I bond lengths vary after the adsorption. The shortest one is 3.136 Å, which is 1.36% longer than that of the clean surface. However, for the Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3(001) surface, the shortest surface Pb–I bond length is 3.127 Å, which is 1.76% shorter than that of the pristine surface. A similar trend was found in the FAPbI3(001) surface with 4.13% shorter than the shortest surface Pb–I bond length. It suggests that the compositional engineering at the A site can affect the change of the surface Pb–I framework after the adsorption, which matches the conclusion from the analysis of the pristine surfaces.
Our results show that the adsorption energies (ΔEad) of the organic ligand on CsPbI3, Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3(001) surfaces are −0.90, −0.83 and −0.81 eV, which are 0.36, 0.33 and 0.31 eV lower than that of the H2O molecule on them, respectively, indicating that the adsorption strength of the organic molecule is about 150% stronger than that of water. Besides, the surface energy changes (Δγ) of all facets with 3-butenoic acid are calculated using the equation:52  where A is the surface area, and is −0.189 J m−2, −0.168 J m−2 and −0.159 J m−2 for CsPbI3, Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3(001) surfaces, respectively, illustrating that the adsorption of 3-butenoic acid reduces the surface energy distinctly. As a result, our results suggest that Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (x = 0, 0.5 and 1) perovskites with the surface passivation of 3-butenoic acid can block the damage of water molecules to the surface structure to stabilize it in moisture. This matches the experimental observation that such a kind of the passivation layer can greatly increase the moisture stability of the perovskite light absorbers.21,30–32
To further understand the effects of 3-butenoic acid-based passivation on electronic and optical properties for Cs1−xFAxPbI3(001) surfaces, their DOS, absorption spectra and refractive index were measured. Fig. 7 shows the DOS images around the Fermi level of three surfaces, which are similar to those of clean surfaces shown in Fig. 4. The biggest change is in the Eg values, which become larger after the surface passivation. The bandgaps of CsPbI3, Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3 and FAPbI3(001) surfaces increased by 12.6%, 7.7% and 17.4%, respectively. This indicates that the strong adsorption of 3-butenoic acid with the surface Pb atoms can remove the surface electronic states, which are formed due to the existence of the undercoordinated Pb atoms on the pristine surface. Interestingly, the calculated bandgaps of the surfaces with the adsorbed 3-butenoic acid are even larger than that of the bulk. This can be ascribed to the relatively small atomic models for the surfaces. The change of the Eg values, therefore, supports the strong adsorption of the 3-butenoic acid on the undercoordinated Pb atoms, which can successfully passivate the surface.

For the optical properties of the three Cs1−xFAxPbI3 (001) surfaces with adsorbed 3-butenoic acid molecules, there is a slight change between the passivated surfaces and clean surfaces of both the light absorption coefficient and the refractive index, as evidenced by Fig. 8. The α(ω) values of the three surfaces are slightly smaller than those of the clean ones, while the change of the values and shapes of n(ω) is negligible after 3-butenoic acid-based passivation. Consequently, it demonstrates that the adsorption of the 3-butenoic acid has few impacts on the overall optical properties of the Cs1−xFAxPbI3 perovskite surfaces.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the impacts of the A cation engineering in perovskite light absorbers and organic acid-based surface passivation on their performance have been theoretically investigated by virtue of the first principles DFT method. Our results reveal that the engineering of A cations is an effective approach to subtly tune the electronic and optical properties of light absorbers. The studies on their (001) surfaces demonstrate that the adsorption strength of 3-butenoic acid is much stronger than that of water. It suggests that the surface passivation using such organic molecules can effectively block the interaction of the surface with water molecules. Therefore, the surface can be stabilized after the surface passivation of organic molecules under humid conditions. While some surface electronic states can be removed after the surface passivation, it has a limited influence on their most desired optical properties for light absorption.2 Our findings, therefore, support that the engineering of A cations in ABX3 light absorbers and surface passivation using organic molecules are two promising strategies for the advance of perovskite solar cells.
