    , Accepted 26th December 2016First published on 29th December 2016AbstractTo effectively reduce and utilize the atmospheric CO2, electrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO using an efficient and stable cathode in a high temperature solid oxide electrolyzer has attracted extensive interest. A composite cathode based on lanthanum nickelate potentially opens up the possibility for CO2 electrolysis. Herein, we developed a new Ni-doped La(Sr)FeO3−δ material, which has been firstly fabricated as a cathode for CO2 electrolysis in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). The ultra-low total polarization resistance, together with an impressive current density of 1.21 A cm−2 at a potential of 1.55 V and 850 °C, demonstrates the superior electrocatalytic activity of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (LSFN) for stably and effectively promoting the cathodic kinetics for the CO2 electrolytic reaction. Moreover, an ultra-high Faraday efficiency of ∼99.7% was achieved at an applied potential of 1.0 V (vs. OCV) and 850 °C. The comparable cell performance for CO2 electrolysis benefits from the extension of the reactive sites due to the improved mixed ionic and electronic conductivity and accelerated adsorption and diffusion of the adsorbed active species, resulted from the high oxygen vacancy introduced on the LSFN backbone surface. Besides the comparable electrochemical performance, the excellent redox reversibility between the reduction and re-oxidation as well as considerable coking tolerance towards CO-enriched gas reveals that this newly prepared La(Sr)Fe(Ni) is a potential cathode material for SOEC, particularly for a direct carbon-abundant cell.
1. Introduction
The level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has significantly increased at an accelerating rate in the past few decades as a result of anthropogenic accumulation, consequently aggravating climate change and environmental issues.1 To weaken the greenhouse effects, the development of technologies for reducing CO2 emission or utilizing CO2 has attracted extensive studies worldwide. As an alternative artificial method of reducing the carbon footprint, high temperature CO2 reduction in an oxygen ion conducting solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is a promising path on the blueprint for future environmental sustainability and energy storage.2 Compared to electrochemical CO2 reduction at room temperature, SOEC is of great interest because of its following advantages: (1) it possesses an incomparably high Faraday efficiency since CO is the only product from CO2 reduction, (2) its high abundance, environmentally friendliness, and cost-effective transition metal oxides (perovskites) provide the possibility for practical utilization. Moreover, using electrical power generated from renewable sources, such as solar cells and wind turbines, the CO2 electrolysis reaction can convert these intermittent renewable energy sources into chemicals in the form of CO.3 In addition, the produced CO and O2, as the by-products from CO2 electrolysis, are generated in two different streams because of spatial separation by a dense electrolyte, and both of them have a wide range of applications in industrial processes.4,5 The challenge of this process lies in the design of a highly stable and effective catalyst that can accelerate the electrode reaction rate and consequently, increase the current utilization efficiency. The state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ cermet H2 electrode has been widely studied as the anode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) owing to its impressive catalytic properties.6 Because of the similarity to SOFCs, progress has been made in the development of high temperature SOEC using Ni-based cathodes.7,8 The Ni-based cermet also shows an excellent electrochemical performance for the conversion of CO2 with the desired electrocatalytic activity.9 Nevertheless, a fundamental material issue regarding the non-optimal redox stability of Ni-based cermet will possibly lead to the loss of electrical conductivity, performance degradation and delamination of the electrode and electrolyte.10–12 To avoid these issues, some perovskite oxide materials, which were reported to be promising anode materials with good redox stability in SOFC, have been utilized as potential cathode materials in SOEC. Perovskite-type oxides, such as La(Sr)Cr(M)O3−δ (M = Fe, Mn and Ni),10,13–18 and La(Sr)NO3−δ (N = Mn, Ti and Cr),11,19–21 have been demonstrated to be good cathode materials for CO2 or H2O electrolysis at elevated temperatures because of their sufficient electronic conductivity. However, the electrochemical performances of these materials are still poor compared to Ni-based materials because of the limited number of active sites (low electrocatalytic activity and insufficient electrical conductivity). Tatsumi et al. investigated many oxide materials with different structures as cathode materials for CO2 electrolysis and found that La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ with a perovskite structure showed a much higher electrocatalytic activity than the others.22 This is probably due to the high mixed ionic and electronic conductivity and surface activity for the electrochemical dissociation of CO2.23 However, the electrochemical performance of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ is still less satisfactory compared to Ni-based materials at elevated temperatures. The relatively low electronic conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ limits its further application as an electrode material in both SOFC24 and SOEC.22 If Fe is partially substituted with Ni (La0.6Sr0.4Ni1−xFexO3−δ), especially when x > 0.5, this material shows a high electronic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient that are close to those of the YSZ electrolytes.25,26 The high mixed ionic and electronic conductivity, good compatibility with electrolytes and thermal stability of La0.6Sr0.4Ni1−xFexO3−δ make it a potential electrode for SOFC.25,26 Nevertheless, La0.6Sr0.4Ni1−xFexO3−δ has not been applied for CO2 electrolysis yet. On the basis of its properties, it may be a promising cathode material for CO2 electrolysis at elevated temperatures.
In this work, we evaluated the potential of perovskite oxide La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (LSFN) as a cathode material for CO2 electrolysis at elevated temperatures with the aim of improving its electrocatalytic activity. The LSFN was fabricated as a cathode in a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte-supported SOEC. The redox stability, electrocatalytic activity, Faraday efficiency and coking resistance of the LSFN for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C and 850 °C were investigated, respectively.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1 Preparation of materials and characterization
Perovskite oxide powders of LSFN were prepared by a modified sol–gel method as described elsewhere.27 Stoichiometric amounts of La(NO3)3·6H2O, Sr(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were first dissolved in deionized water under continuous stirring, and an EDTA–NH3H2O combined solution was added, followed by the addition of citric acid. The molar ratio of EDTA:citric acid:total metal ions was controlled to be around 1:1.5:1. Subsequently, NH3H2O was added to adjust the pH value to around 8. The solution was stirred and heated on a hot plate at 80 °C until the organic resins formed. The synthesized gel decomposed at 300 °C for 4 h to remove the organic components and the nitrates. The precursor powders were then fired at 1100 °C for 10 h in air to obtain the final electrode materials. (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3−δ (LSCF) and Gd0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (GDC) powders were purchased from fuel cell materials Company (“http://fuelcellmaterials.com”). The electrode pastes were prepared by mixing the electrode materials and GDC at a weight ratio of 1:1 with a glue containing 1-butanol, benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol, followed by ball milling for 3 h.
The crystalline structure of the synthesized powders was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rigaku Rotaflex Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 44 mA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TA SDT Q600) was conducted at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 in different atmospheres from 20 to 900 °C to characterize the thermophysical properties. The microstructures were determined with a high-resolution Zeiss Sigma FE-SEM equipped with an EDX detector. The LSFN powders were also analyzed using a JEOL JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra) was used to investigate the surface chemistry of the LSFN powders with the adventitious carbon (C 1s) using a binding energy (BE) of 284.6 eV as the reference.
2.2 Cell fabrication and tests
The dimensions of the as-received commercial YSZ discs (“http://fuelcellmaterials.com”) were 250–300 μm in thickness and 25 mm in diameter. The GDC pastes were screen-printed on both sides of the YSZ disc and co-sintered at 1300 °C for 5 h to form GDC buffer layers. Both the cathode pastes and anode pastes were screen-printed onto the corresponding surfaces of the YSZ disc to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The MEA was sintered at 1100 °C for 4 h in air. Gold paste was painted onto the surfaces of both the anode and cathode to form the current collectors. The CO2 electrolysis cell was built by fixing the MEA between coaxial pairs of alumina tubes with a ceramic sealant (AREMCO 552). Dry CO2/CO (70:30) was fed to the cathode side at a flow rate of 40 mL min−1.
The electrochemical measurements were conducted using a four-probe method on a Solartron 1255 frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1286 electrochemical interface instrument after the temperature was slowly increased to the elevated temperatures. The polarization resistance of the CO2 electrolysis cell was determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured under an AC potential with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV at the stable open circuit voltage (OCV). The gases from the cathode stream were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard model HP5890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a packed column. A Nicolet Almega XR Dispersive Raman Microscope was used to evaluate the level of coke deposition and the formation of the secondary phase on the LSFN cathode after CO2 electrolysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterizations of as-obtained LSFN

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared LSFN powder after firing in air at 1100 °C for 10 h; the inset shows the enlarged region at the (200) phase. The as-prepared LSFN showed a single phase without any impurities, as identified by the XRD analysis and previously reported results.25,26 When compared to the standard structure of La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 (PDF # 54-1292), the diffraction peaks of LSFN after sintering in air were shifted to higher angles, as confirmed by the enlarged zone at the (200) phase where the diffraction angle increased from 46.73° to 46.95°. Normally, the substitutions of high spin Mn3+ (0.645 Å) and Mn4+ (0.53 Å) with Ni2+ (0.69 Å), which has a larger ionic radius, cause lower 2θ angles and increase the unit cell parameter. However, the reflection shift of LSFN to higher diffraction angles is an indication of decreased cell parameters with respect to the undoped material.28,29 This is due to the tensile or compressive strain formation derived from the defects created (vacancies, interstitials and local structure transformations) after the doping of Ni. A closer inspection of the (200) reflection shows peak shoulder formation, which in turn confirms the increased lattice distortion generation.30 In the meantime, the substitution of the B-site by the lower valence Ni cation gives corner-shared strings of BO6 octahedra and causes the formation of oxygen vacancies to maintain the electroneutrality (see the crystal structure in Fig. 1b and d). The Ni(IV)/Ni(III) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couples in (Ni)O6 and (Fe)O6 octahedral units can accept electrons while losing lattice oxygen, which is beneficial for electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. More importantly, the introduced oxygen vacancies can effectively improve the chemical adsorption ability of CO2 on the catalyst surface since oxygen vacancies act as host sites to accommodate and activate CO2 molecules.11,31 SEM and TEM analyses were also performed to acquire the surface morphological and compositional information, respectively. The microstructure of the as-obtained porous materials with a glossy surface is shown in Fig. 1c, and it shows that well interconnected nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼200 nm ensure sufficient gas diffusion pathways and mechanical strength. The crystal lattice analysis of LSFN in conjunction with the diffractogram of the selected domain in Fig. 1d was conducted and is shown in Fig. 1e. The measured lattice space of 0.292 nm corresponds to the value determined by the XRD analysis at the (110) planes of the LSFN perovskite. It is indexed as a cubic crystalline structure in the space group of Pmm (221). Therefore, the high-resolution analysis combined with the diffractogram confirms the structure of the as-prepared LSFN after firing in air.

3.2 Redox stability evaluation
For a typical high temperature SOEC for CO2 electrolysis, the local CO2 starvation that results from the insufficient adsorption of the linear CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface always leads to an increased electrode polarization,12 and consequently degrades the cell performance and current utilization efficiency, especially at a high applied potential.11,32 The non-polar CO2 molecules are chemically difficult to be adsorbed and activated on active sites at elevated temperatures. Currently, the bottleneck for direct CO2 electrolysis is improving CO2 chemical adsorption on the surface of the catalyst backbone and the redox stability. Recently, introducing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst backbone has been proposed to raise the potential for accommodating and activating CO2 molecules on these defective sites.11,31 Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that oxygen vacancies can promote absorption of small molecules, such as CO2, if they tend to get ordered in a special manner.33 A lower oxidation state of B-site cations in the cubic structure is expected to have more oxygen vacancies and more space for accommodating CO2 molecules.34 Because the Ni-enriched regions have a relatively large oxygen deficiency due to the lower average coordination number of Ni in the lattice, this will lead to a decrease in the average valence state and improve the chemical absorption ability of CO2 in these defect-rich sites.35 To evaluate the oxygen vacancy content and redox stability of LSFN, TGA measurements were conducted in different atmospheres from 20 to 900 °C. The weight losses of LSFN in Ar and CO2 as a function of temperature were recorded in Fig. 2a. The gradual weight loss (∼0.24 wt%) below 200 °C can be attributed to the desorption of H2O. With continuously increasing temperatures (<375 °C), LSFN suffers from weight loss in both Ar and CO2 flows. However, the weight change of LSFN in CO2 experienced a slightly faster decrease compared to that in Ar. This can be attributed to the combination of the partial loss of the lattice oxygen, which was reported by Cheng36 to be due to the presence of CO2, and the CO2 desorption upon continuous heating.37 With the temperature increasing, the adsorption and desorption rates of CO2 on LSFN reached equilibrium, resulting in almost overlapping curves for both Ar and CO2. On the basis of Wagner's theory and the decreased weight of LSFN,38 the calculated non-stoichiometry δ is 0.17, which indicates that the oxygen vacancies will be further generated in the CO2 flow at high temperatures. Currently, the majority of cathode materials employed in SOEC predominately originates from anode materials in more technologically advanced SOFC, but they are operated in the reverse mode.39,40 Therefore, it is more desirable if the developed materials have good redox stability for efficient operation in both SOEC and SOFC modes at reducing and oxidizing conditions, respectively. The reversibility of LSFN during the redox cycle was established to evaluate the stability of LSFN in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres by TGA. The as-prepared LSFN was reduced in a 5% H2/N2 flow at an elevated temperature up to 900 °C, cooled down in the same gas flow to room temperature, and was subsequently re-oxidized when heated back to 900 °C in air, as shown in Fig. 2b. The thermogravimetric analysis indicated that a weight loss of 4.84% and a weight gain of 4.79% were observed in the reduction and re-oxidation conditions, respectively, corresponding to a loss and uptake of oxygen vacancies (δ) of 0.67. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also conducted to analyze the adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen before and after a stability test for over 36 h, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The XPS survey spectra confirm the presence of La, Sr, Fe and Ni for both samples, as shown in Fig. 2c. The partial difference in the XPS spectra after the test (Fig. 2c2) mainly originates from the contributions of GDC and the current collector (Au) since GDC was mixed with LSFN in a weight ratio of 1:1 to further increase the triple phase boundaries, and Au was employed as the current collector. Typically, the peaks at the binding energies of ∼528 eV and ∼531 eV correspond to the lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the measured samples, as marked in Fig. 2d. Moreover, the adsorbed oxygen is related to the surface oxygen vacancies. Apparently, a decrease in the lattice oxygen was observed after the test (Fig. 2d2) compared to before the test (Fig. 2d1). This confirms the TGA analysis that oxygen vacancies will be further generated under the experimental conditions in the mixture of CO2/CO gas. The quantitative analysis of the lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the surface of LSFN before and after stability is summarized in Table 2. It was found that the adsorbed oxygen increased by 8.83% after the stability test, which matches the decrease in the lattice oxygen (8.83%). This indicates that the increased oxygen vacancies were all derived from the decrease in the lattice oxygen, and consequently contributed to the high electrochemical performance (see the analysis for Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the symmetry of the weight change of LSFN suggests an excellent redox stability between the reduction and re-oxidation cycles.

3.3 Electrochemical performance for CO2 electrolysis
Its remarkable variability in oxygen vacancy content and good reversibility under cyclic conditions make LSFN a potential candidate for application in SOEC. To evaluate the feasibility and electrochemical performance of LSFN as a cathode for CO2 electrolysis, we exemplify its application for a YSZ electrolyte support SOEC operating at elevated temperatures. The cathode side was fed with CO2/CO (70:30) as a feedstock at a flow rate of 40 mL min−1, and the anode was exposed to ambient air. Fig. 3a shows the temperature dependent I–V curves for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C and 850 °C. The current density sharply increased with the rising applied potential for the cell with LSFN at 800 °C and 850 °C, and it reached a maximum current density of approximately 0.85 A cm−2 and 1.21 A cm−2 at a potential of 1.55 V, respectively. These values are comparable to those reported recently for cells using PrBaMn2O5+δ (0.85 A cm−2)40 and La(Sr)Cr(Fe)-based materials (0.82 A cm−2)41 at 850 °C at the same applied potential, indicating the effectiveness of LSFN for CO2 electrolysis. This in turn verifies that the partial substitution of Fe by Ni improves the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity, as discussed in Fig. 1 and 3. Additionally, the accelerated reaction rate at 850 °C can be attributed to an increase in the temperature dependent ionic conductivity of both the LSFN and electrolyte, which consequently leads to a better performance at higher temperatures. More importantly, the I–V curves transiting smoothly from the SOFC mode to the SOEC mode further indicated that the developed LSFN material possesses a good redox reversibility under reduction and oxidation conditions, which is good agreement with the analysis in Fig. 2b. To further investigate the factors credited for the enhanced electrochemical performance, AC impedance spectroscopy was carried out at different temperatures. The impedance spectra of the cell with LSFN at 800 °C and 850 °C under open circuit conditions and the simulated results using the attached equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 3b. Apparently, a feasible fitting was achieved with two parallel circuits of the resistor and capacitor connected in series with another resistor, where the Rs and Rp correspond to the series resistance and total electrode polarizations (R1 + R2) of the cell, respectively. The corresponding simulated values of each element are summarized in Table 1. As seen, the positive imaginary part of the Nyquist plot stretches from a linear response in the high frequency region to two overlapped small semi-circular arcs. In the meantime, both Rs and Rp decrease with the rising temperature, which results in the remarkable improvement in the cell performance. The high frequency arc (R1) drops slightly from 0.1461 Ω cm2 at 800 °C to 0.0977 Ω cm2 at 850 °C, whereas the low frequency arc (R2) falls significantly when the temperature increases, i.e., R2 is only 0.0007 Ω cm2 at 850 °C, 20 times lower than that at 800 °C. More importantly, it has been proposed that the low frequency arc probably reflects the adsorption and diffusion of adsorbed active species on the cathode surface for CO2 electrolysis.42 Dissimilarly, the high frequency arc is a sign for the charge transfer in the electrolysis reaction. As previously discussed, the LSFN is a mixed conductor cathode,24 suggesting that both electrons and oxygen ions can possibly pass through the cathode. This means that the decrease in the total polarizations is derived from the extension of the reactive sites (related to R1) in conjunction with the accelerated adsorption and diffusion of the adsorbed active species (related to R2) on the LSFN backbone surface. As a result, the increased active species on the LSFN and the accelerative charge transfer contribute to the enhanced electrochemical performance when the operating temperature increases. To evaluate the current utilization efficiency, potential static tests at different applied potentials (vs. OCV) were also carried out. The responses of the current densities at different applied potentials were recorded as a function of time, as presented in Fig. 3c. It is discernible that the current densities increased in step with an increase in the corresponding applied potentials. However, the tendency to increase reduces gradually, which is attributed to the starvation effect of CO2 in the feedstock and restrained oxygen evolution at the anode side.43 Additionally, the electrolytic products at different applied potentials were also analyzed with online GC. The formation rates of CO and corresponding Faraday efficiencies at different applied potentials were calculated, as indicated in Fig. 3d. It can be seen that the formation rates of CO reached 16.8 and 18.7 mL min−1 at the potentials of 0.8 and 1.0 V (vs. OCV), respectively. However, a slight decrease was observed at 1.2 V (vs. OCV) because of the starvation of CO2 in the feedstock, which matches the analysis in Fig. 3c. The corresponding, calculated Faraday efficiencies of the cell with LSFN at 850 °C increased from 94.6% at 0.4 V (vs. OCV) to 98.4% at 0.8 V (vs. OCV), and reached a peak value of 99.7% at 1.0 V (vs. OCV). In contrast to most studies in the literature,16,41,44 the Faraday efficiencies were considerably higher than the reported values so far. The remarkable electrocatalytic ability for effectively converting CO2 to CO and corresponding comparable current utilization efficiency of the cell further verify the promising use of LSFN as a cathode material for CO2 electrolysis at elevated temperatures.

3.4 Durability test and coking resistance evaluation
The degradation of electrode materials over time for both SOEC and SOFC remains a challenge; therefore, durability is critical for their commercialization in the energy market and industrial applications, especially when using hydrocarbon or carbon-enriched gases as a feedstock. To examine the stability towards a CO-abundant mixture gas, a potentiostatic test was conducted for over 36 h under a constant applied potential load of 0.6 V (vs. OCV) at 850 °C, and the corresponding curve of the current density as a function of time is presented in Fig. 4a. When the mixture gas of CO2/CO (70:30) was supplied to the cathode compartment, the cell achieved a stable response of a current density of ∼1.02 A cm−2 without noticeable degradation for more than 36 h, indicating that the LSFN cathode has good stability under the experimental conditions. Besides the requirement of good stability, cathode materials in SOEC also require strong tolerance of carbon formation under the operating conditions. The good durability of LSFN without performance degradation also demonstrates its excellent coking resistance. This is unlike the conventional Ni-based catalyst on which carbon can easily build up when directly operating in a CO-enriched gas, resulting in the consequent degradation of the electrode performance.5,45 To further verify this, ex situ Raman spectroscopy was carried out on the cathode side of the cell with LSFN before and after the stability test. Representative Raman spectra on the cathode surfaces are recorded in Fig. 4b. Apparently, no observable carbon peaks were detected for the cell after the stability test at 1346 cm−1 and 1561 cm−1, which are correlated with defect-induced Raman features and sp2-bonded carbons,46 respectively. The obtained spectra for LSFN after the test are almost the same as the referential one before the test, which further suggests that LSFN possesses good coking resistance towards the gas mixture. Recently, the group of Tatsumi Ishihara found that small peaks were assigned to SrCO3 based on the Raman spectra when investigating the La(Sr)Fe(Mn) as an active catalyst for CO2 electrolysis.5 It has also been suggested that for La(Sr)Co(Fe) perovskites,47 the surface segregation of Sr in these materials might explicate the reason. However, no peaks were observed for our material after the stability test at 1100 cm−1 in Fig. 4 compared to the peaks of pure SrCO3, as clearly shown in the inset. This means that SrCO3 was not formed on the surface of the cathode during the short-term stability test of the CO2 electrolysis, which was further confirmed by the XRD pattern collected on the cathode side after the stability test (Fig. 4c). Therefore, it was concluded that LSFN is stable under the experimental conditions, and the reduction of CO2 proceeds stably in the electrolysis mode for the cell with the LSFN cathode at the elevated temperatures.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a new Ni-doped La(Sr)FeO3−δ cathode material was developed using a modified sol–gel method, and it was fabricated as the cathode for high temperature CO2 electrolysis in a SOEC. It demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity for stably and effectively promoting SOEC cathode performance. The total polarization resistance reached as low as 0.0984 Ω cm2 at 850 °C, reflecting an extension of the reactive sites, an accelerated adsorption and diffusion of the adsorbed active species on the LSFN backbone surface. This consequently contributes to a comparable performance with an impressive current density of 1.21 A cm−2 at a potential of 1.55 V. More importantly, the current utilization efficiency achieves an ultra-high value of ∼99.7% at an applied potential of 1.0 V (vs. OCV) and 850 °C. The improved mixed ionic and electronic conductivity resulted from the high content of the introduced oxygen vacancies, and the increased activated CO2 molecules collectively contributed to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis. Particularly, the excellence of redox reversibility between the reduction and re-oxidation cycles suggests a good redox stability in both the SOFC and SOEC modes. Also, no degradation was observed during the stability test, which is indicative of a high coking tolerance towards CO-enriched gas. We, therefore, conclude that La(Sr)Fe(Ni) can potentially be used to fabricate electrodes in solid oxide cells, especially for directly hydrocarbon-fueled or carbon-enriched cells.
