, Accepted 1st August 2014First published on 1st August 2014AbstractIn order to increase the electron-donating ability of the donor part of the organic dye, the dithiafulvenyl (DTF) group as an additional electron donor is introduced into a triphenylamine (TPA) unit to form a donor–donor (2D) structure in this paper. Two new organic dyes WD9 (one 2-cyanoacetic acid as an electron acceptor) and WD11 (two 2-cyanoacetic acids as electron acceptors) containing this DTF–TPA 2D structure are designed, synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It is found that the double donor structures (DTF–TPA) not only contribute to enhancement of the electron-donating ability, but also inhibit aggregation between dye molecules and prevent I3− in the electrolyte from recombining with injected electrons in TiO2. Under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), a maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.09% is obtained for the WD11-based DSSC, higher than that of DTF-free dye L0 (η = 2.47%). These results have demonstrated that the incorporation of the DTF group into the organic dye will be an effective approach to develop high-performance metal-free organic dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently attracting considerable attention because of their high light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies, ease of fabrication, and low production costs.1 As the key component of DSSCs, organic metal-free donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) sensitizers have been extensively exploited for their environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and more importantly, the flexibility of molecular design with easily tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties.2 Squaraine,3–6 coumarin,7–10 indoline,11–14 triphenylamine,15–18 phenothiazine,19–22 fluorene,23–25 carbazole26–29 and tetrahydroquinoline30,31 based organic dyes have been developed and showed good performances.
Among the organic dyes, due to their 3D nonplanar structures, triphenylamine (TPA) and its derivatives have been widely used as sensitizers and displayed promising properties in the development of DSSCs, because the TPA unit suppresses the aggregation of the dye molecules.32 Besides, dithiafulvene (DTF) can be regarded as a smaller version of the fulvene family characterized by a terminal electron-donating group.33 It has been proved to be an excellent candidate as donor segment of organic dye because of its strong electron-donating ability. Some sensitizers containing DTF unit as donor have been synthesized and shown very promising performances.34–36 These works indicate that the DTF- and TPA-based dyes are promising candidates for high performance DSSCs.
In this work, our research focuses on further increasing electron-donating ability of donor part to optimize the light-harvesting capability. Our strategy is introduction of DTF group as additional donor into simple D–π–A TPA organic dye L0. So, two 2D-type organic dyes (WD9 and WD11) containing different numbers of electron acceptors (2-cyanoacetic acid) were designed, synthesized and applied in DSSCs. The chemical structures of these dyes are shown in Fig. 1. The influences of number of electron acceptors in DTF–TPA dyes on DSSC performances have been investigated. The overall conversion efficiencies (η) of the DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11 are 2.47%, 3.78% and 4.09%, respectively. An increase in η of about 66% was obtained from simple TPA dye L0 to WD11. The performance improvement of 2D-type organic dyes is due to the following two reasons: firstly, the absorption region can be extended and the molar extinction coefficient can be enhanced comparing with the D–π–A structure. Secondly, they benefit from lower tendency to aggregate.

Fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cells
TiO2 colloid was prepared according to the literature.41 The FTO glass substrates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aq. at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The 12 μm thick mesoporous nano-TiO2 films composed of 15–20 nm anatase TiO2 particles were coated on the FTO glass plates by doctor blade. After drying the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer at 125 °C, a 4 μm thick second layer of 300–500 nm sized light scattering anatase particles (Shanghai Cai Yu Nano Technology Co., Ltd) was deposited by doctor blade onto the first layer. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. After the sintering, when the temperature cooled to about 90 °C, the electrodes were immersed in dye baths containing 0.2 mM WD dyes with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid in methanol and left overnight. The films were then rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dyes. Solar cells were assembled, using a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame, with platinized counter electrodes which were prepared by sputter-depositing 99.99% Pt on FTO glasses, using a Hitachi E-1030 Pt sputtering system at 20 mA for 200 s. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through the hole predrilled in the counter electrode, and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass coverslip. The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.3 M HMII, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in MPN.
Photovoltaic measurements
The irradiation source for the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co., USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2. Volt–current characteristics were performed on a Model 2611 sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., USA). A Keithley 2611 sourcemeter and a Model spectrapro 300i monochromator (Acton research, USA) equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp (Aosiyuan Technology & Science Co., Ltd, China) were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained by using Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system under dark condition, with forward bias −0.6 V and frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz.

In methanol solution, the UV-vis spectra of L0, WD9 and WD11 exhibit maximal absorption wavelengths (λmax) at 407, 413 and 433 nm with molar absorption coefficients of 16230, 26300 and 27400 M−1 cm−1, respectively. These absorption peaks mainly arise from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron donor part and the electron acceptor moiety. Due to increasing electron-donating ability by introducing a DTF group into dye L0 as additional donor, the λmax of WD9 was red-shifted 6 nm compared with that of L0. Furthermore, the λmax of WD11 which is constructed by introducing one 2-cyanoacetic acid into WD9 was red-shifted 20 nm compared with that of WD9. This is because the increase of electron acceptor is beneficial to intramolecular charge transfer. It can be obviously noticed that the absorption intensities of the dyes increase with introducing DTF and 2-cyanoacetic acid successively. It is known that a wider and stronger absorption is favorable to the performance of DSSC, as more photons can be harvested. According to the λmax and molar extinction coefficients of these dyes, it is clear that the abilities for light harvesting are increased in the order of L0 < WD9 < WD11, which would lead to the highest photocurrent of DSSC based on dye WD11.
Fig. 3 shows the absorbance profiles of the dyes anchoring on 3 μm thick TiO2 films after 2 h adsorption. The spectra changing tendencies of the organic dyes are in accordance with their UV-vis absorption spectra in methanol solution. Compared to the spectra in methanol, the sharp shift of absorption peaks for WD9 and WD11 on TiO2 films has not been observed (Table 1). This may be ascribed to the DTF–TPA 2D structure, which could decrease unfavorable aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. In addition, the onset points of the absorption spectra are about 530 nm for L0, 550 nm for WD9 and 590 nm for WD11. After being adsorbed on TiO2 films, the absorption bands of WD9 and WD11 are broader by 20 and 60 nm than that of L0. The broadening of the absorption spectra of dyes when anchoring on TiO2 might be also due to dye–TiO2 interactions, dye–dye interactions, or both of them on the TiO2 surface.42,43
In order to investigate the anchoring mode of double electron acceptor dye WD11, FT-IR spectrum was performed on the TiO2 surface and compared with that of the free dyes (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  FT-IR spectra of (a) free WD11 and (b) WD11 stained TiO2 (∼3 μm) film. 
FT-IR spectrum of the WD11 dye measured as a solid sample shows the CO stretching band at 1709 cm−1 assigned to the carboxylic acid groups of free WD11. The band associated to CN of 2-cyanoacetic acid group was observed at 2224 cm−1. FT-IR spectrum of the WD11 adsorbed on nanoporous TiO2 film shows the CN band remains unchanged, indicating that the cyano group is not involved in anchoring the sensitizer. The CO band was found to has disappeared in the FT-IR spectrum of WD11 adsorbed on TiO2 film, indicating the carboxylic acid group is dissociated and involved in adsorption on the TiO2 surface. These data clearly show the absence of free carboxylic acid groups and thus confirm adsorption of the two carboxylic acid groups onto the TiO2 surface.
Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer between the TiO2/dye/redox electrolyte systems, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in methanol by using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. The first oxidation potential of the dyes (Eox) corresponds to the HOMO energy levels of the dyes. The energy level of LUMO was calculated by Eox − E0–0.44 E0–0 was determined by 1240/λ, in which λ is from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectrum. The electrochemical data of these dyes are listed in Table 1. Compared to L0, WD9 contains a DTF group, which increases its HOMO energy level. It is noteworthy that the LUMO energy levels of L0 and WD9 are almost the same because of the same electron acceptor. The HOMO energy level of WD11 is further increased compared with that of WD9. While the big difference of the LUMO energy levels of WD9 and WD11 is due to the different number of electron acceptors.
As Fig. 5 shown, LUMO energy levels of the dyes (L0: –1.55 V; WD9: –1.54 V; WD11: –1.25 V vs. NHE) are higher than the CB level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE) and HOMO levels of the dyes (L0: 1.04 V; WD9: 1.15 V; WD11: 1.25 V vs. NHE) are more positive than the I3−/I− redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE). So, the excited electrons of the dyes could inject into TiO2 efficiently and the oxidized dye molecules could be regenerated effectively by getting electrons from the I−.
 Fig. 5  Schematic energy levels of all dyes. 
Molecular orbital calculation
To get a further insight of the geometrical configurations, electron distributions and molecular orbitals of the dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with Gaussian 09.45
The optimized structures and electron distributions of these dyes in vacuum were carried out by using B3LYP/6-31G*. The results are shown in Table 2. According to the optimized structures, we can find that the steric hindrances of donor parts of WD9 and WD11 increase with the introduction DTF groups into the dye L0, which could prevent unfavorable aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. The LUMO levels are mainly located on the linker and 2-cyanoacetic acid. The anchoring group (–COOH) of these dyes has sizable contributions to the LUMO, which could lead to a strong electronic coupling with TiO2 surface and boost the electron injection efficiency. The electron distribution in L0 at HOMO is concentrated on the whole dye molecule while those of WD9 and WD11 are mainly delocalized on DTF–TPA part. Compared with L0, the electron distributions in WD9 and WD11 between HOMO and LUMO show better electron-separated states, which is conducive to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition.

Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of DSSCs based on the organic dyes L0, WD9 and WD11. The IPCE spectra changing tendencies of these dyes are in accordance with their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. However, the onsets of the IPCE spectra for L0, WD9 and WD11 are 582, 630 and 673 nm, respectively, which are significantly broadened, as compared with those of 530, 550 and 590 nm for their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 films. The thickness of the film, the scattering effect of the large particles in the film and the reflective effect of the Pt counter electrode can be considered as possible explanations for the broader IPCE than the UV-vis spectrum of the TiO2 film.46 In the DSSC based on L0, the IPCE value no exceeded 64% over the whole wavelength range (with the highest value of 64% at 450 nm). The IPCE values of DSSCs based on WD9 and WD11 exceeded 64% from 430 nm to 495 nm (with the highest value of 66% at 465 nm) and from 440 to 507 nm (with the highest value of 68% at 470 nm), respectively. In comparison with L0 and WD9, WD11 gives the highest and broadest IPCE value, which implies the dye would show the largest photocurrent in corresponding DSSC. The best IPCE value of WD11 might attribute to the highest molar extinction coefficient and broadest absorption region.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11. 
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on the three dyes performed under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 7. Table 3 lists the performance statistics of the DSSCs fabricated using these dyes as the sensitizers. The solar cell based on L0 shows an efficiency of 2.47%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 5.48 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 617 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.73. One DTF unit is introduced as additional donor into dye L0 to construct WD9, the increase in performance of the solar cell based on WD9 was achieved (η = 3.78%, Jsc = 8.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 634 mV, and ff = 0.72). In addition, incorporation of the second 2-cyanoacetic acid as an extra electron acceptor seems to improve the efficiency of the DSSC for dye WD11 (η = 4.09%, Jsc = 8.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 645 mV, and ff = 0.72).

It is clear that the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs can be evidently affected by the DTF and 2-cyanoacetic acid units in these dyes. Obviously, in comparison with L0, WD9 and WD11 give the higher Jsc, which is probably due to the better abilities for light harvesting of the two dyes, and this result is consistent with that of IPCE measurement. Furthermore, the 2D structures of WD9 and WD11 also can decelerate the charge recombination in the charge-separated state and reduce the tendency of aggregation resulting in the higher Voc.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies
To further elucidate the photovoltaic results, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was employed to study interface charge transfer processes in DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11.47,48 The Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11 in the dark. 
The larger semicircles in lower-frequency reflect the recombination resistance (Rrec) at TiO2/electrolyte interface. Obviously, the radius of the semicircles are decreased in the order of WD11 > WD9 > L0, indicating that the device sensitized by WD11 exhibits the largest resistance between the TiO2 surface and electrolyte. Thus under the same working condition, it is reasonable to conclude that the electron density of the EC keep the trend WD11 > WD9 > L0. As we know, the Voc was determined by the potential of the redox shuttle and the EF. According to the formula: EF = EC + kTln(nc/NC),49 where EF and EC are the Fermi energy and the conduction band edge energy, respectively, kT is the thermal energy, nc is the density of conduction band electrons, and NC is the effective density of conduction band states, we can conclude from the formula that the Voc could be in accordance with the trend of WD11 > WD9 > L0. The results of Nyquist plots are in good agreement with Voc results of the DSSCs based on these dyes: WD11 (645 mV) > WD9 (634 mV) > L0 (617 mV).
In the Bode plots (Fig. 9), the lower-frequency peak is indicative of the charge-transfer process of injected electrons in TiO2. The highest Voc of DSSC based on WD11 can be further explained by electron lifetime, calculated through the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of lower-frequency range in Bode plot). For the three devices, the peak frequency of lower-frequency range decreased in the order of L0 > WD9 > WD11, and the electron lifetime was enhanced in reverse with the calculated values of 12.41, 16.18 and 19.89 ms, respectively. Thus, WD11 has the longest electron lifetime, indicative of a most effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc due to reduced charge recombination rate.
 Fig. 9  Bode plots for DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11 in the dark. 
The results of EIS are in good agreement with photovoltaic results of the DSSCs based on these dyes and indicate that the introduction of the DTF unit in simple triphenylamine dye could improve photovoltaic performance.
Conclusions
In order to improve photovoltaic performance of the TPA dye L0, the DTF group as additional electron donor is introduced into dye L0 to form a donor–donor (2D) structure. Organic dyes WD9 and WD11 based on this 2D structure are designed, synthesized and applied in DSSCs. It is found that the 2D structures not only contribute to enhancement of the electron-donating ability, but also inhibit aggregation between dye molecules and prevent I3− in the electrolyte from recombining with injected electrons in TiO2. Under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the η of the DSSCs based on L0, WD9 and WD11 are 2.47%, 3.78% and 4.09%, respectively. An increase in η of about 66% was obtained from simple DTF-free dye L0 to WD11. These results have demonstrated that the incorporation of DTF group into the organic dye will be an effective approach to develop high-performance metal-free organic dyes. The best efficiency among the three DSSCs is 4.09%, which is not a high value compared with the highest efficiency of DSSC based on metal-free organic dye. This is mainly due to the narrow absorption ranges of WD dyes in the visible region. Further structural optimization, such as broadening the absorption spectra and tuning the energy levels, is very likely to generate more efficient sensitizers and this work is currently underway in our laboratory.
