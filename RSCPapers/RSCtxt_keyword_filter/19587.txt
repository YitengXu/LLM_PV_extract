    , Accepted 23rd July 2017First published on 24th July 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently attracted considerable interest for application in solar cells due to their low cost, high absorption coefficient and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, we utilize a CdSe quantum dot/PCBM composite as an electron transport layer (ETL) to investigate the structure, stability and PCE of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells. It is found that adsorption of the CdSe/PCBM composite reduces the roughness of the perovskite, leading to a high-quality film with a compact morphology. Density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations show that CdSe enhances the chemical stability of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx involving strong atomic orbital hybridization. Interestingly, an inorganic-terminated perovskite surface has much stronger interaction with CdSe compared to the surface with organic CH3NH3 termination, with noticeable interfacial charge redistribution. Experiments on solar cells incorporating the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL show enhanced photocurrent and fill factor, which is related to the in-built electric field between CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CdSe that greatly facilitates the separation of electron and hole pairs. We show an improved PCE of 13.7% with enhanced device stability in a highly humid atmosphere. These joint theoretical–experimental results may provide a new aspect for improving the structural stability and operating performance of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite structures.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Cl or Br) and their mixed structures have attracted great attention since the first report on perovskite sensitized solar cells in 2009. These materials have many unique advantages including direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and low cost.1–5 CH3NH3PbX3 has been proposed to be a flawless light absorber in perovskite solar cells, which was shown to demonstrate a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20%.6,7 To achieve efficient charge extraction in perovskite solar cells, it is crucial that the perovskite is in contact with an electron/hole transport layer with superior electrical properties. Recent research has mainly focused on developing high-efficiency hole transport materials, such as organic materials including PEDOT:PSS, spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT,8–10 or inorganic materials including CuInS2, CuSCN and PbS.11–13 Unfortunately, integration of these materials is usually accompanied by low device stability. On the other hand, electron transport materials have also been explored in the literature. For instance, TiO2 and ZnO have been used as an electron transport layer (ETL).14,15 Recent studies on inverted perovskite solar cells by using [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the ETL have reached a PCE of over 15%.16 Despite these studies, however, it remains a challenge to mitigate the material degradation of halide perovskites due to their intrinsic reactivity towards oxygen and water under operating conditions.17 Therefore, it is of great promise and significance to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells and enhance their structural stability simultaneously by optimizing the electron transport material.
In recent years, quantum dots (QDs) have been widely applied in photovoltaics due to their remarkable properties including tunable band gap, inherently high absorption coefficient, hot electron transfer and multiple exciton generation.18–20 As one typical example, CdSe QDs have been synthesized and extensively studied for various applications.21–24 Efficient solar cells sensitized with CdSe QDs have been fabricated, with plenty of extraordinary optoelectronic properties.25 In this work, we propose to use the CdSe QD/PCBM composite, which can be synthesized by a facile solvent processing method to form high-quality films, to potentially improve the conductivity of the ETL with efficient electron extraction and transportation for high-performance CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (x ∼ 1–3) perovskite solar cells. As CdSe is chemically stable and has superior hydrophobicity, we also expect to improve the device stability by incorporating the CdSe/PCBM composite.
We investigated the crystallinity and morphology of the CdSe/PCBM composite on the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite, and systematic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to explore the atomic geometry and electronic properties of the interface structure between CdSe and the perovskite. It is found that a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film adsorbed with the CdSe/PCBM composite has reduced roughness with a compact morphology. DFT calculations show enhanced structural stability involving strong atomic orbital hybridization between CdSe and the perovskite. Interestingly, we found that a perovskite (001) surface with inorganic termination has orders of magnitude stronger interaction with CdSe compared to the surface with organic CH3NH3 termination, which contributes to the high quality of the perovskite film. Perovskite solar cells using the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL exhibit an optimal PCE of 13.7% with a content of 5% CdSe in the composite, significantly higher than that of the control perovskite solar cell with pure PCBM as the ETL. The physical origin of the improved PCE is related to a CdSe doping induced in-built electric field between CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CdSe, leading to efficient electron-hole separation that further enhances the photocurrent and PCE of the device, as demonstrated by both DFT calculations and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. These results may shed light on future exploration of new structures for high-performance perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
We first synthesized the CdSe/PCBM composite on top of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film, which itself sits on top of an indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. We can clearly see that diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with pure PCBM and the CdSe/PCBM composite are nearly the same, as both show strong diffraction peaks located at 14.11°, 28.41° and 43.21°, which could be assigned to the (110), (220) and (330) planes of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (Fig. 1a). Besides, there is an excess of PbI2 in the prepared samples as evidenced by the small peak at 12.8° that belongs to the (001) plane of PbI2, which is consistent with previous reports.26 It is also found that the synthesized samples absorb a wide range of visible light up to 780 nm (Fig. 1b), indicating the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film on the ITO substrate.

Fig. 2a and b show a top view of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pure PCBM and the CdSe/PCBM composite on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films. Apparently, the CdSe/PCBM composite has penetrated into CH3NH3PbI3−xClx pore volumes and formed a homogeneous and dense capping layer. We characterized the surface morphology by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), with the images shown in Fig. 2c and d. Compared to the deposition of pure PCBM, we found that the surface of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx became much smoother with the deposition of the CdSe/PCBM composite, as the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreased dramatically from 59.3 nm (with pure PCBM) to about 6.0 nm (with CdSe/PCBM composite). Therefore, adsorption of the CdSe/PCBM composite improves the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film and reduces the surface traps, which may be of great benefit for effective transportation of charge carriers into electrodes in solar cells, as we shall see later.

To study the atomic structures of the CdSe/PCBM composite deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) to characterize the synthesized structure. As shown in Fig. 2e, uniform CdSe QDs with a particle size of ∼10 nm are accumulated on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. It can be clearly seen that CdSe QDs have an interplanar distance of 3.5 Å, which corresponds to the (002) crystal plane of CdSe. The interplanar distance of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was measured to be 3.1 Å, corresponding to the (220) plane of the perovskite. Interestingly, HRTEM in Fig. 2f shows a direct contact between CdSe and the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite with a clear interface, suggesting that CdSe QDs are adsorbed on the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx surface. It should be noted that QDs are normally capped with insulating ligands, which may prevent direct contact between CdSe and the perovskite. However, our HRTEM images show a clear interface between them, which is due to the fact that ligands of QDs are usually mobile, especially in PCBM. When they are deposited on the perovskite, these surface ligands are segregated or partially detached, which allows direct contact between CdSe and the perovskite. Our Raman spectra (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) of CdSe QDs, PCBM and the CdSe/PCBM composite show that the peak intensity of the CdSe/PCBM composite reduced significantly compared to that of pure CdSe QDs, suggesting that surface ligands of QDs are influenced by PCBM. Such segregation or detachment of surface ligands helps direct hybridization between CdSe QDs and the perovskite.
The chemical composition of the synthesized structure was analyzed via Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† It was confirmed that Se, I, Pb, C and O elements are present in the structure, suggesting the formation of the CdSe/PCBM composite on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. We also performed XRD, TEM/HRTEM and other characterizations for pure CdSe QDs, with the results shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† It was found that there are strong diffraction peaks located at 27.1°, 45.8° and 55.8°, which could be assigned to the (101), (103) and (202) planes of CdSe. A PL emission wavelength is located at 501 nm under excitation of UV (365 nm) with a full width at half-maximum around 22 nm, and UV-vis spectra of CdSe QDs obviously show a significant absorption peak at around 492 nm. These characteristics are in good agreement with the available results.27,28
In order to get deeper insight into the detailed structure and stability of the synthesized CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film with the CdSe/PCBM composite, we now turn to use DFT calculations to explore the atomic interface structures and corresponding electronic properties, which can hardly be obtained by available experimental techniques. For simplicity, we chose to use CH3NH3PbI3 as the model system and constructed heterojunctions made of the CH3NH3PbI3 (001) surface on which crystalline CdSe films in the (001) direction with Cd or Se termination are adsorbed. This is reasonable because in experiments it is extremely difficult to determine the crystal planes of CdSe QDs and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at the contact place, while both CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbCl3 have a similar atomic structure and their (001) surface is most stable. We have systematically studied four types of interfaces, including the organic CH3NH3 plane of CH3NH3PbI3 in contact with the Se plane of CdSe, CH3NH3 in contact with the Cd plane, PbI2 with the Se plane, and PbI2 with the Cd plane. Various adsorption configurations have been considered, and the optimized ground-state structures with the lowest total energy are shown in Fig. 3a–d, respectively. It is obvious that structural change occurred around the contact region of the interface. Especially, for interfaces of the organic CH3NH3 plane in contact with the Se/Cd plane of CdSe, we see most structural relaxation in CdSe but little change within the organic CH3NH3 plane. The binding distances for the two interfaces were calculated to be around 2.5 Å and 2.1 Å, respectively. The difference between the two mainly comes from the comparatively preferable interaction of organic CH3NH3 elements with metal Cd atoms (Fig. 3b) rather than Se atoms (Fig. 3a). For interfaces of the PbI2 plane in contact with CdSe (whether Se or Cd plane), it is found that severe structural change happens at both perovskite and CdSe sides. Strikingly, we found that for both interfaces, one layer of PbI2 is protruded out of the surface that interacts strongly with Se (Fig. 3c) or Cd (Fig. 3d). This leads to a much shorter binding distance of 1.4 Å and 2.0 Å for the two interfaces, respectively. These calculated results are in accordance with the obtained TEM/HRTEM observations.

Atomic color codes are: H (white), C (green), N (blue), Se (orange), Cd (wheat), I (sienna), and Pb (grey). Insets show the local structure with binding distance indicated. Charge density redistribution around the contact region is also shown (isovalue = 0.01 e Å−3). Blue color denotes charge accumulation and red color represents charge depletion. (b–d) Interfaces of CH3NH3 in contact with the Cd plane, PbI2 with the Se plane, and PbI2 with the Cd plane, respectively. 
To investigate the structural stability, we calculated the binding energy of the four ground-state interface systems. Here, binding energy Eb per area is defined as, Eb = [E(CdSe) + E(CH3NH3PbI3) − E(CH3NH3PbI3/CdSe)]/S, in which E(CdSe), E(CH3NH3PbI3) and E(CH3NH3PbI3/CdSe) are the total energies of the CdSe film, the CH3NH3PbI3 surface and the combined systems, respectively. S is the surface area of the supercell. The calculated Eb equals to 0.80, 0.99, 23.4 and 27.3 meV Å−2 for the interfaces of CH3NH3 in contact with the Se plane, CH3NH3 with Cd, PbI2 with Se, and PbI2 with Cd, respectively. Clearly, the binding energies of the first two interfaces are quite small (<1 meV Å−2), indicating a quite weak interaction between organic CH3NH3 and CdSe. In contrast, binding energies of the last two interfaces are over 20 times larger than those of the first two cases (>20 meV Å−2), suggesting that there exists strong interaction between CH3NH3PbI3 and CdSe when the PbI2 plane contacts the CdSe (no matter Cd or Se). It should also be noted that the calculated binding energies are comparably larger than the previously reported values of PbS quantum dots adsorbed on CH3NH3PbI3 (∼12 meV Å−2),29 suggesting the favorable formation of CdSe films on the perovskite. To visualize the charge transfer between CH3NH3PbI3 and CdSe, we plotted the charge density redistribution isosurfaces in the insets of Fig. 3a–d. It is clearly seen that charge redistribution mainly happens around the contact region. Interestingly, significant charge redistribution occurs in the interfaces when the PbI2 plane contacts the CdSe (Fig. 3c and d), and very little can be found in the interfaces of CH3NH3 in contact with CdSe (Fig. 3a and b). This is in accordance with their binding distances and energies. By using the Bader charge analysis method,30 we found that for interfaces of CH3NH3 in contact with CdSe, there is little charge transfer. However, for the interface of PbI2 in contact with the Cd (Se) plane, around 0.0015 e Å−2 (0.0044 e Å−2) of electrons are transferred from CdSe to CH3NH3PbI3, thus leaving perovskite n-type doped. Importantly, a charge transfer associated electrostatic potential drop or increase within the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/CdSe interface will lead to an in-built electric field, which may greatly facilitate the separation of electron and hole pairs, beneficial for solar cells.31
To further explore the electronic structures, density of states (DOS) and partial DOS (PDOS) for the four interfaces were calculated and compared. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, there is significant overlap of DOS contributed by CH3NH3PbI3 and CdSe for all interfaces. However, by plotting out the PDOS around the contact region, it is found that they hybridize differently in fashion of both atomic orbital composition and magnitude. In particular, for the interface of CH3NH3 in contact with Se, we found that near Fermi level DOS are mainly contributed by p orbitals of Se with little contribution from CH3NH3 (Fig. 4a), indicating little orbital hybridization. Similarly, for the interface of CH3NH3 in contact with Cd, s and d orbitals of Cd contribute to the most part with little contribution from CH3NH3 (Fig. 4b). In contrast, for the interface of PbI2 in contact with Se, there is strong orbital hybridization between p orbitals of Pb/I and Se, for which both contribute to significantly the total DOS near Fermi level (Fig. 4c). Strong orbital hybridization also exists at the interface of PbI2 in contact with Cd, for which we found strong overlap between s and d orbitals of Cd with p orbitals of Pd and I (Fig. 4d). These analyses are qualitatively in agreement with the binding energies and charge redistribution. Thus, the different binding features and electronic properties of the four interfaces originate from their very different orbital hybridization in the contact region, and the strong orbital hybridization within the inorganic-terminated perovskite surface and CdSe results in high-quality films with enhanced stability.

Experimentally, we constructed an architecture of the solar cell device and studied the operating performance of the device by using the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL. As shown in Fig. 5a, the architecture is fabricated by coating a PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of around 46 nm on a pre-prepared ITO substrate. A uniform CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer with a thickness of 263 nm was then deposited on top of a PEDOT:PSS layer through a solvent-engineering method. After that, CdSe/PCBM as the ETL with a thickness of 47 nm was deposited on the top via orthogonal solvent processing, and then 0.6 mg mL−1 Rhodamine 101 solution in isopropanol was spin-coated. Finally, 1 nm-thick LiF and 100 nm-thick Ag electrodes were thermally evaporated. A typical cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated solar cell is given in Fig. 5b, which clearly shows the high-quality layered structure. We considered pure PCBM and three different mass ratios (1%, 5%, and 10%) of the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL to explore the concentration effect on photovoltaic performance.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5c and the photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells are summarized in Table 1, where current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are listed and compared. Remarkably, we found that the solar cell with the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL generally exhibits better performance compared to that with pure PCBM, and at about 5% mass ratio, it exhibits an optimal Jsc of 20.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V, and an FF of 73.16% with a high PCE of 13.7%. We also performed measurements on a batch of 30 solar cell devices, with key photovoltaic parameters and their histograms shown in Table S1 and Fig. S5,† respectively. The averaged Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE were found to be 18.7 mA cm−2, 0.92 V, 69.7% and 12.0%, respectively, suggesting the general high-performance characteristics. Series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were also measured (Table S2†), which can be achieved by varying the ratio of CdSe QDs in the CdSe/PCBM composite. Compared to the solar cell device using pure PCBM as the ETL, a much lower Rs was obtained for the device using the CdSe/PCBM composite with a 5% ratio of CdSe, suggesting that doping of CdSe greatly facilitates charge transport. On the other hand, Rsh has relatively little change with CdSe ratio, suggesting that the open-circuit voltage was rarely affected. Thus, the improved current density and fill factor is closely related to the series resistance and shunt resistance that can be efficiently tuned by CdSe doping. The physical origination can be traced back to the fact that CdSe/PCBM greatly improves the quality of the perovskite film (with a small RMS roughness of ∼6.0 nm) and decreases the surface traps, together with the charge transfer induced in-built electric field that tends to reduce the combination of electron and hole pairs and increase the solar cell efficiency. We also measured the performance of the solar cell using pure CdSe QDs as the ETL (Table S3†), which shows significantly smaller photovoltaic parameters, indicating poor performance of the device. This is understandable because pure CdSe QDs spin-coated on the perovskite layer usually have very poor film quality, i.e., the CdSe QD film contains plenty of defects such as voids and pinholes, which severely limits the charge transport and affects the performance of the solar cells.32

To examine the exciton separation efficiency, we measured the PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film on the ITO substrate. As shown in Fig. 5d, for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with pure PCBM, a strong PL emission was observed at around 770 nm. When CdSe/PCBM composites were spin-coated, however, significant reduction of emission can be clearly observed, indicating the efficient extraction of electrons/holes by CdSe/PCBM composites. We also studied the PL lifetime of the synthesized structures. As PL decays show a nonlinear feature, PL lifetime τ can be calculated by using a biexponential fitting model.33 The average lifetime τavg was calculated via τavg = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi, where Ai are the amplitude of the component decay time τi. As shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† for pure CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films, the average PL lifetime was calculated to be 30.4 ns. PL lifetime was significantly reduced to 27.4 ns (14.0 ns) when PCBM (CdSe/PCBM composite) was coated. Shorter PL lifetime ensures the efficient carrier extraction from CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films, leading to the improved operating performance of the solar cells.
Finally, we investigated the device stability of the fabricated solar cells, which was done by keeping the cells without encapsulation under humid ambient air (humidity > 95%) at room temperature. We found that solar cells with CdSe/PCBM as the ETL exhibit a relatively higher stability. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, Jsc and PCE of the solar cell with CdSe/PCBM decayed much more slowly than those with pure PCBM, suggesting the improved device stability. This results from the enhanced structural stability together with the hydrophobic nature of the CdSe/PCBM composite. To further show the hydrophobicity, we performed measurement of water contact angle on the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film with pure PCBM and the CdSe/PCBM composite. As shown in Table 2, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film shows a much smaller contact angle than the film deposited with pure PCBM and CdSe/PCBM. Interestingly, the measured water contact angle of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with CdSe/PCBM (93.82°) is relatively higher than that with pure PCBM (89.62°). This confirms the superiority of hydrophobicity in CdSe, which inhibits water penetration into the perovskite layer and improves the stability of solar cells. Therefore, utilization of the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL provides a promising approach to improve the durability of perovskite solar cells.

Experimental
Materials and preparation
CdSe QDs were obtained from Mesolight Inc. CH3NH3I and PCBM were received from 1-Material. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) aqueous solution was purchased from Heraeus. PbI2, PbCl2, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further processing. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was dissolved in a cosolvent of DMSO and GBL (vol. ratio = 3:7) with Pb2+ and CH3NH3I (molar ratio = 1.4 M:1.3 M). The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight in a glovebox. To synthesize the CdSe/PCBM composite, three different mass ratios (1%, 5%, and 10%) of CdSe and PCBM powder were dispersed in chlorobenzene.
Solar cell fabrication
ITO was cleaned by sonication using detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, ultraviolet and ozone (UV-Ozone) treatment for 15 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was coated on a prepared ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 1 min by spin coating. The substrate was then heated on a hot plate at 120 °C for 20 min in air. We preheated the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx mixed solution at 70 °C. Then the perovskite layer was deposited onto ITO/PEDOT:PSS by spin-coating a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx mixed solution at 1000 rpm for 20 s. After that, the obtained layer was spin-coated at 5500 rpm for 60 s. Soon afterwards, it was quenched by dropping 1000 μL of anhydrous toluene at 45 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, a layer of CdSe/PCBM was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 2500 rpm for 40 s. 0.6 mg mL−1 Rhodamine 101 solution in isopropanol was deposited by spin coating at 1500 rpm for 40 s onto the PCBM layer. Finally, 1 nm-thick LiF and 100 nm Ag electrodes were thermally evaporated onto the rhodamine layer under a high vacuum of 7.5 × 10−4 Pa.
Characterization of materials
The surface morphology and roughness were evaluated by SEM and AFM. The crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite was characterized by using XRD. UV-vis and PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films with PCBM and CdSe/PCBM on ITO were measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and a PL spectrophotometer. Current–voltage characteristics of solar cells were tested by using a Keithley model 2400 source/meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., OH) under the simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Each solar cell device has an area of 0.11 cm2 and was measured in air.
First-principles calculations
Electronic structure calculations were performed by using the projector augmented wave formalism of DFT34,35 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.36 The energy cutoff was set to 480 eV. For the exchange and correlation functional, we used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) format.37 We note that the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)38 and inclusive of the spin–orbit coupling effect, and/or quasiparticle self-consistent GW methods39,40 were discussed before.41,42 However, by considering the large systems of our models and comparing the results of different functionals, we chose to use the GGA-PBE format. The CH3NH3PbI3 surface was considered with a thickness of 8 atomic layers and the CdSe film with 15 layers, and a vacuum thickness of 15 Å was added. During structural optimization, all the atoms and the lattice constant were fully relaxed until the atomic forces are smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1. A 6 × 6 × 1 grid for Monkhorst–Pack43k-point mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone. It should be noted that CH3NH3PbI3 has a tetragonal crystal structure with a lattice parameter of a = b = 8.86 Å and c = 12.66 Å at room temperature, and CdSe has a cubic phase of the sphalerite structure with a = b = c = 6.05 Å, suggesting a very small lattice mismatch in the (001) direction (∼3.4%).
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the possibility of employing a CdSe/PCBM composite as a promising ETL to improve the structural stability and operating performance of perovskite solar cells. We show that CdSe/PCBM reduces the roughness of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, which leads to a high-quality film with a compact morphology. First-principles calculations show that the chemical stability of the perovskite can be enhanced with the adsorption of CdSe involving strong orbital hybridization, and an inorganic-terminated perovskite surface has much stronger interaction with CdSe. Experiments on solar cells using the CdSe/PCBM composite as the ETL exhibit enhanced photocurrent and fill factor due to the improved film quality with decreased surface traps and the associated electronic properties. We show an optimal PCE of 13.7% at a 5% mass ratio of CdSe/PCBM with enhanced device stability under ambient conditions. We expect the present theoretical-experimental joint research approach to provide a new avenue for future design and exploration of novel, stable and efficient optoelectronic devices.
