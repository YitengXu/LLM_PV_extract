    , Accepted 22nd December 2021First published on 23rd December 2021AbstractDeveloping high-performance dopant-free hole transport materials (DF-HTMs) is critical to realizing stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a class of siloxane-terminated polymers (PBZ-Si) with low surface energy were studied as DF-HTMs in PSCs. These polymers have good film-forming properties with unique face-on orientation and suitable valence bands. More importantly, the siloxane-terminated side-chains exhibited fantastic multifunctionality, providing the polymer with sufficient solubility, increased hole mobility, passivation capability, and hydrophobicity. Furthermore, for the first time, we observed directly the preferential face-on molecular orientation of polymeric HTMs on perovskite films by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. Finally, planar n–i–p PSCs employing PBZ-3Si with complete siloxane-terminated side chains as the DF-HTM displayed a high efficiency of 20.18%, with an unprecedented fill factor up to 85%, a record fill factor value in all n–i–p PSCs with dopant-free HTMs. Moreover, the device with PBZ-3Si showed excellent thermal and moisture stability. The devices without encapsulation retained 76% of the initial efficiency after 333 h under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% relative humidity conditions. This work proves that siloxane-terminated side-chains are essential for the rational design of polymeric DF-HTMs toward efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Upon retrospection of the development and blossoming of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), it is evident that hole transport materials (HTM) have played an essential role in extracting holes from the perovskite active layer and suppressing charge recombination at the anode.1–9 Molecular 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) catalyzed the initial dramatic development of PSCs in 2012,2 and nearly surpassed all the newly developed HTMs in realizing all the record efficiencies marked on the NREL chart.10,11 The recently certified efficiency of 25.2% was also from a device with the n–i–p configuration that employed spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM.8,9 However, the good performance of spiro-OMeTAD heavily depends on the addition of additives like lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) to overcome the intrinsic low hole mobility and conductivity due to the symmetric globular structure and the resultant weak π–π interactions.12–15 These incorporated additives are detrimental to the stability of the devices as they increase the hydrophilic nature of spiro-OMeTAD and hence accelerate the degradation of the perovskite.16 Besides, the volatile and corrosive nature of tBP and the migration of Li+ across the device can degrade the efficiency during cell operation.17–19 To mitigate the ‘Achilles' heel’ of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to developing dopant-free HTMs (DF-HTMs).6,16,20–27
Compared with inorganic HTMs28–40 and organic molecular HTMs,25,41–43 HTMs based on conjugated polymers possess high solution operability due to the inherent high carrier mobility, excellent film-forming properties, and sufficient hydrophobicity.44–47 Currently, several dopant-free polymer HTMs have been employed in PSCs to realize high PCEs and excellent device stability, such as pBBTa-BDT2,48 RCP,23 asy-PBTBDT,49 PCDTBT1,50 (alkoxy-)PTEG,51,52 PC3,45 P3HT53,54 and many others.15,20,55–58 Donor (D)–acceptor (A) type conjugated polymers20,23,48–52,56–59 are important candidates owing to their tunable energy levels, optical bandgaps, and high hole mobilities.25,45 To ensure good solubility of the polymers, branched alkyl side chains are indispensable parts of the polymer structure. However, apolar hydrocarbon alkyl chains affect the intermolecular π–π interactions and limit the charge transfer between the polymer chains.60 As an alternative, tetraethylene glycol (TEG) groups49,51,52 are introduced to prevent the twisting of backbones and improve the solubility via the dipole–dipole interactions between polymer chains and solvent molecules. Nevertheless, the hydrophilic TEG groups can increase the surface energy of the corresponding polymers, which is unfavorable for the device stability.51,52
Siloxane-terminated side chains with unique distal branching points can provide the polymer with enough solubility and intimate conjugated backbone stacking.44 Moreover, the terminal siloxane groups can dramatically decrease surface tension, as in the case of polyorganosiloxane, and have been realized to reduce the surface energy of conjugated polymers.61–63 However, so far, there has been no report about the effect of siloxane-terminated side chains on polymer HTMs applied in PSCs. Herein, a series of hydrophobic siloxane-terminated conjugated polymers are investigated for the first time as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. To maintain the advantage of D–A-type conjugated polymers as HTMs, we employed dithienylbenzodithiophene (BDTT) as the D unit and difluorobenzotriazole (FTAZ) as the A unit, linked through the π-bridge of thiophene, forming the backbone of polymers. Further, engineering of the number of siloxane-terminated side chains tunes the properties of polymers systematically. The chemical structures of three polymers, PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, PBZ-3Si, are shown in Fig. 1a. The hole mobilities of the polymers were promoted gradually with the increase of the siloxane-terminated side-chain contents in the repeating unit due to the reduced π–π packing distance, as evidenced by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Moreover, we found that the siloxane-terminated side chains can passivate the defects on the surface of the perovskite via the Pb–O interaction and enhance the hydrophobicity of polymers due to the reduced surface energy. Finally, n–i–p PSCs containing PBZ-3Si as the DF-HTM achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.18% with a very high fill factor (FF) of 84.93%, which is the record value among those reported for all dopant-free HTM-based n–i–p PSCs. In addition, the PBZ-3Si-based devices displayed excellent thermal and moisture stability, retaining 76% of the initial efficiency after 333 h under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% relative humidity conditions without encapsulation, while the devices based on the doped spiro-OMeTAD retained only 30% of the initial efficiency. This work offers a fundamental strategy to develop dopant-free polymeric HTMs toward efficient and stable PSCs.

Results and discussion
The polymers PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, PBZ-3Si featuring siloxane-terminated side chains showed good solubility in common solvents, including chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene.64 The three polymers also showed excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td) over 420 °C for 5% weight loss and no apparent phase transition up to 300 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), which are favorable for their application in PSCs.64,65 The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was conducted to understand the electronic structure of these conjugated polymers. Fig. 1b shows the dihedral angles between repeating units of each polymer, which can quantitatively reflect the steric hindrance of side chains and, eventually, the co-planarity of these conjugated polymers. For example, PBZ-1Si displays a dihedral angle of 9° between BDTT and FTAZ units. With the gradual replacement of alkyl chains by the siloxane-terminated chains, backbones of PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si became more and more planar, with PBZ-3Si showing the lowest dihedral angle of 3.5°. Fig. S2† displays the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of the three polymers and most of the negative charges are located on the conjugated main chains and O atoms of siloxane, which may be anticipated to interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. Additionally, DFT calculations show that both HOMO and LUMO orbitals delocalized over the conjugated chains of the three polymers (Fig. S3†), indicating good co-planarity of the three polymers. The calculated energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs (Table S1, ESI†) showed no noticeable change after introducing different numbers of siloxane-terminated side chains.
It has been well demonstrated that the molecular arrangement of the DF-HTM is very crucial to the photovoltaic performance of the devices,66 and an ordered face-on stacking favors vertical charge carrier transport to boost the device performance.67 We have shown by GIWAXS measurement that all these polymer films showed face-on orientations on Si substrates.64 Moreover, the π–π stacking distance decreased from 3.7 Å to 3.61 Å with increased content of the siloxane-terminated side chain in the PBZ polymers, indicating reinforced π–π interactions.64,65 (Fig. S4†) After the deposition of PBZ-Si polymers on perovskite films, their characteristic face-on packing orientations remained, as shown in Fig. 1d and S6.† The prominent diffraction spot at qz ∼1.75 Å−1, assigned to the π–π stacking of PBZ-3Si, coincides with that observed on the Si substrates (Fig. 1c), evidencing the same preferred face-on orientation along the out-of-plane direction. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time that the preferential face-on orientation stacking of polymeric HTMs on perovskite films through GIWAXS measurement is directly disclosed. In contrast, no preferred orientation could be found in the GIWAXS patterns of spiro-OMeTAD on either Si or perovskite substrates, as depicted in Fig. S5a and b.†
To obtain a more in-depth insight into the molecular stacking of PBZ-Si polymers, the angular dependence of the diffraction peak at qz ∼1.75 Å−1 was examined.68 The intensity of the peak became significantly higher at ∼80° for the sample of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PBZ-3Si (Fig. S7b†), indicating a similarly well-aligned PBZ-3Si polymer to the sample of Si/PBZ-3Si (Fig. S7a†). These results confirmed that the π–π stack of the PBZ-3Si polymer exhibits a face-on structure on the perovskite layer as well as on the Si substrate. Nevertheless, spiro-OMeTAD films showed nearly homogeneous intensity between 35 and 80° in both samples, further confirming the absence of preferred orientations for spiro-OMeTAD compared to the PBZ-3Si polymer (Fig. S7c and d†). These face-to-face packed HTM molecules on the perovskite surface will facilitate vertical hole transportation from the perovskite to the HTM layer.
Besides, suitable energy alignment at the perovskite/HTM interface is vital for PSCs. As shown in Fig. 2a, the HOMO and LUMO levels (estimated from cyclic voltammetry) of the polymers gradually increase simultaneously with the increase of the siloxane-terminated side chains from PBZ-1Si to PBZ-3Si. However, the deeper HOMO levels of all polymers (−5.29–−5.21 eV) than spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV)69–71 could provide better energy alignment with the adjacent perovskite layer. Therefore, this might engender lower energy loss and higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the corresponding PSCs, while the up-shifted LUMO levels are beneficial to the electron blocking, resulting in suppressed non-radiative recombination loss.

Since high intrinsic hole mobility is a critical factor in ensuring dopant-free HTMs, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole mobilities of the polymers. The hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/polymers/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 2b, the hole mobility of PBZ-1Si films was measured to be 7.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. As the number of siloxane-terminated side chains in the repeat unit increases, the hole mobilities of PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si films are enhanced to 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are on par with that of doped spiro-OMeTAD, ensuring their potential as dopant-free HTMs.16 This could be linked to the gradual planarization of the backbones as shown by the DFT calculation and the enhanced π–π packing in the solid-state indicated by GIWAXS measurements.44
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted to investigate charge injection and recombination dynamics between the HTM and perovskite. The PL of the neat perovskite is significantly quenched after covering by HTMs (perovskite/HTMs), as shown in Fig. 2c. The relatively stronger emission from perovskite/PBZ-2Si and perovskite/PBZ-3Si than perovskite/PBZ-1Si suggests reduced interfacial non-radiative recombination.72–76 The TRPL decay curves were fitted using a two-component exponential decay model (Fig. 2d and Table S2†). Here, for the perovskite/HTM bilayer samples, the fast decay (τ1) can be assigned to the charge extraction to the HTMs and/or partly to the interface recombination, while the slow decay (τ2) is mainly assigned to the interface recombination losses.59,77,78 All perovskite/HTM samples show shorter τ1 lifetimes along with the much increased relative amplitude of the fast component (A1) than the neat perovskite film, indicating efficient hole extraction by the HTMs.79 Among them, perovskite/PBZ-3Si displayed the shortest τ1 with a large A1 of 0.58, associated with the highest driving force for the hole injection process resulting from the high mobility and HOMO level. The even higher A1 of 0.64 for perovskite/PBZ-1Si might be due to the synergic effect of interface recombination and charge extraction.76 Additionally, the gradual increase of decay time τ2 from PBZ-1Si to PBZ-3Si is possibly caused by the reduced interface recombination and efficient passivation of traps by siloxane groups, as evidenced by the results of XPS measurements.80
To investigate the interaction between the HTM and the perovskite film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted. PBZ-3Si with complete siloxane-terminated side chains in the repeat units was selected as the typical example. XPS spectra of Pb 4f in Fig. 3a show distinct doublets at 138.4 and 143.3 eV for the neat perovskite, which are assigned to the binding energies of the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively.81 For the perovskite film coated with PBZ-3Si, the corresponding Pb 4f peaks show an ∼0.5 eV shift toward lower binding energy to 137.9 and 142.8 eV, respectively. The same trend is observed in I 3d XPS peaks of the neat perovskite, which also shifted toward lower binding energy after being coated with PBZ-3Si (Fig. 3b). The I 3d spectra exhibit two contributions, I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, located at 619.2 eV and 630.7 for the bare perovskite film. For the perovskite/PBZ-3Si, I 3d signals also shifted around 0.5 eV toward lower binding energy to 618.7 and 630.2 eV, respectively.82 This phenomenon suggests that the interaction between PBZ-3Si and the perovskite film decreased the valence electrons involved in bonds.81,83 It is likely that the coordination of Pb dangling bonds with electron donation groups in PBZ-3Si released the Pb–I bonding under the surface.82 This could be corroborated by the noticeable shift (∼0.6 eV) of O 1s peaks of PBZ-3Si from 531.7 eV to 532.3 eV after coating on the perovskite film, which supports the direct interaction between siloxane groups (Si–O–Si) and undercoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite surface80,84 (Fig. 3c). Note that the broad peak at 532.9 eV in PBZ-3Si is assigned to molecularly adsorbed water.85,86 The almost unchanged S 2p peaks of the PBZ-3Si film before (163.9 eV for S 2p3/2 and 164.9 eV for S 2p1/2) and after (163.9 eV (S 2p3/2) and 165.0 eV (S 2p1/2)) coating on the perovskite suggest a weak Pb–S interaction between the thiophene units in the PBZ-3Si and perovskite surface (Fig. 3d). The peak at 165.35 eV is due to the S(2p3/2) shake-up.87 These results revealed the ubiquitous binding effect of oxygen in siloxane groups (Si–O–Si) with exposed and undercoordinated Pb2+ defects on the perovskite surface.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to investigate the film morphology of the polymers coated atop the perovskite films. As illustrated in Fig. S8,† the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 10.0 nm, 7.13 nm, and 7.94 nm for PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, and PBZ-3Si films, respectively. The lower surface roughness PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si films signify a better coverage of the perovskite films and can finally reduce undesired shunt losses in devices. Additionally, the contact angle (CA) measurements (Fig. S9†) show that the surface hydrophobicity increased from PBZ-1Si to PBZ-3Si, with PBZ-3Si showing a CA up to 108.38°. The surface tensions (γ) of PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, and PBZ-3Si were estimated according to the Owens equation88 to be 32.96 mJ m−2, 31.5 mJ m−2, and 30.72 mJ m−2, respectively, and were much lower than that of PTEG (43.03 mJ m−2).51 Furthermore, there is a descending trend in surface energy as the content of the siloxane-terminated side chain increases, indicating the positive role of the siloxane groups in decreasing the surface energy of polymers. The much higher water CAs of all polymers (over 103°) than doped spiro-OMeTAD (CA = 60.5°)59 prove higher hydrophobicity of the polymers, which will benefit the stability of PSC devices by more efficient prevention of water penetration.15,45
To demonstrate the potential of the polymers as HTMs in PSCs, we fabricated solar cells based on a triple-cation perovskite absorber. Fig. S10† shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a typical n–i–p device consisting of ITO/SnO2/perovskite absorber/polymer/Au. All polymers were employed without any additives and dopants. The thickness of HTM films was first optimized by adjusting the concentration of HTM solutions from 4 to 8 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The corresponding photovoltaic data are collected in Table S3–S5,† respectively. The optimal concentrations were around 4 mg mL−1 for PBZ-1Si, and 6 mg mL−1 for PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si, far below the high concentration of 72.3 mg mL−1 for spiro-OMeTAD. The details of the device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† The thicknesses of the polymers were estimated to be 35 nm–40 nm by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S10†). Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves collected from the champion devices based on different polymers as HTMs. The corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. The devices based on PBZ-1Si displayed a decent PCE of 17.24% in the forward scan, coupled with a VOC of 1.03 V, a JSC of 21.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.32%. (Hysteresis index (HI) = 0.06)

In comparison, PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si exhibited better performance showing champion PCEs of 19.15% (forward scan) for PBZ-2Si (VOC of 1.06 V, a JSC of 22.22 mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.31%), and 20.18% (forward scan) for PBZ-3Si (VOC of 1.09 V). Besides the remarkable PCE of PBZ-3Si, the devices also showed the smallest hysteresis index (0.034) and a super FF of 84.93%, representing the record value among all n–i–p PSCs employing dopant-free HTMs and approaching the FF SQ limit.89Fig. 4d and Table S6† summarize the reported high FFs and their corresponding efficiencies obtained from devices with various dopant-free HTMs in recent years and from this work. The superior photovoltaic performance of PBZ-3Si with high VOC and FF could be attributed to its better carrier transport properties and more efficient passivation of perovskite surface defects by the abundant siloxane groups.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra with different HTMs are shown in Fig. S11.† The integrated current densities are 20.62 mA cm−2, 21.28 mA cm−2, and 21.20 mA cm−2 for PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, and PBZ-3Si, respectively, in good agreement with the experimental J–V measurement. The steady-state PCE at the maximum power point (MPP) was measured to confirm the efficiencies obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. 4b). The PBZ-1Si-, PBZ-2Si-, and PBZ-3Si-based devices showed stabilized PCEs of 16.65%, 18.54%, and 19.67% for 600 s, respectively. All devices exhibited highly stable steady-state photovoltaic performances proving the reliability of the device performances. The statistical box charts of the photovoltaic parameters of more than 15 devices for each polymer are given in Fig. S12.† The average PCEs of PBZ-1Si-, PBZ-2Si-, and PBZ-3Si-based devices are 16.04%, 18.58, and 19.15%, respectively (Table S7†). The performances based on PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si showed narrower distribution than those of PBZ-1Si (Fig. 4c), indicating good reproducibility for PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si.
To analyze the interfacial charge dynamics and recombination behavior in the complete devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted. The Nyquist plots of the devices with different HTMs at −0.85 V bias under 10 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. S13a.† The equivalent fitting circuit and related data are provided in Fig. S14 and Table S8.† The high-frequency semicircle and low-frequency semicircle correspond to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively.90–92 Obviously, Rct followed the trend of PBZ-1Si > PBZ-2Si > PBZ-3Si with the values 65.16 Ω cm2, 31.37 Ω cm2 and 25.18 Ω cm2 respectively, indicating more efficient charge transfer for PBZ-3Si. Meanwhile, PBZ-3Si displayed the largest Rrec value, while PBZ-1Si showed the smallest one. This suggests that the recombination losses in the PBZ-3Si-based device were much reduced compared to that in the PBZ-1Si-based device. As shown in Fig. S13b,† the dark current leakages of the PBZ-2Si- and PBZ-3Si-based devices are lower than that of PBZ-1Si, indicating the relatively smaller shunt resistance and inferior interface contact in PBZ-1Si-based devices. Meanwhile, the fast JSC decays and prolonged VOC decays in PBZ-2Si- and PBZ-3Si-based devices perfectly matched the EIS results (Fig. S13c and d†). Concisely, the PBZ-3Si-based devices exhibited the most efficient charge transfer and suppressed interface recombination due to their high hole mobility and efficient passivation of surface defects, eventually contributing to a high efficiency of over 20% with an ultrahigh FF of 85%.
Moreover, to understand and quantify the main loss factors affecting the efficiencies of PBZ-Si-based devices, the equivalent circuit model proposed by Sha et al.93 was applied to describe the J–V characteristics of the devices. This model could identify the dominant efficiency loss mechanism, including non-radiative recombination losses (bulk and surface recombination) and resistance losses (series and shunt). The theoretically fitted J–V curves according to the modified detailed balance model compared with the J–V curves of experimental measurements are shown in Fig. S15.† The relative fitting errors between the experimental measurement curves and the fitted curves are all within 2%. The extracted characteristic parameters from the equivalent circuit model are shown in Table S9.†
Furthermore, we draw the ideal current–density curves and the curves dominated by only bulk recombination, surface recombination, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices based on the three polymeric HTMs, respectively, during the voltage scanning process (Fig. 5a). And then, the proportions of different efficiency losses resulting in the total loss during the voltage scanning process can be visualized in Fig. 5b. Note that the perovskite was kept the same in the studied dopant-free n–i–p structured devices, and only different HTMs on the perovskite were employed. Hence, it is hard to distinguish between bulk recombination and surface recombination. In this case, we took the sum of bulk and surface recombination losses as the total non-radiative recombination (Rec.) loss in the final analysis of the efficiency loss mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 5b, Rec. loss is the primary loss mechanism in all three HTMs. The efficiency losses caused by series resistance in all three devices are close to 0%.
 Fig. 5  Efficiency loss mechanisms: (a) the ideal current–density curves and curves dominated by only bulk recombination, surface recombination, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh) during the voltage scanning process, respectively. (b) The proportion of different efficiency loss of PBZ-Si-based devices including Rec. (non-radiative recombination), Rs, Rsh. 
Nevertheless, the ratio of Rsh loss of up to 7.55% for PBZ-1Si-based devices is much higher than those of the others, indicating that the Rsh loss mechanism, to a certain extent, determined the inferior efficiency of PBZ-1Si-based devices. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the Rsh loss represents leakage current loss in the circuit, it is suggested that there are more traps and pinholes in the PBZ-1Si-based devices. This is consistent with the experimental results as shown in AFM and dark current measurements, which showed that PBZ-2Si and PBZ-3Si have better interface contact with the perovskite and lower dark current leakages in the devices.
Though the PCE of over 20% was realized, keep in mind that one of the primary purposes of developing DF-HTM is to improve the stability of PSCs. The aging tests of unencapsulated devices using different polymers were performed in an ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C, RH = 20 ± 5%) (Fig. 6a). The devices based on PBZ-1Si, PBZ-2Si, and PBZ-3Si retained, respectively, 96%, 98%, and 98% of their initial efficiency after 1200 h. All the devices showed excellent stability, which is ascribed to the high hydrophobicity of the HTM layer.

(b) Stability test results of an unencapsulated device under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% RH conditions. (c) and (d) Optical image of the unencapsulated devices after 333 h under the 85 °C and 70 ± 10% RH conditions. (e) The cross-sectional SEM image (left) of the unencapsulated devices after 333 h under the 85 °C and 70 ± 10% RH conditions, and the schematic diagram (right) of the effect of moisture and thermal stress on the HTMs and perovskite layer (the white circles in the doped spiro-OMeTAD layer indicate the pinholes due to the volatilization of tBP under high thermal stress). 
Furthermore, the long-term stability test for the PBZ-3Si-applied devices (doped spiro-OMeTAD as a comparison) at the temperature of 85 °C was carried out without encapsulation on a hot plate under a 70 ± 10% RH ambient atmosphere (Fig. 6b). After aging for 333 h, the PCE of the PBZ-3Si-based device decreased to 76% of the initial efficiency under such high temperature and humidity conditions. By contrast, the doped spiro-OMeTAD-based device exhibited a dramatic decrease of PCE, retaining only 30% of the initial efficiency. The optical images of the unencapsulated devices (from the glass side) after 333 h under the 85 °C and 70 ± 10% RH conditions are shown in Fig. 6c. The active-area of the perovskite layer (the intersection of top Au and bottom ITO) in the doped spiro-OMeTAD-based device showed a faded color and rough morphology with pinholes15,94 after 333 h, which could be ascribed to the accelerated decomposition processes by the hygroscopic and volatile dopants under moisture and thermal stress. Meanwhile, the PBZ-3Si-based devices retained a shiny appearance with a dark and uniform color. Note that the perovskite beyond the active area in PBZ-3Si-based devices turned to the color of yellow PbI2 due to the much thinner film of PBZ-3Si (∼40 nm) compared to the 175 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD. The thicker HTM film is beneficial to protect the perovskite from external attacks of moisture and heating, which could also be surmounted by encapsulation.82
Encouraged by the higher performance retention by the PBZ-3Si-based device (despite the apparently faded perovskite beyond the active area), the active area of the aged devices was further studied. The optical images of the unencapsulated (PBZ-3Si-based) devices (from the Au side) aged for 333 h under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% RH conditions are shown in Fig. 6d. The surface of the perovskite layer in the active area exhibited a uniform and shiny dark color along with some Au and PBZ-3Si exfoliation, which is quite contrary to the non-active area. Thus, the Au electrode also protected the perovskite from moisture invasion before the hydrophobic polymer HTM.
Additionally, cross-sectional SEM measurements were performed to scrutinize the interior of active layers in the devices after aging for 333 h. As shown in Fig. 6e, the doped spiro-OMeTAD film showed voids and pinholes due to the volatilization of tBP under high thermal stress. These pinholes will provide additional paths for the migration of Li+ (including the ion migration of perovskites, such as MA+ and I−) and moisture and then accelerate the degradation of the perovskite. Thus, there are large amounts of PbI2 chunks (bright white regions95) in the perovskite layer, some of which even break through the perovskite layer. There also exists a fuzzy perovskite domain close to the middle of the image (arrow indication) after the perovskite degradation. In sharp contrast, little PbI2 and degraded perovskite were found in the PBZ-3Si-based devices due to the hydrophobic and thermally stable HTM layer and the absence of hydrophilic, volatile, and corrosive additives. These results are in agreement with the observation from the glass side.
Conclusions
In summary, this study examined siloxane-terminated side chain-based polymers, namely PBZ-Si, as dopant-free HTMs to obtain highly efficient and stable n–i–p type PSCs for the first time. Furthermore, as solubilizing side chains, siloxane groups in the polymers could play multiple roles. First, they could improve hole mobility by tuning the molecular packing, as demonstrated by the DFT calculation, GIWAXS, and SCLC measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct observation of the face-on stacking of polymeric HTMs on perovskite films. Second, the siloxane-terminal groups on the side chains can reduce the recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface by passivating the defects on the perovskite surface via the Pb–O interaction. Third, the siloxane-terminated side chains can enhance the hydrophobicity of the polymers due to the reduced surface energy. As a result, PBZ-3Si with complete siloxane-termination as the DF-HTM resulted in a high efficiency of 20.18%, with a record FF up to 85%. Moreover, the PBZ-3Si-based devices without encapsulation showed excellent thermal and moisture stability by retaining 76% of the initial efficiency after 333 h under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% relative humidity conditions. This work demonstrates that the siloxane-terminated side chain is beneficial for the rational design of dopant-free polymeric HTMs toward efficient and stable PSCs.
