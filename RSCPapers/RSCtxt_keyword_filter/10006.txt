    , Accepted 27th June 2019First published on 27th June 2019AbstractDue to their high efficiency and stability, triple-cation based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now crossed 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the perovskite composition and type of the electron transport layer (ETL) play a key role in improving their performance. Therefore, in the present investigation, high quality TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs and thermally stable reduced methylammonium (MA) cation based triple-cation perovskite layers are used to fabricate thermally stable PSCs. By retaining their normal (n–i–p) device architecture, the influence of antisolvents on the perovskite layer has been investigated in detail. Systematic studies in this work reveal that the amorphous SnO2/TiO2 bilayer and the trifluorotoluene (TFT) processed perovskite layer significantly influence the current density and open circuit voltage (VOC) and reduce the charge recombination of perovskite devices. The optimised devices having micrometer size grains exhibited >20.5 ± 0.5% PCE for a thermally stable Rb0.05(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 perovskite composition with a SnO2/TiO2 bilayer ETL. Furthermore, the SnO2:TiO2 bilayer ETL-containing PSCs are thermally stable for more than 200 hours at 80 °C.
Introduction
Mixed halide, mixed-cation including triple and quadrupole perovskite absorber layer based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now crossed 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to their high absorption coefficient, tunable band gap and higher stability than pristine perovskites.1–8 Now the mixed-halide (double, triple or quadrupole) perovskites crossing 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE).9–12 The stability of unstable methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with a band gap (Eg) of 1.58 eV can be improved by incorporating methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) (2.26 eV).13 However, the relatively low band gap black phase formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite FAPbI3 (Eg = 1.48 eV) with a unique composition of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (1.54 eV) was stable at 100 °C and achieved a PCE of 20.8% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of up to 1.16 V and a current density (JSC) of 24.6 mA cm−2.10 After implementing the triple/quadrupole cations in the above perovskite composition [RbCsFAMA (FA:MA = 0.85:0.15)] the VOC increased up to 1.24 V having an Eg = 1.63 eV resulting in 21.6% PCE.11 However, iodine management in the FAMA mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 with a bandgap of 1.51 eV can eliminate deep-level traps by non-radiative recombination facilitating a higher VOC of 1.11 V yielding a JSC of 25 mA cm−2 with 21.1% PCE. A recent study shows that (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 having a band of Eg = 1.51 eV yielded 23.2% PCE, with a VOC of 1.14 V and a JSC of 24.9 mA cm−2.14
The stability of the perovskite was improved up to 500 hours at 60 °C by developing a new fluorene-terminated hole-transport layer (HTL).7 However, the stability of MA cations is poorer than that of FA-cations.15 Therefore, triple cation based perovskites show much higher self-stability than single or double cation perovskites. Thus, RbI triple cations with reduced MA-based perovskites open a new approach towards self-stable perovskites, as shown in Fig. 1. There are various other aspects such as balanced charge mobility of the electron transport layer (ETL) and the HTL, quality of interfaces and the adopted process which also affect the photovoltaic properties significantly. More importantly, the nature of the antisolvent also plays a key role in tuning the quality of the perovskite thin films, as given in Table S1.†

Attention has been paid to address the concerns of reproducibility and stability of regular n–i–p type planar or mesoporous PSCs. Among the various ETLs, to date compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) and/or mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) ETLs have shown certified efficiency. In addition, c-TiO2 can be used for both planar and mesoscopic types. However, the TiO2 layer still suffers from defect trap levels, which hamper electron transport simultaneously affecting the charge collection efficiency. Therefore, various n-type dopants have been used for TiO2 in order to improve its electron mobility and tune its energy levels.16–23 This doping process facilitates the reduction of electron traps and defect voids of TiO2 crystals resulting in effective electron extraction from the perovskite layer. Regarding the mp-TiO2 layer, it suffers from large grain boundaries but due to the high electron mobility of c-TiO2, the electrons can be extracted efficiently. In order to avoid the drawbacks of mp-TiO2, only planar n–i–p type PSCs are being used. In order to avoid unwanted recombination within the perovskite, it is necessary to extract electrons effectively. Thus, TiO2 is still the most widely used ETL in high-efficiency n–i–p planar-type PSCs due to its excellent photoelectric properties.24 However, the electron mobility of the TiO2 ETL is too low (ca. 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) to match with the high hole mobility of commonly used HTLs (ca. 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), leading to charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface that causes hysteresis and reduced efficiency.25–27 In addition, due to their UV-sensitive nature, implementation of conventional TiO2 ETLs hampers the long-term stability. On the other hand, due to the high electron mobility of tin oxide (SnO2) (μe) (∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with that of TiO2 (∼ 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), SnO2 ETL based PSCs have now crossed 22% PCE.28 SnO2 has several advantages such as a better optical band gap (3.4 to 4.0 eV), efficient processability, high chemical stability and excellent electron mobility. After the first successful demonstration by Fang et al.,27 now, SnO2 ETL based planar PSCs have crossed 22% PCE.8 Furthermore, various metal ion dopants such as Li+, Mg2+, Nb5+, Y3+, and Sb5+ have been used to improve the efficiency of PSCs.29–33 However, these dopants directly affect the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 resulting in a lower VOC. However, due to its very short and precise deposition window, highly uniform deposition of SnO2 on FTO by chemical bath deposition (CBD), spin-coating methods or expensive atomic layer deposition (ALD) is tedious. Therefore, considering the advantages of the high electron mobility of SnO2 and high reproducibility of c-TiO2 ETLs, we have selected SnO2 coated c-TiO2 bilayer ETLs for PSCs. Fig. 2 shows the systematic analysis of the role of bare or SnO2/TiO2 bilayer ETLs in PSCs. Although, a previous report by Choi et al. used an amorphous TiO2 (a-TiO2) ETL followed by a SnO2 bilayer ETL with ∼21.1% PCE, the deposition of a-TiO2 by RF-sputtering followed by anodization is complicated and expensive.34 Detailed SnO2 doped/bilayer ETL based PSC parameters are summarised in Table S1.†
 Fig. 2  Comparison of the efficiency of doped bilayer ETL based PSCs. Note: for few reports, authors used planar as well as mesoporous PSCs. The efficiency values were taken from the respective publication only for the champion cell in reverse scan mode. 
In the present study, we used reduced MA-based perovskites having the composition (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 with a band gap of 1.51 eV and 5% RbI cation incorporation in order to fabricate a highly stable perovskite layer. The role of anti-solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), diethyl-ether and α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (TFT) has been investigated in detail. This study revealed that the amorphous SnO2 ETL on the c-TiO2 ETL for regular n–i–p planar heterojunction PSCs plays a key role in improving its PCE and reducing charge recombination. Because of its high electron mobility, SnO2 occupies the defect sites, which can reduce the surface traps of TiO2 resulting in efficient electron extraction from the perovskite layer. Besides, the high mobility of the SnO2 interfacial layer between the TiO2 and perovskite layer maintained the charge balance of the device. This system facilitates effective hole blocking and reduces the recombination rate effectively yielding >80 ± 3% fill factor (FF). Here, we used a Rb0.05(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 triple cation precursor composition to optimise the VOC and current density of the perovskite devices. Our results revealed that the c-TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs showed ∼21% PCE which is much higher compared to that of conventional c-TiO2 ETLs. This reduced-MA perovskite based on bilayer ETLs not only stabilizes the perovskite but also improves the efficiency significantly with excellent photovoltaic properties.
Results and discussion
Initially, we prepared a compact TiO2 precursor solution and deposited it on a cleaned UV-treated FTO substrate. The bilayer ETL was prepared by the deposition of a ∼10 nm thin SnO2 layer by a simple spin coating method from 0.05 M SnCl2·2H2O solution. Here, the TiO2 precursor solution was spin coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s and annealed in air at 450 °C resulting in a very transparent c-TiO2 film followed by SnO2 top-layer deposition at 3000 rpm. Fig. 3A shows the SEM micrographs of the bare FTO, c-TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 films. From the SEM images of c-TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs it is clear that both samples are fully covered with a homogeneous compact layer even after SnO2 passivation. This homogeneous compact layer could avoid ohmic contact between the perovskite, HTM and gold. The results show that both pristine c-TiO2 and bilayer ETL compact layers are uniformly and homogeneously deposited on the FTO substrate without any pin-holes. The thickness of both electrodes was measured by recording their cross-sectional images (Fig. S1†); both samples showed highly uniform pin-hole free deposition with ∼80 nm thick TiO2 and ∼10 nm SnO2 compact layers formed on the FTO substrate (Fig. S1†). The monolayer c-TiO2 ETL shows a perovskite solution contact angle of ∼16.48° which is further increased up to 28.34° for bilayer TiO2/SnO2 ETLs indicating the hydrophobic nature. This hydrophobic surface facilitated the uniform distribution of nuclei.35,36 The lower wettability of the bilayer ETL provides a lower surface tension dragging force (STDF) resulting in limited nuclei for the formation of perovskite grains, resulting in more considerable grain growth.37,38 This is further proved from SEM micrographs. In order to check the influence of SnO2 on their optical transmittance, we obtained the UV-Vis transmittance spectra of both samples. Fig. 3B shows the optical transmittance spectra of both monolayer TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer electrodes deposited on an FTO substrate. In Fig. 3B, the optical transmittance spectra of c-TiO2 show more than 90% transmittance, which demonstrates that both samples could be used as ETLs for PSCs. The bare FTO sample showed the highest transmittance which was negligibly decreased for TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs. It is noted that both samples exhibited >90% transmittance within the wavelength range from 350–900 nm indicating that these electrodes can be used for PSCs. Interestingly, the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL shows a smoother surface which is beneficial for the formation of high-quality perovskite thin films. XRD analysis of the TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs on the FTO substrate revealed that there are no TiO2 and SnO2 peaks, which may be due to the very small thickness of TiO2 and the amorphous nature of SnO2 (Fig. 3C). The amorphous nature of SnO2 was analysed from its chemical oxidation states.

The chemical compositions of the TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 4). The survey spectrum (Fig. S2†) exhibited the presence of all Ti and O, and Ti, Sn and O atoms respectively for monolayer TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs. The deconvoluted peaks corresponded to Ti(2p3/2) and Ti(2p1/2) at a binding energy (BE) of 458.49 eV and 464.26 eV respectively revealing the octahedrally coordinated Ti4+ state with a spin orbit splitting Δ of 5.77 eV, as shown in Fig. 4A. On the other hand, the presence of Ti4+ chemical states in the TiO2/SnO2 sample is confirmed from the typical high-resolution spectra of Ti(2p3/2) and Ti(2p1/2) photoelectrons in TiO2 at BE values of around 458.81 eV and 464.52 eV, respectively with a spin orbit splitting Δ of 5.71 eV.39 This blue-shift toward lower binding energies due to SnO2 interactions indicates the better electron charge density of titanium atoms and the non-stoichiometric bonding of titanium atoms to oxygen atoms via the introduction of Sn4+ ions into the TiO2 lattice. This process facilitates the reduction of the Ti4+ state to the Ti3+ state by transferring electrons to the adjacent site. The O(1s) core level spectrum of c-TiO2 ETL shows a shoulder peak at 529.82 eV attributed to Ti–O–Ti and another peak at 531.81 eV attributed to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups or chemisorbed water molecules (Ti–OH) respectively. In the case of the bilayer TiO2/SnO2 sample, the O1s peak appears at 531.72 eV with a shoulder peak at 530.23 eV. From the O1s core-level spectrum for both ETLs, the asymmetric nature of the bilayer SnO2/TiO2 ETL compared to the monolayer TiO2 ETL is observed. In particular, a highly intense O1s peak appears at 531.72 eV for the bilayer ETL attributed to the O1s core-level of oxygen anions in SnO2. The oxygen O1s peak was deconvoluted into two major peaks. Basically, the core level peak at a lower binding energy is associated with the Sn–O bond while the core-level peak at a higher binding energy originated from oxygen vacancies or O–H bonding. However, the relatively intense peak at a higher binding energy level (O–H) originates due to the amorphous nature of the SnO2 layer.40,41 The Sn(3d)3/2 and Sn(3d)5/2 core level peaks appear at 495.82, and 487.26 eV respectively revealing the complete oxidation of SnCl2 (Fig. 4E) and the formation of the Sn4+ oxidation state. The presence of this lower oxidation state of Ti ions in the bilayer ETL indicates the formation of a higher percentage of loosely bound Ti3+–O bonds as against the stronger Ti4+–O bonds, which enhances the photoelectron transfer process between the anions and cations and, thus improves the charge transfer properties. Besides, it is also observed that the intensity of the Ti–OH satellite peak is higher for the TiO2/SnO2 ETL which may be due to the increase of adsorption sites for hydroxyl ions which facilitates a better hydrophilic surface (Fig. 4).42

We further used these ETLs for the fabrication of PSCs with the n–i–p planar device architecture. A high quality triple cation Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 perovskite layer was deposited by an anti-solvent engineering process onto a TiO2/SnO2 film followed by annealing at 130 °C for 30 min. Initially, we optimized the perovskite morphology using different antisolvents (Fig. S3a†). Fig. 5A and B show the top-view SEM micrographs of perovskite films deposited on c-TiO2/FTO and SnO2/TiO2/FTO from TFT anti-solvent. These top-views indicate that the bilayer significantly affects the surface morphology of the ETL. Interestingly, the uniform grains formed throughout the substrate can be found from the low-magnification SEM micrograph, as shown in Fig. S3b.† The top-view of the perovskite layer shows that the average grain sizes are improved significantly for the bilayer ETL. The monolayer TiO2 ETL based sample exhibited a grain size of ∼0.500 μm which was improved up to 1.5 μm for the bilayer TiO2/SnO2 ETL. This may be due to the less hydrophilic nature of the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL. This highly uniform bilayer can provide limited and homogeneous nuclei for perovskite growth. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of the corresponding perovskite films are given in Fig. 5C confirming the successful formation of the Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 phase.7,14 Based on the properties of thermally stable perovskites, we annealed the prepared perovskite thin films for different time intervals at 130 °C and recorded their XRD patterns for fresh and 3 h aged samples (Fig. S4†). XRD analysis shows better thermal stability of our prepared Rb0.05(FA0.95MA0.05) composition than the conventional Rb0.05(FA0.85MA0.15) composition. In this study, we have used conventional Rb0.05(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and MA reduced composition Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95. Interestingly, the newly modified reduced MA-based perovskites exhibit slower degradation. However, the conventional 0.85:0.15 composition shows faster degradation as confirmed from the intensity of the PbI2 peak at 12° which is higher than the peak at 14° for the perovskite . Therefore, we conclude that the reduced MA content based perovskite is more stable than the conventional highly efficient composition.

The thickness and morphology differences of each layer were confirmed from cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 5D and E). The film thickness also increased from 490 nm to 680 nm. A similar grain-size and thickness correlation has been reported previously.43,44 It is well known that slower crystallisation of perovskite layer is associated with a higher critical Gibbs free energy which subsequently reduces the number of nuclei. Therefore, perovskite crystal growth will start from the limited nuclei centres resulting in large size grains with a limited grain boundary for TiO2/SnO2 ETLs. These results are also consistent with our wettability test results. These large grains facilitate a low recombination rate and higher VOC. These large grains with limited boundaries in the perovskite/SnO2/TiO2/FTO sample reduce charge recombination due to the presence of limited charge traps.
The 0.95:0.05 FAMA composition (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 shows an ∼820 nm (Eg = 1.51 eV) band edge which is slightly shifted to a shorter wavelength due to the incorporation of Rb cations and appears at ∼790 nm (Eg = 1.57 eV).45 As expected, the optical bandgap estimated from the Tauc method was calculated to be 1.57 eV for both types of ETLs, as shown in Fig. 5F and G. The optical absorption spectrum of the bilayer ETL based perovskite thin film is stronger in the range of ∼800 to 500 than that of the c-TiO2 samples. This enhanced absorption stems from the efficient light harvesting ability due to light scattering within the large grains. The light scattering–trapping–harvesting of the perovskite grains plays a key role in the improvement in light harvesting by increasing the optical path length. The charge-extraction dynamics from the perovskite layer in contact with the monolayer TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy (Fig. 5H and I). As expected a blue-shift from 775 nm was observed in the PL spectra for the triple cation Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 based perovskite thin film, and the c-TiO2/perovskite film exhibited a strong luminescence peak at ∼790 nm, which was suppressed by the presence of the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL. This PL quenching caused an effective charge transfer from the perovskite to the bilayer ETL. The above results elucidate that the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL has an excellent charge extraction ability from the perovskite layer compared to conventional monolayer ETLs. Furthermore, TRPL analysis was carried out in order to investigate the charge-carrier dynamics in conventional and bilayer ETLs in contact with perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 5I. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profile data were fitted to a bi-exponential function of the form,46–48 (1)where, τ1 and τ2 are the first and second order decay time, and A1 and A2 are respective weight factors of each decay channel. The average recombination lifetimes 〈τavg〉 for the respective samples were calculated from lifetime values and weight fraction amplitude values (%) using eqn (2) (2)
The calculated average lifetime 〈τavg〉 for the perovskite in contact with the c-TiO2 interface was 〈τ〉 = 95 ns which suddenly reduced to 55 ns for the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL, as given in Table 1.

The FTO/TiO2/perovskite and FTO/TiO2/SnO2/perovskite thin film samples show that the fast decay lifetimes (τ1) decreased from 14 and 6.3 ns, while the slow decay lifetimes (τ2) of the respective samples are 343 and 198 ns. The calculated fraction values A1 for fast lifetime decay were 0.8378 and 0.7655 respectively for bare and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs. Furthermore, the initial values of the A2 fraction, 0.1622, increased slightly up to 0.2345 for the TiO2/SnO2 ETL. These results revealed that the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer facilitates effective election extraction from the perovskite layer.
Initially, we optimised the grain size of the perovskite layer by using different anti-solvents (Fig. S3a†). Here, we have deposited six different types of perovskite thin films processed with different ETLs and antisolvents and checked their surface morphology (Fig. 5, 6 and S3a†). For solvent engineering processes, the anti-solvent was dripped during the second step of spin coating. During anti-solvent dripping, all samples transformed into transparent yellow/orange colour of the perovskite precursor after spin coating. This is an intermediate phase with a Lewis acid–base adduct of DMSO. These samples were further annealed at 130 °C for 10 min in a glove box to obtain highly crystalline dark black coloured crystalline Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 perovskite thin films. As seen from the SEM micrographs, once we use TFT antisolvent for deposition, we observed the perovskite grains-size has improved up to ∼1.5 μm which is higher than CB and ether antisolvents. This improvement in morphology is attributed to the slow nucleation reaction between PbI2/PbBr2 and FAI/MABr cations due to the synergistic effect of the TFT anti-solvent and the highly uniform TiO2/SnO2 bilayer. The surface morphology shows significant changes for the perovskite thin films deposited using the TFT anti-solvent. The TFT anti-solvent with the FTO/TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL produced high quality textured, pinhole free perovskite thin films with large grain sizes between 1400 and 1500 nm which are much higher than those of CB (250–350 nm) and diethyl-ether (500–600 nm) perovskite thin films (Fig. S3a†). It is also observed that the conventional CB and diethyl ether processed perovskite film shows a number of small grains, while those of the TFT processed sample were highly oriented perpendicular to the substrate perovskite grains (Fig. 5D, E, 6B, C and S3b†). The improved film morphology of the perovskite in the presence of the FTO/TiO2/SnO2 bilayer can be attributed to the limited nucleation process resulting in much larger grains. Furthermore, due to the highly crystalline nature of the perovskite and the large grain size, the perovskite/hole transport material smooth interfaces also influence the device performance.

Fig. 6A shows the schematic of the device architecture and energy level diagram of n–i–p planar heterojunction PSCs and the respective energy level diagram. The n–i–p planar heterojunction type PSCs were fabricated based on conventional TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs. The HTM layer [poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]] (PTAA) containing tert-butyl-pyridine (tBP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as an additive was spin coated onto the perovskite film. Finally, an 80 nm gold layer was thermally evaporated to fabricate the full device (Fig. 6B and C). The PSC device includes a conductive substrate (FTO), a 50 nm compact electron transport layer (c-TiO2 or TiO2/SnO2), an ∼630 nm highly crystalline absorber layer of Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 mixed halide perovskite, a 70 nm PTAA HTM layer, and 80 nm gold contact electrodes. In order to check the thickness of the ETL, perovskite capping layer and HTM, the cross-sectional SEM micrograph of the fabricated devices was recorded (Fig. 6B and C). The cross-sectional SEM micrographs confirm the formation of the designed configuration. It is noted that the thickness of each layer can play a significant role in their photovoltaic performance. The optimised thickness of TiO2/SnO2 is about 80 nm and it uniformly covered the FTO substrate with highly textured large grains of the perovskite capping layer. It is also observed that the perovskite film exhibited highly oriented grains perpendicular to the substrate.

Fig. 7A shows the typical J–V curves of planar n–i–p type PSCs with the TiO2 monolayer and SnO2/TiO2 bilayer ETL. The hysteresis behaviour of the fabricated devices was studied with a 50 ms scanning delay. The perovskite devices were fabricated from a controlled device (c-TiO2) ETL exhibiting an average PCE of 17.03 and 15.94% in reverse and forward scan respectively. In the reverse scan, a JSC of 22.17 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.052 V and a FF of 0.73 resulted in 17.03% PCE. In the forward scan direction, the perovskite device exhibited a JSC of 22.10 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.016 and a FF of 0.71 which resulted in 15.94% PCE (Table 2).

However, once we used the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL for the same composition, the fabricated PSCs exhibited a drastic increase in JSC and VOC. The bilayer ETL exhibited 20.98% PCE with a VOC of 1.085 V, a JSC of 23.30 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.83. Interestingly, the forward scan also exhibited a VOC of 1.085 V with a JSC of 23.22 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.79 resulting in 19.90% PCE, as shown in Fig. 7B. This low hysteresis behaviour is due to the perfect charge balance stemming from the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer. The SnO2 interfacial layer enables faster electron transport by increasing the conductivity of the TiO2 ETL. In addition, better band alignment between TiO2/perovskite benefitting from a desirable work function facilitates fast charge transfer. Therefore, this modified ETL facilitates dual functions such as it can suppress the hysteresis of PSCs and improve the charge transport resulting in the higher PCE. Due to the efficient charge extraction and transportation, the accumulation of charges at the interface was substantially reduced, resulting in the reduction in hysteresis. Therefore, this bilayer ETL provides synergistic effects resulting in negligible hysteresis with a higher FF and improved PCE for planar and mesoscopic PSCs.
From the above discussion, it is clear that the bilayer ETL showed a much higher PCE than other electrodes. Therefore, both devices were used for their external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the bilayer ETL based PSC device exhibited higher EQE values than the reference cell. The calculated integrated current density of the EQE spectra yields photocurrents density of 21.65 and 22.95 mA cm−2 respectively for TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs, in excellent agreement with the measured JSC values, indicating that the spectral mismatch between the simulator used in this study and the true AM 1.5 solar emission is negligibly small. This negligible small difference arises due to the low IPCE intensity during measurements. These results indicate that the bilayer ETL facilitated effective electron extraction at the TiO2/perovskite interface.
Furthermore, we studied the long-term stability of the fabricated devices based on monolayer and bilayer ETLs at room temperature. The obtained results are summarized in Fig. 7D. It is found that the bilayer ETL based PSCs showed much higher stability than bare TiO2 and retain >90% PCE after 1000 hours. This is mainly because of the slow degradation of the perovskite layer in the presence of the SnO2/TiO2 ETL. To study the device stability and for reliable and accurate photocurrent measurements, we have recorded the steady-state photocurrent at the maximum power point.26,49 The steady-state photocurrent output (Fig. 7E and F) of our champion devices exhibited dramatic increase in the initial few seconds and reached up to ∼22.5 and 20.5 mA cm−2 corresponding to 20.98 and 17.03% PCE respectively for TiO2/SnO2 and conventional single TiO2 ETL devices.
These results demonstrated that the photocurrent output was stable for as long as 200 s. The constant photocurrent measurements exhibited a faster stabilisation rate which is consistent with the fabricated Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 film containing a negligible density of trap sites. These trap sites are responsible for the trap-assisted recombination at the grain boundaries. The c-TiO2 ETL based PSC exhibited a decrease in the photocurrent density after 50 s and reached up to 19.5 mA cm−2. In contrast, TiO2/SnO2 ETL based devices show stable photocurrent for >100 s with 22.76 mA cm−2 current density even after 100 s yielding >20% PCE. It is also observed that these values are close to the PCE obtained from the J–V curves which is in good agreement with the stability of the as-fabricated devices. The steady-state current measurements in forward and reverse mode show identical behaviour revealing the quality of the perovskite device. Our champion device produced a JSC of 23.30 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.085 V, and a FF of 0.83 yielding 20.98% PCE (Fig. 8). Furthermore, the champion device showed a stable PCE of >20.1% for 100 min under constant illumination. This stability test revealed that the developed method is highly reproducible, reliable and promising towards air–thermal stability.

For the reproducibility study, we assessed 25 independent perovskite solar cell devices fabricated using c-TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 ETLs deposited from the TFT antisolvent. Fig. 9A–D show the histograms of the statistical distribution for PSCs based on different ETLs. It is noted that the reproducibility of the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL based PSCs is promising compared to conventional monolayer ETLs. For conventional c-TiO2 ETL based devices, we observed an average JSC of 21.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.02 ± 0.01 V, and a FF of 0.72 ± 0.04 yielding an average efficiency of 17.0 ± 0.50%. However, bilayer ETL based PSCs exhibited much higher reproducibility with a JSC of 23.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.08 ± 0.01 V, and a FF of 0.80 ± 0.03 yielding an average efficiency of >20.5 ± 0.5% (Fig. 9A–D). As expected, all bilayer devices show ∼23.5 mA cm−2 with >1.08 V open circuit voltage. These enhanced photovoltaic parameters stem from the SnO2/TiO2 bilayer ETL.

(D) PCE statistical histograms of VOC for different ETLs. (E) J–V curves of the champion device recorded for the fresh perovskite device and after 200 hours of air-thermal stress at 65 °C. (F) Air-thermal-stability of bilayer ETL based PSCs at 80 °C with bias without encapsulation. 
The air–thermal stability of any photovoltaic technology is a key parameter to commercialize photovoltaics. Therefore, these champion devices were further subjected to more harsh conditions to study their long-term air stability. We monitored the thermal stability of the un-encapsulated perovskite device at 80 °C. Fig. 9E shows the J–V curves of the champion device recorded after fabrication and 200 hours in air at 80 °C. Interestingly, the bilayer ETL based modified perovskite composition showed >17.5% PCE after 200 hours at 80 °C thermal stress. In order to study the long-term stability, we stored the reference and champion cells under ambient conditions in the dark without any encapsulation and stored them at 30–35% relative humidity (RH) at 80 °C over 200 hours. To verify the device stability, the performance of more than 25 devices fabricated under similar experimental conditions was monitored. The statistical data are shown in Fig. 9F. Now it is clear that MAPbI3 based perovskites are not thermally stable due to the poor stability of MA-cations. Therefore, we prepared reduced MA-cation based perovskites. For comparison we also monitored the stability of conventional (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 with and without Rb triple cations at 80 °C in air (∼30–35% RH) (Fig. S5†). Although the conventional (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (1.64 eV) perovskite showed a high PCE with a high VOC (∼1.12 V), the modified reduced MA cation based perovskite shows excellent thermal stability (Fig. 9F). Besides, the bilayer ETL based devices retain >95% PCE after 200 hours. This slight degradation in our champion device at a higher temperature of 80 °C arises due to the MA content. From the above discussion it is clear that >20% PCE with >95% stability at 80 °C can be possible for a reduced MA-cation based perovskite absorber layer. From previous literature, it is confirmed that using this approach with the best composition, we can obtain the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency of >20.5% by using the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL with the Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 perovskite absorber layer processed from a TFT anti-solvent. We also believe that MA cation free perovskite layers based on this bilayer ETL will show higher stability. This study is underway in our laboratory.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs have been developed by a simple spin coating process. We successfully demonstrated >20.5 ± 0.5% PCE which is much higher than that of previous bilayer ETLs. The developed bilayer ETLs are highly uniform and pin-hole free which can improve the VOC and FF of the PSC devices effectively. The optimised 10 nm SnO2 top layer on the TiO2 layer facilitates effective charge separation resulting in an improvement in the PCE from 17.03% to 20.98% with better air stability. Interestingly, the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL based PSCs show excellent thermal stability at 80 °C over 200 hours and retain >95% PCE. Therefore, we suggest that the developed method is a promising approach to improve the efficiency with a reduced recombination rate.
Materials and methods
Materials
All of the chemicals and materials were purchased and used without further purification. Materials including solvents N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), diethyl sulfide (98%), PbI2 (99%), RbI (99.9% Sigma-Aldrich) and tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, >98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Hydroiodic acid (aqueous, 57 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a solution of methylamine (aqueous, 40 wt%, TCI Chemicals) and formamidine acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for the preparation of MAI and FAI. For HTM preparation, toluene (99%, Sigma Aldrich), acetonitrile (99.8% Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%, Aldrich) solvents were used. Antisolvents such as chlorobenzene (CB, >99% Sigma Aldrich), diethyl-ether (>99% Sigma Aldrich) and α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (TFT, >99% Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received.
Methods

Preparation of c-TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 bilayer electron transport layers (ETLs). 
Laser-patterned FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC-8, Pilkington) were ultrasonically cleaned in an alkaline aqueous solution, rinsed with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol and then treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A nearly 60–80 nm thin compact blocking TiO2 (Bl-TiO2) layer was deposited on the substrates by spin coating the TiO2 precursor and then annealing the spin-coated precursor in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The precursor composition was as follows: 1 mL commercial titanium isopropoxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol containing 12 M HCl. The SnO2 bilayer on the TiO2 ETL was achieved by spin coating 0.05 M tin(II) chloride dihydrate [SnCl2·2H2O] in ethanol at 3000 rpm for 20 s followed by 45 min of annealing at 180 °C.


Synthesis of the perovskite precursors and their solution. 
FAI and MABr were synthesized as per our reports.50 Briefly, methylamine solution and formamidine acetate powder were separately reacted with hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich) and hydrobromic acid (HBr) for the preparation of MABr and FAI. The reactions were carried out in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solutions at 60 °C for 2 h. The products were dissolved in ethanol or methanol, recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The FAPbX/MAPbX precursors were synthesized by reacting a desirable amount of FAI, MABr, PbI2, and PbBr2 powder in DMF/DMSO (4:1 v/v%) solution. A desired volume (5%) of RbI in DMF:DMSO (4:1) was added to the above solution to prepare Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 and the solution was transferred to a glove box. All devices were fabricated and annealed in a nitrogen filled glove box. The clear filtered yellow solution was spin coated on the top of the FTO/TiO2 and FTO/TiO2/SnO2 ETLs by a consecutive two-step spin coating process at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. 100 μL of CB, 1 mL diethyl-ether or 200 μL of TFT was drop-cast during the second spin-coating step followed by heat treatment (130 °C) on a hot plate for 10 min to form a dark-black colored crystalline Rb0.05(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 thin film.


Preparation of the PTAA based HTM. 
The hole transport material (HTM) was prepared as per our previous report.50 15 mg of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 1.5 mL toluene (99.8%, Aldrich) with the addition of 15 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg mL−1) in acetonitrile and 7.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%, Aldrich). The prepared PTAA HTM solution was spin-coated on the FTO/TiO2/SnO2/perovskite electrode at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. For the counter electrode, 80 nm thick Au contacts were deposited on the top of the HTM layer by thermal evaporation (growth rate ∼ 0.5 Å s−1). Precautions were taken for each step as per previous literature. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.09 cm2. The active area was calculated based on the cross-sectional area of gold and the laser pattern. The exact illumination of the active area was fixed by attaching a metal shadow mask from the back side during measurements.

Characterization
All characterization and measurements were performed in ambient air. The top-surface and cross-sectional images were recorded using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Uitima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a Cu K line of 1.5410 Å. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a photoluminescence spectrometer (f = 0.5 m, Acton Research Co., Spectrograph 500i, USA), and an intensified CCD (PI-MAX3) (Princeton Instrument Co., IRY1024, USA). A DPSS (diode pumped solid state) laser (Ekspla) with a wavelength of 266 nm and a power of 310 mW was utilized as an excitation source for PL measurements.
Photovoltaic studies
All characterizations and measurements were performed in ambient air. The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator (McScience K201 LAB50) in air under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar irradiation (McScience, K401 CW150 lamp power supply), for which the light intensity was adjusted to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) through the use of an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The incident light intensity for J–V measurements was controlled using a shutter. The exposure of the perovskite devices to the light source is short, which does not increase the temperature of the cells. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.09 cm2. The active area was calculated based on the cross-sectional area of gold and the laser pattern and a metal shadow mask. The exact illumination of the active area was fixed by attaching a thin metal shadow mask (0.09 cm2) from the back side during measurements. J–V measurements were carried out in reverse scan mode at 50 ms delay unless mentioned otherwise.
External quantum efficiency measurements
The spectral response was obtained using a spectral external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement system (K3100, McScience), which was equipped with a monochromator, a K240 XE 300 lamp source connected with a K401 OLS XE300W lamp power supply and a K102 signal amplifier. Prior to the use of the light, the spectral response and the light intensity were calibrated using a Si-photodiode (Model: S1337-1010BQ) and an InGaAs photodiode (Model: G12180-050A) to 300–1100 nm and 1100–1400 nm calibration respectively. Measurements were taken in EQE mode.
Life time measurements
Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay transients were measured at 800 ± 20 nm using excitation with a 470 nm light pulse at a frequency of 5 MHz using an F-7000 Spectrophotometer.
Device stability
The steady-state efficiencies were obtained by tracking the maximum power point. For the stability study, the perovskite devices without encapsulation were kept in an electric oven at room temperature, 65 ± 1 °C and 80 ± 1 °C for 25 devices for each method at a relative humidity of 25–30%. All devices were kept in a dry electric oven at the respective temperature in a covered Petri dish. The measurements were carried out under ambient conditions at a relative humidity of 25–30%.
