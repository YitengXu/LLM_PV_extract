    , Accepted 24th June 2014First published on 26th June 2014AbstractNovel ruthenium complexes (MC113–MC117), obtained by modifying the terpyridine ligand of the black dye (N749), have been evaluated as sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The modification is carried out by attaching selected chromophores, with varying electron donating strength, covalently to the central ring of the ligand. The complexes, compared to the parent dye, show red shifted absorption covering visible and near IR regions and higher molar extinction coefficients. We report in this work synthesis of a series of these ruthenium complexes with chromophores such as tert-butyl phenyl, triphenylamine, bithiophene, phenoxazine and phenothiazine. Detailed experimental characterization using optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic techniques has been carried out and complemented by density functional theory studies. The fill factors (ff) obtained for these dyes are larger than those of the parent black dye. In spite of these superior properties, the dyes show only moderate to good power conversion efficiencies. The possible reasons for this have been investigated and discussed.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted increasing attention as promising alternatives to conventional silicon based solar cells due to their low cost and ease of fabrication.1,2 The optimum efficiency of a DSSC device depends upon several parameters and particularly the structure of the sensitizer plays a major role. The ground and excited state energy levels of the dye should be well matched with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the redox mediator and the conduction band of the semiconductor, respectively, in order to facilitate easy regeneration of the sensitizer and facile electron injection onto TiO2.3–11 Among a large variety of dyes investigated for DSSC application,11–30 Ru-sensitizers11–17 have attracted more attention because of their low lying metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition that extends into the red and near-infrared region of the solar spectrum, contributing to very high efficiencies of N3,11N71912 and N749.13 In this context, much attention has been devoted to enhance the performance of DSSCs by engineering sensitizers. For example, ancillary ligands of the bipyridyl ruthenium complexes have been modified for tuning the photophysical properties of the sensitizers leaving the dicarboxy bipyridine for performing its duty of grafting the sensitizer onto the TiO2 for effective electronic communication.31–42 In contrast, the structural variation of ruthenium-terpyridyl complexes warrants the presence of an anchoring group as well as the tunable chromophores on the same terpyridyl ligand and are comparatively less addressed because of the synthetic challenges involved. Ruthenium complexes with an electron donating group on the terminal ring of the dicarboxy terpyridines have been reported,43–45 while terpyridine ligands carrying the two carboxy groups on the terminal rings and the electron donating group on the middle ring have not been reported for DSSC applications.
The application of the black dye (N749) was successfully explored as a base-dye along with small organic molecules as co-sensitizers achieving the highest certified record efficiency.46 The broad absorption properties of the terpyridyl ruthenium complexes offer a large space for structural modification to further improve the DSSC performance. Such modifications can extend the absorption of a sensitizer further into the near infrared region. While not all such modifications lead to highly efficient sensitizers, many of these give us an opportunity to understand in detail the structure and property relationship. These studies also give us a deep insight into more fundamental issues like charge transfer, polarization, binding, etc. Keeping this in view, we in this work have modified the terpyridine ring by substituting chromophores covalently on the central ring while retaining the anchoring groups on the terminal rings to create novel ligands that can form complexes with the Ru metal. These new ruthenium terpyridyl sensitizers are shown as MC113–MC117 in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
The functionalization of the central ring in these complexes has been systematically studied by attaching chromophores with different electron donating strength. In MC113 the chromophore is a tert-butyl phenyl group which is shown to have a moderately electron donating moiety.47,48 In MC114, the triarylamine group, a widely used chromophore in electro and optical materials, is incorporated owing to its strong electron donating and transporting capability and the propeller starburst molecular shape.48,49 Hexyl bithiophene, which has been used as the chromophore in MC115, is expected to increase the solubility and red shift the absorption peak, apart from increasing the molar extinction coefficient of the sensitizer.50,51 Diheteroanthracenes (phenoxazine and phenothiazines) are heterocyclic compounds with electron-rich oxygen/sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms, and these molecules are non-planar with a butterfly conformation in the ground state, which can impede the molecular aggregation and the formation of intermolecular excimers.52–55 Phenoxazine and phenothiazines are also potential hole transport materials in organic devices, presenting unique electronic and optical properties. Hence these moieties were selected as chromophores in MC116 and MC117.
Detailed experimental characterization of the new ruthenium complexes MC113–MC117 has been carried out using optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic techniques while the standard quantum chemical software has been employed for DFT studies. A structure–property relationship between the substituted terpyridyl group in the ruthenium complexes and the efficiency of the DSSC device has been systematically studied.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
We introduced different electron donor groups at the central pyridine (4′-position) of terpyridine by the Krohnke method.56,58 The synthetic route for MC113–MC117 is shown in Scheme 1. Isonicotinic acid was used as the starting material. The ethylisonicotinate derivative 6 was synthesized, according to a previously published procedure, in 90% yield.57 Compound 6 was subjected to acylation using paraldehyde and CF3COOH in acetonitrile medium under reflux for 4 h to give 2-acetyl isonicotinate (7) in 61% yield. The intermediate R3-aldehyde (1) was synthesized using 5-hexylthiophene-2-boronoic acid pinacol ester and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde under Suzuki reaction conditions. The aldehydes 4 and 5 were synthesized by N-alkylation followed by the Vilsmeier–Haack formylation on phenoxazine and phenothiazine respectively. The commercially available aldehyde partners (R1-CHO and R2-CHO) and the aldehydes 1, 4–5 were further reacted with 7 in the presence of sodium hydroxide and ammonia in methanol affording 40–50% yields of the corresponding 4′-functionalized 4,4′′-dicarboxyterpyridine (8). The terpyridine ligands (8a–e) on complexation with RuCl3·3H2O, followed by treatment with NH4NCS results in the formation of diester, which upon hydrolysis using triethylamine afforded the desired ruthenium complexes (MC113–MC117) in 39–47% yield. The new complexes were characterised by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray-ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS).

Geometries
Knowledge of the geometry is important to understand the properties and also the effect of substitution. The optimized ground state geometries of the complexes MC113–MC117 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Bulky alkyl groups of the ancillary ligands are replaced with methyl groups so as to minimize the computational complexity without compromising the quantitative picture. The optimized geometries reveal that the basic Ru[3 + 3] skeleton of MC113–MC117 is like that of an octahedron. The carboxylic acid groups and the pyridines of all the complexes are in the same plane. The optimized geometry parameters are tabulated in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). It has been observed that there is not much variation of the geometry with regard to both bond lengths and bond angles on substitution with different chromophores.

Molecular orbitals
Analysis of the molecular orbitals, obtained using computational methods, would be helpful to understand some fundamental properties of the molecules, like the nature of charge transfer of the electronic transitions. Additionally the HOMO and the LUMO energies can also be compared to the values obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments to obtain a complementary picture of the frontier orbitals. The molecular orbitals obtained at the M06/LANL2DZ level of theory along with the percentage contributions of the individual groups are shown in detail in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and the important ones (mainly HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1) in Fig. 1. The molecular orbital pictures indicate that the HOMOs of the molecules MC113–MC115, MC117 are distributed on the Ru atom (∼40%), NCS (∼40%), and terpyridine ligands (∼20%), while HOMO of MC116 is distributed evenly on all the three groups, viz., Ru (32%), NCS (30%), and terpyridine (38%). HOMO−1 of MC113–MC117 has similar contribution from all three groups, viz., Ru (∼43%), NCS (∼45%), and terpyridine (∼12%). HOMO−2 of MC116 is mainly located on terpyridine (76%). HOMO−3 of MC113 is mainly located on NCS (100%), and for the molecules MC114, MC115, MC117 it is delocalized on terpyridine (>70%), NCS (<30%), and Ru atom (<5%). LUMO as well as LUMO+1 and LUMO+3 of all the molecules have major contributions from terpyridine ligands (>90%).

It is also clear from these pictures that the HOMO is slightly delocalized on the chromophore attached to the central ring in all the molecules. Inspecting the antibonding orbitals we note that in LUMO and LUMO+1 the contribution from the chromphore is drastically reduced, thus indicating that if the excited state transition involves HOMO to LUMO or LUMO+1, then this transition would involve charge transfer from the chromophore to the central part of the terpyridine ligand.
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra obtained for MC113–MC117 in DMF solvent is shown in Fig. 2 and relevant data summarized in Table 2. It is seen that all the molecules have an absorption in the range 250–900 nm. Compared to the N749 dye the new sensitizers show red shifted broad absorption covering visible and near-IR regions with higher molar extinction coefficients. The bands in the range 250–450 nm can be broadly attributed to the ligand centred π–π* electronic transition and/or metal to ligand charge transition (MLCT). The bands corresponding to the longer wavelength (λmax) at 620–655 nm can be broadly attributed to the MLCT from the occupied 4d orbitals of ruthenium to the lowest unoccupied π* orbitals of the terpyridine ligand.13 The λmax of MC113–MC117 in the low-energy region spans absorption range from 632 nm to 654 nm and is a result of chemical tuning of the complexes by structural design. The λmax bands of all the five sensitizers are red shifted around 10–30 nm relative to that of N749 (620 nm). The absorption wavelength order follows MC113 (632 nm) < MC114 (638 nm) < MC115 (646 nm) < MC116 (654 nm) ∼MC117 (654 nm), which is in line with the increasing conjugation length of the 4′-functionalized terpyridine ligands. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) for the MLCT band of these ruthenium dyes are in the order MC115 (16476 M−1 cm−1) > MC116 (11637 M−1 cm−1) > MC117 (10502 M−1 cm−1) > MC114 (8335 M−1 cm−1) > MC113 (7794 M−1 cm−1), which are comparable and higher than that of N749 (8930 M−1 cm−1). Thus, these results indicate that extension of π-conjugation at the 4′- position of the terpyridyl ligand can lower the MLCT energy and also increase the absorption intensity and the effect is clearly seen in the case of MC115 absorption spectra with a bithiophene chromophore on the central ring (εmax = 16476 M−1 cm−1). In the case of tricyclic isosters (phenothiazine and phenoxazine), phenoxazine based MC116 showed a higher extinction coefficient compared to phenathiazine based MC117. This could be attributed to strong electron donating nature. The bathochromic shift and hyperchromic effects of the absorption in these new sensitizers indicate that in addition to e-donating character, the extension of conjugation at the 4′-position of the terpyridyl ligand through the incorporation of an aromatic segment is beneficial to the light-harvesting ability of the sensitizer.

TDDFT calculations were carried out to analyze the photo physical behaviour of these complexes and also for understanding the transitions in terms of molecular orbitals. The normalized plots of simulated and experimental UV-Vis spectra of MC113–MC117 are given in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The summarized data of important allowed transitions within the range of 450–850 nm in comparison with experimental λmax are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The results are in good agreement with experimental UV-Vis spectra. The most intense singlet transitions of MC113–MC117 in this range are shown. In MC113 it is dominant from HOMO to LUMO+1 (89%) at 657 nm, with oscillator strength, f = 0.1274. In MC114, it is from HOMO to LUMO+1 (95%) at 662 nm, with f = 0.1227. In MC115, it is from HOMO to LUMO+1 (89%) at 666 nm with f = 0.1231. In MC116, it is from HOMO to LUMO+1 (80%) at 665 nm with f = 0.1231, and for MC117 it is from HOMO to LUMO+1 (87%) at 660 nm with f = 0.1238. All these observations suggest that this transition is dominated by metal to terpyridine ligand and additionally it is also strengthened by the small charge transfer transition from the chromophore to the terpyridine ligand.
In general, the charge transfer in the molecules under study is dominant from their HOMO and HOMO−1 comprising largely of the Ru(II) atom and the NCS ligand, and partly from HOMO−3, which is mainly distributed on ancillary part of the terpyridine ligand to LUMO, LUMO+1, LUMO+3, which are located mainly on the terpyridine ligand. From the orbital pictures, it can be inferred that the main allowed charge transfer transitions in the molecules are of metal–ligand (MLCT) and ligand–ligand (LLCT) as also inferred from the experimental data. The band gap, E0–0, obtained from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra is also shown in Table 2.
Redox properties
The differential pulse voltammetry measurements were carried out to obtain the oxidation potentials of the new sensitizers. The main aim is to obtain a picture of the availability of adequate driving energy for dye regeneration to occur and also the excited state oxidation potentials. The oxidation potentials of the RuIII/II couple are calculated to be 0.67, 0.66, 0.67, 0.64 and 0.67 V (vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) for MC113, MC114, MC115, MC116 and MC117, respectively (Fig. 3a and Table 2). This potential is sufficiently more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE) and provides enough driving force for efficient dye regeneration.59–64 Excited state oxidation potentials must be sufficiently more negative than the TiO2 conduction band for efficient electron injection. The excited-state oxidation potentials (Eox*) of MC113, MC114, MC115, MC116 and MC117 calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, are −1.08, −0.99, −0.94, −0.99 and −0.95 V vs. NHE, respectively. The Eox* values here are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) ensuring an efficient electron injection process from the excited state of the dyes into the TiO2 electrode (Fig. 3b).65–69

Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to evaluate the thermal stability of ruthenium sensitizers. The measurements were carried out in a TGA/SDTA 851 °C Thermal system (mettler Toledo, Switzerland) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range 25–600 °C under a N2 atmosphere (flow rate, 30 mL, min−1). Film samples ranging from 1 to 7 mg were placed in the sample pan and heated. During the heating period the weight loss was recorded as a function of temperature. The incorporation of different electron donating groups (shown in Scheme 1, Fig. S1†) at the 4′-position of the terpyridine ligand makes the dye more hydrophobic and increases the thermal stability. According to the thermogram (Fig. 4) MC113 and MC116 are more stable than all other sensitizers. Percentage of conversion of the sensitizers (MC113–MC117) at 600 °C are recorded as 10.82%, 41.94%, 33.83%, 10.25%, 49.32%, respectively, and under similar conditions black dye recorded 64.57%.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of the new sensitizers MC113–MC117 in DSSCs was tested by constructing the 0.25 cm2 active area TiO2 electrodes using a thermally stable electrolyte composed of 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazole iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile. Fig. 5 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of excitation wavelength for DSSCs based on MC113–MC117, compared with N749. Notably, the IPCE of MC113 is the highest as compared to the other dyes reaching 34% at 590 nm, while it decreases to 18% at 590 nm, 20% at 590 nm, 24% at 590 nm and 15% at 540 nm for MC114, MC115, MC116 and MC117, respectively.

The lower IPCE values observed for MC113–MC117 when compared with N749 might be attributed to the steric constraints associated with the 4′-substitution units on the terpyridine resulting in the loss of co-planarity and conjugation while anchored on TiO2. Further bulkiness of these 4′-substitutions might have prevented the effective grafting onto the TiO2 surface slowing down the electron injection. Generally, it is known from the equation IPCE = (1240 × Jsc)100/(λ × Pin) (in %) that the IPCE value is closely related to Jsc at a specific wavelength and a fixed input power (Pin). The IPCE values of the devices constructed from the new complexes are in the range of 310–750 nm and roughly follow the order of the Jsc values observed (MC113 > MC115 > MC116 > MC114 > MC117).
The Jsc, Voc and ff of the DSSCs were measured under standard global AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2). The current–voltage (J–V) curves for DSSCs based on MC113–MC117 are shown (Fig. 6) and the detailed device performance data are listed in Table 2. The Jsc values of the solar cells for MC113–MC117 are 8.28, 4.66, 6.16, 5.94 and 3.31 mA cm−2, respectively. The high Jsc observed for the MC113 is attributed to its high IPCE value in the range of 400–650 nm. It is obvious that the dark current of MC113–MC117 dyes is increased in the order of MC117 < MC116 < N749 < MC113 < MC114 < MC115 under the same bias leading to a consequent increase of recombination rate between the injected electrons and I3– in electrolytes, which causes a consequent decrease in Voc values. An interesting point is that all these dyes show larger fill factors. The larger fill factors of the novel compounds MC113–MC117 are assumed to be arising from stronger intermolecular interactions suggesting better pathways for charge carriers to the electrodes. In addition this may be also attributed to the lower series resistances compared with N749 dye. The power conversion efficiencies (η) of MC113, MC114, MC115, MC116 and MC117 sensitized solar cells are moderate at 3.59%, 2.08%, 2.65%, 2.72% and 1.59%, respectively (vs. 6.51% for N749 under the same device-fabrication process and measuring conditions). The dye with the moderate electron donating group (MC113) exhibited a better photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.59% than the other four dyes because of the increase in the Jsc value. The lower η is largely due to the lower Jsc of the sensitizers as compared to N749 that is associated with their lesser IPCE.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark under a bias of −0.60 V to characterize the charge transfer resistances of the cells with a frequency range of 50 mHz to 1000 kHz. The Nyquist plots for MC113–MC117 and N749 dye sensitized solar cells are shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that there are two semicircles in the Nyquist plots. The first smaller semicircle at higher frequency represents the charge transfer resistances at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the second larger one at lower frequency indicates charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. It is obvious that the recombination resistance (Rct) obtained from the Z-view software and the inset model at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface is decreased in the order of MC117 (1159 Ω) > MC116 (402 Ω) > N749 (261 Ω) > MC113 (208 Ω) > MC114 (115 Ω) > MC115 (69 Ω), which indicates that the recombination reaction rate of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte is increased in the order of MC117 < MC116 < N749 < MC113 < MC114 < MC115 in the dark. The simulated electron lifetime (τe) could be estimated by τe = Rct × Cμ. The corresponding τe values for the DSSCs based on MC113–MC117 and N749 dyes are 115 ms, 60 ms, 39 ms, 229 ms, 615 ms and 128 ms, respectively. The order of the above lifetime values is consistent with that of the Rct and Voc. Therefore, the enhanced electron lifetime may be the intrinsic reason for the higher Voc values of the DSSCs based on MC117 and MC116 compared to that for N749.

Conclusions
Replacement of the carboxy group with a chromophore on the central ring of the terpyridine ligand in the ruthenium complex gives rise to enhanced absorption and higher molar absorption coefficient compared to N749. The novel, structurally modified ruthenium complexes also show better thermal stability. On the other hand when sensitized on the TiO2 surface, there is a drop in the efficiency of the test cells which is resulting from lower IPCE values. This is probably due to the slowdown of electron injection capacity of the sensitizer, as the bulky substitution on the central ring of the terpyridine ligand may be hindering proper grafting of carboxylic groups on the TiO2. Most interestingly the fill factors of all the new sensitizers are higher compared to the parent N749 dye and are assumed to be arising from stronger intermolecular interactions suggesting better pathways for charge carriers to the electrodes. The experimental results complimented with DFT studies provided insights into the structure–property relationship. The exact reasons for the higher ff values and moderate efficiencies are under further investigation.
Experimental section

All other chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification, and all reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance 300 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model LCMS-2010EV system that was equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) probe. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectrometer. Electrochemical data were recorded using an Autolab potentiostat/Galvanostat PGSTAT30. The DPV curves were obtained from a three electrode cell in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, N,N-dimethylformamide solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, Pt wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and calibrated with ferrocene. Emission spectra were recorded on a J. Y. Horiba model Fluorolog3 fluorescence spectrometer.

Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was prepared as follows. After cleaning, a ∼10 μm double layer of TiO2 particles was deposited by screen-printing on the fluorine tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (12–14 Ω per square, TEC 15, USA). Then the fabricated TiO2 thin-film electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After that, the electrodes were immersed in acetonitrile solution (2 × 10−4 mol L−1 sensitizers) containing 2 × 10−3 M chenodeoxycholic acid as the coadsorbent for at least 12 h. After soaking into the dye solution, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrodes were rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and dried. The DSSCs used for photovoltaic measurements consists of a dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode, a 45 μm thermal adhesive film (Surlyn®, USA), an organic electrolyte and a counter electrode. The Pt catalyst was deposited on the FTO glass by spraying H2PtCl6 solution and pyrolysis at 410 °C for 20 min to prepare the counter electrode. The organic electrolyte solution was a mixture of 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazole iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile. The active area of the TiO2 film electrodes was 0.25 cm2. The DSSCs were tested under an ambient atmosphere with a 3A grade solar simulator (Newport, USA, 94043A) under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination to obtain the photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves. The incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900 nm, using a QE/IPCE measurement kit (Newport, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a electrochemical workstation (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) in the frequency region from 50 mHz to 1000 kHz at perturbation amplitude of 10 mV in the dark.
DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were carried out to gain deeper understanding of the electronic structure and photophysical behaviour of the molecules, using the Gaussian09 program package.70 The closed shell configurations of the five ruthenium(II) sensitizers, MC113–MC117, with a charge of −1 were fully optimized in the gas phase with PBE071,72 hybrid functional and LANL2DZ73–76 basis set (double zeta quality), which uses Dunning D95V basis functions on first row atoms, Los Alamos, ECP plus DZ on Na–La, Hf–Bi, was adopted on all atoms. Vibrational frequency analysis has been carried out to ensure that there are no imaginary frequencies. Thus, the optimized structures correspond to real minima on the potential energy surface.
At the optimized geometry, TDDFT calculations were performed at the M0677/LANL2DZ level of theory in DMF solvent by means of the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM),78,79 as implemented in Gaussian09. 80 singlet–singlet excitations at S0 optimized geometry were calculated. The software GaussSum2.2.580 was used to simulate the major portion of the absorption spectrum and to interpret the nature of transitions. The molecular orbital surfaces were generated by Gaussview,81 and the percentage contributions of the Ru(II) and the ligands to the respective molecular orbitals were calculated using GaussSum.
